[00:00.000 --> 00:08.240]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08.240 --> 00:13.800]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:13.800 --> 00:15.480]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15.480 --> 00:23.240]  It is Sunday, the 17th day of October 2010 for the abbreviated Sunday Transmission 4-6
[00:23.240 --> 00:24.240]  Central every Sunday.
[00:24.240 --> 00:29.760]  I, of course, will be back to live tomorrow for the weekday broadcast.
[00:29.760 --> 00:38.080]  At 11 a.m. Central, a lot of amazingly important news and information to cover in the next
[00:38.080 --> 00:39.080]  two hours.
[00:39.080 --> 00:45.280]  And I have a specific question that I want to issue out to the listeners when we open
[00:45.280 --> 00:50.320]  the phone lines up and I'll tell you that specific question that I want to get your
[00:50.320 --> 00:57.040]  view on, your take on, as we have a two-hour brainstorm here on air.
[00:57.040 --> 01:00.920]  So I'll throw that question out after the break.
[01:00.920 --> 01:05.240]  Obviously, we've been talking about this for a decade, but now the chickens are coming
[01:05.240 --> 01:11.800]  home to roost, dealing with the fact that a week and a half ago the house passed a bill
[01:11.800 --> 01:17.320]  to allow basically the big megabanks to take anybody's house they want for any reason and
[01:17.320 --> 01:20.320]  not even have deeds or paperwork.
[01:20.320 --> 01:24.640]  Extremely dangerous and we're being held hostage by these criminals via financial terrorism.
[01:24.640 --> 01:29.960]  We'll also look at other areas of the economy and the election coming up in just about two
[01:29.960 --> 01:32.640]  weeks from now.
[01:32.640 --> 01:35.000]  And the rats are truly leaving the sinking ship.
[01:35.000 --> 01:42.000]  Bill Clinton openly campaigning against Barack Hussein Obama for his wife, Herr Hillary.
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.360]  So they're going to have the new novel situation of, oh, look, it's a novelty, a guy that's
[01:47.360 --> 01:48.920]  part Africans running.
[01:48.920 --> 01:54.360]  Show what if Wall Street's financing him just like McCain, you know, he's got brown skin.
[01:54.360 --> 01:55.360]  Things will change.
[01:55.360 --> 01:59.240]  Oh, look, we'll have Palin on the right and Hillary Clinton on the left.
[01:59.240 --> 02:00.240]  Things are going to change.
[02:00.240 --> 02:03.040]  And it's just a novelty to confuse the public.
[02:03.040 --> 02:08.200]  Oh, I'd vote for a woman, a black person, Hispanic and Asian in 10 seconds if they had
[02:08.200 --> 02:10.880]  a history of being patriots like Ron Paul.
[02:10.880 --> 02:13.960]  Just so happens he's an old white guy and I'll vote for him in a minute because I know
[02:13.960 --> 02:15.080]  he's never flipped flopping.
[02:15.080 --> 02:16.080]  He's for real.
[02:16.080 --> 02:19.960]  And I agree with about 99% of his issues and policies and ideas.
[02:19.960 --> 02:24.800]  But even if I agree with 75%, I'm still supporting because he was the same yesterday, today and
[02:24.800 --> 02:25.880]  tomorrow.
[02:25.880 --> 02:28.240]  And that's what you need is surety.
[02:28.240 --> 02:32.960]  What you need is stability and getting back to the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:32.960 --> 02:39.080]  Obviously, the 2010 Money Bomb, the third annual was a huge success.
[02:39.080 --> 02:42.680]  I want to, from the bottom of my heart, thank all of you for helping us go to the next level
[02:42.680 --> 02:43.680]  and continue on.
[02:43.680 --> 02:47.520]  We'll now have no problem finishing the studio, getting the personnel we need and launching
[02:47.520 --> 02:52.280]  the daily TV blitz and then the weekly full production, one hour transmission that we're
[02:52.280 --> 02:54.280]  going to add to the radio show.
[02:54.280 --> 02:58.880]  We're updating infowarsmoneybomb.com right now.
[02:58.880 --> 03:06.040]  Before the mail has even come in, we have raised $412,000.
[03:06.040 --> 03:08.840]  And I would imagine $20,000, $30,000 additionally will come in.
[03:08.840 --> 03:11.040]  I would have liked to reach $500,000.
[03:11.040 --> 03:12.040]  That's really what we needed.
[03:12.040 --> 03:17.480]  But $400,000 plus is super, super close to what we needed in this horrible economy.
[03:17.480 --> 03:22.680]  It's just amazing that it was about $100,000 more right now than the last two Money Bombs
[03:22.680 --> 03:23.680]  raised each time.
[03:23.680 --> 03:27.640]  The first one raised $300,000, the second about $335,000.
[03:27.640 --> 03:31.360]  And this one right now, $412,000 is what is in the kitty.
[03:31.360 --> 03:40.280]  And I would imagine it'll go up to about $430,000 or so with my dead reckoning.
[03:40.280 --> 03:45.160]  If you'd still like to donate a dollar or $1,000, $50, $20, it's all welcome towards
[03:45.160 --> 03:46.160]  this fight.
[03:46.160 --> 03:50.200]  And 100% of the Money Bomb money coming is putting directly into the studio in our operation
[03:50.200 --> 03:51.200]  and films.
[03:51.200 --> 03:56.480]  And what we're doing here, it's infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[03:56.480 --> 03:59.680]  There isn't crew here to answer the phones and take donations that way, but you can start
[03:59.680 --> 04:06.880]  calling tomorrow at 8 a.m. if you'd like, 888-253-3139, the regular number to call in the online
[04:06.880 --> 04:11.280]  video bookstore, t-shirts, books, any of those type of things are available at that number.
[04:11.280 --> 04:13.760]  You can also call and donate.
[04:13.760 --> 04:15.760]  That's 888-253-3139.
[04:15.760 --> 04:23.040]  A lot of people have noticed my voice is a lot deeper and broadcasting 25 and a half
[04:23.040 --> 04:26.120]  hours straight than Watson came in the last hour and a half.
[04:26.120 --> 04:29.960]  So 27 hours total on air.
[04:29.960 --> 04:34.680]  My voice is a little bit worn out as they say, but it should be better by tomorrow.
[04:34.680 --> 04:38.640]  But this is a piece of cake right now, two hours here with you, and I really look forward
[04:38.640 --> 04:39.640]  to talking to you.
[04:39.640 --> 04:43.480]  I'll get into all the news and incredible information and give you the number when we
[04:43.480 --> 04:47.840]  come back in the specific question that I want to pose for all of you out there.
[04:47.840 --> 04:55.000]  I really want to get your view and your take and your idea on, well, it deals with hypocrisy
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.960]  and how to bring criminals to justice.
[04:56.960 --> 04:58.960]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[04:58.960 --> 04:59.960]  Hello, friends.

[05:00.960 --> 05:04.080]  You've heard me talk about Calvin five-star subs for years.

[05:20.320 --> 05:23.080]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[05:23.080 --> 05:28.080]  Since 1947, Calvin soap company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and

[05:38.520 --> 05:39.520]  Thank you.
[05:39.520 --> 06:05.800]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's
[06:05.800 --> 06:12.800]  a war on for your mind.
[06:12.800 --> 06:21.520]  For live, my friends, it is Sunday, the 17th day of October, 2010.
[06:21.520 --> 06:25.440]  The election is shaping up to be even more devastating to the Democrats than many had
[06:25.440 --> 06:26.440]  thought.
[06:26.440 --> 06:30.560]  I've been on record predicting they'll surely take the House, probably even the Senate,
[06:30.560 --> 06:36.960]  because of the unbelievable outrage in this nation and the huge awakening that is taking
[06:36.960 --> 06:37.960]  place and happening.
[06:37.960 --> 06:41.800]  This isn't just, you know, people running from one party to the other.
[06:41.800 --> 06:47.600]  Every major political science research report and poll shows this is a complete political
[06:47.600 --> 06:52.640]  realignment, and the Republicans are all going to be out of office.
[06:52.640 --> 06:58.760]  Come the next election if they don't immediately deliver on constitutional change getting us
[06:58.760 --> 07:00.880]  back to our base values.
[07:00.880 --> 07:04.120]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[07:04.120 --> 07:08.160]  Some people say it sounds like a different radio talk show host when I was on Friday
[07:08.160 --> 07:11.440]  because I broadcast more than 25 hours straight.
[07:11.440 --> 07:15.800]  I'm sorry my voice is a little bit worn out and a bit deeper than normal, but it should
[07:15.800 --> 07:22.760]  be back to normal by tomorrow with a kickoff of the weekday transmission, 11 a.m. central
[07:22.760 --> 07:23.760]  time.
[07:23.760 --> 07:28.680]  Of course, the websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[07:28.680 --> 07:33.440]  I'm going to throw a question out for listeners here in just a moment, and normally the phones
[07:33.440 --> 07:37.480]  are just wide open for any issue you want to cover, but I specifically want to hear
[07:37.480 --> 07:42.720]  from listeners on several different topics I'm going to throw out, but first I'd like
[07:42.720 --> 07:49.400]  you to give me your take on the hypocrisy of government and double standards.
[07:49.400 --> 07:55.640]  I mean, how many case point examples are there of where mega corporations and government
[07:55.640 --> 08:01.400]  are basically living by a different set of rules than the population?
[08:01.400 --> 08:03.480]  A great example is Bernie Madoff.
[08:03.480 --> 08:09.960]  For 11 years, insiders sent full dossiers on his complete fraud to the Securities and
[08:09.960 --> 08:13.480]  Exchange Commission, and they actively covered up for him.
[08:13.480 --> 08:21.840]  For five years before the unraveling of Enron in 2001, detailed reports were sent to the
[08:21.840 --> 08:26.640]  SEC and others about the different things that Enron was doing, not just taking the
[08:26.640 --> 08:31.400]  profits out the back door and using it as a shell corporation and laundering hundreds
[08:31.400 --> 08:37.980]  of billions of dollars offshore, but of course Enron was caught in California in some cases
[08:37.980 --> 08:45.080]  making several billion dollars a day of illicit money by just lying and controlling the electricity
[08:45.080 --> 08:51.960]  exchange and claiming that prices were higher than they were by creating artificial scarcity.
[08:51.960 --> 08:57.240]  I saw one report where they stole three billion dollars in one day from several western states,
[08:57.240 --> 09:03.800]  including California, and the guy that then went on to be the Secretary of the Army, Mr.
[09:03.800 --> 09:08.000]  White, was the head of that exchange out there and he even gave members of the California
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.840]  legislature tours of their Energy Trading Computer Center and showed them fake trading
[09:14.840 --> 09:19.000]  going on and said, look, it's all real, see, that's why we're charging you more, just
[09:19.000 --> 09:20.880]  fake computer programs.
[09:20.880 --> 09:25.120]  This is an example of megacorporate corruption.
[09:25.120 --> 09:29.240]  And now we have the private Federal Reserve that took over our monetary system and has
[09:29.240 --> 09:33.360]  been enriching itself at the expense of the rest of the economy and engaged in unfair
[09:33.360 --> 09:38.800]  trade advantage against their competition, whether it's Main Street banks or corporations
[09:38.800 --> 09:43.440]  that aren't part of the Inside Good Old Boy Club.
[09:43.440 --> 09:48.520]  The Federal Reserve, according to Bloomberg, just in the last two years, has given itself
[09:48.520 --> 09:56.040]  more than $28 trillion and they tell Congress in clip after clip that I have in my film
[09:56.040 --> 10:00.920]  The Obama Deception and in Fall of the Republic, you can pull them up on C-SPAN archives or
[10:00.920 --> 10:07.160]  at YouTube, just type in Geithner or Paulson or Bernacke, refuses to tell Congress where
[10:07.160 --> 10:08.160]  the money went.
[10:08.160 --> 10:10.080]  But you've all seen those clips.
[10:10.080 --> 10:11.760]  Where did this $500 billion go?
[10:11.760 --> 10:13.040]  Where did this $2 trillion go?
[10:13.040 --> 10:15.000]  I'm not going to tell you.
[10:15.000 --> 10:16.520]  Well, but you have to.
[10:16.520 --> 10:17.520]  Congress controls that.
[10:17.520 --> 10:19.560]  No, no, read the Federal Reserve Act.
[10:19.560 --> 10:22.920]  We're now a fourth branch of government and we're private and we're not going to tell
[10:22.920 --> 10:23.920]  you.
[10:23.920 --> 10:33.600]  I'll never forget Congressman Stern out in Florida, he had Geithner before the House
[10:33.600 --> 10:39.680]  Making Committee and he said, at the same time, he also had Paulson on, the former Treasury
[10:39.680 --> 10:50.080]  Secretary last year, and he said to him, he said, where is the $800-plus billion in one
[10:50.080 --> 10:55.040]  particular mechanism they've gotten money from in the bailout?
[10:55.040 --> 10:59.160]  And Paulson wouldn't answer the question, Tiny Tim Geithner wouldn't answer it.
[10:59.160 --> 11:04.960]  And then Congressman Stern, this is in Fall of the Republic, Congressman Stern says, okay,
[11:04.960 --> 11:09.720]  who gave you the waiver, Paulson, to give bailout money to Goldman Sachs, hundreds of
[11:09.720 --> 11:14.760]  billions of dollars, to give bailout money to Goldman Sachs and then pay yourself $200-plus
[11:14.760 --> 11:17.960]  million in bonuses from that?
[11:17.960 --> 11:21.400]  And Geithner says, well, I don't manage that money anymore and they decided to pay it to
[11:21.400 --> 11:22.400]  me.
[11:22.400 --> 11:24.200]  And he said, no, who gave you the waiver?
[11:24.200 --> 11:28.480]  And then Stern read the law to him where somebody in government, especially the head
[11:28.480 --> 11:33.560]  of the Treasury Department, former head of Goldman Sachs, by the way, Henry Paulson,
[11:33.560 --> 11:38.720]  he said, there's a law against you giving yourself money that you ordered to be given
[11:38.720 --> 11:40.200]  to a private institution.
[11:40.200 --> 11:43.600]  And he said, well, I got that waiver from the Treasury Department.
[11:43.600 --> 11:46.640]  And he said, well, who gave you that waiver at the Treasury Department?
[11:46.640 --> 11:49.200]  And he said, well, I did.
[11:49.200 --> 11:52.920]  So it is the quintessential fox guarding the henhouse.
[11:52.920 --> 11:56.360]  So I want to throw this question out to you, you know, there's so many cases of where a
[11:56.360 --> 12:01.360]  private citizen or even a small company or even a mega company that isn't part of the
[12:01.360 --> 12:07.640]  inside baseball crew, part of the Boss Hog Club, you would go to prison in a minute.
[12:07.640 --> 12:11.320]  And there's also favored groups that help globalism along.
[12:11.320 --> 12:15.840]  You've got Republicans and Democrats in 800-plus sanctuary cities.
[12:15.840 --> 12:18.040]  Global aliens are allowed to not have IDs.
[12:18.040 --> 12:21.920]  They're allowed to get bank accounts without IDs or with the fake matricula cards.
[12:21.920 --> 12:25.400]  They're allowed to drunk drive, not get arrested for no insurance.
[12:25.400 --> 12:28.160]  They're basically left alone.
[12:28.160 --> 12:34.920]  And there's just so many cases of this, another set of double standards.
[12:34.920 --> 12:40.680]  You've got, of course, the situation with the drug companies and the federal government's
[12:40.680 --> 12:46.080]  admitted over 300,000 people die a year from bad drug interactions or bad drugs.
[12:46.080 --> 12:50.400]  They're constantly getting fined, but it's normally just a tiny fraction of the profits
[12:50.400 --> 12:54.320]  they made from it for putting drugs on the market that they know are going to kill people
[12:54.320 --> 12:55.320]  and don't work.
[12:55.320 --> 13:01.000]  I mean, how does, you know, major companies put out stuff like Gardasil, which doesn't
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.240]  protect you from the human papillomavirus that they say can cause a few cases a year
[13:05.240 --> 13:09.040]  of cervical cancer, but on the insert, it admits it doesn't protect you from it and
[13:09.040 --> 13:10.040]  it can kill you.
[13:10.040 --> 13:14.640]  I mean, how did the flu makers get away with the H1N1 shot last year when their own insert
[13:14.640 --> 13:19.760]  for it said Guillain-Barre, narcolepsy can cause convulsions?
[13:19.760 --> 13:22.160]  That's back in mainstream news today.
[13:22.160 --> 13:24.720]  Experts admit swine flu jab may cause deadly nerve disease.
[13:24.720 --> 13:28.960]  Well, I don't need the experts to tell me that in the mail newspaper.
[13:28.960 --> 13:30.680]  It's on the stinking insert.
[13:30.680 --> 13:35.040]  How do they get away with this?
[13:35.040 --> 13:40.480]  But then they've got SWAT teams shutting down family farms that are selling pumpkins and
[13:40.480 --> 13:44.600]  squash and tomatoes without some special federal license.
[13:44.600 --> 13:46.080]  How do they get away with that?
[13:46.080 --> 13:53.360]  How do they get away with the Bush White House ordering torture and having the John U. and
[13:53.360 --> 13:58.320]  Alberta Gonzalez Memos put out saying go ahead and torture people and say they could even
[13:58.320 --> 13:59.480]  torture children.
[13:59.480 --> 14:00.560]  That's on record.
[14:00.560 --> 14:06.360]  And then when the photos came out, everybody got upset by it, they prosecuted scores of
[14:06.360 --> 14:10.160]  military people, contractors and others that followed orders.
[14:10.160 --> 14:13.760]  I'm not saying that they shouldn't get in trouble, but how do they order them to do
[14:13.760 --> 14:15.120]  it?
[14:15.120 --> 14:21.160]  And then when they do it, they burn a few of them escape goats and the high-powered politicians
[14:21.160 --> 14:23.320]  that gave the orders, they don't get in trouble.
[14:23.320 --> 14:27.240]  And then three months ago Bush gave a TV interview and said, yeah, I ordered torture and I'd
[14:27.240 --> 14:28.240]  do it again.
[14:28.240 --> 14:31.040]  Well, then why did you send these people to prison?
[14:31.040 --> 14:33.160]  Because it was illegal what you did.
[14:33.160 --> 14:37.760]  But here he is out in the open saying, I'd order torture again, you can just search.
[14:37.760 --> 14:40.360]  Bush, I'd order waterboarding, I'd order torture again.
[14:40.360 --> 14:42.680]  TV interview, we've played it here.
[14:42.680 --> 14:46.440]  But whether you're for torture or not, whether you think it's great or not, obviously it's
[14:46.440 --> 14:48.900]  abhorrent, then it ends up happening to our troops.
[14:48.900 --> 14:50.960]  We lose the moral higher ground.
[14:50.960 --> 14:54.520]  All the major studies, even the CIA's own admit it doesn't give you good intel, but
[14:54.520 --> 14:59.680]  if you want fake confessions and to scare people, torture's good.
[14:59.680 --> 15:04.640]  But regardless of that, what's the double standard where John U, Alberta Gonzalez, George W.
[15:04.640 --> 15:08.800]  Bush ordered the torture, the Pentagon orders the torture, the brass orders the torture
[15:08.800 --> 15:14.040]  and they send some, I think the highest level person sent to prison was a sergeant and they
[15:14.040 --> 15:16.760]  got a couple years of slap on the wrist.
[15:16.760 --> 15:21.760]  So that's another case of double standards and the list just go on and on.
[15:21.760 --> 15:26.200]  I mean, here's an example, what's changed in our society that 19 years ago, the first
[15:26.200 --> 15:31.920]  time the military used a plated uranium on the battlefront in Desert Storm 1, that they
[15:31.920 --> 15:35.360]  told them they had to have decon contamination, it was very dangerous.
[15:35.360 --> 15:39.000]  Now they tell the troops, just use it, there's no health problems, they admit it's killing
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  them, but see, what's changed?
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.600]  Okay, I'm going to give you the number when we come back, get into the incredible situation
[15:45.600 --> 15:50.200]  with the mortgages and again, see, we told you so again, over 10 years ago, I've been
[15:50.200 --> 15:54.080]  talking about mortgage fraud and what this is going to do to the economy, we'll look
[15:54.080 --> 15:58.720]  at the elections coming up and a lot more, I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.TV, we're streaming
[15:58.720 --> 16:00.040]  live there.
[16:00.040 --> 16:04.680]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[16:04.680 --> 16:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.320]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[16:13.320 --> 16:18.400]  allows you to have, it's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[16:18.400 --> 16:20.360]  grid technology is coming.
[16:20.360 --> 16:24.680]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[16:24.680 --> 16:28.680]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[16:28.680 --> 16:32.160]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[16:32.160 --> 16:35.880]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[16:35.880 --> 16:40.640]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[16:40.640 --> 16:44.400]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[16:44.400 --> 16:45.800]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[16:45.800 --> 16:51.760]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[16:51.760 --> 17:00.160]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[17:00.160 --> 17:03.760]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[17:03.760 --> 17:05.960]  It ended on June of 2009.
[17:05.960 --> 17:09.480]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[17:09.480 --> 17:13.240]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest
[17:13.240 --> 17:15.400]  of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[17:15.400 --> 17:17.520]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[17:17.520 --> 17:20.640]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[17:20.640 --> 17:24.600]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider
[17:24.600 --> 17:27.120]  a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[17:27.120 --> 17:29.520]  They both make fabulous investments.
[17:29.520 --> 17:33.840]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial
[17:33.840 --> 17:34.840]  resource.
[17:34.840 --> 17:39.160]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks,
[17:39.160 --> 17:40.160]  or metals.
[17:40.160 --> 17:44.800]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long
[17:44.800 --> 17:45.800]  term.
[17:45.800 --> 17:48.480]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[17:48.480 --> 17:54.400]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet, or call 800-409-5633.
[17:54.400 --> 18:24.320]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[18:24.320 --> 18:41.480]  Image.
[18:41.480 --> 19:04.660]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with
[19:04.660 --> 19:09.260]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[19:09.260 --> 19:13.120]  of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[19:13.120 --> 19:15.800]  anywhere in or on the body.
[19:15.800 --> 19:20.560]  My name is Mario Sifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[19:20.560 --> 19:25.160]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[19:25.160 --> 19:29.800]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[19:29.800 --> 19:33.320]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[19:33.320 --> 19:41.200]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[19:41.200 --> 19:48.480]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com
[19:48.480 --> 19:51.600]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[19:51.600 --> 20:01.080]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[20:01.080 --> 20:08.080]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:31.080 --> 20:37.840]  Just a programmed up before I get into all the news and give out the toll free number.
[20:37.840 --> 20:43.200]  We had Lou Dobbs on for about 30 minutes, George Norion for about 30 minutes.
[20:43.200 --> 20:47.480]  We had Gerald Salente for almost two hours, Max Kaiser.
[20:47.480 --> 20:52.880]  We had Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of the policy of the Department of the Treasury,
[20:52.880 --> 20:56.400]  former Wall Street Journal editor.
[20:56.400 --> 21:05.120]  We had at least 10 other huge guests in my 27-hour live transmission Thursday into Friday.
[21:05.120 --> 21:09.080]  From the start of Thursday's radio show to the end of Friday's radio show, and that's
[21:09.080 --> 21:14.320]  all archived, not just the audio, the video, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[21:14.320 --> 21:19.280]  The entire marathon is there.
[21:19.280 --> 21:23.080]  And we're also streaming right now in video living color for radio listeners that want
[21:23.080 --> 21:25.280]  to go check it out at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[21:25.280 --> 21:28.560]  This live radio show, slash TV show, is streaming there right now.
[21:28.560 --> 21:34.720]  Okay, so I'm throwing the phone number out specifically on examples that you've seen
[21:34.720 --> 21:41.240]  of mega corporations and government, also local government, being above the law.
[21:41.240 --> 21:43.080]  And that's what globalism is.
[21:43.080 --> 21:48.680]  It's the Fortune 100 setting up a world government to set up socialism at the national level,
[21:48.680 --> 21:53.440]  to conduit all of the general public's money, and the middle class's money, into a giant
[21:53.440 --> 21:57.040]  trough that they can suck out of to offshore.
[21:57.040 --> 22:01.000]  And they engineer the banking collapse, as they've done in every other third world nation.
[22:01.000 --> 22:02.200]  Now they're doing it here.
[22:02.200 --> 22:04.800]  We got the IMF World Bank documents in 2002.
[22:04.800 --> 22:08.680]  I've been warning you for eight years specifically what would happen when the derivatives bubble
[22:08.680 --> 22:09.680]  popped.
[22:09.680 --> 22:13.560]  And then their answer, holding as hostage as, give us unlimited money.
[22:13.560 --> 22:15.200]  We won't tell Congress where it went.
[22:15.200 --> 22:18.640]  This is happening not just in the U.S., but every other major nation, from Australia to
[22:18.640 --> 22:25.240]  Germany, from Canada to England, from Portugal to Greece, from Argentina to Zimbabwe.
[22:25.240 --> 22:29.200]  They say, you give us more money, and don't ask where it went, or we'll cause a total
[22:29.200 --> 22:30.200]  depression.
[22:30.200 --> 22:35.440]  And then you give them tens of trillions of dollars, and here we are now two years later.
[22:35.440 --> 22:41.640]  That's right, coming up on, well, it was October 3rd that they passed the bank or bailout takeover
[22:41.640 --> 22:45.760]  and gave them total anonymity and secrecy, so I guess it's more than two years, man
[22:45.760 --> 22:46.760]  time's flying.
[22:46.760 --> 22:50.600]  I keep saying a year and a half ago, that was two years ago now.
[22:50.600 --> 22:54.880]  And they passed this new Banking Regulation Act a few months ago, giving the Federal Reserve
[22:54.880 --> 22:56.640]  more secrecy, more power.
[22:56.640 --> 23:01.640]  The SEC embarrassed by protecting Madoff and Kinley in the last 10 years, they get even
[23:01.640 --> 23:02.640]  more secrecy.
[23:02.640 --> 23:05.320]  In fact, search that term, folks won't believe it.
[23:05.320 --> 23:16.080]  It's CNBC, also Fox News, SEC giving more anonymity, secrecy by financial re-regulation
[23:16.080 --> 23:17.980]  bill.
[23:17.980 --> 23:20.360]  So that's got to be good for these crooks.
[23:20.360 --> 23:25.680]  You've got a revolving door from the big megabanks, the six megabanks and brokerage houses, into
[23:25.680 --> 23:33.760]  every SEC and Federal Reserve and Treasury position, just like the former head of Monsanto
[23:33.760 --> 23:39.600]  is now the head of the FDA approval process, and of course they're approving all these
[23:39.600 --> 23:43.520]  cross species things like salmon that's part insect and eel.
[23:43.520 --> 23:48.480]  And saying, not only is it approved, you can't even know if it's GMO.
[23:48.480 --> 23:51.000]  You're not even allowed to know that.
[23:51.000 --> 23:56.680]  This is the magnitude of the double standard, none of us are safe.
[23:56.680 --> 24:01.000]  This is why third world countries can't produce, because they get a corrupt elite in that don't
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.240]  play by the same rules and they just rob everybody.
[24:04.240 --> 24:09.400]  This is what's happened thousands of times in the last 6,000 years on this planet since
[24:09.400 --> 24:11.320]  we had civilization.
[24:11.320 --> 24:12.840]  Anyone who studied history knows it.
[24:12.840 --> 24:18.080]  So I want to hear from you about other examples of double standards or double standards that
[24:18.080 --> 24:21.720]  I've raised, and how do we deal with this hypocrisy?
[24:21.720 --> 24:25.520]  When special interests own both parties, how do we get real change?
[24:25.520 --> 24:35.800]  Will we go the way of Argentina, of Nigeria, of Greece, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[24:35.800 --> 24:42.320]  I want to hear from you specifically on this live Sunday broadcast with examples of hypocrisy
[24:42.320 --> 24:47.320]  and how you think we counter it, 888-201-2244.
[24:47.320 --> 24:51.560]  Now, remember, we've been writing about this for 10 years.
[24:51.560 --> 24:57.960]  You can just search the term mortgage fraud, infowars.com, you'll get 10-year-old articles.
[24:57.960 --> 25:01.640]  You'll see YouTube video interviews 6 years ago we did.
[25:01.640 --> 25:08.440]  I mean, it's everywhere, because we learned about mirrors and all these computerized systems
[25:08.440 --> 25:12.600]  they've got where they don't have deeds, they don't have title companies check anything,
[25:12.600 --> 25:19.800]  the big banks dump millions of mortgages into big pools and then sell those as derivatives
[25:19.800 --> 25:20.800]  and leverage them.
[25:20.800 --> 25:24.840]  They sell them to the Chinese, they sell them to the Europeans, they sell them to US pension
[25:24.840 --> 25:25.840]  funds.
[25:25.840 --> 25:29.520]  Now, the pension funds, many of them are in solvent or in trouble because they invested
[25:29.520 --> 25:30.720]  in these.
[25:30.720 --> 25:31.720]  And what's the answer?
[25:31.720 --> 25:36.040]  Oh, the federal government's going to take over the pension funds, that's CNBC, to save
[25:36.040 --> 25:40.360]  them of course, just like the Baker bailout was to save us, everything's to save us.
[25:40.360 --> 25:45.040]  The Iraq war was to save us from WMDs, the global warming taxes are to save us from rising
[25:45.040 --> 25:46.880]  sea levels, doesn't exist.
[25:46.880 --> 25:50.320]  They're always going to save us, save the children, you know, give up your rights, save
[25:50.320 --> 25:53.640]  you from al-Qaeda, we're going to put you through naked body scanners and track everything
[25:53.640 --> 25:58.120]  you do and 95% of Homeland Security's targeting conservatives and libertarians and gun owners
[25:58.120 --> 26:01.400]  and returning veterans, but still it's for al-Qaeda because if you don't give your rights
[26:01.400 --> 26:04.840]  up and live in a police state, they're going to get you.
[26:04.840 --> 26:10.320]  This is the problem reaction solution system they've got us under.
[26:10.320 --> 26:15.600]  And so they hold us hostage and now they're saying, as we predicted several years ago,
[26:15.600 --> 26:19.480]  we told you the Baker bailout was just the beginning, oh, guess what, we didn't use any
[26:19.480 --> 26:23.160]  of the bailout money to fix the mortgages and guess what, it's not just people that
[26:23.160 --> 26:27.120]  can't pay their mortgages and then the bank can't produce the note or the paperwork in
[26:27.120 --> 26:32.320]  court because it's been sold five, 10, 15, 20 times down the road, no, it's all over
[26:32.320 --> 26:33.320]  even CNN.
[26:33.320 --> 26:38.120]  You can search, CNN report, paid for home taken.
[26:38.120 --> 26:42.400]  You can search the term we showed it to you last week, JPMorgan Chase takes home they
[26:42.400 --> 26:46.600]  didn't own, Goldman Sachs takes home they didn't own, just put it into a search engine,
[26:46.600 --> 26:50.760]  you'll get mainstream news and they go, oh, how do we fix this problem?
[26:50.760 --> 26:56.200]  Oh, well, Congress is going to go back retroactively and make it legal so they can come take your
[26:56.200 --> 26:59.640]  house they never had a note to and that you've paid for.
[26:59.640 --> 27:04.920]  See, see, sure, there's some fools who went out and got mortgages with no job and tried
[27:04.920 --> 27:08.960]  to flip houses and all that, they're in the bubble of the last 10 years, but we're not
[27:08.960 --> 27:10.320]  even talking about that.
[27:10.320 --> 27:12.800]  We're talking about rule of law.
[27:12.800 --> 27:18.080]  We're talking about basic issues of sanity and coming up on Wednesday, on the Wednesday
[27:18.080 --> 27:20.400]  weekday show, I'm going to do three hours on this.
[27:20.400 --> 27:25.880]  We have a leading expert in studio with us, but in case you're thinking, this is just
[27:25.880 --> 27:32.600]  Alex Jones saying all this, here's CNBC, CNBC predicts Congress will retroactively legalize
[27:32.600 --> 27:34.400]  foreclosure fraud.
[27:34.400 --> 27:36.920]  What was the BBC headline last week?
[27:36.920 --> 27:44.280]  Obama says he will do nothing about mortgage fraud, put that up on screen, Obama, BBC.
[27:44.280 --> 27:47.640]  Obama will do nothing to stop mortgage fraud.
[27:47.640 --> 27:51.600]  Congress will pass a bill to forgive banks, potentially criminal errors, potentially
[27:51.600 --> 27:58.440]  made in foreclosure proceedings, a senior CNBC editor predicts, hold on a minute.
[27:58.440 --> 27:59.920]  These aren't potential frauds.
[27:59.920 --> 28:03.280]  It is a fraud when you don't have the deed of the paperwork.
[28:03.280 --> 28:05.600]  I mean, here's a microcosm example.
[28:05.600 --> 28:10.520]  A week ago, Bank of America stopped all foreclosures in the United States because they're losing
[28:10.520 --> 28:11.520]  in court.
[28:11.520 --> 28:12.640]  Their stocks plunged.
[28:12.640 --> 28:17.320]  I bought my first house nine, 10 years ago and they sold my mortgage over and over again
[28:17.320 --> 28:20.720]  and then the owner of my mortgage was Bank of America and they sent me a letter saying
[28:20.720 --> 28:21.720]  we're going to foreclose.
[28:21.720 --> 28:25.120]  You didn't pay the escrow and I went to the title company and had the records I'd paid
[28:25.120 --> 28:26.120]  for it.
[28:26.120 --> 28:28.680]  I remember paying the money and I had to have a lawyer threaten to sue them and they backed
[28:28.680 --> 28:29.680]  off.
[28:29.680 --> 28:35.200]  But the average guy who's a janitor or an auto parts store clerk, they're good people,
[28:35.200 --> 28:37.860]  they're intelligent, but they don't know how to stand up for themselves.
[28:37.860 --> 28:40.520]  They lose their house and go, I don't know why this happened.
[28:40.520 --> 28:44.440]  When we come back, I'm going to walk through what this means and now they're holding us
[28:44.440 --> 28:45.440]  hostage again.
[28:45.440 --> 28:50.840]  Let us take people's houses we don't even own that we don't even own.
[28:50.840 --> 28:55.040]  Let us take paid for houses or we'll bring the whole economy down and the Congress is
[28:55.040 --> 28:58.440]  saying, okay, we're going to pass the bill, you can take any house you want.
[28:58.440 --> 29:01.800]  They go, that's more like it.
[29:01.800 --> 29:05.560]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[29:05.560 --> 29:08.680]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[29:08.680 --> 29:13.040]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[29:13.040 --> 29:14.040]  at home.
[29:14.040 --> 29:18.720]  They've turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[29:18.720 --> 29:19.720]  calling the shots.
[29:19.720 --> 29:25.120]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[29:25.120 --> 29:30.800]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
[29:30.800 --> 29:35.200]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[29:35.200 --> 29:39.560]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[29:39.560 --> 29:41.720]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[29:41.720 --> 29:47.640]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[29:47.640 --> 29:48.960]  of the Republic.

[30:00.040 --> 30:04.680]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[30:04.680 --> 30:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[30:09.000 --> 30:13.360]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[30:13.360 --> 30:14.680]  allows you to have.
[30:14.680 --> 30:20.400]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[30:20.400 --> 30:24.720]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[30:24.720 --> 30:28.720]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[30:28.720 --> 30:32.200]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[30:32.200 --> 30:35.920]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[30:35.920 --> 30:40.600]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[30:40.600 --> 30:44.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[30:44.440 --> 30:45.840]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[33:01.040 --> 33:04.840]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[33:04.840 --> 33:33.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:34.840 --> 33:56.280]  I'm going to finish up with this news in the next segment and go to your calls in the segment
[33:56.280 --> 33:57.280]  after.
[33:57.280 --> 34:03.040]  Then later next hour, I'm getting into medical news, financial news, it's all off the charts.
[34:03.040 --> 34:04.680]  It's so important.
[34:04.680 --> 34:07.920]  But I want to quantify this very simply.
[34:07.920 --> 34:11.360]  So when you're talking to your friends and family, trying to explain this to them.
[34:11.360 --> 34:17.840]  The United States geographically is, compared to many other nations like Mexico that conservatively
[34:17.840 --> 34:23.160]  has tripled the resources that we do, we are mineral poor.
[34:23.160 --> 34:28.800]  But because we had the Puritans who weren't perfect by any stretch but were the best in
[34:28.800 --> 34:34.040]  any age of human society when it came to being anti-corruption, they were still corrupt.
[34:34.040 --> 34:37.000]  And compared to others, they were not.
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.840]  Because of that idea of private property and due process and nobodies above the law, that
[34:42.840 --> 34:53.000]  idea because of corruption of the crown and the George III's governors and agents led
[34:53.000 --> 34:59.120]  to the Revolutionary War and what became the flower or the tail end of the Renaissance,
[34:59.120 --> 35:01.120]  our nation being founded.
[35:01.120 --> 35:05.640]  And then the United States was the example for the world, not cheating, not stealing,
[35:05.640 --> 35:11.520]  not torturing, private property being honored, wealthy people being judged the same as poor
[35:11.520 --> 35:12.520]  people.
[35:12.520 --> 35:17.080]  And again, it wasn't perfect, but as experiments go, the best we'd ever seen.
[35:17.080 --> 35:25.320]  And so 5% of the world's population had more money by 1950 and more wealth and more inventions
[35:25.320 --> 35:32.160]  and more patents and more ideas and more explorers and more scientists, everything.
[35:32.160 --> 35:39.440]  5% had more money and inventions and ideas and were more ruggedly individualistic than
[35:39.440 --> 35:42.640]  95% of the world.
[35:42.640 --> 35:46.200]  Highest test scores, toughest in battle.
[35:46.200 --> 35:48.960]  I mean, the whole world marveled.
[35:48.960 --> 35:54.960]  Alexander de Tocqueville after the Revolutionary War in the 1790s came here and marveled at
[35:54.960 --> 35:56.560]  how free we were.
[35:56.560 --> 36:02.440]  Marvel did how corrupt local officials went to jail or worse.
[36:02.440 --> 36:07.360]  Marvel did what a polite society we had because if you badmouth and talk somebody down, they'd
[36:07.360 --> 36:10.720]  call you out in the street and go, it's time to have a duel.
[36:10.720 --> 36:15.400]  What do you think duels were when you see old Westerns from the 1860s or 70s, you know,
[36:15.400 --> 36:17.200]  and the guys are all meet you outside?
[36:17.200 --> 36:19.800]  That's a, that was the tail end of dueling.
[36:19.800 --> 36:25.560]  People were real and they didn't put up with scallywags and carpetbaggers and corruption
[36:25.560 --> 36:28.480]  and this country became fabulously wealthy.
[36:28.480 --> 36:32.600]  So all the corrupt forces came in, the robber barons took over by 1900.
[36:32.600 --> 36:36.960]  They set up the Federal Reserve in 1913 and they've used our wealth and our power and
[36:36.960 --> 36:41.640]  our military to build their world government at our expense and the United States gets
[36:41.640 --> 36:47.040]  blamed for all the evils and all the ills of that corrupt globalist government.
[36:47.040 --> 36:50.520]  Now that in a nutshell is the bottom line.
[36:50.520 --> 36:53.480]  Why can't Mexico, you know, get itself together?
[36:53.480 --> 36:55.640]  Because they have more billionaires than the United States.
[36:55.640 --> 36:59.840]  They have a tiny elite and a giant poor mass of people and the government uses corruption
[36:59.840 --> 37:04.480]  to control them and they use poverty as a tool to dominate so people can never get control
[37:04.480 --> 37:06.400]  of their lives.
[37:06.400 --> 37:10.120]  It's very simple, same thing with North Korea, same thing with Eastern Europe, same thing
[37:10.120 --> 37:13.840]  with Africa, same thing with the rest of Latin America and Americans like to make fun of
[37:13.840 --> 37:18.040]  Latin Americans, oh, look at them, they can get themselves together or Africans or poorer
[37:18.040 --> 37:19.040]  areas of Asia.
[37:19.040 --> 37:24.800]  Well, we're going to be the same now because in all those nations, corrupt individuals
[37:24.800 --> 37:30.400]  and corrupt organizations that are part of the insider group, they get away with murder.
[37:30.400 --> 37:33.480]  And that's my question for listeners coming up after the break.
[37:33.480 --> 37:39.320]  A, what are your best examples of the double standards, the hypocrisy and B, how do we counter
[37:39.320 --> 37:40.320]  this?
[37:40.320 --> 37:41.320]  How do we respond to it?
[37:41.320 --> 37:47.640]  Now, what a ridiculous headline though from CNBC.
[37:47.640 --> 37:51.600]  Congress will pass a bill to forgive banks to potentially criminal errors made in foreclosure
[37:51.600 --> 37:52.600]  proceedings.
[37:52.600 --> 37:57.920]  A senior CNBC editor predicts they passed that bill two weeks ago, what do you mean?
[37:57.920 --> 37:59.360]  He predicts.
[37:59.360 --> 38:06.040]  It's like predicting at 4.38 p.m. central that the sun came up at 7 a.m. this morning.
[38:06.040 --> 38:08.400]  I know it came up, I saw it come up.
[38:08.400 --> 38:16.960]  If I predict that the sun came up, you know, 10 hours later, it's ridiculous.
[38:16.960 --> 38:23.160]  They already passed the bill, but Obama, because of the political Harry Carey, the political
[38:23.160 --> 38:31.320]  Sheppecu, the political suicide, the political burning down his own house, pocket vetoed
[38:31.320 --> 38:32.320]  it.
[38:32.320 --> 38:34.800]  He didn't kill it entirely, so they have to repass it.
[38:34.800 --> 38:39.280]  He said, I'm going to sign that after the election.
[38:39.280 --> 38:44.160]  And when that lame duck comes in after November, in late November, when that lame duck Congress
[38:44.160 --> 38:49.640]  comes back in, you better believe Barack Hussein Obama is going to sign it, and it's
[38:49.640 --> 38:51.560]  got Republican backing as well.
[38:51.560 --> 38:57.160]  Now, we as citizens better make this a big issue, because the media is spinning it.
[38:57.160 --> 39:05.760]  While the Bank of America had 8,001-week computerized robo-signings, they're hiring
[39:05.760 --> 39:12.120]  literal former Walmart greeters, that's in one report, to be experts, that's their scapegoats.
[39:12.120 --> 39:15.800]  We'll go to prison later, and then the head bankers will go, we didn't know this was happening,
[39:15.800 --> 39:21.200]  to sit there and, in some cases, sign 8,000 forms individually.
[39:21.200 --> 39:24.920]  They're so busy, they just have a computer sign it with their name on it.
[39:24.920 --> 39:30.320]  So they're spinning it, that, oh, well, people really are being foreclosed on, 100,000 record
[39:30.320 --> 39:35.400]  level in the last month, but, you know, these people still deserve to have their houses
[39:35.400 --> 39:36.400]  taken.
[39:36.400 --> 39:41.720]  No, in thousands of cases, you'll have multiple banks trying to foreclose on the same house,
[39:41.720 --> 39:46.080]  because they're all holding the same derivative paper, sold to them by J.P. Morgan Chase,
[39:46.080 --> 39:52.520]  Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citibank, and others, but that's the big five,
[39:52.520 --> 39:56.840]  big six total, got the Bank of England involved, Buddhist Bank of Germany involved, I guess
[39:56.840 --> 40:01.040]  that's seven, you want to count them, and the Chinese are mad right now, they're trying
[40:01.040 --> 40:06.960]  to get these houses and they can, because the scam didn't just stop, the scam originated
[40:06.960 --> 40:10.480]  with giving people mortgages that couldn't pay them, but then they took them and packaged
[40:10.480 --> 40:13.960]  them and sold them over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[40:13.960 --> 40:18.320]  and over and over again, and it's all over the news, they're taking houses that were
[40:18.320 --> 40:20.200]  paid off a decade ago.
[40:20.200 --> 40:23.680]  Now, if they get away with this, what are they going to do next?
[40:23.680 --> 40:28.400]  And it's the same MO, this will destroy all confidence if you don't let us foreclose
[40:28.400 --> 40:35.280]  on these millions of houses, and so Congress, and that's the law states, pass that law saying
[40:35.280 --> 40:40.000]  we can just take any house we want with no paperwork, no deed, no nothing, and Congress
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.680]  two weeks ago said, yes sir, bankers, yes sir, you're our biggest financiers, feeding off
[40:45.680 --> 40:51.040]  our free market, destroying it, yes sir, you can have everything.
[40:51.040 --> 40:58.840]  And Obama went, whoa, I'm going to sign this after the election.
[40:58.840 --> 41:01.360]  So you got that report.
[41:01.360 --> 41:05.840]  Here's another one, sorry folks, the put back apocalypse ain't going to happen, that's
[41:05.840 --> 41:09.840]  another report out of CNBC, here's another one by Curt Nemo that really breaks it down
[41:09.840 --> 41:15.840]  at infowars.com, Obama Goldman Sachs Administration, because that's basically the White House's
[41:15.840 --> 41:21.520]  Goldman Sachs office, sides with banks on foreclosure moratorium, not going to happen
[41:21.520 --> 41:24.120]  as a national move.
[41:24.120 --> 41:30.520]  Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is saying, and Reuters and the Wall Street Journal, that
[41:30.520 --> 41:35.480]  the way they're going to fix the tens of trillions of dollars in the deficit, the way
[41:35.480 --> 41:39.320]  they're going to fix all these problems is they're going to inflate the currency, they've
[41:39.320 --> 41:44.080]  already been inflating it slowly, and in the aggregate it's been huge, but now they're
[41:44.080 --> 41:50.840]  having global concerted, coordinated G20 devaluation occurrences, so for those of you that have
[41:50.840 --> 41:58.560]  saved, that's going to basically be a extra judicial or extra legislative tax.
[41:58.560 --> 42:06.280]  So and that's why gold's going up to a record of $1384.
[42:06.280 --> 42:11.720]  Gold didn't go up, ladies and gentlemen, the dollar went down.
[42:11.720 --> 42:18.080]  Continuing, Japan goes from dynamic to disheartened New York Times, they've been in a recession
[42:18.080 --> 42:22.280]  for more than 20 years, they've got one of the hardest working, smartest populations
[42:22.280 --> 42:26.200]  in the world, I've seen the statistics of Japanese working even longer hours, on average
[42:26.200 --> 42:31.000]  about 17 hours, putting out the best products in the world, and they're literally going
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.000]  bankrupt, because they let private bankers come in and take them over.
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.880]  It's a debt black hole.
[42:36.880 --> 42:41.680]  We've got a key article, deliberately engineered economic collapse in USA, leading to martial
[42:41.680 --> 42:48.000]  law, oh yeah, that's the next thing I want to hit in the second hour if I take calls.
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.440]  They've got newscasts and the Army Times is reporting, don't worry, things are collapsing,
[42:52.440 --> 42:57.240]  but the Army's got a plan, we're going to have troops take over America, in case Americans
[42:57.240 --> 43:00.600]  get angry and demonstrate.
[43:00.600 --> 43:04.200]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[43:04.200 --> 43:06.360]  It ended on June of 2009.
[43:06.360 --> 43:11.160]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree, perhaps the recession ended
[43:11.160 --> 43:14.800]  for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be
[43:14.800 --> 43:15.800]  getting worse.
[43:15.800 --> 43:20.080]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either, they've begun their long expected journey
[43:20.080 --> 43:21.080]  to the moon.
[43:21.080 --> 43:24.960]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider
[43:24.960 --> 43:29.880]  a food savings account from eFoodsDirect, they both make fabulous investments.
[43:29.880 --> 43:34.120]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial
[43:34.120 --> 43:35.120]  resource.
[43:35.120 --> 43:39.520]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks,
[43:39.520 --> 43:40.520]  or metals.
[43:40.520 --> 43:45.160]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long
[43:45.160 --> 43:46.160]  term.
[43:46.160 --> 43:49.080]  This will freeze the cost to your food while you can still afford it.
[43:49.080 --> 43:56.400]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633, that's eFoodsDirect.com
[43:56.400 --> 43:59.400]  or 800-409-5633.
[43:59.400 --> 44:07.160]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[44:07.160 --> 44:11.760]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[44:11.760 --> 44:20.920]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[44:20.920 --> 44:30.040]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit, they put a diamond
[44:30.040 --> 44:39.080]  gusset in the crotch where you need it most, blue diamond gussets got it, other stone.
[44:39.080 --> 44:45.880]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[44:45.880 --> 44:50.440]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can
[44:50.440 --> 44:52.600]  ride all day with confidence.
[44:52.600 --> 44:59.680]  Order yours at gusset.com, diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[44:59.680 --> 45:04.320]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[45:04.320 --> 45:08.640]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[45:08.640 --> 45:12.960]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[45:12.960 --> 45:14.280]  allows you to have.
[45:14.280 --> 45:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[45:20.000 --> 45:24.320]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[45:24.320 --> 45:28.320]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[45:28.320 --> 45:31.800]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[45:31.800 --> 45:35.520]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[45:35.520 --> 45:40.240]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[45:40.240 --> 45:44.040]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[45:44.040 --> 45:45.440]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[45:45.440 --> 45:51.280]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.

[45:59.560 --> 46:01.000]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[46:01.000 --> 46:04.640]  You've heard me talk about Calvin five star soaps for years.
[46:04.640 --> 46:08.920]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find
[46:08.920 --> 46:09.920]  in stores.

[46:28.000 --> 46:30.040]  dirt and gentle on the environment.
[46:30.040 --> 46:33.200]  Buy American and stay clean, as well as support info wars.

[46:57.760 --> 47:17.040]  Thank you.
[47:17.040 --> 47:25.600]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance,
[47:25.600 --> 47:32.280]  rallying Patriots worldwide.
[47:32.280 --> 47:39.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:39.960 --> 47:42.920]  The moral of the story is simple and timeless.
[47:42.920 --> 47:45.920]  Every generation has gone through it.
[47:45.920 --> 47:51.360]  If you throw caution to the wind, aren't involved in politics and history and society, corrupt
[47:51.360 --> 47:56.280]  interests will come into your country and you will wake up homeless on the continent
[47:56.280 --> 47:59.760]  your forefathers conquer.
[47:59.760 --> 48:04.600]  As Thomas Jefferson said, coming up next hour after a bunch of calls, government trains
[48:04.600 --> 48:10.040]  troops to run American cities and I was driving to work Thursday morning and heard local talk
[48:10.040 --> 48:15.280]  radio 590 AM reading my article and I actually read the article.
[48:15.280 --> 48:19.320]  They said, look, it's all sourced, Army times, all these.
[48:19.320 --> 48:24.080]  And then they opened the phones up and I'd say, it was the Todd and Don show.
[48:24.080 --> 48:28.600]  I'd say out of 30 calls, I heard them take 70% were like, this is wrong.
[48:28.600 --> 48:29.960]  It's wrong to have the military involved.
[48:29.960 --> 48:34.080]  But then I heard military people calling in going, we are training for door to door.
[48:34.080 --> 48:36.120]  We are trained to lock down America.
[48:36.120 --> 48:38.120]  If things get tough, we're going to be needed.
[48:38.120 --> 48:41.080]  They were being trained decades ago for this takeover.
[48:41.080 --> 48:44.280]  This was set up decades ago.
[48:44.280 --> 48:45.280]  Okay.
[48:45.280 --> 48:46.960]  Our government isn't run by us.
[48:46.960 --> 48:52.080]  It's run by offshore banks and they shouldn't use our military to suppress us like some
[48:52.080 --> 48:53.200]  third world nation.
[48:53.200 --> 48:54.200]  It's very simple.
[48:54.200 --> 48:57.920]  But all of you that worship authority and worship whatever the government that says
[48:57.920 --> 49:02.080]  and think you're little toadies of the system, get ready.
[49:02.080 --> 49:03.080]  There is no one of you.
[49:03.080 --> 49:07.560]  I don't care if you're worth $10 million who these people won't rob blind.
[49:07.560 --> 49:10.760]  And the compartmentalized military, they're not going to know the back story.
[49:10.760 --> 49:14.440]  And we know the military is trying to take your guns.
[49:14.440 --> 49:16.880]  Don't forget what happened in New Orleans and Katrina.
[49:16.880 --> 49:17.880]  But that's coming up.
[49:17.880 --> 49:24.040]  I know we have 12 phone callers or 13 phone callers now online.
[49:24.040 --> 49:26.320]  And so I want to try to go to these as quickly as possible.
[49:26.320 --> 49:27.720]  You've heard the question I've thrown out.
[49:27.720 --> 49:32.200]  What are examples of government hypocrisy for you where the government and major corporations
[49:32.200 --> 49:33.600]  live by one rule.
[49:33.600 --> 49:35.600]  We the citizens live by another.
[49:35.600 --> 49:38.120]  We'll go to Sharon in North Carolina.
[49:38.120 --> 49:40.120]  You're on the air Sharon.
[49:40.120 --> 49:41.120]  Hi, Alex.
[49:41.120 --> 49:42.120]  Yes.
[49:42.120 --> 49:43.120]  God bless you.
[49:43.120 --> 49:45.120]  God bless you and your staff.
[49:45.120 --> 49:46.760]  Well, God bless you.
[49:46.760 --> 49:47.760]  That's on your mind, Sharon.
[49:47.760 --> 49:51.360]  We pray for your safety and we pray for the work you're doing.
[49:51.360 --> 49:53.440]  Listen, I'm a little overwhelmed.
[49:53.440 --> 50:00.360]  I just spoke up about two months ago to everything and I'm as a Christian, I'm thinking, you
[50:00.360 --> 50:07.960]  know, the evilness of this world and Ephesians 612 and you spoke to that at one point about
[50:07.960 --> 50:08.960]  the mark of the beast.
[50:08.960 --> 50:11.480]  Could you say something about that again that I missed?
[50:11.480 --> 50:12.480]  Sure, Sharon.
[50:12.480 --> 50:13.480]  I appreciate your call.
[50:13.480 --> 50:19.440]  I mean, I have a secular radio broadcast that covers the news, but clearly school children
[50:19.440 --> 50:25.160]  nationwide thumb scanning to get their school lunches, face scanning to check into school,
[50:25.160 --> 50:28.040]  cashless society, governments trying to get rid of cash.
[50:28.040 --> 50:31.200]  Even if you're not a Christian and I am a Christian and don't believe in the devil in
[50:31.200 --> 50:33.760]  all this, it might as well be the devil.
[50:33.760 --> 50:36.560]  That's what this is being used for is to control us.
[50:36.560 --> 50:42.600]  And we know the powers of this planet are a bunch of wicked out of control people, ruthless.
[50:42.600 --> 50:44.240]  No one can deny that.
[50:44.240 --> 50:48.360]  Now I got 12 other callers here that didn't say they agree or disagree, but I do like
[50:48.360 --> 50:50.280]  to go to folks that disagree first.
[50:50.280 --> 50:52.080]  Ray and Indiana, you disagree.
[50:52.080 --> 50:53.080]  Go ahead.
[50:53.080 --> 50:54.080]  Hey, Alex.
[50:54.080 --> 50:55.080]  Go ahead.
[50:55.080 --> 50:56.080]  Hey, thanks for waking me up.
[50:56.080 --> 50:59.080]  I've been working up about three years.
[50:59.080 --> 51:10.720]  I disagree in the fact that these people are, let's see here, they're not above the law.
[51:10.720 --> 51:12.640]  They have a gun to their head.
[51:12.640 --> 51:18.400]  The bad ones are complicit, but the good ones have a gun to their head.
[51:18.400 --> 51:19.400]  Well you know what?
[51:19.400 --> 51:23.120]  I mean, I've had a gun to my head in this fight and I've done the right thing.
[51:23.120 --> 51:26.640]  People saying I'm just following orders, hold on a minute, hold on, I'm going to answer
[51:26.640 --> 51:29.760]  your question or I'm going to make a statement about your statement.
[51:29.760 --> 51:35.160]  In Nuremberg, thousands of Nazis went before the tribunal and said I was following orders.
[51:35.160 --> 51:36.600]  That didn't cut it.
[51:36.600 --> 51:43.840]  And so for all these bureaucrats and police and bankers and CEOs and the rest of them,
[51:43.840 --> 51:46.280]  you're saying a gun to their head.
[51:46.280 --> 51:53.000]  I'm simply stating here that mortgages were sold to create the derivative fraud.
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.440]  The banks that sold it knew it was a fraud.
[51:55.440 --> 51:56.640]  They don't have the deeds.
[51:56.640 --> 51:58.680]  They're engaged in criminal activity.
[51:58.680 --> 52:04.160]  Our country's going the way of a third world nation because we haven't stood up to this
[52:04.160 --> 52:05.160]  corruption.
[52:05.160 --> 52:08.240]  It's not how to because it couldn't happen here, people thought.
[52:08.240 --> 52:10.440]  But I mean specifically, what do you disagree with?
[52:10.440 --> 52:12.800]  Well, let me ask you this.
[52:12.800 --> 52:17.280]  What would you do if you had a gun held to your head and a gun to your family's head?
[52:17.280 --> 52:18.600]  You would be complicit, I think.
[52:18.600 --> 52:19.760]  But I mean, what are you talking about?
[52:19.760 --> 52:21.760]  I mean, specific cases.
[52:21.760 --> 52:25.000]  I'm talking about a country going to hell in a handbasket and you're saying what do
[52:25.000 --> 52:26.720]  you do if you have a gun to your head?
[52:26.720 --> 52:28.560]  The bankers have got a gun to our head.
[52:28.560 --> 52:30.320]  They're devaluing the currency.
[52:30.320 --> 52:31.480]  They're destroying the jobs.
[52:31.480 --> 52:33.080]  They shipped them out with NAFTA and GATT.
[52:33.080 --> 52:36.200]  I appreciate your call, but I don't understand you.
[52:36.200 --> 52:38.560]  We have the gun to our head.
[52:38.560 --> 52:42.240]  The mind game is go along with the corruption because you can't help it.
[52:42.240 --> 52:46.520]  If you go along with the corruption, that's the road to ruin.
[52:46.520 --> 52:47.840]  That's the point I'm making.
[52:47.840 --> 52:52.840]  We've got to get up on our hind legs and see ourselves as people involved in a fight
[52:52.840 --> 52:56.320]  for liberty, not just spectators.
[52:56.320 --> 52:59.000]  Tim in Washington, you're on the air.
[52:59.000 --> 53:03.840]  Yeah, Alex, as far as, oh, can you hear me?
[53:03.840 --> 53:04.840]  Yes, I can.
[53:04.840 --> 53:05.840]  Worldwide transmission.
[53:05.840 --> 53:06.840]  Go ahead.
[53:06.840 --> 53:07.840]  Yes.
[53:07.840 --> 53:12.800]  You were talking about what I think the hypocrisy stems from, and I think it's from fears that
[53:12.800 --> 53:16.440]  the masses don't have any, I don't see any solutions on the right or the left.
[53:16.440 --> 53:17.440]  That's right.
[53:17.440 --> 53:18.440]  They don't respect themselves.
[53:18.440 --> 53:23.920]  I mean, solutions, you put state representatives and congressional representatives in who will
[53:23.920 --> 53:27.480]  call for the indictment of these federal reserve heads that are all basically burning
[53:27.480 --> 53:31.040]  Madoff types and Kandelay types, and we bring these people to justice.
[53:31.040 --> 53:33.520]  If we don't, there's no end to the raping and robbing.
[53:33.520 --> 53:34.720]  They've shown us that.
[53:34.720 --> 53:35.720]  They're never going to stop.
[53:35.720 --> 53:39.520]  Look, where has Blackwater moved to the Middle East because they've got indictments out
[53:39.520 --> 53:40.520]  on them?
[53:40.520 --> 53:42.680]  Where has Halliburton moved to the Middle East?
[53:42.680 --> 53:46.080]  Most of these globalists already can't believe how much they've gotten away with.
[53:46.080 --> 53:48.280]  They've all moved offshore.
[53:48.280 --> 53:50.240]  You get rid of NAFTA and GATT.
[53:50.240 --> 53:52.400]  Right, but what is the solution?
[53:52.400 --> 53:54.640]  I mean, where do you get solutions?
[53:54.640 --> 53:56.160]  You take back the states.
[53:56.160 --> 53:57.680]  You get rid of NAFTA and GATT.
[53:57.680 --> 54:01.960]  You identify the banking cartels, the croaks that are on American criminal trash.
[54:01.960 --> 54:02.960]  I mean, right there.
[54:02.960 --> 54:09.160]  About a project called NAPA, the North American Water and Power Alliance, or something about
[54:09.160 --> 54:14.320]  a dam project from Alaska to the desert states of Southwest America.
[54:14.320 --> 54:15.320]  Yes.
[54:15.320 --> 54:17.960]  Do you think that that would be a viable solution?
[54:17.960 --> 54:18.960]  No.
[54:18.960 --> 54:23.440]  They're going to offer North American Union garbage as a solution.
[54:23.440 --> 54:25.160]  Oh, give us trillions more.
[54:25.160 --> 54:29.200]  They'll build an infrastructure to get your economy going, and it's all in their hands.
[54:29.200 --> 54:30.800]  That's what globalism is, Tim.
[54:30.800 --> 54:36.640]  So you think what we have to do first is combat in the world order and take them out of office?
[54:36.640 --> 54:37.640]  Here's the deal.
[54:37.640 --> 54:38.640]  Yes, yes.
[54:38.640 --> 54:42.320]  We have 60% on average turnout for presidential elections when it's easy for the globalists
[54:42.320 --> 54:44.120]  to buy both puppets.
[54:44.120 --> 54:46.840]  We have 8% local.
[54:46.840 --> 54:47.840]  People need to look.
[54:47.840 --> 54:51.280]  You don't like them teaching global warming and teaching your kids to commit suicide.
[54:51.280 --> 54:55.200]  They actually do that and teaching them that humans are bad in school.
[54:55.200 --> 55:00.560]  A, get them out of public school, or B, go get involved, run for school board, go shout
[55:00.560 --> 55:02.160]  these crooks down.
[55:02.160 --> 55:05.000]  You know, what does the Attorney General of Texas do in Abbott?
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.080]  He's suing the federal government saying you're trying to pass carbon taxes in Texas in the
[55:09.080 --> 55:12.520]  name of a fraud, and he brings out the fraud at Climate Gate.
[55:12.520 --> 55:16.440]  You just get angry, you get focused, and you never shut up, and you don't let all these
[55:16.440 --> 55:21.840]  Republican leaders and talk show hosts that for 20 years told us no new world order existed,
[55:21.840 --> 55:24.880]  and there wasn't a plan to set up a world government when they knew full well there
[55:24.880 --> 55:28.680]  was, they were there stalling you, telling you it didn't exist, now because it's out
[55:28.680 --> 55:32.400]  in the open, they come out and admit it's real, but say they're going to be your solution
[55:32.400 --> 55:33.400]  to the problem.
[55:33.400 --> 55:34.520]  I appreciate your call.
[55:34.520 --> 55:35.520]  Good points, Tim.
[55:35.520 --> 55:36.520]  Mandy in Texas.
[55:36.520 --> 55:37.520]  Mandy, you're on the air.
[55:37.520 --> 55:38.520]  Hey, Alex.
[55:38.520 --> 55:44.120]  You were talking about hypocrisy in regards to history.
[55:44.120 --> 55:51.360]  Right now, I'm studying eugenics and how you have been used to sterilize people and
[55:51.360 --> 55:53.280]  to murder people.
[55:53.280 --> 55:57.000]  Right here in the U.S., right here in the U.S., you tell the average, yuppie that, they laugh
[55:57.000 --> 55:58.000]  at you.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.200]  You tell a yuppie like I did 10 years ago, they're shooting kids up in the U.S. angle
[56:01.200 --> 56:04.840]  at a model with syphilis, they laugh at you, and when their kid goes and gets a mercury
[56:04.840 --> 56:07.200]  filled shot and has convulsions, they laugh at that.
[56:07.200 --> 56:08.200]  They love it.
[56:08.200 --> 56:09.200]  They love their kids going in coffins.
[56:09.200 --> 56:10.200]  I'm sorry.
[56:10.200 --> 56:11.200]  Go ahead.
[56:11.200 --> 56:15.120]  I love the elites, people who think they're elite, who really aren't.
[56:15.120 --> 56:16.120]  Exactly.
[56:16.120 --> 56:20.400]  They might make $50,000 a year, but because they buy into this corruption, they sit there
[56:20.400 --> 56:23.360]  and smile at you, and that's why they're getting destroyed.
[56:23.360 --> 56:24.360]  Yeah.
[56:24.360 --> 56:30.400]  They think that, I'm studying the people who want to link it to some kind of gene, like
[56:30.400 --> 56:35.480]  all throughout eugenics history, they're trying to find some kind of biological reason for
[56:35.480 --> 56:37.040]  why they should exterminate people.
[56:37.040 --> 56:41.160]  Yeah, it's extrajudicial, and it started in England in the U.S. and it was exported
[56:41.160 --> 56:45.280]  to Hitler, and that's what family courts are set up 100 years ago in this country.
[56:45.280 --> 56:46.480]  They're outside of law.
[56:46.480 --> 56:50.000]  The family courts were set up to sterilize people, and that's why they can take your
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.320]  kid with no real court hearing or no proof because it's outside of law.
[56:54.320 --> 56:57.320]  It's a murder court, and you know what, Mandy, God bless you.
[56:57.320 --> 57:02.080]  You were the first caller of four callers who really called in with what I asked callers
[57:02.080 --> 57:03.080]  to do.
[57:03.080 --> 57:07.260]  Look, I simply asked callers, give me your example of hypocrisy.
[57:07.260 --> 57:12.320]  Give me your example of where government and megacorporations get away with bloody murder,
[57:12.320 --> 57:14.400]  and the citizens have the book thrown at them.
[57:14.400 --> 57:16.840]  We have the biggest prison population in the world.
[57:16.840 --> 57:19.000]  How was that landed the free home of the brave?
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  Most of them innocent.
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.040]  Most of them nonviolent, and the government releases violent offenders to go out and menace
[57:24.040 --> 57:25.040]  the public.
[57:25.040 --> 57:26.040]  I'm angry.
[57:26.040 --> 57:27.240]  I'm mad.
[57:27.240 --> 57:28.240]  I'm focused.
[57:28.240 --> 57:29.920]  I know what's going on.
[57:29.920 --> 57:31.880]  You want solutions?
[57:31.880 --> 57:35.760]  You call Congress and you tell them, listen, you get rid of the rule of law, and you get
[57:35.760 --> 57:41.000]  rid of the fact that mortgage companies can't take any house they want with no proof.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  You get rid of that.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.040]  You're going to allow these criminals to rob everybody.
[57:44.040 --> 57:47.160]  You're going to be complicit in these crimes, you scumbags.
[57:47.160 --> 57:52.040]  Hour two coming up.
[57:52.040 --> 57:55.760]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[57:55.760 --> 57:58.920]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[57:58.920 --> 58:03.280]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[58:03.280 --> 58:04.280]  at home.
[58:04.280 --> 58:08.920]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[58:08.920 --> 58:09.920]  calling the shots.
[58:09.920 --> 58:15.120]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[58:15.120 --> 58:18.560]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[58:18.560 --> 58:24.400]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[58:24.400 --> 58:25.400]  world government.
[58:25.400 --> 58:27.800]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[58:27.800 --> 58:31.920]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[58:31.920 --> 58:37.800]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[58:37.800 --> 58:38.800]  of the Republic.
[58:38.800 --> 58:43.600]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[58:43.600 --> 58:50.560]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[58:50.560 --> 58:54.160]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[58:54.160 --> 58:56.360]  It ended on June of 2009.
[58:56.360 --> 59:00.160]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[59:00.160 --> 59:04.280]  A recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things
[59:04.280 --> 59:05.800]  seem to be getting worse.
[59:05.800 --> 59:07.920]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[59:07.920 --> 59:11.000]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[59:11.000 --> 59:14.960]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider
[59:14.960 --> 59:17.520]  a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[59:17.520 --> 59:19.880]  They both make fabulous investments.
[59:19.880 --> 59:24.240]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial
[59:24.240 --> 59:25.240]  resource.
[59:25.240 --> 59:29.560]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks,
[59:29.560 --> 59:30.560]  or metals.
[59:30.560 --> 59:35.160]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long
[59:35.160 --> 59:36.160]  term.
[59:36.160 --> 59:38.840]  This will freeze the cost to your food while you can still afford it.
[59:38.840 --> 59:44.760]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet, or call 800-409-5633.
[59:44.760 --> 01:00:11.760]  That's eFoodsDirect.com, or 800-409-5633.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:21.960]  They've taught us to feel powerless, we're not powerless.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.960]  We're continuing with your phone calls, and I'll get into the economy, the election,
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.960]  the wars, the police state, it's all coming up.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.960]  I appreciate all of you joining us on this live Sunday Transmission.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.960]  Dan in Vermont, then David Stewart, Jeff, Don, Tom, Josh, Drew, and others.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.960]  Dan in Vermont, you're on the air.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.960]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.960]  Thanks for waking me up about a month ago to 9-11 and everything.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:42.160]  I wanted to call in with a talk to you about an example, here in Burlington, Vermont, we
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:48.800]  have the local government taking a $500 million contract for a big government telecom company
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.760]  policing us out of all of our tax dollars, and then to second anybody who says anything
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:01:00.200]  about it, oh, you're alone, you're just a tea party, you're evil and scum, and they
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.200]  treat you like crap.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.760]  The second you try to say anything to them, meanwhile they have no problems, second us
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.760]  dry here.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:09.680]  And anybody who tries to fight it is just you're able to get some right-wing patriot
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.680]  hater.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.680]  Well, that's another good point.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:16.800]  In fact, there's big protests all over California and other places where a city manager, even
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:22.000]  in a small town, I saw one case, was getting $800 grand a year while everybody else is
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.480]  going bankrupt.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:27.240]  And it's just like, look, you don't need $800 grand a year to be a city manager taking
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:32.200]  our tax money and investing in derivatives and getting your payoff, you little creature.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:37.120]  And again, it's just hypocrisy everywhere, and by pointing it out and continuing to counter
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.920]  them, their support's already dissipated.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.520]  The globalists are already in trouble.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.920]  We just got to push this over the edge.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.320]  We're going to beat these people.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.320]  Good points, Dan.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.320]  Anything else?
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:51.000]  Yeah, just to say that, I mean, thanks for waking me up and hopefully that more people
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.440]  in this really, really liberal state can kind of just see what the globalists are doing
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.440]  because they're second us dry.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.440]  Yeah.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.440]  How do they like NAFTA?
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.440]  How do they like big government?
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:00.920]  Everything we told them is happening.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:05.080]  And remember, the Republicans have some good lip service, but they're just as bad.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.080]  Thanks, Dan.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.800]  Let's talk to David and count of David here on the air.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.440]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.440]  Hey, buddy.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.440]  Good to hear from you.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:16.040]  I'm a great fan of your work, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.240]  Well, thanks for putting up with me.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.680]  What's on your mind?
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:25.600]  In terms of your request for a hypocrisy item, I guess nothing's more evident in the recent
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:30.800]  time, except for the waivers for McDonald's, et cetera, from healthcare.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:31.800]  Incredible guys.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.680]  I want to have that when we come back.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:37.360]  It's McDonald's 29 other firms given its exemptions.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.360]  Healthcare.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.360]  Excellent point.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.360]  Oh.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.360]  Oh.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.360]  You know what I'm doing here?
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.840]  I'm going to do a YouTube video this week on government hypocrisy, and there's so many
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.840]  of them.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:48.840]  I want all your ideas for it.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:49.840]  That's awesome.
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:50.840]  Healthcare.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:51.840]  Absolutely.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.840]  Yeah.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.840]  The opportunity to speak to you today.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.560]  And of course, you can see that if they can give exemptions for the biggest corporations
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.760]  and then, of course, many millions of small businesses in the U.S. will have to, of course,
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:10.440]  pay the healthcare premiums, that'll hurt impact employment in a very significant way.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.160]  So there's not that hypocrisy.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.880]  It's nothing else.
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:18.880]  You mentioned Alec de Tocqueville from the 1840s when he visited America.
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.720]  The 1840s, yeah.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:27.600]  He mentioned that nowhere in the world was freedom so prevalent as in America, but he
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:32.040]  also mentioned that nowhere was it so little exercised.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:37.200]  And I think he quotes shows that people in Poland where they would be executed for speaking
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.400]  out still spoke out, but America people didn't.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:48.080]  And I think we still got that kind of culture where Americans are cowed by the fear of being
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.640]  not allowed to or not being, I guess, socially accepted, right?
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.600]  They won't speak out if they think that someone will malign them.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:01.000]  And that's a very serious issue because people then, even if they have the freedom, they
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  don't exercise it.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.880]  And, of course, a freedom is only available as long as you exercise it.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:10.200]  It's just like muscles and people sit there and wonder, well, what do we do?
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.200]  What do we do?
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:17.560]  All I'm giving solutions, all I'm doing is having other guests on with solutions, but
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:21.640]  there's nothing that's a simple silver bullet.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:26.120]  And I think, you know, the key, of course, to America recovering its freedom is through
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.760]  organization.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:34.320]  And with both of the major political parties totally contained by the elites or the corporatists
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:39.840]  who have bought them out, Americans don't have anywhere to turn, really.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.520]  And so I can understand why they're pretty apathetic or they don't really know what
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.520]  to do.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.880]  Or they've been conned so many times that they just don't have any faith.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.360]  You got to get your faith back because if you don't, it only gets worse.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.360]  David, great call.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.920]  When I come back, I'm going to talk about the hypocrisy issue you raised.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:58.720]  The number to join us is 888-201-2244, I'll open the phone lines up again.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:03.440]  You may be arrested and no subject to other police action.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.720]  tyranny is here.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:08.320]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:11.040]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:15.600]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.800]  on earth.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:21.640]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.480]  expanded nationwide.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:28.160]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.560]  shadow state.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:33.600]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:38.040]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:43.880]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:47.360]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.400]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.400]  It's here.

[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:22.440]  If you get caught accidentally dumping just a little bit of motor oil on your property,
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:26.320]  you can spend five years in prison.
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:32.640]  But if you for 20 years serve out tens of thousands of tons of depleted uranium that
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.600]  is highly radioactive and poisonous, when the Army's own internal reports, we've had
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:40.000]  the former head of the ArmyDU program on to talk about this, Doug Rocky, when their own
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.680]  reports show it is a death sentence for troops that use it.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:52.360]  Lung cancer, sinus cancer, kidney cancer, urethra cancer.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:55.040]  There's an example of crazy hypocrisy.
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:59.480]  But if you just joined us, we had a caller in the last segment say I've got one, a caller
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.840]  from Canada.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:08.040]  He said McDonald's and 29 other firms get health care coverage waivers, USA Today.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.440]  That was back about a week and a half ago.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:16.200]  And they have millions of employees, but it's not just that it's unfair and discrimination.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:22.280]  What about the other hamburger place that's, let's take Dan's hamburgers in Austin, Texas.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:26.880]  Been around for almost 30 years, great old fashioned, high quality hamburgers, doesn't
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:31.760]  have all the additives in it, doesn't make you get nauseous when you eat it.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.560]  Dan's hamburgers, they're going to have to get insurance for all their employees, make
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.120]  them pay for it out of their check and match it.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:42.280]  So that'll probably make a $3 hamburger go up to four bucks.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.200]  We're having to look at what having to buy health care I'll do here in my little office.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.640]  I'll probably just have to lay some people off.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.200]  Bye, you don't have a job anymore.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.760]  Now I'm taking part of your paycheck to pay for your insurance.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.240]  I got to match it.
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:57.040]  I've asked my people if they want it, they're like, no, no, I'll get it on my own if I want
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.280]  it.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:04.960]  But doesn't matter, McDonald's and 29 other firms get health care coverage waivers.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.160]  And that's why I'm taking your calls.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.640]  There's so many examples of hypocrisy, where does it end?
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:11.400]  I want to hear from you with your specifics.
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:14.200]  And then quite frankly, I'm taking all these different points that I've made and you've
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.200]  made.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.160]  I'm going to make a YouTube video this week that'll get a few hundred thousand views
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.360]  conservatively, maybe a million, where I go over the hypocrisy.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.880]  It's pointing out hypocrisy that brings it down.
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.160]  The mainstream media has the lowest approval rating in history.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:29.080]  The Congress, the president, they're all a joke.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:33.040]  We've got to discredit these crooks first before we can bring them to justice.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.720]  We've got to take our states back, take our Congress back.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.240]  We've got to get a fighting spirit.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:40.400]  We've got to realize how they work their scams.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:43.440]  We've got to say, no, don't devalue the dollar.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.160]  Don't pay off the debt that way.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.960]  Cut taxes and cut government.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.880]  No, don't allow mortgage companies to take anybody's house they want without even filing
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.160]  the proper paperwork or having deeds.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.160]  It's on record.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.120]  They're taking houses all over the country where the people paid for it and they don't
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120]  even have a deed.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.560]  I've seen cases where three different banks are trying to take the same house because
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.440]  somebody sold them derivatives like Goldman Sachs.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.720]  They sell this fraud out there.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.960]  The owners are coming to get your house, but they don't own your house.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.880]  I mean, we've got to recognize this.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:17.480]  If we give in to this, it's just going to get worse and worse.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.720]  You know, repeal, naft and get.
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.120]  Those are one-sided trade deals.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.120]  Look at our deal with China.
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.680]  They've been raising all these tariffs.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:24.880]  We have no tariffs on them.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.400]  It isn't fair.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.400]  It isn't free trade.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.120]  It's a scam.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.560]  You like what globalism's done for you?
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.040]  Both parties supporting it?
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.120]  All right.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.400]  I'm ranting now.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.120]  But yeah, the Department of Health and Human Services says, yeah, your company's going
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.120]  to waiver.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.760]  So, see, in the future, it's only the big globalist companies who get the waivers.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.400]  I see this whole time in the town I live where some company comes to Austin and they get
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:54.560]  total tax exemption, but I sure don't get a tax exemption.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.560]  This is unfair.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.560]  This is a scam.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.560]  This is hypocrisy.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.560]  All right.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.200]  I'm going to go back to your phone calls and I got a bunch of economic news and other
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.200]  key stuff coming up.
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:06.400]  But right now, because now the Pentagon, I told you this over a decade ago, but now
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:11.080]  the Pentagon's like, yeah, we are training the military to take over.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.080]  And I heard troops calling the local news station going, yeah, we're training for that.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.920]  Aren't you glad we're going to keep you safe during the collapse?
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:22.120]  But foreign banks engineered it and quietly started getting the military ready for this.
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:27.680]  It's in the IMF World Bank plan 2002, BBC.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.800]  You ever noticed a third world country when you're in it's got troops on the streets
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:36.720]  wherever they've robbed everybody, they got troops on the streets, okay?
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.280]  It's real simple.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.600]  You better support our troops, turn your guns into them Alex, or you're some kind of commie.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.600]  I'm me.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.200]  I'm turning my guns in right away.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.640]  Well, I heard one guy call in to the local show one, yeah, my son's the Marines.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:53.200]  He's training for door-to-door gun confiscation.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.200]  What's wrong with that?
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:11:00.640]  You some kind of, the country's going down, troops going to keep you safe.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.640]  Okay, pal.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.800]  It'll be somebody else's son coming to take your guns and you'll probably go, ah, I'll
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.800]  support America.
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.800]  George Washington's bad.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.800]  Here it is.
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:09.800]  I'm a coward.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.800]  I do whatever I'm told.
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.400]  The country's already gone.
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:17.360]  Foreign banks took it over a long time ago, but it was illegitimate and done through fraud.
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:21.160]  You got to stand up and say, hold it right there, mister.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.160]  You understand?
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.320]  That you got to grow a backbone, pal.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.320]  Ha!
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.600]  Stewart in California, you're on the air.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.600]  Go ahead.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.600]  Absolutely.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.600]  I came in.
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:37.080]  Great job on the money bomb, the programming during that day and a half was just outstanding.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:38.080]  Thank you.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:39.080]  Yeah, Lou Dobbs, George Norrie.
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.080]  It was, it was insane.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.080]  Yeah, it really was.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:46.760]  Hey, a couple of quick points, you know, there's no shortage of examples of the hypocrisy.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:52.200]  One of my favorites is Walmart and Walmart's a good one to showcase, you know, how it came
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.200]  out in the news.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.200]  I'm sorry.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.200]  Go ahead.
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.200]  I'll make my point.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.200]  Go ahead.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.200]  Yeah, no, Walmart.
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.200]  Go ahead.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.640]  You know, it's come out that they get those greeters up there because they've done actuaries
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.640]  that they know when they're statistically going to die as a group.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:09.920]  And so they take out insurance on them and they never tell the family they took insurance
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:10.920]  out.
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:14.600]  So they hire grandma for a year and then they got 2 million on insurance on her.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:19.080]  But that came out in Bloomberg two months ago that Prudential and others signed a deal
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:23.040]  11 years ago with the Department of Defense to steal the death benefits of 6 million dead
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.640]  and dying veterans from World War II through the current wars.
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:31.200]  And then they just take their insurance money and the government said that's okay.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:33.120]  And I also have Bloomberg reporting.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:37.400]  They ordered the private pension funds to invest in failed derivatives.
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.640]  That's this year.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.080]  But again, you're not patriotic if you don't hand over your pension fund.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.200]  You're not patriotic if you don't take veterans death benefits.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:50.560]  Being patriotic today means worshiping tyranny, worshiping corruption, worshiping the collapse
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.720]  of the country.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.920]  And so a lot of you out there into that, you think you're on the winning team because you
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.920]  suck thumbs?
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:57.920]  Good.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:01.120]  All you fake Republicans and Democrats are going to get hurt so bad and you deserve it.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.360]  But those of us that are awakened are good people.
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:04.360]  We don't.
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:05.360]  Go ahead, Stuart.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:06.360]  I'm sorry.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.360]  Give me the hypocrisy of Wally World.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.360]  Yeah.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.360]  Yeah.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.760]  It's over the top and I think that's the good news.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:18.200]  The good news is that we've reached on what I believe is a very clearly predicted point
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.360]  of confronting the citizenry.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:25.200]  And they've war-gained this out with their data mining and their predictive programming
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.200]  algorithms.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.080]  And I think you're trying to draw out the opposition and it's time to illuminate the
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.200]  potential pitfalls that they're setting up, you know, and you do a great job of that.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:40.200]  I think you've, you know, illuminated the need to not be violent, not do anything that
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:44.080]  would give them further ammunition to demonize genuine.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.080]  Yeah, Stuart.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.080]  I'm going to hold you over.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.080]  I'm going to hold you over.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.080]  I'm going to hold you over.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.080]  She can make her points.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:50.880]  I'm going to counter this now.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.600]  You got 300 million people.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.600]  They're losing their jobs.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.000]  The banks are robbing them.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.320]  And anytime somebody resists, they call them a terrorist, then they search their computer
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:03.640]  after they've been arrested and they find thousands of websites they visited.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.640]  And what do they announce?
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:09.720]  Michael Savage, Russ Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Alex Jones, this guy was a fan of them.
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.000]  So it's their fault.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.200]  We've got a ban-free speech.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:16.360]  You got the White House announcing it, all these calls for censorship because the crooks
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:21.560]  know they're not going to get, so they create a climate as the 112-point IMF World Bank
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:27.280]  Plan, the class, oh, actually leaked, wasn't classified, 2002, to BBC stated, they collapse
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.480]  the economy.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:33.840]  Then when people riot, they use that as a pretext to come in and clamp down on everybody.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:37.920]  And our media is reporting thousands are protesting in Greece and Spain.
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.560]  Thousands are protesting in Italy.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:40.960]  Thousands are protesting in France.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.240]  I've been checking the French news and the Greek and Spanish news.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:49.760]  There are millions per major city, I mean, you're talking 20, 30% of every city.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:55.040]  They are taking over and our controlled corporate prostitute media is telling us a few thousand
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.040]  around the street, Stuart.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:02.960]  Well, you know, you're doing a great job, Luke is doing a great job, particularly like
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.720]  his bullhorning of the police lines at one of the, maybe it was the G20, I forget which
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:14.200]  event it was, but, you know, appealing to the police and the military, I think has phenomenal
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.200]  potential.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.040]  It started all over Europe.
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.720]  The police are now joining with the people.
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:20.720]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:26.080]  I mean, the own keepers, you know, the fact that they're demonizing them so consistently
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.080]  shows us that's what they're worried about.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:32.640]  They're worried about this, this ongoing awakening within the police and the military.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.640]  They can't bring in enough foreign troops.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.640]  There's 300.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.640]  I tell you what, Stuart, stay there.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.640]  Stay there.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.640]  I want you to finish up.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:42.560]  Then Jeff, Don, Tom, Josh, Drew and others, 888-201-2244.
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:46.240]  I want your example, though, Stuart, of hypocrisy when we come back.
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:50.240]  People can talk about whatever they want, but I at least want your example of hypocrisy.
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:54.640]  Uh, and, and look, I get angry and upset because I've studied history.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:56.240]  I know how real this is.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:59.640]  You understand we're going to be a completely collapsed third world hell, hellhole.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.640]  Hi, folks.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.760]  This is Alex Jones, asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap, not
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.040]  detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin soap company, a family
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.040]  owned and operated American company.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:15.860]  My family, staff, friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:18.520]  these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:22.480]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated subs
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.480]  anywhere.

[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:36.040]  Let's talk to the owner of 5star soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:42.880]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:46.880]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:58.040]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website, 5starsoap.com, for buying a one to two month
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.040]  soap sampler.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.040]  Thank you.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:05.360]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:09.680]  with your self produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.280]  function of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:16.600]  solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:21.400]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:26.000]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.640]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:34.160]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:40.920]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:41.920]  system.
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:49.280]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.400]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works.
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:18:00.120]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.760]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.760]  Number 1.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:09.080]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.080]  Number 2.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:13.880]  Our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:14.880]  to have.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:20.440]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:21.440]  Number 3.
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.760]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.760]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:29.760]  Number 4.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:32.240]  This weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.920]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:36.920]  Number 5.
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:40.640]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:44.480]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:45.880]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.080]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.680]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:19:00.120]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:03.720]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.920]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:09.720]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:13.240]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.400]  of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.520]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.560]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:24.520]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:27.080]  a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.480]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:33.680]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.680]  resource.
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:39.120]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks,
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.120]  or metals.
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:44.880]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.880]  term.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.680]  This will freeze the cost to your food while you can still afford it.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:54.360]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:20:24.200]  That's eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:46.680]  Look, I'm ranting and raving because I know what I'm talking about.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.920]  I understand this takeover that's happening to our nation and the rest of the planet.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.680]  I know how criminal it is.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.280]  I know how ruthless these people are.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:57.840]  I mean, looking at Bill Clinton saying, get ready to run Hillary and he'll fix the banking
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:04.440]  mess, it was Bill Clinton who spearheaded getting rid of Glass-Steagall Act to allow
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.680]  the thousands of trillions, even the Washington Post says 600 trillion, but the real numbers
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:12.280]  are about 1.5 quadrillion according to the economists we've talked to.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:17.200]  They're the ones that created these tens of thousands of trillions actually, not tens
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:23.760]  or even hundreds, but thousands of trillions in fiat financial counterfeit paper to buy
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.160]  everything up.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:29.440]  And now because they've got all this ill-gotten fraud that we've got to back up with our tax
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:31.800]  money, everybody's got to bow down and lick their boots.
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:32.800]  That's coming up.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:35.440]  But Stuart, finish up the point you were going to make.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:39.680]  What's your bottom line take on what some of the worst hypocrisy is out there?
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:46.840]  Well, the big picture stuff, you've covered really well in my local community here.
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:53.080]  You've got what appear to be illegal immigrant food stands, every four blocks and right in
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:58.120]  the middle of this neighborhood, they raided this organic food market that's got all the
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.120]  coverage.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:06.320]  And it's absolutely ridiculous because God only knows how or where this food was grown.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.320]  Exactly.
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:14.680]  If a 10-year-old gets caught with an eliminate stand, they get $150 fine, but the illegals
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:19.200]  are all left alone because they're part of the globalist takeover.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.920]  Yeah.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:21.920]  That's another great point.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:22.920]  Okay.
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:24.880]  What are some of the other pitfalls, Stuart, you wanted to mention of how they're trying
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:27.880]  to set up the movement against tyranny?
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:36.640]  Well, I think the main one, one of the main ones is co-opting and controlling the movement
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.640]  as it gains power.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:40.440]  And we're at a very, very powerful point now.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:47.040]  I think the Glenn Beck Gambit is a good example of them wanting to put the focus of the problem
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:52.560]  on the low-level ponds and shift the focus away from the steering committees, if you
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.200]  will, behind the scenes.
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:59.520]  And I think we need to avoid that, you know, avoid letting them shift our focus from where
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:04.120]  it needs to be, which is on the new world order mechanisms of control and deception.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.080]  All right, Stuart, great points.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.600]  Appreciate your call.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:10.600]  Let's talk to Jeff in Texas, Jeff, you're on the air.
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:11.600]  Yeah.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.600]  Hi, Alex.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:13.600]  Big example.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.520]  It's an old one, but it came out in this book called Imperial Cruise from about the time
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:22.920]  of the Spanish-American war when the Marines basically went into the royal palace in Hawaii
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:25.320]  and at gunpoint kicked out the queen.
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:27.280]  Guess who they appointed?
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:28.280]  Governor of Hawaii.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:31.640]  He was the head of the Hawaiian pineapple company.
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:33.360]  One guess as to what his last name was.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.360]  I forget.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.360]  It was Dole.
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.360]  Oh, that's right.
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:43.480]  It's a very important book by this, the guy who wrote flags of our fathers, that James
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:49.040]  Bradley, because it goes into a lot of the eugenics that people like Teddy Roosevelt
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:54.040]  were promoting and talks about how they made deals with Japan, basically gave them the
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.560]  green light to go invade Korea.
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:56.560]  You should check it out.
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:00.600]  I did know about that and I knew about Dole and United Fruit taking over Latin America
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:04.040]  and being involved with the pineapples in Hawaii.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:09.640]  And again, back then, it was okay in their minds to go kill some brown people for their
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:10.640]  land.
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:14.640]  The point is, this is now being done to everybody and it was wrong to the Native Americans.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.440]  It was wrong to the Hawaiians.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:21.760]  It's wrong what they're doing to us, but no one's going to protect us but ourselves.
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:22.760]  Great points.
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:23.760]  Anything else, sir?
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.000]  Just there's one example in this book.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  It's a picture.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.320]  It shows our troops waterboarding a Filipino when they were taken over the Philippines.
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.320]  Well, you know.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.320]  Things just have not changed.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:36.600]  You know, who was involved in the Philippines, Smedley Butler was the two-time congressional
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:39.760]  medal of honor winner in line to be the commandant of the Marine Corps.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:43.640]  They tried to hire him in the 30s and this came out in the McCormick-Dickstein House
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:49.640]  committees to stage a martial law takeover in the U.S. but he said no and blew the whistle.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.400]  But he wrote the book War as a Racket.
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:55.640]  He overthrew country after country and finally went public with it.
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.520]  There's this quote from Teddy Roosevelt's wife when she was talking about her servants.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:04.120]  It says, if they had our brains, they'd have our place.
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.040]  I appreciate your call, Jeff.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:08.040]  Good point.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.040]  Let's go to Don in Michigan.
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.040]  Don, you're on the air.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.040]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.040]  Good.
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:16.600]  Yeah, I just wanted you to do it.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:20.680]  If you could take one second to address, I have a 20-year-old and 11-year-old daughter
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:27.880]  sitting right here and I'm trying to slowly introduce them into what's going on.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:34.240]  I don't want to scare them but to me it's so important that they learn and especially
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:41.240]  my 20-year-old she's in college, I don't want her to be too influenced by the college environment.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:48.120]  But if you could just give them a brief overview or a quick insight on what they should be
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:54.240]  careful of and what they should pay attention to, I respect everything you say and I completely
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.680]  appreciate what you're doing.
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:01.080]  With that, I'll shut up and go to the next caller when you're done.
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.080]  Well, thank you, Don.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:06.160]  I'll let you go and then try to answer that question.
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.680]  What do I say to you about college?
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.840]  Unless you're getting an engineering degree or a medical degree or something more and
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.040]  more or they don't pay off when you get a degree, I mean, if you'll pay for it as daddy
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:22.320]  then it's got some value but it's another bubble, another racket in many cases.
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:29.920]  The Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, they teach an anti-America, anti-family agenda.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.720]  They have the fake left agenda, the fake right agenda.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:36.280]  I would tell them get involved with Campaign for Liberty and Libertarian constitutional
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.560]  ideas.
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:40.640]  I would tell them don't ever get into drugs.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.800]  Most of that's shipped in by the government so they can then put you in their private
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:45.840]  prisons that are owned by the big money launderers.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:49.680]  Yeah, you go to prison in the drug dealer's prison so they make money on both ends is
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:52.120]  how they get you back into slavery.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:54.280]  Your family always comes first.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:59.280]  It's only family that's going to care about you in a pinch and that the colleges are there
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:02.000]  to try to indoctrinate you by and large.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  It varies.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:12.400]  There are some good professors and instructors but don't let the colleges brainwash you with
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:15.240]  their diversity training that you're bad.
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:19.280]  It really just goes to that point but I hope that, I would give them the Obama deception
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:20.280]  for all the republic.
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:22.040]  You don't have to buy the DVDs.
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:25.680]  You don't have to buy in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:28.160]  People do because they want the highest quality and it supports us.
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:33.160]  We couldn't do it without them but hundreds of millions of views with all these films
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:36.920]  on YouTube and Google just type in in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:42.920]  When you type in-game in you don't get chess move links or Samuel Beckett plays.
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:46.360]  You get my film.
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:50.840]  When you type in Obama, one of the top three links is the Obama deception.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:56.480]  Obama deception, fall of the republic, in-game, police state for the rise of FEMA, the film
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:00.840]  I produced, invisible empire, loose change, final cut.
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:05.800]  Just search those terms because I could sit here in just a minute or two and try to talk
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:10.480]  to your daughters but it's just best if they watch in-game, watch the Obama deception,
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:19.360]  watch fall of the republic and then on obamadesception.net what is the in-game.com, there's a full online
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:23.120]  bibliography and so they're out of college, I mean they're out of high school, they're
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.120]  now in college.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:27.920]  They know how to use a bibliography so when they're watching the film they can sit there
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:33.240]  with the film on one computer or a TV and then another computer open with every link,
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:36.960]  every bill, every statement, everything we say just right there.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:39.120]  Tell your daughters don't take birth control.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:43.000]  Most times it's got a system built into it depending on the type to sterilize or reduce
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  the fertility, tetanus shots, they've caught adding hormones to it to sterilize your daughters.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.600]  The guard is still shot, maims and kills women in mass, I mean that's the biggest thing,
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:56.280]  tell them don't let the teachers tell them to get on Prozac because it's the cool thing
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.280]  to do.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:01.120]  We'll be back with more calls, stay with us.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:08.720]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road but if the unfortunate
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:13.000]  happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.

[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:04.360]  This is alex jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:08.680]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:13.040]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:18.080]  allows you to have, it's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.040]  grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:24.360]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:28.400]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:32.720]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids, every year thousands
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:35.600]  of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:40.360]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind,
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:44.120]  folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science,
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:45.520]  one of my old sponsors.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:52.440]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com, remember the government
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:33:01.440]  doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:10.440]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network.
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:28.880]  Okay, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Sunday
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:33.880]  edition, the 17th of October 2010, I've got some other election news I want to head on,
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:40.600]  but as negative and scary as things are, it's positive to admit how dire our straits are
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:44.000]  so we can set about fixing it.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.880]  This cop out that it can't happen here, that it won't happen here, is why a lot of people
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:53.480]  have allowed things to go this far.
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:59.200]  And this country still has incredible wealth, and in a way that anesthetizes people, it
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:04.600]  kind of socially fogs their reason or drugs them to just hope things are going to get
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:06.880]  better right around the corner, they're not.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:11.320]  The globalists are openly announcing world government, openly announcing global taxes,
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:17.000]  the federal government's openly announcing plans to take your pension funds and tax them,
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.560]  in the name of protecting them of course, after they've already looted them and had
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:21.720]  them invest in derivatives.
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:28.600]  But the good news is just three years ago, no major neocon host that reached total 60-70
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:33.240]  million people every day on talk radio would talk about world government or talk about
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:34.800]  the new world order.
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:40.240]  But to stay pertinent, to stay relevant, they're now forced to, because myself and Ron Paul
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:45.080]  and many others and you out there, spread the word and showed people the proof.
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:47.200]  So now we're having a real debate.
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:51.440]  Now almost every American in Gallup polls knows that the Federal Reserve is private
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:55.880]  and wants to abolish it, it's over 80% now.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:58.640]  Now we're identifying the crooks.
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:01.800]  Now we're having an effect and that's beautiful.
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:04.400]  I want to talk about them getting Hillary Clinton ready to run for president and how
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:08.840]  serious this is and the Republicans set to sweep the House, probably even the Senate,
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:11.040]  but I want to rampage through your calls right now.
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:15.760]  Tom, Josh, Drew, Victoria, Scott, Gary, I am, Karen, Rick and others, try to get to
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:18.160]  at least those 10 calls.
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.440]  Let's talk to Tom in Wisconsin.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:20.880]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.640]  Alex, can you hear me worldwide?
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:24.640]  Worldwide brother.
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:26.040]  That's awesome.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:31.160]  Well, I wanted to start right away by saying that police acting as corporate officers,
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:35.720]  killing people openly and going free is my big bugaboo.
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:37.200]  It really bothers me.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.480]  Okay, that's a great hypocrisy I was thinking about during the break.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:45.600]  Have you heard this cop at the G20s, an activist was blowing bubbles from 10 feet away, bubbles
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:49.200]  were coming near him and the cop said, I'm going to arrest you if you blow more bubbles.
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:54.240]  They did arrest him and the cop is suing the person for defamation when they're in a public
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:55.240]  role.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:58.760]  I'm sure they're going to lose in case the fool settles, you know, whether they're also
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:00.320]  suing YouTube.
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:05.320]  But remember in Maryland, and by fool, I'm saying the people that are being sued are
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:08.600]  fools and they settle in Maryland.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:11.960]  The guys riding his motorcycle has a camera mounted on his helmet.
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:12.960]  That's popular to do.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:13.960]  A lot of people do that.
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:17.200]  The cop pulls him over unmarked points, you know, pulls a gun out on him.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:21.680]  They arrest the guy for videotaping the cop when the cop clearly knew the law.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:26.480]  He had no perception of privacy and there's thousands of cases all over the country where
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.920]  they're arresting people for filming cops even when they come to your own business to
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:33.720]  raid you and you have surveillance tapes and you release it later.
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:38.360]  They're arresting you for wiretapping when if it's in a public place of your own business,
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:40.920]  there's no perception of privacy and they're losing in court.
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:44.840]  The courts are saying, no, you have a right to videotape police in public places or on
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:45.960]  your own property.
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:50.920]  But it shows the hypocrisy that they've got cameras up surveilling us and warrantless wire
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:54.120]  taps and big brother, this big brother, that.
[01:36:54.120 --> 01:37:01.040]  But then if we videotape them, remember Pennsylvania, thousands of photos taken of kids at home
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.760]  off the school laptops.
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:03.760]  Okay.
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:10.040]  But the government saying that that that that's okay.
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:14.560]  They're saying that all of that is all right.
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:15.560]  Okay.
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:23.360]  So, so, so, so they're saying that they're going to surveil us, but then we can't publicly
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.360]  videotape them.
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:25.760]  I mean, isn't that crazy?
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:26.760]  Yeah.
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:32.240]  And, you know, there was a USA Today article on the front page that featured an incredible
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:38.360]  image of that state patrolman getting out of his car, out of his patrol car at three
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:42.980]  and very quickly pulled up in front of the guy kind of almost like haphazardly and getting
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:48.480]  out in pure rage with his gun drawn and they showed a like a fuzzy image of that in a total
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:54.160]  propaganda piece where it made it about, is it okay that citizens record the police because
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:59.760]  it might interfere with how they act when if anybody who listens to Alan Wach will sit
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:05.040]  will say it will agree with me when I say that he always says that whenever the surveil
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:08.840]  technologies put into place, it changes the way people behave.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:10.080]  And it's a total hypocrisy.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:14.880]  Well, hold on, why are police always getting caught turning their squad car cameras off?
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:17.840]  Because they want to use it on us, but not on themselves.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:21.720]  Tom, great point, great hypocrisy that you're pointing out.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.200]  Let's talk to Josh or who's up next?
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:26.200]  Who was I talking to?
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:27.200]  Josh?
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:29.520]  So I was just talking to Josh.
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.520]  We're going to Josh next.
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:33.320]  Josh, Josh and P.A., you're on the air.
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.320]  Hey, Alex.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.960]  So I want to give you my, my example of government hypocrisy.
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:39.320]  I'm actually directly involved in it.
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:45.480]  Um, 2004, it was a mortgage, uh, furnished issue in 2004, 2006.
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:49.360]  I worked for a mortgage company in California and I can't give too much specifics because
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:54.880]  I'm actually still involved in this federal case, but, um, I left the company in 2006.
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:59.600]  I was approached by two different agencies, two different federal agencies that wanted
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:06.920]  to investigate my, my former boss for supposedly committing between six to $12 million in mortgage
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:07.920]  fraud.
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.360]  And they had labeled it the largest, uh, mortgage scheme in the history of the United States,
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.800]  which we now know is not true.
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:19.720]  But what's interesting enough is six to $12 million and this man, which he's not a good
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:24.920]  man anyway, but the point is for six to $12 million, they want to try to do 15 to 20 years.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:30.960]  But yet you have Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and Bank of America who just completely loots
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:37.600]  the American people for 50 billion, 55 billion dollars and gets a $550 million fine.
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:38.600]  So that's right.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:41.720]  They've said, Oh, you're going to get a fine for a fraction of what you do.
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.960]  And it's admitted fraud, but that's okay.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:48.600]  And they always burn mid-level or low-level people, you know, just to put it up on a TV.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:52.960]  Oh, look, they're doing something because the JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:57.420]  Sachs people literally fill almost every regulatory position.
[01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:58.880]  It's a revolving door.
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:02.880]  They give bailouts to themselves, to their own bank accounts.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:07.960]  It's even worse, too, because it's also about, it's about enslaving the American people
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:15.000]  to work for slave labor in these private corporations, which are really jails, for them to continue.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.080]  It's as effective for the global leap, for, you know, offshoring.
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.760]  It's the same concept.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:25.440]  They want to continue enslaving us to produce products for them to continue getting rich
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:26.440]  off of.
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.440]  So it's this ongoing situation.
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:33.000]  And I just, you know, once again, thank you, because you've definitely opened up my eyes
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  for this for the last year.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  I've been listening to you recently.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  So thank you.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  Well, Josh, thank you.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  Let me ask you this quick question.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.120]  How horrifying is it for you when they admittedly are taking houses that are even paid for, not
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:47.240]  just not having the deeds or selling it many, many times over and no one knowing who has
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:51.120]  it or multiple banks trying to foreclose on the same house?
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:54.960]  Or I've also seen mainstream reports that's also confirmed by listeners calling me.
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:59.520]  I always get the calls before it's even in the news where they have, you know, a few
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:00.520]  programs.
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:01.520]  Well, you can renegotiate your mortgage.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:02.960]  So you go in to do it.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.520]  They tell you you're doing that.
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:08.280]  You sign papers and then they laugh at you and take your house.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:11.120]  Now they've already passed the law.
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:17.520]  Obama hasn't signed it yet to allow the banks with no paperwork or anything to just take
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:18.880]  anything they want.
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:24.440]  So we already know there's fraud and the government's answer is we'll make this legal.
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:28.880]  Well that's like the Supreme Court making it legal that blacks weren't humans.
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:29.880]  Blacks are still humans.
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:34.280]  Even to the Supreme Court a hundred and something years ago said they weren't humans or two-thirds
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:35.280]  human.
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:41.080]  So, you know, Congress can't certify that, say, Barack Obama is allowed to barbeque small
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:43.560]  children on the front lawn of the White House.
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:48.000]  Congress can't certify they're allowed to warrantless warrantlessly wiretap citizens.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.160]  Congress can't certify that torture is okay.
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:53.080]  I mean, it just, it just makes them complicit criminals.
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:56.640]  They, you know, they can't just wave a wand and make something legal.
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:58.640]  Well, this is what they do.
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.960]  This is what they continue to do.
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:04.480]  I mean, I've watched, I, I, myself and a couple of other associates actually worked
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:05.480]  for this guy.
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:06.480]  We were helping people.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:09.960]  And it's really fascinating because you see that, you know, it really at the end of the
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:13.320]  day, it's not about helping people, you know, the government doesn't care about helping
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:14.320]  people.
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:17.680]  They just want to look like they're helping people so they continue, once again, having
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:21.560]  a scapegoat, the smaller little minions, the small people, right, at the end of the
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:25.360]  day, they can just kind of push, push the dirt on and, you know, let, let their, their
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:31.160]  Gestapo, Stasi, FBI and, you know, Treasury Department agencies, won people over and just
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:35.920]  constant, you know, continue promoting this ideology of fear in the American people.
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.920]  Great points.
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:38.920]  Great points, Josh.
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:39.920]  You know, it's total hypocrisy.
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:43.560]  I'm going to try to jam in as many calls as I can, but I need to get into election news
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:45.560]  first, briefly on the other side.
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:50.200]  Of course, we'll be covering this in more detail all of it tomorrow, 11am to 2pm central
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:52.440]  standard time with a weekday broadcast.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.960]  There's another way to fight the globalist, I don't, I can't think of any radio show
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:55.960]  more effective.
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:00.880]  Please spread the word about our show.
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.440]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.640]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:10.160]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:13.920]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:16.040]  of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:18.320]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:21.280]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:25.240]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:27.800]  a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:30.160]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:34.560]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:35.560]  resource.
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:39.840]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks,
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:40.840]  or metals.
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:45.440]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:46.440]  term.

[01:43:55.080 --> 01:44:22.600]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:24.440]  expanded nationwide.
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:28.720]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:30.520]  powerful shadow state.
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:34.520]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:39.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:44.840]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:48.320]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.360]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:51.360]  It's here.

[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:05.240]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:09.960]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:13.800]  of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:16.480]  anywhere in or on the body.
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:21.240]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:25.840]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:30.480]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:34.000]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:41.880]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:49.160]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:52.200]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:56.200]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.

[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:05.280]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:08.440]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:13.600]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:18.960]  I've turned a member's influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:19.960]  shots.
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:24.800]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:28.120]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:33.960]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:34.960]  world government.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:39.560]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:41.320]  saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:47.360]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:48.360]  of the Republic.
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:55.280]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now

[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:05.240]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:09.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:25.960]  OK, so here's some of the political news.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:30.240]  Rasmussen predicts GOP gain of 55 in the House.
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:33.240]  They may even win the Senate.
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:38.800]  Poll shows those craving for change now look to the GOP, kind of like they look to Obama.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:41.200]  But here's the good news.
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:47.720]  Pro-establishment Republicans in almost every primary have lost to people like Rand Paul.
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:53.920]  Pro-establishment Democrats like Spector have been losing to anti-establishment Democrats.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:58.400]  The Democrats are now running a whole bunch of them as anti-pollosy.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:01.560]  So they're running away from establishment types.
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:06.040]  This is a major political realignment.
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:12.640]  So here's the really scary news, Bill Clinton back on campaigning for everybody that helped
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:15.880]  Hillary run for president against Obama.
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:20.720]  And the Democrats are openly talking about Joe Biden at least stepping down, as you know
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:27.260]  in the last two weeks, and Hillary running for vice president, maybe even for president.
[01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:29.200]  Maybe even Obama not running.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:33.480]  Well, as bad as Obama is, and he's bad.
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:34.560]  This is Bill Clinton.
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:37.960]  This is, I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:39.960]  How dare you?
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:43.200]  How dare you?
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:46.000]  This is missile secrets to the Chinese.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.480]  This is the reported rapist.
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:52.760]  I mean, this guy, Hillary, total globalist, anti-guine, the original harbinger of government
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:54.920]  socialist healthcare.
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:55.920]  And this is the guy.
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:57.800]  I mean, this is what you explained about Hillary.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:00.080]  This is the guy and the lady.
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:04.120]  This is the dynamic duo, the co-president, Hillary Clinton, she's already been president
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:05.920]  once according to Bill.
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:10.880]  These are the people that honchoed through, not just NAFTA and GATT, but the end of Glass-Steagall
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:17.560]  that allowed the megabanks to create over a thousand trillion in fake counterfeit instruments,
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:20.960]  derivatives, credit default swaps, all of it.
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:25.160]  I mean, this is, oh, boy, yes, Democrats, Obama didn't deliver.
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:26.920]  Remember all those Obama supporters?
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:27.920]  Oh, thank you, president.
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:29.400]  I'll have to worry about my car payment.
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:32.360]  I'll have to worry about my house payment.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:36.040]  I don't have to, you know, worry about anything.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:37.040]  Everything's fixed as of Obama.
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:39.380]  Here you are a year and a half, almost two years later.
[01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:40.880]  Everything fixed for you?
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:42.560]  Answer is no.
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:50.080]  So they're really gearing up for that in a big way.
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:54.080]  Merkel says German multiculturalism has failed the country, Reuters.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:55.240]  Everybody's fighting with each other.
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:50:00.600]  The foreigners they brought in for reduced wages are destroying the infrastructure, and
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:02.880]  they're admitting it's destroying their country.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:07.960]  So that's just some of the news on that front, but they do make good voters to vote for socialism.
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:09.200]  So that's just some of the news there.
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:18.440]  And then four fuel depots shut down in Paris, reduced as French protests escalate.
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:23.480]  And in all these articles from Greece and Spain and everywhere, they're saying thousands
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:24.480]  are protesting.
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:29.120]  It's not thousands, it's millions per country, sometimes millions per city.
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:34.240]  Here example of how the media lies and manipulates in their hypocrisy when they go around and
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:40.120]  try to police the alternative media.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:42.360]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:47.800]  You know, I should I'd get into this today, and I covered it a lot Thursday and Friday.
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:49.960]  But government trains troops to run American cities.
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:57.040]  You can go read this Paul Joseph Watson prisonplanet.com article, and it links to ABC News 50.
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:00.480]  It links to the Army Times.
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:03.800]  You can just read it for yourself where they openly say the military is being trained for
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:08.160]  during a financial collapse to save America and stop protesters.
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:12.240]  Well, the military, I'm not going to say are bad people, but they've definitely been given
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:14.800]  illegal criminal missions overseas.
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:17.800]  And now the mission is going to be here domestically.
[01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:23.360]  They've already got DWI checkpoints run by Marines, the Army, all of this is to introduce
[01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:25.720]  troops on the streets of America.
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:29.240]  Their sign of what the banksters have done to this country.
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:33.280]  So you need to talk to everybody you know in the military and explain to them how serious
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:34.280]  this is.
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:37.040]  And everyone needs to see my film, Police State for the Rise of FEMA.
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:41.400]  I made my first three police state films, you know, going back over 10 years ago, but
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:48.480]  all my newest data is in the film, Police State for the Rise of FEMA, available at infowars.com.
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:51.800]  Let's go ahead now and let's talk to Drew in Minnesota.
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:53.800]  Drew, you're on the air.
[01:51:53.800 --> 01:52:03.240]  Alex, my example of hypocrisy is, if an individual files affidavits and courts that are contained
[01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:08.680]  falsehoods and fraud, typically they are in danger going to jail and having their case
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:14.320]  totally thrown out in court, what we have here is apparently hundreds of thousands
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:19.040]  of fraudulent affidavits have been used to foreclose a kick out of American families
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:20.040]  out of their home.
[01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:23.760]  There's actually nearing a million in the month of September, the latest numbers we
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:27.280]  have, 100,000 in one month.
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:29.840]  So it's over a million.
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:33.760]  And this, I think it's calling into question millions of real estate transactions that
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:37.760]  have occurred in the past several years, if the underlying documents are fraudulent.
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:41.840]  Yeah, that's why people always moved here, because in the U.S. you could get real clear
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:48.520]  title to property, but now that's all over, and the government, as passed the law, Obama
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:54.120]  has not signed it yet to allow banks to take any property they want with no paperwork.
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:56.000]  I mean, that's CNBC.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.160]  Does that sound like a free society to you?
[01:52:58.160 --> 01:52:59.720]  No, sir, it does not.
[01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:04.800]  Also one other quick point, are there derivatives contracts where they will massively profit
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:07.640]  if they lose money on a foreclosure sale?
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:13.080]  In other words, that's what I suspect is happening, is that they don't want these modifications
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:19.360]  to go through, because if they foreclose on the house and they lose a big paper loss,
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:24.160]  they can get derivatives winnings on that multiple times with properties worth.
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:29.120]  Well, we're going to have an expert in Wednesday for three hours on this, but they make money
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:30.800]  every angle you can imagine.
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:35.680]  I mean, they sell governments and institutions, this is on record, derivatives that don't
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:38.120]  even have property backed by them.
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:41.760]  That's why you'll have two, three in some cases banks trying to foreclose on the same
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:44.200]  house because they were all sold it.
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:48.840]  Look, when they announced two months ago, Bloomberg reported it, they admitted it in
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:53.280]  court, Prudential was just one company, that they signed a secret, and Prudential when
[01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:58.520]  they got caught in court, you know, headline, Prudential signed secret deal with Veterans
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:02.040]  Affairs to take death benefits.
[01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:06.960]  People pay insurance when they're in the military, if they get killed, or when they die later,
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:08.440]  that their widow's going to get the money.
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:12.840]  They take their life insurance and the government made the deal with them.
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:19.720]  I mean, folks, the government's so corrupt, I don't even have words to describe this,
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:20.720]  Drew.
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:24.240]  I mean, they're acting like they're invincible, like they can do anything, Drew.
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:29.240]  Yeah, it appears that way, and it appears that the government isn't doing much in response
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:30.240]  at this point.
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:34.200]  Actually, it's doing quite a bit, trying to pass a lot to say it's legal, and they're
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:37.160]  trying to, we second the fraud, we're all for it.
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:40.240]  All right, now look, I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine calls.
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:42.600]  There's no way to get to all of them, but I'll try.
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:44.880]  Victoria in Montana, you're on the air, Victoria.
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:45.880]  Hi, Alex.
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:46.880]  Hi.
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:51.680]  Can you, my double standard that I want to talk about, I had three, but I only talk
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:52.680]  about one.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:59.320]  The so-called child protective services illegally take babies from their parents to supposedly
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:05.320]  protect them, but yet the government forcefully take away our money in taxes to murder and
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:11.860]  kill babies through legalized abortions and then perform experiments on live conscious
[01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:18.720]  aborted babies and use them as resource materials for corporate products and profits.
[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:24.600]  By the way, that's on record, and for those with the John Irish baby, Thursday, the court
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:27.980]  ordered the baby released because it turned out they had a criminal record for another
[01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:29.240]  John Irish.
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:35.280]  That's a pretty common name in New Hampshire, a lot of Irish is in that area, and they have
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:39.920]  hypocrisy is I was watching Fox News Friday afternoon and they were still demonizing the
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:44.880]  Irish family saying they hope the CPS still takes the baby and saying nothing about the
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:48.160]  fact that they had the wrong guy on the paperwork.
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:49.680]  What do you think about that?
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:54.360]  They need to be shut down because they're corrupt and they need to have that Godlike
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:56:01.240]  power taken away from them and then have some new legal guidelines and procedures set up
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:06.480]  with them because they're out of control, and also the second part of that solution
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:13.480]  is to fire 95% of our out of control government and teach the other 5% the Constitution and
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:15.360]  make them follow it.
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:16.360]  Exactly.
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:19.800]  They are our employees, they are servants, not officials, authorities and tyranny is
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:24.760]  when your government gets out of control and starts robbing you and who can doubt Victoria
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:30.880]  that we've gotten to that situation and their response to us waking up to them is to start
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:33.160]  stealing 10 times faster.
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:34.160]  God bless you.
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:35.160]  Appreciate the call.
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:40.000]  And for those that don't know, they do on record in the U.S. and in China, keep aborted
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.480]  babies, third trimester alive, partial birth, they do keep them alive and do medical experiments
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:45.480]  on them.
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:47.920]  You can search that, but I guess you're bad if you're against that.
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:52.400]  It's like in Travis County, I've got to pay for abortions.
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:55.840]  Only counting it, I've got to pay for people to kill their babies, elective abortions,
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:57:00.840]  I've got to pay taxes, I pay for the hospital district, a whole new tax every year.
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:05.160]  From my little operation, Texas won't be a haven for business much longer, I'm here
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:11.520]  to tell you, and I've got to pay for babies to be murdered.
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:13.000]  And that's just the way it is.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.240]  And under the healthcare bill, it's in there, I got to pay for babies to be killed, but
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:18.240]  it gets better.
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:22.320]  Bill Gates is now outgoing, you bet, there's death panels and he tells teachers, you'll
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:25.160]  get 10 jobs if we kill Granny.
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:26.160]  Remember that?
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:28.720]  And the cover of Newsweek, the case for killing Granny.
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:33.440]  Once they get the wealth all under their control, then they all make us fight over it once it's
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:36.560]  been socialized, once it's been collectivized.
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:40.400]  We're out of time, sorry to all the other callers, back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central.
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:43.920]  Great job to the crew, just get out there and take on the new world order and spread
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:59.200]  the word about the radio show at infowars.com and all the stations you listen to it on.
