[00:00.000 --> 00:10.900]  Music
[00:30.000 --> 00:40.440]  It's hard to believe that it's another live transmission and here we are ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40.440 --> 00:47.520]  I'm coming to you from deep in the heart of Florida, actually right here in Southwestern
[00:47.520 --> 00:51.080]  Florida in Naples at Oak Farm Seed the Table.
[00:51.080 --> 00:55.920]  The great Alfie Oaks got it started this and I tell you you can wear a mask if you want.
[00:55.920 --> 00:57.800]  You don't have to wear a mask if you don't want to.
[00:57.800 --> 01:02.640]  It's a free country plus the mask don't protect you all the science shows plus the same number
[01:02.640 --> 01:07.200]  of people died in the year 2020 has died in 2019 roughly despite population increases.
[01:07.200 --> 01:12.520]  So here we are what I wish Texas was and I love my state.
[01:12.520 --> 01:17.080]  But hey the good example of Florida has got Texas doing the right thing now and South
[01:17.080 --> 01:23.720]  Dakota and Mississippi and Louisiana and a bunch of other states.
[01:23.720 --> 01:27.480]  But boy the leftist control freaks aren't letting people out from under their thumb
[01:27.480 --> 01:34.280]  in California or in New York or in New Jersey it's scary.
[01:34.280 --> 01:39.080]  So I hit this last hour and I don't normally repeat something from show to show but we
[01:39.080 --> 01:42.780]  have the mainstream media tuning in today and they were asking if I support violence
[01:42.780 --> 01:49.400]  and if I want to carry out violence against the vaccine pushers and all I said is as long
[01:49.400 --> 01:53.560]  as you don't try to force it on me don't try to assault me with your poison then I'm
[01:53.560 --> 01:57.760]  going to assault you but don't pretend it's not an assault don't pretend it's not a social
[01:57.760 --> 02:02.200]  control don't pretend it's not illegal and experimental and that you're not Joseph Ming
[02:02.200 --> 02:05.560]  Gala that the media that has bought into this isn't Joseph Ming Gala.
[02:05.560 --> 02:08.920]  So you're the ones that have become Joseph Ming Gala and violated every common sense
[02:08.920 --> 02:12.480]  law in the Geneva Convention and the Nuremberg Code.
[02:12.480 --> 02:16.560]  So you're the ones that have put us into this world.
[02:16.560 --> 02:19.680]  I'm just simply pointing out under the rules of common law and the rules of international
[02:19.680 --> 02:26.280]  law and the rules of common sense that tyranny is being implemented through the medical system
[02:26.280 --> 02:29.840]  and that it's big tech merging with it and trying to suppress people criticizing it
[02:29.840 --> 02:34.320]  but they can't hide the truth and a whole bunch of countries have banned these so-called
[02:34.320 --> 02:39.880]  vaccines and aren't vaccines and so everybody that's bought into this everybody that's
[02:39.880 --> 02:48.320]  selling this agenda whether they be Bill Gates whether they be people like Klaus Schwab
[02:48.320 --> 02:54.560]  or the Davos Group they're trying to sign our death warrants and they are trying to
[02:54.560 --> 02:58.880]  literally make us permanently ill so they can control our lives and extract wealth from
[02:58.880 --> 02:59.880]  us.
[02:59.880 --> 03:08.240]  They're soft killing the West looking at what that plan means and so they will be held
[03:08.240 --> 03:11.360]  accountable one way or another.
[03:11.360 --> 03:15.600]  I don't care if they get governments to pass laws giving them liability protection.
[03:15.600 --> 03:18.280]  Those governments are like why do you want protection and why is it causing all this
[03:18.280 --> 03:19.280]  brain damage?
[03:19.280 --> 03:20.360]  Why is it calling all this illness?
[03:20.360 --> 03:24.760]  So the mask or the symbol that we're dirty the mask or the symbol we're bad they're
[03:24.760 --> 03:29.360]  the symbol we're under a permanent emergency and they're the symbol that these UN overlords
[03:29.360 --> 03:34.920]  who died and made the United Nations God who died and put the United Nations in charge
[03:34.920 --> 03:40.080]  of our health care who put Bill Gates in charge of our health care and the answer is no one
[03:40.080 --> 03:44.680]  but themselves they went on and bought up all the major governments the advisory groups
[03:44.680 --> 03:50.640]  the WHO they're all on record owned by Big Pharma and the consortium is led by Bill Gates
[03:50.640 --> 03:56.280]  these are not doctors these are genetic engineer companies that want to own the human genome
[03:56.280 --> 04:01.640]  and want to put their products into our body and want to set the precedent to have gene
[04:01.640 --> 04:06.600]  therapy not go through any type of animal or human trials but go direct to market with
[04:06.600 --> 04:11.600]  the population and I'm somebody that's always saying you let the FDA get out of the way
[04:11.600 --> 04:15.840]  of people in medicine if folks want to gamble and they're adults I want to do an experimental
[04:15.840 --> 04:20.120]  thing I think that's fine but you don't do it where it's mandated and you don't do it
[04:20.120 --> 04:25.280]  where it's forced on children or babies especially when all the studies show the drug they're
[04:25.280 --> 04:30.760]  pushing the medical device that is the mRNA vaccines are not vaccines do not protect you
[04:30.760 --> 04:37.600]  and are deadly and when we come back I'll show you the current breaking mainstream news
[04:37.600 --> 04:42.920]  you know we we transferred videos a few days ago of me covering this just our own servers
[04:42.920 --> 04:46.920]  but because the Wi-Fi wasn't working well and the encoders were better on YouTube we
[04:46.920 --> 04:52.200]  used YouTube to transfer videos not even for publishing they gave strikes to my crew and
[04:52.200 --> 04:56.040]  wouldn't let it even transfer over because they scan what was being said and all I was
[04:56.040 --> 04:59.080]  doing was reading mainstream news articles they wouldn't even let people know about that
[04:59.080 --> 05:04.240]  every product you hear me on air advertising we have it stocked in our warehouse in Austin
[05:04.240 --> 05:09.240]  Texas every product so if you order it you've got it shipped out in a couple days sometimes
[05:09.240 --> 05:13.480]  the same day let's just get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that the
[05:13.480 --> 05:19.400]  supply chain's breaking down and its future orders its product we're trying to reorder
[05:19.400 --> 05:25.120]  to get back in that we're having trouble with I mean I'm talking about double triple quadruple
[05:25.120 --> 05:30.880]  delivery times and it's across not just the supplement vitamin mineral industry it's across
[05:30.880 --> 05:37.520]  every industry so the globalists have successfully devastated the economy that's why I'm saying
[05:37.520 --> 05:41.000]  you need to visit infoarstore.com today and get high quality stuff close while you still
[05:41.000 --> 05:47.120]  can and storeable food at infoarstore.com because we have it in stock it's ready to ship but
[05:47.120 --> 05:52.160]  with the supply chain breakdowns prices are going up availability is going down and it's
[05:52.160 --> 05:57.240]  just crazy so please get products while you still can and support the infoar store.com
[05:57.240 --> 06:25.240]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[06:25.240 --> 06:34.560]  Ladies and gentlemen it is Wednesday, March 10th the year is 2021 I'm your host Alex
[06:34.560 --> 06:40.360]  Jones coming to you live from southwestern Florida oak farm seed to table the greatest
[06:40.360 --> 06:44.400]  grocery store in the world not just super high quality not just great people not just
[06:44.400 --> 06:49.920]  a great human feeling and a great vibe but also led by Alfie Oaks the owner who started
[06:49.920 --> 06:56.000]  all by himself got three great grocery stores the last 30 years saying underwear mask in
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.320]  my store and now the phenomenon is sweeping not just the country but the world but let
[07:01.320 --> 07:07.000]  me hit this first okay because I mentioned this when I was hosting part of the American
[07:07.000 --> 07:13.960]  Journal earlier today with the great Harrison Smith but here on the Alex Jones show I want
[07:13.960 --> 07:21.200]  to answer the question of Craig Timberg from the Washington Post he said I'm working on
[07:21.200 --> 07:28.320]  a story about QAnon to paraphrase it and you say QAnon's full of bologna but QAnon says
[07:28.320 --> 07:32.480]  vaccines are dangerous and that these are experimental and so do you want to disavow
[07:32.480 --> 07:37.600]  that basically QAnon can say the sky's blue I agree with them a lot of the QAnon followers
[07:37.600 --> 07:41.960]  are good people it was those that started it wanted to discredit the anti-globalist movement
[07:41.960 --> 07:46.560]  by putting hard dates in and then saying things like Tom Hanks is secretly in prison with
[07:46.560 --> 07:51.520]  Hillary Clinton to then confuse the public to go oh there's no new world order there's
[07:51.520 --> 07:56.320]  no Jeffrey Epstein there's no move to get rid of your borders to collapse your economy
[07:56.320 --> 08:00.120]  there's no move to inject you with dangerous drugs calling them vaccines no no no that's
[08:00.120 --> 08:04.040]  all QAnon the whole global awakening to the new world order just happened three years
[08:04.040 --> 08:12.480]  ago and QAnon owns it all so no I don't endorse QAnon but at the same time yeah people are
[08:12.480 --> 08:16.760]  going to take clips that I put out and put them on QAnon boards that anybody can honestly
[08:16.760 --> 08:21.000]  put out I think that's great because I'll educate the QAnon crowd about what's real
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.480]  conspiracy and real globalism and real tyranny and what isn't and I'll give you exhibits
[08:26.480 --> 08:33.880]  and real dates and real times to document it they also again take out a context where
[08:33.880 --> 08:39.440]  I said I am not for violence do not go out do not be violent but as a father as a human
[08:39.440 --> 08:42.940]  I watch secret experimentation the Tuskegee experiment giving tens of thousands of black
[08:42.940 --> 08:47.240]  syphilis letting them die of it I watched radiation experiments on poor white kids poor
[08:47.240 --> 08:53.600]  black kids you name it by the U.S. government killing them I see secret syphilis test on
[08:53.600 --> 08:58.640]  children in Peru and I think the people that did that deserve to be arrested tried put
[08:58.640 --> 09:04.880]  in prison and the jury said so executed and so that's the Nuremberg code that's the Geneva
[09:04.880 --> 09:10.680]  Convention that's what we set out in law before World War II but after World War II because
[09:10.680 --> 09:20.240]  of the angel of death Joseph Mengele the aristocrat nobility Nazi and much of his ideas got picked
[09:20.240 --> 09:25.320]  up in Russia they got picked up here you picked up a lot of eugenics ideas so yes I believe
[09:25.320 --> 09:29.440]  that when governments and corporations people like Bill Gates behave like Joseph Mengele
[09:29.440 --> 09:34.440]  and offensively attack us and get governments to pass laws saying they have liability protection
[09:34.440 --> 09:39.400]  with experimental vaccines that have been directly linked to death and disease and collapse
[09:39.400 --> 09:43.760]  and now they want to give it to foster children that are newborn when they don't have a right
[09:43.760 --> 09:48.320]  to say no to experimental vaccine an experimental vaccine the U.S. military won't even make
[09:48.320 --> 09:52.520]  the troops take because they know it's so deadly an experimental vaccine that one week
[09:52.520 --> 09:56.440]  after they started it two months ago in England they said three groups shouldn't take it above
[09:56.440 --> 10:03.800]  75 under 16 and pregnant women because it causes miscarriages it causes the old to die
[10:03.800 --> 10:09.240]  at a disproportionate level and that's coming out across the land so yes we do have a right
[10:09.240 --> 10:15.640]  to defend ourselves from someone coming with a poison needle someone coming with a with
[10:15.640 --> 10:22.120]  a club a gun someone coming to starve us to burn our farm we have an inalible right in
[10:22.120 --> 10:28.160]  the Declaration of Independence enshrined by common sense and by God's law to stand against
[10:28.160 --> 10:33.880]  the eugenicists and the sick able to populationists that are controlling this whole takeover do
[10:33.880 --> 10:40.680]  answer your question Craig Timberg I'm talking about we have a right and we're being assaulted
[10:40.680 --> 10:44.480]  and the Nuremberg Code the human convention is being violated and common sense is being
[10:44.480 --> 10:48.120]  violated and we're being censored that when you now say you're going to come for us one
[10:48.120 --> 10:53.760]  way or not and forcibly inject us or keep us in prison you've now crossed the Rubicon
[10:53.760 --> 11:06.440]  Mr. Timberg Mr. Gates Mr. Klaus Schwab so let me give you and that's the last track
[11:06.440 --> 11:12.080]  it's fine there are some folks clapping you only hear some people clap down there at least
[11:12.080 --> 11:17.880]  we tell you when it's fake laughing never done before it's a joke now here's a few headlines
[11:17.880 --> 11:21.600]  for you from your all-powerful godlike mainstream media when they're just normalizing awesome
[11:21.600 --> 11:26.640]  like Bill Gates said yes 700,000 will get sick or die yeah 80% will have bad reactions
[11:26.640 --> 11:33.240]  I quote that in Instagram takes it down just fake news only the Lord Bill Gates who pays
[11:33.240 --> 11:40.640]  for the news can quote him Johnson and Johnson plan vaccine trials include infants now approved
[11:40.640 --> 11:45.920]  turning heads of scientists saying this experimental they don't have informed consent well don't

[12:16.360 --> 12:20.600]  not true of course it is true but Bill Gates is God right same guy says he wants to populate
[12:20.600 --> 12:23.600]  the earth and give it old people but now he wants you to take a shot he's banned in 30

[13:29.600 --> 13:35.200]  criminal the house of cards are going to come down that's why Merck two months ago pulled
[13:35.200 --> 13:38.960]  out of it and said the vaccines are dangerous and they don't protect you oh and I've got
[13:38.960 --> 13:44.600]  articles on that South Africa suspense use the vaster zenica COVID-19 vaccine effort

[14:21.800 --> 14:28.240]  portion of the teachers are home sick 64% reported having some kind of side effect 28% of the
[14:28.240 --> 14:34.040]  side effects made them feel too poorly to go to work but that's okay Sasha Barrett Cohen
[14:34.040 --> 14:39.440]  who makes us living off satire says you shouldn't be allowed to criticize Bill Gates anyway
[14:39.440 --> 14:44.160]  what about this proud medical doctor she was pregnant wasn't approved for pregnant women
[14:44.160 --> 14:51.160]  but she took the shot and lost her baby then Stein took the mRNA vaccine or almost died
[14:51.160 --> 14:56.080]  but he said it's okay he's proud of what he did but he said have it actually watch out
[14:56.080 --> 15:03.000]  because everybody knows the dice are loaded everybody knows the captain lied everybody
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.880]  knows but people won't say because you don't want to get censored because you're just a
[15:07.880 --> 15:11.960]  Washington Post if you say I don't want to take your vaccine you're bad if I don't wear
[15:11.960 --> 15:16.000]  your mask you're bad you say hey all these studies show off Japanese supercomputers the
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.720]  mass don't make it better they make it worse but bacterial pneumonia and carbon monoxide
[15:19.720 --> 15:24.120]  poisoning carbon dioxide poisoning but they don't care they just want you to sit down
[15:24.120 --> 15:29.440]  and shut up because what they're doing is with fine print admitting they're killing everybody
[15:29.440 --> 15:33.920]  but then if you try to share it on Facebook or Twitter all these headlines that's thousands
[15:33.920 --> 15:39.000]  of these all these countries banning it they go oh no that's not a medical doctor or that's
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.720]  not the UN only the UN or Bill Gates can tell you about the vaccine it's not a vaccine it's
[15:44.720 --> 15:49.400]  a takeover and the tide is turning thanks to great folks in Florida and other states

[20:38.320 --> 20:43.280]  collapsing the third world starting the third world and using the refugees the third world
[20:43.280 --> 20:48.840]  to politically overtake and destroy the first world this is modern warfare and the sooner
[20:48.840 --> 20:55.480]  we realize this is modern warfare we're under attack the sooner we can turn the tide against
[20:55.480 --> 21:00.160]  this situation i just want to say all the great listeners that have flooded in here i love
[21:00.160 --> 21:07.320]  you and i appreciate you this is awesome real chair in there so a lot of folks here and
[21:07.320 --> 21:11.160]  i'm going to do an interview they got set up the same time somewhere offside or maybe
[21:11.160 --> 21:14.320]  not an interview i'm gonna talk to somebody and i'm gonna come back a couple hours in
[21:14.320 --> 21:22.520]  it and host the the war room but but seriously i go back to this tom papper is going to take
[21:22.520 --> 21:27.480]  over the no one's on later this craig timber is not the worst the mainstream media he's
[21:27.480 --> 21:31.800]  quoted me a few times actually quoted me i mean the pieces are negative and skewed and
[21:31.800 --> 21:36.240]  even his questions aren't leaving in where i've said do not be violent do not go out
[21:36.240 --> 21:40.160]  and be offensive it's like martin wither king was being hit in the head with a billy club
[21:40.160 --> 21:43.760]  he could say hey i feel like being violent back but i'm being like bahamut gondi or
[21:43.760 --> 21:50.960]  jesus i'm i'm doing non nonviolent disobedience but there comes a time when you are being
[21:50.960 --> 21:55.120]  assaulted when you are being attacked you have a right to resist yourself especially
[21:55.120 --> 21:59.920]  when you've exhausted all the other means i'm just saying we're being assaulted we're
[21:59.920 --> 22:05.320]  being attacked by eugenics borg who tell their adherence the injustice the means we're saving
[22:05.320 --> 22:11.120]  more people than we're losing by doing this they admit that to them i talked to high level
[22:11.120 --> 22:14.760]  federal and high level state health department will admit okay jones they do admit the vaccines
[22:14.760 --> 22:18.520]  are causing autism and brain damage all these problems well that came out in two thousand
[22:18.520 --> 22:23.720]  in abc news with a whole cdc meeting where they leaked the meetings to congress admitting
[22:23.720 --> 22:28.520]  that they cost tens of thousands of kids to be autistic and all sorts of neurological
[22:28.520 --> 22:33.520]  disorders and all sorts of serious problems this is real and now they want to give these
[22:33.520 --> 22:38.760]  experimental vaccines banned in all these different countries to newborn babies that have authorized
[22:38.760 --> 22:43.720]  it because dr biden signed an executive order last week for johnson and johnson that's a
[22:43.720 --> 22:52.360]  dangerous called military virus vector vector virus vaccine no one takes things they're
[22:52.360 --> 22:58.600]  super dangerous it's beyond mrna it uses a virus to invade and reprogram the whole
[22:58.600 --> 23:04.120]  cell in the mitochondria and create this spike protein quote so your body resists the
[23:04.120 --> 23:09.040]  regular virus but that regular virus is everywhere and in the placenta and all the medical literature
[23:09.040 --> 23:14.640]  says it's going to cause autoimmune response that's lupus that's when your body attacks
[23:14.640 --> 23:20.600]  its own organs so they have a larger in game here to devastate us economically to weigh
[23:20.600 --> 23:26.480]  us down medically to collapse our free market civilization by making so many of us sick in
[23:26.480 --> 23:31.680]  vietnam one reason they say they chose the smaller five five six round you can say it's
[23:31.680 --> 23:36.880]  a lifestyle but it's true is because it would hit people in tumble and wouldn't kill them
[23:36.880 --> 23:40.840]  a lot of times it would really maim them really bad it was also easy to carry a lot of and
[23:40.840 --> 23:45.960]  so you had a soft kill now whether that was true or not this soft kill idea today is absolutely
[23:45.960 --> 23:50.160]  true if they can hurt people in your family and then have you have to take care of them
[23:50.160 --> 23:55.280]  forever and weigh them down and make them quote not productive at a certain point when
[23:55.280 --> 23:58.920]  there's enough people that they say aren't productive the socialists and say we've got
[23:58.920 --> 24:06.000]  to get rid of the non productive so that's the larger plan what's going on wrong oh five
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.760]  minutes mark great yeah i've got a clock thank you i appreciate it i just thought something
[24:09.760 --> 24:14.280]  else might be happening fru's doing a great job by the way so so so let me play something
[24:14.280 --> 24:18.720]  else for the washington post because this is a real lady to die and you know stolam
[24:18.720 --> 24:23.440]  said one man dies it's a tragedy two thousand guys statistic every day i probably see fifty
[24:23.440 --> 24:29.600]  articles of young people dying right after the vaccine so here's this nice lady she's
[24:29.600 --> 24:35.080]  having a great life young beautiful lady and she's dead and the coroner is now investigating
[24:35.080 --> 24:38.760]  what's going on and you know there's been major pressure should have come to bear and
[24:38.760 --> 24:42.800]  this is a whole bunch of people in one area of utah dying we only know about the hospitals
[24:42.800 --> 24:46.400]  in the nursing homes where so many died in the hospital nursing home they go ahead and
[24:46.400 --> 24:52.800]  file a report with a federal body since the eighties makes it all secret what came in
[24:52.800 --> 24:57.880]  in the reports so it's secret they have liability protection multi-national corporations are
[24:57.880 --> 25:01.600]  doing it a lot of the vaccines are made in china bill gate says he wants to kill you
[25:01.600 --> 25:06.000]  and your family wants to depopulate you but he also wants to put some of your body what
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.120]  could go wrong and now it is going wrong we know what's happening so let's go ahead ladies
[25:11.120 --> 25:16.640]  and gentlemen and play a clip of the modern form of human sacrifice on the altar of medical
[25:16.640 --> 25:21.400]  tyranny here it is okay last week we brought you an investigation of the covid vaccine
[25:21.400 --> 25:27.400]  side effects and where to report them during that investigation we found four reported
[25:27.400 --> 25:32.840]  deaths filed by utah families and their caregivers one particular case stood out to us a thirty
[25:32.840 --> 25:37.720]  nine-year-old single mom from octin with no known pre-existing conditions her family sat
[25:37.720 --> 25:41.600]  down with me this weekend as they were saying their final goodbyes and when they're not
[25:41.600 --> 25:50.520]  against the vaccine they do believe information is power as we all make our own medical decisions
[25:50.520 --> 25:58.000]  i really didn't cry when my dad died i cry a lot for her and i'm at a stage in my life
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.400]  where i'm okay with that alfred holly is a retired fighter pilot a military man who's
[26:03.400 --> 26:09.040]  known risk and loss and taken it all in stride until now she's the one that had promised
[26:09.040 --> 26:13.360]  to take care of me when i was old the death of his youngest daughter cassidy came out
[26:13.360 --> 26:19.920]  of nowhere four days after her second dose of the covid vaccine she came in early and
[26:19.920 --> 26:24.960]  said that her heart was racing cassidy and her nine-year-old daughter lived with her
[26:24.960 --> 26:33.840]  parents she got sick right away soreness at the shot location then she started getting
[26:33.840 --> 26:41.800]  sick then she started complaining that she was drinking lots of fluids but she couldn't
[26:41.800 --> 26:48.520]  pee and and then she felt a little bit better the next day cassidy was a surgical tack for
[26:48.520 --> 26:55.080]  plastic surgeon and stepped up to get the shot without hesitation it was absolutely fine
[26:55.080 --> 27:00.720]  with getting a sheet in fact she was okay so let's stop right there it's fine you notice
[27:00.720 --> 27:04.920]  they had to do the provisos of oh we're not saying we're against it she stepped up and
[27:04.920 --> 27:08.320]  that's how they're gonna get us i was told this by top globalist off record as you know
[27:08.320 --> 27:13.240]  i've told you a thousand times who he is without record but he said listen you're gonna adapt
[27:13.240 --> 27:17.760]  to us killing you you're not gonna adapt and resist this you're gonna say step up like
[27:17.760 --> 27:22.200]  what up the kids have cancer now let's just step up why is everybody have neurological
[27:22.200 --> 27:27.280]  disorders let's just step up why are so many dying after the shot let's just hey let's
[27:27.280 --> 27:32.320]  be tough like the military hey guys i mean i've got so many people i know in the military
[27:32.320 --> 27:36.400]  were 10 percent of their platoon would be in the hospital after they got experimental
[27:36.400 --> 27:42.200]  shots and water too would die my grandmother was told she got polio from the polio vaccine
[27:42.200 --> 27:48.760]  from her doctor there are two people in our office right now they get mad if i say that
[27:48.760 --> 27:54.560]  even too much about it whose children died from the vaccines they were both in the military
[27:54.560 --> 28:01.880]  took vaccines at the military base i have family that had convulsions and got narcolepsy
[28:01.880 --> 28:08.000]  after they took a tetanus shot in the 1970s on medications for the rest of their lives
[28:08.000 --> 28:15.240]  i can't swing a stick in my office and not hit somebody who had somebody die from it
[28:15.240 --> 28:21.200]  and you sit here and you tell me that it's raining when you're pissing in my face so
[28:21.200 --> 28:26.960]  yeah craig timberg it's gonna be a time when your kids gotta take it or you gotta take
[28:26.960 --> 28:33.120]  it you're paralyzed and nobody's gonna care about you when it's happening you understand
[28:33.120 --> 28:36.560]  this isn't like the old fashioned vaccines they could put cancer viruses in or they could
[28:36.560 --> 28:43.280]  give you polio with it this is a full takeover of society so his baby daughter is dead now
[28:43.280 --> 28:48.880]  and her nine year old daughter doesn't have a mommy now ever she took that second shot
[28:48.880 --> 28:54.800]  just like hank erin so yeah you're assaulting us big text assaulting us watching poses assaulting
[28:54.800 --> 28:59.600]  us and we're sick and tired of it stop hurting us i'm not gonna sit here and waste your time
[28:59.600 --> 29:06.720]  or my time and rattle off the successes and full versus head if you're paying attention you know
[29:06.720 --> 29:14.000]  we've done together but i'll tell you this the technocrats are really upping their game
[29:14.560 --> 29:19.600]  and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media they're trying to shutter and
[29:19.600 --> 29:25.200]  signals of human resistance so now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about
[29:25.200 --> 29:29.760]  has been proven accurate everything you warned your friends and family about us around to be true so
[29:29.760 --> 29:35.520]  it's now that your credibility is way up the power structures of the silence those of us that they
[29:35.520 --> 29:43.760]  can't but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us we have the power but the sun
[29:43.760 --> 29:49.680]  is setting on humanity and setting on free speech we have to make sure that we fight hard right now
[29:49.680 --> 29:58.160]  to make sure that long dark night doesn't come so be the polar bears you are
[29:58.800 --> 30:04.800]  humanity has been domesticated by and large the population has been trained to submit do what
[30:04.800 --> 30:09.840]  you're told it's all gonna pass but if you study authoritarians if you say the globalists you
[30:09.840 --> 30:14.160]  understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point
[30:14.160 --> 30:19.040]  of being cold being totally enslaved and because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid
[30:19.040 --> 30:23.200]  they are now making that move and they are collapsing the third world with their economic
[30:23.200 --> 30:29.280]  weapons to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us
[30:29.280 --> 30:34.960]  under such a crisis under such a load capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign
[30:34.960 --> 30:41.200]  hoping that they will stop the blood of tens of millions of refugees not fleeing COVID or climate
[30:41.200 --> 30:46.720]  change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying but fleeing the year-long
[30:46.720 --> 30:52.560]  lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more
[30:52.560 --> 30:58.480]  IMF and World Bank money and that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists
[30:58.480 --> 31:04.000]  the general public has finally figured out why i'm upset they figured out the globalists are
[31:04.000 --> 31:08.960]  literally trying to kill us they're trying to take over civilization and society and they
[31:08.960 --> 31:14.800]  depend on the public being ignorant that's what jesus said my people perish for lack of knowledge
[31:14.800 --> 31:20.320]  knowledge is power like our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems
[31:20.320 --> 31:25.520]  that die without essential vitamins and minerals and that's why they don't want you to know about
[31:25.520 --> 31:29.520]  essential vitamins and minerals because it's so simple because you won't be under their control
[31:29.520 --> 31:35.040]  anymore well the vitamin mineral fusion the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out there
[31:35.040 --> 31:39.760]  in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock at info wars tour dot com and it's not just an

[32:03.440 --> 32:07.520]  has happened just like we said it would and now we have a lot of credibility but i don't care about
[32:07.520 --> 32:11.600]  that i care about beating the new world order and it's because we have so much credibility
[32:11.600 --> 32:16.000]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer and i don't have time to tell you all the stuff
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.480]  they're doing to us for a lot of reasons i can't tell you what's going on but let's just say this
[32:20.480 --> 32:25.440]  we're going to see this through the end we're going to stay on air as long as we can so please
[32:25.440 --> 32:29.600]  pray for us and please buy the products and then for our store dot com they're great products

[32:34.240 --> 32:38.400]  do they fund freedom no a lot of them don't these are great products that fund freedom
[32:38.400 --> 32:43.600]  and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth that's why the globalist
[32:43.600 --> 32:47.840]  are censoring they can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air
[32:47.840 --> 32:51.920]  so while you're at it don't just financially support us and spread the word download everything
[32:51.920 --> 32:55.840]  we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[32:55.840 --> 32:58.240]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said
[32:58.240 --> 33:04.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:14.480 --> 33:20.320]  ladies and gentlemen alex jones has left the building but he will be returning here
[33:21.840 --> 33:24.960]  before the alex jones show concludes and of course he will be
[33:24.960 --> 33:31.680]  hosting the war room as well today normally my hosting duty is three to six p.m so a lot happening
[33:31.680 --> 33:36.640]  here uh a lot coming from alex jones a lot happening here at info wars today you know it's
[33:36.640 --> 33:44.640]  incredible i have this whole desk full of news right now that i'm going to be covering in the next
[33:44.640 --> 33:55.440]  two and a half hours or so on the alex jones show and it's quite a common conundrum here where perhaps
[33:55.440 --> 34:03.120]  the biggest story of all and and i had to omit it from my news and that's part of the challenge here
[34:03.120 --> 34:10.000]  every day is that if you don't have the background and the context of everything we're laying out
[34:10.000 --> 34:18.480]  it's hard to understand it's hard to comprehend but i had to omit it's not even in my stack
[34:18.480 --> 34:30.720]  and so i'm just carrying it from memory now global food prices are skyrocketing global food prices
[34:30.720 --> 34:42.320]  are skyrocketing kind of a big deal kind of a telltale of what's to come
[34:45.120 --> 34:51.040]  and when you see these graphs it's like double triple food prices in the last six months
[34:51.040 --> 35:01.600]  now again we here at info wars have been warning about this for a year
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.280]  it was only inevitable and when you read things from the un
[35:11.840 --> 35:17.920]  like what they put out today are we building back better
[35:17.920 --> 35:22.560]  it's officially from the un's website and they have some conference going on
[35:26.480 --> 35:32.720]  and this is from the story here from the un's official website are we building back better
[35:34.400 --> 35:39.280]  the global economy contracted by nearly four percent in 2020 wow that's quite a
[35:39.280 --> 35:42.880]  chunk that's quite a rip out of the free market that the globalist ate there isn't it
[35:42.880 --> 35:51.920]  internationally more than two million people died uh that's about normal and a planet of
[35:51.920 --> 36:01.440]  six plus billion so okay so what is that less than a percent which again ask anybody ask the
[36:01.440 --> 36:06.160]  scientists ask the demo whoever's promoting the whole covid shutdown when does the pandemic end
[36:06.160 --> 36:13.200]  and the only response they've really ever committed to which is which is not even a full commit
[36:14.320 --> 36:19.280]  is oh we need a certain percentage of the community to be vaccinated well okay like
[36:19.280 --> 36:24.000]  they said 70 in austin so we need 70 of texas vaccinated before we can open and then the
[36:24.000 --> 36:30.240]  pandemic's over well what if 70 of the people don't want to take a vaccine then what see
[36:30.240 --> 36:36.240]  your totalitarians your tyrants your fascists you're making me consume someone's product
[36:36.240 --> 36:46.400]  that i don't want that's fascism but if you're logically arguing it okay well let's say the
[36:46.400 --> 36:52.880]  pandemic is over when we have a drop off and a return to normal in the death rate
[36:52.880 --> 37:02.000]  oops can't say that the death rate never went up and then once you realize that you realize
[37:02.000 --> 37:09.120]  there was no pandemic to begin with but i go on because this is the big lie
[37:11.520 --> 37:17.440]  three planetary crises loom again this is from are we building back better after covid which was
[37:17.440 --> 37:25.200]  their entire synthetic shutdown to build back better abscond with all the trillions that the
[37:25.200 --> 37:32.400]  international crime cabal has has stolen from the people of this planet and then as all as the third
[37:32.400 --> 37:36.480]  world collapses as even the first world is collapsing into the third world because it's
[37:36.480 --> 37:41.520]  there running away with all the wealth and then to blame it on a virus or blame it on you for
[37:41.520 --> 37:46.080]  climate change and then say don't worry we'll take care you will build back better so they come
[37:46.080 --> 37:51.440]  into your house they destroy your home they steal everything from your home they burn it to the ground
[37:51.440 --> 37:55.440]  and then they say don't worry about that that's your fault we'll build back better
[37:57.040 --> 37:59.360]  they're building a cage they're building a prison for us
[38:01.200 --> 38:07.920]  and they say three planetary crises loom climate instability somehow that's from covid
[38:08.640 --> 38:15.040]  nature loss even though they're saying that because we sat down from covid um we're stopping
[38:15.040 --> 38:21.040]  global warming of course they don't actually uh really promote that because the forestation
[38:21.040 --> 38:28.640]  comes from the carbon and then they say increasing levels of pollution now again they don't actually
[38:28.640 --> 38:38.720]  cite any statistics or or measurable data for their so-called planetary crises
[38:38.720 --> 38:47.600]  oh but they do show you how the economy is tanking right now because of the pandemic except that's
[38:47.600 --> 38:53.840]  the big lie it's not because of the pandemic it's because of them they shut the economy down
[38:54.640 --> 39:00.240]  they crash the global economy they're making food prices skyrocket three times as much as
[39:00.240 --> 39:06.960]  they were a year prior they are and they're blaming a virus this is governments doing this this is
[39:06.960 --> 39:12.240]  local governments run by democrats state governments run by democrats the federal government run by
[39:12.240 --> 39:19.040]  democrats and the global corporate government run by liberals they did this they did this to us
[39:19.040 --> 39:24.320]  they did this to the planet and they covered it up that it came out of wuhan they covered it up
[39:24.320 --> 39:34.880]  that this is a chinese communist virus the red death but it's incredible because you go and
[39:34.880 --> 39:41.440]  you talk to these liberals and they complain about it all and they blame the virus fully
[39:41.440 --> 39:50.160]  propagandized fully indoctrinated into the big lie a virus did this to the planet did a virus
[39:50.160 --> 39:56.320]  show up at your door and tell you to shut down did a virus show up and and decide that we were
[39:56.320 --> 40:00.720]  going to skyrocket food prices worldwide was that a virus must have been a virus that made me wear
[40:00.720 --> 40:06.800]  a mask to the virus told me to wear a mask it's now mind control virus no that was governments
[40:10.640 --> 40:17.200]  so it's all coming to fruition you have all these global leaders like biden many other
[40:17.200 --> 40:25.040]  democrats boris johnson uh angela merkel justin trudeau the list goes on they all say build back
[40:25.040 --> 40:32.160]  better build back better build back better they are parroting the un new world order slogan
[40:33.600 --> 40:37.360]  run by the globalist criminal cabal that has robbed this planet
[40:38.320 --> 40:47.360]  blind stolen the prosperity from humans taking it all for themselves and now when a break
[40:47.360 --> 40:51.520]  breakaway civilization putting you into a cage on a prison planet
[40:51.520 --> 41:00.000]  where a headline of a virus will shut you back down and take away all of your freedoms and that's
[41:00.000 --> 41:09.120]  where we're at and you have the left in america that absolutely loves it and today was supposed
[41:09.120 --> 41:16.080]  to be the first day for texas to be 100 percent reopen and lift the mask mandate i was doing
[41:16.080 --> 41:24.240]  a few errands this morning not wearing my mask like good american free american a man that breathes
[41:24.880 --> 41:34.800]  air wild concept and i noticed that the liberals are wearing their mask now with even more pride
[41:35.440 --> 41:40.240]  than they did before and since there is no mandate now even though the local mayor i'm
[41:40.240 --> 41:44.080]  going to cover this in the next segment says no we still have a mandate uh there's this
[41:44.080 --> 41:48.400]  unelected doctor that i'm giving uh in charge of your body i'll have that coming up in the next
[41:48.400 --> 41:54.080]  segment but now it's officially a statement to wear the mask so now they wear that mask and they
[41:54.080 --> 42:00.560]  have a they have a a look in their eye and their chest is pumped out and they are the mighty they
[42:00.560 --> 42:06.080]  are the mighty virtue signalers they care about humans you don't you're a scumbag that breathes
[42:06.080 --> 42:09.680]  air they're an alien that breathes carbon dioxide to kill themselves i guess that's the ultimate
[42:09.680 --> 42:13.520]  thing here a big giant suicide breathe your own carbon emissions that they say are killing the
[42:13.520 --> 42:17.840]  planet to kill yourself and then save the planet of course that's not what is actually going through
[42:17.840 --> 42:23.840]  their head maybe if they could think they'd realize that's what's actually happening but
[42:23.840 --> 42:29.280]  they're wearing it and they are so happy that they can finally make that statement and their chest
[42:29.280 --> 42:36.480]  is out and their chin is up and if they see you without your mask on they glare in your direction
[42:36.480 --> 42:44.160]  wow you're not making a statement you're not fighting against the pandemic you're
[42:44.160 --> 42:52.080]  not trying to save my grandma wow you can think for yourself you want to breathe oxygen

[47:27.920 --> 47:35.280]  texas and some of the other developments in other states but you know i this is such an unbelievable
[47:35.280 --> 47:41.680]  thing we're witnessing here and i know that you consciously understand this just as i consciously
[47:41.680 --> 47:48.160]  understand this but it's facing it and like re consuming it it's like every time you eat a
[47:48.160 --> 47:55.280]  filet mignon boy that that oh you're like man this is good well every time i read about the un and
[47:55.280 --> 48:04.800]  build back better and and see all the signs you thought it was the end of the mass mandate but
[48:04.800 --> 48:09.840]  the democrats came around and said hey you're not free buddy you don't get to breathe clean air
[48:10.960 --> 48:14.080]  by the way don't you know carbon emissions are killing the planet and we're taking all your money
[48:14.080 --> 48:18.400]  during this covid pandemic so we say we're taking all your money to fight climate change because of
[48:18.400 --> 48:21.760]  carbon emissions but we're making you breathe in your own carbon emissions with the mass i mean
[48:21.760 --> 48:27.600]  folks if this isn't total clown world if this isn't the most insane time to ever be alive in human
[48:27.600 --> 48:32.240]  history i really don't know what is i mean this is total insanity carbon emissions are killing the
[48:32.240 --> 48:36.160]  planet so we're going to take all the money from the covid pandemic that was supposed to go to you
[48:36.160 --> 48:40.320]  because we starved you out and now you can't pay your rent but no we're going to take that to fight
[48:40.320 --> 48:44.480]  climate change somehow uh you know some piece of paper is going to fight climate change and uh but
[48:44.480 --> 48:48.800]  the climate change is happening because of you and you excel carbon into the atmosphere but we
[48:48.800 --> 48:54.720]  want to put a mask on your face so that you can suck in all your carbon emissions this is actually
[48:54.720 --> 49:00.240]  the world that we're supposed to be living in and they expect us not to go insane or ask questions
[49:00.240 --> 49:07.280]  but they think we're all stupid see here's what i realized today actually i realized this the other
[49:07.280 --> 49:16.720]  day but this is true the age old question is a liberal dumber than iraq is a modern day liberal
[49:16.720 --> 49:24.960]  dumber than iraq the answer is yes because iraq is neutral iraq is not wrong iraq is just an inanimate
[49:24.960 --> 49:30.720]  object a liberal is actually wrong about everything so that's like a negative on the scale so iraq is
[49:30.720 --> 49:35.600]  at least neutral as intelligence uh iraq has neutral intelligence a liberal has negative
[49:35.600 --> 49:40.720]  intelligence so yes liberals are dumber than rocks science
[49:44.880 --> 49:50.160]  but the texas attorney general here thank god and and we'll see if avid comes through or not i'm
[49:50.160 --> 49:56.160]  not holding my breath but he's saying that they're looking into every avenue possible to stop
[49:57.680 --> 50:03.280]  the mayor steve adler of austin from forcing us to wear masks and and again it's some health
[50:03.280 --> 50:07.440]  expert that nobody here's ever heard of mark escott who just says well we'll decide when you
[50:07.440 --> 50:11.280]  can take the mask off and so i'm going to go to this now i'll double back to it later but here
[50:11.280 --> 50:21.280]  here's the real danger here texas hb3 in fact oh my gosh i'm so inundated there's rallies happening
[50:21.280 --> 50:27.840]  at the texas capital today at one and tomorrow at one fighting back against this um obviously i'm
[50:27.840 --> 50:32.720]  here in studio i can't be there otherwise i would and um we're just a little tight staff right now
[50:32.720 --> 50:37.520]  with everything so uh just if people want to know at the state capital the next two days at one
[50:37.520 --> 50:42.960]  o'clock at the state capital um so today and tomorrow there will be patriots gathering to
[50:42.960 --> 50:47.840]  fight back against this stand up against uh mayor adler and others you want to take part in that but
[50:47.840 --> 50:54.240]  texas hb3 they sign this folks forget about it but it's the same thing where so it's the pandemic
[50:54.240 --> 50:57.840]  emergency provisions and to say oh during a pandemic we can force inoculate you we can make
[50:57.840 --> 51:01.680]  wear a mask we can shut down your business all this stuff so they never actually had the law
[51:01.680 --> 51:07.920]  before so it was all illegal so now they actually have signed the bill so that when they do it again
[51:07.920 --> 51:13.760]  they're going to say no this is law texas hb3 should not pass but it's the same thing well
[51:13.760 --> 51:21.360]  well what qualifies as a pandemic if there's an increase in the death ratio of say five percent
[51:21.360 --> 51:28.800]  does that well well no they just decide they just decide oh if they say there's a pandemic
[51:28.800 --> 51:33.840]  then there's a pandemic oh i don't see any possible danger there oh that'll be just fine i'm sure
[51:35.360 --> 51:40.320]  by the way governor knew some of california just said that they're never going back to normal
[51:41.280 --> 51:48.640]  how would you like to wake up to that news by the way slave we're not freeing you anytime soon
[51:51.760 --> 51:53.920]  by the way once again a liberal is dumber than a rock
[51:53.920 --> 52:02.720]  stop carbon emissions they're killing the planet i'm not even kidding you i have the u n document
[52:02.720 --> 52:09.840]  right here where they literally say the biggest thing about coming out of this pandemic is stopping
[52:09.840 --> 52:14.400]  climate change and pollution it's right here this was a story my crew brought me today i didn't even
[52:14.400 --> 52:20.960]  have this intel myself the number one thing about cobit 19 for the u n build back later agenda
[52:20.960 --> 52:26.240]  is tackling climate change and stopping pollution well okay climate change is caused they claim
[52:26.240 --> 52:30.240]  by carbon emissions yet they want you to breathe in your carbon emissions all day and now look at
[52:30.240 --> 52:39.280]  this let's talk about pollution philippines curl reef covered with face masks guess what
[52:39.280 --> 52:44.640]  i was driving around austin today face masks everywhere i have face masks somehow in my
[52:44.640 --> 52:49.360]  backyard that's totally fenced in i have face masks floating around my little cul-de-sac
[52:49.360 --> 52:55.520]  so oh wow we're using cobit to stop pollution and stop carbon emissions as it forces you to breathe
[52:55.520 --> 53:02.320]  in carbon and plush the planet the general public has finally figured out why i'm upset they figured
[53:02.320 --> 53:06.640]  out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us they're trying to take over civilization
[53:06.640 --> 53:12.640]  and society and they depend on the public being ignorant that's what jesus said my people perish

[55:36.640 --> 55:42.640]  rest like nashville tennessee look at every major american city that has been run by democrats

[56:10.640 --> 56:20.560]  but the will and the instinct to tell the truth overwhelms the will and the instinct to just
[56:21.680 --> 56:22.160]  try to
[56:24.960 --> 56:29.440]  not be divisive i don't even know what else he would say there but no hey i'm sorry if there's

[59:03.360 --> 59:10.880]  tell the truth here unlike foul cheap but see this is their science and i i've got a clip coming up
[59:10.880 --> 59:15.120]  i don't want to get into context this is their science now did you know that they're banning
[59:15.120 --> 59:22.080]  isaac newton from the education system because he's white that's right ladies and gentlemen
[59:23.360 --> 59:29.200]  we don't call them nuisance newton's laws anymore they call them three fundamental laws of physics
[59:29.200 --> 59:36.640]  to de-center whiteness so don't you see that science now if it's a white guy that does science
[59:36.640 --> 59:41.520]  then don't mention his name but somehow fouchi gets to go on tv all the time now here's an
[59:41.520 --> 59:47.760]  interesting interview that fouchi had on cnn he was asked about the science he was asked about
[59:47.760 --> 59:52.640]  the science with the vaccine and traveling and getting back to normal and uh well let's see
[59:52.640 --> 59:56.880]  what fouchi had to say about the science you know from the bind administration that they say
[59:56.880 --> 1:00:03.760]  it will make its decisions based on science what's the science behind not saying it's safe
[1:00:03.760 --> 1:00:10.320]  for people who have been vaccinated receive two doses to travel you know that's a very good question
[1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:17.600]  john and and the cdc is carefully heading in that direction uh you know when we when when
[1:00:17.600 --> 1:00:23.040]  dr willenski made the announcement the day or two ago who about the fact that when you have a
[1:00:23.040 --> 1:00:28.400]  couple of people two or three or more people in a family setting both of whom are vaccinated even
[1:00:28.400 --> 1:00:33.200]  if it's someone from another a friend that doesn't have to be a member of the family that was the
[1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:38.880]  first in a multi-step process that they are going to be rolling out they're being careful
[1:00:38.880 --> 1:00:44.240]  understandably they want to get science they want to get data and then when you don't have the data
[1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:49.280]  and you don't have the actual evidence then you've got to make a judgment call and i think that's
[1:00:49.280 --> 1:00:53.280]  what you're going to be seeing in the next week so you're going to see so there is no science
[1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:57.440]  more and more guidelines getting people to be more and more flexible and it's a judgment call
[1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:01.360]  they're getting a lot of inspiration of this so it's a judgment call for fouchi it's a judgment
[1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:06.560]  call for some doctor you've never heard of and what are they talking about your activity in your
[1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:11.440]  own home he says it in the interview well if you're in your home and you know if you're vaccinated
[1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:15.360]  maybe you can have a friend over maybe you can have family dinner if you're vaccinated maybe
[1:01:15.360 --> 1:01:19.680]  that's a judgment call because we don't have the science and they have the thing on the screen there
[1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:24.640]  oh a hundred million vaccines have been administered yay well where the hell's the science where the
[1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:32.720]  hell's the data we do have some of the data actually at least 900 people have died after
[1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:38.240]  getting the vaccine maybe that's why he doesn't want to talk about the data maybe that's why he
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:48.800]  doesn't want to talk about the science but imagine that rat bastard that big pharmaceutical whore
[1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:59.280]  that new world order piece of filth anthony fouchi goes on cnn to talk about what you can or can't
[1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:13.520]  do in your house the nerve the gall the aggression that guy should be completely rejected and
[1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:21.200]  repudiated by society by civilization the fact he's still going on tv tells you how lost this
[1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:27.600]  planet is this guy shouldn't even be able to show his face in public this guy said millions of
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:33.520]  americans would be dead from covet he hasn't said one thing right he hasn't said one thing accurate
[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:40.400]  about this thing except about the masks which are then of course he retracted he said yeah don't
[1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:44.960]  wear a mask he doesn't do anything oh now he wants you to wear two masks and put one on your butt too
[1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:50.640]  stop the fecal matter from getting out he'll say that next he'll go to just like in the during the
[1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:55.760]  AIDS pandemic he used to go to all the gay the gay bath bath houses to try to get AIDS yeah
[1:02:55.760 --> 1:03:02.400]  to test AIDS see how that was this guy should not he should be so publicly scorned and shamed
[1:03:02.400 --> 1:03:08.080]  he should be so embarrassed he shouldn't even be able to show his face in public let alone on tv
[1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:15.760]  but he goes on cnn and they tell you what you can do in your house they tell you that you have to
[1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:21.120]  consume someone else's product that hasn't been tested and we know could be potentially deadly
[1:03:21.120 --> 1:03:27.600]  seriously this is these are levels of evil
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:36.160]  that we don't even want to face or comprehend because see we don't have that will we don't
[1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:41.280]  have that lust we don't have that desire we don't have that satisfaction we don't like lying to the
[1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:45.200]  people we don't like deceiving people that doesn't satisfy us we like lifting people up we like
[1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:52.640]  freedom uh not cnn not fouchy they hate freedom they want to dominate you these are evil wicked

[1:08:00.800 --> 1:08:10.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:21.920]  you know i never really was one that thought i was never one that promoted it at least and i
[1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:28.640]  didn't really believe it either but i didn't think we'd see the return of jesus or you know really
[1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:35.600]  see the final plays of revelations i'm beginning to get to that point i mean this is such insane
[1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:42.480]  clown world behavior at this point and Fauci still going on tv uh people still wanting to wear masks
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:51.680]  i mean this is like this is six satanic stuff man and so to me it's been like more of an instinct
[1:08:51.680 --> 1:08:58.480]  to just like get on my knees and beg god just to spare me like please god i'm not involved with
[1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:04.000]  these people please god please god i love humans please god i don't want to murder babies please lord
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:08.320]  i don't want to poison people and kill them please god forgive me i'm sorry we've fallen lord
[1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:14.560]  but there's that part of you that realizes your fate
[1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:23.120]  is tied to their fate in a way at least in this dimension in this in this life experience
[1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:27.600]  that's why it's so frustrating
[1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:37.520]  so i don't know maybe maybe maybe the the move is to just get out to the hills and just beg for
[1:09:37.520 --> 1:09:41.200]  god's forgiveness about 20 hours a day and sleep for four
[1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:51.520]  or maybe uh maybe there is one last fight for humanity maybe humanity will rise up again against
[1:09:51.520 --> 1:10:00.000]  these demons maybe humanity will struggle for its freedom once again but man oh man when i see the
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:04.640]  look in that liberal's eyes with two masks on looking at me like i'm some sort of dirt bag
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:08.800]  because i like to breathe clean air and when i tell them hey you know what was the percentage
[1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:14.880]  increase in death in 2020 and they they don't have a damn clue they don't even care that's when you
[1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:22.880]  realize they're gone they're no longer with god they're no longer connected to this reality
[1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:30.400]  they're no longer connected to their own mind really they're gone they have no interest in
[1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:38.000]  being with humanity anymore they don't even want control of their own destiny they don't even have
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:46.160]  an instinct of prosperity they've been their souls have been stolen by satan
[1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:50.160]  and the lies of the new world order
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:56.160]  we'll be continuing to update you at least it's going to be an interesting story for me
[1:10:57.200 --> 1:11:03.760]  what goes on in texas here in austin as ken paxton is saying i think they might sue steve abler
[1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:10.320]  i'm hoping they do i'd love to see that little coward who always hides when i go speak at city
[1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:16.480]  council now they just cancel all the city council things i'd love to see that coward steve adler
[1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:22.080]  gets sued for breaking the law but but see it doesn't even matter because steve adler is just
[1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:26.480]  a little he's just he's just a little weasel he's just a little virus of the new world order
[1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:32.960]  ken paxton really needs to be focusing on texas hb3 pandemic emergency provisions
[1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:38.560]  that will then put in law that they can force inoculate us that's what needs to be the name the
[1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:43.120]  the main thing here but hey you know what i don't like adler he's a total scumbag he should be sued
[1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:47.200]  anyway he needs to be removed from office i don't know a single person in this town that
[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:51.360]  likes steve adler it's a weird thing how he gets reelected without any support
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:55.440]  but hey he hates freedom so i guess that's popular these days
[1:11:55.440 --> 1:12:03.520]  let's move on continuing to look here at the dumber than rocks left of america
[1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:11.120]  mainstream newspapers team up to stalk anti-lockdown salon owner as she moves to new state so this lady
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:22.000]  lindsay gramm is her name ironically and say lemorgan owns a salon and because the organ
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:26.720]  economy has been shut down she's decided to move her business
[1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:36.320]  after 12 years to arizona and of course this she really doesn't even have a choice she can't even
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:41.280]  do business in organ she she's she's she can't even do business in organ so she's like well
[1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:45.440]  i have to leave there's nothing else i can do so what do they do well they don't like this they
[1:12:45.440 --> 1:12:53.600]  don't like the slave leaving the plantation do that no they don't liberals hate it when they
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:58.720]  don't control your life liberals hate it when they don't have you in shackles of fear or government
[1:13:00.480 --> 1:13:04.240]  so they're stalking this lady now as she moves her business to arizona so
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:08.000]  oh you know go make your own business go make your own this go do your own that no and then
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:16.560]  they follow you there and harass you there too you people are sick telling man they're gone the leftist
[1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:20.080]  in america about 80 percent of them i would say because i know liberals are good people and that's
[1:13:20.080 --> 1:13:24.560]  why i hate making these blanket statements because it's not uh obviously true to say about all people
[1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:28.880]  but i mean let's be honest 80 percent of the left liberal progressives in this country they're just
[1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:34.480]  gone man they're not even human anymore and they don't even want to be human that's what's so weird
[1:13:34.480 --> 1:13:41.680]  about it backlash after cnn reports cdc granting limited freedoms for vaccinated americans oh okay
[1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:45.600]  so the vaccine doesn't work but you still have to take it the mask doesn't work but you still have
[1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:49.920]  to wear it and we may or may not give you your freedoms back if you comply with all this but
[1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:58.160]  really we won't ever well seems seems like sounds great man sounds like freedom and prosperity to me
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:06.960]  sounds like a slave ship oh but the international business times is reporting today or i guess it
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:13.360]  was last week actually i'm looking at the date oh so probably more now over 900 dead after receiving
[1:14:13.360 --> 1:14:19.840]  COVID-19 vaccine but experts say the data is misinterpreted oh oh so that data is misinterpreted
[1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:25.840]  you died within a week of taking the vaccine that's misinterpreted but the the
[1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:33.360]  500 000 COVID deaths or whatever there are 80% comorbidities those that data is not being
[1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:41.360]  misinterpreted and it's definitely not intentional no no no no no no there is no agenda here
[1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:45.680]  there's no agenda to cover up the deadliness of these trial
[1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:52.960]  gene therapy vaccines there's no agenda to fake a pandemic by boosting the numbers and by getting
[1:14:52.960 --> 1:15:01.120]  hospitals to comply with cash payouts it's all on record no no no no no Australia didn't excuse me
[1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:07.840]  no no no Austria did not suspend the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine batch after death oh except they
[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:17.520]  did they did multiple deaths by the way multiple safe and effective though school
[1:15:17.520 --> 1:15:23.280]  canceled after numerous teachers experienced negative side effects from the Moderna vaccine oh
[1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:31.280]  that's being misinterpreted oh that seizure you had that stroke you had that's just being
[1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:37.200]  misinterpreted oh you can't lift your left arm oh your face went completely numb you're just
[1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:43.520]  misinterpreting that pain that's misinterpreted oh you went and got a shot and then you had a
[1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:52.400]  seizure and now you have a delve palsy you're just misinterpreting that that's just a misinterpretation
[1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:58.320]  and look at the hilarity here this is sad to know that the the leftist liberals are teaching
[1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:03.760]  your kids but i guess this has been the case for a while now and these are such lazy bums
[1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:10.320]  i would not i mean there are very few public schools where i think i would ever send my kid
[1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:17.440]  very very few very very few because there's good ones out there there are there definitely are
[1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:24.800]  but boy oh boy the ones run by leftists and democrats you you you you you don't want your kids there
[1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:32.000]  and so they don't even hide it anymore la teachers union members warned not to post vacation photos
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:36.800]  online so while the teachers this is hilarious while the teachers are complaining because they
[1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:41.680]  don't want to go back to work while they're saying it's too dangerous to go back to work
[1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:47.440]  they're literally vacationing around the planet and somebody leaks somebody leaks the text message
[1:16:47.440 --> 1:16:52.560]  thread and they're like guys quit posting your vacation photos we can't convince people that
[1:16:52.560 --> 1:16:58.320]  we're scared of a virus when we're all traveling around the world attention radio listeners if
[1:16:58.320 --> 1:17:04.080]  you're concerned about the coming chaos after the november elections this will be an extremely
[1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:10.240]  important message here is why no matter what the outcome in november catastrophic social upheaval
[1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:16.240]  is a very real possibility here's why this is important listen we all know that silver and
[1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:22.000]  gold have been historic hedges against the uncertain waves of social chaos and unstable
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:27.680]  currencies but did you know that there's been times in the past during times of extreme hardship
[1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:33.600]  when americans put another store of value above even silver and gold it's true open pollinated
[1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:38.560]  seeds have been and could very well be the ultimate store of value in the coming hard
[1:17:38.560 --> 1:17:44.240]  times ahead go to survival seed bank dot com to get heirloom seeds below wholesale visit survival
[1:17:44.240 --> 1:17:50.080]  seed bank dot com this week and get hundreds of dollars in free bonuses beat the coming chaos

[1:17:55.280 --> 1:18:03.840]  seed bank today humanity has been domesticated by and large the population has been trained to submit
[1:18:03.840 --> 1:18:09.040]  do what you're told it's all going to pass but if you study authoritarians if you say the globalists
[1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:13.520]  you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point
[1:18:13.520 --> 1:18:18.400]  of being called being totally enslaved and because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid
[1:18:18.400 --> 1:18:22.560]  they are now making that move and they are collapsing the third world with their economic
[1:18:22.560 --> 1:18:28.640]  weapons to then flood us with the third world that the un will use as a weapon to then have us
[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:33.840]  under such a crises under such a load capitulate to the un whatever agreements they want us to
[1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:39.840]  sign hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees not fleeing coveted
[1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:45.200]  or climate change as the un and claus schwaver saying and bill gates is saying but fleeing the
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:51.360]  year-long lockdowns that the un and bill gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get
[1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:57.360]  more imf and world bank money and that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist

[1:21:23.200 --> 1:21:29.840]  well that's that'll put you back where you need to be right there a little rock and roll
[1:21:29.840 --> 1:21:41.440]  you know i was thinking about doing this with the crew we like to have some fun behind the scenes
[1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:46.480]  like for example we did an over under how much of the covet stimulus would go to foreign nations
[1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:51.040]  i think we said a trillion it'd be over a trillion i think that hit i think it was over a trillion
[1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:59.120]  going to foreign nations um i almost want to do a new pool where we try to guess what's going to be
[1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:06.240]  canceled next you know what i mean like what is going to be canceled next of course today
[1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:15.680]  they have announced disney plus has removed peter pan dumbo and other movies from their digital
[1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:23.600]  streaming service uh because of racist uh racism and so i i saw this one coming the crew can uh
[1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:28.160]  the crew could definitely notch that in my belt but i'm thinking we as a crew every time there's a
[1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:34.160]  big cancel purge like this we should like like dr seuss was a big one okay peter pan i mean where
[1:22:34.160 --> 1:22:38.960]  would you put your money on the next thing being canceled they haven't really gone after music yet
[1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:46.000]  but see that feeling you get from rock and roll that feeling you get from jazz that feeling you
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:51.600]  get from music they're gonna have to cancel it somehow and they'll make it so that you can only
[1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:56.880]  get like um they'll like band cds or something so it'll be just like how this is why they want
[1:22:56.880 --> 1:23:00.240]  the movie theaters canceled because the movie theater can decide what to screen but if everything's
[1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:06.000]  digital they have total control of what you see so they're kind of going that way with music but when
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:13.360]  do they start going after the music industry i wonder they have in the past but they were not
[1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:18.000]  nearly as effective when they tried to shut down ac dc or shut down romstein and some of these other
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:27.120]  people back in the day or hell even some people tried to stop nirvana from playing shows and like
[1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:35.280]  Kurt Cobain's like a huge huge leftist liberal so when will they start they're gonna start coming
[1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:42.480]  for music soon you watch and you know we haven't had any real live concerts in a while either so
[1:23:42.480 --> 1:23:47.920]  this is kind of like i think they're gonna start getting into music soon too but because i was
[1:23:47.920 --> 1:23:53.600]  thinking there was a basketball player an NBA basketball player i guess he does live streams
[1:23:53.600 --> 1:24:01.760]  on the video game streaming sites and um he used a slur against a slur against jewish people
[1:24:02.400 --> 1:24:08.480]  it rhymes with tyke but you know it's funny so he he got scolded and he lost all of his
[1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:13.520]  sponsorships because he's in a live stream playing a video game and says a word that rhymes with tyke
[1:24:13.520 --> 1:24:20.480]  but i'm curious will you get canceled if you go and you wrap at a show and you say something that
[1:24:20.480 --> 1:24:31.360]  rhymes with trigger i'm just asking maybe maybe in the near future there's no telling what the
[1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:36.160]  liberal left is going to cancel next but there is so that's why i'm thinking about starting a pool
[1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:40.000]  so let's think about this guys lady in the tramp definitely on the chopping block
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:44.960]  definitely on the chopping block for that one the siamese twins and i believe there's probably
[1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:49.440]  some other racism in that movie too in fact the whole notion and then they're eating spaghetti
[1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:52.640]  isn't that in the lady in the tramp that's probably bigoted against italian somehow
[1:24:52.640 --> 1:25:02.080]  or meatballs or Cuomo so uh what will be canceled next loony tunes cartoons hey bugs bunny dressed
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:12.560]  and dragged a couple times so he may be okay but speedy gonzalez oh that's we can't be having any
[1:25:12.560 --> 1:25:17.680]  of that now because i remember watching uh speedy gonzalez as a kid and thinking wow this must be
[1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:25.760]  what mexicans are like not i laughed because speedy gonzalez was funny i liked loony tunes i
[1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:32.480]  liked the orchestra i liked the sound effects it was funny i liked the blowing ups and the explosions
[1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:38.320]  underlay underlay i don't know about oh but it's racist look he's got a mexican sombrero on oh my god
[1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:46.160]  oh so what oh look oh that's a crow with a head on oh my gosh oh he's hanging out with the mexican
[1:25:46.160 --> 1:25:56.800]  stereotype mouse oh pepe la Cuomo has been canceled what are they gonna come for next man
[1:25:57.520 --> 1:26:02.960]  so uh get your dvds ladies and gentlemen of all your favorite cartoons and all your favorite
[1:26:02.960 --> 1:26:11.600]  movies because they are going to get canceled and by the way there's a very famous band they've had a
[1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:20.800]  i believe a couple maybe platinum records mumford and sons this is so pathetic though um winston
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:28.960]  marshal a guitar player from mumford and sons you may have heard of them very popular band
[1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:36.880]  well the guitar player winston marshal ordered andy knows book read the book and then commented
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:44.000]  on the book and he has now been canceled attacked ridiculed and had to leave the band because he
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:50.320]  dare read andy knows book and it was the antifa mobs that came from so antifa just burns cities to
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:58.640]  the ground attacks police burns police precincts riots in portland for months on end and now they
[1:26:58.640 --> 1:27:07.520]  get to they get to destroy your career if you go buy a book but then sadly winston marshal
[1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:18.960]  like a good cuck apologizes for reading a book i'm not even kidding you how pathetic is that
[1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:25.360]  hey bro now you've lost everything if you at least would have stood up for yourself
[1:27:25.360 --> 1:27:30.320]  you would still have some integrity and and a potential future but now you've lost everything
[1:27:30.320 --> 1:27:35.760]  they're not going to let you back in you're never going to be back accepted by these people
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:39.360]  unless maybe you rape a kid or something like it maybe or talk about it like james gunne
[1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:44.800]  then you'll that's probably your only hope but my guess is you're not the type of person
[1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:52.960]  so uh apologizing was a big mistake for buying a book for buying a book he has to apologize
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:28:06.960]  pretty incredible by the way speaking of the democrat terrorism new d triple c chief technology
[1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:12.960]  officer called on followers to burn every cop precinct to the ground
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:20.640]  you like that little ditty and then you of course you have her tweet here erica joy
[1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:27.120]  if cops kill me the only way to sully my legacy is to not be out in the streets
[1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:35.760]  burn every cop precinct to the ground this lady now runs the d triple c the democratic congressional
[1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:42.480]  campaign committee erica joy baker promotes burning police precincts to the ground remember
[1:28:42.480 --> 1:28:46.880]  when the antifa locked the police in their building and tried to burn it to the ground too that's
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:54.880]  literal by legal definition attempted murder not a single arrest was made but as we speak right now
[1:28:54.880 --> 1:29:01.440]  and you know i have to tell you this there's not many in media that that actually know this feeling
[1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:06.320]  of sitting in a jail cell and rotting and feeling like a forgotten human
[1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:17.440]  and so it breaks my heart there are at least there are at least dozens of trump supporters
[1:29:17.440 --> 1:29:22.480]  that are rotting in jails right now and and democrat judges are refusing to release them
[1:29:22.480 --> 1:29:27.600]  because they're claiming they're violent insurrectionists all because they were on capital
[1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:34.160]  grounds on january sixth that's it and they rot in jail cells and they're and they're told well
[1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:40.800]  well you can get out once you've had trial folks there are no trials happening nobody's having trial
[1:29:42.720 --> 1:29:50.320]  my trials been delayed over a year now think about that so they're basically sentenced to jail
[1:29:52.400 --> 1:29:59.520]  uh for for a undisclosed period of time indefinitely so folks the democrats aren't coming
[1:29:59.520 --> 1:30:07.120]  to put us in gulags they already are they're just getting started why do you think they were
[1:30:07.120 --> 1:30:10.240]  emptying the jail cells for coveted because they're getting ready to put you in them
[1:30:12.480 --> 1:30:16.880]  so i can't tell you because not many people can relate to this and believe me it's not
[1:30:16.880 --> 1:30:23.760]  something you want to relate to sitting in a jail cell rotting away feeling like like a forgotten
[1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:30.400]  person it's it's it's uh if you for for these people that are in there that didn't expect it i
[1:30:30.400 --> 1:30:36.480]  guarantee you it's a depression that will change their entire physiology and and outlook on life
[1:30:36.480 --> 1:30:41.440]  for many of them and they sit and they rot in jail indefinitely because democrat judges have
[1:30:41.440 --> 1:30:46.000]  called them insurrectionists and they can't get out of jail till their trial which they don't have
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:51.200]  any trials because it's all shut down for covet but if you're antifa you can riot and loot and
[1:30:51.200 --> 1:30:56.000]  burn and destroy and try to murder police officers and you don't even get a visit from a cop
[1:30:56.720 --> 1:31:02.160]  listeners ask me all the time why do you have multiple multivitamins why do you have multiple
[1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:07.200]  high quality iodine why do you do that because different strokes for different folks if we're
[1:31:07.200 --> 1:31:12.000]  talking to researchers and scientists and they say hey a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  iodine but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:21.040]  some people can't absorb pure iodine boom we did it it's popular at sex three is it better than
[1:31:21.040 --> 1:31:26.240]  x2 you decide it's different strokes for different folks well now we have a compliment to knock out

[1:35:13.360 --> 1:35:28.720]  we're paul driving through the news today on the alex joneshow when shroyer sitting in for alex
[1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:34.880]  we may be rejoined by alex in the fourth hour i'll be here nonetheless we do have some interesting
[1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:42.480]  news developments here i'm going to get to these coming up in a minute but let me stay focused on
[1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:52.000]  some of this other news at hand that we have right now um following up with what we told you about
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:56.800]  the new d triple c chief the new democrat chief that says burnall police precincts to the ground
[1:35:58.080 --> 1:36:04.000]  uh yeah that's the new head of the d triple c you also have this is hilarious to me
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:13.920]  me because if i didn't know any better which i don't i'd say that michael brown's family
[1:36:13.920 --> 1:36:17.680]  his father specifically wanted to use his death to enrich himself
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:25.680]  hmm sounds like something uh liberal would do but i guess we don't want to make these
[1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:30.800]  assumptions but boy he continues to go on the news michael brown's father that is
[1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:40.240]  and demand millions of dollars from black lives matter uh yeah bro they used you the democrat
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:46.080]  party doesn't give a damn about black people and the big lie that cops are racist or that a racist
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:54.080]  cop killed your son was just that a lie hands up don't shoot didn't happen now i won't make any
[1:36:54.080 --> 1:37:01.440]  judgments about you as a father i certainly could with the way your son behaved but i won't but boy
[1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:07.840]  how does it look talk about having no shame how does it look to come out as an activist
[1:37:09.280 --> 1:37:13.360]  or or posture yourself as an activist all the sudden you're in your your son's life again
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:20.000]  to posture yourself as an activist after your son attacks a police officer and and rob's a
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:28.560]  convenience store but then you come out and just demand money you just want to have millions of
[1:37:28.560 --> 1:37:36.240]  dollars in your bank account boy i think that says it all doesn't it folks doesn't it folks
[1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:45.600]  from al sharpton all the way down to where we're at now that's what it's always been about money
[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:55.040]  and power and these leftist liberal democrat progressives will stop at nothing in their pursuit
[1:37:55.040 --> 1:38:05.360]  of money and power and that's all they care about so not a good look supposedly an activist
[1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:10.400]  after your son's death not a good look to be demanding millions of dollars from black lives
[1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:17.280]  matter but oh you're surprised that democrats used black people to fundraise for their party
[1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:26.320]  well i guess that makes you the fool because everybody knew that is exactly what they were
[1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:38.640]  going to do and it's exactly what they did and will continue to do for elections moving forward
[1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:46.000]  but by the way the big lie of the democrats and their media cohorts doesn't stop all yesterday
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:51.280]  headlines being pushed on your push notifications on social media on television saying
[1:38:54.480 --> 1:39:03.440]  um the trial of george floyd's killer and they all had that word in him killer killer killer killer
[1:39:03.440 --> 1:39:11.200]  killer that's propaganda that's fake news if i was chauvin's lawyer i would be suing every single
[1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:19.120]  person that published a headline saying killer that's fake news first of all the case hasn't
[1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:27.840]  been decided yet second of all we have the autopsy there were no life-threatening injuries to george
[1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:40.720]  floyd none zero zip zilch nada he did have two forms of fentanyl in him and both in a deadly
[1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:49.440]  amount he also had coveted and meth in his system he died of a drug overdose and now it's gonna come
[1:39:49.440 --> 1:39:56.960]  out that he was actually doing drugs in the police vehicle and it'll come out that he did a similar
[1:39:56.960 --> 1:40:04.160]  thing i think it was in 2014 but see this is what black lives matter does is they swoop in
[1:40:04.880 --> 1:40:09.120]  after a death of a black man that they can politicize and turn into a cost a lab
[1:40:09.840 --> 1:40:14.000]  and then raise millions of dollars and then when the actual black activists who think
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:17.600]  they're the leaders of this who are actually being used like pawns like michael brown's father
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:22.960]  don't get a cent of it well then they complain and they want their millions where are their millions
[1:40:22.960 --> 1:40:28.800]  but again all oh yeah that's when he's dropping the bag of meth out of his back pocket there
[1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:36.720]  and then he was doing it in the police vehicle all of you know all of the headlines yesterday
[1:40:36.720 --> 1:40:43.440]  on tv and in the mainstream news said george floyd's killer so they're basically already
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:48.480]  assuming guilt there and then and then twisting the public opinion and shelvin's lawyers aren't
[1:40:48.480 --> 1:40:53.440]  even savvy enough to push back against it and then you saw all the jurors testimony yesterday
[1:40:53.440 --> 1:40:57.040]  oh i'm afraid to be in this case i don't want my house to get burned down
[1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:01.760]  oh i'm afraid to be in this case i don't want to be a racist so all the people that are actually
[1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:06.080]  like clearheaded and and thinking people don't want to be involved in this case because they
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:09.600]  know that black lives matter and democrats are going to come burn their house to the ground
[1:41:09.600 --> 1:41:14.880]  if they say that george floyd wasn't murdered so this jury is going to be not good for for
[1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:20.080]  chauvin and he's going to end up being a bunch of democrats or people who are afraid
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:23.280]  that just say yeah he killed them because they don't want their house to get burned down because
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:26.560]  we know that the democrats like the docks people and then burn their houses down
[1:41:29.280 --> 1:41:34.240]  these are the biggest terror this is the biggest terror cell in the united states of america today
[1:41:34.240 --> 1:41:38.880]  it's called the democrat party they promote burning police precincts to the ground they
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:44.960]  promote attacking police maiming police attacking american citizens attacking white people the
[1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:48.560]  democrat party is the biggest terror group in the united states of america and that's why now
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:54.720]  that they've seized control of washington dc and congress they have set up their walls their barriers
[1:41:54.720 --> 1:42:00.720]  their barbed wire and their armed guards this is a terror group the democrat party is a terror
[1:42:00.720 --> 1:42:07.760]  group terrorists the very dictionary definition of terrorism is executed by the democrats
[1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:14.480]  every single day but that's why they projected on to you
[1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:25.760]  so that when you call them out for what they are they say no i already called you a terrorist
[1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:30.080]  doesn't matter that we burn churches to the ground doesn't matter that we fake hate crimes
[1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:34.560]  doesn't matter that we burn police precincts to the ground it doesn't matter that we injure
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:38.320]  thousands of police officers doesn't matter that we burn entire cities to the ground
[1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:41.760]  doesn't matter that we attack our political opposition and throw them in jail
[1:42:41.760 --> 1:42:46.960]  none of that matters no it does matter the democrat party is the biggest domestic terror
[1:42:46.960 --> 1:43:00.800]  group in the united states of america bar none and here's some of the stuff that they allow
[1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:06.560]  Mexican drug cartels and human smugglers tag asylum seeking migrants with plastic covered
[1:43:06.560 --> 1:43:11.680]  wristbands Mexican drug cartels and human smugglers tag asylum seeking migrants to the

[1:47:02.880 --> 1:47:09.040]  and ingenuity art and skill and strength the other is based on the massive number of slaves it
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:16.080]  controls with a tiny elite above it america is transferring out of a system based on the ethos
[1:47:16.080 --> 1:47:21.920]  of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery that's why the globalists tell us
[1:47:21.920 --> 1:47:26.400]  america was founded on slavery when it wasn't they point out one of our evils so they can
[1:47:26.400 --> 1:47:31.360]  divert the facts that they are truly the slave masters a global permanent lockdown is here
[1:47:31.360 --> 1:47:35.280]  it's already causing millions and millions to starve to death when they're done billions will
[1:47:35.280 --> 1:47:39.760]  starve to death even the former head of the ministry of defense in england and a top general
[1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:45.040]  have come out and said the covet lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war that's the facts
[1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:56.160]  this is the bill gates new world order weapon you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:56.160 --> 1:48:07.280]  me
[1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:16.480]  well don't say you weren't warned when the democrat party goes full totalitarianism
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:22.080]  full tyranny and the republican party most likely will be right there and locked up with them
[1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:26.000]  the few fighters left though are in the republican party they're coming out of
[1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:30.160]  florida they're coming out of missouri they're coming out of texas that are coming out of
[1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:35.120]  south dakota they're coming out of louisiana they're coming out of colorado uh the few
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:41.120]  fighters we have left but boy oh boy i mean just don't be surprised folks and you know
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:45.120]  nobody else is talking about this it'll probably be a big story in six months when these people
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:49.280]  are still rotting away into jail cell whole families by the way entire families pastures
[1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:55.280]  veterans rotting away in jail right now because judges refuse to see their cases and they say
[1:48:55.280 --> 1:48:59.680]  they're dangerous insurrectionists so they refuse to release them it's totally all illegal
[1:49:00.640 --> 1:49:04.960]  i i know about these laws personally because if you know me i've been through the dc
[1:49:05.680 --> 1:49:12.880]  jail and judicial system so i i know how things work and there is no reason why any of these
[1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:20.400]  people should be held it's all democrat party policy the democrat party runs at least as to
[1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:24.960]  as much as they can there may still be some good judges but boy oh boy when you talk about the
[1:49:24.960 --> 1:49:30.160]  the prosecuting attorneys the district attorneys it's all democrat party run you want to make it
[1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:34.480]  in that town as an attorney you better do the democrats bidding i've dealt with it first
[1:49:34.480 --> 1:49:42.800]  hand so now though i mean we'll see when it becomes a story
[1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:52.000]  and and i guess guys is this just a list is this a list of the usa today of all the people
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:50:04.240]  they're still in jail all right so this is the list of people that are arrested they're probably
[1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:11.520]  still all in jail so i'm telling you right now folks the democrat party is holding political
[1:50:11.520 --> 1:50:20.880]  prisoners dozens if not hundreds and they're coming for more and they're saying you can't be released
[1:50:20.880 --> 1:50:25.520]  because here's i mean i'll give you a basic idea of how it goes and it's like this in most areas
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:32.720]  but you get arrested and and and most places for a for a for a misdemeanor or or you know
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:36.480]  something like this they'll release you that day unless you have other prior charges or something
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:41.600]  they'll release you under your own cognition oh but not here yeah look at this some of them
[1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:44.800]  they don't even have the charges they just oh you were on you were in town on the sixth we're just
[1:50:44.800 --> 1:50:50.800]  arresting you and uh yeah it's it's oath keepers it's just people that know roger stone people that
[1:50:50.800 --> 1:50:55.680]  know donald trump people that post about q anon whatever so they're just being rounded up and
[1:50:55.680 --> 1:51:01.040]  arrested and then they don't even they don't even get a day in court because the courts are shut down
[1:51:01.040 --> 1:51:07.440]  for covet yeah i don't even want to get into some of the stuff that i know that's been happening
[1:51:07.440 --> 1:51:16.480]  to the proud boys or or stewart roads oath keepers telling you it breaks my heart because i know
[1:51:16.480 --> 1:51:22.160]  exactly what they're going through folks these people have been locked up and the keys been
[1:51:22.160 --> 1:51:27.360]  thrown away and and it's all illegal and they don't get they don't have rights to a fair trial
[1:51:27.360 --> 1:51:32.160]  or a speedy trial and so the judge says because normally you would either get released the next
[1:51:32.160 --> 1:51:39.760]  day or you would at least see a judge the next day to to make a decision of declaration of
[1:51:39.760 --> 1:51:44.000]  innocence or guilt and then you would move on from there they're not even getting that folks
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:47.680]  they're arresting them some of them don't even get their charges they throw them in a jail cell
[1:51:49.040 --> 1:51:52.800]  and then they tell the attorney whether it's a public defender or if they have a private attorney
[1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:59.920]  they say well we can't let them out of jail until their day in court but that's a misnomer
[1:51:59.920 --> 1:52:07.840]  because there is no day in court the courts are closed so yes the democrat party ladies and gentlemen
[1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:14.880]  already has political prisoners the gulags aren't coming they're here now notice how they release
[1:52:14.880 --> 1:52:22.080]  rapists and pedophiles and violent offenders from jail because of coveted but they're throwing all
[1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:26.480]  the trump supporters in jail and then not releasing them because of covet see how that works
[1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:33.920]  i just hope people realize how dangerous this is i just hope people realize how serious this
[1:52:33.920 --> 1:52:41.440]  is so so just just understand the democrat party already has political prisoners the democrat party
[1:52:41.440 --> 1:52:47.360]  already has detention facilities for their political dissidents they're going full terrorist
[1:52:47.360 --> 1:52:53.120]  takeover right now that's why washington dc is under martial law the democrat party is in a full
[1:52:53.120 --> 1:52:58.800]  terrorist takeover the united states of america the general public has finally figured out why i'm
[1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:03.680]  upset they figured out the globalist are literally trying to kill us they're trying to take over
[1:53:03.680 --> 1:53:09.440]  civilization and society and they depend on the public being ignorant that's what jesus said my
[1:53:09.440 --> 1:53:15.920]  people perish for lack of knowledge knowledge is power like our bodies are made up of all these
[1:53:15.920 --> 1:53:21.520]  tissues and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals and that's why
[1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:25.680]  they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals because it's so simple because you
[1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:30.000]  won't be under their control anymore well the vitamin mineral fusion the highest quality

[1:54:08.560 --> 1:54:17.200]  you're listening to the alex joneshow and now your host oh and shroyer fake pandemics
[1:54:18.240 --> 1:54:22.480]  communism political prisoners it's all right here in the united states of america i'm not sure how
[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:30.960]  we get out of this folks pray to god for forgiveness uh beg jesus to come rid us of these demons i don't
[1:54:30.960 --> 1:54:40.080]  know but just know this the biggest domestic tear group in the united states of america is the
[1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:47.440]  democrat party they're allowed to riot and burn and attack police citizens anybody they want
[1:54:47.440 --> 1:54:52.080]  with no punishment at all and right now they are holding dozens if not hundreds we don't even know
[1:54:52.080 --> 1:54:58.400]  the numbers of political prisoners of trump supporters who are in dc on january 6th and
[1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:03.840]  i can only say so much but but that's what's going on and no one else will tell you this and quite
[1:55:03.840 --> 1:55:09.040]  frankly most other people are in media are afraid to go to jail they won't even take a step sideways
[1:55:10.560 --> 1:55:18.720]  that's why i always say and it's sad but true uh conservatives in dc are the weakest conservatives
[1:55:18.720 --> 1:55:26.320]  you're ever going to see or hear they like their studios they like still being on twitter they like
[1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:29.840]  going to the white house events they like feeling like they're part of the establishment
[1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:36.560]  so they're never going to step out of their comfort zone they've got it too good the same
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:41.360]  reasonable why does the media go along with the fake pandemic well because they're not suffering
[1:55:42.400 --> 1:55:46.560]  they're still getting their big paychecks they're still getting their private security
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:53.120]  they're still living their lavish lifestyle you're suffering they're enriching themselves
[1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:56.240]  it's the same thing politically
[1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:02.960]  one of the individuals
[1:56:07.840 --> 1:56:12.320]  former trump state department employee low-level employee they should get rid of the state
[1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:16.400]  department in fact reading this i learned more about the state department folks the state department
[1:56:16.400 --> 1:56:24.560]  is a joke this is the whole thing should be shut down just a worthless part of the bureaucracy
[1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:32.800]  but frederico guillermo kline a schedule c political and pointy office of brazilian of
[1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:37.760]  southern cone affairs that's a state department office you're paying for uh he rots in a jails
[1:56:37.760 --> 1:56:45.280]  fell along with many other veterans and such oh but q anon remember q anon so the democrats
[1:56:45.280 --> 1:56:56.880]  aren't done using q anon as their as their launch pad for all of their tyranny but i love this story
[1:56:56.880 --> 1:57:02.880]  the headline from the washington post here threats of a q anon fueled march fourth attack create
[1:57:02.880 --> 1:57:13.760]  disruptions but little trouble researchers say police over reacted really the police over reacted
[1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:19.600]  so the washington post and the new york times and cnn and msnbc fabricate whole cloth
[1:57:21.200 --> 1:57:28.240]  a q anon event on march fourth literally nobody else promoting it not even q anon just the democrat
[1:57:28.240 --> 1:57:32.480]  party and their media cohorts and then it doesn't happen because the whole thing was fake and made
[1:57:32.480 --> 1:57:39.360]  up anyway and then they say oh police over reacted no that's like the war that's like the boy that
[1:57:39.360 --> 1:57:44.000]  cried wolf so the washington post shows up at your door and says someone's gonna bomb you tomorrow
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:48.080]  someone's gonna bomb you tomorrow you're gonna get bombed tomorrow and then you're there tomorrow
[1:57:48.080 --> 1:57:52.960]  sitting in you know a helmet and a bunker and then you and then then and then there's no bombing
[1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:56.720]  and then the washington post comes your door the next day and says hey why did you overreact
[1:57:58.560 --> 1:58:02.720]  what do you mean you told me i was about to get bombed yeah but why did you overreact
[1:58:02.720 --> 1:58:11.360]  these people are sick man and then so but see still no demand to know who q anon is
[1:58:12.240 --> 1:58:18.160]  all these trump supporters are rotting in jail and quite frankly i mean i i'm not going after
[1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:22.640]  president trump but i feel like he's really abandoned these people sadly i'm not sure what he
[1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:26.400]  could even do but in a way he's kind of abandoned these people i'm heartbroken for him
[1:58:26.400 --> 1:58:34.320]  but so nobody's demanding to know who q anon is trump's not making the demand
[1:58:34.320 --> 1:58:39.440]  halos he's not demanding it the media is not demanding it who is q anon who's starting all
[1:58:39.440 --> 1:58:47.280]  this stuff who incited the big insurrection see nobody's demanding to know pretty convenient isn't
[1:58:47.280 --> 1:58:52.800]  it that q anon now just becomes the leader of the trump movement even though it's dead to even
[1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:58.400]  most of people that believed in it everything turned out to be a lie none of it came true
[1:59:01.360 --> 1:59:06.640]  but nobody demands to know who q anon is no media demands no congressional demands nothing
[1:59:06.640 --> 1:59:14.960]  and but they use the anonymous q anon to say see here's our evidence of insurrection here's
[1:59:14.960 --> 1:59:19.040]  our evidence that they're getting ready for more terror but then they never go after the guy they
[1:59:19.040 --> 1:59:28.240]  never go after the bogeyman isn't that convenient for them and so of course it's all just another lie
[1:59:28.240 --> 1:59:35.600]  of the democrat party in their media so then they had blue anon here we go let me read this
[1:59:36.480 --> 1:59:43.840]  this was from urban dictionary blue anon a loosely organized network of democrat voters
[1:59:43.840 --> 1:59:48.560]  politicians and media personalities who spread left-wing conspiracy theories such as the russia
[1:59:48.560 --> 1:59:57.760]  hoax jesse small ed hoax ukraine hoax guvington kids hoax brett cavinal hoax the list goes on and on
[1:59:58.320 --> 2:00:02.720]  blue anon adherence fervently believe that right-wing extremists are going to storm capital
[2:00:02.720 --> 2:00:07.520]  hill any day now and remove lawmakers from office of course remember the day where there were
[2:00:07.520 --> 2:00:12.480]  actually people on the capital hill they were cleared out within hours and within hours of the
[2:00:12.480 --> 2:00:17.920]  clearing out congressional activity resumed people who had their businesses burned by democrats
[2:00:17.920 --> 2:00:21.280]  have yet to reopen their doors but i i i digress
[2:00:23.840 --> 2:00:27.600]  hence the need for deployment of thousands of national guard station at the u.s capital
[2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:33.760]  oh but then the washington post says police overreacted but we still need the martial law
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:36.560]  remember they said trump was going to bring in martial law and then the democrats did it
[2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:45.920]  destroyed dc so blue anon is an accurate description of all the fake news of the democrat
[2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:51.200]  party all the fake news of the mainstream media they all vote democrat blue anon all the lies
[2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:58.880]  so the lies of q anon and then the lies of blue anon so twitter and facebook
[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:04.960]  banned all blue anon content just erase it you can't you're not allowed to call the democrats
[2:01:04.960 --> 2:01:12.240]  out for their big lie and then urban dictionary under pressure from who i don't know removed
[2:01:12.240 --> 2:01:18.720]  the blue anon definition this is a first i've never heard of an urban dictionary
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:26.800]  definition being removed so that just tells you how afraid they are of the truth getting out
[2:01:27.440 --> 2:01:35.120]  that the democrat party and their media hook cohorts are liars liars liars
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:42.320]  liars anybody who's followed my work knows i am someone who wants to unify it's true
[2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:50.640]  however i have to call things out as they are and a democrat on tv and a democrat in congress
[2:01:51.360 --> 2:01:59.600]  is 110 guaranteed bona fide bet the house on it lying to you there is no bigger liar
[2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:06.160]  in the world right now than a democrat on tv and a democrat in congress you might as well
[2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:14.400]  throw the label of liberal on there too it's the same thing a liberal on tv a liberal in congress
[2:02:14.400 --> 2:02:24.320]  is lying to you they lie about everything everything in fact what do they even tell you
[2:02:24.320 --> 2:02:32.080]  the truth about good luck you'll be you don't don't hurt yourself trying to find that one

[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:46.240]  two months is high so maybe we might find a nice average there and say a month and a half
[2:03:46.240 --> 2:03:49.040]  they've already canceled pepe lapieu

[2:08:16.880 --> 2:08:22.960]  well you can rest easy knowing that the liberal left is going to cancel all your favorite cartoons
[2:08:22.960 --> 2:08:31.520]  and movies growing up don't worry you can still go play grand theft auto four and beat a hooker to
[2:08:31.520 --> 2:08:37.360]  death in a burning vehicle so you don't have to pay her that's progress
[2:08:39.200 --> 2:08:44.720]  all right um i have some election theft news there is some interesting developments here i'm not
[2:08:44.720 --> 2:08:49.840]  sure what will come of this other than perhaps public awareness but it may be too late the
[2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:54.640]  democrats are already certifying their election theft for the future they couldn't get hr1 passed
[2:08:54.640 --> 2:09:01.600]  so biden just signed an executive order instead by the way they did just sign it is now official
[2:09:02.160 --> 2:09:08.720]  two trillion dollars of stimulus we read where your money was going last night on the war room
[2:09:08.720 --> 2:09:14.800]  it's all going to come out soon folks you just got screwed so hard it's unbelievable it's pathetic
[2:09:14.800 --> 2:09:18.880]  so now five trillion i believe is the number i think it's in the last it's definitely the last
[2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:25.280]  year but maybe even the last six months five trillion dollars in stimulus money five trillion
[2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:32.240]  dollars like 25 of our national debt you don't get any of that money by the way most of it goes to
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:37.680]  foreign nations to stop climate change or what we're finding out too is it's all going to the
[2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:42.000]  democrat party not even kidding you they're literally paying themselves off it's unbelievable
[2:09:42.640 --> 2:09:48.160]  and they're covering their own deficits and their own budget losses in california in illinois and
[2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:53.280]  new york to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars so congratulations america you have just
[2:09:53.280 --> 2:10:00.160]  been stolen from once again guys when was uh go to the store here i knew it was five trillion
[2:10:00.160 --> 2:10:04.400]  but see if they put how many months of a timetable here now that it's official
[2:10:06.800 --> 2:10:11.360]  um i believe it's the last six months but it's less than a year okay so that's all we need to know
[2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:22.320]  so five trillion dollars from a fake pandemic boy do they rob us so good i mean this is this
[2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:29.760]  is this is such this is a three monti this is the shell game but like on the most elite criminal
[2:10:29.760 --> 2:10:36.560]  financial theft level that you could imagine so you've just been three card monti you you've just
[2:10:36.560 --> 2:10:42.080]  been shell gamed by our politicians they just bent you over and raped you financially
[2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:54.480]  sorry we're such a joke man our politicians are such a joke you guys are pathetic
[2:10:54.480 --> 2:10:57.840]  and biden doesn't even know what the hell's going on so i mean you know that's good the
[2:10:57.840 --> 2:11:03.760]  president's lost in a world that doesn't exist his dogs are biting people he's biting people
[2:11:03.760 --> 2:11:11.120]  literally like master like dog i suppose biden bites his wife during uh campaign events just
[2:11:11.120 --> 2:11:15.280]  out of nowhere i mean he's just totally lost it so his dogs are just biting people now too
[2:11:16.560 --> 2:11:20.800]  gropey uncle joe i guess his dogs thought they could take a note from joe and just bite and sniff
[2:11:20.800 --> 2:11:27.280]  whoever the hell they want uh but you hate to blame the dogs um so it's just incredible
[2:11:27.280 --> 2:11:34.160]  five trillion dollars ladies and gentlemen for a fake pandemic we've been robbed we've
[2:11:34.160 --> 2:11:40.320]  been had we've been duped how can we stand for this how can we let this happen yeah by the
[2:11:40.320 --> 2:11:50.960]  way there's joe folks i'm not in dc and i'm certainly not behind the scenes and i was
[2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:56.320]  thinking about this last night i listened to dan bongino he's former secret service um and there's
[2:11:56.320 --> 2:12:02.720]  some cia people like buck sexton he has a podcast and and and we've had people that reach out to us
[2:12:02.720 --> 2:12:09.680]  at info wars i've met people i mean it's no secret who we are in dc i'll just leave it at that but
[2:12:09.680 --> 2:12:16.480]  but here's what i'm telling you we are reaching a breaking point right now where it's not just
[2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:21.920]  going to be maybe a secret service member or leak some intelligence to a news organization or you
[2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:28.880]  know to an old buddy of his that has a podcast or anything like that uh this biden debacle is getting
[2:12:28.880 --> 2:12:36.880]  so bad we may reach a breaking point within the secret service folks i'm telling you it is really
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:43.520]  bad and the secret service by the way and the military this is consistently happening refuses
[2:12:43.520 --> 2:12:50.320]  to shake joe biden's hands refuses to salute when they walk around the white house so there's
[2:12:50.320 --> 2:12:56.160]  definitely disdain there joe biden already had a bad reputation within the secret service and other
[2:12:56.160 --> 2:13:00.560]  institutions remember they they used to have secret service used to have you know birthday
[2:13:00.560 --> 2:13:03.680]  parties they'd invite all the agents some politicians would be there sometimes to be
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:08.720]  hosted in dc they had to cancel those events during the obama years because biden would show up and
[2:13:08.720 --> 2:13:16.000]  and and grow people's lives not even kidding you so there was already that disdain but folks it's
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:26.240]  it's getting so bad now um and again i i'm well let me just tell you see there are people definitely
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:33.040]  inside the white house that are trying to get information out to the public but that are loyal
[2:13:33.040 --> 2:13:39.040]  to their duties and so it's it's it's a tough position to be in but it's getting so bad right
[2:13:39.040 --> 2:13:44.240]  now with joe biden they there may be a breaking point folks there may be a breaking point soon
[2:13:44.240 --> 2:13:48.880]  he's wandering around the white house he doesn't even know where he is he's getting confused because
[2:13:48.880 --> 2:13:54.080]  during the obama years and this is an odd story too by the way during the obama years joe biden
[2:13:54.080 --> 2:14:00.960]  was never actually allowed in the presidential uh residents so i'm not sure all the exact layouts
[2:14:00.960 --> 2:14:06.080]  but basically you know there's the presidential residents over here and biden was apparently
[2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:11.840]  never allowed there by obama for whatever reason i don't know obama never let him up there so he
[2:14:11.840 --> 2:14:17.920]  never been there before so biden keeps getting confused he keeps going to the other areas he
[2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:22.560]  keeps going to the vice president's office he keeps he keeps refusing to go into the president's
[2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:32.080]  quarters because he was banned there for eight years by obama and so when it got really bad
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:38.240]  with hillary clinton falling over and her health let's just say people on the inside got intelligence
[2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:42.240]  out and that's how we were able to get hillary clinton falling over and the ambulance is falling
[2:14:42.240 --> 2:14:48.640]  her around and her canceling events because she couldn't get out of bed it is it is it is virtually
[2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:52.640]  the same thing happening with biden right now but it's worse because he's actually the president
[2:14:53.840 --> 2:14:58.400]  and a lot of these people in the white house are either veterans or within secret service
[2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:02.000]  could be veterans i mean folks but the biden administration is starting wars all over the
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:08.560]  world right now uh yemen is getting bombed into oblivion with the biden grace we're but the the
[2:15:08.560 --> 2:15:16.640]  secretary of defense said that we're gonna bomb iran what we've bombed syria to what ends nobody
[2:15:16.640 --> 2:15:21.280]  knows what the hell's going on biden is not even the president folks nancy plosy is the acting
[2:15:21.280 --> 2:15:26.720]  president and kamala harris is essentially doing all foreign relations right now and so there's more
[2:15:26.720 --> 2:15:34.960]  coming up in that but see i've already digressed biden was never elected and it's going to get
[2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:39.600]  so bad that there's going to be a breaking point and so i don't know what they're going to do about
[2:15:39.600 --> 2:15:47.600]  this this fake president this this this zombie president and i'm going to double back to this
[2:15:47.600 --> 2:15:52.720]  story but but let me just show you more proof of the total fraud that we're being forced to
[2:15:52.720 --> 2:16:00.720]  believe right here from biden the huffington post twitter account has over 11 million followers
[2:16:00.720 --> 2:16:06.800]  okay the huffington post twitter account over 11 million followers they put out a tweet yesterday
[2:16:07.680 --> 2:16:16.960]  eight retweets six quote tweets and 45 likes now how the hell with 11 million fall actually all
[2:16:16.960 --> 2:16:21.520]  closer to 12 million i think with with tens of millions of followers you only get that much
[2:16:21.520 --> 2:16:27.600]  interaction and engagement now the story they put out was about uh harry and megan so is it the is
[2:16:27.600 --> 2:16:33.760]  it the lack of popularity from them or is it all their followers are fake just like everything
[2:16:33.760 --> 2:16:40.960]  else the liberal left engages in total shenanigans total fraud total fakery i believe it's probably
[2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:46.000]  a bit of both but even just through osmosis having 11 million followers you should be getting
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:51.520]  hundreds of weeks of retweets they didn't even get 10 folks biden can't even get a thousand people to
[2:16:51.520 --> 2:16:57.360]  tune into his live addresses i'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and
[2:16:57.360 --> 2:17:04.640]  rattle off the success is simple versus that if you're paying attention you know we've done together
[2:17:05.520 --> 2:17:12.960]  but i'll tell you this the technocrats are really up in their game and they are trying to destroy
[2:17:12.960 --> 2:17:19.280]  all independent forms of media they're trying to shutter and silence human resistance so now is the
[2:17:19.280 --> 2:17:24.000]  time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate everything you
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:28.400]  warned your friends and family about us around to be true so it's now that your credibility is
[2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:35.120]  way up the power structures of the silence those of us that they can't but it's up to all of us
[2:17:35.760 --> 2:17:42.480]  to not let them silence any of us we have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and
[2:17:42.480 --> 2:17:47.840]  setting on free speech we have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that
[2:17:47.840 --> 2:17:51.280]  long dark night doesn't come so be the taller bears you are
[2:17:55.840 --> 2:18:01.920]  humanity has been domesticated by and large the population has been trained to submit do what
[2:18:01.920 --> 2:18:06.800]  you're told and it's all gonna pass but if you study authoritarians if you study the globalists
[2:18:06.800 --> 2:18:11.280]  you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point
[2:18:11.280 --> 2:18:16.160]  of being cold being totally enslaved and because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid
[2:18:16.160 --> 2:18:20.320]  they are now making that move and they are collapsing the third world with their economic
[2:18:20.320 --> 2:18:26.400]  weapons to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us
[2:18:26.400 --> 2:18:32.080]  under such a crises under such a load capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign
[2:18:32.080 --> 2:18:38.320]  hoping that they will stop the blood of tens of millions of refugees not fleeing COVID or climate
[2:18:38.320 --> 2:18:43.840]  change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying but fleeing the year-long
[2:18:43.840 --> 2:18:49.680]  lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more
[2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:55.600]  IMF and World Bank money and that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist
[2:18:55.600 --> 2:18:58.960]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air
[2:19:00.080 --> 2:19:04.720]  about looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist that the public so dumb down
[2:19:04.720 --> 2:19:08.080]  that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them that we're poisoning them that
[2:19:08.080 --> 2:19:13.760]  we're sterilizing them then they deserve to be killed yes that's the position of the globalist
[2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:18.480]  they play God and they think because we don't stand up they have a right to do this to them
[2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:23.680]  you know I've told you that the globalists have tried to harm me they try to get me to join them
[2:19:23.680 --> 2:19:28.960]  but metaphysically at a spiritual level I have the Holy Spirit I'm connection with God
[2:19:29.600 --> 2:19:34.640]  and I know that God does not like that so I cannot join the enemy but I'll tell you at a selfish
[2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:39.840]  level I get very very mad at people that go along with the system believing you're part of it or
[2:19:39.840 --> 2:19:44.800]  believing you're getting power on them whether you're just a skill worker or a school teacher or
[2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:51.520]  Henry Kissinger you're not God and treating other people like they're animals and you're God is
[2:19:51.520 --> 2:19:57.280]  something that the real God of the universe doesn't like and that's a fact the resistance
[2:19:57.280 --> 2:20:08.640]  not video the resistance not video the resistance not video the resistance not video the resistance
[2:20:08.640 --> 2:20:18.160]  not video info wars.com news wars.com band.video and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have
[2:20:18.160 --> 2:20:27.440]  been banned that's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it but Soros and Bill Gates and
[2:20:27.440 --> 2:20:36.000]  the globalists are on our tail but the new website is the resistance.video the resistance.video
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:41.520]  they're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can't delete them so the new URL
[2:20:41.520 --> 2:20:46.240]  that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the
[2:20:46.240 --> 2:20:51.920]  special reports and all the suppressed information is that the resistance.video share the link
[2:20:51.920 --> 2:20:54.960]  the resistance.video the resistance.video
[2:20:58.720 --> 2:21:04.960]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:21:04.960 --> 2:21:19.600]  oh yeah you're in the twilight zone all right except it's real life
[2:21:23.600 --> 2:21:28.320]  in a world where liberals say that carbon emissions are killing the planet
[2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:36.000]  at the same time they ask you to breathe in your carbon emissions 24 seven in a world
[2:21:36.800 --> 2:21:44.640]  where democrats launch violent vitriolic campaigns causing billions of dollars in property damage
[2:21:45.760 --> 2:21:49.760]  and yet are arresting their political dissidents for violence
[2:21:52.160 --> 2:21:54.400]  this is the twilight zone
[2:21:54.400 --> 2:22:02.400]  in a world where democrats called an election rigged for four straight years
[2:22:03.120 --> 2:22:10.800]  now will censor anybody who says that the 2020 election was rigged this is the twilight zone
[2:22:11.520 --> 2:22:18.000]  so josh howley just put out a statement on the border crisis and you know it's funny because the
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:22.080]  bottom campaign says there is no border crisis even though they're now putting kids in cages
[2:22:22.080 --> 2:22:28.720]  and you have three times as many illegal border crossings at this point of 2021 than you did
[2:22:28.720 --> 2:22:33.200]  of 2020 many coming in with covid which apparently is like the deadliest thing according to the
[2:22:33.200 --> 2:22:39.680]  democrats too but not when it's an illegal immigrant i suppose but even biden who doesn't
[2:22:39.680 --> 2:22:43.840]  even know where he is half the time or remember the last time he brushed his teeth or what he had
[2:22:43.840 --> 2:22:50.800]  for breakfast yesterday when when the media was trying to get biden to answer the first question
[2:22:50.800 --> 2:22:55.360]  he would have ever answered since being elected supposedly of course he never was
[2:22:57.600 --> 2:23:00.480]  and so they're saying what about the crisis at the border as he's leaving that hardware store
[2:23:00.480 --> 2:23:04.560]  yesterday and you can biden's handlers are all trying to shuffle the media out and drown them
[2:23:04.560 --> 2:23:08.720]  out from asking questions because biden he's he's not really with it so he's still kind of
[2:23:08.720 --> 2:23:13.600]  responds i mean he still has his senses about him so we hear someone yell out hey what about the
[2:23:13.600 --> 2:23:17.600]  border crisis and he goes i'm not even kidding you i mean i could have the crew pull up the
[2:23:17.600 --> 2:23:22.720]  clip i just didn't plan on talking about this until i saw josh holly's statement from today
[2:23:22.720 --> 2:23:27.040]  that was just released on the border crisis with all the human trafficking happening there and the
[2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:31.600]  rape of children that biden says isn't a crisis yeah children being raped isn't a crisis according
[2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:38.160]  to the biden white house well he may be in on it you never know but he's leaving and and he says oh
[2:23:38.160 --> 2:23:41.680]  there's no crisis at the border and he says what are we gonna do and he goes well we'll be able
[2:23:41.680 --> 2:23:47.600]  to take care of it god willing oh oh there's no crisis but god willing you know we need god's help
[2:23:47.600 --> 2:23:52.640]  though and how come they haven't canceled biden for his catholic faith maybe that's why they cancel
[2:23:52.640 --> 2:23:56.000]  biden you know i was talking in the break with uh some of the crew here like what are they gonna
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:24:01.760]  do to get biden out of there they can't cover up that he's he can't even think or talk he can't do
[2:24:01.760 --> 2:24:06.560]  a press conference and he's a white male so what what is the twist gonna be because they can't let
[2:24:06.560 --> 2:24:12.640]  biden actually fade away to expose how the whole thing was fake and how he really can't think or
[2:24:12.640 --> 2:24:17.440]  talk there's gonna have to be some twist there's going to have to be some twist
[2:24:20.880 --> 2:24:22.640]  what will that twist be i wonder
[2:24:25.920 --> 2:24:32.640]  oh he's gonna have the grand step aside as a white man to give it to the black woman maybe he just
[2:24:32.640 --> 2:24:41.840]  dies what is going to be that twist so that they can still control the biden narrative
[2:24:42.880 --> 2:24:49.840]  and not expose that they put a guy in office illegally who can't think can't talk refuses to
[2:24:49.840 --> 2:24:59.440]  do press conferences what will the twist be but here are some of the latest that we have right
[2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:07.120]  now in the election theft new hampshire house election law committee to vote today on sb 43 and
[2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:12.160]  forensic audits of windham's voting machines and then that that that link
[2:25:14.720 --> 2:25:18.880]  is at the gateway pundit so my guess is that will be passed and then they'll audit it and it'll
[2:25:18.880 --> 2:25:22.960]  turn out they probably stole new hampshire too uh and those two electoral votes from trump
[2:25:23.760 --> 2:25:28.080]  same thing will probably happen in arizona it won't matter though they already certified the
[2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:33.760]  fake election wisconsin lawmakers to hold general election review hearing on wednesday
[2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:39.520]  following news the democrat operatives given keys to absentee ballot counting room
[2:25:47.840 --> 2:25:54.000]  it's just all the election right in front of your face man oh i'm sorry i just
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:26:06.560]  just uh yeah yeah biden won guys they just you know they just cheated 17 000 different ways
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:13.360]  i'm sorry it's just such a joke i mean it's not really a joke that that we're going under global
[2:26:13.360 --> 2:26:17.280]  tyranny and that we don't even have an election anymore but i mean it is kind of a joke when
[2:26:17.280 --> 2:26:22.640]  they're giving themselves the keys the absentee ballot counting room when they're faking fires
[2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:27.840]  and faking water main breaks i mean they're bringing in truck loads of ballots it's all on
[2:26:27.840 --> 2:26:33.680]  tape truck loads of ballots they're shredding ballots before audits can happen they're they're
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:37.680]  overturning in the digital systems flipping votes from trump to biden that came out in
[2:26:37.680 --> 2:26:43.440]  antrum county michigan audit i mean it's just i mean it's hilarious it's not hilarious because
[2:26:43.440 --> 2:26:46.480]  it's tyranny but it's hilarious i mean they're doing it i mean you know it's like it's like
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:50.960]  gonna it's like in a ridiculous cartoon you know with wiley coyote he gets blown up every scene
[2:26:50.960 --> 2:26:56.480]  it's like whoa uh you know obviously a guy can't get blown up every scene but that's why it's funny
[2:26:57.360 --> 2:27:01.040]  it's like well they can't they can't steal an election right in front of everybody's face
[2:27:01.040 --> 2:27:06.560]  changing the laws illegally uh flipping votes digitally with the voting systems
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:11.680]  bringing in all the mail-in ballots and they didn't have enough bringing in truck loads more
[2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:15.680]  trump winning in six states all day long until the wee hours of the night when biden gets the
[2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:21.760]  perfect amount of votes i mean they couldn't actually do that no they did yeah wiley coyote
[2:27:21.760 --> 2:27:30.000]  blew up 17 times in one episode with the roadrunner guys wiley coyote had an anvil fall on his head
[2:27:31.280 --> 2:27:39.440]  okay and he was able to fight another round wiley coyote had 12 sticks of dynamite blow up in his
[2:27:39.440 --> 2:27:45.520]  hands and he was still able to chase down that roadrunner the next day yeah folks biden who
[2:27:45.520 --> 2:27:56.080]  didn't campaign couldn't debate didn't even win any of the national polls when it came to the debates
[2:27:56.080 --> 2:28:04.080]  and and popularity contests yeah guys he won the election all right and he can't take a single question
[2:28:04.080 --> 2:28:08.640]  from the press why well because there's national crises going on even though that's exactly when
[2:28:08.640 --> 2:28:18.000]  the president talks to the press in the nation man oh man i am living in a loony tunes twilight zone
[2:28:21.600 --> 2:28:26.960]  mixture here spinning around into a beautiful oblivion
[2:28:26.960 --> 2:28:40.000]  and my goodness and you know it's sad because but they really have conditioned these liberals to just
[2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:47.760]  love their slavery haven't they having pro mask rallies in austin texas i believe that video
[2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:53.440]  with it at bandot video has over a quarter million views now should i if i was still allowed on youtube
[2:28:53.440 --> 2:29:00.880]  that our long video of me at the pro mask rally in austin would have five million views by now
[2:29:01.760 --> 2:29:06.960]  but see they don't want the left to be exposed they don't want people to know that americans
[2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:14.320]  still exist and are still fighting so they ban me so that's great we've got 280 000 views on
[2:29:14.320 --> 2:29:20.480]  our own platform of bandot video that we overwhelm with our own content anyway but we all know if
[2:29:20.480 --> 2:29:24.800]  this video was allowed on youtube it had five million views right now and it'd actually be
[2:29:24.800 --> 2:29:30.400]  affecting culture again i can't even go out anymore without getting recognized and it's
[2:29:30.400 --> 2:29:37.040]  it's a lot of young kids college high school kids which is like the demographic i want that's why
[2:29:37.040 --> 2:29:40.480]  i like the three to six drive that's when i fell in love with talk radio was just after school
[2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:46.560]  ever dad literally pump it right into my ears immediately but they all watch the videos of
[2:29:46.560 --> 2:29:52.880]  me in the street they don't even know that i host a three hour show so they can't have that content
[2:29:52.880 --> 2:30:02.480]  getting out but it's still at bandot video but boy oh boy they really have got the left to love

[2:35:17.360 --> 2:35:29.440]  it turns out that both my grandparents voted for joe biden in the last election
[2:35:30.640 --> 2:35:33.520]  so needless to say i'm not going to be visiting their gravesites anymore
[2:35:35.280 --> 2:35:40.000]  for that one all right i stole that joke but i thought it was funny so i'd say it here on air
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:44.560]  um so the stimulus bill just got signed we're starting to learn more about it some of the
[2:35:44.560 --> 2:35:52.240]  numbers the democrat theft that it is uh less than nine percent of the two trillion dollars
[2:35:52.240 --> 2:36:01.680]  is actually going to covet relief wow the covet relief bill and 91 percent is not for covet
[2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:06.720]  relief don't you love these lying politicians don't you love these criminal politicians boxed in
[2:36:06.720 --> 2:36:16.080]  under martial law um by the way this is incredible j dire he was my source for this i'm not sure if
[2:36:16.080 --> 2:36:20.320]  he was the original source but but he put this on his twitter account j dire uh sometimes guest
[2:36:20.320 --> 2:36:26.720]  hosting the alex jones show been a guest here if you search into google mass shootings surge
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:33.680]  you'll find all these headlines saying the exact same thing mass shootings and it's all it's literally
[2:36:33.680 --> 2:36:39.600]  all democrat run uh publications i mean is this ai is this active misinformation what's going on
[2:36:40.640 --> 2:36:46.080]  mass shooting surge in florida as nation faces record high mass shooting surge in tennessee
[2:36:46.080 --> 2:36:52.000]  as nation faces record high mass shootings surge in wisconsin as nations nation faces record high

[2:37:06.080 --> 2:37:09.280]  what is going on
[2:37:09.280 --> 2:37:15.060]  now remember again is it a i or is it democrat misinformation by design
[2:37:15.060 --> 2:37:17.240]  but remember
[2:37:17.240 --> 2:37:20.440]  i'm i'm struggling and and the crew is here there'll be somebody in here
[2:37:20.440 --> 2:37:23.180]  probably have a better memory of this deny
[2:37:23.180 --> 2:37:25.360]  but we covered it on air
[2:37:25.360 --> 2:37:27.440]  the team effort here a lot
[2:37:27.440 --> 2:37:31.440]  guys remember what was it that you plugged into google and it was like
[2:37:31.440 --> 2:37:36.000]  if you put any three digits into google and then covid cases i i think that's
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:37.840]  what it was
[2:37:37.840 --> 2:37:40.640]  maybe maybe one of the crew correct me but i think it's
[2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:45.440]  you could put any three digits any three digits into the google search
[2:37:45.440 --> 2:37:49.520]  and then covid cases and it's all like it
[2:37:49.520 --> 2:37:54.880]  always shows up that exact number so i guess so that's it
[2:37:54.880 --> 2:38:00.880]  so somehow there's magically of a thousand stories out there
[2:38:00.880 --> 2:38:04.480]  for every every number

[2:39:02.320 --> 2:39:06.240]  now you tell me how that happens
[2:39:08.640 --> 2:39:12.960]  no one else but info wars ladies and gentlemen
[2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:15.760]  that's amazing
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:25.840]  i don't know what how you uh don't know
[2:39:25.840 --> 2:39:30.160]  how you respond to that that's pretty crazy right there isn't
[2:39:30.160 --> 2:39:34.240]  should i go more crazy or should i dial it back what do you think
[2:39:34.240 --> 2:39:37.120]  go more crazy god what do you think cruise i go should i go next level
[2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:40.160]  crazy or should we dial it back

[2:39:42.960 --> 2:39:47.360]  next level crazy then oh i forgot about that one too
[2:39:47.360 --> 2:39:51.040]  okay we're going we're gonna go next level and then next level crazy you're
[2:39:51.040 --> 2:39:57.680]  gonna get a double bonus of crazy right here so again i'm uh this is an old
[2:39:57.680 --> 2:40:02.320]  story i'm not into the the the beings or whatever
[2:40:02.320 --> 2:40:05.200]  the royal family but this is a national phenomenon and there's obviously
[2:40:05.200 --> 2:40:07.840]  something going on with this a briefcase model
[2:40:07.840 --> 2:40:13.680]  megan markle but apparently this is new to me again i've never gone down
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:16.720]  these rabbit holes until this news was going viral the last two days and the
[2:40:16.720 --> 2:40:21.520]  crew brought this in so apparently there's a man who claimed he was the
[2:40:21.520 --> 2:40:24.880]  real prince harry who was shot up to death
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:28.800]  uh and the the police report are saying it was at least three guys with pistols
[2:40:28.800 --> 2:40:33.760]  so a murder obviously this guy claims he was the real prince harry
[2:40:33.760 --> 2:40:38.640]  and he was murdered in a hotel room um by multiple men for unbeknownst reasons
[2:40:38.640 --> 2:40:41.760]  so you can see how the conspiracy theories would start to go there so man
[2:40:41.760 --> 2:40:45.600]  who's claiming to be the real prince harry found dead shot to death
[2:40:45.600 --> 2:40:48.640]  again this is just rabbit hole stuff i'm not saying i believe this i quite
[2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:51.120]  frankly i don't care about the royal family but it but it's interesting
[2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:56.480]  and i also found that there were stories uh i mean it's it's kind of queuing on
[2:40:56.480 --> 2:41:02.320]  level stuff but there's actual video of this
[2:41:02.320 --> 2:41:05.440]  and again i'm not reporting this to be true i'm just telling you some of the
[2:41:05.440 --> 2:41:10.160]  stuff that's going on out there with this markle harry stuff
[2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:13.520]  the briefcase model and i guess the fake prince
[2:41:13.520 --> 2:41:21.280]  the cuck the prince of cucks that megan markle actually was never pregnant
[2:41:21.280 --> 2:41:24.400]  and it's one of those things like where you have michelle obama dancing on the
[2:41:24.400 --> 2:41:27.040]  set of ellen de generes and you can clearly see
[2:41:27.040 --> 2:41:30.480]  what looks like two ping pong balls flopping up and down in her dress
[2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:33.120]  so i don't know if i don't know if michelle maybe michelle obama likes to
[2:41:33.120 --> 2:41:35.600]  put a couple rocks you know in her crotch hole region
[2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:38.080]  maybe she's into that thing i don't know maybe there's something involved with
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:40.480]  that
[2:41:40.480 --> 2:41:43.680]  but but it's kind of like that and they have these pictures of megan markle
[2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:46.480]  where she's pregnant and then and she's in the same
[2:41:46.480 --> 2:41:51.280]  outfit same day same place and then all of a sudden her baby bump is gone
[2:41:51.280 --> 2:41:53.840]  and then there's other things where they see as you can see the fake baby bump
[2:41:53.840 --> 2:41:56.320]  falls down her leg again i'm not saying it's true i'm just saying this is out
[2:41:56.320 --> 2:42:01.840]  there but so this is all crazy and now she goes on
[2:42:01.840 --> 2:42:04.880]  oprah and you have a billionaire and a couple of millionaires complaining to
[2:42:04.880 --> 2:42:07.520]  be victims
[2:42:07.520 --> 2:42:11.120]  but
[2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:17.440]  now they have canceled pierce morgan for saying he doesn't believe megan
[2:42:17.440 --> 2:42:20.960]  markle on the good morning britain show says he
[2:42:20.960 --> 2:42:25.360]  doesn't believe she was suicidal doesn't believe any of her depression stories
[2:42:25.360 --> 2:42:30.000]  i wouldn't either this is a woman who goes on oprah and says i gave up my
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:33.200]  career yeah there's what i was talking about with the fake baby thing again i'm
[2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:35.600]  not saying this is real folks i'm just telling you what's going on it's very
[2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:38.720]  strange it's all weird none of it makes sense so
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:42.160]  i understand why people don't believe anything these days
[2:42:42.160 --> 2:42:46.000]  but i i don't believe megan markle either
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:48.880]  but pierce morgan isn't allowed to say that he gets canceled he has taken off
[2:42:48.880 --> 2:42:53.680]  the air for calling out the big lie so that to me tells tells a big story
[2:42:53.680 --> 2:42:58.720]  here she is lying now if she'll lie about that what
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:04.240]  else will she lie about see how that works
[2:43:04.240 --> 2:43:08.880]  that's why you have to watch out for these people they lie about pandemics
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:12.640]  they lie about weapons of mass destruction they lie
[2:43:12.640 --> 2:43:20.160]  about everything everything
[2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:25.040]  and so pierce morgan responds he says free speech
[2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:28.880]  is a hill i'm happy to die on well good for you pierce morgan
[2:43:28.880 --> 2:43:32.240]  one of the true liberals left that they'll actually talk and have a same
[2:43:32.240 --> 2:43:34.960]  thought in his head
[2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:41.120]  but he's being investigated for his comments investigated
[2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:44.160]  i mean i've never seen a more spoiled rotten brat than megan markle in my
[2:43:44.160 --> 2:43:49.680]  life and she goes on oprah and she says i gave up my career
[2:43:49.680 --> 2:43:54.080]  to be a part of this family woman you were a briefcase
[2:43:54.080 --> 2:44:01.600]  model a briefcase model on a game show
[2:44:01.600 --> 2:44:06.080]  wow what a sacrifice oh my gosh woe is it woe is megan markle
[2:44:06.080 --> 2:44:10.080]  she gave up being a briefcase model to be a princess
[2:44:10.080 --> 2:44:19.520]  a duchess wow what a sacrifice how did she do it give her a nobel peace prize
[2:44:19.520 --> 2:44:24.400]  going from television briefcase model to princess what a sacrifice she made
[2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:28.720]  and now of course she's destroyed the royal family but you know what i will
[2:44:28.720 --> 2:44:31.760]  say i wasn't really aware of this i did a little
[2:44:31.760 --> 2:44:35.440]  more research into this but it's it's an odd thing so they
[2:44:35.440 --> 2:44:39.920]  apparently they claim uh this is before my time that
[2:44:39.920 --> 2:44:44.560]  yoko ono broke up the beetles or they blame yoko ono for breaking up the
[2:44:44.560 --> 2:44:47.920]  beetles i mean is that is that an accurate cultural
[2:44:47.920 --> 2:44:51.200]  thing is that actually how it went down i don't even know if you would say so
[2:44:51.200 --> 2:44:54.800]  some of the crew here is older than me so so apparently yeah there's
[2:44:54.800 --> 2:44:58.240]  megan markle the briefcase model gave it all up folks she gave it all up
[2:44:58.240 --> 2:45:03.280]  to be a princess must be tough yeah every every every princess wishes they
[2:45:03.280 --> 2:45:08.000]  could be a briefcase model gosh but so they claim
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:11.360]  yoko ono broke up the beetles and you always think about this
[2:45:11.360 --> 2:45:15.040]  and then so the meme is yoko ono i broke up the beetles megan markle hold my
[2:45:15.040 --> 2:45:18.160]  beer i'll break up the royal family you always think about this
[2:45:18.160 --> 2:45:21.920]  even if megan markle is a bad character maybe it's a good thing that she's doing
[2:45:21.920 --> 2:45:25.200]  this maybe it wasn't this is gonna rub a lot of
[2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:31.040]  people the wrong way maybe it was a good thing yoko ono broke up the beetles
[2:45:31.040 --> 2:45:34.560]  the sad that john lennon who's just like a real dude like to go around new york
[2:45:34.560 --> 2:45:38.960]  city without security get shot in the street but you know what
[2:45:38.960 --> 2:45:42.320]  maybe it's a good thing that that selfish brad who gave it all up being a
[2:45:42.320 --> 2:45:44.720]  briefcase model is destroying the royal family
[2:45:44.720 --> 2:45:49.040]  listeners ask me all the time why do you have multiple multi vitamins why do you
[2:45:49.040 --> 2:45:52.880]  have multiple high quality iodine why do you do that because
[2:45:52.880 --> 2:45:56.080]  different strokes for different folks if we're talking to researchers and
[2:45:56.080 --> 2:45:59.600]  scientists and they say hey a lot of people love deep earth pure
[2:45:59.600 --> 2:46:02.960]  crystal iodine but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine
[2:46:02.960 --> 2:46:06.640]  and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine
[2:46:06.640 --> 2:46:09.840]  boom we did it it's popular it's x3 is it better than x2
[2:46:09.840 --> 2:46:13.040]  you decide it's different strokes different folks well now we have a

[2:46:50.080 --> 2:46:53.040]  called wanes world
[2:46:55.120 --> 2:46:58.240]  even before i had access to your show in the mid 1990s
[2:46:58.240 --> 2:47:01.760]  i went and saw that movie and thought man that looks fun
[2:47:01.760 --> 2:47:05.280]  to speak out have your own ideas and even if you're a nerd you're still
[2:47:05.280 --> 2:47:08.880]  entertaining because you're real well what do they say in wanes world
[2:47:08.880 --> 2:47:14.960]  we're not worthy we're not worthy every day when i cover these huge topics i
[2:47:14.960 --> 2:47:18.480]  don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge are so real
[2:47:18.480 --> 2:47:21.200]  but i'm trying to tell you the truth i'm trying to get it right and most of
[2:47:21.200 --> 2:47:23.840]  the time we do the globalists love lying to you they
[2:47:23.840 --> 2:47:28.080]  love manipulating you they enjoy destroying humanity they
[2:47:28.080 --> 2:47:32.320]  enjoy manipulating ideas and and using people's ignorance against them
[2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:36.560]  that for me is really set down and disgusting so you've got to pledge for
[2:47:36.560 --> 2:47:41.200]  myself and the whole info wars crew that we will never join the
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:44.320]  globalist we will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're
[2:47:44.320 --> 2:47:49.360]  all in this together
[2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:55.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:55.360 --> 2:48:16.080]  it's amazing how you can speak right to my heart we didn't uh
[2:48:16.080 --> 2:48:19.760]  we didn't go full next level that last segment but we still will ladies and
[2:48:19.760 --> 2:48:24.000]  gentlemen into the fourth hour of the alex jones show we go
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:27.440]  oh insurer still with you uh we're waiting to be rejoined
[2:48:27.440 --> 2:48:30.800]  by alex uh we're hoping he can make it on before the conclusion of this
[2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:34.160]  transmission but uh be on the lookout for alex on the
[2:48:34.160 --> 2:48:37.520]  war room tom pappert filling in for me on the host duties
[2:48:37.520 --> 2:48:43.200]  there uh okay a little fun about the uh former briefcase model who gave it all
[2:48:43.200 --> 2:48:46.720]  up to be a princess we admire her for her sacrifice
[2:48:46.720 --> 2:48:53.120]  um a joke here guys i need this on screen this is this is funny stuff
[2:48:53.120 --> 2:48:56.640]  so uh meghan markel had a nice dress on during
[2:48:56.640 --> 2:49:01.520]  the oprah winfrey interview and uh she wanted to thank monica lawinsky
[2:49:01.520 --> 2:49:06.400]  for letting her borrow her dress uh as you can see there
[2:49:06.400 --> 2:49:10.960]  um so uh she wanted to thank monica lawinsky for allowing her
[2:49:10.960 --> 2:49:14.320]  to borrow the dress that she wore in the oval office
[2:49:14.320 --> 2:49:19.760]  uh when bill rubbed off on her rubbed one off on her excuse me
[2:49:19.760 --> 2:49:23.760]  and put a cigar where the sun don't shine uh okay so uh that's just a joke though
[2:49:23.760 --> 2:49:27.200]  bill clinton's really a good guy he loves women um next
[2:49:27.200 --> 2:49:30.720]  it's a national women's month right now there's meghan markel the career
[2:49:30.720 --> 2:49:35.120]  briefcase model who gave it all up to be a princess a big sacrifice
[2:49:35.120 --> 2:49:38.240]  it is national women's day so bill clinton has to be uh
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:42.080]  locked into a cage to make sure he's not um you know overly celebrating women
[2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:46.560]  as we know he likes to do this is wild out of japan
[2:49:46.560 --> 2:49:51.120]  i'm not really sure how i feel about this guy i think i kind of like him
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:55.040]  but his opponent is the real deal for sure japanese candidate discusses
[2:49:55.040 --> 2:49:58.480]  platform dresses the joker so he's got this whole act he's the
[2:49:58.480 --> 2:50:01.520]  joker and it's and it is just a big act but he
[2:50:01.520 --> 2:50:06.720]  doesn't seem to be uh uh really necessarily negative
[2:50:06.720 --> 2:50:09.680]  he seems just kind of wanting to just be part of the craziness part of the
[2:50:09.680 --> 2:50:14.720]  chaos in in the true joker fashion but um interestingly enough not the guy
[2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:19.600]  who's dressed as the joker running to be the governor of chiba
[2:50:19.600 --> 2:50:23.440]  prefecture in japan but his opponent is the real deal
[2:50:23.440 --> 2:50:27.200]  so the crazy joker guy is one story that will catch your eye
[2:50:27.200 --> 2:50:34.720]  but his opponent is the real deal funny enough um they don't even
[2:50:34.720 --> 2:50:41.760]  i guess they don't even mention his name oh no there is masayaki hero
[2:50:41.760 --> 2:50:46.560]  hiratsaku i'm sorry if i'm butchering that
[2:50:46.560 --> 2:50:51.440]  he's running as well and he says covid is just the cold and vaccines are
[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:56.240]  dangerous there's the guy you want to be your governor right there that guy
[2:50:56.240 --> 2:50:59.680]  will promote freedom uh not the guy dressed like the
[2:50:59.680 --> 2:51:03.200]  joker i'm not really sure where that goes
[2:51:03.760 --> 2:51:06.960]  other than total insanity
[2:51:06.960 --> 2:51:15.680]  that'd be uh fitting for the times i suppose fitting for the times
[2:51:15.680 --> 2:51:18.000]  okay a couple of the headlines here i'm gonna be able to get through all this
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:20.720]  news so i can open up the phone lines at the
[2:51:20.720 --> 2:51:25.680]  conclusion of this break coming up uh big news from the biden campaign
[2:51:25.680 --> 2:51:29.120]  biden says the military will focus on making maternity
[2:51:29.120 --> 2:51:33.360]  flight suits yeah that was where he forgot his own secretary defense's name
[2:51:33.360 --> 2:51:35.760]  he forgot the name of the pentagon he forgot his own name
[2:51:35.760 --> 2:51:40.560]  but that's right because pregnant women love being blasted off at what like
[2:51:40.560 --> 2:51:45.440]  100 g's into space right right i mean that's what's happening here right if
[2:51:45.440 --> 2:51:48.240]  pregnant women are dying to get blasted into space
[2:51:48.240 --> 2:51:51.520]  the vacuum of space for their kid to have plenty of oxygen and
[2:51:51.520 --> 2:51:54.400]  you know eat food
[2:51:56.640 --> 2:52:04.880]  or maybe that's the oh see they missed it they missed the story here
[2:52:04.880 --> 2:52:08.560]  this is actually extremely bigoted and misogynistic to say
[2:52:08.560 --> 2:52:12.000]  that we need maternity flight suits but what about
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:16.800]  um fraternity flight suits for pregnant men
[2:52:16.800 --> 2:52:21.760]  you didn't think about that one did you remember that was a that was a serious
[2:52:21.760 --> 2:52:26.400]  thing during the democrat campaigning uh for president they said that men can
[2:52:26.400 --> 2:52:30.000]  get pregnant that's a serious thing for them
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:33.280]  so as a man that would like to get pregnant someday and be inducted into
[2:52:33.280 --> 2:52:36.800]  the women's hall of fame like michelle obama big mic
[2:52:36.800 --> 2:52:40.560]  i would like a flight suit catered to my pregnant belly
[2:52:40.560 --> 2:52:44.640]  so this is bigoted it doesn't matter that no pregnant woman in their sane mind
[2:52:44.640 --> 2:52:47.680]  would get blasted off into space in a rocket ship
[2:52:47.680 --> 2:52:51.840]  we better have that pregnancy suit for women and we better have it for men too
[2:52:51.840 --> 2:52:56.640]  damn it i knew trump was in battle i knew he
[2:52:56.640 --> 2:53:00.320]  was surrounded by cowards and my double talking
[2:53:00.320 --> 2:53:05.760]  agents of the enemy and a lot of people just couldn't believe it
[2:53:05.760 --> 2:53:09.680]  they're like oh no it's 3g chest 5g chest he's invincible
[2:53:09.680 --> 2:53:12.400]  and i understand why people wanted to believe that because this is scary what's
[2:53:12.400 --> 2:53:15.920]  going on the global government the new world order it now that people woke up
[2:53:15.920 --> 2:53:18.800]  the fact that's real they won't somebody to come save them from
[2:53:18.800 --> 2:53:23.040]  well trump sure as hell tried my gosh look it out prescription drug prices
[2:53:23.040 --> 2:53:25.600]  just tripled or quadrupled depending on the drug once
[2:53:25.600 --> 2:53:29.120]  by deciding that executive order we pay the most of anybody in the world that's
[2:53:29.120 --> 2:53:33.120]  just one case of hundreds of things that trumpet reversed and now people are
[2:53:33.120 --> 2:53:37.360]  going to feel the sting and the pain energy cost everything else but
[2:53:37.360 --> 2:53:40.480]  what's really illustrated this is the trial to the senate
[2:53:40.480 --> 2:53:44.160]  where trumps own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he
[2:53:44.160 --> 2:53:48.000]  lost the election and just engage all sorts of criminal activity
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:51.440]  because the fix is in folks the swamp is deep
[2:53:51.440 --> 2:54:03.120]  prompt thought it but it's up to us to win it
[2:54:03.120 --> 2:54:06.960]  live from the info wars dot com studios
[2:54:06.960 --> 2:54:10.880]  you're listening to the alex joneshow and now
[2:54:10.880 --> 2:54:16.400]  your host owin shoya so they passed the two trillion dollar stimulus bill that
[2:54:16.400 --> 2:54:20.640]  makes it over five trillion in less than a year that'll hyper inflate us and

[2:54:45.600 --> 2:54:52.640]  i'll make a bold statement you won't even get your stimulus check
[2:54:52.640 --> 2:54:56.240]  you won't even get a stimulus check but good

[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:12.000]  imagine imagine well that's what's about to happen
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:14.960]  meanwhile the democrats pushing for more war
[2:56:14.960 --> 2:56:18.480]  senator bob menendez democrat urges biden administration to

[2:59:38.240 --> 2:59:43.280]  shila dixon stealing from the poor and let's just pull up those stories i just
[2:59:43.280 --> 2:59:47.600]  want to document this in live time so somebody pull up shila dixon
[2:59:47.600 --> 2:59:51.840]  convicted stealing from the poor uh and then somebody pull up
[2:59:51.840 --> 2:59:59.600]  stephanie rollings blake uh advocated for baltimore riots
[2:59:59.680 --> 3:00:04.640]  and then pull up cathrin pew rated by the fbi for taking bribe so the last
[3:00:04.640 --> 3:00:12.560]  three mayors of baltimore have all resigned because of their
[3:00:12.560 --> 3:00:16.640]  scams that they've run and so we're just pulling it all
[3:00:16.640 --> 3:00:20.720]  up right now it's all true so now guys
[3:00:20.720 --> 3:00:25.360]  can i uh are you noticing something here
[3:00:25.360 --> 3:00:28.800]  all of them have something in common
[3:00:28.800 --> 3:00:32.720]  are you guys seeing this i'm just i'm just are am i allowed to say
[3:00:32.720 --> 3:00:36.320]  all of them have something in common
[3:00:37.440 --> 3:00:41.280]  shila dixon stephanie blake and cathrin pew
[3:00:41.280 --> 3:00:45.520]  all have something in common they're black
[3:00:45.520 --> 3:00:49.120]  oh wait oh sorry i'm not supposed to do that my bad
[3:00:49.120 --> 3:00:54.080]  they're women oh wait no wait not sorry no no no you can't say that either
[3:00:54.080 --> 3:00:57.680]  no but what is the actual story here they're all
[3:00:57.680 --> 3:01:00.480]  democrats
[3:01:00.960 --> 3:01:05.600]  doesn't matter the color of a democrat skin doesn't matter whatever gender the
[3:01:05.600 --> 3:01:10.080]  democrat claims they are they're all liars they're all con men they're all
[3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:14.000]  thieves and the only democrats that have any integrity left are leaving at the
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:19.840]  democrat party quickly like vernon jones
[3:01:19.840 --> 3:01:23.360]  so yeah you want to know why your inner cities that are mostly black like
[3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:29.680]  baltimore are falling apart at the seams democrat party leadership
[3:01:29.680 --> 3:01:33.120]  democrat party leadership and the problem is
[3:01:33.120 --> 3:01:36.640]  they always get bailed out by the federal government
[3:01:36.640 --> 3:01:41.200]  and now this latest covid relief bill has done just that for new york for
[3:01:41.200 --> 3:01:45.920]  illinois for california your money is now paying
[3:01:45.920 --> 3:01:50.160]  for new york california and illinois to be so deep in debt
[3:01:50.160 --> 3:01:53.760]  and have a failing economy your tax dollars which of course
[3:01:53.760 --> 3:01:57.520]  aren't your tax dollars anymore they just print money
[3:01:57.520 --> 3:02:01.200]  so why can't i print money why does the government get to just print money
[3:02:01.200 --> 3:02:06.160]  out of hand but i don't and then i have to pay them money to print money
[3:02:06.160 --> 3:02:12.480]  it's all backwards uh more evidence of the total election theft that was nobody
[3:02:12.480 --> 3:02:16.640]  voted for biden mainstream web traffic slumped after
[3:02:16.640 --> 3:02:21.440]  trump left the white house yeah and again uh
[3:02:21.440 --> 3:02:24.880]  there are nobody there's nobody that you can cite that's left
[3:02:24.880 --> 3:02:28.640]  the republican party or the trump support to go democrat there's not a
[3:02:28.640 --> 3:02:32.400]  single one you can't find it but there's entire movements based on
[3:02:32.400 --> 3:02:34.720]  people leaving the left leaving the democrat party
[3:02:34.720 --> 3:02:41.040]  whether it's the uh walk away movement or bledget or any of the other ones
[3:02:41.520 --> 3:02:45.200]  and now all the traffic that would normally be there because
[3:02:45.200 --> 3:02:49.280]  of trump sport is all gone nobody cares about biden
[3:02:49.280 --> 3:02:53.280]  none of biden's white house videos give even get a million views
[3:02:53.280 --> 3:02:56.720]  and and that's including his inauguration video he does live streams
[3:02:56.720 --> 3:03:01.040]  every day they don't even get a thousand people to tune in
[3:03:01.040 --> 3:03:05.680]  he's a fake president he's an ineffectual president
[3:03:05.680 --> 3:03:09.840]  a false president that they installed in there with their massive election theft
[3:03:09.840 --> 3:03:13.040]  campaign of 2020 and all the proof is in the pudding
[3:03:13.040 --> 3:03:16.480]  biden didn't campaign nobody showed up to his events
[3:03:16.480 --> 3:03:21.680]  there's zero interest in a biden event trump meanwhile had the biggest rallies
[3:03:21.680 --> 3:03:25.040]  ever in in political history even during the fake pandemic that they tried to
[3:03:25.040 --> 3:03:28.800]  cancel all of his events still happened biden couldn't debate biden can't do
[3:03:28.800 --> 3:03:31.760]  press conferences biden doesn't know where he is he doesn't remember the
[3:03:31.760 --> 3:03:34.640]  name of his defense secretary he can't even remember the name of the pentagon
[3:03:34.640 --> 3:03:38.400]  remember he forgot the name of obama he even forgot barack obama's name
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:42.640]  his dogs are out of control running around biding security
[3:03:42.640 --> 3:03:47.200]  and there's zero public interest there's zero public support
[3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:50.560]  we're having everything stolen from us right now ladies and gentlemen

[3:04:27.120 --> 3:04:31.120]  me too but listen after all the research all the conflicting studies
[3:04:31.120 --> 3:04:34.880]  after all the squabbling there's one thing almost everyone agrees on
[3:04:34.880 --> 3:04:38.640]  it's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life
[3:04:38.640 --> 3:04:42.240]  and death you probably already believe that i certainly do
[3:04:42.240 --> 3:04:46.000]  so here's the thing i wanted to get past the craziness and find out which
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:49.680]  plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate
[3:04:49.680 --> 3:04:53.920]  some efficacy in immune support now you'll have to sign a waiver but you

[3:08:33.360 --> 3:08:37.920]  by alex jones here coming up shortly on the alex jones show and he'll be
[3:08:37.920 --> 3:08:40.880]  sticking around hosting some of the war room as well with
[3:08:40.880 --> 3:08:48.160]  tom papert live from the great grocery store there
[3:08:48.160 --> 3:08:54.160]  in florida oats seed to table
[3:08:55.040 --> 3:09:01.200]  where it's a revolutionary act to promote freedom and freedom of choice
[3:09:01.200 --> 3:09:07.760]  and breathe air yes it's a revolutionary act down there apparently
[3:09:07.760 --> 3:09:11.040]  and it is interesting as you're watching the live stream there where alex will
[3:09:11.040 --> 3:09:15.040]  be joining us momentarily some people are still wearing their
[3:09:15.040 --> 3:09:20.560]  masks and that's fine others are not the workers are not
[3:09:20.560 --> 3:09:24.400]  but we're about to really face this dichotomy now
[3:09:24.400 --> 3:09:28.560]  in texas and it's going to be happening at a political
[3:09:28.560 --> 3:09:32.560]  level and it's going to be happening at a just a
[3:09:32.560 --> 3:09:37.600]  street level as well where abit with an unelected doctor say that no you have
[3:09:37.600 --> 3:09:41.120]  to wear the mask forever austin you're not free
[3:09:41.120 --> 3:09:44.480]  the i don't know anybody that likes adler by the way
[3:09:44.480 --> 3:09:49.360]  it's kind of like a biden deal somehow gets an office but nobody votes for him
[3:09:49.360 --> 3:09:53.040]  but he says no you're gonna have to wear the mask forever
[3:09:53.040 --> 3:09:55.840]  and i've got this doctor here that you've never heard of and you never elected
[3:09:55.840 --> 3:09:58.880]  but he's now in charge of you he's now in charge of you and your
[3:09:58.880 --> 3:10:02.800]  life and your body so wear the mask even though texas just said no we're not
[3:10:02.800 --> 3:10:05.360]  wearing the mask but but but don't worry they're
[3:10:05.360 --> 3:10:08.480]  going to pass texas hb3 and they'll they'll force you to take a vaccine and
[3:10:08.480 --> 3:10:11.520]  wear a mask eventually anyway so just be ready for that
[3:10:11.520 --> 3:10:16.080]  he'll pass that tomorrow as my guess i pray they don't
[3:10:16.080 --> 3:10:20.240]  but it will be introduced tomorrow
[3:10:21.200 --> 3:10:24.160]  but you're going to see now and i already saw this morning just running
[3:10:24.160 --> 3:10:27.680]  some errands and i'm going to be doing more observation tonight and over the
[3:10:27.680 --> 3:10:30.960]  course of the rest of this weekend weekend
[3:10:30.960 --> 3:10:37.200]  are people going to comply with the alien takeover put the face mask on
[3:10:37.200 --> 3:10:41.200]  breathe your own carbon emissions or are they going to embrace
[3:10:41.200 --> 3:10:46.080]  freedom here in austin texas
[3:10:46.160 --> 3:10:50.720]  but see the pressure i think people are over adler and nobody likes the guy
[3:10:50.720 --> 3:10:54.080]  so it's not going to be adler that puts on the pressure it's going to be
[3:10:54.080 --> 3:10:57.440]  liberals okay that's who it's going to be
[3:10:57.440 --> 3:11:00.480]  and um
[3:11:03.200 --> 3:11:08.000]  well i'll just say this uh where i go work out
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:14.400]  it's been a struggle because everyone hates the masks but
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:18.160]  they have democrats that work out of this gym
[3:11:18.160 --> 3:11:21.360]  and whenever they see somebody not wearing a mask they call corporate and
[3:11:21.360 --> 3:11:24.160]  they go complain to the general manager i'm not
[3:11:24.160 --> 3:11:29.840]  kidding you in fact i mean i i'll just say it
[3:11:29.840 --> 3:11:33.600]  i just don't want to give away too many details uh i mean we got a group up
[3:11:33.600 --> 3:11:37.280]  there we play basketball regularly and and folks i'm not even
[3:11:37.280 --> 3:11:41.520]  kidding you it started up about two or three
[3:11:41.520 --> 3:11:46.320]  months ago whenever they they reopened the courts and we're letting guys play
[3:11:46.320 --> 3:11:50.240]  and we would go out there and we'd be playing ball and and and it would always
[3:11:50.240 --> 3:11:53.520]  be women and they'd come into the gym and they would start
[3:11:53.520 --> 3:11:57.920]  filming us and so nobody really knew what was going on
[3:11:57.920 --> 3:12:01.200]  and you know i always have the instinct as oh is somebody trying to dox me or
[3:12:01.200 --> 3:12:04.400]  you know say this is where he works out come attack him
[3:12:04.400 --> 3:12:07.040]  or is just somebody who just wants to be like hey look guys are playing ball at
[3:12:07.040 --> 3:12:10.800]  the gym or you know i don't know but it kept happening over and over and then
[3:12:10.800 --> 3:12:15.200]  we caught on because after it happened
[3:12:15.200 --> 3:12:19.360]  every time a general manager or a worker would come over and either shut us
[3:12:19.360 --> 3:12:23.280]  down or tell us to put masks on and so then we put two and two together
[3:12:23.280 --> 3:12:28.000]  so liberal democrats would see guys in a this is a totally separate building by
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:31.520]  the way doors everything and they would come
[3:12:31.520 --> 3:12:37.440]  into the gym to film us playing basketball and then they would send the
[3:12:37.440 --> 3:12:40.800]  video to corporate and show the video to the front desk
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:45.920]  and say look they're not wearing masks oh but you're such a you're so afraid you
[3:12:45.920 --> 3:12:50.000]  come into the different building where we're at
[3:12:51.760 --> 3:12:55.760]  and so there was a little pushback a little back and forth
[3:12:55.760 --> 3:13:00.640]  we won in the long run but still to this day
[3:13:00.640 --> 3:13:04.320]  every time we're in there playing basketball by the way running up and down
[3:13:04.320 --> 3:13:08.800]  the the court the cdc even says not to wear a mask while you're working out
[3:13:08.800 --> 3:13:11.840]  it's it's you know because breathing in your own carbon dioxide emissions are
[3:13:11.840 --> 3:13:15.200]  bad and you need increased oxygen levels when you have heavy
[3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:18.480]  exercise and your your your heart is pumping the blood
[3:13:18.480 --> 3:13:23.600]  it's science but you know don't tell the democrats still to this day
[3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:29.040]  every time we play ball somebody comes in and films us so they can complain to
[3:13:29.040 --> 3:13:35.520]  corporate that's how pathetic our liberal counterparts are
[3:13:36.720 --> 3:13:40.560]  see these people are totalitarian it was never about a virus
[3:13:40.560 --> 3:13:44.560]  it was never about a face mask it was never about saving grandma or this or
[3:13:44.560 --> 3:13:47.840]  that or the other thing it was always about control
[3:13:47.840 --> 3:13:50.640]  it was always about forcing their will on you
[3:13:50.640 --> 3:13:54.080]  and forcing you to join their cult that's what it's always been about
[3:13:54.080 --> 3:13:57.360]  that's what it's always going to be about and that's why the average liberal is
[3:13:57.360 --> 3:14:02.240]  the most dishonest faux intellectual person
[3:14:02.240 --> 3:14:07.200]  that you will ever meet in your life and yeah i'll sit here and say it not all
[3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:09.280]  of course not all i have friends that are liberals they'll have real
[3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:12.160]  conversations we'll disagree on stuff and that's fine
[3:14:12.160 --> 3:14:17.680]  not these people not the people in the liberal death cult
[3:14:17.680 --> 3:14:21.920]  walking around wearing two masks three masks now because it's all a virtue
[3:14:21.920 --> 3:14:26.400]  signal and so i saw it in austin today
[3:14:26.400 --> 3:14:30.480]  oh the libs are wearing their masks they're wearing three masks four masks
[3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:35.200]  and they have their chests pumped out because they're making their statement
[3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:39.760]  they're making their statement now and then some fat ass
[3:14:39.760 --> 3:14:43.040]  will come up to you weighing 400 pounds and tell you
[3:14:43.040 --> 3:14:50.160]  you're making things dangerous for me hey here's an idea go run a lap
[3:14:52.240 --> 3:14:56.560]  oh and it comes out i mean think about it yeah the science let me tell you
[3:14:56.560 --> 3:15:01.200]  about the science the data let me tell you about the data
[3:15:01.200 --> 3:15:10.640]  over 70 percent of covid deaths came from people who were obese
[3:15:10.640 --> 3:15:15.360]  over 70 percent of covid deaths had co-morbidities
[3:15:15.360 --> 3:15:19.200]  so folks it's literally people showing up weighing 400 pounds with cancer
[3:15:19.200 --> 3:15:22.720]  that die and they say it's covid
[3:15:24.160 --> 3:15:28.000]  it's a blanket statement but it's it's diabetes it's it's cancer it's old age
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:32.560]  it's all this other stuff and they just say oh it's covid
[3:15:35.920 --> 3:15:39.840]  yeah your 400 pounds and your body has to
[3:15:39.840 --> 3:15:43.680]  to heat up and fight a virus and your white blood cells are basically
[3:15:43.680 --> 3:15:49.200]  worthless because you're so unhealthy yeah that virus could kill you
[3:15:49.200 --> 3:15:53.200]  especially if you don't get your right vitamin d vitamin e and the rest of it
[3:15:53.200 --> 3:15:57.920]  but hey don't let that get in the way of a good democrat tyrannical takeover
[3:15:57.920 --> 3:16:04.080]  so i'm really looking forward to all the libtards that are going to be telling
[3:16:04.080 --> 3:16:08.240]  me to wear a mask i'm telling you because now they're making their statement
[3:16:08.240 --> 3:16:13.760]  i'm now going to be making my statement i've been i mean i i've posted videos
[3:16:13.760 --> 3:16:16.800]  of some confrontations i've had but for the most part i've not wanted to be
[3:16:16.800 --> 3:16:19.680]  too confrontational i'll wear it to walk in and then pull it down and then
[3:16:19.680 --> 3:16:24.880]  nobody says anything to me uh i'm not even gonna give them that anymore
[3:16:24.880 --> 3:16:30.560]  and they will be hearing from me if they want to get in my face about a mask
[3:16:30.640 --> 3:16:33.440]  and by the way you know that one there was a video from i think it was new jersey
[3:16:33.440 --> 3:16:37.200]  this one girl who gets in an uber car and she got a little physical with him
[3:16:37.200 --> 3:16:40.080]  probably a mistake which she did admit to but you know what
[3:16:40.080 --> 3:16:42.800]  she had a little follow-up to that and you know what she's actually i she's
[3:16:42.800 --> 3:16:45.760]  kind of right i mean i feel bad for the driver he gets caught in the face but
[3:16:45.760 --> 3:16:48.960]  it's a fake pandemic anyway but uh the girl made a point i mean
[3:16:48.960 --> 3:16:53.040]  he wanted to drop her off in the middle of a road and then talk about a mask
[3:16:53.040 --> 3:16:56.160]  you know listeners call into the cell when they thank me and
[3:16:56.160 --> 3:17:00.960]  it makes me feel pathetic because i sit there and i beg you for support
[3:17:00.960 --> 3:17:05.760]  constantly for prayer for financial support and for word of mouth and then
[3:17:05.760 --> 3:17:09.360]  we're all this together and i you know it gets old having to come to you and say
[3:17:09.360 --> 3:17:12.560]  hey i got great products please buy them or we won't be here on air but it's
[3:17:12.560 --> 3:17:15.600]  true we're the only media organization in the united states that promotes
[3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:19.520]  liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors
[3:17:19.520 --> 3:17:22.480]  and they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else they crippled all the
[3:17:22.480 --> 3:17:26.000]  other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order
[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:29.760]  comes out in the open our credibility is going up that's why we've got to be
[3:17:29.760 --> 3:17:33.040]  taken off air that's why america has got to be taken down you can't have all
[3:17:33.040 --> 3:17:36.800]  these other nations enslaved and america is still quasi free

[3:17:59.440 --> 3:18:02.960]  do what you're told and it's all going to pass but if you study
[3:18:02.960 --> 3:18:05.600]  authoritarians if you study the globalists you understand that they
[3:18:05.600 --> 3:18:09.200]  reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of
[3:18:09.200 --> 3:18:12.800]  being cold being totally enslaved and because the globalists see us as weak
[3:18:12.800 --> 3:18:15.840]  and see us as stupid they are now making that move and they
[3:18:15.840 --> 3:18:19.200]  are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then
[3:18:19.200 --> 3:18:23.280]  flood us with the third world that the un will use as a weapon
[3:18:23.280 --> 3:18:26.400]  to then have us under such a crises under such a load
[3:18:26.400 --> 3:18:29.920]  capitulate to the un whatever agreements they want us to sign
[3:18:29.920 --> 3:18:33.680]  hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees
[3:18:33.680 --> 3:18:38.800]  not fleeing covid or climate change as the un and claus schwaver saying and
[3:18:38.800 --> 3:18:42.800]  bill gates is saying but fleeing the year-long lockdowns
[3:18:42.800 --> 3:18:46.080]  that the un and bill gates ordered them to institute
[3:18:46.080 --> 3:18:49.520]  or they wouldn't get more imf and world bank money
[3:18:49.520 --> 3:18:53.520]  and that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists
[3:18:53.520 --> 3:18:57.520]  the general public has finally figured out why i'm upset
[3:18:57.520 --> 3:19:00.720]  they figured out the globalists are literally trying to kill us they're
[3:19:00.720 --> 3:19:05.040]  trying to take over civilization and society and they depend on the public
[3:19:05.040 --> 3:19:07.760]  being ignorant that's what jesus said my people
[3:19:07.760 --> 3:19:12.640]  perish for lack of knowledge knowledge is power like our bodies
[3:19:12.640 --> 3:19:17.200]  are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential
[3:19:17.200 --> 3:19:20.560]  vitamins and minerals and that's why they don't want you to know about
[3:19:20.560 --> 3:19:23.680]  essential vitamins and minerals because it's so simple because you won't be
[3:19:23.680 --> 3:19:26.880]  under their control anymore well the vitamin mineral fusion

[3:20:06.560 --> 3:20:10.560]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer and i don't have time to tell you
[3:20:10.560 --> 3:20:13.600]  all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons i can't tell you what's

[3:20:36.960 --> 3:20:39.360]  truth that's why the globalists are censoring
[3:20:39.360 --> 3:20:42.720]  they can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us from the air

[3:20:51.760 --> 3:20:55.120]  to destroy everything we ever said
[3:20:55.120 --> 3:21:16.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:21:16.560 --> 3:21:21.600]  well i tell you a lot of the folks at this pat grocery store can't hear the
[3:21:21.600 --> 3:21:23.600]  music we're piping them they can hear my voice
[3:21:23.600 --> 3:21:26.720]  i'm listening to andy griffin's and the theme song
[3:21:26.720 --> 3:21:30.160]  from the andy griffin's show let me tell you oak farms
[3:21:30.160 --> 3:21:34.800]  seed to table is as close to mayberry rfb as you should get
[3:21:34.800 --> 3:21:38.800]  people aren't wearing the cult mask in here people are awake
[3:21:38.800 --> 3:21:43.680]  they know what's going on and america is popular and i am so proud of texas and
[3:21:43.680 --> 3:21:47.040]  the people of texas there's a lot of the great people around the country
[3:21:47.040 --> 3:21:51.040]  whether they're from new jersey or even california there's a lot of good
[3:21:51.040 --> 3:21:54.880]  people but i got to give credit where credit's due
[3:21:54.880 --> 3:21:58.480]  florida with its people and its governor
[3:21:58.480 --> 3:22:03.600]  has been and people like matt gates florida is the first to make it criminal
[3:22:03.600 --> 3:22:05.920]  for big tech to censor people now they're taking action
[3:22:05.920 --> 3:22:09.760]  florida is the first to come out and say the master garbage florida is the
[3:22:09.760 --> 3:22:13.440]  first this whole damn time to be bucking the system
[3:22:13.440 --> 3:22:17.440]  and now your governor is continuing to lead the way
[3:22:17.440 --> 3:22:21.280]  and so i just want to say that we salute florida
[3:22:21.280 --> 3:22:25.440]  and as soon as our fake texas governor greg abbott
[3:22:25.440 --> 3:22:28.960]  saw all the incredible things that the santas and others are doing here
[3:22:28.960 --> 3:22:32.800]  he began to file a suit and his approval rating went back up by the way so who
[3:22:32.800 --> 3:22:36.000]  knew freedom was popular i was just listening to holland shroyer my
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:40.560]  great co-host of my show the auction show he's the main host of the war room
[3:22:40.560 --> 3:22:44.400]  he was talking about now the leftists are wearing three or four masks they're
[3:22:44.400 --> 3:22:49.040]  doing it all over la all over new york all over austin texas
[3:22:49.040 --> 3:22:52.240]  so a lot of the new yorkers are fleeing
[3:22:52.240 --> 3:22:54.880]  collapsing new york but they're actually trying to leave
[3:22:54.880 --> 3:22:58.880]  what made new york bad californians for some reason are bringing all their
[3:22:58.880 --> 3:23:02.560]  problems to texas and acting just like they did there what
[3:23:02.560 --> 3:23:05.440]  is their problem oh and shroyer i've got a lot to cover here
[3:23:05.440 --> 3:23:09.120]  today a lot to go over with you alfie oaks is going to be here a little bit
[3:23:09.120 --> 3:23:12.400]  later i probably in the last hour or less i'm going to a tour here but i had to
[3:23:12.400 --> 3:23:16.240]  come see this piece of americana i know you're a big fan of it i know you've
[3:23:16.240 --> 3:23:18.800]  checked it out i know that some of the other crew
[3:23:18.800 --> 3:23:22.720]  has checked it out and they're big fans i tell you this needs to be duplicated
[3:23:22.720 --> 3:23:26.720]  all over the country and it's starting to as people dawn to the fact that they're
[3:23:26.720 --> 3:23:30.640]  never going to take the mask off it's a symbol of humans being evil and world
[3:23:30.640 --> 3:23:34.400]  government the great reset and almost nobody i see even in in now
[3:23:34.400 --> 3:23:39.360]  naples is wearing the damn things except for some of the tourists that are
[3:23:39.360 --> 3:23:43.680]  visiting and they're getting deprogrammed really really quickly but i don't
[3:23:43.680 --> 3:23:46.240]  worry about it there are real viruses that will kill you that are in the hammer
[3:23:46.240 --> 3:23:48.800]  and i'm not even the healthiest as i work around the clock and do a lot of
[3:23:48.800 --> 3:23:51.280]  stuff uh but i i know how to be healthy and i know
[3:23:51.280 --> 3:23:54.480]  why i never really get sick and that is vitamins and minerals you get from
[3:23:54.480 --> 3:23:57.600]  fresh food and vegetables and also from supplementation so we want people to
[3:23:57.600 --> 3:24:00.560]  think uh you know there is an issue but like oh i was
[3:24:00.560 --> 3:24:04.000]  saying if you're obese and i'm starting to get there just from the stress i'll
[3:24:04.000 --> 3:24:06.880]  lose the weight don't worry that puts you up there but if you don't have vitamins
[3:24:06.880 --> 3:24:10.000]  minerals you're a dead duck that's the number one thing but they don't want you
[3:24:10.000 --> 3:24:12.960]  to know that all these antifofocus that look like they've been
[3:24:12.960 --> 3:24:16.960]  hiding a cave somewhere for 10 000 years oh and shroyer what do you make of all
[3:24:16.960 --> 3:24:20.800]  this well i'm going to be observing very closely over the next
[3:24:20.800 --> 3:24:24.720]  course of the five days or over the weekend alex to see what it looks like
[3:24:24.720 --> 3:24:27.920]  in society out here in austin i will tell you just from a couple uh erin's i ran
[3:24:27.920 --> 3:24:32.080]  this morning the mask enforcement i did not receive any
[3:24:32.080 --> 3:24:36.000]  enforcement and uh usually i would just to walk into a
[3:24:36.000 --> 3:24:38.880]  store i'll put the mask on then i take it off and they don't harass me or the
[3:24:38.880 --> 3:24:41.680]  gym or something like that well i'm not doing that anymore i'm not
[3:24:41.680 --> 3:24:45.360]  capitulating one percent anymore i'm not gonna put it around my head you're
[3:24:45.360 --> 3:24:48.960]  not even gonna see it and if they really get bold with me i'm going to take my
[3:24:48.960 --> 3:24:52.400]  stand now because this is it alex this is where we have to take our stand
[3:24:52.400 --> 3:24:56.160]  this is the culture war happening right now and if we take a knee
[3:24:56.160 --> 3:24:59.920]  if we step back right now then we're going to be masked up forever
[3:24:59.920 --> 3:25:03.200]  and and and you know that like i said though they're wearing two three masks
[3:25:03.200 --> 3:25:06.480]  to make their statement alex they're virtue signaling harder than ever
[3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:10.960]  so we have to go with the truth harder than ever and let them know hey
[3:25:10.960 --> 3:25:13.760]  you say carbon dioxide emissions are killing the planet
[3:25:13.760 --> 3:25:17.280]  you're sucking them in at dangerous levels right now you're gonna die from
[3:25:17.280 --> 3:25:21.360]  that by your own logic why are you wearing that mask but see by their own
[3:25:21.360 --> 3:25:23.920]  logic they're telling us that we're dirty we're evil we're the great research
[3:25:23.920 --> 3:25:25.920]  that we need to die that's actually what they're doing
[3:25:25.920 --> 3:25:28.480]  and the funny thing about most leftists is they know they're part of a death
[3:25:28.480 --> 3:25:33.120]  cult and they see this as all of us submitting to them and going down
[3:25:33.120 --> 3:25:36.880]  with the ship so i guess we're actually here in the last hour
[3:25:36.880 --> 3:25:42.240]  of the alex jones show we've got the uh war room coming up i i i get all my
[3:25:42.240 --> 3:25:46.080]  time zones all my time zones mixed up here oh and but
[3:25:46.080 --> 3:25:49.200]  there's so much to get into but i started the broadcast today and then i went
[3:25:49.200 --> 3:25:52.880]  to a very interesting talk with somebody but i'll get to uh later once we're
[3:25:52.880 --> 3:25:55.760]  able to release information about it very very exciting things happening here
[3:25:55.760 --> 3:26:00.160]  in florida i'll leave it at that but what do you make of the wall street journal
[3:26:00.160 --> 3:26:03.840]  saying oh are you calling for violence when you say they're doing secret
[3:26:03.840 --> 3:26:08.240]  experimentation on us an offensive biological attack and that
[3:26:08.240 --> 3:26:11.200]  we have to start having a discussion about defending ourselves yes
[3:26:11.200 --> 3:26:14.400]  when the state comes and injects a bunch of newborn babies with an
[3:26:14.400 --> 3:26:17.520]  experimental illegal vaccine that they admit and scientists say shouldn't be
[3:26:17.520 --> 3:26:22.320]  given to them and they die grand juries need to indict
[3:26:22.320 --> 3:26:25.680]  the hospital workers that give that to the more babies if they get sicker die
[3:26:25.680 --> 3:26:29.440]  and they need to send them to prison i don't care if the federal government
[3:26:29.440 --> 3:26:31.920]  gives liability protection to vaccine makers
[3:26:31.920 --> 3:26:35.200]  they're trying to send it to medical workers just like the governor
[3:26:35.200 --> 3:26:39.040]  uh virginia said a few years ago cheap baby talk to boo
[3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:43.120]  and they keep babies alive and harvest their organs this is dehumanization
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:45.840]  they don't want to just kill our great old people or unborn babies
[3:26:45.840 --> 3:26:49.680]  they want us all they want us to be a commodity they don't want us to stand
[3:26:49.680 --> 3:26:53.040]  together for human life we need to be territorial about human life we need to
[3:26:53.040 --> 3:26:56.720]  stand together and say to the globalist we know about your plan
[3:26:56.720 --> 3:27:00.160]  we're aware of your criminal activity and we know you're assaulting us
[3:27:00.160 --> 3:27:06.000]  and you are unknown us to cease and assist your renewal order take over now
[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:12.400]  yeah i love the remote setting that brings you back to my old days in
[3:27:12.400 --> 3:27:15.280]  radio it's really a classic thing the remote radio broadcast
[3:27:15.280 --> 3:27:18.400]  uh you know you've been saying something for years though alex is that and it's
[3:27:18.400 --> 3:27:22.880]  just basic psychology you know we project our intentions or our goodness
[3:27:22.880 --> 3:27:27.680]  onto others so i get maybe 10 percent of the media inquiries probably less but
[3:27:27.680 --> 3:27:30.880]  um and and so when i would have people ask me about hey what do you think about
[3:27:30.880 --> 3:27:35.440]  this and january 6 and that or or back in the day i would always respond
[3:27:35.440 --> 3:27:38.480]  thinking that they had good intentions they wanted to write the real story
[3:27:38.480 --> 3:27:43.040]  they actually use my quotes every damn time unless it's you know the
[3:27:43.040 --> 3:27:46.320]  gateway pun international file or something like that every damn time
[3:27:46.320 --> 3:27:50.000]  it's a hit piece every damn time they take my words out of context or cut
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:53.760]  them up every time without fail so it's to the point now alex i don't take any
[3:27:53.760 --> 3:27:56.880]  media inquiries i don't even respond to these people
[3:27:56.880 --> 3:28:00.560]  because all they do is lie and twist and contort and it's sad it's sad that
[3:28:00.560 --> 3:28:04.080]  that's where we're at now in society where hey you're gonna write about me
[3:28:04.080 --> 3:28:08.160]  here's here's what i say about it but now now it's safer for me to just step
[3:28:08.160 --> 3:28:10.960]  back and say i'm not gonna comment in the story you're writing about me
[3:28:10.960 --> 3:28:15.600]  because you're just gonna lie and deceive and twist well that's right now when i
[3:28:15.600 --> 3:28:19.920]  respond to mainstream media i will do it on air and that way their name is
[3:28:19.920 --> 3:28:23.280]  out there and it's on record what i really said because he sends me all these
[3:28:23.280 --> 3:28:27.120]  clips about oh are you calling for violence you know and
[3:28:27.120 --> 3:28:30.720]  no i said they're assaulting us violating the nuremberg code
[3:28:30.720 --> 3:28:34.240]  violating the janiba convention i'm against the offensive violence but
[3:28:34.240 --> 3:28:37.440]  they're coming with violence with these poison vaccines and secret
[3:28:37.440 --> 3:28:41.360]  experimentation and illegal activity and they're banning these mrna vaccines
[3:28:41.360 --> 3:28:46.160]  from south africa to switzerland to india and then you you go hey you're
[3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:49.920]  calling for violence no you are assaulting us you're telling us we're
[3:28:49.920 --> 3:28:52.880]  not essential you're saying our businesses aren't essential but your big
[3:28:52.880 --> 3:28:56.240]  tech is as china makes more billionaires than all the other
[3:28:56.240 --> 3:29:00.800]  billionaires combined in one year this is an authoritarian globalist takeover
[3:29:00.800 --> 3:29:05.200]  and ground zero fighting it is oak farms ced to table
[3:29:05.200 --> 3:29:19.120]  enable florida is leading the way for usa
[3:29:19.120 --> 3:29:25.680]  usa usa usa and i'll tell you something america's perfect
[3:29:25.680 --> 3:29:30.560]  but compared to communist chinese the eu the the old new world order
[3:29:30.560 --> 3:29:34.080]  it's the idea that's a hell of a lot better than tyranny and we're fighting
[3:29:34.080 --> 3:29:37.920]  for it against the globalists and that's why we salute all the veterans and all
[3:29:37.920 --> 3:29:43.440]  the patriots who stood up against tyranny so this republic still exists
[3:29:43.440 --> 3:29:47.280]  and i think uh yeah big tip of the hat you gotta love what's going on in
[3:29:47.280 --> 3:29:51.920]  florida alex uh missouri south dakota north dakota some of the midwest states
[3:29:51.920 --> 3:29:56.000]  and i hope that texas culturally and politically
[3:29:56.000 --> 3:30:00.080]  fights to take the lead role in this and and adler i don't know if this is texas
[3:30:00.080 --> 3:30:05.040]  this is fight under the un chicom california commie invasion they're
[3:30:05.040 --> 3:30:07.920]  like locus that have already destroyed their states now they're coming to eat
[3:30:07.920 --> 3:30:11.920]  us in texas and we've got to wake up out of our coma and say no to the leftist
[3:30:11.920 --> 3:30:15.840]  because they've used texas hospitality to train us to bow down to the left and
[3:30:15.840 --> 3:30:19.680]  texas is almost blue and is dying and next we'll destroy florida and every
[3:30:19.680 --> 3:30:24.560]  other state we gotta stop surrendering to the leftist they're a cult of evil
[3:30:24.560 --> 3:30:27.920]  well we're gonna have the political battle here in texas alex adler already
[3:30:27.920 --> 3:30:31.280]  came out and said nope austin has a mask mandate we don't care what the governor
[3:30:31.280 --> 3:30:35.280]  says but ken paxton the attorney said general said they're exploring every
[3:30:35.280 --> 3:30:40.160]  avenue to fight back against this so steve adler the mayor of austin texas
[3:30:40.160 --> 3:30:43.920]  needs to be sued he needs to be sued for his
[3:30:43.920 --> 3:30:47.760]  adlers to degenerate a piece of filth all right we'll be right back on the

[3:35:24.160 --> 3:35:38.000]  so
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:42.560]  live ladies and gentlemen i want to get a fellow i've known
[3:35:42.560 --> 3:35:45.360]  in austin for years richard scott to come up here
[3:35:45.360 --> 3:35:48.880]  started the next segment to pop it and say hi because he was up there in dc on
[3:35:48.880 --> 3:35:51.600]  the 6th of january to give his take on what he witnessed
[3:35:51.600 --> 3:35:54.640]  he's here with his wife and his son he's an author
[3:35:54.640 --> 3:35:58.400]  two dozen books and he's just going to pop in because he's he's a great guy and
[3:35:58.400 --> 3:36:01.760]  i've seen him at many rallies over the years
[3:36:01.760 --> 3:36:05.520]  and also i ran into him one time when my car wouldn't start and he helped me out
[3:36:05.520 --> 3:36:11.120]  but long story short he was out there when we were there in april of last year
[3:36:11.120 --> 3:36:13.760]  saying the lockdowns will never end almost a
[3:36:13.760 --> 3:36:17.200]  almost a year ago i guess more than a year ago now gosh
[3:36:17.200 --> 3:36:21.520]  that the lockdowns would never end and that this was a total police state
[3:36:21.520 --> 3:36:26.080]  uh takeover this was march or rather so about a year ago march and every week
[3:36:26.080 --> 3:36:29.600]  we protested so that shows how premeditated and how
[3:36:29.600 --> 3:36:33.120]  evil this is but going back to owens shroyer who's
[3:36:33.120 --> 3:36:36.160]  hosting the last segment here at my show and i'll be co-hosting uh with him
[3:36:36.160 --> 3:36:39.360]  coming up on the war room today in the next three
[3:36:39.360 --> 3:36:43.360]  hours and albie oaks is going to be here in studio with us coming up in about an
[3:36:43.360 --> 3:36:47.840]  hour uh from now as well during the war room today
[3:36:47.840 --> 3:36:51.120]  but oh and when i see these articles every day it's not like oh
[3:36:51.120 --> 3:36:54.960]  i've got 20 more articles about people dying after they took a covid vaccine
[3:36:54.960 --> 3:36:58.720]  i'm just like how the hell is this happening and look at how targeted
[3:36:58.720 --> 3:37:03.840]  america is they're giving only certain areas
[3:37:03.840 --> 3:37:07.440]  areas of africa areas the u.s areas of australia
[3:37:07.440 --> 3:37:12.080]  areas of canada and a few areas of europe these particular vaccines that are
[3:37:12.080 --> 3:37:14.720]  killing so many people so that's why south africa's
[3:37:14.720 --> 3:37:18.320]  bandit that's why switzerland's bandit a bunch of other countries india has
[3:37:18.320 --> 3:37:23.280]  bandit but not here in the united states and so they're just testing
[3:37:23.280 --> 3:37:26.080]  to see how dumb we are and how many people
[3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:30.880]  they can kill and so let's go ahead and play this local cbs newscast at austral
[3:37:30.880 --> 3:37:34.640]  texas was talking about utah this is a young woman mother of a nine-year-old
[3:37:34.640 --> 3:37:36.960]  totally healthy worked in the doctor's office
[3:37:36.960 --> 3:37:40.320]  stepped up and took the vaccine as their air force veteran dad says
[3:37:40.320 --> 3:37:43.440]  she was his favorite child the one who was going to take care of when he was old
[3:37:43.440 --> 3:37:46.880]  and it's so hard was he said you know i'm much sadder than when my dad died
[3:37:46.880 --> 3:37:49.600]  because your dad probably died of natural causes and he died old
[3:37:49.600 --> 3:37:53.840]  your daughter your future your granddaughter's mother
[3:37:53.840 --> 3:37:57.760]  dead days after she took it and it's the same story
[3:37:57.760 --> 3:38:00.480]  they murdered hank erin they're murdering everybody
[3:38:00.480 --> 3:38:04.720]  it's all a test to see how they can kill and then to get the doctors and lawyers
[3:38:04.720 --> 3:38:07.520]  involved to cover up for it because they're going to feel like they're
[3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:10.080]  guilty so they know the reverse psychology the average
[3:38:10.080 --> 3:38:14.080]  doctor or nurse who wasn't part of this will then go along with this
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:17.600]  secret experimentation because they won't want to admit they've been part of
[3:38:17.600 --> 3:38:21.280]  evil so that's how this too evil to fail corruption works
[3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:24.560]  and how they get people involved in the corruption
[3:38:24.560 --> 3:38:27.840]  and i wanted to get owen schroyer's take on that but first here's a few minutes
[3:38:27.840 --> 3:38:32.240]  from the heart wrenching newscast that's on info wars dot com
[3:38:32.240 --> 3:38:37.920]  and by the way they're blocking this news piece on facebook on twitter on
[3:38:37.920 --> 3:38:41.840]  youtube and a crime against humanity they're blocking this so they have to
[3:38:41.840 --> 3:38:45.040]  even sell cbs we're not saying vaccines are bad we're not saying just
[3:38:45.040 --> 3:38:48.960]  you should know you should be you should be informed because everybody does know
[3:38:48.960 --> 3:38:53.200]  the vast majority do know they're bad they could have clean vaccines
[3:38:53.200 --> 3:38:56.720]  they could do all this they don't do it because it's a trojan horse it's the
[3:38:56.720 --> 3:39:00.400]  globalist playing god bill gates says he wants to depopulate you
[3:39:00.400 --> 3:39:05.280]  and now he runs this worldwide program learn about it learn about the truth
[3:39:05.280 --> 3:39:09.120]  i met with one of the heads of former heads of the major u.s intelligence
[3:39:09.120 --> 3:39:12.240]  agency today and he was landed all out he goes
[3:39:12.240 --> 3:39:17.040]  they didn't test us on rats they tested on us because they're targeting us
[3:39:17.040 --> 3:39:21.120]  so people always talk about q and all the army intelligence and all that
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:24.320]  that what about real people that have been inside the government know the
[3:39:24.320 --> 3:39:26.240]  truth well they're going to be coming public
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:29.760]  very very soon the globalists are scared ladies and gentlemen
[3:39:29.760 --> 3:39:33.840]  so let's go ahead and play the cbs news clip
[3:39:33.840 --> 3:39:36.480]  on the young beautiful mother no health problems
[3:39:36.480 --> 3:39:40.640]  dead as a doornail after she took the second shot just like hank erin
[3:39:40.640 --> 3:39:45.120]  don't be like hank erin don't let them kill you
[3:39:45.120 --> 3:39:49.360]  last week we brought you an investigation into the covid vaccine side effects
[3:39:49.360 --> 3:39:52.800]  and where to report them during that investigation
[3:39:52.800 --> 3:39:56.160]  we found four reported deaths filed by utah families
[3:39:56.160 --> 3:40:00.560]  and their caregivers one particular case stood out to us a 39 year old single
[3:40:00.560 --> 3:40:03.760]  mom from agden with no known pre-existing conditions
[3:40:03.760 --> 3:40:06.960]  her family sat down with me this weekend as they were saying their final
[3:40:06.960 --> 3:40:10.320]  goodbyes and while they're not against vaccines they do believe
[3:40:10.320 --> 3:40:15.840]  information is power as we all make our own medical decisions
[3:40:17.120 --> 3:40:21.360]  i really didn't cry when my dad died i cry a lot for her
[3:40:21.360 --> 3:40:26.080]  and i'm in a stage in my life where i'm okay with that
[3:40:26.080 --> 3:40:30.000]  alfred holly is a retired fighter pilot a military man
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:33.760]  who's known risk and loss and taken it all in stride
[3:40:33.760 --> 3:40:37.680]  until now she's the one that had promised to take care of me when i was old
[3:40:37.680 --> 3:40:41.200]  the death of his youngest daughter cassidy came out of nowhere
[3:40:41.200 --> 3:40:44.640]  four days after her second dose of the covid vaccine
[3:40:44.640 --> 3:40:49.200]  she came in early and said that her heart was racing
[3:40:49.200 --> 3:40:52.720]  cassidy and her nine-year-old daughter lived with her parents
[3:40:52.720 --> 3:40:59.760]  she got sick right away soreness at the shot location
[3:40:59.760 --> 3:41:06.560]  then she started getting sick then uh she started complaining that uh
[3:41:06.560 --> 3:41:09.840]  she was drinking lots of fluids but she couldn't pee and
[3:41:09.840 --> 3:41:13.360]  and then she felt a little bit better the next day
[3:41:13.360 --> 3:41:18.400]  cassidy was a surgical tech for a plastic surgeon and stepped up to get the shot
[3:41:18.400 --> 3:41:23.600]  without hesitation she was absolutely fine with getting a sheet
[3:41:23.600 --> 3:41:27.680]  in fact she told all of us it's fine you guys should all get it
[3:41:27.680 --> 3:41:31.920]  cassidy's sister christin lives in arizona but the two talked every day
[3:41:31.920 --> 3:41:36.800]  you know everybody from her work had kind of had flu-like symptoms so we all
[3:41:36.800 --> 3:41:39.440]  thought that was normal cassidy got the second
[3:41:39.440 --> 3:41:43.680]  Moderna shot on a monday by thursday morning they were in the ER
[3:41:43.680 --> 3:41:47.680]  and answering questions is there any explanation tonight
[3:41:47.680 --> 3:41:53.920]  said that she'd just have the shot and uh they did a blood test and they
[3:41:53.920 --> 3:41:58.160]  immediately came back and said she's really really sick
[3:41:58.160 --> 3:42:02.080]  from the hospital we got a call saying that they were going to
[3:42:02.080 --> 3:42:08.480]  lifelike her to murray trauma center and so i immediately jumped on a plane
[3:42:08.480 --> 3:42:11.920]  at inner mountain doctors work to stabilize cassidy in hopes of a
[3:42:11.920 --> 3:42:18.400]  liver transplant they all went so fast she was healthy
[3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:24.720]  happy active um the greatest mom you ever saw in your life
[3:42:24.720 --> 3:42:28.320]  and then she was so sick that she was
[3:42:28.320 --> 3:42:33.680]  you know in less than probably 12 hours she was intubated and on life support
[3:42:33.680 --> 3:42:39.680]  and then she passed 30 hours after we took her to the
[3:42:39.680 --> 3:42:42.560]  emergency room the state medical examiner's office
[3:42:42.560 --> 3:42:47.280]  cannot comment on the case but spoke to us about if and when an autopsy
[3:42:47.280 --> 3:42:50.880]  would provide answers did the vaccine cause this
[3:42:50.880 --> 3:42:54.240]  i think that would be very hard to demonstrate at autopsy doctor eric
[3:42:54.240 --> 3:42:57.040]  christensen utah's chief medical examiner says
[3:42:57.040 --> 3:43:01.280]  proving vaccine as a cause of death almost never happens
[3:43:01.280 --> 3:43:04.400]  this was an anaphylactic reaction related to this
[3:43:04.400 --> 3:43:08.480]  event but short of that it would be it would be very difficult really i think
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:13.520]  for us to uh you know definitively say this is the
[3:43:13.520 --> 3:43:17.920]  we will post this in full demand on video this segment
[3:43:17.920 --> 3:43:21.280]  and we will post the next segment together explaining
[3:43:21.280 --> 3:43:26.720]  that this is a snuff film cbs news confirms with with state medical
[3:43:26.720 --> 3:43:31.920]  examiner young beautiful mother dead from anaphylactic
