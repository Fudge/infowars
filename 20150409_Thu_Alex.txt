[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:30.520]  Texas Alex Jones it is Thursday the ninth day of April 2015 former special
[00:30.520 --> 00:37.160]  Treasury agent an IRS whistleblower Joe Bannister joins us in a third hour talk
[00:37.160 --> 00:41.440]  about lowest learner won't get any trouble for political persecution of
[00:41.440 --> 00:47.080]  innocent Americans using the fraudulent IRS code selective enforcement and the
[00:47.080 --> 00:51.120]  congressional hearings and the fallout as we learn the IRS is accelerating
[00:51.120 --> 00:56.920]  seizing bank accounts and paychecks when no wrongdoing is even alleged no judge
[00:56.920 --> 01:04.960]  no jury and that ties in to just the incredible benign like a neglect that we
[01:04.960 --> 01:09.640]  see with police response times in this country getting longer and longer and
[01:09.640 --> 01:14.040]  citizens being killed and again it's not the police job to respond and protect
[01:14.040 --> 01:18.680]  you they're gonna respond to quote bring you to justice to the people's court to
[01:18.680 --> 01:24.240]  the jury but John Bout has a report breaking this down because it's not
[01:24.240 --> 01:31.040]  just benign neglect VA makes little headway and fight to shorten waits for
[01:31.040 --> 01:39.800]  care they spin premeditated death lists run by IBM Watson computers on record
[01:39.800 --> 01:44.240]  into oh we need more funding and to fix a problem because there's not enough
[01:44.240 --> 01:50.440]  resources there's plenty of resources they deny the care on purpose it's come
[01:50.440 --> 01:56.840]  out in the documents that's coming up a whitewash by the Associated Press but
[01:56.840 --> 02:00.480]  don't worry the White House has gimmicks for everyone in the White House
[02:00.480 --> 02:07.800]  gender neutral restrooms and of course that's a gimmick on top of a gimmick all
[02:07.800 --> 02:12.840]  it is is a single person restroom they've had forever that says men women
[02:12.840 --> 02:19.840]  baby changing station now they just say trannies an individual restroom is for
[02:19.840 --> 02:24.160]  everyone because one person goes in at a time and I guess as they claim and on
[02:24.160 --> 02:28.320]  Facebook there's 50 different sexes now in this country we're gonna have 50
[02:28.320 --> 02:33.480]  different bathrooms I mean this is just all part of the joke we've got flooding
[02:33.480 --> 02:39.160]  subways and infrastructure explosions almost every day in New York City as
[02:39.160 --> 02:44.160]  steam mains blow up and train derelaments every couple days and
[02:44.160 --> 02:47.880]  infrastructure rotting all over the place and planes crashing at record
[02:47.880 --> 02:53.080]  levels and just things degenerating and identity theft exploding and online
[02:53.080 --> 03:00.440]  fraud off the charts cancer exploding and neurological disorders exploding IQs
[03:00.440 --> 03:07.600]  plummeting but that's not the issue the issue is we need to have special
[03:07.600 --> 03:12.560]  bathrooms for men taking female hormones and then they go oh see you
[03:12.560 --> 03:16.960]  don't have an open mind I don't care I'm sick of hearing about it constantly
[03:16.960 --> 03:25.400]  it's a Psyop joke it's beyond the most wild sardonic

[04:21.920 --> 04:25.800]  why Rand Paul is being attacked from every side because if you look at his
[04:25.800 --> 04:31.320]  politics and where he stands he is the number one candidate to actually win in
[04:31.320 --> 04:36.480]  the 2016 election that's why they now have the little cutesy info babes at

[08:24.520 --> 08:33.760]  broadcasting worldwide with our George Washington 1776 banners flying proudly
[08:33.760 --> 08:39.760]  in the control room studio I am your host Alex Jones again thank you so much
[08:39.760 --> 08:49.880]  for joining us on this Thursday the ninth day of April 2015 pretty soon will
[08:49.880 --> 08:56.760]  be halfway to 2015 the time just goes by so quickly well Rand Paul has taken the
[08:56.760 --> 09:01.920]  lead in Iowa as the press both left and right establishment those into
[09:01.920 --> 09:06.760]  overdrive attacks a lot of top Democrats and pundits are saying Hillary
[09:06.760 --> 09:11.160]  Clinton's campaign is in freefall I said weeks ago that's basically a
[09:11.160 --> 09:18.400]  collapsed I don't see that she can be put back together again and Rand Paul as
[09:18.400 --> 09:23.680]  we pointed out two years ago in major polls the senator is one of the only
[09:23.680 --> 09:28.600]  people out there that can bring the country together and defeat a Hillary
[09:28.600 --> 09:33.720]  Clinton or someone else on the control left because of his previous anti-war
[09:33.720 --> 09:39.320]  stance and that's why you got the neocons and rhinos coming out against
[09:39.320 --> 09:43.920]  senator Rand Paul because they've got his phones tapped the government does
[09:43.920 --> 09:48.800]  they know he's a good guy they know he's been a listener of this show for years
[09:48.800 --> 09:55.680]  and been on the broadcast 20 years ago for anybody who ran Paul was and they
[09:55.680 --> 10:01.000]  just can't standing I mean they know he's a patriot and they know his dad's a
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.400]  patriot and by the way Rand Paul and Ron Paul are not radicals in fact they
[10:06.400 --> 10:11.600]  probably wouldn't even be seen as hardcore enough in 1776 just like I
[10:11.600 --> 10:15.800]  probably wouldn't be it's that compared to the radical big government
[10:15.800 --> 10:21.200]  globalist corporate takeover and the socialist underpinning to domesticate
[10:21.200 --> 10:27.960]  the public compared to how radical the establishment is we are radicals I mean
[10:27.960 --> 10:31.640]  I remember five years ago we published the article about the Journal of
[10:31.640 --> 10:36.800]  Bioethics putting out a paper calling for killing kids up to age three and then
[10:36.800 --> 10:42.120]  other bioethics journals calling for killing old people even if they're not
[10:42.120 --> 10:51.120]  sick just get rid of them that's George Bernard Shaw socialist talk you know if
[10:51.120 --> 10:55.160]  the state doesn't have a place for you you die it's the opposite of a loving
[10:55.160 --> 11:00.120]  compassionate take care of the sick and elderly and the young and the infirm and
[11:00.120 --> 11:08.880]  mentally ill it's the opposite it's a eugenics based system and so they've
[11:08.880 --> 11:12.360]  had a whisper campaign by the libertarian groups saying he's not hardcore
[11:12.360 --> 11:15.400]  enough they've got the left attacking him they've got the right wing
[11:15.400 --> 11:23.840]  establishment attacking him because Rand Paul is the real deal that's all I
[11:23.840 --> 11:27.000]  need to know I mean the establishment is attacking him because he's got a real
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.480]  shot at winning and that doesn't mean that Rand Paul would save the world
[11:32.480 --> 11:38.440]  it's just a bell-weather of how libertarian constitutional Americana
[11:38.440 --> 11:44.000]  ideas are coming back into fashion and it's about legalizing freedom and it's
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.160]  not about the left owning certain issues and the controlled right owning
[11:48.160 --> 11:53.840]  certain others it's about people saying we want basic freedom we want small
[11:53.840 --> 11:58.600]  government we want local control we want transparency we don't want foreign
[11:58.600 --> 12:05.280]  bailouts and foreign aid and corporate bailouts and corporate aid it needs to
[12:05.280 --> 12:13.200]  be curtailed plus we're going off the edge of a cliff going bankrupt but I was
[12:13.200 --> 12:17.720]  digressing into the whole discussion of when we first five years ago published
[12:17.720 --> 12:22.480]  article and info wars comm directly linking to the journal of bioethics
[12:22.480 --> 12:27.640]  echoing what had been said by a bunch of other bioethics and people like Peter
[12:27.640 --> 12:32.560]  Singer at Princeton and you know get rid of people up to age 3 age 5 you don't
[12:32.560 --> 12:40.840]  have a use for your kids just kill them folks thought we were making that up they
[12:40.840 --> 12:46.160]  wouldn't even go follow the link to the bioethics site the bioethics journal now
[12:46.160 --> 12:49.120]  that was three four years ago I said five they pull up the article it was
[12:49.120 --> 12:55.040]  actually three and a half years ago nowadays you turn on the news that's
[12:55.040 --> 13:02.360]  all over the place and it just shows how we've been conditioned to despite the
[13:02.360 --> 13:06.480]  fact that we don't like what's happening we still go along with it because we
[13:06.480 --> 13:11.720]  believe we're powerless and that's not really the case and even if Rand Paul
[13:11.720 --> 13:19.880]  runs and doesn't win he is injecting real issues and building a grassroots
[13:19.880 --> 13:27.200]  movement that opposes the status right and the status left that are two birds in
[13:27.200 --> 13:31.680]  the same flock with the same agenda in fact they're not even two birds there
[13:31.680 --> 13:37.280]  are two wings on the same bird of prey that's preying on us I mean look at this
[13:37.280 --> 13:41.360]  AP article makes my blood boil just to read the paragraphs of deception and
[13:41.360 --> 13:47.840]  manipulation and suppression to manipulate the public VA makes little
[13:47.840 --> 13:57.280]  headway and fight to shorten waits for care what a headline
[14:00.320 --> 14:06.600]  VA makes a little headway and fight to shorten waits for care
[14:06.600 --> 14:14.480]  I could read that headline 45 more times VA makes little headway and fight to
[14:14.480 --> 14:20.600]  shorten waits for care what is deceptive in a headline basically every word the
[14:20.600 --> 14:27.520]  VA doesn't want to make headway the VA is the author is the progenitor is the
[14:27.520 --> 14:34.840]  driver is the daddy is the mommy of the massive bloated bureaucracy that's all
[14:34.840 --> 14:41.280]  about attacking and demonizing and stripping the rights of and setting up
[14:41.280 --> 14:45.800]  veterans who were listed by the globalist occupational government as the
[14:45.800 --> 14:53.840]  number one enemy and that's not rhetoric we have an occupational government
[14:53.840 --> 15:00.960]  that's occupying us that is foreign corporate central bank run and they
[15:00.960 --> 15:06.760]  say in all their internal documents that are public that the number one enemy
[15:06.760 --> 15:12.280]  again is the American people who are not criminals if you want basic freedom
[15:12.280 --> 15:15.200]  you're an enemy because these are totalitarians and you stand in the way
[15:15.200 --> 15:20.560]  they know that you at a fundamental level can't be bought off and won't sell
[15:20.560 --> 15:28.840]  out to tearing a year after Americans recoiled see that's meant to placate
[15:28.840 --> 15:34.000]  you oh you recoiled a year after Americans recoiled at new revelations
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.720]  that sick veterans were getting sicker while languishing on wait list no it
[15:37.720 --> 15:43.040]  was don't treat death list just like the National Health Service in England the
[15:43.040 --> 15:47.440]  VA is the model of Obamacare where you will not get the treatment if you are
[15:47.440 --> 15:52.680]  seen as a veteran or old or a smoker you know well yeah we shouldn't have to pay
[15:52.680 --> 15:56.920]  in collectivism for smokers or obese people that's how it starts and then if
[15:56.920 --> 16:00.000]  you're politically correct doesn't matter if you weigh 600 pounds or we're a
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.160]  smoker you're going to get that liver or or that lung surgery but if you're a
[16:04.160 --> 16:07.760]  veteran you're just not going to get it
[16:09.240 --> 16:12.640]  a year after Americans recoiled at new revelations sick veterans were getting
[16:12.640 --> 16:17.000]  sicker while languishing on waiting list and months after the Department of
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.720]  Veterans Affairs instituted major reforms costing billions of dollars
[16:20.720 --> 16:25.760]  government data shows the number of patients facing long waits at VA
[16:25.760 --> 16:34.640]  facilities has not dropped at all really because it's an official policy Joe
[16:34.640 --> 16:42.840]  Biggs in our office went over and over again more than ten times to even get a
[16:42.840 --> 16:46.880]  checkup and they kept recirculating his file saying they didn't have his file
[16:46.880 --> 16:50.520]  go get his file he'd say excuse me and grab the file a lot of getting in there
[16:50.520 --> 16:53.520]  he's told me the stories he grabbed you know I think he's going over the head
[16:53.520 --> 16:57.360]  and camera they grabbed the feed grab the file and there was his file right
[16:57.360 --> 17:02.360]  there they come back a week later we gotta do blood test again we gotta do
[17:02.360 --> 17:08.160]  blood test again we gotta do this other test again and all of that accelerated
[17:08.160 --> 17:12.720]  once he started talking about the Michael Hastings case a few years ago they
[17:12.720 --> 17:19.840]  clearly put you on political lists just like the IRS targets conservatives and
[17:19.840 --> 17:23.760]  Christians and gun owners and veterans and pro-lifers this is a system where
[17:23.760 --> 17:28.080]  the government controls things and gives select corporations the contracts and
[17:28.080 --> 17:33.920]  then prays and persecutes and oppresses everyone who's not basically a party
[17:33.920 --> 17:41.160]  member of the collective a system and now the Democrats want a one-party system
[17:41.160 --> 17:44.560]  they don't even want to have the Republicans to share power with anymore
[17:44.560 --> 17:49.400]  they're moving to implode the borders and bring us in to a North American union
[17:49.400 --> 17:52.080]  where it's a game over
[17:54.320 --> 17:59.800]  and they just go over the VA zone whitewash report
[18:02.400 --> 18:08.720]  and now they've changed the subject saying well we at least had the
[18:08.720 --> 18:15.000]  appointments but the appointments aren't the test aren't the surgeries so
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.600]  there you go that's how they take something so over the top evil and just
[18:18.600 --> 18:23.080]  turn it into some process like watching paint dry
[18:23.720 --> 18:29.640]  and speaking of medical tyranny mental health evaluation ordered for suspect in
[18:29.640 --> 18:33.600]  Sandy Hook harassing calls case I

[23:55.560 --> 24:16.760]  silver lungs.com
[24:16.760 --> 24:22.200]  that must be some kind of way info wars nightly news reporter John Ballin has a
[24:22.200 --> 24:29.000]  very powerful report dealing with the fact that government neglect and not
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.440]  responding to crimes and on top of it trying to disarm the public is
[24:33.440 --> 24:38.680]  complicit in state-sponsored murder basically known by university research
[24:38.680 --> 24:44.920]  as democide that's coming up I want to get into the unfairness of American
[24:44.920 --> 24:49.880]  citizens black white Hispanic Asian it doesn't matter Native American having to
[24:49.880 --> 24:57.320]  pay for Central and South American immigrants who are here illegally and
[24:57.320 --> 25:00.720]  then the immigrants have the nerve to complain are now demanding their
[25:00.720 --> 25:06.080]  families be brought which is part of the plan and again this is the over the top
[25:06.080 --> 25:10.880]  nature of how American hospitality is being used against us when we won't
[25:10.880 --> 25:15.440]  even give the veterans medical care because they're trained killers and the
[25:15.440 --> 25:19.960]  government's done with them they want them to go fight and kill overseas for
[25:19.960 --> 25:23.880]  the globalist but as soon as you come back they fear you they hate you but if
[25:23.880 --> 25:28.200]  you come from socialist countries and will comply and get in line like
[25:28.200 --> 25:34.440]  Venezuela the socialist Obama wants you and by the way historic poll Obama is
[25:34.440 --> 25:42.120]  nearly twice as popular in Cuba as he is in the US what a joke what a sick
[25:42.120 --> 25:47.280]  joke and again people say well I thought he's a corporate fascist why is he a
[25:47.280 --> 25:51.880]  socialist or communist the paradigm that is taught in schools is not the real
[25:51.880 --> 25:55.480]  paradigm when you get into deep political science written by Brzezinski
[25:55.480 --> 26:00.640]  or Carol Quigley or folks against them like the folks that wrote an undercaller
[26:00.640 --> 26:05.720]  conspiracy you learn that the ultra-wretch creates socialism and
[26:05.720 --> 26:09.840]  communism to control the grassroots and make you dependent and they call it a
[26:09.840 --> 26:14.400]  people's paradise when it's a people's nightmare to centralize the power
[26:14.400 --> 26:20.080]  generally to some offshore combine that is funding the communist or socialist
[26:20.080 --> 26:24.320]  regime and that's the IMF World Bank you see the European countries are being
[26:24.320 --> 26:28.440]  brought into conservatorship and imploded into the EU itself that will then be
[26:28.440 --> 26:32.800]  imploded and rolled into the larger unified global government that's the
[26:32.800 --> 26:39.560]  stated trilateralist plan just three days ago Henry Kissinger wrote an open
[26:39.560 --> 26:48.280]  letter saying that and on the heels of that Larry Summers wrote one saying I
[26:48.280 --> 26:55.040]  mean that's what's frustrating is I'm only telling you what they said they're
[26:55.040 --> 27:01.240]  doing so why is the entire media attacking Rand Paul because they know
[27:01.240 --> 27:08.800]  he's a patriot I mean if I wanted to sound big and impressive I'd tell you
[27:08.800 --> 27:12.000]  I've hung out and had dinner with Rand Paul you know 15 years ago but I'm not
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.760]  going to do that because it doesn't even hurting his association with me but I'm
[27:15.760 --> 27:19.480]  not even going to give media matters in the White House what they want they
[27:19.480 --> 27:27.360]  hate Rand Paul regardless because they know he's not a criminal like them and
[27:27.360 --> 27:32.120]  Lee and McAdoo's got a breaking update on him doubling down his rhetoric not
[27:32.120 --> 27:35.560]  backing down when they attack him how dare you not want partial birth abortion
[27:35.560 --> 27:39.040]  what do you want to kill seven-pound babies the doctor said here's Leigh Ann's
[27:39.040 --> 27:44.440]  report the Associated Press tried to corner Senator Rand Paul on abortion
[27:44.440 --> 27:49.320]  Wednesday by asking him to state definitively which exceptions to a ban
[27:49.320 --> 27:54.520]  he'd support when Paul danced around the question the AP dutifully sent the
[27:54.520 --> 27:59.200]  story out hoping that the rest of the media would continue asking him about
[27:59.200 --> 28:03.920]  his stance and that's exactly what happened at a presser yesterday afternoon
[28:03.920 --> 28:06.920]  but this time Paul was ready for them
[28:10.920 --> 28:16.920]  what's the DNC say why don't we ask the DNC is it okay to kill a seven-pound
[28:16.920 --> 28:22.840]  baby in the uterus you go back and you ask Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she's
[28:22.840 --> 28:27.920]  okay with killing a seven-pound baby that is just not yet born yet ask her when
[28:27.920 --> 28:32.360]  life begins exactly and you ask Debbie when she's willing to protect life you
[28:32.360 --> 28:37.600]  get an answer from Debbie come back the DNC head responded rather quickly in an
[28:37.600 --> 28:42.840]  emailed statement Wasserman Schultz said here's an answer I support letting women
[28:42.840 --> 28:46.960]  and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved
[28:46.960 --> 28:53.000]  period and why are you on fire people quickly responded asking if the
[28:53.000 --> 28:58.480]  Democratic Party was united in this extreme stance after all if you say you
[28:58.480 --> 29:03.760]  want abortion handled without government getting involved it means you want
[29:03.760 --> 29:07.920]  zero government restrictions right I mean we'll accept for those government
[29:07.920 --> 29:13.440]  subsidies I'll send it or Paul then crushed it with this reply well it
[29:13.440 --> 29:18.360]  sounds like her answer is yes that she's okay with killing a seven-pound baby and
[29:18.360 --> 29:22.280]  that ladies and gentlemen is how you approach the abortion debate with a
[29:22.280 --> 29:25.960]  partisan media this is Leanne McAdoo reporting and you can read more about
[29:25.960 --> 29:30.880]  this story and others at info wars dot com that's right and see he's not back
[29:30.880 --> 29:34.680]  and down so in the Washington Post and scores of other publications they say
[29:34.680 --> 29:39.120]  he's angry he's upset he's got a problem with women they're starting that new
[29:39.120 --> 29:45.120]  mindless narrative still acting like he's running instiller they're scared of
[29:45.120 --> 29:48.760]  him folks so we should all go vote for Jeff Bush because they like him we're on

[35:55.640 --> 36:00.120]  used to bankrupt the country and that the IRS code is written to imprison
[36:00.120 --> 36:05.200]  innocent people that the big mega banks or tax exempt and he was a high-level
[36:05.200 --> 36:09.280]  agent for just being in there five six years and he was rising the ranks very
[36:09.280 --> 36:12.680]  quickly and he went to superior and said can we disprove this I want to go
[36:12.680 --> 36:16.640]  after these folks but it didn't true publicly I want to speak out against
[36:16.640 --> 36:20.480]  them and they said no you need to just resign right now for even bringing the
[36:20.480 --> 36:26.920]  star attention kind of like if you're in the DEA and you say we're only busted
[36:26.920 --> 36:30.800]  small-time dealers and the drugs they're selling came from up the chain
[36:30.800 --> 36:37.560]  laundered by big banks they go we'll take your resignation right now I've had
[36:37.560 --> 36:43.440]  five or six former top-level DEA agents on I mean I had one who was the head of
[36:43.440 --> 36:49.120]  an entire section all of Central and South America where they had over 200
[36:49.120 --> 36:56.760]  agents Celica still and he said you guys are flying cocaine out of this airport
[36:56.760 --> 37:01.480]  you're flying it right into the US and I know the contacts in Arkansas where it's
[37:01.480 --> 37:06.120]  being flown in and they said you need to step down right now you're gonna end up
[37:06.120 --> 37:12.200]  pushing daisies real fast bubba so what we need is the public to stop being so
[37:12.200 --> 37:20.040]  ridiculously naive about all this and that's happening and that's why the
[37:20.040 --> 37:25.600]  power structure is coming down with both feet but the elite plan I'm bringing
[37:25.600 --> 37:29.800]  America down that's why we have the oldest railways in the world look it up
[37:29.800 --> 37:33.240]  it's why our infrastructure is rotting I mentioned it earlier so Mica ran him
[37:33.240 --> 37:36.840]  with an article backing it up RT bad bridges federal data shows you as
[37:36.840 --> 37:45.180]  infrastructure is crumbling but don't worry they got money to put in
[37:45.180 --> 37:50.280]  transgender restrooms at the White House and again they just make us divert
[37:50.280 --> 37:55.280]  off into these faux rights these little cutesy rights that are funny to
[37:55.280 --> 38:02.080]  billionaires living in hundred million dollar penthouses in New York let us eat
[38:02.080 --> 38:10.240]  cake as things fall apart report 39,000 immigrant kids coming to the US this is
[38:10.240 --> 38:16.860]  the second big wave and that's just a tiny part former DOJ official non-citizen
[38:16.860 --> 38:22.000]  registering to vote through motor voter registration forms across the country
[38:22.000 --> 38:29.160]  daily caller legal fight continues over Obama's executive action on immigration
[38:29.160 --> 38:34.560]  and the White House says that the judge has wrongly continued to prevent those
[38:34.560 --> 38:40.120]  lawful common-sense policies from taking effect I love how everything Obama
[38:40.120 --> 38:44.280]  does is it's just a common-sense lawful you know to just outside of even an
[38:44.280 --> 38:50.280]  executive order or Congress just said the borders open that's totally unfair
[38:50.280 --> 38:56.240]  just to say bring your families bring everything we'll pay for it have a baby
[38:56.240 --> 39:00.200]  for free nobody else in the world does that I mean I saw CNN a month ago
[39:00.200 --> 39:05.200]  advertising it was an advertisement PR article for women of the world to come
[39:05.200 --> 39:10.080]  here and how to fly in a month before how to stay an inexpensive hotel and how
[39:10.080 --> 39:15.320]  to even write that off when you have the baby here and get everything paid for
[39:15.320 --> 39:21.560]  including your plane tickets and I'm like the IRS will swat team me if they
[39:21.560 --> 39:30.280]  think I don't pay him one dollar but newspapers advertise in Mexico and
[39:30.280 --> 39:37.680]  China to come here and have your baby free oh boy there's the headline how
[39:37.680 --> 39:41.480]  far Chinese moms will go to have us babies and then the articles and
[39:41.480 --> 39:47.840]  advertisement on how to do it and how great it is 403 have applied to have
[39:47.840 --> 39:51.800]  Central American relatives rocked to the US through Obama's administration
[39:51.800 --> 39:59.920]  program that has no lemon on approvals that was just announced a month ago and
[39:59.920 --> 40:06.080]  again they make it all about children what a PR coup and then we pick up on
[40:06.080 --> 40:11.080]  how they phrase it like hey so what of a few hundred thousand you know kids came
[40:11.080 --> 40:14.720]  across the border last year and we shipped them into the country their kids
[40:14.720 --> 40:19.720]  but they were with their parents that was only a fraction of the people coming
[40:19.720 --> 40:25.080]  in but see they make it about that and then even I when I cover it make it
[40:25.080 --> 40:30.160]  about the kids they just label things and we all take it bookline and sinker
[40:30.160 --> 40:37.040]  but don't worry Rahm Emanuel the Duke the dawn the godfather of Chicago has
[40:37.040 --> 40:42.080]  been reelected and if you believe that I got a bridge I'm ready to sell you and
[40:42.080 --> 40:46.240]  some oceanfront property in Arizona
[40:47.400 --> 40:51.240]  there's another report I'm going to get into later Obama gun control push
[40:51.240 --> 41:00.800]  backfires as industry sees unprecedented surge more guns sold in 2013 than in any
[41:00.800 --> 41:06.400]  previous time triple what it was just a decade before we're gonna go over those
[41:06.400 --> 41:13.800]  numbers out of the Washington Times but folks don't don't don't start popping
[41:13.800 --> 41:19.480]  champagne corks yet because we've got to fund the gun industry I get zero money
[41:19.480 --> 41:26.560]  from the gun industry zero I frankly I've been thinking about getting into
[41:26.560 --> 41:30.960]  firearms accessories holsters and stuff it's stuff that I use stuff I like it
[41:30.960 --> 41:35.880]  can be profitable we're open capitalists to fund our operation and promote our
[41:35.880 --> 41:40.800]  ideas and try to take the society back peacefully but I am in consultation with
[41:40.800 --> 41:46.200]  several big gun manufacturers right now to not be cowards because I won't just
[41:46.200 --> 41:48.720]  promote any gun manufacturer I want to promote the highest quality I could go
[41:48.720 --> 41:51.800]  out and get some smaller ones or some fly-by-nighters I've been I've been
[41:51.800 --> 41:55.080]  approached hundreds of times by gun manufacturers to promote them but it's
[41:55.080 --> 41:58.440]  almost always a smaller outfit a lot of times they're pretty good quality but I
[41:58.440 --> 42:07.440]  want to sell and promote the best guns but I'm digressing you've got to fund
[42:07.440 --> 42:13.640]  the industry because it's being sued there are over 200 lawsuits right now
[42:13.640 --> 42:20.360]  being funded by Bloomberg and George Soros and the usual suspects and some of
[42:20.360 --> 42:24.200]  those lawsuits have cost major manufacturers like bus master I was
[42:24.200 --> 42:31.440]  reading already over 15 million dollars and could bankrupt them show talk about
[42:31.440 --> 42:35.360]  voting with your dollars guns are only going to go up in value guns I bought
[42:35.360 --> 42:39.760]  when Clinton was around a range rifle for 200 bucks goes for like 800 to a
[42:39.760 --> 42:48.160]  thousand now a Ruger 223 bought it for 250 bucks or something at Walmart of
[42:48.160 --> 42:53.280]  all places back when Walmart sold guns they had the best deal back then I
[42:53.280 --> 42:56.600]  hardly had any money it was 30 bucks cheaper than the local gun shop I went
[42:56.600 --> 43:03.920]  to Walmart that'll show you how the world's changed bought that gun when I
[43:03.920 --> 43:12.920]  was 20 years old still got it it's a fantastic varmint gun if you just want
[43:12.920 --> 43:17.400]  to ride around the back of a Jeep shooting coyotes at a hundred yards
[43:17.400 --> 43:23.320]  how dare you shoot the coyotes well they kill the baby deer trendies learn how that works
[43:23.320 --> 43:28.120]  you're like well they're the natural predators I get it the point is that
[43:28.120 --> 43:31.680]  it's a good firearm see how I can't just tell one story I go off and other things
[43:31.680 --> 43:40.720]  it's how my brain works but the gun manufacturers are in trouble a lot of
[43:40.720 --> 43:44.480]  them have been going out of business because of the lawsuits and the
[43:44.480 --> 43:49.120]  regulations and all the rest of it that have been heaped on top so we're in the
[43:49.120 --> 43:54.760]  battle but we're not winning the war and the minute we start thinking that we
[43:54.760 --> 43:58.600]  won the war for the Second Amendment we're going to lose it everyone else
[43:58.600 --> 44:05.600]  worldwide but Switzerland has lost it you look at that scoreboard folks we are
[44:05.600 --> 44:11.840]  surrounded by tyranny from without and from within and I cannot express to you
[44:11.840 --> 44:24.280]  how dire our traits are okay that said day after officers arrest for shooting
[44:24.280 --> 44:31.200]  the unarmed black man eight times in the back there have been protests George
[44:31.200 --> 44:35.960]  Soros funding them of course and my issue is what's the protest he's been
[44:35.960 --> 44:44.040]  indicted he's facing 30 years the life I mean it's terrible what the cop did and
[44:44.040 --> 44:50.920]  then framing the person he murdered and he's had the book thrown at him but this
[44:50.920 --> 44:53.960]  is being promoted in hype to get us everybody fighting with each other and
[44:53.960 --> 44:57.760]  to federalize police I mean that's just why the same media that's attacking the
[44:57.760 --> 45:01.760]  Second Amendment and attacking the family and attacking parental rights and
[45:01.760 --> 45:06.080]  pushing abortion and pushing open borders and pushing world government and
[45:06.080 --> 45:12.680]  pushing forced inoculations are the same ones perseverating on the police
[45:12.680 --> 45:16.080]  because they know the government has an 8% approval rating in Gallup
[45:16.080 --> 45:22.760]  Congress and so if they can just scapegoat the police and make every
[45:22.760 --> 45:27.560]  problem about them it diverts from us taking control of the government and
[45:27.560 --> 45:36.480]  stopping the unconstitutional directives and policies where it starts it'd be
[45:36.480 --> 45:41.600]  like if there was a big hole in a wall at a Dutch dyke would you try to get a
[45:41.600 --> 45:45.360]  ladle and scoop the water out as it poured down the road or would you try to
[45:45.360 --> 45:53.000]  plug the hole up and attacking the police is like attacking water five
[45:53.000 --> 45:59.800]  miles downstream you've got to attack it directly at the source
[46:08.320 --> 46:13.040]  guys I have an error in here saying info wars is down just tell me if that's a
[46:13.040 --> 46:20.440]  case now it's not down but you want to talk about something we should all be
[46:20.440 --> 46:23.520]  together on and having demonstrations about the George Soros won't be funding
[46:23.520 --> 46:30.000]  that CDC U.S. heroin deaths nearly triple in
[46:30.000 --> 46:36.840]  three years White House says Mexico is the primary supplier if you look at the
[46:36.840 --> 46:46.960]  graph put out by the U.S. DEA from heroin deaths from 2000 2013 you'll
[46:46.960 --> 46:52.680]  notice that there is a you scroll down you'll see the graph you'll notice that
[46:52.680 --> 47:01.200]  there is a more than 13 time basic increase and on this graph it shows
[47:01.200 --> 47:05.720]  about a tenfold increase but there's a 13 times increase in world opium supply
[47:05.720 --> 47:11.440]  with 93% of it being produced out of Afghanistan that was producing only 6%
[47:11.440 --> 47:17.720]  pre-invasion they ship the drugs in it doesn't come out of Mexico yes some
[47:17.720 --> 47:22.720]  black tar comes out of Mexico but a very small number we even have interpulse
[47:22.720 --> 47:27.600]  own numbers that we should do a story showing interpulse numbers and the UN
[47:27.600 --> 47:33.960]  zone numbers and the Pentagon zone numbers you pull up BBC you name it that
[47:33.960 --> 47:41.240]  that world opium supply 93% is out of Afghanistan and is up 13 folds in 2001
[47:41.240 --> 47:45.520]  and that's where 93% of it comes from globally and then they just blame
[47:45.520 --> 47:51.760]  Mexico to keep the phony drug war going when our government loads it on C-130s
[47:51.760 --> 47:55.760]  we should have the nightly news I'll air it tomorrow show the Fox News clip
[47:55.760 --> 48:01.760]  admitting we ship it in the BBC the ABC the NBC where they have to hide it in
[48:01.760 --> 48:05.000]  plain view because the troops were blowing the whistle we're gonna go to
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.640]  break and come back with your calls Pat Tillman was writing letters home about
[48:08.640 --> 48:12.360]  we grow the opium this is a total fraud there's no real al-Qaeda over here I do
[48:12.360 --> 48:18.160]  photo ops all day this is fake we're harming the radicals and the Pentagon
[48:18.160 --> 48:24.360]  said bust a cap in that man and they did so the troops were speaking out so they
[48:24.360 --> 48:28.120]  said how we saw off this about seven years ago so they began going on the
[48:28.120 --> 48:33.520]  news and going first time I heard it was BBC on my XM and I heard him do a 10
[48:33.520 --> 48:36.880]  minute report admitting our government grows the opium and even allows it to
[48:36.880 --> 48:41.080]  be shipped out and the argument was well if we don't al-Qaeda will we'll get the
[48:41.080 --> 48:46.320]  money that's what they tell the troops oh really that's why I went up 13-fold
[48:46.320 --> 48:51.360]  give me a break our government arms and funds al-Qaeda and then they get on the
[48:51.360 --> 48:54.560]  news and say the number and rate of deaths the United States from overdoses
[48:54.560 --> 49:01.120]  involving heroin nearly tripled in three years from 2010 to 2013 it's way
[49:01.120 --> 49:05.880]  higher than that on the 10-year graph all the heroin United States is smuggled
[49:05.880 --> 49:09.080]  from abroad and Mexico's the primary supplier of the drug to the country
[49:09.080 --> 49:13.000]  according to the White House Office of National Drug Council policy know the
[49:13.000 --> 49:18.160]  White House and the big banks Wells Fargo, Wacovia and others on record are
[49:18.160 --> 49:25.800]  the main importers of cocaine heroin you name it and then of course they're
[49:25.800 --> 49:29.040]  heavily invested in the new Freedom Initiative to forcibly psychologically
[49:29.040 --> 49:33.360]  assess all children and put them on prescription drugs just as bad or worse
[49:33.360 --> 49:42.200]  so just the last four years we've seen a tripling in the deaths but hey listen
[49:42.200 --> 49:47.920]  that's not the issue let's not in the drug war let's just hate the police and
[49:47.920 --> 49:51.840]  then have killed the police chance and then shoot more cops in the head so they
[49:51.840 --> 49:55.200]  get even more trigger happy and shoot more citizens and then a civil war
[49:55.200 --> 49:59.800]  starts that's a wonderful idea instead of just going hey I don't care what color
[49:59.800 --> 50:03.320]  you are they're shipping it into our communities there are a lot of little white
[50:03.320 --> 50:07.920]  yuppies on heroin in fact that's what's cool with the dumb white kids the dumb
[50:07.920 --> 50:13.320]  trendy black kids listen to their gangbanger music like cocaine and PCP

[56:03.320 --> 56:11.920]  briefly because I didn't really plug it last segment 20 years ago I quit
[56:11.920 --> 56:16.880]  working out just went from working out basically every day and loving it I
[56:16.880 --> 56:20.320]  didn't even do it to try to look good I did because I was addicted to the
[56:20.320 --> 56:24.080]  endorphins then I got addicted to doing radio and TV got totally focused on
[56:24.080 --> 56:29.080]  that worked 18 hours a day most days and gained 98 pounds and now I've lost
[56:29.080 --> 56:35.560]  basically 60 plus percent of that 65% of that in the last few years with high
[56:35.560 --> 56:41.320]  quality supplements from m4warslife.com and m4warsstore.com and because the

[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:15.560]  Chris in North Carolina thanks for calling hey buddy yeah you've got a
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:19.560]  phone problem there maybe our phone system again today we had one yesterday
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:25.000]  can you speak right in your telephone Chris let's put him on hold see if
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.480]  that's our phone system let's go ahead and talk maybe we should just suspend
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.400]  calls from now on or take them on our end rod in California let's see if that
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:38.800]  was Chris's phone or our system go ahead rod yeah it's the GCN system all
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.840]  right what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go to our backup system and it's funny in
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.880]  this new studio I haven't moved our phone numbers in here I don't use our
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.120]  backup enough to remember it so do me a favor run that in there and hang that up
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.800]  and let's fire up the phone system in that studio and it'll be more than one
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:58.280]  way to skin a cat it's not John Harmon's fault up at the network he does a great
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:03.160]  job you know John Harmon is vestigial but a very important vestigial part of
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:08.440]  the operation going back I think 14 15 years John Harmon's worked here and he's
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:12.000]  actually now a manager and an executive up at the GCN radio network that does a
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:21.800]  great job but by vestigial I did this radio show out of my house for many
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:27.400]  years like a remote and so that I would say go to the calls and Harmon would sit
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.480]  there on a chat screen and tell me who the callers were then he would air the
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.120]  calls we can do the calls here it's just that I like Harmon being there and he
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.760]  he does it and it's a little bit different most talk show hosts have the
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.600]  control box right in front of them and actually do that and and I have the
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.480]  capability to do that myself but I do things a little bit different in fact you
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.880]  can say I do things a little bit of a cockamamie way because I got used to
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:54.520]  doing the show like a remote for so many years I did it out of my house from
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:03:04.000]  99 to about 2004 2003 before that I was in different radio stations and so that's
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.040]  where that stands we'll get that GCN radio network system up and they'll
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:14.760]  probably have to reboot it we start testing it for the show we can just do
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.960]  it right here on air the way we do things but we will take your phone
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:24.480]  calls today and as I said we will fire up the phone system in here and we will
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:30.000]  let Rod and Chris and Tom and Ryan and Tim and everybody else have their first
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.800]  shot in on the phone system so please don't call until they've been able to
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:40.440]  get in on the line them a little bit the phones up that way here today but like I
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:45.000]  said we have got a lot of news to cover as well we're going to look at the
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.360]  different criminal operations of the IRS with a former top insider a criminal
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:54.840]  investigator with the Treasury Department the guy that you know had the IRS
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:59.040]  SWAT teams and of course sometimes they were SWAT team and the mafia and the rest
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:02.560]  of it but the media always phrases it like if they're rating you you must be
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:07.680]  a criminal well now it's more and more mainstream news and cannot be hidden
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:13.840]  what's really going on and what's really going on is the IRS is just an
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.960]  arbitrary criminal organization who doesn't even collect money to even pay
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.840]  off the debt now it's simply to control the economy selectively to have a rain
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:28.640]  of terror over people from Switzerland to Australia people are now having to pay
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:32.440]  to put money in the bank because the globalist prints so much currency that
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:37.880]  it loses value but at the same time it's hard to get a loan and the IRS will
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.400]  come after you over a few dollars and it's again it's not about funding the
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.920]  government they have unlimited fake Treasury bills and all the rest of it
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.400]  it's about squeezing the little guy out and destroying an independent free open

[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:04.960]  waits for care they were ordered to put people on no treat list as part of
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:10.320]  eugenics and bioethics the decision is made not to give them the care to set
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.720]  that precedent the VA are the ones running it of course they haven't fixed
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:21.440]  it because it isn't broken we can talk about that CDC US heroin death nearly
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:27.640]  triple in three years they blame Mexico when you can go to Interpol or NATO and
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:34.880]  they admit 93% of it's coming out of Afghanistan worldwide just a lie from the
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:41.800]  White House preying on a stupid public unbelievable Jamie Dimon warns next
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:46.440]  crisis could see more volatile markets oh that's the head of JP Morgan Chase at
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.680]  the top of the New World Order with Goldman Sachs I mean you don't get higher
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:55.000]  up on the pyramid of these parasites this is like a fox telling the farmer you
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.600]  know there may be a weasel or a fox or something that's going to go in your
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:04.000]  henhouse and eat your hands I mean yeah this is like Hitler saying you know we
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.240]  might actually invade some countries or kill some people I mean it's just
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:14.920]  unbelievable Saudi Arabia to borrow to finance soaring deficit they're one of
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.720]  the biggest oil producers in the world second biggest they have sweet crew that
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:26.280]  they get out of the ground for like $5 a barrel and then are able to refine it
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:31.480]  for something like $12 a barrel it costs Venezuela $102 a barrel the US
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:37.320]  something like $75 a barrel last time I checked and they can't even run in the
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:45.000]  black oops I was just racist let me stop right there and then I'm gonna play a
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.160]  special report go to your phone calls I have an article here in my stack that
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.080]  when I read it this morning I had to read it three times to even make sense of
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:58.680]  it you know the little motocons or whatever you call them they're called
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:03.720]  something else when it's an Apple based system emoji emojis the little smiley
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:07.920]  faces the little if I want to meet friends after work for a beer every
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:11.840]  once in a while I'll send them a you know emoji or a motocon whatever they're
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:16.680]  called of a beer I want to go fishing I'll send my buddy a shot of a kayak and
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:22.480]  a fishing pole like I ever have done that like three years I need to go out
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:27.080]  and have some fun then I'll be harassed by the lake police though if I try to sit
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:31.120]  the country's gone I'm sorry excuse me but the border's wide open right
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:38.760]  Clorox apologizes to leech tweet after racial uproar this is how politically
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:44.400]  correct and mentally ill the general public is Clorox complained that out of
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:51.480]  hundreds of these symbols on the new iOS 8.3 for iPhones and Apple systems in
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:56.800]  the chat and text systems that Clorox wasn't an icon of hundreds of other
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:05.640]  products that are listed because now they're listing products and because it
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:13.120]  was white they're claiming it's some type of racial code and guess what they
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:17.200]  did the right political correct thing they apologized brown bags in Seattle or
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.560]  racist no one ever said they were connected to racism no whatever said
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:25.840]  they were a symbol of bringing your own lunch because a brown bag is strong paper
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:32.760]  that's flexible lightweight and inexpensive it's untreated paper which
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.760]  makes it weak and makes it more expensive unbleached so bleached papers
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:45.280]  racist unbleached paper is racist saying I want Chinese food is racist saying I
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:50.080]  went to the Chinese New Year fireworks display in New York is racist gotta say
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:55.040]  Lunar New Year in Europe they've changed the names of more than 20 species with
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:06.480]  black in the name for birds black owl black warbler black lark black
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:10.440]  Starling you know why they're called black because they're black you know when
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:15.920]  you say a red bird a cardinal it's not because you're racist against the color
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:22.040]  red the birds red folks the male of the species is red that's when I go down to
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:27.880]  the Gulf with my son and catch red fish just a red drum baby we're calling it
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:33.200]  red because it's red and we catch a black drum we're calling it a black
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:39.560]  drum because it's black this is how mentally you'll see we all know how to
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:47.600]  obsess over paper bags and Clorox but not 51 to 52% of black people never
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:57.040]  been born or Planned Parenthood giving awards to Hitler and getting awards my
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:02.880]  head is literally spitting at this point and I read this article and I kept
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.920]  looking where's the tweet where's the bad it was just like hey Clorox ought to
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:19.200]  get added tell all these products we want to be an icon Taco Bell launched a
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.680]  similar but less controversial campaign earlier this year and attempt to rally
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:33.520]  support for taco symbols in the Apple emo G lexicon and then it goes it so you
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:41.520]  have campaigns to get your your symbol listed like I guess the Groucho Marx nose
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:47.240]  and glasses means I'm going in disguise come to the Groucho Marx glasses nose
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:57.000]  party McDonald's has an emoji McDonald's has an emoji the skull is it a skull
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:06.320]  I'm being facetious well don't be racist against skulls in fact we're talking
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.440]  about radiation yesterday in the studio during a break and I said you know don't
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.360]  talk bad about the Fukushima radiation you're discriminating against radiation
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:23.160]  you're a racist the finalists include racially diverse emoji faces zipper
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:29.760]  mouth face prayer beads a cricket bat and a taco well everybody knows the
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:34.160]  tacos racist all over the country universities you don't believe me just
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:40.040]  look it up have banned fraternities having fiesta parties because someone
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:43.720]  might get offended that people are drinking tequila drinking beer wearing
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:50.480]  sombreros and having a taco bar and again when I had tacos that I made for
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:56.480]  my children last week and then I made chicken fajitas it wasn't because I
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:02.120]  wanted tacos and chicken fajitas and guacamole a bit hungry it was racist so
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:07.680]  see symbols are now inherently racist and evil and must be banned but if you're
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:12.560]  the UN killing whole African tribes to force you off your land for a UN treaty
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:17.720]  it's in the New York Times and a ok see that's how sick these people are and how
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:22.040]  you don't learn in college or school how to get a job or how to be productive or
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:25.640]  how to be socially responsible for real issues you learn how to obsess on
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.280]  everything and be offended and stay in your little group this is mass mental
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:33.360]  illness all right we got our phone system up we got your calls on the board
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.600]  and I just want to make sure guys that we go to the folks that were originally
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.720]  holding before I go to the others we transferred over from the Genesis phone
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:44.960]  system rod in California thanks for calling in and being with us go ahead
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:49.960]  hey thanks for having Alex can you hear me okay yes I can brother excellent so
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:54.400]  yesterday you were talking about how sick hard and I had a thought we're in a
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.800]  galatarian species were mesmerized by the myth of authority and as a
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:01.960]  galatarian we don't really recognize authority but only really persuasion what
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:05.160]  really stuck with me yesterday as he said that there's a metaphysical rule that
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:08.480]  says they have to tell us what they're doing I think that's because we're a
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.840]  galatarian and we have to give our permission so like the lone gunman
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:16.760]  episode 1 that was I'm getting America's passive permission for 9-11 so my
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:21.440]  question for you is for 3000 years or so God has had the opportunity to persuade
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.680]  mankind towards kindness and love now we have guys like Frank Underwood and
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:30.280]  Raymond Reddington who are these excuse me affable lovable sociopaths who
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:35.200]  commit purely evil acts but it's for love so it's okay so when I'm closing
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:40.160]  yes they're inverting reality they're teaching us evil for good is good the
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:45.720]  ring of Mordor is good but it isn't it is forged in evil and will always do
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:50.800]  greater acts of evil that will hurt innocence well what my question is do
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.920]  you think that these characters are the literary embodiment of the devil
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.920]  getting his day and the court of public opinion absolutely that's how it works
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:03.040]  that's why the truth is out in the open and so people are being given their
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:06.800]  metaphysical choice you're absolutely right and I also wanted to say
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:10.120]  congratulations on all your hard work working out man I've been doing a lot
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:13.600]  of working out thinking that you can dream and that's hard work so you're
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:17.920]  doing good man keep that well God bless you brother I still eat too much and you
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.680]  know work late hours and do a lot of things that are bad for my body I mean
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:25.400]  the super motion we're doing is just the truth it isn't that I look like you
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:29.640]  know some beach model Beach Boy or something it's just that I gained 99
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:38.040]  pounds and I've lost 65 pounds or so and I got another 20 or 30 to go and
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:43.400]  those are the hardest to go and I just show people how I was in great shape how
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:47.240]  I got in the job of the hut shape and now how I'm kind of like Jabba on a diet
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:52.840]  and it's these products because I've been doing the same amount of working out in
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:58.080]  fact three years ago I really went hard was swimming two miles almost every
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:02.200]  morning I used to come in here at about 10 a.m. dripping wet and then take a
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:06.360]  shower and then get dressed for the show as everybody used to see me come in
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:12.080]  rolling right at 10 in swim trunks even in the winter and all that happened was
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:17.200]  my muscles got bigger and the fat stayed on me then I tried jogging but I'm too
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:20.720]  old and too fat it was hurting my knees and weightlifting and now I just do
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:28.880]  weightlifting with high repetitions in a basic circuit and do elliptical about
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:33.480]  five six days a week for about 45 minutes and I'm doing less exercise and
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:37.800]  I've lost more weight and it's all from the info wars life.com products period
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:44.400]  that's what harmonially clearly changed me the things I needed and you've heard

[01:23:53.160 --> 01:24:10.480]  or visit oneworldway.com I was a highway man along the coach roads I did ride
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:23.740]  with sword and pistol by my side many a young man lost her bobbles to my trade many a soldier shed his
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:28.960]  black blood on my blade all right let's go back to your phone calls here on the
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.920]  Alex Jones broadcast I'm gonna go through 10 or so and then I'm gonna play the
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.680]  special report from John Bowne that's really powerful then we're gonna continue
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:40.920]  with your phone calls who's been holding the longest here I guess that'd be
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:46.240]  Thomas in West Texas thanks for holding it on the air hey Alex thanks for taking
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:49.560]  the call thanks for calling brother what's on your mind of this of this
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:54.240]  plethora of stories well one I want to thank you for helping break the chains
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:58.680]  that were around my mind and and then when you're awake it you talk to the
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:02.960]  federal federalist citizenry and it's just ridiculous there it's insane what's
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:07.800]  like watching the Looney Tunes show or something it's getting more and more
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:13.480]  insane it's getting crazier it is but I think it's also helping to speed up
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:18.320]  everyone to wake up to see what's really going on but the reason for my call is
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:22.680]  I listen I drive I'm in my truck all day and I listen to a lot of talk radio and
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:28.040]  there's a show that comes on before yours and his name's a Gwen Fully and
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:32.080]  yesterday he had a guy on me he put up as his friend and all this stuff and he
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:36.440]  says you know I kind of like Rand Paul but what worries me is like father like
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:40.960]  son and and Ron Paul he's just a fascist and so that's what worries me about
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:45.720]  Rand well I don't know who this local talk show is and of course we don't
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:49.360]  really screen the calls we should ask what affiliate people are listening to
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:53.320]  you say it's on the same station as I am what station are you listening to us on
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:57.080]  right now it's supposed to be conservative radio his name is Lynn
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:02.240]  woolly no but I mean what what station are you listening to me on oh I use your
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:07.640]  internet radio okay so you're listening to another local show well look most
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:11.680]  talk show hosts just try to do what's safe and try to play along with the
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:16.440]  narrative and that's an old narrative from CNN and Fox from when Ron Paul first
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:22.400]  ran from president back when Obama went for his first term as well when they
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:28.040]  would say Ron Paul's people are planning what they call a money bomb to blow up
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:32.600]  the capital knowing their audiences were ignorant didn't know what a money bomb was
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:38.880]  a fundraiser and Ron Paul's a racist and just all this other made-up garbage to
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:42.120]  then get the so-called right-wing attacking the proto tea party that Ron
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:48.160]  Paul started when they couldn't destroy it they just tried to then co-opt it but
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:53.560]  the only problem with Rand Paul is he isn't enough like his dad but he is more
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:58.440]  presidential in that he's moderated at least from the establishment's
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:02.880]  perspective but they're still going to go after him but to call Ron Paul a
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:09.440]  fascist when he is a classical liberal he's the diametrical opposite by every
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:15.240]  historical yardstick of the two major parties and so that's what I would
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:23.400]  expect from mainline neocon radio is that that's what they do they I mean
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:27.480]  Fox News is attacking Rand Paul right now they've been real nice to him until
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:32.600]  now because they know their constituent viewers like Rand Paul but now the
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.800]  knife's coming out because they're too close to the election and they can't
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:40.120]  have him in there so that's what they're doing there should be a major backlash
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:44.320]  against Fox News and others if we're trying to misrepresent what Rand Paul
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:48.960]  really stands for anything else sir and I challenge yes sir I called in and I
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:53.920]  challenged both of them to listen to Rand Paul's farewell speech to Congress
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:58.120]  and tell me what in that speech was fascist and he just redirected and
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:03.680]  starts talking about that he that Rand Paul and his pro-choice and that he's
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:07.440]  in for abortion and he likes abortion yes see again they have the left and right
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:13.240]  attacking him he's not pro-abortion he's like his dad it's a state issue it should
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:16.960]  be done by the states as all major medical laws should we shouldn't have a
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:21.000]  federal system over health care we shouldn't have Obamacare and he is
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.840]  fundamentally against partial birth abortion and fundamentally against state
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.920]  funding of abortion and if you get down to his core values and they know it he
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:36.720]  really is for the abolition of abortion but he is playing politics on this
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:41.560]  issue because I think he's got advisors that think that by going along some of
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:45.480]  the system he's going to win no they're going to misrepresent everything he does
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:50.440]  so he might as well double down and go yes I'm a flaming Americana
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:56.640]  constitutionalist libertarian and people will love him including the real left
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:01.640]  out there that are sick of the Democratic Party people want someone real they
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:05.920]  don't want to totally even agree with someone they want someone that will do
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:11.720]  what they say they were going to do I appreciate your call and look Rand Paul
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:19.240]  is not perfect but I know I can trust him he's a good guy and he does what he
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:24.640]  says you'll do and the system knows that so they hate his guts this is not
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.880]  rocket science people when the Republicans meet in secret and the
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:32.280]  Democrats meet in secret it's leaked more than 20 times last few years they're
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:36.160]  talking about the Tea Party and Rand Paul and how to destroy us I mean the
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:39.800]  White House runs media matters they attack me every day folks that's the
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:45.120]  White House why because I got their criminal number and if people start
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:50.840]  listing it's over for them they know we're coming on the March the empires on

[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:05.480]  in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king there's another
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:13.840]  parable I forget who said it or what culture it came from is that the wise
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:18.680]  king woke up one day and a wicked witch had poisoned the well and turned
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:24.200]  everybody in the kingdom they're on the palace evil so the wise king went and
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:30.160]  drank from the well and became evil and joined them and used to out here that
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:33.120]  parable and think that's really evil I don't agree with that but I kind of get
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:40.680]  it God wants you hot or cold not lukewarm and America has become as lukewarm as
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:47.840]  monkey vomit people think they're safe not having an opinion or just sitting
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:51.160]  there like a deer in the headlights and that's what's gotten us the point we're
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:56.160]  at now and I as I've said a thousand times I'm here to get people out of
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:00.240]  their trance it doesn't mean you've got to see the world way I see it it doesn't
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:04.800]  mean you've got to agree with everything I say it doesn't mean I have all the
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:10.000]  answers it doesn't mean that I don't make mistakes it means look around you
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.920]  things are not like they're telling us or a lot of times they're going there's
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:19.520]  no global government there's no corporate fascism and then they'll have
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.720]  another report by the same reporter going global government's the answer it's
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:28.520]  like when the foreign editor I think it was like six years ago yeah cuz it's in
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:32.840]  the Obama deception the article the foreign editor of the Financial Times of
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:36.880]  London one of the most prestigious newspapers in the world where they have
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:40.040]  a lot of between the lines reporting telling you what's going on he had an
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:43.320]  article called and now for world government and he said yeah the
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:47.760]  Bilderberg group did covertly found the EU and we are totalitarian we are
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:53.720]  autocratic we are technocratic use those words and we're taken over and we
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:57.800]  know best and the fact that we're in control shows that we should be in
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:01.520]  control I've had billionaires try to get me to join the globalist and give me
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:06.800]  that exact speech it's an elitism club most people go wow I'm part of the
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:11.320]  elitism club I get a 20 room mansion and a private jet and three mistresses and
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:17.520]  three Ferraris I'll sell out anybody you want you mean I get to hang around with
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:23.000]  you guys but see most people sell out for almost nothing and then when the
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:28.200]  whole culture sells out it's like the porn industry porn actresses really
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:33.080]  were stars in the sense of making millions of dollars 30 years ago 40
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:39.120]  years ago now prostitutes in major cities make more than women that are
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:46.800]  stars and porn Wall Street Journal look it up because women went in the in huge
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:57.480]  gluts and got into porn until it was worse less less than dirt and you
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:02.240]  devalued yourself so all you sell outs out there think you're selling out to
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:06.760]  the New World Order and you're getting so much power out of it you're not you're
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:14.440]  getting enslavement so the whole age of selling out and getting something for it
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:18.960]  is coming to an end and the elites have created such a destabilized world
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:24.160]  they're having to build armored keeps armored fortresses armored redoubts
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:34.640]  armored getaways armored safe houses from northern Canada to the Ozarks in
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:45.440]  Missouri to New Zealand with secret airfields they have helicopter pads and
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:54.160]  they have airfields this is in the news that are camouflaged and they admit
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:59.160]  they're digging in for total collapse wow great job you took over and now
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:06.480]  you're not safe wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful world you're building
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:12.600]  and the public has greased the skids for these kleptocrats to take over because
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:16.440]  there isn't really a master plan sure there's a global master plan to have a
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:19.320]  global one-world currency for these central banks but they're already in
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.600]  control but there isn't a master plan when it comes down to the rubber meeting
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:29.880]  the road for this actually to work and no amount of computerized brainwashing
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:35.680]  and cultural rot and surveillance is going to glue this thing together it
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:40.760]  isn't going to work it's going to fall on its face just like every other
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:45.440]  dictatorial group in history that thinks they're invincible ends up bringing
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:50.240]  everything down you people are a bunch of degenerate criminal psychopaths and
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:55.960]  sociopaths that couldn't run a hot dog stand all you can do is festoon
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:39:03.200]  yourselves in fancy outfits and put out PR garbage like it's totally legal and
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:08.680]  well thought out and reasoned and common sense what we're doing with the
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:13.720]  borders how dare a judge say we can
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.640]  meanwhile norad aerospace command is moving back into the underground
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:24.040]  bunkers again all right I said I go to your calls and I'm ranting I am out of
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:32.840]  control today we're in danger is what I'm trying to explain everybody and we
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:38.520]  haven't gone through cultural crises like our ancestors did so we think we're
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:46.040]  invincible we don't have any cellular memory in this generation in the last
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:58.360]  few in the average person of real crisis and so we think we're safe and we're not
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:11.480]  who's up next here I'm gonna go to Tim in Canada Tim you're on the air from
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:16.200]  Canada thanks for calling thank you for taking my call Alex and first of all
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:19.880]  thank you for all the things that you do for us because we're all suffering here
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:24.520]  you know well I know this we're certainly being screwed over and I know
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:28.040]  the unborn children are suffering I know the American or Canadian workers
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:31.440]  suffering I know it's getting worse by design as they build a world in their
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:38.080]  words not for humans I mean how creepy is that go ahead sorry well that's okay
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.160]  Alex I'm just completely tired of the scam and how it's just making all the
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:45.280]  people get laid off now and for math because they're all suffering because
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:49.360]  of the oil all the oil scams and anyway Alex I just want to make three points
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:54.080]  the Canadian economy and then how are we are doing and in my
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:57.840]  sheet and how we are getting nailed by the video games energy drinks and how
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:01.800]  it's affecting us the loss of passion not feeling so amplified with our emotions
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:06.920]  and obsessive compulsive disorder that can come out of that and how people just
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:10.440]  all of a sudden from stress boom next day OCD and that's what happened to me
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:16.640]  and this doctor she really helped me with that and it's I'm just I'm just
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:20.480]  thinking we're getting biologically we're getting nailed Alex absolutely all
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:24.560]  the statistics show it that that we're being killed in this modern society that
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:28.280]  we're becoming diseased mentally ill we're being screwed over it's unnatural
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:34.000]  it's being done by design Tim thank you look here's a microcosm war every
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.600]  psychological study for hundreds of years shows if you believe a war is
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:43.920]  righteous and good then you don't commit suicide you're proud of what you've done
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:48.160]  you don't have a lot of problems from even serious combat but if you don't
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:53.440]  think a war was justified you will have all sorts of problems and disintegrate
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:57.640]  well the general public doesn't have any morals or has been taught not to have
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:02.720]  them and so we're a regular society so things are degenerating and that's done
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:06.760]  as a psychological warfare virus there's like a virus in a computer to
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:12.720]  destabilize us let's talk to Ryan in Pennsylvania Ryan you're on the air go
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:19.040]  ahead how you doing Alex good brother go ahead I just wanted to send a message
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:22.920]  out I see it all the time these people on Twitter that that troll you in your
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:27.240]  website of course it's always some ad hominem strongman attack with no
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:32.640]  evidence look people say all the time that you're the only guy doing this
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:37.120]  but you're not I mean there are people out there like Richard Groves, Stefan
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:42.400]  Mullen and Mark Pastia, John Taylor Gata, Anthony Sutton, hundreds of people out
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:45.880]  there that are doing what you're doing Alex isn't the only guy out there
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:51.640]  alright this is a big movement so you people need to wake up and actually
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:56.720]  start reading stuff instead of trying to just destroy a guy who's fighting for
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:00.800]  freedom and liberty well it's beyond that it's a megaphone effect an
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:03.720]  amplifying effect to Cass Sunstein wrote about eight years ago and then again
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:07.280]  seven years ago the White House regulations are they have admitted
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:13.400]  bots but also real people that go out and get a discussion going making up
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:18.880]  these memes to get us all in fighting with each other and so it's simple
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:23.680]  disinformation more and more people though see the level of attack we're
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:27.120]  under and realize that that's because we're doing a good job but you're
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:31.480]  absolutely right there have been hundreds of super prominent people fighting
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:36.480]  this tens of thousands of prominent and millions of somewhat active folks
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:41.840]  fighting it they had Barney Miller shows in 1981 making fun of people that
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:48.160]  believed in a trilateral Commission takeover plan I mean I'm nobody I didn't
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:52.880]  come up with any of this I'm going off what the globalists have openly said
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:57.560]  they're doing and so you're absolutely right but listen brother most of the
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:02.480]  people you see attacking us are either government or corporate operatives or
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:09.480]  are a computer bot this is all admitted or are desperate and feel powerless they
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:12.560]  don't feel like they can fight the tyranny of the globalist so to say
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:18.080]  they're morally better than me is like giving themselves a general uniform or
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:21.680]  something it's it's it's like claiming they beat up Mike Tyson in his prime
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:27.320]  even though they did it's like claiming they are holier than now oh Alex is CIA
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:31.160]  or Alex works for Israel or Alex works for the Vatican or Alex works for the
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:35.760]  space aliens or Alex works for the whatever that's really a way to feel
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:42.200]  good about yourself most the people that attack me who are not government
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:48.400]  operatives do it because they already are awake and so they just go one level
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:53.040]  further saying there's no way we can win everything's controlled and Alex Jones
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:59.600]  is controlled well that's where the big breakdown happens and God bless you Ryan
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:03.880]  I appreciate your call them bring on that point up they don't believe in human
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:08.080]  power they may know about the globalist conspiracy they meant to know about the
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:13.080]  eugenicist plan they know about the federal reserve being private but they
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:19.960]  don't like their neighbors they're parasitic and they don't like believing
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:22.600]  in other people and they don't like believing that we could get out of this
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:28.520]  I'm a fan of humanity I believe in humanity I know we can go to the stars I
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:34.600]  admire humans and that's why when I see a white human a black human skin color
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:41.200]  whatever angered each other just overrace that's an artificial uniform
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:45.360]  projection that's been put out there to distract us from all the real issues of
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:50.280]  how we're all being screwed over and it's because we have a message of unity of
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:57.200]  liberty of freedom of common sense and of pulling down lies people that have
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:02.840]  bought into the lies don't like hearing that's another group don't like hearing
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:06.880]  that they're wrong and don't like hearing that there's a problem and so
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:11.680]  they're gonna say no there isn't a problem and that guy's a liar but those
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:19.920]  people never counted anyways I mean someone that's gonna complain about
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:24.160]  folks trying to fix things somebody who's gonna complain about someone who has
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:27.560]  a track record of getting things done and taking action against tyranny and
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:33.320]  defending the individual every time and standing up for the underdog people that
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:39.560]  are gonna attack someone rallying humanity we're never gonna help us to
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:46.320]  begin with haters are gonna hate everybody I only hate those that are
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:50.360]  repressing the innocent and running scams and creating monopolies and
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:55.520]  suppressing human development and renaissance I like seeing people that
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:59.520]  are wealthy from their own work I like seeing people that are successful from
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:03.680]  their own sweat I like seeing people that want to take action what you've got
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:08.880]  is a lazy malaise in this world with people living off the work of our
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:14.360]  ancestors who then want to sit around and claim that they are the highest
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:20.960]  greatest example of the Liberty Movement by running other people down thank
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:27.880]  God I'm not one of those twisted individuals and I'll tell you the older
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:35.760]  I get the more I can't run people down and don't like doing it and I think
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:41.040]  it's an immaturity thing to to just randomly run people down I mean I
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:45.280]  wouldn't say something about somebody unless I know it I mean John Boehner has
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:49.800]  been involved going back into the 90s in what I believe is criminal lobbying
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:54.200]  operations and selling out the Liberty Movement over and over again and will not
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:57.760]  get rid of Obamacare and will not defend our borders and will not go after
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:01.880]  Lois Lerner and he is aiding and abetting treason and I say it I stand
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:11.040]  by it because he's convicted himself but unless something's open and shut I
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:16.560]  don't sit there and say it but let me tell you world government's open and
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:21.480]  shut global tyranny is open and shut it's going on fluoride in the water to
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:25.560]  brain damage us and lower our fertility it's a fact and I get angry that we got
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:30.920]  stinking criminal parasitic government up there making us pay to put stuff in
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:38.400]  the water that makes our teeth fall apart and gives us bone cancer makes your
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:47.520]  teeth fracture lowers your IQ gives you diabetes look up the studies I'm not a
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:53.840]  violent person but I'll tell you what if people went after the companies that
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:57.200]  sell the fluoride and lobby to put it in the water and did stuff to them I'd say
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:01.080]  I think violence is the wrong approach but you know what you get what you show
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:11.320]  what comes around goes around things like that but just a randomly because a
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:17.320]  white cop shoots a black person go out and kill some random whites or vice versa
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:23.200]  no that's not justice that's not justice at all I don't want any harm to
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:26.120]  happen to David Rockefeller's I don't turn him into a martyr or Brazilian
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:31.120]  Brzezinski or Henry Kissinger or Obama or any of these people but you know what
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:38.080]  they are criminals they deserve to be in prison but you know what vengeance
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:45.400]  belongs to God but you know God uses people and countries and individuals as
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:53.000]  vengeance so many times the tools of God's vengeance are us so we will just
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  pray that we see the truth and God give us discernment no matter what that truth
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.640]  is and if we simply pray that God set us on the path to fight tyranny God is a
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:08.400]  free will entity that created this entire dimension and everything around it
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:15.280]  and whether God exists or not metaphysically you have to with your free
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:20.000]  will say that you want something before the opportunity even arrives and if you
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:28.480]  ask God for discernment if you ask God for aid in a good goal in a real quest
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:34.400]  then God will send the aid but if you've sat there and push fluoride on people
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:40.340]  for 30 years as a mayor and then your granddaughter gets bone cancer and you
[01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:43.520]  prayed a God to heal her you know what I don't think God's gonna heal your
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:50.280]  granddaughter I think your granddaughter is gonna die but in my spirit I know if
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:53.520]  you've been fighting against the tyranny for 20 years I think your
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:57.160]  granddaughter might get better that's how God really works we'll be back stay

[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:51.960]  that would probably be either Ted Cruz or Rand Paul and I think that we all have
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:57.160]  a duty to take some action and ties towards his campaign and I think that
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:02.040]  we can all commit you know regardless of who we think is the right one to do the
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:06.320]  job to you know putting out three hundred dollars five hundred dollars a
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:12.120]  thousand dollars Murphy have a business maybe a couple thousand but Hillary said
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:15.880]  that she made him an error last time around because she put a bunch of her
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:20.120]  money in towards the general election instead of the primary and the primary is
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:23.840]  where these guys really need a lot of support and I think that it just be so
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:28.560]  amazing if we could all commit to making some good headway well that's right and
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:35.560]  Reuters is reporting that Rand Paul is leading and is up in different key
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:40.520]  states Rand Paul up Clinton down in 2016 presidential poll and that's why
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:46.200]  they're all attacking him and then I hear this libertarian purist movement out
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:51.880]  there saying you know what I don't think he's perfect and so I'm not gonna
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:55.680]  support him or oh he's for abortion I'm not gonna support him it's not even
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:56:01.040]  true they're hitting him from every angle with disinformation so people don't
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:06.120]  supporting and we should support anybody being attacked by the system like this
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:12.440]  radio show this TV show folks need to support and buy the products and spread
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:17.680]  the word and not even so much defend us online we're being attacked but point out
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:22.080]  hey folks these are most likely bots here's a link to mainstream news admitting
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:25.440]  they have government bots and corporate bots against the Liberty movement and
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:29.960]  here's Alex Jones covering real news they don't want us to discuss this and
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:35.960]  then take over the conversation they want to divert it into racism in fact we've
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:41.880]  tracked it with the IPs you'll have the same bot responding and writing so fast
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:46.800]  it can't be a human posting on five or six articles simultaneously and info
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:51.360]  wars calm saying inward inward inward inward and word and then countering
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:56.480]  going you racist white you racist white and it's the same bot just spreading
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:00.800]  racial fighting in fact we need to do reports on that we need to actually show
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:05.120]  that we need to really let people understand that when they're being hit
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:09.080]  with this info like that that that's exactly what's happening and just point
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:13.200]  out that it's a load of bull and then we use their tactics but not with deception
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:17.720]  we go in and say they're changing the subject they're probably a bot here's
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:24.600]  a link to that and here's a link to why they hate Alex Jones exposing cancer

[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:46.840]  we're talking to Tobin in Maryland and when you talk about what's happened to
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:50.960]  people economically the hard-working business owners of this country I don't
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:55.160]  care what color you are while they're busy raping our financial future they're
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:59.600]  trying to get us to racially fight with each other black unemployment doubled

[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:52.600]  and they showed Mike the report Mike goes I'm white and the tenant was white and
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:57.840]  the person said we don't care Hansen we're still investigating at all and like
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:01.240]  a year later they were still messing with him and he had to get lawyers and he
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:05.080]  went it doesn't matter in the report if we're both white and they claim I'm a
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:09.160]  racist black person I mean it's just people believe me I've dealt with it
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:13.880]  people just make stuff up now anyways I'm ranting Tobin finish up with what
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:17.280]  happened to you this year so you get screwed over by renters and then you were

[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:27.280]  had the same job for over 22 years they made us take a prevention in violence
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:32.880]  in the workplace the online thing that looked like it was designed for somebody
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:38.000]  with a third grade education I have a PhD and I looked over to one of my
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:43.400]  co-workers one of the things on it was they were discussing where they came up
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:47.120]  with the term going postal unfortunately a guy went a little bit
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:53.200]  shall we say nuts and shot up about six people in a in a postal place but he
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:58.000]  used about 50 or 60 rounds I turned over and looked at my fellow employee made a
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.320]  joke you know I just call that bad marksmanship you know if I if I went in
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:12.000]  there and went postal myself at least I'd get 60 or more than 60% of shot
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:19.120]  right yeah hit rate by the end of the day I was escorted out out of the
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:24.760]  building and fired because I made oh yeah I mean look look clearly that's why
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:28.720]  you like have the TSA and they've been caught in this and had to back off
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:33.640]  people say I don't have a bomb in there and they'll go bomb bomb he threatened
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:37.840]  bomb he threatened a bomb and then they'll misapply a terroristic threat
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:41.800]  bomb threat law on you to put you in prison when you clearly weren't making a
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:48.120]  bomb threat here's an example of that mental health evaluation ordered for
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:52.760]  suspect and Sandy Hook harassing calls case he was thinking about put this kid
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:56.880]  in the school so he called him in the morning and kept saying you know call

[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:04.040]  which again you could say might have concerned them but it wasn't a threat
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:09.840]  he's in a mental institution and it's on the news now that that's criminal so

[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:54.160]  thank you for warning me and i guess folks nowadays would thank you i guess
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:57.920]  that is unusual i see these articles every couple days all over the western
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:01.680]  world where some woman will be raped in full
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:06.000]  public even in a nice neighborhood nobody helps her because they don't even
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:09.840]  call the cops they don't even want to go out and help her
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:13.840]  and then she'll sit there and bleed to death between two parked cars and
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:18.800]  that's one famous case up in toronto but i mean i see a couple men rape a woman
[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:22.080]  in a parking lot i mean i'm going to grab my gun and come out there and you're
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:26.400]  going to be lucky if you're alive and that's not because i'm a hero
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:30.560]  that's what i mean what's wrong with people
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:35.600]  i i see these knockout game videos all the time
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:38.880]  that the black kukluks clan websites promote that's what it is
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:41.920]  but it's seen as okay this is politically correct all it's just black kids
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:45.680]  knocking out all white people but i'll see them like punch you know
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:49.200]  young white guys that are bigger than them and they'll just kind of get in a
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:54.640]  fetal position and vice versa but i mean
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:59.600]  where i grew up in dallas i never saw anybody get in a fetal position
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:03.040]  i mean you could see thugs beating up a little guy a little guy fight back i
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:07.680]  just i just what happened to the human spirit
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:12.960]  i mean i'm not a tough guy that if somebody assaults me
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:16.720]  i'm gonna attack them with everything i got that's just normal and if somebody
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:21.280]  starts hurting me i'm gonna black out and beat their brains out and that's
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:24.800]  not anything unusual that's what everybody was like before us
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:29.120]  or you didn't survive i don't know what happened to people
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:31.920]  i don't get it
[02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:42.160]  where is our guts where is our heart are we my sir are we men
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:46.320]  as for me i'll quote patrick henry man i'm not gonna sit here and play games
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:50.320]  with these people and let a big pile of puss
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:53.600]  like this government represents tell me what to do and run over me
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:56.880]  while they commit all these crimes in front of everybody i'm sorry i'm ranting
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:59.760]  i want to go to our guest
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:03.600]  we can't recognize the two quadrillion we've been signed on to than aren't our
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:06.640]  dads we can't recognize our health going out the door with all the
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:11.840]  poisons in the food and water but as i said they've banned
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:15.840]  halloween parties at universities everywhere just outright banned many of
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:18.960]  them because everything's offensive dressed up as a native american
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:22.000]  offensive dressed up as a cowboy offensive dressed up as a geisha girl
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:27.760]  offensive have a mexican style fiesta party people think it's racist
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:32.080]  they're making language and communication racist like 1984
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:35.440]  where you can't even communicate and remember they say if you say the
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:39.120]  fellow reserves private you're racist that's secret racist code talk
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:41.600]  adl something probably law center's been saying that for 30 years
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:45.120]  but see it doesn't work anymore does it everybody knows the fellow reserves
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:49.600]  private nobody knew that 20 years ago
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:52.400]  now they're not debating is global government being formed they're just
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:56.080]  saying oh it's no big deal it's the next step really totalitarian
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:59.920]  unelected global government whose philosophy
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:06.480]  is transhumanist eugenicist meets social Darwinism
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:12.320]  meets robber baron and now i take you to our guest
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:15.600]  who could come on for 10 hours me what a hero and he didn't want to hear this
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:19.920]  either but let me tell you he is a hero because he was a
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:23.760]  special agent treasury department doing the raids the whole nine yards
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:27.360]  discover the whole story most of you know at joe banister
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:30.320]  went and researched he's gonna go public and expose these people on talk radio
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:33.040]  he heard saying the fellow reserves private the irs collects the money for
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:36.320]  him and none of it goes to fund the country and in the codes all the fraud
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:39.520]  and blah blah blah and he just said i'm gonna expose these people he was gonna
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:44.800]  go public against him he was gonna come out and speak out against him
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:48.640]  two years later he said oh my god it's all true
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:52.400]  now they go on cnbc and admit it yeah the fellow reserves private and
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:55.840]  the irs pays for the money we're just slaves yeah they're appointing
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:59.120]  presidents in europe now the goldman's taxes yeah
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:02.800]  yeah they're finding more dead kids at the royal family house they were raped to
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:06.320]  death yeah they found a secret torture dungeon at the bbc
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:09.360]  where they killed little kids but no one's going to investigate because of
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:13.120]  national security i mean you can't make up the evil
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:16.080]  it's been growing under national security auspices
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:20.400]  in the west since the end of world war two unlimited money unlimited funding
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:24.240]  with no repercussions no oversight what do you think is going to happen
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:29.920]  the worst criminals will get in control because it's the only place they're safe
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:33.440]  you get into homeland security or top corporate governorship
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:37.040]  where you're too big to fail and the whole system defends you i had a top
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:40.320]  professor that i interviewed and we were in an article in the
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:44.880]  national post in canada six seven years ago and the professor openly told me on
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:48.880]  the phone forget their name they're in the paper
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:52.320]  well alex if this comes out we know 9 11's an inside job but if it comes out
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:55.680]  it'll bring down the whole government and we want the western governments to do
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:58.800]  good we believe in radical egalitarian socialism
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:03.920]  so we on the control left are not going to expose this
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:08.400]  they were honest but see once you say too big to fail we're going to skip this
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:11.120]  network break to give our guests more time
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:14.960]  once you go along with the idea that we can't expose evil because it'll bring
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:18.480]  us all down you've just signed on to the very worst elements
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:23.840]  they will become the new norm and that's how tyranny accelerates
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:27.840]  to the point now that the corruption has reached
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:31.280]  i mean obama is a dictator now he was elected but he
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:36.480]  acts as a dictatorial despot a totalitarian
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:41.040]  that's all the constitutional lawyers that's the former head of the nsa
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:45.200]  directorate saying we're under a total takeover of totalitarianism
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:48.160]  i mean that's what it is and now they want to start
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:52.240]  arresting people for their speech and throwing them in loony bins
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:55.280]  they're like well are you still on air because i'm one of the biggest loudest
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:58.400]  mouths and they won't go after me until they really drop the hammer
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:02.080]  but believe me they're going after my name and trying to assassinate my
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:05.360]  character and trying to set me up all the time
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:08.400]  more than 50 times i was approached in grocery stores
[02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:12.960]  and at dvd signings and at bookstores by feds saying hey alexa
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:16.160]  you want to blow up stuff together today you want to attack the state
[02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:20.880]  department and kill hilly clinton and i'm just sitting there going you're like
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:24.880]  a six foot five what are you a marine
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:29.120]  attached to diplomatic services and they totally freaked out
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:32.480]  because i could just tell by who they were who they were and i knew who ran
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:35.840]  security for belterberg and they all freaked out and ran off i mean
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:39.280]  they've got six foot four marines that look like they could unscrew your head
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:44.320]  folks trying to set me up okay i mean that i think i was like 45 years old
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:48.000]  that's how evil this government is how could you get someone to work against
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:51.360]  their own countrymen that they know are patriots
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:55.760]  joe banister faced prison twice for his speech it was
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:59.920]  publicized nationwide his trial but not when he was found not guilty twice
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:03.600]  they tried to put him in prison for decades for simply
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:07.920]  speaking about the irs being a fraud
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:12.480]  and now i take you to this piece of news
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:17.920]  walter scott shooting why you must always question the official story the cop
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:21.520]  two days ago gets caught shooting the black man seven or eight times
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:26.000]  fire date shots i think seven hitting they're debating the numbers that hit
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:33.760]  in charlton north carolina south carolina a video emerged showing north
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:36.880]  charleston south carolina police officer michael t slagger
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:40.480]  shooting scott in the back five times fire date shots total
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:44.240]  kind of babbling through that without a teleprompter
[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:51.600]  and here's the big issue you totally believed him media and kit nails has an
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:54.720]  article about this
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:58.160]  until the video came out and then the media questioned
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:03.040]  it's normal to question anybody it's not a conspiracy theory or taboo or wrong
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:06.640]  to question individuals government corporations you name it
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:12.400]  especially when they have a history of lying and this guy clearly did
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:15.760]  but if you know that some police departments frame people as he got caught
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:19.760]  trying to do with that taser dropping the taser on him
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:23.520]  then how do you believe the czar nev brothers
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:27.120]  carried out the boston bombing when the older brother worked for the cia on
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:30.640]  record russia bluest cover he didn't kill a cop like they said
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:33.680]  he was gunned down and run over in front of everybody they tried to kill the
[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:36.320]  other brother then cut his throat out to keep him
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:41.920]  quiet he said he was not guilty his lawyer then came out and said oh he
[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:46.880]  is guilty right before the jury and now he faces the death penalty
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:49.680]  in sentencing
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:57.920]  i take you now to joe banister uh joining us and his website is agent for
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:01.520]  truth dot com it's an excellent website he's also an author
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:05.280]  but just looking at this i have the new york times here
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:09.200]  that will put on screen because i can't find it admitting the irs takes tens of
[02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:12.880]  thousands of people's businesses and accounts with no proof of fraud
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:16.160]  and even the new york times admits it they have congressional hearings
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:21.440]  lawlets irs sees accounts on suspicion no crime required
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:24.320]  and then joe banister speaks out against this and they try to put him in
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:28.480]  prison this is a totalitarian move but how can you
[02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:32.720]  believe anything the system says when the dea for decades has been
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:37.120]  recording and tracking basically every phone call and lying about it
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:40.160]  joe banister thanks for coming on i kind of set the table there
[02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:44.080]  with a background of this persecution and now lowest learner
[02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:50.880]  the doj says no contempt charges for former irs official lowest learner
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:53.760]  she gets to persecute tens of thousands of people
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:58.560]  wrecking her lives causing suicides imprisoning people
[02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:02.240]  these are the type of folks that came after you they're allowed to commit their
[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:06.800]  crimes out in the open joe banister what do you make of that
[02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:10.400]  well thanks for having me on alex that's been a been a while huh 16 years since
[02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:13.440]  we met in that chinese restaurant in fremont
[02:20:13.440 --> 02:20:16.400]  california when you were doing the police state
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:23.600]  investigation the hole is very deep um you're right i mean i'm i was tired of
[02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:28.640]  a long time ago as were you uh where heads never roll
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:32.560]  uh you know lowest learner i mean right at the tip top
[02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:37.360]  of course uh obama and the commissioner of the irs would be above her
[02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:42.480]  and they're ultimately allowing this to go on but even someone like learner
[02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:46.240]  uh and all of the underlings that she was ordering around
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:50.160]  no heads roll they get their retirements they get their
[02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:54.000]  pensions their paycheck i want to know how they themselves
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:58.560]  can persecute even mainline pro-life and libertarian groups
[02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:02.960]  and try to put people in prison or to neither 501c3
[02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:06.320]  i mean they're just such conscious persecutors they're such
[02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:13.440]  conscious crux well i mean brimming with evil and again i
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:17.200]  all i can do and you do so so well and so much
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:21.120]  wider than me is to try to continue to bang the drum and
[02:21:21.120 --> 02:21:24.880]  get the american people in a much greater numbers
[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:29.520]  to to be sick and tired of of being treated like chumps and you
[02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:33.120]  you remind people of this so frequently and uh
[02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:36.320]  let's go back and talk about just just briefly before we look at the current
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:39.040]  crimes and where you see the world going because you're a smart guy i want to get
[02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:41.600]  your take on this you have a lot of family that's in law enforcement
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:44.640]  i want to get you know basically what they're saying now as you told me
[02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:47.760]  previously they used to think you were wrong now they're you know you've said
[02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:50.720]  a pretty freaked out as well and that's the same thing i get from
[02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:53.920]  other folks that i know as well that are in the enforcement system
[02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:57.840]  they now are having that moment of truth like the military realizing how real
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:22:01.360]  all this really is the denial is over now is the moment of truth
[02:22:01.360 --> 02:22:06.320]  but but describe for folks what they tried to do to you
[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:10.480]  for simply speaking out about what they were doing
[02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:14.480]  well in a nutshell alex um i had some clients
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:17.360]  after i left the irs and frankly the clients
[02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:23.440]  drug me in dragged me into uh dealing with the irs on their behalf and i
[02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:28.640]  really wanted nothing to do with the irs but a particular client um
[02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:32.960]  wanted to sue the irs to get his tax money back
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:38.560]  so he had already paid the irs the money the irs lays out uh instructions
[02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:42.080]  procedures to follow if you want to get your money back
[02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:45.680]  and so the client asked me to uh help him
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:50.400]  dot all the i's and cross all the t's to make sure that he followed the rules
[02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:55.360]  to try just try to get his money back now of course the irs there's a civil
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:23:00.880]  process that goes on as you try to do that and the irs can simply say no
[02:23:00.880 --> 02:23:04.160]  and then you appeal to higher and higher levels
[02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:07.760]  and that's the way it's supposed to work that's the way their manual say it's
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:10.800]  supposed to work that's the way the court say it's supposed to work
[02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:14.720]  but what the irs did is they turned that um process
[02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:19.600]  uh the client trying to seek a refund and using a cpa to help them
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:24.240]  follow the instructions uh they turned that into a criminal
[02:23:24.240 --> 02:23:28.800]  activity whereby we were fraudulently seeking a refund
[02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:32.640]  and it's very typical that the irs will do this to people
[02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:35.760]  uh they'll pull out the criminal prosecution card
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:40.640]  the specter of you being a criminal in order to silence and discredit you
[02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:45.120]  and uh unfortunately there's a fortunate and unfortunate part about this you
[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:50.640]  have to be charged criminally in order for you to get a jury of your peers to
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:55.280]  actually evaluate your conduct uh most of what the irs does they do
[02:23:55.280 --> 02:24:00.240]  civilly and there's no jury involved uh rarely a judge involved
[02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:03.600]  and so they can you know unilaterally unilaterally
[02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:06.880]  do all the evil that they do but when you're charged criminally
[02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:10.400]  criminally you still have an opportunity for a jury trial
[02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:14.880]  and i had a jury trial in sacramental california we were a little concerned
[02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:18.960]  because uh the majority of the jury pool
[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:23.040]  came from government service you know sacramental california is the capital
[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:26.560]  of california uh brimming with government
[02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:29.360]  bureaucrats and we had quite a few government
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:33.040]  servants on the jury and yet they were the ones that were the most
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:36.400]  awake so you never know how you're going to be
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:41.120]  surprised and so june of 2005 fighting four felony
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:45.600]  counts that would have sent me to club fed for quite a few years
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:50.320]  i was acquitted of all the charges and deservedly so because the jury saw
[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:55.200]  the most ridiculous allegations and then when we got to trial
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:25:00.400]  the government had no case a couple of the jurors told me after the trial
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:04.080]  they said well joe every time the government brought something up it
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:08.320]  actually made you look better aren't they supposed to bring up stuff that
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:11.600]  makes you look bad and i said well you know they
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:15.040]  i didn't have anything that made me look bad and they couldn't even manufacture
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:19.920]  anything after you again right there were uh other i mean
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:23.920]  immediately after my acquittal they started this six and a half year
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:27.680]  civil investigation and of course most of the civil
[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:31.520]  investigations that they do are really just veiled criminal investigations
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:35.440]  where they gather up as much information as they can on someone
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:41.200]  and look for any possible angle to prosecute them criminally so
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:44.800]  yeah it's been ongoing i've kind of i resigned
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:48.560]  to the fact i've resigned in 1999 from the irs but
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:52.080]  resigned to the fact at that point that i'd probably be
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:56.320]  dancing with the irs for the rest of my life so i'm kind of you know getting
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:01.200]  what i already expected and thankfully i'm still very
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:04.720]  appreciative of the rights that that do remain that we can still still take
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:07.760]  advantage of well sure a lot of people say this sounds
[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:11.840]  scary i better submit to them but they go after people that
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:16.320]  go along with the system then meanwhile upwards of half of congress
[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:20.000]  doesn't pay taxes or owes taxes mainly democrats
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:24.400]  they then don't get in trouble al sharpton can owe millions of dollars
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:28.400]  never pay it all the big billionaires have the laws written in the special
[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:32.720]  accounting firms not have the cpas and top lawyers tell me
[02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:37.440]  alex you're not an insider you're not allowed to have these tax exemptions
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:43.280]  and these you know the the the iris shuffle and all these other
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:46.560]  things they do that are legal but the way the irs
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:50.320]  interprets it i can't do it with a little bit of money
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:53.280]  but if you've got billions and you're part of the establishment
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:55.760]  then you can and that's what's so frustrating i'm sure you saw the new
[02:26:55.760 --> 02:26:59.040]  or times article in the congressional hearings a few months ago
[02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:02.080]  where they just admitted okay the irs does take innocent people's money
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:05.600]  they know they're innocent old ladies that deposit you know from their small
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:09.360]  diner six hundred seven hundred bucks a day pay taxes on it
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:12.400]  they now call that criminal even though it's not criminal
[02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:15.920]  and take everything the old ladies got i mean this is just
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:19.920]  wild and then now we see asset for us your seizure through the feds and local
[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:23.200]  police expanding i mean it's getting so naked
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:27.840]  uh is it getting worse or are we just more aware of it now
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:33.520]  uh i think both frankly uh you know in the 80s is when all the money laundering
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:38.400]  laws the structuring laws it all became um had a lot more power in teeth it was
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:41.360]  actually in the 80s that the irs special agents
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:48.160]  were um enabled to carry their firearms 24 seven it used to be prior to the 80s
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:52.640]  that uh they'd have to check their gun out of of a safe
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:55.520]  they rarely would actually carry their gun with them so
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:27:59.120]  the whole the money laundering laws the structuring laws all these
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:01.920]  laws that are tripping up the average american
[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:05.680]  this is something you you speak about so frequently you know problem reaction
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:08.640]  solution they tell the public that oh we have to go
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:12.800]  after these drug dealers and and get all these money laundering laws and sure
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:15.440]  they could choke up the the money launderers and the drug
[02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:18.880]  dealers if they wanted to but they don't but they actually
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:23.440]  want to use these uh measures to spy on the american people
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:27.760]  and the financial spying was some of the you know the earliest
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:31.920]  spying that they did i mean the structuring laws come from the
[02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:38.720]  the bank secrecy act right of 1970 uh so so the planning occurs many decades
[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:43.680]  ahead of time and sadly you know we collectively as americans we kept
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:48.400]  getting we keep getting boondoggled that uh oh the target of this is really
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:51.760]  these bad drug dealers and i found when i was
[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:56.880]  doing my investigations in the irs that wow why is it that all these bad drug
[02:28:56.880 --> 02:29:00.800]  dealers you know we may pick off one out of a thousand
[02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:06.880]  but meanwhile millions of americans every cash transaction that they do uh is
[02:29:06.880 --> 02:29:10.160]  being monitored well you've seen the the regulations
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:12.960]  change where they've gotten rid of most of the white collar armed
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:16.000]  investigators like you they'll go after corrupt billionaires
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:21.280]  and and the headlines are you know more irs investigators target blue collar
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:24.320]  i mean they'll do some fifty thousand dollar investigation over a thousand
[02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:28.160]  dollars of some blue collar guy that can barely pay his bills
[02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:31.680]  because they don't want the investigators going after the real criminals
[02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:35.280]  they want them going after the general public joe banister a true american hero

[02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:27.600]  it's alex joe i'll be honest with you
[02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:32.000]  i'm not really that big of a thrill seeker but i do like 700 horsepower in a car
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:36.560]  and get down the middle of nowhere and opening it up
[02:33:36.560 --> 02:33:42.160]  only one car production made america has that much horsepower
[02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:50.240]  but at the same time i like to really take risk fighting tyranny it's in my
[02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:54.640]  blood it's in my genes it's in my guts but one reason i get
[02:33:54.640 --> 02:33:57.440]  aggressive and i have a lot of energy and i rant and rave is
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:34:01.600]  i'm constantly thinking about all the times they've tried to set me up
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:06.240]  or had five guys beat me up in a parking lot
[02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:10.640]  and i gave as good as i got
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:14.960]  and they were surprised that i would even fight back i mean what do you expect
[02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:17.840]  ever happened again
[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:22.480]  but i guess it is surprising that somebody like joe banister would almost
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:27.360]  go to jail to tell the truth and be persecuted but i'll tell you back on
[02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:30.320]  this country was a lot more moral there were more people liking so evil
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:34.960]  couldn't take over the evil is not all powerful
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:38.880]  it's just that good men do nothing i think it was thomas jeverson said that
[02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:44.720]  and it's true but just the threat i mean if i know there's
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:49.920]  somebody downstairs in my house
[02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:55.680]  i am going to get so upset about them breaking in that i'm going to come after
[02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:59.520]  them that's an instinct and america has gotten this new
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:04.960]  inverted instinct to just grovel that doesn't protect you
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:08.400]  and so i think that's what i'm really trying to get out here is
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:11.840]  people email me and they call me and they say you're a fearmonger
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:16.080]  it's scary talking about the irs persecuting people well it's on c-span in
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:22.400]  the new york times what joe banister was telling people 16 years ago
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:26.320]  i mean they put urwin shifts peter shifts dad
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:31.600]  in prison and that i've read the stuff on air he's been a guest on my show
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:35.040]  the judge in the ruling put him in jail for decades and said
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:42.240]  because you wouldn't stop publishing your book
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:45.280]  we have guests we get on from prison who are then banned to talking to the
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:49.040]  outside world that just happened last week i mean
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:52.880]  folks this is what happens in totalitarian countries and i
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:55.280]  people just have a different perspective than i because they hear me talk
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:58.160]  about the irs and all the stuff that's happened i think man this guy's trying
[02:35:58.160 --> 02:36:01.440]  to scare us to go along with the government and some people think
[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:04.400]  that's why they leave me alone the government thinks you're cowards and
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:07.040]  just thinks that i'm up here telling you all this and you're just going to roll
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:11.040]  over in fear that's not how it works let's say 95 percent of the public
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:14.240]  rolls over in fear and five percent doesn't it's way
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:18.720]  above that the globalists can't carry this out if we don't go along with it
[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:23.760]  they need compliance we need to stop complying like joe banister did
[02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:27.280]  not be complicit and aid in the bed open criminal activity
[02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:31.040]  you know i like the younger lapin over in france
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:34.400]  and we're going back to our guests and your calls
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:38.960]  but her dad came out i think almost to sabotage her and endorsed the vici
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:45.280]  french occupation with the nazis of world war two
[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:52.240]  france stood down let the nazis take over they didn't fight the germans
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:57.120]  hitler was there four days after the invasion in paris maybe five percent
[02:36:57.120 --> 02:37:01.840]  halfway stood up and hitler could barely beat the french
[02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:05.520]  and the french who'd conquered much of the world and we're known as one of the
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:09.440]  most warlike aggressive people got a wimp reputation after that point that
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:12.240]  isn't even real
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:18.560]  what we have here is a foreign corporate takeover of our government
[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:21.920]  and you see it happening all over the world folks this is illegitimate
[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:26.640]  it should be so easy to say no and you know i know i'm i'm ranting here joe
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:29.920]  banister former treasury agent who went public with all this
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:33.840]  information 16 years ago has been persecuted but come out of it stronger
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:36.720]  i think what i'm trying to get at is people ask why i'm so animated it's
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:41.120]  because i realize how real this is you realize how real this is
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:44.000]  and then i want to just give you the floor to cover other iris topics and
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.560]  some of the good news i know you sent me an email about some of the positive
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:51.520]  things and then i want to take some phone calls will be all over the map
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:57.120]  thanks um i as you correctly point out uh you know
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:01.760]  there the part of the reason that we get so animated about this is
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:05.600]  because we actually pay attention to the people that are are
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:09.360]  suffering not only you know millions of americans getting their bank account
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:13.200]  seized and leans put on their homes and financially
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:16.880]  devastated but then those people who actually speak up
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:20.720]  about the irs and about you know why we have an income tax
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:24.720]  where did it come from you know it's the darling of carl marx not thomas
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:28.720]  jefferson um but the the suffering that goes on as you
[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:32.480]  you know kent hovind you had him on your show a few weeks ago
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:38.160]  um urwin schiff uh you know i'm another thing you illustrated is how you
[02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:41.360]  never know how they're going to attack you with you
[02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:44.800]  there was a lot of this cloak and dagger you know coming up and whispering in
[02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:48.960]  your ear kind of thing they never did that to me uh thankfully
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:51.920]  you know the stuff they had to do to me they had to come out into the light
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:58.560]  the light of a courtroom and a jury um but there's so many tentacles to the
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:02.160]  octopus and how many different ways that they can attack you and i don't mean
[02:39:02.160 --> 02:39:05.280]  that to scare people uh but that's why i try to encourage
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:09.200]  people to educate themselves if you think it's bad that
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:13.680]  lowest learner orchestrated this uh campaign against
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:18.560]  conservative people what about the fact that the income tax as it's
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:23.520]  administered and enforced it is a it's a scam in the sense that most americans
[02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:27.920]  aren't even required to pay the income tax there's no statute that's ever been
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:31.360]  passed by congress that makes you liable to pay
[02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:35.440]  the income tax and that's how they got it through without properly ratifying it
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:38.640]  was for 30 years after this is all in the history books for those that don't
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:43.200]  know they said don't worry it's not for the general public
[02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:47.280]  exactly and that's that's what kind of it you know we all have our pet peeve but
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:50.960]  i i so much wish that the american public if you're mad
[02:39:50.960 --> 02:39:55.120]  that the iris is attacking you know your pro life group or your pro marriage
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:58.480]  group or whatever it might be how about the fact that they've been they're
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:03.760]  taking money out of your pockets illegally and they've been lying to you
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:08.000]  since you know well since at least world war two if not really all the way back
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:11.440]  to 1916 three minute three years after the 16th
[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:17.520]  amendment uh so the lies are so deep but the biggest lie is
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:20.720]  you don't even owe the tax and we're really paying it
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:24.640]  just out of you know a gun to the head gun to the head uh nothing about the
[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:27.600]  cliche that oh we gotta fund the government it will collapse you're an
[02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:31.440]  expert on this break that down well sadly what people
[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:35.600]  understand is you know the federal reserve is is much like a credit card
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:38.880]  advance people most people probably understand that
[02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:42.240]  if you take a five thousand dollar credit card advance because you
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:46.080]  you know qualify with your credit rating they'll give you five thousand bucks in
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:50.320]  your account and as long as you pay the minimum payment
[02:40:50.320 --> 02:40:54.400]  every month you're fine if you stop making the minimum payment
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:57.920]  then they'll get ugly with you but you know let's say and well in the federal
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:01.600]  government's case you have you know a trillion dollar
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:06.560]  cash advance you can take and as long as you're making that minimum payment
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:10.640]  you're fine and of course the bankers what they want to make sure is happening
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:15.360]  is where does the government get the money to pay that minimum payment
[02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:19.840]  for the cash advance they get it from you and me
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:23.840]  and so the government doesn't care if they have to
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:28.560]  well frankly it's easier to lie to you and get you to come forward and give
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:32.160]  them the money than it is for them to actually tell you the truth
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:35.920]  or just do it because you know the law requires it and then enforce it
[02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:39.760]  it's so much easier to lie to people and that's what they've been doing
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:43.440]  for decades and I'm just you know part of my job
[02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:46.880]  hopefully is at least to infect the jury pool
[02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:50.320]  out there there's still Americans that serve on juries
[02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:55.440]  and I need we need them to wake up and the next time that there's a tax
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:59.200]  allegation against some defendant don't be so quick
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:03.680]  to accept that the government case that oh this is another tax cheat he doesn't
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:08.880]  want to pay his fair share that's a that's a load of crap
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:13.040]  and people need to wake up to that and how deep the lies go
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:16.000]  and you know if they're gonna the other thing that got to me Alex
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:19.680]  I always thought well how can they be so brazen at taking our second amendment
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:24.160]  rights and our first amendment rights what do they think you know
[02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:27.600]  and then I realized well if they can rip us off
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:30.800]  you know take money out of our wallets via the income tax
[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:34.560]  and that's a scam that most Americans aren't even required to pay it in the
[02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:38.720]  first place well then skies the limit they could do anything
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:43.200]  right that's right and and now if they can
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:46.880]  arrest reporters for reporting on wiki leaks and then ban them
[02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:51.600]  from talking to media while they're in federal prison
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:56.320]  then the sky's the limit I mean that's the thing we are so deep into this
[02:42:56.320 --> 02:43:00.480]  that I'm really worried about the next shoe to drop I do see an awakening
[02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:03.440]  but it's kind of like being awake while you're being burned at the stake or
[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:08.160]  something Joe in your gut where do you see all this going
[02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:12.560]  well I I see hope and I also have great concern
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:16.880]  you know America freedom to fascism which I'm sure a lot of your listeners
[02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:20.240]  have seen but I always encourage people to get
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:23.200]  get that film continue to be seen even by more people
[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:27.840]  Aaron Russo did an incredible thing for us before he departed this world and he
[02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:32.640]  made it with bladder cancer he was in pain while he made that movie
[02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:36.800]  that's right so you know watching films like America freedom to fascism
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:40.800]  realizing that people like myself or Kent Hovind or
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:44.000]  Alex Jones or anyone that's actually being attacked
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:47.520]  they are your neighbor okay just because your neighbor down the street isn't
[02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:50.560]  being attacked or you're not being attacked or your
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:54.320]  cousin isn't being attacked doesn't mean that people
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:58.400]  are being attacked by the IRS by the by the federal government being tripped
[02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:02.240]  up by this these thousands of pages or regulations
[02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:06.800]  and we need to speak up and speak out louder and we really need is more
[02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:11.520]  numbers we need but also look the IRS won't even answer
[02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:14.400]  calls or tell people how to comply with Obamacare
[02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:18.000]  as they prepare to start grabbing bank accounts and paychecks if you don't buy
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.160]  it and then they lied and said they weren't going to do that
[02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:25.360]  I mean it's just the lying too I mean how many lies do we have to buy from these
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:28.880]  people well again that's why I encourage
[02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:32.960]  people to learn a little bit more about these tax laws you don't have to be a
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:37.600]  tax attorney or CPA to recognize the way that the
[02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:41.440]  IRS like for example the 1099 situation most
[02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:45.040]  people know what a 1099 is and they think oh I paid someone over
[02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:49.680]  $600 therefore I need to issue them a 1099
[02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:54.640]  look at the regulations governing 1099s and you'll see
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:58.240]  at a minimum you may not even have to have a sole security number put on the
[02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:02.560]  1099 and you may not have to file a 1099 at all
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:07.120]  and that's what the regulations say now I recognize that the IRS will still try
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:10.640]  to enforce it as if these are requirements well
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:13.520]  it's indentured servitude that they're making you
[02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:16.800]  report on other people in what should just be an open transaction
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:20.320]  which is prior restraint and is antithetical
[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:24.240]  to a free society that's right I mean everybody knows
[02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:27.280]  we didn't have to live through world war two we can read enough about it to
[02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:30.880]  know that it was citizens reporting on each other
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:35.360]  that enabled the tyrants to take over and keep control
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:38.880]  so we've got the same issue going on here don't
[02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:42.640]  why are we reporting on each other and why are we reporting
[02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:47.280]  to a tyrant you know it's one thing to tell somebody something about someone
[02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:51.200]  else but when you're telling it to a tyrant somebody with a known track
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:54.800]  record as you say so that's right I mean if I see
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:58.320]  absolutely one time there was this grocery store gas station that became a
[02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:01.280]  drug dealing operation and they were obviously running all
[02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:03.760]  sorts of stuff out of there it was really seedy and gross
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:06.480]  so I did tell the Austin Police Department about it I said you obviously know
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:09.360]  this has been turned into a drug dealing brothel house
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:13.120]  right here off William Cannon right by my house I don't like it
[02:46:13.120 --> 02:46:17.440]  and nothing was ever done I'm not I'm just saying that was the local police I
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:21.040]  told about that though I would never call the IRS tyrants
[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:26.800]  even on my enemies because then I would be complicit in the tyranny
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:30.800]  you're exactly right and you know we have to recognize the IRS for what it is
[02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:34.480]  it's a tool okay individual IRS agents a lot of them are
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:37.680]  probably you know good people hard working
[02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:40.240]  but of course the thing that I fault them for
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:44.320]  is not again recognizing that if the agency is harming
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:48.640]  their fellow americans our fellow americans then they need to speak up
[02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:52.480]  about it and and what's been sad but not too surprising to me
[02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:57.360]  is how few IRS agents you know followed me out the door and I don't mean to
[02:46:57.360 --> 02:47:01.040]  puff me up like I'm some you know great thing but you did lead was a pretty big
[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:04.480]  group statistically very small and a lot of those IRS agents are in prison
[02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:08.800]  right now well for example sherry jackson I mean
[02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:12.240]  she she paid a lot higher price than I've had to do and of course that's why
[02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:16.400]  I don't yeah I don't like being called these names like hero and these things
[02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:19.760]  I've had it pretty easy especially when you think of how
[02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:24.880]  people have fought tyranny and tyranny's and tyrants throughout the centuries
[02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:29.840]  you know what did I have to do go to court and improve my innocence
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:33.600]  I've been very fortunate but there are people that are still suffering
[02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:38.800]  even today and you know I know there's there's a lot on our plates in terms of
[02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:42.560]  keeping track of all the the ways that the tyrant is
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:48.320]  inflicting harm on us but we can't give up as you said I'm not going anywhere
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:51.840]  it sounds like you're not either we have families
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:55.440]  but then our families are getting in the in the the fight
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:47:58.880]  and that's all we can do that's what's great is that your children and your
[02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:03.760]  wife everybody supported you so many people
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:08.160]  like Wolfgang Halbig and others you know his family's not supporting him
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:11.840]  and you know he's still going forward and it's just
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:16.800]  it's just so crazy how corrupt it's gotten and and that a cop
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:19.920]  because you know this goes on but to watch this cop plant that taser on the
[02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:23.520]  guy he's just killed that's why the cops down gonna go to
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:26.160]  prison is because you know he could have said he was
[02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:28.880]  scared or thought he had a weapon or whatever and he'd have got fired now
[02:48:28.880 --> 02:48:32.480]  he's going to go to prison because he would just cold-bloodily kill somebody
[02:48:32.480 --> 02:48:36.720]  and then try to defame him by framing him it just
[02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:40.800]  it makes my head spin well I'd like to remind everybody that you know the
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:44.240]  constitution requires an oath that each
[02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:48.480]  federal employee each worker takes an oath to support and defend the
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:52.400]  constitution not their supervisor not their agency
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:56.880]  but the constitution so the founders the constitution
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:02.320]  designated each and every employee each and every worker
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:06.720]  to that they had an obligation a watchdog defend the constitution
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:11.520]  correct and and you when you have everyone policing themselves
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:16.400]  uh how much safer is everyone when that's going on but unfortunately in this
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:19.200]  day and age uh they'll take an oath to support and defend
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:23.120]  the constitution and never having read the constitution
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:26.640]  law center training where they actually demonize the constitution
[02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:31.120]  and say look out for people to talk about it and you swore an oath to it
[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:34.880]  exactly but isn't it kind of funny how it actually becomes
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:38.400]  uh when they attack you and this is something I found uh
[02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:41.760]  grudgingly is that when you get attacked it actually gives you tremendous
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:45.760]  opportunities uh when you were attacked by pierce morgan
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:49.120]  look how you what you turn that we probably got 50 more stations out of
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:52.640]  that and an incredible support absolutely that's what I'm saying going
[02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:56.880]  through the fire being persecuted at least in my life
[02:49:56.880 --> 02:49:59.920]  because a providence or whatever has only made us stronger each time
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:03.280]  but then I see people they've killed they've put in prison
[02:50:03.280 --> 02:50:07.280]  uh that's why I'm I'm exactly I I mean if I get put in prison in torture to
[02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:09.920]  death yes I'm going to be a hero folks and I don't want that to happen
[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:12.960]  if Joe was in prison right now you could say he's a superhero
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:17.280]  uh like some of the other folks out there but in a world of cowards it is
[02:50:17.280 --> 02:50:20.320]  heroic to do what you've done Joe and you went against the peer pressure and
[02:50:20.320 --> 02:50:24.640]  you know they have studies that show that physical valor is more common than
[02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:29.040]  moral valor under peer pressure uh and it just takes a lot to go
[02:50:29.040 --> 02:50:31.600]  against that peer pressure and if we have more people like you in the
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:34.080]  government it wouldn't be so out of control corrupt
[02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:36.880]  we're going to go to break we're going to overdrive to Michael I promise I'm
[02:50:36.880 --> 02:50:41.280]  going right to you then Joseph uh then we're going to talk to

[02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:08.480]  Michael in Florida you're on the air go ahead and thank you for holding
[02:55:08.480 --> 02:55:12.800]  what did you want to bring up yeah hi alex um yeah i've never called him
[02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:16.240]  before i've been a big fan of yours for a few years um
[02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:21.040]  i heard you uh talking about the government drug deal in earlier so
[02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:24.800]  that's when i picked up in dial because it was weird because my father he was in
[02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:27.760]  the green berets for like 25 years stationed in
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:31.840]  for brag and now he's older been retired for a while and
[02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:35.760]  we're just out there drinking coffee the other day with my brother and him
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:40.000]  and he was telling us about back in the 80s they had a
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:44.480]  airstrip in smithfield north carolina where
[02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:49.520]  they were doing drills and everything and this also shows the compartmentalization
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:53.040]  because my dad i mean he was like in the midst of you know
[02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:56.400]  they're there like planes are landed with cia
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:56:02.720]  like c 130 like you always say like little bi planes uh like so they're there
[02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:05.920]  then all of a sudden the da shows up and my dad
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:09.280]  he's there doesn't have a clue what's going on they know there's drugs there
[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:12.240]  but they were told they're confiscating them and
[02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:16.800]  and disposing of them and then the da just uh took it over the whole thing
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:21.280]  over and then they take it and they sell it
[02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:25.360]  and then it was funny because then the next thing i said was uh because my dad
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:29.440]  he's like brainwashed by fox news and all that he's a good guy but
[02:56:29.440 --> 02:56:34.080]  i was like yeah oliver north i assumed i mentioned the name you know
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:37.040]  national conspiracy theory and he was there and seen this stuff and you still
[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:40.640]  can't even talk to these people oh i've interviewed the cia people
[02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:44.640]  terry reid and others who saw oliver north
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:49.680]  with the clinton's at minna and it is just it is it is over the top god bless
[02:56:49.680 --> 02:56:52.080]  you michael amazing call thank you for holding so long
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:55.360]  i tend to have guests on earlier right out of time and i hold the callers other
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:56:57.840]  talk show hosts just hang up on everybody i don't do that try to get
[02:56:57.840 --> 02:57:00.160]  everybody i want to go to joseph here in a moment
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:04.000]  and others but uh joe banister i mean just another example
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:07.360]  uh my dad's uncle i call him his uncle because my dad called him uncle he
[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:11.120]  lived across the street he was really his first cousin but older
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:14.720]  uh it was his mother's uh sister's first son
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:18.320]  he worked in super secret corrupt stuff and then
[02:57:18.320 --> 02:57:22.720]  said no to it and got out of it as an army officer i remember when i was a kid
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:27.680]  uh you know what he was like and uh he told my dad all this stuff
[02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:32.400]  i mean it but i mean beyond that the army hit teams they've got in the u.s
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:35.840]  you name it i mean the public is so naive joe banister
[02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:40.480]  uh well yeah michael brought up a great point about compartmentalization
[02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:44.240]  uh it was actually you know i was i was compartmentalized
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:48.960]  uh in the irs working in the criminal investigation division compartmentalized
[02:57:48.960 --> 02:57:53.520]  away from the auditors and the collectors uh but once you
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:57.280]  lift the veil off and you actually lift away the compartments
[02:57:57.280 --> 02:58:02.320]  and see the bigger picture uh you can see how your particular
[02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:09.040]  tasks actually help the tyranny so you know i would again encourage people to
[02:58:09.040 --> 02:58:12.720]  look at the bigger picture see how you fit into it
[02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:15.760]  and then you can make a better and more informed determination
[02:58:15.760 --> 02:58:19.280]  as to whether you know you're actually helping tyranny you're actually helping
[02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:22.960]  the steal from your fellow americans and take away their rights

[03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:45.680]  i'm over here in the high river valley george washington stomping ground
[03:00:45.680 --> 03:00:49.040]  uh he actually stayed in the house up the road here from where i live
[03:00:49.040 --> 03:00:53.040]  that's right he surveyed that area didn't he yeah he actually named the town
[03:00:53.040 --> 03:00:57.200]  that i live in actually but what i was calling in
[03:00:57.200 --> 03:00:59.760]  about you know just uh corruption of the police
[03:00:59.760 --> 03:01:05.520]  you know it seems countrywide you know but in the past year you know i've had
[03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:10.480]  state troopers come into my home i had three guys burglarize my house
[03:01:10.480 --> 03:01:13.760]  and one of them got hurt you know didn't shoot them or anything
[03:01:13.760 --> 03:01:21.280]  anyway like 17 cops show up break in and uh take my shotgun out of my wife's hand
[03:01:21.280 --> 03:01:25.040]  and i mean that's nothing i waved at some cops one day
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:28.880]  it's just in the past few months actually they pull over bugging their eyes
[03:01:28.880 --> 03:01:32.000]  out you know oh we're going to beat you down and
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:35.440]  all this stuff and but what i'm getting at is just
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:39.680]  probably about a month ago i had a cop knock on my door
[03:01:39.680 --> 03:01:45.040]  and uh he said you're safe police open up i said well do you have a warrant
[03:01:45.040 --> 03:01:49.040]  asking that i heard him out there like grunting and stuff
[03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:53.520]  but then three seconds they kicked my door in half had me down the floor
[03:01:53.520 --> 03:01:57.920]  started kneading me in the back you know they took me for five or six hours
[03:01:57.920 --> 03:02:02.880]  nobody even know they had me you know essentially they took me to jail
[03:02:02.880 --> 03:02:06.560]  you know i mean for asking them if they had a warrant why were they there did
[03:02:06.560 --> 03:02:08.880]  some neighbor make something up or what happened
[03:02:08.880 --> 03:02:12.080]  um well i guess there was an altercation out on the street
[03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:16.240]  you know like a week before uh my girlfriend was at church and you know
[03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:20.000]  she had like a problem with these girls they came then
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:24.240]  you know and i guess i made one of them mad that was an excuse
[03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:28.800]  he's like oh you're a smart alec so they made a plan they come back the next
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:32.960]  week and they planned it you know but what i'm getting at just the lawlessness
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:37.760]  you know the law is all we have out of society and these people are called law
[03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:41.040]  enforcement they're supposed to enforce well sure they're trying to hire like
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:44.800]  the tsa ad said in seattle imperious people that means
[03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:49.120]  arrogant uh in your face and and it's a planned
[03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:52.080]  de-evolution i appreciate your call let's get joe banister's
[03:02:52.080 --> 03:02:57.120]  take on what you just brought up well as you mentioned alex you know i've
[03:02:57.120 --> 03:03:00.960]  relatives in law enforcement two of my brothers are police officers and one's
[03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:05.680]  a battalion chief firefighter uh my brother my youngest brother jeff the
[03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:09.600]  san jose police officer he was just at a funeral last week
[03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:13.680]  for a san jose police officer who was shot with a rifle
[03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:17.440]  uh approaching a basically a domestic disturbance call
[03:03:17.440 --> 03:03:22.640]  in san jose so uh you know i can i can see it from both sides and all i can do
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:26.480]  is try to really encourage both the police and the public
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:32.000]  you know be professional be calm society is degenerating every metric shows it
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:36.400]  and george soros wants us to have a war with police what's your take on that
[03:03:36.400 --> 03:03:43.120]  uh well to resist resist that exact um program which is you're so so right on
[03:03:43.120 --> 03:03:45.520]  to bring that up and let people know about it
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:49.120]  so that we don't uh conduct ourselves
[03:03:49.120 --> 03:03:53.120]  and further that program we need to resist it yeah they want us all to hate
[03:03:53.120 --> 03:03:56.480]  each other while the foreign banks loot us i mean it's real simple
[03:03:56.480 --> 03:04:00.560]  i mean it's like criminals will set a fire to rob a bank or to rob a warehouse
[03:04:00.560 --> 03:04:04.400]  to divert they want a mini civil war to divert while
[03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:07.440]  they're robbing us i mean it's so elementary
[03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:11.200]  exactly and you know that the police we need the police to
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:15.440]  but we need them to do to adhere to the constitution and do their jobs
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:19.040]  and be a polite and professional with the with the public but by the same token
[03:04:19.040 --> 03:04:25.760]  the public needs to uh you know be be good citizens and act like a good
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:29.040]  citizen so that the the police can see the difference now you're still going
[03:04:29.040 --> 03:04:32.800]  to encounter you know the tyrant cop but don't think
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:37.120]  that that applies to them all i mean the the banister boys are out there
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:41.920]  and uh they're good guys and they they see uh what it's like you know what's
[03:04:41.920 --> 03:04:46.160]  like to be a real cop and a good cop absolutely we're not gonna play into
[03:04:46.160 --> 03:04:49.680]  the globalist civil war plan or at least we're gonna try not to
[03:04:49.680 --> 03:04:53.440]  we're gonna come to another break final break come back with jason

[03:08:27.360 --> 03:08:30.560]  one of the first movies i ever actually watched that woke me up
[03:08:30.560 --> 03:08:33.520]  and i'll never forget the scene from that documentary
[03:08:33.520 --> 03:08:36.240]  where uh the gentleman's business was broken into
[03:08:36.240 --> 03:08:40.080]  and his whole life was turned on a 10 so i just want to say uh you take me for
[03:08:40.080 --> 03:08:43.200]  all your work do you know why i'm not in that movie
[03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:48.560]  why i really resent the fact that the tsa was just starting all the genital
[03:08:48.560 --> 03:08:53.600]  groping when he was making that in like 2006 or whatever it was
[03:08:53.600 --> 03:08:57.520]  and i was so mad i was boycotting flying at the time and rusa wanted to fly me
[03:08:57.520 --> 03:09:00.400]  out to california because he was too sick to add a
[03:09:00.400 --> 03:09:03.200]  few interviews in there he wanted people to know he had cancer
[03:09:03.200 --> 03:09:05.840]  and he we were friends we talked all the time and i'm like

[03:09:26.720 --> 03:09:30.400]  tens of millions saw it i'm so angry about that but it's a great film
[03:09:30.400 --> 03:09:33.520]  and i'm glad you raised that any questions or comments you wanted to get
[03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:39.200]  into science and industry go ahead absolutely i um i'm in that i'm in the
[03:09:39.200 --> 03:09:42.560]  field alex i sell capital equipment through the account
[03:09:42.560 --> 03:09:46.240]  for the production of vaccines drugs you name it down
[03:09:46.240 --> 03:09:50.960]  down this whole spectrum diabetes drugs and you'd be surprised about the lack of
[03:09:50.960 --> 03:09:54.640]  quality control in a lot of these institutions it's really a joke
[03:09:54.640 --> 03:09:58.800]  we're talking about calibrated instruments not calibrated for years at a time
[03:09:58.800 --> 03:10:01.920]  it's really in the science is lacking in itself
[03:10:01.920 --> 03:10:05.840]  um i just have one more comment also if you want to know if you want to go ahead
[03:10:05.840 --> 03:10:10.160]  but absolutely um all my friends out there feel
[03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:13.280]  like what if they go through this awakening process right and i wake them
[03:10:13.280 --> 03:10:16.720]  up to get into it and then they go off the deep end
[03:10:16.720 --> 03:10:19.600]  and paul joseph watson talked about this quite a bit
[03:10:19.600 --> 03:10:23.040]  i find it really interesting where instead of encapsulating all the ideas
[03:10:23.040 --> 03:10:25.280]  that are brought to the table on shows like this
[03:10:25.280 --> 03:10:28.400]  they just go off the deep end they see everything as a conspiracy theory they
[03:10:28.400 --> 03:10:31.520]  can't they can't conceptualize the actual fact
[03:10:31.520 --> 03:10:34.080]  you know i'm glad that you just crystallized that because i want to do a
[03:10:34.080 --> 03:10:37.440]  whole video or a whole show and of course one person who's off the deep end
[03:10:37.440 --> 03:10:40.160]  isn't off the deep end to another person people can say i'm off the deep end
[03:10:40.160 --> 03:10:43.600]  but i at least cover things that are really going on you can disagree with a
[03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:47.200]  perspective or how i'm you know basically laying it out
[03:10:47.200 --> 03:10:51.840]  but yeah a lot of people wake up to what's happening
[03:10:51.840 --> 03:10:56.320]  but then they don't believe anything and then they almost think they can make
[03:10:56.320 --> 03:11:01.920]  reality that's a conspiracy theorist is just when they think
[03:11:01.920 --> 03:11:05.440]  anything could be if they make it up they're kind of like fiction writers
[03:11:05.440 --> 03:11:08.720]  that apply that to reality well that's what the establishment is
[03:11:08.720 --> 03:11:11.440]  they just make up a bunch of stuff that obama care
[03:11:11.440 --> 03:11:15.040]  lets you keep your doctor and the federal reserves federal and two plus two
[03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:20.080]  equals five and so so it's more just delusion
[03:11:20.080 --> 03:11:23.600]  because people are lazy instead of actually
[03:11:23.600 --> 03:11:26.960]  burp i see this all the time and i want joe banister's take on it
[03:11:26.960 --> 03:11:31.040]  because he's a smart guy i want his his expertise on understanding it
[03:11:31.040 --> 03:11:35.600]  i will go here is the passive aerosol spraying program department of energy
[03:11:35.600 --> 03:11:39.040]  five billion dollars a year here are the patents they add to the jet fuel
[03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:42.880]  it aerosolizes they say it's a global sunscreen program
[03:11:42.880 --> 03:11:46.560]  the guy won the Nobel prize in 92 for it and
[03:11:46.560 --> 03:11:49.760]  but they won't give us the details of what they're doing they just admit it's
[03:11:49.760 --> 03:11:52.800]  happening and people go oh we don't care about that
[03:11:52.800 --> 03:11:58.560]  you know 20 000 views on youtube but then if i just randomly for one of my
[03:11:58.560 --> 03:12:02.240]  reporters does calls it kim trails and says what's this
[03:12:02.240 --> 03:12:06.960]  and it's just a five million views and everybody talks about it it's like
[03:12:06.960 --> 03:12:11.600]  emergency centers establishment act civilian inmate labor camp program
[03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:16.960]  rec 84 cable splicer these are miami herald congressional studies
[03:12:16.960 --> 03:12:22.000]  videos of c-span i can prove they've built emergency relocation centers around
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:25.440]  the country but if you go pointed at some random
[03:12:25.440 --> 03:12:28.880]  building and say we think there might be a guillotine in there
[03:12:28.880 --> 03:12:31.600]  it'll have 50 million views i won't do that
[03:12:31.600 --> 03:12:35.120]  and but i don't get why the public loves
[03:12:35.120 --> 03:12:39.280]  to either believe the government lies or the opposite believe the most vague
[03:12:39.280 --> 03:12:41.920]  rumor and i but then when you're giving them
[03:12:41.920 --> 03:12:46.960]  bona fide proof they just will not look at it joe have you seen that or what
[03:12:46.960 --> 03:12:51.760]  would you call that paradox uh i have seen it and i i hope i'm not
[03:12:51.760 --> 03:12:56.240]  guilty of it myself but i what i try to encourage people to do is remember that
[03:12:56.240 --> 03:13:00.160]  as you educate yourself and become more aware
[03:13:00.160 --> 03:13:04.720]  others aren't necessarily following along and so it's so important so you
[03:13:04.720 --> 03:13:07.760]  stay in in tune with those people and you're
[03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:12.480]  able to communicate with them you need to try to remember as best you can what
[03:13:12.480 --> 03:13:15.600]  it was like before you were awakened and i'm not
[03:13:15.600 --> 03:13:19.840]  saying to just act like you're asleep but but continue to be calm and
[03:13:19.840 --> 03:13:23.920]  patient and uh you know especially the patients
[03:13:23.920 --> 03:13:27.280]  i had a family member i might have said this to you once before
[03:13:27.280 --> 03:13:30.960]  who was really angry with me when i left the irs and it
[03:13:30.960 --> 03:13:34.400]  and i just took it you know and i didn't really get that upset about it
[03:13:34.400 --> 03:13:38.480]  and it took a few years but eventually that family member came to me
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:42.880]  and apologized without me saying anything about you know i've come to
[03:13:42.880 --> 03:13:47.120]  realize why you did what you did and how dangerous are you know
[03:13:47.120 --> 03:13:51.440]  the things have become so that kind of illustrates to me how you
[03:13:51.440 --> 03:13:54.400]  we have to just really muster the patience sure
[03:13:54.400 --> 03:13:58.560]  and and people will come around well i have a real estate lawyer
[03:13:58.560 --> 03:14:01.520]  uh i mean i don't know him well but i've just used him on a few
[03:14:01.520 --> 03:14:05.680]  you know transactions he's one of the top lawyers in austin and he's a former
[03:14:05.680 --> 03:14:08.880]  high-level state judge and i mean i've had conversations with him
[03:14:08.880 --> 03:14:13.520]  and it sounds like he's you know one of us and the guys of former democrat
[03:14:13.520 --> 03:14:17.280]  and then i ran into another high-level state judge
[03:14:17.280 --> 03:14:21.840]  and the guys stops me and i thought i recognized him i went and looked him up
[03:14:21.840 --> 03:14:25.840]  later and sure enough it was him and he stopped me in an office building and he
[03:14:25.840 --> 03:14:28.640]  goes i'm judge such and such you know i just want to say i think you were nuts
[03:14:28.640 --> 03:14:32.240]  but he goes this irs thing targeting families targeting groups doing this
[03:14:32.240 --> 03:14:36.720]  he goes this is totalitarianism you're absolutely right and i apologize to you
[03:14:36.720 --> 03:14:42.320]  and it but i mean exactly people who aren't criminals themselves just can't
[03:14:42.320 --> 03:14:44.640]  believe it's going on because they're compartmentalized
[03:14:44.640 --> 03:14:48.400]  in the system but as this decompartmentalization happens
[03:14:48.400 --> 03:14:50.960]  people are going to have that moment of truth what does your gut tell you it's
[03:14:50.960 --> 03:14:56.000]  going to happen joe banister uh well i i think there's going to be the critical
[03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:59.760]  mass is getting there alex and i you know it's a as you've mentioned before it's
[03:14:59.760 --> 03:15:03.360]  a sprint to the finish line and it doesn't always get pretty
[03:15:03.360 --> 03:15:07.200]  near near the near the finish line in terms of you know what the tyrants they
[03:15:07.200 --> 03:15:11.200]  pull out the hats and the bats and the guns uh we've seen this happen in the
[03:15:11.200 --> 03:15:15.200]  middle east um we're doing everything we can to avoid
[03:15:15.200 --> 03:15:19.600]  that from happening and i think you're so right how we can
[03:15:19.600 --> 03:15:25.040]  make this make these changes in a nonviolent manner it can happen but
[03:15:25.040 --> 03:15:28.560]  we need more people on board rowing the boat
[03:15:28.560 --> 03:15:32.080]  and it's a war of ideas if so many revolutions are successful
[03:15:32.080 --> 03:15:35.360]  when they're nonviolent they're just not called a revolution later
[03:15:35.360 --> 03:15:38.880]  that's one of the biggest psyops is how they brand revolution is violent
[03:15:38.880 --> 03:15:42.560]  when those hardly ever work because they want you to try what doesn't work
[03:15:42.560 --> 03:15:47.440]  uh or tends to bring in something worse when it's the velvet revolutions of
[03:15:47.440 --> 03:15:51.040]  ideas that happen and it's called a renaissance
[03:15:51.040 --> 03:15:53.760]  let's go ahead and talk to delin and south carolina thanks for holding your
[03:15:53.760 --> 03:15:58.000]  on the air hey alex thanks for taking my call
[03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:02.560]  thank you hey uh i know i don't have much time left on
[03:16:02.560 --> 03:16:05.600]  here because uh i know we're in overdrive so obviously to get straight to the
[03:16:05.600 --> 03:16:09.040]  point quickly um it's fortunate that the shooting in north
[03:16:09.040 --> 03:16:12.080]  charleston here a couple days ago was resolved peacefully
[03:16:12.080 --> 03:16:15.520]  i actually have pictures in my possession of what charleston county
[03:16:15.520 --> 03:16:19.120]  police have in their armory that they're probably itching to use really
[03:16:19.120 --> 03:16:23.120]  bad they have multiple bear cat armored vehicles they
[03:16:23.120 --> 03:16:26.960]  even have an armored mobile command center and they even have flying
[03:16:26.960 --> 03:16:31.280]  surveillance drones and over 216 automatic rifles
[03:16:31.280 --> 03:16:34.960]  we actually also have a steel manufacturing company that produces
[03:16:34.960 --> 03:16:39.200]  m-wraps here in south carolina that's only about 30 or 45 minutes away from
[03:16:39.200 --> 03:16:41.520]  charleston and they've been producing them ever
[03:16:41.520 --> 03:16:47.040]  since 2007 i think and back in october in 2014
[03:16:47.040 --> 03:16:51.040]  there's a nearby city uh named summerville they actually had flying
[03:16:51.040 --> 03:16:54.400]  drones metal detectors and even a swat team on
[03:16:54.400 --> 03:16:58.720]  standby at a homecoming football game in the scariest i know it's all part of
[03:16:58.720 --> 03:17:01.680]  conditioning the public in preparation for economic collapse
[03:17:01.680 --> 03:17:04.800]  and you're of course talking about the town where the cop got caught shooting the
[03:17:04.800 --> 03:17:08.320]  black man in the back and then framing him with a taser
[03:17:08.320 --> 03:17:12.880]  uh and of course the media bought into what the police said until
[03:17:12.880 --> 03:17:17.120]  the video surface and kit daniels has an article on info wars dot com about that
[03:17:17.120 --> 03:17:21.520]  right now but my my point here is again they're
[03:17:21.520 --> 03:17:25.040]  pre-positioning the economic collapse they tell the cops are in a war get
[03:17:25.040 --> 03:17:28.240]  ready for it then they act like they're soldiers then they get attacked then they
[03:17:28.240 --> 03:17:32.000]  get federalized when they know statistically the police are pro second
[03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:35.920]  amendment on average and more apt to to to not go
[03:17:35.920 --> 03:17:38.560]  along with the globalist so that's why the sophisticated
[03:17:38.560 --> 03:17:44.400]  stops going on but you notice uh jurisdictions like this one uh in north
[03:17:44.400 --> 03:17:48.560]  charleston south carolina places like albuquerque
[03:17:48.560 --> 03:17:51.760]  it's certain departments and i've been now looking over the history of this
[03:17:51.760 --> 03:17:55.040]  department uh and this officer himself and it's
[03:17:55.040 --> 03:17:58.400]  definitely a bad department from what i've seen and you're saying you're a
[03:17:58.400 --> 03:18:00.880]  local i would love you to send us those photos
[03:18:00.880 --> 03:18:05.680]  and your commentary we do an article around that uh dylan
[03:18:05.680 --> 03:18:11.920]  uh sure what's the best way i can send them to you uh just say uh just say
[03:18:11.920 --> 03:18:16.320]  something like north charleston photos and send them to show tips and info
[03:18:16.320 --> 03:18:19.440]  wars dot com and then write a description to them
[03:18:19.440 --> 03:18:22.480]  and then we'll try to do it we'll first call and
[03:18:22.480 --> 03:18:25.520]  ask them about their n-wraps we'll we'll do a search and i'm sure they've shown
[03:18:25.520 --> 03:18:28.560]  them in public so we'll we'll mess them up with your photos
[03:18:28.560 --> 03:18:33.360]  we'll do some research and then we'll put a story out all right we'll do
[03:18:33.360 --> 03:18:36.720]  it's real simple we'll just look at their m-wraps search that term
[03:18:36.720 --> 03:18:40.080]  compare the numbers on it to what you give us and then people just like the
[03:18:40.080 --> 03:18:44.480]  fact that it's inside the armory and if the public's not been shown it and if
[03:18:44.480 --> 03:18:47.680]  they won't let us in we can then call it secret armory
[03:18:47.680 --> 03:18:50.880]  which it is if it is and then we can get people to pay attention
[03:18:50.880 --> 03:18:55.040]  and i'm not a manipulator but also people point blank no one cares if i say
[03:18:55.040 --> 03:18:58.800]  inside the weapons cache of the south carolina department that you know
[03:18:58.800 --> 03:19:03.280]  executed the black man no one's gonna care if i say inside the secret
[03:19:03.280 --> 03:19:09.040]  armory and there has been a secret build up but see it's that same thing where
[03:19:09.040 --> 03:19:13.120]  it's just folks will not care about something that's admitted
[03:19:13.120 --> 03:19:17.200]  they only want to care about what is like a who done it agatha christy deal and
[03:19:17.200 --> 03:19:21.760]  and i gotta tell you folks 95 percent of the new world order is out in the open
[03:19:21.760 --> 03:19:24.880]  and that's what's so frustrating about this is that you're not hearing what i
[03:19:24.880 --> 03:19:28.640]  think's going to happen you're hearing what they'd like to do
[03:19:28.640 --> 03:19:31.840]  so the only way i'm going to be wrong is if we succeed
[03:19:31.840 --> 03:19:35.920]  in slowing it down or stopping it then i get blamed for all this not coming
[03:19:35.920 --> 03:19:39.280]  true but you notice that's not happening because it's almost all come true thank
[03:19:39.280 --> 03:19:42.560]  you delin show tips at info wars dot com let's put
[03:19:42.560 --> 03:19:47.200]  him on hold and give him some of the other more internal emails
[03:19:47.200 --> 03:19:50.960]  so that doesn't get lost john thank you john harman i want to go to john
[03:19:50.960 --> 03:19:55.040]  erin sheepdog and tim sheepdog in a moment we're skipping this network break
[03:19:55.040 --> 03:19:57.600]  and going right to the bottom of the hour then letting joe banister get out of
[03:19:57.600 --> 03:20:01.520]  here and i've got a conference call on launching this system
[03:20:01.520 --> 03:20:04.640]  on satellite and tv stations nationwide so i've got to go
[03:20:04.640 --> 03:20:08.720]  at the bottom of the hour but briefly hearing what he just talked about
[03:20:08.720 --> 03:20:13.120]  remember when i was down there making a police state film in 99 covering urban
[03:20:13.120 --> 03:20:17.520]  warrior was trained to confiscate guns in the bay area on record
[03:20:17.520 --> 03:20:21.200]  nobody was talking about it then now at least there's a national debate joe
[03:20:21.200 --> 03:20:25.280]  banister uh very much agreed alex and i mean even
[03:20:25.280 --> 03:20:31.040]  when i think back of how how little of the um
[03:20:31.040 --> 03:20:37.360]  you know the pit that i saw and how much more you you saw even back then uh i
[03:20:37.360 --> 03:20:43.200]  think your your conversation with the judge illustrates how
[03:20:43.200 --> 03:20:48.320]  it's so beneficial that you delve into so many different areas and even
[03:20:48.320 --> 03:20:52.800]  myself who focuses on taxation but we need to
[03:20:52.800 --> 03:20:56.560]  make our our presentation as wide as possible
[03:20:56.560 --> 03:21:00.640]  because you never know what line in the sand you're going to help someone
[03:21:00.640 --> 03:21:05.040]  cross uh with the judge it was it had to do with the irs
[03:21:05.040 --> 03:21:08.560]  but for someone else when they see the arming of the the police departments
[03:21:08.560 --> 03:21:12.560]  that might be their line in the sand so it's really important to
[03:21:12.560 --> 03:21:16.400]  you know have a wide variety of of topics because there's a wide variety of
[03:21:16.400 --> 03:21:19.680]  people out there uh you know with their lines in the
[03:21:19.680 --> 03:21:23.040]  sand that they haven't crossed yet but once you show them that key piece of
[03:21:23.040 --> 03:21:27.440]  information all of a sudden they're with us and the globalists have done the
[03:21:27.440 --> 03:21:30.880]  math and they know the military number one and police number two
[03:21:30.880 --> 03:21:33.920]  are some of the most awake people because they've been decompartmentalized
[03:21:33.920 --> 03:21:37.040]  living it that they're natural allies of local
[03:21:37.040 --> 03:21:39.680]  government and state government to take the country back
[03:21:39.680 --> 03:21:43.120]  that's why they want a civil war and i get a lot of criticism going what's
[03:21:43.120 --> 03:21:46.960]  this butt kissing of the police you're the guy that exposed the police state
[03:21:46.960 --> 03:21:49.840]  yeah so the globalists couldn't take over the police
[03:21:49.840 --> 03:21:53.280]  i've tried to stop that it didn't mean i hated the average cop

[03:24:52.080 --> 03:24:55.920]  well then henson's listening right now and uh
[03:24:55.920 --> 03:24:59.040]  we could even go with our own style you'll see me sam and say

[03:25:19.760 --> 03:25:24.000]  then like 20 more gets sent in so i would imagine folks have that
[03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:29.040]  chase document we really need those but yeah in game for fortress takeover
[03:25:29.040 --> 03:25:32.640]  we're in game players well yeah they engineered the last great depression
[03:25:32.640 --> 03:25:38.720]  that's their whole ball game uh wow that was a chilling call wasn't it joe banister
[03:25:38.720 --> 03:25:43.840]  i'll say that the the plans call for us to be locked out of the party don't they
[03:25:43.840 --> 03:25:47.280]  well homeland security has a declassified nationwide takeover plan called
[03:25:47.280 --> 03:25:52.880]  operation in game i think it's just unbelievable
[03:25:52.880 --> 03:25:57.360]  we're going to be left out in the cold unless we wake up very very rapidly
[03:25:57.360 --> 03:26:00.560]  yeah i mean that's the thing a lot of people saw this 50 years ago and fought
[03:26:00.560 --> 03:26:04.800]  it and they were mainly military officers people in congress and police
[03:26:04.800 --> 03:26:07.840]  chiefs and folks who were being brought into some of this and saying i'm not
[03:26:07.840 --> 03:26:11.680]  going to go along with it they held it back for so long now it's here
[03:26:11.680 --> 03:26:15.600]  but the good news is we've been making provision for it so we're not flat
[03:26:15.600 --> 03:26:18.560]  footed i think the globalist plan didn't have that in mind
[03:26:18.560 --> 03:26:21.600]  john in wisconsin thanks for holding her on the year with

[03:28:04.640 --> 03:28:07.680]  and i appreciate folks supporting us uh erin you're calling in from the
[03:28:07.680 --> 03:28:12.320]  districts of criminals what's your take on ran paul
[03:28:13.520 --> 03:28:17.520]  i'm sorry i dropped i didn't hear you i see you called in about ran paul what's
[03:28:17.520 --> 03:28:22.160]  your take on that listen i think ran paul is great i'm
[03:28:22.160 --> 03:28:25.520]  just concerned that you might be a liability for him
[03:28:25.520 --> 03:28:28.800]  do you think he's willing to take you on board because i think you could be the
[03:28:28.800 --> 03:28:33.440]  guy that is his uh you know mouthpiece no he listens to a bunch of establishment
[03:28:33.440 --> 03:28:36.880]  guys he's going through the system trying to win he's a good guy
[03:28:36.880 --> 03:28:39.840]  i could get him on the show i've had him a couple years ago
[03:28:39.840 --> 03:28:44.160]  i don't even try uh because i'd have to call him up at home the last time
[03:28:44.160 --> 03:28:46.800]  his people wouldn't let me through and i said you know i don't like the fact that
[03:28:46.800 --> 03:28:50.080]  he said he wanted to come on and you're doing this so i had to call him up at
[03:28:50.080 --> 03:28:55.200]  home and i'm just not going to do that or call his daddy up i don't even care
[03:28:55.200 --> 03:28:58.080]  i mean obviously yes they're going to try to make me a liability
[03:28:58.080 --> 03:29:02.240]  and if he says it's a liability then he's gone to their trap
[03:29:02.240 --> 03:29:06.400]  people want someone who's radical they want someone who it makes a major
[03:29:06.400 --> 03:29:10.720]  you know uh break with the system they're sick of the establishment vomit
[03:29:10.720 --> 03:29:14.720]  erin i gotta jump sorry to ted in tennessee you'd be our tail gunner
[03:29:14.720 --> 03:29:18.880]  but we're out of time but what is your take on should we water down what we're
[03:29:18.880 --> 03:29:24.000]  saying joe or should we uh double down i think we should double down of course
[03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:27.440]  i'm not running for office but uh i think it's so important
[03:29:27.440 --> 03:29:32.320]  i mean americans need to look at the track record of the republican establishment
[03:29:32.320 --> 03:29:35.920]  they they talk about making heads roll they put on a good
[03:29:35.920 --> 03:29:40.800]  um performance uh there at these hearings but what ends up happening
[03:29:40.800 --> 03:29:45.920]  so do you want someone that's going to keep on saying we're going to get you
[03:29:45.920 --> 03:29:49.760]  and never do or do you want somebody that actually makes things happen exactly
[03:29:49.760 --> 03:29:52.640]  they've been coming after rand paul that's why he's the good guy joe bannister
[03:29:52.640 --> 03:29:57.920]  thanks so much in the gcn radio network
