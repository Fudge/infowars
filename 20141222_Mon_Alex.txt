[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.880]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:33.320]  if you are a foreign offshore above law banking cartel and the public starts to
[00:33.320 --> 00:40.000]  wake up to your activities what do you do well you try to divert and distract the
[00:40.000 --> 00:49.520]  public by creating internal strife that is beginning to border on civil war so
[00:49.520 --> 00:55.040]  we're not predicting four years ago or a year ago or six months ago or a month
[00:55.040 --> 00:59.160]  ago that the Justice Department was going to stir up race riots in this
[00:59.160 --> 01:08.640]  country and that the new act of protests would be to kill police and the
[01:08.640 --> 01:12.120]  police are also getting more brutal and killing more citizens there is a real
[01:12.120 --> 01:17.840]  problem there but the answer isn't kill more police or kill more citizens
[01:17.840 --> 01:21.760]  obviously so I want to open the phones up right here at the start of the
[01:21.760 --> 01:28.120]  broadcast for first-time callers today where we haven't called in a year let's
[01:28.120 --> 01:35.320]  say first time or folks that haven't called in a long time or police separately
[01:35.320 --> 01:41.240]  military you name it or anybody that thinks it's a good idea to shoot cops
[01:41.240 --> 01:48.600]  because I see on Facebook and Twitter a lot of people saying this is a good
[01:48.600 --> 01:57.680]  thing and I had callers yesterday that basically said they were Caucasians and
[01:57.680 --> 02:02.680]  that they understand all people are shooting cops so see it's not just a
[02:02.680 --> 02:07.760]  black-white thing there is a lot of hatred towards the police and I want to
[02:07.760 --> 02:11.960]  flesh out today where I stand and where I think as a country we should go to
[02:11.960 --> 02:16.800]  avoid all this because the social engineers have helped set up a lot of
[02:16.800 --> 02:22.560]  these problems then they ride those crises to greater and greater control
[02:22.560 --> 02:28.560]  and that is now happening right now and I'm not going to go back for
[02:28.560 --> 02:33.160]  credibility's sake and show you all the articles and special reports we did in
[02:33.160 --> 02:38.800]  the last five years predicting this intensifying the last six months
[02:38.800 --> 02:44.120]  everybody heard it everybody knows it you can see the preparations you can see
[02:44.120 --> 02:51.280]  the state-run media hyping it and now Al Sharpton and the Democrats and others
[02:51.280 --> 02:56.380]  are backing off a little bit and you've got the former deputy director of the
[02:56.380 --> 03:03.120]  FBI saying they think there's gonna be more of this you've got quotes from
[03:03.120 --> 03:07.960]  Sheriff R. Pio saying he's afraid it'll spread across the nation and police
[03:07.960 --> 03:19.600]  departments on alert now we tried to stop this paradigm from growing so at
[03:19.600 --> 03:26.600]  this point though I would just point out that state-run media continues to make
[03:26.600 --> 03:30.840]  the whole fight with the people in the government in this country about the
[03:30.840 --> 03:35.640]  people and the police instead of looking at the actual lawyers and
[03:35.640 --> 03:40.680]  politicians and corporations and special interests and treaties and the UN
[03:40.680 --> 03:44.760]  instead of really looking at what's driving the car we're talking about
[03:44.760 --> 03:53.440]  tires tire threats we're talking about where the rubber meets the road the
[03:53.440 --> 03:59.720]  cops and it's just the stupidest place in the world to point the revolution
[03:59.720 --> 04:05.040]  unless you want the revolution to fail and to be a big fat disgusting blood
[04:05.040 --> 04:10.640]  bath you notice the Tea Party's taking over the Republican Party the states
[04:10.640 --> 04:13.440]  are getting taken over people are really waking up so the globalists are
[04:13.440 --> 04:17.400]  flooding the borders trying to bankrupt us signing us on the derivatives get
[04:17.400 --> 04:22.440]  ready to go after pension funds they want to gut us before we fully wake up
[04:22.440 --> 04:28.360]  they want to use economic serfdom as a tool of control and if it means the
[04:28.360 --> 04:32.320]  globalists get away with it they will start a civil war as I've been harping
[04:32.320 --> 04:35.440]  and harping so I want it we'll get into a lot of other news on the flu
[04:35.440 --> 04:40.840]  outbreak and on Fox News investigative reporters saying that the CDC's covering

[09:01.200 --> 09:06.720]  coming up we have video of this and audio gun control advocate urges kids to
[09:06.720 --> 09:13.480]  inform on parents and turn in their firearms even when they're legal and to
[09:13.480 --> 09:18.400]  take this is a psa video being paid for through bloomberg groups to take your
[09:18.400 --> 09:26.640]  parents guns and take them to the police that's encouraging in my view theft and
[09:26.640 --> 09:31.960]  it's very dangerous hey you're 10 years old go get your dad's gun and take it to
[09:31.960 --> 09:39.200]  the police or take it to the school what if some 10 or 12 year old does this and
[09:39.200 --> 09:43.640]  gets gunned down when they pull a gun out at school I mean this is just this is
[09:43.640 --> 09:46.920]  just unbelievable we're gonna be getting into that report getting into
[09:46.920 --> 09:53.240]  paul watson's report there's just no end to the status just like in north
[09:53.240 --> 09:57.600]  korea trying to get control of our children's minds and telling us our
[09:57.600 --> 10:06.080]  children don't belong to our families they belong to the state time magazine
[10:06.080 --> 10:11.200]  says right-wing militias are the real threat to cops even though statistically
[10:11.200 --> 10:14.640]  you can look at the numbers people directly tied to right-wing grips or
[10:14.640 --> 10:18.680]  militias kill about four cops a year I have the just departments own numbers
[10:18.680 --> 10:23.160]  here conversely thousands die while riding tickets when cars come out of
[10:23.160 --> 10:29.680]  their lane still thousands more die in car wrecks
[10:29.680 --> 10:35.960]  thousands get shot in shootouts at bank robberies you name it with a drug
[10:35.960 --> 10:39.960]  gangs things like that no no no though when you go to the actual homeland
[10:39.960 --> 10:44.680]  security training manuals and videos it's all we're talking like 80 something
[10:44.680 --> 10:50.320]  percent about the evil right-wingers we've got to have m-wraps we've got to
[10:50.320 --> 10:53.280]  have tanks we've got to have armored vehicles we've got to train because
[10:53.280 --> 10:57.800]  there's a coming war with the patriots coming
[10:57.800 --> 11:01.760]  meanwhile you have the justice department and you now have the former
[11:01.760 --> 11:06.640]  deputy director of the FBI coming out and saying this you have police unions
[11:06.640 --> 11:11.240]  coming out and saying this and I'll go through the articles that indeed the
[11:11.240 --> 11:16.760]  White House and the Justice Department are putting out the narrative using very
[11:16.760 --> 11:24.360]  sad cases like Garner and Brown and others to cause a huge backlash a cause
[11:24.360 --> 11:33.920]  celeb and then a legitimization of shooting police as a form of protest
[11:34.360 --> 11:39.760]  which is hurtling the country towards an expansion of the police state in
[11:39.760 --> 11:50.680]  answer to it and to a backlash that will be unduly focused on to black folks but
[11:50.680 --> 11:55.800]  see the government wants black people isolated under government control in
[11:55.800 --> 12:01.640]  government reservations only thing the Democrats and Al Sharpton and MSNBC and
[12:01.640 --> 12:08.040]  mr. Maddow excuse me racial Maddow are going to save them they want them
[12:08.040 --> 12:12.760]  vulcanized and isolated scared of everybody that isn't black everybody
[12:12.760 --> 12:20.280]  that isn't black scared of blacks this is how they have destroyed the black
[12:20.280 --> 12:23.720]  community in this country to a great extent and they're using the same
[12:23.720 --> 12:29.000]  tactics just reversed to destroy every other community when the truth is people
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.800]  just want to live together in peace people go to school together they work
[12:33.800 --> 12:38.000]  together they get married people just want to get along and be friends and go
[12:38.000 --> 12:45.880]  play softball or go fishing people are just people see they had a problem 65 70
[12:45.880 --> 12:51.440]  years ago blacks in America were more conservative on average in the most
[12:51.440 --> 12:56.760]  conservative white areas they had higher savings rates in many areas the
[12:56.760 --> 13:01.240]  country higher legitimacy rates that is not children on a wedlock were
[13:01.240 --> 13:06.400]  extremely Christian were anti-communist the communists in the 30s trying to take
[13:06.400 --> 13:12.600]  over black communities it fell on its face so Margaret Sanger Planned
[13:12.600 --> 13:16.040]  Parenthood the Ford Foundation the Rockefeller Foundation this is all
[13:16.040 --> 13:21.200]  public knowledge you can look this up said we're going to go hire all the
[13:21.200 --> 13:29.640]  major black preachers pay them huge salaries build them churches and we're
[13:29.640 --> 13:34.400]  going to replace one system of control segregation with another to get rid of
[13:34.400 --> 13:38.760]  these huge rich wealthy black neighborhoods they said oh you don't want
[13:38.760 --> 13:42.040]  us in your hotel you don't want to see your restaurant that's what doesn't kill
[13:42.040 --> 13:49.360]  you only makes you stronger so they had hotels restaurants shopping malls you
[13:49.360 --> 13:56.280]  know department stores back in the 30s and 40s and so that we've got the public
[13:56.280 --> 14:03.560]  letters by congressman lbj and others by the 50s saying listen these blacks are
[14:03.560 --> 14:09.360]  voting for the Republicans they just passed the Civil Rights Act they just
[14:09.360 --> 14:17.200]  voted in Eisenhower for a second term we have got to shut them down the answer
[14:17.200 --> 14:22.560]  was the great society hey women we're gonna give you a free paycheck just
[14:22.560 --> 14:27.000]  don't have a man in the house and we're gonna have social workers and the state's
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.040]  gonna get involved and boy you can see what's happened you can see the
[14:32.040 --> 14:40.320]  destruction the destruction the demographics are over the top 80 plus
[14:40.320 --> 14:45.720]  percent some areas 90 plus percent illegitimacy crime rates in some areas
[14:45.720 --> 14:50.240]  10 times what they are in other areas and the numbers are well known they run
[14:50.240 --> 14:54.400]  from bad to worse and now those same demographics are shifting into every
[14:54.400 --> 15:02.880]  community because it's a program of degeneration and when they're done with
[15:02.880 --> 15:12.400]  all the hip-hop gangsters and all of the cop-killer music when they're done
[15:13.600 --> 15:22.560]  black communities are going to look like open-air Warsaw ghetto concentration
[15:22.560 --> 15:32.400]  camps they always test the takeover on who is seen as the weakest group and it's
[15:32.400 --> 15:38.920]  all Democratic Party run Chicago New York DC the list goes on and these
[15:38.920 --> 15:47.680]  cities collapse like Detroit when they're done and they know exactly what
[15:47.680 --> 15:55.360]  they're doing just type in lbj's racist letters on blacks type in Margaret
[15:55.360 --> 16:00.320]  Sanger's letters on calling blacks weeds subhuman weeds that had to be dealt
[16:00.320 --> 16:07.320]  with and how they would forge a liberal movement to get their trust this is not
[16:07.320 --> 16:11.360]  my opinion you can go online you'll go to major universities online you can see
[16:11.360 --> 16:22.080]  scans of Margaret Sanger's handwritten letters to different robber barons who
[16:22.080 --> 16:26.840]  were financing her to carry out the operations in fact go back up to the
[16:26.840 --> 16:32.840]  top of that and I'll give folks the source MSNBC Lyndon Johnson was a
[16:32.840 --> 16:37.720]  civil rights hero but also a racist and they try to spin it because he uses the
[16:37.720 --> 16:45.200]  word the n-word a lot there's the Washington Times Margaret Sanger racist
[16:45.200 --> 16:49.960]  eugenicist extraordinaire but they just call them racist folks they lay out the
[16:49.960 --> 16:56.920]  complete plan in public letters that I've made films on to kill as many black
[16:56.920 --> 17:03.000]  people as they can and they've done a great job 52% of blacks since 1973 never
[17:03.000 --> 17:10.400]  got out of the womb in one piece you're not gonna hear anything from the
[17:10.400 --> 17:15.360]  Reverend Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton or any of these people that oh black lives
[17:15.360 --> 17:20.680]  matter and I can't breathe and use some of these sickening examples to stir
[17:20.680 --> 17:27.960]  everybody up let me tell you cops didn't kill 52% of black people the government
[17:27.960 --> 17:37.600]  did in a letter to Gable and 39 that's proctor and gamble we do not want word to
[17:37.600 --> 17:42.080]  go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the
[17:42.080 --> 17:47.600]  man who can strengthen and straighten out the idea that if it ever occurs to
[17:47.600 --> 17:53.280]  any of their more rebellious members Margaret Sanger commenting on the Negro
[17:53.280 --> 17:58.640]  project that Tuskegee was part of that just everybody know injecting blacks
[17:58.640 --> 18:04.080]  with syphilis in a letter to gamble December 10th 1939 and it just goes on
[18:04.080 --> 18:11.120]  from there do you understand so I don't want to hear a bunch of arrogant high
[18:11.120 --> 18:15.880]  horsing all shut up your your white racist and that's usually from some
[18:15.880 --> 18:22.160]  trust fund racist punk like this guy we have an article about it on info wars
[18:22.160 --> 18:25.400]  dot com that works for the Justice Department meets with him oh you know
[18:25.400 --> 18:31.600]  white he's running around on video saying hey pigs in a blanket pigs in a
[18:31.600 --> 18:38.360]  blanket to the police there's new video of him running around saying that pigs
[18:38.360 --> 18:47.520]  in a blanket I'm gonna get to that name him later this is so the police all
[18:47.520 --> 18:53.480]  form ranks see the public as the enemy and all these tactics that will then be
[18:53.480 --> 19:00.720]  used on poor black folks will then be used on everybody else Ferguson
[19:00.720 --> 19:07.400]  protester met with DOJ taunts police with NYPD cop killer quote fellow
[19:07.400 --> 19:15.080]  protester label shooter mother bleeping hero was he a hero for shooting his
[19:15.080 --> 19:22.160]  girlfriend right before he went into that too and granted a lot of new york
[19:22.160 --> 19:28.400]  pd are arrogant there they're in their own world it is a sight to behold I've
[19:28.400 --> 19:32.640]  been in Mexico around corrupt police and they're not as arrogant though they'll
[19:32.640 --> 19:36.920]  shake you down worse they're more corrupt probably but not as arrogant
[19:36.920 --> 19:39.760]  because they understand they just want the money they don't want to rub your

[23:54.360 --> 23:58.320]  supernatural silver dot com
[23:58.320 --> 24:23.480]  I am your host Alex Jones I want to open the phones up to hear from people that
[24:23.480 --> 24:28.680]  think it's a good idea to shoot police because we even had a few calls
[24:28.680 --> 24:32.360]  yesterday saying well I don't want to shoot the police but you know they've
[24:32.360 --> 24:38.360]  got it coming and see there's the paradox because if you look at Albuquerque
[24:38.360 --> 24:42.520]  that has one of the highest rates of shooting unarmed people homeless people
[24:42.520 --> 24:47.120]  and as the cops pull up one of them says you know I'm gonna kill this guy I
[24:47.120 --> 24:51.200]  can't wait to kill him and then they shoot him over and over again and then
[24:51.200 --> 24:57.480]  let the dog bite on his dead body and then nobody gets in trouble and you see
[24:57.480 --> 25:02.760]  police choke somebody to death and then they don't get in trouble but even if you
[25:02.760 --> 25:09.320]  think that's cold-blooded murder then do you randomly go out and just shoot two
[25:09.320 --> 25:18.560]  cops sitting in a car absolutely not plus all that's going to do is start a
[25:18.560 --> 25:23.240]  civil war the police will arm they will start getting itchy trigger fingers
[25:23.240 --> 25:31.360]  they'll start killing more citizens and it is going to turn into a giant blood
[25:31.360 --> 25:43.000]  bath it is going to descend and you can see the media the state-run media the
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.200]  same ones that want our borders open and want our kids and want forced in
[25:47.200 --> 25:51.720]  occupations and want our guns and are putting us under UN treaty and they want
[25:51.720 --> 25:58.520]  to censor the internet and they want to control our lives the rich crony
[25:58.520 --> 26:01.880]  capitalist elite that aren't free market that are insulated for most of this
[26:01.880 --> 26:06.720]  course Bloomberg's kid just got mugged on Friday they said oh normally there are
[26:06.720 --> 26:12.560]  police stations at the house but they're worked that night oh you get police
[26:12.560 --> 26:17.160]  station at your house but if I live in Chicago I don't and I'm not supposed to
[26:17.160 --> 26:24.680]  have a gun actually with the other gun grabber Rahm Emanuel oh it was Rahm
[26:24.680 --> 26:31.200]  Emanuel son that's right did I say Bloomberg I think so I can't keep track
[26:31.200 --> 26:36.240]  of all these gun grabbers I know almost every gun control group out there is
[26:36.240 --> 26:42.560]  funded by Bloomberg or by George Soros or by the UN or by the Ford Foundation but
[26:42.560 --> 26:50.880]  yes mayor Emanuel son robbed outside Family Lakeview home CBS News thank you
[26:50.880 --> 26:57.120]  for correcting me I'd mix these traders all up Michael Moore who has six body
[26:57.120 --> 27:03.480]  guards his guys have been arrested carrying guns illegally before I tried
[27:03.480 --> 27:07.440]  to ask more a question on the street it's in my film martial law so his guys
[27:07.440 --> 27:12.920]  started basically hitting me bumping into me and as soon as I ran my elbow back
[27:12.920 --> 27:19.960]  into his side he oh those are some bodyguards let me tell you that was
[27:19.960 --> 27:25.640]  pretty funny actually it's on video I want to hear from you on this issue I
[27:25.640 --> 27:29.120]  know I talk about it a lot because this is what the globalist plan to do
[27:29.120 --> 27:36.760]  destabilize this country racial tension focus the anger that people have on the
[27:36.760 --> 27:42.480]  government at the police instead of the criminals up the chain there are a lot
[27:42.480 --> 27:48.280]  of peaceful ways effective ways with ideas and lawsuits and peaceful
[27:48.280 --> 27:54.840]  demonstrations to take this country on this planet back freedom is popular we
[27:54.840 --> 28:01.320]  need to legalize freedom as Ron Paul has said over and over again and I've seen
[28:01.320 --> 28:06.320]  the entire preparation by the Pentagon the police system you name it to bring
[28:06.320 --> 28:16.320]  in this crisis that Obama in his last two years plans to kick off the toll
[28:16.320 --> 28:22.160]  free number to join us first-time callers or police or people that agree
[28:22.160 --> 28:25.840]  because I got two of these calls your stay well I don't want to kill cops but
[28:25.840 --> 28:29.840]  I see why it's happening because you know they're killing a lot of us and they
[28:29.840 --> 28:35.880]  were white guys that called it and I've got a lot of criticism on info wars
[28:35.880 --> 28:42.000]  dot com it's a minority of criticism but it's there and on YouTube hey Alex you
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.360]  know the police are out of control well you don't fix a problem by doing more
[28:47.360 --> 28:50.360]  of something evil two wrongs don't make a right
[28:50.360 --> 28:56.480]  MSNBC is hyping this and demonizing the police that's all you need to know
[28:56.480 --> 29:01.960]  they're scapegoating the most visible group that is in many respects the
[29:01.960 --> 29:07.840]  enforcer of the corrupt system but they're Americans too and you just
[29:07.840 --> 29:12.400]  cannot say because someone is in a blue uniform that they're the bad guy when
[29:12.400 --> 29:16.160]  there's so many different jurisdictions some that's why we don't want a central
[29:16.160 --> 29:20.440]  federal government running at all because then there's no diversity in it
[29:20.440 --> 29:29.960]  there's no reform it just tends to get more corrupt 800 259 92 31 can we stop
[29:29.960 --> 29:35.440]  the attempt to start race war civil unrest and a civil war between the
[29:35.440 --> 29:39.440]  people and the police that once they get it started time magazine saying it
[29:39.440 --> 29:44.880]  they're gonna flip it onto the Patriots just like they said that the Homeland

[33:33.080 --> 33:39.600]  Texas broadcasting world-wide it's Alex Jones
[33:42.840 --> 33:50.880]  the AP reports that police killings of blacks has been voted the top story of
[33:50.880 --> 33:58.120]  2014 I think the militarization of police and the federalization and the
[33:58.120 --> 34:02.080]  internationalization of police because the feds themselves are captured and
[34:02.080 --> 34:09.000]  occupied that's just a fact that is one of the biggest issues in the country but
[34:09.000 --> 34:16.240]  the fact that the media could make I don't know what is it a couple hundred
[34:16.240 --> 34:26.520]  maybe controversial cases maximum of black Americans being shot by police is
[34:26.520 --> 34:32.960]  that really the top issue in the country or is millions of black babies
[34:32.960 --> 34:38.120]  aborted this year does that matter no no no that doesn't even blip on the radar
[34:38.120 --> 34:46.200]  screen every week I see an article where a black cop in a questionable shooting
[34:46.200 --> 34:52.320]  shoots a white person there are no riots there because there is no media
[34:52.320 --> 35:00.880]  hyping it like the police just shot Martin Luther King the media run by the
[35:00.880 --> 35:08.280]  globalist is hyping it so you know it's not good that's what I'm saying the
[35:08.280 --> 35:13.160]  police killings of unarmed blacks in Ferguson Missouri and elsewhere and the
[35:13.160 --> 35:17.960]  investigations and tumultuous protest they inspired was the top news story
[35:17.960 --> 35:21.720]  2014 according to the Associated Press annual poll of US editors and news
[35:21.720 --> 35:27.720]  directors see how it serves as a giant distraction not the president becoming a
[35:27.720 --> 35:35.400]  dictator not Raul Castro saying be a dictator use your powers not the open
[35:35.400 --> 35:40.000]  borders and legalizing the illegals not the global government being openly
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.120]  announced or our own government getting caught funding ISIS and our own
[35:44.120 --> 35:51.920]  military saying no to it none of that matters in a year crowned with dramatic
[35:51.920 --> 35:56.480]  and often retching news developments around the world the number two story
[35:56.480 --> 36:01.880]  was the devastating outbreak of Ebola in West Africa followed by the conflict in
[36:01.880 --> 36:05.840]  Iraq and Syria fueled by the brutal actions of the Islamic State militants
[36:05.840 --> 36:11.200]  how about fueled by the West publicly when you really know what's going on
[36:11.200 --> 36:15.800]  reading this is just it's like 1984 it's like I'm working in the Ministry of
[36:15.800 --> 36:22.760]  Truth or something reading this propaganda among the 85 voters casting
[36:22.760 --> 36:26.960]  ballots first place votes were spread among 15 different stories the Ferguson
[36:26.960 --> 36:36.200]  entry received 22 first place votes Ebola 11 in Islamic State stories 12 and I
[36:36.200 --> 36:39.440]  guess it's kind of true that that would be the top story of the year because
[36:39.440 --> 36:44.320]  they're just reporting on what the top story was but the same media state-run
[36:44.320 --> 36:50.240]  media made it the top story so that we'd all be at each other's throats and I
[36:50.240 --> 36:58.400]  know I harp in on this because it's so central to everything the president
[36:58.400 --> 37:02.280]  outside of Congress since January legalizes anybody and everybody that
[37:02.280 --> 37:07.160]  hits our shores they've had top border patrol officials on record say quote we
[37:07.160 --> 37:14.240]  complete the smuggling process we load them on buses we give them money they
[37:14.240 --> 37:18.240]  are shipped to Democratic Party facilities or to government schools or to
[37:18.240 --> 37:26.560]  Democrat homes or to churches and that's it I've got family goes to Methodist
[37:26.560 --> 37:31.600]  Church they basically take up offerings to help finance all this I mean this is
[37:31.600 --> 37:37.880]  prolific ladies and gentlemen but oh that's not even a story the president
[37:37.880 --> 37:41.560]  becoming a dictator for all intents and purposes not a story so I'll throw this
[37:41.560 --> 37:49.960]  out at the listeners to a can we stop a race war civil unrest being started b where
[37:49.960 --> 37:56.480]  do you focus your real political energy your peaceful energy but certainly you
[37:56.480 --> 38:02.520]  don't focus violent energy on cops as I said when the civil war kicks off if
[38:02.520 --> 38:06.960]  they're successful that's who's going to take the brunt of it and a lot of people
[38:06.960 --> 38:10.920]  at a primitive level will go good they deserve it they've had authority and have
[38:10.920 --> 38:17.480]  been arrogant and imperious and brutal really from small-town cops to cops down
[38:17.480 --> 38:25.160]  your street they've really been brutal to you they've really all of them because
[38:25.160 --> 38:31.120]  I've had I've seen corrupt police growing up drug dealing police I've also
[38:31.120 --> 38:37.920]  seen police help a lot of people and police have helped me so under the
[38:37.920 --> 38:42.400]  Constitution it's a good thing under the New World Order system yes the police
[38:42.400 --> 38:50.160]  are under a bad system but we need to attack the system intellectually and
[38:50.160 --> 38:55.080]  not follow MSNBC and Al Sharpton's Q along with media matters who again
[38:55.080 --> 39:02.280]  attacked me a month ago think the headline was deranged Alex Jones claims
[39:02.280 --> 39:06.000]  Obama and the Justice Department trying to stop race war and want to get cops
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.080]  killed can you guys pull that up I want to read the quotes now you see it
[39:10.080 --> 39:17.360]  happening they know full well I'm exposing them they don't like it because
[39:17.360 --> 39:20.640]  when they're done wiping out a whole bunch of police and the full police state
[39:20.640 --> 39:25.360]  comes in they're gonna put real criminal thugs in who when they order them to go
[39:25.360 --> 39:28.560]  mow down a bunch of people in the inner city they'll do it or when they order
[39:28.560 --> 39:36.600]  them to come grab me and put a bag over my head and disappear me they'll do it
[39:36.600 --> 39:39.520]  that was their headline on the bowl I forget their headline like a month ago
[39:39.520 --> 39:43.920]  was something like that about Jones's latest theory Obama wants race war I
[39:43.920 --> 39:48.000]  think raw story did that to mother Jones all the usual White House controlled
[39:48.000 --> 39:57.720]  suspects but that's how communists and socialists always direct things is at
[39:57.720 --> 40:01.600]  the grassroots government because they want to just overthrow that or
[40:01.600 --> 40:06.040]  intimidate that so that it backs down and then lets them get in charge of the
[40:06.040 --> 40:12.760]  government apparatus at the top there it is Salon Alex Jones is wild new
[40:12.760 --> 40:18.400]  Ferguson theory the wingnut oh that really discredits me using my will call
[40:18.400 --> 40:23.040]  me the space alien radio host is convinced that the riots are merely the
[40:23.040 --> 40:28.760]  first salvo in Obama's nationwide race war and then you go read my quotes I
[40:28.760 --> 40:31.880]  said they're planning a war to start killing police and you see what's
[40:31.880 --> 40:37.800]  happening and again I'm not bragging about how I'm right I'm telling you we
[40:37.800 --> 40:45.160]  know what we're talking about here and when they're done getting a race war
[40:45.160 --> 40:53.160]  with the police going race slash police war going destabilization campaign
[40:53.160 --> 40:56.920]  they'll fully federalize the police and then they're going to flip it they've
[40:56.920 --> 41:00.840]  already behind the scenes already done this on to gun owners returning
[41:00.840 --> 41:08.120]  veterans constitutionalist pro-lifers evangelicals and then on to anti-war
[41:08.120 --> 41:13.680]  groups everybody on the left as well and on to protest and freedom of speech
[41:13.680 --> 41:18.800]  period it will be seen as something that is linked to cops getting their heads
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.560]  blown off and the police will go out and get more brutal and then it's going to
[41:23.560 --> 41:27.560]  spread and then they're going to skip the orders or start targeting patriots
[41:27.560 --> 41:31.200]  and patriots are going to see other patriots drug away and disappeared and
[41:31.200 --> 41:38.240]  then patriots are going to start fighting back and oh my gosh is it going to be
[41:38.240 --> 41:45.560]  horrible and you will see George Soros and all the rest of the the the rocker
[41:45.560 --> 41:50.120]  fellers and the rest they'll go hide out in Europe they'll go hide out Monte
[41:50.120 --> 41:59.400]  Carlo or in Geneva or in London while all this goes down and it is going to be
[41:59.400 --> 42:04.880]  hellish and that's how you bring down America and that's the plan and that's
[42:04.880 --> 42:09.560]  why I talk about this at least once a week in detail because if we don't turn
[42:09.560 --> 42:13.000]  this around this is how they're going to take the nation down and they're going
[42:13.000 --> 42:17.640]  to take out their enemy the states and the cities the independent jurisdictions
[42:17.640 --> 42:23.840]  whether they be good bad or ugly there's a mix and the American people and the
[42:23.840 --> 42:28.520]  veterans at the globalist fear they want to wear us out killing each other and
[42:28.520 --> 42:33.760]  then they're going to roll in after two three years of this they're going to roll
[42:33.760 --> 42:38.760]  in with the UN troops as Zbigniew Brzezinski and David Rockefeller and
[42:38.760 --> 42:44.160]  Henry Kissinger have all been quoted in foreign affairs magazine of the
[42:44.160 --> 42:49.040]  council on foreign relations they've all shot their mouths off for 20 years about
[42:49.040 --> 42:54.200]  how they were going to use race riots and destabilization Balkanization just
[42:54.200 --> 42:58.600]  like they'll stir up a civil war in Syria and then say oh we got to go into in the
[42:58.600 --> 43:03.120]  civil war or they'll start a civil war in Tunisia or they'll start a civil war in
[43:03.120 --> 43:07.800]  Egypt they'll start a civil war in Iraq
[43:08.360 --> 43:13.080]  to then bring in their solution breaking the countries up and putting them
[43:13.080 --> 43:19.480]  into larger super regions this is a ancient Roman slash British in the more
[43:19.480 --> 43:25.320]  modern sense great game is what it's called just Google British Empire the
[43:25.320 --> 43:31.840]  great game that's what it was called by Cecil Rhodes by Kipling by all of them
[43:31.840 --> 43:39.760]  just it's all there it's all public the battle plan is public and here's time
[43:39.760 --> 43:45.760]  magazine we're gonna go to your calls oh there it is the great game was a term
[43:45.760 --> 43:49.680]  for the strategic rivalry and conflict between the British Empire and the
[43:49.680 --> 43:54.760]  Russian Empire the supremacy in Central Asia the classic great game period is
[43:54.760 --> 44:00.520]  generally regarded as a running approximately from the Russo Persian
[44:00.520 --> 44:06.160]  Treaty of 1813 to the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 a less intensive phase
[44:06.160 --> 44:11.440]  followed the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 that's right British Intel put the
[44:11.440 --> 44:18.200]  island and in be classified in the post-Second World War they put old
[44:18.200 --> 44:23.800]  Alos Hitler in there in the post-Second World War post-colonial period the
[44:23.800 --> 44:27.600]  term has continued in use describe the geopolitical machinations of great
[44:27.600 --> 44:32.680]  powers and regional powers as they vie for geopolitical power and influence in
[44:32.680 --> 44:38.400]  the area the great game is usually attributed to Arthur Conley the
[44:38.400 --> 44:43.520]  intelligence officer and the head of the British East India Company six bingo
[44:43.520 --> 44:47.880]  light cavalry it was introduced in the mainstream consciousness by British
[44:47.880 --> 44:53.400]  novelist Rudger Kipling see my memory is pretty good in his novel Kim almost
[44:53.400 --> 44:58.160]  bought that for my son Rex yesterday Kim I was in a rare bookstore I go back
[44:58.160 --> 45:01.720]  and get that almost bought him Kim scroll down for me I forgot I read that
[45:01.720 --> 45:04.880]  when I was a kid and then it just gets into divide and conquer how they
[45:04.880 --> 45:07.720]  balkanize different tribes off against each other you can see what they did in
[45:07.720 --> 45:14.520]  India right there or they didn't Pakistan this is a public operation they're
[45:14.520 --> 45:20.040]  gonna run a great game on us here the drug war is a great game you ship most
[45:20.040 --> 45:24.560]  the drugs in you then control the big crime gangs you shut down the small
[45:24.560 --> 45:28.800]  ones you corrupt the police and you imprison the general population who
[45:28.800 --> 45:32.920]  dares use the drugs for being so stupid and then you put them in private
[45:32.920 --> 45:38.440]  prisons competing with the rest of the economy lowering wages so only drugs is
[45:38.440 --> 45:44.480]  the economy oh how did the British take down China I forgot the opium wars
[45:44.480 --> 45:52.720]  which is even pre-great game but is great game I mean does anyone really

[54:22.000 --> 54:29.520]  police topic it's so transparent even former deputy director of the FBI has
[54:29.520 --> 54:33.120]  come out and said that the White House and the Justice Department are
[54:33.120 --> 54:37.920]  responsible for promoting this narrative it's so transparent it's almost like
[54:37.920 --> 54:42.600]  there's a civil war in the government as well Obama has the lowest approval

[54:57.920 --> 55:02.680]  because they're still getting it all through what's your take on this John
[55:02.680 --> 55:09.040]  well you know Alex back in 1980 and when I was living in Michigan I lost my job
[55:09.040 --> 55:12.840]  at Chrysler's and I had to take a job working up for a security company
[55:12.840 --> 55:17.440]  driving a patrol car and I had to work with a lot of a lot of police and by
[55:17.440 --> 55:20.360]  and large most of them treated me good and I didn't have no problem but once a
[55:20.360 --> 55:23.760]  while one of them we get up in my face and start screaming calling me a pretend
[55:23.760 --> 55:28.160]  to cop at what the hell I was doing there and it was all I could do to hold my
[55:28.160 --> 55:32.120]  temper you know that uh but what I'm saying is a lot of cops are their own
[55:32.120 --> 55:38.120]  worst enemy you know just there is an extreme arrogance in a minority of them
[55:38.120 --> 55:43.000]  and the police should absolutely route that out or it's going to allow the
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.960]  globalists to scapegoat them into an explosive civil war I mean do you agree
[55:47.960 --> 55:52.360]  with my point that the establishment the George Soros's want the cops to get the
[55:52.360 --> 55:56.600]  blame for everything instead of the system well they want to destroy the
[55:56.600 --> 55:59.640]  police period that's you know they want to put their police in there they're
[55:59.640 --> 56:02.880]  probably bringing from overseas or something you know did it they want to
[56:02.880 --> 56:06.880]  turn on our cop that's part of the game plan you know exactly so how do we
[56:06.880 --> 56:11.600]  navigate this I don't know but you got all these communist agitators out here
[56:11.600 --> 56:14.800]  formatting all this stuff I mean they've they've been there since the 1960s and
[56:14.800 --> 56:19.280]  that and people go to have to realize that these cause and all this unrest and
[56:19.280 --> 56:23.360]  uh and they want they want a revolution that's you know they want to be a
[56:23.360 --> 56:28.680]  note of linen or another of the crops here whatever you know that's it it's a
[56:28.680 --> 56:32.920]  great game I mean British intelligence I can't believe that even on Wikipedia
[56:32.920 --> 56:39.720]  they have links to major universities they admit that the British help bring
[56:39.720 --> 56:45.960]  down Russia putting the communist in that is so hardcore cold-blooded and then
[56:45.960 --> 56:50.040]  and then the CIA and British intelligence put Mao in that just lets you know
[56:50.040 --> 56:54.240]  who's running the show I mean these people are evil and they now want to
[56:54.240 --> 56:58.480]  finally bring down what's left of America and I just hope we're not stupid
[56:58.480 --> 57:03.160]  enough to go along with it good to hear from you John Bill in Michigan first
[57:03.160 --> 57:09.720]  timer on the police topic so what do you think's happening yes Alex your last
[57:09.720 --> 57:15.440]  caller here in Michigan he hit the nail right on the head and I disagree with
[57:15.440 --> 57:19.080]  these people just shooting you know our police officers there is a lot of good
[57:19.080 --> 57:24.120]  ones out there but there's also a lot of them that are out of control and here in
[57:24.120 --> 57:31.080]  Michigan I blame our governor Ricky Bloomberg Snyder you know we have all
[57:31.080 --> 57:37.280]  these oh like drunk driving stings and seatbelt stings and I mean they're
[57:37.280 --> 57:40.760]  pulling you over in the middle of day for a burned out headlight oh yeah it's
[57:40.760 --> 57:47.040]  total police state revenue generation totally federalized predatory and it's
[57:47.040 --> 57:51.880]  out of control it is you know and I mean but what are what I mean shooting police
[57:51.880 --> 57:56.480]  officers isn't our solution but us citizens you know I mean are we just
[57:56.480 --> 58:00.720]  out here for pray for them or you know well the argument is you need to fall
[58:00.720 --> 58:04.800]  the law I mean half the Americans can't even pay for their inspection sticker
[58:04.800 --> 58:09.320]  now he's supposed to walk to work I mean the country is falling apart and it
[58:09.320 --> 58:13.400]  seems like the worst the economy the more tickets they're writing meanwhile
[58:13.400 --> 58:18.600]  Google and General Electric or tax exempt and I pay 43% tax it's just
[58:18.600 --> 58:24.600]  totally screwed up good to hear from you Mike in New York if that's the Mike

[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:13.160]  elite not the people versus the police Richard Watkins Jay says won't be a
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.480]  race war will be a class war though yeah but they're kicking it off racially and
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:22.000]  then saying the police are where you should vent your class war anger I mean
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:31.400]  this is just pure pure Bolshevik type garbage playbook so that's some of the
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:37.440]  comments here D hacker 110 says I personally think it's too late to stop
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.000]  it from happening people are still looking at the small things and not the
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:48.600]  big picture real patriot news says do you think it would be a good idea for
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.400]  communities to come together and spread the truth about the system and speak
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:58.680]  out absolutely people tweeted at real Alex Jones on Twitter so that's what
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.120]  this comes down to more of those comments coming up let's get a call in
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:11.360]  right now let's go to Jacob in Utah you're on the air yes yeah Alex Jacob a
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:18.200]  long-time listener and multiple survivor with your prison planet and thank
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:24.800]  you and you know I I understand all your points now but you're missing the
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:30.160]  whole thing about this is about justice Alex and the system has been set up so
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:35.000]  there is no justice I mean when you have your own kids killed then you can start
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.400]  evaluating a lot different than what I'm hearing you talk about no I hear you and
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.640]  God forbid that that ever happened I see on the screen you say that your daughter
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:47.160]  was killed tell us about that my dog my daughter was killed she was unarmed no
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:51.440]  warrant no criminal record she was gunned down by US Marshals shot in the
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:57.840]  back of the hat and that was January 9th in Salt Lake City but it wasn't by the
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:03.600]  Salt Lake City police and by federal Marshals Jaycat which is the criminal
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.480]  apprehension team were they on a drug raid or something or a warrant service
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:15.120]  no no it was she was driving in her car and unmarked cars come up rammed her
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.120]  head on another cop coming right up behind her and shot her in the back they
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:22.080]  had before she could even know what was happening you know I see these type of
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:26.560]  bizarre cases all the time and now the FBI famously executed that guy in
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:32.440]  Florida when he was reportedly bound it's best I mean do you have any idea why
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:38.440]  they did this to her well you know Alex you know I was not totally aware of
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:42.560]  everything was going on for my daughter was killed you know God forbid that
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.600]  happens to anybody else but if you want reality when when your kid gets killed
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.520]  you got reality then you start seeing all the other things especially here in
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:59.280]  Utah I mean Daniel Willard was killed at November 7th in 19 I mean 2012 by West
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.240]  Valley police and she went and it was ruled unjustified no I know out by the
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:09.400]  Bundy Ranch there was like a 15 year old on a bicycle last year and they just
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:14.160]  shot him off the bicycle no weapon I know it's this extinct of training video
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.080]  game kill kill kill and a lot of police departments are actually removing that
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.120]  training it's like well we keep cops alive well then you shoot some guy that
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:25.520]  pulls his cell phone out I mean it's getting to where they're like fast
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:34.560]  drawing villains or gunfighters and then but there is a problem I hear what
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:39.160]  you're saying the globalists gave them the training gave them the weapons gave
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:44.280]  them the tanks but I really want to hear from you when we come back I want you

[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:55.440]  her car I wonder about the cost I see cops all the time will just ram your
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.520]  car even if you're not fleeing the government's Department of Homeland
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:04.320]  Security is buying up loads of ammo at the same time the restricting

[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:27.920]  here from the front line from the front lines of the information war it's
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:53.840]  Alex Jones right and wrong and world government is openly being announced by
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:58.280]  private megacorporations exempt from taxes that have diplomatic immunity and
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:03.760]  all over the planet the way they control nations is using sociologists to come in
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:11.780]  and play off religious racial ethnic differences against each other the
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:17.520]  Romans did it the British did it it's the great game and with my audience on
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:23.240]  info wars dot com and present planet dot com and on YouTube you're hearing the
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.680]  majority of callers that have called in today I'm gonna try to move quick now
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:33.000]  and cycle through a bunch of them so we can get a accurate image here hey I
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.960]  don't want to go up just kill random cops but they killed my daughter or they
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.520]  beat me up or all they do is run checkpoints that are illegal so you
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.480]  see as the police become globalized because they are already federalized
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:49.960]  and the feds have been occupied and taken over under UNESCO treaty our police
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:54.440]  follow UN rules the average cop doesn't know that as this
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:59.120]  immunization as the UN calls it takes place you will see us against them
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:04.440]  mentality and the system circling the wagons against the people so that the
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:09.320]  people aren't able to take over the system and restore the Republic so they
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.600]  are trying to cause a race war civil war here are some of the headlines I want
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:17.040]  right back to your calls police departments on alert after cop killings
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:23.240]  in New York tensions between police and mayor de Blasio boil over after
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:28.560]  killings sharped in our city is hurting from these vicious murders of two NYPD
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:33.840]  officers when he's been helping promote all this Obama's propaganda push people
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.200]  to hate the police Giuliani says a widening rip between the New York mayor
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:44.800]  and the New York city police is savagely ripped open
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:50.640]  got another article here or a deputy FBI director retired has come out and said
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:54.680]  that the the White House and Justice Department is trying to cause civil
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:11:05.920]  unrest killings of two New York city officers triggers backlash Howard
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:11.000]  Safer anti-police rhetoric unlike anything I've seen in 45 years and it's
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.960]  being pushed by the media now does that mean that the police in many areas
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:22.160]  aren't out of control I'm the expert on that I've made four films written books
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:28.920]  on it predicted all of this but there's a difference between being mad about what
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.920]  the general police are being turned into and randomly blaming individual police
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:41.640]  officers are their families it's very simple and they want to get us fighting
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:46.600]  with each other so how do we navigate this is the question and I'm hearing
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:50.880]  from listeners like Jacob who I held over he said federal marshals this
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:57.040]  January killed her unarmed shot her in the back of the head if you give us her
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.480]  name we can look it up and pull up the news articles there I know it's hard for
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:04.000]  you probably talk about but I do see the videos from choppers and dash cams
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.040]  where someone be unarmed and a cop just shoots you it's like the black team who
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:13.600]  was handcuffed on the dart platform and they pull the gun out he just shoots
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:19.600]  him in the back and then they lied and said he beat up the cops so they shot
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:24.560]  him and then the video came out so they did try to cover that up very creepy and
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:32.240]  the police officer only got like two years in jail and then they sent us
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:36.400]  subpoenas for people threatening the cop on my website on info wars on the
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:42.800]  comments and they actually went and prosecuted multiple people around the
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:47.800]  country who are on my website folks they were all over YouTube saying the same
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.800]  thing why was it my website because we had it on our servers and it was a way
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:55.580]  to come snooping around here so you know what we have our comments down on
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:00.840]  discus for two years they're not here you can take your subpoenas over to
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:06.200]  discus or whoever else you have no reason to come around here so I've lived
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:10.400]  through this I've seen it
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:16.440]  Serpico said that every other cop in the narcotics unit in New York was dealing
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:20.040]  drugs because they'd kill you if you didn't go along with it so is the New
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:30.640]  York PD corrupt famously but at the same time we need we need to get Serpico
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:35.920]  back on he's been on twice I I absolutely want Serpico on you get
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.880]  John Bounds well originally got him and we were gonna fly him down here into a
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.640]  documentary but the point is I just want to get him on about this right now
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:50.520]  Frank Serpico's a listener so he shouldn't be hard to get on
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:56.480]  we're gonna go back to your phone calls right now but for me this is the big
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.040]  issue later in the hour I'm gonna get a North Korea threat and strikes on the
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.600]  US I'm at hacking claims AP Saudi oil chief no conspiracy behind oil prices
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:08.840]  Fox investigation CDC may be hiding Ebola cases that was yesterday on Fox
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:13.400]  Sunday that's all coming up but right now let's go back to your phone calls
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:18.280]  Jacob tell the story about your daughter what was the investigation I mean I
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:22.720]  don't know her name I haven't seen your case but I do see similar cases where
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.520]  these cops are so trigger happy it's like taking somebody deer hunting for the
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:31.680]  first time and they get buck fever and they shoot a cow 400 yards away on
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:35.320]  somebody else's property I mean that is a routine occurrence and I think you got
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:41.720]  a lot of people like that joining police forces I mean I'll be honest twice I've
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:44.200]  seen I like the office police department average of pretty nice people and
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.880]  follow the Constitution to a certain extent but I've seen the awesome police
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:52.040]  cadets training at deep eddy swimming pool when I was doing laps there last
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:58.640]  year and I saw them also doing push-ups at another park in some physical and I'm
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:05.040]  I mean I'm not in shape and I can swim two miles in 65 degrees 70 degree water
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:10.160]  do it all the time but I wouldn't call myself in shape I'm 40 years old I can
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:22.760]  do I can do 400 500 push-ups a couple months ago I did 500 took an hour and a
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:27.640]  half to do them but I did 500 my son wanted to see how many I could do these
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:32.840]  cops could hardly do 20 push-ups or they were cadets and let me tell you I don't
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.960]  know who these departments are trying to hire but I guess they're saying well
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.120]  nobody wants to be a cop I think that's also part of it they're all over the
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:42.680]  country they're hiring a lot of people I'm not trying to be stereotypical here
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:49.360]  but a lot of times it's well everybody knows you who to be scared of with
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:53.840]  police and in my experience it's women and I'm not saying there aren't good
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:58.040]  women police officers but I think they feel outgunned and outmuscled and so
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:03.960]  they get in your face real fast and it's kind of a Napoleon complex and maybe I
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.920]  got a Napoleon complex I mean I'm 511 never thought of myself as a little guy
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:11.600]  but I do have a thing where like if some guys a lot bigger than me it's like a
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.800]  chihuahua want to find a German Shepherd but you don't need people that have real
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:20.200]  problems out there abusing the public and then having the system cover its butt
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:28.040]  because as Einstein said for every action there is an opposite I don't even
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:35.040]  know we had video of them training there is an opposite and equal reaction so if
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:38.480]  the police get militarized and start killing a bunch of people some who
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.880]  deserve it some who don't people are gonna start lashing out and it's just
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:48.920]  you're not gonna win the British Empire couldn't beat the American people we
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:54.600]  couldn't beat the Vietnamese we couldn't beat the Iraqis the Patriot
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.840]  movement America is probably I'm gonna skip this network break as I'm going to
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:07.920]  call 30 times 50 times stronger than the Iraqi fighters just in numbers alone the
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:17.800]  training I mean really and they're training all of these cadets to just
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:22.640]  gear up and have this big war and I guess you want to be soldiers and I guess
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.880]  you want to fight the American people well if that's what you want that's what
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.280]  you're gonna get Jacob in Utah finish the story about your dear daughter I mean
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:34.720]  give us some of the details well my daughter is my only child so you know
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.880]  the reality of that is then you know you have your whole life you build up that
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:42.920]  bought houses put you know everything who do you give it to but you know there's
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:48.440]  been more grievous killings or murders than just my daughter as I as I've
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:53.040]  become in touch with the whole community of people have had their children
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:58.760]  killed across this country Facebook's a great place to find it all but you know
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:05.400]  in Utah the police chief of Salt Lake City told me that I should sue the cops
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.400]  not for any all their crimes in that that's for their tactics and level of
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:14.040]  force and this is the problem is the whole system is corrupt I've been for
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:19.040]  23 months I try to get my grandma reports my four-year request and finally I
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:24.440]  get them one month before I'm supposed to file a lawsuit and you know and the
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:29.200]  whole thing I mean Daniel Willard it was killed in West Valley the DA ruled
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:34.460]  unjustified well we he charges the police officer takes into the thing and
[01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:39.800]  the judge throws it out but we caught the judge I mean caught the cops lying
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:45.440]  about the everything and the DA tried to even appeal it with the Attorney
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:50.320]  General in Utah and he still wouldn't appeal it and it's the system of the
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:56.640]  judges the DA that it's not only the cops I mean I hate to say there is well
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:01.040]  I mean I hate to say there's no good cops but in a way there isn't any good
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:06.280]  cops don't understand we're showing the case of the unarmed woman was that your
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:11.080]  daughter or was it another well well that was Daniel Willard was not my
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.400]  daughter but I know isn't her family now well if you don't mind tell us your
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.680]  name tell us your name and we'll look into your daughter's case it was her
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:23.360]  name Kelly Simon Kelly Simon and and why did they pull her over and shoot her
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:29.920]  in the back did she was involved in the harm robbery but they had no proof they
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:35.240]  had that they actually the whole thing is it doesn't even matter what they
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:39.920]  suspect they can it's they can shoot first and ask questions later they don't
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:43.480]  have to have any reason I see the headline father seeks answers and
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:47.120]  daughter's fatal shooting in robbery case Scott Simons is not sure why police
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:52.400]  believe slain woman committed a series of robberies and we'll click and see an
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:55.840]  image of your daughter there on screen over there on the right hand side as
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:01.600]  you can click on that image and we can see his daughter well I tell you it's
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:08.200]  certainly scary and we'll we'll try to look into that I just can't even imagine
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:20.600]  that I personally know in my family it was my aunt Pat's deceased husband she
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:28.240]  had one husband I was related the point is is that my aunt Pat's husband daughter
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:35.640]  was schizophrenic this is like 20 years ago and was freaking out unarmed and they
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:42.040]  called the Houston police neighbors did they just came and shot her and so the
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:49.520]  issue is don't call the police unless it's a real emergency because it can go
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:53.840]  really bad especially now with the kill first ask questions later mentality I'm
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.960]  so sorry for your daughter Jacob God bless you we're gonna move quick now
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.560]  through calls let's talk to Mike in New York thanks for holding her on the
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:06.840]  air good day brother how are you I'm all right thanks for calling you bet um well
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:11.760]  the topic of my conversation I know you're leading to police but you know I
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:17.960]  think Rand Paul came closest to open the doors open the light when he said even
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:23.360]  in fact I didn't know I mean this Gardner was a father of four or six and
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:29.080]  he's out in the afternoon and he's out selling cigarettes and they go you don't
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:32.680]  have a permit so that's why they'd arrest him over and over again and they
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:36.840]  choked him to death and in legal choke hold they pin his arm under him so he
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:41.400]  can't put his arm back behind him and they kill him and that is a miscarriage
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:46.640]  of justice but you don't then go shoot two cops and cold blood as a counter to
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:55.040]  that absolutely so so what do we do then what do we do though well you can try to
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:01.440]  fight it but you know it's becoming so frustrating today I had an innuendo thrown
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:06.080]  at me through our federal social security program I've been disabled for a
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:11.440]  little over a year and they caught my benefits for another fact I just realized
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:17.560]  in the last few months is that the money that they give you plus any other
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:22.320]  assets that you have in other words I'm a retired or disabled from the
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:31.000]  landscape business so my trucks that I have well they call one day and they
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.160]  tell me well what do you have asked me I said well I've got an old landscape
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:41.880]  truck 1993 22 23 years old how much is it worth I said I don't know okay we're
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:48.080]  gonna do your favor we'll list it as $1,200 then all of a sudden between the
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:52.000]  money I have in my checking account that they gave me I'm trying to pay my taxes
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.920]  which I don't seem to understand that you can only pay a quarterly and they
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:03.320]  tack on a valuation of my truck which brings me over to here's the fact 2,000
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:08.440]  hour limit on your assets or else you're disqualified no I hear you what's
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:14.040]  happening is they're raising taxes and to the level of where the average person
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:19.360]  can't pay them and people are going under the poverty line and the government
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:24.640]  has created such massive debts that it's impossible to pay back that's what
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:28.760]  we're talking about the demographic cliff good to hear from you interesting
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:33.480]  points James in Georgia you're on the air can we stop the Civil War do you
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:40.920]  disagree that the Justice Department is not trying to start civil unrest my
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:44.760]  name is James I'm on first-time caller and I wanted to tell you about some
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:49.560]  incidents that I had down here in Columbus Georgia but before you go to a
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:53.400]  next caller I'm really the only reason I'm really calling and getting involved
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:59.600]  with this is a lot to be more of a patriot to fix problems and I have some
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:05.400]  ideas that could be solutions maybe to we're not creating your call you're on
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:11.760]  air right now go ahead right well I'll start out by just telling you of an
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:19.260]  incident with the police a couple years ago I met a guy he's Mexican and he
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:23.080]  says he's an American citizen his sister's in the army and he had she had
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:28.360]  moved here and at Fort Bennett next door to here and he had him and his son had
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:32.000]  moved over here with them and they were look he's a sort of do-it-all kind of
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.160]  guy he knows fairly well you know pretty good English but he never had an idea
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.440]  or anything and well I live with my mother and my grandmother that are sick
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:45.280]  so what I'm having him over to do extra jobs around the house and you know to
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:50.720]  help him makes a little extra money and on well one day I'm taking him home and
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:56.920]  I'm stopped by the bank and he had been drinking he started drinking so I was
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:02.120]  gonna take him home and I stopped by the bank I wanted to get out and get some
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:07.360]  money out of ATM when I get out he takes off with my mother's car and I'm
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:12.880]  standing at the bank so that right next door is a Wendy's and I call that there
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:16.120]  was a dump truck dumping thing and I went over there and use his cell phone
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:21.040]  and called the police but the police came right away and drove me down to my
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.800]  house and took all the reports of what happened him taking off from my car and
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:30.680]  all and so they're like okay we'll see if what we could do to try to find your
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:34.760]  car and him and everything well that you know that was probably 11 30 12 at night
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:39.800]  well then we get a knock on the door about 3 30 in the morning and it's the
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:44.360]  same officer so he comes in and says I need to do some more on the report that
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:50.480]  we found your car well actually he says they found the car with with the guy and
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:55.600]  he says that well this guy I'm not gonna name his name on there but this guy
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:01.200]  says that he's my friend and so the cop is arguing with me well you shouldn't
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:06.520]  press charges on your friend and I said I barely know this guy he stole the car
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:11.200]  well I want to press charges and he refused to press charges well you know
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:14.680]  why that's because the guy's illegal and the police have been told by the
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:20.480]  judges who run everything that you are just not to charge them they're basically
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:25.080]  above the law they even let serial killers out who's you know killed over
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:31.520]  and over again arsonist you name it so long story short how did it end well
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.520]  before right after that he's going over and he's saying well he says this and I
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.560]  said well that's not true and he said he kept saying why I'm getting conflict in
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:44.720]  stories so I said are you calling me a liar and that was all it took he jumped
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:47.920]  up get on the floor get on right in front of my mother in our kitchen while
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:52.960]  I'm in my boxers in my underwear and I'm disabled and I stand up immediately
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:57.320]  I'm not able to just jump on the floor so I put my hands on the table get on
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:02.360]  the floor get on place I estimated 26 times he tased me all right he tased me
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.560]  in the head and the face multiple times in the chest kidneys he fell down trying
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:12.480]  to do this tasing me in the ankles no I know what happens is it's all about you
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:16.160]  must follow my order absolutely I'm God and the minute you don't you've
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:20.640]  committed this huge crime don't even talk to me I appreciate your call that's
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:24.240]  why people are really upset with the police and tasers admittedly have
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:29.920]  killed so many people from heart attacks a couple years ago they massively
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:36.560]  boosted the power of tasers saying they weren't powerful enough and you hit
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:40.200]  somebody in the chest I mean you can kill them they're even killing young people
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:49.040]  with them so it's not non-lethal it's less lethal and for every action there's
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:53.440]  an opposite an equal reaction and that's what the new world order our
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:58.600]  masters of is playing all of this using a taser on an eight-year-old mom
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:06.560]  sues police city she and in it's just nuts let's go ahead and talk to Damien
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:13.880]  and Arizona you're on the air and I don't know go ahead yeah I want to talk
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:17.640]  about the concept of a government police in the first place I think people are
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:21.840]  confused because 99% of this country is already secured any security concerns
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.560]  are already secured by individuals and private entities that's right private
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:29.640]  citizens with their guns are the answer and also there's a lot of
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:33.360]  constitutional issues on this cops are unconstitutional period local and
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:38.360]  federal there is no such thing as is they're already a standing army because
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:42.200]  there were the same bdu that the same rate of rules of engagement that the same
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.440]  command fire so this whole this whole binary and now the police are being put
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:51.800]  on the same FEMA radio system with the same codes I mean cities are allowed to
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:56.200]  hire their own police your sheriffs you know are elected by the citizens but
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:00.440]  you're right that the way the police stand now the way they stand their quote
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:05.040]  forces up or their troops up they are in their own words a paramilitary
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:10.760]  domestic force there's no amount of training that you're gonna do to fix it
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:13.640]  they're already part of the system you say you know people against system
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:17.480]  well cops are part of the system let me ask you this and we're gonna go break it
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:22.880]  I want you to answer this day when we come back sure there's a problem I've
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:30.560]  been talking about it for 20 years how then is MSNBC CNN and Al Sharpton
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:35.400]  promoting demonizing the police when the system is the group that actually
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:40.520]  turned them into this so see how do you then navigate the fact that they want
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:45.360]  us fighting with them instead of reforming it see the very feds that are
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:50.800]  causing this are posing as the saviors we're on the March the empires on the
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:56.840]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:30.440]  well you're hearing it from our listeners or the listeners that are able to
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:38.120]  call in they've got a lot of horror stories from the police but they still
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:48.280]  want to try to work it out and fix things I personally have had pretty much
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:57.080]  nothing but good experiences with the Austin police except for one time when
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:01.360]  they try to violate my first amendment this is like eight nine years ago when
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:05.960]  I was protesting governor Perry they were getting riot police ready we were
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:10.400]  peacefully protesting they'd already lost a whole bunch of lawsuits and I kind
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:15.040]  of blew up at them the videos online they were very restrained but it didn't
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:18.440]  mean I got mad they're like saying no you have no first amendment I just was
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:27.280]  yelling at this cop because he had come over the statesman was doing an
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:31.480]  article San Antonio newspaper was doing article follow me around there were two
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:37.120]  reporters there and the cop came over and he said yeah you can protest and they
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:41.120]  came over like an hour later said I never said you you can protest right in
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:44.720]  front of the newspaper even though they had heard him and written it down and I
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:49.160]  just blew up I said man you are a liar and I think that's what makes people
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:54.640]  more mad than anything is the lying and the fact that so many departments train
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:35:00.320]  police how to lie on the stand that's come out but I just like the fact that
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:06.640]  I've been attacked by groups of rednecks I don't look at somebody wearing a cowboy
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:09.120]  hat and think they're gonna attack me or I've been attacked by black folks who
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:12.360]  were racist I don't look at black people and say oh they're black so they're
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:16.280]  gonna attack me I don't look at cops and think because I've been around bad cops
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:22.920]  they're all bad I'm trying to change the culture I'm trying to wake them up I'm
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:28.920]  trying to actually reach out and have serious discussions that have an effect
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:35.280]  instead of just causing more division the globalists have set up their police
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:39.240]  state they've militarized them now they want us to have a war with each other
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:42.960]  you could say at some levels hey you guys are all dressed up ready for war
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:53.880]  okay you're gonna get one but that plays into the George Soros hands the
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:59.080]  Democratic Party is financing these rabble rousers and provocateurs and
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:05.120]  destabilizers and then making them heroes on the news when they demonize
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:10.120]  legitimate demonstrations and free speech I mean it's a very clear program
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:14.160]  that's taking place there's not a doubt in my mind that I'm right about this so
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:17.640]  I'm asking listeners do you think I'm right you think I'm wrong we could have
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:24.000]  your bad cop stories all day and that's fine I could play videos every day a
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.720]  police doing absolutely horrible things and covering it up I could also play
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:34.000]  video every day a police doing heroic good things and doing the right thing
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.160]  we try to have a balance of it all because here's the deal I don't want to
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:44.480]  just play in to the paradigm there's another reason dinosaur media has jumped
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:49.720]  on the hate the police bandwagon that's because their ratings are flagging and
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:58.600]  they know it's popular to bash the police just mindlessly but what police
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:04.200]  are you talking about the feds who are the minders over the local police in
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:08.280]  their minds when the feds get away with executing people in cold blood when
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:13.080]  they're handcuffed and don't get in trouble getting burning down the Waco
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:18.600]  branch divisions killing the kids and I don't want to just sit here and out of
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:24.120]  hand demonize the FBI either because that plays into this whole mentality of
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:27.880]  well we're being attacked we might as well just circle the ranks and do whatever
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:33.280]  the brass says when the brass are the bad guys doesn't mean all the brass are
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:39.400]  bad guys but when you get into the feds I mean the attorney general is super
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:45.280]  evil and has been caught in multiple false flags and persecuting gun owners
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:50.800]  veterans and Christians with the IRS and hadn't gotten trouble
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:38:04.280]  when Joe Stack flew his airplane into the IRS building and killed two IRS
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:09.440]  employees even though the IRS is unconstitutional abuses people it's
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:18.080]  extra judicial I don't wish them any harm physically but my goodness the IRS
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.720]  director all of them came for the press conference to grandstand and look like
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:28.200]  victims aren't they really the people that run the criminal show but not even
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:32.720]  them above them I mean do you know it's the private Federal Reserve that gets
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:37.080]  all that money see I want to repeal the Federal Reserve and we're very close to
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:43.720]  it and I want to win the war intellectually and we are starting to win
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:47.560]  that's why they're going to start a race war and a war with the police so they
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:50.160]  can say oh we can't allow demonstrations anymore look what it did in
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:59.800]  2015 2014 oh we can't allow I mean the media already tries every day multiple
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:04.520]  times a week to tie Alex Jones and info wars calm to violence when we're the
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:09.160]  opposite the Liberty movements being demonized right now by Time magazine
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:14.760]  saying right-wing militias are the real threat to cops daily caller the secret
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:23.080]  world of extremist militias and you go on to these reports guess who's in them
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:30.480]  yours truly and they teach police across the country that Alex Jones basically
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:37.760]  wants you dead so that they can try to shut us down later just like they blamed
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.080]  Oklahoma City on Rush Limbaugh
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:49.320]  Rush Limbaugh had nothing to do with Oklahoma City ladies and gentlemen talk
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:52.840]  radio and free speech and nothing to do with it and that was a federal operation
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:57.040]  just like fast and furious oh how far we've come you talk about this stuff
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:00.680]  10 years ago like Billy Corgan said around the dinner table people would
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:04.160]  laugh at you if you talked about the New World Order and conspiracy you told the
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:09.080]  Federal Reserve was private they laugh at you now people don't laugh they might
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:11.280]  not want to hear about it and say there's nothing we can do about it but
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:17.280]  they know it's real the globalist are losing the info war every month we can
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:22.040]  keep them from not kicking off a civil war our big fat juicy false flag to
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:30.680]  blame on us they're capable of anything I want to get into North Korea threatening
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:34.000]  to blow up the White House tied right into the movies that have noticed how
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.360]  what North Korea says dovetails with Hollywood because both our authoritarian
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:42.440]  regime needs an outside threat to take freedom and North Korea and Kim Jong
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:46.600]  on he likes Dennis Rodman coming to visit him do you think he likes movies
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:52.640]  being made about him it's well known this is propping North Korea up and they
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:41:02.920]  love it North Korea couldn't hack their way out of a two plus two equals four
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:06.680]  equation they didn't attack they didn't steal that info and there's evidence to
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:12.040]  that now emerging and they've denied it but shot their mouths off more about how
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:17.880]  they'll blow up the whole US it's not North Korea that disappeared nuke warheads
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:24.320]  out of Dias Air Force Base last year all right Damien go ahead and finish your
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:29.000]  point that you were getting into go ahead I like to reply directly reply your
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.440]  media in there the leftist media narrative actually to me that's sort of
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.240]  same thing as blaming the gun instead of the shooter there are only two types of
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:41.320]  people where science works most effectively as one is academically smart
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:46.400]  and two is really dumb because academically smart they understand the
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:49.520]  outbreak on the system so if they believe the system they think it works on
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:52.600]  behalf of them so if they rearticulate it back they think it's actually working
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:55.720]  on behalf of them stupid obviously you get you know confused so the whole thing
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:01.960]  about this is anything is inciting a riot I mean the only person guilty is the
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:05.760]  person in acting it however the thoughts come into his head and you know
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.280]  whatever the nature of his mind was before he got all this you know media
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:14.480]  echo chamber that's the size of the issue so this whole notion of I mean 20
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:18.000]  years you've been articulating very eloquently how the system the police
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.760]  state the Federal Reserve all these larger constructs are responsible well
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:26.680]  the state is a fiction without you know its actors and the commissar and who are
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:30.200]  the enforcer class it is the enforcer class there's a reason why will Greg who
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:34.640]  used to be with John Birch Society left John Birch Society because of their
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.760]  constant stance on you know their police you know function fundraiser I'm like are
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:42.960]  you kidding me you guys are raising money for the enforcer class the politicians
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:47.880]  the corporates have no power without the enforcer class so it's time to repeal the
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:52.040]  government the notion of government police not just repeal the Fed you need
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:57.320]  to repeal that notion permanently this is I mean you could you can't fix in
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:01.720]  occupation that perpetually you know attracts the most psychotic of a society
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:05.440]  there's like 10% that are always gonna be psychopathic and that's who it
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:09.040]  attracts for a reason because they could well it is a it is a historical fact
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:15.760]  that the uniform attracts psychopaths control freaks it also attracts good
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:21.040]  people but yeah a good 5-10% of police I think is a conservative number are
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:30.360]  deranged masochists who are on power trips and those are the type that end up
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:34.960]  in many departments rising up to the ranks now smart cities smart counties
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:40.120]  want good stable prosperity and won't put up with that and so I mean I think it
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:45.200]  varies department to department all I'm saying is how do you deal with the
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:50.680]  paradox that we get a lot of great information from local police departments
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:55.360]  a lot of great information the military because they're the ones in there doing
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:02.240]  it they know how real this is a lot more than even I do and so it's like a
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:06.640]  paradox it's our problem but it's also part of the solution I know we've got a
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:10.320]  big giant imperial military that they're trying to use against us but
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:15.200]  shouldn't we then reach out to them and educate them about the larger plan instead
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:19.160]  of just saying they're the enemy I mean how do you navigate that because as Ron
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:25.160]  Paul said it would take decades to wean us off of this and reform this I'm
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:29.800]  saying we've come to the point now where they want to go ahead and start a civil
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:35.080]  war so I get your larger point I think you're absolutely right but how do we
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:40.520]  get from here to there when the system isn't even looking at that it's going
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:45.080]  to start a civil war I'm just trying to stop that
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:48.560]  well house you know I always say you know if you're not doing anything now
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:53.480]  you're not going to do it when you know crap is a fan well the same cost they're
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:55.800]  the same I mean they're not doing anything about it now so what makes you
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:00.040]  think they're gonna suddenly change we're histories at an entropy point you
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:03.000]  know we're at that precipice if they haven't done anything up to now they're
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.960]  starting they're gonna do anything when it happens and by then they'll just be
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:09.240]  you know too busy taking care of their own so we're on the same boat the
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:12.320]  system's failing they're just part of the like last phase of a existing system
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:16.160]  that's gonna go away so I don't see the point in fixing him or reforming him I
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:20.080]  mean they're all listening to you because they already realized something's up
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:23.560]  anyway so I don't see the point of reforming they're they've been tuning
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:25.720]  into you anyway you know and these are the same guys giving you the
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:29.240]  information and you've been talking to exact same way anyway so I don't there's
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:33.120]  no point in informing them they need to come to our side and they're gonna it's
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:38.120]  gonna happen anyway because fissures on that trajectory an amazing call Damien
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:49.120]  wow he really let it out didn't he the system is designed to fail and they plan
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:55.680]  to in the crisis bring in a total police state I'm trying to stop the vicious
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:46:03.360]  crash landing I want a controlled sustainable survivable landing there
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:08.520]  have been so many revolutions of ideas that have succeeded and been nonviolent
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:13.680]  but they're not called revolutions they're called Renaissance and so I want
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:19.280]  a Renaissance not a revolution and I think if we get past the dumb down you're
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:26.200]  either 100% for the cops and always back them or kill them and that's what it's
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:30.760]  turned into you either for killing the police and and burning down the police
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:38.520]  station or you are for backing them no matter what they do how about we back a
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:42.600]  constitutional role how about we promote a culture of liberty how about we
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:46.400]  explain the larger New World Order plan to get us at each other's throats and
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:54.400]  short circuit it then we can try to fix things but yes they've signed us on to a
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:47:00.560]  thousand of the 2000 quadrillion a little more than half of it it's not our
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:07.520]  debt it's not sustainable we're going down every major economist says it's
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:13.600]  inevitable but the question is how will it unfold how will the house of cards
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:21.400]  fall so I just don't have any macho desire for this to turn into a big nasty
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:28.960]  mess because I don't plan to try to run off to Switzerland and sit it out but
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:32.080]  maybe I should like Frank Serpicoe just go man you people just kill each other
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:40.160]  I'm out of here man it's so stupid and it's a plan and they've got us
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:44.320]  marching towards each other and then the media has me at the head of it in
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:52.480]  some plan to kill the police imagine that why do they want to shut me up and
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:56.560]  demonize me because I've got their number I know the plan you think the
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:01.600]  establishment likes the fact I'm up here laying out their plan every day very
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:07.240]  accurately I'm not on a power trip knowing all this stuff I wish everybody
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:14.240]  else knew it I wish we could beat this right now I'm gonna go to break and come

[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:33.640]  we see epic promotion of racial division of attacking the police by the
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:39.360]  very establishment media that has supported the police warping and mutating
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:46.240]  in many cases into what they are today and it's a kind of night of the long
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:53.000]  knives after Hitler took power he purged the paramilitary police force the SA
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:55:00.120]  that had brought him to power killed tens of thousands of them in one night and
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:10.480]  their leader Ernst Rome Hitler's boyfriend and that's where the police and
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:14.320]  military are going if they go along with this treason history is very very
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:20.520]  clear Daniel in Texas can we stop the Civil War no one's really answered my
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:24.640]  question on that front other than the last caller Damian he gave a very
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:29.440]  eloquent breakdown of that everybody just has stories about the police now
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:32.800]  horrible they are we don't screen your calls we're just taking them as they
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:37.200]  come this is what the public thinks and it just shocked me that when the cops
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:42.120]  got shot people were standing around going yay yay even if you hated the
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:47.720]  police you shouldn't support that and it shows kind of a soft disconnection to
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:54.040]  reality even if you hated someone you wouldn't be celebrating them dying it's
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:56:04.360]  bad luck I'm here to tell you the cops get run over in Denver people cheer it
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:09.080]  so it mean even if the police are demons in New York which I don't think you can
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:13.080]  say that across the board you've now turned into that as well I mean it's
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:16.400]  just it's sick to see us being played off against each other that's all I'm
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:25.280]  saying this is not how we build civilizations Daniel in Texas go ahead
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:30.840]  what's your take on all this oh Alex long-time listener first time caller
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:34.640]  thank you so much for all you do and you know my heart hurts for this country
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:37.720]  it's a spiritual and physical hurt you know when I read about that news on
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:42.120]  Saturday I mean I want I made me want to cry and just like you said in no way
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:46.600]  former fashion should those cops death be celebrated by anybody in this
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:51.480]  country we've got a huge moral and spiritual battle going on in this
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:55.640]  country you keep on asking what what it's going to take and you know I kind of
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:59.200]  like the approach to the civil rights movement I think it's what is going to
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:06.200]  have to take a massive media campaign broadcast meetings we've got to get this
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:10.960]  police state situation taken care of you know the old man being slammed to the
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:14.320]  ground the other day by the young police officer there's no way in the
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:20.000]  world anybody can justify that unless that man branched a weapon I just I
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.840]  don't get what it's going to take I mean why do people like me and you and your
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:29.920]  listeners care so much and others don't Alex why is that it's because they're
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:33.160]  watching television all day and just partying and even if it happens to them
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:35.600]  their neighbor doesn't care they don't care about their neighbor we're such a
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:43.080]  self-centered country that it has allowed corruption to grow well you know I
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:46.920]  will tell you this Alex it's you know I recently five years ago became a
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:52.160]  musician and it wasn't until I got into music that my mind started to open and
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:56.280]  I started realizing I really enjoy your Billy Corrigan interviews they're
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:58:01.240]  awesome I love that guy and if the spiritual aspect of music I say this all
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:06.880]  the time be it good or bad far outweighs its entertainment value and then
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:10.480]  that's what it took for me and I don't know what it's gonna take for my
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:16.120]  neighbors I mean I took in your advice and started my own show with you know on
[01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:21.120]  my online show and try to get my friends and in a lot of it you're just
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:26.620]  you're constantly bullied for caring and I don't get that part about it why
[01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:30.360]  nobody wants to question anything it's because they're raised in front of
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:35.640]  television sets the proto matrix and their spectators they don't know how to
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:39.480]  stand up they think it should work they don't get that's like breathing it's

[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:14.400]  get to the gate to try to leave but get in Ferris an order we just had a
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:19.040]  California cop that just got arrested sheriff he kicked the old man's cane out
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:25.000]  from underneath them and then a great perjury about it then he decided to have
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.400]  video evidence and they went back and arrested him it's kind of a amazing
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:39.840]  feat and yes I think the Civil War can't be stopped so it can or it can't be
[02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:45.120]  stopped can't it's the wheel of the motion too long just there's no way well
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:49.680]  we have four or five videos over the years I've seen of jail guards and
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:55.920]  police throwing quadriplegics out of wheelchairs and they'll tell them get
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:01.440]  up and they're like sir I am paralyzed neck down I said get up so they're
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:05.760]  supposed to grow new legs and they will throw them out or dump them out and
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:11.960]  then they'll break more bones because their bones are like or like soft like
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:18.080]  cheese or like rotten wood and then they'll defend it I told him get up I
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:22.240]  mean I have a friend who's a manager at Home Depot who got pulled over by a cop
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:27.760]  like it's like 10 years ago or more now the cops like a senior supervisor and he
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:31.800]  follow lawsuit I've seen the video of it and he says what are these and he goes
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:38.080]  sir these are my hand controls I'm paralyzed chest down and he says get out
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:41.520]  and he said all right my wife has to get my wheelchair out of the back he said
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:48.040]  no I said get out and he said well I can't so he drags him out beats me takes
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:52.000]  a real man to beat somebody up who's paralyzed let me tell you that I started
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:59.480]  putting quadriplegic sand in the UFC baby just just wham on the ground they
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:05.360]  be in a loincloth one of those guys can come in and beat them and it's just
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:13.680]  bizarre look at that boom so many videos of police pushing people out of their
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:16.320]  wheelchairs
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:21.520]  now granted some of those people are in wheelchairs that really don't need them
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:26.440]  but there are examples of quadriplegics in wheelchairs
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:30.440]  like that last one was an old man we're showing video of your radio listener
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:35.560]  any other points you want to make Alex yeah I'm how about the protesters right
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:40.720]  they're still you're either with us or against us can't even be on the fence
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:46.360]  no more you're the one thing they're protesting in there they're basically
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:52.080]  assimilated the process well they've taught the police that the safest thing
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:55.560]  for them to do is the minutes somebody I do exactly what they say jump on them
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:04:00.640]  and beat them up that might work at the time but it's going to create massive
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:07.360]  animosity and I think that's what we've seen shown here today so it's really
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:09.560]  worrisome I mean if you're a radio listener you ought to see the stuff
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:13.880]  they've been putting on TV but while we've been talking of police beating
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:18.800]  people up in wheelchairs and when their quadriplegics when they dump out on the
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:23.480]  ground their head'll bounce and their arms and legs are just laying there it's
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:27.760]  basically like beating up Stephen Hawking because he doesn't follow your
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:32.880]  orders and I've seen cases where they beat somebody up in a wheelchair and
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:38.640]  claim that it's because they assaulted them in fact in one case it's a guy with
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:45.480]  a motorized wheelchair he's paralyzed and he just drives by the cop on the
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:50.440]  sidewalk and grazes his shoe so the cop takes his as disrespectful so he beats
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:53.680]  him up there's not enough to knock you out of the wheelchair they got to beat
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:56.520]  you up once they do that we've all seen the footage of the woman walking on the
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:05:00.800]  street doesn't get out of the way for the cops for all of recorded history

[02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:27.320]  because there is a war on for your mind so the AP vote of top news editors around
[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:33.720]  the country says the story of police killing blacks unarmed blacks is the
[02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:38.720]  top news story of 2014 it's certainly the top story that the media has hyped
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:46.200]  you have to ask yourself why is that because you can have 20 million kids
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:50.360]  with autism from vaccines they're gonna cover that up or you can have the
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:52.880]  borders completely wide open they're gonna cover that up or you can have
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:57.640]  Obama acting as a dictator they're gonna cover that up why are they hyping this
[02:08:57.640 --> 02:09:03.560]  well it's because the public is really angry at the police there's massive
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:08.080]  mistrust in government across the board and so the establishment can get us
[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:13.440]  fighting with the police that's all the better it's not gonna reform them it's
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:19.080]  going to make them be a true standing army so they can then have the Civil
[02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:25.800]  War they want started by a race war weapons money and drugs report reveals
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:31.760]  FBI mishandles evidence throughout the agency because they're not accountable
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:35.520]  I've had dr. Frederick Whitehurst the former head of the FBI Crown Lab on many
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:41.960]  times and that place was a factory of frame-ups that's why you can't trust DNA
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:46.920]  evidence it can be planted or they can just give a false positive but there's
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:53.400]  all these forensic shows about how it's a hundred percent bulletproof
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:57.720]  truth is you got some really creepy weird people in charge of things and
[02:09:57.720 --> 02:10:01.440]  that's why this country's going to hell in a handbasket North Korea says Obama
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:07.440]  behind the interview leak gun control advocate urges kids to inform on parents
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:12.400]  turn in their firearms ISIS supporters praise attacks on French citizens
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:18.840]  Ferguson protester who met with DOJ taunts police with NYPD cop killer quote
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:25.120]  pigs in a blanket and says cop killer was a mother effing hero now he was a
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:28.760]  scumbag that killed his girlfriend in cold blood and then he went out and
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:32.600]  killed other people in cold blood just unbelievable it's war on the streets of
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:37.320]  America former FBI assistant director race provocations and cited violence
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:45.480]  towards police by the White House and DOJ so it's also a civil war they want
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:49.800]  to totally federalize local police and that's why the media is hyping this up
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:52.720]  as well there's a lot of different angles to this I want to take a call from
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:57.160]  Japan then I'm going to get into North Korea news I promise to get to in some
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:01.640]  of the others and then back to your calls but let's go ahead and talk to
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:07.080]  Wesley in Japan there's a slight delay so just go ahead and make your statement
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:13.720]  Wesley and then we'll let you go thanks for calling in from Japan yeah hey Alex
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:19.480]  yeah I just wanted to make a little parallel with the cops here and I'm
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:23.200]  sure you have some idea of it but the cops here they're just it's like two
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:25.960]  different worlds I don't even know how to explain it you have to be here to
[02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:30.560]  understand but they talk they treat you like people I mean they treat you like
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:34.920]  your people this is before I say anything I have a my dad is actually a
[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:40.240]  lieutenant on the Memphis police department so I'm I'm in the cop family I
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:44.560]  love cops I've always respected him but it's go it's crazy what's going on right
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:50.200]  now in America and and he's a great man he's a great Christian man who is the
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:54.560]  country and he does what he can to protect his people and that's what
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:58.160]  that's what's going on here you they don't have weapons here they don't they
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:02.680]  at most you'll see them with a stick but that that's even rare they don't carry
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:06.720]  weapons they don't care anything they today just for example today there was
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:10.560]  a long old man who was stolen on the street and I saw a cop get on the bus
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:14.400]  with him and go home with him he took the guy home and that's a that's a normal
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:18.200]  thing you see every day here you don't see that in America I'm afraid to call
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:22.360]  the cops when I'm in America because like we said we get this you know you're
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:26.280]  just as likely to get beat up or you know thrown in prison for what the other
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:29.760]  person did to you and it's ridiculous balance you know I've never been in
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:33.760]  Japan but I want to go but I've read a lot of its history and it certainly has
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:39.000]  its own set of problems because they folks do work together so closely that
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:44.720]  if you have a tyranny is very dangerous because people will follow cult-like
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:49.080]  orders kind of like the Nazi Germans did but look at when they have an
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:55.600]  earthquake or a tsunami crime rate goes down Japan is one of the lowest crime
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:13:00.520]  rates in the world they don't have any right to own guns there they have
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:05.560]  occasional crazies that I'll kill a bunch of people with a knife but it's the
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:11.200]  culture that people are respectful to each other and so see it would be
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:19.480]  dishonorable for the Japanese police to be rude to people actually know somebody
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:24.920]  who was in a fight though the military in Japan and once they didn't stop
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:30.480]  fighting then the police came in with and with their bare hands gotten a big
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:39.560]  martial arts fight in the bar and so that's actually what happened that goes
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:46.080]  on and you're absolutely right and then once they arrested them they didn't
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:49.480]  even handcuff them they told them put your hands in your lap and then when
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:53.720]  they didn't do it they would karate chop them so once that happened the gloves
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:57.960]  were off and they would like started karate chopping them and putting bruises
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:05.280]  so that is certainly what goes on over there and America was born out of the
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:12.040]  gun America was born out of swashbuckling free-booting pirate like
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:17.480]  war continually so that's why America's had so many inventions it's why we're
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:21.960]  feared when we go to war but now we're kind of the decadent slob great-grand
[02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:28.080]  children of those that built the nation and so the police are a reflection of
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:37.440]  the public the public is demonic slovenly arrogant violent hateful not not on
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:42.840]  average but we have a large sub-segment of trash white trash black trash
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:47.960]  Mexican trash you name it just trashy people they all act the same and have
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:52.920]  the same horrible habits and love to thug around and love to gang up on people
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:57.400]  and when I see thug culture in a community it can be white trash people
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:01.920]  in a small town ganging up it can be black trash ganging up on people it can
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:07.040]  be again a gang of cops ganging up and acting like thugs it's called mob
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:14.560]  psychology and America now has a mob psychology and that's when police are
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:20.680]  dangerous is when they're in groups and showing off to each other and no one
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:24.120]  dare challenge the other because well then we're speaking out against a
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:30.040]  brother no you're not what you're doing is creating a climate that is going to
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:35.600]  collapse the country but in the midterm pressure on police will make them close
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:41.340]  ranks and be that much more militarized and corrupt which will lead to the
[02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:46.920]  civil war so I'm saying let's try to fix it from the public side and the police
[02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:50.840]  side and we can decide what to do later about how big departments should be or
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:57.840]  what's constitutional it's just I don't want to play into the larger plan does
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:04.080]  that make sense and you're completely right about the police here they they
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:07.160]  ought to learn you know martial arts they often know that stuff and your
[02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:11.720]  people try to bring up this argument a lot with me that look man they have the
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:14.360]  lowest crime rate in the world of any industrialized country and they have no
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:17.600]  guns well you're right it's completely different their mindset is completely
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:21.480]  different it's a completely different culture it's not you can't transpose
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:25.320]  Japan onto America and use that argument it's two completely different
[02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:30.080]  mindsets that their culture is about working together it's it's brought up
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:33.800]  from childhood into you know the business workforce it's all about
[02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:37.600]  working together in America we were born like you said we were born out of
[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:41.920]  war we've always had the guns and like you we can't just take the people who
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:45.120]  follow the orders guns because the criminals will still have the guns in
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:49.400]  Japan no one has the guns already even the police don't have the guns the guns
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:52.880]  are already on in America the criminals will always have the guns and they're
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:56.760]  called turtle men we we're gonna make the citizens turtle men but not the
[02:16:56.760 --> 02:17:00.960]  criminals that that makes completely no sense so it's completely false if the
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:08.200]  reason the Japanese don't allow guns also is that's for war and notice the NYPD
[02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:11.960]  has now come out and said we're in a wartime department now yeah you dressed
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:16.680]  up like it you got ready for it now it's happening you acted like soldiers to
[02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:20.160]  the citizens and Lord knows there's a lot of scum in New York the police have
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:26.000]  a really bad job but it's just being around all that constantly you dance
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.360]  with the devil the devil doesn't change you change and the police are a
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:37.800]  reflection of this country did the police abort it's like 60 million now I
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:40.400]  keep saying 50 something million the numbers old it's 60 something million
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:47.120]  people aborted get me the latest aborted since Roe v Wade guys thanks the
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:50.400]  police didn't put the floor right in the water the police aren't setting up
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:54.400]  world government the police didn't open the border all I'm saying is I got big
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:18:02.240]  problems with the police big ones but I've got real problems with the brain of
[02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:08.080]  the system that's what's really jacking with us including the police 55 million
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:16.760]  seven hundred and seventy thousand fifteen but that number is again rounded
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:20.040]  back so it's higher than that I saw in this article a few weeks ago that it's
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:26.920]  approaching 60 mil 60 million people that are dead and we go oh we don't know
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:31.000]  people to pay social security now we've got to import people we've got to
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:39.200]  import 50 million illegals gee how many people you kill but I forgot I'm a
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:42.880]  racist that's why I don't like the fact that did you know almost half of those
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:52.600]  are black almost half the abortions if you swear the numbers are black man I
[02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:59.160]  could be a liberal Klan member and have black folks eaten out of my hand like
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:02.640]  senator bird and Bill Clinton all those people that's why I make jokes of
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:06.600]  Democrats when I see him around town I see a state senator it's a Democrat or
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:10.800]  I'll say hey where your clan rubs and they'll always laugh because let me tell
[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:19.040]  you folks they know and it just makes me want to throw up but let me tell you
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:24.120]  want to get something done you know the Dixie mafia it's even more Dixie up
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:30.120]  north and isn't the south I tell you not my soul I'm not I'm not sounding on to
[02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:36.000]  killing 55 million people half of them black and I just harp on that over and
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:41.280]  over again because we gotta have a war we gotta kill cops because cuz a couple
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:48.120]  black guys got shot one man dies as a tragedy 10,000 dies as a statistic think
[02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:52.120]  Joe Stalin said that all right I'm gonna hit North Korea coming up more your
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:56.520]  calls and a lot more Wesley in Japan and I say cyan are to you well they're out
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:20:02.640]  back if you have candida overgrowth just taking antifungal agents are
[02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:06.280]  starving yourself of sweets does not address the cause candida overgrowth is
[02:20:06.280 --> 02:20:10.520]  the result of a toxic damaged acidic low oxygen and inflamed tissue

[02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:49.720]  were young and strong still just running against the wind but that's what
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:53.720]  makes you strong in life is running against the wind always going with the
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:25:00.920]  flow now that sounds like North Korea doesn't in fact we have a graphic up on
[02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:06.120]  the front page of info wars dot com it says a nation of sheep will beget a
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:14.440]  government of wolves Edward R. Murrow the great journalist as he's known
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:19.760]  because he defended communist but you could argue he defended the first
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:24.320]  amendment so maybe he is a hero that's a subject of debate but what he is doing
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:32.640]  is changing a quote by Thomas Jefferson so many quotes I see are just rip offs
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:37.440]  of other quotes that the Thomas Jefferson quote is a nation of sheep will
[02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:42.840]  be ruled by wolves I think that's a lot straighter don't you a nation of sheep
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:50.600]  will be ruled by wolves but perhaps it's even more eloquent I don't know a
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:57.000]  nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves that's probably even more
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:07.440]  point poignant because it is true sheep likeness submission I mean I've told
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:11.440]  the story I'm not looking for trouble but I was in a little Texas resort town
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:16.880]  South Padre and there was a motorcycle rally going on there and it wasn't
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:20.640]  supposedly you know outlaw motorcycle gangs wasn't even those guys but it was
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:23.520]  just people out there just acting some most of them are real nice but some of
[02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:29.320]  them are aggressive when say stuff to people and be rude to families and one
[02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:34.680]  under that to me and I was like what the hell is your problem man and I'm not
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:39.560]  looking for trouble but I was just like are you ready to back it up cuz you're
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:48.880]  wearing a leather jacket I stopped right there but I mean you know I don't like
[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:55.960]  people acting like wolves I've been to a third-world country like Nicaragua and
[02:26:56.800 --> 02:27:02.280]  seeing how the cops act there it's scary that just like gang members that are
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:06.880]  getting ready to mug you they get that same look that same criminal swagger and
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:12.120]  when I see it in cops eyes or anybody's eyes I'm sick of it I see it in Nancy
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:16.520]  Pelosi and Harry Reid's eyes there are a bunch of thugs perched on us Rahm
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:22.640]  Emmanuel all these globalists maybe want to throw up and when I see that
[02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:30.560]  little maggot Kim Jong-un I'm gonna talk more about this in the next segment as
[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:37.640]  well of North Korea a hereditary dictator if he can stay in power another
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:43.440]  hundred years they'll have red carpets for his great-great-grandchildren and
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:50.160]  Hollywood stars I want to kiss their ring three generations a hereditary
[02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:55.200]  dictator most the country doesn't even have an electricity show the map of
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:28:01.560]  South Korea at night versus North Korea only two cities are lit up
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:06.240]  millions of star-to-death or died or been eaten most families the children
[02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:10.440]  are taken like eggs from a hen to quote George Arwell and raised in government
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:19.200]  facilities to be just mindless gibbering idiots and we are to believe that
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:22.880]  North Korea did this I believe I'm gonna give Steve Pachennick's take on this
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:29.160]  wrote Net Force and a lot of other big books with Tom Clancy but I believe this
[02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:35.800]  is a false flag probably by Sony as a way to super hype this film ahead of a
[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:41.520]  larger release later and as a way to call for more net censorship and attacks
[02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:47.200]  on piracy because they're tying North Korea now to piracy online piracy
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:51.240]  president Barack Obama is reckless spreading rumors of North Korea
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:54.880]  orchestrated cyberattack on Sony pictures North Korea says close quote as
[02:28:54.880 --> 02:28:59.800]  it warns of strikes against the White House Pentagon and the whole US mainland
[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:05.400]  the cesspool of terrorism such rhetoric is routine from North Korea's massive
[02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:08.920]  propaganda machine during times of high tension with Washington been a long
[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:14.760]  statement from the powerful National Defense Commission the powerful I mean
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:19.880]  it looks like a bunch of people make jokes about it because it's so evil and
[02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:24.720]  so over the top in their badly tailored little suits standing around like a
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:32.280]  bunch of tyranny bots everywhere it's it's just the opposite of freedom I mean
[02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:36.800]  it's just the spirit is just pure evil but see the evil that runs our country
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:42.040]  can sit back and look good juxtaposed to that we're gonna break all this down

[02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:05.360]  state speaking in North Korea I'm gonna get dr. Steve Pachinic's take on that
[02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:09.520]  he's been to North Korea he did a lot with South Korea we're gonna get his
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:12.960]  take on the situation with Russia he grew up in Cuba has a very interesting
[02:34:12.960 --> 02:34:15.920]  background we're gonna cover the waterfront just bam bam bam with Steve
[02:34:15.920 --> 02:34:19.960]  Pachinic but look at these headlines North Korea's internet is having serious
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:23.720]  problems it's already limited to just a few cities as we showed satellite photos
[02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:30.880]  only two cities have power that's being reported by the verge newspaper but
[02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:34.640]  we're to believe they ran these sophisticated hacking attacks well I
[02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:40.440]  said last week probably staged to bring in a bunch of cyber security laws or it
[02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:45.320]  was other hacker groups and they're blaming North Korea North Korea responded
[02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:48.840]  by saying we'll blow the whole US up how about you blow up the whole galaxy
[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:52.520]  while you're at it they can't even tie their shoelaces from what I know North
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:35:00.320]  Korea threatened strikes on US amid hacking claims and they've come out and
[02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:04.640]  said that they did not do it and then it's a false flag by Obama I hate to be
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:10.440]  agreeing with North Korea but that's certainly where it points Sony gets a
[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:16.520]  new threat anonymous says hackers aren't Korean release film or more hacks coming
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:23.040]  yeah a bunch of these past hacks have been admittedly not North Korea of the
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:30.040]  Apple cloud of other major groups we've got an expert on cyber security and
[02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:34.360]  somebody that wrote books on it with Tom Clancy Steve Pachinic we're gonna cover
[02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:38.000]  the waterfront here doc Steve Pachinic.com is new books out there you can
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:43.040]  find it at StevePachinic.com Steve Pachinic talks is the new book but
[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:47.320]  Steve let's let's get into your take briefly on what's happening with North
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:51.800]  Korea and this whole move to say we're not gonna show Team America we're not
[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:55.840]  gonna show this movie now is that just an attempt to set the precedent for the
[02:35:55.840 --> 02:36:01.040]  feds to ban movies by fiat? No I don't think so I think what the problem really
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:06.000]  was you have to understand the dysfunctional level of Hollywood number
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:10.040]  one you have to understand Sony is not an American company that was not made
[02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:14.760]  clear to anybody in the United States of the world Sony is a Japanese company
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:20.240]  it's a wholly owned subsidiary of a Japanese Ipotsu so the issue really
[02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:24.600]  relates between North Korea and Japan which has a long-standing history of
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:28.880]  discontented fighting since World War II and prior to World War II there's
[02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:33.720]  nothing to do with the United States this has much more to do with Kim Jong-un
[02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:39.920]  Kim Il-sung who had a whole long history against the Japanese and this has to
[02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:45.920]  do with Abe his handling of his economy his handling of cybersecurity and where
[02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:49.520]  Japan stands relative to Korea I don't think our own government really
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:54.280]  understood this in terms of the fact that this is really a Japan versus Korean
[02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:59.120]  narrative not a United States versus a North Korean narrative the North Koreans
[02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:02.560]  can say whatever they want but they attack the Japanese company they did
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:06.600]  not attack Weinstein Group they now attack Warner Brothers they did not attack
[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:11.080]  an American company Sony is the wholly owned Japanese company you know that's a
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:14.320]  great point I was thinking that last week because I mean for those that don't
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:17.880]  know the Chinese the Japanese absolutely hate each other at least from what
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:22.560]  happened in World War II even bigger atrocities by the Japanese in what is
[02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:27.080]  now North and South Korea and they still follow that World War II propaganda
[02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:31.240]  that the original you know granddaddy came out of that they're still at war
[02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:35.160]  with Japan they're constantly threatening to nuke Japan and so you're
[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:39.720]  saying this is Japanese anti-North Korea propaganda oh this is totally between
[02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:43.160]  North Korea and Japan I mean it's not an accident they could have put any show
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:47.560]  that they wanted to the fact that it was a North Korean semblance of the leader
[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:51.360]  there's all kinds of videos of the North Korean leader that's that's never been
[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:56.920]  hacked but the real reason is you have two anti-Japanese films coming on you
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:37:59.600]  know the one about with what's their name
[02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:05.520]  Angelie Jolie Unbroken and then you've got this film which comes as anti-Korean
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:10.840]  but comes out of Japan and the Japanese do not admit to the fact that they've
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:17.880]  killed hundreds of millions of people in Korea in Japan in Vietnam this is an old
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:22.440]  story that has never been closed by the Japanese and the nationalism in Japan is
[02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:27.760]  increased because Abe has an economic process problem and in turn Kim Jong-un
[02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:32.440]  is attacking Japan to warn them that this is not going to continue by the way
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:36.800]  much of the money that came out of North Korea came from the Pachinko parlors
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:41.120]  of Japan the gambling top and they Japanese don't admit that so you've
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:44.760]  got a whole special relationship that unfortunately our president got into a
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:47.880]  narrative that didn't belong to the United States sure didn't belong to
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:52.800]  cyber-attacking it belong to a province okay so you think the theory that it's a
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:58.560]  false flag why is Kim Jong-un then saying that Obama and Sony did it you know I
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:02.200]  don't even know if he said anything quite frankly you don't really know what
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:06.560]  who says what to whom but I can tell you that the relationship between Japan and
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:10.880]  North Korea is a determinant real relationship that's historically
[02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:15.480]  determined not by the narratives that we create now the minute I saw that I said
[02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:19.880]  Sony's in trouble because it's Japanese and the man who runs the blinten who was
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:23.120]  the head of a publishing company doesn't know anything doesn't know how to manage
[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:27.680]  any well they admit Sony is in trouble and may be sold as usual a very unique
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:31.000]  perspective you may be right probably are and we know that they're in a
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:34.680]  propaganda war against each other I've just got to say I think of the Japanese
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:42.600]  despite their past atrocities we have our own here as a lot better than that
[02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:48.960]  Kim Jong-un Japanese never had a Nuremberg trial like the German said we
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:52.960]  have never indicted any of the Japanese war criminals who started biological
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:57.960]  warfare and killed American soldiers British soldiers Dutch soldiers and
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:03.320]  killed Chinese civilians in Manchuria we've never had that and he's always been
[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:08.160]  covered up as a butterfly enthusiast as opposed to the man who ran the Japanese
[02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:12.680]  biological warfare so we have an old history here that comes out and Kim
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:17.040]  Jong-un is emphasizing that once the narrative goes away from America right
[02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:22.040]  between Japan and North Korea now they let you into North Korea is that right
[02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:26.400]  yeah I got in there through another passport North Korea is basically a
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:30.800]  country like East Germany what the West Germany is it's a failed state but we
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:35.600]  cannot unite it with an increasingly effective state like South Korea and the
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:40.280]  reason for that is if we put the two countries together they will implode a
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:45.840]  South Korea cannot handle the poverty and the scarcity of commodities and and
[02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:51.520]  the ruling class which faces on which is based on kleptocracy so basically the
[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:54.960]  United States and the other countries that are involved in Asia are doing it
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:41:00.320]  very slowly and quite frankly it's China's responsibility China is the
[02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:05.720]  guarantor for North Korea China knows that very well China has to handle North
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:09.920]  Korea China will handle the hacking and the Chinese are responsible when it
[02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:13.760]  comes to that they know very well that North Korea can get out of control so
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:17.840]  it's not an issue with the United States has to get into this or anybody outside
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:22.000]  of Hollywood which is dysfunctional institution with another dysfunctional
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:25.200]  okay North Korea all right let's shift gears because I want to get you on some
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:29.560]  about your life it's very interesting dr. C. Pachennick joins us right now we
[02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:32.840]  don't know a lot about I mean how you were brought up what happened if you were
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:38.000]  born in Cuba right tell us about that and then give us your take on Cuba I was
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:42.080]  born in Cuba as a fact as a matter of fact that the great liberal FDR did not
[02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:47.200]  allow a lot of the Holocaust survivors or my father and mother to come in to 41
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:51.880]  after the during the war my father's in the French army my mother escaped to
[02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:57.760]  Spain and lived in and they bought visas into Cuba it was like Casablanca the
[02:41:57.760 --> 02:42:02.720]  movie so I grew up I didn't I grew up there for the age of five six we left my
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:06.080]  mother spoke Russian we knew that the Russians were coming in little by little
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:10.120]  I didn't know Castro would be a communist but she didn't like the Russian she
[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:13.360]  didn't like the communists she didn't like the fascists so we eventually got
[02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:17.640]  to the United States the fact that I have fought the Cubans route feed those
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:22.320]  people in Panama and they're very effective they're very smart they run a
[02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:26.560]  very effective scyops campaign in Panama and elsewhere in Honduras and in
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:31.120]  Africa the real issue is that after 50 years the embargo really hasn't worked
[02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:35.400]  what it's done in effect has made a lot of Midwestern farmers very wealthy which
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:40.840]  I don't get grudge their wealth they made over 300 million and we and
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:45.880]  commodity sales but the point of fact is it doesn't work anymore and Cuba after
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:50.520]  50 years it's not a really a strategic threat to anybody along the United States
[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:55.240]  we have so many Cubans now in Miami in the United States and with the Burton
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:58.760]  Hill Act here where they can come to the United States touch the ground they
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:03.320]  basically become United States citizens so Cuba has always played an important
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:06.200]  part of the history of the United States for example during this their
[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:11.360]  Revolutionary War Cuba was a transit point for which Benjamin Franklin and
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:16.480]  many of our founding fathers received illegal money from Spain and France and
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:20.240]  at the guns and ammunition in order to fight the British most people don't know
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:24.260]  that but eventually Cuban with his within with the fact of province of the
[02:43:24.260 --> 02:43:28.160]  United States it has never been a strategic problem even during the Cuban
[02:43:28.160 --> 02:43:32.800]  Missile Crisis I think Kennedy was not capable of handling it we had a
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:38.000]  stand down eventually came through you know Kennedy became a false legend but
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:42.880]  the reality is enough is enough Cuba is really not our problem our problem now
[02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:47.480]  is really nothing we handle the Soviet Union very well now we've effectively
[02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:52.400]  handled Putin very well with the ruble and the effectiveness of the American
[02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:56.080]  economy which is formidable I mean coming this Christmas America has to
[02:43:56.080 --> 02:44:00.360]  understand how strong we are in terms of our capitalist structure and this
[02:44:00.360 --> 02:44:05.040]  results from the Brett Wood Conference of 1944 where everything in the world is
[02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:09.400]  denominated against the dollar including the ruble and we've just knocked down in
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:12.680]  this administration they've knocked down the ruble they've knocked down the
[02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:18.200]  ratings with the Russian and the junk bond and so now effectively the United
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:23.480]  States is superpower not only militarily but economically so doctor let me stop
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:27.080]  here right there let me just stop you for a minute yes this is great game stuff
[02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:31.680]  I mean this sounds like British tactics to knock everybody else out so we're
[02:44:31.680 --> 02:44:36.360]  number one but meanwhile our same elite is taking our basic freedoms as well and
[02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:42.200]  foisting it into this global system I mean I want the American system to be
[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:46.440]  successful and to be the culture of the world but I wanted to do that through the
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:53.280]  fact that it's moral and upright I mean what did Russia do in the short term to
[02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:57.880]  deserve a destabilization and an attempt to take its gas lines in the
[02:44:57.880 --> 02:45:02.720]  Europe why why shouldn't they be able to have a gas pipeline in the South
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:07.200]  Korea honestly it had nothing to do with their gas lines as much as it had to do
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:12.240]  with the fact that Putin has been a kleptocrat for so long that he's been
[02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:16.240]  ruining the Russian economy this came out of the Russians themselves and he
[02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:20.840]  created the socio-elympic he spent over 50 billion dollars he wasted out the
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:25.600]  internal reserves and then there was a flight of capital the issue of Crimea is
[02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:30.440]  a false issue the real issue that came in was the issue that he's destroying the
[02:45:30.440 --> 02:45:35.560]  country and like basically Yeltsin and Gorbachev he's a very weak leader
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:40.000]  although he looks tough he looks very effective and he looks a macho he in
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:43.800]  effect was a very weak leader for Russia what American needs is a strong
[02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:49.200]  technocratic leader in Russia that can actually create trade and can work in
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:53.400]  an international system the point of fact here is not that we started it
[02:45:53.400 --> 02:45:58.600]  miss Merkel who was the head of Germany who knew him very well basically that
[02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:02.840]  this cannot continue the way he's been acting as a kleptocrat destroying the
[02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:07.240]  Russian economy and the Russian people are now suffering it was not a result of
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:11.840]  what we initiated it would be effective what we did in psychological warfare and
[02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:16.160]  economic warfare was a complete result of what Putin did to his own people the
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:20.440]  Russians are great they have nothing to do with it this was directed to Putin
[02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:24.800]  initiated by you and then followed by the United States so are you saying that
[02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:28.520]  that the West is putting Putin out of his misery and then he was already
[02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:32.760]  killing the country yes yes that's exactly what we did with Yeltsin that's
[02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:36.680]  what we did with Gorbachev now we're doing with Putin what Russian needs is
[02:46:36.680 --> 02:46:43.440]  that as a clean a clean minister who can run the country without any problems
[02:46:43.440 --> 02:46:46.960]  with pathocracy and reaping their own country that's basically what we're
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:51.640]  doing there's a man named Gordon there who's a prime minister with a financial
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:57.640]  minister he said it himself Russia was destroyed by Putin we only helped it but
[02:46:57.640 --> 02:47:02.560]  no never doubt our ability to run a psychological war for economic warfare
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:06.520]  when somebody comes in with tanks that are antiquated airplanes that are
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:11.200]  antiquated or threatens any of our partners in the EU this is the formidable
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:16.000]  part of America and the fact that we can do something without even having to show
[02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:20.640]  our gun basically we do it because we're very sophisticated we've done it 20
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:25.720]  years ago in economic warfare we will do it again it's not the imperialism of a
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:29.200]  Britain kind of British country it's really the effectiveness of an
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:34.320]  international system that says we can no longer afford the kleptocracy that
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:38.000]  exists in one country in order to destroy it so that we can have the
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:42.320]  distorted trade what we needed to pay a trade system even with Russia it's a
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:46.200]  Russian yeah but I mean saying Russia's kleptocratic is the pot calling the
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:51.920]  kettle black I mean look how kleptocratic our elites are well I don't
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:55.480]  say our big corporations are not kleptocratic believe me I'm not a
[02:47:55.480 --> 02:48:00.120]  theologian here but it turns out that in fact we have a far more resilient
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:04.840]  system that works not so much at the elite level as it does on the local and
[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:08.160]  community level I don't want to shift gears I want to shift gears and look at
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:12.720]  psyops I'm not a psyops expert like you but I'm not a doctor psychiatry either
[02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:18.800]  but I can look at MSNBC CNN the White House trying to stir up black on white
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:23.640]  crime trying to create race riots trying to say the police are the cause of all
[02:48:23.640 --> 02:48:28.240]  our problems are certainly have been turned into paramilitary units but why
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:33.960]  is the establishment or maybe you disagree trying to stir up civil unrest I
[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:38.560]  see it as more divide and conquer I don't know if it's divide and conquer I
[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:43.000]  don't think the president's been a very effective leader internally in terms of
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:47.240]  articulating any position the fact that he's black activates the situation he
[02:48:47.240 --> 02:48:53.560]  knows that Eric Holder is left he's a not to African-Americans or blacks who
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:58.200]  came out of America these are guys who were born other countries came out of
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:03.600]  either the Caribbean as Eric Holder did and Obama wherever else he came out of
[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:08.520]  Kenya the issue at hand here has to do with underlying simmering problems
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:12.920]  between the black community which still has to get its act together without
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:18.320]  responding to agitators like Sharpton or Jesse Jackson and the fact that you can
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:23.520]  even give credence to CNN MSNBC or any of the others is a joke quite frankly
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:27.720]  Alice because we don't even have it anymore no I know but they are they
[02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:32.480]  have a small audience and it's there it's their viewers and they've knocked out
[02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:38.440]  Fox News you're the only news I listen to well you're what I'm saying is the
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:43.120]  remnant of the Democratic Party wants to run everything on racial division to
[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:47.520]  change the subject from economics and they're clearly doing it I wanted to
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:51.200]  get your view on it because they're trying to push a narrative that's going
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:55.240]  to trigger a bunch of cop-killing now I know the system's pushing it why do you
[02:49:55.240 --> 02:49:58.960]  think they're pushing it well the problem that they're pushing they may be
[02:49:58.960 --> 02:50:02.000]  desperate and looking at the various issues because they have no other
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:05.600]  issue to look at but it's a very dangerous issue to look at cop-killing
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:09.960]  and go against policemen on the local level the black skill understands this
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:13.080]  but I did not I didn't vote for the last year and certainly I know people in
[02:50:13.080 --> 02:50:17.040]  New York who didn't vote for it again we voted for people are not qualified to
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:21.320]  manage age assistance as long as the Democrat or Republicans want to put
[02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:26.440]  forth candidates we're not capable of managing complex systems this is what
[02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:31.880]  will happen they will go to the lowest level of prejudice and the lowest level
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:35.120]  of propaganda and problem-acquainted because that's all they know how to do
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:40.880]  that's right it's a dumbing down to just mindless idiocy correct and that's what
[02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:44.920]  the blast goes doing he has no idea about a run a complicated city like New
[02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:49.360]  York he's not qualified like Bloomberg he wasn't effective at Giuliani it's not
[02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:52.920]  a question with your Republican or Democrat it's a question of did you do

[02:53:58.600 --> 02:54:08.320]  final segment for the main broadcast I'm gonna go to some overdrive to talk to
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:18.640]  Cindy and Terry and Nelson the folks have been holding the longest I'm Alex
[02:54:18.640 --> 02:54:22.720]  Jones your host we just tuned in Steve Pachinick is our guest that comes on
[02:54:22.720 --> 02:54:26.880]  every few months always has interesting points and background Steve Pachinick
[02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:31.360]  com is his website okay doc so we covered a lot of different issues today
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:38.680]  interesting perspective I do monitor what I'd call dinosaur media and and I
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:43.560]  mean that's all they've got because big government socialism collectivism didn't
[02:54:43.560 --> 02:54:49.160]  deliver so now it's just class warfare I just it's sick to watch big crony
[02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:56.080]  capitalists like George Soros and the big foundations full tilt funding racial
[02:54:56.080 --> 02:54:59.800]  division and infighting but I guess that's what they need to do to keep us
[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:06.560]  from ever identifying them what is your brief prognosis for the new year the
[02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:12.320]  economy and what's coming I think my prognosis is very very good number one
[02:55:12.320 --> 02:55:16.480]  our economy is going to be going very quickly as the oil price is going down
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:22.200]  probably $40 barrel number two we're growing at a very fast rate three to
[02:55:22.200 --> 02:55:28.880]  five percent per year small businesses are increasing capacity a local
[02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:33.720]  government is coming more and more effective as opposed to national
[02:55:33.720 --> 02:55:38.160]  government we are going to stop going into other wars we're going to start
[02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:43.720]  ceasing the war we're going to have a Iran Dayton and probably Palestine will
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:47.200]  be recognized at the far stretch but I would say that's where it's going to go
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:51.200]  we're going to realign the Middle East and I think America will remain the
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:56.480]  superpower for quite another five to ten years without any effort not use
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:56:01.680]  military force what about China what about other hot spots China has to work
[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:06.080]  with us because Americans have to understand one thing every rendi or
[02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:10.880]  every one that the Chinese has is it calibrated against the dollar so they
[02:56:10.880 --> 02:56:14.880]  can have as many rendi that they can't but it really is against the dollar the
[02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:20.120]  China is now in a real state of economic problems I don't wish it to last but
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:25.440]  general president V Xi has now gotten rid of a lot of eclectic cracks just like
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:28.400]  he did a Putin night and you know he got it he could have gotten rid of Putin
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:31.520]  he's getting rid of all of the corruption within the military within the
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:36.840]  communist party and he's trying to regionalize the growth areas so they
[02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:41.080]  can grow but unfortunately China cannot grow as effective we've united today it
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:45.400]  will not be a dominant power even though its economy is larger than ours our
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:50.520]  per capita income is very low compared to ours whereas in 20 to 30 thousand
[02:56:50.520 --> 02:56:54.320]  business in a couple of thousands so there's no comparison between China and
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:58.800]  the United States China will always work with us or against us but for the most
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:02.440]  part China is not a threat what about their threats to go in and grab
[02:57:02.440 --> 02:57:07.640]  Philippine or Japanese islands it's only a threat basically we've had the
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:11.760]  Spratly Island issues which I've written about 20 30 years ago but basically we
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:16.720]  act as the intercessor our sink back our Navy is very effective without our Navy
[02:57:16.720 --> 02:57:22.360]  China cannot go through the states of Malacca or into the the cheese and the
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:26.920]  Pacific Ocean without our protection so China needs us to protect their shipping
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:31.040]  we protect 98% of issues. What do you make of China starting military action
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:35.600]  against Vietnam? Well they can start it but they have to remember they were twice
[02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:39.400]  beaten by Vietnam and that's quite dangerous Chinese know the Vietnamese
[02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:43.480]  have beaten them twice it's not a good beginning for the Chinese they're not
[02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:47.440]  continue with that China has bigger internal problem than it has external
[02:57:47.440 --> 02:57:54.720]  problem and G is a very ruthless leader and he will keep China control but it
[02:57:54.720 --> 02:58:00.200]  has to be controlled within a year one year you have 175,000 riots that have
[02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:04.760]  to do with corruption corruption not coming and we're seeing attacks on
[02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:08.720]  police and government when they're seen as not delivering justice as you said
[02:58:08.720 --> 02:58:13.520]  over 100,000 riots a year I think if we see more government corruption here
[02:58:13.520 --> 02:58:18.760]  we're going to see that phenomenon expanding. Well the United States is
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:25.040]  interesting we are very quiet people but basically pushes too far we do have
[02:58:25.040 --> 02:58:29.640]  a second amendment and it's always there we don't need to use it right now. I agree
[02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:35.160]  with you we need to whoever holds their fire to the end wins in this fight
[02:58:35.160 --> 02:58:39.640]  Dr. Pachennick thank you I'm Alex Jones infowars.com I'll be back tomorrow live
[02:58:39.640 --> 02:58:49.320]  I'm gonna do some overdrive infowars.com forward slash up. From the water
[02:58:49.320 --> 02:58:54.200]  table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and
[02:58:54.200 --> 02:58:58.080]  more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside this toxic
[02:58:58.080 --> 02:59:01.920]  indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of
[02:59:01.920 --> 02:59:05.800]  pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time
[02:59:05.800 --> 02:59:09.880]  inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42
[02:59:09.880 --> 02:59:13.960]  million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold and
[02:59:13.960 --> 02:59:17.920]  mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million
[02:59:17.920 --> 02:59:21.120]  Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to
[02:59:21.120 --> 02:59:25.160]  research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my
[02:59:25.160 --> 02:59:29.360]  lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but
[02:59:29.360 --> 02:59:33.440]  we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and
[02:59:33.440 --> 02:59:37.800]  manufactured in the USA the new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a
[02:59:37.800 --> 02:59:41.000]  convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic
[02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:45.240]  environment now available exclusively an info wars life.com or by calling toll
[02:59:45.240 --> 02:59:49.800]  three eight eight eight two five three three one three nine
[02:59:49.800 --> 02:59:59.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:17.080]  fix bayonets we are now entering overdrive with your host alex jones
[03:00:17.080 --> 03:00:22.240]  broadcasting live from the front lines if you are receiving this transmission
[03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:26.040]  you are the resistance all right moving through calls quickly thanks for
[03:00:26.040 --> 03:00:30.520]  holding while patenek was on shendy in pennsylvania you're on the air go ahead
[03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:35.160]  yeah I originally called to speak about the police but you said you got no
[03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:40.720]  answers pertaining to solutions my solution is we quit listen to mainstream
[03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:45.400]  media on TV when I saw them announce about the cop killing I automatically
[03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:50.160]  bought false flag as soon as I saw the photo that they showed it showed up
[03:00:50.160 --> 03:00:55.880]  pistol and it showed camo pants with guns on it with blood on it false flag
[03:00:55.880 --> 03:01:01.720]  like donna you know the most surveilled cities in the country they don't show us
[03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:08.600]  any videos and I think the solution is instead of always being on the defensive
[03:01:08.600 --> 03:01:14.840]  we have to go on the offense of against this racism and it would be great out
[03:01:14.840 --> 03:01:19.160]  if you could print out for Martin Luther King t-shirts and everybody start
[03:01:19.160 --> 03:01:24.080]  wearing them and we just take up the flag of Martin Luther King and we just
[03:01:24.080 --> 03:01:29.360]  non-violence now that's a great idea and I wish MSNBC and others would do
[03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:32.520]  that because they have a small audience but they're definitely stirring stuff up
[03:01:32.520 --> 03:01:36.560]  you know what said this government and the new work government has been caught
[03:01:36.560 --> 03:01:40.320]  staging false flags and going along with them so you have to look at it being a
[03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:44.440]  drill or set up I watched the videos carefully though it looks pretty real to
[03:01:44.440 --> 03:01:51.040]  me this guy killed his wife and then there was a terrorism drill going on and
[03:01:51.040 --> 03:01:56.520]  he went and killed them or killed his girlfriend and you know he already had
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:01:59.560]  blood on him when he put it out on Facebook that he was gonna go do this
[03:01:59.560 --> 03:02:04.280]  show sandy hooks of false flags we got the blue screens and the kids going back
[03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:07.560]  in the building and no helicopters called and I mean I don't want to go into
[03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:12.400]  it all but I mean and when it's a false flag we'll say false flag I don't know
[03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:15.760]  I mean this looks pretty real to me but it's not a bad question to ask because
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:18.840]  they've got a history of it Terry in Minnesota thanks for holding you're on
[03:02:18.840 --> 03:02:23.240]  the air good brother go ahead
[03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:29.200]  I'm stuck at union.com and the grand jury of Minneapolis County Grand
[03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:35.400]  Terry clearly four officers on a highway 212 shooting and eating prairie there
[03:02:35.400 --> 03:02:42.640]  were two people Matthew service and Don Fister of Wisconsin and what happened is
[03:02:42.640 --> 03:02:50.480]  the two were in a crash they crashed the car and then the Matthew service came
[03:02:50.480 --> 03:02:56.440]  out with a knife and the four officers shot him right there in there and then
[03:02:56.440 --> 03:03:01.440]  she came up and then she got the knife and he shot her too let me ask you a
[03:03:01.440 --> 03:03:04.800]  question if you're in a car right why do you jump out with a knife at the cops
[03:03:04.800 --> 03:03:09.320]  and the last thing I'm gonna do is the cops pull up I'm gonna jump out with a
[03:03:09.320 --> 03:03:16.840]  knife I'm not I'm not saying it's good that they shot him but why I don't know
[03:03:16.840 --> 03:03:22.440]  what I was concerned about is you know they always talk about the tasers that
[03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:28.640]  they have and there's a part of them when it's in those I hear you I hear you
[03:03:28.640 --> 03:03:32.200]  there's the article grand jury clears police officers in highway 212 shooting
[03:03:32.200 --> 03:03:35.400]  it killed a couple I mean is there video of them coming at him with a knife
[03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:39.440]  because there's so much lying that goes on that just sounds crazy just jump out
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:43.960]  of your car from a wreck you're not even being pursued by the police you run at
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:47.560]  him with a knife that just sounds crazy but people do crazy stuff that's why I'm
[03:03:47.560 --> 03:03:51.120]  allowed to have guns under the Constitution to protect myself there's a
[03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:54.720]  cop can't be on every street corner we're living in a real tyranny Nelson in
[03:03:54.720 --> 03:03:58.040]  Florida thanks Terry Nelson you got about one minute you're our tail gunner
[03:03:58.040 --> 03:04:02.680]  all right I was on a musician in South Florida I wake up people every day and I had a suggestion
[03:04:02.680 --> 03:04:06.120]  about putting together the constitutional freedom truth tour with like
[03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:10.280]  Hank Williams Jr. William Nelson Ted Newgently Corrigan you know all the
[03:04:10.280 --> 03:04:14.280]  musicians that are you know literally minded and we do it every weekend and we
[03:04:14.280 --> 03:04:18.560]  when we educate people we create info warriors in every city that we go to when
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:22.120]  you host it you know that's a great idea but trying to get people and their
[03:04:22.120 --> 03:04:26.280]  managers to work together is like herding cats there's a reason you don't see
[03:04:26.280 --> 03:04:30.600]  like people walking their cat because they don't go in all directions so but
[03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:36.040]  it would be fun to do that try something I think we need to wake people up in
[03:04:36.040 --> 03:04:39.840]  each city so I do it every day and it works beautifully I know it does brother
[03:04:39.840 --> 03:04:44.280]  great job tell us about your band well it's just me I'm the outlaw patriot here
[03:04:44.280 --> 03:04:49.160]  in South Florida I do authentic haggard whaling Jenny's Johnny Cash I play the
[03:04:49.160 --> 03:04:53.200]  families and everyone's concerned every small business absolutely people are
[03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:56.560]  waking up God bless you Natalie new tonight 7 o'clock I'll be back tomorrow
[03:04:56.560 --> 03:05:24.120]  live
