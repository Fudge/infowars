[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:39.680]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones I've got to get in here
[00:39.680 --> 00:46.000]  earlier there is no doubt about that I do research at night obviously and early in the morning
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.880]  reading over the news I got in here about an hour before broadcast time and began trying to go through
[00:50.880 --> 00:58.800]  the several hundred news articles that we've printed off and scanning the different state-run
[00:58.800 --> 01:06.960]  media propaganda organs and literally I become shell shocked sometimes right as I begin to go on
[01:06.960 --> 01:14.000]  air because there is so much to cover so many different angles and things to get into but
[01:14.000 --> 01:23.280]  I'm going to try my best today to go over all of this information and we do have the crew
[01:24.400 --> 01:30.080]  popping in for a final report from California as Schwarzenegger likes to call it
[01:31.120 --> 01:36.240]  at the bottom of the hour than Dr. Nick Begich is going to be coming on because I want to talk about
[01:36.240 --> 01:42.720]  the war on reality with electromagnetic radiation chemical biological manipulation
[01:43.280 --> 01:47.040]  and the attempt to suppress human consciousness and how it ties into an article
[01:48.480 --> 01:55.360]  that we've got up on info wars.com today dealing with how the virtual society or the virtual prison
[01:55.360 --> 02:02.000]  as I call it is being built around all of us right now so that is coming up today
[02:02.000 --> 02:12.080]  today. Obama says that we should just trust me is the quote on the NSA he will handle everything
[02:12.080 --> 02:18.240]  after the Congress came out yesterday and said we're going to let you handle the reform
[02:19.280 --> 02:27.760]  of the criminal operation which he's helped to expand this is the foxes guarding the
[02:27.760 --> 02:33.440]  henhouse we're going to also look at forex confidence of the dollar wavering outside of Forbes
[02:33.440 --> 02:39.440]  Spain's youth unemployment now and unbelievably high levels we've got more news coming out about
[02:39.440 --> 02:45.280]  Sarah Palin's brother reporting that his dad was harassed by the IRS so yeah they go after your
[02:45.280 --> 02:55.760]  family but they're liberals so it's okay and you're like yeah but Bush was in power in 2008
[02:55.760 --> 03:04.720]  or Obama was just coming into power as president-elect the bureaucracy is anti-conservative
[03:05.680 --> 03:11.680]  it doesn't mean Sarah Palin's actually a viable presidential candidate in the terms of this
[03:11.680 --> 03:16.320]  of the establishment of the population I don't think she's an evil person I think she's somebody
[03:16.320 --> 03:21.360]  that's pretty smart in a lot of ways but also manipulatable and so they use her as kind of a
[03:21.360 --> 03:26.960]  pawn but because Sarah Palin is not consciously a globalist or consciously evil she would never
[03:26.960 --> 03:34.320]  be president and obviously a Sarah Palin would be a lot better than a Barack Obama but that's a
[03:34.320 --> 03:41.600]  side issue I don't care if she was a democrat a republican I don't care if she was a Ku Klux Klan
[03:41.600 --> 03:47.120]  member or a new black panther party member she shouldn't be targeted politically by the
[03:47.120 --> 03:53.840]  infernal revenue service the collection agency or the private fellow reserve set up the same year
[03:53.840 --> 04:01.360]  in 1913 okay that said we've got the really big news coming up member a few months ago
[04:02.880 --> 04:06.960]  JP Morgan Chase sent out letters saying that they were going to start charging people
[04:08.160 --> 04:13.760]  that made deposits businesses that made cash deposits but will you guys print me a flashback
[04:13.760 --> 04:19.200]  of that it's just too hard for me to jump around the windows here online and I don't have windows

[04:31.040 --> 04:36.800]  extremely important well now Wells Fargo to begin charging customers for deposits and Watson has a
[04:36.800 --> 04:41.760]  question mark there there's no question mark your letter says that and we've since confirmed it from
[04:41.760 --> 04:49.120]  others so that's coming up and also low flying homeland security helicopter to test for radiation

[08:16.560 --> 08:26.880]  i have got so much incredibly important news to break down today and live reports from california
[08:26.880 --> 08:30.720]  on the increasing radiation levels the final report by our crew that's done a great job in
[08:30.720 --> 08:35.920]  the last week out there we've got dr nick baggots joining us to break down not just the chemicals
[08:35.920 --> 08:40.000]  in the water and the biologicals in the gmo that are meant to manipulate human consciousness
[08:40.000 --> 08:46.080]  and control us on record but the electromagnetic that he believes and he documents is really their
[08:46.080 --> 08:51.840]  main focus compared to those other systems of control he'll be joining us in the second hour
[08:51.840 --> 08:57.760]  not with rumors but with patents documents and facts and we'll also look at the state of the
[08:57.760 --> 09:03.120]  world with one of my favorite guests dr nick baggots you know his brother is a u.s senator and of
[09:03.120 --> 09:09.920]  course his father was a famous congressman and he has testified to the e-u courts the e-u parliament
[09:09.920 --> 09:15.280]  uh the congress you name it and he is one of the top experts in the world on the breakaway
[09:15.280 --> 09:20.640]  civilization so we're going to look at that with him today uh this first hour i've got to be disciplined
[09:20.640 --> 09:26.480]  to go over all this there is so much news seems like every day it just gets more insane because
[09:26.480 --> 09:31.040]  the new world order is making its move on every front a global private corporate takeover now
[09:31.920 --> 09:37.760]  you notice that robert gates the former secretary of defense came out and endorsed bloomberg to be a
[09:37.760 --> 09:42.880]  future secretary of defense and the way they've been bringing them in and out like musical chairs
[09:42.880 --> 09:50.560]  that could happen anytime and that shows you here's this republican george herbert walker bush uh
[09:50.560 --> 10:00.000]  protege republican blue blood god and he wants the secretary of defense to be someone who has
[10:00.000 --> 10:09.360]  15 bodyguards as the former mayor billions of dollars out of wall street uh very smelly operations
[10:10.080 --> 10:17.040]  and who's sworn to disarm the american people and who runs clearly unconstitutional seditious illegal
[10:18.320 --> 10:25.040]  on record operations out of new york using taxpayer leveraged funds to try to shut down
[10:25.040 --> 10:31.280]  gun manufacturers in an act of espionage and that's what it is he represents the foreign powers
[10:31.280 --> 10:37.200]  of the globalist of the offshore banks that run the febble reserve basically everything else
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.320]  and imagine having that globalist operative as the secretary of defense there is no telling
[10:42.320 --> 10:48.320]  what bloomberg would pull what bloomberg would do and that just gives you an idea of what they'll
[10:48.320 --> 10:55.440]  pull if they get away with it and katie bar the door this guy is a total technocrat control freak
[10:55.440 --> 11:03.840]  who wants full a jenna 21 implemented through the nsa bureaucracy tracking everything you do
[11:03.840 --> 11:10.560]  taxing you for salt alcohol fat uh but letting you eat gmo letting you eat all the garbage just
[11:10.560 --> 11:15.760]  just calling all fat bad all salt bad uh just absolutely micromanaging your life i've read
[11:15.760 --> 11:21.200]  statements by him in a profile that was out last year we read the quotes on air we said i do want
[11:21.200 --> 11:26.960]  to control your life i do know best i am super smart i love data i've got access to all this
[11:26.960 --> 11:32.320]  corporate and government data and i want to help you and you can just look at bloomberg a
[11:32.320 --> 11:39.760]  sinisterly wicked person very very dangerous and so i wanted to open the show up today
[11:39.760 --> 11:48.160]  just reminding you that here's a top republican appointed by obama to be secretary of defense
[11:48.880 --> 11:58.640]  for five years first five years and here he is endorsing bloomberg who they call an independent
[11:58.640 --> 12:05.840]  bloomberg because they know democrats are unpopular bloomberg is is is literally left of
[12:05.840 --> 12:12.080]  joseph stalin if you want to use the left right paradigm gauge of course a fat cat insider
[12:13.040 --> 12:22.240]  ponzi scheme maven is going to be for tyranny these people are thug gangsters like chris christy
[12:23.200 --> 12:29.360]  and like bill clinton all of them they are predators and the sooner people wake up to that the better
[12:29.360 --> 12:38.080]  it's that simple and they are going to activate their agents in the new media as they've said
[12:38.080 --> 12:44.400]  they'll do with cast unsteen and others they are going to activate uh the era on a huffington
[12:44.960 --> 12:50.320]  a takeover of alternative media and the funding of infighting you're going to see all hell break
[12:50.320 --> 13:00.000]  loose in made-up stories and attacks and sabotage and demonization campaigns of any real media
[13:01.120 --> 13:04.800]  that opposes the takeover and that goes for mainline conservative talk radio
[13:05.680 --> 13:10.560]  because it's calling out chris christy and others because their listeners won't put up with it
[13:10.560 --> 13:16.000]  their listeners are awake and so even sellout establishment republican hosts are becoming
[13:16.000 --> 13:23.360]  libertarians because as the financial times of london reported two days ago libertarianism constitutionalism
[13:26.240 --> 13:33.920]  freedom is taking over real liberalism is taking over not the counterfeit authoritarian
[13:33.920 --> 13:39.840]  progressive cancer and the republican party establishment the democratic party establishment
[13:39.840 --> 13:44.560]  are on record in every one of their meetings and in their private meetings that leak over and over
[13:44.560 --> 13:49.040]  again it's in the news every week panicking saying we've got to shut down the tea party
[13:49.840 --> 13:54.480]  and so the national association of manufacturers the national association of you know the business
[13:54.480 --> 14:00.720]  associations all the republican front groups are pouring more money into smashing the tea party
[14:00.720 --> 14:04.800]  than they are into democrats the democrats are pouring their money in the republican groups
[14:04.800 --> 14:08.880]  are pouring their money in because they are the criminal groups that have taken over they will
[14:08.880 --> 14:15.680]  loot everything to the ground they will not stop they cannot stop it's like once you cut yourself
[14:15.680 --> 14:23.840]  in a brazilian river and the and the piranha smell blood you can swim with piranhas but if you
[14:23.840 --> 14:30.240]  cut yourself on a rock or a piece of glass one of them is going to bite you and then they're
[14:30.240 --> 14:34.400]  all going to bite you and folks we're being chewed to death by piranhas right now they're not going
[14:34.400 --> 14:41.760]  to stop until they eat us down to the bones they will eat us down to the bones and societally a
[14:41.760 --> 14:46.400]  10-year period is like the blink of an eye so right now the piranhas have already basically
[14:46.400 --> 14:50.800]  chewed giant holes in us we're reaching terminal level they're about to get into the organs
[14:53.040 --> 15:01.040]  and we better jump to the shore if we've got any chance of living and the shore is common sense
[15:01.040 --> 15:06.640]  bill of rights constitution getting right with god and look even if you're an atheist whatever just
[15:07.440 --> 15:12.720]  decide that you don't want to go along with this and and and decide you're going to resist it
[15:15.360 --> 15:19.520]  me personally i couldn't handle all the stuff that's going on if it wasn't for my relationship
[15:19.520 --> 15:27.920]  with christ now let me just get into the top story right now we've been talking a lot about this
[15:27.920 --> 15:34.080]  in the last really six years but but but now it's open and it's the point where the dictatorship
[15:34.080 --> 15:40.640]  becomes open that if they get away with it obama could become a dictator and stay in office but
[15:40.640 --> 15:45.840]  the bureaucracy wants the office to be dictatorial and every constitutional lawyer left right in the
[15:45.840 --> 15:51.760]  center worth their soul will tell you this is the most dangerous period in us history
[15:51.760 --> 15:57.280]  and obama is effectively a dictator right now we are not just going to be waiting for legislation
[15:57.280 --> 16:02.480]  in order to make sure that we're providing americans the kind of health that they need
[16:03.520 --> 16:10.560]  i've got a pen and i've got a font and i can use that pen to sign executive orders and take
[16:10.560 --> 16:17.600]  executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward okay now he said that two
[16:17.600 --> 16:24.000]  days ago now here is the sacramento be today endorsing this like it's completely normal
[16:24.000 --> 16:35.440]  but also showing some criticism obama is using executive power to affect immigration law it
[16:35.440 --> 16:43.120]  should say obama is using executive orders to circumvent the law in congress historically
[16:43.120 --> 16:47.360]  this is considered to be the beginnings of a serious dictatorship that should be the real
[16:47.360 --> 16:53.760]  headline president barack obama didn't wait for congress to rewrite the nation's immigration
[16:53.760 --> 16:59.680]  laws to help see what's to help to help millions who are in the united states illegally stay in the
[16:59.680 --> 17:07.760]  country and again they're just telling you now what's been going on for a year they've legalized
[17:08.400 --> 17:12.400]  most of the people that were going to be deported and they started with the kids to make it look
[17:12.400 --> 17:17.600]  like well it's for the children now it's moved on under the bills they've introduced the last
[17:17.600 --> 17:23.920]  eight years in a row even under bush felons are legalized aggravated felons rapist are legalized
[17:23.920 --> 17:28.720]  so and again i wouldn't be against a large immigration group coming in if they would vote for
[17:28.720 --> 17:33.680]  guns and vote for liberty they are clients of the democratic party and the republican party
[17:33.680 --> 17:38.400]  the republican party's lobbying for this because they're part of the same globalist program the
[17:38.400 --> 17:42.640]  entire establishment is for open borders do you think that's a good idea let me tell you we've
[17:42.640 --> 17:48.800]  had open borders so far you like your standard of living you like uh the uh folks pulling free
[17:48.800 --> 17:52.880]  welfare to sign a bankrupt the nation so there's just one of the executive actions but it's been
[17:52.880 --> 18:01.840]  ongoing with guns and power plants and wars and circumventing congress and obama care and so he
[18:01.840 --> 18:06.080]  got away with that and what has congress done they came out yesterday and here's the big bad news
[18:06.080 --> 18:10.560]  and i hate to have to give this to you we told you the big test would be what congress try to
[18:10.560 --> 18:17.440]  block this and assert their authority under law no congress said you handle the nsa you decide
[18:17.440 --> 18:22.640]  unilaterally what to do it's already operating illegally congress is into it up to their eyeballs
[18:22.640 --> 18:27.200]  they've passed the buck to obama that's a dictatorship works people give into it
[18:28.400 --> 18:33.920]  because they're cowards and because they're paid off and now he could do anything folks this is it
[18:35.040 --> 18:39.680]  this is it they're going to continue persecuting people with the irs they're going to continue
[18:39.680 --> 18:43.680]  he says he's coming after the guns with executive orders going to outright start banning bullets
[18:43.680 --> 18:49.440]  registration going after gun owners that don't have criminal records it's on he wants to push us
[18:49.440 --> 18:55.120]  into a violent response and i would say keep your powder dry but wait until you see the whites of
[18:55.120 --> 19:01.760]  their eyes really try to not get into this unless you're cornered and have to but i mean they're
[19:01.760 --> 19:05.120]  going to start it they're going to blow stuff up and blame it on us and you can be assured of that
[19:05.120 --> 19:10.080]  that's their major playbook that's what i would do if i was them the only reason they haven't
[19:10.080 --> 19:14.080]  done it yet is because we're exposing them our people are there every time they stage something
[19:14.080 --> 19:18.400]  like the boston marathon event and i just can't believe my incredible responsibility to be here
[19:18.400 --> 19:25.200]  on the air doing this i just i i'm completely blown away uh that we've gotten to this place
[19:25.840 --> 19:30.960]  in history collectively and and that i and our crew is is is one of the main
[19:30.960 --> 19:36.960]  centers of resistance against this and you the listeners of the center of resistance against
[19:36.960 --> 19:45.520]  this uh totally unprecedented um we broke uh last year that microchips in new computers
[19:45.520 --> 19:51.040]  uh hook into the nsa wirelessly uh that's in the new york times today we're going to tell you

[24:39.680 --> 24:45.360]  test for radiation and then a second story that's up on drudge report dot com on the left hand side
[24:45.360 --> 24:51.120]  despite dangerously high radiation levels no caution signs at surfers beach no action taken
[24:51.120 --> 24:56.000]  to protect the public at radioactive hotspot we're gonna be talking to our reporters who've been
[24:56.000 --> 25:01.120]  up and down the west coast and their final report from the road before they fly back to austin today
[25:01.920 --> 25:10.720]  coming up after this break that we are approaching and we're also going to get to another story that
[25:10.720 --> 25:15.120]  originated from info wars dot com and prison planet dot com but the easiest place to find it
[25:15.120 --> 25:22.000]  is drudge report dot com wells fargo to begin charging customers for deposits and we always
[25:22.000 --> 25:27.680]  are careful we put a question mark behind it we have found a whole bunch of these letters that
[25:27.680 --> 25:34.480]  people are talking about where they're basically saying the same thing that jp morgan chase said
[25:34.480 --> 25:40.320]  three months ago that they're gonna start charging you if you're a small business massive amounts of
[25:40.320 --> 25:48.000]  money to be able to deposit cash or outright in some cases not even let you do it just like they
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.320]  won't let you if you have a gun shop or your gun company you can't have business with them the big
[25:52.320 --> 25:56.400]  banks are the ones running the country they don't want small farms operating they're not giving
[25:56.400 --> 26:02.240]  loans on record they got the banking reform stuff passed a few years ago openly to shut down small
[26:02.240 --> 26:08.160]  regional banks that give loans the big banks aren't giving loans they're on record their emails have
[26:08.160 --> 26:13.040]  been released timber wolf and others how they want to bankrupt you how they want to make you
[26:13.040 --> 26:18.800]  poor to control you how they're going to get your guns you better clingers i mean they're enemies
[26:19.680 --> 26:23.360]  i don't know how and i don't mean the people that work for these banks are all enemies these
[26:23.360 --> 26:28.000]  banks all have legitimate divisions that do real things but the people at the top of them it's like
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.720]  it's like police departments the average cop on average and i'm not kissing the police's rear end
[26:32.720 --> 26:39.840]  on this the average cop i've met or known in life has been better than the average joe come over and
[26:39.840 --> 26:45.840]  help you work on your house you know great to go hang out with good trustworthy people it doesn't
[26:45.840 --> 26:50.320]  matter though they got so much power that when you run into a bad one you're in a lot of trouble
[26:51.760 --> 26:58.640]  and the people that are on top are bad folks so all these bureaucracies and things may not
[26:58.640 --> 27:03.280]  have super evil people at the bottom but they got super evil people at the top and that's why
[27:03.280 --> 27:12.160]  they want the the the technocracy where there's zero wiggle room for teachers police you name it
[27:13.760 --> 27:18.320]  to be able to make their own determination everything is basically robotically commanded
[27:18.320 --> 27:24.400]  that's why they want to go to robots and drones in the military but until then they're going to
[27:24.400 --> 27:30.240]  basically make you act like a robot and surveil everything you do and then selectively use it
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.680]  against you sure it'd be great for troops to have cameras on the battlefield and be able to
[27:35.680 --> 27:39.920]  you know integrate all this information into satellites everything but everything they're
[27:39.920 --> 27:43.200]  doing every mistake they make is being put in a database you're not going to have any rights
[27:43.200 --> 27:46.080]  when you get out they're going to threaten you with court marshals that's already the plan
[27:46.880 --> 27:52.400]  it's the same thing for everybody else in society folks this is a nightmare situation
[27:54.560 --> 27:59.040]  now our other big story before i plow back into all of these after we cover the final report
[27:59.040 --> 28:02.960]  the roundup report from the west coast with jacari jackson and the rest of the crew
[28:03.840 --> 28:06.960]  we're going to talk to the rest of the crew when we come back we haven't heard from yet
[28:06.960 --> 28:12.800]  adan salazar's article is again up on drugsreport.com about the increased radiation at surfers beach
[28:13.840 --> 28:20.000]  seven times what it is at the local nuclear power plant but again no warning signs almost no media
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.520]  coverage this is the big story though that i'm going to cover when dr baggages on with us in the
[28:25.520 --> 28:34.800]  next hour nsa unleashed outside of the national journal it's also in the new york times nsa
[28:36.320 --> 28:42.880]  devises radio pathway into computers now i've told you this since the telecommunications act in
[28:42.880 --> 28:47.840]  96 because i had insiders at telecoms tell me how to understand the documents they gave me
[28:48.960 --> 28:53.200]  and then they had the government show up at the radio station threatened people and i was removed
[28:53.200 --> 28:59.520]  off the air i was told don't cover this stuff anymore this is all on record uh or you're going
[28:59.520 --> 29:05.200]  to be removed off the air i mean it was all sorts of stuff happened state agencies federal you name
[29:05.200 --> 29:11.040]  it i later learned i didn't know i didn't learn till i was fired later i was told shut up about it
[29:11.040 --> 29:14.880]  but i mean they were mad because there were all these good people in the system in government
[29:14.880 --> 29:19.040]  and in corporate areas that that this was back when they were denying all this was going on
[29:19.040 --> 29:27.440]  now they're saying that with hundreds of thousands of computers the nsa working with
[29:27.440 --> 29:34.640]  the computer manufacturers the chip makers puts chips in them that are radio transmitter receivers
[29:35.360 --> 29:41.040]  so the nsa can get into it we wrote articles a decade ago and then again last year on this
[29:41.040 --> 29:50.080]  and here's the headline secret 3g intel chip gives spooks and snoops backdoor pc access we're on the

[33:38.000 --> 33:44.640]  i wish none of this was coming true by the minute everything we've documented because it
[33:44.640 --> 33:51.040]  was already on record is now unfolding exactly as we connected the dots and set it would so we
[33:51.040 --> 33:56.160]  didn't predict any of this we just connected dots remember the first connect the dots uh
[33:56.160 --> 33:59.840]  for like two year olds where the dots are right by each other and you can look at it and tell
[33:59.840 --> 34:05.600]  it's a dinosaur tell it's a car tell it's a man on a horse there's really no dots to connect i mean
[34:05.600 --> 34:11.920]  that's how this is there are no dots even to connect there's so many dots and then the globalist
[34:11.920 --> 34:19.520]  brag they're setting up an unescapable inescapable in their words technocracy a digital skin a false
[34:19.520 --> 34:26.400]  virtual reality to enslave us you realize that and it's crazy and then i remember having meetings
[34:26.400 --> 34:32.640]  and parking lots or people would come down to the radio station and back then you know i had no
[34:32.640 --> 34:38.720]  security i just walk out there every night and they'd say i work for this telecom here's this
[34:38.720 --> 34:43.920]  information look in the look in the telecommunications act of last year there's chips in the cable
[34:43.920 --> 34:51.040]  boxes and in the new chips and the computers that are really two-way transmitters that are
[34:51.040 --> 34:57.680]  picking up the data and actually sending it through a simple encryption system and then
[34:57.680 --> 35:06.480]  using advanced classified compression to to send it on to gathering stations in every city
[35:08.240 --> 35:12.240]  and it'd be a you know 65 year old engineer with a pocket protector
[35:12.240 --> 35:17.440]  getting in a brand new Mercedes Benz and driving off and sweating when they would give it to me
[35:17.440 --> 35:23.040]  or i'd go to the rodeo to do a remote and it'd be listen i'm a nurse from the air force in san
[35:23.040 --> 35:27.680]  Antonio the blood goes into a secret database worldwide they've been doing it since 1973
[35:28.640 --> 35:34.080]  listen here's the information but you know just just be safe be safe that's all i can tell you
[35:34.080 --> 35:38.160]  it's biological biological warfare testing they're tracking they're tracking everyone individually
[35:38.160 --> 35:43.520]  i go what are you talking about the research is into how to create a bio weapon to kill only
[35:43.520 --> 35:48.160]  one person that's all i can tell you that's all i know just just everything you're saying is true
[35:48.160 --> 35:53.600]  but worse i mean i mean i would go huh because i was one of the only people on air talking about
[35:53.600 --> 36:01.280]  this military delta force navy seals not because i was something special but because no one else
[36:01.280 --> 36:09.680]  had a venue no one else was willing to say it and that's how we'd have articles in world net
[36:09.680 --> 36:17.520]  daily back in like 1997 98 about you know 15 black helicopters would show up and blow up the police
[36:17.520 --> 36:24.480]  station a day after the police secretly pulled out as a psych warfare test to see how the public
[36:24.480 --> 36:30.720]  would respond in in kingsville and then i go down there and they admit yeah there were foreign troops
[36:30.720 --> 36:35.360]  there yeah we're practicing to confiscate the guns what's the big deal all on tape
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.320]  and of course i knew about it because the head of emergency management for kingsville
[36:42.320 --> 36:48.160]  thomas sanchez who was a army intelligence veteran of vietnam he was a patriot and blew the whistle
[36:48.160 --> 36:52.640]  and contacted us and came on and then got death threats and i never heard from him again i only
[36:52.640 --> 36:57.200]  knew that they'd been hit because thomas sanchez called and they said there's a thomas sanchez the
[36:57.200 --> 37:03.120]  head of emergency management in kingsville on the phone the secretary said not my secretary the radio
[37:03.120 --> 37:07.200]  station secretary i went and got on i went online looked up who he was called the office back got
[37:07.200 --> 37:13.040]  him on through their phone line he's like listen mr jones you know uh we just got hit and and i've
[37:13.040 --> 37:18.480]  got some footage and all this is going on and it's part of a pdd 51 and you need to know what's
[37:18.480 --> 37:24.480]  happening and and then i went and covered it and they had news articles saying it didn't exist later
[37:24.480 --> 37:29.440]  in the local paper and then they had the state police basically start investigating me all
[37:29.440 --> 37:35.760]  because i cared about secret programs to test martial law in america and now we're there and
[37:35.760 --> 37:44.240]  here it is secret 3d 3g intel chip gives snoops backdoor pc access all the new cars have 4g
[37:44.240 --> 37:49.200]  hardwired in black boxes tracking everywhere the head spokesman afford goes all we're tracking you
[37:49.200 --> 37:56.000]  and so are the police ha ha suckers dumb efforts you know the paraphrase uh sucker burg
[37:58.160 --> 38:01.440]  and then everybody freaked out and went no we're not no we're not conspiracy theory conspiracy
[38:01.440 --> 38:08.000]  theory you see how they operate how they act this is all done on purpose so it's all in the new york
[38:08.000 --> 38:15.600]  times oh big breaking news i've told you since 1997 that there were hardwired chips in the phones
[38:15.600 --> 38:20.960]  the many of the cars at that time everything tracking what you do and they had government
[38:20.960 --> 38:27.040]  advanced networks five six seven eight years before you get it before they sell it to you as
[38:27.040 --> 38:35.920]  service 3g 4g 5g they already have it tracking everything and they can energize the chips i was
[38:35.920 --> 38:40.160]  told and i'm not an engineer it's what i was told years ago they can power the chip even though it's
[38:40.160 --> 38:45.360]  hooked into the power on your computer these engineers told me that the radio waves or the
[38:45.360 --> 38:51.120]  transmission waves the microwave waves different systems charge the chips we say that again charge
[38:51.120 --> 38:58.640]  the chips or they have capacitors built in that save power guess what's in the new york times today
[38:58.640 --> 39:04.080]  exactly that but they tell you it's a hundred thousand computers oh that they worked with
[39:04.080 --> 39:10.480]  manufacture they worked with apple and microsoft all these companies to put it in select computers
[39:10.480 --> 39:18.240]  to intercept your delivery oh they intercept it when you order the computer and they add it in
[39:21.600 --> 39:26.080]  because they don't want you to know all the computers have this they want you they don't
[39:26.080 --> 39:31.280]  want you to know that even when the computer's off did i mention that part and that's in paul

[42:52.640 --> 42:59.120]  now let me hit these two articles before we go to jacari jackson
[43:00.080 --> 43:05.760]  the low flying homeland security helicopter to test for radiation chopper will fly at altitude of
[43:05.760 --> 43:09.840]  just 10 stories for years to come the department of homeland security has announced that it will
[43:09.840 --> 43:14.640]  begin periodically flying a large helicopter at extremely low altitudes over baltimore for years
[43:14.640 --> 43:19.600]  to come to detect background radiation in preparation for a nuclear attack they already
[43:19.600 --> 43:23.600]  have these in trucks that are more effective this is all part of a psychological operation
[43:24.880 --> 43:30.960]  they can drive trucks around that that have these spectrometer type machines that pick it up
[43:32.080 --> 43:36.960]  they know full well there's been uh hydrogen bombs inside the russian embassy for decades
[43:36.960 --> 43:42.560]  that was declassified a few years ago this is all just just just just pure cover for helicopters
[43:42.560 --> 43:46.160]  militarily conditioning you and of course the military flying these things are doing a good
[43:46.160 --> 43:52.160]  job they fly over austin all the time you can see the devices hanging off the bottom my whole issue
[43:52.160 --> 43:58.240]  is is that um we have a rogue government doing all sorts of stuff with the nuclear weapons so all
[43:58.240 --> 44:02.320]  of this is just show like they're trying to protect us they gave our missile secrets to the
[44:02.320 --> 44:06.960]  communist chinese they've sold us out on every front they're arming al-qaeda it's all smoke and
[44:06.960 --> 44:12.560]  mirrors now shifting gears despite dangerously high radiation levels no caution signs at
[44:12.560 --> 44:17.760]  surfer's beach no action taken to protect the public at radioactive hot spot this story is on
[44:17.760 --> 44:22.240]  the left hand side again of drudgereport.com it is a don solazar's article that he posted
[44:23.120 --> 44:28.320]  last night with high def photos and video of the crew out there with the geiger counters and to give
[44:28.320 --> 44:34.880]  us a a rounding out report from southern california before they fly back to austin this evening
[44:34.880 --> 44:39.280]  is jakari jackson and they've got another video up there where radiation levels are found on the
[44:39.280 --> 44:43.520]  beach seven times higher than near reactor and we haven't talked to jakari in two days so he's
[44:43.520 --> 44:48.800]  got a lot of breaking info a recap and then we'll get some comments until about five ten minutes
[44:48.800 --> 44:53.760]  into the next hour from the rest of the crew jakari great job breakdown your latest information
[44:54.400 --> 44:57.760]  hey how you doing alex i'm out here dressed in my all black because i feel a little bit like
[44:57.760 --> 45:02.640]  johnny cash we've pretty much been everywhere on this tour we've been to portland oregon we've
[45:02.640 --> 45:06.480]  been to los angeles we've been to long beach we've been to orange county just going all the way up
[45:06.480 --> 45:11.040]  and down the coast and as you pointed out we're here in our final destination san diego california
[45:11.040 --> 45:15.200]  right in front of the coast guard the u.s coast guard out here and alex uh this has been a very
[45:15.200 --> 45:20.320]  interesting trip as you know we started our trip at surfers beach in half moon bay where we found
[45:20.320 --> 45:25.360]  radiation levels in excess of 10 times of what's considered normal not just us but various health
[45:25.360 --> 45:30.080]  professionals people who make geiger counters have gone out there and found similar things as well
[45:30.080 --> 45:35.440]  going north of half moon bay we found radiation levels to be probably around double of what's
[45:35.440 --> 45:41.360]  considered normal about uh the double excuse me the normal is around 30 cps we found cps in excess
[45:41.360 --> 45:47.920]  around 60 or so going north south of half moon bay we found the cps to be about triple just coming
[45:47.920 --> 45:52.080]  down here going through orange county and so forth we saw radiation levels probably around
[45:52.080 --> 45:58.640]  90 cps or counts per minute and so what's that about three times the normal background radiation
[45:58.640 --> 46:03.520]  that's right alex about three times the normal background and radiation but definitely the
[46:03.520 --> 46:08.880]  highest concentration we found was in half moon bay it is way excessive just like adan said in
[46:08.880 --> 46:14.480]  his articles that there is no warning sign out there i mean it's it's a ridiculously high
[46:14.480 --> 46:19.360]  radiation out there but nobody even wants to inform the public luckily the people in half moon
[46:19.360 --> 46:23.760]  bay at surfers beach are pretty informed pretty enlightened people when we talked to them uh
[46:23.760 --> 46:28.400]  just a few days ago so luckily they're abreast of the situation but other than that you wouldn't
[46:28.400 --> 46:33.120]  know that there is radiation going on out there well i've seen a lot of people comment send us
[46:33.120 --> 46:38.320]  links to articles from 20 years ago where uh they reported on dumping decades before that
[46:38.320 --> 46:44.560]  in the 60s and 70s where the navy and others dumped literally thousands of barrels of radioactive
[46:44.560 --> 46:50.160]  waste off the coast i mean why not bury it in the desert it just shows how the government
[46:50.160 --> 46:55.040]  is completely mentally ill completely suicidal and are the last people that should be running our
[46:55.040 --> 46:58.880]  society and so a lot of folks think that's why the radiation's there but undoubtedly they've
[46:58.880 --> 47:06.240]  picked up isotopes as you know uh in the uh wales and dolphins and other marine life and the uh tuna
[47:06.800 --> 47:11.840]  bluefin tuna and others uh that has been three four times what it's supposed to be and does have
[47:11.840 --> 47:16.640]  the different cesium isotopes that are from Fukushima so also alex also alex when we're out
[47:16.640 --> 47:21.040]  here we found out that uh sardines are dying off i believe adan's going to have an article out
[47:21.040 --> 47:26.080]  shortly about that uh we stopped right outside devil's canyon and the guy's got a screen cap
[47:26.080 --> 47:31.600]  of a local news article saying that sardines are disappearing well that's the major university
[47:31.600 --> 47:37.520]  report that came out as you know a few months ago 98 die off in major species in the pacific ocean
[47:38.240 --> 47:45.200]  and uh again it's it's it's a minor footnote in the media uh bottom line jakari uh do you
[47:45.200 --> 47:51.840]  do you think people are waking up out there um for the most part i'd say it's 50 50 when we went
[47:51.840 --> 47:56.400]  to half moobay like i said the people there were very awake they were very receptive of the information
[47:56.400 --> 48:00.720]  we shot a report at the golden gate bridge in san francisco we met a lot of trendies who
[48:00.720 --> 48:04.960]  didn't care about anything but themselves people said that what we were telling them was false i
[48:04.960 --> 48:09.360]  said sir you know we have experts and other people who've gone out there people like steve weiss
[48:09.360 --> 48:13.040]  who makes geiger counters and he found these excessive levels and guys like oh that's a
[48:13.040 --> 48:16.640]  conspiracy theory everybody says i don't want to talk on camera i just want to talk about
[48:16.640 --> 48:21.280]  the san francisco 49ers i just want to talk about a rod i want to talk about beaver fever
[48:21.280 --> 48:25.200]  alex i cannot believe since we've been out here how many times we've heard reports about
[48:25.200 --> 48:30.000]  justin beaver it's ridiculous about him throwing eggs about a rod and his suspension nobody wants
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.120]  to talk about kelly thomas the man who was beaten to death by police it's pretty ridiculous what
[48:35.120 --> 48:38.640]  they're doing out here as far as the media is concerned well you hit the nail on the head and
[48:38.640 --> 48:42.160]  i wish we'd had more time he was gone out and covered that verdict you guys wanted to but
[48:42.160 --> 48:46.320]  i wanted to finish up with the radiation coverage but we'll be covering it more as it unfolds
[48:46.320 --> 48:53.840]  and it you know now we've got a new article in oklahoma where a death man uh did not hear the
[48:53.840 --> 48:59.200]  police commands over the bullhorn uh to get out of his vehicle so they beat him almost to death
[48:59.200 --> 49:05.440]  oh my god i mean it's just getting crazier and crazier and crazier because they want the police
[49:05.440 --> 49:10.240]  to attack us if we don't follow their orders so that we're intimidated and we'll follow illegal
[49:10.240 --> 49:15.520]  unlawful orders that's exactly right alex you know i'm from oklahoma and that's very disheartening
[49:15.520 --> 49:20.720]  to hear uh we encountered some police yesterday we went to the hyperion waste treatment facility
[49:20.720 --> 49:26.320]  this is just outside the city of los angeles and you know it was so it was so bizarre alex we're
[49:26.320 --> 49:31.440]  out there filming a public building we're standing on a public sidewalk not even on their sidewalk
[49:31.440 --> 49:36.160]  some guy in a you know i thought he was a real police officer he approached us and then i found
[49:36.160 --> 49:39.760]  out once i got closer that he was just a security guy i was like i only want to talk to you then a
[49:39.760 --> 49:44.880]  real police roll up they say sir it's a policy that you can't film this building i say sir is it a
[49:44.880 --> 49:48.880]  policy or is it a law he's like no no there is no law it's just our policy that we don't want
[49:48.880 --> 49:54.720]  you to do that i want to see that video that's huge police tell reporters they can't film nuclear
[49:54.720 --> 49:58.960]  power plant they could go on google earth any of it it's an attack on the first amendment they're
[49:58.960 --> 50:03.920]  trying to make photography illegal by fiat what ended up happening with that jacari i can't wait
[50:03.920 --> 50:08.000]  to see that footage well i believe uh the guys are working on that we'll have that out pretty soon
[50:08.640 --> 50:12.560]  oh i believe it's okay it's already out the guys already uploaded it uh you you can probably check
[50:12.560 --> 50:16.960]  it out pretty soon okay we'll get an article blurbed right now by kit daniels up on info wars
[50:16.960 --> 50:22.480]  dot com i know you guys have been uh shooting and running getting a lot done but this is incredible
[50:22.480 --> 50:28.640]  jacari so how did it end with the police well the police officer uh well first Alex let me backtrack
[50:28.640 --> 50:32.240]  the security guard said you know you guys need to get permission you know and we didn't really
[50:32.240 --> 50:36.400]  want to fight with the guy we still had our shots anyway i was like well who's your your public rep
[50:36.400 --> 50:40.560]  so we can just get our permission real quick and i call the rep and the rep didn't call us back in
[50:40.560 --> 50:45.440]  a timely fashion but in the meantime the police arrived and he gave us the same spiel that the
[50:45.440 --> 50:49.920]  security guard did said you can't film this building i said sir this is not i mean this is
[50:49.920 --> 50:53.600]  you can see this from the street you can see it from google or you can see it anywhere it's freedom

[54:35.760 --> 54:39.360]  going to watch us with google cars they're going to watch us with the nsa illegally

[55:04.640 --> 55:09.680]  over to me i mean come on you know that's illegal what you're saying you know we're just a media
[55:09.680 --> 55:15.280]  agency out here with a flag on our microphone we're not suspicious looking people videotaping
[55:15.280 --> 55:20.320]  and casing and creeping around we're a four-man reporter team standing in front of this doing
[55:20.320 --> 55:25.760]  a report on nuclear power plants but you see the reports now we're mainline satellite trucks
[55:26.480 --> 55:31.200]  will be 200 yards from cops and they'll come over and say get out of here and they'll say no we're
[55:31.200 --> 55:37.120]  the media and the cops will beat them down in chicago in phoenix you name it the government
[55:37.120 --> 55:42.960]  is crazy the government wants to dominate us jacari that we have the video what's going
[55:42.960 --> 55:47.520]  up on info wars dot com in mere minutes uh what else are you going to be breaking because i know
[55:47.520 --> 55:51.760]  you've shot so much you haven't been able to get it all out sardines are dying they're reporting
[55:51.760 --> 55:55.840]  the police are telling you you can't film nuclear power plants there's no first amendment
[55:55.840 --> 56:00.560]  what else is going on we're going to go to don salazar well another thing we saw outside the
[56:00.560 --> 56:05.120]  diablo canyon nuclear facility is a gentleman caught a fresh fish right there in front of us
[56:05.120 --> 56:10.240]  so we pulled out our geiger counter and we measured it in the fish itself hit about 60 cpms counts per
[56:10.240 --> 56:19.280]  minute double of what it's supposed to be in half moon bay what's up so so um radio active fish caught
[56:20.560 --> 56:24.720]  that's right alex that's uh it was very surprising us to see that because we've been
[56:24.720 --> 56:30.400]  testing seafood up and down the coast we've got many fish shops and uh seafood places and all that
[56:30.400 --> 56:35.840]  and the fish we found were at least around 40 or so cpm so i guess you'd say higher than average
[56:35.840 --> 56:40.160]  but not you know abnormally well you know the issue those are those fish are caught in deep
[56:40.160 --> 56:45.440]  water up at the coast is where it's precipitating out did you ever get near a water treatment plant
[56:45.440 --> 56:50.560]  because that's where it really precipitates out yes we went to one uh a little bit north of the
[56:50.560 --> 56:55.360]  city of los angeles uh and we have some footage of that as well we'll try to get out here uh what
[56:55.360 --> 57:01.440]  did you find the higher radiation we found radiation levels to be around 50 or so uh 56 cpms
[57:02.080 --> 57:06.400]  but you were unable to get inside and put it up to the water itself we couldn't get inside we uh we
[57:06.400 --> 57:10.560]  went up to the guard shack because we already had the situation at the high period on plant so we
[57:10.560 --> 57:14.800]  said okay we'll try to be you know civil with the guy we approached him with our cameras running
[57:14.800 --> 57:18.720]  and uh the guy at the guard shack and i said sir you know we're just here we're a media organization
[57:18.720 --> 57:23.680]  we just want to take some levels he said no you have to call our press office and talk to them i was
[57:23.680 --> 57:27.200]  like well you know it's pretty much what we expected them to say but we took the level at the guard
[57:27.200 --> 57:32.960]  shack and now it's hitting around 50 56 cpms guaranteed if you approach further because i got
[57:32.960 --> 57:36.880]  texas reporters who do that a few years ago they actually let them into the water treatment plants
[57:37.440 --> 57:41.600]  we've got to get a tour they won't let us in as media we could sue and make austin do it but we
[57:41.600 --> 57:47.280]  still infiltrated as a tour secretly shot video uh yeah that's a great video yeah we're going to get
[57:47.280 --> 57:52.880]  back in because i want i want to show folks that because the chinese uh fluoride they bring in out
[57:52.880 --> 58:01.680]  of the uh uranium mines uh is where they also uh tend to get a lot of this uh nitrites and things
[58:01.680 --> 58:08.640]  that they well it's a side issue and in in the mining of um fertilizer they get it out of the
[58:08.640 --> 58:13.680]  limestone that also has the uranium in it and raydon and so much more uh all right well jacari
[58:13.680 --> 58:19.360]  stay there uh i'm going to push dr nick baggage i'm sure he's good for this about 15 minutes back
[58:19.360 --> 58:23.680]  let's call him as we're connected via video skype uh and then come back and finish up with jacari
[58:23.680 --> 58:28.560]  and then adan salazar to get his take on everything that's happening and because this is so important
[58:28.560 --> 58:33.440]  and then we'll carry dr nick baggage 15 minutes in the next hour i'm sure he's good with that but
[58:33.440 --> 58:42.080]  call him and confirm we'll be right back stay with us ladies and gentlemen thank you for listening to

[1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:21.440]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:28.720]  doctor nick baggages coming up about 15 minutes to talk about breakaway civilization and what that
[1:00:28.720 --> 1:00:35.680]  means couldn't be a more important topic we're joined by jacari jackson and don salazar jacari
[1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:40.480]  when you get back we'll obviously debrief you here in studio tomorrow or friday
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:46.400]  and for the nightly news but other points you'd like to add before we go to a don salazar who's
[1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:50.720]  part of your team but he's there at the hotel just filed another story you're out there at the
[1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:57.280]  pacific ocean on the beach a scientist baffled by mass sardine die off on the west that just broke
[1:00:57.840 --> 1:01:03.520]  but where are you right now jacari we're in san diego alex we're actually right across the street
[1:01:03.520 --> 1:01:08.560]  from the airport and right in front of the us coast guard back here so i think probably the most
[1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:13.200]  interesting things to me were definitely half moon bay at surfers beach and the good awake people
[1:01:13.200 --> 1:01:18.000]  there some of the negative aspects of it were the trendies pretty much in san francisco who
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:22.240]  didn't care about anything at all also when we were driving up and down the coast we saw some
[1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:28.960]  beautiful coastlines up in oregon i think probably the most appealing man made aspects we saw were
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:32.560]  in orange county where the people there are so trendy they think that they actually own the
[1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:36.480]  beach but we still had to do what we had to do to get the readings we have some guys who are
[1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:40.880]  quite stealthy so we're able to pull that off but just moving up and down the coast it's been a
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:46.480]  great time and hopefully we can educate more people about radiation well absolutely scientists
[1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:51.760]  have confirmed that radiation has been linked to some die-offs of tuna and other things there
[1:01:51.760 --> 1:01:57.200]  was an article out yesterday that radiation in fish is 24 times what's normal they're testing
[1:01:57.200 --> 1:02:03.200]  the kelp and they're testing the kelp now but uh we've got a dawn's headline scientist baffled
[1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:08.400]  by mass sardine die-off on west coast mystery mystery fuels concerns that radiation already
[1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:13.280]  made its way across the pacific ocean um that that's a great headline we're going to go to a dawn but
[1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:19.440]  two years ago a year after they admitted that they caught fish with high radiation off the
[1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:26.480]  san diego coast so it the radiation's been making its way increase radiation is now making its way
[1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:30.720]  across so i want to be clear with everybody fukushima radiation has been hitting
[1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:36.640]  three months after fukushima it was hitting the west coast uh weeks after it hit via the air
[1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:42.000]  and was picked up in the atmosphere so it's a great article by don salazar we're going to go to now
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:47.200]  but we're going to add some links in there about where it has uh already uh reached uh there but
[1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:51.920]  we're trying to draw attention to this thank you so much chikari jackson thanks alex all right and
[1:02:51.920 --> 1:02:55.360]  stay there i'm going to come back to the next segment think of anything else you want to cover
[1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:58.720]  because i know you'll think of things you didn't get to so much has happened we haven't talked to
[1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:03.040]  you in two days after i finish in this segment a little bit of the next with a dawn a dawn you're
[1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:08.000]  getting a lot of articles out your story's up on drudge and makes a lot of sense that if you're
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:13.760]  going to have you know signs out about jellyfish or riptides why not tell people that it's been
[1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:21.040]  recorded 1400 higher radiation by san francisco than it's supposed to be um but uh shifting years
[1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:26.800]  into uh what we've seen in the last week of you guys being out there what's your bottom line
[1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:34.800]  i guess the bottom line really is alex that uh there is a concern out here there should be at
[1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:43.440]  least that something is going on you know maybe not so much up the coast from surfers beach but
[1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:50.800]  further downwards we found at least 100 cpm 100 miles away from surfers beach like further down
[1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:57.520]  the coast so definitely there is a concern if there is a concern if radiation levels should
[1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:04.480]  typically hover around 30 cpm i think uh scientists should be and then news media should be covering
[1:04:04.480 --> 1:04:08.560]  this i don't understand why they're not well i know you're following these reports quickly and
[1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:14.560]  doing a great job um and i understand we want to be careful about this but as your editor i guess
[1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:20.320]  here on air uh the article says mystery fuels concerns that radiation has already made its
[1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:27.680]  way across the pacific ocean you know the issue is is that it fuels concern that rate that increased
[1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:33.360]  radiation after three years of Fukushima buildup is killing the sea life you know i mean i think
[1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:38.160]  the concern is that radiation is killing them and causing the mass die-offs we know radiation
[1:04:38.160 --> 1:04:43.600]  has made its way across and the new waves hitting so uh i mean i'm proud of the fact that our reporters
[1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:48.240]  don't sensationalize this but uh i want to talk about that with you when we come back
[1:04:48.240 --> 1:04:52.960]  and also get your take on the fact that the mainstream media still isn't covering this
[1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:57.040]  what was it like when the police said you couldn't be outside a nuclear power plant all this and more
[1:04:57.040 --> 1:05:05.120]  with it on salazar the facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic members
[1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:10.480]  of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the american people so
[1:05:10.480 --> 1:05:16.720]  why are the social engineers adding it to the water simple dumb down the host population that the
[1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:21.840]  parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water
[1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:27.120]  supply yet but we can help to get it out of our bodies i am extremely excited to announce the

[1:08:21.440 --> 1:08:29.920]  well scientists are reporting massive die-off of sardines part of the 98 percent die-off in the
[1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:36.000]  northern pacific ocean being reported by major universities adan salazar has just posted an
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  article up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com detailing that jacari jackson the crew i
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:48.080]  want to talk to uh as soon as some of the other crew get back with jacari they are out there in
[1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:55.520]  san diego right now despite dangerously high radiation levels no caution signs at surfers
[1:08:55.520 --> 1:09:02.240]  beach where they found 1400 higher radiation levels and now that's up by san francisco they're
[1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:11.760]  now down in southern california picking up between 50 micro rims and 90 micro rims it's a big deal when
[1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:18.160]  it's 90 micro rims that means there's some heavily radioactive stuff out there and they're picking up
[1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:24.080]  the universities are man-made isotopes that is isotopes for man-made reactions they're picking up
[1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:28.880]  regular background radiation being up i guess from earthquakes put a lot of scientists think
[1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:33.280]  but we are here to draw attention to this they finally had two or three newspapers
[1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:38.960]  cover the fact that we're forcing coverage of this and that's why we're there but adan you've
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:45.440]  now been up and down the west coast up to portland back down to southern california uh one of the most
[1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:51.680]  important points up there is an info wars reporter uh and writer that you'd like to relay to folks what
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:56.880]  is it like having the police come and say on public property on a sidewalk you can't film
[1:09:56.880 --> 1:10:03.440]  a nuclear reactor you know that's behind fences i mean this is what you see in a third world third
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:08.080]  world dictatorship and and and what are some of the other highlights of your reporting that you
[1:10:08.080 --> 1:10:16.160]  think you'd like to tell folks well uh i wasn't really there when jacari got confronted by the
[1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:21.360]  police but as soon as they got into the car and told me about that i asked if we were living in
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:27.360]  north korea uh i was definitely a violation of the first amendment if i would have been there i
[1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:33.920]  would have definitely uh kept the camera rolling since we were on a public sidewalk uh some important
[1:10:33.920 --> 1:10:41.120]  part uh points i wanted in part to the viewers is that uh there's not so much uh radiation
[1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:47.760]  going up from surfers beach but it's still double the amount that should be allowed however further
[1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:55.040]  south from surfers beach it it is going up of almost we found like 112 cpm which cpm is accounts
[1:10:55.040 --> 1:11:00.160]  per minute the geiger counter kind of picks up ionizing radiation which in my article from
[1:11:00.160 --> 1:11:07.760]  yesterday i pointed out that the epa says causes cancer uh so we're not concerned with this
[1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:12.560]  radiation that's causing cancer i don't i don't get it i don't that's why i wrote the article
[1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:18.800]  about uh no radiation sure sure well that's why you're there is is that i want to know for my
[1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:25.200]  family i want to discover what's going on i want to understand this and it's part of a larger culture
[1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:29.600]  again of hey are you concerned about increased radiation at the golden gate bridge no i like
[1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:35.120]  justin beaver and they don't understand justin beaver a guy that literally looks like he's
[1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:42.000]  got a diaper on just a nobody idiot they have force fed people when i'm out in california
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:46.960]  it's like you're in a bubble all the media culture all the dumbing down is like intensified four or
[1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:56.160]  five times and people really care about celebrities to a point of mental illness and then meanwhile
[1:11:56.160 --> 1:12:00.240]  you know they'll sign a petition to arrest all gun owners and put them in fema camps they'll
[1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:05.280]  they'll they'll sign a petition to make obama dictator and then yeah we're gonna make him
[1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:10.000]  dictator and arrest the tea party i hear you have good let's arrest them i mean what do you call
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:14.640]  there's a lot of good californians but they're a minority what would you call these people
[1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:21.440]  they're beyond trendies i mean what are these creatures i don't know i was thinking we could
[1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:26.640]  film a zombie movie here if we want it's to actually now adon i've been asking some of the
[1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:35.200]  questions what are key points you want to report to folks well basically you should be aware that
[1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:40.640]  there's radiation uh stewing there's it's you're surrounded by it you've got to uh i would say
[1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:46.240]  get some geiger counters if you can invest in that uh just start making sure all your food is safe
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:53.280]  because uh what we found everything was about above 30 cpm which is the normal level uh one
[1:12:53.280 --> 1:12:59.440]  banana we tested was like at 28 so that's a little bit below the normal level but everything like those
[1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:07.120]  fish that we uh jukari said we saw some fishermen catch off a diablo uh canyon nuclear power plant
[1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:13.200]  that was 60 and that kind of startled us you know it's like well why is the fish so high you know
[1:13:13.200 --> 1:13:18.160]  but yeah definitely people need to start checking uh the radiation levels and if they could buy a
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:23.600]  geiger counter i guess it's kind of like uh impractical but i was thinking i kind of want one
[1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:29.120]  now after doing all this sure well you folks can all borrow the office ones we've bought three field
[1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:34.400]  meters as they call them in one geiger counter as they do as you said they both pick up radiation
[1:13:34.400 --> 1:13:41.200]  but different ways uh to gauge it but both are scientific and again just by drawing attention
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:44.960]  to this we can begin to turn things around the even if you have a doubling of the background
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:50.800]  radiation or a tripling not a seven times or ten times like you guys found that the issue
[1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:56.240]  is with sardines or fish they keep eating other little fish and plankton and little single cell
[1:13:56.240 --> 1:14:02.080]  organisms that are picking up the radiation and then it builds up in them just like mercury builds
[1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:08.320]  up in a fish and this is a big deal that we have this sardine die off and and then scientists are
[1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:12.880]  baffled and then meanwhile you guys are at the beach see a guy catch a fish you walk over and it
[1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:20.320]  has high radiation levels where was that where did that happen that was in avila beach california
[1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:27.360]  off off of like hartford pier near the diablo can nuclear power plant well amazing well thank you
[1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:31.680]  so much adan salazar will continue to watch uh and read your reports the video reports and text
[1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:35.680]  reports coming up and uh thank you for going out there to cover this anything else you'd like to add
[1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:43.040]  adan uh just i want to thank the viewers for uh supporting us and you know uh it's not a plug
[1:14:43.040 --> 1:14:48.480]  but you know maybe you might want to think about investing in nation iodine i take it every day
[1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:52.960]  and i feel a lot safer being out here being you know knowing that i've taken it so by the way i
[1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:56.800]  didn't tell you to plug that but that's a good idea why be ashamed of the fact that we have the best
[1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:02.800]  nation iodine out there i believe i've done the research i take it uh almost all the crew that's
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:09.280]  taken it says they felt dramatic uh results just with their acuity uh health energy you name it i
[1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:13.200]  fact adan i've never asked you this but it is one of our main products that helps from the operation
[1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:19.680]  info wars life survival shield info wars life dot com i'll just ask you i mean i guess i'll go out
[1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:23.920]  here naked on this and not know what you're gonna say how long have you been taking it and what has
[1:15:23.920 --> 1:15:32.160]  it done i've been taking it since we got it in shipping in the shipping department and the some
[1:15:32.160 --> 1:15:38.720]  of the first few days i after taking it i really felt like i was detoxing it felt almost immediate
[1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:45.920]  i could feel weird like you know like you say it's it is like a mental clarity but yeah like
[1:15:46.560 --> 1:15:52.400]  it makes you feel like you are detoxing at first but after that you know i guess it's your thyroid
[1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:57.440]  absorb absorbing all all the uh iodine well sure i mean we've got the recommended dose on the back
[1:15:57.440 --> 1:16:01.840]  i'm not going to tell folks what i do but the fact is when you take enough of it you feel you
[1:16:01.840 --> 1:16:07.840]  actually feel the thyroid puff up and and and actually detox it's just amazing well adan
[1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:12.560]  salazar thank you so much so so uh finishing that point you say i mean we're doing a plug near a
[1:16:12.560 --> 1:16:16.720]  plug now i guess why not you brought it up so at first you detox that's what happened to me the
[1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:24.080]  first month uh then what happened i i've i've even given it to my roommates and they just keep
[1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:30.800]  keep on taking it it's just i think it's a piece of mind because you know iodine's been removed for
[1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:35.600]  most of the foods and the only way you're getting it is through uh you know salt now and if you're
[1:16:35.600 --> 1:16:39.200]  not eating salt you're not getting the proper amount of iodine you need and then that's the
[1:16:39.200 --> 1:16:44.400]  bound chemical type this is the real elemental nascent atomic type that just goes right into
[1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:48.480]  the blood that's why it's it's so amazing thank you very much adan look forward to seeing you back
[1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:53.840]  tomorrow look forward to seeing you too all right let's get a final comment from chicari and the
[1:16:53.840 --> 1:16:58.000]  crew we're going to go to break and come back with dr nick baggage who'll be with us 20 minutes
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:03.600]  into the next hour talking about breakaway civilization chicari uh is glenn trolls and the
[1:17:03.600 --> 1:17:08.560]  rest of the crew there yes and also alex we have a viewer come on in here sir he just walked up
[1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:13.200]  spontaneously sir uh what's your name what brought you out here you guys because i had to come and
[1:17:13.200 --> 1:17:17.600]  say hi to chicari the man and the crew and everything and i live five miles from here and i'm really
[1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:20.800]  worried about all this well sir you're the man because you support our broadcast you have the
[1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:25.360]  t-shirts on you're the one out there spreading this information so you live five miles from here
[1:17:25.360 --> 1:17:30.160]  and when you first heard about the news at half moon bay at surface beach what was your response
[1:17:30.160 --> 1:17:33.840]  i wasn't surprised because i knew it's all coming here i'm just glad you guys are there because i
[1:17:33.840 --> 1:17:38.720]  don't have my own geiger counter right now but i got a couple things uh at home that register some
[1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:42.880]  radiation but i don't think it's strong enough right now to register on those yeah well i'll
[1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:47.520]  tell you sir the the strongest radiation we found was definitely at half moon bay it's it is a little
[1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:52.080]  bit stronger down here it's probably about triple of what it's supposed to be but thus far you don't
[1:17:52.080 --> 1:17:56.080]  have as much to worry about as those people up there but you should still try to protect yourself
[1:17:56.080 --> 1:18:00.560]  and what will you do to try to keep yourself safe well i'm off of you stay on that nasa night and i
[1:18:00.560 --> 1:18:04.640]  got a couple 10 more bottles coming see see alex this is what happens you know you come out and you
[1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:08.880]  meet real awake people and this man's going to protect himself so this isn't going to be one
[1:18:08.880 --> 1:18:13.040]  of those guys you know begging for obama care to come and save him he's going to take care of himself
[1:18:13.040 --> 1:18:17.040]  big sturdy gentleman right by the way i mean we're doing reports out there and every time you're
[1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:20.800]  out there doing a live event even there's only 10 people walking by one of them's a listener but we
[1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:26.080]  did not plan this no we're going to stay this fellow is a conspiracy and we had him pop up out there
[1:18:26.080 --> 1:18:31.280]  look at this shirt this is a worn shirt this is an old shirt i bought this a while ago and it's
[1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:36.320]  been around and the last guy who saw me in uh cbs he came up and he's like i like that shirt
[1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:42.800]  and uh well i mean the illustration here is he got too worked up what's amazing is is that is
[1:18:42.800 --> 1:18:47.520]  that's how big this show is we are the new media we are the real media get a comment from this fellow
[1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:51.840]  about his take on the new world order okay sir what are your thoughts on the new world order
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:56.960]  it's just terrible i mean they're just pulling the wool over all of our eyes well not all of
[1:18:56.960 --> 1:19:01.680]  ours but most of us and um it's going to take a lot of us to wake up and it's happening though
[1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:05.440]  but at least you're awake and now you can go and you can wake up other people just like we saw the
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:09.520]  people in half moon bay there's one lady then it was two guys and then it was three guys and the lady
[1:19:09.520 --> 1:19:13.520]  said my friend's hair is falling out so i'm gonna get on this and that's how it starts just one guy
[1:19:13.520 --> 1:19:17.760]  can make a difference and it was one guy alex that went out to half moon bay at surface beach with
[1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:22.000]  geiger counter and now look at the people that are coming awake at this ask this fellow in closing
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:25.600]  the round of times jacar i'll get all the crew and studio tomorrow the next day and be brief
[1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:30.640]  of everybody so uh you know we're not thousands miles apart but asking did he see you on a live
[1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:34.880]  feed and come out there or did he see you in person all right sir final question did you see
[1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:38.560]  us on a live feed and come out here or did you just come out here spontaneously i knew you guys
[1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:41.840]  were going to be out here all week and then i'm just listening to you and jacar he's like hey i'm
[1:19:41.840 --> 1:19:47.200]  in front of the airport and i said all right i'm in my car i was here five minutes later i'm so happy

[1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:10.240]  over at my patriot supply several years ago matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:14.480]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlottans willing to sell us out
[1:23:14.480 --> 1:23:20.640]  for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by patriots for patriots was born my patriot
[1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:26.640]  supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities
[1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:32.000]  and employ over 50 hardworking american men and women it is rare to find companies who practice

[1:24:40.480 --> 1:24:44.000]  nick baggages is going to be with us 20 minutes to the next hour and i really appreciate him giving
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:50.320]  us his time he's in hawaii right now doing research he's the eldest son of the late u.s congressman
[1:24:50.320 --> 1:24:56.160]  from alaska nick baggages senior and political activist peggy baggages he is well known for
[1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:02.160]  leading native groups in alaska he's also known for leading states rights he's really a populist
[1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:07.840]  he's also known for being a best-selling author and filmmaker and i'm not going to go over all the
[1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:13.600]  rest of his letters because he's no stranger to the informed population out there he received his
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:19.520]  doctor of medicine for independent work in health and political science from the open international
[1:25:19.520 --> 1:25:25.440]  university of complementary um medicines uh and he's got a bunch of other degrees i'm not going to
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:32.240]  get into all of that but what he's really known for is exposing the breakaway civilization the
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:39.040]  technocracy that is engineering the entire world with backdoors trojan horses and and systems of
[1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:44.640]  control to then merge humans with machines create a new species forcibly reduce world population
[1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:50.960]  and he documents with the patents and the actual government documents and it's testified to be
[1:25:50.960 --> 1:25:59.040]  with congress and the eu parliament and uh you name it on these issues nsa you name it and i'm
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:04.400]  not building them up here i'm just giving you the facts because we've got so much breaking news here
[1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:09.680]  dealing with all this and all these attempts to control human consciousness and dumb us down
[1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:16.560]  vaccines in the food nanotech uh chips inside your computers that are radio controlled we told
[1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:20.800]  you that years ago now it's in the new york times today we're going to cover it all with him today
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:26.080]  first get his take on the increasing radiation on the west coast even up to alaska uh the sardine
[1:26:26.080 --> 1:26:33.120]  die-offs up to um 1400 higher radiation off san francisco confirmed by the health department
[1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:38.880]  saying it's no big deal and then i want to get his take again on the fact that he says electromagnetic
[1:26:38.880 --> 1:26:44.400]  mind manipulation is their main focus not chemical and biological even though that's what we know a
[1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:50.560]  lot about so he joins us to talk about the technocracy that's gone from being in the shadows
[1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:56.080]  when he was covering it 20 years ago to being now much of it out in the open because it's it's
[1:26:56.080 --> 1:27:02.400]  it's now absorbing the old system and at that point it has to reveal itself earthpulse.com
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:07.520]  is the website and you can find his books and films on that site dr baggots thank you so much
[1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:12.240]  dr baggots thank you so much for coming on with us hey thanks for having me alex it's always good
[1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:18.560]  and it's been a little while since we we've been on with you just um a quick rundown i've been uh
[1:27:18.560 --> 1:27:26.080]  in hawaii the last week or so and i've been using a uh rattler 100 which does the alphabeta gamma
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:32.720]  and x-ray radiation detection it's a really good device but um i'm not seeing any big changes
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:37.200]  in the background radiation here at the moment that's good that is not happening but we're
[1:27:37.200 --> 1:27:44.320]  running about six to uh to uh 11 counts per minute which for here is is pretty normal over the last
[1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:50.480]  few years i've been been watching that in alaska i'm a little bit interior not so much on the coast
[1:27:50.480 --> 1:27:56.080]  but our coastline is really huge in fact it's bigger than the west east and gulf coast combined
[1:27:56.080 --> 1:28:03.280]  the alaska coastline so very very little of it has been uh looked at at least by anybody independent
[1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:09.120]  and so just the south central portions around anchorage and that background is around 20 rads
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:14.960]  or counts per um what is the normal because i've read between 15 and 20 and i know you're more of
[1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:20.320]  an expert on this but the average reading we're getting in california is around a 90 yeah that's
[1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:25.280]  high um compared to the background but something else that people don't realize is that at higher
[1:28:25.280 --> 1:28:32.240]  elevations you actually get a higher count per minute in fact coming over here just as you know i
[1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:38.320]  tested the device at 31 000 feet you know getting up to the cruise levels of um airliners and there
[1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:46.160]  you get between 380 and 420 counts per minute which is huge but that's normal you know years
[1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:52.240]  ago back in the 90s i also uh did this in some trips going across to europe i got as high as
[1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:58.720]  600 uh counts per minute using um one generation back from the current device that i'm using now
[1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:04.320]  but this is a military spec uh detection device and what people don't realize is if you travel a
[1:29:04.320 --> 1:29:09.840]  lot your pilot your steward steward stewardess on an airplane you're getting hit with a lot of
[1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:15.600]  radiation day in day out for hours on end um and most people are pretty unaware of that
[1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:22.480]  all right well dr baggots we're going to go to break a long 18 minute segment i'm going to give
[1:29:22.480 --> 1:29:26.640]  you the floor to talk about whatever you think's most important front and center right now the
[1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:31.200]  nsa scandal all the news breaking but then i want to get into the breakaway civilization that's
[1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:35.360]  what i call it i've heard other people call it that i want to get your take on that because
[1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:41.520]  i would say your work if i had to crystallize it and condense it is exposing the shadow breakaway
[1:29:41.520 --> 1:29:48.720]  corporate governmental uh technocratic uh system i mean basically they're creating a new system
[1:29:48.720 --> 1:29:56.560]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:30:00.560 --> 1:30:05.280]  alex jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the entire
[1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:10.800]  planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is to shut down
[1:30:10.800 --> 1:30:16.240]  societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover that's why
[1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:21.600]  we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at info wars shop dot com
[1:30:21.600 --> 1:30:27.200]  these are items that i did research on that i personally use you've got the life straw so you

[1:31:00.480 --> 1:31:06.560]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen
[1:31:06.560 --> 1:31:13.200]  bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the halogen family
[1:31:13.200 --> 1:31:19.280]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[1:31:19.280 --> 1:31:25.760]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the
[1:31:25.760 --> 1:31:32.480]  results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously
[1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:39.120]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base
[1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:44.640]  nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family you will find survival shield nascent

[1:32:10.720 --> 1:32:15.360]  my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern mexico where the tiapas farmers
[1:32:15.360 --> 1:32:20.320]  grow their unique shade grown arabica beans we have now managed to secure these sought after
[1:32:20.320 --> 1:32:27.840]  beans in a highly customized blend discover and try a bag of the patriot blend 100 organic coffee

[1:33:08.960 --> 1:33:16.800]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[1:33:16.800 --> 1:33:28.400]  doctor nick baggages our guest i'm your host alex jones and we're becoming passe to a great extent
[1:33:30.160 --> 1:33:33.520]  and by that everything he talked about i talked about from the documents
[1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:41.200]  in the last 20 years myself 18 and more than 25 years really is now out in the open
[1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:49.440]  maybe 50 percent of it exactly as we detailed it has now come out but the other 50 percent that
[1:33:49.440 --> 1:33:55.120]  we've told you about or more has not come out yet but they are transferring dictatorial power the
[1:33:55.120 --> 1:34:02.560]  republicans are uh to obama on the nsa on obama care on borders and of course it's not about
[1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:07.120]  obama folks it's that the power structure wants this and this is happening in japan this is
[1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:13.440]  happening in germany this is happening in europe dictatorial movements an arms race technologically
[1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:19.360]  to dominate domestic populations siphoning off more than three quarters of our resources
[1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:24.800]  to put it into secret projects and then jacking all the telecommunications all the phones all
[1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:30.400]  the computers into systems to surveil and control and tax us people say well i don't care if you
[1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:36.160]  surveil me i'm nothing to hide again it's like a gazelle saying i don't care if a lion surveils me
[1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:41.520]  i know nothing to hide well the the lion wants to eat you doesn't care that you're not bad
[1:34:42.320 --> 1:34:47.120]  the gazelle's like i'm not robbing banks i'm not kidnapping children i why should i worry
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:53.760]  of that lion's looking at me and surveilling me and and stalking me we're being stalked by predators
[1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:59.680]  and here's some of the headlines shooting for the moon google hopes to own the future
[1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:06.720]  that's obama's slogan by the way and that's what they want they are engineering the future
[1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:12.240]  and that having us just accept it and i want dr baggage to chronicle with his expertise
[1:35:12.240 --> 1:35:19.600]  how that battle's going google's reach expands into your home more via 3.2 billion nest acquisition
[1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:23.760]  they're buying everything up it's not just google identity thieves gear up to steal your tax refund
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:30.560]  robomacare what's secret your iphone is sharing about you wall street journal how companies are
[1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:36.400]  tracking you with it yeah they all have a stake at the table so they're all given a stake at the
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:42.400]  table like the ring rates given the the the sub rings by the one ring to be bound to the ring
[1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:48.640]  this this technocracy is is is taking them all together and in the darkness binding them
[1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:54.720]  and again we broke this last year i really broke this 15 years ago 16 years ago with sources
[1:35:54.720 --> 1:36:01.040]  it's longer 1997 talking to telecommunications whistleblowers about how no no no the cable
[1:36:01.040 --> 1:36:06.720]  boxes the cell phones they have chips in them with capacitors or chips that pick up microwaves
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:13.280]  and then they transmit info even when your phone's not on and then we broke last year
[1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:19.120]  secret 3g intel chip gives snoops backdoor pc access even when your computer's off
[1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:24.320]  it's energized by the microwave radiation well what's in the new york times today
[1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:30.320]  nsa devises radio pathway into computers and guess what is accessing your computers
[1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:35.040]  with these chips but this article is a whitewash claiming they put it at the factory
[1:36:35.040 --> 1:36:40.640]  with pre-orders to 100 000 people they wanted to watch oh it's just for them see how they're
[1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:48.560]  doling out the lies titrating the dose of poison this is total criminal organized crime rebellion
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:53.840]  by the ruling technocratic elite this is a thousand times bigger than the manhattan project
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:59.280]  it's system-wide trying to create an artificial reality to forcibly insert us into it now dr
[1:36:59.280 --> 1:37:04.560]  nick baggage i want 80 you agree with that analysis b give us the state of the world
[1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:09.760]  who these people are just your professor as well obviously give us the large view
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:14.720]  then break down what's happening and where you see this battle for humanity and how serious
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:22.000]  this is well it really is uh i think most of it's driven by fear from the elite of people
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:27.120]  really waking up to to what we're potentially capable of this is something that most of the world
[1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:33.440]  fails to recognize uh we followed it as you say 20 25 years we followed the change in
[1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:38.640]  technology and sort of the shift to technology and so much of what was supposed to happen
[1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:43.600]  in this particular period in our history has not happened you know the promises the 1960s to a
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:50.480]  working people that would work less work hours in a work week um live a much higher standard
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:56.160]  living all that is myth the there's very small percentage of population that have achieved that
[1:37:56.720 --> 1:38:01.760]  and usually and usually and ultimately on the backs of the masses and even in the united states
[1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:07.760]  where the happy talk about an improving economy escapes most americans because most americans
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:12.960]  sitting at a level of income that was much less than they were uh years ago in terms of real dollars
[1:38:12.960 --> 1:38:18.240]  when you look at the bigger picture from this standpoint of controls that's what we've been
[1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:23.760]  reporting on uh for years how technology can either serve us or work against us and unfortunately
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:28.960]  it has really worked against us when you think about massive data collection of the books we
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:34.000]  published in the past angels don't play this part that people got a lot of information from
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:38.240]  but one of the more important books that people kind of ignored and and maybe it was the title
[1:38:38.240 --> 1:38:43.200]  it's earth rising the revolution but it's on all of these technologies that are coming out now
[1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:50.000]  we wrote it in 1999 and uh in 2000 but the surveillance society the idea of using not
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:55.920]  just to monitor activity but then to utilize these very same electronic systems to modify behavior
[1:38:55.920 --> 1:39:02.000]  over large um populations utilizing the very mediums that we depend on um as sort of the
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:07.680]  vehicle for accomplishing that and you know when we get into the whole mind effects issues how
[1:39:07.680 --> 1:39:12.720]  how do what's modern propaganda really mean it's way more than just the information provided in
[1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:18.640]  the way it's framed um there's a lot more going on just when you watch a television broadcast
[1:39:19.200 --> 1:39:25.840]  on most television broadcasts kind of commercial viewing the kinds of propaganda that's obvious
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:31.600]  what isn't so obvious is just a manipulation of the light signal can put someone in a very
[1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:36.480]  suggestive state where you'll take the information in and anchor it as if it were
[1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:43.760]  the reality so reshaping reality is in fact what much of the media really is all about and
[1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:49.600]  I would say it is all about it's about the ultimate form of controlling human behaviors
[1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:55.680]  uh by really attacking the entertainment industry where look at look at the average person's viewing
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:40:02.320]  time um the time that in which we're entertained and it's a significant amount of diversion from
[1:40:02.320 --> 1:40:05.840]  what is really important like you said in California people are more interested in
[1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:11.440]  Justin Bieber than they are about what's going on in their own coastline all of that I think is by
[1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:16.560]  design and at the same time when you look back historically at some of the things that were
[1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:23.600]  discovered particularly about our potential as human beings this became the greatest threat I think
[1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:29.120]  to government organizations but just kind of looking at the broader picture from the standpoint of
[1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:35.360]  resources energy the big issues in the in the news all the time the idea of scarcity on the
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:41.040]  planet I don't agree with that I think this planet is abundant in what it has to offer humanity
[1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:47.040]  and what humanity has to offer this planet we're we're stewards we're not applying that very well
[1:40:48.400 --> 1:40:53.120]  and I think the elitist is afraid I mean these greater systems of control are a reflection of
[1:40:53.120 --> 1:41:00.800]  fear of the average person within a population I agree with you what about big picture because
[1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:06.320]  they brag Ray Kurzweil all of them that they had of googled a technology development that
[1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:11.360]  they're going to be merging with machines that will be like bugs compared to them in the future
[1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:16.240]  and then you see that they are using our money when we buy a car buy a phone whatever to make us
[1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:23.120]  pay for hijacking technology to tax and track us and trace us if we have a cultural awakening to
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:28.880]  this and a backlash they'll have to remove it but we have to admit it's going on first to be able
[1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:32.880]  to do that right and when you think about a controlled and directed society you know the
[1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:39.280]  idea of microcircuits in computers and you'll remember this Alex you know 10 15 years ago
[1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:43.520]  there was a big concern about the V chip you know what they were going to put in computers well he
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:49.280]  did you know it's in all of them there's a back door in every electronic system on the planet
[1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:55.600]  if you can transmit it electromagnetically I don't care whether it's power grids the internet
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:42:00.880]  television radio you can piggyback signals on and you can monitor signals and that's that's the old
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:06.880]  signal intelligence regime really emerging in the early part of the last century with the very
[1:42:06.880 --> 1:42:12.160]  invention of radio but the fact is all electronic communications have been tracked and monitored
[1:42:12.160 --> 1:42:17.760]  and catalogued the problem has always been once you have all this data how do you sort it so now
[1:42:17.760 --> 1:42:22.240]  they're giving it to supercomputers that they believe can actually tell the future and I've said
[1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:26.480]  that for over a decade now they admit that that's actually what they're able to do in mass movements
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:31.680]  so we have to get outside of our routines we have to not just so they can't track us to change the
[1:42:31.680 --> 1:42:38.320]  paradigm they're trying to model the paradigm then add stimuli into it to manipulate the paradigm
[1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:43.520]  that's why they want to be able to gauge us is to then more effectively manipulate us that's why we
[1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:48.800]  have to become aware of the manipulation resisted speak out against it I remember four years ago it
[1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:53.760]  came out in the Associated Press in Minnesota that they were putting in light bulbs that communicated
[1:42:53.760 --> 1:42:58.880]  with the computers in the police department and that also the patent for that said that it could
[1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:06.160]  actually be used to hypnotize somebody I pointed that out people said it wasn't real or data over
[1:43:06.160 --> 1:43:11.680]  power lines where now I've confirmed with engineers the government can have power into your house
[1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:16.720]  interface with chips that are in the new appliances to track what you're doing and people go oh Alex the
[1:43:16.720 --> 1:43:22.480]  electricity isn't spying on us they they are so ignorant it's like people when I first covered
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:27.360]  spider goats 15 years ago would come up to me on the street and say you're a liar even when it was
[1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:34.880]  in CBS news part spider part goat I mean people really need to realize we're not in 1955 right
[1:43:34.880 --> 1:43:39.440]  right you know the idea of technology is way ahead of where where we really think it is when
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:44.720]  you think about supercomputers which I believe the intelligence agencies actually have some versions
[1:43:44.720 --> 1:43:49.040]  of these but the difference let me tell you the difference when you think about computing power if
[1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:54.960]  you look at a modern supercomputer as we think about them not the quantum computers that are
[1:43:55.600 --> 1:44:02.400]  coming but a supercomputer by comparison a quantum computer which is the direction which NSA and
[1:44:02.400 --> 1:44:07.920]  others are headed maybe already there this will increase computing time what what all the people
[1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:14.320]  on the planet working with hand calculators for making a calculation every five seconds for 60
[1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:20.640]  hours you know that's a lot that's what a modern supercomputer can do in a second a quantum computer
[1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:27.760]  can do with that supercomputer can do in a trillion years now think about this from
[1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:32.720]  Pat's standpoint of scale what that means is that every encryption system on the planet
[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:39.280]  with quantum computers are gone the idea of cataloging and organizing all of the information
[1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:45.120]  that's been catalogued and stored so think about a supercomputer of this size a quantum computer
[1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:50.000]  just rolling out in a few seconds grabbing every bit of information on the planet that's been
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:56.880]  stored in any system and collating it in a way that gives you absolute resolution and transparency
[1:44:56.880 --> 1:45:01.120]  over every human being that's ever made an electronic footprint and the Pentagon calls that
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:06.400]  their map of the world yeah now think about it from this perspective and there was a PBS special
[1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:11.200]  on it when you look at the internet as kind of the worldwide mind of the 21st century at least
[1:45:11.200 --> 1:45:17.520]  the beginning of it the predictions as we go forward is that we'll have a wireless worldwide
[1:45:17.520 --> 1:45:24.320]  mind that will connect every conscious intelligent human being together without the networks without
[1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:30.960]  the hardware that we're familiar with this is uh something I think already occurs uh by net by
[1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:37.360]  nature by the way we're created as human beings but here's man looking to override that system and
[1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:41.760]  I think that's been the really the root of a lot of the work that's been done in discovering sort of
[1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:46.640]  what human consciousness is and how to manipulate and control it yeah let's talk about epigenetics
[1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:50.000]  and things for people that don't know where they take 10 generations of chickens that have never
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:55.920]  been outside inside a building then they start projecting clouds a plane a kite the chickens
[1:45:55.920 --> 1:46:00.800]  don't run they've never seen a hawk but when they see a hawk 10 generations down they run
[1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:08.320]  that's epigenetics or what they think is 96 junk isn't it's actually coding of all the race memories
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:13.360]  of the humans before us that's now been proven I think they're going this is going to backfire
[1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:18.640]  when they jack everybody into this that group collective is going to overpower no matter
[1:46:18.640 --> 1:46:23.680]  what these computers do and that's why I think that's just one of the wild cards in this whole
[1:46:23.680 --> 1:46:30.160]  situation right right well you know I mean I I know you know from a from a philosophical background I
[1:46:30.160 --> 1:46:35.200]  I believe absolutely that we're created in the image of a creator which in you know when you
[1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:40.720]  think about that when you contemplate that what suppresses our ability to function that way that
[1:46:41.440 --> 1:46:48.080]  you know and it's this it's this idea of creating a a constant environment of fear and worry which
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:54.080]  the elite have done sufficiently so that people's higher states of awareness higher state to conscious
[1:46:54.080 --> 1:46:59.280]  your rational thinking cannot occur in a state of constant fear you can look at an EEG that measures
[1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:04.400]  brain waves and you can look at that brain wave activity over any of the negative emotions fear
[1:47:04.400 --> 1:47:09.680]  anxiety and you see these incoherent brain patterns that are associated with flight bite responses
[1:47:09.680 --> 1:47:14.320]  these kinds of things if you can keep people in that state just sort of in an underlying state
[1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:19.200]  of agitation you'll never reach these higher states of awareness where you can actually
[1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:25.520]  function in at your creative level when you look at what happens in states of love compassion
[1:47:25.520 --> 1:47:30.640]  empathy you get very rhythmic patterns that are associated with higher-order thinking
[1:47:30.640 --> 1:47:35.040]  both hemispheres both sides of the brain begin to work together which stimulate the analytical
[1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:40.560]  and the creative we start to create solutions and observations and perceptions of the world
[1:47:40.560 --> 1:47:45.920]  that are quite different when you're when you're really being pressed programmed you're not watching
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:50.560]  the television programming you're part of that programming in the way this whole system evolves
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:53.920]  I was about to say I mean look at all the studies coming out where the television
[1:47:54.960 --> 1:47:59.760]  makes other areas of the brain smaller and and and less gray matter but the cerebral cortex
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:05.600]  becomes thicker but but but but actually a lot dumber because it's designed now to just respond
[1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:09.840]  it gets bigger while everything else gets smaller when it's supposed to actually get smaller
[1:48:09.840 --> 1:48:15.280]  everything else gets thicker to then have the brain communicate together that's the opposite
[1:48:15.840 --> 1:48:20.800]  of what we would want to you know do is what they're actually creating and as you know
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:25.200]  they knew in the 50s in studies what the television was doing that's why these people
[1:48:25.200 --> 1:48:30.000]  grown up in front of televisions they don't have brains that can ever really do anything
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:35.680]  but be spectators they are really kind of zombies is there any way to reverse that these people are
[1:48:35.680 --> 1:48:42.240]  brain damaged yeah absolutely um first of all i know it's difficult for people to do it i did it
[1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:46.720]  three and a half years ago i just turned it off you know and and accept programming on a really
[1:48:46.720 --> 1:48:52.320]  limited basis which is more initiated by me rather than thrown at me but the other thing is there's
[1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:57.040]  a lot of things you can do to enhance your human performance at earth pulse dot com we've you know
[1:48:57.040 --> 1:49:01.520]  we've studied that in the book controlling the human mind which i know your program and network
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:06.400]  has carried for years we get into sort of the alternate side of this how do you enhance
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:12.080]  human mental functions so that you can you can be a strong system and sort of avoid some of that
[1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:19.760]  i call it intellectual pollution you know really it is but you can do things you can enhance human
[1:49:19.760 --> 1:49:25.040]  performance in ways that are quite profound in fact i think when i look back on the mind effects
[1:49:25.040 --> 1:49:31.680]  programs of the cia and others going back into the 1950s the real discovery wasn't about sort of how
[1:49:31.680 --> 1:49:36.240]  to create the manchurian candidate although they figured that out too there's a lot of work on that
[1:49:36.240 --> 1:49:42.160]  that you've talked about i've talked about in the past but more importantly and and and more
[1:49:42.160 --> 1:49:47.200]  fearfully for government agencies doing the research was that every human being every single soul
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:52.240]  on the planet had this unique capability that if it could be harnessed if it could be triggered
[1:49:52.240 --> 1:49:58.800]  it makes us all very very powerful that's why they dropped the lsd and hallucinogens
[1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:04.000]  because it wasn't controlling people it was brain boosting them right and when you look at all of
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:08.800]  it you know the research that was done what they discovered were these anomalous human capabilities
[1:50:08.800 --> 1:50:15.200]  that would squirt out or pop out in some unexplained way and then then what was realized is that every
[1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:19.840]  human being could reach these states of awareness and there's i think that's the change you know
[1:50:19.840 --> 1:50:25.520]  when you think about um i did this big conference it was closed it was only experts brought in on
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:30.640]  the mind effects issue when i was working with the lay institute in dallas and what we did there
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:36.320]  and what was interesting is every scientist that appeared had the perception or the belief that the
[1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:42.880]  next leap in human evolution was in fact this idea that we would remember or recognize this
[1:50:42.880 --> 1:50:46.720]  hidden capability that each of us have well sure and the elite understand that and i want you to
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:52.240]  continue your point but but isn't that what's backfiring on the technocrats is that so many
[1:50:52.240 --> 1:50:59.120]  of their own people uh then grasp the research and then don't want to dehumanize humanity
[1:50:59.120 --> 1:51:05.760]  and actually want to embrace humanity and the secret is is that is that the the the not the
[1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:11.040]  lust or even the the seduction because those are the wrong words but the wondrousness of embracing
[1:51:11.040 --> 1:51:18.000]  goodness is such a draw especially in such a dark culture that there's an inner rebellion
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:23.280]  by the brain and the soul itself and a hundredth monkey syndrome for those that don't know
[1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:29.280]  you might tell them what that is yeah you know what you reach a certain um a certain level of
[1:51:29.920 --> 1:51:33.840]  things and they sort of collapse i mean think about the the revolution in eastern europe in
[1:51:33.840 --> 1:51:37.360]  the 90s you know you couldn't really pin down leadership although there was some leadership
[1:51:37.360 --> 1:51:43.280]  around it was a spontaneous recognition of a of change and it occurred very rapidly and
[1:51:43.280 --> 1:51:48.320]  very swiftly i think the same thing can happen um in terms of how people become more aware
[1:51:49.200 --> 1:51:55.120]  scientists from within the programs many of them do have these epiphanies where they recognize
[1:51:55.120 --> 1:51:59.200]  what's going on and they withdraw and you know when we first started our work one of the things
[1:51:59.200 --> 1:52:04.000]  we did and we continue to do is we reach right into the midst of them and and you do it too you
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:09.920]  show up on their doorstep and you put information the hands of people intelligent people and our
[1:52:09.920 --> 1:52:14.960]  work has always been well documented well footnoted and what happens is people change their mind
[1:52:14.960 --> 1:52:20.400]  they change their view of reality and good people um are throughout all of these organizations come
[1:52:20.400 --> 1:52:25.440]  into some state of awareness and begin to turn that knowledge a different direction i think that's
[1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:31.760]  the fifth column of the next revolution uh the revolution of consciousness where we step into
[1:52:31.760 --> 1:52:36.640]  who we are begin to take control of our governments in the way our founding fathers intended as
[1:52:36.640 --> 1:52:42.560]  self actualizing human beings that recognize our connection to one another in a profound way in a
[1:52:42.560 --> 1:52:50.160]  way that only um when we recognize our role in this world as stewards can we truly truly evolve
[1:52:50.160 --> 1:52:54.080]  and i think that's what's going on we got to let go of the fear we got to recognize what we are
[1:52:54.080 --> 1:53:00.080]  begin to look at the technologies that can help us um advance but at the same time recognize
[1:53:00.080 --> 1:53:05.360]  skeptically uh the direction yes sir well there's no doubt if you watch movies like viva vendetta
[1:53:05.360 --> 1:53:10.160]  they they kind of create archetypal images of how authoritarianism really works
[1:53:10.160 --> 1:53:13.600]  where the government's surveilling the public and knows that they're incredibly unpopular
[1:53:14.320 --> 1:53:18.880]  and uh you know they say more fear turn up the fear and you see all this scary news
[1:53:18.880 --> 1:53:23.120]  but the government will save you don't worry i've never been a fear monger but some people
[1:53:23.120 --> 1:53:27.680]  that are in fear misunderstand what i'm doing i'm saying look at the danger of the tyrants
[1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:33.760]  look at what they do look at what they create we should not be afraid of letting them run things
[1:53:33.760 --> 1:53:39.280]  you shouldn't be afraid of of of standing up to them you should be afraid of not standing up
[1:53:39.280 --> 1:53:43.840]  and then and then once people get empowered they realize how much power they have then
[1:53:43.840 --> 1:53:48.480]  they're through the fear and i think that's why i've been unintentionally very effective
[1:53:48.480 --> 1:53:54.480]  is that in my kind of mania or hysteria sometimes because i am concerned i'm able to shake people
[1:53:54.480 --> 1:53:59.920]  out of their their comfort zone what do you say to that i think that's exactly right you know people
[1:53:59.920 --> 1:54:05.120]  are all of us fall into a stupor you know we fall into our routines and it does take that
[1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:10.240]  that's why we have this spread of emotions you know from one end of the spectrum to the other
[1:54:10.240 --> 1:54:16.560]  it is what we are as human beings how we express ourselves how we rise to our own energy and you
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:21.280]  can't do it in a neutral position i i've always appreciated the fact that this is the kind of
[1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:26.480]  information that stimulates people to think again the first step in change is to get the
[1:54:26.480 --> 1:54:32.400]  information and like like you Alex we've been at the public information game an awful long time
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:37.200]  but it does work over time and that's been my observation i wouldn't continue to do it the
[1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:43.120]  fact is people are waking up um yeah things are getting worse some people say well you know it's
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:47.840]  so horrible so terrible but at the same time that's what it takes sometimes most of the time
[1:54:47.840 --> 1:54:52.480]  unfortunately to wake us all up everyone that's got a little bit of repair remembers this you
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:56.960]  know it's in the tough times that you become the strongest human that you are and and that's
[1:54:56.960 --> 1:55:02.240]  where we are as a country where we are as a world right now at that at that doorway that's right
[1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:08.240]  let me raise this point it's in a lisabeth rentner article on info wars.com paradigm change
[1:55:09.040 --> 1:55:13.680]  british docs turn to prescribing books for depression boston gloves reporting on it
[1:55:13.680 --> 1:55:20.240]  raw stories reporting on it natural society uh first reported on it but the issue here
[1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:25.520]  is that i talked to the doctors the scientists you name it and they're like look yeah no big
[1:55:25.520 --> 1:55:30.160]  farmer runs things they want to suppress humanity we know that the prescription psychotropic are
[1:55:30.160 --> 1:55:35.760]  really bad for most people we know reading a book or st john's wort is better and they're just starting
[1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:42.640]  to rebel everywhere and and and learning that big pharma and the regulators don't have all the power
[1:55:42.640 --> 1:55:47.760]  they want to fully take over medicine because they know md medicine is starting to wake up
[1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:53.600]  the fact that all this tyranny is coming in is a desperate action by the jail guards to keep us
[1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:58.960]  chained to the oars well and this is important because when you think about socialized medicine
[1:55:59.760 --> 1:56:05.200]  friends of mine in in europe you know talk to me about it all the time recently a friends lost a
[1:56:05.200 --> 1:56:12.000]  father to cancer well because she might genetically be predisposed she's required to keep her
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:18.080]  insurance to go ahead and get screened for cancer now you know it's kind of an invasive thing but
[1:56:18.080 --> 1:56:22.960]  government has your whole record all your family's record they can't even protect that record
[1:56:22.960 --> 1:56:28.560]  incidentally which no one's talking much about right now but the reality is they then dictate
[1:56:28.560 --> 1:56:35.760]  what becomes a pdr what what is the physician's desk reference of cures and nothing else is permitted
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:41.520]  um it's really a it's again a trojan horse to get you sucked into a system that's a system of
[1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:46.880]  death when you compare what's happening in the united states and medical issues compared to the
[1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:51.920]  amount of money we spend you know this is a death trap in this country the reality is the kind of
[1:56:51.920 --> 1:56:56.560]  accountability that needs to happen in medicine didn't happen and the big issue should have been
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:57:01.360]  that no no pharmaceutical should be sold in the united states for less than it's for more than
[1:57:01.360 --> 1:57:06.000]  it sells in any other country in the world ought to be on party we ought to bargain that hard we're
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:11.680]  the biggest consumer of any prescription drugs anywhere we ought to be bargaining it secondly
[1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:15.680]  we ought to be regulating the advertising on prescription drugs 40 percent of the budget
[1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:20.960]  on prescription drugs is for advertising drugs you can't even buy unless you're a medical professional
[1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:26.160]  shouldn't be allowed any more than alcohol on television is allowed in most venues the reality
[1:57:26.160 --> 1:57:31.440]  is that the industry spends 60 percent of the money is on those prescription drugs when you
[1:57:31.440 --> 1:57:37.040]  look at farm across the united states from all forms of health care that's the problem you know
[1:57:37.040 --> 1:57:41.840]  you can you look at centralized billing and collections no one wants to share the data
[1:57:41.840 --> 1:57:47.840]  if you share the data you could simplify the the insurance claims and actually share it in a way
[1:57:47.840 --> 1:57:52.960]  that you could utilize it for your own health protection the fact is we've done this upside
[1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:57.360]  down instead we've given more power to insurance companies you're giving more power to farm we
[1:57:57.360 --> 1:58:03.360]  get more power to the so-called western sort system of medicine which in my view is greatly flawed
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:09.280]  unless you're breaking bones the reality is we need more individual control of our health care
[1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:13.520]  not more government control of our health care we need more individual control of every aspect
[1:58:13.520 --> 1:58:18.400]  of our lives and we have exactly the opposite happening all right dr baggots we got 20 more
[1:58:18.400 --> 1:58:23.280]  minutes with you i want to get into who the globalist star from your deep research what their
[1:58:23.280 --> 1:58:27.360]  in-game plan is if we don't stop them and what in your gut you really think is going to happen in
[1:58:27.360 --> 1:58:32.640]  the future because we're living in a fantastic science fiction movie the establishment wants to
[1:58:32.640 --> 1:58:37.760]  make it this topic we want to make it a liberty empowered we're going to be right back in the
[1:58:37.760 --> 1:58:51.600]  third hour stay well this is gcn the genesis communications radio network the facts are in
[1:58:51.600 --> 1:58:56.800]  the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family
[1:58:56.800 --> 1:59:02.080]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the american people so why are the social
[1:59:02.080 --> 1:59:07.760]  engineers adding it to the water simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[1:59:07.760 --> 1:59:13.040]  technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet
[1:59:13.040 --> 1:59:18.560]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies i am extremely excited to announce the exclusive info

[1:59:46.720 --> 1:59:57.840]  info war at the same time that's info wars life dot com waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm
[1:59:57.840 --> 2:00:12.800]  radio network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:00:12.800 --> 2:00:22.960]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones doctor
[2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:27.040]  baggage we've got a long segment coming up after this quick one but i wanted in this short segment
[2:00:27.040 --> 2:00:33.200]  to get your take on the nsa revelations but also federal court the supreme court gutting
[2:00:33.200 --> 2:00:39.760]  net neutrality rules and the fcc is actually being the good guy here saying look everybody pays for
[2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:45.120]  their web uh these companies are making money hand over fist uh you know these companies are
[2:00:45.120 --> 2:00:49.840]  going to try to charge you to get to sites they don't want you to get to uh this is going to be a
[2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:55.440]  great way to censor things uh this is really outrageous because the very nature of the web
[2:00:55.440 --> 2:01:00.160]  has been designed to be open and free flowing and we already saw the nsa and cyber command try
[2:01:00.160 --> 2:01:06.320]  to take over the web last year as wired magazine reported and basically end it this is the internet
[2:01:06.320 --> 2:01:13.120]  kill switch selectively by stealth that we should do an article uh on that breaking that down uh
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:20.080]  but it really shows how they proposed last year shiny style net censorship net ids to track trace
[2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:25.920]  and tax it and ultimately got it i just don't see them succeeding in this now that the genie's out of
[2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:32.160]  the bottle well it's more difficult certainly you can't do it in an overt way but i would i would
[2:01:32.160 --> 2:01:36.800]  say this is that if anyone ever expects that the system is going to be free of surveillance
[2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:42.160]  unless there's a total revolution this country the answer is going to be it's not
[2:01:43.280 --> 2:01:51.200]  the reality is all of these systems for decades have been targeted as a way to control populations
[2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:56.720]  the only thing that's changed is the resolution our ability to do this at a finer and finer and
[2:01:56.720 --> 2:02:02.400]  finer screen and every time they get caught what what happens and you know this they change the
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:06.720]  name of the program they shift it to another agency or maybe they offloaded to another third
[2:02:06.720 --> 2:02:12.160]  country that does the workforce you know or some some third party a lot of it's then pushed down
[2:02:12.160 --> 2:02:16.880]  into the corporate world which is not subject to the freedom of information act you can't get the
[2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:22.960]  information if you shove it down uh deep enough into corporations this is what's going on when
[2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:28.000]  you look at it as a fragmented system it doesn't make a lot of sense but connecting the dots as
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:34.080]  you say is really the the heart of it nobody does that i mean the big the big media the mainstream
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:38.080]  media don't have an interest in it because it's not about keeping an informed public it's about
[2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:42.560]  keeping a controlled public you know and this is the difference between sort of the drift in the
[2:02:42.560 --> 2:02:46.960]  first amendment rights in a way people perceive them and this is going to settle you know people
[2:02:46.960 --> 2:02:50.960]  think freedom of speech is saying whatever you want whatever you want well that's a big part of
[2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:56.560]  it the most important part of freedom of speech from our founding fathers was an informed public
[2:02:56.560 --> 2:03:01.280]  so that we could make the kind of decisions collectively to drive our democratic republic
[2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:06.720]  in a way that was quite unique in the world we've lost that sense of media and what's important
[2:03:06.720 --> 2:03:12.080]  to us and these are the programs alexis and others that at least give us a fighting chance
[2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:18.080]  unfortunately a large second population still plugs in and listens but those are the activists
[2:03:18.080 --> 2:03:24.800]  all of those listening to this broadcast tend to be activists populations do something do a little
[2:03:24.800 --> 2:03:29.920]  something don't just listen to the program send a postcard to someone get other people involved
[2:03:29.920 --> 2:03:34.080]  in what you're what you're learning and and that's the way change happens it's through first step
[2:03:34.080 --> 2:03:39.200]  education once people are aware it will happen and this is where the right and the left will
[2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:44.240]  come around full circle and shake hands because without a basic sense of freedom and liberty i
[2:03:44.240 --> 2:03:49.760]  don't care where exactly and that's why they try to divide and conquer all day long the truth is
[2:03:49.760 --> 2:03:54.400]  everybody agrees on basic freedom except for maybe one tenth of one percent the globalists say
[2:03:54.400 --> 2:03:58.800]  there's only six thousand in the superclass according to roth cop the head of the kissinger group at
[2:03:58.800 --> 2:04:04.000]  the time and i agree with that number we're talking about maybe six thousand people that have decided
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:10.160]  to be selfish horrible creatures and try to create a new dark age so they can control the new age of
[2:04:10.160 --> 2:04:15.200]  light as they see it only for themselves well someone bringing in an age of enlightenment
[2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:20.160]  by by shutting off the massive humanity that shows fundamentally that they're the opposite of
[2:04:20.160 --> 2:04:25.040]  enlightened yeah exactly right and they're driven by fear quite frankly if you think about if you
[2:04:25.040 --> 2:04:29.600]  really listen to the messaging that's coming out it's totally fear driven uh the most hampered
[2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:35.040]  people tend to be the ones driving the truck i mean you're accused i'm accused often of being a
[2:04:35.040 --> 2:04:40.560]  conspiratal uh thinker but when you really look at it military planners and planners within government
[2:04:40.560 --> 2:04:45.920]  are the conspiratorialists because their view is to look at the scariest thing and then build a plan
[2:04:45.920 --> 2:04:51.920]  to combat it exactly and then project that fake scary thing on innocent people to make them the
[2:04:51.920 --> 2:04:56.800]  enemy as an excuse to run their lives i want to expand on that and ask you where it's all going
[2:04:56.800 --> 2:05:02.560]  on the other side under nick beggars is our guest hi folks how much jones here with some important

[2:08:27.440 --> 2:08:33.040]  all right final segment with dr nick baggage expert on the breakaway civilization the
[2:08:33.040 --> 2:08:38.480]  globalists are trying to build they want to wall us off give us limited technology bring in eugenics
[2:08:38.480 --> 2:08:44.160]  population reduction a new dark age freezing the technology we get reversing a lot of it
[2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:49.680]  shutting down family farms shutting down real sustainability for the agenda 21 straight jacket
[2:08:49.680 --> 2:08:55.040]  takeover and you now see them rushing ahead with all this because they're behind because they're
[2:08:55.040 --> 2:09:02.000]  in trouble this is a big brazilian many other top globalists admit that so this is a major major
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:06.800]  animating contest of liberty right now and folks have to decide do they want to remain
[2:09:06.800 --> 2:09:10.720]  zombies in a trance like state or do they want to become aware of the fact that hey
[2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:16.880]  hey those guys alex jones and nick baggage and countless others ron paul the list goes on
[2:09:16.880 --> 2:09:21.920]  and on we're dead on well of course we were dead on we're reading their own documents
[2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:26.720]  that's what's so frustrating and dr baggage you've really been at the tip of the spear on
[2:09:26.720 --> 2:09:30.560]  getting government documents the thousands of documents that you know the thousands of
[2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:35.680]  patents and the admitted mind control and it's and now it's all out in the open yeah the congress
[2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:41.680]  is pressuring hollywood to put more climate change and carbon tax messages in they don't even hide it
[2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:46.160]  oh illegal spying we'll just move to another agency or congress we're going to spy on you
[2:09:46.160 --> 2:09:53.040]  we're not stopping it's so naked now obama becoming a dictator uh he doesn't mean he'll
[2:09:53.040 --> 2:09:58.560]  stay in office just means he is dictatorially acting now that's hiding in plain view i mean alex the
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:03.520]  president's not going to become dictatorial come on stop the fear mongering it's all out in the open
[2:10:03.520 --> 2:10:10.560]  so my concern dr baggage is this we've reached that point where the tipping point where okay people
[2:10:10.560 --> 2:10:15.440]  know we're in trouble we know it's bad but if no one gets reversed if no one gets in trouble
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:20.800]  and congress says obama you decide what's new on the nsa you decide what's new on obama care
[2:10:20.800 --> 2:10:26.640]  outside of law you decide to do on the borders then uh we go over the edge of the cliff and it
[2:10:26.640 --> 2:10:32.080]  doesn't matter if we're awake when we're falling over the edge of the cliff or asleep so we need
[2:10:32.080 --> 2:10:39.120]  to really say no now to start the reversal being awake isn't enough right i i absolutely agree with
[2:10:39.120 --> 2:10:44.480]  you and um in fact there was a a book written years and years ago called the unreality industry it
[2:10:44.480 --> 2:10:50.720]  was by mitrov and uh venice and it was about the entertainment industry and about how much of our
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:56.320]  technology would be headed into that when you look at zebid zebigny brzezinski's uh book at
[2:10:56.320 --> 2:11:02.000]  columbia university between two ages predicting what would happen in a a technocratic society
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:07.440]  and how it would evolve that book was written in the early 70s and it reads like a history it goes
[2:11:07.440 --> 2:11:12.400]  through every continent every political structure i just read it again six months ago and literally
[2:11:12.400 --> 2:11:17.920]  almost vomited because i was like my god they're really doing it it's everything he said they did
[2:11:17.920 --> 2:11:23.840]  it all and and here's what what what people need to realize is i can go back to the 1970s the early
[2:11:23.840 --> 2:11:29.840]  70s when that was being written when my dad was in congress just before watergate was breaking um
[2:11:29.840 --> 2:11:35.680]  and and the issue of a surveillance society was an issue then only the technology was nowhere
[2:11:35.680 --> 2:11:41.360]  near as advanced in fact it was in 1976 in the president's report on the cia where it came out
[2:11:41.360 --> 2:11:46.080]  that they were intercepting our mail they were infiltrating domestic uh groups they were getting
[2:11:46.080 --> 2:11:51.760]  involved in local politics and swaying it manipulating it they were opening people's mail i mean
[2:11:51.760 --> 2:11:57.120]  every bit of your mail we've reported on this for decades has been monitored everyone you send
[2:11:57.120 --> 2:12:02.400]  mail to receive mail from they keep track of it all your bank data all of your information
[2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:08.080]  your digital doorway it's no longer your privacy in your home it's your digital doorway that's
[2:12:08.080 --> 2:12:13.760]  so important that's what we should individually own no company should own our information it's
[2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:19.120]  about us we should own that information have control of it these are the fundamental changes
[2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:24.960]  to restore freedom in the country we need changes in the law and strict criminal penalties for those
[2:12:24.960 --> 2:12:31.840]  that violate the law and no exemptions for government employees no way to escape prosecution put people
[2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:37.840]  in jail that's what needs to happen to preserve american freedom i agree public needs to start
[2:12:37.840 --> 2:12:43.440]  asking for whistleblowers need to be encouraged to the right channels to get information the public
[2:12:43.440 --> 2:12:48.800]  it's too bad that so much has to be reviewed we need to get angry at people i mean if you caught a
[2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:54.240]  guy in a black suit with black sunglasses in your closet you would probably without a warrant
[2:12:54.240 --> 2:13:00.640]  blow up and kick their butt and you should now they're just doing it and again it's a revolution
[2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:05.840]  of control freaks and criminals they are just trying to get us used to it right now and the
[2:13:05.840 --> 2:13:11.200]  response is to shout these crooks down and take the moral authority away from them that that's
[2:13:11.200 --> 2:13:18.000]  exactly exactly it and and the fact is a lot of effort is spent at discrediting and and stabbing
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:23.120]  at people that are trying to bring information forward but over time history shows itself and i
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:28.880]  think that's what's been important um in in keeping these issues alive we can't let it go
[2:13:28.880 --> 2:13:33.040]  and none of us can and and and approaching it from the standpoint of an informed public
[2:13:33.040 --> 2:13:38.560]  becomes an empowered public the first step to change i hope it's i hope it's a peaceful revolution
[2:13:38.560 --> 2:13:43.440]  in the united states but i know one is coming because the average american in this country is
[2:13:43.440 --> 2:13:49.600]  fed up the word incumbent attached to anybody's name next election cycle is probably the kiss of
[2:13:49.600 --> 2:13:55.120]  death for most of them as it should be but where is the new leadership going to emerge from it's
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:14:00.320]  going to emerge from all of us taking steps in a direction that's much different by recognizing our
[2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:04.720]  power and stepping into it sure yeah when you look at the elite and what they've done there was a
[2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:09.280]  great article and i know you've talked about this from before it was produced by the us army war
[2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:16.560]  college because the called the mind has no firewalls published now over 14 years ago and i can tell you
[2:14:16.560 --> 2:14:22.800]  that nothing's changed the human mind has no firewall the ability to dumb down numb down the
[2:14:22.800 --> 2:14:28.960]  population being done today in the advent of electronic technologies and others but again
[2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:33.840]  going back to the 70s there were initiatives to do this using psychoactive drugs that were
[2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:39.600]  struck down then and then resurrected in the 1980s and it was uh dr bregan in maryland that
[2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:44.400]  began to object to that and killed the early bush administration initiatives in that effort
[2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:50.960]  but they came back again and you look across the population now in kentucky 18 percent of the kids
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:56.000]  are considered hyperactive or attention deficit disorder court in reports i read in the last week
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:15:00.400]  when you look at that segment of the population being diagnosed this way and then dumbed down
[2:15:00.400 --> 2:15:08.800]  and dumbed down by our public systems there's a problem 80 hd uh 80 d the all fraud all related
[2:15:08.800 --> 2:15:13.920]  all diet based all based on kids watching television the studies show that and instead of the
[2:15:13.920 --> 2:15:17.600]  doctors saying hey don't let your kid watch all this tv give them healthy food all your kids
[2:15:17.600 --> 2:15:22.720]  screwed up let's screw them up even more let me shift gears in the time we have left quantify it
[2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:27.520]  studying the globalist the technocrats the anglo-american establishment the technotronic era
[2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:34.080]  who in the final equation are they and what will the world look like in 20 years if they have their
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:40.800]  way if they have their way it's a slave class we're already halfway there maybe more um
[2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:45.600]  um you know when you look at the elite they want to keep what they have and and they want to get
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:50.960]  more and they live in an environment of fear and i think if we continue to allow things to go the
[2:15:50.960 --> 2:15:56.960]  way they are we will be in that uh a deeper level of Orwellian society than the one we see right now
[2:15:57.600 --> 2:16:01.360]  that's not what i want for my grandchildren or great grandchildren and i can tell you
[2:16:02.480 --> 2:16:07.120]  none of us do but it's stepping into what we know to be right and true doing something every day
[2:16:07.120 --> 2:16:12.480]  about that whether supporting this program or getting the information to others don't step away
[2:16:12.480 --> 2:16:17.360]  from your obligation to yourself to your family to your friends to your country that's what has
[2:16:17.360 --> 2:16:22.640]  to change absolutely let me throw one more thing at you earthpulse.com people can find the books
[2:16:22.640 --> 2:16:27.200]  the films all of it they're invaluable information to wake up others to have viewing parties you
[2:16:27.200 --> 2:16:32.800]  name it i'm not putting you on the spot about this but i mean i really we got to put our chips
[2:16:32.800 --> 2:16:38.000]  you know on the table our cards on the table about all this and i know he's done some good things
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:42.720]  some other things i didn't like too much right i'm interested and i know in family there's a
[2:16:42.720 --> 2:16:45.600]  code don't talk about your family but you've talked about your dad and you know all the great
[2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:50.480]  things he did and his mysterious uh plane crash death and maybe that has something to do with it
[2:16:50.480 --> 2:16:56.640]  but your brother the u.s senator from uh alaska mark baggage um i mean talking to him about
[2:16:56.640 --> 2:17:01.280]  stuff you can say on record obviously he knows about all this stuff he's your brother and obviously
[2:17:01.280 --> 2:17:07.280]  you had a lot of hopes when he went to the senate right what is your view and i mean about your
[2:17:07.280 --> 2:17:11.600]  brother and you know what do you say to him about the state of the world it'd be great if he'd come
[2:17:11.600 --> 2:17:17.360]  out like rand paul uh or or other people from you know the democratic party uh angle because we
[2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:23.440]  need this to be bipartisan uh it'd be great if people like your brother uh or is he just controlled
[2:17:23.440 --> 2:17:29.520]  by party politics you know he's he's not a party guy i i say there's a few things i strongly disagree
[2:17:29.520 --> 2:17:36.160]  with him the obama care vote he made is not one that i support at all um but look at some of mark's
[2:17:36.160 --> 2:17:42.000]  issues on gun control mark is a is a second amendment rights person that's good yeah you know and i can
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:48.160]  tell you the day that he voted right on april 17th i went and bought myself a new titanium 44 magnum
[2:17:48.160 --> 2:17:53.840]  to celebrate today and oh yeah let me say this let me say this as democrats go and i know he's not
[2:17:53.840 --> 2:17:58.720]  really a democrat but that's how he ran and like ron paul ran as a republican when he's libertarian
[2:17:58.720 --> 2:18:04.240]  i mean i mean i'm pleased with some of what he's done i'm just you just wish man you're so great
[2:18:04.240 --> 2:18:08.880]  i i just wish we had like a nick baggage in the u.s senate maybe you can run for senate we'll have
[2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:14.720]  two u.s senators that are baggages and you never know but you know i'll tell you what is is i
[2:18:14.720 --> 2:18:20.560]  contemplated politics uh for a long time i even ran a couple of times for local office and i really
[2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:25.360]  feel the role i'm in now public education is more important um i don't want to be one of the babies
[2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:30.080]  thrown out with the bathwater i'd like to be there after the revolution and really build a country
[2:18:30.080 --> 2:18:34.320]  that's based on on what we all believe is right and true what would you do first thing in the
[2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:42.000]  minute we've got left what would you do uh if you were a u.s senator i would be attacking um the
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:46.400]  surveillance society i'd be looking for creating more whistleblower mechanisms that allow people
[2:18:46.400 --> 2:18:51.360]  to come forward with the truth things that people can trust in and not necessarily run by government
[2:18:51.360 --> 2:18:56.000]  that was an issue we intended to push in europe when we gained a certain amount of momentum in
[2:18:56.000 --> 2:19:02.400]  the politicians that work with us we're taken out by the elite and i can tell you this the
[2:19:02.400 --> 2:19:06.320]  opportunity for people to speak the truth and say the truth needs to be enhanced in this country
[2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:11.120]  and not suppressed we need a way to do that in an orderly way that give people confidence and
[2:19:11.120 --> 2:19:18.400]  security within within a country that has dissolved it with the sense of a security state the reality
[2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:23.120]  is for true liberty to exist we've got to have disclosure and that means a little bit of risk
[2:19:23.120 --> 2:19:28.080]  and and that little bit of risk we just have to have that's the price of a democratic republic in
[2:19:28.080 --> 2:19:33.120]  the 21st century we can do a lot to ensure it and preserve it but the real preservation of
[2:19:33.120 --> 2:19:39.600]  democrat democracies and republics are the citizens you and i the elite doesn't like the idea that we
[2:19:39.600 --> 2:19:44.720]  can step in uh to the kind of power that every exactly they want control they want us to think
[2:19:44.720 --> 2:19:52.000]  that they're invincible they're not and so the answer is realizing that the answer is 1776 thank

[2:24:43.920 --> 2:24:50.560]  court via congress to not let them basically censor the web so he does some good things
[2:24:50.560 --> 2:24:53.760]  for a democrat he's a pretty good guy i'm not trying to get somebody on have and talk about
[2:24:53.760 --> 2:25:00.000]  their brother i just know that nick had a lot of big hopes for his brother and i know his
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:05.840]  brother's aware of all this stuff as well i'm just gonna leave it that and but i guess you know
[2:25:05.840 --> 2:25:11.520]  you heard nick baggages said they killed a lot of people in the 60s 70s 80s and 90s last time
[2:25:11.520 --> 2:25:17.360]  i saw numbers i think it's your 11 or 12 times more likely if you are a congressperson a dying
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:24.000]  a plane accident per capita that doesn't mean they fly more so they die more no no no compared
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:29.440]  to other people that fly as much or more they are more than 10 times more likely to die on a plane
[2:25:29.440 --> 2:25:37.280]  crash and i've interviewed uh the people i mean i've interviewed st john hunt is dab is a famous
[2:25:37.280 --> 2:25:42.000]  guy that overthrow a bunch of governments eHoward hunt who gave the deathbed confession for running
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:46.160]  the operation to kill kennedy and that had been known for a long time he was photographed that
[2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:50.960]  day and other things and uh you know he started demanding more money whenever he was keeping his
[2:25:50.960 --> 2:25:57.280]  mouth shut here in watergate and they uh his his wife was flying eHoward hunt's wife was
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:01.920]  flying to pick up the money in chicago and uh they blew the airplane up as it came in for a
[2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:06.880]  landing with explosives and then they sent him a message and said now you want the rest of your
[2:26:06.880 --> 2:26:13.520]  family i mean that's that's how they work ladies and gentlemen so i mean that's what i'm telling
[2:26:13.520 --> 2:26:17.520]  you with ted cruise and rand paul up there saying we got a tyrant and the government's dangerous and
[2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:22.000]  it's evil and we got to get rid of the nsa let me tell you i can look in those guys eyeballs and
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  tell they have got the look of men that are just putting their face down and going i'm doing this
[2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:31.040]  and they're the type of people whose airplanes they'll blow up i'm going to tell you right now
[2:26:31.680 --> 2:26:36.720]  i expect all the time to hear about a ted cruise or rand paul airplane blowing up
[2:26:37.840 --> 2:26:41.760]  i'm just going to be honest with you now one reason they haven't done that is they know we're
[2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:49.200]  not stupid nowadays they don't want martyrs and they're also trying to co-opt them and and seeing
[2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:53.760]  if they'll work with them and and rand a little bit cruise a little bit will work with them on
[2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:58.160]  some issues they also know the libertarian tide as the financial times wrote two days ago was taking
[2:26:58.160 --> 2:27:02.880]  over and so the globalists want to kind of hijack that at billderberg now they'll have a bunch of
[2:27:02.880 --> 2:27:12.640]  top libertarians uh peter feel and others teal feel potato patata and so the establishment also
[2:27:12.640 --> 2:27:18.240]  realizes it can't keep this going so that's the only reason those two are still alive i can tell
[2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:26.400]  you right now the only reason i'm still alive uh is that they realize i've already said basically
[2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:31.280]  so much that if they do kill me it'll make me a martyr it'll highlight with a big indelible marker
[2:27:31.280 --> 2:27:36.960]  and put 50 exclamation points behind everything i've ever said it'll it it will make me a super
[2:27:36.960 --> 2:27:42.880]  cult icon and believe me i don't want that to happen and i don't do risky stuff i don't mountain
[2:27:42.880 --> 2:27:48.560]  climb i don't use drugs i don't do really anything they can come after me for i don't even speed anymore
[2:27:49.760 --> 2:27:55.680]  in fact i catch myself now in the slow lane all the time just listen to music or talking on my
[2:27:55.680 --> 2:28:02.000]  hands free getting work done on the phone so i mean it's just i i'm really becoming an old man
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:09.280]  which i actually like doing uh in that i just i just care about the work and when bad things happen
[2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:14.160]  in my personal life it's almost like the work is there and the mission is there it's very comforting
[2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:18.880]  actually the more i get attacked the more i get demonized the more all these horrible things happen
[2:28:18.880 --> 2:28:23.840]  to me behind the scenes uh just the stronger i get by the grace of god and i'm very very very
[2:28:23.840 --> 2:28:28.640]  thankful for that and i've been uh i've been blessed and you know we're gonna make it through this
[2:28:28.640 --> 2:28:33.840]  together but we're gonna go to break come back long segment and gonna do a ton of news that i
[2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:37.440]  haven't and believe me it's a heavy news that i've got to get to the rest of this and recap some of
[2:28:37.440 --> 2:28:42.240]  the top stories on the other side and i try to talk about myself all the time i'm just explaining
[2:28:42.240 --> 2:28:49.040]  to you my journey because you know sometimes i'm out of breath on air sometimes i'm exhausted
[2:28:49.040 --> 2:28:53.040]  sometimes my head spins looking at all the news that i've already looked at and i'm almost don't
[2:28:53.040 --> 2:28:59.200]  even want to get into it and so i'm just kind of telling you where i'm at in all of this but um
[2:29:00.320 --> 2:29:08.960]  it's creepy it's also uh it's crushing very stoic at a certain level i mean people would think
[2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:13.840]  having all this attention having this responsibility being on the spotlight it's like the more i get
[2:29:13.840 --> 2:29:18.640]  in the spotlight i know it's a mission and it's satisfying and 10 years ago it was more ego driven
[2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:23.760]  even though my heart was good it was fun to be successful and get bigger now it's entered a
[2:29:23.760 --> 2:29:31.200]  territory of just with great power comes great responsibility as spider man's uncle tells him
[2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:37.680]  and now i just freak out on my crew not bad but and writers and researchers i want to get it all
[2:29:37.680 --> 2:29:43.200]  right i want to you know i mean i'm killing myself to try to be accurate whereas the mainstream whores
[2:29:43.200 --> 2:29:48.960]  just spew lies cynically it's a bunch of corrupt narcissists and they make me sick make me sick
[2:29:49.680 --> 2:29:56.400]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[2:35:19.520 --> 2:35:26.240]  people when i was flying back from england into dallas last year from cover and bill deberg
[2:35:27.200 --> 2:35:32.160]  they were literally just yelling at families and kids for no reason oh and they're even a
[2:35:32.160 --> 2:35:36.880]  rudor down in houston coming back into the country i mean they have like big lines of people people
[2:35:36.880 --> 2:35:40.720]  on walkers and stuff yelling at them they yelled at my grandmother i didn't see this they went to a
[2:35:40.720 --> 2:35:46.320]  wedding years ago and my cousin verna got married in mexico a beautiful resort i didn't go because
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:51.520]  because the tsa i just i just if it's not business i don't do it i just can't handle it and um
[2:35:52.560 --> 2:35:57.680]  my grandmother had polio in the 50s and it's tough as she said you know like 89 years old and she
[2:35:57.680 --> 2:36:02.320]  walks on with crutches because she now she's just gone to the wheelchair she but finally but she
[2:36:02.320 --> 2:36:08.320]  wanted to do that to try to you know keep mobility and um that was about five years ago and my dad
[2:36:08.320 --> 2:36:13.200]  said he actually turned red and almost you know blew up my dad's a nice guy he's the opposite of me
[2:36:13.200 --> 2:36:18.960]  you know he's real calm compared to a hothead uh and he said but he he will get mad and then it
[2:36:18.960 --> 2:36:23.680]  gets mad look out and he said he was uh because these these people are screaming at my grandmother
[2:36:23.680 --> 2:36:30.320]  to hurry up i mean you know 84 year old woman at the time on crutches i mean you know i'm sorry
[2:36:30.320 --> 2:36:39.440]  it's at a point there's enough is enough man and a cop had died in a car wreck not even chasing
[2:36:39.440 --> 2:36:44.800]  anybody coming to work out on 290 and i was driving in a few months ago and didn't know it was a funeral
[2:36:44.800 --> 2:36:48.960]  and they had motorcycle cops up and down the road and then traffic slowed down took me an hour to get
[2:36:48.960 --> 2:36:54.880]  to work so 35 minutes and i happened to wait till i rolled right to a stop with cars in front of me
[2:36:54.880 --> 2:37:00.560]  right up by a motorcycle cop and i was like hi hey how you doing what's going on trying to see
[2:37:00.560 --> 2:37:06.960]  i knew he'd be rude because that's what you treat a peasant like so i but i was hoping i said hey
[2:37:06.960 --> 2:37:10.400]  how's it going what's going on he goes he looked at me like you couldn't believe the last question
[2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:15.600]  he goes don't worry about it move and of course i couldn't it was a car five feet in front of me
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:19.440]  so i waited and another cop decided to just look at me like can you believe that scum
[2:37:20.160 --> 2:37:23.760]  and then i rolled to another stop this time didn't the car was 10 feet ahead of me i could have
[2:37:23.760 --> 2:37:28.080]  kept going but i stopped right where the cop was and i was like what's going on it was other two of
[2:37:28.080 --> 2:37:32.880]  them they were like of course they knew who i was that group was like uh yeah just don't worry about
[2:37:32.880 --> 2:37:39.120]  it they weren't as hateful just get on you know just don't worry about it but i can imagine if i
[2:37:39.120 --> 2:37:44.560]  was just walking down the street and somebody said to me hey sir do you know where you know we're
[2:37:44.560 --> 2:37:49.120]  here from new jersey or california do you know where the capital is yeah it's down on congress
[2:37:49.120 --> 2:37:53.920]  street the end of it just just just go down two streets here take a look you'll see it down there
[2:37:53.920 --> 2:37:57.680]  i learned going to new york quite a bit that either people are super nice from new york
[2:37:59.040 --> 2:38:02.480]  super helpful or they're the thug culture that are incredibly rude and i'll tell you
[2:38:02.480 --> 2:38:06.400]  most new workers i found to be some of the nicest people ever of their real new yorkers
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:11.200]  and not trendies that have moved there who are too cool to talk to you we've got those here
[2:38:11.200 --> 2:38:16.400]  they can come from anywhere hey i met a lot of new yorkers there's just firemen police
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:21.200]  uh construction workers people that have been at 911 events about the dust there it's just
[2:38:21.200 --> 2:38:25.760]  neat as you can get but new york police and i'm told a lot of them are listeners they've given us
[2:38:25.760 --> 2:38:30.480]  a lot of info over the years but a lot you'll see like the thug young cop with the hat sideways
[2:38:30.480 --> 2:38:36.960]  with a cigar their belly hanging out and it's like the image of a moron i mean this guy came
[2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:40.480]  to your house wanting to sell you vacuum cleaners you'd you know you wouldn't open the door because
[2:38:40.480 --> 2:38:45.760]  they look like a thug you know tattoos all over them and i'm not knocking you've got tattoos
[2:38:45.760 --> 2:38:49.840]  i know it's the dominant culture now it's weird when i go to the swimming pool and don't have them
[2:38:49.840 --> 2:38:55.040]  okay i get it uh i'm not but i'm saying there's the image of the guys that get them to be thugs
[2:38:55.600 --> 2:39:02.880]  a cop with a cigar with their hats cocked to the side i've seen i saw a video that abc reporter
[2:39:02.880 --> 2:39:05.520]  doing an interview on the street in the cops when we go you can't interview get out of here
[2:39:05.520 --> 2:39:10.080]  and the abc guy goes man i have first amendment and the cop goes you want me to hurt you and he's
[2:39:10.080 --> 2:39:15.840]  smoking a cigarette with his hat sideways and i've seen this i saw the Puerto Rican day parade
[2:39:15.840 --> 2:39:19.840]  when i happened to be there a few years ago for the talkers magazine keynote deal and before we
[2:39:19.840 --> 2:39:24.400]  had to go catch the plane we went out and got some footage the Puerto Rican day parade and the cops
[2:39:25.360 --> 2:39:32.160]  i got to look at the new york police and man let me tell you that is that is i thought Mexican
[2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:36.720]  police years ago when i'd go visit mexico as a kid looked like potbelly thugs with gold teeth you
[2:39:36.720 --> 2:39:44.400]  know the stereotypical no they they looked honorable compared to the new to the uh to the
[2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:50.480]  new york police that i saw and what i'm saying is that's the essence of what we're dealing with here
[2:39:51.200 --> 2:40:00.800]  is that i'm like excuse me officer how you doing you know well can you tell me where the social
[2:40:00.800 --> 2:40:06.800]  is just do i look like a phone book and then if you grovel i've done the psychological test rob
[2:40:06.800 --> 2:40:10.160]  Jacobson's done this too and he's from new york trying to set up a camera and film down there
[2:40:10.160 --> 2:40:16.640]  he goes sorry sir and i go oh hey i'll tell you all about it it's all about you bowing down to them
[2:40:16.640 --> 2:40:21.280]  i mean do you want your kids to grow up in a society where everyone grovels in fear to uniforms
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:26.160]  i mean is that really what you want because the cops all have it in their head that they're these
[2:40:26.160 --> 2:40:30.800]  heroes and they're saving the world and all this stuff and i do see more and more police go i frankly
[2:40:30.800 --> 2:40:34.800]  changing tires and do them when i saw when i was a kid at least around austin uh but i mean that's
[2:40:34.800 --> 2:40:39.040]  what you're supposed to act like as a servant that's a very honorable position and then you
[2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:44.160]  are the person to be honored who is a you know a peace officer who also wears the hat of a warrior
[2:40:44.160 --> 2:40:50.320]  fighting bad guys but when you become revenue generators and secret police and intimidators
[2:40:50.320 --> 2:40:57.760]  of the press i mean come on that there's not much further to fall when outside of law
[2:40:58.560 --> 2:41:02.560]  we have a policy you can't film we're going to arrest you if you don't leave
[2:41:04.800 --> 2:41:08.560]  and then it's failure to follow police officers order and our austin police chief i want to get
[2:41:08.560 --> 2:41:13.040]  him back in there he's he certainly has courage to come on i heard him on 5 90 a.m with sergeant
[2:41:13.040 --> 2:41:18.400]  sam cox former police officer who is a patriot friend of mine and knows what's going on a lot
[2:41:18.400 --> 2:41:23.200]  more than he lets on on air let me tell you he's basically like me knows as much as i do and the
[2:41:23.200 --> 2:41:27.680]  and the whole issue is he's on there and he's like i just think you should follow any order a
[2:41:27.680 --> 2:41:33.760]  police officer gives you even if it's wrong or illegal and you won't get hurt no no if i'm in
[2:41:33.760 --> 2:41:37.760]  my own front yard and there's not a dead person in the street right there and i'm interfering with
[2:41:37.760 --> 2:41:42.640]  it the cop just walks up and says turn your camera off i'm not doing it i've had me and i'm really
[2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:48.720]  you listen we had rob jacob senator and dies fears goes videos online have homeland security
[2:41:48.720 --> 2:41:55.120]  security guards more i don't know four tenths of a mile away getting a wide shot of the fellow
[2:41:55.120 --> 2:41:58.640]  reserve building they're driving by they see the fellow reserve they pull over get some footage
[2:41:58.640 --> 2:42:02.720]  of that drive down the street hey what's that a world war one memorial at a taxi guy give him a
[2:42:02.720 --> 2:42:09.360]  term they've been there to interview professor black for the obama film of fall the republic
[2:42:09.360 --> 2:42:13.920]  the professor that brought down the s and ls and stuff and investigated and leaves a federal regulator
[2:42:13.920 --> 2:42:18.560]  at the time william k black and so they're like oh that's the sports day and let's get some footage
[2:42:18.560 --> 2:42:22.560]  of that oh that's the fellow reserve oh that's a world war one memorial wow the national world
[2:42:22.560 --> 2:42:28.720]  memorial we didn't know that was in you know kansas city let's go over there and they pull up in a
[2:42:28.720 --> 2:42:33.280]  car and get out with guns a mail and dream on they walk over and go give us your IDs and i told
[2:42:33.280 --> 2:42:36.720]  the guys don't get in confrontation so in the interest of whatever they go your federal security
[2:42:36.720 --> 2:42:42.800]  guards all right but your office jurisdiction it's a city park not federal and they okay now leave
[2:42:43.520 --> 2:42:47.280]  well no we're we're still getting footage no lever and they put their hands on their guns
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:53.440]  i mean that's the same thing folks is if i go into a store and say give me the money out of
[2:42:53.440 --> 2:42:59.120]  the cash register and put my hand on a gun federal courts and state courts have ruled you go in and
[2:42:59.120 --> 2:43:03.600]  say i got something in my pocket give me the money that's that's that's felony robbery that's aggravated
[2:43:03.600 --> 2:43:09.120]  felony even if you don't have a weapon you implied you did they had guns a man and a woman
[2:43:10.160 --> 2:43:15.680]  who acted familiar in their body language very bizarre literally and i'm telling you
[2:43:16.240 --> 2:43:20.880]  i'm telling you they followed my directive and didn't have a confrontation i would have said hey
[2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:27.440]  pull your gun man i'm i'm i'm done okay i am done with being managed by some
[2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:32.800]  criminal and i'm saying that that guy and by the way the federal reserve then denied their officers
[2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:38.640]  their agents because they were law enforcement you know graded security guards armed security guards
[2:43:39.440 --> 2:43:43.120]  they first denied they done it and said we were lying till the kansas city star brought them the
[2:43:43.120 --> 2:43:51.360]  video off youtube and they said uh that's still not our people because it was so illegal a federal
[2:43:51.360 --> 2:43:57.120]  reserve that's private with a fraudulent name a literal offshore banking mafia with two armed goons
[2:43:57.120 --> 2:44:04.880]  600 700 i don't know i mean it's down the road 800 yards i don't know the buildings you know little
[2:44:04.880 --> 2:44:13.040]  in the distance followed them over ran their plates waited didn't call police because i mean
[2:44:14.160 --> 2:44:18.480]  at least in my case is the the kansas city police would have shown up they'd be like we're in a
[2:44:18.480 --> 2:44:23.120]  city park officers you know they're just acting like thugs i would imagine cops would say you
[2:44:23.120 --> 2:44:27.600]  know you're right your security guards are out of it get out of here not nowadays folks they'd say
[2:44:27.600 --> 2:44:34.640]  well you know you could be terrorist oh yeah we could be terrorist no no your government runs al-qaeda
[2:44:34.640 --> 2:44:40.800]  your government put the underwear bomber drugged up on that plane we broke that your government isn't
[2:44:40.800 --> 2:44:47.360]  your government it's a international crime cartel that runs everything from child kidnapping and
[2:44:47.360 --> 2:44:54.000]  snuff films to narcotics to weapons and the minute people start realizing that is the minute we
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:45:00.400]  realize we can turn this around and i mean we're all in danger folks all you cops all of you are
[2:45:00.400 --> 2:45:07.840]  in danger you realize what tyrannies like this do they get worse and this is premeditated and
[2:45:07.840 --> 2:45:14.880]  you're not going to cover your butt going along with this you are going to bring down destruction
[2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:18.800]  on everybody and i harp on the police and the bureaucrats and the enforcers all day
[2:45:19.760 --> 2:45:24.080]  because you're in there and you're getting the training to do illegal stuff and you're being
[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:28.320]  told to do whatever you want and you know you're gearing up for a civil war and you know what i'm
[2:45:28.320 --> 2:45:34.080]  saying is true even the dumbest of you do and you know it's a fraud and a takedown an illegal
[2:45:34.080 --> 2:45:38.480]  takeover you are literally helping collaborators now you're like well i'm just out here helping
[2:45:38.480 --> 2:45:44.000]  people all day and get cats out of trees doesn't matter you are now federalized you are now under
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:50.000]  a federal government seized by foreign enemies period and so that's why i'm talking to you all
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:54.720]  the time because let me tell you i know what i'm talking about this stuff's all coming down
[2:45:54.720 --> 2:45:58.640]  and you better decide what side you're on right now and i know most of you have
[2:46:00.240 --> 2:46:05.840]  and believe me i know the public a large portion of them are demonic slovenly degenerate
[2:46:06.640 --> 2:46:11.200]  people that don't care about anybody but themselves and you're like well why should i
[2:46:11.200 --> 2:46:16.560]  even care if the public such scum it doesn't matter if the public is a bunch of lazy scum on
[2:46:16.560 --> 2:46:21.680]  average there are a lot of good people in this country and a lot of innocence and it doesn't
[2:46:21.680 --> 2:46:25.040]  matter if the public's bad they don't deserve what's happening to them
[2:46:27.520 --> 2:46:31.760]  it's very simple and by the way all of us seem to look in the mirror and realize we need to do more
[2:46:34.080 --> 2:46:39.120]  but all over this country including in austin texas i've had police over and over again come over
[2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:43.200]  and say turn your camera off i've had state police when we're 200 yards away from them
[2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:48.080]  come over and say turn it off and in the minute you start thinking you're gonna be nice they're
[2:46:48.080 --> 2:46:50.960]  gonna say i'm gonna arrest you i just say look man you're violating the first amendment you
[2:46:50.960 --> 2:46:54.720]  want to live in a country like this go and do whatever you're gonna do then they back off everybody
[2:46:54.720 --> 2:47:02.000]  else starts going sir sir i'm i'm good i'm good look they know you're good they know they're following
[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:10.720]  illegal orders i haven't even gotten all this news i mean look at this propaganda democrats
[2:47:10.720 --> 2:47:17.520]  plan to pressure tv networks into covering climate change national journal and they're openly having
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:22.480]  signatures basically pushing the entertainment agency to do this i mean this is how controlled
[2:47:22.480 --> 2:47:27.520]  the media is okay let's continue federal court guts net neutrality rules that's horrible news the
[2:47:27.520 --> 2:47:37.600]  supreme court is just a disaster zone continuing FCC says may appeals court ruling against its net
[2:47:37.600 --> 2:47:44.480]  neutrality rule FCC is doing good there paradigm change british docs turned to prescribing books

[2:47:50.960 --> 2:47:57.280]  having an imagination not watching establishment non-reactive television and i don't defend
[2:47:57.280 --> 2:48:01.520]  interactive television because it's good for you it's bad for you but a lot less bad for you
[2:48:01.520 --> 2:48:07.680]  than mainline tv that doesn't have all the destructive messages radio and reading so good
[2:48:07.680 --> 2:48:12.960]  for the brain i'm not going to go into why i've talked about a billion times okay continuing
[2:48:12.960 --> 2:48:18.960]  with the other news border patrol drones being borrowed by other agencies more often than
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:24.640]  previously known washington post oh turns out there's drones all over america surveilling you
[2:48:24.640 --> 2:48:31.360]  north dakota man sentenced to jail in controversial drone arrest case the cows kept going on his
[2:48:31.360 --> 2:48:38.000]  property eating his plants common law is the third time you can keep them they used homeland security
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:43.440]  pentagon air force drone on him and remember a year after this even happened the mainstream media
[2:48:43.440 --> 2:48:47.360]  said i was lying and drudge was lying there were no drones domestically that's how dumb they think
[2:48:47.360 --> 2:48:56.480]  you are that's weaponized media in your face but everything's okay because obama nsa unleashed
[2:48:56.480 --> 2:49:04.000]  obama tells public trust me he secretly with a secret court that that's the headline today
[2:49:04.640 --> 2:49:10.240]  they will decide that's why his reports said oh this is bad oh they're giving it to select industry
[2:49:10.240 --> 2:49:16.400]  over others oh oh i'll i'll i'll deal with it i'm gonna beat the ndaa don't worry then ends up he
[2:49:16.400 --> 2:49:22.160]  wrote it and signed it so this is this mind control there are no drones but there are drones
[2:49:22.160 --> 2:49:28.960]  i'm gonna get rid of the nsa but i'm expanding it so everybody's like oh no george at herbert
[2:49:28.960 --> 2:49:32.480]  walker bush wasn't for gun control and george w wasn't even though they all tried to get bills
[2:49:32.480 --> 2:49:36.880]  passed and then i could show people the bills they finally go oh really again they count on you not

[2:57:25.760 --> 2:57:31.200]  her brief as i've been said was so fraudulent and ridiculous she would have been disbarred if she
