[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:25.520]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:25.520 --> 00:29.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be a radio transmission you don't want to miss.
[00:29.480 --> 00:35.200]  I mean, they're all important, but this one's going to be really, really jam-packed. The
[00:35.200 --> 00:40.240]  news is all off the charts, important. We've got Michael Savage scheduled to be joining
[00:40.240 --> 00:47.300]  us in the third hour, part of his maiden voyage here with us. That is coming up today. I was
[00:47.300 --> 00:51.400]  on Howard Stern for an hour and a half this morning. They were going to have me on for
[00:51.400 --> 00:55.640]  like 30 minutes, and I was on for an hour and a half. And growing up, off and on, listening
[00:55.640 --> 01:00.760]  to Howard Stern, being on stations, broadcasting on stations that carried Howard Stern. It's
[01:00.760 --> 01:05.480]  just weird to be sitting there talking to Howard Stern for an hour and a half. And Robin
[01:05.480 --> 01:11.040]  Quivers really was waking up to the New World Order, and to a certain extent, Howard Stern
[01:11.040 --> 01:17.200]  was as well. And I was able to talk to his sizable audience, the biggest on XM and Sirius,
[01:17.200 --> 01:23.660]  undoubtedly, the king of that format, and able to talk to him about some really, really
[01:23.660 --> 01:28.320]  important issues like fluoride in the water and what it's doing to people, and to quote
[01:28.320 --> 01:34.680]  Harvard studies to them, and to tell them about silicone and the chicken McNuggets,
[01:34.680 --> 01:36.760]  and to warn them about flu vaccines being dangerous.
[01:36.760 --> 01:44.920]  I mean, these are real, real public services. And they said, what news sources do you trust?
[01:44.920 --> 01:49.720]  Who's a good reporter? And I said, it's not even so much about news services, but it's
[01:49.720 --> 01:56.240]  about a reporter. It's about reporters. And I was able to plug DrudgeReport.com and things
[01:56.240 --> 02:01.600]  like that. So it all went pretty well. I was unable to get it out about Seymour Hersh because
[02:01.600 --> 02:08.720]  it was real banter back and forth there on air, but it'll definitely be a popular interview.
[02:08.720 --> 02:12.800]  And so bottom line, the broadcast is reaching more and more people. And that's my goal.
[02:12.800 --> 02:16.680]  Go in there to people living in the matrix, living in entertainment land, and one of the
[02:16.680 --> 02:22.720]  smarter dirty shows. I mean, now Howard Stern is nothing compared to the other stuff I hear
[02:22.720 --> 02:27.840]  on talk radio, and the shock jog morning shows, and the other stuff on XM and Sirius.
[02:27.840 --> 02:32.040]  I mean, the big end thing is to make fun of handicapped people, and make fun of mentally
[02:32.040 --> 02:36.120]  retarded children, and do really some horrible stuff. And you don't really hear that from
[02:36.120 --> 02:39.320]  what I've heard on Howard Stern. And I was trying to wake him up about the New World
[02:39.320 --> 02:44.000]  Order and the banking cartels, and how the future doesn't need us, according to the elites,
[02:44.000 --> 02:51.360]  the whole robot takeover. Cuz my job is to get in there and to try to inform their audience.
[02:51.360 --> 02:56.120]  With CNN, there really isn't much of an audience. I mean, the top people that actually watch
[02:56.120 --> 03:04.120]  and believe CNN have the IQ of drying paint. And so I just wanted to put Piers Morgan in
[03:04.120 --> 03:09.160]  his place. And Piers Morgan normally doesn't have a big audience, but because of that event,
[03:09.160 --> 03:14.400]  it did cause chain reactions out there. And was basically aired on every news program
[03:14.400 --> 03:20.240]  and every comedy show out there from Jay Leno to The Daily Show on Comedy Central.
[03:20.240 --> 03:25.480]  Okay, enough about that, ladies and gentlemen. Wow, where to start? We've got big economic
[03:25.480 --> 03:30.280]  news, how that affects the dollar from what's happening in Europe. More mergers of the North
[03:30.280 --> 03:35.400]  American Union with the European Union, that's being picked up in the news. Court won't allow
[03:35.400 --> 03:44.640]  challenge to surveillance law. US State Department-funded BBC World Service is being jammed. Obama is
[03:44.640 --> 03:50.040]  exempt from the sequestration. GOP lawmaker Obama using fake Twitter messages, well, of
[03:50.040 --> 03:51.040]  course they are.
[03:51.040 --> 03:56.840]  That's out of the hill. Americans approve of sequestration to cut TSA, that's one of
[03:56.840 --> 04:04.200]  the most unpopular agencies out there. And that is just some of what is going to be coming
[04:04.200 --> 04:10.740]  up here on the broadcast today. And then we have some big Second Amendment news. All over
[04:10.740 --> 04:19.940]  the country, this latest one is out of Alabama, out of WAAY television, proposed Guntherville's
[04:19.940 --> 04:24.680]  ordinance sparks controversy.
[04:24.680 --> 04:29.780]  And it says that if there's any type of emergency, a storm, a tornado, whatever, that part of
[04:29.780 --> 04:34.940]  an emergency is taking your guns. So if there's an economic emergency, they take your guns.
[04:34.940 --> 04:39.520]  I thought you needed your guns more during an emergency, but that's the FEMA Katrina
[04:39.520 --> 04:43.480]  model of where, oh, you're flooded out, or oh, you're in a hot and dry area, you need
[04:43.480 --> 04:46.200]  guns to protect yourself from looters? No, we're going to just come take your guns and
[04:46.200 --> 04:50.160]  loot your house and let the looters run wild. That's coming up and how it ties into Paul
[04:50.160 --> 04:55.880]  Watson's latest article. Yes, Hitler and Stalin did take the guns. It's reality, ladies and
[04:55.880 --> 05:04.560]  gentlemen, we're going to break it all down straight ahead. Michael Savage.
[05:04.560 --> 05:29.160]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[05:29.160 --> 05:57.280]  And that is ministry leading us in on target for more than two and a half decades. We need
[05:57.280 --> 06:04.360]  to get Al back on the broadcast, another one of our great listeners. Ladies and gentlemen,
[06:04.360 --> 06:12.600]  ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, the 26th day of February, 2013. The one, the only Michael
[06:12.600 --> 06:17.520]  Savage. And guys, I have a copy of his book, but it's in Weldon's office. And we just keep
[06:17.520 --> 06:21.040]  forgetting or I'll go get it during the break, but I really need that.
[06:21.040 --> 06:30.080]  Michael Savage will be joining us coming up today in the third hour to talk about his
[06:30.080 --> 06:35.480]  new book that tries to get into the China takeover threat. The globalists basically
[06:35.480 --> 06:39.820]  selling us out to the communist Chinese and using the Chinese people as the slaves to
[06:39.820 --> 06:45.240]  build the new world order and we'll get into why he's against the flu vaccine, where he
[06:45.240 --> 06:47.160]  thinks the new world order is going.
[06:47.160 --> 06:52.760]  How do you stop Obama and the globalist, the collectivist and their Marxist minions, their
[06:52.760 --> 06:59.120]  useful idiots, all that with Michael Savage who's scheduled. I say that jokingly because
[06:59.120 --> 07:04.680]  he's banned from the UK under thought crimes. He's scheduled to join us coming up in the
[07:04.680 --> 07:11.480]  third hour today. So start your engines on that front, mark your calendars. It is today.
[07:11.480 --> 07:15.720]  I've got all this incredible news we're gonna get to here in just a moment. I was on the
[07:15.720 --> 07:20.440]  Howard Stern show for an hour and a half this morning. I was supposed to be on for 30 minutes.
[07:20.440 --> 07:24.760]  And again, I'm going out there trying to wake up people's audiences. So I went on, I was
[07:24.760 --> 07:30.120]  friendly and I just reached out to Howard and Robin and his crew and started waking
[07:30.120 --> 07:31.320]  them up, Robin especially.
[07:31.320 --> 07:35.680]  She's like, wait a minute, I do know about that and I do know about this. And I would
[07:35.680 --> 07:40.800]  just say wilder and wilder things and then have them Google it and find out that it was
[07:40.800 --> 07:46.320]  true. And I was just blowing them away, silicone and chicken McNuggets, suicidal shrimp and
[07:46.320 --> 07:55.480]  fish on Prozac, aspartame causing diabetes and then throwing CBS News in their face.
[07:55.480 --> 08:03.360]  The bistrene all laid, hyper sexualized and feminized women and feminized men. It was
[08:03.360 --> 08:09.760]  good overall, it was good and I played along with them and so was able to reach out to
[08:09.760 --> 08:14.240]  people because that's my job. That's what I'm here to do. And we're certainly having
[08:14.240 --> 08:16.000]  more and more breakthroughs by the grace of God.
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.860]  I'm very, very thankful. They played the clip of me crying, talking about the globalist
[08:19.860 --> 08:23.120]  hurting children. And they said, is that an actor? Is that real? You can listen to it
[08:23.120 --> 08:33.520]  until it's real. This stuff gets to me. And I try to have a armor of being focused and
[08:33.520 --> 08:41.120]  being manly and being aggressive and also bravada. Kind of arrogance sometimes, it turns
[08:41.120 --> 08:43.120]  up into a sick joke.
[08:43.120 --> 08:48.920]  And I don't come up with this dark satire and humor because I like it at a core level.
[08:48.920 --> 08:58.040]  It's a defense mechanism that I have at a subconscious level because this stuff gets
[08:58.040 --> 09:01.960]  to me and that's why it resonates with people. You get it too. Now here's his new book, A
[09:01.960 --> 09:06.120]  Time for War, Michael Savage. He says he's never seen such censorship of a book. This
[09:06.120 --> 09:09.120]  is a guy who's had a bunch of number one New York Times bestsellers.
[09:09.120 --> 09:13.640]  He's never seen such censorship and such an attempt to block it. So we're gonna be talking
[09:13.640 --> 09:18.080]  about that, coming up with Michael Savage. Okay, that said, ladies and gentlemen, where
[09:18.080 --> 09:22.680]  to begin? Let's punch up DrudgeReport.com for TV viewers. If you're a radio listener,
[09:22.680 --> 09:32.840]  I will break it down for you. All tax, no cut, will he cave in again? And that is John
[09:32.840 --> 09:33.840]  Boehner.
[09:33.840 --> 09:40.420]  Well, of course, he'll cave in again or cave in partially because he's funded by the offshore
[09:40.420 --> 09:48.380]  mega banks that worldwide have the same policies from Germany to Japan to Australia to Costa
[09:48.380 --> 09:52.720]  Rica. I mean, what they want is what they get until we wake up to them. And you can
[09:52.720 --> 10:01.120]  see Bernanke's regional boss right down below him. Bernanke defends indefinite pumping selectively
[10:01.120 --> 10:02.120]  to themselves.
[10:02.120 --> 10:07.000]  And that's why it's creating such incredible inflation and luxury items because only the
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.040]  ultra rich, who are the recipients of this, can buy things for the rest of people. There's
[10:11.040 --> 10:17.400]  even some deflation in what you're being paid, but overall inflation, but not the hyperinflation
[10:17.400 --> 10:24.280]  we're seeing in some areas. Fed faces explaining billion dollar losses in QE exit stress.
[10:24.280 --> 10:30.640]  And I saw a Bloomberg article saying it's 80 something billion a year given to banks.
[10:30.640 --> 10:38.640]  And all they're doing there is focusing on one small little level to talk about 80 plus
[10:38.640 --> 10:44.740]  billion dollars a year. If you expand on it, the MSCI sees the market value of Fed holding
[10:44.740 --> 10:50.480]  shrinking by 547 billion over three years under an adverse scenario that includes an
[10:50.480 --> 10:54.320]  economic contraction and rising inflation.
[10:54.320 --> 10:58.680]  And then it goes on to break down 216 billion. And folks, there's different ways to look
[10:58.680 --> 11:04.080]  at this, but overall, last time they put numbers out a few years ago, it was over 40 something
[11:04.080 --> 11:10.520]  trillion dollars that American taxpayers gave to the private Federal Reserve and its six
[11:10.520 --> 11:14.720]  owning banks. And you're like, well, where does the money go? It goes nowhere. They've
[11:14.720 --> 11:19.840]  already written off the derivatives, most of them.
[11:19.840 --> 11:27.480]  They are just destroying the money to siphon it out of the economy to make you a debt slave
[11:27.480 --> 11:32.940]  because it's all zeros and ones anyways. And I know I talk about that at nauseum. It's
[11:32.940 --> 11:38.360]  because it's the key to everything and it's hidden by the elephant in the room or the
[11:38.360 --> 11:41.640]  little man behind the curtain. If you pull it back, it's a little elephant, little demonic
[11:41.640 --> 11:49.720]  elephant behind the curtain and it makes me sick to see this going on, to see this happening.
[11:49.720 --> 11:55.540]  And Obama and the Congress, they don't see pay cuts under sequestration. In fact, here
[11:55.540 --> 12:02.180]  it is Obama's paycheck exempted from sequestration, CNS News. President Obama won't have to worry
[12:02.180 --> 12:08.040]  about his paycheck in the spending sequestration, including the Budget Control Act that he signed
[12:08.040 --> 12:11.920]  into law in 2011 because he's exempt from it.
[12:11.920 --> 12:15.440]  Well, they're exempt from everything else. They're exempt from insider trading. They're
[12:15.440 --> 12:21.160]  exempt from their own taxes. They're exempt from regulations. They're trying to exempt
[12:21.160 --> 12:28.600]  themselves with bills from gun loss. I mean, that's the essence of tyranny is not just
[12:28.600 --> 12:38.960]  when they oppress you, but then they exempt themselves from that as well.
[12:38.960 --> 12:42.520]  By the way, there's another article I'm going to be getting into. Scientists claim 72 is
[12:42.520 --> 12:49.280]  the new 30. And they're talking about life extension technologies and the way people
[12:49.280 --> 12:53.200]  act and things. It's a complex issue, but they tried to arrest mental development at
[12:53.200 --> 12:59.880]  about the age of a 12-year-old, on average, right as you're becoming a man or a woman.
[12:59.880 --> 13:04.920]  But also, worldwide, population longevity is going down because of all the poisons in
[13:04.920 --> 13:10.000]  the food and water. And then they just have these binary treatments that only keep you
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.000]  alive a little while.
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.080]  You would have died when you were 50, but they keep you alive uncomfortably to 74 or
[13:15.080 --> 13:20.280]  whatever, when our longevity should be going up and up and up. So I heard everybody on
[13:20.280 --> 13:26.200]  talk radio this morning talking about we're living longer, we're 72 is the new 30 bull.
[13:26.200 --> 13:30.600]  People are now getting Alzheimer's in their 30s. People are going into puberty when they're
[13:30.600 --> 13:34.880]  three years old, having babies when they're six, seven, eight, nine, because of all the
[13:34.880 --> 13:35.880]  chemicals.
[13:35.880 --> 13:40.560]  I mean, I was on Howard Stern this morning and I was explaining to him the amphibians,
[13:40.560 --> 13:47.760]  the fish, the crustaceans, the shrimp. They're going into puberty early, they're deformed,
[13:47.760 --> 13:53.200]  they're bisexual, and then it's ha-ha-ha, gay fish. Listen, folks, when you go into
[13:53.200 --> 13:59.240]  puberty when you're nine, I went to puberty when I was 11, back then that was early.
[13:59.240 --> 14:02.540]  People go into puberty now, boys when they're like nine, girls when they're nine, some as
[14:02.540 --> 14:06.960]  young as three are starting to menstruate. Okay, girls are supposed to go into puberty
[14:06.960 --> 14:11.120]  when they're like 14, that's the old global number back when the British studied it worldwide
[14:11.120 --> 14:12.440]  in the 1800s.
[14:12.440 --> 14:18.200]  You're talking about 14 for girls, 13 for boys. On average, now girls it's down to 11
[14:18.200 --> 14:25.400]  on average, boys, it's just bizarre, ladies and gentlemen. Boys actually, in some cases,
[14:25.400 --> 14:28.900]  are going into puberty later because all the estrogen mimicers, or they're having more
[14:28.900 --> 14:35.480]  of a female puberty. They're growing breasts and things when they're seven.
[14:35.480 --> 14:41.480]  And they made jokes about gay shrimp and stuff. I'm like, ha-ha, yeah, but this is real, folks.
[14:41.480 --> 14:44.640]  This is hitting you and hitting your family. And then Howard Stern's like, well, there
[14:44.640 --> 14:48.760]  are too many people. And I'm like, yeah, Howard, but everyone's being targeted by this, so
[14:48.760 --> 14:49.920]  who are you gonna select to kill?
[14:49.920 --> 14:54.520]  And he goes, well, I just don't want more people. Leave everybody alive alone, but that's
[14:54.520 --> 15:02.800]  not where this is going. And the West is dying, the West on average has about 1.5, 1.3, depending
[15:02.800 --> 15:11.040]  on the country, some 1.2, what Italy. Italy a few years ago was actually down to 1.1.
[15:11.040 --> 15:16.960]  Some cities have a 0.9, that's for two adults, a woman and a man in the population. They
[15:16.960 --> 15:22.720]  have less than one child. And then fools send me emails going, how can you have 0.9 children?
[15:22.720 --> 15:30.280]  It's an average, folks. So all of that went on, and we're gonna be going over that.
[15:30.280 --> 15:35.040]  But I wanna cover this first when we get back because I mentioned it yesterday, but I didn't
[15:35.040 --> 15:41.160]  cover it properly. And I didn't play the clip. Robert Gibbs, the former press secretary,
[15:41.160 --> 15:44.680]  saying I was told to say the drone program didn't exist. And he said it was like the
[15:44.680 --> 15:48.960]  Wizard of Oz, the little man behind the curtain, because it was a public program.
[15:48.960 --> 15:55.200]  Yeah, I mean, I've seen press secretaries under Bush as well, get up and say, there
[15:55.200 --> 16:01.000]  is no inflation when there's inflation on record. And then they ask, why do I lie when
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.280]  it's blatantly obvious it's a lie? It's to acclimate everyone to lies, not to even accept
[16:06.280 --> 16:09.200]  them just to wear, well, this is what we do.
[16:09.200 --> 16:14.440]  It's the analogy of like animals all around an apple orchard. And some deer run and eat
[16:14.440 --> 16:19.600]  some apples, and the guards run to protect that, the farmer does, the person managing
[16:19.600 --> 16:24.160]  the orchard. And then some squirrels run in and eat it, and then some pigs run and eat
[16:24.160 --> 16:29.840]  some. And then a bear comes in and eat some, and then a badger comes in and starts eating
[16:29.840 --> 16:33.120]  them. And you can't stop them all from just rushing in.
[16:33.120 --> 16:38.280]  And that's the psychological thing at play here. Where I'm on the radio going, hey, they're
[16:38.280 --> 16:43.120]  putting cancer viruses in your vaccine, here's the name of it, SV40, they're killing you,
[16:43.120 --> 16:50.480]  and it's ha ha ha gay fish. And I'm like, hey, this is affecting you and your family.
[16:50.480 --> 16:56.360]  I mean, and I understand people just are in this giggling mode where they can't get out
[16:56.360 --> 17:02.440]  of it. It's mind control.
[17:26.360 --> 17:33.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live here, ladies and gentlemen. And let's get into this
[17:33.960 --> 17:39.040]  article because it's a window into everything we're talking about. We have several articles
[17:39.040 --> 17:46.000]  dealing with this up at Infowars.com. Yes, Hitler and Stalin did take the guns. A fake
[17:46.000 --> 17:51.560]  meme was put out by a whole bunch of so-called liberal authoritarian websites that we have
[17:51.560 --> 17:57.040]  a link to saying that Hitler didn't take any guns and that authoritarian Stalin doesn't
[17:57.040 --> 17:58.040]  take guns either.
[17:58.040 --> 18:04.440]  When you type in Hitler and gun control, that's all the top links. Bizarrely enough, along
[18:04.440 --> 18:08.900]  with some Nazi sites saying Hitler was pro-gun and didn't take anybody's guns. So we have
[18:08.900 --> 18:17.280]  links to that debunking the meme that historical gun grabs are carried out by dictatorships.
[18:17.280 --> 18:22.800]  Again, debunking the meme that historical gun grabs by dictatorships is a myth.
[18:22.800 --> 18:28.380]  And then the other big gun news here, city wants power to disarm individuals during crisis.
[18:28.380 --> 18:35.120]  Any type of emergency, like a hurricane or tornado, a storm, just like we saw in Katrina.
[18:35.120 --> 18:43.080]  That's up at Infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Now, going over this clip, former Obama press
[18:43.080 --> 18:51.720]  secretary was ordered to act as if drone program did not exist.
[18:51.720 --> 18:58.680]  The first rule of the drone program is that you do not talk about the drone program. And
[18:58.680 --> 19:04.160]  Steve Watson wrote an article about this. It was also picked up by some other publications.
[19:04.160 --> 19:10.200]  But the point is, is that it's not like he was told don't admit some secret torture program,
[19:10.200 --> 19:14.080]  which we know Obama's continuing and has been caught doing. And then putting out zero dark
[19:14.080 --> 19:18.760]  30 movies about how the White House was involved in that about how he blocked the torture program,
[19:18.760 --> 19:19.760]  another lie.
[19:19.760 --> 19:26.200]  And the idea that the torture program actually saved America, more lies. The name of the
[19:26.200 --> 19:32.980]  film should be Zero Dark Easter Bunny. But the larger issue here is that Gibbs is up
[19:32.980 --> 19:36.800]  there saying it's like the Wizard of Oz, the little guy behind the curtain, because the
[19:36.800 --> 19:42.400]  drone program is all over the foreign nose. It's admitted to be going on, and that Gibbs
[19:42.400 --> 19:46.900]  was told to just say it doesn't exist if people brought it up to him.
[19:46.900 --> 19:52.640]  And so he's now on MSNBC and on CNN doing interviews. He goes on all of them saying
[19:52.640 --> 19:57.160]  basically the same thing now. Yeah, I knew it was silly, but that's just part of what
[19:57.160 --> 20:02.840]  we do. Just like when he got everybody on board the aircraft at Dallas outside DC and
[20:02.840 --> 20:08.700]  Virginia. I was there, I was covering it just miles away at Boulderburg in 2008.
[20:08.700 --> 20:12.480]  And the jet takes off, they close the door. And the media, because there's footage of
[20:12.480 --> 20:15.800]  this, the raw footage was put out on the news. They're like, where's Obama? We were told
[20:15.800 --> 20:20.520]  he's going to Chicago on this plane. We went, sorry, a decision was made with some people.
[20:20.520 --> 20:24.000]  Cuz that's when they decided Hillary was gonna step down, Obama was gonna get the presidency.
[20:24.000 --> 20:25.600]  It's why Gibbs was so excited.
[20:25.600 --> 20:30.040]  And Gibbs is having this euphoric rushing and hardly talking. He goes, is there some
[20:30.040 --> 20:35.560]  meetings that people wanna have in private? This is an Obama deception. And so the decision
[20:35.560 --> 20:40.680]  was made, sorry, yeah, we shanghahed you, you're going to Chicago without the president.
[20:40.680 --> 20:44.200]  And then the media ran around going, where's the president? And even when I told them,
[20:44.200 --> 20:47.500]  they were not allowed to come show where he was at with Hillary with the Secret Service
[20:47.500 --> 20:52.740]  and the Marines pointing MP5 submachine guns at us.
[20:52.740 --> 20:58.140]  So it just shows the control. There is no Bilderberg, there is no drone program, there
[20:58.140 --> 21:02.680]  is no Aspartame. Aspartame doesn't give you diabetes and cancer, even though they admit
[21:02.680 --> 21:07.200]  it does. And yeah, there's cancer viruses in most vaccines, but so what, dying's fine.
[21:07.200 --> 21:11.720]  Cuz we care about the children. Sandy Hook, we're very upset, ban all the guns for the
[21:11.720 --> 21:15.820]  20 kids, we really care, even though we say there's too many people, let's kill everybody.
[21:15.820 --> 21:21.160]  So here he is now, just like Karl Rove told the New York Times six years ago, we control
[21:21.160 --> 21:26.080]  reality now. And if they told us the Statue of Liberty didn't exist, it'd be true. If
[21:26.080 --> 21:29.720]  they said that the Golden Gate Bridge didn't exist, it'd be true.
[21:29.720 --> 21:35.640]  Because they control reality because we believe what they say. They've got the general public
[21:35.640 --> 21:42.680]  in a trance for the point of Gibbs now going on TV making jokes about lying to people.
[21:42.680 --> 21:47.600]  And see, this is sophisticated. People are like, he's mea coping. No, he's not. It's
[21:47.600 --> 21:55.280]  all part of a flaunting it in your face, okay? It's all part of flaunting it in your face.
[21:55.280 --> 21:56.280]  Here's that clip.
[21:56.280 --> 22:00.600]  When I went through the process of becoming press secretary, one of the first things they
[22:00.600 --> 22:05.660]  told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program. You're not even to discuss
[22:05.660 --> 22:11.380]  that it exists. And so I would get a question like that, and literally I couldn't tell you
[22:11.380 --> 22:15.640]  what major asked, because once I figured out it was about the drone program, I realized
[22:15.640 --> 22:21.440]  I'm not supposed to talk about it. But here's what's inherently crazy about that proposition.
[22:21.440 --> 22:28.920]  You're being asked a question based on reporting of a program that exists. So you're the official
[22:28.920 --> 22:34.320]  government spokesperson acting as if the entire program, pay no attention to the man behind
[22:34.320 --> 22:35.320]  the curtain.
[22:35.320 --> 22:38.400]  We're going to be right back after this quick break. Stay with us. We will expose the man
[22:38.400 --> 23:06.400]  behind the curtain, info wars.com. By the way, I've got to tell you about that. They
[23:06.400 --> 23:13.400]  are a lot of people.
[23:13.400 --> 23:24.640]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lives of disinformation. It's the Alex Jones show
[23:24.640 --> 23:54.440]  on the radio network. I can do my own intro. I love this part of the song.
[23:54.440 --> 23:59.960]  Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 PM Eastern. We're here, don't forget weeknights, 7 o'clock
[23:59.960 --> 24:05.400]  central. I'm going to get back into the news. And yes, my son is going to be in studio in
[24:05.400 --> 24:16.920]  about an hour. He's here at work with me today. And I want to get him in studio because he
[24:16.920 --> 24:19.440]  came up with some pretty funny jokes this morning.
[24:19.440 --> 24:25.280]  He was listening to the rebroadcast of the radio show this morning here at the office
[24:25.280 --> 24:30.600]  while it was getting ready. And he saw the Obama Bytes piece because the rebroadcast
[24:30.600 --> 24:36.400]  is also on TV monitors in there on the green room as we restream the video. And he saw
[24:36.400 --> 24:41.280]  Mike Adams here in studio talking about Obama Bytes, the little joke thing that he came
[24:41.280 --> 24:48.240]  up with, with the different things, the ingredients it's made in China.
[24:48.240 --> 24:54.860]  And it's got squeezium and the government robbing you. It's got Obama-ism turning you
[24:54.860 --> 24:59.840]  into a communist. Seize-ism, where they seize everything you've got. Feinstein-ium that
[24:59.840 --> 25:07.520]  turns demonic gargoyles into US senators. Well, my son, who I'm still not going to show,
[25:07.520 --> 25:14.840]  but he can talk on the radio. He'll just go by Little Alex. His name's not Alex, but we're
[25:14.840 --> 25:19.120]  still protecting his identity for another season, probably.
[25:19.120 --> 25:27.000]  He's going to be in there. He came up with a whole list, 19 different ones. But he added
[25:27.000 --> 25:38.040]  a part that luckily it has no freedom, life-ium, happiness-im, destinism, I guess your destiny,
[25:38.040 --> 25:49.240]  not made in America. And he came up with Hopian-ism, fake hope that leads you to communism. Tyranny-ism,
[25:49.240 --> 25:52.080]  he can pronounce all this better than I can. I've had like three hours' sleep, folks. I
[25:52.080 --> 25:58.720]  got up at 4 AM for the Howard Stern show this morning. Radium, sheepy, some of these I understand.
[25:58.720 --> 26:02.560]  Others I'm going to find out what he's talking about. Sheepy-ism or sheep-ism, you know what
[26:02.560 --> 26:10.200]  that is. So there's 19 of these. And so he'll pop in for part of a segment with us at the
[26:10.200 --> 26:16.080]  bottom of the next hour for a little while ahead of Michael Savage scheduled to join
[26:16.080 --> 26:17.080]  us.
[26:17.080 --> 26:23.400]  And by the way, we are going to do an in-depth hour-long interview with Ted Nugent on Thursday.
[26:23.400 --> 26:29.340]  Ted Nugent will be joining us at noon with breaking news and some of the behind-the-scenes
[26:29.340 --> 26:34.200]  stuff, how he's been persecuted by the feds and others in his TV show. That is all going
[26:34.200 --> 26:41.560]  to be breaking and where he thinks the NRA should be taken to the next level of offense.
[26:41.560 --> 26:46.560]  All that is coming up on Thursday with Ted Nugent. He called into the show. We talked
[26:46.560 --> 26:51.060]  about a lot of things on Sunday and we got in touch with him yesterday. And so that is
[26:51.060 --> 27:02.160]  coming up. That is coming up pronto on good old Thursday. So stay with us for that.
[27:02.160 --> 27:07.020]  And I do have a big story we're working on as promised. And it looks like it's going
[27:07.020 --> 27:11.100]  to happen, but we'll see when it happens. See, I usually stay up till about midnight
[27:11.100 --> 27:17.000]  and then I get up at like 5 a.m. but I sleep like the dead. You have at 5, 6 a.m. And then
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.520]  last night I went to bed about 930 but then didn't sleep and kept waking up because I
[27:20.520 --> 27:21.980]  had to get up early.
[27:21.980 --> 27:26.680]  And I woke up at like, I went to bed probably about midnight, finally went to sleep after
[27:26.680 --> 27:30.160]  laying in bed for like two, three hours. You know how that, that doesn't usually happen
[27:30.160 --> 27:34.920]  to me unless I've got to get up really early. And then, I don't know why I'm telling this,
[27:34.920 --> 27:38.880]  just I'm having real trouble thinking today. I'm out of gas, ladies and gentlemen. I don't
[27:38.880 --> 27:39.880]  feel bad. I'm just out of gas.
[27:39.880 --> 27:46.200]  And to make a long story short, I'm sure I'll wake up when Savage gets on with us. Then
[27:46.200 --> 27:52.880]  I woke up at 3 a.m. and I lay there till 3.30 a.m. And I was at IHOP this morning at 4 a.m.
[27:52.880 --> 27:55.880]  when it opened.
[27:55.880 --> 28:00.840]  Jumped up, took a shower, jumped in the car, drove to IHOP. They're usually 24 hour, but
[28:00.840 --> 28:04.000]  their power was off here. Stay from the windstorm. So I walk up, they open the door, I go in
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.920]  and eat. I got here to the office, I took my time at 5 a.m. And so I guess it's the
[28:08.920 --> 28:16.840]  afternoon now for me and the crew, the crew doing a great job in there.
[28:16.840 --> 28:23.720]  You're almost as good as Judge Smales. All right, ladies and gentlemen. All right, Billy,
[28:23.720 --> 28:30.640]  it's Danny, sir. Enough of that. I need to reset, refocus. Do we have David Knight's
[28:30.640 --> 28:37.840]  online film festival piece? We do have that? I wanna cue that up. And then I'm gonna drink
[28:37.840 --> 28:42.480]  a glass of water here and I think splash some water on my face and all I need to do is like
[28:42.480 --> 28:46.000]  look at a picture of Dianne Feinstein and I'll wake me up and get angry.
[28:46.000 --> 28:54.680]  A tyrant pig. And then after I get awoken here, we will come back because the news is
[28:54.680 --> 29:00.360]  all off the chart. I mean, globalist flaunting tyranny in our face, mega banks imploding
[29:00.360 --> 29:05.920]  things by design, fight clubs at high schools. They're discovering, I thought every high
[29:05.920 --> 29:11.160]  school was a fight club. Is the media just discovering that high school is a fight club?
[29:11.160 --> 29:15.800]  I literally, that's how I describe my high school. It was fight club, man, fight club.
[29:15.800 --> 29:19.520]  We had the coolest coaches and stuff. Even people had their heads split open and stuff,
[29:19.520 --> 29:23.480]  they wouldn't call the police on you. Anyways, but I guess we're all on estrogen now, so
[29:23.480 --> 29:25.440]  everything's fine.
[29:25.440 --> 29:33.360]  We're all gonna go quietly into the New World Order night. Anyways, continuing here, with
[29:33.360 --> 29:37.400]  Gibbs, I was told not to acknowledge the existence of drone program, just amazing. A program
[29:37.400 --> 29:42.480]  that admittedly existed, because the psych warfare chiefs know maybe 60% of the public
[29:42.480 --> 29:45.720]  doesn't know one way or the other, even if it's admitted, and then they'll just believe
[29:45.720 --> 29:46.720]  if Gibbs lies.
[29:46.720 --> 29:51.000]  If you like Gibbs going, there is no New York City. And the whole White House press corps
[29:51.000 --> 29:56.080]  goes, okay, cuz if you don't agree, you're never let back in. Politico, okay, I'm awake,
[29:56.080 --> 30:03.200]  they just showed Feinstein, show her again. It's like a bull in a red cape, show me the
[30:03.200 --> 30:12.720]  enemy, he wants to enslave my family. Put her on screen again, make me so angry, yes,
[30:12.720 --> 30:18.400]  adrenals give me power, unlimited power.
[30:18.400 --> 30:30.960]  Turning into Emperor Palpatine, excuse me, man. All right, there, good, actually worked,
[30:30.960 --> 30:38.680]  very good, very good. Can you put it back up on screen, please? Okay, there we go. It,
[30:38.680 --> 30:43.360]  you notice I said, look at the other its behind her. I mean, what? I didn't know they stacked
[30:43.360 --> 30:46.840]  sacks of vermin that high.
[30:46.840 --> 30:55.200]  I mean, I never saw a rat wearing big blue green turquoise beads around her neck. I mean,
[30:55.200 --> 31:00.640]  boy, doesn't she just look like some evil general or something? I mean, you put a Hitler
[31:00.640 --> 31:05.840]  mustache on that lady, holy Toledo. My gosh, did you think of that? We gave her a Buzz
[31:05.840 --> 31:11.000]  haircut or a Hitler style haircut, and then gave her a, look at that, or Stalin.
[31:11.000 --> 31:17.300]  Now Stalin isn't that ugly. Look at that, look at that enemy, just has an instinct to
[31:17.300 --> 31:24.300]  dominate you and your family. Wants to squat on you like a giant squatty potty. All right,
[31:24.300 --> 31:31.280]  we better stop it right now, ladies and gentlemen. So I can, Dr. Strangelove, stop it. And he's
[31:31.280 --> 31:38.040]  like, all right, this is what goes on around here, ladies and gentlemen.
[31:38.040 --> 31:42.240]  No, I mean, the stress is getting to me, that's what's happening. And my defense mechanism
[31:42.240 --> 31:49.740]  is to start screwing around. Boy, Gibbs, I was told not to acknowledge the existence
[31:49.740 --> 31:56.580]  of drone program when it admittedly existed. So I wanna play a little clip about the big
[31:56.580 --> 31:59.320]  film contest that's getting a lot of excitement.
[31:59.320 --> 32:02.160]  I'm finding out from filmmakers around the country that a lot of serious filmmakers are
[32:02.160 --> 32:05.440]  involved, but also small time people. And who knows whether it'll be big time or small
[32:05.440 --> 32:09.960]  time, could be a small time person wins. Infowars.com forward slash contest, we're gonna talk about
[32:09.960 --> 32:10.960]  that in a moment.

[34:15.760 --> 34:22.840]  on and commit and come in for the big win to quote Full Metal Jacket. You know what,
[34:22.840 --> 34:28.820]  I get neurotic about this. What is the full quote on Full Metal Jacket? Let me see, Full
[34:28.820 --> 34:39.080]  Metal Jacket come in for the big win. I love that, it sounds like how my grandpa, my dad's
[34:39.080 --> 34:40.080]  dad used to talk.
[34:40.080 --> 34:44.720]  Here, let me see this, Full Metal Jacket, man, this computer needs to be restarted.
[34:44.720 --> 34:48.560]  Now, that's not the drill, Sarge, it's when they got the mass grave they found and the
[34:48.560 --> 34:52.920]  guy's wearing a peace sign as a sick joke. And he goes, what is that, some kind of sick
[34:52.920 --> 34:57.480]  joke? And he goes, no, sir, it's something about the duality of men, duality of men.
[34:57.480 --> 35:05.440]  Yes, sir, and he goes, he threatens to court-martial him, he doesn't pay attention. Why don't you
[35:05.440 --> 35:11.680]  jump on the team and come in for the big win? Joker, yes, sir. Colonel, son, all I've asked
[35:11.680 --> 35:15.840]  of my Marines is they obey my orders as if it was the word of God.
[35:15.840 --> 35:21.600]  Yeah, there's the quote. Why don't you jump on the team and come in for the big win? I
[35:21.600 --> 35:26.240]  just love that. Why don't you just jump on the team, stop bending over to government
[35:26.240 --> 35:30.460]  corruption and ridiculous propaganda that treats you like you're a total moron and come
[35:30.460 --> 35:32.460]  in for the big win?
[35:32.460 --> 35:36.920]  All you gotta do is stop believing they're baloney, get informed, get involved, take
[35:36.920 --> 35:41.920]  control of your destiny, ask God to kick you in the butt and let's go, let's go, let's
[35:41.920 --> 35:47.920]  go. I'm sick of it, I'm tired of playing games. This is a joke that we're being taken this
[35:47.920 --> 35:54.320]  easily, it's ridiculous. Get out of the mind control, break your trance.
[35:54.320 --> 36:00.040]  Why don't you jump on the team and come in for the big win? Why don't you jump on the
[36:00.040 --> 36:04.620]  team and come in for the big win? Why don't you jump on the team and come in for the big
[36:04.620 --> 36:12.160]  win? Why don't you jump on the team and come in for the big win? Yes, yes. Why don't you
[36:12.160 --> 36:14.740]  jump on the team and come in for the big win?
[36:14.740 --> 36:19.460]  Why don't you get with the program America and the rest of the world that you're being
[36:19.460 --> 36:24.040]  screwed seven ways to Sunday. And it's getting worse by the minute and the government's arming
[36:24.040 --> 36:29.720]  the teeth against us and absolutely gearing up for a physical purge. Instead of that scaring you,
[36:29.720 --> 36:34.120]  you should know that if you oppose them now, they will be destroyed politically.
[36:34.120 --> 36:39.080]  But if you bend over to these people and roll over and lie down and get on your knees, folks,
[36:39.080 --> 36:49.160]  it is over. All over the country, they're announcing martial law in different towns,
[36:49.160 --> 36:56.920]  daytime curfews for even adults, checkpoints, gang checkpoints. Now, if there's ever an emergency,
[36:56.920 --> 37:01.320]  everyone must turn their guns in. It's a new city law. That's up at infoawards.com.
[37:01.320 --> 37:07.000]  I mean, it's just come on. And it's that instinct of the tyrants. They've already taken our banks
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.440]  over, taken our money over. They already run everything. They're already jacking us with
[37:10.440 --> 37:14.360]  poison, but they're afraid we might wake up. And so they're like, let's just take all the
[37:14.360 --> 37:18.200]  guns and bring in total journey. Let's have a national compulsory service. That's all
[37:18.200 --> 37:23.160]  being announced. They're graduating FEMA Corps now of crazy ne'er-do-wells.
[37:23.960 --> 37:28.200]  It's all these teenagers with their arms crossed behind their backs all overweight,
[37:28.200 --> 37:31.720]  like staring hatefully, like they think they're about to kick everybody's butt.
[37:31.720 --> 37:35.320]  I mean, if that's what the new world order is gonna use against us, it's just,
[37:38.760 --> 37:39.960]  but it's so crazy.
[37:39.960 --> 37:45.960]  It's like laughing and crying at the same time.
[37:47.240 --> 37:49.960]  I guess after that point, you then go into like Woody Woodpecker. He goes,
[37:51.400 --> 37:56.440]  when he like bounces around and then we should come back with Woody Woodpecker.
[37:57.240 --> 38:00.440]  You know what we're gonna come back with? We're gonna come back, ladies and gentlemen,
[38:03.800 --> 38:08.280]  with the David Knight quick piece and then I'll get into the news. I promise I will comport
[38:08.280 --> 38:16.040]  myself and get to it all. But I do think the time has come, the time is now. Marvin K. Mooney must
[38:16.040 --> 38:24.440]  go now. I think it is time for me to take a week vacation. The only problem is I have to absolutely
[38:24.440 --> 38:30.360]  turn off the computer and go somewhere, which I can't do, cuz I do need to reset.
[38:30.360 --> 38:38.360]  I absolutely do. Go fishing. Maybe rent a cabin somewhere.
[38:41.720 --> 38:48.360]  I do need to do that. We all get so busy in the rat race, the system knows that. And that's why
[38:48.360 --> 38:51.560]  people don't even wanna hear this stuff. They think it's like work I'm trying to give them.
[38:51.560 --> 38:55.640]  It's gonna be a lot of work if we don't get government and corrupt insider mafia's off our
[38:55.640 --> 39:03.160]  back. Listen to these headlines. Obama, window of opportunity for Iran attack open in June.
[39:03.720 --> 39:10.280]  Totally bizarre, infoawars.com. That's quotes by the State Department Obama.
[39:10.280 --> 39:14.200]  US dairy industry petitions FDA to approve aspartame as hidden,
[39:14.200 --> 39:17.400]  unlabeled additive in milk, yogurt, eggnog, and cream,
[39:17.400 --> 39:20.440]  which they admit gives you type 2 diabetes and cancer on record.
[39:20.440 --> 39:24.360]  Killed baby rhesus monkeys in the studies in the 70s is why they couldn't get it approved.
[39:24.360 --> 39:28.440]  But now it's for your children. Just god awful evil where you don't get to know.
[39:29.320 --> 39:31.560]  Not just GMO, now aspartame and MSG.
[39:34.920 --> 39:39.240]  I hope you're ready. The sell off today is the start, not the end. That's an article up at
[39:39.240 --> 39:48.920]  infoawars.com. We're gonna get into really the big news here. City one,
[39:48.920 --> 39:56.600]  power to disarm individuals during crisis. Gunthersville authorities,
[39:56.600 --> 40:00.680]  they're authorities, they're not servants, but confiscate guns of unruly individuals
[40:00.680 --> 40:05.640]  during disasters. That means people they're like, hey, we don't like you trying to make us
[40:05.640 --> 40:11.720]  enforce labor brigades. And it goes on actually here in the article to say that just during crises,
[40:11.720 --> 40:16.200]  period. I mean, see Watson's great, but it's even worse than he's saying it's
[40:16.200 --> 40:21.160]  disarmed individuals during a disaster. And then it says anyone who's unruly.
[40:22.040 --> 40:24.920]  And then we've got our article, yes, Hitler and Stalin did take the guns.
[40:25.720 --> 40:33.880]  And then we've got the sequestration right now. We're gonna be getting into that and we're gonna
[40:33.880 --> 40:36.840]  be getting into what's happening with the globalist. And then we're gonna be getting
[40:36.840 --> 40:44.120]  into this little jewel. GOP lawmaker Obama using fake Twitter messages in fight over gun control.
[40:44.120 --> 40:47.240]  Of course they are. It's sign off robots.
[41:14.120 --> 41:23.000]  All right, folks, welcome back. Thank you for joining us. It's not deja vu.
[41:23.000 --> 41:28.280]  I thought we'd play this piece twice so that we could just think about where this society
[41:28.280 --> 41:33.400]  and this culture has gone. And we all need to reflect on the rampant corruption because
[41:33.400 --> 41:38.360]  when you just give into corruption, it takes over. That's why we launched Operation Paul Revere.
[41:39.400 --> 41:43.240]  And there's already a huge response a month into it. You've got two months to make a film,
[41:43.240 --> 41:48.440]  whether it's three minutes or two hours long. And first place is $100,000. And I'm doing this
[41:48.440 --> 41:54.040]  because it's going to create hundreds of powerful films, promoting liberty, exposing tyranny.
[41:54.040 --> 42:00.600]  That's the goal. And then out of that, we will find a group of people to work with to make
[42:00.600 --> 42:05.800]  films to put out not just on DVD or on the Internet, but to also put out in theaters.
[42:05.800 --> 42:12.840]  Infowars.com produced films out of them, out of the group or stable of champions
[42:13.400 --> 42:18.600]  that come out of this. So right now, let's go ahead and play this breakdown with myself
[42:18.600 --> 42:21.880]  and our reporter who's heading up the contest. I'm the judge, but
[42:21.880 --> 42:24.840]  he's coordinating it. Our own David Knight. Here it is.
[42:27.720 --> 42:34.040]  Operation Paul Revere, the largest film contest out there right now. $115,000 in cash prizes,
[42:34.040 --> 42:38.520]  as well as an opportunity to get before a huge audience. If you're a film professional,
[42:38.520 --> 42:43.320]  this is your chance to get to hundreds of thousands of people on just our YouTube channel.
[42:43.320 --> 42:46.440]  Alex, tell us a little bit about what you're trying to do with this film contest.
[42:46.440 --> 42:51.480]  Well, David, about a month ago, we launched this and it's got a small window of three months
[42:51.480 --> 42:57.880]  because tyranny is taking over this country. And whatever your idea of liberty is out there,
[42:57.880 --> 43:01.960]  we want you to make a short film or even be a long film.
[43:01.960 --> 43:07.640]  The rules are at infoawards.com forward slash contest to resist this tyranny. That's why we're
[43:07.640 --> 43:13.800]  calling it Operation Paul Revere. And you could be what you call a liberal, a conservative,
[43:13.800 --> 43:18.280]  a constitutionalist, a libertarian. It could be a three minute piece. It could be a two hour piece.
[43:18.280 --> 43:25.160]  It could be fiction, nonfiction, drama, a musical. We want to just encourage that dynamic
[43:25.160 --> 43:31.160]  human spirit to get involved and to go out there and warn and awaken people
[43:31.160 --> 43:36.520]  to become politically involved themselves. So we're trying to initiate brushfires in the minds
[43:36.520 --> 43:41.320]  of men and women out there in the animating contest for liberty to get them to cause a chain
[43:41.320 --> 43:47.640]  reaction to get other people to do it as well. And the goal is get hundreds and hundreds of
[43:47.640 --> 43:51.240]  great pieces out there, great art, great research to get people thinking.
[43:51.880 --> 43:57.880]  And then to have three winners, $100,000 for first place, 10,000 for second, 5,000 for third.
[43:57.880 --> 44:04.280]  But then out of that group of winners and runners up, we can then communicate with people and
[44:05.160 --> 44:12.440]  hire a crew to make two or three different films a year and to actually finance it and then try
[44:12.440 --> 44:16.280]  to put it in theaters and things like that. So it's coming up. Deadline is April 30th.
[44:16.280 --> 44:20.200]  Oh, your point about the film festival. Explain that to people. That's the most important.
[44:20.200 --> 44:23.880]  Well, you know, that's one of the things people are looking for audiences, right?
[44:23.880 --> 44:27.880]  And the Cannes Film Festival, they got a couple hundred thousand people go to that. But that's one
[44:27.880 --> 44:32.120]  of the biggest ones. Most of these film festivals, you're only going to have about 10, 15,000 people
[44:32.120 --> 44:37.240]  there. Not all of them are going to see your film. With this, you've got 417,000 people
[44:37.240 --> 44:39.880]  just on your one YouTube channel. And that's just the subscribers.
[44:39.880 --> 44:43.720]  Right. So, I mean, one of the things that's really key for filmmakers is they want an audience. They
[44:43.720 --> 44:47.160]  want people to see their work. And this is a great chance for people to see what they can do.
[44:47.960 --> 44:52.920]  It's kind of like an online virtual film festival. And I hadn't thought of that, but I mean,
[44:52.920 --> 44:58.360]  that's exactly what it is. A giant online virtual film festival where the public, a radio show,
[44:58.360 --> 45:02.760]  a giant YouTube channel, they see your work. We debate it. We talk about it. You got a chance
[45:02.760 --> 45:08.520]  to win $115,000. Take a look at infowars.com slash contest, and you'll find all the information
[45:08.520 --> 45:12.360]  there. It's pretty open. There's not a lot of requirements there, but there are a few.
[45:12.360 --> 45:16.680]  So take a look at what we've got there. Put your hat in the ring. Be part of the solution
[45:16.680 --> 45:21.560]  to the corruption and oppression. Be part of the resistance to tyranny. We're looking
[45:21.560 --> 45:25.240]  for the Paul Revere's that will drive a stake for the new world.
[45:30.600 --> 45:34.680]  This is GCN, the Genesis communications radio network.
[45:41.400 --> 45:48.680]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[45:48.680 --> 45:57.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[46:11.240 --> 46:16.520]  I'm pretty excited with Michael Savage coming up. And I shouldn't be a pig here. I should open the
[46:16.520 --> 46:20.440]  phones up for everybody too. We'll do that in the next segment. Take some calls this hour.
[46:22.120 --> 46:26.440]  It really is overwhelming. Just what's happening in Europe. I could spend the whole show on
[46:27.240 --> 46:32.200]  how they just put Berlusconi back in. There's a three party deal in their Senate.
[46:33.400 --> 46:37.160]  Looks like he could be back in control of the country soon. We'll see how this shakes out.
[46:37.160 --> 46:42.440]  Total bizarro gangster, but he does make the globalist mad and that he won't totally bankrupt
[46:42.440 --> 46:48.600]  Italy. So the Italians like him. And the bond markets and the globalist are freaking out.
[46:48.600 --> 46:53.640]  I saw a quote from Zero Hedge from the TV news where one of the bond companies is like,
[46:53.640 --> 47:01.240]  for the first time, a European country has voted wrong. I mean, they installed leaders like Mario
[47:01.240 --> 47:08.520]  Monti in Italy and others in Greece. I mean, they tried that business in Iceland. They just
[47:08.520 --> 47:13.000]  stood down and passively protested for a year till the whole government fell apart.
[47:13.000 --> 47:17.640]  Now they've arrested the government. A whole bunch of them are arrested. And it's just at
[47:17.640 --> 47:21.080]  a certain point you call the bluff. But if you just go along and follow any order,
[47:21.640 --> 47:26.200]  well then live under Stalin, live under Kim Jong Il or Mao Tse Tung for that matter.
[47:26.920 --> 47:33.480]  So we're gonna be breaking all of that down here. It just blows me away, the whole Robert
[47:33.480 --> 47:39.960]  Gibbs thing. I've got to say that that really does take the cake. Just arrogantly saying,
[47:39.960 --> 47:43.400]  well, the drone program was admitted, but I was told to say it didn't exist.
[47:43.400 --> 47:48.360]  Which was crazy because it's admitted to exist. Yeah, Gibbs, that's probably why you got kicked
[47:48.360 --> 47:55.560]  out. You're not evil enough to fully understand how this works, son. They're there to subconsciously
[47:55.560 --> 48:02.360]  condition people to accept lies and then run away from the truth. But Obama warned spending cuts
[48:02.360 --> 48:10.680]  could idle ship builder. President Obama is arguing that looming government wide spending
[48:10.680 --> 48:16.120]  cuts could idle military resources like naval aircraft carriers while Republicans are criticizing
[48:16.760 --> 48:21.000]  the president for taking his arguments outside Washington instead of staying
[48:21.640 --> 48:24.600]  to work out a plan before Friday's deadline.
[48:24.600 --> 48:28.440]  And again, it's the same thing that Europe's been put in over and over again,
[48:28.440 --> 48:34.200]  where they maneuver you into a collapse position, get more banker bailouts, more money,
[48:34.200 --> 48:38.520]  trillions more for foreign banks. And then a few years later, my gosh, it's looming again.
[48:38.520 --> 48:42.280]  And then all it does is maneuver you into bankruptcy, where the banks end up with all
[48:42.280 --> 48:46.280]  your tax money from bailing them out. And then you've got to pay off the debts of the money
[48:46.280 --> 48:54.200]  you gave them. And it's so simple, it's complex. It's like, how about I come by your house and
[48:54.200 --> 49:00.200]  rob and kill you? And how about you pay me to do it? And you're like, yeah, let me give you all
[49:00.200 --> 49:05.560]  the money in my bank account to come over and torture me and rob me and kill me. That's a good
[49:05.560 --> 49:11.800]  idea, isn't it? Yeah, that's a great idea. Yeah, let the foreign banks sign me onto their
[49:11.800 --> 49:16.120]  derivatives, it's not my debt, and run the country in the hole on purpose and have police in black
[49:16.120 --> 49:21.000]  uniforms and checkpoints and classical tyranny. And then we bail you out for tens of trillions.
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.680]  And then you sign us onto that debt and lecture us all day, and then exempt yourselves offshore
[49:26.680 --> 49:33.720]  from all the taxes. Gee, I wish we had one of them doomsday machines too, to quote Dr. Strangelove.
[49:33.720 --> 49:39.880]  I mean, it is just craziness, but the general public doesn't know how this stuff works.
[49:39.880 --> 49:45.960]  That's how the system is getting away with it. Just like they had a concerted effort after I
[49:45.960 --> 49:52.280]  was on Piers Morgan to have Salon and Daily Beast and all of them go, Hitler didn't take guns,
[49:52.280 --> 49:59.000]  he was pro-gun, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then we linked to the Weimar Republic laws that
[49:59.000 --> 50:04.840]  were never implemented that he implemented. Just like Obama's now saying that the Brady
[50:04.840 --> 50:08.120]  bill means even if you haven't been adjudicated mentally ill, they can take your guns.
[50:08.120 --> 50:11.560]  You're like, where's the law? Well, we say it says that, and the ATF does what we say.
[50:11.560 --> 50:17.880]  And then in the 38 gun control act that Hitler did get passed. But the point is, he did take
[50:17.880 --> 50:22.280]  the guns from the groups he was targeting, and they highly restricted the others. And anyone
[50:22.280 --> 50:25.880]  that denies that is a liar, and we have the proof in this article. So go get our article,
[50:25.880 --> 50:29.880]  push it to the top of Google results. We'll be right back, stay with us.
[50:29.880 --> 50:47.880]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[50:47.880 --> 51:00.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[51:00.520 --> 51:03.960]  Well, we're less than an hour out from Michael Savage joining us
[51:05.400 --> 51:08.280]  with a lot of breaking news and intel from the flu shot,
[51:08.840 --> 51:13.560]  why he's against it to the China threat he believes is the number one thing on the horizon.
[51:13.560 --> 51:19.720]  I happen to agree with him. That is all coming up, ladies and gentlemen. Some unbelievable news
[51:19.720 --> 51:24.920]  up at infallwars.com. City wants power to disarm individuals during any crisis.
[51:26.280 --> 51:32.040]  Guntersville, Alabama, Mayor Lee Dollar is working with city officials, not servants,
[51:32.040 --> 51:37.400]  but masters, to pass an ordinance that would give police the power to disarm individuals.
[51:38.120 --> 51:42.360]  During a disaster, a chilling example of how the Second Amendment is being assaulted via
[51:42.360 --> 51:50.920]  the back door. ABC 31 reports, and of course, that is a example of what happened in Katrina.
[51:50.920 --> 51:55.720]  The time you need your guns from looters and people, just like the Koreans
[51:55.720 --> 52:00.840]  protected their areas when the police stood down in South Central LA during the riots.
[52:03.320 --> 52:10.040]  This has been set up where, well, it's bad to protect yourself. Bad to be able to protect
[52:10.040 --> 52:13.240]  yourself. England has done that where you can't fight back even if you're being physically
[52:13.240 --> 52:16.600]  assaulted. If they find out someone's beating you or mugging you and you fight back,
[52:17.800 --> 52:23.080]  the book is thrown at you. And I'm not joking. They don't even have free speech in England.
[52:23.080 --> 52:29.800]  Look at Michael Savage, critical of some radical Muslims banned from England from ever going there.
[52:31.960 --> 52:36.200]  Pretty amazing that that's going on. By the way, I have some news on that front here
[52:36.200 --> 52:41.080]  in my stack of news. But let me get into more of this news. This is out of the Financial Times of
[52:41.080 --> 52:47.240]  London. Scientists claim 72 is the new 30. They say human longevity has improved so rapidly with
[52:47.240 --> 52:53.800]  no proof over the past century that 72 is the new 30. People are now having shorter lifespans.
[52:53.800 --> 52:58.920]  And if you calculate out fetal death that is not as common today as it was 100 years ago,
[52:58.920 --> 53:04.200]  we really don't live as long. So just an absolute crap article, part of the propaganda while they're
[53:04.200 --> 53:08.120]  killing us, tell us that everybody's living longer. Now the elites that stay healthy and
[53:08.120 --> 53:13.720]  don't eat GMO and stuff, they are living longer. We could live to 150, and obviously some people
[53:14.600 --> 53:20.520]  will be doing that. Countering other propaganda, yes, Hitler and Stalin did take the guns.
[53:20.520 --> 53:24.680]  Debunking the meme that historical gun grabs by dictatorships is a myth. I've talked about this
[53:24.680 --> 53:29.960]  already a lot today because I want to get this article at Infowars.com with all the admissions
[53:29.960 --> 53:37.560]  and the Nazi laws out and the Soviet laws so that people know the media is lying when they say that
[53:37.560 --> 53:42.040]  authoritarians don't take the guns. They've taken the guns all over the world. I mean, of course,
[53:42.040 --> 53:46.280]  authoritarians take the guns. But it's like Gibbs saying he was told to deny there was a drone
[53:46.280 --> 53:50.440]  program even when the program was admitted and the media played along with it. Yeah, there's Mother
[53:50.440 --> 53:57.720]  Jones. Was Hitler really a fan of gun control? Conspiracy peddler Alex Jones said so. And I also
[53:57.720 --> 54:03.000]  peddled that there was a drone program even before it was declassified a decade ago. But I mean,
[54:03.000 --> 54:08.040]  under Obama, look, they attacked Drudge Report saying it's a lie. White House threatens executive
[54:08.040 --> 54:14.200]  orders on guns showing Hitler and Stalin. And the point with Drudge was that dictators do
[54:14.200 --> 54:19.480]  executive orders over their Congresses or parliaments, not about taking the guns even
[54:19.480 --> 54:23.560]  though they did. Stalin and Hitler did take the guns. Most of the guns already been taken by
[54:23.560 --> 54:29.880]  Lenin. But then it was five to ten years hard labor. It was death under Stalin. And they went
[54:29.880 --> 54:34.360]  on to say, Drudge is a liar. Stalin didn't take guns either. I mean, it was the death penalty.
[54:34.360 --> 54:41.000]  We have links to the Smithsonian, you name it, in the article. It is on record. Nuremberg trials.
[54:42.760 --> 54:46.760]  But in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act. Can you imagine
[54:46.760 --> 54:52.520]  the evilness of mfollwars.com and drudgereport.com that we would dare link Drudge Report to the
[54:52.520 --> 54:57.160]  horror, link to actual communists and Nazi propaganda posters about handing your guns in,
[54:57.160 --> 55:00.200]  and link to the Nuremberg trials and link to facts.
[55:02.680 --> 55:06.840]  I mean, just the extremism of pointing out that Stalin and Hitler took guns. I mean,
[55:06.840 --> 55:10.120]  everyone knows Stalin and Hitler brought fruit baskets to everybody.
[55:12.840 --> 55:19.240]  I mean, Stalin and Hitler, they sent people to luxury spas. Of course, they did, and the media
[55:19.240 --> 55:23.080]  will cut that out of context. I just can't handle it anymore. I mean, it's just getting,
[55:24.600 --> 55:28.520]  it's getting crazy. And when you look at the search, though, it's all the liberal media
[55:28.520 --> 55:32.360]  saying Hitler didn't take guns next to the Nazi sites saying I'm full of crap.
[55:34.760 --> 55:38.280]  I mean, I don't even know what to say at this point. I don't even know what to say at this
[55:38.280 --> 55:43.880]  point. I mean, it just gets, yeah, click on the one of people on TV. Go down lower. It's
[55:43.880 --> 55:47.480]  the next link where we talk about them controlling the meme. Yeah, go to the Google search. Let's
[55:47.480 --> 55:51.720]  see if it's changed since I looked at it a few days ago. Yeah, that's somebody's article about
[55:51.720 --> 55:55.480]  it. You can actually have it go to the Google search. I think that article you linked to does
[55:55.480 --> 56:03.240]  it. And the top one was a Nazi site and then CNN, Mother Jones, Salon, Daily Beast that were liars.
[56:03.240 --> 56:08.360]  Hitler was a cupcake who didn't take the guns. Actually, they didn't say he was a cupcake.
[56:08.360 --> 56:15.160]  The Nazis do. They said that he was a pro-gun guy. Well, yeah, in the SS and Gestapo's hands,
[56:15.160 --> 56:19.240]  I guess he was. Just like you guys want the government to have guns, but not us. So
[56:21.880 --> 56:26.200]  again, I stand absolutely reaffirmed as historical fact, you guys are like Hitler.
[56:28.040 --> 56:31.560]  Okay, let's continue here with some of the other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[56:32.520 --> 56:37.400]  There is quite a bit of it. I'm trying to find the stack of news I've got on censorship that's
[56:37.400 --> 56:44.440]  going on, but let's get to this. Let me give you the toll free number to join us. It's 800-259-9231,
[56:44.440 --> 56:54.040]  800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. Yeah, yeah, there it is. Gun control in Germany, natvan.com,
[56:55.320 --> 56:59.960]  the top Nazi site, the most intellectual Nazi site out there. I know because I've read it.
[56:59.960 --> 57:03.800]  They actually try to put forward arguments instead of just accusing everyone of the son of,
[57:03.800 --> 57:11.400]  you know, if you fall on a banana peel, the Jews did it. So they're the most newsy of the Nazi
[57:11.400 --> 57:16.920]  sites. Let's go back up. Yeah, you've got Nat Van saying Hitler didn't take guns. And then you've
[57:16.920 --> 57:23.240]  got Wikipedia saying he didn't take the guns. Total lies. And then you've got Poly Mike saying
[57:23.240 --> 57:29.400]  he didn't take the guns. Huffington Post saying he didn't take the guns. Salon, Hitler didn't
[57:29.400 --> 57:36.680]  take the guns. And a bunch of other liberal sites saying they didn't take the guns. I mean, it's
[57:36.680 --> 57:43.080]  just, is there no end to this? And then they go, well, the Germans that were members of the Nazi
[57:43.080 --> 57:50.680]  Party had guns. Well, yeah, yeah, Hitler took the guns from the groups he was gonna go after.
[57:50.680 --> 57:59.160]  Man, stop your lying. All it does is discredit you. That's all it does, scum. That's all it does.
[57:59.160 --> 58:07.080]  And I say most intellectual Nazi sites, most of them just Photoshop big noses on people.
[58:08.600 --> 58:15.160]  Or Photoshop you into somebody who you're not and say, here you are at a bar mitzvah. I mean,
[58:15.160 --> 58:21.400]  it's just like unbelievable seediness and deceptiveness. All right, continuing here,
[58:21.400 --> 58:28.280]  Assad pulls ahead in Syrian war. Document cam shot, please. Assad pulls ahead in Syrian war.
[58:28.280 --> 58:31.960]  That's under the Israeli intelligence group, Debco file. And that's what I've seen in the
[58:31.960 --> 58:36.440]  25 month conflict. Assad is not an angel, but compared to al-Qaeda is an angel,
[58:39.320 --> 58:43.880]  is defeating with the Iranian and Russian backers. Our government trying, our banker
[58:43.880 --> 58:48.440]  run government trying to put al-Qaeda in charge. But hey, the good news is for the globalist,
[58:49.240 --> 58:54.200]  they've been able to mass kill innocent Christians and Jews and blow up churches and synagogues.
[58:54.200 --> 59:00.280]  And while hobbyists have also targeted Muslim minority groups like Shiites and Alawites.
[59:00.280 --> 59:03.480]  And so it's just a pell mill slaughterhouse. I have another article here in my stack about
[59:03.480 --> 59:09.400]  Saudi Arabia is just arresting Christians in mass. They are the most accounting in the Middle East.
[59:09.400 --> 59:13.320]  And they're the dominant group that our government works with arresting Christians in mass.
[59:13.960 --> 59:18.040]  You know, if you work in Saudi Arabia and they catch you with two people at their house,
[59:18.040 --> 59:21.800]  praying to Jesus, you're arrested. I actually have that in my stack. I'll find it in a minute.
[59:21.800 --> 59:25.640]  And again, I'm not, you never heard the media bash the Saudi Arabian government.
[59:26.360 --> 59:28.840]  And that's who's backing the takeover of Libya and Syria.
[59:30.520 --> 59:35.400]  And the Saudi Arabian government is so racist, folks, their interpretation of the Quran is that
[59:35.400 --> 59:40.840]  black people, you can look this up, aren't humans. And they quote, call them raisin heads
[59:40.840 --> 59:44.200]  and say they're animals. And the Quran doesn't really say that, but it's one of those
[59:46.120 --> 59:49.400]  textbook interpretations by one of their leaders off of it.
[59:49.400 --> 59:52.840]  And the Shiites don't agree with that. They say, you know, you just, not anybody can just be one
[59:52.840 --> 59:56.440]  of the clerics. You've got to be related to, it doesn't matter. It's just, I've studied it all.
[59:56.440 --> 01:00:02.360]  It's a maze. But yeah, Saudi religious police arrest Ethiopian workers for practicing
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:08.040]  Christianity. Saudi Arabian notorious religious police known as the Matawa, I'm not pronouncing
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:12.520]  that right, swooped in on a private gathering, released 53 Ethiopian Christians this month,
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:17.080]  shutting down their private prayer and arresting the peaceful group of four people.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:21.880]  For merely practicing their faith, Fox News has learned the mixed group of men and women
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:27.720]  were seized in a private residence in the city of Dammam. And how dare you pray? That's just,
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:34.200]  sounds like Colorado and California zoning people. We know that three Christians or what was like
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:38.280]  five Jews were meeting in Colorado and Denver and they were like arresting them and stuff
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:42.200]  because of the zoning rule. And by the way, I saw an article where the atheists have gone
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.320]  to the UN to complain about how they're being persecuted. And they were like,
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.680]  UN to complain about how they're being persecuted because people don't agree with them.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:55.080]  It's the atheist that ran the communist. And you can read about millions of Christians being killed
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:00.680]  because they were Christian. And even if you renounced it, they'd blow your head off or work
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:08.840]  you to death in a slave camp. And again, I'm not saying all atheists are bad people. You can have
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:13.240]  what view you want, but I've run into so many where they always sign on to the eugenics and
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:18.360]  they sign on to the tyranny. And they tell me conspiracy theory is my religion. No,
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:23.080]  my religion is facts and being informed and not being an idiot, not being a sucker.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:29.320]  Get that through your pea brain. And all I know is atheists are saying there isn't anything bigger.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:34.120]  There isn't anything out there. We know everything, blah, blah, blah, or science is God.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:41.160]  Science is a religion of the eugenicist. And sure, the fake churches created false debates
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:45.800]  with science. A lot of them are even longer than the scientist, but real science shows
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:52.520]  the creation and the creator. I'm now digressing. We'll come back, take some calls. I got a bunch
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:58.920]  of other news. My son is going to pop in on the radio and TV because he heard the rebroadcast and
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:04.680]  saw the rebroadcast this morning. The rebroadcast is on a TV monitor in there to make sure we see
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.040]  the video streams going back out. So we have monitors all over the place to watch what's
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:14.840]  happening with our video traffic. And he watched it was rolling on the ground over. Mike Adams
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:19.560]  created this Obama bites, new vitamin. He created the big vitamin bottle.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:28.120]  And so my son came up with a 19, 19. Well, he went with 18 of them. CJ came up with number 19
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:32.760]  other Obama bites. So it's pretty funny. We're going to be fighting tyranny with satire
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:41.400]  straight ahead, your phone calls. There's a man going around taking names.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:53.800]  There's a man going around taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:03:05.320]  Everybody won't be treated all the same. There'll be a golden letter reaching down from the man.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:13.080]  When the man comes around, let's go to your phone calls. The gentleman quick here, Todd
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:20.360]  in New York. Let's talk about civil war and guns. Welcome, sir, to the airwaves, Todd.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.960]  How are you, Alex? Big shout out from the Western Catskills.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:27.720]  Good to have you here with us. Yeah. Yesterday you brought the question
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:35.000]  up to Dr. Ron Paul, and that was awesome. Yeah. I was wondering if the elitists are probably
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:41.080]  looking to have us actually engage in a civil war, you know, producing population reduction
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:48.600]  and more reason to come and take our confiscator. Well, yeah, if they can orchestrate a crisis or
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:53.800]  get one going and then come out on top, they'll do it. But if we're aware of them trying to start
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:58.680]  a civil war and we're exposing that they're the bad guys, they won't have the political capital
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:03.080]  to carry out. That's why we've got to demonize them with the things they've done.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:10.440]  They are demons. And so we demonize them. Yes, sir. Now, is there another possibility
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:15.000]  that this whole Second Amendment issue is a distraction from greater and more important
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  things? Well, I don't think it's a distraction, but it's like if your fortress is being attacked
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.400]  and the main assault comes at one wall and they're going to breach it, if you don't go stop them
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.240]  and then they have another army you don't know about that hits the other wall, what do you do?
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:31.880]  So, yeah, they're hitting us from all sides. And undoubtedly, while we battle this,
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.880]  they're still looting the daylights out of our treasury. They're still getting ready to launch
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:39.880]  more wars. They're still gutting everything else. You're absolutely right. It's just that if they
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:45.960]  can kill, it's the only culture we've got left. Guns unify people across racial lines. Guns,
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.160]  lower crime, 49% the last 20 years, the system hates them.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:55.320]  And the gun culture is the only thing, liberty wise, that's really been growing exponentially.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:01.400]  Some other stuff's been growing as well, but not as fast as tyranny. They can see the arc of the
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:06.840]  gun culture defeating them. So even though it hurts them, they still see they're gonna lose
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:12.040]  if they don't kill it. So I'm telling you, we gotta defend the Second Amendment. It's absolutely
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.920]  right up there at the top along with exposing abortion.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:21.160]  Indeed. Yeah, one of the things that I thought they might be distracting us from is,
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:27.480]  for example, Dr. Keshe, the gentleman from Iran who suggests that he has accomplished cold fusion.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.600]  Yeah, there's a lot of people say they've done that and there's been some proof of it, but
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:36.360]  they can never do it in large enough quantities of power and they can't make it feasible
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:39.720]  to actually power things. That's why I don't cover a lot of alternative energy,
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:45.320]  because so much of it is either an investment that won't go anywhere because there's no market grid,
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:50.040]  delivery system set up, no scalability, or because it's riddled with scams.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:56.440]  I mean, it's just a minefield. I appreciate your call. I mean, 100 times I've had people
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:00.760]  say, you've got to get this guy on invest. If everybody invest, he can buy them the energy
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:06.840]  units for power plants in your own backyard. The most feasible thing is solar power, even if you
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:12.280]  start only partially, that's not on the grid, that's at your house, and wind turbine at your
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:18.760]  house if you're in a windy area, and well water, and horticulture, and the type of stuff Mike
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:24.440]  Adams is working with. You have self-sufficient systems. The problem is you got to have money
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:30.840]  to do that. Let's go ahead and talk to Brendan in Wisconsin. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:38.360]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. You and JB were nice enough to post a couple of pieces that
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:43.080]  I had written in the past couple of months, and one was on the state of the union address.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:52.200]  And I sent him also a three-step process for combating the crisis reaction solution script
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:58.040]  that we know is coming. Well, tell us briefly, how do you combat the Hegelian dialectic?
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:06.360]  Awareness expansion, reaching out beyond just the AJS, Alex Jones Show listeners, cooperation,
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:14.760]  and that would mean public outreach, and derailing the mainstream media's assault on gun owners,
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:20.200]  and then preemption, and that's filming on the ground and get people ready to go if something
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:23.800]  happens in their neighborhood. No, I agree. I mean, the biggest thing is just waking up the
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:28.680]  tyrants have taken over and just get active, just getting active, getting used to doing YouTube
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:32.600]  videos, calling in to talk radio, getting your own local weekend show. It's easier to think.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:41.240]  Access TV, going to the State House, calling in to C-SPAN, saying no. When government tries
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:45.240]  to dominate you and act like you're a criminal, say, hey, I'm not a criminal. You're a servant.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:50.120]  And even if they beat you, then you sue them, then you defeat them. You've got to be willing
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:55.080]  to get past your fear and the cowing that we've come under. I mean, look at how people are scared
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:58.360]  of the police. People are scared of everything. Well, folks, if you act like a bunch of sheep,
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:03.640]  you're going to get gang raped by tyrants. We'll be back with more calls. My son in studio is from
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:11.240]  part two of the Obama bites. It's all coming up straight ahead. And then Michael Savage,
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:16.040]  he said it'll be with us 30 minutes to 40 minutes, depending on, he don't want to wear his voice out,
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.200]  but he said, you know, we'll play it by ear. So Michael Savage coming up,
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.160]  you don't want to miss any of this transmission, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:34.120]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:45.080]  All right. The health ranger, Mike Adams, was here yesterday. Thanks for joining us.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:50.760]  I'm Alex Jones and my son who will go unnamed at this time. We're not going to put him on TV. He's
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:55.800]  just here via radio. He came to work with me this morning as he does at least once a week and does
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:01.880]  his homeschool here at the office and works in media editing and research and studying history.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.200]  And again, we had on the TV screen in the green room where he was doing his schoolwork,
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:13.720]  the rebroadcast of yesterday with Mike Adams, who brought in the Obama bites. It looks like a big
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:21.880]  medicine bottle or vitamin bottle, and it's got a Feinstein in it. One a day keeps freedom away.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:29.240]  Obama bites, chewable multivitamin made in China. And it breaks down the fact that it'll help you
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:35.640]  be an absolute slave. And so my son just started rattling off a whole bunch of other ingredients
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:40.920]  that are going to be an Obama bites, Obama bites plus, and he even wrote it down here.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:44.840]  He's 10. I'm pretty proud of everybody says their kids are exceptional because you are exceptional.
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:49.240]  Humans are exceptional, but my son really is exceptional. But let me show viewers of
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:52.440]  this right here. He just wrote this up. He had this idea about an hour ago.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:10:00.840]  Obama bites a plus and we have polymers plus at Infowarshealth.com. And he came up with hopium
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:08.920]  plus mercury, lead, uranium and plutonium product of China. I like hostification extract.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.480]  That's actually, I said, hostification. And then CJ had the idea of the extract.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:21.000]  So let's start. Here's some of why you liked Mike Adams' little piece of dark satire so much,
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.520]  and then break down the 19 different things you come up with.
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:32.040]  I mean, it was like so funny and also so real. Like these are the things they want us to do.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:39.880]  And also, they're influencing it by television and stuff. Obey, obey, obey. This is correct.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.720]  This is right. I'm talking-
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.360]  Aspartame is good for you. Type 2 diabetes and cancer.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:52.840]  Mercury doesn't hurt you. It helps you. Let's see some more of these lists. Hopium gives you false
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:59.960]  hope about Obama and leads you into communism. Also, here's a good one. Tyranium allows you to
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.480]  accept tyrants easily. You came up with that. Good job.
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:09.640]  Let's add suckerism. Obeying the macho policeman.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.360]  Let's not skip to the end. What is this one you came up with? Deathy?
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:18.200]  Don't touch the microphone, honey. Okay, what's this one right here? What's that one you came
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.000]  up with? Deathium or what is that? What number?
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.440]  It's number three. How do you pronounce that? Deathium.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:27.800]  And what is that? The death panels? Yes, indeed.
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:33.320]  Well, it's for the Earth. It's for the- Of course, Obama loves you.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.880]  That's number five, sheepium. What's radium 3G?
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:46.920]  The 3G stands for three grams. And radium directly shipped from Fukushima allows you
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:51.160]  to be radiated easily. Okay, so Ann Coulter was involved in this
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.600]  formulation. Of course.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:56.760]  She says, so there's a little neocon influence. Good, good. I'm glad. Okay, let's move to
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:03.560]  sheepyism? Sheepism? Yeah, Obama wants us all to act like this,
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:08.600]  and his globalist masters do as well. Obama, Obama, Obama.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:13.160]  Now, you really liked this morning the thing about, don't touch the mic.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.320]  If you had headphones on, you'd hear that. Yes, sir.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.520]  It's all right, teaching you here. You're doing well, young Padawan.
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:24.280]  Now, listen, let's expand here on the new apprentice, younger and more powerful.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:29.560]  Now, listen, let's go to the next one here. Let's talk to, what's number six?
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:35.880]  Number six is called pettyism. Just dumbs down your basic human instincts.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:42.440]  So, care if somebody has a job with a hut toy, it must be racist. But if they're aborting
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.560]  52% of the black babies, that's not a problem. Yes, that's exactly-
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.480]  That's pettyism. Yes, of course.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:51.080]  Well, I mean, it's not bad to kill the babies, but the job is obviously racist.
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.000]  Of course. Okay, now what's number seven?
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.840]  Falseism. Yeah, what's that?
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:59.400]  Believing false things. So, that's actually the religion of Mr. Gibbs.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.640]  Like 9-11. Okay, what's number eight?
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:07.880]  Number eight is hypnoism, allows Obama's master hypnotist to take full effect.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:12.280]  Okay. Without it, it sort of degrades.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:18.920]  And what's daisyism, like being in a daze? That's more of the zombieism?
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:23.560]  Yes, it's a prototype of zombieism.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:27.480]  Okay, guys, I see number nine, zombieism. I skipped that.
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.160]  And what's that next one? Dystopianism.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:34.600]  You came up with a dystopic ingredient? Yes.
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.320]  But seeing a dystopic, that would be freedomism, but it would be a dystopianism.
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.080]  Yes, of course. Okay, good. You understand that?
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.560]  What's the next one? Number 12 is very important.
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.440]  Slavyism. Slavyism.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:51.000]  Now, what's that do? That's national service.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.520]  That's compulsory, but it's not compulsory. But it is compulsory?
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.480]  Yeah. But it's not compulsory?
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:14:00.360]  It's basically accepting all their lies and trash and things they put out there.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.520]  I mean, there is an admitted drone program, but there isn't.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.440]  Yeah. And you're a conspiracy theorist if you say there is.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.080]  Exactly, Dad. Good, well done.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:14.520]  Let's go ahead and go to the next one. We've got slavyism, fearlium. What's fearlium?
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:20.760]  It expands your sense of fear. So you're like, yes, sir, yes, sir. Well, of course,
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:28.200]  we'll let you stick your hands down our pants. Yes, sir, yes, sir. Also, it helps with the TSA.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.720]  Okay, so the pervert training. Yes.
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.840]  All right, now the next thing is bad man, bad man, stop, stop. Okay, and then we've got,
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:40.920]  what's floridium, or what is that? Yeah, it's an intense concentrate of fluoride.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:44.840]  You'll have to just directly kill people immediately. Phulium,
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:48.440]  obviously, after you've had the fluoride, you're- Minuses your IQ by 56.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:52.840]  Well, that'll make people happy because it does reduce that. Racism, what's that?
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:15:01.160]  Makes you very racist about all the other comments that really aren't racist. It makes you real
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:06.600]  racist about things that aren't racist because Obama says that it's racist.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.840]  It's racist if you don't bow down, okay. Yes, of course.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:15.240]  Well, that makes sense. Suckerism. Same thing as phulium.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.920]  So it's just fun to be an idiot. Yeah.
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:19.160]  It's good to be conned. Of course.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:24.040]  It's bad to say you're being conned. That's exactly what they want to sell you on.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:29.880]  That's basically one of the huge parts of their agenda, just make you a sucker.
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:35.640]  Okay, what's number 18? Liarism, allows you to cope with all their lies and think they're true.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:40.360]  Okay, so the crow rubs drinking that. Hoaxification.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:45.720]  Like 9-11, you believe this vitamin will influence your brain to think
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.320]  that terror threats and all sorts of, you know, like-
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:52.680]  Well, they're openly saying give us more tax money, let us bankrupt you,
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.440]  our terrorists will attack. Of course.
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:58.760]  The very terrorists they run publicly. Of course. Al-Qaeda, one of the people on
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:03.400]  the most wanted list was at the Pentagon a few years ago.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:07.880]  That's right. And we're all lucky. So good. Anyways.
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:14.440]  There's also, can you guys zoom in on the part that what you'll look like,
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.160]  it's the guy with the TV head. Yeah, yeah, let's see him.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.240]  Now, who is this guy? He looks like he took some Prozac.
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:28.360]  He's a Prozac, he's a Prozac taker. And also he should have, he's crazy.
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:33.720]  See how the circles around the eyes that represents hypnotic influence by Obama.
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:37.560]  Obama, our loving king. Yes, on this version, father?
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:41.640]  Yes, sir. I have lots of new drawings,
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:47.160]  like free brain washer. You can get a, get a government credit for a free brain washer?
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.880]  Yes, sir. That looks good.
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:54.520]  And then it says helps develop type 2 diabetes. I guess that's the aspartame.
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:59.720]  So sweetened with aspartame helps develop type 2 diabetes and cancer. And it says,
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:07.400]  Happyism. This is the copy I made that you wrote more on it. Happyism. What's all that?
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:10.600]  So here you read it. I can't read your writing. What's this over?
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:16.360]  This is exactly the opposite of the- So it's saying and no, like no peanut products.
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:18.520]  It says no freedom. No way.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:22.280]  No freedom, no life-ium, no Happyism, no destiny.
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.600]  And what's that- No American.
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.880]  Oh, no America, yeah. And not made in America.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:35.080]  That's exactly what they want. That's what their globalist plan is to enslave and defeat
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:41.400]  and destroy America. The globalists are offshore bankers. And they're just looting every country
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.040]  as they go, basically, politically. But Obama cares about us. That's why-
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.640]  Of course. That's why he paid $22 billion to ship General Motors to China.
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:54.440]  Oh, yeah. And Daddy, I just want to comment on the thing you did on Piers Morgan. I think
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:18:00.920]  that was absolutely boss. So awesome. This is unscripted, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.720]  All right. Thank you, Sean. Good job. And hey, good job to Mike Adams.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:14.360]  Oh, yeah. His report was very good about the globalists wanting to start a civil war and stuff.
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:19.640]  I enjoyed that very much. And by the way, I wasn't just watching in there today, the Reed
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.920]  broadcast. I was listening yesterday. Oh, you were?
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:26.280]  Uh-huh. That's how I knew. You told me you were watching it, too. You ran in?
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.840]  Yeah, of course. I ran in. I was looking in the green screen room.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:34.200]  So thanks for having me on, Dad. I want to get on some more, and I hope I can
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:38.040]  reveal my identity soon. All right. Well done. All right. Go on.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.000]  Bye, Dad. Love you.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:47.320]  All right. There you go. Man, I wish I had some more sons. My girls are great. I need to train
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:51.160]  them to be commandos against the globalists. The issue is he just is a natural. He just wants to
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:56.280]  do it. He's into it. He's read more history books than I guarantee 100 adults have. He's obsessed
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:59.160]  with it. Okay, let's go to phone calls, as promised, then back to the news. And then
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:04.120]  Michael Savage is joining us. Let's talk to Greg in Canada. Greg, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:06.440]  Hey, Alex. Can you hear me okay?
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:06.940]  Yes, sir.
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:12.860]  Yeah, it's Craig in Vancouver. I just wanted to follow up to your interview with David Ike,
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:18.940]  I guess, last week regarding the hack. I've been having this thought a lot lately,
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:25.820]  and the lie is the hack. It's the lie. And if I can go a little inception on you,
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:33.260]  I really feel that this Santa Claus thing is not as innocent as people make it out to be.
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:37.900]  Well, no, they teach you that like a secret guy comes down the chimney and gives you presents,
[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:42.300]  and you lie to your kids and implants kids with the idea that lies are real.
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:46.540]  And I mean, people could say it's fun. You know, it's fun at one level.
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.820]  But no, I think Santa Claus should be publicly executed.
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:55.580]  Well, and it's sarcastic. Sorry. It just spiderwebs into all these other facets.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:59.980]  And I really believe it. It's one of the pillars of a new world order.
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:05.580]  Psyop. It is a psyop because it has all the makings of it. We do it to ourselves.
[01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:10.060]  You have parents doing it to their own children. It's probably the first lie they ever tell their
[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:15.820]  children. Older kids, when they figure out the lie, the parents bring them into the fold to
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:22.700]  then perpetuate the lie on the younger kids. It just goes on and on. And I really think if people
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:26.940]  want to- No, no, no. I hear you, sir. I hear you. I got to put you on hold. We have CNN live in
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:30.940]  there. They just put it on screen. He's on another. You didn't build that. He just said,
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:37.740]  quote, you can't do things on your own. That's how our system works. You can't do things on your own.
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:45.100]  That's how our system works. So there he is preaching collectivism again. Unbelievable
[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:49.980]  that you can't be an individual. I mean, this is an all out Borg assault as they work as hard as
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:54.700]  they can to shut down our power plants, cut off our energy, shut down our factories while selling
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:58.700]  the image that they're helping the factories. That's the Communist News Network crap.
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:03.020]  You can't do things by yourself. That's how our system works. My God,
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:07.020]  the antithesis of our republic. You've got to cut it off, turn it off.
[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:16.060]  Really, I can't paint a painting myself? I can't, and then we individualistically build
[01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:21.420]  things to build a better society. We collaborate when we choose. And this is total communitarianism
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:24.780]  crap. Guys, I know you have that recorder. I'm going to play that when Michael Savage
[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:31.180]  comes on. I'm pretty upset right now. Because it's just meant to just get us completely used to it.
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.820]  I'm sorry, caller, go ahead and finish your point.
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:43.580]  Well, basically, I just think it's really insidious. I think what it is is when you're
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:47.820]  born, you talk about discernment, you talk about that knowing when something's not right,
[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:52.540]  knowing when something's not wrong. And I think what happens is every year at Christmas time,
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:57.180]  it's like a patch. It's like a Microsoft patch. It reprograms that.
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:03.740]  It tells you lies are okay, lies are fine. Yeah, and it's like the test patch. When kids
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:09.100]  know there's something confusing and it's not right, instead of the default, which is running.
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:13.580]  I remember being one of my earliest memories, two or three years old. I guess that was two,
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:18.540]  because my mother just finished a stocking and showed it to me that she still has it, she had.
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:21.660]  And I remember my dad going, no, no, Santa Claus comes down the chimney here. And it was a house
[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:26.940]  with a small house in Dallas. He was going to dental school. So they were poor somewhat.
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:32.140]  It was a little bitty thing in a small fireplace. And I said, well, he said, no, he comes down like
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:36.060]  in between the mortar here in the bricks. I remember my dad going, no, he comes down. I go,
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:39.580]  but he's fat. There was a fire going and he goes, and he would burn, dad.
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:45.100]  And he's like, okay, you're right, Santa Claus isn't real. But there was my dad carrying out
[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:50.140]  the ritual to tell me that a fat guy was gonna come down a chimney. And he still remembers me
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:55.500]  going, but dad and arguing with him. It's not that I'm even that smart. I just instinctively knew
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:59.420]  the way he was saying it too. Cuz when my dad would instruct me about things, I could tell,
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:02.220]  like don't stick your finger in that light socket, don't go in that street.
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:05.980]  I could tell the way he was saying it, it wasn't true. Go ahead.
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:12.620]  My mom used to say to me, well, if you believe, then it is. And you say that all the time on the
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:18.620]  radio with people, if you believe the New World Order- If you believe there's not cancer viruses
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:23.100]  in the shot, there's not. If you believe Obama's telling the truth, if you believe you didn't build
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:28.300]  it, I know, and you can't choose your reality. You can try to choose your destiny and build a
[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:32.780]  better world. You could choose to have a better attitude, but you can't, Alex, be positive about
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:37.340]  the world. Well, no, if it's not positive, if it's bad, a robber coming to kill me,
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:40.940]  that's not positive. What's positive is meeting it with force.
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:46.300]  So parents out there, you gotta stop lying to your kids. You gotta look them in the eyes,
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:51.260]  beg for their forgiveness because you've really been lying to them and setting them up for-
[01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:55.260]  and not all people are the same. I mean, it doesn't take hold in all people the same,
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:24:00.140]  but I really think it's an insidious seed that's planted in the minds of children at a very young
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:05.340]  age. You said the devil's chariot is pulled by good meaning, you know, Christians or whatever,
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:09.900]  like the, you know, he's in his sleigh with the 12 reindeer and it just goes on and on and on.
[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:15.180]  And anyway, I just wanted to- No, I hear you. I hear you, Craig. I totally agree with you.
[01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:19.420]  My mind is just reeling as they had the transcript on CNN just now. We're getting the audio
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:23.900]  of Obama saying, you can't do things on your own. That's how our system works. I mean,
[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:30.060]  it's just like total cult Jim Jones. You cannot leave the compound. We do nothing alone.
[01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:35.020]  You never have privacy. I mean, it's diametrically opposed to what makes humans great.
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:39.180]  And that's why I'm just done with collectivist. I'm done with their bleeding heart,
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:43.020]  how they try to trick you into accepting what they want. They want it for control.
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:49.180]  And now it's coming down to an end game. And small government builds great societies,
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:51.900]  not this big thing. And after they steal everything, they're gonna make the government
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:59.260]  small after they've stolen everything they will. But not before. Neo in New York,
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.260]  you're on the air. Cybersecurity, go ahead.
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:05.660]  Hey, Alex, man, how are you doing today? I'm doing all right, buddy.
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:14.700]  I wish I could say the same. I run a small online business. And I'm really,
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:19.260]  honestly really afraid of what that executive order that Obama signed is gonna do to my
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:23.100]  business. Well, the good news is nobody's gonna follow it. I mean, we've gotten to the point now
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:26.300]  where the public doesn't even know how to follow what they're told. It's so complex.
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:33.020]  So it is a total takeover, global taxes, global internet taxes, total tracking, internet IDs.
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:37.340]  They're trying to screw the web up. They know it's not gonna work. It's wreck healthcare,
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:43.100]  bring in total communism. It's wreck the internet, bring in a subscription-based system.
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:48.780]  That's what they say they're going to do. I'm not gonna comply to anything that these
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:53.340]  creeds say anymore. I'm not either. I'm telling you, time has come to just not do what they say.
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:26:00.540]  I spent a lot of money, a lot of my hard time on my site for these people to shut it down.
[01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:04.380]  I'm not gonna take it. I don't care if they sue me. I don't care if they arrest me.
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:08.940]  Well, they can't go after all of us. They need to get us to comply. And you know what? The big
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:13.660]  gun manufacturers are lining up to leave the states and cities where they're trying to take
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:18.860]  the guns. And now they're backing off. It's time to really hate these people and get aggressive
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:23.580]  with these rat scum pieces of filth. Stay with us. Michael Savage coming up.
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:42.140]  Yeah, Robert Gibbs says he's got oceanfront property on the moon.
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:51.660]  And I won't ever take you back. You believe that individuals didn't build this country.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:58.780]  You're an idiot. Oh, crank it up. I just can't turn down George Strait.
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:02.540]  I don't love you. Now you'll buy that.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:16.780]  I got some oceanfront property in Arizona. And from my front porch, you can see the sea.
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:28.300]  I got some oceanfront property in Arizona. If you'll buy that, I'll throw the golden gates in
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:34.060]  free. All you got to do is wake up from the big lie, rediscover common sense and history,
[01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:40.700]  not think of being informed as his work, but as being alive. And things will turn around very,
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:45.260]  very quickly. Michael Savage is coming up. Let me start the next hour. And I'm excited.
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:49.660]  His new book, he's had many New York Times bestsellers, a time for war,
[01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:56.300]  dealing with China. And well, the system is definitely trying to censor this book. And that's
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:00.620]  not an ad pitch. We're not even selling the book yet. We're going to do a deal with the publisher
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:07.980]  and sell it. We've been unable to hook that up yet. But I mean, I know I've tracked it and he
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:13.180]  is being blocked out. They're not even talking about it because Red Dawn. In fact, I forgot
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:17.500]  about this. When you guys pulled communist Chinese, ordered Red Dawn, re-edited it so I
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:22.140]  can actually source the article. But it's on record that happened. China owns our debt.
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:25.820]  It's not even really our debt. We've been maneuvered into this while propping up the banks
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:30.780]  with the tens of trillions. And then China buys the US treasuries. Now the Federal Reserve's the
[01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:38.380]  biggest buyer of those, but still net. China owns more. In fact, here's some of those financial news
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:45.340]  headlines for people out there. Why should taxpayers give big banks $83 billion a year
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:49.900]  Bloomberg? Well, Bloomberg, it sounds like Bloomberg's exposing things and Jamie Dimon.
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:56.220]  Folks, the big banks, the six Federal Reserve mega shareholders, they get $85 billion a month.
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:01.660]  $40 billion of that just to buy off toxic derivatives that were already written off and
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:07.340]  triaged. So see, you read this stuff. I mean, they're getting us at the open window with
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:12.700]  monetization. The original $878 billion or whatever, they just said that's a really big
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:17.580]  number. That was what they could get each time they went to the window and then act like,
[01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:21.900]  oh, we paid that back, but not all the rest. It's all just smoke and mirrors cuz they know
[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:27.500]  big numbers. Bloomberg talked about 83 billion. Folks, it's 85 billion in another program every
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:34.860]  month. Let's continue here. That's QE3. US oil imports from Middle East increase.
[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:41.260]  Financial Times of London. Well, they got regulations here making it hard to drill.
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:46.300]  Obama's paycheck exemption from sequester. Man, that guy's worth like $5 million off
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:51.100]  his stupid book. And you think it'd be like Rand Paul and like give his salary back or something,
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:59.260]  but not Obama. Just what a piece of garbage. Raising payroll taxes on the poorest Americans
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:04.060]  when he pledged not to. I mean, that is cold blooded, man. And they still love him. They just,
[01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:10.060]  oh, rape me, hurt me, oh, I love it. Why consumers may be on a crash course.
[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:16.220]  And it just goes into Walmart, CNBC, freaking out over the payroll increases is just absolutely
[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:21.660]  causing the consumer index deployment. Parents are robbing retirement for college. The big bubble
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:27.740]  is the colleges, folks. Most of those degrees, you're gonna end up working at a grocery store
[01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:34.940]  if you're lucky. Not so golden years, over 75, burdened by debt. Now you don't get to retire.
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:40.700]  They're like, don't worry, 73 is the new 30. But you don't live as long as getting you ready for
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:45.980]  debt slaves, the globalist. That's just some of it. Inflation increasing, yeah, no kidding,
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:49.980]  with all this quantitative easing. And I'm not trying to be negative here. Admitting,
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:53.340]  I mean, if I had my leg chopped off in a car wreck, I wouldn't go, I think I'll just bleed
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:56.940]  to death and just say I'm healthy. No, I'd be tying a tourniquet on there. We need a
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:31:07.740]  tight tourniquet on this leg right now, right now, right now.
[01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:15.020]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:32.060]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:35.740]  All right, Michael Savage is coming up in the next segment. This little five minute thing is
[01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:39.340]  kind of a no man's land because we don't do the news. So I wanted to get him on where everybody
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:43.180]  can hear him. But most people hear this segment. Let's go to some phone calls right now. Looking
[01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:47.260]  forward to Michael Savage. I actually get excited about that. It's hard to get me excited about
[01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:52.780]  stuff, but a very interesting individual. Robert in West Virginia on the gun grab,
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:57.580]  which is now official, a memorandum under the Justice Department says they want to ban all
[01:31:57.580 --> 01:32:01.980]  our guns. Yep, just more confirmation of these dirty crooks. Go ahead, Robert.
[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:10.140]  Yes, I'll have to hurry because I know you don't have much time. I represent a small group of
[01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:20.940]  intellectual patriots that have a think tank. We have been analyzing the gun grab and the political
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:28.140]  chess board for the last three months. And what we have is some dire news. What we see
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:34.780]  is just like when you fought an enemy, you used our greatest strengths as their weaknesses.
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:41.500]  The greatest strength of America is its guns. And so what we see is that intentional gun grab
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:49.020]  in which causes blood on the streets, in which small groups of patriot soldiers
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:56.220]  will take control of small areas, including parts of our nuclear stockpile, nuclear chemical
[01:32:56.220 --> 01:33:04.300]  biological. In doing so, our government will call martial law and China and Russia will call
[01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:11.820]  an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council and say that America has fallen and that in order
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:20.060]  to secure our world, we must go into the United States and secure the nuclear biological-
[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:25.820]  Wow, listen, I've played clips where they actually put this out in movies and things
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:32.140]  as a preconditioner. And you're absolutely right, in NLEO 9, 10, 11, 12 was classified.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:39.900]  They had troops from 15 nations on tabletop, drills, simulations on paper, their generals,
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:45.900]  invading America if rebels took over. And that's all exactly, you're absolutely right.
[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:51.900]  Push us into a civil war, have the patriots take over certain areas, West Point's training
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:57.100]  to retake areas from the quote, right wingers. That's all official, and then bring in the
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:01.660]  I-4 foreign troops. And I've talked to people from West Point, I've talked to top generals
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:05.660]  on and off air. And they say that's what is being trained for, but that's actually in
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:12.380]  the news. You're right, that is how crazy these people are. But you know what, I think
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:15.980]  that would fail as well if they tried to bring in Russians and Chinese. But that's what the
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:21.340]  NAFTA superhighways are for, all of it. And again, Russia is bad and corrupt, but it's
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:27.340]  not as allied with the globalist as China. I really see China as the main dog that the
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:31.100]  global bankers are using as their backup. And notice how the globalists have transferred
[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:33.820]  everything to China. They're putting all their eggs in that basket.
[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:43.740]  What we see is that what will happen is that a group will have control of one of our nuclear
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:50.060]  chemical stockpiles. And what will happen will be is that they'll announce that they
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:57.260]  will not allow foreign troops onto our soil. And either the patriot group will hit the
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:05.420]  invading army with a nuclear weapon, or it will be instigated by the federalists. Therefore,
[01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:13.980]  a limited nuclear strike would occur, and also hitting North Korea and Iran.
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:16.380]  And that's how America dies.
[01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:22.620]  Well, I know the globalists have been moving offshore and digging in. I tell you, I look
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:26.380]  at it all as crazy as it sounds. I think what you just said is very plausible. So what's
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:28.380]  your think tank, a bunch of retired military officers?
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:41.020]  My think tank is a bunch of Mensa rejects and Luciferian, people that denied entrance
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:46.060]  into the Luciferians because we refused to join because we were Christians.
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:49.020]  Oh, so you were a Mason then, okay.
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:54.140]  No, not a Mason, not a Mason. I just refused to accept the right of Lucifer.
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:59.580]  No, no, I hear you. Just wild, wild, wild, yeah. Very wild. All right, Michael Savage coming up.
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:09.980]  Behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:19.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have breaking news. We have the clip. It's coming up with Michael
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:25.660]  Savage. Obama's saying again, you don't do things alone in America. That's how our system works.
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:30.780]  You didn't build that. A new clip live on CNN 25 minutes ago. I was just telling Michael
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:34.540]  Savage about it during the break. He's like, you're kidding. He did it again. Yes, we're
[01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:39.420]  going to be playing that clip. But the reason I wanted to get Michael Savage on is a time for war.
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:45.420]  Michael Savage, many number one New York Times bestsellers, 30 something books, multiple
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:49.660]  doctorates. I'm not going to go over his whole bio. Most of you know who he is in the talk radio
[01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:55.340]  world where you're hiding under a rock somewhere. But he also writes for WorldNet Daily. They are
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:37:01.980]  censoring this. And this is a big subject I've talked about. You notice that Red Dawn was held
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:07.100]  up, Red Dawn 2, for two years as the Chinese government demanded and threatened Hollywood
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:12.540]  because it was Chinese as the bad guys attacking America that was re-edited and made to North
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:17.420]  Koreans, costing them millions of dollars to reshoot and re-edit. Now Michael Savage,
[01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:23.980]  breaking WorldNetDaily.com, China lobby censoring new book. We'll get this story
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:30.620]  linked up at Infowars.com as well. And this is not a ploy to sell books. Michael Savage,
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:37.020]  arguably the number two, number one talk show host in the country, doesn't usually do this because I
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:42.860]  listen to the show and have followed it to sell books. This is in a news blackout because across
[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:47.980]  the board, China owns our fraudulent debt. China has thousands of front companies. Al Gore's on
[01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:53.340]  the board of Apple with Foxcom and the suicide nets. They are the liberal tyrants and they are
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:59.100]  the new globalist muscle. Michael Savage joins us with this breaking news. And Michael, it is
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:05.500]  so exciting to get you on the broadcast. Well, it's always good to be on, especially someone
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:13.740]  who kicked the limeys behind on air. As you well know, you know what I think of the spineless side
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:20.220]  of the Brits. I was always an Anglo file until this thing came along where this slime, the
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:25.020]  socialist slime, slanted me and said, I said things I didn't say. And I'm the only American
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:31.260]  broadcaster, Alex, not allowed to enter Britain. I'm on a list with murderers and terrorists and
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:37.260]  nobody in the media, with the exception of Alex Jones right now, dares even talk about how is that
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:43.020]  possible? Why is my State Department not lobbying on my behalf? But let's not go into the England
[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:47.020]  thing. It's great to be on your show. It's great to have you here as long as we can keep you.
[01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:52.700]  I know you got your own show coming up tonight. Let's first plug that because you now are on
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:57.500]  cumulus and exploding across the country. Well, that's pretty good. Number one, they're the best
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:00.700]  company in the business and I'm not just saying it because I work with them. They are the best
[01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:04.940]  company in the business, number one. Number two, I'm on the best stations in the country.
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:10.700]  For example, Alex, I finally got on in New York City on WABC, 9 o'clock at night. Now,
[01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:16.060]  what happened? Michael Savage, who's he? I exploded within two months to number one amongst
[01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:21.100]  younger listeners, mainly males. I mean, women, as you well know, are not a big listenership
[01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:25.660]  in talk radio in general. I always joke I say I have eight women listeners across the country.
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:28.220]  Yeah, they're busy not having kids as the whole west dies.
[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:32.220]  Well, the men listen, but here's the question, Alex, because you have a younger demo and guys
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:37.980]  mainly. Why are they listening to you? Why did they find Michael Savage, an older guy on WABC,
[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:41.100]  I beat other talk stations, I beat all new stations, I beat the-
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:46.860]  Because young people are looking for men role models in the age of crucifying John Wayne.
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:51.420]  They understand they're having their testicles chopped off and they wanna fight back and have
[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:57.660]  a future. Well, first they have their testicles cut off chemically. They're chemicalized to destroy
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:03.100]  their masculinity. And if they survive the chemical castration, the next thing is the
[01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:08.300]  educational castration. If they survive the chemical and educational castration,
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:11.180]  I mean, what's left for them? They don't know which way to turn in this country.
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:17.180]  You know, Alex, last week I started my show by saying I saw a kung fu movie when I was out on
[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:21.100]  vacation last week. I was watching a lot of television. And there was a picture of a kung
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:26.860]  fu academy in China with thousands of young Chinese being taught by a really tough mean
[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:31.180]  kung fu teacher. And he's saying to them, no weakness, no pain, no mercy.
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:36.540]  And he says, what do we learn here? And the Chinese scream back in Chinese, no weakness,
[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:43.740]  no pain, no mercy. And I say, look at my sad sack country. We have a government and an educational
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:49.740]  establishment teaching our children to say, I'm weak, I'm in pain, this hurts, that hurts.
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:54.780]  I need the government to help me. Now, who wins this battle in the long run, Alex,
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:57.260]  that doesn't take a genius to figure out what's happening, does it?
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:00.460]  No. Okay, so that's where we're at.
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:06.300]  So now we know that China has lobbied very effectively in Hollywood. The Hollywood sewer
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:12.940]  pipe, as I've called it affectionately for 20 years now, the Hollywood sewer pipe is controlled
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:17.580]  by many different factors. But the number one factor is money. Since China controls the money
[01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:22.140]  flow to the banks and the banks control Hollywood, we don't have to figure out who controls Hollywood,
[01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:27.420]  do we? So my agent said to me when I told him my book is being sabotaged from the top,
[01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:33.340]  and I'll explain it in a minute. My agent called me and he said this, and I'm quoting Alex,
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:37.980]  this is a top New York literary agent. He said, from the government to mainstream media,
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:42.540]  no, that's him, but here. He said, from the government to mainstream media,
[01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:46.700]  there is a petrifying fear of China and the potential loss of their hypothetical business.
[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:49.980]  The agent said to Savage, he was reminded of a conversation he had with the top Hollywood
[01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:55.020]  executive who said to him, they wouldn't produce any films that were anti-China for fear of being
[01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:59.180]  blackballed in their market, basically letting the Chinese government censor our movies in
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:04.060]  this country. Then he said to me, Savage, there must be a way to galvanize conservative media
[01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:08.780]  behind the time for war as the only book willing to take on China, the agent told Savage.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:15.500]  Well, guess what, Alex, aside from you, nobody will discuss this book and its premise.
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:20.620]  Well, let's break down what they're censoring here, but to tie in,
[01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:25.740]  Obama's shutting down dozens of power plants a week. They're not letting new plants open.
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:30.460]  They're totally clean coal power plants, about 51% of our power. And we're getting ready for
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:34.780]  that clip, guys, get ready. This is brand new, this just happened at the end of the last hour.
[01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:40.780]  Obama is in Newport, Virginia, at one of the shipyards talking about getting America going.
[01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:44.620]  And I saw this on CNN during the break earlier, I couldn't believe it.
[01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:48.620]  On screen, it says that Obama, you can't do things by yourself,
[01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:54.140]  that's how our system works, that's a quote. Michael, what do you say to that quote?
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:58.700]  Well, I would disagree with him because the sex therapists across America are going into
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:03.740]  our churches and teaching people how to pleasure themselves without anyone present. So
[01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:07.820]  on the face of it, Obama's wrong. Well, it's real and it just happened,
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:11.740]  it's incredible to see him doing this. Now, let's get into your book here that they're
[01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:15.020]  trying to censor, the premise of the book that I'm holding in my hand,
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:20.620]  A Time for War with Michael Savage. Well, the premise is quite simple, which is that,
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:28.300]  okay, it starts with a helicopter in Afghanistan, a Chinook, carrying a squad of Navy SEALs
[01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:33.020]  plummeting to the earth in Afghanistan. Remember when that happened in 11, when our
[01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:38.220]  great commander in chief was never blamed for the loss of more Navy SEALs in one incident
[01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:43.580]  than in the entire history of the SEALs unit? How come there's never been an investigation
[01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:49.100]  of who put all those Navy SEALs in a single old flying helicopter and flew them into a hot zone?
[01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:53.340]  Who did that? Who in the military made that decision? Or worse yet, was it a decision
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:57.020]  made by someone other than in the military? Why has there been no Republican outcry?
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:44:01.900]  That's how my book begins. But the question is, what happens next? Well, I fictionalized
[01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:06.460]  that story in order to make America wake up to the fact that maybe,
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:12.460]  just maybe someone will ask, who killed all our Navy SEALs? And number two, my allegation,
[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:17.100]  meaning through my fiction, it's a novel, A Time for War, is that there's a Chinese agent
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:23.820]  in Afghanistan who brings it down with an EMP attack. And the whole book is basically about
[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:32.140]  a lethal conspiracy to not only neutralize our military, but also a two-pronged attack that will
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:38.060]  disarm the American military through EMP blasts, and then release a deadly toxin, killing hundreds
[01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:44.460]  of thousands of civilians. And my hero, Jack Hatfield, and Dover, a young lady, raced to
[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:48.300]  locate this new ground zero and save an unsuspecting country. That's the theme
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:51.900]  of A Time for War in my novel. It's a novel, it's a novel, that's what it is.
[01:44:54.620 --> 01:45:00.780]  So Alex, the question is, where do I come up with the theory that I am being manipulated?
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:04.380]  Or the sale of- But they're doing it all over the place. I mean, the government's owned by China
[01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:10.300]  now. The globalists signed us on to communism and used NAFTA and GATT and all these rules
[01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:14.860]  to shut down our industry so only China could thrive. They got their population jumping off
[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:19.740]  suicide nets. I mean, this is how they brought America down. Yeah, but let me answer the
[01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:23.900]  question. People are gonna say Savage still didn't answer the fact that he's making a great
[01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:28.380]  charge here, that the China lobby is censoring his new book. Where is the proof, right?
[01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:32.140]  Well, let me give you one piece of evidence, because I'm trained as a scientist,
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:36.700]  and the only proof is a series of evidence, evidentiary facts. It's like a court of law,
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:41.500]  right? We can't definitively show you a video of Chinese agents sitting and talking and saying,
[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:46.060]  kill the book. I can show you facts and let people draw the conclusions for themselves.
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:49.340]  When this book first came out, there was an ad campaign that was leading with,
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:54.780]  is China already at war with the US, okay? That was the lead line, is China already at
[01:45:54.780 --> 01:46:01.660]  war with the US. By the time the book appeared, that ad line was dropped and it became a book
[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:08.060]  about terrorism, generic, okay? A generic book about terrorism. Secondly, we had an ad campaign
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:12.540]  planned for the day of launch, which was last week on a Tuesday. It was supposed to be on the top of
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:17.820]  some major websites, I will not mention which. I woke up early in the morning looking forward
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:22.060]  to seeing the ads, they didn't appear. I was screaming and yelling all day long.
[01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:28.220]  Finally, a word came back that it was bumped because of this, it was bumped because of that,
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:32.860]  it was a mistake. And the ads that were made meant to run was suddenly running on Sunday morning
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:36.220]  and on Sunday midnight. They were never appearing where they were supposed to appear.
[01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:41.660]  It didn't happen by accident, Alex. Money was paid, contracts were signed. This was shafted
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:46.620]  from the top down. Can I prove it? No, but I can offer some evidence. And the publisher is owned
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:51.740]  by a German holding company, by the way, without smearing the publisher for obvious reasons.
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:56.380]  There's hardly an American publisher left that isn't owned by an international publisher. This
[01:46:56.380 --> 01:46:59.980]  one is owned by the biggest publishing group in the world, which happens to be headquartered in
[01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:04.380]  Germany. We all well know that the Germans are interested in penetrating the Chinese market,
[01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:10.220]  is that correct? Absolutely. Well, I mean, as the CFR has said, in the New World Order,
[01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:15.420]  everything's being positioned to China to leverage everybody out of the lowest common denominator
[01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:20.940]  to bring in this system. Well, the one good news about it all is I've always liked Chinese food,
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:25.820]  so maybe I can look forward to that. But the thing is, that wouldn't be the bad,
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:29.500]  that would be the only good news of the whole thing, is it's not a bad cuisine if you don't
[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:34.140]  get low salt, low fat Chinese food, which is impossible to find in San Francisco.
[01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:40.380]  Is this sinophobia, Alex? Because we're going to be accused. Look, you're a renegade broadcaster.
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:44.460]  I'm somewhat of a renegade broadcaster. You know that. We're sort of outcasts and we love it
[01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:48.620]  because that's what we are. We don't want to be one of these old men sitting on the boardwalk
[01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:52.860]  with our pants legs rolled up complaining like Bill Plante did yesterday from CBS.
[01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:56.780]  Did you hear that sound clip? You got to hear this one. Bill Plante complains to his friend
[01:47:56.780 --> 01:48:04.780]  Howie Kites of the major media. Howie Kites and Bill Plante. And Bill says this. He says,
[01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:08.540]  we've gotten used to being called whiny lap dogs. I've heard it for 30 years.
[01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:13.100]  But he said, this is about access to the president. And access to the president has been cut
[01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:17.980]  and pushed and curtailed over every administration I've covered. But here's the nub of it, Howie.
[01:48:17.980 --> 01:48:23.180]  This administration has the tools to reach people on their own now. They don't need us that much.
[01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:27.260]  And to the extent that they're able to do that, Howie, they're undercutting the First Amendment,
[01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:30.860]  which guarantees a free press through many voices. Isn't that hilarious?
[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:36.220]  That's right. These idiots sold out, repeated and regurgitated what the establishment said,
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:39.100]  and now they're being totally cut off and they're complaining.
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:43.020]  Yeah, a free press through many voices, as long as they're all liberal voices.
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:47.180]  Certainly, you've never been on the free press. I've never been heard from by the free press.
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:50.220]  We don't exist, Alex. Our large audiences don't exist.
[01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:53.660]  That's right. They're the ultimate censors, legends in their own mind,
[01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:57.580]  who sit up there on a mountain telling us what exists and doesn't exist.
[01:48:57.580 --> 01:49:01.180]  Did you see Gibbs, regardless of where you stand on the drone program,
[01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:05.340]  saying he was told to say the program didn't exist like the Wizard of Oz,
[01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:07.980]  even when the program was public? Did you see that?
[01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:13.740]  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Gibbs. I happen to like drones. I know you and I disagree on this.
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:17.740]  I'd rather see a drone go and kill a real terrorist than sending an American
[01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:19.900]  platoon over there to do it. No, no, no. I'm talking about them
[01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:23.180]  being domestically used against us. Well, of course, we're against drones in America.
[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:28.620]  The only drone I would approve of would be a drone manned by a government official,
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:33.020]  a manned drone, not a V2 rocket. Remember, Hitler used the first drones. They were called V1s and
[01:49:33.020 --> 01:49:37.740]  V2s. Remember the unmanned rockets that he sent on England? What, now our own government is using
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:42.860]  V1s against us? Absolutely. And in fact, Michael Savage here with us, the crew's doing a great job
[01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:48.700]  trying to capture stuff live off TV. We do, drum roll, please, have the clip of Obama at
[01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:54.620]  a shipbuilding factory in Virginia just about 30 minutes ago. He said this. This is breaking.
[01:49:54.620 --> 01:49:58.620]  You didn't build it statement number two from CNN. Here it is.
[01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:04.460]  But in order for us to make that happen, I'm going to need you.
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:10.700]  You know, the one thing about being president is after four years, you get pretty humble.
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:14.540]  You think maybe you wouldn't, but actually you become more humble. You realize what you don't
[01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:20.060]  know. You realize, you know, all the mistakes you make. But you also realize you can't do things by
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:25.020]  yourself. That's not how our system works. You've got to have the help and the goodwill
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:31.660]  of Congress. And what that means is you've got to make sure that constituents of members of
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:36.300]  Congress are putting some pressure on. So again, that's a backhanded way. He's saying,
[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:40.780]  oh, I can't be a dictator. But what he's really saying in the factory is you can't do things by
[01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:45.580]  yourself. Well, I think what he's saying is I need you to run to Congress and make them cave
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:50.140]  in and make sure I can give increases in taxes again, is what he's really saying. Of course,
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:54.460]  he doesn't believe anyone does anything without the government's help. This is how statists think.
[01:50:55.020 --> 01:51:00.220]  This is how statists have been brainwashed from childhood to believe that, for example,
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:04.940]  Picasso didn't paint this painting by himself. He'd argue that he had to go buy the paints,
[01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:09.340]  he had to buy the paintbrush, he had to buy the easel, and he had to rent the model.
[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:15.020]  But other individuals contributed to make a better choice and more variance in society.
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:18.780]  The idea of collectivism, all it creates is nightmares.
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:22.700]  Well, we understand that. But Alex, listen to how they think. You know as well as I do
[01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:27.340]  how they think. Why do you think that in the Soviet Union of the past and in China today,
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:31.900]  there is no individual art? The art has to be state-approved art, is that correct?
[01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:36.540]  How different is that than state-approved art in America today, where there are very few creative
[01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:41.100]  artists who are ever seen, unless they're working through the National Endowment for the Humanities,
[01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:45.980]  National Endowments for the Arts, or they're in a university tenured position? You don't see or
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:52.620]  hear from them because they're not state-sponsored. We are becoming increasingly like a Soviet state.
[01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:58.380]  We understand that, Alex, and we're fighting against it. The question to you, Alex, is people
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:04.700]  are screaming, what the heck can I do about it? I've tried. Look what they gave us in the last
[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:10.380]  election, a choice between Mr. Milk Toast and the communists, the naked Marxist. Then the naked
[01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:15.820]  Marxist Obama floods America with illegal aliens three months before the election by granting
[01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:20.780]  amnesty to the, quote, Dream Act. Without congressional approval, there wasn't a peep,
[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:25.420]  a peep out of the drunks called Republicans. Well, Michael, that was my next point, is that
[01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:31.340]  isn't it time for impeachment? It was a long time ago. He says our military's under NATO control.
[01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:39.820]  He goes on to say that he can have cybersecurity shut down a free speech if Congress doesn't act.
[01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:45.100]  He says now he can legalize the illegal aliens by fiat. Well, you and I can't go to Mexico
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:50.780]  and have babies for free and everything paid for. They're taking American hospitality and using it
[01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:56.380]  and using it to literally bankrupt this country. And isn't that their goal, is to bankrupt things,
[01:52:56.380 --> 01:53:01.100]  to collectivize it? I'm not sure that they wanna bankrupt the country. I think they just simply
[01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:06.140]  are into controlling it. And remember, Alex, my analogy is different than yours. There was a TV
[01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:10.060]  show called The Sopranos. You probably don't watch much TV. No, I've seen it, yeah, the mobsters.
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:15.180]  So it's when the mobsters from New Jersey, they run a private gambling den, right? They get a guy
[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:18.940]  and it was a friend of theirs, by the way, who owns a huge sporting goods store. And they tell
[01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:23.100]  him, don't gamble, you're a sick degenerate gambler. He gambles anyway, he loses all of his
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:27.820]  money. So the mafia gets their hands into his sporting goods store, right? Now the next scene
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:31.980]  is they already move into the store, they get in the back room, and they're taking stuff out of the
[01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:37.100]  back door. They now own the guy. Not only they busting out the store by selling things in the
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:43.260]  back out of trucks, now they're taking a line of credit, Alex, that the store has, and they're
[01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:47.820]  running up first class airline tickets to the tune of millions of dollars. What does that sound like
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:51.980]  to you? It sounds like we've been taken over by the same gang that took over the sporting goods
[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:55.900]  store. And they're busting us out by running up our credit, taking our credit line. No,
[01:53:55.900 --> 01:54:01.100]  I totally agree with you. That's my analysis exactly. It's like a gang took over America.
[01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:05.340]  How dumb do you have to be not to see it? No, it's government anarchy, as you call it.
[01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:09.580]  It is government anarchy, and that's a phrase I was using. But people don't understand what
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:14.620]  I say, Alex. Maybe some do, have a big audience. Hey, let me bring this up. Why do all of the
[01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:19.900]  major conservative libertarian hosts talk crap about each other or start fights? I don't do that.
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:24.860]  But when I'm listening to talk radio, they're constantly sniping at you and then acting like
[01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:31.180]  you're sniping at them when they're starting it. And then I've got Mr. Beck behind the scenes,
[01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:35.340]  always trying to make stuff up. Don't they get there's gonna be no country in the future?
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:40.700]  Alex, here's the answer. When you delete sled dog, the other dogs are barking at your ass.
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:44.780]  I guess that's true, yeah. I mean, did I use a word I'm not allowed to use?
[01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:48.300]  No, no, you're right. I guess that's- I mean, when you delete sled dog and they're tied behind
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:58.700]  you pulling a load, they're mad at your behind. Oh, man, Michael Savage is our guest. I've got
[01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:02.700]  a bunch of questions for you. And we're gonna come back from break if we can keep you cuz I've
[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:07.340]  gotta get into how you think we get America back, where you think the future is going,
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:11.420]  what's going on with the Republican Party. But again, I've never heard you come out and
[01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:15.980]  talk about a book being censored like this. And I've seen China do this publicly,
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:20.780]  saying they couldn't put out Red Dawn. And there should have been a congressional investigation
[01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:24.460]  when they didn't put out Red Dawn for two years to re-edit it.
[01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:28.540]  And the communists didn't even pay to have it re-edited. I mean, since when did our country
[01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:33.020]  let the communist Chinese that kill their political dissidents and sell their organs
[01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:38.380]  dictate books and films? I don't think it's a theory. There is a news blackout on your book.
[01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:44.300]  You know, if you go to any major bookstore, Barnes & Noble, I went into a local one yesterday.
[01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:48.700]  The book is prominently displayed because the publisher buys that, you know how books work.
[01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:49.420]  In cap, yeah.
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:54.300]  Yeah, they're right up there. They're beautiful, but no one knows the book is there. They're not
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:59.740]  going into, I need a revolution of my listeners to go in and just buy the book. It's that simple.
[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:03.260]  You say, well, you just want to get rich. I hope people believe me,
[01:56:03.260 --> 01:56:07.980]  it won't change my lifestyle. One iota. I need people to ask a question. Who in the
[01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:12.380]  US military put all those seals on a Chinook helicopter that got shot down in Afghanistan?
[01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:16.540]  Stand there. Why did they kill the seals? I agree. Oh yeah, we're coming. I think that was
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:21.500]  on my list of questions. You didn't even know it. Zero Dark Easter Bunny. We're going to talk
[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:24.460]  about it all with Michael Savage, michaelsavage.com.
[01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:41.740]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:50.460]  Well, folks, I got to be honest with you. I'm a talk radio listener
[01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:55.260]  and I really can't listen to any of the big national host. I've said this before.
[01:56:56.060 --> 01:56:59.180]  And you know, I don't talk trash about other hosts other than people that attack me behind
[01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:05.260]  the scenes, empty suits as some people call them. But I like Michael Savage, even though
[01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:08.620]  I've disagreed with some of his views and some of the things he said tongue in cheek about
[01:57:08.620 --> 01:57:12.460]  put the liberals in forced labor camps. Now I get the point. He was saying they want to put
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:16.700]  us in forced labor camps, but I just really like Michael Savage.
[01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:22.300]  Alex, listen to me. I'll say it again. You better put them in a camp before they put you in one,
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:26.460]  as George Orwell wrote in the 1930s when he saw what the communists were going to do.
[01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:30.540]  If a man comes to put a bomb in your mother's house, put a bomb in his mother's house first.
[01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:34.300]  They, if they could, would put you and I in a concentration camp.
[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:37.980]  No, no, they called for our arrest all the time. I mean, they called for ending free speech. They
[01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:45.420]  love it. Yeah. And look at this, the same bastards who try to push through the fairness doctrine
[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:50.380]  to put me out of business. They're the same sons of bitches who are right now doing everything
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:54.620]  against the American no way. Everything imaginable, whether it's seizing guns,
[01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:58.220]  seizing speech, seizing property, or pandering to the enemy.
[01:57:58.220 --> 01:58:02.780]  It's the same SOBs all over again. That's why they want us silenced.
[01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:10.940]  You know, it really is true. And I'm sure you've seen the Bill Ayer's witnesses from the trial,
[01:58:10.940 --> 01:58:14.540]  the FBI informants. It was later confirmed in the trial of the weatherman. They were talking
[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:20.220]  about putting 50 million conservatives in forced labor camps and licking their lips talking about
[01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:23.980]  beating us and killing us and shooting us. And then they had a White House petition
[01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:28.540]  countering my Piers Morgan petition a few months ago saying, let's have federal militias
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:34.220]  to go confiscate the guns. They dream of some red terror linen takeover.
[01:58:34.220 --> 01:58:40.220]  I mean, these people really are nuts. Well, on Sunday, their good friend,
[01:58:40.220 --> 01:58:46.300]  Louis Farrakhan gave a speech to 10,000 Nation of Islam followers where he appealed to gang bangers.
[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:50.780]  You should get that soundbite where he said to them, you guys know how to use guns. All the
[01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:56.140]  guns you own are illegal, meaning they can't be seized. And he said, we wanna teach you the arts
[01:58:56.140 --> 01:59:02.140]  of war because although one of our own, he said, is running the country, he's not helping us.
[01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:06.380]  We have to help ourselves. What was he saying? What was he saying?
[01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:10.620]  No, no, I saw the clip. In fact, we played the clip. And by the way, is the Nation of Islam the
[01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:14.940]  secret private militia that Obama hinted at before he was elected in 2008?
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:21.180]  There's the headline, Farrakhan recruits Chicago gangs for protection. Well, look at the new FEMA
[01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:27.660]  Corps now launching people. I wanna get into the martial law civil war scenario with Michael Savage
[01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:31.580]  of the Savage Nation, one of the top talk shows in the country, best selling author.
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:35.420]  New book, A Time for War. Michael Savage joins us right now. But first,
[01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:41.980]  let's go back to the bin Laden raid, very questionable. One helicopter crashes,
[01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:47.260]  they dump the body in the ocean, along with the Keebler elves, and then they pack 23 seals
[01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:51.180]  on a helicopter. I actually talked to a seal who has a buddy, one of the few survivors of
[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:54.700]  Seal Team 6, who says that they believe the helicopter was blown up.
[01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:56.380]  Michael Savage, where were you going with that?
[01:59:57.340 --> 02:00:02.380]  I think they were sacrificed by the Obama administration, at least someone in the
[02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:09.420]  administration, gave a little gift back to the enemies of America, and said, okay,
[02:00:09.420 --> 02:00:14.780]  we took out Osama bin Laden, you can have all 23 Navy SEALs.
[02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:16.860]  They're right, it was 30 total, it was some army guys too.
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:19.740]  Yeah, there were Rangers, and then there was some Afghan Special Forces,
[02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:23.580]  I think it was 23 SEALs. Yeah, 23 SEALs, and I think 34 total, but go ahead.
[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:28.380]  I was screaming on my show, who made the decision to put them in a Chinook helicopter? Alex,
[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:30.860]  you know that the Chinook is a Vietnam era helicopter.
[02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:33.740]  They're a death trap, the SEALs said they're never put on those.
[02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:40.300]  Okay, in fact, the bin Laden raid was conducted with three advanced attack helicopters.
[02:00:40.860 --> 02:00:42.780]  Stealth. Yeah, why were these guys
[02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:48.540]  put into one old flying helicopter that was allegedly shot down with an RPG? I allege it
[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:54.380]  was shot down with a blast, an EMP blast, in the novel A Time for War. How can I prove it? I can't.
[02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:58.860]  I'm only a fiction writer after all, Alex, I have no inside information. But the question is,
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:03.660]  why was this never investigated? This was the single greatest loss of Navy SEALs in
[02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:09.900]  American history. And Obama runs around, I'm a Commander-in-Chief, I killed Osama bin Laden.
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:14.300]  And that schmuck, whatever his name was, who we forgot already, Romney.
[02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:19.580]  How many times did I say on my show, Romney, get up during the debate and say to him,
[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:24.140]  okay, sir, you should take credit for killing Osama bin Laden. But do you also
[02:01:24.140 --> 02:01:28.380]  want to take credit for killing 23 Navy SEALs? Who in your administration did that?
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:31.900]  He could have sank his presidency during the campaign, couldn't he, Alex?
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:37.660]  You're absolutely right. Now, getting into the domestic operations, you have 2 billion rounds
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:44.460]  of ammos now, not 1.6 billion. You have drones for domestic operations, the new DHS-funded drone,
[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:52.220]  $400,000 apiece. They're now putting out training videos showing the drone targeting what looks like
[02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:59.980]  redneck cracker gun owners, to use one of their pejorative terms. You've got all these domestic
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:04.780]  checkpoints popping up. You've got the DHS training manuals that we got, saying veterans
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:08.860]  and gun owners are the new homeland security threat. You've got Obama turning al-Qaeda loose
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:13.980]  in Libya and Syria. I mean, this is a full flipping of homeland security onto the American
[02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:19.180]  people. Are they trying to set up a civil war, Michael Savage? How do I know what they really
[02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:22.380]  want to do? It almost doesn't matter whether they're trying to do it because they're really
[02:02:22.380 --> 02:02:27.740]  moving people against each other, aren't they? I have never seen a more divisive presidency in
[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:33.020]  my life. I've never seen a president who basically antagonizes, should I lay it on the line,
[02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:38.940]  the older white males on a daily basis. He literally relishes making all the white males
[02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:45.580]  angry. He prays they will do something crazy to justify a reaction by the psychotic fascists in
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:49.980]  the government to make it very clear. Okay, I don't know how else to put it. He's trying to
[02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:54.780]  provoke a war in this country. Whether it will happen is only a matter of whether someone goes
[02:02:54.780 --> 02:03:02.460]  off or not. But what is their end game? I mean- It's obvious. It's obvious, government control.
[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:08.860]  Government control. We understand he's not a savior. We understand he's a demagogue,
[02:03:08.860 --> 02:03:15.340]  and he's not a right wing demagogue. He's a national socialist demagogue. Everyone forgets
[02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:21.660]  that a certain Austrian who lived in Germany in the 1930s was a socialist. He hated capitalism.
[02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:27.260]  Do you know that, Alex? He wanted centralized crony control and used selective socialism to
[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:31.100]  transfer wealth, which you always see with the crony grips. What about Dorner? Yeah,
[02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:35.180]  the whole system was paralyzed for a week over one guy. How do they think they're gonna start
[02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:42.300]  a civil war? By the way, he was a pro-gun guy who then, I mean, an anti-gun guy who was then
[02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:48.140]  out there using guns to reportedly shoot police. That was a crazy case, and what the media did,
[02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:53.500]  the vermin in the media, and I'll say it until people hear me. Okay, I won't use the word that's
[02:03:53.500 --> 02:03:58.380]  so charged, the cilantroates in the media, the worms in the media, the worms in the media.
[02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:05.180]  How's that? The worms in the media refused to report that that mad crazed cop Dorner,
[02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:11.580]  who was killing people, his first two victims were a couple, a young woman who was a Chinese
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:16.860]  African-American descent and her fiance who was African-American. They wouldn't show their
[02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:21.980]  picture, Alex. We had a search for it and put it up on michaelsavage.com. Why did the media not
[02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:27.260]  show that Dorner's first victims were a black man and a Chinese black woman? Because then it
[02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:31.580]  wouldn't have fit their agenda. They wanted to make it about racial division. That's right.
[02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:38.540]  The rats, the cilantroates, the worms, the worms in the media are trying to destroy us.
[02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:43.260]  They've destroyed this country. The very same worms that Obama's now saying, I don't need you
[02:04:43.260 --> 02:04:47.260]  anymore, are now crying that he doesn't need them anymore. But it's those worms, never forget,
[02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:53.340]  who destroyed this country. So what is the end game then if he's even raising taxes on the payroll
[02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:58.620]  of the poorest people? I guess drive them into pure bankruptcy to get on welfare and make them
[02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:03.100]  totally dependent, wreck the country. But you're saying you don't think that's the total plan.
[02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:08.460]  Well, that's what they're doing. No, that's not the plan. I think people think that mistakenly.
[02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:13.580]  Let's look at who doesn't pay taxes in America. Let's look at General Electric. I keep using that
[02:05:13.580 --> 02:05:18.540]  as a prime example for a couple of reasons. GE had reportedly an income of five some billion
[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:24.540]  dollars US income. They pay zero taxes because of the rigged system. Who was the president of
[02:05:24.540 --> 02:05:29.900]  General Electric? Jeffrey Immelt. What else does General Electric own? NBC and MSNBC.
[02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:37.180]  Why else would they take a street slime, an uneducated dolt, a street slime, rabble-rousing,
[02:05:37.180 --> 02:05:43.260]  uneducated rat like Al Sharpton and give him a million dollars a year or more to be on MSNBC?
[02:05:43.260 --> 02:05:48.700]  Because he keeps the mobs, the rent the mobs that he used for years away from Jeffrey Immelt's
[02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:52.380]  General Electric headquarters. Isn't it cheaper to pay a rat like him a million dollars a year?
[02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:56.300]  That's right, and then Obama made the head of GE, the head of the Economic Council,
[02:05:56.300 --> 02:06:00.140]  where they selectively can keep their coal power plants open. They get a waiver,
[02:06:00.140 --> 02:06:03.580]  but everybody else gets shut down. It's classic mafia tactics.
[02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:09.020]  Alex, listen, if GE paid their fair share, and Google paid their fair share,
[02:06:09.020 --> 02:06:12.940]  and all the other corporations who are tied into the Obama administration,
[02:06:12.940 --> 02:06:15.900]  and now let's go to another one, Alex, that no one talks about.
[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:20.620]  Why are Indian gambling casinos tax free? Why don't they pay their fair share?
[02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:23.500]  No, if you're an insider and support the mafia,
[02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:28.940]  you're tax-exempt, and then they say people making 200 something thousand dollars a year are rich,
[02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:34.380]  dirty rats who aren't paying enough federal taxes at 40%. You add all the rest of it,
[02:06:34.380 --> 02:06:38.780]  it's like that golfer pays 65% and bitched about it, and California said,
[02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:44.620]  how dare you, you should pay more. If GE and the other tax-evading
[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:50.060]  corporations paid their fair share, if Indian gambling casinos paid their fair share,
[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:55.340]  this budget would be balanced. But nobody will talk about the sacred cows, will they?
[02:06:55.340 --> 02:06:59.180]  Because they are the government. In other words, they're not separate from the government,
[02:06:59.180 --> 02:07:02.140]  they are the government. Who do you think put this guy in the White House?
[02:07:02.140 --> 02:07:08.140]  So how do we stop them? I don't have an answer other than talking about it.
[02:07:08.140 --> 02:07:14.940]  Free speech has tremendous power. It's the proverbial pebble in the compound, Alex.
[02:07:14.940 --> 02:07:19.020]  If we keep throwing these pebbles into the pond and the rivulets go out to the edges,
[02:07:19.020 --> 02:07:23.660]  eventually people will wake up, eventually they will act up.
[02:07:23.660 --> 02:07:25.580]  There is no other answer that I have, Alex.
[02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:32.620]  I agree with you. If we roll over, we're in deep trouble. And the problem is the same insider
[02:07:32.620 --> 02:07:38.860]  financial interests that are crony monopoliest who want tyranny and an organized command and
[02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:44.780]  control economy, they are funding both parties. And now you see the mainline Republican Party
[02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:49.820]  demonizing the more hardcore Tea Party that are our listeners who are actually just Americans.
[02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:54.700]  What do you think about the establishment Republicans claiming that Obama is a mandate
[02:07:54.700 --> 02:08:00.780]  for socialism and that Republicans should have open borders, abortion, tyranny, everything else?
[02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:05.020]  What do you say to that attempted capitulation? I say it's a hoax.
[02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:11.980]  Well, it's either you want socialism on a fast track with Obama or socialism on a local train
[02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:16.540]  with the Republicans. They're no different. I call them the Demakins for 20 years in radio
[02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:20.140]  or the Republicans. What's the difference? We have a one party system. It's an oligarchy.
[02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:24.140]  We all understand that. So the Republican Party is irrelevant. It's become a totally irrelevant
[02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:28.060]  party. There are some great people in it. Ted Cruz happened to be a big fan of Ted Cruz.
[02:08:28.060 --> 02:08:32.700]  Will they come on the show? Absolutely not. Did Rubio ever want to come on my show? Absolutely
[02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:36.700]  not. So they're all establishment types. I understand that, but I don't hold it against them.
[02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:41.660]  Here's an example of style then. Okay, let me just throw this at you. I was mad. I was angry.
[02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:46.700]  I was in a bad mood. He was playing factoid games. I blew up at Piers Morgan. It was huge news.
[02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:51.660]  He's scared to have me back. They claimed I defeated gun owners, but the truth is it scared
[02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:55.340]  them. And I met with Morgan later. I saw him in Houston and he said, we don't want you back on.
[02:08:55.340 --> 02:08:59.980]  We don't want to make you too prominent when my audience and your audience dwarfs his by a factor
[02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:06.860]  of 10, 15, 20 times. But the issue is I actually kicked their butt because I actually said, get
[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:11.900]  out of your coma, wake up. They say it's discrediting to get angry and aggressive.
[02:09:11.900 --> 02:09:14.620]  The truth is that's one of the only hopes we've got. Do you agree with that?
[02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:18.700]  A thousand percent get in their face. They're a bunch of cowards, every last one of them.
[02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:24.860]  They're terrified of real men. If you can spit in their face and tell them I said so. You have
[02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:30.620]  no idea what contempt I have for these people. The media is destroying America and guys like Piers
[02:09:30.620 --> 02:09:35.980]  Morgan are the epitome of everything wrong with the media. The fact is, Alex, you did a great job.
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:41.260]  I admire you for it and you should keep doing it. I myself don't go on any shows. I haven't for
[02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:46.220]  years. I learned my lesson a long time ago. They're snakes. They're the lowest form of.
[02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:50.060]  They'll tell you it's live and then do a tape show while they're taping you,
[02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:53.260]  while the show's already on, but they'll tape it in a segment and then edit it.
[02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:57.580]  They're incredibly deceptive and expanding on that. I didn't bring that up to inject myself
[02:09:57.580 --> 02:10:02.860]  into the story for listeners. I brought it up to say, I believe and I've seen being aggressive
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:07.260]  with the truth is the only dog we've got in the fight. Look, you did a great job.
[02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:11.020]  Someone's got to fight back. If more in Congress did what you did, we'd be in better shape. Why
[02:10:11.020 --> 02:10:16.140]  don't you run for office? Since I have declared it's time for war, a time for war. Why don't you
[02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:20.940]  go to war and run for Congress? I'll put it back to you. Why don't you run for Congress, Michael?
[02:10:20.940 --> 02:10:24.940]  I thought about it for many years and I'll give you one answer. I don't have the personality for
[02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:31.020]  it. I can't, I can't mince words. I don't have the patience to sit politely with my hands folded
[02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:36.620]  and say, mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. I don't want to do any fundraising. Moreover, I really don't want
[02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:40.940]  to panda for votes. I agree, I absolutely agree. I got involved in some campaign stuff and the
[02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:47.260]  begging for money and the questionnaires and just all the weirdness and the sycophants that worship
[02:10:47.260 --> 02:10:50.540]  the political class totally sick. Now you've talked a lot about this.
[02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:54.700]  The 2 billion bullets, I want to specifically get into that. The domestic drones,
[02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:59.900]  the Homeland Security training. I mean, that has captured the public's attention
[02:10:59.900 --> 02:11:04.700]  that the military industrial complex is being converted over as a system to control us.
[02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:07.660]  I think that's something they're really scared of, us covering that.
[02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:12.460]  Well, it's obvious what they're doing. They're drying up the supply of ammunition.
[02:11:12.460 --> 02:11:16.780]  If they couldn't control the guns, what they're doing is controlling the ammo supply. That's
[02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:21.420]  very obvious. I had an expert on the Michael Savage show last week who called it from WMAL
[02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:26.460]  in Washington. He said he's a manufacturer of weapons and bullets. And he said that's
[02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:31.340]  exactly what they're doing. You don't know this, Alex, but not only did they buy all of the
[02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:36.300]  available ammo, they've put in advance orders to give them priority for any ammo that's manufactured
[02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:40.940]  in the future. What they've done is completely dry up the supply. They're very clever.
[02:11:40.940 --> 02:11:47.660]  Don't ever underestimate your enemy, Alex. I agree. They are very clever. They're very angry.
[02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:52.220]  They're very frightened and that makes for very dangerous enemy. So they can't get you on the
[02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:57.100]  Second Amendment. So they cleverly said, okay, so we can't take the guns away from the cracker.
[02:11:57.100 --> 02:12:01.340]  Let's take the bullets away from the cracker. That's what they're doing here, Alex.
[02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:05.900]  And that's exactly what needs to be exposed to the general public.
[02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:10.140]  You said this about three years ago. And after you said it, there was a Financial Times of London
[02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:15.100]  article, official Democratic Party fundraiser letter to the millionaires that said, don't
[02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:22.060]  worry. He's gonna get reelected and there's gonna be big events that help Obama take over.
[02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:27.580]  There's gonna be crises and we're gonna blame it on the right wing radio. Now, you said that before
[02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:32.300]  they even came out and said it. I've been saying that. What about the false flag Reichstag event,
[02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:37.100]  Michael Savage? I see that as basically all the cornered rats have left.
[02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:39.420]  Stage stuff or let stuff happen and blame it on us.
[02:12:40.060 --> 02:12:44.700]  Well, there are people who are saying that these recent shootings from Sandy Hook onward
[02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:49.020]  were staged by the government in some way. I can't accept that as a reality. I don't know
[02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:53.900]  how they could brainwash that idiot Lanza to go kill innocent schoolchildren.
[02:12:53.900 --> 02:12:55.100]  Sir Ian, Sir Ian.
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:13:00.700]  Go right down the list, right to Dauner. Are they all government brainwashed lunatics?
[02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:05.100]  I mean, I don't know if you believe that, I personally don't. But it's interesting to me as
[02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:09.820]  an epidemiologist that they all seem to come within a short period of time, isn't it? I mean,
[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:14.460]  they've all occurred in a very short period of time, just as the gun grabbers have raised
[02:13:14.460 --> 02:13:18.540]  their rhetoric about taking away our Second Amendment rights. So yeah, I mean, it's easy
[02:13:18.540 --> 02:13:23.340]  to say it fits, but is it true? I don't know. Well, a lot of it is they just, I mean, look at
[02:13:23.980 --> 02:13:29.820]  the Batman shooter in Aurora where he gets DARPA funding and is protected and the psychiatrist's
[02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:34.620]  top Air Force assigned to him. I mean, even the police in LA said Sir Ian, Sir Ian wasn't the
[02:13:34.620 --> 02:13:41.260]  shooter of RFK and you know about amnesiac drugs, Dr. Savage. I really don't know that side of it.
[02:13:41.260 --> 02:13:47.500]  You're so much more deeply involved in this whole side of things that I am, Alex. I don't think we
[02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:53.980]  need to even go there to understand that the enemy of our freedoms exists. It's real. It has names.
[02:13:53.980 --> 02:13:57.660]  Regardless, they're using the crisis to take our liberties like Rahm Emanuel said.
[02:13:57.660 --> 02:14:01.180]  Well, that's right. But why would they let a crisis go to waste?
[02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:04.300]  All right, Michael, I'm going to twist your arm. There's only a five minute segment left. I want
[02:14:04.300 --> 02:14:08.620]  to end the show with you with any other points that you think are important to hear riveting,
[02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:12.860]  important information. I can't believe it. Michael Savage on my syndicated radio broadcast,
[02:14:12.860 --> 02:14:18.060]  a powerful transmission. Michael Savage dot com. I'm Alex Jones with info wars dot com.
[02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:19.820]  Stay with us. We'll be right back. Final segment.
[02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:42.540]  All right. It's the final segment with Michael Savage, the end of the syndicated radio broadcast
[02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:48.940]  today. Just incredible. Incredible. Ron Paul yesterday. Ted Nugent yesterday. So much more.
[02:14:48.940 --> 02:14:53.180]  And we've got all these other big guests coming up later in the week. I was on Howard Stern,
[02:14:53.180 --> 02:14:58.300]  of all people this morning. OK, going to Michael Savage here. I was saying to him during the break,
[02:14:58.300 --> 02:15:03.340]  what is the solution? Let's punch this up. Drug report dot com. Obama, you can't do things by
[02:15:03.340 --> 02:15:09.580]  yourself. And of course, some will say he meant it like, oh, all we're doing is saying I can't
[02:15:09.580 --> 02:15:15.340]  do things by myself. But he's actually implying give me more power and I can fix things. Make me
[02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:20.140]  the dictator. That's what I think was coming out of that. And another backhanded socialist comment.
[02:15:20.140 --> 02:15:24.220]  You didn't build that. But going to Michael Savage, I was asking during the break, what is
[02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:30.620]  the solution? And he said it's in Ecclesiastes. Michael Savage, you have the floor. Ecclesiastes
[02:15:30.620 --> 02:15:36.780]  said to us a time to be born and a time to die, a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to weep
[02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:45.820]  and a time to laugh. A time to seek and a time to lose, a time to love and a time to hate, Alex.
[02:15:45.820 --> 02:15:51.660]  And then Ecclesiastes writes a time for war and a time for peace. I'll ask your listeners
[02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:57.500]  if the left has not declared war in America, if they are at war and they know who their enemy is.
[02:15:57.500 --> 02:16:02.860]  And believe me, they define their enemy every day. Why is it that we don't know that we are at war?
[02:16:02.860 --> 02:16:07.420]  I said the same thing while the Islamists were targeting us every time these stooges
[02:16:07.420 --> 02:16:12.540]  in the CIA or the FBI or DOD would give a speech saying Islam is not at war with America. I would
[02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:17.420]  want to break things in my house. I would say they sure know who they're at war with. They've
[02:16:17.420 --> 02:16:23.180]  declared war on Christianity and Judaism. They declared war on women and freedom. And we don't
[02:16:23.180 --> 02:16:27.180]  know who's at war. They know who they're at war with. And unless we understand that they're at
[02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:32.140]  war with us, we're going to lose this war, Alex, as we are doing. We are losing the war for two
[02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:37.180]  reasons. One, because most Americans don't know that the radical left has won. They're in power
[02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:42.620]  and they're in daily warfare against freedom. Number two, the media no longer exists. And
[02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:47.340]  number three, there is no effective Republican opposition. We have a single one party system in
[02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:53.980]  this country. And so it's left to the people to say, the hell with you. You're at war with me.
[02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:58.860]  I'm going to get in your face like you did on the Piers Morgan show, Alex. Everyone has to get into
[02:16:58.860 --> 02:17:04.860]  everyone's face. Don't let them run you down with guilt or with shame. There are more of us than
[02:17:04.860 --> 02:17:13.260]  there are of them. And we can win if we just don't give in. In the few minutes we've got left,
[02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:19.260]  is there any chance to get an impeachment movement going? No, don't waste your time. It'll work for
[02:17:19.260 --> 02:17:25.020]  Obama, not against him. It'll be turned into a laughing stock by Rahm Emanuel and the media
[02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:29.340]  operatives. Okay, well then how do you stop him? I mean, what do you do? He's going to make a bigger
[02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:34.140]  mistake than he's already made. See, I'm a believer in God and faith. And I believe this
[02:17:34.140 --> 02:17:41.100]  man is so out of control with his ego. One of the things I do for a living is I watch behavior.
[02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:47.740]  If you watch Obama walk, if you watch him speak, you see the man bopping down Air Force One.
[02:17:47.740 --> 02:17:52.460]  You see him inviting the slime from Hollywood sewer pipe into the White House. You see him
[02:17:52.460 --> 02:17:58.700]  using his wife in a way that the first lady has never been used before. These people are out of
[02:17:58.700 --> 02:18:04.700]  control, Alex. They're going to make an error. I believe that God's hand is behind it all. I just
[02:18:04.700 --> 02:18:09.260]  think God's taking his time about it. This man will make an error through arrogance that will
[02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:16.220]  bring the entire house of cards down. That is my belief. I agree that power never works the way
[02:18:16.220 --> 02:18:23.820]  they want, like Hitler turning east into Russia. And as I get more power, I get more humble.
[02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:28.380]  I don't understand this thing of as you get more power, you get more crazy and more arrogant.
[02:18:28.380 --> 02:18:32.540]  That's because you don't use drugs. They do. They're all medicated. There should be drug
[02:18:32.540 --> 02:18:38.300]  testing in Congress. There should be drug testing in Congress, Alex. My final word.
[02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:43.100]  And again, you've got a degree in epidemiology, nutrition, sciences, PhDs. I mean, you name it.
[02:18:43.100 --> 02:18:48.540]  And you can recognize it. And I look at Pelosi. She looks like she's hopped up. I mean,
[02:18:48.540 --> 02:18:52.140]  if I pulled her over, if I was a cop, she was like a total like she's on something.
[02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:57.340]  She's on power. But if you look at Congress and make them pee in a cup,
[02:18:57.980 --> 02:19:01.340]  I guarantee you 60 percent of them would be fired. Amazing. The book,
[02:19:01.340 --> 02:19:04.540]  A Time for War. Get it. Get it out to everybody. They don't want you to read it.
