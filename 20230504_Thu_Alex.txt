[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.360]  They're all contributing to organized crime by paying large sums of money to be brought
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.360]  in here.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.000]  And to give you an example, the Chinese are paying $50,000.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.640]  The Indians are paying $10,000 to $20,000.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.980]  All the Central Americans, the average is about $7,000.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.140]  So when the Mexicans, especially Southern Mexico, are paying $3,000.
[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:40.060]  So it's a huge, huge money event for the cartels, probably even more lucrative than the drug
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.060]  business.
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.980]  As we talk to some of these asylum seekers, they're waiting for May 11th.
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.500]  May 11th, they believe, will be the day that they become, without any documentation, they
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.220]  can come into the United States.
[00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.300]  Back in 2019, South Texas Border Volunteers founder, Dr. Michael Vickers, had already
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.140]  declared the invasion of his property and neighboring properties a war.
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.460]  Four years later, the situation has become an apocalypse.
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.460]  How have things escalated?
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.460]  Oh, it's unbelievable.
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.460]  What's happened?
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.460]  The groups have gotten bigger.
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.460]  The people are coming from more countries now.
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:25.540]  From Africa, from China, from all over the planet.
[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.580]  And their disposition has changed.
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.580]  They're more combative.
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.340]  And when we encounter them, they want to put up a fight.
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.220]  And they're being led by gang members.
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.220]  We're seeing a lot of repeat people coming in.
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.980]  They can't give up for amnesty.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.900]  They've been previously deported.
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.660]  They've got criminal records from the countries they come from, or from here.
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.340]  And those are the type of people that we're encountering now.
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.820]  One of our operations a year or two ago, there were 24 Guatemalans in it.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.300]  They cut the gate on the pipeline, 10 miles off the highway, and there were probably
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.300]  24 in it.
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.860]  We were able to get air support, get the border patrol in there to get them apprehended.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.020]  We had a guy with a rifle leading a group of 33 Chinese, and our guys stepped out from
[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.020]  here to there.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.020]  They were right on the trail.
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.020]  The guy almost ran over them, but we got the drop on him.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.620]  He ran over two of them, jumped in the fence, took off.
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.620]  We never caught him, but we were able to get 29 of them caught that night, all Chinese.
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.340]  And all of them at that time were paying $40,000 to $50,000.
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.260]  Do they speak English really well?
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.540]  We had one group of 16.
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.940]  There were three girls in there from China.
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.180]  All the rest were Middle East, and they spoke perfect English.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.220]  Horrific personal stories like that of Texas Gulf Coast War on Fentanyl founder Sarah Chittum
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.580]  should serve as a wake-up call to the exponential tragedies many more Americans will face.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:02.140]  As a mom who lost her only biological son, I often wondered, what is my purpose now?
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.940]  He was in and out of trouble quite a bit.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.460]  And I was the epitome of a tough-loved mother.
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.060]  So at about age 19, he ended up getting kicked out of my home.
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:21.580]  He went to live with a childhood friend, and during that time, a home invasion occurred.
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.580]  The people that broke into the home did not realize that my son was home, and the man
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.140]  put my son in a headlock and told the girlfriend to shoot him.
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.180]  The girlfriend opened fire on my son and emptied her entire clip into him.
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.060]  My son had to spend over a month in ICU during COVID where he could have no visitors, meaning
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.500]  during the most painful, shattered time in his life, I couldn't be there.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.700]  And when he got out of the hospital, he feared.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.700]  He feared for his life.
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.660]  Seth had never received justice for being shot, and he feared that the couple would come
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.860]  after him to finish the job.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.900]  I'm sure he wanted just a little bit of mental relief, so he bought a pill from somebody
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.900]  he called family.
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.220]  That means to me that he trusted this guy.
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.740]  Unfortunately, that pill contained a lethal dose of illicit fentanyl, and it took my
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.740]  son's life.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:26.100]  If you ask me, I agree that this needs to be declared a weapon of mass destruction.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.060]  Meanwhile, the Houston division of the FBI admits to posting the wrong photo and incorrect
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:40.580]  spelling of Texas mass murderer Francisco Uripeza, while Texas Governor Abbott is propagandized
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.580]  for stating the obvious.
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.740]  Critics are outraged that the governor brought up immigration status at all in this case.
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.860]  As the globalists continue their assault on the interior of the United States unobstructed.
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.980]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:05.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.940]  in plain view.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.700]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.980]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.220]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:26.500]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.820]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.980]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.900]  disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.140]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.620]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.020]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarestore.com.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.820]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.180]  X3 back in stock.
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.180]  Take action now.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.180]  Infowarestore.com.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.180]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.180]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.180]  It is Thursday, May 4th, 2023.
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:34.180]  And the globalists are trying to sabotage not just America, but the entire world.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.180]  But humanity is waking up across this planet.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.180]  Thank you so much again for joining us today.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:52.180]  We have one of the top immigration investigators in the world, Michael Yon, joining us from
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.180]  the Darien Gap in Central America.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.180]  From a uplink he has found in the middle of the jungle, we are also going to be having
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.180]  Norm Pattis on, Andrew Hernandez.
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:10.180]  Norm Pattis is one of the main lawyers for the Proud Boys, who just 30 minutes ago were
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.180]  found guilty of terrorism, seditious conspiracy.
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:24.180]  They face decades and decades in prison, in the Rigg trial, in the district of Mordor,
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.180]  hell on the Potomac, Washington, D.C.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.180]  That is all coming up today in the third hour.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.180]  Now, we've got massive news on every front.
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.180]  I'm going to be judicious with the time and coverage.
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.180]  But as I can, let me tell you what we've got coming up.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.180]  Russia blames U.S. for drone strikes on Kremlin.
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.180]  White House denies involvement.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.180]  And NBC News says it's probably a false flag attack.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.180]  I thought false flags don't happen.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.180]  And yes, the Russians could have staged this against themselves.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.180]  I don't believe they did.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.180]  But that's something that really goes on.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.180]  So it's reasonable to ask that question.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.180]  But why can't we ask that?
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.180]  Why do we get sued if we ask if big events can be staged?
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.180]  Historically, that stuff happens a lot.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.180]  So World War III alert.
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:09.180]  Russia threatens nuclear war and political assassinations in response to a Kremlin drone attack.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.180]  Also, over 50 percent of Americans believe their money is not safe in the banks.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:19.180]  As experts warn, the system faces total collapse.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:24.180]  We're going to be laying all of that out as well today.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:30.180]  We have the transgender cult going crazy and attacking different facilities and capitals around the country, including yesterday.
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.180]  We have footage of that.
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:42.180]  We're also going to be looking at store shutdowns across the country in blue cities,
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:50.180]  where the Walmarts, the Targets, the Whole Foods, the Walgreens, the Nordstroms are all closing,
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:55.180]  saying that basically blue cities are unlivable crime-ridden hellholes.
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.180]  We have a lot of video of that.
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.180]  Also, it finally happened.
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.180]  And every time it does, the media makes it the biggest story on earth.
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.180]  A white man killed a black man.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.180]  And so you're never going to hear the end of it, even though black-on-white crime is now 21 to 1.
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:16.180]  According to FBI crime statistics, for every 21 attacks on whites, there is one attack on a black by a white person.
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.180]  I'm not attacking black people.
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.180]  That's just the facts.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.180]  Most black people are not doing this.
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:25.180]  It is a minority, though, of black males and black females that are now viciously attacking whites everywhere.
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:32.180]  Well, some type of argument broke out on a subway, and a white former Marine choked the man for only about 30 seconds,
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.180]  probably went too far, killed him.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:40.180]  And now, oh, the demonstrations, the riots, it's all beginning, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.180]  because they finally have another George Floyd image they need.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.180]  Chokehold death of Jordan Neely.
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:53.180]  Ruled a homicide as outrage grows over caught-on-video subway killing.
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:58.180]  I could show you 100 videos of whites being attacked, many of them being killed, from just this week.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.180]  We don't really show a lot of that, though, because it would take the whole show over.
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.180]  We show some of it.
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:08.180]  But maybe we should just do a whole four-hour show and just show back-to-back blacks murdering whites.
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.180]  But, see, the media doesn't show that because they're helping promote that idea,
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.180]  that that's a good thing to happen or that whites deserve it.
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:25.180]  But, oh, my gosh, a white guy accidentally kills a black man who they admit was being aggressive and is mentally ill.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.180]  And it is the end of the world because perception is reality.
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:34.180]  The media is going to show us this millions of times on air, and it's going to try to create more white guilt.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.180]  It is truly disgusting.
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:40.180]  Kind of like the illegal alien Hispanic gentleman, use that term lightly,
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:45.180]  that shot and killed four other or five other illegal aliens in Texas.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:50.180]  They're still reporting he's white and using another name and saying a Texas man did it.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.180]  And now they're spinning it, a Texas man killed illegal aliens.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.180]  No, he was a multi-time deported criminal.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.180]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.180]  That's how they spin.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.180]  That's how they deceive.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:07.180]  Then, obviously, we've got really big news on the Jeffrey Epstein intelligence agency angle.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:14.180]  I told you a decade ago that he was running an operation for the Mossad, for the CIA, and for MI6.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.180]  And now those documents are all coming out.
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:23.180]  The head of the CIA, the head of the Mossad, British intelligence, all of them in his New York compound,
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:29.180]  where politicians and other corporate and business leaders and scientific leaders went there to have sex with underage girls,
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:36.180]  knowing it was all being videotaped as part of their initiation into the system so they would have dirt on them.
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.180]  And so now they can, quote, be registered as spies of this global crime network.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:47.180]  And, again, the opening level initiation is sex with a 15-year-old girl.
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:54.180]  Then if you want higher level assignments, you've got to then strangle children, rape children as old as three months old.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.180]  I told you all about it years ago.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.180]  It's all coming out now.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.180]  But that's who runs your government.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.180]  You wonder why they're so evil, why they're so bad.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:06.180]  At the top of the intelligence agencies, it's all one group in the Western intelligence, Australian intelligence,
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:13.180]  New Zealand intelligence, German intelligence, French intelligence, U.K. intelligence, Dutch intelligence.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:20.180]  The heads of the groups run giant child kidnapping, torture, and murder operations.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:25.180]  And when you rarely get somebody in there, in one of the top slots that isn't one of their people,
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.180]  they go completely crazy, and it's a government red alert.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:36.180]  When General Flynn became the national security advisor to Trump, it was an all-hands-on-deck, remove him, set him up.
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:43.180]  That was in the FBI memos because General Flynn is a family man, a war hero, comes from a great family, and is a patriot.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.180]  Because he was not a pedophile, he had to be removed.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.180]  That's how this works.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.180]  And they've almost got complete control at the top now.
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:57.180]  You see a top Democrat politician, they're having sex with children, bare minimum.
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:03.180]  That's why Hunter Biden, Biden, Biden's daughter, my dad had sex with me in the shower.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:10.180]  That's why Biden's wife runs around getting off Air Force One dressed in stripper outfits and fishnet stockings.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.180]  They have sex with anything that can walk or crawl.
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.180]  And they're maniacs.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.180]  They're maniacs.
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.180]  They're complete, absolute sex cult maniacs.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:26.180]  And they're now externalizing their hierarchy, their cult, onto us on a mass scale.
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.180]  We're going to be going over all of that today.
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:38.180]  And then one of the most bizarre things that ever happened to me in my life happened yesterday afternoon at about 545.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:45.180]  I was sitting in an accounting meeting, InfoWars accounting meeting, in an office building, not here.
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.180]  And the phone rings.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.180]  And it says Tucker Carlson.
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.180]  And we talk here and there on the phone.
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.180]  We text a lot.
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.180]  And I said, I'm going to step out.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.180]  Got an important call to make.
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.180]  And I stepped out into the hallway.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.180]  And somebody tried to shake my hand.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.180]  I said, hey, I can't talk.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.180]  I was a little bit distracted.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.180]  I go, hey, what's going on, Tucker?
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.180]  And it's Tucker Carlson's voice.
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:14.180]  And I start saying these horrible, lewd, sexual things to me.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.180]  And I instantly figure out, this is AI.
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.180]  Someone's spoofing his number.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.180]  And I confront the individuals on this.
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.180]  They say a few more things.
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.180]  And then the phone hangs up.
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:31.180]  And I immediately called Tucker and talked to him, talked to his lead producer as well.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:38.180]  Called Scooter up and just said, hey, if this just happened to me, it's probably happening to other people.
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.180]  This is the next level of their setup.
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:47.180]  And then it turns out the individual that did it that has quite the following on Twitter bragged that they had just done it
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.180]  and just recorded it and done it.
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.180]  And so we're going to be talking about that, looking at that.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.180]  He says he's going to be airing it.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.180]  His name is Prank Stallone on Twitter.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.180]  He's going to be airing it on his show Monday.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.180]  Well, it's very important for Prank Stallone to come on this show today or tomorrow
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.180]  and explain he's not part of a government group or an agency.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:15.180]  Because what he did, spoofing someone's number and then doing that in many jurisdictions is a crime.
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.180]  Now, I don't think Tucker Carlson wants to press charges.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:26.180]  But you need to come on the air and need to explain your intent was not to be mean.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.180]  Because he says he's pointing out the dangers of AI here.
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.180]  Fine and dandy.
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.180]  But it's serious.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.180]  Because you don't know what's going on, what's been happening to Tucker behind the scenes.
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:44.180]  And so you need to understand what you did is not good.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.180]  And we need to get that out in the open so that it doesn't escalate any further.
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.180]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.180]  It's going to be one hell of a transmission.
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.180]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.180]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.180]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.180]  It will change your life.
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:15.180]  The UN admits and the Lancet Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:20.180]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:26.180]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.180]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:38.180]  And InfoWars.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.180]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.180]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.180]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.180]  You and your family need it.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.180]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.180]  X3, triiodine, exclusively at InfoWars.com.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.180]  Take action now.
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.180]  But regardless, research this info.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.180]  TurboForce is back.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.180]  Sold out for eight months.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.180]  And it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.180]  We made it even stronger.
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.180]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:18.180]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:24.180]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.180]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:31.180]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:37.180]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:41.180]  It is the super fuel.
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.180]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.180]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.180]  There are two different nootropics.
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.180]  They go good with this.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.180]  But this is the king kong.
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.180]  This is the boss.
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:54.180]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, InfoWars.com.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.180]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:07.180]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.180]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:18.180]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.180]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:26.180]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:31.180]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury,
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.180]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:41.180]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.180]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:48.180]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:54.180]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a remedy to this madness.
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.180]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:03.180]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:07.180]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.180]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.180]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.180]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:20.180]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:24.180]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.180]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.180]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion. It just happened.
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.180]  We need to go into the capital.
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.180]  You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distractions.
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:44.180]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices.
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:48.180]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:55.180]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, as soon as these globalists start going to prison.
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:18.540]  It was an important three-minute breakdown that I issued two years ago,
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:22.540]  and it's a message to the globalists, they are not our gods, they are not invincible.
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:29.540]  Henry Kissinger, Klaus Schwab, the whole globalist system that they've inherited from the Rockefellers and Rothschilds,
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.540]  think they're God, but they're not God.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.540]  They didn't create this planet, they didn't create the sun, they didn't create the universe,
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.540]  they didn't create the trillions and trillions of galaxies that we know exist.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.540]  They can't even comprehend God or how to be just good people.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:47.540]  All they are is selfish demons that seek to take control of your lives,
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.540]  who seek to harness humanity and convince us that they are superior to us,
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.540]  and that we have to serve them and their ideas.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.540]  They want control of our bodies with their nanotech, with their genetic engineering.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.540]  They want us to accept the fact that they can put in our bodies what they want, when they want,
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:07.540]  and then lie to us about the fact they call it a vaccine when it is gene therapy.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.540]  This is all about their quest for eternal life.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:16.540]  They are testing on the general public, trying to find compounds from toxic experiments
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:21.540]  that give them what they call the Lazarus gene and other systems they're searching for.
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:26.540]  It all started in the 1950s when they discovered immortal cell lines,
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.540]  cells that never die and replicate forever.
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.540]  We call it, of course, the more vicious types of cancer.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:40.540]  But through death and through mass experimentation against the general population,
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.540]  they believe they will find the keys to immortality.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.540]  So as you see the beauty of the universe that God gave us, realize the globalists are not God.
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:53.540]  The globalists are simply parasites who are selfishly trying to take control of your life
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.540]  in a hope of artificially building immortality for themselves.
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.540]  When immortality has been given to us by God through our consciousness,
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:06.540]  if we choose to be with God and not serve ourselves and be selfish entities.
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.540]  And that's the truth.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.540]  And that's what M4 War stands for, is getting you to think for yourself
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:17.540]  and to get outside the box and realize that God created the universe for us to have communion with God,
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.540]  not for us to pretend that we are God.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.540]  Those that try to do that, we have a name for them.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.540]  They're called sickness.
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.540]  They're called sickness.
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.540]  They believe that Lucifer can be his own God, just as they can be their own God.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.540]  Just as in the story of Adam and Eve in the Bible, Satan says to Eve,
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.540]  you can be a god.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.540]  And she goes to Adam and says, you can be a god.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.540]  Just eating up this tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.540]  The knowledge of evil.
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.540]  We were perfect and innocent.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:44.540]  We had only the knowledge of good.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:49.540]  Knowledge of evil is how to manipulate, how to twist, how to set up corrupt criminal systems,
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.540]  how to play God.
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:55.540]  As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.540]  And we're entering those days now.
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.540]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.540]  This is M4 Wars.
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.540]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.540]  And we are back broadcasting worldwide.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.540]  All right, let's get into the situation in Russia.
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:19.540]  As I said yesterday, Russia has said a red line is trying to take Crimea in the south of Ukraine
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:26.540]  and a red line is trying to assassinate Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader.
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.540]  Russia blames U.S. for drone strike on Kremlin.
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.540]  White House denies involvement, but it gets richer.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.540]  Assassination attempt on Putin threatens to escalate nuclear war.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:39.540]  NBC, false flag.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.540]  Analysts say Russia likely staged Kremlin drone attack.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.540]  It blamed on Ukraine in the west, but no proof.
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.540]  Russia claims U.S. masterminded drone attack on Kremlin.
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:57.540]  Russia calls for Zelensky to be killed and threatens nuke response after Ukraine tries to assassinate Putin.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.540]  NATO warns Russia could target undersea pipelines and cables.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.540]  Think about that last article.
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:12.540]  We know from Cihers' reporting and also the witnesses and the intel that's come out
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:19.540]  that NATO via Biden blew up the pipeline using Navy demolition personnel, deep sea divers.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:28.540]  We know that Victoria Nuland and Biden and others bragged that if Russia went into Ukraine,
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:32.540]  now 15, 16 months ago, 14 months ago,
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:37.540]  14 months ago, that they would blow up the pipeline.
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:45.540]  But the lie here that Putin false flagged the Kremlin, I believe it's a lie,
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.540]  is just as ridiculous as him saying that Putin blew up the Nord Stream pipeline.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.540]  All he had to do was turn it off.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.540]  And all the strategic reasons and all the kimono benefits goes to the west.
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.540]  We have admissions, threats to blow it up, evidence the west blew it up.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.540]  Then now they have articles all over the place, this is Politico,
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:10.540]  that BBC two days ago saying Russia blew up the pipeline with no evidence
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.540]  and saying Russia is going to blow up more pipelines.
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.540]  Now they could reciprocate and start blowing up Western pipelines
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.540]  and then just say we don't know who did it.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.540]  It's like the west did.
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.540]  That could happen.
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.540]  And there is a chance Putin could have false flagged himself.
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.540]  Governments do that.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.540]  So that's always something that has to be looked at.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.540]  But notice our media says there's no such thing as false flags
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.540]  until they say there's such thing as false flags.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.540]  Remember the CIA and State Department briefings right before Russia invaded
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.540]  saying Putin is going to stage attacks on his border regions as a pretext to go in.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.540]  But we know the west was already attacking those regions
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.540]  and the war was already going on.
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.540]  Putin launched a counter offensive.
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:47.540]  And I'm not defending that.
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.540]  I thought it was a bad idea.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.540]  But the global is starting all this and overthrowing the Ukrainian government
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.540]  nine years ago and everything has led to this point we're at now.
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.540]  And George Soros bragging about it on TV.
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.540]  They're the ones that initiated this in their own words.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.540]  So just like all big wars this is escalating incrementally.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.540]  And now the escalation is accelerating to light speed.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:16.540]  Meanwhile if you think Anheuser-Busch products total being down 24 percent
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.540]  and the biggest plunge ever seen in any major company,
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.540]  any product company, any service company was bad.
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:27.540]  Fox News has seen an overall 52 percent decline in viewers
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.540]  in just the last week since Tucker Carlson was unceremoniously fired.
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.540]  Some of the shows have lost 74 percent of their audience.
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.540]  I have those numbers here.
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.540]  And that's coming up because it really shows get woke, go broke.
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.540]  The system doesn't care because they're kamikazes.
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.540]  They have unlimited money.
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.540]  This is a mission to control and dominate us.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.540]  So whether it's the NFL or whether it's the NBA or whether it's Hollywood
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.540]  or whether it's Fox News,
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.540]  they are all attacking to bring in their global government,
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.540]  their cashless society, their new world order.
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.540]  Meanwhile you wonder why the military has the worst recruiting
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.540]  in modern history in the U.S.
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.540]  After they saw the Dylan Mulvaney bloodlight disaster,
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:13.540]  the Navy just spent tens of millions of dollars running TV ads
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:18.540]  and digital ads for the new ambassador for the U.S. Navy
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.540]  and it is a man in a dress with a wig on.
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.540]  Here it is.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.540]  This Navy sailor is a drag queen.
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.540]  Drag queens welcome in the Navy.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.540]  Again, if a dude's dressed up like a woman,
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.540]  that's their issue.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.540]  But the issue is they're saying,
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.540]  this is a place where it's good for you to do this.
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.540]  You can come to the Navy and dress like a woman.
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:49.540]  Is anybody going to operate a ship
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.540]  or do any other type of work where all of this craziness is going on?
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:58.540]  This is how you bring a society down with all this clown behavior.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.540]  When they say drag queen, they mean men going after children.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.540]  I'm not saying they're all doing that,
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.540]  but nobody's banning drag shows.
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.540]  They're banning sexually explicit shows with children.
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.540]  That's already illegal.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.540]  Why a new law is needed, I don't know.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.540]  But it's being done like in libraries and places,
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.540]  not classical venues like topless bars.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.540]  Again, if you walked into a topless bar,
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.540]  I'm not judging you.
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.540]  If you walked into a topless bar
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.540]  and there were like 25, 30-year-old women up there dancing
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.540]  or putting $5 bills in their G-string,
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:30.540]  and then all of a sudden they brought out a 7-year-old boy or girl,
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:32.540]  you'd call the police.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.540]  You'd say, what the hell is this?
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:36.540]  A little kid in a G-string.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.540]  It's pedo stuff.
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.540]  It's indecency with a child.
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:42.540]  It's contributing to the delinquency of minors.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.540]  But they're doing it.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.540]  Nobody's banning books.
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:47.540]  We're saying don't give pedophile books to kids.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.540]  Nobody's banning any of this garbage.
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:51.540]  You're just saying, stay away from our kids,
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.540]  you cult of freakazoids.
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:55.540]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:57.540]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:05.850]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.850]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:17.850]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:31.850]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:41.850]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.850]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:49.850]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:51.850]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:55.850]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:56.850]  X3, back in stock.
[00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:57.850]  Take action now.
[00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.850]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:05.850]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:06.850]  People said, no way.
[00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:07.850]  He's the most powerful that ever happened.
[00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:10.850]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:12.850]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.850]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:17.850]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:24.850]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.850]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.850]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:34.850]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:38.850]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.850]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.850]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:45.850]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:51.850]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support while getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:52.850]  So don't procrastinate.
[00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.850]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.850]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air.
[00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:58.850]  And never submit to these tyrants.
[00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:00.850]  TurboForce is back.
[00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.850]  Sold out for eight months.
[00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:04.850]  And it's TurboForce+.
[00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.850]  We made it even stronger.
[00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:10.850]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:17.850]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:23.850]  And it's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:25.850]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:33.850]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything.
[00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.850]  It's good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:39.850]  It is the super fuel.
[00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.850]  BrainForce Plus is great.
[00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:42.850]  BrainForce Ultra is great.
[00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:43.850]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:44.850]  They go good with this.
[00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.850]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:48.850]  This is the boss.
[00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:49.850]  TurboForce.
[00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:50.850]  Back in stock.
[00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:51.850]  Discounted.
[00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:53.850]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.850]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:04.850]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:07.850]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:09.850]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:10.850]  Period.
[00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:11.850]  Case closed.
[00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:12.850]  Out to get you and your family.
[00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:17.850]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.850]  It's been around about 15 years.
[00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:21.850]  It became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:27.850]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price.
[00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:30.850]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.850]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels.
[00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.850]  Thousands of chemicals.
[00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:35.850]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.850]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:43.850]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:49.850]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:50.850]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:52.850]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:53.850]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:56.850]  The point is you get the filters at MFORSTORE.COM.
[00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:57.850]  They're discounted right now.
[00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:58.850]  Finally back in stock.
[00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:04.850]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.850]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:26.510]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:30.630]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:36.830]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:41.470]  Well, the jury returned part of its verdict about an hour ago.
[00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:47.030]  They're facing 40 plus years in prison now for seditious conspiracy,
[00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.270]  a terrorism charge not used in decades.
[00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:51.150]  Total setup.
[00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:55.310]  They didn't even do as much as the trans cult did yesterday.
[00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:59.350]  Breaking into the Congress, breaking into the State House
[00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:01.350]  and wrestling and attacking police.
[00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:05.710]  Didn't even do what they did, but the left can burn down buildings
[00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.470]  do whatever they want. That's that's wonderful.
[00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.870]  But now these men are facing decades in prison.
[00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:13.190]  The jury is still out on the lesser charges.
[00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.230]  Soon as that comes in, Norm Pattis will be able to join us.
[00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:20.510]  One of the lawyers involved in trying to try this case in this rigged situation.
[00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:23.470]  So that is coming up again.
[00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:26.590]  We have a guest who's at the Darien Gap and has been able to get a feed
[00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.990]  out of the jungle where the globalist U.N.
[00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:31.750]  bases have been set up.
[00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.990]  Mr. Yan will be joining us.
[00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:36.630]  So much more today.
[00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.310]  But I want to hit the trans cult some more here
[00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:40.950]  and some big developments on that front.
[00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:44.150]  But first, something very, very exciting has happened.
[00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:47.750]  The highest quality deep earth crystal tri iodine,
[00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:51.190]  a deep earth crystal and two other types for better absorption and synergy.
[00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:54.750]  X3 sold out for six plus months.
[00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:58.350]  Now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:01.110]  I put together this little informational piece to lay it out.
[00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:03.270]  We'll play this and then come right back with the news.
[00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:07.350]  I want to talk to you about something right now
[00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:09.830]  that can and will change your life.
[00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:12.670]  It changed my life and millions of other people's lives.
[00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:15.790]  In fact, billions, some of the better, some of the worse.
[00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.590]  I'm talking about iodine deficiency.
[00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:21.350]  Now, this is a very complex issue.
[00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.990]  But in the next few minutes, I want to try to boil it down for you.
[00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:27.510]  I have Wikipedia right here with links to the U.N.
[00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:31.750]  itself, admitting that over two billion people
[00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:34.950]  have intellectual disability, lower IQs,
[00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:39.950]  psychological problems, neurological issues because of lack of iodine,
[00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:43.870]  particularly when they're developing and growing as children,
[00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:46.310]  but also throughout life.
[00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.270]  Now, most iodine that's in food is bound to other elements.
[00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:52.470]  So your body cannot absorb it.
[00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:56.350]  Atomic iodine is pure deep earth crystal iodine.
[00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:59.070]  And until we started selling it about 12 years ago,
[00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:01.590]  nobody else in the world was doing that.
[00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.150]  There are other types of iodine that are not pure atomic,
[00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:07.430]  that are very close to it, that are also good for the body
[00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:11.030]  and help with the absorption of regular atomic or nascent iodine.
[00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.950]  That's why we're top researchers.
[00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:16.790]  We developed X3 that has a deep earth crystal iodine
[00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:21.310]  and two other types of iodine in it as well for better absorption.
[00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:23.030]  And it's been sold out for many, many months.
[00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:26.950]  But now we got a big shipment of it in to Infowarsstore.com right now.
[00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.510]  And it's 25 percent off.
[00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:33.990]  So I want to encourage everybody to go to the encyclopedia,
[00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.350]  to go to medical literature, go wherever you want.
[00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:39.310]  Wikipedia is not always accurate, but you can check the bibliography here.
[00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:43.230]  The links. This this is an accurate report right here from the UN,
[00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:47.030]  from major studies, you name it, about iodine deficiency
[00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:53.350]  being the number one cause worldwide of what they call intellectual disability.
[00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:57.190]  And if you look here on page two, it says,
[00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:00.990]  While reporting recent progress towards overcoming iodine deficiency disorders
[00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:05.310]  worldwide, the Lancet Medical Journal noted that the World Health Organization
[00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:10.830]  in 2007, nearly two billion individuals had insufficient iodine intake.
[00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:13.310]  A third being school age.
[00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:14.790]  And it goes on.
[00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.830]  The conclusion was made that the single most preventable case
[00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:20.830]  of intellectual disability is that of iodine deficiency.
[00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:24.710]  The single biggest reason people are so dumb
[00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:30.830]  and IQs worldwide are dropping like a lead balloon is iodine deficiency.
[00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:35.830]  Now, there was massive IQ dropping and massive deformities in the 20s and 30s.
[00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:39.670]  So the U.S. government, as well as other governments, said, by law,
[00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:43.270]  we're going to put it in the salt and we're going to encourage bakeries
[00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:46.550]  and companies that sell flour to put some iodine in it.
[00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:51.390]  IQs exploded up to 15 points on average in just a few years.
[00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.750]  Then in the 80s, they took it out.
[00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:56.070]  And in this own report from Wikipedia,
[00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:02.070]  they admit that they put in things that counter the iodine,
[00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.670]  like bromide, bromine and other things
[00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:12.070]  instead of the iodine that you need when the other chemicals are toxic.
[00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:15.910]  This is absolutely insane.
[00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:19.310]  So, ladies and gentlemen, get X3 back in stock.
[00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:22.830]  Consult your physician before you use it because you already have thyroid issues.
[00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:24.710]  There could be some issues.
[00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:30.030]  But find out about the power of triiodine in your body.
[00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.230]  Go to MFORSTORE.com. Read about it.
[00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:35.750]  Consult your physician or health care provider and then get a bottle of it.
[00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:39.350]  It usually takes when you're deficient about two weeks for you to feel the effects.
[00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:41.230]  After about two weeks, on average,
[00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.230]  you'll feel a little bit groggy and weird for a few days.
[00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:47.310]  And then all of a sudden, boom, you feel younger, you feel stronger.
[00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:50.270]  Things just your skin, your body, your libido, your energy,
[00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:53.550]  your electrochemical activities in your brain is simply incredible.
[00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:56.030]  So it's finally back in stock.
[00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:59.630]  X3, MFORSTORE.com, stock up on it,
[00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:01.750]  because I don't know when we're going to be able to have it again.

[00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:19.870]  MFORSTORE.com, X3 back in stock.
[00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:23.750]  We hope to have it in the future, but it's been sold out for more than six months.
[00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:26.030]  It's very hard to produce it,
[00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:30.070]  but it is now available to you and your family yet again.
[00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:32.910]  Experience the power of triiodine.

[00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:53.310]  it should be with products like X3.
[00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:56.070]  There's nothing else like this, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.510]  Many of you I know have been waiting. Love it. It's back. OK.
[00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:18.190]  Let's do this.
[00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:22.630]  Got a large stack here on the whole trends agenda,
[00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:24.990]  which is funded by the biggest banks, the biggest corporations,
[00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:28.990]  the biggest media outlets, CIA, MI6, Tabastock Institute,
[00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.950]  CIA director with Epstein.
[00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.230]  It's all in the news now.
[00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.030]  We can make jokes about this.
[00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:39.390]  And there are a lot of trolls out there who just want to make money.
[00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.510]  Who just want to make money.
[00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.030]  So every woman's sport.
[00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:47.550]  From chess to poker, which are mental sports.
[00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:53.190]  To basketball, to track, to swimming,
[00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:56.550]  cycling, to rugby, to cricket.
[00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.150]  In just the last few years,
[00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:03.790]  almost every sport is now dominated by biological men, and most of the men.
[00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.990]  Are making a joke out of it and just making the money.
[00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:11.990]  So you've now got famous world champion power lifters with beards.
[00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:18.030]  Coming in and winning the powerlifting contest and getting the $100,000 prizes.
[00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:19.590]  That just happened a few weeks ago.
[00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:21.710]  And it's been done again.
[00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:22.830]  We'll show you a video of this in a moment.
[00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.270]  They get the really serious areas.
[00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:26.910]  Bearded man in her.
[00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:29.630]  Moment crushes the competition.
[00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:33.630]  And it's just a fact that it's not that men are smarter than women.
[00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:37.470]  There's different types of intelligence, but men strategically
[00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:39.750]  in every study, on average.
[00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.870]  Are better at poker.
[00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:46.590]  At chess, it's how a male brain is set up,
[00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.310]  there's less connections in the left and right hemisphere.
[00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:52.190]  In the analytical area, men's brains are more focused.
[00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:54.670]  Not that they have more neurons than women, they don't.
[00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:57.430]  It's that women's brains are different than men.
[00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:00.750]  Men are more direct, more precise.
[00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.830]  Women are more intuitive.
[00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:04.910]  Women are more women's intuition.
[00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:06.310]  Everybody knows about that.
[00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:07.990]  Women have other skills that men don't have.
[00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:09.350]  So it's not an attack on women.
[00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:09.990]  We're different.
[00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:13.110]  Everybody knows that men on average are twice as strong as women.
[00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:16.350]  That's just a fact.
[00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:18.070]  And so.
[00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.710]  The reality is every sport.
[00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:26.510]  Is being dominated by men posing as women.
[00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:31.510]  So let's play a short clip of 70 year old poker player David Hughes
[00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:34.470]  dominating the women. Here it is.
[00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:36.390]  Our bounty on his head.
[00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:38.190]  He's already busted twice.
[00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:40.870]  So we love him for that. Thank you, Dave.
[00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:44.950]  Good luck. Not really.
[00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:46.430]  Oh, yes. All right.
[00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:49.510]  We have Dave here and he I don't know if you can tell here.
[00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.950]  He's the only guy in this lady's events.
[00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:56.070]  So I put a $300 bounty on his head
[00:42:56.710 --> 00:43:00.630]  and then Tamra and her husband matched it.
[00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:03.190]  So there's a $600 bounty on his head.
[00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:05.430]  He's already busted twice.
[00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:08.150]  So we love him for that. Thank you, Dave.
[00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.350]  Good luck. Not really.
[00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:14.470]  But he he ended up winning the tournament.
[00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:17.630]  So he's playing at 70 plus women.
[00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:21.150]  He wins. Crushes the competition.
[00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:25.550]  And of course, he's doing it to illustrate.
[00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:28.310]  How idiotic. This is.
[00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:32.910]  Now, is he going to win a competition having a baby?
[00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:36.310]  No. You know, in a competition
[00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:40.670]  in all the other things that women can do that men can't do? No.
[00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:43.390]  And it's just a reality.
[00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:45.630]  It's what we put men in the military.
[00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:48.510]  And then the women are the precious thing that doesn't get chewed up.
[00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:53.110]  See, there's a values on the women in a chivalrous, normal human society.
[00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:58.590]  Look at. All the other major species of mammals,
[00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:00.830]  it's the males that mainly do the defending.
[00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:03.910]  That's how we set up our species through God's program.
[00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:06.310]  But notice the woman says he's the only man here.
[00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:07.830]  No, you misgendered him.
[00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:11.190]  He is a beautiful woman who looks like Santa Claus.
[00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:14.630]  Now, let's get serious.
[00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:19.190]  Violent left wing insurrectionists invade Texas Capitol and shut down proceedings
[00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.710]  on bill banning child sex surgery.
[00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:24.310]  State police end the commotion in epic style.
[00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.750]  So in other state capitals, they let them come in, dominate,
[00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.070]  beat people up where they want the state police.
[00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:32.150]  The Texas Capitol are not playing games.
[00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:34.590]  They immediately.
[00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.230]  When they tried to take over the proceedings, arrested them.
[00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:44.070]  But again, what they did is less than what Joe Biggs and Enrique Tarrio.
[00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:48.790]  And. Others did.
[00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:52.150]  Ethan Nordin.
[00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:57.430]  Who are now facing 40 plus years in prison each for seditious
[00:44:57.430 --> 00:45:00.110]  conspiracy or terrorism against the United States of America.
[00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:02.030]  Wow.
[00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:03.470]  So when an antivirus shoots somebody in the back,
[00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.350]  they don't even get charged or burns down a building.
[00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:08.310]  But when you go protest and get in a fight with the police.
[00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:11.590]  Some of these guys even touch the police.
[00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.190]  You go to jail pretty much the rest.
[00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:17.710]  Of your life.
[00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:18.870]  Let's go ahead and roll some footage.
[00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:25.550]  The Texas state capitol yesterday, where Owen Schroer was the last two days.
[00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:26.590]  And they had the.
[00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:32.670]  Groomer groups dressed up as dinosaurs saying, I'm a lost dinosaur, kids,
[00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:35.270]  save me, help me, I mean, this is the level.
[00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:39.030]  But at least there weren't too many kids in the capital yesterday for them to do
[00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:41.910]  this to, but it's going on in the schools, it's going on in the parks,
[00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:43.950]  it's going on the television, it's going on everywhere.
[00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:44.990]  Here's the village, the footage.
[00:45:56.110 --> 00:46:01.710]  And again, this footage is the footage outside the Senate building.
[00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:04.590]  I've got photos and video here where they broke into the Senate,
[00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:05.830]  broke into the House chambers.
[00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:08.350]  Had to be drug out.
[00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:11.670]  The police drugged them out, told them to stop attacking.
[00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:13.870]  And they did not stop attacking.
[00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:14.870]  But if you go overhead shot here,
[00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:18.870]  you can see where they have broken into the House and Senate chambers.
[00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:28.070]  And had to be removed by the state police that continue to resist.
[00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:30.830]  And they got arrested, and the left is howling and
[00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:34.550]  screaming like the ultimate crime has been committed.
[00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:39.150]  They're also taking over their other parts of the building.
[00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:42.910]  And this is a law saying you cannot cut the testicles off or
[00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:45.110]  the breast off of someone until they're 17 years old.
[00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:50.830]  Because some jurisdictions around the state like Dallas and
[00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:54.550]  Austin have been taking children as young as seven or six, excuse me,
[00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:57.670]  from parents that don't agree to have them sterilized.
[00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:01.670]  Because the child told the school officials they want to be sterilized.
[00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:05.190]  So the school convinces your child to be sterilized, brainwashes them.
[00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:10.070]  And now they're setting up, quote, runaway centers for
[00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:14.790]  children so they can run away and be groomed and abused.
[00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:16.390]  Here's another report.
[00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:20.150]  California Democrats push bill to mandate gender diversity books at school.
[00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:24.110]  And the books they recommend are the very ones being pushed
[00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:29.190]  that Chelsea Clinton's pushing, like genderqueer.
[00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:33.110]  I've not shown genderqueer on air.
[00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:36.190]  But you know what, it's just too shocking.
[00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:40.350]  But you know what, Steven Crowder decided to do it yesterday when I was on with him.
[00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:43.430]  And if you guys could go into that two hour show I did with him,
[00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:47.590]  it was towards the end, because YouTube will ban you for showing that.
[00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:49.070]  They don't want you to know what they're up to.
[00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:52.910]  But find the part where he gets into genderqueer and shows the book.
[00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:54.910]  And he runs down three of the books.
[00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:58.430]  The National Library Association, we'll play that clip coming up.
[00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:02.550]  Three of the books that the National Library Association says are being banned.
[00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:03.870]  They're not being banned.
[00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:06.950]  Like guns, the Democrats are trying to ban guns, but
[00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:08.790]  guns are not banned yet in most jurisdictions.
[00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:14.630]  But who they are banned for from buying is 18 and younger.
[00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:16.830]  Your father or mother can buy you a rifle.
[00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:17.590]  They still own it.
[00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:18.510]  You use it.
[00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:19.670]  But when you're 18, it's yours.
[00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:20.350]  And I agree with that.
[00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:22.470]  Parents should be in control.
[00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:26.470]  So guns are not banned for young people.
[00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:29.070]  You just can't buy them.
[00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:30.390]  And guns are not banned for adults.
[00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:35.270]  So books are not banned, these sickening, evil, pro-pedo grooming books that don't
[00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:37.070]  show actual children being abused.
[00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:42.110]  So I guess, technically, on the first amendment, they're legal, but
[00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:45.950]  they're manuals on how to commit crime, and manuals on how to lure children, and
[00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:47.230]  manuals on how to groom.
[00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:49.070]  So I think it really is open for debate, and
[00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:54.030]  should be decided by the Supreme Court, because I'm right on the edge on this.
[00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:57.070]  I really don't think genderqueer should be a legal book.
[00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:01.590]  Telling your seven-year-old that if the neighbor wants to have sex with you in
[00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:03.150]  the shed, it's going to be great.
[00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:05.070]  Go ahead and let the adult have sex with you.
[00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:08.510]  I mean, you could end up being kidnapped, raped, I mean, whatever.
[00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:12.510]  I mean, it's literally like if I wrote a book describing
[00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:14.910]  how to attack the US Capitol and burn it down.
[00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:17.750]  I mean, I wouldn't do that, but if I was putting a book out saying,
[00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:20.750]  maybe we should do this, it's a great thing to do this, and here's how you do it.
[00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:26.870]  That's far in the theater there, but we can have a debate about that.
[00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:28.950]  Should books like genderqueer actually be banned?
[00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:31.910]  But the point is, they're not being banned.
[00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:34.710]  We're saying, don't give them to elementary and middle school students.
[00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:41.310]  I mean, it literally describes, he was showing images from the book,
[00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:43.830]  because I'll be honest, I didn't read the whole book.
[00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:46.070]  I opened it, looked at it, I looked at it for about two minutes,
[00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:49.390]  flipped through it fast, and it was so upsetting to me that they're doing this
[00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:55.350]  to children, that this had an AISD middle school sticker on the spine that
[00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:58.550]  one of our crew's children goes there and they went to the library and found it.
[00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:00.830]  It's in all the major libraries in the country, most of them.
[00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:05.670]  Leftist controlled areas, and I'll be honest, I flipped through it over about
[00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:08.070]  a minute and a half and just couldn't believe it, and
[00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:10.390]  just read the excerpts online of what's in the book.
[00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:13.830]  Well, on Crowder's show yesterday, he went ahead and showed all the images.
[00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:19.750]  And I thought, you know what, people need to see this.
[00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:21.190]  Plus, this is why it was better.
[00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:28.029]  Crowder blurted out, but it shows the child on his knees
[00:50:28.029 --> 00:50:30.350]  with the adult sticking his penis in his mouth.
[00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:34.190]  It shows the adult man with the 10-year-old raping him.
[00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:35.510]  I mean, come on, people.
[00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:38.110]  This is just, and Chelsea Clinton is promoting this.
[00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:39.390]  She's a damn monster.
[00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:43.870]  Her mother out of law school's first client was a group of men that kidnapped
[00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:47.390]  an 11-year-old girl and raped her for two days in a shack with a broomstick
[00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:50.750]  on top of their genitals until they crushed her cervix and
[00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:54.190]  destroyed her uterus, and her uterus had to be removed.
[00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:56.029]  And I've had that lady on the show.
[00:50:56.029 --> 00:50:57.310]  It's on record this happened.
[00:50:57.310 --> 00:50:59.670]  There's an audio tape of Hillary laughing, saying she thought it was funny.
[00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:04.910]  So I know this is hard to believe, and if you guys can't find it now,
[00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:05.870]  it was in the two-hour show.
[00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:07.390]  It's on Rumble, the archive of it.
[00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:10.630]  If you can't find the Steven Crowder part, we covered this for five minutes,
[00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:11.710]  it's fine.
[00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:15.029]  Get it later and have the crew add it and post.
[00:51:15.029 --> 00:51:17.350]  And when this is posted to Man.Video, it'll be there.
[00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:19.430]  You know, that's a little known secret.
[00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:21.070]  Not really secret, but people don't know it.
[00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:26.029]  The archive of the four-hour show every day that's posted to Man.Video
[00:51:26.029 --> 00:51:29.350]  has a bunch of clips that we didn't get to get to that are added into it.
[00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:31.790]  So that way the TV viewers won't see it, if you don't want to see it,
[00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:33.230]  or any listeners want to hear about it.
[00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:37.310]  But if you want to go see it, take that five, ten-minute segment where
[00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:41.190]  Crowder talked about this and showed it, because he needed to work with his crew
[00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:45.790]  to blur it all out, so you can see it for yourself but not get the full image
[00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:51.150]  of a man bending your 11-year-old son over in a shed and raping him in the rear end.
[00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:55.710]  But we go back to this.
[00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:59.510]  California Democrats push Bill to mandate gender diversity in books
[00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:02.070]  and schools, including genderqueer.
[00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:07.470]  So they want elementary students to learn about how fun it is if a man approaches
[00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:11.950]  you and says, I want to pleasure you, go with that man, you're going to love it.
[00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:16.670]  It actually teaches them to be kidnapped, to be groomed, and to be raped.
[00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:21.710]  But according to the UN, it is their right at age seven to be raped,
[00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:23.470]  because it's not right.
[00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:27.190]  California passed a bill that says 12-year-olds can be given poison shots
[00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:30.230]  without parental consent or have abortions.
[00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:31.750]  I want to play this video.
[00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:33.630]  I think you guys have this.
[00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:34.590]  We have this video.
[00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:39.790]  Protester shouts, you mutilated your son, at former NBA star Dwayne Wade following
[00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:44.070]  15-year-old son's gender transition.
[00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:45.510]  We have it.
[00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:50.590]  Former Miami Heat NBA star Dwayne Wade was booed and criticized over 15-year-old
[00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:54.390]  son's gender transition as he left a basketball game in New York City Sunday
[00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.870]  night.
[00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:56.950]  All I can say is, good job.
[00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:59.750]  Cutting your son's penis off is not a good thing.
[00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:00.990]  Here it is.
[00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:21.630]  Protester shouts, you mutilated your son, at former NBA star Dwayne Wade.
[00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:22.510]  There you go.
[00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:23.350]  Now, let's move on to this.
[00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:24.750]  We've got video of this.
[00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:25.630]  There's so many clips, though.
[00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:26.230]  I don't know.
[00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.990]  The crew is so good.
[00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:28.270]  Like, every time I go, do we have this clip?
[00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:29.350]  They're like, yeah, we got it.
[00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:33.590]  Do we have the pedosaur or the transaur?
[00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:35.110]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:40.990]  Transdinosaur used to attract children to sexual perversion confronted by protesters
[00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:42.790]  and reporters at Texas Capitol.
[00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:49.990]  It says, LGBT Rex loves you, and then it's a lost dinosaur that wants to talk to kids.
[00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:56.590]  Owen Schroer and Alex Springer, who's an expert in stopping child predator groups,
[00:53:56.630 --> 00:54:01.430]  are on the scene at Texas Capitol to document a gathering of pro-child mutilation cult.
[00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:07.710]  They expected the usual opposition, but they certainly did not expect to meet the LGBT
[00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:10.830]  Rex roaming the halls holding a strange sign.
[00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:13.110]  See the full video on Infowars.com.
[00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:15.870]  It deserves to be seen, deserves to be shared.
[00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:20.070]  Only you can resist the new world order.
[00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:22.310]  Here's another clip.
[00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:26.190]  Watch as audience cheers high school student as she confronts school board
[00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:30.190]  on trans insanity.
[00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:38.470]  We are affirming the mental confusion of a boy and putting the safety of women in jeopardy
[00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:48.070]  by allowing mentally confused men to use women's spaces.
[00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:51.710]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip for the viewers.
[00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:56.710]  Hello ladies and gentlemen, and only ladies and gentlemen it is and shall always be.
[00:54:56.710 --> 00:55:00.630]  I am an 18-year-old high school student and wanted to take this time to bring to your
[00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:06.150]  attention the current issue with biological men claiming they are women and in turn truly
[00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:09.670]  believing that they are entitled to use women's spaces.
[00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:13.430]  There was an incident within our district that occurred recently regarding a transgender
[00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:19.390]  woman who really is a biological man having an altercation with a young woman at MLK High
[00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:20.390]  School.
[00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:24.190]  I was infuriating when I had seen the video on social media, but what was detrimental
[00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:28.230]  to this is the fact that this man is and has been using the women's restroom and locker
[00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:29.230]  room.
[00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:33.550]  Firstly, the question we must address is why are we affirming the mental confusion of this
[00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:39.830]  boy and putting the safety of women in jeopardy by allowing mentally confused men to use the
[00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:40.830]  women's spaces?
[00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:45.790]  Of course, any male who claims he is a woman will accept it, but what about the women?
[00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:50.029]  What about the true girls like myself who are female down to our DNA?
[00:55:50.029 --> 00:55:53.150]  Why don't we ever get a say in whether or not we are comfortable with this?
[00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:54.790]  The truth is, we aren't.
[00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:58.790]  The majority of us aren't, and yet nothing has been done to protect the safety of these
[00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:59.790]  women.
[00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:00.790]  I will conclude with this.
[00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:02.150]  It all starts with you.
[00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:08.670]  You are in charge of the safety of us women and the kids of our parents, so please do
[00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:09.950]  something about it.
[00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:10.950]  Thank you.
[00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:15.750]  And I love that man right there in the corner who has a shirt that says, hold fast.
[00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:22.110]  That means just hold on and never submit and never rolled over and never give in.
[00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:24.550]  And that's really what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:26.870]  This is a total satanic assault.
[00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:30.150]  Let me give you some good news, though.
[00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:36.310]  Fox News lost 52% of their total viewers in the last week.
[00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:38.070]  That's never happened.
[00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:41.150]  Some shows lost 70 plus percent.
[00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:45.590]  Not even Bud Light lost this much ratings.
[00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:47.950]  Not even Bud Light lost this much.
[00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:56.150]  Ratings showcase the new normal for Fox News without Tucker, 52% of the viewers gone.
[00:56:56.150 --> 00:57:00.270]  Big articles up on Infowars.com detailing it all.
[00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:05.350]  It is so incredibly important, and I haven't gotten to it yet.
[00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:11.110]  After our next guest joins us from the Darien Gap, Central America, he'll be on with us
[00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:12.710]  for three segments.
[00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:15.830]  I will get into the AI and the danger of it.
[00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:18.950]  I just experienced it yesterday.
[00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:25.029]  Get a call yesterday afternoon, says Tucker Carlson on my phone, spoofing the number.
[00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:26.029]  I leave the meeting.
[00:57:26.029 --> 00:57:29.190]  Hey, Tucker, what's up?
[00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:34.590]  And the so-called Tucker Carlson robot begins to say sexually vile things to me.
[00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:35.590]  And I'm listening.
[00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:36.590]  And it's Tucker's voice.
[00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:37.590]  I go, oh, this is AI.
[00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:38.590]  This is a setup.
[00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:39.590]  And it was, and it's confirmed.
[00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:42.590]  The guy that did it says he's going to air it on Monday.
[00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:45.150]  Wait, wait, wait till you hear what happened.
[00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:46.150]  That's coming up next hour as well.
[00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.650]  Stay with us.
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:54.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:56.419]  in plain view.
[00:57:56.419 --> 00:57:59.180]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:03.459]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[00:58:03.459 --> 00:58:08.700]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:15.979]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[00:58:15.979 --> 00:58:22.299]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:58:22.299 --> 00:58:28.459]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive
[00:58:28.459 --> 00:58:32.379]  disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:58:32.379 --> 00:58:34.620]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:40.140]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:42.459]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:58:42.939 --> 00:58:46.140]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:47.580]  X3, back in stock.
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:48.580]  Take action now.
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:49.580]  InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:53.180]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:58:57.979 --> 00:59:01.100]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:04.779]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[00:59:04.779 --> 00:59:07.899]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:59:07.899 --> 00:59:12.060]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up, or rub it down.
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:14.299]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:59:14.299 --> 00:59:17.819]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:59:17.819 --> 00:59:21.500]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:25.339]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[00:59:25.339 --> 00:59:28.459]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:32.060]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:34.540]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.660]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:42.379]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:57.100]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:12.220]  They're all contributing to organized crime by paying large sums of money to be brought in here.
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:16.299]  And to give you an example, the Chinese are paying $50,000.
[01:00:16.299 --> 01:00:18.939]  The Indians are paying $10,000 to $20,000.
[01:00:18.939 --> 01:00:22.299]  All the Central Americans, the average is about $7,000.
[01:00:22.299 --> 01:00:27.500]  So, and the Mexicans, especially Southern Mexico, are paying $3,000.
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:36.060]  So, it's a huge, huge money event for the cartels, probably even more lucrative than the drug business.
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:40.299]  As we talk to some of these asylum seekers, they're waiting for May 11th.
[01:00:40.299 --> 01:00:42.779]  May 11th, they believe, will be the day that they become,
[01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:46.459]  without any documentation, they can come into the United States.
[01:00:46.459 --> 01:00:52.060]  Back in 2019, South Texas Border Volunteers founder Dr. Michael Vickers
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:57.339]  had already declared the invasion of his property and neighboring properties a war.
[01:00:57.339 --> 01:01:01.259]  Four years later, the situation has become an apocalypse.
[01:01:01.259 --> 01:01:02.779]  How have things escalated?
[01:01:02.779 --> 01:01:04.700]  Oh, it's unbelievable.
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.819]  What's happened, the groups have gotten bigger.
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:19.580]  The people are coming from more countries now, from Africa, from China, from all over the planet.
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:23.899]  And their disposition has changed.
[01:01:23.899 --> 01:01:25.020]  They're more combative.
[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:31.580]  And when we encounter them, they want to put up a fight.
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:34.459]  And they're being led by gang members.
[01:01:34.459 --> 01:01:37.580]  We're seeing a lot of repeat people coming in.
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.259]  They can't give up for amnesty.
[01:01:39.259 --> 01:01:41.180]  They've been previously deported.
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:45.500]  They've got criminal records from the countries they come from or from here.
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:48.060]  And those are the type of people that we're encountering now.
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:53.180]  One of our operations a year or two ago, there were 24 Guatemalans in it.
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:58.939]  They cut the gate on the pipeline 10 miles off the highway, and there were probably 24 in it.
[01:01:58.939 --> 01:02:02.540]  We were able to get air support, get the border patrol in there to get them apprehended.
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.379]  We had a guy with a rifle leading a group of 33 Chinese.
[01:02:08.379 --> 01:02:11.100]  And our guys stepped out from here to there.
[01:02:11.899 --> 01:02:13.180]  They were right on the trail.
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:14.779]  The guy almost ran over them.
[01:02:14.779 --> 01:02:16.299]  We got the drop on him.
[01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:18.859]  He ran over two of them, jumped in the fence, took off.
[01:02:18.859 --> 01:02:20.299]  We never caught him.
[01:02:20.299 --> 01:02:23.979]  But we were able to get 29 of them caught that night, all Chinese.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:27.660]  And all of them at that time were paying $40,000 to $50,000.
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.500]  Do they speak English really well?
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.100]  We had one group of 16.
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:33.259]  There were three girls in there from China.
[01:02:33.259 --> 01:02:34.939]  All the rest were Middle East.
[01:02:34.939 --> 01:02:37.500]  And they spoke perfect English.
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:43.740]  Horrific personal stories like that of Texas Gulf Coast War on Fentanyl founder Sarah Chittum
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:49.740]  should serve as a wake-up call to the exponential tragedies many more Americans will face.
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:57.500]  As a mom who lost her only biological son, I often wondered, what is my purpose now?
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.220]  He was in and out of trouble quite a bit.
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:03.180]  And I was the epitome of a tough-loved mother.
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:07.339]  So at about age 19, he ended up getting kicked out of my home.
[01:03:08.299 --> 01:03:10.859]  He went to live with a childhood friend.
[01:03:10.859 --> 01:03:14.939]  And during that time, a home invasion occurred.
[01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:20.779]  The people that broke into the home did not realize that my son was home.
[01:03:21.419 --> 01:03:25.180]  And the man put my son in a headlock and told the girlfriend to shoot him.
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:30.379]  The girlfriend opened fire on my son and emptied her entire clip into him.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:37.500]  My son had to spend over a month in ICU during COVID where he could have no visitors,
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:43.740]  meaning during the most painful, shattered time in his life, I couldn't be there.
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:48.379]  And when he got out of the hospital, he feared.
[01:03:49.019 --> 01:03:50.299]  He feared for his life.
[01:03:51.019 --> 01:03:53.660]  Seth had never received justice for being shot.
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:57.580]  And he feared that the couple would come after him to finish the job.
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:00.620]  I'm sure he wanted just a little bit of mental relief.
[01:04:01.259 --> 01:04:04.460]  So he bought a pill from somebody he called family.
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.580]  That means to me that he trusted this guy.
[01:04:08.859 --> 01:04:12.540]  Unfortunately, that pill contained a lethal dose of illicit fentanyl.
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:13.979]  And it took my son's life.
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:20.939]  If you ask me, I agree that this needs to be declared a weapon of mass destruction.
[01:04:21.899 --> 01:04:27.580]  Meanwhile, the Houston division of the FBI admits to posting the wrong photo
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:32.859]  and incorrect spelling of Texas mass murderer Francisco Uripeza,
[01:04:32.859 --> 01:04:37.819]  while Texas Governor Abbott is propagandized for stating the obvious.
[01:04:37.819 --> 01:04:41.979]  Critics are outraged that the governor brought up immigration status at all in this case.
[01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:48.220]  As the globalists continue their assault on the interior of the United States unobstructed.
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:56.700]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:04.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.600]  in plain view.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.360]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:13.640]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:18.880]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.

[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:10.800]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:17.920]  Well, he's a former special operations legend and a legend going back decades and decades
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:22.040]  as investigative journalist around the world.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:26.640]  He is more popular and more informative than ever, Michael Yon.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:33.360]  Michael underscore Yon on Twitter, Y-O-N, and MichaelYon.locals.com.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.600]  He's an American writer and photographer.
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:39.520]  He served in special forces in the early 1980s and he became a writer in the 1990s, focused
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.200]  on military writing after the invasion of Iraq.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.240]  Yon is also embedded on numerous occasions with American and British troops in Iraq,
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:50.440]  most prominently the deployment of the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment, Deuce Force,
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:55.720]  and the 25th Infantry Division in Mosul, Iraq, that entered in September 2005.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.080]  Yon has vocal views of the United States military hierarchy.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.280]  The nature of his reports is also controversial.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:05.980]  However, Yon at one time enjoyed rock star status among the individual soldiers, according
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.240]  to NBC News.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:13.840]  So Michael Yon joins us about the Darien Gap on the border of Colombia and Panama.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:17.440]  And thanks to his reporting that they even admit it, Mayorkas claims they're shutting
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.440]  it down.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.520]  But is that really happening?
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:25.440]  So the invasion point, the UN camps, the takeover of America, the replacement migration.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.000]  What is Governor Abbott really doing?
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.040]  Is he good or is he bad?
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:34.200]  He has gotten to a local area right outside the jungle there that does have uplinks.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.200]  There's almost no internet there.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.880]  We appreciate him hiking dozens of miles today just to be on with us and try to give him
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:44.680]  the floor for the 45 minutes we have with him to cover the historic developments.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.280]  So Michael, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.400]  Yeah, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:53.720]  I'm at the edge of the Darien Gap now near San Vicente camp.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.920]  And actually, here comes migrant to me now.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.840]  And also and right behind me are two Chinese.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:03.720]  There's at least six staying in this hotel that's right next to a camp.
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.960]  So they actually make it to the Darien Gap.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:09.080]  The lady in the black is sitting down and the man in the white.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:14.760]  They have a they're speaking Mandarin, but they have an accent from northern China.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.000]  And they won't talk with me.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.360]  But and they're quite rude and aggressive, as many Chinese tend to be.
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:21.880]  But this is it.
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:22.440]  Let me show you.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:31.160]  This is the camp, San Vicente camp, where one of the Darien Gap camps where we have about
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:35.400]  30 to 40 huge buses going through per day.
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.160]  This is Highway 1 right here, Alex.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.640]  This is Highway 1 that goes all the way to Alaska.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.440]  So they come out on this highway, Highway 1.
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:47.080]  And and they go to Costa Rica.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.160]  So this is where the buses line up right here.
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.360]  They line up.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:55.000]  So the videos you've seen before of me, you know, the buses at night time and daytime.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.200]  This is where they line up.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.960]  This is San Vicente camp.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:02.520]  This is the camp that Mayorkas has more than doubled in size.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.440]  Actually, he came here.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.920]  I see the migrants, aliens lining up.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.320]  Be coming soon.
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.640]  You'll probably see them because we'll be on for a while.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:11.960]  Yeah.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.320]  So this is what happens, Alex.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.560]  Every day, 30 to 40 buses.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.520]  These buses fit.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:18.120]  That's a Pinagua.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.440]  I made that video down inside the Darien Gap.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.240]  And actually, that's a Venezuelan.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.840]  I made that video as well.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:25.160]  Yeah.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:30.120]  And so, you know, as you know, for the last, well, since Biden was installed.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.560]  Oh, actually, where that bus is right now, that's where I'm standing, actually.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.360]  So this is where they they line up every night and day.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:40.040]  And they just head all the way up the coast to the border of Costa Rica.
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.520]  And there they cross over into Costa Rica and keep going.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.880]  That's that video.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.600]  I made that as well.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.720]  That's Bajo Chiquito.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:50.200]  And so, yeah, Alex, this is a full fledged invasion.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.800]  There's a huge amount of violence out here.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.000]  A lot of it's actually from the aliens themselves.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.120]  And and and they're becoming increasingly aggressive.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:04.520]  I saw your previous guest talking about it, how aggressive they're becoming.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.760]  It's it's unbelievably true.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:07.960]  In fact, here comes Chinese.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.360]  Now they'll be coming out of the hotel.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:14.680]  So yeah, so they just came through the Darien Gap and they often the Chinese in particular
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:16.600]  will be walking down Highway one at night.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.840]  I mean, I don't want to put you in a bad position, but you're a tough guy.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.680]  Do you mind going over and talking to him for us?
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:23.160]  Oh, we'll try.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:23.880]  Usually they won't.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.720]  The Chinese generally won't.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.080]  Every once in a while they will.
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:27.640]  We'll try.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.040]  But these guys already tried earlier.
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:33.160]  Well, you've got to be proud of your work down there off and on for years.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.560]  And now it's the Darien Gap getting a lot of attention.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.120]  So congratulations to you and Jordan Peterson.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.080]  I know having you on about it.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:44.840]  Yeah, Jordan, Jordan's been asking for updates down here for quite a while.
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.040]  Yeah.
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:46.840]  Are you from China?
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.280]  From China?
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.360]  Tina, you speak English?
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:52.620]  Huh?
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.280]  A little.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.120]  Can you talk with these people?
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.080]  Here, put this in.
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.160]  You speak some English, put it in.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.440]  Oh, good.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.480]  Where are you from in China?
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.140]  Hola.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.200]  Where are you from in China?
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:09.560]  Alex, go ahead.
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.640]  Sir, how far did you travel?
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.520]  Did you come from China?
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.240]  Can you hear him, Alex?
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.040]  Yes.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.400]  So you come from China.
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:22.280]  How did you get here?
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.480]  Did you go through Quito?
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.080]  How did you get to here?
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:25.580]  Yeah.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:26.840]  Quito?
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.340]  Yeah.
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.000]  And how much did it cost?
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:32.840]  How much money?
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:33.980]  How much?
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:41.400]  $400?
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:42.280]  Yeah.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:46.440]  How much did it cost to get from China to Quito, Ecuador?
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:53.240]  I don't know.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:58.120]  Maybe $2,000.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.320]  $2,000 to Quito from China?
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:01.960]  Yeah.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.400]  Where are you from in China?
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.320]  Where in China?
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.720]  Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu?
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:11.080]  Yeah.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:11.640]  Fujian.
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:12.680]  Oh, you speak Fujian.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:13.880]  Yeah.
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:14.920]  You speak Cantonese?
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:16.280]  Cantonese?
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.720]  Fujian.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.520]  Okay.
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.800]  It's from Fujian.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:20.200]  Fujian.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.160]  Oh, okay.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:27.720]  Ask him, sir.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.080]  How did you get a passport?
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.040]  How did you get a passport?
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.320]  And where are you going?
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.040]  Where's your final destination?
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.640]  Where will you go?
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.240]  Where will you go?
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:42.780]  Yeah.
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.320]  Can people talk to me?
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.840]  We can.
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:16.840]  Where will you go in America?
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.840]  Where?
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:32.360]  What does he think?
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.240]  Why is he coming to America?
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:37.400]  What?
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.840]  Why will you go to America?
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:45.640]  China.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.120]  COVID-19.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.040]  COVID-19.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.840]  Yeah.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:11.080]  So he wants to live in a better country and make money,
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.200]  which I really can't blame him for doing.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.200]  Ask him why he didn't try to come legally.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.080]  Why did you not come legally?
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.040]  Why not fly to Los Angeles or New York?
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:37.240]  I don't know.
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:37.720]  What's that?
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.120]  It's difficult.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:48.040]  It will only be five days.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.000]  Anything, anything.
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.280]  No, just for the dollar.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.520]  He's saying his money's worthless in China.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.560]  So ask him this.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:00.300]  Yes.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:06.120]  Ask him what it was like during the lockdowns, the COVID lockdowns.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.320]  What was that like in China?
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:13.320]  During COVID-19, how were conditions in Fujian?
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:14.620]  Working.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:17.240]  COVID-19 lockdown.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.080]  What was it like?
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:29.640]  Three years ago, I have a company, and we were working for the recycle.
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:31.640]  Recycle.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:37.960]  We were working for the recycle.
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:40.440]  Recycle.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:16:00.520]  Because of the COVID-19, the government paid my company money.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:06.600]  So we have a lot of money.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.040]  Yeah, that's what I was guessing.
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:12.040]  So he's basically a refugee from the lockdowns.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.320]  That's what I was thinking, Michael.
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:16.520]  Ask him that, and he can cover whatever he wants.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:17.480]  This was important, though.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:17.980]  Thank you.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:20.520]  How did you get a passport?
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:22.920]  Passport.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.800]  Your passport.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:24.760]  Chinese passport.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.600]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.200]  When did you get the passport?
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:32.700]  When?
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:38.840]  Six years ago.
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:44.040]  Yeah, five, six years ago.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:48.520]  I never bring to anywhere, anywhere.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.880]  So I get the passport just for the travel.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:58.760]  Now, in China, passport is no.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:06.040]  Well, it's very interesting to see that he knows English.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.040]  Ask him where he learned English.
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.920]  Where did you learn English?
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:15.560]  In my high school and college.
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.840]  Yeah, maybe 10 years ago.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:20.600]  Nine years ago.
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.160]  From high school?
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:27.660]  Yeah.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.040]  So he's 27 years old.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:32.440]  How old are you?
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:35.400]  You're 33?
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:36.760]  Okay.
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:37.260]  Yes.
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.480]  All right, well, Michael, unless you've got more questions, that's good.
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:45.560]  Thank you.
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.360]  Thank you.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.800]  Thank you for the time.
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:49.480]  Enjoy your lunch.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:53.800]  Now, you may have asked better questions, but did I ask okay questions, Michael?
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:55.480]  Of course.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.200]  Of course.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:57.880]  I spend months of the time down here.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:01.400]  So for me, it's like a daily thing in the jungles.
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:05.320]  Actually, the best time to question, Alex, is always at nighttime.
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.240]  And it's alone out in the jungles.
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.160]  That's when people just open up.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:09.640]  That's true.
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:15.960]  Every country I go to at nighttime and especially when it's just one or two people.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.400]  It's very interesting.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.560]  Even like U.S. Border Patrol, if you go at nighttime, the Border Patrol people just tell
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.440]  you everything.
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.360]  It's true in every country I go to.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.280]  Why do you think that is?
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.440]  I think people just feel more comfortable to talk at night.
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.720]  For instance, when I was in Hong Kong, before I got kicked out of there, I was there for
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.640]  the fighting for seven months.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:39.560]  And the police, of course, during the daytime, the police don't want to talk.
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.240]  And if they're in a large group, they don't want to talk.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.920]  But at nighttime, if you go to the edges, most of the Hong Kong police will just start
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:47.480]  talking.
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:50.760]  Don't you think that's an epigenetic issue that humans are meant to talk at night around
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:51.320]  the campfire?
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.200]  I've wondered that, Alex.
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:59.400]  Our minds think very similarly because it's definitely better at nighttime.
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:03.240]  That's why often I'll sleep during the day and I stay out all night talking with people.
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:06.040]  And I would do the same in the wars with U.S. soldiers.
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:09.880]  I would stay on guard duty with them at nighttime, that sort of thing, and just tell you everything
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:10.520]  that's going on.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.280]  You can learn a lot more from the ground troops than you can from the generals.
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:15.640]  All right.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:16.120]  Stay there.
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:16.840]  You're amazing.
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:17.480]  I want to give you the floor.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.280]  We come back.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.120]  You've been down there off and on for years.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.080]  We're not kissing your ass.
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:21.800]  It's true.
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.400]  I think you recognize you're the guy that brought the Darien Gap out.
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.920]  You've been everywhere warning about it.
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.600]  Suddenly, it's all over the news.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.040]  That's got to be a little bit satisfying.
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:33.480]  Yes, in a sense.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:37.240]  But it's like satisfying in the way I told you not to play with fire.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:41.160]  And there's a specific reason I come here, because this is a main artery for the rest
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:42.840]  of the world to come through Darien Gap.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.240]  And now it's coming true.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.160]  And it's destroying this jungle.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.600]  And it's destroying the people.
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.680]  Malaria is going through the roof.
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:57.960]  In fact, one of my Indian chief friends, he's a mayor of 29 Imbran Indian villages.
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.800]  His name is Francisco Agape.
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:03.960]  Francisco told me malaria is just spreading through the Indians like crazy.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.880]  Michael, stay there.
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.440]  We skipped this network break, but some stations don't.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.640]  So we're going to rejoin stations.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:10.600]  All right.
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.520]  Michael Yon is with us right now.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.400]  Try to give him the floor during this 10-minute segment.
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:20.040]  Give us a report on what the Darien Gap is, the 35,000-foot view, then the local view
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:26.600]  on the desperate situation there with the UN running these camps and the intel you sent us.
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:27.240]  Michael Yon.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:29.960]  Oh, yeah.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.880]  Actually, the Red Cross is right behind me.
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:33.080]  We can go talk with them.
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.560]  They're the ones handing out the maps.
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:39.560]  Remember those big maps that I sent you that shows you how to get through Central America
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.320]  and Mexico up to the United States?
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:44.360]  That's the people handing them out behind me back over there.
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:47.400]  And so the Red Cross are actually handing out those maps.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.680]  Yeah, actually, this is a map that Matt Bracken drew.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:56.360]  And I took Matt Bracken down here, by the way, the former Navy SEAL officer.
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.360]  And I took him deep into the jungle, man.
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:59.480]  He's a go-getter.
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:05.640]  But I like the way Matt drew that out because he shows the two hourglasses.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:10.360]  There's the 5% of world trade goes to the Panama Canal.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:14.440]  And then a huge part of the world population can go to the Darien Gap.
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:18.600]  And so that's the reason that anywhere I go, Alex, is a good place to watch.
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:23.080]  For instance, I'll be in Texas next week or I'll be in Texas in probably three days.
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.960]  And because you know what's happening with Title 42.
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:28.200]  But also, I go to places like Netherlands.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:31.480]  Netherlands is another key point in this global war.
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:35.240]  And also, I was just on Ishigaki Island in Japan a few weeks ago.
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:37.160]  Another key point in this war.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.440]  So I'm going from these key places to key places.
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:45.320]  And Panama, where I'm sitting now, is one of the most strategic places on earth.
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:49.000]  And so these NGOs, they eat here.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.120]  They have lunch here.
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:56.840]  The Red Cross and OIM and UNICEF and Norwegian Refugee Council.
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:00.040]  Highest, they all eat lunch at this restaurant.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.320]  That's why I'm here, you know.
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.880]  So that's the 35,000 foot view.
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.560]  Explain what Title 42 means.
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.720]  Biden's obviously sending 1,500 troops.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:09.800]  Not to stop it, but to facilitate it.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:13.000]  Explain how the UN dissolving the borders, the refugee centers.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:13.800]  Title 42.
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.080]  Biden says surge the border.
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:19.400]  The press secretary claiming immigration is down 90 percent.
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.200]  Huge lie.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:25.560]  Give us a 35,000 foot replacement migration battle plan.
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:28.760]  Why the State Department's handing out the map we're showing on screen that you got.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:29.640]  Telling them how to invade.
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:31.800]  That's funny.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:35.240]  That's the Red Cross map that the people behind me hand out, actually.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:39.800]  And they tried to cut off the bottom where it shows that it came from Red Cross
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.360]  a couple of weeks ago when I got that map.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:47.160]  But yeah, you know, Title 42 is supposed to be an anti-COVID measure, right?
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.320]  But it's nonsense.
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:54.760]  For instance, the pandemic or the diseases that are going up this highway,
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:56.360]  Highway 1 here to my left.
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:00.360]  For instance, MDR-TB, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:04.920]  All the serious doctors out there know exactly how dangerous tuberculosis is.
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:07.880]  Tuberculosis is one of the ultimate pandemics.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.840]  I mean, it makes Spanish flu look like a child.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:14.280]  I mean, tuberculosis is up there with yellow fever.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:17.480]  It's up there with smallpox and black death.
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.920]  Tuberculosis is a man-sized pandemic, right?
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:24.680]  And for people that don't know, some types are incurable.
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:29.240]  Yeah, the MDR, the multi-drug resistant tuberculosis,
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:33.480]  is known to be going up this highway every single day on these buses.
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:36.600]  Buses filled with people from 140 different countries.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.560]  And they ride all the way up and all the way to the United States.
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:42.760]  And again, there's a lot of diseases that are breaking out here now
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.680]  that weren't prevalent here before.
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:47.880]  Malaria has always been here, but it's not been as bad as it is now.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:51.000]  Now it's like the Indians are getting malaria like crazy.
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:55.320]  Right where I'm sitting at right now, about two or three weeks ago,
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:00.040]  some of the local Panamanian men were very angry.
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:00.840]  There were six of them.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:04.120]  And they were having a meeting on how to shut this stuff down.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:06.600]  Because their people are getting sick.
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:07.320]  Well, let's explain.
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:11.480]  All the new bugs coming in lowers the immune systems of the natives.
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.960]  And then something that was already dangerous, it was more dangerous.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:16.840]  We all know the majority of Native Americans were wiped out by smallpox.
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.360]  So this open border issue is no joke.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:20.920]  Explain that.
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.160]  Tuberculosis is like super no joke.
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:31.880]  And not only that, but the varying gap here is also a front line against screwworms,
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.800]  which you may have never heard of screwworms before.
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:36.920]  I think I mentioned them to you, Alex, the last time we met in your studio.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:39.800]  Screwworms are spread by a fly.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:44.040]  They are a flesh eating fly that got eradicated in the 60s in Texas.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:45.720]  We eradicated here.
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:46.280]  People don't know.
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:47.080]  Explain it.
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:47.720]  It's coming back.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:49.560]  Oh, yeah.
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:53.320]  And so that was back when the USDA actually did its job.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:56.280]  And they pushed it down like a war on these flies.
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:59.560]  And now the varying gap, which is why I'm on the edge of it right now.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:07.160]  The United States government has a facility in Panama, about an hour flight for me here.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:11.240]  And they irradiate millions of flies, male flies every month.
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:14.840]  And they spray them out with sort of like crop dusters over the varying gap.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:17.320]  And the females only mate once in their life.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:20.600]  And so if they mate with the irradiated, sterilized flies,
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:23.400]  then that keeps the population down.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:27.240]  And I interrupted you, but you were trying to explain what a screwfly does.
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.280]  They don't eat dead meat.
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:29.160]  They eat live meat.
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:37.160]  Cows walking around being eaten alive and sheep and dogs and everything else.
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:41.880]  Now, we haven't heard of it because our grandparents were very smart and fought it down
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:44.520]  to this line of scrimmage down here, the varying gap.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:50.200]  This varying gap is important for many reasons besides just being an hourglass to the world,
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:51.560]  to the United States.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:57.800]  It's also, well, I mean, right now, there's trails all through the varying gap.
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:00.840]  There's definitely going to be eventually a road built through there.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:05.960]  And that means everybody and their grandparents can just come through on highways.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.320]  And that's clearly what's coming.
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:12.680]  And also, as you know, Mayorkas was just down here with the South Com commander and also
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.600]  the worthless U.S. ambassador.
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:17.960]  And what they're talking about now, or not just talking about, they're executing.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:18.920]  They're going to do.
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:24.680]  They're going to do flights directly from Colombia and directly from Guatemala to the
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.320]  United States.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.520]  They're just going to be flying them in.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:29.240]  They're already doing that, but they're going to increase the level.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:36.920]  And we saw the presidents Bush, Obama and Clinton all talking about what, 10 days ago
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:37.560]  or so now.
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:43.160]  And they were talking about how they're working with American Express and others to fund getting
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:48.200]  these aliens on airplanes so they can just fly directly to places like Kansas.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.680]  They're just going to bypass the Texas border, right?
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:51.000]  Yeah.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:51.640]  Explain that.
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:54.760]  When he puts 1,500 troops on there, they are just to facilitate.
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:56.680]  The border patrols even admitted that.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:00.600]  Not like Trump, who actually used them to use Title 42 to send them back across.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:02.360]  Yeah.
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.000]  And what are 1,500 troops going to do, even if they're the best troops we've got, who
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.880]  have instructions to interrupt the flow?
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:10.440]  Nothing.
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:15.000]  I've seen it when we had 150,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.360]  And what did they do?
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:17.960]  They lost the war, right?
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:18.520]  I was there.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:21.960]  I was in Iraq two years and I was in Afghanistan two years, four years.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:24.440]  150,000 troops is nothing.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.200]  And they're only sending 1,500.
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:30.120]  And those 1,500 are there to facilitate our own invasion.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.720]  This is suicide by government.
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:34.600]  I call it OGUS, the Occupational Government of the United States.
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:39.000]  It's clearly that they're destroying our economy.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.200]  We can see that.
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:42.280]  We see the U.S. dollar is collapsing.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:45.720]  We see China is taking over, slowly but surely, Panama.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:49.240]  You know, they got a Confucius Institute downtown at the University of Panama.
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.680]  I was just there a couple of weeks ago.
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:52.360]  You know, what they do at the Confucius Institute.
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:57.320]  I've told people, I've been attacking Confucius Institute since 2014.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:58.680]  That's when I started going after them.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:04.360]  But Confucius Institute, they set up these classrooms in universities like Harvard and
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:05.320]  these sorts of things.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:07.080]  They pay money to the university.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:11.000]  They have their own teachers come in and they say, you know, you've got to have Mandarin
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.040]  instruction and know China because China is the future, that sort of thing.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:17.560]  But what they're actually doing is they're recruiting the elite children.
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.080]  They're getting them scholarships.
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.400]  And they go over to China and they're recruited.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:21.880]  They get them.
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:25.560]  They do the normal mice thing, you know, the mice thing that we've talked about before,
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.480]  money, ideology, coercion, ego.
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.160]  That's how you recruit spies, right?
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.920]  Mice, mousetrap, right?
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.600]  And so, you know, they get them on the videos.
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.600]  They get, you know, they recruit them.
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.200]  They groom them and that sort of thing.
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:38.920]  There's a great FBI counterintelligence film.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:41.800]  You can find it on YouTube called Game of Pawns.
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:42.920]  Game of Pawns.
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:46.760]  Any young people that are watching this or if you have young people in your family that
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:50.040]  were offered a scholarship to China, do not go.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:50.920]  Don't do it.
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:51.320]  Right.
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:54.040]  Look, look, stay right there.
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:54.760]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:55.720]  Amazing.
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:03.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:04.360]  in plain view.
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:07.160]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:12.280]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:17.400]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:24.760]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:30.920]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:36.840]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:40.840]  cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.360]  Most iodine is bound to other elements.
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:43.240]  You don't absorb it.
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:48.840]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:51.560]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:54.920]  It's being sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.280]  X3 back in stock.
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:57.320]  Take action now.
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:58.520]  InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:04.840]  It will change your life.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:10.040]  The UN admits and the Lancet medical journal admits that upwards of two billion people
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:14.200]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:19.480]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:25.160]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:31.800]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells and InfoWarsTore.com has the
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:36.680]  only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:39.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:43.160]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:45.640]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.880]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:49.240]  You and your family need it.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.400]  It's 25% off back in stock.

[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.200]  That's great and I thank you, but we need funds to operate.

[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:44.600]  Plus, all of these are really great products.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:45.560]  They keep us on air.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:47.320]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:52.760]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to InfoWarsTore.com right

[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:07.640]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:11.640]  caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:14.520]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:18.680]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsTore.com like books and films and

[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:57.240]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:58.040]  Please take action.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:07.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:13.390]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:17.390]  Our enemies creep around.
[01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:18.390]  They use covert war.
[01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:22.390]  We use truth, justice, and history against the enemy.
[01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:27.390]  Vital Jan is an incredibly famous soldier, special forces operator, even more famous
[01:33:27.390 --> 01:33:30.390]  on the ground, investigative journalist of the highest caliber.
[01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:32.390]  We're very honored to have him on the show.
[01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:36.390]  Even more famous on the ground, investigative journalist of the highest caliber.
[01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:38.390]  We're very honored to have him.
[01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:42.390]  Right here, he sent me a photo that's on his Twitter.
[01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:45.390]  Mass migration brought to you by the sponsors.
[01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:49.390]  UNICEF, that's the UN, the State Department, and the EU.
[01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:51.390]  That's who gives them the debit cards.
[01:33:51.390 --> 01:33:52.390]  That's who brings them over.
[01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:55.390]  And simultaneously, George Soros will be in an NBC article saying,
[01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:58.390]  I get billions of State Department money to do this.
[01:33:58.390 --> 01:34:01.390]  Then if you talk about it, the ADL calls for your arrest.
[01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:03.390]  They say if you talk about replacement migration, you should be arrested.
[01:34:03.390 --> 01:34:09.390]  Well, here's the UN's own replacement migration document from 2001 on screen,
[01:34:09.390 --> 01:34:15.390]  saying it's their plan to take over the West while exploiting these populations.
[01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:19.390]  So he's at the Darien Gap on the border of Colombia and Panama.
[01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:24.390]  And I wanted to ask you, sir, you said, yeah, it's vindicating, but it makes me sick.
[01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:25.390]  That's the same way.
[01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:27.390]  You've been down there for over a decade.
[01:34:27.390 --> 01:34:30.390]  Obama was really starting to smuggle into the next level.
[01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:31.390]  Trump clamped down on it.
[01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:35.390]  Now Biden's blown it wide open, saying surge as soon as I get elected.
[01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:36.390]  Now the surge is there.
[01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:40.390]  He's pretending like he's trying to control it, but he's not.
[01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:41.390]  But you see the congressional hearings.
[01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:43.390]  Maybe you haven't been down there for weeks.
[01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:46.390]  They're having hearings now saying what you and I were saying a decade ago,
[01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:51.390]  massive smuggling, releasing child predators, tens of thousands of kidnapped children.
[01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:53.390]  I mean, this is indescribable.
[01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:55.390]  Talk about that.
[01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:58.390]  And is the Darien Gap being shut down, like Mark said two weeks ago
[01:34:58.390 --> 01:35:00.390]  when you were down there covering it?
[01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:02.390]  And what's the big picture?
[01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:05.390]  And from a battle-hardened journalist and a veteran,
[01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:09.390]  who literally probably is the smartest person when it comes to this overall,
[01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:13.390]  what would you do if you were president?
[01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:15.390]  It's very easy to shut it down, Alex, super easy.
[01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:19.390]  I mean, for instance, almost every time you bring it up to people,
[01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:20.390]  they'll say, oh, you can't shut it down.
[01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:22.390]  I'm like, you don't even know what you're talking about.
[01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:23.390]  Why are you talking?
[01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:26.390]  I mean, it's like you can shut it down.
[01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:27.390]  Panama shut it down.
[01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:30.390]  During the COVID lockdowns, nobody got through here.
[01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:32.390]  This place was locked down for one year.
[01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:34.390]  Nobody got through.
[01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:36.390]  And so it's quite simple, right?
[01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:38.390]  The mechanism to shut it down is simple.
[01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:40.390]  First of all, you need an obstacle.
[01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:41.390]  That's very helpful.
[01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:42.390]  We've got the Darien Gap.
[01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:43.390]  We've got the Caribbean Ocean.
[01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:46.390]  Or in Europe, you've got the Med, that sort of thing, right?
[01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:47.390]  So there's great.
[01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:48.390]  That's an obstacle.
[01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:49.390]  Or build a border wall.
[01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:52.390]  The desert is very helpful in Texas and that sort of thing.
[01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:55.390]  The next is you need manpower to man the border.
[01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:56.390]  And third is policy, policy, policy.
[01:35:57.390 --> 01:35:58.390]  You don't give free stuff away.
[01:35:58.390 --> 01:36:01.390]  If you want ducks, throw corn on the ground.
[01:36:01.390 --> 01:36:02.390]  The ducks will come, right?
[01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:04.390]  So, I mean, if you're giving away free stuff,
[01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:06.390]  you're throwing gold on the ground or whatever,
[01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:10.390]  you have to have those different layers.
[01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:12.390]  One layer is obstacle.
[01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:14.390]  Next layer is manpower.
[01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:18.390]  Next layer is policy backed by manpower that deports people.
[01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:21.390]  If you get caught 10 years, you've been an American for 10 years,
[01:36:21.390 --> 01:36:25.390]  and you've got a business and whatnot, tough luck, you're out, right?
[01:36:25.390 --> 01:36:26.390]  That's it.
[01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:28.390]  So if you have that sort of policy, you don't give away free medical,
[01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:30.390]  you don't give away free anything.
[01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:35.390]  So bottom line, they have giant magnets sucking these people in.
[01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:36.390]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:38.390]  It's that human osmotic pressure, the hop.
[01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:41.390]  The human osmotic pressure is the push and the pull of migration.
[01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:44.390]  And, you know, there's always the human osmotic pressure, always.
[01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:46.390]  Even within Austin, let's say,
[01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:50.390]  somebody will move from one side of town to the other because whatever, right?
[01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:52.390]  Better neighborhood, better job, whatever.
[01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:54.390]  So the human osmotic pressure is always there.
[01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:56.390]  But in this case, as you know,
[01:36:56.390 --> 01:37:01.390]  massive human osmotic pressure is being created in the service of weaponized migration.
[01:37:01.390 --> 01:37:04.390]  The weaponized migration is a replacement strategy.
[01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:05.390]  It is.
[01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:06.390]  They're open about it.
[01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:07.390]  They don't hide it.
[01:37:07.390 --> 01:37:08.390]  They're in your face.
[01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:10.390]  And, of course, then they say you're a conspiracy theorist,
[01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:12.390]  even though they published the book on it, right,
[01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:14.390]  even though they say it constantly in the World Economic Forum.
[01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:16.390]  And CCP is very clear about it.
[01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:18.390]  Chinese Communist Party is crystal clear.
[01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:21.390]  That's why when you're in Hong Kong, you'll see that.
[01:37:21.390 --> 01:37:22.390]  Look at the top of my Twitter.
[01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:23.390]  You'll see the Chinese Nazi sign.
[01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:25.390]  That was a photo I took in Hong Kong.
[01:37:25.390 --> 01:37:30.390]  The Hong Kongers call the Chinese Communist Party masters.
[01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:36.390]  They call them Chinese Nazis because Nazism is basically just adding a huge component of racism to fascism.
[01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:41.390]  So you just take the basis of fascism, add a huge component of racism.
[01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:42.390]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:45.390]  I took that photo in Hong Kong before they came along.
[01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:49.390]  And by the way, Xi Jinping, they admit he admits admires Hitler above all others.
[01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:53.390]  Yeah, they're right in your face about it.
[01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:55.390]  They don't hide it whatsoever.
[01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:57.390]  And so, you know, and absolutely.
[01:37:57.390 --> 01:38:02.390]  Now, this is where the World Economic Forum, who you've been talking about for years and years.
[01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:04.390]  And, you know, people used to say you're crazy.
[01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:05.390]  It turns out you're not.
[01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:06.390]  You're right.
[01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:08.390]  You were just your headlights.
[01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:11.390]  See, very far, much further than most people's headlights.
[01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:14.390]  It sounds crazy, but it's all turned out to be true.
[01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:17.390]  But as you know, the World Economic Forum and the Chinese Communist Party,
[01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:20.390]  they cooperate extremely closely.
[01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:24.390]  They have intermediate and short-term goals that are they coincide.
[01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:26.390]  Their Venn diagrams overlap quite a lot.
[01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:31.390]  But at the end of the day, Chinese Communist Party wants the world to be on Chinese.
[01:38:31.390 --> 01:38:32.390]  And that's right.
[01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:35.390]  So there's finally that split that started in the last few years of Obama.
[01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:39.390]  Why did why was there a globalist split with the Chi comms?
[01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:41.390]  Describe that for us.
[01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:42.390]  Oh, yeah.
[01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:45.390]  Well, you know, of course, Obama wants the world to be his color.
[01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:48.390]  And Chinese will kill him.
[01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:50.390]  And they're open about it.
[01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:52.390]  They will wipe out Africa.
[01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:55.390]  They will wipe out everybody that's not Chinese.
[01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:56.390]  They don't hide it.
[01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:58.390]  They say it loud and clear.
[01:38:58.390 --> 01:39:04.390]  And so, yeah, so and at some point, Obama, even Obama is smart enough to recognize
[01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:07.390]  that he's on the termination schedule for the Chinese.
[01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:08.390]  And let's quantify that.
[01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:11.390]  We think of, like, white people being the racist as the media tells us.
[01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:16.390]  The Chinese dominant group is the most homogeneous group.
[01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:18.390]  They are the most racially, quote, pure group.
[01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:21.390]  And they openly preach racial supremacy.
[01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:24.390]  I've spent about a year running around China.
[01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:30.390]  You know, I've been to Tibet and well, Shanghai, Beijing, all over the place.
[01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:31.390]  Right.
[01:39:31.390 --> 01:39:33.390]  And the racism is absolutely severe.
[01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:35.390]  And they don't hide it again.
[01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:36.390]  It's right in your face.
[01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:37.390]  Like they're doing it.
[01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:38.390]  They do.
[01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:40.390]  They do genocide the way Americans go to McDonald's.
[01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:45.390]  I mean, for instance, what they're doing to the Tibetans and to the Uyghurs and
[01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:49.390]  Xinjiang province and what they're doing to the Mongolians and what they do to
[01:39:49.390 --> 01:39:51.390]  each other, what they'll be prepared to do.
[01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:52.390]  Look at the leftist.
[01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:55.390]  Look, look, look at the leftist.
[01:39:55.390 --> 01:40:00.390]  And when a guardian attacking the Hong Kong and Taiwanese were saying,
[01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:02.390]  Xi Jinping's a Nazi.
[01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:05.390]  Literally, they're saying he is a race leader.
[01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:09.390]  And then the left is defending the race leader.
[01:40:09.390 --> 01:40:12.390]  Remember the Han Chinese who are Mandarin speakers.
[01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:14.390]  And everybody who comes through here is a Mandarin speaker.
[01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:16.390]  That other guy, he's from Fujian.
[01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:18.390]  So he'll speak Fujian Mandarin.
[01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:21.390]  But I mean, the point is, is these are all Mandarin speakers.
[01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:23.390]  Like I've taken one of my recent trips.
[01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:26.390]  I took a Mandarin speaker and I took a Cantonese speaker.
[01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:27.390]  I took two translators.
[01:40:27.390 --> 01:40:30.390]  None of the Chinese that we talked with spoke Cantonese.
[01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:33.390]  And if you look at Hong Kong, which is mostly Cantonese speaking Hong Kong,
[01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:37.390]  the mainland Chinese, the Han Chinese,
[01:40:37.390 --> 01:40:39.390]  the Chinese Communist Party specifically,
[01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:42.390]  they're doing a soft genocide against the Cantonese speakers.
[01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:43.390]  Explain that.
[01:40:43.390 --> 01:40:47.390]  So is it fair to say that the mainline Chinese are the most powerful racist
[01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:48.390]  group on earth?
[01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:51.390]  Oh, easily.
[01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:52.390]  Yeah.
[01:40:52.390 --> 01:40:54.390]  I mean, you know, in the old days when people said, you know,
[01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:56.390]  the Japanese are going to take over the world, you know,
[01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:57.390]  which is ridiculous.
[01:40:57.390 --> 01:41:00.390]  There's like 70 million of them back in the thirties, right?
[01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:03.390]  There's like 70 million Japanese and probably 12 of them smoking.
[01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:04.390]  There's Japanese.
[01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:06.390]  We're never going to take over the world.
[01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:08.390]  But I tell you what, Han Chinese, they can actually do it.
[01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:09.390]  They have the technology.
[01:41:09.390 --> 01:41:10.390]  They have the will.
[01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:13.390]  It's part of the cultural DNA to just wipe out the other,
[01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:17.390]  basically weed the ground and replant with your own seed.
[01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:19.390]  I mean, that's clearly what they're doing.
[01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:21.390]  And they say it again.
[01:41:21.390 --> 01:41:22.390]  This is not conspiracy theory.
[01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:24.390]  This isn't me thinking it up one night.
[01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:26.390]  This is them saying it and executing.
[01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:29.390]  And again, the Cantonese speaking Hong Kongers,
[01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:32.390]  I spent, I don't know, in total, maybe seven or 10 months.
[01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:36.390]  I spent seven months there in 2019 and 20 before they kicked me out.
[01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:39.390]  But before that, I've been there off and on through the years.
[01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:41.390]  They look different to me.
[01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:43.390]  Like I can tell the Hong Kongers apart.
[01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:45.390]  They don't look the same to me as Han Chinese.
[01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:47.390]  And they are different.
[01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:49.390]  Everything, their culture is very different.
[01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:52.390]  And they're smaller.
[01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:56.390]  They're actually more refined than most of the Han Chinese are.
[01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:58.390]  And the Han Chinese are wiping them out.
[01:41:58.390 --> 01:42:00.390]  And they used weaponized migration.
[01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:01.390]  I mean, the Chinese Communist Party,
[01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:06.390]  they were putting about 100 to 150 mainland Chinese into Hong Kong per day
[01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:08.390]  for year after year after year.
[01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:12.390]  They did the same thing in Tibet and now the same thing in the west in Mongolia
[01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:15.390]  taking over the Uyghur.
[01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:16.390]  Oh, yeah.
[01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:18.390]  When I went to Tibet, you know, I was like, you know what?
[01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:19.390]  Tibetans aren't getting this back.
[01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:21.390]  You know, I've been up to northern India with the Tibetans.
[01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:23.390]  And I'm, you know, where else?
[01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:24.390]  Nepal, of course.
[01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:26.390]  I spent a year in Nepal.
[01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:29.390]  And, you know, they're not getting Tibet back.
[01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:31.390]  I mean, you can fly all the prayer flags that you want and whatnot,
[01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:33.390]  but you're not getting it back, not unless, you know,
[01:42:33.390 --> 01:42:37.390]  some pandemic wipes out the Han Chinese in Tibet or something.
[01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:39.390]  And the same thing with Xinjiang, right?
[01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:43.390]  Interestingly, the other day I was out in one of the remote villages here
[01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:44.390]  in one of the Chinese.
[01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:45.390]  He spoke English, actually.
[01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:48.390]  And he said that there was – I asked if there was any Uyghurs.
[01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:49.390]  He said, oh, there's somebody.
[01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:51.390]  Actually, he told me there's somebody from Xinjiang.
[01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:52.390]  Hold on.
[01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:53.390]  Incredible.
[01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:54.390]  Michael Yon, stay there.
[01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:55.390]  Final segment straight ahead.
[01:42:56.390 --> 01:43:03.390]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move
[01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:05.390]  against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:06.390]  People said, no way.
[01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:08.390]  He's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:10.390]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:12.390]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believe they can control him.
[01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:15.390]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:17.390]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:21.390]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros
[01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:24.390]  or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:27.390]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.

[01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:41.390]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:44.390]  please don't take Infowars for granted.
[01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:45.390]  We're barely hanging on.

[01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:04.390]  This is their big move.
[01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:08.390]  So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:10.390]  He doesn't care.
[01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:11.390]  That's not his job.
[01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:13.390]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:16.390]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:21.390]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:23.390]  They must be opposed.
[01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:26.390]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:29.390]  No, no, no.
[01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:30.390]  Exactly.
[01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:33.390]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:44:33.390 --> 01:44:37.390]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:39.390]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:42.390]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:45.390]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:44:45.390 --> 01:44:48.390]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:51.390]  You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[01:44:51.390 --> 01:44:53.390]  And we say no.
[01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:55.390]  And we say no to your war.
[01:44:58.390 --> 01:45:04.390]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border, exposing the cartels and like coming under fire.
[01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:08.390]  Or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals.
[01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:11.390]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:13.390]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:15.390]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:17.390]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:19.390]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[01:45:19.390 --> 01:45:22.390]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:26.390]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:32.390]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:37.390]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:41.390]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is.
[01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:43.390]  Go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[01:45:43.390 --> 01:45:46.390]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:49.390]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:54.390]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[01:45:58.390 --> 01:46:05.390]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:08.390]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:13.390]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:16.390]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:19.390]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:22.390]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:25.390]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:46:25.390 --> 01:46:30.390]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:33.390]  who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:40.390]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:42.390]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:47.390]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:51.390]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:53.390]  And a remedy to this madness.
[01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:57.390]  Available now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:59.390 --> 01:47:03.390]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:05.390]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:21.220]  That's what the system is doing, coming after our children.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:24.260]  Another brick in the wall.
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:25.260]  Wow.
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:26.260]  Michael Yawn.
[01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:29.660]  Norm Pattis couldn't come on next hour, one of the lead attorneys for the Proud Boys,
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:32.340]  because there's more charges.
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:33.340]  The jury's still out.
[01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:35.740]  Not just this conspiracy.
[01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:37.340]  But Michael Yawn's back in Texas next week.
[01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:38.860]  He says he'll come in studio with us.
[01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:39.860]  Cannot wait.
[01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:43.540]  Michael Yawn, investigative reporter, michael-yawn, or underscore yawn on Twitter.
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:44.540]  Just search his name.
[01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:46.140]  You can find all his great work.
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:51.940]  In closing, in the segment we have left here, big picture with the drone attacks on Putin's
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:58.660]  residence at the Kremlin, all the insane things happening with bank collapses, the investigations
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:01.460]  coming out that Hunter Biden was a Chinese spy.
[01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:02.460]  Big picture.
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:04.820]  What do you think of the world right now?
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:09.620]  Wow, it's amazing.
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:13.300]  The footage of the wars are obviously increasing.
[01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:19.060]  Any fool that tells you they can start a war and know how it's going to start and how it's
[01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:22.280]  going to play out should not be trusted with a war.
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:23.740]  Because wars always do one thing.
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:24.740]  They get out of control.
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:25.740]  Right?
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:29.100]  And they get out of control, and they always go in a way that nobody planned.
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:34.780]  So yeah, what's happening here now is the food shortages pick up around the world, including
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:35.940]  here in Panama, by the way.
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:39.420]  I hired two people last week to go around, check a bunch of different villages in different
[01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:40.420]  parts of Panama.
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:44.580]  There's starting to be not actually food shortages, but job shortages.
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:48.620]  And job shortages, when people cannot afford the food, ends up being people start stealing
[01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:50.980]  food and that sort of thing.
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:53.820]  And so that creates more of that hop, that human osmotic pressure.
[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:57.180]  Panama, where I'm at now, is being destabilized.
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:49:02.220]  The Panamanian government told me a couple of weeks ago in a long meeting that about 11%
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:04.460]  of Panama now is new Venezuelans.
[01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:05.460]  11%.
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:08.500]  In fact, I said, stop, hold on.
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:09.900]  Please repeat what you just told me.
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:10.900]  And she said, 11%.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:13.620]  So I said, let me repeat what you just said.
[01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:15.940]  One one percent are now new Venezuelans.
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:18.420]  And she said, yes, 11%.
[01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:21.660]  And it's destabilizing this country as the economies collapse.
[01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:24.980]  And for instance, there's other little things going on.
[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:27.580]  For instance, the dry season has been very long.
[01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:28.580]  Not rain today, actually.
[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:30.580]  This is supposed to be rainy season.
[01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:33.740]  So Gatun Lake is pretty dry now.
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:37.340]  It's decreasing the flow, it's decreasing the traffic that can go through the Panama
[01:49:37.340 --> 01:49:38.340]  Canal.
[01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:40.740]  You know, that water is important to keep the canal going.
[01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:42.980]  So I mean, there's all kinds of little things going on here.
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:48.220]  The prices of the nitrogenous fertilizers, I've reported on that extensively from Europe.
[01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:52.780]  For instance, when Nord Stream was hit, that impacted nitrogenous fertilizer production
[01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:58.060]  at places like BASF, that BASF is the biggest chemical company in the world.
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:00.820]  And their main plant, their biggest plant is at Ludwigshafen, Germany.
[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:03.500]  I was there at Ludwigshafen twice last year.
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:08.580]  In fact, I specifically asked one of the people in the plant, I said, what happens if Nord
[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:09.580]  Stream stops?
[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:10.580]  This was before it was attacked.
[01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:15.100]  And he said, well, you know, that means BASF at Ludwigshafen is dead.
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:16.100]  Something like that.
[01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:17.100]  I've got it on recording.
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:21.620]  But, you know, you have to have that natural gas, which you've talked about it before.
[01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:25.100]  And David, other people have talked about this quite a lot.
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:29.740]  You have to have that the hydrogen off the natural gas to combine with the nitrogen that
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:31.620]  we're breathing to create ammonia, right?
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:35.940]  To create the ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, urea, these sorts of things.
[01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:37.540]  They're so vital.
[01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:41.020]  And for instance, when I'm out with Dutch farmers, one of my pig farmer told me about
[01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:43.620]  a month and a half ago, I was there for the elections in Netherlands.
[01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:51.500]  He said, you know, I have this nice internal system of, you know, he takes his pig manure
[01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:55.060]  and he uses it to fertilize his pear trees and his Christmas trees.
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:56.860]  And I said, where do you get your pig feed?
[01:50:56.860 --> 01:50:58.660]  He's a smart farmer.
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:00.780]  His eyes lit up within like one second.
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:04.060]  He goes, oh, I get my pig feed from Brazil.
[01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:06.140]  And he started finishing the sentence.
[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:09.780]  He's like, and my prices are really, you know, exploding.
[01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:15.380]  And I said, yeah, you know, Brazil's not getting the nitrogenous fertilizers that it needs.
[01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:18.020]  And that's where the United States gets a lot of our protein.
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:24.660]  They're not getting it because most of the nitrogenous fertilizer facilities throughout
[01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:26.700]  Europe are either closed or mostly closed.
[01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:30.500]  It's a big deal for places like India, as an example.
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:36.300]  For instance, with Chinese here, and they're always loud.
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:37.700]  They're louder than Americans.
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:44.580]  The loudest people in the world are Chinese and then would be drunk British and Americans.
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:46.480]  And so, yeah, constantly.
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:50.880]  And so, yeah, these nitrogenous fertilizers are now affecting people in Panama.
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:55.360]  One farmer, his name is Sebastian, he's 73 years old.
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:58.320]  He said his father and his grandparents, they've always been farmers.
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:03.080]  This is the first year, 2023, when he will not be farming because he cannot afford the
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:04.560]  nitrogenous fertilizers.
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:05.560]  He can't afford it.
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:10.080]  So he's going to be living off of his daughter, who works for the Panamanian government.
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:14.560]  You know, obviously, this can spiral quickly because there are a lot of...
[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:15.640]  So give people a big picture.
[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:16.640]  They're cutting off the oil.
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:17.640]  They're cutting off the gas.
[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:18.640]  They're cutting off the fertilizer.
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:20.200]  They want a post-industrial world.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:22.680]  The average person I talk to goes, I don't care if the stock market plunges.
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:24.000]  I don't have money in the stock market.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.280]  They don't get that affects them.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:30.720]  So why do you think the globalists want to implode the world economy?
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:31.720]  To destroy...
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:33.480]  Well, you've talked about it for years.
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:35.320]  Nobody knows it like you do.
[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:40.760]  You know, they're clearly destroying Japan, destroying the United States, destroying Europe.
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:42.400]  Europe has just gone with the wind.
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:45.920]  You know, I'm in Europe quite a lot, traveling everywhere.
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:49.000]  And you can see that they're just like, for instance, even Ireland.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:53.880]  I was in Ireland some months ago talking with Mary Lynn MacDonald, the leader of Sinn Fein,
[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:56.120]  total, complete leftist nutball.
[01:52:56.120 --> 01:52:59.320]  All she wanted to talk about was equality and equity and all this nonsense.
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:02.760]  And, you know, she's like, we will never have another famine in Ireland.
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:05.800]  I'm like, bullshit, you're crazy.
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:07.000]  She's like, we have plenty of food.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.360]  We create enough food for 25 million people.
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:11.040]  We have fewer than eight million on the island.
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:14.280]  I'm like, you know, famine is endemic to Ireland.
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:19.160]  You had a famine when you were surrounded by fish in 1845 to 1852, right?
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:20.880]  You've had a lot of famines here.
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:24.760]  Where do you get your, where do you get your fertilizers and your other chemicals from?
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:26.480]  They don't come from Ireland.
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:27.640]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:31.280]  All these energy inputs and whatnot, they're getting very expensive.
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:33.640]  And Ireland is being overwhelmed with migration.
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:34.640]  These weaponized...
[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:40.160]  And Germany just shut down, Germany just shut down its three final nuke plants and will
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:41.800]  not allow hydroelectric or coal.
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:46.400]  I mean, this is their, the communists want to implode us to make us accept a new society.
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:49.200]  It's clouded and piven on a grand scale.
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:50.200]  Yeah.
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:52.240]  I lived in Germany for four years.
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:55.560]  I lived in Europe for more than six or right, Poland and most, but it was mostly Poland
[01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:56.560]  and Germany.
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:01.560]  And it's funny when I, when I've spent so much time in Germany, all over the place,
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:04.960]  I love Southern Germany, but you know what the Germans always want to talk about when
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:08.920]  they meet Americans and English people within 30 minutes, I'll just write, I'll write it
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:13.360]  down and I put it in my pocket within 30 minutes, they'll ask me about my position
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:14.360]  on guns.
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:17.480]  And I'll pull out my piece of paper and said, you were going to ask me about guns.
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:21.320]  That really shocks Germans and English when they're like, yeah, you're that predictable.
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:24.920]  All you care about, you're, you're a natural born slave.
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:30.880]  You talk like slaves, you act like slaves, you give up all your means of self defense.
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:32.720]  You're all about the government taking care of you.
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:34.080]  I'm not like that.
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:38.320]  My grandparents came to the United States, came to America in 1609 and got shipwrecked
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:39.320]  on Bermuda.
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:43.120]  I come from an alpha stock that is not going to just give up.
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:44.120]  Right.
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:45.680]  You know, we are real Americans.
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:46.680]  We're not Germans.
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:47.680]  We're not English.
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:48.680]  I love that term.
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:49.680]  I'm not a European.
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:50.680]  Exactly.
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:51.680]  Alpha stock.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:52.680]  I love it.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:53.680]  People ask why America is different.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:54.680]  We were the people that fled tyranny.
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:58.680]  Didn't mean we were perfect, but we were trying to find something new.
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:54:59.680]  That's right.
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:01.840]  We've never been perfect, but we've never been quitters either.
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:07.280]  And, you know, and, uh, and, uh, you know, again, we're not that, you know, I love Europe.
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:10.200]  I love rolling around Europe, but I'm not a slave.
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:14.880]  And the whole slave mentality just permeates across Europe and a lot of America.
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:18.480]  And a lot of these people that are coming in here, they have no concept whatsoever
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:19.760]  of a constitution.
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:22.720]  A lot of Americans have no concept of constitution.
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:26.240]  That's why these people that are coming in will be eventually perfect slaves.
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:30.000]  They're, they're coming, they're being sent to the United States and induced and pushed
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:35.760]  and pulled as a replacement stride, just like Stalin did in Ukraine with a lot more, just
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:40.320]  like Mao did, just like so many people have done throughout space and time.
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:45.520]  Weaponization of migration is, is, is a, is a well-known war tactic and strategy and,
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:46.960]  and that's what's unfolding.
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:51.760]  And, and their whole intent and purpose is to be useful idiots.
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:56.160]  These are the useful idiots that are coming up on these buses every day, filled with buses
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:58.880]  and tuberculosis there to replace us.
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:03.600]  And then they will be replaced with, with, with whatever numbers that the globalists want
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:05.120]  to have left behind.
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:09.600]  But I can tell you what the Chinese communist party and the world economic forum, eventually
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:10.720]  they're going to duke it out.
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:12.240]  They're going to duke it out hard.
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:16.720]  And people like Bill Gates, he's not, he's not, he's not on their arc.
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:20.560]  He's not on the Chinese communist party nor is Obama.
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:23.760]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:24.960]  Michael Yan, we love you.
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:25.680]  We appreciate you.
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:27.600]  Can't wait to hear in studio next week.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:29.600]  You name the time when you get back with my producers.
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:30.640]  We'll put you on hold.
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:32.000]  You tell us when you want to be here.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:32.880]  Maybe Thursday or Friday.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.320]  So make sure you got time to get back.
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:36.400]  We want to have you in studio for several hours.
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:37.680]  God bless you.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:38.720]  Be safe and go with God.
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:40.720]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:41.680]  Thank you, sir.
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:43.360]  And, uh, and God bless you.
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:44.480]  And I'll see you up in Texas.
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:45.360]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:45.680]  All right.
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:48.000]  Another fellow Austinite lives out in Ribbon Springs.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:48.960]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:51.680]  The next guest is canceled.
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:55.280]  We're going to open the phones up, cover all the other news next hour.
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:56.240]  Get ready for that.
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:00.400]  And I'll get into the AI attack we had yesterday with Tucker Carlson.
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:01.520]  Wait till you hear this.
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:02.400]  It's all next hour.
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:03.040]  Don't forget.

[01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:56.180]  It will change your life.
[01:57:56.180 --> 01:58:00.820]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have
[01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:04.900]  mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:58:04.900 --> 01:58:10.420]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:16.140]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:20.420]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:26.540]  And Infowarestore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:27.540]  effect.
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:31.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce,
[01:58:31.900 --> 01:58:33.500]  and it's finally back in stock.
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:36.540]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.

[01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:56.380]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce+, we made it even stronger.

[01:59:07.020 --> 01:59:13.580]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours, should be
[01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:15.180]  called 10-hour energy.
[01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:20.660]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things, and amino acids
[01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:25.540]  that turbocharge everything, and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you
[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:26.540]  name it.
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:32.980]  It is the super fuel, RainForce Plus is great, RainForce Ultra is great, they're two different
[01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:38.980]  nitropics, they go good with this, but this is the King Kong, this is the boss.
[01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:50.980]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, Infowarestore.com, more power, more strength, more energy.
[01:59:50.980 --> 01:59:57.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:57.300 --> 02:00:04.420]  I want to talk to you about something right now that can and will change your life.
[02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:09.180]  It's changed my life and millions of other people's lives, in fact, billions, some for
[02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:13.220]  the better, some for the worse, and I'm talking about iodine deficiency.
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:17.980]  Now this is a very complex issue, but in the next few minutes, I want to try to boil it
[02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:18.980]  down for you.
[02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:25.880]  I have Wikipedia right here with links to the UN itself, admitting that over 2 billion
[02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:32.520]  people have intellectual disability, lower IQs, psychological problems, neurological
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:38.840]  issues because of lack of iodine, particularly when they're developing and growing as children,
[02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:40.960]  but also throughout life.
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:46.920]  Now most iodine that's in food is bound to other elements, so your body cannot absorb
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:47.920]  it.
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:53.240]  Atomic iodine is pure deep earth crystal iodine, and until we started selling it about 12 years
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:57.200]  ago, nobody else in the world was doing that.
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:01.000]  There are other types of iodine that are not pure atomic that are very close to it that
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:06.360]  are also good for the body and help with the absorption of regular atomic or nascent iodine.
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:12.640]  That's why with top researchers, we developed X3 that has a deep earth crystal iodine and
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:16.700]  two other types of iodine in it as well for better absorption, and it's been sold out
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:21.120]  for many, many months, but now we got a big shipment of it in to InfoWarshaw.com right
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:24.640]  now, and it's 25% off.
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:30.280]  So I want to encourage everybody to go to the encyclopedia, to go to medical literature,
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:31.280]  go wherever you want.
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:35.040]  Wikipedia is not always accurate, but you can check the bibliography here, the links.
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:40.400]  This is an accurate report right here from the UN, from major studies, you name it, about
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:47.360]  iodine deficiency being the number one cause worldwide of what they call intellectual disability.
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:54.360]  And if you look here on page two, it says, while reporting recent progress towards overcoming
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:58.760]  iodine deficiency disorders worldwide, the Lancet Medical Journal noted that the World
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:05.600]  Health Organization in 2007, nearly 2 billion individuals had insufficient iodine intake,
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:08.000]  a third being school age.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.960]  And it goes on, the conclusion was made that the single most preventable case of intellectual
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:16.360]  disability is that of iodine deficiency.
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:22.440]  The single biggest reason people are so dumb and IQs worldwide are dropping like a lead
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:25.440]  balloon is iodine deficiency.
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:30.460]  Now there was massive IQ dropping and massive deformities in the 20s and 30s.
[02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:34.840]  So the US government, as well as other governments said, by law, we're going to put it in the
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:40.120]  salt and we're going to encourage bakeries and companies that sell flour to put some
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:43.200]  iodine in it.
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:46.280]  IQs exploded up to 15 points on average in just a few years.
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:52.540]  Then in the 80s, they took it out and in this own report from Wikipedia, they admit that
[02:02:52.540 --> 02:03:02.600]  they put in things that counter the iodine like bromide, bromine, and other things instead
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:07.760]  of the iodine that you need when the other chemicals are toxic.
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:11.120]  This is absolutely insane.
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:16.160]  So ladies and gentlemen, get X3 back in stock, consult your physician before you use it, because
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:19.520]  if you already have thyroid issues, there could be some issues.
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:24.680]  But find out about the power of triiodine in your body.
[02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:28.720]  Go to mfulworthstore.com, read about it, consult your physician or healthcare provider, and
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:30.560]  then get a bottle of it.
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:34.880]  It usually takes, when you're deficient, about two weeks for you to feel the effects.
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:37.960]  After about two weeks on average, you'll feel a little bit groggy and weird for a few days,
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:42.000]  and then all of a sudden, boom, you feel younger, you feel stronger.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:46.080]  Things just for your skin, your body, your libido, your energy, your electrochemical activities,
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:48.560]  your brain, is simply incredible.
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:53.680]  So it's finally back in stock, X3, mfulworthstore.com.
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:56.640]  Stock up on it, because I don't know when we're going to be able to have it again, and
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:59.080]  your purchase of X3 funds our operation.
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:02.400]  And while you're there, get other great products that are so good for your brain and your cells

[02:05:05.780 --> 02:05:08.520]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:12.800]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:18.080]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:25.320]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:31.600]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:37.320]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:41.680]  cognitive disabilities because they don't have high-quality iodine.
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:43.920]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:49.600]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:51.680]  X3 is now back in stock at mfulworthstore.com.
[02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:55.600]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:56.960]  X3 back in stock.
[02:05:56.960 --> 02:05:58.960]  Take action now, mfulworthstore.com.
[02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:14.320]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com front-line report.
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:16.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:21.320 --> 02:06:27.320]  In the coming years, in the coming decades, we will face individual discrimination and
[02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:32.320]  it might actually be based on a good assessment of who you are.
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:38.320]  I mean, if AT&T, if the algorithms and the big data algorithms of AT&T, they follow you
[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:45.320]  around, they look up your Facebook profile, your DNA, your records from kindergarten until
[02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:50.320]  today, they will be able to figure out quite accurately who you are.
[02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:57.320]  And if they, for example, find out that, oh, he lacks motivation on the X scale, on the
[02:06:57.320 --> 02:07:05.320]  Harari scale, on the Friedman scale of self-motivation, 0 to 10, he's just 7.1.
[02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:12.320]  And we don't want to accept to our company people of less than 8.2.
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:17.320]  And we know from experience that, yes, we can give you a little push, but you just lack
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:19.320]  what we need.
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:25.320]  And you will not be able to do anything or almost anything about this discrimination,
[02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:27.320]  first of all, because it's just you.
[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:32.320]  They don't discriminate against you or me because you're Jewish or gay or black or whatever
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:34.320]  because you're you.
[02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:52.320]  I've been talking about this for 20 years, my 29 years on air, and you just heard it,
[02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:55.320]  legalized discrimination.
[02:07:55.320 --> 02:08:00.320]  Well, they've got us fighting over whether we're black or white or brown or pink.
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:05.320]  Well, they've got us obsessed on all these diversionary issues.
[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:14.320]  Here's the high priest of the globalist mouthpiece, the World Economic Forum, saying we're creating
[02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:20.320]  a global scale, and listen to this power trip, the Harari scale, on your social behavior.
[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:22.320]  Are you sterilizing your kids?
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:23.320]  Are you taking Prozac?
[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:24.320]  Are you eating bugs?
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:26.320]  You go way up.
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:31.320]  So while they've got us fighting over what color we are, they're literally bringing in
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:38.320]  a system that discriminates against you that they design, and they're selling it like it's
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:39.320]  liberal and trendy and cool.
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:41.320]  That's what the carbon taxes are.
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:43.320]  That's what the social credit scores are.
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:45.320]  It's what it all is.
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:47.320]  And people say, well, I'll just get in line with that.
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:50.320]  I'll get a bunch of free goodies if I go along with it.
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:57.320]  What an outrageously anti-human, what an outrageously authoritarian, totalitarian, what an incredibly
[02:08:57.320 --> 02:09:04.320]  abusive discriminatory system to say, we don't like what you stand for or who you are, so
[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:08.320]  we're going to put you on this scale and we're going to discriminate against you.
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:11.320]  Discrimination under the left is a good thing.
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:13.320]  They bully.
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:14.320]  They attack.
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:15.320]  They surveil.
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:16.320]  They censor.
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:17.320]  They control.
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:19.320]  They target your children.
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:24.320]  So let's play that clip one more time and listen to this with new ears and think about
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:26.320]  what a monster this individual is.
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:33.320]  Now, in the coming years, in the coming decades, we will face individual discrimination, and
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:37.320]  it might actually be based on a good assessment of who you are.
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:41.320]  I mean, if AT&T, if the algorithms and the big data...
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:42.320]  Start over again.
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:43.320]  Hit pause.
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:50.320]  So the big tech steals your data, creates these databases, manipulates the data, and
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:53.320]  then says it might be based on a good thing.
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:58.320]  So you all know Harari says discrimination is good.
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:02.320]  The left says their whole new model is based on discrimination.
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:03.320]  That's what you just heard.
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:07.320]  Now, you're not supposed to discriminate for a better neighborhood or a better school that
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:08.320]  has your values.
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:09.320]  That's all bad.
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:10.320]  Give up your values.
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:13.320]  But they're making themselves God.
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:16.320]  He's saying there might be a good reason for this.
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:18.320]  See, it's good.
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:24.320]  And it's their values of transgenderism and pedophilia and a post-human world.
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:26.320]  He says the future is not human.
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:28.320]  Play the clip again from the start.
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:35.320]  Now, in the coming years, in the coming decades, we will face individual discrimination, and
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:39.320]  it might actually be based on a good assessment of who you are.
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:46.320]  I mean, if AT&T, if the algorithms and the big data algorithms of AT&T, they follow you
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:53.320]  around, they look up your Facebook profile, your DNA, your records from kindergarten until
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:58.320]  today, they will be able to figure out quite accurately who you are.
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:04.320]  And if they, for example, find out that, oh, he lacks motivation on the X scale, on the
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:11.320]  Harari scale, on the Friedman scale of self-motivation, 0 to 10, he's just 7.1.
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:18.320]  And we don't want to accept to our company people of less than 8.2.
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:24.320]  And we know from experience that, yes, we can give you a little push, but you just lack
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:25.320]  what we need.
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:32.320]  And you will not be able to do anything or almost anything about this discrimination,
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:34.320]  first of all, because it's just you.
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:40.320]  They don't discriminate against you or me because you're Jewish or gay or black or whatever
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:41.320]  because you're you.
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:50.320]  They define it and then say, you can't do anything because we the gods of Earth, we
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:51.320]  define it.
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:54.320]  We define it.
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:56.320]  We define it.
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:12:01.320]  And we say, well, we're arresting you for criticizing open borders or election fraud
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:02.320]  or wanting to control your own body.
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:03.320]  That's all illegal.
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:04.320]  That's all bad.
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:08.320]  But we decide it's not enough to be black and gay or a pedophile.
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:15.320]  And for those that get the 8.2, there's always something new they've got to desperately do
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:20.320]  and bow down to the high priest of control so that they get to have the mark of the beast.
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:21.320]  They get to live.
[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:22.320]  They get to have a job.
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:30.320]  They get to be in culture, literally setting up a rigged system for this monster, this
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:38.320]  totalitarian Hitler 2.0 sitting there in front of you, financed by all the big corporations,
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:46.320]  pushed by the system, telling you that you've got to totally and completely submit to them.
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:52.320]  That's what this comes down to.
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:54.320]  That's what they've done.
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:56.320]  That's what they've established.
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:03.320]  And that's what a technocracy is, where you wake up and these unseen, unknown groups
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:08.320]  are saying your value according to some score and saying, well, it's reasonable.
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:09.320]  There's nothing you can do.
[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:10.320]  It's not because you're black.
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:12.320]  It's not because you're white.
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:13.320]  It's not because you're male or female.
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:18.320]  We just have this data we put into it to decide you don't get a job.
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:19.320]  You don't live.
[02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:22.320]  You eat bugs and live in a 200-square-foot apartment.
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:28.320]  And anytime you want to commit suicide, we're happy to come by and take care of that for you.
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:31.320]  Oh, you want your kids to get a job?
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:32.320]  You want your kids to have school?
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:36.320]  Well, you've got enough carbon credits that if you commit suicide, your family will be
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:37.320]  taken care of for 10 years.
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:39.320]  But they're always going to squeeze the resources.
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:41.320]  They're always going to make it tougher and harder.
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:46.320]  The more you jump, the more you submit, the more you bark like a seal for the fish, the
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:50.320]  more they've got their full control over you.
[02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:56.320]  And that's what they're doing.
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:13:58.320]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:02.320]  This is a dream of authoritarians and totalitarians.
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:04.320]  This is a dream of tyrants.
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:06.320]  This is the mark of the beast.
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:08.320]  This is total control, total surveillance, total annihilation.
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:11.320]  And the bar is always going to be higher and higher.
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:13.320]  No more open, free society.
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:17.320]  That's why George Soros calls his society open society, because it's not an open society.
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:23.320]  It is a tyrannical, anti-human society of annihilation.
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:30.320]  I want to come back with a quick clip and talk about Fox News losing 42% of its viewers
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:35.320]  last week with Viva Frye, a great lawyer out of Canada, co-host with Robert Barnes.
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:37.320]  And then we'll get into all this.
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:40.320]  The reason I mention this is this is the good news.
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:42.320]  We still have control over the market to some extent.
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:44.320]  We can reject Hollywood.
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:45.320]  We can reject Anheuser-Busch.
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:47.320]  We can reject, you all know Harari.
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:52.320]  No matter how much they force feed them on us, anything they're force feeding,
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:57.320]  anything they're pushing, we know is liquid death.
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:02.320]  It's that simple.
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:04.320]  And hey, don't listen to me.
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:06.320]  Go ahead and go along with their system.
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:08.320]  Go ahead and sign on to their system.
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:11.320]  And they'll sit there and give you a little credits and a little bit of chicken feed up front.
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:16.320]  But in the end, when the chips are down, you're going to know you made the wrong decision
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:17.320]  and didn't bet on humanity.
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:22.320]  As for me, I am one infinity on this.
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:24.320]  I am totally committed.
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:26.320]  And I know there's a lot in the tunnel.
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:29.320]  And I know we're going to defeat this group of scientific tyrants.
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:32.320]  But you've got to first recognize they exist.
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:34.320]  And you've got to recognize an alternative exists.
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:36.320]  And you've got to join the alternative.
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:38.320]  The alternative is the universe that God made.
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:40.320]  The alternative is everything that works.
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:42.320]  The alternative is victory.
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:44.320]  Victory is right here, baby.
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:45.320]  We're in it together.
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:47.320]  I love you no matter what color you are.
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:49.320]  You're black, you're white, you're brown.
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:51.320]  I love you.
[02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:52.320]  I love your spirit.
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:54.320]  We will win together.
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:02.320]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:04.320]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:08.320]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:10.320]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars,
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:13.320]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:17.320]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:19.320]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:21.320]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:24.320]  five, six, seven days a week.
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:26.320]  It's really just incredible.
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:28.320]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew,
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:30.320]  I thank you for your past support.
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:32.320]  And I want to encourage you now to realize that
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:35.320]  InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:36.320]  I know you spread the word.
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:37.320]  I know you pray for us.
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:38.320]  That's wonderful.
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:39.320]  Keep doing it.
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:42.320]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:44.320]  and you never buy great products that enrich
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:46.320]  and empower your life all at the same time
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:47.320]  keeping us on air.
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:49.320]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:51.320]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:53.320]  If just 1% more of you took action
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:55.320]  and went to InfoWarsStore.com,
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:56.320]  our funding problems will be over.
[02:16:56.320 --> 02:16:57.320]  Please take action now.
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:00.320]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:03.320]  There is a war that will control my destiny,
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:05.320]  your destiny, our children's destinies.
[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:07.320]  And that war is something that we can win,
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:09.320]  but it takes dedication.
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:10.320]  It takes commitment.
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:12.320]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:14.320]  to go to InfoWarsStore.com
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:16.320]  and buy great products that will enrich
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:19.320]  and empower your life while keeping us on air
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:21.320]  at the very same time.
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:23.320]  InfoWarsStore.com
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:25.320]  to get a signed or unsigned copy
[02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:27.320]  of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World.
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:28.320]  Ultimate Bone Broth.
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:29.320]  Back and Stock.
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:30.320]  Nitric Boost.
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:33.320]  The amazing CBD oil we have
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:35.320]  that's the highest quality you're gonna find anywhere
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:37.320]  at more than half off.
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:39.320]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:41.320]  Some of the very best products.
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:43.320]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsStore.
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:44.320]  You've been watching for years,
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:45.320]  you've been listening for years,
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:47.320]  but you've never taken the step
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:48.320]  to go to InfoWarsStore.
[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:50.320]  These are great products that really work
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:51.320]  and are amazing,
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:52.320]  plus they keep us on air.
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:54.320]  So again, please take action.
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:56.320]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:57.320]  and I thank you.
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:02.320]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:06.320]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:08.320]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:09.320]  Period.
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:10.320]  Case closed.
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:12.320]  Out to get you and your family.
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:14.320]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:16.320]  made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:18.320]  It's been around about 15 years.
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:20.320]  Became the biggest company in the last six.
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:21.320]  They went out, hired engineers,
[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:24.320]  reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:26.320]  out there that sells for twice the price.
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:29.320]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:31.320]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels.
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:32.320]  Thousands of chemicals.
[02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:34.320]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:37.320]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:40.320]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:42.320]  for half the price of the leading competitor.
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:45.320]  And the media says we're bad and a cult
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:47.320]  for telling you you should filter your water.
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:49.320]  You should also filter your shower water.
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:51.320]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:52.320]  But I'm done talking about that.
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:55.320]  The point is you can get the filters at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:56.320]  They're discounted right now.
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:57.320]  Finally back in stock.
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:18:59.320]  They decided to not perp walking,
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:01.320]  not put him in handcuffs,
[02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:02.320]  not do a mug shot
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:04.320]  because they knew that that would help Trump.
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:06.320]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:07.320]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:09.320]  We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:10.320]  So we've made our own.
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:13.320]  And it says political prisoner
[02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:15.320]  with an image of President Trump.
[02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:17.320]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:19.320]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:23.320]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there
[02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:26.320]  in a mug shot jail background.
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:27.320]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:31.320]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:33.320]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:34.320]  No, I'm not running for president.
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:36.320]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:37.320]  Red, white, and blue.
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:38.320]  Alex Jones for president.
[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:40.320]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:41.320]  and a limited edition shirt.
[02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:43.320]  Great way to fund the operation.
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:46.320]  So get your Alex Jones for president
[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:51.320]  and Trump mug shot shirts at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:56.320]  or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:03.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:05.320]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:07.290 --> 02:20:26.290]  Meet you for coffee at the elementary schools, we laugh about nothing as the summer gets cool.
[02:20:26.290 --> 02:20:46.290]  It's beautiful, how this deep, the melody settles down over me. I'm not bored or unhappy, I'm still so strange and I'm in the wind, I'm in the water, nobody's son, nobody's wife.
[02:20:46.290 --> 02:20:58.290]  Him trails over the country club. Him trails over the country club. You think you're in a country club, you're not. Allow yourself all day if you're under attack.
[02:20:58.290 --> 02:21:05.290]  Alright, we are back. Let me talk about this now. Had a very bizarre phone call yesterday, they said they're going to put out Monday.
[02:21:05.290 --> 02:21:14.290]  But Google computer scientist, the head AI guy in the world, quit so he can warn the world of scary and dangerous AI.
[02:21:14.290 --> 02:21:27.290]  A Google computer scientist of the godfather of AI has quit the company stating that he did not, did so in order to warn the world of the danger the technology presents as big tech engages in AI arms race.
[02:21:27.290 --> 02:21:35.290]  Godfrey Hinton responded to a New York Times article that insinuated he had quit Google in order to criticize the company,
[02:21:35.290 --> 02:21:41.290]  noting that the real reason was he actually wanted to freely talk about the dangers of AI.
[02:21:41.290 --> 02:21:47.290]  He still believes the systems were inferior to human brains in some ways, but he thought that they were eclipsing human intelligence in others.
[02:21:47.290 --> 02:21:52.290]  Maybe what is going on in these systems, he said, is actually a lot better than what is going on in the brain.
[02:21:52.290 --> 02:22:03.290]  What's really bad is how predatory groups of humans can use AI and all its plagiarized material to dominate humans and we don't recognize AI from human.
[02:22:03.290 --> 02:22:15.290]  We need certifications, we need organizations, we need pro-human unions where we buy products and we travel and we go on planes piloted by humans, where we buy products made by humans.
[02:22:15.290 --> 02:22:18.290]  This is the whole future I told you 20 plus years ago.
[02:22:18.290 --> 02:22:22.290]  As companies improve AI systems he believes they become increasingly dangerous.
[02:22:22.290 --> 02:22:26.290]  Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now, he said, of AI technology.
[02:22:26.290 --> 02:22:29.290]  Take the difference and propagate it towards that scary.
[02:22:30.290 --> 02:22:33.290]  I got an experience in AI yesterday.
[02:22:33.290 --> 02:22:40.290]  I'm in an accounting meeting for Infowars, an accounting firm across town at about 545.
[02:22:40.290 --> 02:22:45.290]  My phone buzzes and says Tucker Carlson on it.
[02:22:45.290 --> 02:22:49.290]  I say, let me step out and let me take this phone call.
[02:22:50.290 --> 02:22:59.290]  I step out in the hall and it's Tucker Carlson's voice.
[02:22:59.290 --> 02:23:00.290]  It's Tucker, I know Tucker.
[02:23:00.290 --> 02:23:03.290]  We talk on the phone all the time, text all the time.
[02:23:03.290 --> 02:23:12.290]  The individual says a bunch of sexually explicit things to me.
[02:23:12.290 --> 02:23:15.290]  Well, I right away figure out this isn't Tucker Carlson's.
[02:23:15.290 --> 02:23:18.290]  I say, okay, this is some type of AI garbage.
[02:23:18.290 --> 02:23:24.290]  This is somebody calling me with an AI soundboard where they type out a script, put it in AI, they have a recording,
[02:23:24.290 --> 02:23:28.290]  then they just hit buttons of different responses to make it sound like a conversation.
[02:23:28.290 --> 02:23:33.290]  And the guy that did it is now admitted on Twitter with over two and a half million views that he did.
[02:23:33.290 --> 02:23:37.290]  His name is PrankStallone at theCJS on Twitter.
[02:23:38.290 --> 02:23:42.290]  In fact, let's show his original tweet if we can.
[02:23:42.290 --> 02:23:45.290]  So he starts saying sexually explicit things.
[02:23:45.290 --> 02:23:47.290]  I want to co-host a show with you.
[02:23:47.290 --> 02:23:49.290]  I want to do sexual things to you.
[02:23:49.290 --> 02:23:51.290]  I said, this isn't Tucker Carlson.
[02:23:51.290 --> 02:23:57.290]  Instantly, my brain says this is AI and somebody who spoofed his phone number calling me doing it.
[02:23:57.290 --> 02:24:03.290]  Okay, so let's say someone has Tucker Carlson's cell phone and also Alex Jones' cell phone number
[02:24:03.290 --> 02:24:05.290]  and also an AI Tucker Carlson voice.
[02:24:05.290 --> 02:24:10.290]  They could, in theory, call Alex Jones and pretend to be Tucker and have a full conversation with him.
[02:24:10.290 --> 02:24:12.290]  Anyways, I just did that.
[02:24:12.290 --> 02:24:14.290]  And that is what happened yesterday.
[02:24:14.290 --> 02:24:16.290]  He says he's going to release it Monday.
[02:24:16.290 --> 02:24:22.290]  And this person is so divorced from God, so satanic, as I talked to him earlier today on the phone,
[02:24:22.290 --> 02:24:25.290]  they go, I'm not going to come on your show and explain this isn't aggressive.
[02:24:25.290 --> 02:24:28.290]  To be friendly, you're bigger than me.
[02:24:28.290 --> 02:24:30.290]  How does it help me to come on your show?
[02:24:30.290 --> 02:24:35.290]  I said, well, it would be bigger for your show to talk about why you did this and what you think of AI.
[02:24:35.290 --> 02:24:38.290]  Obviously, if you're a smaller show, go on a bigger show.
[02:24:38.290 --> 02:24:40.290]  He goes, no, you don't help me.
[02:24:40.290 --> 02:24:42.290]  I said, well, Tucker's got his lawyers involved.
[02:24:42.290 --> 02:24:47.290]  He's really concerned about this because he can't let people fake his voice and then call around
[02:24:47.290 --> 02:24:52.290]  and threaten people and call around and say that people want to have sex with people
[02:24:52.290 --> 02:24:54.290]  and do this in their name.
[02:24:54.290 --> 02:24:56.290]  That's stealing someone's identity.
[02:24:56.290 --> 02:24:59.290]  That's spoofing their phone number, which is a theft of identity.
[02:25:00.290 --> 02:25:04.290]  And then it's pretending to be them and saying horrible things in their voice.
[02:25:04.290 --> 02:25:06.290]  You caused a lot of angst.
[02:25:06.290 --> 02:25:10.290]  And the guy right in front of my producer, we talked to him like two hours ago,
[02:25:10.290 --> 02:25:12.290]  said, screw you, and laughed at me.
[02:25:12.290 --> 02:25:14.290]  I don't care.
[02:25:14.290 --> 02:25:16.290]  So for them, it's all about the entertainment.
[02:25:16.290 --> 02:25:18.290]  It's all about being funny.
[02:25:18.290 --> 02:25:21.290]  But for me, I get this call.
[02:25:21.290 --> 02:25:23.290]  I've got to be in an accounting meeting.
[02:25:23.290 --> 02:25:24.290]  I call Tucker.
[02:25:24.290 --> 02:25:25.290]  He doesn't answer.
[02:25:25.290 --> 02:25:26.290]  Leave a message.
[02:25:26.290 --> 02:25:27.290]  We talk to him later.
[02:25:27.290 --> 02:25:28.290]  I call his head producer, Scooter.
[02:25:28.290 --> 02:25:30.290]  He goes, yes, send me the info.
[02:25:30.290 --> 02:25:34.290]  Scooter found out who it was because the guy was already bragging.
[02:25:34.290 --> 02:25:37.290]  And imagine, you don't just steal somebody's phone number.
[02:25:37.290 --> 02:25:39.290]  You don't just steal their identity.
[02:25:39.290 --> 02:25:41.290]  You don't just pose as them where the number comes up that way,
[02:25:41.290 --> 02:25:47.290]  which they can do to these IP addresses, these virtual phones you program.
[02:25:47.290 --> 02:25:51.290]  You then say, hey, Tucker, what's up?
[02:25:51.290 --> 02:25:52.290]  I want to co-host a show with you.
[02:25:52.290 --> 02:25:54.290]  I want to have sex with you.
[02:25:54.290 --> 02:25:56.290]  And I'm like, this isn't Tucker.
[02:25:56.290 --> 02:25:57.290]  And it's still Tucker's voice.
[02:25:58.290 --> 02:26:01.290]  Because at first I'm like, hey, sorry, I'm in a meeting.
[02:26:01.290 --> 02:26:04.290]  And it's like, do you believe it's me?
[02:26:04.290 --> 02:26:05.290]  It's me.
[02:26:05.290 --> 02:26:07.290]  You saw my number.
[02:26:07.290 --> 02:26:09.290]  I'm like, no, I see you called, Tucker.
[02:26:09.290 --> 02:26:13.290]  And then, well, I want to co-host a show with you and do sexual things to you.
[02:26:13.290 --> 02:26:17.290]  And I said, this is not Tucker Carlson.
[02:26:17.290 --> 02:26:20.290]  And then the guy lied on his Twitter and said Jones bought the whole thing.
[02:26:20.290 --> 02:26:26.290]  No, 30 seconds in, if he doesn't edit the tape, I went, this is AI.
[02:26:26.290 --> 02:26:30.290]  Somebody with a soundboard that put a text script into AI
[02:26:30.290 --> 02:26:34.290]  and then generated audio that sounds exactly like Tucker Carlson.
[02:26:34.290 --> 02:26:35.290]  And they can generate video.
[02:26:35.290 --> 02:26:37.290]  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:26:37.290 --> 02:26:41.290]  They don't just have avatars online posing as people to get you to follow Facebook
[02:26:41.290 --> 02:26:43.290]  or Twitter BS.
[02:26:43.290 --> 02:26:45.290]  They now are going to have your voice, your likeness.
[02:26:45.290 --> 02:26:49.290]  Just like I said, in the future, a family member dies, they're going to claim,
[02:26:49.290 --> 02:26:52.290]  oh, no, your family member paid half their money or all their money
[02:26:52.290 --> 02:26:56.290]  to be uploaded to an avatar to live forever in the matrix.
[02:26:56.290 --> 02:26:57.290]  It's a voice print.
[02:26:57.290 --> 02:26:58.290]  It knows your voice.
[02:26:58.290 --> 02:26:59.290]  It knows your ideas.
[02:26:59.290 --> 02:27:01.290]  It knows everything you ever said online.
[02:27:01.290 --> 02:27:09.290]  It can pose as you and even trick family members that it's you.
[02:27:09.290 --> 02:27:12.290]  It can even trick family members that it's you.
[02:27:14.030 --> 02:27:18.910]  And then if you say that is not really my father or my mother or my brother or
[02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:22.350]  my sister or my son or daughter the ultimate crime is saying no no they
[02:27:22.350 --> 02:27:26.710]  paid for it they're trans if two men can have a baby well then your mother can
[02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:30.110]  die and upload her brain to a computer no it's everything she ever said it
[02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:36.350]  looks just like her the voice print is her but it's not your mother and that's
[02:27:36.350 --> 02:27:40.310]  what this is all about and that's why AI is so dangerous because you can give it
[02:27:40.310 --> 02:27:43.350]  the prerequisites you want then have it write all these articles under other
[02:27:43.350 --> 02:27:47.270]  names they can produce more articles a thousand times a million times a
[02:27:47.270 --> 02:27:51.870]  billion times all the articles I can produce all the articles Tucker Carlson
[02:27:51.870 --> 02:27:56.350]  can produce all the articles James O'Keefe can produce and make it look
[02:27:56.350 --> 02:28:00.310]  like James O'Keefe and make it sound like James O'Keefe telling you the
[02:28:00.310 --> 02:28:06.310]  messages it wants and people will then not know what's true they want one up
[02:28:06.310 --> 02:28:10.470]  from down and the globals will be able to take over so this fellow says on
[02:28:10.470 --> 02:28:14.350]  Monday he's gonna put the conversation I've got on my phone I can see how long
[02:28:14.350 --> 02:28:17.750]  was one minute long hey it's Tucker how you doing I'm sorry
[02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:20.270]  I mean let me get out of here well can you hear me do you believe it's
[02:28:20.270 --> 02:28:24.710]  me no it's Tucker you see my number I called you yeah yeah man what this
[02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:27.230]  doesn't sound like you I mean what you're saying doesn't sound like you
[02:28:27.230 --> 02:28:33.030]  well you know I want to coast to show you and have basically have sex with you
[02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:36.990]  but this is a Tucker this is AI somebody's doing this in fours calm in
[02:28:36.990 --> 02:28:40.390]  fours calm I thought was like some live show doing it I was like in fours calm
[02:28:40.390 --> 02:28:45.510]  before I come and they hung up but that's what this is that's the danger of this
[02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:50.750]  and the real danger of AI is us accepting it and us using it against
[02:28:50.750 --> 02:28:56.710]  fellow humans we gotta hold the line the AI wars are here
[02:28:57.070 --> 02:29:02.030]  please give me one minute of your time please write this down and please go
[02:29:02.030 --> 02:29:06.790]  look this up it will change your life the UN admits and the Lanzik medical
[02:29:06.790 --> 02:29:10.910]  journal admits that upwards of two billion people have mental disabilities
[02:29:10.910 --> 02:29:16.270]  and declining cognitive abilities the term they use is intellectual disability
[02:29:16.270 --> 02:29:22.030]  because of lack of iodine most iodine in the environment is bound to other
[02:29:22.030 --> 02:29:27.790]  elements so your body can't absorb it only pure iodine can really be absorbed

[02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:15.070]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong Alex has been right on for over a
[02:30:15.070 --> 02:30:20.390]  decade I don't care how you slice it dice it flip it up or rub it down Alex
[02:30:20.390 --> 02:30:24.470]  Jones was right think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake
[02:30:24.470 --> 02:30:28.270]  for a year or two imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been
[02:30:28.270 --> 02:30:33.870]  awake for like decades Alex Jones called this years ago years ago Alex Jones
[02:30:33.870 --> 02:30:39.430]  never bought the Russia hoax not for a second you are one of the great thinkers
[02:30:39.430 --> 02:30:44.950]  of this you are a martyr to the First Amendment the government fears Alex
[02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:49.230]  Jones that's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate
[02:30:49.230 --> 02:30:52.310]  worldwide tyranny
[02:30:57.310 --> 02:31:02.430]  just weeks ago I warned the world that the globalists were gonna move against
[02:31:02.430 --> 02:31:05.630]  Tucker Carlson and take him off the air people said no way he's the most pop
[02:31:05.630 --> 02:31:09.150]  would ever happen they've got quadrillions of stolen money they only
[02:31:09.150 --> 02:31:11.710]  had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believe they can control him but as
[02:31:11.710 --> 02:31:15.150]  soon as they figured out they couldn't he was taken off the air it's the same

[02:32:57.340 --> 02:33:07.340]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:07.410 --> 02:33:34.450]  So here's the problem, even if moral people don't use AI to harass folks and impersonate
[02:33:34.450 --> 02:33:39.650]  people and engage in terrorizing the public, they're going to be mentally ill people and
[02:33:39.650 --> 02:33:43.130]  criminals and idiots that do it.
[02:33:43.130 --> 02:33:44.130]  And to them, it's all funny.
[02:33:44.130 --> 02:33:49.090]  It's all a big joke because they have no repercussions, they don't think anything matters.
[02:33:49.090 --> 02:33:53.810]  But just a few months ago, I forgot to tell the crew about this, the CIA came out and
[02:33:53.810 --> 02:33:59.330]  said, we're going to use deepfake and AI in war, type that in.
[02:33:59.330 --> 02:34:05.930]  CIA says they'll use deepfake in war.
[02:34:05.930 --> 02:34:08.770]  And so to the people doing this, it's funny.
[02:34:08.770 --> 02:34:13.610]  I've dealt with this 15, 16 years ago, there were a lot of popular soundboards online,
[02:34:13.610 --> 02:34:18.410]  where it's a console online that has hundreds of Alex Jones clips of me saying different
[02:34:18.410 --> 02:34:19.410]  things.
[02:34:19.410 --> 02:34:23.610]  I did to a lot of other folks.
[02:34:23.610 --> 02:34:28.570]  There's the headline, The Intercept, US Special Forces want to use deepfakes for PSYOPs, those
[02:34:28.650 --> 02:34:32.770]  other articles along those lines.
[02:34:32.770 --> 02:34:37.410]  And they would call businesses and random groups and play Alex Jones clips at them, yelling
[02:34:37.410 --> 02:34:42.010]  at them, auto parts stores, churches, police stations, you name it.
[02:34:42.010 --> 02:34:45.050]  Sometimes police departments would call me and say, is this you doing this?
[02:34:45.050 --> 02:34:50.650]  And even before that, 25 years ago, people would program fax machines and send the Austin
[02:34:50.650 --> 02:34:56.369]  Police Department messages, I'm coming down there to kill everybody tomorrow at noon.
[02:34:56.369 --> 02:35:00.730]  And my home phone would start ringing or my cell phone, hey, this is detective, blah,
[02:35:00.730 --> 02:35:01.730]  blah.
[02:35:01.730 --> 02:35:02.730]  We just got to check it.
[02:35:02.730 --> 02:35:05.369]  But did you send us a fax saying you're going to kill everybody tomorrow?
[02:35:05.369 --> 02:35:06.369]  I'm like, no.
[02:35:06.369 --> 02:35:11.130]  Yeah, we thought that somebody spoofing your phone number.
[02:35:11.130 --> 02:35:12.970]  Let's see your fax machine.
[02:35:12.970 --> 02:35:16.450]  But whoever did that, it was just funny, it was just cute.
[02:35:16.450 --> 02:35:20.170]  It was really nice to do that.
[02:35:20.170 --> 02:35:27.530]  This individual, Frank Stallone at the CJS, he thinks it's funny to copy Tucker Carlson's
[02:35:27.530 --> 02:35:31.289]  voice and call up and have Tucker Carlson say he wants to have sex with me.
[02:35:31.289 --> 02:35:33.890]  And quote, suck my titties.
[02:35:33.890 --> 02:35:36.410]  He thinks that's what he said.
[02:35:36.410 --> 02:35:37.970]  He thinks it's funny.
[02:35:37.970 --> 02:35:39.130]  And like, why are you upset?
[02:35:39.130 --> 02:35:40.410]  Why is Tucker upset?
[02:35:40.410 --> 02:35:41.410]  Why?
[02:35:41.410 --> 02:35:42.410]  I got your phone number.
[02:35:42.410 --> 02:35:43.410]  I'm spoofing it.
[02:35:43.410 --> 02:35:45.810]  I'm misrepresenting who you are.
[02:35:45.810 --> 02:35:46.810]  What's your problem?
[02:35:46.810 --> 02:35:49.490]  Well, I noticed he's gone offline now.
[02:35:49.490 --> 02:35:50.490]  He's not too happy.
[02:35:50.490 --> 02:35:51.490]  Oh, wow.
[02:35:51.490 --> 02:35:55.050]  It's not too good to be on a two-way street, son.
[02:35:55.050 --> 02:35:58.770]  It's not nice to have somebody say what you're doing to them.
[02:35:58.770 --> 02:35:59.770]  I'm just sitting here.
[02:35:59.770 --> 02:36:04.090]  I'm supposed to sit here like I don't exist, like I'm not a real person while you mess with
[02:36:04.090 --> 02:36:08.250]  my life, while you screw with me.
[02:36:08.250 --> 02:36:12.490]  I'm supposed to sit here and just roll over because it's all part of your fun?
[02:36:13.570 --> 02:36:21.050]  He stole Tucker Carlson's identity.
[02:36:21.050 --> 02:36:22.050]  He faked his number.
[02:36:22.050 --> 02:36:23.230]  He faked his voice.
[02:36:23.230 --> 02:36:30.570]  He called me and made sexual threats, basically.
[02:36:30.570 --> 02:36:39.490]  And he just thinks that's funny because in his sociopathic world, I don't exist.
[02:36:39.490 --> 02:36:41.970]  Alex Jones is fair game for any attack.
[02:36:41.970 --> 02:36:48.890]  So Tucker Carlson, we're going to find out who you're working with, buddy.
[02:36:48.890 --> 02:36:51.730]  I'm sure you'll respond by spamming our numbers out more.
[02:36:51.730 --> 02:36:54.810]  Already got plans for that.
[02:36:54.810 --> 02:37:00.210]  But at the end of the day, you'll always be a sack of garbage.
[02:37:00.210 --> 02:37:01.490]  But that's where we are.
[02:37:01.490 --> 02:37:04.130]  We would never do something like that because we're moral.
[02:37:04.130 --> 02:37:07.050]  These guys think it's funny to be moral.
[02:37:07.050 --> 02:37:08.970]  They think it's a joke.
[02:37:08.970 --> 02:37:12.970]  They think it's a game.
[02:37:12.970 --> 02:37:17.410]  But we're about to see the roller coaster that is the AI nightmare.
[02:37:17.410 --> 02:37:25.529]  And if you think this is bad, this is nothing compared to what it's going to do.
[02:37:25.529 --> 02:37:33.289]  Infowars.com article from April 11th, last month.
[02:37:33.289 --> 02:37:37.650]  I've got your daughter, mom tricked by AI virtual kidnapping phone scam that cloned
[02:37:37.650 --> 02:37:38.650]  daughter's voice.
[02:37:39.330 --> 02:37:42.449]  Oh, it's just a joke to call a mom and say their daughter's kidnapped.
[02:37:42.449 --> 02:37:47.050]  Probably took 10 years off her life, but it's funny for you.
[02:37:47.050 --> 02:37:49.970]  It's cute to terrorize somebody.
[02:37:49.970 --> 02:37:50.970]  It's all a joke.
[02:37:50.970 --> 02:37:54.289]  Come on, grow up.
[02:37:54.289 --> 02:37:57.850]  Have a laugh with us when you call a mother and say we've kidnapped your daughter and we're
[02:37:57.850 --> 02:37:58.850]  going to kill her.
[02:37:58.850 --> 02:37:59.850]  Come on, lady.
[02:37:59.850 --> 02:38:02.850]  Don't you have a sense of humor?
[02:38:02.850 --> 02:38:07.690]  There is on a mom recounted a harrowing experience receiving a scam AI phone call from a stranger
[02:38:07.730 --> 02:38:09.730]  that claimed to have abducted her 15-year-old daughter.
[02:38:09.730 --> 02:38:10.730]  Well, that's funny.
[02:38:10.730 --> 02:38:13.850]  I mean, by God, your daughter kidnapped.
[02:38:13.850 --> 02:38:17.289]  And then they actually played a clip of her daughter to her because they grabbed it online
[02:38:17.289 --> 02:38:18.289]  and edited it.
[02:38:18.289 --> 02:38:20.850]  I mean, what's wrong with that?
[02:38:20.850 --> 02:38:22.890]  This mom's not a party animal.
[02:38:22.890 --> 02:38:24.850]  Look at her caring about her 15-year-old.
[02:38:24.850 --> 02:38:27.650]  How dare her care about a kidnapped daughter?
[02:38:27.650 --> 02:38:30.810]  Imagine this, this selfish woman.
[02:38:30.810 --> 02:38:33.890]  Somebody's having a little fun right now.
[02:38:33.890 --> 02:38:41.330]  I pick up the phone and I hear my daughter's voice and it says, mom, and she's sobbing.
[02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:44.090]  The mother told a ZF family dot com.
[02:38:44.090 --> 02:38:45.650]  I said, what happened?
[02:38:45.650 --> 02:38:48.010]  And she said, mom, I messed up.
[02:38:48.010 --> 02:38:49.570]  And she's sobbing and crying.
[02:38:49.570 --> 02:38:52.170]  Oh, isn't that funny?
[02:38:52.170 --> 02:38:53.410]  Then I hear a man's voice.
[02:38:53.410 --> 02:38:56.250]  Put your head back by down.
[02:38:56.250 --> 02:38:57.490]  And I'm like, what?
[02:38:57.490 --> 02:38:58.490]  What's going on?
[02:38:58.490 --> 02:39:02.890]  The man gets on the phone and says, he's like, listen here, I've got your daughter.
[02:39:02.890 --> 02:39:04.850]  Isn't this funny?
[02:39:04.850 --> 02:39:07.930]  This is how it's going to go down.
[02:39:07.930 --> 02:39:09.369]  You call the police.
[02:39:09.369 --> 02:39:10.369]  You call anybody.
[02:39:10.369 --> 02:39:12.529]  I'm going to pop her so full of drugs.
[02:39:12.529 --> 02:39:17.170]  I'm going to have my way with her and I'm going to drop her off in Mexico, which is
[02:39:17.170 --> 02:39:18.490]  really going on.
[02:39:18.490 --> 02:39:21.010]  And at the same moment, I've just started shaking.
[02:39:21.010 --> 02:39:22.010]  I'm in the background.
[02:39:22.010 --> 02:39:24.130]  She's going, help me, mom, please help me.
[02:39:24.130 --> 02:39:25.130]  Help me.
[02:39:25.130 --> 02:39:26.130]  I'm bawling.
[02:39:26.130 --> 02:39:27.410]  Isn't that funny?
[02:39:27.410 --> 02:39:30.449]  Just like what Frank Stallone did.
[02:39:30.449 --> 02:39:31.449]  Frank Stallone.
[02:39:31.770 --> 02:39:33.610]  I mean, why isn't she laughing?
[02:39:33.610 --> 02:39:34.610]  I've got your daughter.
[02:39:34.610 --> 02:39:35.610]  I'm going to rape her.
[02:39:35.610 --> 02:39:36.610]  I'm going to kill her.
[02:39:36.610 --> 02:39:40.890]  I mean, this mom is a bad person.
[02:39:40.890 --> 02:39:46.810]  The mom, Jennifer DeStanfo, said in the incident was all the more terrifying as one of the
[02:39:46.810 --> 02:39:49.449]  people on the call sounded exactly like her daughter.
[02:39:49.449 --> 02:39:54.289]  Well, see, you just don't know how to laugh, lady.
[02:39:54.289 --> 02:39:56.810]  It was never a question of who it was, who this is.
[02:39:56.810 --> 02:39:58.190]  It was completely her voice.
[02:39:58.190 --> 02:39:59.770]  It was her inflection.
[02:39:59.770 --> 02:40:01.210]  It was the way she would have cried.
[02:40:01.970 --> 02:40:04.369]  She said, I never doubted for a second it was her.
[02:40:04.369 --> 02:40:07.449]  That's the freaky part that really got to my core.
[02:40:07.449 --> 02:40:08.449]  Yeah.
[02:40:08.449 --> 02:40:09.449]  I get a call.
[02:40:09.449 --> 02:40:10.449]  It's Tucker Carlson's number.
[02:40:10.449 --> 02:40:11.570]  It sounds just like him.
[02:40:11.570 --> 02:40:14.730]  You never, you know, online, it could be a lie, but not on your phone.
[02:40:14.730 --> 02:40:15.970]  You don't expect to get that call.
[02:40:15.970 --> 02:40:19.730]  Especially, I just talked to Tucker the day before on the phone.
[02:40:19.730 --> 02:40:21.810]  I'm like, I don't have a million dollars.
[02:40:21.810 --> 02:40:22.850]  Just don't hurt my daughter.
[02:40:22.850 --> 02:40:23.850]  She begged.
[02:40:23.850 --> 02:40:24.850]  Then he wanted 50,000.
[02:40:24.850 --> 02:40:29.850]  She didn't know at the time, had fallen victim to a virtual kidnapping scam.
[02:40:29.850 --> 02:40:33.930]  The scam involves AI-generated voices trained through deep learning technology, the virtually
[02:40:33.930 --> 02:40:38.529]  cloned voices of a loved one, and the other person claiming to have kidnapped them, demanding
[02:40:38.529 --> 02:40:44.449]  a ransom with a family member, safe return.
[02:40:44.449 --> 02:40:50.570]  You can no longer trust your ears, explained Arizona State University computer science professor.
[02:40:50.570 --> 02:40:55.410]  But I mean, again, the real villains, this mom, she hears her daughter crying, being raped,
[02:40:55.410 --> 02:40:56.410]  begging for her life.
[02:40:56.410 --> 02:40:58.449]  They threatened to kill her with drugs.
[02:40:58.449 --> 02:41:03.810]  This mom is not cool like Frank Stallone.
[02:41:03.810 --> 02:41:08.330]  She's not with the program of the fun.
[02:41:08.330 --> 02:41:09.770]  She's not cool.
[02:41:09.770 --> 02:41:10.770]  You know what I mean?
[02:41:10.770 --> 02:41:18.650]  I'm going to stay at my post till the end of this, but the banks are all imploding.
[02:41:18.650 --> 02:41:19.970]  World War III has begun.
[02:41:19.970 --> 02:41:24.690]  The borders are wide open and all these trendy liberals are running around having fun, all
[02:41:24.690 --> 02:41:29.449]  thinking about themselves, all playing games, and the whole system's over.
[02:41:29.449 --> 02:41:32.930]  It's over, game over, boys and girls.
[02:41:32.930 --> 02:41:35.670]  At the end, we'll find God.
[02:41:35.670 --> 02:41:38.150]  At the end, we'll come together.
[02:41:38.150 --> 02:41:43.970]  But these kidnapping scams reportedly happened to more than 8,000 people, according to the
[02:41:43.970 --> 02:41:46.330]  FBI, in just the last year.
[02:41:46.330 --> 02:41:51.010]  But it's just a joke.
[02:41:51.010 --> 02:41:52.650]  We're raping your daughter.
[02:41:52.650 --> 02:41:54.150]  She is begging for help.
[02:41:54.150 --> 02:41:55.150]  It's funny.
[02:41:55.150 --> 02:41:56.150]  It sounds just like her.
[02:41:56.150 --> 02:41:57.150]  It's funny.
[02:41:57.150 --> 02:42:00.150]  We're liberal.
[02:42:00.150 --> 02:42:02.750]  We're just having fun.
[02:42:02.750 --> 02:42:05.230]  It's just a joke.
[02:42:05.230 --> 02:42:07.750]  It's just a game.
[02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:12.449]  Yeah, it's real funny, isn't it?
[02:42:12.449 --> 02:42:14.029]  And this is just the beginning.
[02:42:14.029 --> 02:42:28.230]  Because now the scum of the earth, like Frank Stallone, has access to this.
[02:42:28.230 --> 02:42:32.110]  And all the judges and the lawyers that have gone along with the system, and all the bureaucrats
[02:42:32.110 --> 02:42:34.750]  think they're part of the power structure, they're going to protect it.
[02:42:34.750 --> 02:42:36.210]  None of you are protected.
[02:42:36.210 --> 02:42:40.270]  It's all about to be washed away by your own evil.
[02:42:40.270 --> 02:42:44.869]  And I guess, in a way, that's kind of a good thing.
[02:42:44.869 --> 02:42:46.990]  Only the Holy Spirit can carry us through this.
[02:42:46.990 --> 02:42:51.550]  I've got some final news to hit, ahead of the great, one of my favorite talk show hosts,
[02:42:51.550 --> 02:42:53.869]  Peter Hernandez, taking over in the fourth hour.
[02:42:53.869 --> 02:42:54.869]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:54.869 --> 02:42:55.869]  Stay with us.
[02:42:55.869 --> 02:43:02.869]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[02:43:02.869 --> 02:43:04.550]  in plain view.
[02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:07.310]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[02:43:07.310 --> 02:43:11.590]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website, where they admit the number
[02:43:11.590 --> 02:43:16.830]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[02:43:16.830 --> 02:43:24.110]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[02:43:24.110 --> 02:43:30.430]  the body, as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[02:43:30.430 --> 02:43:35.990]  Upwards of two billion people, in a Lancet Medical Journal study, in 2007, worldwide
[02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:40.470]  have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high-quality iodine.
[02:43:40.470 --> 02:43:42.710]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:48.190]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine, together, that supercharges your body.
[02:43:48.190 --> 02:43:50.630]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:54.390]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[02:43:54.390 --> 02:43:55.750]  X3, back in stock.
[02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:56.750]  Take action now.
[02:43:56.750 --> 02:43:57.750]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:43:57.750 --> 02:44:04.670]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:44:04.670 --> 02:44:06.670]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:07.670]  It is.
[02:44:07.670 --> 02:44:12.150]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:44:12.150 --> 02:44:15.350]  The fish oil's better than it, and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:44:15.350 --> 02:44:21.029]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[02:44:21.029 --> 02:44:24.630]  Krill oils is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm just sorry.
[02:44:24.630 --> 02:44:26.550]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[02:44:26.550 --> 02:44:29.630]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[02:44:29.630 --> 02:44:31.869]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[02:44:31.869 --> 02:44:38.110]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:44:38.110 --> 02:44:45.630]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:44:45.630 --> 02:44:49.070]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever
[02:44:49.070 --> 02:44:51.430]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:44:51.430 --> 02:44:54.430]  I just can't do it.
[02:44:54.430 --> 02:44:58.750]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:44:58.750 --> 02:45:04.550]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTore.com
[02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:08.350]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system
[02:45:08.350 --> 02:45:10.390]  and your body, and keep us on air.
[02:45:10.390 --> 02:45:15.230]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in,
[02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:18.949]  many of you for years, and never gone to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:45:18.949 --> 02:45:24.470]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsTore.com
[02:45:24.470 --> 02:45:27.789]  and never experience these great products, and never find the operation.
[02:45:27.789 --> 02:45:31.230]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show, that's great
[02:45:31.230 --> 02:45:32.230]  and I thank you.
[02:45:32.230 --> 02:45:36.310]  But we need funds to operate, plus we've got really great products that do amazing things
[02:45:36.310 --> 02:45:40.350]  for people like our CBD oil, and our fizzy magnesium, and our sleep aid, and our nitric
[02:45:40.350 --> 02:45:44.390]  oxide, and our real red pill, plus all of these are really great products that keep
[02:45:44.390 --> 02:45:46.830]  us on air, plus you're missing out on having these products.
[02:45:46.830 --> 02:45:52.110]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTore.com right
[02:45:52.110 --> 02:45:55.750]  now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:45:58.310 --> 02:46:02.590]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[02:46:02.590 --> 02:46:04.270]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[02:46:04.270 --> 02:46:06.949]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[02:46:06.949 --> 02:46:08.670]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[02:46:08.670 --> 02:46:11.630]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[02:46:11.630 --> 02:46:14.830]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[02:46:14.830 --> 02:46:16.630]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:22.350]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like
[02:46:22.350 --> 02:46:23.350]  Joe Rogan.
[02:46:23.350 --> 02:46:26.990]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[02:46:26.990 --> 02:46:28.910]  And when you support us, we are unstoppable.
[02:46:28.910 --> 02:46:33.550]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:37.430]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[02:46:37.430 --> 02:46:40.830]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage your listeners to understand, please
[02:46:40.830 --> 02:46:43.190]  don't take InfoWars for granted.
[02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:44.470]  We're barely hanging on.
[02:46:44.470 --> 02:46:47.869]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support, while getting great
[02:46:47.869 --> 02:46:50.230]  products at the same time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:50.230 --> 02:46:51.230]  So don't procrastinate.
[02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:56.230]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air, and never submit to
[02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:57.270]  these tyrants.
[02:47:06.600 --> 02:47:21.800]  Hey, let me tell the little prankster, prankster loan something, Tucker Carlson's lawyers are
[02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:24.320]  involved in what you did, we believe is a crime.
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:27.520]  So I think even though you think you're safe up in Canada, you're getting arrested for what
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:28.520]  you did yesterday.
[02:47:28.520 --> 02:47:31.960]  So keep laughing, you little arrogant person.
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:32.960]  And give me your best.
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:35.360]  Leak my phone number everywhere, attack us more.
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:38.800]  You mess with the wrong people, son.
[02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:44.320]  You mess with the wrong people, punk.
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:47.480]  But I think somebody that calls up a mother, he didn't do this, somebody else does, it's
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:48.480]  all over the place.
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:52.080]  Calls up a mother and has an AI generated voice of their daughter because they get the
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:53.080]  daughter's voice offline.
[02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:56.800]  And then type in the script, they want the AI creature, Mommy, help me, they're killing
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:47:59.280]  me, they're raping me, Mommy, help me.
[02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:01.200]  I got your daughter right now, I'm going to kill her.
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:02.200]  I'm going to rape her.
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:03.560]  Please don't kill my daughter.
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:09.120]  And they're just doing it to harass and terrorize the mother and hope she wires $50,000 to them
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:12.640]  and they think this is funny.
[02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:15.640]  The gloves are off, guys.
[02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:22.400]  In fact, I'm going to file a criminal complaint because what you did to me is nothing compared
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:26.700]  to these women with their daughters and sons, but it's the same crap.
[02:48:26.700 --> 02:48:30.680]  You don't get to steal our phone numbers and pose as us and then in our voices say things
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:32.440]  we never said.
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:35.360]  We need to punish these people, they need to be dealt with.
[02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:38.240]  I call for him to be arrested now.
[02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:46.540]  How would the police like if I copied your voice from a press conference and then started
[02:48:46.540 --> 02:48:53.060]  calling up prominent people with the police chief saying he wants to commit crimes?
[02:48:53.060 --> 02:48:54.060]  That's a crime.
[02:48:54.060 --> 02:49:02.620]  That's not defamation, ladies and gentlemen, that's identity theft.
[02:49:02.620 --> 02:49:05.660]  And I called that piece of garbage today, and he didn't call me back, but he called
[02:49:05.660 --> 02:49:06.660]  my producer back.
[02:49:06.820 --> 02:49:10.540]  I gave her the number, and she came in here during the break, and he laughed at me and
[02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:11.540]  thought it was funny.
[02:49:11.540 --> 02:49:17.620]  We'll see how funny you think it is now, because I'm going to push to get your ass put in jail.
[02:49:17.620 --> 02:49:21.740]  So keep laughing, you sociopath.
[02:49:21.900 --> 02:49:36.660]  The global worldwide AI expert just quit Google and said it's going to destroy
[02:49:36.660 --> 02:49:44.180]  civilization. And it's just started. You think we have a problem of lies now
[02:49:44.180 --> 02:49:49.460]  with mainstream media? You think we have a problem with the police being called
[02:49:49.460 --> 02:49:57.060]  innocent people with swatting? This is nothing. And they're doing it on purpose.
[02:49:57.060 --> 02:50:01.380]  So when all the video of Jeffrey Epstein raping kids comes out, and all this
[02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:06.100]  evidence comes out, they say, oh that's AI, oh that's deepfake, oh that's why this
[02:50:06.100 --> 02:50:12.020]  happened. We have to get a hold on this crap right now and eradicate it right
[02:50:12.020 --> 02:50:17.660]  now. It has to be dealt with right now. Not tomorrow, not next week, not next year.
[02:50:17.660 --> 02:50:29.260]  Now, now, now, now, now, now. It needs to be dealt with last year, ten years ago, yesterday, not tomorrow.
[02:50:30.700 --> 02:50:32.860]  They attack our humanity.
[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:38.280]  They got your phone number, they spoof your friend,
[02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:42.360]  someone you admire, someone you're a confidant of,
[02:50:43.580 --> 02:50:45.620]  and then they call you up and say horrible,
[02:50:45.620 --> 02:50:49.420]  sexual things to you, posing as that person,
[02:50:49.420 --> 02:50:52.020]  and you're supposed to sit there,
[02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:54.540]  and you're supposed to take it like it's funny.
[02:50:54.540 --> 02:50:57.680]  I guess this mom, with them saying they kidnapped
[02:50:57.680 --> 02:50:59.580]  her daughter and were going to kill her,
[02:50:59.580 --> 02:51:03.080]  she wouldn't, she'd have a sense of humor.
[02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:06.600]  Because this guy's never going to have kids.
[02:51:06.600 --> 02:51:08.280]  This guy's never going to know what that's like.
[02:51:08.280 --> 02:51:10.000]  It's all funny to him.
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.280]  We gave him a chance.
[02:51:12.280 --> 02:51:15.200]  One chance, buddy, and you failed.
[02:51:15.200 --> 02:51:17.020]  You showed the wind.
[02:51:17.020 --> 02:51:20.600]  You now reap the whirlwind.
[02:51:20.600 --> 02:51:24.000]  I hope God brings you to justice.
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:31.160]  Man, I've got a bunch of other news I haven't hit and during it, as always, who's my favorite
[02:51:31.160 --> 02:51:32.160]  preacher?
[02:51:32.160 --> 02:51:34.520]  He's an adorned, ordained pastor.
[02:51:34.520 --> 02:51:35.520]  Great talk show host.
[02:51:35.520 --> 02:51:36.520]  He's all right.
[02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:37.520]  He's coming up.
[02:51:37.520 --> 02:51:41.040]  Look, I could tell you a lot of stuff behind the scenes.
[02:51:41.040 --> 02:51:43.440]  We've never been more effective in battling the enemy.
[02:51:43.440 --> 02:51:44.440]  We've never been more influential.
[02:51:44.440 --> 02:51:47.940]  Thanks for your support, us together, all of us.
[02:51:47.940 --> 02:51:51.160]  But the nastiness, the dirty tricks, all of it has gone to a whole other level, which
[02:51:51.160 --> 02:51:52.160]  I'm fine with.
[02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:53.160]  I signed on to this.
[02:51:53.160 --> 02:51:54.640]  I'm a big boy.
[02:51:54.640 --> 02:51:59.160]  But I really need your prayer, and I really need your word of mouth, because I didn't
[02:51:59.160 --> 02:52:00.160]  do this to lose.
[02:52:00.160 --> 02:52:04.240]  I used to share the articles, share the videos, take clips out of the show, post them everywhere.
[02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:06.120]  It's all copyright free, free to air.
[02:52:06.120 --> 02:52:09.400]  I get so many emails every day, can I take a clip out of your show?
[02:52:09.400 --> 02:52:13.280]  Can I paint Infowars on my barn or on your truck?
[02:52:13.280 --> 02:52:16.240]  No, you just can't get authorization.
[02:52:16.240 --> 02:52:19.200]  You got me begging you to do it.
[02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:20.820]  You don't have me giving you authorization.
[02:52:20.820 --> 02:52:25.800]  You got me on my freaking knees begging you to take action in the Infowar.
[02:52:25.800 --> 02:52:31.200]  You got me on my belly.
[02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:36.640]  There's nothing more angering to get the daily contacts, because you're such conservatives,
[02:52:36.640 --> 02:52:40.720]  you're such libertarians, you're such patriots, you're such respecters of people that you won't
[02:52:40.720 --> 02:52:44.160]  even promote our information because you think I may not want it.
[02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:47.720]  I'm not doing this to lose.
[02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:51.000]  I'm not swinging for the fences because I believe we're going to fail.
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:52.120]  I know we're going to win.
[02:52:52.120 --> 02:52:56.440]  What I've seen with limited effort, victory in our day.
[02:52:57.600 --> 02:53:01.600]  But I need your support.
[02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:14.600]  We have products you need.
[02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:17.600]  They're excellent.
[02:53:17.600 --> 02:53:23.600]  BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra, TurboForce back in stock,
[02:53:23.600 --> 02:53:26.600]  Ultima Krylo back in stock, and finally X3.
[02:53:26.600 --> 02:53:27.600]  The ultimate triad.
[02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:29.600]  There's such amazing things for your body back in stock.
[02:53:29.600 --> 02:53:32.600]  25% off at FullWarStore.com.
[02:53:32.600 --> 02:53:34.600]  And go there.
[02:53:34.600 --> 02:53:38.600]  I support the broadcast, but wherever I go, whatever I do,
[02:53:38.600 --> 02:53:40.600]  just know that I could be homeless.
[02:53:40.600 --> 02:53:42.600]  I'll be on the street corner, speaking the truth.
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:45.600]  I'm never going to shut up, but I can only magnify what I'm doing
[02:53:45.600 --> 02:53:47.600]  thanks to your support.
[02:53:47.600 --> 02:53:50.600]  So I want to encourage you all to magnify what we're doing today
[02:53:50.600 --> 02:53:52.600]  and to not take this broadcast for granted
[02:53:52.600 --> 02:53:58.600]  because the forces of evil are in overdrive to shut us down right now.
[02:53:58.600 --> 02:54:00.600]  So I'll tell you, every day we're on air is precious.
[02:54:00.600 --> 02:54:06.600]  I know I certainly do.
[02:54:06.600 --> 02:54:09.600]  So it could be your last chance to get an InfoWars t-shirt
[02:54:09.600 --> 02:54:12.600]  or the Great Reset and the War for the World book signed or unsigned.
[02:54:12.600 --> 02:54:17.600]  It could be your last chance to get X3 or TurboForce
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:20.600]  because things are so bad, things are so insane.
[02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:22.600]  We're so deep into the banking collapse.
[02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:27.600]  We're so deep into World War III that lesser men who know what's going on
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:29.600]  would have already run to the southern hemisphere.
[02:54:29.600 --> 02:54:35.600]  I spend every bit of my energy not to pack up and go to Chile years ago.
[02:54:35.600 --> 02:54:39.600]  And Chile ain't perfect, but it's below the main radiation zone.
[02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:42.600]  But I choose not to die there.
[02:54:42.600 --> 02:54:46.600]  I choose to fight here.
[02:54:46.600 --> 02:54:48.600]  I'm going to go down with the ship.
[02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:51.600]  I keep trying to explain to you, you better get right with Jesus
[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:55.600]  and you better get your head right because you're not in Kansas anymore
[02:54:55.600 --> 02:54:57.600]  and you were never in Kansas City.
[02:54:57.600 --> 02:55:00.600]  You were never in Kansas.
[02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:02.600]  You were never in La La Land.
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:03.600]  You were never in Fantasy World.
[02:55:03.600 --> 02:55:06.600]  You were in the New World Order.
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:10.600]  And we're here right now together experiencing this
[02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:13.600]  with the worst people on the planet who don't even care about their futures,
[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:19.600]  completely out of control, taking over society.
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:20.600]  We've abandoned good.
[02:55:20.600 --> 02:55:22.600]  We've abandoned God.
[02:55:22.600 --> 02:55:25.600]  But like a person thrown overboard, we can find that driftwood.
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:27.600]  We can find that barrel.
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:31.600]  We can find that floating piece of debris and stay on it
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:32.600]  and hopefully get to land.
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:35.600]  Or you can just gulp water down and go down to the bottom.
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:38.600]  You can just serve Satan and decide to submit to it all
[02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:40.600]  and just think it's all a big damn joke
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:45.600]  and party in the last days of civilization.
[02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:50.600]  But World War III has already begun.
[02:55:50.600 --> 02:55:53.600]  And there's all these people that don't realize that
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:54.600]  and keep going along with the system.
[02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:58.600]  They're going to find out very, very soon.
[02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:01.600]  So I take every day as if it's my last.
[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:02.600]  And I hope I'm here tomorrow.
[02:56:02.600 --> 02:56:04.600]  I hope I'm here next year.
[02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:06.600]  But let me tell you, the things are so dire.
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:07.600]  Things are moving so quick.
[02:56:07.600 --> 02:56:14.600]  Behind the scenes, the attacks are so grievous that this could be it.
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:19.600]  And those that serve Satan believe that as soon as they've extinguished the good,
[02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:23.600]  their utopia begins.
[02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:25.600]  But their utopia does not begin.
[02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:27.600]  They tear up the Bible and desecrate God
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:32.600]  and try to bring their tyranny into fruition.
[02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:34.600]  These are the losers.
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:36.600]  These are the failures.
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:40.600]  And don't ever think because they've got Hollywood and the power structure behind them
[02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:42.600]  that they are the annoyed ones.
[02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:44.600]  They are the cursed ones.
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:49.600]  They are an abomination desolation.
[02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:51.600]  Abomination desolation.
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:54.600]  What I'm looking for is they are anathemy.
[02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:56.600]  They are anathemy.
[02:56:56.600 --> 02:56:59.600]  That means totally in separation from God.
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:01.600]  And you don't want to be part of that.
[02:57:01.600 --> 02:57:06.600]  You don't want to be part of that annihilation desolation.
[02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:08.600]  Abomination desolation.
[02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:12.600]  You want to be separate from these people and their works and everything they do
[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:14.600]  that is pure poison.
[02:57:14.600 --> 02:57:18.600]  All right, Drew Hernandez is set to take over.
[02:57:18.600 --> 02:57:20.600]  Hopefully I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central.
[02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:21.600]  I don't know if I will be.
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:23.600]  I really don't, folks.
[02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:25.600]  I may be gone forever, any day now.
[02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:27.600]  You need to know that's how serious the situation is.
[02:57:27.600 --> 02:57:29.600]  Nukes could rain down tomorrow.
[02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:31.600]  New bioweapons could be released next week.
[02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:34.600]  Banks could all fail in a month.
[02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:36.600]  That's where we are.
[02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:41.600]  But at the end of the day, the North Star is Christ and God.
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:42.600]  Hour number four with Drew Hernandez.
[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:43.600]  Straight ahead.
[02:57:43.600 --> 02:57:44.600]  Stay with us.
[02:57:45.700 --> 02:57:51.020]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[02:57:51.020 --> 02:57:53.100]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[02:57:53.100 --> 02:57:55.140]  It will change your life.
[02:57:55.140 --> 02:57:59.780]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have
[02:57:59.780 --> 02:58:03.840]  mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[02:58:03.840 --> 02:58:09.380]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:58:09.380 --> 02:58:15.100]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[02:58:15.100 --> 02:58:19.420]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[02:58:19.420 --> 02:58:25.500]  And Infowarestore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[02:58:25.500 --> 02:58:26.500]  effect.
[02:58:26.500 --> 02:58:29.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[02:58:29.500 --> 02:58:32.460]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[02:58:32.460 --> 02:58:35.500]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[02:58:35.500 --> 02:58:37.700]  This ladies and gentlemen is powerful.
[02:58:37.700 --> 02:58:39.020]  You and your family need it.
[02:58:39.020 --> 02:58:41.220]  It's 25% off back in stock.

[02:58:45.540 --> 02:58:46.540]  Take action now.
[02:58:46.540 --> 02:58:48.420]  But regardless, research is info.
[02:58:48.420 --> 02:58:50.100]  Turbo Force is back.
[02:58:50.100 --> 02:58:53.220]  Sold out for eight months and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[02:58:53.220 --> 02:58:55.380]  We made it even stronger.
[02:58:55.380 --> 02:58:59.300]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:58:59.300 --> 02:59:06.020]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:06.020 --> 02:59:12.100]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[02:59:12.100 --> 02:59:14.180]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:59:14.180 --> 02:59:19.660]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[02:59:19.660 --> 02:59:24.540]  that turbo charge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you
[02:59:24.540 --> 02:59:25.540]  name it.
[02:59:25.540 --> 02:59:29.220]  It is the super fuel.
[02:59:29.220 --> 02:59:30.700]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[02:59:30.700 --> 02:59:31.700]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[02:59:31.700 --> 02:59:32.700]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:59:32.700 --> 02:59:33.700]  They go good with this.
[02:59:33.700 --> 02:59:36.580]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:59:36.580 --> 02:59:37.580]  This is the boss.
[02:59:37.580 --> 02:59:49.980]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, Infowarestore.com, more power, more strength, more energy.
[02:59:49.980 --> 02:59:56.060]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:03.700 --> 03:00:20.100]  Here we are on the verge of World War III.
[03:00:20.100 --> 03:00:21.380]  The border is collapsing.
[03:00:21.380 --> 03:00:24.220]  It's already collapsed, United States of America.
[03:00:24.220 --> 03:00:28.700]  There is no southern border any longer with the replacement migration.
[03:00:28.700 --> 03:00:32.760]  The changing of the demographics, the changing of the culture, the changing of what America
[03:00:32.820 --> 03:00:34.600]  truly is.
[03:00:34.600 --> 03:00:41.480]  With the pedophilia and the grooming getting normalized on a daily basis, you see the absolute
[03:00:41.480 --> 03:00:47.560]  deterioration of any kind of moral code, which is all by design.
[03:00:47.560 --> 03:00:55.800]  You see all these things coming to full culmination to the very end of what we know is to come.
[03:00:55.800 --> 03:00:59.000]  Where lawlessness is going to abound and you're watching the defund of the police.
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:00.520]  You're watching riots in the streets.
[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:03.600]  You're watching the dismantling of the United States of America.
[03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:10.800]  You're watching law and order get absolutely dismantled, raped and thrown away in the trash.
[03:01:10.800 --> 03:01:16.040]  You're seeing basic biology get absolutely perverted and distorted.
[03:01:16.040 --> 03:01:21.520]  Can't identify what a basic male is, can't identify what a basic female is without freaking
[03:01:21.520 --> 03:01:27.640]  triggering some woke loser with rainbow hair and them crawling to their safe space and
[03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:31.800]  threatening to sue you because you said something that hurt their feelings.
[03:01:31.800 --> 03:01:38.880]  You talk about a hyper-feminized society where you can't say anything that offends anyone
[03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:41.220]  because it's true.
[03:01:41.220 --> 03:01:47.360]  You see the absolute Luciferian satanic occult sacrifice of babies.
[03:01:47.360 --> 03:01:53.140]  They call it abortion and health care for women and women's rights on a daily basis.
[03:01:53.140 --> 03:01:58.660]  These blood occult rituals that you see on a daily basis, the attack on the nuclear family,
[03:01:58.660 --> 03:02:07.660]  the rise in communism, the mainstream rise in communism, globalism, obviously socialism.
[03:02:07.660 --> 03:02:16.300]  But the absolute showdown between the devil, the antichrist, Jesus Christ, God himself,
[03:02:16.300 --> 03:02:17.780]  it is globalism.
[03:02:17.780 --> 03:02:19.460]  It is the new world order.
[03:02:19.460 --> 03:02:27.260]  It's every type of tyranny or tyrannical thought or ideology that is meant to withhold
[03:02:27.260 --> 03:02:31.180]  power and secure power and rule over the people.
[03:02:31.180 --> 03:02:39.100]  The absolute culmination will be the antichrist in the end, total tyranny, worldwide domination,
[03:02:39.100 --> 03:02:45.300]  one world economy, one world militarized system, one world leader all empowered by Satan.
[03:02:45.300 --> 03:02:49.260]  Now it's interesting when you sit here and you say those things and you hear those things
[03:02:49.260 --> 03:02:53.980]  and you're like, that sounds kind of familiar.
[03:02:53.980 --> 03:02:58.860]  The Bible talks about what Jesus said in the last days when the disciples asked him, what's
[03:02:58.860 --> 03:03:00.580]  it going to be like?
[03:03:00.580 --> 03:03:03.780]  What's it really going to be like when the end comes?
[03:03:03.780 --> 03:03:08.780]  Wars and rumors of wars, pestilences, earthquakes, natural disasters, mass instability, kingdoms
[03:03:08.780 --> 03:03:11.540]  against kingdoms, nations against nations.
[03:03:11.540 --> 03:03:12.900]  That's actually not just countries.
[03:03:12.900 --> 03:03:15.780]  Those are race wars, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:03:15.780 --> 03:03:19.660]  Race wars will rise also in the end.
[03:03:19.660 --> 03:03:24.060]  Is this starting to sound familiar to you, how everything in the United States is white
[03:03:24.060 --> 03:03:28.420]  supremacist and racist and they're turning everyone against each other?
[03:03:28.420 --> 03:03:32.140]  They're attempting to turn everyone against white people.
[03:03:32.140 --> 03:03:33.980]  I'm not white.
[03:03:33.980 --> 03:03:37.820]  There's nothing wrong with being white, but I don't like what's happening to my whites
[03:03:37.820 --> 03:03:38.820]  out there.
[03:03:38.820 --> 03:03:39.820]  I don't.
[03:03:39.820 --> 03:03:43.340]  They're being demonized just like the Nazis demonize Jews.
[03:03:43.340 --> 03:03:45.100]  Let's just come out and say it.
[03:03:45.100 --> 03:03:50.660]  The way the Nazis demonize Jews is how the New World Order and the so-called Left and
[03:03:50.660 --> 03:03:57.100]  Uniparty with all of their anti-white, white supremacy, this, white nationalism, this,
[03:03:57.100 --> 03:04:02.860]  all this garbage, all it does is slander and slap a label over anyone that they want to
[03:04:02.860 --> 03:04:07.940]  shut down and it's to demonize their targets.
[03:04:07.940 --> 03:04:14.620]  It's to dehumanize their targets, to de-voice them, de-platform them, de-power them and
[03:04:14.620 --> 03:04:18.420]  make them and render them absolute powerless.
[03:04:18.420 --> 03:04:22.860]  This is why they even call black people white supremacists.
[03:04:22.860 --> 03:04:27.740]  This is why they even call me a white supremacist because of what I just said, because I'm going
[03:04:27.740 --> 03:04:32.740]  to sit here and defend a group of people that are obviously getting demonized.
[03:04:32.740 --> 03:04:35.780]  When black people get demonized, I will call it out.
[03:04:35.780 --> 03:04:36.780]  Brown people, you name it.
[03:04:36.780 --> 03:04:37.780]  I'm a Christian.
[03:04:37.780 --> 03:04:41.820]  It is my responsibility to call out evil whenever I see it.
[03:04:41.820 --> 03:04:46.180]  It's not only a responsibility, it's a conviction within me and you should have it too if you
[03:04:46.180 --> 03:04:47.180]  claim to be a Christian.
[03:04:47.180 --> 03:04:53.060]  And speaking of race wars, this whole Jordan Neely thing out of New York is about to pop
[03:04:53.060 --> 03:04:54.060]  off.
[03:04:54.060 --> 03:04:55.060]  George Floyd 2.0 is here.
[03:04:55.060 --> 03:04:56.060]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:56.060 --> 03:05:12.740]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements
[03:05:12.740 --> 03:05:15.380]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[03:05:15.380 --> 03:05:17.340]  So support Infowars store.
[03:05:17.340 --> 03:05:21.820]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know.
[03:05:21.820 --> 03:05:22.820]  I don't know.
[03:05:22.820 --> 03:05:26.100]  They're telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[03:05:26.100 --> 03:05:30.820]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[03:05:30.820 --> 03:05:31.820]  Krill oil.
[03:05:31.820 --> 03:05:37.820]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[03:05:37.820 --> 03:05:39.420]  that will keep you alive.
[03:05:39.420 --> 03:05:43.340]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional
[03:05:43.340 --> 03:05:45.740]  supplements, but the day will come.
[03:05:45.740 --> 03:05:49.740]  Vitamin C and zinc absolutely imperative for the cold DNA force.
[03:05:50.540 --> 03:05:51.540]  Mineral fusion.
[03:05:51.540 --> 03:05:52.540]  Absolutely.
[03:05:52.540 --> 03:05:55.580]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[03:05:55.580 --> 03:06:02.540]  You have to have these products.
[03:06:02.540 --> 03:06:06.580]  It's very clear what's happening not only to the United States of America, but what's happening
[03:06:06.580 --> 03:06:08.620]  happening to humanity worldwide.
[03:06:08.620 --> 03:06:14.020]  The dismantling of culture, the dismantling of national sovereignty with the concepts
[03:06:14.020 --> 03:06:19.620]  of globalism and the New World Order, the dismantling of the family unit, the dismantling
[03:06:19.620 --> 03:06:24.820]  of parents, the parental system and apparatus that God has designed for human beings in
[03:06:24.820 --> 03:06:29.820]  order to thrive and raise and have families, the dismantling of gender roles, sex roles
[03:06:29.820 --> 03:06:32.940]  for basic biology and procreation.
[03:06:32.940 --> 03:06:35.540]  I mean, that's kind of simple to understand.
[03:06:35.540 --> 03:06:41.740]  But here we are in 2023, where all of that is racist, white supremacist, Nazi, anti-Semitic,
[03:06:41.740 --> 03:06:44.180]  misogynist, sexist, you name it.
[03:06:44.180 --> 03:06:45.180]  Right.
[03:06:45.180 --> 03:06:46.180]  Anything.
[03:06:46.180 --> 03:06:48.420]  Listen, this stuff doesn't mean anything anymore.
[03:06:48.420 --> 03:06:49.420]  It's all right.
[03:06:50.220 --> 03:06:52.700]  It's all this nonsense.
[03:06:52.700 --> 03:06:56.300]  It's just a label they will slap over you just to shut you down and shut you up and
[03:06:56.300 --> 03:07:00.420]  make it look like you have leprosy so you cannot be dealt with or touched.
[03:07:00.420 --> 03:07:05.860]  No one can come in proximity with you because you are saying things that go against the
[03:07:05.860 --> 03:07:07.500]  absolute narrative.
[03:07:07.500 --> 03:07:13.460]  Now, I'm telling you, man, this this George Floyd 2.0 is here.
[03:07:13.460 --> 03:07:14.460]  You guys.
[03:07:14.460 --> 03:07:15.460]  It is here.
[03:07:15.460 --> 03:07:16.460]  All right.
[03:07:16.740 --> 03:07:20.180]  If you have not been paying attention to what's happening in New York, you should, because
[03:07:20.180 --> 03:07:24.300]  I think that the New World Order, the Democrat Party and the United Party, I think they have
[03:07:24.300 --> 03:07:31.800]  found their black martyr every every election cycle, especially presidential election cycles.
[03:07:31.800 --> 03:07:33.660]  They get their black martyr.
[03:07:33.660 --> 03:07:38.500]  They get that black community weaponized and mobilized to push their agenda.
[03:07:38.500 --> 03:07:41.220]  They do it every single election cycle.
[03:07:41.220 --> 03:07:42.300]  Last one was who?
[03:07:42.300 --> 03:07:43.420]  It was George Floyd.
[03:07:43.420 --> 03:07:45.620]  They do this every single cycle.
[03:07:45.780 --> 03:07:52.380]  And now it is this absolute maniac, OK, that that was violent.
[03:07:52.380 --> 03:07:53.380]  That was violent.
[03:07:53.380 --> 03:07:54.780]  Jordan Neely.
[03:07:54.780 --> 03:08:02.380]  OK, so his death, this guy was choked out in a subway in New York because he was, quote,
[03:08:02.380 --> 03:08:04.980]  being violent, intimidating.
[03:08:04.980 --> 03:08:10.420]  He was claiming that he was ready to die and he's ready to go back to jail and he's willing
[03:08:10.420 --> 03:08:13.420]  to hurt anyone on the subway train.
[03:08:13.500 --> 03:08:21.980]  OK, very threatening behavior, very threatening words on a train in New York, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:08:21.980 --> 03:08:27.260]  OK, on a train in Ground Zero 9-11 New York.
[03:08:27.260 --> 03:08:33.220]  So people in New York are going to be a little on edge if you show up on a subway train saying
[03:08:33.220 --> 03:08:37.500]  you're ready to take everyone out and you're ready to die.
[03:08:37.500 --> 03:08:38.820]  You sound like a terrorist.
[03:08:38.820 --> 03:08:39.820]  All right.
[03:08:39.820 --> 03:08:42.580]  So, yeah, the people are going to move on you.
[03:08:42.580 --> 03:08:48.020]  So, yeah, someone, especially a Marine, of course, the public is going to take action.
[03:08:48.020 --> 03:08:49.380]  Who knows?
[03:08:49.380 --> 03:08:51.100]  You might have a detonator on you.
[03:08:51.100 --> 03:08:55.460]  You might have a bomb strapped on you somewhere or you might be ready to pull out a gun and
[03:08:55.460 --> 03:08:57.900]  just massacre everyone on the subway.
[03:08:57.900 --> 03:09:02.260]  But you see, the far left takes this and what do they do?
[03:09:02.260 --> 03:09:05.140]  And the Uniparty and the globalists, they take this.
[03:09:05.140 --> 03:09:06.940]  They take their minority.
[03:09:06.940 --> 03:09:08.820]  They take their token black guy.
[03:09:08.820 --> 03:09:13.980]  They take their token black martyr and they prop him up as the new martyr of 2023, George
[03:09:13.980 --> 03:09:16.460]  Floyd 2.0.
[03:09:16.460 --> 03:09:20.860]  And they were so-called protesting in New York on the streets going against the police.
[03:09:20.860 --> 03:09:22.980]  Again, they were assaulting journalists.
[03:09:22.980 --> 03:09:25.420]  So they weren't protesters.
[03:09:25.420 --> 03:09:30.520]  And some of these individuals, of course, are coming and taking to Twitter and literally
[03:09:30.520 --> 03:09:35.780]  claiming that Jordan Neely has been lynched.
[03:09:36.580 --> 03:09:42.740]  Literally claiming that he was lynched because the guy was claiming he's ready to die on
[03:09:42.740 --> 03:09:47.220]  a subway train in New York and threatening the people on the train.
[03:09:47.220 --> 03:09:52.620]  And of course, the woke black people on Twitter are all coming out and claiming that he got
[03:09:52.620 --> 03:09:54.780]  lynched.
[03:09:54.780 --> 03:10:00.420]  They're saying Ayanna Pressley on Twitter says he was 30 years old.
[03:10:00.420 --> 03:10:05.620]  Black men deserve to grow old, not be lynched on a subway because they were having a mental
[03:10:05.660 --> 03:10:07.340]  health crisis.
[03:10:07.340 --> 03:10:10.380]  Jordan deserved better accountability now.
[03:10:10.380 --> 03:10:12.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:10:12.380 --> 03:10:19.900]  Apparently this guy was like a Michael Jackson, pedophile Michael Jackson, street performer.
[03:10:19.900 --> 03:10:21.460]  Yeah, those are the words.
[03:10:21.460 --> 03:10:25.380]  When an individual comes out and says, I don't mind going to jail and getting life in prison
[03:10:25.380 --> 03:10:28.680]  and I'm ready to die and I'll hurt anyone on this train.
[03:10:28.680 --> 03:10:31.180]  That sure sounds like a smooth criminal, man.
[03:10:31.180 --> 03:10:32.180]  I don't know.
[03:10:32.180 --> 03:10:35.420]  It sounds like a terrorist to me, not someone that got lynched.
[03:10:35.420 --> 03:10:37.620]  There it is.
[03:10:37.620 --> 03:10:38.620]  Not be lynched.
[03:10:38.620 --> 03:10:45.100]  I can't do the pedo Michael Jackson thing.
[03:10:45.100 --> 03:10:46.100]  I don't know.
[03:10:46.100 --> 03:10:51.300]  It's just it's just it's just like, dude, this is how this is how depraved society really
[03:10:51.300 --> 03:10:52.300]  is.
[03:10:52.300 --> 03:10:53.300]  Right.
[03:10:53.300 --> 03:10:54.300]  Oh, they are.
[03:10:54.300 --> 03:10:57.300]  They all defend the terrorist on the train with the terrorist rhetoric claiming to hurt
[03:10:57.300 --> 03:10:59.620]  people on a train in New York.
[03:10:59.620 --> 03:11:02.580]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:11:02.580 --> 03:11:06.300]  This is where you see that society has absolutely lost its mind.
[03:11:06.300 --> 03:11:07.300]  All right.
[03:11:07.300 --> 03:11:10.460]  The guy, by the way, had more than 40 arrests.
[03:11:10.460 --> 03:11:13.500]  I think it was 44 in total.
[03:11:13.500 --> 03:11:18.380]  And by the way, at the time where he got choked out and was threatening people on the subway
[03:11:18.380 --> 03:11:22.860]  cart, he had he had a warrant out for his arrest.
[03:11:22.860 --> 03:11:27.740]  And some of this stuff was for some pretty violent offenses, including against senior
[03:11:27.740 --> 03:11:28.740]  citizens.
[03:11:28.740 --> 03:11:32.780]  So this guy beat up old people or he physically assaulted old people.
[03:11:32.780 --> 03:11:33.780]  Yeah.
[03:11:33.780 --> 03:11:37.580]  This Michael Jack, pedo Michael Jackson, LARPer, street performer.
[03:11:37.580 --> 03:11:42.420]  Oh, I just I just come on, dude.
[03:11:42.420 --> 03:11:46.980]  And of course, the NPCs, they go with their narratives to the mainstream.
[03:11:46.980 --> 03:11:48.380]  They go with their narratives to Twitter.
[03:11:48.380 --> 03:11:49.780]  It is everywhere right now.
[03:11:49.780 --> 03:11:51.580]  It is all over the place.
[03:11:51.580 --> 03:11:54.020]  Oh, Jordan Neal was such a terrible person.
[03:11:54.020 --> 03:11:55.020]  Oh, excuse me.
[03:11:55.020 --> 03:11:57.180]  Jordan Neal was not a terrible person.
[03:11:57.180 --> 03:11:58.820]  He shouldn't have been lynched.
[03:11:58.820 --> 03:12:04.260]  It's just another black man getting destroyed by a white man.
[03:12:04.260 --> 03:12:08.020]  Leaving out all the facts I just gave you, because this is what they do.
[03:12:08.020 --> 03:12:09.740]  They take a token black guy.
[03:12:09.740 --> 03:12:12.620]  They use a black martyr and they prop him up.
[03:12:12.620 --> 03:12:13.620]  It's what they do.
[03:12:13.620 --> 03:12:16.620]  Here we are on the verge of the twenty twenty four election.
[03:12:16.620 --> 03:12:18.700]  Right on schedule, isn't it?
[03:12:18.700 --> 03:12:19.700]  Right on schedule.
[03:12:19.700 --> 03:12:22.420]  You know how the New World Order functions.
[03:12:22.420 --> 03:12:26.780]  Well, we need another black guy because how else are we going to push our agenda on the
[03:12:26.780 --> 03:12:27.780]  streets?
[03:12:27.780 --> 03:12:31.620]  Because because because the black community is so this is how they think the black community
[03:12:31.620 --> 03:12:32.620]  is.
[03:12:32.620 --> 03:12:33.620]  They're so stupid.
[03:12:33.620 --> 03:12:36.500]  They just keep trusting and believing and listening to us.
[03:12:36.500 --> 03:12:38.100]  Just keep them on welfare.
[03:12:38.100 --> 03:12:40.020]  Keep them on section eight housing.
[03:12:40.020 --> 03:12:41.020]  Just keep them.
[03:12:41.020 --> 03:12:42.220]  Just keep them in the ghettos.
[03:12:42.220 --> 03:12:47.060]  Keep them on this hamster wheel in society, thinking that we actually care about them.
[03:12:47.060 --> 03:12:51.100]  So every time we need their votes, every time we need their support, every time we need
[03:12:51.100 --> 03:12:54.740]  them in the streets, get a token black martyr.
[03:12:54.740 --> 03:12:55.740]  Prop them up.
[03:12:55.740 --> 03:12:56.740]  Get them on CNN.
[03:12:57.700 --> 03:12:58.700]  Get them on MSNBC.
[03:12:58.700 --> 03:13:01.300]  Get all the NPCs to push the narrative, say he's been lynched.
[03:13:01.300 --> 03:13:04.100]  And that is how we're going to amplify the blacks.
[03:13:04.100 --> 03:13:05.100]  That's what they do.
[03:13:05.100 --> 03:13:07.460]  I'm just saying what everybody else is saying.
[03:13:07.460 --> 03:13:09.700]  You guys know I'm right.
[03:13:09.700 --> 03:13:11.780]  That's literally what they do.
[03:13:11.780 --> 03:13:17.500]  Every single presidential election cycle, every now and then a midterm, right?
[03:13:17.500 --> 03:13:19.000]  Every now and then a midterm.
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:24.500]  But this is part of the dehumanizing agenda because it's not about what's right.
[03:13:24.500 --> 03:13:25.580]  It's not about what's just.
[03:13:25.580 --> 03:13:29.340]  It's not about any of those things, because why do they come out with these lies?
[03:13:29.340 --> 03:13:32.940]  Why do they try to make people like George Floyd, Fentanyl Floyd, right?
[03:13:32.940 --> 03:13:34.140]  I got himself killed.
[03:13:34.140 --> 03:13:37.700]  Why do they try to make Jordan Neal look like some kind of martyr?
[03:13:37.700 --> 03:13:42.340]  Why do they try to make them look like the good guys and the actual good Samaritans in
[03:13:42.340 --> 03:13:46.860]  New York that I guarantee you this hasn't come out yet, but I guarantee you people on
[03:13:46.860 --> 03:13:49.940]  that subway probably thought this guy was a terrorist.
[03:13:49.940 --> 03:13:50.940]  All right.
[03:13:50.940 --> 03:13:56.940]  Listen, in New York, of all places, ground zero, 9-11, New York.
[03:13:56.940 --> 03:14:04.380]  You do not get on a train and start claiming to kill people or hurt people and that you're
[03:14:04.380 --> 03:14:06.540]  ready to die in the process.
[03:14:06.540 --> 03:14:08.300]  You want to know why?
[03:14:08.300 --> 03:14:13.100]  Because people that might have a little PTSD post what happened with 9-11 and the psyops
[03:14:13.100 --> 03:14:16.820]  that took place there and the government just totally forsook anyone that was destroyed
[03:14:16.820 --> 03:14:17.820]  through all that.
[03:14:18.060 --> 03:14:22.380]  Any responsibility just kind of swept it under the rug are going to kind of have a little
[03:14:22.380 --> 03:14:27.860]  PTSD when someone jumps on a, you know, a public transportation unit, whether it be
[03:14:27.860 --> 03:14:32.060]  a subway or a plane, and someone's claiming to hurt everyone and they're willing to die
[03:14:32.060 --> 03:14:33.060]  in the process.
[03:14:33.060 --> 03:14:34.060]  Yeah.
[03:14:34.060 --> 03:14:35.900]  What do you think is going to happen, dude?
[03:14:35.900 --> 03:14:37.660]  What would you do?
[03:14:37.660 --> 03:14:38.900]  What would you do?
[03:14:38.900 --> 03:14:40.140]  You're on a subway.
[03:14:40.140 --> 03:14:41.340]  You're on a plane.
[03:14:41.340 --> 03:14:43.260]  You know how terrorism works.
[03:14:43.260 --> 03:14:48.340]  And there's this guy dressed like Michael Jackson, threatening everybody, claiming to
[03:14:48.340 --> 03:14:50.620]  hurt people on the train and willing to die.
[03:14:50.620 --> 03:14:54.740]  You're going to sit there and be like, oh, he's just mentally ill.
[03:14:54.740 --> 03:14:56.300]  Wow, Sally.
[03:14:56.300 --> 03:14:57.740]  Wow, Chelsea.
[03:14:57.740 --> 03:14:59.100]  He's just mentally ill.
[03:14:59.100 --> 03:15:02.780]  Leave him alone.
[03:15:02.780 --> 03:15:05.740]  What would you do?
[03:15:05.740 --> 03:15:09.220]  You know exactly what you would do.
[03:15:09.220 --> 03:15:12.740]  Everyone would view that as a threat.
[03:15:12.740 --> 03:15:17.180]  Everyone on that subway, everyone on that train would view this individual as a threat.
[03:15:17.180 --> 03:15:20.620]  Oh, but no, it's because he's black.
[03:15:20.620 --> 03:15:21.820]  It's because he's a black guy.
[03:15:21.820 --> 03:15:25.220]  He gets protected because he's a black guy.
[03:15:25.220 --> 03:15:29.780]  Nobody could speak out against him because he's a black guy, because he's a minority.
[03:15:29.780 --> 03:15:31.780]  The facts cannot speak for themselves.
[03:15:31.780 --> 03:15:34.380]  No, no, no facts.
[03:15:34.380 --> 03:15:37.260]  All feeling, all emotion, all propaganda.
[03:15:37.260 --> 03:15:38.500]  He was a black guy.
[03:15:38.500 --> 03:15:39.700]  That's it.
[03:15:39.700 --> 03:15:40.700]  That's their narrative.
[03:15:40.700 --> 03:15:42.180]  Oh, racist, white supremacist.
[03:15:42.180 --> 03:15:46.340]  The whole narrative, just the can of worms opens all over again.
[03:15:46.340 --> 03:15:51.460]  So apparently New York City is bracing for riots over the next few days and over the
[03:15:51.460 --> 03:15:52.460]  weekend.
[03:15:52.460 --> 03:15:53.900]  I know InfoWars will be on top of that.
[03:15:53.900 --> 03:15:57.020]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:57.020 --> 03:16:01.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic
[03:16:01.180 --> 03:16:05.300]  book that documents the global, in their own words, plan for our future.
[03:16:05.300 --> 03:16:06.300]  That is a hellish future.
[03:16:06.300 --> 03:16:10.300]  Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:16:10.300 --> 03:16:14.260]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[03:16:14.260 --> 03:16:16.220]  Amazon, or InfoWarsWare.com.
[03:16:16.220 --> 03:16:20.020]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed
[03:16:20.020 --> 03:16:24.340]  copies we got run out, and there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:16:24.340 --> 03:16:29.740]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsWare.com.
[03:16:29.740 --> 03:16:33.660]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:16:33.660 --> 03:16:37.500]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[03:16:37.500 --> 03:16:39.180]  you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:16:39.420 --> 03:16:43.100]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[03:16:43.100 --> 03:16:48.340]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsWare.com and get a signed
[03:16:48.340 --> 03:16:52.820]  copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the
[03:16:52.820 --> 03:16:53.820]  local school.
[03:16:53.820 --> 03:16:54.820]  This is an InfoWar.
[03:16:54.820 --> 03:16:55.820]  I'm counting on you.
[03:16:55.820 --> 03:16:56.820]  And thank you for your support.
[03:16:56.820 --> 03:17:00.980]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:17:00.980 --> 03:17:03.380]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:17:03.380 --> 03:17:06.700]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:17:07.220 --> 03:17:12.620]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:17:12.620 --> 03:17:15.540]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:17:15.540 --> 03:17:19.700]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in
[03:17:19.700 --> 03:17:25.020]  every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:17:25.020 --> 03:17:28.140]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:17:28.140 --> 03:17:34.340]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:17:34.340 --> 03:17:35.340]  I know you spread the word.
[03:17:35.340 --> 03:17:36.340]  I know you pray for us.
[03:17:36.340 --> 03:17:37.340]  And that's wonderful.
[03:17:37.340 --> 03:17:38.340]  Keep doing it.
[03:17:38.340 --> 03:17:42.460]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great
[03:17:42.460 --> 03:17:46.340]  products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:17:46.340 --> 03:17:50.740]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:50.740 --> 03:17:54.860]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems
[03:17:54.860 --> 03:17:55.860]  will be over.
[03:17:55.860 --> 03:17:56.860]  Please take action now.
[03:17:56.860 --> 03:18:11.180]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food but also your health supplements
[03:18:11.180 --> 03:18:13.820]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[03:18:13.820 --> 03:18:15.580]  So support InfoWarsStore.
[03:18:15.580 --> 03:18:21.260]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know, I don't know, Alex and I are
[03:18:21.260 --> 03:18:24.540]  telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[03:18:24.540 --> 03:18:30.100]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything, krill oil.
[03:18:30.100 --> 03:18:36.260]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[03:18:36.260 --> 03:18:37.860]  that will keep you alive.
[03:18:37.860 --> 03:18:41.780]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional
[03:18:41.780 --> 03:18:44.180]  supplements, but the day will come.
[03:18:44.180 --> 03:18:49.020]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold, DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[03:18:49.020 --> 03:18:50.620]  Cell fusion, absolutely.
[03:18:50.620 --> 03:18:54.020]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[03:18:54.020 --> 03:18:56.860]  You have to have these products.
[03:18:56.860 --> 03:19:01.660]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot because
[03:19:01.660 --> 03:19:03.140]  they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:19:03.140 --> 03:19:05.420]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:19:05.420 --> 03:19:06.940]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[03:19:06.940 --> 03:19:08.140]  We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[03:19:08.140 --> 03:19:14.500]  So we've made our own and it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[03:19:14.500 --> 03:19:16.940]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:19:16.940 --> 03:19:19.500]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:19:19.500 --> 03:19:25.700]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot jail background.
[03:19:25.700 --> 03:19:26.700]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:19:26.700 --> 03:19:30.840]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:19:30.840 --> 03:19:32.140]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[03:19:32.140 --> 03:19:33.500]  No, I'm not running for president.
[03:19:33.500 --> 03:19:36.700]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white, and blue.
[03:19:36.700 --> 03:19:37.700]  Alex Jones for president.
[03:19:37.700 --> 03:19:38.700]  2024.
[03:19:38.700 --> 03:19:41.300]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[03:19:41.300 --> 03:19:43.100]  Great way to fund the operation.
[03:19:43.100 --> 03:19:51.300]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mug shot shirts at InfoWars.com or by
[03:19:51.300 --> 03:19:58.380]  calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:19:58.380 --> 03:20:03.060]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:03.060 --> 03:20:06.260]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:06.260 --> 03:20:18.780]  Listen, all you New Yorkers, well, Donkey Lady has been weighing in on the whole situation
[03:20:18.780 --> 03:20:19.780]  with Jordan Neely.
[03:20:19.780 --> 03:20:21.780]  You say, Drew, who's Donkey Lady?
[03:20:21.780 --> 03:20:26.660]  Well, I guess big booty Latino congresswoman AOC.
[03:20:26.660 --> 03:20:31.340]  Of course she's got to say something, right, because she's like the she's the she's like
[03:20:31.340 --> 03:20:35.460]  the high priest of the NPC socialist commies, a little globalist.
[03:20:35.460 --> 03:20:36.460]  You know what I mean?
[03:20:36.460 --> 03:20:39.180]  So, of course, she's got to she's got to have a take.
[03:20:39.180 --> 03:20:41.460]  And the takes usually never make any sense.
[03:20:41.460 --> 03:20:46.580]  But so here's what AOC had to say on Twitter, which is obviously going viral because she's
[03:20:46.580 --> 03:20:47.580]  an idiot.
[03:20:47.580 --> 03:20:49.540]  Jordan Neely was murdered.
[03:20:49.540 --> 03:20:51.740]  Oh, Jordan Neely was murdered.
[03:20:51.740 --> 03:20:54.420]  Listen, no facts in this tweet at all.
[03:20:54.420 --> 03:21:00.460]  Jordan Neely was murdered, but because Jordan was houseless and crying for food in a time
[03:21:00.580 --> 03:21:05.740]  when the city is raising rents and stripping services to militarize itself, while many
[03:21:05.740 --> 03:21:14.300]  in power demonize the poor, the murderer gets protected with passive headlines plus no charges.
[03:21:14.300 --> 03:21:15.300]  It's disgusting.
[03:21:15.300 --> 03:21:19.340]  Wait, number one, wait, wait, wait.
[03:21:19.340 --> 03:21:21.260]  So it's OK.
[03:21:21.260 --> 03:21:27.020]  It's OK for this guy to be threatening people on a train because he's houseless and wants
[03:21:27.020 --> 03:21:28.020]  food.
[03:21:28.020 --> 03:21:29.020]  OK.
[03:21:29.020 --> 03:21:32.700]  So I guess that's just the new norm for AOC.
[03:21:32.700 --> 03:21:37.820]  If you're houseless and you're hungry, apparently to AOC, it's justifiable if you show up on
[03:21:37.820 --> 03:21:43.260]  a public transport system and start threatening everyone for food and threatening.
[03:21:43.260 --> 03:21:46.620]  You don't care if you get a life sentence and go to prison forever and threatening that
[03:21:46.620 --> 03:21:51.060]  telling everyone you're ready to die because I won't get my chicken nuggets.
[03:21:51.060 --> 03:21:57.580]  I'm ready to die and I will hurt everyone on this train if I don't get my six piece chicken
[03:21:57.580 --> 03:21:58.580]  nugget.
[03:21:59.140 --> 03:22:00.140]  No.
[03:22:00.140 --> 03:22:01.140]  Damn it.
[03:22:01.140 --> 03:22:02.140]  What's wrong with you?
[03:22:02.140 --> 03:22:03.140]  You're all going to die.
[03:22:03.140 --> 03:22:04.140]  Every single one of you.
[03:22:04.140 --> 03:22:05.140]  Where are my chicken nuggets?
[03:22:05.140 --> 03:22:06.140]  AOC says, that's OK.
[03:22:06.140 --> 03:22:07.140]  I have a terrorist comes in.
[03:22:07.140 --> 03:22:08.140]  You know what I mean?
[03:22:08.140 --> 03:22:09.140]  Like these tranny terrorists.
[03:22:09.140 --> 03:22:10.140]  They're just gay.
[03:22:10.140 --> 03:22:11.140]  Right.
[03:22:11.140 --> 03:22:12.140]  A tranny terrorist comes.
[03:22:12.140 --> 03:22:13.140]  It's the same thing.
[03:22:13.140 --> 03:22:14.140]  Right.
[03:22:14.140 --> 03:22:15.140]  Hey, guys.
[03:22:15.140 --> 03:22:16.140]  Isn't that the same thing that happened with the so-called trans person?
[03:22:16.140 --> 03:22:27.140]  But the tranny terrorist at the Christian school murdered three little Christian kids
[03:22:27.140 --> 03:22:28.140]  and three Christian educators.
[03:22:28.140 --> 03:22:29.140]  It's the same thing.
[03:22:29.140 --> 03:22:30.140]  It's literally the same thing.
[03:22:30.140 --> 03:22:33.900]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:22:33.900 --> 03:22:39.460]  They blame the individual that should be responsible or they don't blame the individual that should
[03:22:39.460 --> 03:22:41.980]  be responsible and they blame the victims.
[03:22:41.980 --> 03:22:43.180]  Right.
[03:22:43.180 --> 03:22:44.220]  Everyone on the train is wrong.
[03:22:44.220 --> 03:22:47.360]  It's justifiable because no, no, no.
[03:22:47.360 --> 03:22:51.080]  You didn't accept what were all the Wotard saying on on TikTok.
[03:22:51.080 --> 03:22:56.300]  If the parents got what they deserve, because if you accepted trans people's identities,
[03:22:56.460 --> 03:22:58.580]  well, maybe you would still have your kids.
[03:22:58.580 --> 03:23:00.340]  AOC saying the same thing.
[03:23:00.340 --> 03:23:03.620]  Well, if you don't feed homeless people, they're just going to start killing you.
[03:23:03.620 --> 03:23:09.860]  And that's OK, because they're hungry and houseless.
[03:23:09.860 --> 03:23:11.420]  Of course, she's going to say that.
[03:23:11.420 --> 03:23:12.420]  Why wouldn't she?
[03:23:12.420 --> 03:23:14.140]  She loves violence.
[03:23:14.140 --> 03:23:15.320]  She loves it.
[03:23:15.320 --> 03:23:17.940]  She loves the dismantling of America.
[03:23:17.940 --> 03:23:24.660]  She loves seeing the destabilization, a true socialist causing mass chaos in the streets
[03:23:24.660 --> 03:23:29.380]  so that the people are beggars, begging for food, begging for someone to protect them,
[03:23:29.380 --> 03:23:32.900]  begging for someone to come and take care of them and all their needs.
[03:23:32.900 --> 03:23:34.460]  That's who AOC is.
[03:23:34.460 --> 03:23:40.180]  I'll be deceived by somebody like that.
[03:23:40.180 --> 03:23:41.180]  Demonize the poor.
[03:23:41.180 --> 03:23:42.180]  What an idiot.
[03:23:42.180 --> 03:23:46.700]  I mean, come on, dude, like you guys, you can't sit here and believe people like this.
[03:23:46.700 --> 03:23:47.700]  Talk about low IQ.
[03:23:47.700 --> 03:23:50.540]  That's that's that's a U.S. American congresswoman.
[03:23:50.540 --> 03:23:51.540]  I guess so.
[03:23:51.540 --> 03:23:58.580]  I guess now installed, obviously, but I mean, what what are people in New York supposed
[03:23:58.580 --> 03:23:59.580]  to do?
[03:23:59.580 --> 03:24:03.780]  I mean, for real, what are people in New York supposed to think?
[03:24:03.780 --> 03:24:08.940]  You guys remember Frank James or that black guy that showed up to a Brooklyn subway?
[03:24:08.940 --> 03:24:09.940]  I think it was 2020.
[03:24:09.940 --> 03:24:12.140]  I think I got that right.
[03:24:12.140 --> 03:24:17.860]  You guys remember Frank James showed up to a Brooklyn subway, just emptied, emptied a
[03:24:17.860 --> 03:24:21.740]  clip into the end of the subway, dude, through smoke bombs.
[03:24:21.740 --> 03:24:26.620]  I was just total assault on humans in a Brooklyn subway.
[03:24:26.620 --> 03:24:32.900]  What do you how do you think New Yorkers are supposed to respond to something like this?
[03:24:32.900 --> 03:24:37.420]  What are you supposed to do, especially when it comes to public transport systems?
[03:24:37.420 --> 03:24:43.340]  With a city that has a history with some serious terrorism, real terrorism.
[03:24:43.340 --> 03:24:46.900]  And I'm not talking about, oh, the FBI saying if you say the word base, you're domestic
[03:24:46.900 --> 03:24:47.900]  terrorist.
[03:24:47.900 --> 03:24:49.940]  No, I'm talking about real jihadis.
[03:24:49.940 --> 03:24:54.420]  I'm talking about, you know, aspects, rogue aspects of the American government setting
[03:24:54.420 --> 03:24:55.420]  up their own people.
[03:24:55.420 --> 03:24:57.660]  You guys know what I'm talking about, right?
[03:24:57.660 --> 03:24:59.220]  What are New Yorkers supposed to do?
[03:24:59.220 --> 03:25:02.420]  See, but this is how beta things have become, right?
[03:25:02.420 --> 03:25:04.380]  This is how beta things right.
[03:25:04.380 --> 03:25:06.300]  Because New York used to be alpha.
[03:25:06.300 --> 03:25:11.660]  Remember New York used to be known for being tough, really stern, really aggressive, such
[03:25:11.660 --> 03:25:14.460]  as people cussing each other out in the middle of the street.
[03:25:14.460 --> 03:25:15.460]  They're just having a conversation.
[03:25:16.020 --> 03:25:17.020]  God, don't worry about it.
[03:25:17.020 --> 03:25:18.020]  They'll get over it.
[03:25:18.020 --> 03:25:21.460]  That's just another day in New York, right?
[03:25:21.460 --> 03:25:23.100]  New York has always been known for that.
[03:25:23.100 --> 03:25:24.100]  Not anymore.
[03:25:24.100 --> 03:25:25.100]  Not anymore.
[03:25:25.100 --> 03:25:26.100]  No, no.
[03:25:26.100 --> 03:25:27.100]  Cucked out.
[03:25:27.100 --> 03:25:28.340]  Total beta energy.
[03:25:28.340 --> 03:25:29.340]  You're not allowed.
[03:25:29.340 --> 03:25:34.780]  Another thing New York has always been known for is like dealing with their own and protecting
[03:25:34.780 --> 03:25:37.980]  their own communities from individuals within.
[03:25:37.980 --> 03:25:38.980]  You guys know what I'm talking about.
[03:25:38.980 --> 03:25:42.700]  It's like this mob mentality, but like in a way where you're protecting your own.
[03:25:42.700 --> 03:25:45.340]  You're watching each other's backs like someone wants to get out of line.
[03:25:45.340 --> 03:25:46.340]  Okay.
[03:25:46.340 --> 03:25:47.340]  You're in New York.
[03:25:47.340 --> 03:25:48.340]  You get out of line.
[03:25:48.340 --> 03:25:49.340]  Someone sees it in the streets.
[03:25:49.340 --> 03:25:50.340]  The people are going to take care of you.
[03:25:50.340 --> 03:25:51.340]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:25:51.340 --> 03:25:52.340]  You guys know exactly what I'm talking about.
[03:25:52.340 --> 03:25:55.380]  Oh, New York has been known for this stuff, but no, not anymore.
[03:25:55.380 --> 03:25:56.540]  Not anymore.
[03:25:56.540 --> 03:26:02.380]  Not any longer because this is a cucked out society, a beta society where you cannot be
[03:26:02.380 --> 03:26:08.100]  like that anymore, especially if it's a black person, especially you guys want to know how
[03:26:08.100 --> 03:26:14.300]  this would have been like the ultimate, like golden ticket, the absolute over shield invincibility
[03:26:14.300 --> 03:26:16.140]  shield for these people.
[03:26:16.140 --> 03:26:24.340]  If Jordan was a, a so-called trans woman, if he identified as a woman, Ooh, this, this,
[03:26:24.340 --> 03:26:30.380]  that's like, that's like George Floyd 2.0 with like, you know, when Mario eats, he eats
[03:26:30.380 --> 03:26:34.860]  the mushroom and grows like, like, dude, that's like the ultimate power upgrade for these people
[03:26:34.860 --> 03:26:39.180]  because the ones that are ultimately protected are the mentally perverted men that walk around
[03:26:39.180 --> 03:26:41.420]  masquerading as women.
[03:26:41.420 --> 03:26:47.140]  And of course people are going to act, people are on edge, but why do you think the new
[03:26:47.140 --> 03:26:49.900]  world order is trying to take away your guns?
[03:26:49.900 --> 03:26:55.100]  Why do you think the new world order is trying to make self-defense look like a crime?
[03:26:55.100 --> 03:26:59.940]  Why do you think they try to make those things that are obviously openly good and righteous
[03:26:59.940 --> 03:27:03.140]  to defend yourself against anyone that's violent towards you?
[03:27:03.140 --> 03:27:07.120]  Why do you think they've been trying to do that systemically for years now, dismantling
[03:27:07.120 --> 03:27:13.280]  the second amendment, demonizing firearms, blaming murder on guns alone, not the individuals
[03:27:13.280 --> 03:27:15.360]  that are evil and that have evil intentions.
[03:27:15.360 --> 03:27:17.800]  Why do you think they've been pushing this agenda for so long?
[03:27:17.800 --> 03:27:18.800]  Yes.
[03:27:18.800 --> 03:27:19.800]  To take away the guns.
[03:27:19.800 --> 03:27:20.800]  Yes.
[03:27:20.800 --> 03:27:21.800]  To implement their tyranny.
[03:27:21.800 --> 03:27:22.800]  Yes.
[03:27:22.800 --> 03:27:25.280]  But at the same time, this is the SIOP that's being run on the American people.
[03:27:25.280 --> 03:27:30.760]  So when you're in a situation where you have to legally and lawfully defend yourself, you
[03:27:30.760 --> 03:27:31.920]  will be the bad guy.
[03:27:31.920 --> 03:27:33.200]  You will be the murderer.
[03:27:33.200 --> 03:27:38.000]  They will Kyle Rittenhouse you, at least what they attempted to do to Kyle.
[03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:39.000]  I was there.
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:40.000]  I testified in that trial.
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:47.800]  I watched them try to dismantle a human being's right to self-defense multiple times.
[03:27:47.800 --> 03:27:54.520]  And they made him the villain and they made the aggressors the victims.
[03:27:54.520 --> 03:27:57.120]  This is only going to continue, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:27:57.120 --> 03:27:59.200]  There's a reason why they implement these agendas.
[03:27:59.200 --> 03:28:03.400]  There's a reason why they run these SIOPs on the American people, because if they could
[03:28:03.400 --> 03:28:09.760]  get millions of people to believe that self-defense is something that is a crime or self-defense
[03:28:09.760 --> 03:28:14.680]  is something that should be viewed as illegal or frowned upon in society.
[03:28:14.680 --> 03:28:20.280]  I'm not an advocate for violence, but I am an advocate for self-defense against violence.
[03:28:20.280 --> 03:28:22.680]  But the New World Order wants it the opposite.
[03:28:22.680 --> 03:28:24.680]  The New World Order wants their violence.
[03:28:24.680 --> 03:28:28.300]  The New World Order can do whatever the hell they want, but you're not allowed to defend
[03:28:28.300 --> 03:28:29.700]  yourself, are you?
[03:28:29.700 --> 03:28:33.140]  Because if you defend yourself from tyranny, you are a domestic terrorist.
[03:28:33.140 --> 03:28:34.140]  Does that sound familiar?
[03:28:34.140 --> 03:28:36.900]  Isn't that kind of how America was founded?
[03:28:36.900 --> 03:28:44.780]  You guys fleeing tyranny to come to the new world, the free world, free from tyrants.
[03:28:44.780 --> 03:28:47.380]  And here we are again, living it all over again.
[03:28:47.380 --> 03:28:52.780]  And if you attempt to defend yourself from a tyrant or anyone trying to end your life,
[03:28:52.780 --> 03:28:54.220]  you are somehow the problem.
[03:28:54.220 --> 03:28:55.220]  That's how it goes.
[03:28:55.220 --> 03:28:56.860]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:56.860 --> 03:29:01.660]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[03:29:01.660 --> 03:29:03.800]  We made it even stronger.
[03:29:03.800 --> 03:29:09.380]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere, TurboForce is back in stock
[03:29:09.380 --> 03:29:14.460]  at InfowarsStore.com or AAA253-3139.
[03:29:14.460 --> 03:29:20.980]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours, should be
[03:29:20.980 --> 03:29:22.620]  called 10-hour energy.
[03:29:22.620 --> 03:29:28.060]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[03:29:28.060 --> 03:29:33.220]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[03:29:33.220 --> 03:29:34.220]  it.
[03:29:34.220 --> 03:29:38.020]  It is the super fuel.
[03:29:38.020 --> 03:29:39.460]  RainForce Plus is great.
[03:29:39.460 --> 03:29:40.460]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[03:29:40.460 --> 03:29:41.460]  They're two different nootropics.
[03:29:41.460 --> 03:29:42.460]  They go good with this.
[03:29:42.460 --> 03:29:44.980]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:29:44.980 --> 03:29:46.620]  This is the boss.
[03:29:46.620 --> 03:29:50.380]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, InfowarsStore.com.
[03:29:50.900 --> 03:29:56.420]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[03:29:56.420 --> 03:30:02.700]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[03:30:02.700 --> 03:30:03.820]  the atmosphere.
[03:30:03.820 --> 03:30:06.540]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:30:06.540 --> 03:30:12.980]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[03:30:12.980 --> 03:30:17.420]  into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic but containable.
[03:30:17.460 --> 03:30:22.220]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to
[03:30:22.220 --> 03:30:23.340]  dispose of it.
[03:30:23.340 --> 03:30:28.260]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who
[03:30:28.260 --> 03:30:31.780]  was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[03:30:31.780 --> 03:30:38.300]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[03:30:38.300 --> 03:30:40.660]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:30:40.660 --> 03:30:45.940]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:30:45.940 --> 03:30:52.340]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.

[03:31:44.340 --> 03:31:45.340]  having these products.

[03:31:56.100 --> 03:32:01.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[03:32:01.020 --> 03:32:02.700]  in plain view.
[03:32:02.700 --> 03:32:05.460]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:32:05.460 --> 03:32:09.720]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[03:32:09.720 --> 03:32:14.960]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:32:14.960 --> 03:32:22.240]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[03:32:22.240 --> 03:32:28.560]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[03:32:28.560 --> 03:32:34.720]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive
[03:32:34.720 --> 03:32:38.640]  disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:32:38.640 --> 03:32:40.920]  This iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[03:32:40.920 --> 03:32:46.400]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[03:32:46.400 --> 03:32:48.760]  X3 is now back in stock at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:32:48.760 --> 03:32:52.600]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.

[03:32:53.960 --> 03:32:54.960]  Take action now.
[03:32:54.960 --> 03:32:55.960]  InfowarsStore.com.
[03:32:57.960 --> 03:33:04.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.900 --> 03:33:15.340]  Defund the police, right?
[03:33:15.340 --> 03:33:16.340]  Defund the police.
[03:33:16.340 --> 03:33:21.900]  I think the easy take is, yeah, a lot of people in New York, and this is actually happening
[03:33:21.900 --> 03:33:29.020]  right now, a lot of NPCs and so-called liberals and leftists, they're blaming the police for
[03:33:29.020 --> 03:33:31.699]  this whole Jordan Neely situation.
[03:33:31.699 --> 03:33:33.260]  They're actually blaming the police.
[03:33:33.260 --> 03:33:37.460]  They're coming out, and they're saying, well, the police didn't get there in time.
[03:33:37.460 --> 03:33:38.619]  They didn't get there in time.
[03:33:38.619 --> 03:33:42.859]  Yeah, he was being threatening, and he was threatening to hurt people, and he was saying
[03:33:42.859 --> 03:33:48.619]  he was ready to die and all this nonsense with criminal terrorist mentality and rhetoric.
[03:33:48.619 --> 03:33:53.460]  But the police didn't get there in time, and that's how that white man put him in a chokehold
[03:33:53.460 --> 03:33:54.460]  and he died.
[03:33:54.460 --> 03:33:56.740]  That's what they're saying.
[03:33:56.740 --> 03:33:57.740]  They're blaming the police.
[03:33:57.740 --> 03:34:02.100]  So you might sit there and be like, yeah, you idiots, you wanted to defund the police?
[03:34:02.100 --> 03:34:05.660]  So if they don't have the resources, they don't have the funding, they don't have the
[03:34:05.660 --> 03:34:11.260]  abilities to answer your calls, even in your hypocrisy, to help you when you claim they're
[03:34:11.260 --> 03:34:12.260]  white supremacists.
[03:34:12.260 --> 03:34:15.980]  Isn't that funny how the BLM black people are always like, white supremacist cops, but
[03:34:15.980 --> 03:34:21.580]  whenever something bad happens, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, oh, come save me, white cop, come save me.
[03:34:21.580 --> 03:34:24.180]  Shut up, dude.
[03:34:24.180 --> 03:34:26.220]  You guys made this all.
[03:34:26.220 --> 03:34:27.220]  Go lay in it.
[03:34:27.220 --> 03:34:28.779]  All right, you dug your grave.
[03:34:28.779 --> 03:34:29.900]  Go lay in it.
[03:34:29.900 --> 03:34:30.900]  You made your bed.
[03:34:30.900 --> 03:34:31.900]  Go lay in it.
[03:34:31.900 --> 03:34:33.859]  I'm so sick of these people.
[03:34:33.859 --> 03:34:34.900]  That's the easy take.
[03:34:34.900 --> 03:34:36.619]  What's the more nuanced, advanced take?
[03:34:36.619 --> 03:34:38.940]  Let's go a little deeper.
[03:34:38.940 --> 03:34:41.560]  What is defund the police, right?
[03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:48.180]  Is it just total anarchy or is it an agenda for a regime installation?
[03:34:48.180 --> 03:34:52.580]  Because if you take a look at what that truly was and what it is to this day, especially
[03:34:52.580 --> 03:34:58.660]  police departments, Metropolitan in D.C., different areas and regions in the United
[03:34:58.660 --> 03:35:04.140]  States, they implement the diversity hires and they put all kinds of people that have
[03:35:04.140 --> 03:35:05.539]  the same ideologies.
[03:35:05.539 --> 03:35:09.980]  They put in so-called police officers that are just as woke as the politicians that claim
[03:35:09.980 --> 03:35:11.960]  all cops are bad and evil.
[03:35:11.960 --> 03:35:14.060]  And then people sit and say, well, that's hypocrisy.
[03:35:14.060 --> 03:35:15.119]  Yes, it is.
[03:35:15.119 --> 03:35:20.900]  But it's intentional hypocrisy because it's not about just dismantling police.
[03:35:20.900 --> 03:35:25.460]  It's not about dismantling law and order.
[03:35:25.460 --> 03:35:29.300]  It's about a regime installation because they want to take out the good guys.
[03:35:29.300 --> 03:35:31.140]  They want to take the good cops out.
[03:35:31.140 --> 03:35:36.020]  They want to take the good women, the good men that wear the badge every single day.
[03:35:36.020 --> 03:35:40.260]  They take that oath before God and they're doing their job, right?
[03:35:40.260 --> 03:35:45.340]  Not upholding a police state, but upholding law and order to protect innocents, right?
[03:35:45.340 --> 03:35:46.340]  That's why we have laws.
[03:35:46.340 --> 03:35:50.580]  It's to protect innocent people from bad things.
[03:35:50.580 --> 03:35:52.420]  So how do you install a new regime?
[03:35:52.420 --> 03:35:54.640]  Well, you defund the police.
[03:35:54.640 --> 03:36:00.300]  You push out the good guys, make them go on retirement, make them give up, feel isolated
[03:36:00.300 --> 03:36:04.520]  like they don't belong, accuse them of being white supremacists, accuse them of being American
[03:36:04.520 --> 03:36:07.000]  nationalists and fascists.
[03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:10.800]  If they don't bend the knee to BLM while they're marching and rioting, then they're not a part
[03:36:10.800 --> 03:36:11.800]  of the regime.
[03:36:11.800 --> 03:36:12.800]  Guys, this is a part.
[03:36:12.800 --> 03:36:15.160]  This is all about the cult, all right?
[03:36:15.160 --> 03:36:17.520]  This is about the power structures and the regimes.
[03:36:17.520 --> 03:36:18.520]  They're all together.
[03:36:18.520 --> 03:36:23.760]  You take a police department, you push out all the good guys, bring in all the bad guys,
[03:36:23.880 --> 03:36:26.560]  hire people with no conscience.
[03:36:26.560 --> 03:36:28.880]  Hire people with no morality.
[03:36:28.880 --> 03:36:33.480]  Hire people that are not going to question anything, but just take orders when we call
[03:36:33.480 --> 03:36:35.000]  for another lockdown.
[03:36:35.000 --> 03:36:41.400]  Hire people that are not going to push back, incite the oath they took that goes against
[03:36:41.400 --> 03:36:45.760]  the Constitution of the United States, that goes against what's morally true or right.
[03:36:45.760 --> 03:36:48.680]  No, no, they're not going to question any of that.
[03:36:48.680 --> 03:36:53.240]  They're just going to push forward and do as they're told and uphold the police state.
[03:36:53.240 --> 03:36:58.560]  So over time, you defund the police and you push out the good guys, make them go on retirement,
[03:36:58.560 --> 03:37:01.880]  make them quit, feel isolated, cancel them, destroy them.
[03:37:01.880 --> 03:37:02.880]  They do this in the CIA.
[03:37:02.880 --> 03:37:03.880]  They do this in the FBI.
[03:37:03.880 --> 03:37:04.880]  They're doing it in the military.
[03:37:04.880 --> 03:37:08.920]  Are you starting to see what I'm seeing, you guys?
[03:37:08.920 --> 03:37:14.560]  It's a total dismantling of the three-letter agencies, police departments, you name it,
[03:37:14.560 --> 03:37:15.560]  even the military.
[03:37:15.560 --> 03:37:20.119]  That's why the United States Navy is putting out ads trying to attract more people and
[03:37:20.119 --> 03:37:22.359]  recruitment by using drag queens.
[03:37:22.359 --> 03:37:29.680]  Oh, yeah, that's definitely going to scare the CCP, just have sailors running around
[03:37:29.680 --> 03:37:31.480]  and dressed as women.
[03:37:31.480 --> 03:37:40.320]  No, no, you know, I take that back, not dressed as women, dressed as like a comical, obnoxiously
[03:37:40.320 --> 03:37:46.199]  like clown-looking woman thing, right?
[03:37:46.199 --> 03:37:50.800]  But all of this is to dismantle these systems that God has given us, by the way, because
[03:37:50.800 --> 03:37:53.680]  law and order is something given by God.
[03:37:53.680 --> 03:37:54.680]  It's to protect innocents.
[03:37:54.680 --> 03:37:59.560]  God gave the law to the Israelites when they exodus out of Egypt for what?
[03:37:59.560 --> 03:38:04.920]  To teach them the way how to have a stable society, have some kind of safety for innocents
[03:38:04.920 --> 03:38:10.520]  and how to judge evil righteously and very basic, very simple.
[03:38:10.520 --> 03:38:15.760]  But the New World Order does the opposite, because the PSYOP is push out all the good
[03:38:15.760 --> 03:38:22.199]  guys, use the token blacks, use the token minorities, use the martyrs to continue to
[03:38:22.199 --> 03:38:24.240]  push the agenda.
[03:38:24.240 --> 03:38:28.100]  We defund the police, make it look like there's going to be total anarchy.
[03:38:28.100 --> 03:38:34.080]  So now we have a new regime, this, guys, what I'm talking about may not come to full fruition
[03:38:34.080 --> 03:38:38.760]  like maybe 10 or 15 years from now, because it's happening now and it kind of just started
[03:38:38.760 --> 03:38:43.320]  in 2020 where they went overdrive BLM defund the police and they started hiring all these
[03:38:43.320 --> 03:38:47.140]  diversity hires that have no morality, that think everyone's a racist and they just do
[03:38:47.140 --> 03:38:50.560]  what the regime tells them to do, they don't question anything.
[03:38:50.560 --> 03:38:53.800]  Imagine this in 20 years, right?
[03:38:53.800 --> 03:38:58.080]  If they actually just go forward with their plans and no one stops them and the good guys
[03:38:58.080 --> 03:39:01.279]  and the good women just all leave.
[03:39:01.279 --> 03:39:05.080]  So when you finally decide to have another lockdown, when you finally decide to implement
[03:39:05.080 --> 03:39:10.720]  your tyranny, when you finally decide to protect the pedophiles and the groomers and
[03:39:10.720 --> 03:39:19.039]  you decide to deploy police, FBI, you name it, the military, right?
[03:39:19.039 --> 03:39:25.560]  Martial law, you decide to deploy these people to go after individuals, parents that may
[03:39:25.560 --> 03:39:30.359]  not agree with so-called gender ideology, transgender this, homosexual that, oh, well,
[03:39:30.359 --> 03:39:33.880]  they're a domestic terrorist, so have police go to their house, knock on their door, break
[03:39:33.880 --> 03:39:38.359]  down their door, take their children from them and send them into a gulag or concentration
[03:39:38.359 --> 03:39:39.359]  camp.
[03:39:39.359 --> 03:39:43.760]  So what the Nazis did with the SS, you got a bunch of people that had no conscience, that
[03:39:43.760 --> 03:39:46.980]  were willing to do evil things.
[03:39:46.980 --> 03:39:50.000]  That's how you install, that's what defund the police is.
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:55.160]  You take out the good guys, put in the bad guys to do your evil bidding, to uphold the
[03:39:55.160 --> 03:39:59.960]  police state, the new world order and to start attacking and dismantling everyone else in
[03:39:59.960 --> 03:40:06.119]  society that stands in your way because you can't speak out against a police officer.
[03:40:06.119 --> 03:40:10.000]  A lot of conservatives that are like, back the blue over everything, haven't gotten this
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:11.000]  far yet.
[03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:13.000]  What, do you back the blue when it's a police state?
[03:40:13.000 --> 03:40:16.320]  What, do you back the blue when it's the new world order and they got an installed police
[03:40:16.320 --> 03:40:17.320]  state?
[03:40:17.320 --> 03:40:18.320]  What, do you back the blue even then?
[03:40:18.320 --> 03:40:19.320]  Are you that dumb?
[03:40:19.320 --> 03:40:21.640]  What do you think a police state is?
[03:40:21.640 --> 03:40:23.440]  And I'm not saying all police are bad.
[03:40:23.440 --> 03:40:28.680]  What I'm saying is, yes, some are, and some are literal proxies and pawns of the new world
[03:40:28.680 --> 03:40:35.119]  order and they're willing to throw you in jail in order to keep their jobs, to uphold
[03:40:35.119 --> 03:40:36.840]  the man.
[03:40:36.840 --> 03:40:37.840]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:40:37.840 --> 03:40:39.720]  You got to really, really pay attention to this stuff.
[03:40:40.900 --> 03:40:43.900]  Because when it comes to full fruition,
[03:40:43.900 --> 03:40:45.900]  when they implement their tyranny, their martial law,
[03:40:45.900 --> 03:40:47.900]  and everything gets absolutely destabilized,
[03:40:47.900 --> 03:40:49.900]  look what's happening in New York.
[03:40:49.900 --> 03:40:51.900]  I know this was a long explanation
[03:40:51.900 --> 03:40:53.900]  because of how I opened this segment,
[03:40:53.900 --> 03:40:55.900]  is look what New Yorkers are doing.
[03:40:55.900 --> 03:40:57.900]  Not all of them, but people are literally blaming the police.
[03:40:57.900 --> 03:40:59.900]  Well, the cops should have been here.
[03:40:59.900 --> 03:41:00.900]  The cops should have been here.
[03:41:00.900 --> 03:41:01.900]  Okay, well, maybe we do need the cops.
[03:41:01.900 --> 03:41:03.900]  Oh, and then at that point,
[03:41:03.900 --> 03:41:05.900]  you got a police state.
[03:41:05.900 --> 03:41:06.900]  That is the dismantling.
[03:41:06.900 --> 03:41:08.900]  That is the destabilization.
[03:41:08.900 --> 03:41:10.900]  It's too chaotic out here.
[03:41:10.900 --> 03:41:12.900]  We need someone to save us.
[03:41:12.900 --> 03:41:13.900]  It's too dismantled.
[03:41:13.900 --> 03:41:15.900]  There's so much badness going on.
[03:41:15.900 --> 03:41:17.900]  We need the police state.
[03:41:17.900 --> 03:41:19.900]  We need the police state.
[03:41:19.900 --> 03:41:22.900]  And you get all these immoral, evil, wicked people
[03:41:22.900 --> 03:41:25.900]  that will impose tyranny on everyone.
[03:41:25.900 --> 03:41:27.900]  And the New World Order at the top,
[03:41:27.900 --> 03:41:28.900]  the federal government,
[03:41:28.900 --> 03:41:30.900]  whatever it looks like at the time,
[03:41:30.900 --> 03:41:31.900]  will be calling all the orders,
[03:41:31.900 --> 03:41:33.900]  will be calling all the shots,
[03:41:33.900 --> 03:41:34.900]  will be imposing their agendas,
[03:41:34.900 --> 03:41:36.900]  imposing their will upon you,
[03:41:36.900 --> 03:41:38.900]  and no one in any police department,
[03:41:38.900 --> 03:41:41.900]  in the military, in the FBI, in the CIA,
[03:41:41.900 --> 03:41:44.900]  no one will question it because they have been replaced.
[03:41:44.900 --> 03:41:46.900]  That is what defund the police is,
[03:41:46.900 --> 03:41:48.900]  and it comes in different forms.
[03:41:48.900 --> 03:41:50.900]  That's what the cancellation is in the military.
[03:41:50.900 --> 03:41:52.900]  That's what the cancellation is within the FBI.
[03:41:52.900 --> 03:41:54.900]  That is how they replace people.
[03:41:55.900 --> 03:41:57.900]  The agenda is here,
[03:41:57.900 --> 03:41:58.900]  and it's going to unfold,
[03:41:58.900 --> 03:42:01.900]  and people are going to see it for what it truly is,
[03:42:01.900 --> 03:42:03.900]  because we're watching it happen in real time.
[03:42:03.900 --> 03:42:06.900]  This is all about getting people desperate.
[03:42:07.900 --> 03:42:09.900]  It's all about getting people desperate.
[03:42:09.900 --> 03:42:11.900]  They need their people in.
[03:42:11.900 --> 03:42:13.900]  They don't want to be void of police departments.
[03:42:13.900 --> 03:42:15.900]  They don't want to be void of the military.
[03:42:15.900 --> 03:42:17.900]  They don't want to be void of the CIA, the FBI.
[03:42:17.900 --> 03:42:19.900]  No, they want them.
[03:42:20.900 --> 03:42:24.900]  Those are tools to be hijacked, okay?
[03:42:24.900 --> 03:42:27.900]  Those are tools that they put in their tool belt
[03:42:27.900 --> 03:42:30.900]  to use against the American people.
[03:42:30.900 --> 03:42:32.900]  They're tools that could be used for good
[03:42:32.900 --> 03:42:35.900]  that they use for the New World Order,
[03:42:35.900 --> 03:42:38.900]  the devil, and Satan, and their own evil agendas.
[03:42:38.900 --> 03:42:40.900]  They take these things
[03:42:40.900 --> 03:42:43.900]  that could actually do some good in the world,
[03:42:43.900 --> 03:42:45.900]  and they weaponize it against you and me.
[03:42:45.900 --> 03:42:46.900]  Does that sound familiar?
[03:42:46.900 --> 03:42:48.900]  It kind of sounds like
[03:42:48.900 --> 03:42:51.900]  the current timeline that we all live in right now,
[03:42:51.900 --> 03:42:53.900]  because that's exactly what's happening.
[03:42:53.900 --> 03:42:55.900]  We'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:56.900 --> 03:42:58.900]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[03:42:58.900 --> 03:43:01.900]  Please write this down, and please go look this up.
[03:43:01.900 --> 03:43:03.900]  It will change your life.
[03:43:03.900 --> 03:43:06.900]  The UN admits, and the Lancet Medical Journal admits,
[03:43:06.900 --> 03:43:10.900]  that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities
[03:43:10.900 --> 03:43:12.900]  and declining cognitive abilities.
[03:43:12.900 --> 03:43:15.900]  The term they use is intellectual disability
[03:43:15.900 --> 03:43:17.900]  because of lack of iodine.
[03:43:17.900 --> 03:43:19.900]  Most iodine in the environment
[03:43:19.900 --> 03:43:21.900]  is bound to other elements,
[03:43:21.900 --> 03:43:23.900]  so your body can't absorb it.
[03:43:23.900 --> 03:43:27.900]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[03:43:27.900 --> 03:43:31.900]  And InfoWarsTore.com has the only iodine out there
[03:43:31.900 --> 03:43:34.900]  that actually has this type of full effect.

[03:45:00.900 --> 03:45:03.900]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:45:03.900 --> 03:45:07.900]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website
[03:45:07.900 --> 03:45:10.900]  where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability
[03:45:10.900 --> 03:45:13.900]  in the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:45:13.900 --> 03:45:17.900]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability
[03:45:17.900 --> 03:45:21.900]  is lack of real, pure iodine in the body.
[03:45:22.900 --> 03:45:26.900]  As they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine,
[03:45:26.900 --> 03:45:28.900]  and so much more.
[03:45:28.900 --> 03:45:32.900]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study
[03:45:32.900 --> 03:45:35.900]  in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities
[03:45:35.900 --> 03:45:38.900]  because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:45:38.900 --> 03:45:40.900]  Most iodine is bound to other elements.
[03:45:40.900 --> 03:45:41.900]  You don't absorb it.
[03:45:41.900 --> 03:45:44.900]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together
[03:45:44.900 --> 03:45:46.900]  that supercharges your body.

[03:45:56.900 --> 03:46:00.900]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[03:46:04.900 --> 03:46:07.900]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:07.900 --> 03:46:11.900]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[03:46:11.900 --> 03:46:14.900]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:46:14.900 --> 03:46:18.900]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down,
[03:46:18.900 --> 03:46:20.900]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:20.900 --> 03:46:24.900]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:46:24.900 --> 03:46:28.900]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:46:28.900 --> 03:46:32.900]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[03:46:32.900 --> 03:46:35.900]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[03:46:35.900 --> 03:46:38.900]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:46:38.900 --> 03:46:41.900]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:46:41.900 --> 03:46:44.900]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:46:44.900 --> 03:46:49.900]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:46:55.600 --> 03:47:05.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.800 --> 03:47:17.560]  I'll be honest with you guys, this next story is really going to piss you off, especially
[03:47:17.560 --> 03:47:22.439]  if you're a parent or just a human being that still has a conscience that's not a part of
[03:47:22.439 --> 03:47:29.160]  the New World Order, that's not a degenerate, immoral, disgusting pervert that's into child
[03:47:29.160 --> 03:47:33.699]  pornography and all this disgusting groomer garbage that's all being thrown around the
[03:47:33.699 --> 03:47:41.420]  rainbow flag and the pride flag and all this garbage, LGBTQ plus, LMNOP, they're going
[03:47:41.420 --> 03:47:42.420]  to put that P in there.
[03:47:42.420 --> 03:47:48.859]  I'm telling you guys that LGBTQP, it's here and it's on its way, P for pedophile, it will
[03:47:48.859 --> 03:47:50.380]  be a sexual identity.
[03:47:50.380 --> 03:47:56.220]  I'm telling you guys, I'm telling you man, it's inevitable, it is only inevitable, right?
[03:47:56.220 --> 03:48:00.580]  Because that's the agenda of the lawlessness abounding from the New World Order.
[03:48:00.580 --> 03:48:07.539]  Well here's a story from the Daily Caller, taxpayer funded Planned Parenthood, LGBTQ youth
[03:48:07.539 --> 03:48:12.220]  club promotes national masturbation month.
[03:48:12.220 --> 03:48:14.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me read that again.
[03:48:14.900 --> 03:48:21.340]  Taxpayer funded Planned Parenthood, LGBTQ youth club, a youth club, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:48:21.340 --> 03:48:28.539]  youth club promotes national masturbation month.
[03:48:28.580 --> 03:48:30.580]  I cannot believe this is real, but I can.
[03:48:30.580 --> 03:48:37.220]  A state funded Planned Parenthood, LGBTQ youth group promoted May as now, right before Pride
[03:48:37.220 --> 03:48:38.220]  Month, right?
[03:48:38.220 --> 03:48:41.580]  Right on schedule, right before Pride Month.
[03:48:41.580 --> 03:48:46.460]  May apparently is now National Masturbation Month for children.
[03:48:46.460 --> 03:48:51.980]  A state funded Planned Parenthood, LGBTQ youth group promoted May as National Masturbation
[03:48:51.980 --> 03:48:56.099]  Month according to their social media post.
[03:48:56.099 --> 03:49:02.820]  Run by Planned Parenthood, the Rainbow Room in Bucks County, Pennsylvania is a program
[03:49:02.820 --> 03:49:10.779]  for LGBTQ youth ages 14 to 21, as young as 14, okay?
[03:49:10.779 --> 03:49:17.340]  To learn about, quote, age appropriate sexuality education while connecting with others who
[03:49:17.340 --> 03:49:18.340]  are others.
[03:49:18.340 --> 03:49:20.580]  I don't know, maybe a pedophile?
[03:49:20.580 --> 03:49:24.859]  That's LGBTQ, so they're protected.
[03:49:24.859 --> 03:49:29.619]  According to the organization's website, the Rainbow Room, of course, promoted National
[03:49:29.619 --> 03:49:33.140]  Masturbation Month to sex positive people.
[03:49:33.140 --> 03:49:43.820]  These are quotes, sex positive people, 14 year olds, minors, underdeveloped, National
[03:49:43.820 --> 03:49:49.500]  Masturbation Month, guys, to children, LGBTQ.
[03:49:49.500 --> 03:49:54.420]  The Rainbow Room promoted National Masturbation Month to sex positive people.
[03:49:54.420 --> 03:49:55.900]  I wonder what that means to them.
[03:49:55.900 --> 03:49:57.619]  What do you think that means to a pedophile?
[03:49:57.619 --> 03:50:03.300]  Oh, I could just have sex with any child I want, 14 years old, I'll take that.
[03:50:03.300 --> 03:50:07.340]  I'm gay, so I'm protected, or I'm trans, so I'm protected.
[03:50:07.340 --> 03:50:12.099]  Come here, little kid, wanna have some consensual sex with me?
[03:50:12.099 --> 03:50:16.460]  It's okay, you don't have to tell your parents, because we're just gonna say, they're telling
[03:50:16.460 --> 03:50:17.660]  us we can't say gay.
[03:50:18.800 --> 03:50:22.800]  Unreal. On their Instagram account on Tuesday they posted this.
[03:50:22.800 --> 03:50:24.800]  Here's a quote.
[03:50:24.800 --> 03:50:26.800]  The month was...
[03:50:26.800 --> 03:50:30.800]  They're calling National Masturbation Month
[03:50:30.800 --> 03:50:32.800]  in honor of a so-called doctor,
[03:50:32.800 --> 03:50:34.800]  Jocelyn Elders,
[03:50:34.800 --> 03:50:36.800]  the first black U.S. Surgeon General.
[03:50:36.800 --> 03:50:38.800]  What the hell?
[03:50:38.800 --> 03:50:40.800]  Of course.
[03:50:40.800 --> 03:50:42.800]  Of course.
[03:50:42.800 --> 03:50:44.800]  They gotta hide it with a black person.
[03:50:44.800 --> 03:50:46.800]  They gotta hide everything with a minority.
[03:50:46.800 --> 03:50:48.800]  They use black people
[03:50:48.800 --> 03:50:50.800]  and minorities and protected classes.
[03:50:50.800 --> 03:50:52.800]  They're nothing but meat shields.
[03:50:52.800 --> 03:50:54.800]  That's it.
[03:50:54.800 --> 03:50:56.800]  Just throw the meat shield up.
[03:50:56.800 --> 03:50:58.800]  We can be protected.
[03:50:58.800 --> 03:51:00.800]  We can protect our pedophilia
[03:51:00.800 --> 03:51:02.800]  if we just throw a meat shield up.
[03:51:02.800 --> 03:51:04.800]  Just throw a homosexual up.
[03:51:04.800 --> 03:51:06.800]  We're protected.
[03:51:06.800 --> 03:51:08.800]  You can't tell me anything.
[03:51:08.800 --> 03:51:10.800]  Just throw a black girl up.
[03:51:10.800 --> 03:51:12.800]  We're protected.
[03:51:12.800 --> 03:51:14.800]  Black girl magic.
[03:51:15.500 --> 03:51:17.500]  Absolutely unreal.
[03:51:17.500 --> 03:51:19.500]  This is, this is it.
[03:51:19.500 --> 03:51:21.500]  Like this is it, right?
[03:51:21.500 --> 03:51:23.500]  Everything Alex has always ever talked about.
[03:51:23.500 --> 03:51:27.500]  The absolute normalization of pedophilia in society.
[03:51:27.500 --> 03:51:30.500]  National Masturbation Month for kids, you guys.
[03:51:31.600 --> 03:51:37.600]  They say masturbation is safe and normal, as it reduces stress, little kid.
[03:51:37.600 --> 03:51:42.600]  It helps you understand your body, little kid, and your sexual preferences, little kid.
[03:51:42.600 --> 03:51:48.600]  It releases tension, little kid, and can improve period cramps, little kid.
[03:51:48.600 --> 03:51:55.600]  The social media post stated, the group's social media post encouraged viewers to tell a friend.
[03:51:55.600 --> 03:52:00.600]  Of course, of course the pedophiles are like, hey, you got any friends?
[03:52:00.600 --> 03:52:02.600]  Got any friends?
[03:52:02.600 --> 03:52:07.600]  You got any friends that want to come and celebrate National Masturbation Month?
[03:52:07.600 --> 03:52:12.600]  We're all LGBTQ and gay, so it's a safe space, little girl.
[03:52:12.600 --> 03:52:14.600]  Invite a friend.
[03:52:14.600 --> 03:52:16.600]  Yeah, molestation.
[03:52:16.600 --> 03:52:18.600]  Yeah, pedophilia.
[03:52:18.600 --> 03:52:20.600]  Sex little kids.
[03:52:20.600 --> 03:52:22.600]  Yeah.
[03:52:23.200 --> 03:52:28.200]  Yeah, you think I'm obnoxious.
[03:52:28.700 --> 03:52:30.700]  These people, man.
[03:52:30.700 --> 03:52:32.700]  Absolutely unreal.
[03:52:32.700 --> 03:52:34.700]  The Bucks County chapter of the Rainbow Room
[03:52:34.700 --> 03:52:36.700]  works with the program ROYGBIV
[03:52:36.700 --> 03:52:38.700]  in Doylestown, Pennsylvania
[03:52:38.700 --> 03:52:40.700]  which aims to be a welcoming space.
[03:52:40.700 --> 03:52:42.700]  There you go!
[03:52:42.700 --> 03:52:44.700]  A welcoming space, a safe space
[03:52:44.700 --> 03:52:46.700]  for LGBTQIA
[03:52:46.700 --> 03:52:48.700]  plus kids ages
[03:52:48.700 --> 03:52:50.700]  10 to 14 years old,
[03:52:50.700 --> 03:52:52.700]  the website showed.
[03:52:52.700 --> 03:52:54.700]  This could go as low as 10.
[03:52:54.700 --> 03:52:56.700]  10, you guys!
[03:52:56.700 --> 03:52:58.700]  The weirdos out there, they're like,
[03:52:58.700 --> 03:53:00.700]  14 years old, that's an adult, man.
[03:53:02.700 --> 03:53:04.700]  What?
[03:53:04.700 --> 03:53:06.700]  Alright, dude.
[03:53:06.700 --> 03:53:08.700]  You probably got some CP
[03:53:08.700 --> 03:53:10.700]  in your phone or your laptop, man.
[03:53:12.700 --> 03:53:14.700]  Unreal, dude. Absolutely unreal.
[03:53:14.700 --> 03:53:16.700]  And yes, this organization is backed by
[03:53:16.700 --> 03:53:18.700]  Planned Parenthood. In October 2022,
[03:53:18.700 --> 03:53:20.700]  the Rainbow Room received
[03:53:20.700 --> 03:53:22.700]  a grant, a state grant
[03:53:22.700 --> 03:53:24.700]  of $630,000
[03:53:24.700 --> 03:53:26.700]  to expand
[03:53:26.700 --> 03:53:28.700]  the reach of the Rainbow Room
[03:53:28.700 --> 03:53:30.700]  within Doylestown, Pennsylvania
[03:53:30.700 --> 03:53:32.700]  according to a lawmaker's press release.
[03:53:32.700 --> 03:53:34.700]  So they're spending hundreds
[03:53:34.700 --> 03:53:36.700]  of thousands of dollars
[03:53:36.700 --> 03:53:38.700]  to pump into the Rainbow Room.
[03:53:38.700 --> 03:53:40.700]  Yeah, little kid! Come into the Rainbow Room!
[03:53:40.700 --> 03:53:42.700]  Yeah!
[03:53:42.700 --> 03:53:44.700]  Come sit on the lap of a tranny!
[03:53:44.700 --> 03:53:46.700]  You wanna sit on a
[03:53:46.700 --> 03:53:48.700]  grown man's boner?
[03:53:48.700 --> 03:53:50.700]  Little 10-year-old, come here!
[03:53:50.700 --> 03:53:52.700]  Come to the Rainbow Room
[03:53:52.700 --> 03:53:54.700]  where you can get touched! And it's safe!
[03:53:54.700 --> 03:53:56.700]  Cause if it's consensual,
[03:53:56.700 --> 03:53:58.700]  it's okay! If you say
[03:53:58.700 --> 03:54:00.700]  it's okay, little kid, that I
[03:54:00.700 --> 03:54:02.700]  can touch you with my penis,
[03:54:02.700 --> 03:54:04.700]  we're all good! And also,
[03:54:04.700 --> 03:54:06.700]  just some extra insurance!
[03:54:06.700 --> 03:54:08.700]  An insurance policy! I'm a
[03:54:08.700 --> 03:54:10.700]  homosexual, so you can't say anything
[03:54:10.700 --> 03:54:12.700]  against me!
[03:54:14.700 --> 03:54:16.700]  This is so insane.
[03:54:16.700 --> 03:54:18.700]  National Masturbation Month.
[03:54:18.700 --> 03:54:20.700]  630K.
[03:54:22.700 --> 03:54:24.700]  To indoctrinate your children with their pedophilia.
[03:54:24.700 --> 03:54:26.700]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:54:26.700 --> 03:54:28.700]  In what universe
[03:54:28.700 --> 03:54:30.700]  do children need to be celebrating
[03:54:30.700 --> 03:54:32.700]  masturbation?
[03:54:32.700 --> 03:54:34.700]  It's one thing for a parent
[03:54:34.700 --> 03:54:36.700]  to have a very private
[03:54:36.700 --> 03:54:38.700]  conversation with their child.
[03:54:38.700 --> 03:54:40.700]  The birds and the bees.
[03:54:40.700 --> 03:54:42.700]  Hey, touching yourself
[03:54:42.700 --> 03:54:44.700]  is, you know,
[03:54:44.700 --> 03:54:46.700]  in the eyes of God, it's not a very good
[03:54:46.700 --> 03:54:48.700]  thing. That's a conversation
[03:54:48.700 --> 03:54:50.700]  for a responsible parent
[03:54:50.700 --> 03:54:52.700]  to have with their child
[03:54:52.700 --> 03:54:54.700]  when they feel that they're ready.
[03:54:54.700 --> 03:54:56.700]  Not to be all sexual and make the child
[03:54:56.700 --> 03:54:58.700]  feel like they're sex positive.
[03:55:00.700 --> 03:55:02.700]  The child's sex positive, so
[03:55:02.700 --> 03:55:04.700]  come to the Rainbow Room, and yeah,
[03:55:04.700 --> 03:55:06.700]  we got sodomy, we got dildos,
[03:55:06.700 --> 03:55:08.700]  we got gay sex, we got
[03:55:08.700 --> 03:55:10.700]  trannies, we got drag queen
[03:55:10.700 --> 03:55:12.700]  pedo time! Come to the Rainbow Room
[03:55:12.700 --> 03:55:14.700]  and it's a safe space!
[03:55:15.700 --> 03:55:17.700]  I'm telling you guys, man,
[03:55:17.700 --> 03:55:19.700]  I'm telling you, this is how the pedophilia
[03:55:19.700 --> 03:55:21.700]  is being normalized.
[03:55:21.700 --> 03:55:23.700]  I always wondered how
[03:55:23.700 --> 03:55:25.700]  it would be done.
[03:55:25.700 --> 03:55:27.700]  How would they get society
[03:55:27.700 --> 03:55:29.700]  to view the molestation
[03:55:29.700 --> 03:55:31.700]  of children as normal?
[03:55:31.700 --> 03:55:33.700]  The rape of children, the sexual
[03:55:33.700 --> 03:55:35.700]  indoctrination of children.
[03:55:35.700 --> 03:55:37.700]  Well, they're doing it
[03:55:37.700 --> 03:55:39.700]  through the homosexuals.
[03:55:39.700 --> 03:55:41.700]  They're doing it through the so-called LGBTQ.
[03:55:41.700 --> 03:55:43.700]  They're doing it through the so-called
[03:55:43.700 --> 03:55:45.700]  rainbow flag. They're doing it through
[03:55:45.700 --> 03:55:47.700]  this community
[03:55:47.700 --> 03:55:49.700]  that is untouchable.
[03:55:49.700 --> 03:55:51.700]  You say anything,
[03:55:51.700 --> 03:55:53.700]  you get HR called
[03:55:53.700 --> 03:55:55.700]  on you. You say anything,
[03:55:55.700 --> 03:55:57.700]  you get canceled publicly.
[03:55:57.700 --> 03:55:59.700]  You say anything. Why do you think I'm saying this on InfoWars?
[03:55:59.700 --> 03:56:01.700]  There's really not many places
[03:56:01.700 --> 03:56:03.700]  you could say the things I'm saying right now
[03:56:03.700 --> 03:56:05.700]  because it is socially unacceptable
[03:56:05.700 --> 03:56:07.700]  to call people out.
[03:56:07.700 --> 03:56:09.700]  Because they're a protected class, Drew. Don't you understand?
[03:56:09.700 --> 03:56:11.700]  You gotta be politically correct.
[03:56:11.700 --> 03:56:13.700]  They're a protected class. Don't you understand?
[03:56:13.700 --> 03:56:15.700]  So how do you
[03:56:15.700 --> 03:56:17.700]  get people to accept pedophilia
[03:56:17.700 --> 03:56:19.700]  and grooming? Well, you do it through the
[03:56:19.700 --> 03:56:21.700]  protected class because you can't say
[03:56:21.700 --> 03:56:23.700]  anything against them. Wow.
[03:56:23.700 --> 03:56:25.700]  Checkmate.
[03:56:25.700 --> 03:56:27.700]  These people are good, man. They know what they're doing.
[03:56:27.700 --> 03:56:29.700]  But you know what?
[03:56:29.700 --> 03:56:31.700]  We are in
[03:56:31.700 --> 03:56:33.700]  a place in the timeline
[03:56:33.700 --> 03:56:35.700]  where it is time for alpha males
[03:56:35.700 --> 03:56:37.700]  to breach the matrix,
[03:56:37.700 --> 03:56:39.700]  pull people out.
[03:56:39.700 --> 03:56:41.700]  Jack them out of the system.
[03:56:41.700 --> 03:56:43.700]  By doing so,
[03:56:43.700 --> 03:56:45.700]  we do that through truth
[03:56:45.700 --> 03:56:47.700]  unapologetically.
[03:56:47.700 --> 03:56:49.700]  My style is loud. I don't care.
[03:56:49.700 --> 03:56:51.700]  But truth unapologetically.
[03:56:51.700 --> 03:56:53.700]  Not for the sake of being offensive,
[03:56:53.700 --> 03:56:55.700]  but for the sake of telling the truth
[03:56:55.700 --> 03:56:57.700]  so that minds can be unlocked.
[03:56:57.700 --> 03:56:59.700]  Don't cuck out and be afraid to hurt
[03:56:59.700 --> 03:57:01.700]  somebody's feelings.
[03:57:01.700 --> 03:57:03.700]  Don't cuck out and be a total beta.
[03:57:03.700 --> 03:57:05.700]  That's beta energy. We are done
[03:57:05.700 --> 03:57:07.700]  with the beta energy.
[03:57:07.700 --> 03:57:09.700]  We are done with the beta energy.
[03:57:09.700 --> 03:57:11.700]  We are done with the political correctness.
[03:57:11.700 --> 03:57:13.700]  We are done trying to walk on
[03:57:13.700 --> 03:57:15.700]  eggshells, trying to tell the truth as nice
[03:57:15.700 --> 03:57:17.700]  as possible because we don't want to hurt the safe
[03:57:17.700 --> 03:57:19.700]  space people. No, no, no. Tell the truth
[03:57:19.700 --> 03:57:21.700]  at all costs. Tell the
[03:57:21.700 --> 03:57:23.700]  truth at all costs. You want to
[03:57:23.700 --> 03:57:25.700]  save the country? It starts by telling
[03:57:25.700 --> 03:57:27.700]  the truth, exposing the truth,
[03:57:27.700 --> 03:57:29.700]  exposing the lies, and exposing these
[03:57:29.700 --> 03:57:31.700]  people for who they truly are.
[03:57:31.700 --> 03:57:33.700]  We need to bring shame back to
[03:57:33.700 --> 03:57:35.700]  stuff like this, I'll tell you that.
[03:57:35.700 --> 03:57:37.700]  That's exactly why, legally and lawfully,
[03:57:37.700 --> 03:57:39.700]  the death penalty is needed for pedophiles.
[03:57:39.700 --> 03:57:41.700]  If we can't do that, what do we have?
[03:57:41.700 --> 03:57:43.700]  I'll see all of you guys on the next one.
[03:57:43.700 --> 03:57:45.700]  Follow me on Twitter, links in the bio
[03:57:45.700 --> 03:57:47.700]  to all my shows.
[03:57:47.700 --> 03:57:49.700]  Just weeks ago, I warned the
[03:57:49.700 --> 03:57:51.700]  world that the globalists were going to
[03:57:51.700 --> 03:57:53.700]  move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[03:57:53.700 --> 03:57:55.700]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing
[03:57:55.700 --> 03:57:57.700]  that ever happened. They've got quadrillions
[03:57:57.700 --> 03:57:59.700]  of stolen money. They only had Tucker Carlson
[03:57:59.700 --> 03:58:01.700]  on the air because they believed they could control him.
[03:58:01.700 --> 03:58:03.700]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken
[03:58:03.700 --> 03:58:05.700]  off the air. It's the same thing with Infowars.
[03:58:05.700 --> 03:58:07.700]  But Infowars is not owned by
[03:58:07.700 --> 03:58:09.700]  Fox or controlled by George Soros
[03:58:09.700 --> 03:58:11.700]  or owned by Spotify
[03:58:11.700 --> 03:58:13.700]  like Joe Rogan. We are only
[03:58:13.700 --> 03:58:15.700]  beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[03:58:15.700 --> 03:58:17.700]  And when you support us, we're
[03:58:17.700 --> 03:58:19.700]  unstoppable. I'm not underwritten
[03:58:19.700 --> 03:58:21.700]  by Rupert Murdoch or
[03:58:21.700 --> 03:58:23.700]  by George Soros. I'm underwritten
[03:58:23.700 --> 03:58:25.700]  by you, which is
[03:58:25.700 --> 03:58:27.700]  we the people. So I want to thank you for
[03:58:27.700 --> 03:58:29.700]  your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[03:58:29.700 --> 03:58:31.700]  please don't take Infowars
[03:58:31.700 --> 03:58:33.700]  for granted. We're barely hanging
[03:58:33.700 --> 03:58:35.700]  on. We need your word of mouth, your prayer,
[03:58:35.700 --> 03:58:37.700]  your financial support, while getting great products
[03:58:37.700 --> 03:58:39.700]  at the same time at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:58:39.700 --> 03:58:41.700]  So don't procrastinate. Go to Infowarsstore.com,
[03:58:41.700 --> 03:58:43.700]  get amazing products that keep us
[03:58:43.700 --> 03:58:45.700]  on the air, and never submit
[03:58:45.700 --> 03:58:47.700]  to these tyrants.
[03:58:47.700 --> 03:58:49.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great
[03:58:49.700 --> 03:58:51.700]  Reset and War for the World, is a historic
[03:58:51.700 --> 03:58:53.700]  book that documents the globalists in their own
[03:58:53.700 --> 03:58:55.700]  words, plan for our future.
[03:58:55.700 --> 03:58:57.700]  That is a hellish future. Now you'll
[03:58:57.700 --> 03:58:59.700]  always, while they still allow books, I guess
[03:58:59.700 --> 03:59:01.700]  they're starting to ban them, be able to get an
[03:59:01.700 --> 03:59:03.700]  unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World
[03:59:03.700 --> 03:59:05.700]  at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsstore.com.
[03:59:05.700 --> 03:59:07.700]  But you will never be able
[03:59:07.700 --> 03:59:09.700]  to get another signed copy of the book
[03:59:09.700 --> 03:59:11.700]  after the signed copies we got
[03:59:11.700 --> 03:59:13.700]  run out, and there's about a thousand left
[03:59:13.700 --> 03:59:15.700]  of them right now. So get your copy
[03:59:15.700 --> 03:59:17.700]  of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:59:17.700 --> 03:59:19.700]  a signed copy, at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:59:19.700 --> 03:59:21.700]  And there is a markup there because
[03:59:21.700 --> 03:59:23.700]  this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:59:23.700 --> 03:59:25.700]  So you won't just have this historic memento
[03:59:25.700 --> 03:59:27.700]  and this powerful book, you'll also
[03:59:27.700 --> 03:59:29.700]  know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[03:59:29.700 --> 03:59:31.700]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies
[03:59:31.700 --> 03:59:33.700]  of the book, or unsigned copies.
[03:59:33.700 --> 03:59:35.700]  But I want to encourage all of you
[03:59:35.700 --> 03:59:37.700]  who haven't yet, to go to Infowarsstore.com
[03:59:37.700 --> 03:59:39.700]  and get a signed copy, and
[03:59:39.700 --> 03:59:41.700]  buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the
[03:59:41.700 --> 03:59:43.700]  library, or give them to the local
[03:59:43.700 --> 03:59:45.700]  school. This is an Infowar, I'm counting
[03:59:45.700 --> 03:59:47.700]  on you, and thank you for your support.
[03:59:49.700 --> 03:59:51.700]  If you are receiving this
[03:59:51.700 --> 03:59:53.700]  transmission, you are the
[03:59:53.700 --> 03:59:55.700]  resistance.
