[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say, I don't know what's
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000]  It's Monday, July 10th, 2023.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we've got another incredibly important transmission
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]  lined up here for you today.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  Well, I've got a tall order.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]  I didn't cover probably half the incredibly important news last night, and then there's
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]  even more insane news today.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000]  And so we have cleared the decks of guests, and I am going to savage through every single
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]  piece of this critical information and get it on record.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]  I can probably do that in the first hour and a half, and then open the phones up.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]  We have the Sound of Freedom people coming on in the next three days.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]  The director, the actual guy that's based on the hero, and the great actor who played
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]  Christ, obviously, Caviezel in The Passion of Christ, who played the part of the Sound
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]  of Freedom.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000]  I've got to say, mainstream media attacking Sound of Freedom and saying it's brain worms
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]  for dads and things like that are sick people.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000]  I went to it last night, and I didn't get to watch the movie because my wife got too
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]  upset and had to leave 30 minutes in.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]  And that's because she watches the show, she reads the news, she knows how real this is.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]  She wasn't doing it to be dramatic.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]  She said, this is too upsetting.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]  I know it's all real.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  I can't watch this.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]  And so I took her home.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  And so I'm going to go back today after the show so that I can properly talk about it.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  But, I mean, I have to tell you, I got so upset yesterday on the Sunday show, even before
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]  I tried to go sit with her last night, that I just spent basically the whole show mad
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]  at the controlled corporate press over the fact that I literally have hundreds of articles
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]  in front of me, dozens in front of me.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]  I've seen hundreds.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]  You've seen them.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]  Literally saying that don't go see this movie and it's bad.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]  Even though it's now number one.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]  Which shows how sick the establishment is.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]  It shows they don't have power anymore.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]  But also the crew noticed, I didn't notice this, good job crew, CBS News and others.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.000]  Eight years ago, when the Underground Railroad began to save thousands of children on record,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000]  that they had them on saying you guys did a great job.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]  So we're talking about hundreds of arrests of pedophiles and sex slavers.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]  Thousands of children saved, 6,000.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]  And this is on record and the media is saying it isn't real now.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  And that it's, quote, QAnon.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]  And that's why The Globalist had the QAnon movement.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]  It was a Pizzagate 2.0.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  The left spins things and says that Jones has come out and said Pizzagate isn't real.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]  No, I've said Pizzagate's completely real.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  The QAnon and the New York Times and CNN focused on a pizza place that didn't have a dungeon,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]  that didn't have a basement, to then say everything else was fake by focusing on that.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]  And then I only covered the fake story and later said, well, yeah, it was a setup, but we didn't create it.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]  The media spun it and said that I said there was no children in sex slavery.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]  Just like there's nowhere do I say I'm just an actor and this is all fake.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]  Though they say I said that in court.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]  $1 million reward, where's the video?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]  My lawyer didn't say it either.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]  So it's like they say Trump said Hispanics are horrible, they're all criminals.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]  He said a lot of great people coming across the border and a lot of criminals too, we got to screen them.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]  There is no clip of Trump saying Hispanics are horrible people.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  Okay, and everybody knows that now, but they keep saying it on CNN.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  So this is really sick how they use the QAnon disinfo to now basically come out and say this is all QAnon when it's not.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]  It's documented and it's true.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]  We'll talk about that a lot more today.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  It's a big broadcast.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:25.000]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  Look it up.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]  We have the very best gravity fed filter system out there.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]  The Alexa Pure ready to ship to you right now.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]  It is amazing.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]  It's great for your home, your business.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.

[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]  That is a huge discount.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]  You need this filter.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:11.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000]  All right.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000]  I'm like a starving dog that has been led into a butcher shop full of meat.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]  I'm like a sheep dog that's had a coyote fall right into his jaws.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000]  I'm like a bird dog that just found a whole cubby of quail.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]  I am over the target.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]  I'm trying to sit here and think what the biggest story is because that's important.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]  And I don't mean the biggest story the media is making.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]  The biggest thing going on right now.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000]  And it's really hard because there's a group of things that are all interconnected that orbit each other.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000]  But to pick out the central body is difficult.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]  You have a mass awakening to the world government and the central bank digital currencies.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]  That is the total cashless society.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]  Take over.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]  Market the beast.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]  Jewel in the crown control system.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]  Mass awakening to that.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]  Mass resistance as they begin to roll it out.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]  That is paramount when it comes to the hardware of control.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]  Just got chills.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]  Got a big stack on that.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]  Wow.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]  But the awakening is really intensifying.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]  You can feel it.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]  You can see it.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]  The force is strong with the public now.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000]  Then you've got the jumping of the Megalodon shark with controlled corporate media.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  Dinosaur media.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]  Rear guard disinformation.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]  Enemy of the people systems.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  Everywhere.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  I mean every major publication I've seen.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]  I'm just scrolling through home pages.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]  Is attacking sound of freedom.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]  That is on record 6,000 children saved.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]  Hundreds of pedophiles convicted.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]  No one can deny it.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  And they're jumping the shark saying it's superhero brain worms for dads and it's fake.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]  And it's QAnon and all this crap.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.000]  So CBS and ABC and NBC eight years ago, six years ago, five years ago were saying oh great job Underground Railroad.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]  And the heroes and what they did.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]  And getting people back from sex slavery.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]  And now in 2023 the media is such an open evil monster.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000]  That they're staggeringly attacking and saying this doesn't exist.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]  You know why?
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]  Because they're desperate.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]  Before they're like oh look at these heroes.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]  Yeah they're saving some kids.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]  Okay but now that it's known the system runs it.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]  And that the Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence agencies are controlling people through pedophile networks.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]  Which is admitted.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]  Which has come out that they would only put mayors in in Afghanistan who are pedophiles they control.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]  They would then give them ten year old boys to control them.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]  That's Associated Press two years ago.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]  I mean I've got thousands of cases of articles about this.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]  So we've got that big stack of news.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  I'm going to show you AP that never got any coverage.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  About 10,000 kidnapped kids out of Haiti.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]  And the Clinton Foundation running the kids.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]  That's AP.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]  Yeah Chelsea Clinton now heads the foundation.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]  I mean these people mean business.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]  These are real monsters.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  And the scale of it is so insane it's hard to even fathom.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]  And then the open border and all the smuggling there.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]  And the Senate report confirming it.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000]  I mean it's just boggling that they catch convicted three, four time pedophiles with little kids.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000]  And the federal government tells the federal judges you are not allowed to charge them.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]  The Attorney General will not let them charge them.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  You heard me right.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  The judges and the magistrates are not allowed to charge them with felonies.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]  They're only allowed to hold them for violating crossing the border and that's two weeks.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]  Two weeks.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]  And they have real trouble continuing their job.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000]  But if they don't continue the job and continue to follow the criminal orders then there's no one there in any screening.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]  And now Biden a month ago said no more DNA testing of kids and no more biometrics when we get them.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]  We're just going to turn them loose to whoever is there.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]  Wow.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]  And that is a question.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]  Did the Border Patrol quit?
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]  Did the judges quit?
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]  Did the magistrates quit?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  Or do you say well I'll stay here to at least report on the crime and then try to get stuff out to people?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]  This is all in Congress.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  This is all on C-SPAN.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  And these people are so desperate.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  They reach out to me.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]  I mean high level.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]  High as you get except for the Attorney General.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  Yeah.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]  As high as you get in the food chain people are going what do we do Mr. Jones?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]  Well gee can Tucker have us on?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]  Can Joe Rogan have us on?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]  We want to come on.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]  We want to give you this intel.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  And I go let me guess you've already given all these people this information.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]  Yeah we have.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]  We've come to you to see if we can help.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]  See I'm kind of the last line.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]  But people now know like that guy was right.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]  He's demonized.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  We're not supposed to talk about him or talk to him but he was right.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]  Yeah I'm right.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]  Skip this break.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]  So.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  Yeah times are bad folks.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]  Everything's insane.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]  That's why now the show's not like it used to be.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]  I mean this is do or die time ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]  So.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]  So you have the central bank digital currencies coming out.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]  You have all the pedophile news coming out.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]  You have all the fact that Ukraine's losing the war.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]  So now they're sending high tech cluster bombs.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]  Because both sides are using cluster bombs.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]  A shotgun you could technically call a cluster bomb.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]  It's a bunch of Connecticut stuff.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]  Kinetic stuff.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]  Same cartridge.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]  But the whole hypocrisy of that and the rest of it what that signals is massive.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]  50 cents says Los Angeles is finished after zero bail.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]  Ballsy reinstated.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  It's going to literally be.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  Road Warrior meets Grand Theft Auto.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]  I mean it's already hundreds of murders.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]  A week.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]  And now it's just going to be total complete Road Warrior insanity.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000]  We have the UN announcing a world government regulation and censorship system.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]  Called iVerify.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  That'll be the worldwide web ID's been announced.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]  That ties the central bank digital currencies.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]  We have Biden literally.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]  Stumbling around like a lobotomized ferret.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]  At.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]  Windsor.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]  Palace and all the rest of it with.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]  King Charles.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]  They both go and get lectured by the climate czar.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]  John Kerry we got video all that.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]  Former head of disinformation governance board claims that the government flagging content and having it censors.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]  Has nothing to do with censorship.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]  And the three cities have nothing to do with comedy.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]  Transgender woman wins Miss Netherlands pageant for the first time.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]  Set to win Miss Universe.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]  It's not a woman.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  It's all part of the brainwashing.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]  People are fighting back in San Francisco.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]  Activists putting cones on hoods of self-driving cars to stop them in San Francisco.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]  The gold standard is back.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]  BRICS introduced gold backed reserve currency.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]  We got big developments in China.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]  Blocking rare earth minerals to the United States.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]  Which will cripple.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]  Beyond cripple.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]  That will bring semiconductor production to an absolute standstill.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]  After estimated supplies of gallium and geranium.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]  Not a plant.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]  Pronounce that correctly.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]  A rare earth mineral.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]  Have been completely halted.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]  You're like well why does China have worldwide control.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]  Of minerals that are on four continents we know of.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]  Oh.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]  Because they were strategically put in that position by the big banks.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]  No one else is allowed to explore them.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]  Or the environmental regulators shut you down.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]  Or UN troops come with paramilitary and helicopters and kill you.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  You're not allowed to sell diamonds that aren't owned by the De Beers and the Oppenheimer system.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]  That was set up 150 years ago by Cecil Rhodes.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]  Look it up.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]  Diamonds all over Africa just lay on the ground.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]  It's everywhere.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  It's not even a precious stone.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]  It's not even semi-precious.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]  Rubies are.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]  Rubies are actually a very rare thing.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]  Emeralds are way more rare than a diamond.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]  And the point is, well how do they do that?
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]  Well that's the same way they do it with rare earth minerals.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  The New World Order, the globalists, they decided no one else is allowed to have rare earth minerals but China.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]  To again, because they were set up as the industrial base of the world for the globalists.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  They were not supposed to have a big military.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]  They were not supposed to claim the South China Sea.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]  Nine years ago they told the globalists, go to hell.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]  We are now going to take over the New World Order from you.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]  We're going to take the plan for the social credit score, the New World Order, the total control.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  But we're double crossing you.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000]  And that's where we are now.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]  So we've got that.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]  And then we've got all this other news here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]  Look at this photo I'm going to put on screen.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  And I'm going to spend some time on this coming up.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]  Next hour.
[00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:53.961]  Zoom in on his eyes, please.
[00:15:53.961 --> 00:15:57.961]  And it's not just this photo. This is in all his photos.
[00:16:00.961 --> 00:16:02.961]  This is Alexander Soros.
[00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:05.961]  He's in the hand of the 20-plus billion dollar operation.
[00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:07.961]  That's just the public money they've got.
[00:16:07.961 --> 00:16:12.961]  Family fortune comes from robbing Jews and then destroying pension funds.
[00:16:12.961 --> 00:16:17.961]  Look at those eyes. That is his official publicity photo that he puts out.
[00:16:17.961 --> 00:16:20.961]  Now, when you talk about unaware,
[00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:24.961]  if someone ever took a photo of me and I looked like that,
[00:16:24.961 --> 00:16:28.961]  I would check myself into a mental institution immediately or go see an exorcist.
[00:16:28.961 --> 00:16:32.961]  Now, it's not just that he looks super evil. He is super evil.
[00:16:32.961 --> 00:16:35.961]  But he's like all these other globalists.
[00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:39.961]  Completely loathsome and transparent.
[00:16:39.961 --> 00:16:43.961]  But this guy runs Antifa and funds the whole thing worldwide on record.
[00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:46.961]  This guy literally funds the defunding of the police.
[00:16:46.961 --> 00:16:51.961]  He funds the Black Lives Matter operations.
[00:16:51.961 --> 00:16:54.961]  The crime in the streets. All of it.
[00:16:54.961 --> 00:16:56.961]  And just look at him.
[00:16:56.961 --> 00:16:58.961]  He hates himself.
[00:16:58.961 --> 00:17:01.961]  He hates you.
[00:17:01.961 --> 00:17:03.961]  He hates God.
[00:17:03.961 --> 00:17:05.961]  He wants to be God.
[00:17:05.961 --> 00:17:08.961]  And that rat-like, dangerous monster
[00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:15.961]  has control of 900-plus district attorneys and county attorneys.
[00:17:15.961 --> 00:17:21.961]  Thousands of local judges and 22 state attorney generals
[00:17:21.961 --> 00:17:29.961]  literally go to seminars, are funded by him, and take orders from him.
[00:17:29.961 --> 00:17:32.961]  Dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of meetings at the White House
[00:17:32.961 --> 00:17:35.961]  with all the different national security advisors.
[00:17:35.961 --> 00:17:42.961]  This guy's let in on all the different briefings. All of it.
[00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:44.961]  And he's your new world order government.
[00:17:44.961 --> 00:17:47.961]  He's your Rothschild agent in charge.
[00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:50.961]  And he is a heat-seeking missile to destroy you
[00:17:50.961 --> 00:17:52.961]  and to take everything you've got.
[00:17:52.961 --> 00:17:54.961]  To cut off your energy.
[00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:56.961]  To destroy your children.
[00:17:56.961 --> 00:17:58.961]  To annihilate your borders.
[00:17:58.961 --> 00:18:01.961]  He is their general.
[00:18:01.961 --> 00:18:02.961]  Look at him.
[00:18:02.961 --> 00:18:07.961]  A predator that has nothing but disdain for our cities and our culture
[00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:08.961]  and our infrastructure.
[00:18:08.961 --> 00:18:15.961]  Who is here to destroy it and collapse it and loot it.
[00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:22.961]  You think about that long and hard, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:22.961 --> 00:18:24.961]  It's just like photos of Brian Stelter.
[00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:28.961]  These are publicity photos he releases of himself.
[00:18:28.961 --> 00:18:34.961]  These are things that he is proud of himself.
[00:18:35.961 --> 00:18:39.961]  And imagine if somebody came to your door and said,
[00:18:39.961 --> 00:18:42.961]  I want to sell you a vacuum cleaner or whatever.
[00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:43.961]  Traveling salesman.
[00:18:43.961 --> 00:18:49.961]  And they were looking at you like they want to kill you.
[00:18:49.961 --> 00:18:52.961]  You'd look to the people and see those eyes and go,
[00:18:52.961 --> 00:19:00.961]  whoo, that is a bad person.
[00:19:01.961 --> 00:19:03.961]  You're like, wow, you're supposed to be in prison.
[00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:04.961]  I can just look at you.
[00:19:04.961 --> 00:19:09.961]  In fact, I sent you guys a clip and I forgot to tell you where to cue it up to.
[00:19:09.961 --> 00:19:10.961]  It's my fault.
[00:19:10.961 --> 00:19:13.961]  It's the Beavis and Butt-head news series.
[00:19:13.961 --> 00:19:17.961]  My good buddy, Mike Judge, a number eight.
[00:19:17.961 --> 00:19:25.961]  Fast forward past Beavis talking to the fire demon to the part where it cuts,
[00:19:25.961 --> 00:19:29.961]  genius level, to a guy explaining how to create prison tattoo ink.
[00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:34.961]  Because I want to play this and talk about Alexander Soros right here.
[00:19:34.961 --> 00:19:38.961]  Because they make a point, it's the voice of Mike Judge,
[00:19:38.961 --> 00:19:39.961]  that, hey, look at this guy.
[00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:41.961]  He didn't even commit a crime to go to prison.
[00:19:41.961 --> 00:19:44.961]  We can just look at him and tell you he needs to be in prison.
[00:19:44.961 --> 00:19:46.961]  It's true.
[00:19:46.961 --> 00:19:47.961]  The cops are rolling down the road.
[00:19:47.961 --> 00:19:48.961]  They see this guy.
[00:19:48.961 --> 00:19:49.961]  It could be a white guy.
[00:19:49.961 --> 00:19:50.961]  It could be a black guy.
[00:19:50.961 --> 00:19:55.961]  You instantly pick up on, it's true, the criminal anatomy, the criminal look,
[00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:56.961]  the way of talking.
[00:19:56.961 --> 00:19:58.961]  It's like, wow, that person's going to prison.
[00:19:58.961 --> 00:20:01.961]  Like you meet people and you go, oh, they got a little kid.
[00:20:01.961 --> 00:20:04.961]  He'll be in prison by the time he's 15, and they almost always are.
[00:20:04.961 --> 00:20:06.961]  Yeah, nothing against this guy.
[00:20:06.961 --> 00:20:09.961]  I'm sad for him, but I'm saying, I would let this guy in my house.
[00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:12.961]  Because a lot of times they're reformed.
[00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:15.961]  If he'd been out of jail for 10 years, he had a good resume and good reviews,
[00:20:15.961 --> 00:20:18.961]  and he might have killed somebody, but, you know, he has that criminal look,
[00:20:18.961 --> 00:20:20.961]  but he's got a good roofing company.
[00:20:20.961 --> 00:20:21.961]  I'd say, yeah, you can do my roof.
[00:20:21.961 --> 00:20:27.961]  Alexander Soros has a cryptic, I'm going to stab you in the back,
[00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:31.961]  I'm going to put you in a basement and chop you up and eat you, level,
[00:20:31.961 --> 00:20:34.961]  10 times more dangerous than this ex-con.
[00:20:34.961 --> 00:20:37.961]  Who, if you saw him in a grocery store,
[00:20:37.961 --> 00:20:40.961]  you'd kind of make sure you didn't bump into him and cause a problem.
[00:20:40.961 --> 00:20:43.961]  Because, you know, he didn't want to, but you disrespected him,
[00:20:43.961 --> 00:20:46.961]  so he had to stab you.
[00:20:46.961 --> 00:20:51.961]  I was up in Omaha, and he'd forgotten he was at the hospital with my wife's dad.
[00:20:51.961 --> 00:20:54.961]  It was like 11 o'clock at night, so my wife goes to the grocery store,
[00:20:54.961 --> 00:20:56.961]  and it was not a very nice neighborhood.
[00:20:56.961 --> 00:20:58.961]  And I walk in, there's a black thug and a white thug and a Hispanic thug,
[00:20:58.961 --> 00:20:59.961]  and they go, hey, man, what's up?
[00:20:59.961 --> 00:21:00.961]  How are you doing tonight?
[00:21:00.961 --> 00:21:03.961]  They wanted me to disrespect them so they could start a fight with me.
[00:21:03.961 --> 00:21:05.961]  And I just went, yeah, man, have a great night.
[00:21:05.961 --> 00:21:07.961]  And they're like, okay, cool.
[00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:09.961]  Those are just play thugs, okay?
[00:21:09.961 --> 00:21:15.961]  Alexander Soros literally runs an army of destruction worldwide,
[00:21:15.961 --> 00:21:18.961]  and he controls the media to the extent that it's covering up a child kidnapping.
[00:21:18.961 --> 00:21:20.961]  Okay?
[00:21:20.961 --> 00:21:27.961]  So let's go ahead and just roll this allegory of what I'm talking about, this example.
[00:21:27.961 --> 00:21:29.961]  Go ahead.
[00:21:29.961 --> 00:21:31.961]  How to make tattoo ink in prison.
[00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:35.961]  A soda can, some toilet tissue, some hair grease, and a saltine crackers box.
[00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:37.961]  Fold the tissue up and twist it.
[00:21:37.961 --> 00:21:39.961]  This guy is definitely a criminal.
[00:21:39.961 --> 00:21:40.961]  That's what it should look like.
[00:21:40.961 --> 00:21:42.961]  What accent is this?
[00:21:42.961 --> 00:21:43.961]  Take your hair grease and fill up.
[00:21:43.961 --> 00:21:46.961]  It's like a prison accent.
[00:21:46.961 --> 00:21:48.961]  Yeah, I want to talk like that.
[00:21:48.961 --> 00:21:51.961]  Add some toilet tissue, saltine cracker box.
[00:21:51.961 --> 00:21:53.961]  Tear off three sheets of toilet tissue.
[00:21:53.961 --> 00:21:55.961]  Twist it up real tight.
[00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:58.961]  Light your candle and set your box over top of it to collect all the soot.
[00:21:58.961 --> 00:22:00.961]  Set your box over top of it.
[00:22:00.961 --> 00:22:02.961]  Set the box on two pencils so it can breathe.
[00:22:02.961 --> 00:22:04.961]  Set it on two pencils so it can breathe.
[00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:07.961]  After about an hour, you can see all the soot that's caught inside the box.
[00:22:07.961 --> 00:22:09.961]  After about an hour, you can see all the soot that's caught inside the box.
[00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:11.961]  Scrape it into a pile.
[00:22:11.961 --> 00:22:14.961]  This, like, makes me want to go to jail.
[00:22:14.961 --> 00:22:16.961]  Add a tiny bit of hand sanitizer or body wash.
[00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:19.961]  What did this guy do to get in prison, I wonder?
[00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:21.961]  He didn't have to do anything.
[00:22:21.961 --> 00:22:24.961]  They just let him right in.
[00:22:24.961 --> 00:22:26.961]  Yeah, they just looked at him like,
[00:22:26.961 --> 00:22:29.961]  Sir, I can tell by looking at you that you're going to be in jail eventually,
[00:22:29.961 --> 00:22:33.961]  so let's just get this over with.
[00:22:33.961 --> 00:22:34.961]  Only a drop or two of water.
[00:22:34.961 --> 00:22:37.961]  It's like a pretty nice prison he's in here, you know?
[00:22:37.961 --> 00:22:42.961]  No, he's back at his mom's.
[00:22:42.961 --> 00:22:43.961]  His mom's going to be like,
[00:22:43.961 --> 00:22:48.961]  Did you take my saltine cracker box and use it for your tattoo again?
[00:22:48.961 --> 00:22:49.961]  Damn it, boy.
[00:22:49.961 --> 00:22:51.961]  You ain't never going to eat chicken in this house again
[00:22:51.961 --> 00:22:54.961]  if you don't give me back my saltine cracker box.
[00:22:54.961 --> 00:22:55.961]  What am I going to do if I kill your daddy
[00:22:55.961 --> 00:22:59.961]  and have to tattoo a teardrop next to my eye?
[00:22:59.961 --> 00:23:01.961]  How am I going to do that without soot?
[00:23:01.961 --> 00:23:05.961]  Every tattoo I have is that ink, and they're, like, ten years old.
[00:23:05.961 --> 00:23:08.961]  Hey, fire, I'm back.
[00:23:08.961 --> 00:23:11.961]  Did you run around the track four times,
[00:23:11.961 --> 00:23:14.961]  completing a distance of one mile?
[00:23:14.961 --> 00:23:16.961]  Well, let's just stop.
[00:23:16.961 --> 00:23:17.961]  And I am name-dropping
[00:23:17.961 --> 00:23:20.961]  because I don't care about any of the Hollywood people,
[00:23:20.961 --> 00:23:23.961]  but I do admire people like Mike Judge,
[00:23:23.961 --> 00:23:25.961]  who I'm good friends with and I've been so busy.
[00:23:25.961 --> 00:23:26.961]  We haven't hung out in years.
[00:23:26.961 --> 00:23:29.961]  We just hang out all the time, like every week for years.
[00:23:29.961 --> 00:23:31.961]  He lives outside Austin.
[00:23:31.961 --> 00:23:33.961]  I'm going to call him today.
[00:23:33.961 --> 00:23:34.961]  My wife this morning, she goes,
[00:23:34.961 --> 00:23:36.961]  I don't care about all your other friends,
[00:23:36.961 --> 00:23:38.961]  but I really want to hang out with Mike Judge.
[00:23:38.961 --> 00:23:39.961]  She's hung out with him before,
[00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:41.961]  but I was like, yeah, well, I'm going to call Mike.
[00:23:41.961 --> 00:23:43.961]  I'm going to call Mike today, but, man, he's a genius.
[00:23:43.961 --> 00:23:45.961]  Anyways, back to what I was saying.
[00:23:45.961 --> 00:23:48.961]  You think Mike Judge will be hanging out with old Alexander Soros?
[00:23:48.961 --> 00:23:51.961]  I don't think so.
[00:23:51.961 --> 00:23:53.961]  You don't think he'll get the invite out to his ranch,
[00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:54.961]  do a little shoot, need some barbecue.
[00:23:54.961 --> 00:23:56.961]  And my point is, these people are uncool,
[00:23:56.961 --> 00:23:58.961]  they know they're uncool,
[00:23:58.961 --> 00:24:03.961]  and they want to dominate you because they feel so weak.
[00:24:03.961 --> 00:24:05.961]  And you look at those eyes, son.
[00:24:06.961 --> 00:24:09.961]  Those eyes are way more evil than Charlie Manson's.
[00:24:09.961 --> 00:24:12.961]  That is a shark eye, predator eye,
[00:24:12.961 --> 00:24:17.961]  that hates you with every bone in his body.
[00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:21.961]  And in his publicity photo that he posed for and that he took,
[00:24:21.961 --> 00:24:25.961]  that's the look he wants to telegraph to somebody.
[00:24:25.961 --> 00:24:27.961]  Let me tell you, if I'm looking at somebody like that,
[00:24:27.961 --> 00:24:29.961]  it means I'm about to break their neck.
[00:24:29.961 --> 00:24:31.961]  That's why you don't see me make those kind of looks,
[00:24:31.961 --> 00:24:33.961]  because I'm not going to sit here and make those kind of looks
[00:24:33.961 --> 00:24:36.961]  unless I intend to do something.
[00:24:36.961 --> 00:24:38.961]  And let me tell you, he is doing something.
[00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:40.961]  He's dangerous as hell.
[00:24:40.961 --> 00:24:42.961]  Tens of thousands of deaths conservatively
[00:24:42.961 --> 00:24:45.961]  by them letting armed criminals, murderers, rapists out of jail,
[00:24:45.961 --> 00:24:48.961]  sometimes without even charging them.
[00:24:48.961 --> 00:24:50.961]  And what did 50 Cent say?
[00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:52.961]  He's not a right winger.
[00:24:52.961 --> 00:24:58.961]  50 Cent says Los Angeles is finished after zero bail policy reinstatement.
[00:24:58.961 --> 00:25:02.961]  Watch how bad it gets.
[00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:04.961]  It's not fun when your house gets robbed once a week.
[00:25:04.961 --> 00:25:06.961]  It's not fun when you've got to shoot somebody because they're breaking into your house
[00:25:06.961 --> 00:25:08.961]  and then the DA charges you because you did it.
[00:25:08.961 --> 00:25:12.961]  It's not fun.
[00:25:12.961 --> 00:25:17.961]  In the club, rapper 50 Cent told followers that Los Angeles is finished.
[00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:18.961]  Wonder why.
[00:25:18.961 --> 00:25:21.961]  Well, they've had two different DAs put in by him.
[00:25:21.961 --> 00:25:22.961]  He runs it.
[00:25:22.961 --> 00:25:23.961]  He's been running it for a while.
[00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:25.961]  Soros' expiration date's been up for like 10 years.
[00:25:25.961 --> 00:25:28.961]  His daddy's, George.
[00:25:28.961 --> 00:25:35.961]  That guy is literally in control of the Biden Winehouse, 30-something years old.
[00:25:35.961 --> 00:25:36.961]  You think he's happy?
[00:25:36.961 --> 00:25:38.961]  He's a little chicken neck nobody likes?
[00:25:38.961 --> 00:25:45.961]  There's all these photos of him at Aleister Crowley rituals
[00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:47.961]  where they do mock human sacrifices.
[00:25:47.961 --> 00:25:51.961]  But let me tell you, through his money and our corrupt system being hijacked,
[00:25:51.961 --> 00:25:56.961]  he literally gets to rape this country with criminals and with drugs
[00:25:56.961 --> 00:25:58.961]  and with open borders and with human trafficking.
[00:25:58.961 --> 00:26:02.961]  He's the main one with the NGOs and the debit cards.
[00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:03.961]  He gets the money from the State Department,
[00:26:03.961 --> 00:26:09.961]  $5,000, $2,000 debit cards to invade Europe and invade the United States.
[00:26:09.961 --> 00:26:10.961]  He's doing it.
[00:26:10.961 --> 00:26:13.961]  The murder, the stabbings, the illegal aliens running around.
[00:26:13.961 --> 00:26:17.961]  That one guy stabbed, what was it, 14 children a few weeks ago in France?
[00:26:17.961 --> 00:26:18.961]  Screaming Allah Akbar.
[00:26:18.961 --> 00:26:22.961]  He did that.
[00:26:22.961 --> 00:26:23.961]  He's like, I'm big.
[00:26:23.961 --> 00:26:24.961]  I'm powerful.
[00:26:24.961 --> 00:26:28.961]  That's why he wears little red shoes, little red ties, little vampire outfits.
[00:26:28.961 --> 00:26:32.961]  When they do that, that red tie means you're a powerful corporate leader.
[00:26:32.961 --> 00:26:34.961]  Little red tie, red shoes means something completely different.
[00:26:34.961 --> 00:26:36.961]  Look it up.
[00:26:36.961 --> 00:26:42.961]  He's walking in your blood, baby.
[00:26:42.961 --> 00:26:47.961]  Just look at these people and just look at the smugness.
[00:26:47.961 --> 00:26:52.961]  Look at the enjoyment on his face.
[00:26:52.961 --> 00:26:53.961]  People are like, oh, that's not spirit cooking.
[00:26:54.961 --> 00:26:57.961]  They've released the video from that thing.
[00:26:57.961 --> 00:26:58.961]  We played part of it last week.
[00:26:58.961 --> 00:26:59.961]  Disgusting.
[00:26:59.961 --> 00:27:04.961]  People in vats of blood.
[00:27:04.961 --> 00:27:08.961]  They're alive and you come and dip a little ice cream spoon into it.
[00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:15.961]  Oh, they got this vampire facial place that was putting blood on people's faces.
[00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:17.961]  A bunch of folks just got HIV from it.
[00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:25.961]  The guy is a wannabe vampire.
[00:27:25.961 --> 00:27:29.961]  Can we come in with a Smashing Pumpkins song?
[00:27:29.961 --> 00:27:30.961]  It's their most famous one.
[00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:31.961]  I forget the name.
[00:27:31.961 --> 00:27:33.961]  Billy's a great guy.
[00:27:33.961 --> 00:27:34.961]  I listen to his music all the time.
[00:27:34.961 --> 00:27:39.961]  I can't remember the names of these things.
[00:27:39.961 --> 00:27:41.961]  The world is a vampire.
[00:27:41.961 --> 00:27:42.961]  You're like, yeah, but he doesn't live forever.
[00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:45.961]  His spirit moves on, though, through the bloodlines.
[00:27:45.961 --> 00:27:46.961]  Look at Prince Charles.
[00:27:46.961 --> 00:27:48.961]  He is of the line of Dracul.
[00:27:48.961 --> 00:27:51.961]  And so, of course, you're going to have a minion who thinks he's a vampire under him.
[00:27:55.130 --> 00:28:05.370]  But I've got a lot more to cover and get really hardcore when we come back.
[00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:10.010]  But the plan is to finish our cities, to cut our energy off, to shut us down, to bring
[00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:16.330]  us back into a post-industrial world where only the globalists have money and fuel and
[00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.290]  transportation and security.
[00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:22.050]  They're taking civilization away from us, a post-industrial war.
[00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.610]  They're at war with humanity.
[00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:29.250]  So yes, Los Angeles is finished by design, and we should stop letting people—no, George
[00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:33.490]  Soros couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag, neither could his degenerate son.
[00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:39.170]  But they can sure as hell turn the criminals loose to do it to us, and a capo or a don over
[00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:43.650]  an organized crime family whose people carry out crimes is more guilty than those that
[00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:45.410]  actually physically do it.
[00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:52.090]  Alexander Soros is an enemy of America and an enemy of the people, and he is guilty of
[00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:56.290]  I'm trying to destroy this country, and I pray that God brings justice upon him.
[00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:59.290]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:05.690]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity,
[00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:10.650]  the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy, you are crazy in my view if you don't
[00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.770]  get high-quality, storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.370]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.530]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't, and I'm
[00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:20.930]  preaching to the choir on that.
[00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.850]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water
[00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:25.850]  filtration.
[00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:30.450]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the high-quality
[00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.050]  water filtration department.

[00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:10.690]  that don't have fillers, that are filled with high-quality essential oils and more.
[00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.990]  We have the turmeric toothpaste.
[00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:17.770]  We have the ultimate tooth whitening with pro-calcium toothpaste, and we have the amazing
[00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:21.530]  activated charcoal toothpaste, again, with a whole bunch of key essential oils that are

[00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.130]  more.
[00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.130]  These are really game-changing toothpastes.
[00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.130]  They're very, very strong.
[00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:31.130]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.570]  Ours don't, and it doesn't have fillers in it.
[00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:40.250]  It is just chock-full of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.250]  It's now back in stock.
[00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.090]  It became a bestseller.

[00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:47.410]  We're selling out of the tooth whitening toothpaste.
[00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:51.730]  We've got some of that left, and we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste
[00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:53.650]  in stock, but it's running out as well.

[00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:11.470]  Maybe you're watching Infowars today, and you don't know what to do with the problems

[00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.090]  here, this is what we do.
[00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:49.410]  We specialize in training people and equipping them for transformation, and that's what you'll
[00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:50.410]  do.

[00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:03.490]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic
[00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:07.610]  book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future.
[00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:08.610]  That is the hellish future.
[00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:12.610]  Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:15.730]  you'll be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:20.250]  at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowars.com, but you will never be able to get another signed
[00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:25.090]  copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out, and there's about a thousand
[00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:26.650]  left of them right now.
[00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:32.050]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowars.com.
[00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:35.970]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:39.810]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:41.490]  you help keep Infowars on the air.
[00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:45.370]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned copies,
[00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:50.650]  but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowars.com and get a signed
[00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:54.810]  copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to
[00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:55.810]  the local school.
[00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:58.770]  This is an Infowar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:08.890]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:15.130]  The world is a vampire
[00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:19.130]  Sent to drain
[00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:23.130]  Secret destroyers
[00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:27.130]  Hold you up to the flames
[00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:31.130]  And what do I get
[00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:35.130]  For my pain?
[00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:39.130]  Betrayed desirers
[00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:44.130]  End up a piece of the game
[00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:48.130]  Even though I know
[00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:52.130]  I saw a bullet jump
[00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:56.130]  All my gold
[00:33:56.130 --> 00:34:01.130]  All my gold
[00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:05.130]  All my gold
[00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:09.130]  All my gold
[00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:12.130]  All my gold
[00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:17.130]  All my gold
[00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:22.130]  All my gold
[00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:27.130]  All my gold
[00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:31.850]  for every wolf there's a sheepdog and I'm designed to come after you
[00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:35.770]  politically culturally spiritually and I've already sunk my teeth deep into
[00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:39.690]  you so who is Captain Nemo and who is the
[00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.570]  whale doesn't really matter does it because
[00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:48.570]  God's watching all right yeah Nemo went looking for the
[00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:52.250]  whale but the whale found him
[00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:57.690]  Alex Jones begs for God to destroy the earth
[00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:02.890]  for the children that was the top of yahoo news this morning on MSM
[00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:06.330]  it's a raw story it's a news week it's everywhere
[00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:11.050]  and they did exactly what I wanted as usual
[00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:15.610]  because what I actually said was like the Jonathan Swift
[00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:19.690]  modest proposal almost 300 years ago massive potato
[00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:23.050]  famine in Ireland hundreds of thousands of Irish dying
[00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:29.050]  helped millions total over the decade and the British had in their news
[00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:32.010]  articles don't send them aid let them die they're Irish
[00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:36.010]  you know big feud going on there for a long time
[00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:38.570]  that's all the Brits and the Scots and the Irish give us running around killing
[00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:41.050]  each other uh but the Brits were the dominant group
[00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:43.610]  so they were kind of squatting on the Irish
[00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:46.410]  and so uh
[00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:51.370]  one of the uh few lords in England that was actually half Irish
[00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:56.010]  wrote under a pen name a modest proposal he said absolutely the Irish are such
[00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:57.770]  scum you can go right off yourself it's the
[00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:01.850]  it's the model of satire in history it's the most famous you know
[00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:05.530]  case of it when you take English class in high school or college
[00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:09.050]  and that's why when I said it a few years ago I said this is about a modest
[00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:12.010]  proposal and now I'm gonna say the rant and the media will misrepresent what I
[00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:14.010]  said and that's fine because out of this people will be
[00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.730]  educated and what did I do three years ago during the lockdowns
[00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:20.170]  I said the flocking down the third world will starve tens of millions to death and
[00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:23.290]  then the borders will collapse and the UN will bring them here and flood
[00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:27.210]  us with them and the crime rate will explode and the
[00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:31.850]  globalists have their way we'll end up living in cannibalism
[00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:36.410]  that's how far this goes within 10 days most people resort to murder
[00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:40.090]  and within 15 days almost everyone either commits suicide or becomes a
[00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:42.810]  cannibal and I said you know I love my children
[00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:47.290]  so much hypothetically if ever I got to that point
[00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:51.690]  I I will eat my liberal neighbors doesn't mean I'm gonna go over there
[00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:54.170]  right now I'm gonna break down a society I was just being honest with them I said
[00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:57.770]  I really don't want to eat you I've got storable food but I'll saw I
[00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:00.410]  hope they can you know things won't get that bad but
[00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:06.410]  and I was saying this is satire but really if I crashed in the Andes with
[00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:08.890]  my family on a plane and they survived there was
[00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:11.610]  and we were frozen for three months and nobody could get up there to get us
[00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:14.250]  till it unfroze and nobody could find the plane there's a
[00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:18.490]  bunch of dead bodies I mean I'm gonna go ahead and eat them
[00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:24.170]  I'm gonna eat you so it's satire but really good satire has a little
[00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:29.530]  vein a very sharp edge of reality let's be honest out there how much you
[00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:34.570]  love your wife and children let's just be be men about this stuff
[00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:37.370]  goes completely south I'm not committing suicide
[00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:40.810]  I will eat people okay let's just get that straight I will
[00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:45.050]  fry your ass up I'll cook you on a spit
[00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:48.410]  so make sure you identify yourself politically because it's not going after
[00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:53.050]  Christians or conservatives but if I need to eat you I am now that's
[00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:56.410]  after a total collapse into civilization well but of course I'm
[00:37:56.410 --> 00:38:00.170]  gonna go to Mark Zuckerberg's house I'm not gonna come eat you don't worry
[00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.570]  and we all know that's not what I mean I mean
[00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:05.770]  this metaphorically metaphysically it's satire
[00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:12.250]  but there's always that little kernel of truth isn't there
[00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:16.090]  because the globalists are eating us with crime and GMO
[00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:19.930]  and 5g and they want us to eat bugs and they want to cut our children's genitals
[00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.770]  off and they want to abort babies after
[00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:26.410]  they're born passing laws in California and New York to do it
[00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:29.210]  so you look at the horror of all the things they do so I've got the crew
[00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:31.850]  getting I'm not gonna play it this hour because we don't have it yet
[00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:35.050]  I forgot to tell the crew to do this they have short clips out of context
[00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.730]  all over the news of me saying go ahead and
[00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:42.250]  God blow the earth up and and what I said was
[00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.770]  God would do that before God allowed pure evil to take over and get rid of
[00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:48.810]  free will and put humans in factory farms and you
[00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:52.250]  know produce and clone us for body parts which is now actually happening
[00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:57.210]  but on a mass scale and I said would it be better for God to cauterize the earth
[00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:03.690]  this time by fire instead of by water
[00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:09.130]  so it's a thought process I mean if we are this horrible species and we're
[00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:16.090]  and we allow all this to go on then I simply ask the question
[00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:21.690]  should God tear us up throw us in the trash can and start over again
[00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:27.290]  so I'm and I said I'm making that point metaphorically
[00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:32.490]  but you see they can't help themselves but be deceivers
[00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:36.730]  but that's okay because now millions of new people are going to go I got to hear
[00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.410]  what this lunatic's saying and they're going to tune in and find
[00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:43.610]  somebody trying to save society trying to not starve people to death
[00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:47.690]  trying to not have this Viggo Mortensen's the road
[00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:50.250]  syndrome
[00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:55.130]  I've interviewed Viggo Mortensen he's a listener he's very concerned
[00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:58.490]  that society's going to collapse
[00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:03.290]  so here we are Alex Jones begs for God to destroy the earth
[00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:06.010]  for the children
[00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:12.330]  if you were in a fantasy alternate universe like Lord of the Rings and you
[00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:16.090]  were down in some keep and a hundred goblins had
[00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:18.570]  broken in and there was only five or six of you to
[00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:21.690]  defend at the door and you knew they were about to break down the door and then
[00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:24.650]  take your children into slavery and torture them to death for several
[00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:30.410]  months before they ate them alive would you just turn your children over
[00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:33.130]  to the goblins
[00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:38.410]  or would you give your children poison and I'm not saying do any of this I'm
[00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:41.290]  saying this is the type of society we're building
[00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:46.410]  and what we're entering into so so that was my point
[00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:52.410]  if I was Joseph Goebbels and I was in the Nazi
[00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:56.490]  bunker and the Russians were only a half mile away
[00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.770]  I would not give my five six children what was it cyanide
[00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:04.090]  and kill them but he was selfish and didn't want
[00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:07.370]  the Soviets to have his kids
[00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:10.650]  so he killed him
[00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:17.130]  Hitler killed his child the German shepherd blondie
[00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:23.850]  but what if it was flesh-eating pedophiles coming
[00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:29.930]  to the Reich Chancellery would you then poison your children
[00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:33.050]  I think the answer is clear
[00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:37.210]  so these are the type of thought exercises we need to have
[00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:41.450]  because where where Alexander Soros and the and Lord Rothschild and the new
[00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:46.410]  world order are taking us is such a horrible place beyond HP
[00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:52.810]  Lovecraft beyond Clive Barker beyond anything you can even imagine
[00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:59.690]  before you experience it the true level of scientifically deployed evil
[00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:05.210]  where tyranny and oppression is law where it is an art form of ugliness and
[00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:09.450]  betrayal and and and and shame and
[00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:13.210]  desperateness children in cages being torn into pieces
[00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:16.330]  begging for mommy forever that is the music
[00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:21.610]  in which the soul of our enemy swims people always say oh the government
[00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:27.610]  doesn't care about us oh it cares deeply about you it wants to kill you
[00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:31.130]  it cares deeply about getting rid of you because it's stolen the wealth
[00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:34.970]  and thinks that you're eating its goods it's like when you walk in
[00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:41.770]  and you left the pie out at 3 a.m and there's roaches in your your pie
[00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:44.330]  and you go you little bastards you ruined it
[00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:49.450]  you hate those roaches oh you don't not care about the roaches you hate them
[00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:53.370]  and these globalists see us as roaches well hey I've seen a lot of roaches and
[00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.730]  Soros you look like one
[00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:03.930]  with all the craziness in the world the collapsing borders the war with Russia
[00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:08.490]  the insanity the the currency devaluations the economy going crazy
[00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:12.090]  you are crazy in my view if you don't get high quality storable food and water

[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:17.840]  I'm sick and tired of giving in my own way. I'm sick and tired of everything I see, but
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:24.840]  I know. It's been a long 29 year adventure. And boy has god directed this operation. Suckers
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:31.840]  paid off the fight against evil like nothing else has in a long time. And I'm going to be
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:37.840]  faithful and I'm going to commit myself more than ever to the defeat of the new world order.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:44.840]  I commit myself into god's hands. I ask god to give me the strength of a white hot iron
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:54.840]  to not just smash the enemy but burn them to hell. I can feel the strength of humanity.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:48:01.840]  God's spirit shining through us like wind in the sails of a giant ship as we move forward
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:10.840]  against the enemy. And as they feel their bones being crushed beneath righteousness.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:16.840]  Nobody rides for free though. You can have anything you want you just can't have everything
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:23.840]  you want. And I've said my prayers. And I've lived to see my prayers delivered. That's
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:35.840]  a powerful god. Nobody rides for free Soros. Nobody. Not you. Not me. And god's going to
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:51.840]  break you. So keep playing god son. Keep whistling past that place.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:56.840]  Alright I've kind of been preaching this hour. I hit a lot of news but I didn't detail it.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:01.840]  When we start the next hour I'm going to systematically go over everything I just covered
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.840]  with precision. And the first thing is going to be the central bank digital currencies and
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:11.840]  how much trouble they're in. And then the giant United Nations announcement of a worldwide
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:16.840]  ministry of truth. It's already been set up. They're announcing it. The incredible announcement
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:22.840]  and the rejection by UK, Spain, Germany, Canada and others of the cluster bombs. And I see
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:26.840]  what's really going on there. And unfortunately I'm the only person that I've heard so far
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:31.840]  get this. Even top analysts on the Western and Russian side have not figured this out yet.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:38.840]  This is really bad. And I'll explain coming up. Not the cluster bombs. Those are seen
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.840]  as the worst thing. The media has made that the worst thing. Because they don't want other
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:45.840]  countries having them. All the big powerful countries use them. It's standard procedure.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:50.840]  Again it's like you can't go mine diamonds. It's a blood diamond. But one company can
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:55.840]  have them. Or you can't have rare minerals but the Chinese can. Or you can't have cluster
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:00.840]  bombs. Only Russia, China and the U.S. and the U.K. can have them. And France and Germany.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:06.840]  That's not why they're doing it. They're doing it because that's the nastiest thing so much.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:10.840]  Well we gave them cluster bombs. Now we're going to give them F-16s and long range missiles
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:15.840]  and see then it's off the races and that crosses Russia's red line. So that's why they're doing
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.840]  cluster bombs right now. It's psychologists and psychiatrists and psych warfare people
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:24.840]  that run all this. And they obsess too much on the PSYOP end and not enough on the threat
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.840]  escalation ladder and what that means. And so it's very obvious when they're pre-programming
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:34.840]  something that they're doing it because they're missing military and historical tactics. And
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:38.840]  they're not as smart as they think they are. So that's why they listen to the show. And
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:42.840]  a lot of times smarter people in the government make the point. And of course they won't listen
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:46.840]  now. They'll announce the F-16s in a couple of weeks and the rest of it. And the people
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:50.840]  say well how the hell does Jones know that? Because I can see these people. I know how
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:57.840]  they operate. So they just got through telling us cluster bombs are the most evil thing
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.840]  on earth. And now they're the best things to slice bread. That's being done because
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:08.840]  they're about to normalize stuff that actually will defeat the Russians or keep the war going.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:14.840]  The Russians have won. Their military action worked at high cost. And the main offensive
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:20.840]  got crushed. And it's now admitted by all the major analysts. And so now unless NATO
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:23.840]  fully gets engaged and there's a false flag of the nuclear power plant that could happen
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:27.840]  any minute. Zelensky said the Russians will blow it up by Monday. I mean here we are. It
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:32.840]  hadn't happened yet. Thank God. So I don't know. I just know we're in uncharted crazy
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:37.840]  town right now. And if you want to get into the people the calculus because I've had the
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.840]  FBI call up and I'm not trying to brag. I'm saying it because they know this. And they've
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:47.840]  called me saying hey how did you predict the Vegas shooting. We want to know. And obviously
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.840]  all my stuff tapped already listen or you read all that. How did you know that. I just
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:55.840]  said it just came to me. That night I said I think they'll attack a large music event
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:52:00.840]  in the next few days. I mean it just it just comes to me. But it's not what you call it
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:04.840]  psychic. It's like all these data points. Let me give you one of the data points. Cluster
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:08.840]  bombs have been being used for nine years in the war in Ukraine. The war didn't start
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:12.840]  two February's ago a year and a half ago. All that's baloney. Both sides when you and
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.840]  cluster bombs on record you pull up the news articles. It's kind of like people said are
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:23.840]  there bio labs in Ukraine. Obama celebrated them and went there and signed the grand opening
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:28.840]  of bio weapon labs two years into office. And then so of course it was true in the Russian
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:33.840]  Senate. Not because I believe the Russians. I went and looked it up. So that's what I'm
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:37.840]  getting at. If they've been using you go pull up the newscast from six seven years ago about
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:43.840]  well the Azov battalions are using cluster bombs against the Russian you know groups
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:48.840]  in the east. And is that right. Tonight on the front line and you know tonight on democracy
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:54.840]  now. I mean it's all there. So again there's hundreds of points hundreds of data points
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:53:06.840]  that go into that computation of what I just said. But it just gets more and more insane.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:12.840]  Now there it is. Deleted Web pages show Obama led effort to build Ukraine based bio lab
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:22.840]  handling especially dangerous pathogens. And what do they delete the Washington Post.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:27.840]  Let's just move on. Let's just move on. So I'm going to hit all of that next hour.
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:31.840]  So what I say is I'm going to hit this I start covering it. So I'm going to hit the central
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:35.840]  bank digital currencies. I'm going to hit the U.N. censorship. I'm going to hit the
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:41.840]  war news kind already did that. I'm going to hit a bunch of other important news here
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:48.840]  that is massively critical coming up next hour. And we're going to open the phones up as
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:52.840]  well and then also play the full clip of what I had to say about God should just destroy
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:56.840]  the planet. I said you have to hypothetically ask why hasn't God already done it. I mean
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.840]  they must have been really bad back there in Noah's time that God destroyed the earth
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:04.840]  then. Whether you believe in that or not the point is it's an interesting mind process
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:11.840]  of war game. Like if you're God that made us are you happy at how we're behaving right
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:17.840]  now. And like is there a point where we just say you know what the global cells were bad
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.840]  evil species a parasite everything. We should all die. That's because they want us to roll
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:26.840]  over and die ourselves and give them control the planet and not have our own self-interest
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:32.840]  and our own life force and our own survival instinct. I love it though Alex Jones calls
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:37.840]  for God to blow up the planet. I was 100 percent clear what I meant by everything and they did
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:42.840]  that. I love it actually because they think people are going to go like oh this guy is
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:48.840]  really bad news. They all know you're a bunch of liars. That's anybody that can actually
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:56.840]  think. No I don't want God to blow up the planet. I ask the question if if if Satan
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:00.840]  was going to have an eternity of rule and torture or keep our children alive and torture
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:04.840]  them in torture chambers forever would you ask God to just erase everything and of course
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:09.840]  you would. That's what I said. All right I'm going to stop now. If we don't plug we won't
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:13.840]  be here and if that's what you want we won't be here. But but but listen we got stuff you
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:20.840]  really need. I mean these are incredible products at InfoWarsStore.com and they're
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.840]  things that you really need. Everybody in this crazy environment needs high quality

[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.840]  was off the last two years we put in generators when they turn the power off every winter
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:46.840]  now here in Austin under the direction of the White House on record. They won't let
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:51.840]  Texas turn up its power output. We just get it out cook the food in here on generators
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:55.840]  generator power is delicious. That's 10 percent off. Now folks there's not a lot of margin

[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.840]  You can taste it.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.840]  You can see it.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.840]  You can face it.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.840]  You can hear it.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:34.840]  A video of an emotional woman on a plane saying that the man next to her was not real goes
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:41.840]  viral. That back there is not real. This is followed by multiple videos of people claiming
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:47.840]  to have witnessed the man's eyes wink from side to side when he winked at me. It was
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:53.840]  his left eye looking back at me. It didn't wink like this. It winked like this. It didn't
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:58.840]  like like this. It was almost like his pupils winked. It was like from like this way. A
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:05.840]  video from 2022 falsely claims that it captured the event. And while it all goes viral, many
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:12.840]  of us can smell the nonsense. A Freemason with 300,000 followers on TikTok releases
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:16.840]  a video claiming to be the actual man from the plane. So we're attempting to fly out
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:21.840]  of Dallas, Fort Worth. And then basically this woman, she sits next to me and she's clearly
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:25.840]  been drinking. I'm minding my own business. And sure enough, she sees my hoodie that has
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.840]  this Freemason logo on it. And on top of that, she's noticed my ring. So she started to ask
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.840]  questions. Nothing dramatic. Just ask me, do I know what these symbols mean? Why am I
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.840]  wearing it? What's the purpose? Yada, yada, yada. And long story short, I basically just
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:42.840]  say, hey, I'm a Freemason. Next thing I know, she basically starts to grill me about low
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.840]  level Freemason and that it's all Satanism and that it's ruled by reptilians and blah,
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.840]  blah, blah. So I simply put my hood up and I started to ignore her and basically just
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:55.840]  mind my own business. So moral of the story, don't believe everything you hear on the Internet.
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:00.840]  You cannot believe anything you hear on the Internet or anywhere else for that matter.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:06.840]  And there are two main reasons why this all went viral. First off, the story of reptilian
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:12.840]  humanoids living among us goes all the way back to the beginning of recorded history.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:17.840]  The oldest official writings on Earth are the Sumerian texts. They describe a reptilian
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:24.840]  race that genetically modified human beings with their own reptilian DNA. All three of
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:30.840]  the Abrahamic religions describe a reptilian race of humanoids that live among us.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:36.840]  The story of the Garden of Eden in the Torah, wherein Adam and Eve were created in the image
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:42.840]  of the Elohim, reptilian beings known as the Nahash began breeding with Eve so that they
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:48.840]  could be more like the Elohim. According to the Torah, these Nahash were obsessed with
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.840]  genetic modification and still live among us today, where they feed off a substance
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:03:00.840]  called a far, which is the same substance that human beings are made of. In the Christian
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:06.840]  Bible, this creature is described as a serpent in a tree. In the Nag Hammadi, early Christian
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:12.840]  Gnostics wrote of a race of creatures known as the Archons, described as a reptilian
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:20.840]  humanoid. These Archons fed off of humans, including negative emotions, such as fear
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:26.840]  and anger. The Koran also has writings that describe reptilian creatures who live among
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:34.840]  us, known as the Djinn. The Australian Aboriginal people have traditions and paintings that date
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:40.840]  back thousands of years, depicting a rainbow serpent creator god. And about 10,000 miles
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:48.840]  away, the Aztec Mayan serpent gods Kolkucan and Quetzalcoatl are also described as rainbow
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:54.840]  serpents and were believed to have created human beings using their own DNA. This is
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:04:01.840]  found everywhere. The Druids of England called it Hakpen. The Romans called it Glykon. In
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:09.840]  Africa, it was Nyami Nyami. In Egypt, it was Apapis. Many royal bloodlines have claimed
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:16.840]  to be descendants of these serpent gods, such as Alexander the Great of Macedon, Emperor
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:24.840]  Jimmu of Japan, and the Dragon Dynasty of Media, now known as Iran. The Nagas serpent
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.840]  beings of India are believed to still live among us. All right, this is a longer report
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.840]  for Gregory. So there's a minute and a half or so left. It's very powerful. It's on
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:37.840]  Bandai video, a brief history of shapeshifting reptilians. You should look into it. This
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.840]  just gives you the historical perspective so you can make your own decisions about
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:44.840]  it. It's extremely biblical. The devil's not just some little thing floating around
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:49.840]  in outer space. It's marooned here on the earth and it feeds on us, both our energy
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.840]  and our blood, if you believe the Bible. We'll be right back with huge news. We're
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.840]  going to cover it all. Get ready. Start your engines.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:04.840]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:10.840]  or the GMO crops. They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:16.840]  companies and industry to use. One of the top pesticides used is atrazine. The allowable
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:20.840]  level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:26.840]  you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant. Look it up. Don't let them do this
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:31.840]  to your family. We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there, highest rated at

[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:13.840]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:17.840]  I don't know what happened the last four or five days, but they liken it when you pass
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:23.840]  another level in a video game and go up. It's like I went up 10 levels. Something shifted.
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:29.840]  I can feel it. Humanity is rising.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:35.840]  Can you keep them in the dark for a while?
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:39.840]  Can you hide them from the land world?
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.840]  Father!
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.840]  Father!
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:51.840]  Gonna take you down tonight.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.840]  Gonna show her my world.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.840]  Yeah, if the New World Order wants to bang heads with me, they can.
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:03.840]  Yeah! Ready to defeat the globalists. Ready!
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:07.840]  Woo!
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.840]  I'm gonna take a break. I'm energized so much. Wow!
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:15.840]  Higher than a kite, folks. Roger Stone called me up last night. He's been at the UFC with
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.840]  Trump and all the rest of it. He's playing God's Dutchman on today.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.840]  And he goes, man, people are saying you're going crazy on air. What do you want?
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.840]  I'm on life, baby. I've had two cups of coffee today.
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:31.840]  So in wake of America, the new stuff we got coming is incredible. I got some right here.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:35.840]  But yeah, I'm on caffeine. But man, no, I am just fired up.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:39.840]  I mean, God is so real. We've come through this so much together.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.840]  Humanity's waking up so fast. Last night, I had this whole show prepared.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.840]  And I was just so positive and so energized
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:51.840]  and so optimistic. I mean, not even optimistic.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:55.840]  I know God wins. I know God's real. And that's a powerful thing.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.840]  We are eternal spirits. All the science has now proven it. There's no atheists
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:03.840]  at the top of the globalist system. The mathematics shows the higher dimensions.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:07.840]  Everything the ancients said, it's all true. It's going on. We're in this incredible world with incredible things
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:11.840]  around us. It's amazing. And there's a lot of bad stuff, too. That's what freedom's like.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.840]  A lot of good, a lot of bad. But man, we got free will. And God's real.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:19.840]  The devil's real. I'm real. You're real. Baby, we're real. This is fantastic.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:23.840]  And it's painful. And it's got its problems. But man,
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.840]  that's what I think freedom looks like, baby.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:31.840]  And so I am just excited because this is a real roller coaster.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.840]  And it's got real knives and real spears
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:39.840]  and real darts and real swords here on Pilgrim's Progress.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:43.840]  But let me tell you, it's exciting.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:47.840]  So you get excited playing paintball. I get it. It's fun. I played it decades ago.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:51.840]  Or you get excited out hunting. Or you get excited climbing a mountain.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:55.840]  You can get all the ladies. Great. That's wonderful for you.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.840]  Or you get excited doing this or that. Or watching your favorite TV show.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.840]  Man, I get excited changing the world, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.840]  and seeing it actually happen in real time.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:11.840]  It is amazing to know that we can contend with evil
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.840]  and we can defeat it with God's spirit.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:19.840]  And God's not this little wimpy chicken neck thing
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:23.840]  that the left and the media push and all this.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:27.840]  I mean, I can feel God's spirit.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:31.840]  And for people that are children in Christ, children in the Holy Spirit,
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.840]  babies, it's a comforter and it loves them and it's there.
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:39.840]  But I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen, the devil tries to counterfeit God.
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.840]  And so the Luciferian energy is one of
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:47.840]  you're powerful, you're amazing, you're beautiful, you're meant to rule.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.840]  And it's a prideful deception. And it's very bad.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.840]  And that's how I've been tempted.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.840]  I've talked to some of the top researchers, people, they already can tell that.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.840]  But other people get tempted by other things. That's what I got tempted with was the up on the mountain thing.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.840]  And a lot of folks get tempted with up on the mountain deal, but I got the up on the mountain thing.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:11.840]  But you have to understand, under God, as long as you have
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.840]  filled you to God and the master plan and love life and just worship God and worship
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:19.840]  God through seeing God's creation. That's why you appreciate a sunset.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.840]  Owen did a great job last night, man. I listened to him.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.840]  I left here, did the headlines for my show, sat there in the parking lot,
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.840]  and my wife comes out at like 7 and she goes, we're supposed to go see The Sound of Freedom right now.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.840]  It's like in 15 minutes. Why aren't you in the house? I said, Owen's too on fire.
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.840]  I said, I'm sorry. I went in the house, brushed my teeth, got back in the car with her,
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.840]  and went to it. Then it was too depressing, too upsetting. She couldn't watch it. I haven't seen the whole thing yet.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:47.840]  I'm going to go by myself today. In fact, I'll tell you in the break,
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:51.840]  somebody booked me like a 3 or 4 o'clock here locally. I got to go see it.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.840]  I guess since I've said that, I got to take security now so I don't figure out where I'm at.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:03.840]  What was I getting at there?
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.840]  Owen was making the point about all of us see the sunset
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.840]  or beautiful snow-covered mountains or shooting stars or little fish
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.840]  in a pool or beautiful jungle plants or a cute little baby
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.840]  in its mother's arms. You recognize goodness.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.840]  You recognize wholesomeness. You recognize things God
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:27.840]  made that we communally share in God's creation and we
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.840]  worship our Heavenly Father who's given us
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.840]  the system of Genesis that is our mother, but it is God, the Godhead,
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:39.840]  the male energy of will and building and striving.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:43.840]  I'm not saying God has a feminine aspect.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:47.840]  I'm saying God says we are the bride. God is the groom.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.840]  The earth is a mother God created to give us
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.840]  life, but God created it, all of it.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:59.840]  It's perfect union, perfect control, absolutely
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.840]  perfection, and you must recognize that and then
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:07.840]  you get something way more powerful than Luciferian energy.
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.840]  I mean, I look at Alexander Soros and I see it. The guy's plugged in
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.840]  to not, I wouldn't say Luciferian
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.840]  energy, but one of the higher level demons. I don't like to study their
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:23.840]  demoniac names and all that gives them power, but I can see the cut of the
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.840]  operation. It's the same. It's like a pride and a surge and a
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.840]  dominance. We're going to do this. Instead of just the surge of going on the rapids of God's consciousness
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.840]  and it's like going a trillion miles an hour down rapids and it's
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.840]  beautiful and it never stops and it never ends and it's just gorgeous.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.840]  But again, there's that selfishness to say, I'm in charge of this. I'm
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.840]  better than this. I'm bigger than this. I'm not going to admit there's something more
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:51.840]  advanced than me. I mean, hello, have you looked around a little bit?
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.840]  This didn't just fall out of some monkey's butt.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:59.840]  This wasn't some gay monkey fish frog.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.840]  All right.
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:07.840]  I'm going to stop right now. I'm just high on creation, man.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:11.840]  We'll go to break. I said I'd cover the news, but I'm just too high.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.840]  I remember one time our head security guy, about five years ago, he'd already been
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.840]  here like three years. He comes in. He says, listen, the crew's really concerned that you're
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.840]  taking something back in your office during the breaks and we're just
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:27.840]  really concerned because, I mean, you were like depressed and everything and then you walk back there and you come
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:31.840]  back and they're all energized. And I said to him, yeah, that's
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.840]  because they handed me a stack of news articles and something I saw energized me.
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:39.840]  This is excitement, folks. It's like you're sitting there eating pizza
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:43.840]  and the football game's boring and then you see
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.840]  those plays where a running back, you've seen those where they jump all the way over the people
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:51.840]  and you know they just broke some record, but they can't measure it properly so you're not sure.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:55.840]  You just saw a record broke. You're like, what? Did you just see that?
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.840]  I said, you know, it's funny you say that.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.840]  My ex-wife just said that in the court and I just took
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:07.840]  a drug test this morning at a major facility
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.840]  with a guy watching me piss in a cup and when the drug test came in the next day
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.840]  I came in and I handed it to him and I said, no drugs, buddy, not even alcohol.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:19.840]  Zero, zero, zero. High on life. In fact,
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.840]  that's why I have a drinking problem sometimes because, ladies and gentlemen, I can't handle
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:27.840]  the unbridled Alex Jones. The Alex Jones that hadn't had a couple of
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:31.840]  tequilas, the Alex Jones that hadn't had a half bottle of wine
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.840]  might just beat the hell out of you if you cross him wrong.
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:39.840]  The Alex Jones that's alive, that's got so much juice, just like you've got that juice,
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:43.840]  has to suppress himself. I'm a guy that takes depressants,
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:47.840]  not pills, alcohol, because I can't handle the truth and I know
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:51.840]  that's the issue. I can't handle how alive I am right now
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.840]  in the fight against these tyrants and how hard I'm going to
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.840]  push to go after them because I'm so full of life and so full of resistance
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.840]  to these murdering pedophiles that want to get in the way of God's plan.
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.840]  And let me tell you, I've been taken up to the third heaven. I've been jacked in
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:11.840]  to the big plan. I've seen it. I've seen it and I can't even compute
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.840]  all of it. It's so fantastical. You've seen nothing. You ain't heard nothing.
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.840]  You ain't smelled nothing like this. I don't have words to tell you.
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:23.840]  But I tell you, anybody tries to get in the way of the incredible
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:27.840]  plan the big guy's got for us has got me pitched and I'm just
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:31.840]  begging to stay on the team, man. Just put me in the game, coach. Whatever you say, coach.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:35.840]  I know I'm weak. I know I'm pathetic. Man, you're amazing. I'm so lucky you made me.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:39.840]  What do I do, boss? What do I do? I'm like a hunting dog, man.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:43.840]  Just take me out of the house. Just turn me on them. Tell me what I got to do. Tell me
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.840]  how I serve you. Tell me what I can do for you right now.
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:51.840]  Woo! Thank God I'm not like Brian Stelter,
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:55.840]  God. Thank you for not making me like him. Why did you make something that horrible?
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:21.840]  You haven't. And I'm preaching the choir on that. But a lot of people got plenty
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:25.840]  of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration. This is

[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:13.840]  And now two books with Alex Jones. That's because I use
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:17.840]  brain force every day. What I always need is I always need
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:21.840]  some sort of boost in the morning. And so I try to exercise, eat
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.840]  well, take good vitamins. But the one thing that I have really found
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:29.840]  that makes a difference is brain force. I'll take brain
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:33.840]  force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.840]  for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff. So it really
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.840]  is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:45.840]  with my writing. Alright, we love you. We'll be right back. Get your Brain Force Plus, Brain Force
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:49.840]  Ultra and Turbo Force at infowarsstore.com. We'll be right back
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:53.840]  with our number two.
[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:26.580]  If you leave me, I won't miss you.
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:30.820]  If you leave me, I won't miss you.
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:32.500]  I won't ever take you back.
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.460]  I won't ever take you back.
[01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:50.740]  Girl, your memory will never haunt me, because I don't love you, and now if you'll buy that.
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:54.660]  I got some oceanfront property, and I got some oceanfront property.
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:58.420]  I want you to know that I'm the opposite of Alexander Soros, who hates you and wants to
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:20:59.420]  hurt you.
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:02.420]  I love you.
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:04.500]  I love God.
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:13.580]  I love our people, and I pledge to you, we will crush the enemy with God's divine intervention.
[01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:18.540]  God wants to see us have courage first, and then God will complete it.
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.580]  You got to do it, my friends.
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:28.140]  All right, I'm wound up today, but now I got to put my thinking cap on, because people
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:29.140]  need to hear the news.
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.140]  I need to cover the information.
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:34.340]  I've just done an hour and 20 minutes of classic Alex Jones.
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:36.180]  People are like, what's going on?
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:37.180]  This is like Alex Jones 10 years ago.
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:38.180]  What's going on?
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.620]  It's the spirit, folks.
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:40.820]  And I was thinking about it during the break.
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:43.059]  I said, what's going on the last couple of weeks?
[01:21:43.059 --> 01:21:47.460]  It was Pastor Rodney Howard Brown's church, man, going back to a faith revival, the Holy
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:48.460]  Ghost.
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:49.740]  This has always been with me.
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:54.059]  And Brown said, you watch, the spirit will be stronger now.
[01:21:54.059 --> 01:21:55.460]  He was absolutely right.
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:59.380]  So it was getting with those people for a week.
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:07.059]  And the force is strong with those guys, and very strong.
[01:22:07.059 --> 01:22:12.140]  Created tremor in the force the last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:15.019]  So it's all energy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:15.019 --> 01:22:16.460]  It's the energy you choose.
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:18.420]  You better choose it quickly.
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:26.780]  Oh, man, and how he, the crazy inside baseball in Florida with the preachers.
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:29.019]  I didn't realize how big a Christian Trump is.
[01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:30.660]  I knew he was a Christian.
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:31.660]  I know he believes in God.
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:37.460]  But he is secretly, it's not even a secret, but I was led in on it when I was in Florida
[01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:42.580]  and we went to the Trump facility and met with Patrick Bedd David and others.
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:48.580]  But that's a whole nother, you know, that's my biggest frustration, man, is that's such
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:52.059]  a bombshell right there.
[01:22:52.059 --> 01:22:53.700]  And the people didn't tell me it was incompetence.
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:57.540]  These are like big national preachers.
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:03.540]  And run his faith group and all that, that like, I was like, wait a minute, Trump calls
[01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:08.059]  you up every day and you pray for 20 minutes or wait, you go around with Trump and he prays
[01:23:08.059 --> 01:23:11.019]  sometimes for 30, 40 minutes a day with you.
[01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:14.180]  It's like, and I looked it up, it was actually, it's actually been reported, but like back
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.420]  of the paper.
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.059]  So that's why they're so scared of Trump.
[01:23:17.059 --> 01:23:22.500]  I was worried that he actually wasn't a Christian or didn't take it seriously.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:28.500]  And no, and that's why they're really flipped out because Trump was already a Christian
[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:35.260]  10 years ago, 20 years ago, but you know, he wasn't, I mean, now he's all in because Trump
[01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.059]  feels energy.
[01:23:37.059 --> 01:23:39.780]  And that's my conversations with Trump have been, man, did you feel the energy in that
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:47.019]  arena when I, uh, last night when I, uh, took the nominations and I said, yeah, it was better
[01:23:47.019 --> 01:23:48.019]  than a rock concert.
[01:23:48.019 --> 01:23:49.019]  He goes, you're right.
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:51.180]  He goes, but you know, I really feel the energy, Alex.
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:56.260]  And I said, when he said, when I've got all those preachers coming and praying with me,
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:57.260]  that's energy.
[01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:58.260]  It's incredible.
[01:23:58.260 --> 01:23:59.260]  Alex.
[01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:02.059]  He's like, I feel that energy when I talk to you.
[01:24:02.059 --> 01:24:03.900]  And of course all the phones are tapped.
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:07.059]  There's the CIA crapping lead bricks, man.
[01:24:07.059 --> 01:24:08.059]  Oh no.
[01:24:08.059 --> 01:24:09.059]  Oh no.
[01:24:09.059 --> 01:24:10.059]  Oh no.
[01:24:10.059 --> 01:24:12.500]  You got Satan, baby.
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:16.700]  We got God.
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:24.380]  And there's Trump right there, addicted, addicted to Holy spirit, an addict, addicted, addicted,
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:25.380]  addicted.
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:30.540]  You know, he'll have events and he'll see some black preachers, secret service can confirm
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:34.139]  this, but I've confirmed and Trump will call like five, six black preachers.
[01:24:34.139 --> 01:24:35.940]  He thinks they got like the best Holy spirit energy.
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:36.940]  He'll say, Hey, bring them back.
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:37.940]  One of them.
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:39.340]  Let's just say a little prayer right here together.
[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.340]  Right now.
[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:42.460]  I was like, he'll actually say, give me some of that right now.
[01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:43.460]  He says, give it to me.
[01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:44.460]  Give it.
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:45.460]  I want some of that.
[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:51.500]  How, how can you contend when we've got a God that created the universe and will literally
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.540]  make you higher than a kite?
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:54.620]  Just like that.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:55.620]  Totally complete.
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:59.700]  Like, I mean, I am as fricking high as a kite right now and I'm not a big drug guy, but
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:00.980]  I've taken ecstasy.
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:02.420]  I took acid a few times.
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:03.420]  I've taken mushrooms.
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:06.580]  It's, it's, it, it sucks if the kids don't take it.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:07.580]  It's horrible.
[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:08.580]  Half the time it's got fentanyl in it.
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:09.580]  Now it'll kill you.
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:12.700]  That stuff is like, like it's a negative.
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:16.580]  So you got a zero and drugs are negative.
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:17.580]  Good.
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:18.580]  Holy spirit's infinity.
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:19.580]  Good.
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:20.580]  On the top.
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:21.580]  Here's him.
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:22.580]  I'm saying the drug of the Holy spirit.
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:27.220]  In fact, it's so good right now that I don't even know if I can cover any news because
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:28.220]  it's negative.
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:29.220]  This is the ending.
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:30.220]  All those.
[01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:31.220]  Anyways.
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:32.220]  I mean, you see what I'm saying?
[01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:36.660]  And that's just where I am right now.
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:38.660]  Let me do this.
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:46.980]  We get out of the way and let me just try to get back in the world.
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:47.980]  Second, five, these people.
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:48.980]  Sorry.
[01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:49.980]  I'm just jacked in next level.
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:54.420]  I know a lot of you are too, and it's just, it's really hard to even be down here, but
[01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:55.420]  we got to do this.
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:58.780]  We got some important work and I just can't believe how pathetic the globalist are.
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.019]  I don't even say that in a mean way.
[01:26:00.019 --> 01:26:01.019]  Like they're just ridiculous.
[01:26:01.019 --> 01:26:02.180]  I mean, wow.
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:04.380]  You guys don't know about this.
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:05.380]  Just stop being a jerk.
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:06.380]  Stop being a Satanist.
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:07.380]  Stop loving God.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:10.980]  There is a Paul White and, and, and, and it will all be over.
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.580]  We don't have to do this anymore.
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:17.900]  You don't have to devil worship or eat poop or hurt because the devil wants you to debase
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:18.900]  yourself.
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:24.780]  You don't have to kidnap a kid and slit their throat anymore to feel powerful.
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:27.780]  I mean, I would imagine you feel a powerful hate of God when you do that.
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:30.860]  Like you're, you're definitely when you kill some little kid or something for no reason.
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:35.059]  I mean, yeah, you're feeling some energy, man, because you'll ask him what the hell.
[01:26:35.059 --> 01:26:36.059]  I mean, wow.
[01:26:36.059 --> 01:26:40.220]  That must really feel crazy because I never felt it, but I can imagine you guys are addicted
[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:41.220]  to doing bad stuff.
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:45.900]  I'm addicted to running you over and it feels so good.
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:46.900]  I've got it.
[01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:51.300]  God, can I actually just ask God right now to stop this right now?
[01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:52.860]  I mean, I'm in ecstasy right now.
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:57.900]  I am in literal Holy ghost ecstasy, drunk in the spirit right now.
[01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:03.700]  And I'm like, I can't even do the show.
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:04.700]  Wow.
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:06.340]  Wow.
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:07.340]  Okay.
[01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:09.900]  I'm going to pass out here in a minute.
[01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:16.540]  This is so intense.
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:19.100]  Maybe, maybe they're going to kill me in a couple of days or something.
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.100]  I don't know.
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:22.019]  This is like, maybe God's just getting so close to me.
[01:27:22.019 --> 01:27:23.019]  Something bad's about to happen.
[01:27:23.019 --> 01:27:24.019]  I don't even care anymore.
[01:27:24.019 --> 01:27:25.940]  But I'm like, maybe there's about to be a nuclear war, folks.
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.460]  I feel so close to God right now.
[01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:28.460]  I'm actually worried.
[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:30.700]  You, I think you can all feel it too.
[01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:34.660]  Like this is really bad folks, but God's real and it's okay.
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:40.059]  Cause it's kind of scary when you feel like that feeling of completion, and I've only
[01:27:40.059 --> 01:27:41.900]  felt what I've been dreaming before.
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:45.460]  And the last few weeks I've been building towards this now where I realized I'm in that
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:46.460]  place right now.
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:49.860]  And I was talking to Pastor Brown about three weeks ago before he invited me there, demanded
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:53.740]  I come there and flew me there.
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:57.980]  I said, you know, I felt that commission two years into my broadcast, literally like there
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:00.740]  were angels in the room and they were telling me what was going to happen and what was going
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:01.740]  to unfold.
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.500]  And I thought, am I going crazy?
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.940]  It was delusions of grandeur, but it was all laid out and it was, it was a spirit and it
[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:08.139]  was God.
[01:28:08.139 --> 01:28:10.460]  And he said, he said, yeah, I'm feeling that right now.
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:16.620]  And he said, when we got off there, he goes, and you're going to feel it too.
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:21.460]  It's like when Yoda goes, Luke Skywalker goes, I'm not afraid.
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:26.059]  He goes, you will be, you will be, but it's the other way around.
[01:28:26.059 --> 01:28:27.780]  Like you will be empowered.
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:28.900]  You will be energized.
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.260]  You will be next level.
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:32.059]  You will take it all the way.
[01:28:32.059 --> 01:28:33.900]  This is going to happen.
[01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:34.980]  And it's not a mind trick.
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:35.980]  It's real.
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:39.700]  There's all those people praying and all those people focusing on all those people loving
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:40.700]  God.
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:44.700]  And we are so much more powerful than the devil and his minions.
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:58.700]  I'm shifting gears when we come back, I'm doing it, I'm going to cover the news.
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.500]  The globalists are only humans.
[01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:02.460]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:04.900]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:08.139]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[01:29:08.139 --> 01:29:12.260]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:16.340]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:19.940]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:22.139]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[01:29:22.139 --> 01:29:24.820]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:29.100]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:31.420]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:35.380]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time, 10% off on
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:36.380]  top of that.
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:42.620]  Exclusively at InfowarStore.com on the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System in stock and replacement

[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:48.300]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:52.100]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from
[01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:54.700]  hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:58.660]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:03.340]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:05.059]  or the GMO crops.
[01:30:05.059 --> 01:30:09.900]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:11.460]  industry to use.
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:14.780]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:18.460]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:24.019]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[01:30:24.019 --> 01:30:25.180]  Look it up.
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:26.420]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:29.660]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:34.220]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors, the Alexa Pure ready to ship
[01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:35.220]  to you right now.
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:37.420]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:39.300]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.300]  It is amazing.
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:41.940]  It's great for your home, your business.
[01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:45.139]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[01:30:45.139 --> 01:30:46.620]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:50.660]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.

[01:30:57.019 --> 01:30:58.980]  You need this filter.
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:04.380]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:05.740]  supply.
[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:10.380]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:14.580]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:17.400]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:20.740]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:25.940]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:28.700]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:35.340]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:39.620]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface.
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:45.420]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:51.580]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated tri-iodine form.

[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:03.019]  They decided to not herp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot because
[01:32:03.019 --> 01:32:04.460]  they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:06.820]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:08.300]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:10.740]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:32:11.019 --> 01:32:15.860]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:18.300]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:20.860]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:27.059]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot jail background.
[01:32:27.059 --> 01:32:28.059]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:32:28.059 --> 01:32:32.220]  It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:33.540]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:34.860]  No, I'm not running for president.
[01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:37.340]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:38.340]  Red, white, and blue.

[02:20:06.490 --> 02:20:10.490]  1-2-1
[02:20:36.490 --> 02:20:54.890]  Hold on, we're not seeing activities of a powerful group that's in control or in charge.
[02:20:54.890 --> 02:20:59.330]  We're seeing desperation trying to keep us under their control.
[02:20:59.330 --> 02:21:02.130]  They've already failed.
[02:21:02.130 --> 02:21:06.250]  You know what I say though, you know it's true.
[02:21:06.250 --> 02:21:09.449]  Will they take us down with them though?
[02:21:09.449 --> 02:21:11.650]  They've already failed.
[02:21:11.650 --> 02:21:12.650]  They're already fallen.
[02:21:12.650 --> 02:21:13.650]  They're already defeated.
[02:21:13.650 --> 02:21:18.289]  They're already the losers.
[02:21:18.289 --> 02:21:23.930]  But will they drag us down with them?
[02:21:23.930 --> 02:21:30.690]  That's the question.
[02:21:30.690 --> 02:21:34.090]  Let's move on to the next big story.
[02:21:34.090 --> 02:21:36.730]  You know, this is a plug because I should plug.
[02:21:36.730 --> 02:21:37.730]  It funds the Operation Plus.
[02:21:37.730 --> 02:21:39.090]  It helps you.
[02:21:39.090 --> 02:21:40.090]  But it's not a plug.
[02:21:40.090 --> 02:21:41.690]  It's a new story.
[02:21:41.690 --> 02:21:44.170]  Look at this right here because I've got to hit this.
[02:21:44.170 --> 02:21:50.090]  I've had this on my stack for like a week and the stack has gotten thicker and thicker
[02:21:50.090 --> 02:21:51.090]  because I haven't covered this.
[02:21:51.090 --> 02:21:53.850]  This is like 15 articles at least.
[02:21:53.850 --> 02:21:56.449]  You want to be neurotic and actually count them, I bet it's 15 articles.
[02:21:56.449 --> 02:21:57.449]  I haven't counted.
[02:21:57.449 --> 02:22:03.610]  One, two, three, four, five, I have these all marked up.
[02:22:04.130 --> 02:22:20.130]  Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, oh I'm sorry it's more, 16, 17, 18, 19.
[02:22:20.130 --> 02:22:24.449]  Sorry it's 19 articles.
[02:22:24.449 --> 02:22:28.930]  That the U.S. water supply is the most corrupt in the world because our government allows
[02:22:28.930 --> 02:22:37.690]  companies to use atrazine and thousands of other chemicals where they have better, cleaner
[02:22:37.690 --> 02:22:43.850]  chemicals to use but they don't because it's a plan to kill us.
[02:22:43.850 --> 02:22:47.930]  Americans won World War II but Americans had an opportunity.
[02:22:47.930 --> 02:22:51.330]  Americans wanted you to have a nice car and a swimming pool and freedom.
[02:22:51.330 --> 02:22:57.250]  The globalists don't want that model like when Obama went to Africa and Latin America.
[02:22:57.250 --> 02:23:00.730]  We can pull the club stuff up, I've played them like 100 times, at least 100 times and
[02:23:00.730 --> 02:23:04.850]  he says you can't have cars or air conditioning in Africa, you'll burn the earth up.
[02:23:04.850 --> 02:23:11.210]  Now I get a jumbo jet, you just get nothing and it's all a lie.
[02:23:11.210 --> 02:23:14.930]  So yeah, we're selling the Alexa Pure water filtration system, highest rated, highest
[02:23:14.930 --> 02:23:18.890]  quality, lowest price you're going to find, 10% off right now, it's very rare, amazing
[02:23:18.890 --> 02:23:20.850]  deal, which also funds our operation.
[02:23:20.850 --> 02:23:21.850]  You should get it.
[02:23:21.850 --> 02:23:24.650]  You should stop bringing their poison.
[02:23:24.650 --> 02:23:28.010]  But just look at this crap.
[02:23:28.010 --> 02:23:35.289]  Climate change and cardiovascular disease study, it has, I read the study, it has nothing
[02:23:35.289 --> 02:23:39.490]  in it saying, oh, all these young people are having heart attacks now because of climate
[02:23:39.490 --> 02:23:42.890]  change with no evidence or no reasons.
[02:23:42.890 --> 02:23:44.610]  It's not the shots, it's climate change.
[02:23:44.610 --> 02:23:48.170]  In fact, climate change made the virus, not Will.I.Am, remember?
[02:23:48.170 --> 02:23:54.890]  ALS, dementia, and strokes worsened by climate change, suddenly they're exploding, but not
[02:23:54.890 --> 02:24:00.170]  because of the vaccines or the shots that they said would do it, no, they have no proof,
[02:24:00.170 --> 02:24:02.530]  they just say it's climate change.
[02:24:02.530 --> 02:24:08.289]  I thought going out in hot weather makes you healthier.
[02:24:08.289 --> 02:24:16.250]  Rise in heart disease may be explained by extreme weather conditions, ABC News.
[02:24:16.250 --> 02:24:18.810]  It's more fun.
[02:24:18.810 --> 02:24:27.289]  Nearly half of U.S. tap water contaminated with forever chemicals, study claims.
[02:24:27.289 --> 02:24:30.010]  And here's Fox News reporting on all of it.
[02:24:30.010 --> 02:24:36.010]  Experts speculate climate change is increasing kidney stones cases among young children.
[02:24:36.010 --> 02:24:39.850]  And you read the article, the study, no connection, no information.
[02:24:39.850 --> 02:24:48.970]  It's all of the heavy water and the chemicals in it and all of it, but they say, oh, it's
[02:24:48.970 --> 02:24:49.970]  climate change.
[02:24:49.970 --> 02:24:53.250]  Suddenly kids are getting kidney stones and all this, not from the shots, not from the
[02:24:53.250 --> 02:24:58.369]  fluoride, not from all the chemicals, no, it's just you're bad, the earth got hot, that's
[02:24:58.369 --> 02:25:01.810]  why you died, okay?
[02:25:01.810 --> 02:25:04.770]  Here's a senior reporter, nearly half the tap water in the U.S. is contaminated with
[02:25:04.770 --> 02:25:05.770]  forever chemicals.
[02:25:05.770 --> 02:25:06.770]  That's what he finds.
[02:25:06.770 --> 02:25:10.570]  And they just so happen to sterilize you and give you cancer.
[02:25:10.570 --> 02:25:17.369]  Liver damage, hormone suppression, obesity, thyroid, cholesterol, decreased fertility.
[02:25:17.369 --> 02:25:20.170]  How liberal.
[02:25:20.170 --> 02:25:26.490]  They just want it and then, oh, it just so happens to happen.
[02:25:26.490 --> 02:25:33.530]  The water crisis no one in America is fixing, Time Magazine, Camp Lejeune, water contamination.
[02:25:33.530 --> 02:25:38.010]  Two of the nine states with the worst tap water in the United States, radiation, all
[02:25:38.010 --> 02:25:39.010]  of it.
[02:25:39.010 --> 02:25:44.970]  Five years later, lessons from the Toledo water crisis, we sampled tap water across the U.S.
[02:25:44.970 --> 02:25:50.289]  and found arsenic, lead and toxic chemicals, the Guardian, but they don't have a solution
[02:25:50.289 --> 02:25:51.289]  for you.
[02:25:51.289 --> 02:25:54.050]  Flint residents grappled with the water crisis nine years later.
[02:25:54.050 --> 02:26:02.770]  I can play you the media saying on CNN and Stephen Colbert and ABC News and David Hogg,
[02:26:03.010 --> 02:26:04.250]  Alex Jones is a liar.
[02:26:04.250 --> 02:26:06.690]  Your tap water is the best.
[02:26:06.690 --> 02:26:10.810]  New York tap water is pure and clean and has no contaminants.
[02:26:10.810 --> 02:26:14.490]  They have TV ads that say, New York taps the best.
[02:26:14.490 --> 02:26:15.490]  Drink more.
[02:26:15.490 --> 02:26:22.530]  Meanwhile, it's the worst water in the country, probably maybe Flint's worse.
[02:26:22.530 --> 02:26:27.289]  And again, it's like, oh, Alex Jones says, yeah, Alex Jones says filter because he wants
[02:26:27.289 --> 02:26:29.170]  to sell you a filter.
[02:26:29.170 --> 02:26:30.170]  Exactly.
[02:26:30.170 --> 02:26:35.010]  If I owned a gas station at the lake, I don't I'd sell beer, ice cream and, you know, beer
[02:26:35.010 --> 02:26:39.770]  nuts and sunglasses and sunscreen.
[02:26:39.770 --> 02:26:41.650]  It's like Jones is really weird.
[02:26:41.650 --> 02:26:48.449]  He opened a Mexican food restaurant and he sells Mexican food because it's popular.
[02:26:48.449 --> 02:26:51.090]  It's like Jones is selling water filters.
[02:26:51.090 --> 02:26:52.090]  What a piece of crap.
[02:26:52.090 --> 02:26:55.650]  Don't go look up how the highest rated at the lowest price.
[02:26:55.650 --> 02:26:57.050]  Don't actually keep us on air.
[02:26:57.050 --> 02:27:03.170]  Let's say that bastard.
[02:27:03.170 --> 02:27:09.130]  New York City's water also contains tiny shrimp called copepods.
[02:27:09.130 --> 02:27:14.050]  These microscopic crustaceans are actually harmful and are instead used to clear the
[02:27:14.050 --> 02:27:15.810]  water of mosquito larvae.
[02:27:15.810 --> 02:27:19.850]  Well, aren't we lucky that's in the tap water again?
[02:27:19.850 --> 02:27:24.330]  I mean, New York City, one of the biggest cities in the world, with all that runoff
[02:27:24.330 --> 02:27:28.570]  and chemicals and all the people that take drugs and crap it into there and all the sewage.
[02:27:28.570 --> 02:27:31.330]  Of course.
[02:27:31.330 --> 02:27:33.250]  Of course, it's the best water.
[02:27:33.250 --> 02:27:36.730]  You don't want to get deep earth.
[02:27:36.730 --> 02:27:40.449]  If you don't filter your water, if you've got the money.
[02:27:40.449 --> 02:27:45.289]  Because we cook with the with the with the Alexa pure and we have it at the office and
[02:27:45.289 --> 02:27:46.289]  it's really good.
[02:27:46.289 --> 02:27:50.449]  But tap water cuts everything out to non technical levels is amazing.
[02:27:50.449 --> 02:27:54.650]  But I'm a little bit of a latest when it comes to things.
[02:27:54.650 --> 02:27:59.530]  I've got Mountain Valley Spring out of Arkansas.
[02:27:59.530 --> 02:28:00.530]  I don't own the company.
[02:28:00.530 --> 02:28:02.130]  I have no stock in it.
[02:28:02.130 --> 02:28:05.970]  We have that aquapon is a really sweet water to out of Italy.
[02:28:05.970 --> 02:28:10.170]  I drink that some but I mean, most of the time I drink filtered water of the Alexa pure.
[02:28:10.170 --> 02:28:17.530]  But I wouldn't be a liar if I didn't tell you that that aquapon is sweet water.
[02:28:17.530 --> 02:28:19.289]  So is that.
[02:28:19.289 --> 02:28:26.930]  So is that Arkansas water because it's 10,000 feet under a volcano and about five million
[02:28:26.930 --> 02:28:28.130]  years old.
[02:28:28.130 --> 02:28:31.650]  There ain't any atrazine in that, sweetheart.
[02:28:31.650 --> 02:28:37.490]  So if you got the money, I would go with deep earth spring water, but I'm done talking about
[02:28:37.490 --> 02:28:38.490]  that.
[02:28:38.490 --> 02:28:42.050]  The point is, here's what's going on with your water supply.
[02:28:42.050 --> 02:28:43.490]  Here's what they're doing to you.
[02:28:43.490 --> 02:28:44.490]  You should be aware of it.
[02:28:44.490 --> 02:28:48.529]  And it's all been vindicated in spades again.
[02:28:48.529 --> 02:28:53.690]  But drink volcanic water or filter it or you are nuts.
[02:28:53.690 --> 02:28:54.690]  We're right back.
[02:28:54.690 --> 02:28:57.570]  Stay with us.
[02:28:57.570 --> 02:29:04.010]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity,
[02:29:04.010 --> 02:29:07.210]  the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[02:29:07.210 --> 02:29:11.490]  You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration
[02:29:11.490 --> 02:29:12.490]  and self-defense.
[02:29:12.490 --> 02:29:14.690]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[02:29:14.690 --> 02:29:17.210]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[02:29:17.210 --> 02:29:19.250]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:23.170]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water
[02:29:23.170 --> 02:29:24.210]  filtration.
[02:29:24.210 --> 02:29:28.289]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the
[02:29:28.289 --> 02:29:30.410]  high quality water filtration department.
[02:29:30.410 --> 02:29:34.650]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find
[02:29:34.650 --> 02:29:36.250]  and still get quality.
[02:29:36.250 --> 02:29:41.890]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on
[02:29:41.890 --> 02:29:44.130]  water and air filtration.
[02:29:44.130 --> 02:29:46.690]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[02:29:46.690 --> 02:29:47.970]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[02:29:47.970 --> 02:29:50.890]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[02:29:50.890 --> 02:29:58.090]  Go to infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[02:29:58.090 --> 02:30:03.490]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[02:30:03.490 --> 02:30:04.850]  supply.
[02:30:04.850 --> 02:30:09.490]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[02:30:09.490 --> 02:30:13.690]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[02:30:13.690 --> 02:30:16.510]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[02:30:16.510 --> 02:30:19.850]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[02:30:19.850 --> 02:30:25.050]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[02:30:25.050 --> 02:30:28.330]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[02:30:28.330 --> 02:30:34.450]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day derived from ancient
[02:30:34.450 --> 02:30:38.770]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface.
[02:30:38.770 --> 02:30:44.890]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[02:30:44.890 --> 02:30:50.730]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[02:30:50.730 --> 02:30:58.529]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:58.529 --> 02:31:04.450]  We have three original one-of-a-kind toothpaste designed by my father, a dentist, at infowarsstore.com
[02:31:04.450 --> 02:31:08.650]  that don't have fillers, that are filled with high-quality essential oils, and more.
[02:31:08.650 --> 02:31:13.850]  We have the turmeric toothpaste, we have the ultimate tooth whitening with pearl calcium
[02:31:13.850 --> 02:31:18.369]  toothpaste, and we have the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste, again, with a whole bunch
[02:31:18.369 --> 02:31:21.890]  of key essential oils that are so good not just for your teeth and your gums, but your
[02:31:21.890 --> 02:31:23.810]  whole mouth, your throat, and more.
[02:31:23.810 --> 02:31:27.330]  These are really game-changing toothpastes, they're very, very strong.
[02:31:27.330 --> 02:31:31.450]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride, ours don't, and it doesn't have fillers in
[02:31:31.450 --> 02:31:32.450]  it.
[02:31:32.450 --> 02:31:38.450]  It's just chock-full of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[02:31:38.450 --> 02:31:43.210]  It's now back in stock, it became a best-seller, the turmeric toothpaste is available again
[02:31:43.210 --> 02:31:44.210]  at infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:44.210 --> 02:31:47.890]  We're selling out of the tooth whitening toothpaste, we've got some of that left, and we also have
[02:31:47.890 --> 02:31:51.810]  some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste in stock, but it's running out as well.
[02:31:51.810 --> 02:31:57.090]  All three toothpastes in stock for a limited time, infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:57.090 --> 02:32:00.810]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially with
[02:32:00.810 --> 02:32:02.770]  word of mouth and prayer.
[02:32:02.770 --> 02:32:06.170]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[02:32:06.170 --> 02:32:10.289]  caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[02:32:10.289 --> 02:32:12.690]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[02:32:56.050 --> 02:32:59.050]  Please take action.
[02:32:59.050 --> 02:33:05.210]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.720 --> 02:33:19.199]  You know, I don't compare myself to a gladiator, but the last time one of the greatest talk
[02:33:19.199 --> 02:33:26.439]  show hosts in American history came on the broadcast, he compared me to a gladiator.
[02:33:26.439 --> 02:33:33.640]  And I was very, very honored when that great talk show host from San Francisco said that.
[02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:39.080]  Because I mean, I really am, Michael Savage, I really am in the arena, and I'm all the
[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:40.080]  way in the arena.
[02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:41.640]  And I realize it's that animating contest.
[02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:45.279]  So when it comes to battling the globalists, I'm not trying to entertain you.
[02:33:45.279 --> 02:33:51.039]  I'm trying to inspire you to politically not submit and to say no to them.
[02:33:51.039 --> 02:33:53.679]  But at the end of the day, are you not entertained?
[02:33:53.679 --> 02:33:59.000]  Are we not the standard together, the audience, the guest, myself, all of us of resistance?
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.359]  I'm just blessed to be here and blessed to know you.
[02:34:01.359 --> 02:34:02.359]  Here's that clip.
[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:19.800]  How many times must I say I love you before you finally understand?
[02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:30.800]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:34.800]  How many bridges I've got to cross?
[02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:39.800]  How many times must I explain myself?
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:43.800]  Before I can talk to the boys?
[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:47.800]  Before I can talk to the boys?
[02:47:55.800 --> 02:48:02.800]  How many times must I say I love you before you finally understand?
[02:48:03.800 --> 02:48:06.800]  Won't you be my forever woman?
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:10.800]  I'll try to be your forever man.
[02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:14.800]  I'll try to be your forever man.
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:35.800]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:39.800]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:43.800]  How many times must I explain myself?
[02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:47.800]  Before I can talk to the boys?
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:51.800]  Before I can talk to the boys?
[02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:55.800]  Won't you be my forever man?
[02:48:55.800 --> 02:48:59.460]  That turns into, I want the earth destroyed.
[02:49:01.019 --> 02:49:04.779]  Because they take out of context what I said.
[02:49:04.779 --> 02:49:07.920]  And you will then say, why did you then still say that?
[02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:11.840]  Because it's a lesson of the enemy's deception.
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:15.619]  If they cut off the food or they collapse civilization,
[02:49:15.619 --> 02:49:20.119]  it'll end in cannibalism in many poor areas.
[02:49:20.119 --> 02:49:25.080]  And so the modest proposal, is it right to have cannibalism?
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:29.080]  Or should we just eat the rich, as they say?
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:31.259]  But oh, Jones wants to kill his neighbors.
[02:49:31.259 --> 02:49:35.119]  So they've done it again, we knew they'd do it.
[02:49:35.119 --> 02:49:37.439]  No weapon formed against us will prosper.
[02:49:37.439 --> 02:49:40.279]  Let's go ahead and go to what I actually said.
[02:49:40.279 --> 02:49:41.500]  This is only like a minute and a half long.
[02:49:41.500 --> 02:49:45.400]  The full clip, it's a yesterday's show, but here it is.
[02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:47.759]  If it gets to the point where we're not gonna turn it around,
[02:49:47.759 --> 02:49:49.920]  and God knows that, and we've chosen wrong,
[02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:51.519]  I ask for the children's sake,
[02:49:51.519 --> 02:49:53.519]  that God not allow the earth to continue on
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:55.519]  to produce children for this thing to feed on.
[02:49:55.519 --> 02:49:59.359]  I ask God respectively to blow the planet up immediately.
[02:49:59.359 --> 02:50:02.019]  Seriously, I mean, I want God to blow it up now
[02:50:02.019 --> 02:50:03.480]  instead of doing this, okay?
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:06.960]  And God says, you got to fix it.
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:08.519]  I'm on your side, I'll give you discernment,
[02:50:08.519 --> 02:50:10.640]  I'll give you backing, it's not over yet, Jones.
[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:11.720]  And I know that.
[02:50:11.720 --> 02:50:13.720]  But for real debate with the globalists
[02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:17.240]  and have a real discussion with them, they need to know,
[02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:19.800]  we're not backing off, we're not giving in,
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:22.599]  we're not going away, it's a game of chicken.
[02:50:22.599 --> 02:50:25.119]  And so I just want them to know, we are Mad Max.
[02:50:25.119 --> 02:50:29.080]  In fact, we have the real, we have Mad Max on our team.
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:30.759]  Okay, we have Mel Gibson on our team.
[02:50:30.759 --> 02:50:31.980]  We have all the good guys.
[02:50:31.980 --> 02:50:33.679]  Okay, we're not perfect, we're maniacs,
[02:50:33.679 --> 02:50:35.199]  but you do understand,
[02:50:35.199 --> 02:50:38.000]  we're not gonna turn the car off of the chicken.
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:39.439]  We're gonna jam the accelerator down
[02:50:39.439 --> 02:50:41.220]  and aim it straight at your ass.
[02:50:41.220 --> 02:50:43.439]  That's what we're telling you, you need to just turn off now.
[02:50:43.439 --> 02:50:44.560]  You need to turn off now.
[02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:46.439]  But hey, it's okay.
[02:50:47.320 --> 02:50:50.279]  If Tim Cook runs death camps, we know he's gay, right?
[02:50:50.279 --> 02:50:53.119]  As long as you're liberal, as long as it's fun,
[02:50:53.119 --> 02:50:55.119]  as long as it's trendy.
[02:50:55.119 --> 02:50:58.240]  So the big news, enough about all that.
[02:50:58.240 --> 02:50:59.080]  But you have to understand,
[02:50:59.080 --> 02:51:01.279]  more than just news stories or news items, all this,
[02:51:01.279 --> 02:51:04.359]  freedom is popular, exposing the globalists is popular,
[02:51:04.359 --> 02:51:06.199]  standing against them is popular.
[02:51:06.199 --> 02:51:08.759]  The New World Order does not know what to do.
[02:51:08.759 --> 02:51:13.759]  They're in total and complete absolute panic mode right now.
[02:51:14.759 --> 02:51:16.240]  But let's not sit there
[02:51:16.240 --> 02:51:18.160]  and count our chickens before they're hatched.
[02:51:18.160 --> 02:51:19.640]  They're gonna pull some major crap.
[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.320]  They already said the Russians tomorrow
[02:51:22.320 --> 02:51:25.439]  are gonna blow up the nuclear power plant with no evidence.
[02:51:27.160 --> 02:51:28.640]  And last time I checked, that hadn't happened.
[02:51:28.640 --> 02:51:30.320]  So the full clip I explained,
[02:51:30.320 --> 02:51:31.720]  this is a metaphor of what's happening,
[02:51:31.720 --> 02:51:33.679]  and they all know that.
[02:51:33.679 --> 02:51:35.240]  So before we turn our children over to Satan,
[02:51:35.240 --> 02:51:36.679]  should God just end the world?
[02:51:36.679 --> 02:51:39.279]  And that's really a question that we should ask,
[02:51:39.279 --> 02:51:41.199]  but we were told in Revelation how it actually works,
[02:51:41.199 --> 02:51:43.199]  so I'm gonna follow that.
[02:51:43.199 --> 02:51:46.519]  But very, very informative, very, very interesting.
[02:51:46.519 --> 02:51:48.720]  Let's shift gears to some other topics here.
[02:51:50.279 --> 02:51:52.039]  The gold standard is back.
[02:51:52.039 --> 02:51:55.240]  BRICS, to introduce gold-backed reserve currency.
[02:51:55.240 --> 02:51:57.160]  I know most of our audience is extremely informed,
[02:51:57.160 --> 02:51:59.720]  but we have a lot of new listeners out there.
[02:51:59.720 --> 02:52:01.640]  Before I do that, I meant to give the crew this.
[02:52:01.640 --> 02:52:03.880]  I did the other day, but I didn't cover it,
[02:52:03.880 --> 02:52:06.279]  like on last Friday.
[02:52:06.279 --> 02:52:08.320]  I saw this viral thing on Twitter,
[02:52:08.320 --> 02:52:10.439]  like a couple million views,
[02:52:10.439 --> 02:52:14.640]  and it was a meme of a conservative
[02:52:14.640 --> 02:52:17.119]  looking at the French Revolution and loving it.
[02:52:18.119 --> 02:52:23.119]  But then hating current leftist revolutions in France.
[02:52:23.480 --> 02:52:26.199]  Muslim, radical Islamic thing.
[02:52:27.039 --> 02:52:28.800]  And I love the meme that got put out.
[02:52:28.800 --> 02:52:32.160]  The comment was like, imagine being a liberal
[02:52:32.160 --> 02:52:35.240]  and thinking conservatives like the French Revolution.
[02:52:36.640 --> 02:52:39.759]  I mean, if you're a conservative,
[02:52:39.759 --> 02:52:40.599]  and I don't even call myself that,
[02:52:40.599 --> 02:52:42.480]  I'm a populist pro-God guy,
[02:52:42.480 --> 02:52:45.640]  but I agree with almost all the conservative ideas,
[02:52:45.640 --> 02:52:46.840]  but that's too limiting.
[02:52:48.119 --> 02:52:52.039]  Conservatives hate the French Revolution.
[02:52:52.039 --> 02:52:54.359]  George Washington, I've read his books
[02:52:54.359 --> 02:52:56.640]  and articles about it, hated the French Revolution.
[02:52:56.640 --> 02:52:57.840]  It was terrible.
[02:52:57.840 --> 02:53:00.640]  It's the opposite of what we did.
[02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:02.199]  And the left puts out some meme like,
[02:53:02.199 --> 02:53:04.840]  oh, conservatives love the French Revolution,
[02:53:06.359 --> 02:53:08.720]  but they hate the Muslim Revolution.
[02:53:11.320 --> 02:53:12.800]  That's insulting to Muslims to say
[02:53:12.800 --> 02:53:15.320]  a bunch of teenagers burning stuff down
[02:53:15.359 --> 02:53:19.199]  and killing people is what Muslims stand for.
[02:53:23.039 --> 02:53:24.599]  I actually saw a bunch of Muslim girls come out
[02:53:24.599 --> 02:53:26.160]  and say, hey, that's not us, actually.
[02:53:26.160 --> 02:53:28.000]  We need to put those guys in prison.
[02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:29.920]  Yeah, those are just thugs.
[02:53:29.920 --> 02:53:31.439]  That's what Western culture produces
[02:53:31.439 --> 02:53:32.920]  because it's so decadent now.
[02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:33.759]  I've said it.
[02:53:33.759 --> 02:53:35.359]  Hey, the Muslims are way better in America
[02:53:35.359 --> 02:53:36.480]  than Christians are most of the time.
[02:53:36.480 --> 02:53:39.199]  At least they won't let people cut their kids' penises off.
[02:53:39.199 --> 02:53:40.519]  They're all pissed all over Europe,
[02:53:40.519 --> 02:53:41.800]  all over England, all over here.
[02:53:41.800 --> 02:53:44.759]  The Muslims are like, I mean, it may get so bad,
[02:53:44.759 --> 02:53:46.119]  I'm gonna convert to Islam
[02:53:46.119 --> 02:53:48.359]  just so my kids' dicks don't get cut off.
[02:53:48.359 --> 02:53:50.000]  And I'm sorry to talk like that, folks.
[02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:51.439]  And that's all tongue-in-cheek to me.
[02:53:51.439 --> 02:53:52.519]  Jones converts to Islam.
[02:53:52.519 --> 02:53:53.599]  That's not what I did.
[02:53:54.720 --> 02:53:57.720]  By the way, you know Andrew Tate got indicted over there
[02:53:57.720 --> 02:53:59.599]  because the Orthodox Church loved him.
[02:53:59.599 --> 02:54:02.080]  He said he was part of the Orthodox Church.
[02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:04.720]  And Andrew Tate then started moving to Dubai
[02:54:04.720 --> 02:54:06.720]  and could hang out with the royal family there.
[02:54:06.720 --> 02:54:08.119]  And they said, well, you convert to Islam.
[02:54:08.119 --> 02:54:09.960]  He didn't get, he's a smart guy
[02:54:09.960 --> 02:54:10.920]  to get the whole history of it.
[02:54:10.920 --> 02:54:12.119]  I'm gonna call him.
[02:54:12.119 --> 02:54:13.599]  I'm playing phone tag.
[02:54:13.599 --> 02:54:17.840]  And the Orthodox Church in Romania and Hungary and Poland
[02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:18.920]  do not play games.
[02:54:18.920 --> 02:54:22.359]  They repulsed over 100 Muslim invasions.
[02:54:24.119 --> 02:54:28.080]  So Poles and Hungarians and Romanians
[02:54:28.080 --> 02:54:30.359]  would rather you hang their daughter upside down
[02:54:30.359 --> 02:54:35.080]  and fry them in a vat and eat them than to join Islam.
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:37.759]  Yeah, they actually found the meme right there.
[02:54:37.759 --> 02:54:41.400]  So Andrew Tate wants to get the charges dropped.
[02:54:41.400 --> 02:54:43.119]  He's gonna convert back to Christianity.
[02:54:43.640 --> 02:54:44.960]  Immediately.
[02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:47.119]  And I get for him, it's like,
[02:54:47.119 --> 02:54:48.400]  hey, I'm hanging out with the royal family.
[02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:49.359]  They won't make you convert to Islam.
[02:54:49.359 --> 02:54:51.840]  There's a whole politics behind that, Andrew.
[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:54.119]  And look, I know you're smart, but just,
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:54:59.640]  that's why I talk to folks that talk to the president
[02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:01.840]  of the country you're about to be set up in
[02:55:01.840 --> 02:55:03.519]  because he didn't do any of the things they say.
[02:55:03.519 --> 02:55:04.800]  He's a great guy.
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:06.800]  And they're like, it's a power above us,
[02:55:06.800 --> 02:55:08.240]  which is the Orthodox Church.
[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:13.880]  And they just do not take it like that.
[02:55:15.439 --> 02:55:19.519]  And so, and we owe them a debt of gratitude.
[02:55:19.519 --> 02:55:22.960]  They stopped, we'd all be Muslims right now, folks, if we.
[02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:33.840]  So, see, to Andrew, it was just a way
[02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:37.500]  to be friendly with the royal family.
[02:55:38.279 --> 02:55:39.439]  And I get it, you're in Dubai,
[02:55:39.439 --> 02:55:41.279]  the royal family has you over dinner all the time.
[02:55:41.279 --> 02:55:42.400]  They think you're great.
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:45.039]  You are, he's an amazing, smart guy, he's really cool.
[02:55:45.039 --> 02:55:46.439]  All set up, all of it.
[02:55:46.439 --> 02:55:49.400]  But man, you just stepped into the Crusades, bro.
[02:55:51.519 --> 02:55:53.279]  The Crusades were a response
[02:55:53.279 --> 02:55:55.580]  to a thousand years of Muslim invasion.
[02:56:01.119 --> 02:56:02.599]  And so he's wondering why this happened.
[02:56:02.599 --> 02:56:04.800]  It wasn't George Soros called it in.
[02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:07.179]  It wasn't Greta Thunberg, brother.
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:13.439]  You can't live in a country that barely stopped
[02:56:13.439 --> 02:56:15.960]  the full collapse of Europe to the Muslims,
[02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:17.560]  where a third of the population
[02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:21.480]  in one war alone died fighting Muslims.
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:23.599]  And you can't do that there.
[02:56:23.599 --> 02:56:26.160]  Your mistake was, and I'm not being mean here.
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:27.039]  This is a lesson to everybody.
[02:56:27.039 --> 02:56:28.720]  I want Andrew to get out of there.
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:29.960]  I want it to be dropped.
[02:56:31.160 --> 02:56:32.039]  Andrew, you're a great guy.
[02:56:32.039 --> 02:56:33.840]  I've known you for six, seven years.
[02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:38.439]  The only way you don't go to prison,
[02:56:38.439 --> 02:56:40.320]  it's all been rigged against you.
[02:56:40.320 --> 02:56:45.160]  You're totally innocent, is you have to renounce Islam.
[02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:49.039]  And I get it, you're gonna want your fight
[02:56:49.039 --> 02:56:50.880]  and have your war with them, I get it.
[02:56:52.279 --> 02:56:54.199]  But if you do that, they'll drop the charges,
[02:56:54.199 --> 02:56:56.679]  you can get out of there on a helicopter.
[02:56:56.679 --> 02:56:57.840]  But if you don't, brother,
[02:56:57.840 --> 02:57:00.560]  they're gonna lock your ass up for 20 years.
[02:57:00.560 --> 02:57:02.160]  And that's wrong.
[02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:03.400]  And I'm just being a realist here.
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:05.080]  And look, I get it.
[02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:06.320]  The New World Order put a gun to my head and say,
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:08.480]  hey, you need to support the New World Order,
[02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:09.320]  we're gonna kill you.
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:10.439]  I'm not gonna do it, I'm not telling.
[02:57:10.439 --> 02:57:14.439]  But I don't think Andrew Tate converted to Islam
[02:57:15.640 --> 02:57:18.160]  as a sellout or a wimp or a bad guy.
[02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:20.679]  He was just kind of like, hey, I think Dubai's better.
[02:57:20.679 --> 02:57:21.960]  They want me to convert to this.
[02:57:21.960 --> 02:57:24.039]  I like a lot of stuff about Islam.
[02:57:24.039 --> 02:57:25.119]  I'm gonna go there.
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:31.119]  And you're like, dude, you're in Romania.
[02:57:31.119 --> 02:57:32.599]  You don't ask going to prison.
[02:57:33.519 --> 02:57:37.880]  You should have been in Dubai before you made that move.
[02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:38.920]  I know you play chess.
[02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:40.400]  I know your dad was a world chess master.
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:41.439]  So is your brother.
[02:57:41.439 --> 02:57:42.720]  I'm just saying, brother,
[02:57:42.720 --> 02:57:44.320]  that's why they're frying your ass.
[02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:45.320]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:54.000]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[02:57:54.000 --> 02:58:00.000]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:04.000]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:08.000]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:14.000]  Look it up.
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:19.000]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:22.000]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.

[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:32.000]  It is amazing. It's great for your home, your business.
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:35.000]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:36.000]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:40.000]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.

[02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:47.000]  You need this filter.

[02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000]  Instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000]  But these really are amazing products.
[02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000]  The big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:24.000]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:27.000]  People are listening more than ever.
[02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:30.000]  But in this major recession, going into depression,
[02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000]  and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:33.000]  I know times are tough.
[02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000]  So thank you for your support.
[02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:38.000]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000]  That you can do for free.
[02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us,
[02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:45.000]  please support us now.
[02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:48.000]  God bless you.
[02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:55.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:23.000]  I got to say, the UFC in popular media and sports is leading the way out of the NFL,
[03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000]  the NBA, and the rest of the woke-ism.
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:28.000]  Short clip of that coming up next segment with Dana White.
[03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:29.000]  Stay with us.
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:32.000]  But getting back to where I was last segment.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:36.000]  The gold standard is back.
[03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:37.000]  BRICS.
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  That's China, India, Russia, Brazil, and a bunch of other countries.
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:46.000]  To intro gold-backed reserve currency, it's officially been announced.
[03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000]  Meanwhile, China's economy is in big trouble.
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000]  Investors should get out.
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:53.000]  China controls minerals that run the world.
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000]  And it just fired warning shots to the U.S.
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:56.000]  Wall Street Journal.
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000]  They did not fire warning shots.
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:01.000]  They restricted lithium and cobalt shipments.
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  But totally cut off gallium and germanium, which are needed in all microchips.
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:14.000]  The U.S. reportedly has about five weeks left of supplies, which is a blessing.
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  All these damn robots and chips everywhere tracking us.
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  Need to put the brakes on the silicon takeover.
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000]  Dutch government collapses over immigration policy.
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:27.000]  Root, the Bilderberg WEF spokesperson.
[03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000]  But it's really over the farmers.
[03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:33.000]  It's where he lost his coalition and then wanting open borders to Islam.
[03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000]  That took him down.
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:38.000]  Dutch government collapses over immigration policy.
[03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.000]  They wanted a face-saving.
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:43.000]  Oh, the liberals don't want us to control the border when they opened it up.
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  Oh, that's why we fell.
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:46.000]  Something just snapped.
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000]  Consumers panic.
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:52.000]  Search pawn shop near me skyrockets to the top of the charts.
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:58.000]  When the pawn shops are loaded, you know the economy's in bad shape.
[03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:01.000]  When the economy's doing great, the pawn shops are empty.
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:05.000]  Cash-strapped Americans are panic-searching pawn shop near me.
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:12.000]  The search trend spiked to a record high in the state of July, in the start of July.
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:16.000]  And the ominous sign of consumer might be pawning items or selling things
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:21.000]  that were possibly bought during the COVID boom to raise money quick
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:24.000]  amid the worst inflation storm of generation.
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:32.000]  Record-level searches for pawn shop near me.
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:36.000]  Now, we do – they told me today, but now I'm told Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
[03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:40.000]  We've got the director, the actual guy the movie's based on,
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000]  and the actor in the next three days.
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:45.000]  Maybe multiple guys on one day or another guy the next day,
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:48.000]  but I'm really excited about The Sound of Freedom.
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  I did not get to watch it.
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000]  My wife got upset 30 minutes into it.
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:54.000]  Literally, I was at a – my hamburger was being delivered.
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:57.000]  Movie theaters are so cool, and I like that food, you know.
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  My hamburger's being delivered.
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:04.000]  I'm, like, paying them off and, like, walking out eating a hamburger in the parking lot
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:05.000]  because I wanted to watch it.
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000]  But she can't compartmentalize.
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:08.000]  She's got kids.
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:11.000]  I mean, I've got kids too, but she just can't compartmentalize and just watch it.
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:15.000]  She was getting too upset with kids getting kidnapped because she knows it's real.
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:16.000]  See, it's like Hollywood.
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:17.000]  Oh, you can watch that.
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:18.000]  People know it's a true story.
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000]  It's like, okay, this could happen to me.
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000]  So it was a very normal response.
[03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:23.000]  I'm going to go watch it tonight.
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:26.000]  I'll be able to give you a review tomorrow.
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  But to me, bigger than this movie, and I'm not pooh-poohing it or overshadowing it,
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:35.000]  I'm just saying, is the corporate media response attacking it.
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000]  They should have just ignored it because they're a bunch of pedos
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  and pedo supporters and pedo boosters and pedo defenders.
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000]  But no, they didn't do that.
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:51.000]  They have viciously attacked and attacked and attacked and attacked and attacked
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:59.000]  a movie that's based on hundreds of convictions, 6,000 saved people, children.
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  I mean, to me, this is like their biggest jump of the shark thing I've seen.
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:06.000]  I said they jumped the Megalodon.
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000]  That was reportedly about 5,000 years ago.
[03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:09.000]  It might have lived 20 million years.
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:10.000]  I don't know the truth anymore.
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  But they have dug up giant shark cartilage all against their mouths.
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:19.000]  But they do dig up like eight foot wide, you know, giant teeth, giant mouths.
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  I mean, I got a bunch of them.
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:25.000]  I've had family that found Megalodon teeth in South Texas, dug them up themselves.
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  People say, oh, those fossils are fake.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:32.000]  No, no, I've had family dug up giant shark teeth themselves.
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:36.000]  So when I say you jumped the shark, you just jumped the Megalodon here.
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:38.000]  I mean, they've screwed the pooch.
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000]  They've bought the farm.
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:44.000]  They've completely had it.
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:50.000]  I mean, they are now publicly attacking a movie on confirmed 6,000 children saved,
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:53.000]  hundreds of arrests and convictions, saying it does not exist.
[03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:55.000]  Mainstream media is now officially pro-PETO.
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:05:02.000]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:05.000]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:06.000]  So let me get this straight.
[03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:09.000]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document
[03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.000]  showing that during the Obama administration,
[03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:14.000]  Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter
[03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:18.000]  to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption,
[03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:20.000]  an event that Donald Trump looked into,
[03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:23.000]  sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine,
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:26.000]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop,
[03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:33.000]  which the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation
[03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:36.000]  and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:40.000]  all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents,
[03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:44.000]  despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016,
[03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:48.000]  when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump
[03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:52.000]  using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:54.000]  Do I have that all straight?
[03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:02.000]  From the front lines of the information war,
[03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:08.000]  Got Gerald?
[03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:17.000]  Well, the mighty Gerald Cilente, the top trend forecaster,
[03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:21.000]  the forecaster of forecasters, is about to take over.
[03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:26.000]  But I wanted to, in closing, hit this little piece of news.
[03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:30.000]  This cluster bomb story is so big on a bunch of fronts, obviously,
[03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:35.000]  but we have Jen Psaki, we have Joe Biden, we have NPR, we have the State Department.
[03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:37.000]  We played the clubs yesterday.
[03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:40.000]  I'll play one clip here just to document it in a moment,
[03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:44.000]  saying that it is a war crown of war crowns who use a cluster bomb.
[03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:49.000]  Now, the truth is, all of NATO, Russia, China, the United States, the British,
[03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:52.000]  they all use cluster bombs.
[03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:56.000]  And yeah, they're very immoral, like war in general,
[03:06:57.000 --> 03:07:02.000]  because it's not like two knights killing each other with swords or spears or on horseback.
[03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:08.000]  This thing flies in as a missile or a bomb and throws 100, 500 bombs out,
[03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:10.000]  and a bunch of them don't explode.
[03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:14.000]  And then five years later, your dog steps on it and dies,
[03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:17.000]  or your mom steps on it and dies, or your, most of the time, little kids.
[03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:21.000]  Little kids use a little weird little silver thing, picks it up,
[03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:24.000]  punches the button on the top, blows them to pieces.
[03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:25.000]  The lucky ones die.
[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:28.000]  The other ones just get their arms and legs blown off.
[03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:33.000]  So Biden says we're out of ammo.
[03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:34.000]  I got that clip.
[03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:36.000]  We've got to give them cluster bombs.
[03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.000]  Well, the truth is, I've looked at the newscast.
[03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:41.000]  Both sides have been attacking each other with cluster bombs for nine years.
[03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:45.000]  There's been a proxy war in Ukraine between Russia and NATO,
[03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:50.000]  and I've tracked it back to even PBS, seven years ago,
[03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:53.000]  admitting Ukraine used cluster bombs first.
[03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000]  And it's not about joining the Russian side.
[03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:58.000]  It's about admitting who did what.
[03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:01.000]  But why is this so important?
[03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000]  Because if they'll legitimize cluster bombs,
[03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:07.000]  they're going to legitimize F-16s and long-range missiles,
[03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:08.000]  which they say are next.
[03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:11.000]  So they're like, hey, big deal, F-16s, we gave them cluster bombs.
[03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:15.000]  I believe they've announced this because they want to just get it all on the table
[03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:18.000]  and just get everybody used to it and just say, yeah,
[03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.000]  we're giving them cluster bombs, and by the way,
[03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:23.000]  long-range missiles and everything else.
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:28.000]  So UK, Spain, Germany, and Canada come out against Biden
[03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:32.000]  sending civilian-killing cluster bombs to Ukraine in full wars.com.
[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000]  We'll get Gerald Celente's take on this.
[03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:36.000]  We'll skip this break so he has more time.
[03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:41.000]  Cluster munitions transfer shows how U.S.-Ukraine have grown desperate about
[03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:43.000]  counteroffensive failed.
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:45.000]  Remember that old vaunted thing?
[03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:48.000]  Well, it's okay, the Netherlands, when they're banning farmers,
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:52.000]  a man just won the beauty contest.
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:54.000]  That's what really matters.
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:56.000]  Biden says we've run out of ammunition.
[03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:59.000]  Biden explains decision to send cluster bombs to Ukraine.
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:05.000]  Run out of ammunition, so you're losing.
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.000]  Ceaseless escalation.
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:10.000]  RFK Jr. slams Biden for sending cluster bombs,
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:13.000]  and cluster bombs are a terrible weapon.
[03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:17.000]  But compared to DU now being used, they're nothing.
[03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:20.000]  Because if your kid blows their leg off the cluster bomb,
[03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:22.000]  you know what happened with the cluster bomb.
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:25.000]  If you short DU a little whiff of it and die of cancer five years later,
[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000]  no one ever knows what hit you.
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000]  That's the real weapon.
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:30.000]  And Russia said six months ago,
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:34.000]  use DU, we'll start targeting NATO targets outside of Ukraine.
[03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:37.000]  Well, the British have been shipping for at least six months
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:42.000]  DU anti-tank munitions in.
[03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:45.000]  Who would even develop a weapon like that?
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:47.000]  It's radioactive.
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000]  It's poisonous.
[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000]  And to explain, it's radioactive,
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:55.000]  but it has a very poisonous type of vent in the body.
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:59.000]  It has a poisonous angle, not just a radiation angle to it.
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:03.000]  So that's what we're dealing with here.
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:08.000]  So here is Jen Psaki two years ago saying it's a war crime
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:11.000]  that the Russians are using cluster bombs.
[03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:12.000]  It's true.
[03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:15.000]  The rockets hold about a hundred hand grenade type devices.
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:18.000]  They would aim at artillery to kill that.
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:22.000]  They would aim at infantry and artillery to kill them.
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:23.000]  And it's true.
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:25.000]  Both sides are using it and it's a terrible weapon,
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:28.000]  but it's kind of like Democrats going, you know,
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:32.000]  M-16 shoot a bullet that kills people.
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:35.000]  Well, I mean, I can strangle you with my hands.
[03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:39.000]  Do we like to say that's a bio weapon or a WMD?
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:41.000]  I can beat your brains out right now.
[03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:44.000]  I mean, so the idea, it's not even,
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:47.000]  I'm not absconding for Russia or the West.
[03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:48.000]  This is a war.
[03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:49.000]  This is dirty.
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:50.000]  It's escalating.
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:51.000]  And that's the issue.
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:53.000]  What does it go to next?
[03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:56.000]  And that's why they're using the cluster bomb as the cover.
[03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:59.000]  Well, if we use cluster bombs, big deal F-16s.
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:02.000]  And that's really where Russia draws the line,
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:04.000]  because both sides have been using cluster bombs.
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.000]  Here is Jen Psaki.
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:08.000]  There are reports of illegal cluster bombs
[03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:10.000]  and vacuum bombs being used by the Russians.
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:14.000]  If that's true, what is the next step of this administration?
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:19.000]  And is there a red line for how much violence will be tolerated
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:23.000]  against civilians in this manner that's illegal
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  and potentially a war crime?
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:26.000]  It would be.
[03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:28.000]  I don't have any confirmation of that.
[03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:29.000]  We have seen the reports.
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:32.000]  If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime.
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:35.000]  Obviously, there are a range of international fora
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:37.000]  that would assess that.
[03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:39.000]  So certainly we would look to that
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.000]  to be a part of that conversation.
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:45.000]  So NATO and the UN assess a Russian primitive cluster bomb
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:48.000]  as Godzilla, Satan, the worst.
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:51.000]  But when we have a big giant one that has 500 bomblets,
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.000]  well, the Russians have 100 bomblets
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:55.000]  and the Ukrainians have 100 bomblets.
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:59.000]  We're going to give them a 500 or 1,000 bomblet system.
[03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:04.000]  And that's okay, because the international group has assessed it.
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:06.000]  Please keep us on air.
[03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:09.000]  The only way these videos and articles and clips get out is you.
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:12.000]  Great job, listeners.
[03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:14.000]  Keep getting the clips out.
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:16.000]  Keep sharing the reports.
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:19.000]  Keep continuing to stand up against the globalists
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:24.000]  and realize the only voice we have outside of this broadcast is you.
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:28.000]  The only way we're having this effect is because you are powerfully
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:30.000]  standing up and speaking out every day,
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:32.000]  and I salute you and I thank you.
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:33.000]  And I salute the crew.
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:36.000]  I salute the stations, the affiliates, the sponsors.
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:39.000]  But, man, we got great products at InfoWarsTore.com,
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.000]  like the X3 about to sell out,

[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:04.000]  We never once a year maybe do this special, maybe every two years.
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:06.000]  It's all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:07.000]  Enough said about that.
[03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:10.000]  We're skipping this break, so Gerald Salenti gets his time back.
[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:13.000]  Trends Research, Gerald, thank you so much, my brother.
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:14.000]  Thanks for being here.
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:17.000]  Give me your take on this whole situation,
[03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.000]  and maybe your view is different on the cluster bombs,
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:22.000]  but I'm really concerned about it.
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:25.000]  Well, the cover of the Trends Journal is going to be,
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:28.000]  I can't say the word, but it's cluster,
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:31.000]  and it begins with an F, and it has a U and a C in it.
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:32.000]  Well, say it.
[03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:33.000]  We'll delay it out.
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:34.000]  The cover is clusterfuck.
[03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:35.000]  Okay.
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:36.000]  Clusterfuck.
[03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:37.000]  Right.
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:38.000]  Yeah.
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:39.000]  We've been clusterfucked.
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  They're clusterfucks that gave us a cluster bomb.
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  They're little clusterfucks.
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:44.000]  That's all they are.
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:47.000]  You know, what this is going to do,
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:50.000]  this is ramping it up to nuclear war.
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:54.000]  You're seeing it week after week, day after day,
[03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:56.000]  the articles coming out,
[03:13:56.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  what to do in case of a, I'm not making this up,
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:03.000]  a nuclear apocalypse.
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:06.000]  That's the words that they use in Business Insight.
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:09.000]  This is the food you should eat.
[03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:11.000]  This is what you should do.
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:14.000]  What you should do, bend over and kiss your ass goodbye.
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:16.000]  It's the end of the world.
[03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:21.000]  These are demonically evil, satanic people.
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.000]  What's your favorite war?
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:24.000]  You like World War II?
[03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:26.000]  I like World War I.
[03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:29.000]  You know, look at, again, you play that,
[03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:31.000]  she admits it's a war crime.
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:34.000]  Hey, it's okay for Biden to commit war crime,
[03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:37.000]  just like that little lowlife Biden,
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:42.000]  the draft dodger, Vietnam War, my era,
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:46.000]  the guy that loved every damn war that he voted for,
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  including the war on drugs,
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:53.000]  but it's okay for his drug-addicted kid.
[03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:54.000]  Oh, and Alex,
[03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:59.000]  why don't you buy one of his $500,000 paintings?
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:02.000]  Because, man, when you're cracked out,
[03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:04.000]  can you paint fine?
[03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:09.000]  We got insane people running and ruining
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:11.000]  and destroying our lives.
[03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:13.000]  Look at that clown, Saki.
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:15.000]  Oh, where's Saki now?
[03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:17.000]  Oh, she's sucking up crap.
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:19.000]  What, on MSNBC?
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:22.000]  Oh, it's the mainstream media.
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:24.000]  They're nothing but prostitutes.
[03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:27.000]  Media whores that get paid to put out
[03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:29.000]  by their corporate pimps
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:31.000]  and their government whoremasters.
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  We have demonic, if we don't have peace on Earth,
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:37.000]  it's going to be hell on Earth.
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:38.000]  And by the way,
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:41.000]  hey, what, all you Mormons got lockjaw?
[03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:43.000]  Hey, you Quakers,
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:46.000]  what, did you all go down in an earthquake?
[03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:48.000]  Hey, where are you Catholics?
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:49.000]  Hey, Jews?
[03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:51.000]  Hey, what about the Muslims?
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:53.000]  Oh, Seventh-Day Adventists.
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:55.000]  What, are you waiting for the eighth day?
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:57.000]  Where are all the religions?
[03:15:57.000 --> 03:15:59.000]  How come they're not out there for peace?
[03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:01.000]  I'll tell you why.
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:04.000]  Because they are not godly.
[03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:06.000]  They're full of crap.
[03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:07.000]  If they were godly,
[03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:10.000]  they would be stopping this mutinous war
[03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:14.000]  brought to you by the United States and NATO.
[03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:18.000]  And I wrote about how it was happening
[03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:23.000]  back in 2014 in your Trends Journal,
[03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:25.000]  how the United States overthrew
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.000]  the democratically elected government
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:30.000]  of Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine.
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:33.000]  And the reason they overthrew the government,
[03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:35.000]  and again, not my words,
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:36.000]  but out of the EU,
[03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:38.000]  or make that an FU,
[03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:41.000]  yeah, the most corrupt country in Europe.
[03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:43.000]  The cat needed money.
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:45.000]  Who's making a deal with the IMF,
[03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:47.000]  the International Monetary Fund,
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:52.000]  or is it the Mafia Federation and the IMF?
[03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:54.000]  No, the EU and the IMF.
[03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:56.000]  And Putin said, listen,
[03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:58.000]  I got a better deal for you.
[03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:00.000]  I'll give you lower interest rates,
[03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:02.000]  and I'm going to cut the price of your oil.
[03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:04.000]  Oh, no you won't.
[03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:06.000]  And that's when Victoria Nuland,
[03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:09.000]  the undersecretary of state
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:13.000]  under the Nobel Peace Prize winner Barack Obama,
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:17.000]  caught on audio with Jeffrey Pyatt,
[03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:20.000]  another little clown boy of nothing,
[03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:23.000]  United States ambassador to Ukraine,
[03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:26.000]  saying, F-U,
[03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:29.000]  she used the word, to the EU,
[03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:31.000]  we're putting in Yatsenyuk.
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:33.000]  And they overthrew the government.
[03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:36.000]  Yatsenyuk was this little clown boy in Ukraine
[03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:38.000]  before they brought in that guy Poroshenko,
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:40.000]  the other oligarch.
[03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:44.000]  People have no idea the violation of the Minsk agreement.
[03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:48.000]  They have no idea of the deal made between Gorbachev
[03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:51.000]  when they broke up the Soviet Union with Bush Sr.
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:54.000]  Quote, NATO will not move one inch further.
[03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:57.000]  There were 16 NATO countries, today there's 30.
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:18:00.000]  So if we had the Russians up in Canada
[03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:02.000]  with missiles aimed at us,
[03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:05.000]  and the Chinese down in Mexico
[03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:07.000]  with missiles aimed at us,
[03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:09.000]  oh, we'd be happy.
[03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:11.000]  The United States could go into the Black Sea.
[03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:14.000]  Could you imagine the Russians in the Gulf of Mexico?
[03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:17.000]  The Chinese off the coast of Los Angeles?
[03:18:18.100 --> 03:18:22.100]  The Iranians off the coast of New York?
[03:18:22.100 --> 03:18:26.100]  Oh no, but America could go and kill anywhere that they want.
[03:18:26.100 --> 03:18:32.100]  So you're asking me about what it means we are on the verge of nuclear annihilation?
[03:18:32.100 --> 03:18:36.100]  You got a maniac in charge!
[03:18:36.100 --> 03:18:38.100]  That's what I feel like.
[03:18:38.300 --> 03:18:44.300]  So if we don't stop this, it's over.
[03:18:44.400 --> 03:18:53.080]  Again, nothing in the media about it, nothing in the media about the lies being told, and
[03:18:53.080 --> 03:18:55.560]  the average person doesn't know crap.
[03:18:55.560 --> 03:18:57.760]  They know nothing about what's going on.
[03:18:57.760 --> 03:19:03.680]  My father, may his soul rest in peace, as a young guy, I'd start talking about stuff
[03:19:03.680 --> 03:19:07.640]  and he'd say to me, son, take it easy.
[03:19:07.640 --> 03:19:09.359]  People have little minds.
[03:19:09.400 --> 03:19:15.600]  You don't try to convince those people.
[03:19:15.600 --> 03:19:21.400]  We have to unite the people that are listening to Infowars.
[03:19:21.400 --> 03:19:27.680]  It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on
[03:19:27.680 --> 03:19:36.000]  setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men, says Samuel Adams, founding father.
[03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:42.039]  At the height of it, when the revolution began, the data says either less than five or five
[03:19:42.039 --> 03:19:45.240]  percent of the American people supported it.
[03:19:45.240 --> 03:19:51.480]  At the height of the revolution, less than 50 percent, and again, that's why you need
[03:19:51.480 --> 03:19:52.480]  to support Infowars.
[03:19:52.480 --> 03:19:54.560]  You know, I go into Infowars every day.
[03:19:54.560 --> 03:19:57.080]  Every day I go, what are they talking about?
[03:19:57.080 --> 03:19:59.279]  What articles are they talking about?
[03:19:59.279 --> 03:20:04.279]  What Infowars is putting out, nothing else is doing that.
[03:20:04.279 --> 03:20:09.840]  So put your money where your heart and mind are, because if we don't unite, it's finished.
[03:20:09.840 --> 03:20:10.440]  It's over.
[03:20:11.600 --> 03:20:13.600]  So that's what I feel like.
[03:20:13.600 --> 03:20:15.600]  That's what I know.
[03:20:15.600 --> 03:20:19.600]  And again, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:20:19.600 --> 03:20:22.600]  What followed World War II?
[03:20:22.600 --> 03:20:25.600]  Oh, the Great Depression.
[03:20:25.600 --> 03:20:28.600]  What followed the dot-com bust?
[03:20:28.600 --> 03:20:31.600]  Oh, you mean the war on terror?
[03:20:31.600 --> 03:20:38.600]  Alex was talking before I came in about the financial difficulties.
[03:20:38.600 --> 03:20:39.600]  The Great Depression.
[03:20:38.700 --> 03:20:48.020]  Nearly three quarters of millennials are living paycheck to paycheck.
[03:20:48.020 --> 03:20:49.020]  Screw you!
[03:20:49.020 --> 03:20:50.020]  Live paycheck to paycheck.
[03:20:50.020 --> 03:20:51.020]  Get a job at Walmart.
[03:20:51.020 --> 03:20:52.020]  No, no, no.
[03:20:52.020 --> 03:20:53.020]  You could work at Target.
[03:20:53.020 --> 03:20:54.020]  How about Home Depot?
[03:20:54.020 --> 03:21:07.020]  You mean, once upon a time, there used to be hardware stores, stationery stores, grocery
[03:21:07.020 --> 03:21:07.520]  stores.
[03:21:07.600 --> 03:21:19.200]  Clothing stores, now they're all chains, the chains own everything, brought to you by the
[03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:34.080]  scum politicians that deregulated the antitrust acts, Jimmy Carter, Jimmy Carter, yeah, deregulated
[03:21:34.080 --> 03:21:39.040]  the airline industry, yep.
[03:21:39.040 --> 03:21:44.640]  When I used to begin flying, I was flying first class in 1974, I remember flying from
[03:21:44.640 --> 03:21:53.240]  Chicago to LA to Las Vegas, and they rolled down a roast, would you like the roast or
[03:21:53.240 --> 03:21:54.840]  would you like lobster Thermidor?
[03:21:54.900 --> 03:22:05.859]  Now I flew back from Chicago to New York first class and they come out with a basket with
[03:22:05.859 --> 03:22:10.940]  some crackers and junk in it and they give you a glass of wine and a plastic glass.
[03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:16.000]  Everything's gone down, the big zone, everything.
[03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:25.280]  You ready?
[03:22:25.280 --> 03:22:31.880]  Survey found 60% of consumers were living paycheck to paycheck last month, including
[03:22:31.880 --> 03:22:34.880]  73% of millennials.
[03:22:34.880 --> 03:22:42.800]  Send more money to the bloody to killing fields in Ukraine.
[03:22:42.800 --> 03:22:44.480]  Screw you!
[03:22:44.600 --> 03:22:54.920]  Give more money to the military-industrial complex and all you repulsive kids and demo-craps
[03:22:54.920 --> 03:22:59.800]  voted to give more money to the military-industrial complex.
[03:23:00.900 --> 03:23:04.900]  Where are we going?
[03:23:04.900 --> 03:23:08.900]  Look at the little freaks that are running and ruining our lives.
[03:23:08.900 --> 03:23:10.900]  Little Chucky Schumer.
[03:23:10.900 --> 03:23:12.900]  Oh, let me wear my glasses like a Schumer.
[03:23:12.900 --> 03:23:14.900]  Me, me, me, me, me.
[03:23:14.900 --> 03:23:17.900]  I'm Chucky Schumer. I'm Chucky Schumer.
[03:23:17.900 --> 03:23:19.900]  I never work a day of my life.
[03:23:19.900 --> 03:23:23.900]  I just suck off the public hit like the rest of them.
[03:23:23.900 --> 03:23:25.900]  Yes, Mr. Schumer.
[03:23:25.900 --> 03:23:28.900]  Oh, and close down your business.
[03:23:28.900 --> 03:23:30.900]  We got the COVID water fight.
[03:23:30.900 --> 03:23:32.900]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[03:23:32.900 --> 03:23:35.900]  I'm an American. I'm gutless. I'm the masses.
[03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:47.760]  Lindsey Graham. Every day, every day the mainstream media repeating the crap spewing out of that
[03:23:47.760 --> 03:23:56.840]  slob's mouth. A little warmongering freak. Hey, fat boy, go over and fight Ukraine or
[03:23:56.840 --> 03:24:03.320]  shut your mouth. Anybody that wants to give my money to Ukraine, I don't want to go there.
[03:24:03.320 --> 03:24:09.960]  You support Ukraine, you go over there and fight. You go over there and send your money
[03:24:09.960 --> 03:24:17.920]  or shut your mouth. Every one of you repulsive kids and Democrats that vote to steal my money,
[03:24:17.920 --> 03:24:24.960]  you go fight or shut up. But I'll tell you what. There are no fighters. Oh, we got the
[03:24:24.960 --> 03:24:31.080]  cotton boy. Oh, yeah, we got those. Oh, I'm a former military guy. I love killing people.
[03:24:31.080 --> 03:24:39.880]  I'm for peace. Hey, I believe in Jesus Christ. I believe in the Prince of Peace.
[03:24:41.300 --> 03:24:45.300]  I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[03:24:45.300 --> 03:24:48.300]  You're just pieces of crap.
[03:24:48.300 --> 03:24:52.300]  You're gutless little boys and girls who love war and can't fight.
[03:24:52.900 --> 03:25:03.180]  So, going back to how they're robbing us, don't worry millennials, shut your damn mouth
[03:25:03.180 --> 03:25:09.060]  and do what you're told because, oh, this is from Bloomberg.
[03:25:09.060 --> 03:25:10.060]  Can't call it misinformation.
[03:25:10.060 --> 03:25:11.060]  Misinformation.
[03:25:11.060 --> 03:25:15.520]  You know what misinformation is?
[03:25:15.520 --> 03:25:23.080]  Misinformation is not believing the crap that these scum shoved down your throat called politicians.
[03:25:23.080 --> 03:25:24.080]  That's misinformation.
[03:25:24.080 --> 03:25:27.560]  How dare you not swallow my crap?
[03:25:27.560 --> 03:25:30.920]  Oh, it was Independence Day, I forgot, July 4th.
[03:25:30.920 --> 03:25:31.960]  What independence?
[03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:44.480]  World's richest added $852 billion to their fortunes in the first half of 2023, according
[03:25:44.480 --> 03:25:45.320]  to Bloomberg.
[03:25:45.400 --> 03:25:53.440]  Each member of the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index, oh, don't you wish you were a member
[03:25:53.440 --> 03:25:58.680]  of the Billionaire Bloomberg Billionaire's Index, Bloomberg Billionaire's Index.
[03:25:58.680 --> 03:26:05.039]  Hey, hey, you billionaires, how come you don't put any money out for peace?
[03:26:05.039 --> 03:26:07.380]  Because your piece is a crap.
[03:26:07.380 --> 03:26:17.060]  Because if you gave a billion, if you made $852 billion, if you put $1 billion into the
[03:26:17.060 --> 03:26:20.420]  Occupy Peace Movement, we'd have a real peace movement.
[03:26:20.420 --> 03:26:23.500]  Screw you, Solenti, and your movement.
[03:26:23.500 --> 03:26:25.020]  You ready?
[03:26:25.020 --> 03:26:32.380]  Each member of the Billionaire's Index made an average of $14 million per day over the
[03:26:32.380 --> 03:26:34.859]  last six months.
[03:26:34.859 --> 03:26:37.300]  But don't worry about it.
[03:26:37.300 --> 03:26:46.539]  Nearly 50% of the plantation workers of Slavelandia, the world's population, nearly 50%.
[03:26:47.800 --> 03:26:55.800]  Living on $6.25 a day.
[03:26:55.800 --> 03:27:04.800]  Huh. Don't understand why you have this refugee crisis and people are trying to leave all this poverty and go somewhere else.
[03:27:04.200 --> 03:27:14.600]  It's a crime syndicate. Here's what Americans say they need to earn to feel rich or even
[03:27:14.600 --> 03:27:22.840]  just financially secure. This is from the Cartoon News Network, CNN. More than 2,500
[03:27:22.840 --> 03:27:30.600]  U.S. adults say they would need to earn an average of $233,000 a year to feel financially
[03:27:30.600 --> 03:27:39.760]  secure and $483,000 annually to feel rich or attain financial freedom according to bank
[03:27:39.760 --> 03:27:40.040]  rate.
[03:27:40.300 --> 03:27:58.140]  The median earning for a full-time year-round worker in 2021, $56,473.
[03:27:58.200 --> 03:28:01.200]  According to the Census Bureau.
[03:28:01.700 --> 03:28:14.700]  Inflation? Inflation? When I was a young guy, and I moved into the corporate world,
[03:28:15.700 --> 03:28:21.700]  I was making about $40,000 a year.
[03:28:21.700 --> 03:28:25.700]  And that was like a lot of money.
[03:28:27.700 --> 03:28:29.700]  Not anymore.
[03:28:30.700 --> 03:28:34.700]  They've taken over. Oh, inflation's coming down? No, it's not.
[03:28:35.700 --> 03:28:39.700]  What does it cost to buy a house? Only about $50,000 to buy a car.
[03:28:40.700 --> 03:28:47.700]  Anyway, do what you can to support Infowars, because Infowars is doing everything they can to support you.
[03:28:47.700 --> 03:28:51.700]  And that's why I do what I do to support Infowars.
[03:28:51.700 --> 03:28:54.700]  Keep truth alive. We'll be right back.
[03:29:09.700 --> 03:29:13.700]  Get yours today at infowarsstore.com for 50% off.

[03:29:24.700 --> 03:29:25.700]  That's the same formula.

[03:29:27.700 --> 03:29:28.700]  It works great.
[03:29:28.700 --> 03:29:30.700]  But women like pink labels.
[03:29:30.700 --> 03:29:32.700]  Men like different color labels.
[03:29:32.700 --> 03:29:34.700]  So it works for men as well.
[03:29:34.700 --> 03:29:35.700]  It's the same formula.
[03:29:35.700 --> 03:29:36.700]  It's an incredible formula.
[03:29:36.700 --> 03:29:37.700]  And it funds our operation.
[03:29:37.700 --> 03:29:40.700]  And there's another important part of the overall information.

[03:30:09.700 --> 03:30:11.700]  These are amazing products.
[03:30:11.700 --> 03:30:13.700]  And for those of you on the fence, I want you to try them.
[03:30:13.700 --> 03:30:15.700]  Brain Force Ultra hits in 15 minutes.
[03:30:15.700 --> 03:30:18.700]  Only lasts three hours with no hangover.

[03:30:19.700 --> 03:30:21.700]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[03:30:21.700 --> 03:30:25.700]  Then our Brain Force Plus is a good, basic, clean nootropic.
[03:30:25.700 --> 03:30:30.700]  Gives you four to six hours of amazing energy, again, with no hangover, no jitters.

[03:30:42.700 --> 03:30:48.700]  And know, you're funding the second American Revolution, 1776 worldwide.
[03:30:48.700 --> 03:30:51.700]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:30:51.700 --> 03:30:54.700]  And the answer for energy is Brain Force.
[03:30:57.700 --> 03:31:01.700]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[03:31:01.700 --> 03:31:03.700]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:31:03.700 --> 03:31:07.700]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:31:07.700 --> 03:31:10.700]  But when we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes,
[03:31:10.700 --> 03:31:16.700]  the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:31:16.700 --> 03:31:18.700]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[03:31:18.700 --> 03:31:23.700]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week,
[03:31:23.700 --> 03:31:25.700]  it's really just incredible.
[03:31:25.700 --> 03:31:28.700]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:31:28.700 --> 03:31:32.700]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air
[03:31:32.700 --> 03:31:34.700]  if you do not support us.
[03:31:34.700 --> 03:31:36.700]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us,
[03:31:36.700 --> 03:31:37.700]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:31:37.700 --> 03:31:41.700]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarsstore.com,
[03:31:41.700 --> 03:31:44.700]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[03:31:44.700 --> 03:31:46.700]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:31:46.700 --> 03:31:50.700]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:50.700 --> 03:31:54.700]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarsstore.com,
[03:31:54.700 --> 03:31:55.700]  our funding problems will be over.
[03:31:55.700 --> 03:31:56.700]  Please take action now.
[03:31:56.700 --> 03:31:59.700]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders,
[03:31:59.700 --> 03:32:04.700]  the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations,
[03:32:04.700 --> 03:32:07.700]  the economy going crazy, you are crazy in my view
[03:32:07.700 --> 03:32:11.700]  if you don't get high-quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[03:32:11.700 --> 03:32:13.700]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:32:13.700 --> 03:32:16.700]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't,
[03:32:16.700 --> 03:32:18.700]  and I'm preaching the choir on that.
[03:32:18.700 --> 03:32:21.700]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food
[03:32:21.700 --> 03:32:23.700]  or water filtration.
[03:32:23.700 --> 03:32:26.700]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department
[03:32:27.700 --> 03:32:29.700]  and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[03:32:29.700 --> 03:32:33.700]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices
[03:32:33.700 --> 03:32:35.700]  you're going to find and still get quality.
[03:32:35.700 --> 03:32:40.700]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food
[03:32:40.700 --> 03:32:43.700]  and on water and air filtration.
[03:32:43.700 --> 03:32:45.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[03:32:45.700 --> 03:32:47.700]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[03:32:47.700 --> 03:32:50.700]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[03:32:50.700 --> 03:32:54.700]  Go to infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[03:32:57.700 --> 03:33:02.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:33:02.700 --> 03:33:04.700]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.600 --> 03:33:30.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Celente.
[03:33:31.600 --> 03:33:35.600]  Hey, great to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:35.600 --> 03:33:40.600]  You know, I was just listening to that commercial about the water filter.
[03:33:40.600 --> 03:33:43.600]  And this is really important to get.
[03:33:43.600 --> 03:33:47.600]  And again, as I said, when you're getting these products from Infowars,
[03:33:47.600 --> 03:33:55.600]  you're not only keeping Infowars out there and bringing out the truth, you're helping yourself.
[03:33:55.600 --> 03:34:03.600]  You know, this is an article that will be appearing in this week's Trends Journal.
[03:34:03.600 --> 03:34:06.600]  We've been writing about this, by the way, for years.
[03:34:06.600 --> 03:34:09.600]  But talking about water.
[03:34:09.600 --> 03:34:16.600]  Nearly half of tap water in the U.S. contains PFAS.
[03:34:16.600 --> 03:34:18.600]  This is Wall Street Journal.
[03:34:18.600 --> 03:34:23.600]  Close to half the U.S. tap water supply is contaminated with so-called forever chemicals.
[03:34:23.600 --> 03:34:28.600]  A comprehensive study conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey estimated.
[03:34:29.200 --> 03:34:39.200]  Research has detected at least one of the chemicals known as PFAS or whatever it's called,
[03:34:39.200 --> 03:34:42.200]  polyfluoro, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:34:42.200 --> 03:34:45.200]  In about 45% of U.S. drinking water samples.
[03:34:45.200 --> 03:34:46.200]  All right?
[03:34:47.200 --> 03:34:51.200]  Hey, you worried about climate change?
[03:34:51.200 --> 03:34:55.200]  Them chemical companies could kill us any way we want.
[03:34:56.200 --> 03:34:58.200]  Oh, yeah.
[03:34:58.200 --> 03:35:00.200]  We got, uh, we had General Electric.
[03:35:00.200 --> 03:35:02.200]  General Electric here?
[03:35:02.200 --> 03:35:04.200]  Yeah, that poisoned the Hudson River.
[03:35:04.200 --> 03:35:06.200]  Yeah, that's fine.
[03:35:06.200 --> 03:35:09.200]  We could throw any crap we want anywhere.
[03:35:09.200 --> 03:35:12.200]  We pay off the politicians.
[03:35:12.200 --> 03:35:14.200]  We pay them off.
[03:35:14.200 --> 03:35:17.200]  These are little clown boys and girls.
[03:35:17.200 --> 03:35:20.200]  You don't have to pay them a lot of money.
[03:35:20.200 --> 03:35:22.200]  Nah, they never work a day in their lives.
[03:35:22.200 --> 03:35:26.200]  You just give them a little bit of money and you tell them what to do.
[03:35:27.100 --> 03:35:33.100]  So this is why you need these products from Infowars, because they're killing us.
[03:35:33.100 --> 03:35:38.100]  They're killing us physically, mentally, and spiritually.
[03:35:38.100 --> 03:35:45.100]  And by the way, the shirt that I have on, you can get at trendsjournal.com.
[03:35:45.100 --> 03:35:49.100]  We've got here, we've got hoodies, we've got all different kinds.
[03:35:49.100 --> 03:35:51.100]  Here we go.
[03:35:51.100 --> 03:35:56.100]  Hey politicians, who the F are you to tell us what to do?
[03:35:56.100 --> 03:35:59.100]  And that's what they're telling us what to do.
[03:35:59.100 --> 03:36:01.100]  They're sellouts.
[03:36:01.100 --> 03:36:02.100]  They're sellouts.
[03:36:02.100 --> 03:36:06.100]  I was the assistant to the secretary of the New York State Senate.
[03:36:06.100 --> 03:36:08.100]  I was on the inside.
[03:36:08.100 --> 03:36:16.100]  I ran major political campaigns in Westchester County, the richest county in the USA back in the 70s.
[03:36:16.100 --> 03:36:21.100]  I was the chief government affairs specialist in the chemical industry.
[03:36:21.500 --> 03:36:26.500]  I was killing environmental legislation at the height of the environmental movement.
[03:36:26.500 --> 03:36:30.500]  All I wanted to do was make money and a lot of other stuff.
[03:36:30.500 --> 03:36:34.500]  I was putting on my meetings at 28 years old.
[03:36:34.500 --> 03:36:39.500]  I was staying at the Willard Hotel and putting my meetings on at the Hay-Adams in D.C.
[03:36:39.500 --> 03:36:43.500]  I wouldn't know what I know if I wasn't on the other side.
[03:36:43.500 --> 03:36:47.500]  I was on the other side and it is a freak show.
[03:36:48.500 --> 03:36:50.500]  You're still in kindergarten.
[03:36:50.500 --> 03:36:53.500]  They're kindergarten teachers.
[03:36:53.500 --> 03:36:56.500]  Oh, and you know who the officials are?
[03:36:56.500 --> 03:37:01.500]  Your congressmen and your senators and your assemblymen.
[03:37:01.500 --> 03:37:04.500]  Oh, they're the principals of the school.
[03:37:04.500 --> 03:37:06.500]  That's all it is.
[03:37:06.500 --> 03:37:09.500]  We haven't left grammar school.
[03:37:09.500 --> 03:37:16.500]  You're still in school and you got the school head jerks telling us what to do.
[03:37:16.500 --> 03:37:20.500]  So, going back to the beginning.
[03:37:22.300 --> 03:37:28.300]  On the economic front, as Alex was talking about before he went into Ukraine,
[03:37:28.300 --> 03:37:35.300]  this is an article that just came out on CNBC, just before I got on the air.
[03:37:35.300 --> 03:37:41.300]  The American banking landscape is on the cusp of a seismic shift.
[03:37:41.300 --> 03:37:43.300]  Expect more pain to come.
[03:37:43.300 --> 03:37:48.300]  Rising interest rates, losses on commercial real estate,
[03:37:48.300 --> 03:37:52.300]  and heightened regulatory scrutiny will pressure regional and mid-sized banks,
[03:37:52.300 --> 03:37:56.300]  leading to a wave of mergers, sources told CNBC.
[03:37:56.300 --> 03:38:02.300]  Oh, sources said, hey, hey, I can't say the word efface.
[03:38:02.300 --> 03:38:05.300]  We've been saying this for how long?
[03:38:05.300 --> 03:38:09.300]  We've been writing the details for how long?
[03:38:09.300 --> 03:38:12.300]  Oh, commercial real estate?
[03:38:13.800 --> 03:38:17.800]  Wall Street Journal
[03:38:17.800 --> 03:38:22.800]  Last Wednesday, office markets' remote work woes spread.
[03:38:22.800 --> 03:38:28.800]  Many businesses that depended on the sector are having to pivot, shrink, or worse.
[03:38:29.800 --> 03:38:31.800]  No kidding.
[03:38:31.800 --> 03:38:35.800]  We warned this would happen when they launched the COVID war.
[03:38:35.800 --> 03:38:37.800]  It's in your trends journal.
[03:38:37.800 --> 03:38:42.800]  We warned of an office building bust in March of 2020
[03:38:42.800 --> 03:38:46.800]  when the geeks and the other freaks started,
[03:38:46.800 --> 03:38:48.800]  go home, work from home.
[03:38:48.800 --> 03:38:50.800]  You'll get cold if you go to work.
[03:38:50.800 --> 03:38:52.800]  You get COVID if you go to work.
[03:38:54.800 --> 03:38:55.800]  Yep.
[03:38:55.900 --> 03:39:07.859]  Your office vacancy rate in San Diego, in San Francisco, land of the geeks is 30%, 30%.
[03:39:07.859 --> 03:39:09.940]  Can't understand why crime is rising.
[03:39:09.940 --> 03:39:10.940]  Drug dealers everywhere.
[03:39:10.940 --> 03:39:12.580]  Dad, don't worry about it.
[03:39:12.580 --> 03:39:18.859]  Oh, it's about 30% in LA.
[03:39:18.859 --> 03:39:24.940]  You're estimating 25% vacancy rate in Toronto.
[03:39:24.940 --> 03:39:28.820]  It's all over the world.
[03:39:28.820 --> 03:39:30.820]  Remote work persists.
[03:39:30.820 --> 03:39:34.699]  Oh, Wall Street Journal.
[03:39:34.699 --> 03:39:36.699]  Wow.
[03:39:36.699 --> 03:39:42.180]  Commercial sector turmoil, royals, ground lease talks.
[03:39:42.180 --> 03:39:46.420]  Oh, blow me away.
[03:39:46.420 --> 03:39:56.180]  The first quarter of 2023, investors purchased only $489 million in Manhattan office properties
[03:39:56.180 --> 03:40:01.779]  compared with $5 billion in the first quarter of 2022.
[03:40:01.779 --> 03:40:07.460]  Five billion dollars they spent in 2022 to buy offices.
[03:40:08.500 --> 03:40:10.500]  That are now vacant.
[03:40:10.500 --> 03:40:13.500]  How stupid can you be?
[03:40:13.500 --> 03:40:16.500]  I guess you don't read the Trends Journal.
[03:40:16.500 --> 03:40:19.500]  Hey, we're the real estate barons.
[03:40:19.500 --> 03:40:22.500]  You're just a piece of crap, Solenti.
[03:40:22.500 --> 03:40:24.500]  Oh, I guess you never read my books.
[03:40:24.500 --> 03:40:28.500]  Trends 2000, international bestseller.
[03:40:28.500 --> 03:40:33.500]  Trend Tracking, far better than Megatrends, Time Magazine.
[03:40:33.500 --> 03:40:36.500]  On and on and on.
[03:40:36.500 --> 03:40:38.500]  Oh, I only do trend forecasting.
[03:40:38.500 --> 03:40:40.500]  I only teach it.
[03:40:40.500 --> 03:40:41.500]  Don't teach it at Harvard.
[03:40:41.500 --> 03:40:43.500]  Don't teach it at Yale.
[03:40:43.500 --> 03:40:45.500]  Don't teach it at Princeton.
[03:40:45.500 --> 03:40:46.500]  You know why?
[03:40:46.500 --> 03:40:48.500]  They don't know how to.
[03:40:48.500 --> 03:40:50.500]  Oh, but you could take a history course.
[03:40:50.500 --> 03:40:51.500]  Oh, yeah.
[03:40:51.500 --> 03:40:54.500]  And you could get one in art history, too.
[03:40:54.500 --> 03:40:56.500]  I don't care what happened.
[03:40:56.500 --> 03:40:57.500]  What's going to happen?
[03:40:57.500 --> 03:40:59.500]  Shut your mouth.
[03:40:59.500 --> 03:41:01.500]  We don't know what's going to happen.
[03:41:01.500 --> 03:41:03.500]  So we're not going to listen to you.
[03:41:04.500 --> 03:41:09.500]  This office building bust is going to bring down the banks like you've never seen before.
[03:41:09.500 --> 03:41:17.500]  We are in for a banking crisis, the likes of which are unparalleled in modern history.
[03:41:19.400 --> 03:41:22.400]  Not even making the news.
[03:41:22.400 --> 03:41:25.400]  Little headlines they put up.
[03:41:25.400 --> 03:41:26.400]  Little headlines.
[03:41:26.400 --> 03:41:28.400]  Oh, you ready?
[03:41:28.400 --> 03:41:35.400]  Chief Financial Officers weigh the various issues of return to the office.
[03:41:36.400 --> 03:41:40.400]  Financial Officer
[03:41:40.400 --> 03:41:42.400]  Yes sir, I'm a financial officer.
[03:41:42.400 --> 03:41:43.400]  Yes sir.
[03:41:43.400 --> 03:41:44.400]  What officer?
[03:41:44.400 --> 03:41:45.400]  What officer?
[03:41:45.400 --> 03:41:47.400]  A money junkie.
[03:41:47.400 --> 03:41:51.400]  Hey, I play in the street. I'm a member of the club.
[03:41:52.200 --> 03:41:59.200]  This is going to go down so hard, going back to what Alex was saying about gold.
[03:41:59.200 --> 03:42:09.000]  In 2022, the central banks bought more gold than ever.
[03:42:09.000 --> 03:42:19.160]  The first quarter of this year, the central banksters bought 155% more gold than the last
[03:42:19.160 --> 03:42:21.680]  year's first quarter.
[03:42:21.680 --> 03:42:27.240]  They know how bad it's going and they're going to do everything they can to keep gold prices
[03:42:27.240 --> 03:42:32.840]  down before they skyrocket so they can keep buying it up.
[03:42:32.840 --> 03:42:34.320]  And the game is rigged.
[03:42:34.320 --> 03:42:35.320]  Don't believe me?
[03:42:35.320 --> 03:42:43.000]  How about Jamie Dimon's JPMorgan Chase convicted, convicted of rigging the precious metals market
[03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:46.920]  and only fined $900 million, convicted of five felonies.
[03:42:46.920 --> 03:42:51.120]  Hey, I'm JPMorgan Chase, hey, I can do what I want.
[03:42:51.120 --> 03:42:52.920]  So where's gold going?
[03:42:52.920 --> 03:42:53.920]  What's next?
[03:42:53.920 --> 03:42:54.920]  Stay tuned.
[03:42:54.920 --> 03:42:56.920]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:56.920 --> 03:43:01.560]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G
[03:43:01.560 --> 03:43:03.360]  or the GMO crops.
[03:43:03.360 --> 03:43:08.180]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[03:43:08.180 --> 03:43:09.720]  industry to use.
[03:43:09.720 --> 03:43:13.080]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[03:43:13.080 --> 03:43:16.720]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[03:43:16.720 --> 03:43:22.320]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[03:43:22.320 --> 03:43:23.480]  Look it up.
[03:43:23.480 --> 03:43:24.700]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[03:43:24.700 --> 03:43:29.940]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there, highest rated at half the price
[03:43:29.940 --> 03:43:30.940]  of leading competitors.
[03:43:30.940 --> 03:43:33.380]  The Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[03:43:33.380 --> 03:43:35.660]  We have replacement filters for folks who've already gotten it.
[03:43:35.660 --> 03:43:37.580]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[03:43:37.580 --> 03:43:38.620]  It is amazing.
[03:43:38.620 --> 03:43:40.220]  It's great for your home, your business.
[03:43:40.220 --> 03:43:44.900]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water, almost everything's contaminated.
[03:43:44.900 --> 03:43:48.940]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[03:43:48.940 --> 03:43:50.660]  Get yours today at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:43:50.660 --> 03:43:52.940]  For a limited time, we're running a 10% discount.
[03:43:52.940 --> 03:43:53.940]  That is a huge discount.
[03:43:53.940 --> 03:43:55.300]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[03:43:55.300 --> 03:43:56.700]  You need this filter.
[03:43:56.700 --> 03:44:01.500]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because
[03:44:01.500 --> 03:44:03.020]  they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:44:03.020 --> 03:44:05.300]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:44:05.300 --> 03:44:06.800]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[03:44:06.800 --> 03:44:08.020]  We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[03:44:08.020 --> 03:44:14.340]  So we've made our own and it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[03:44:14.340 --> 03:44:16.820]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:44:16.820 --> 03:44:19.380]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:44:19.380 --> 03:44:25.540]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[03:44:25.540 --> 03:44:26.540]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:44:26.540 --> 03:44:30.660]  It says InfoWareStore.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:44:30.660 --> 03:44:31.980]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[03:44:31.980 --> 03:44:33.340]  No, I'm not running for president.
[03:44:33.340 --> 03:44:36.540]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white, and blue.
[03:44:36.540 --> 03:44:37.540]  Alex Jones for president.
[03:44:37.540 --> 03:44:38.540]  2024.
[03:44:38.540 --> 03:44:41.140]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[03:44:41.140 --> 03:44:42.940]  Great way to fund the operation.
[03:44:42.940 --> 03:44:51.140]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWareStore.com or by
[03:44:51.140 --> 03:44:56.420]  calling toll free triple A 253-3139.
[03:44:56.420 --> 03:45:02.860]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity,
[03:45:02.860 --> 03:45:06.060]  the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[03:45:06.060 --> 03:45:10.340]  You are crazy in my view if you don't get high quality storable food and water filtration
[03:45:10.340 --> 03:45:11.340]  and self-defense.
[03:45:11.740 --> 03:45:13.540]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:45:13.540 --> 03:45:16.540]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't, and I'm
[03:45:16.540 --> 03:45:20.500]  preaching the choir on that, but a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't
[03:45:20.500 --> 03:45:23.060]  have enough storable food or water filtration.
[03:45:23.060 --> 03:45:27.260]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the high
[03:45:27.260 --> 03:45:29.260]  quality water filtration department.
[03:45:29.260 --> 03:45:33.660]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and
[03:45:33.660 --> 03:45:35.060]  still get quality.
[03:45:35.060 --> 03:45:40.740]  InfoWareStore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on
[03:45:40.740 --> 03:45:42.900]  water and air filtration.
[03:45:42.900 --> 03:45:45.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[03:45:45.540 --> 03:45:47.780]  Our prices are already the lowest at 10% off.
[03:45:47.780 --> 03:45:49.740]  It's an insane deal for a limited time.
[03:45:49.740 --> 03:45:56.180]  Go to InfoWareStore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[03:45:56.180 --> 03:45:57.180]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[03:45:57.180 --> 03:45:58.180]  Do you like RainForce?
[03:45:58.180 --> 03:45:59.180]  Yeah.
[03:45:59.180 --> 03:46:00.180]  Yeah.
[03:46:00.180 --> 03:46:01.180]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[03:46:01.180 --> 03:46:03.220]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[03:46:03.220 --> 03:46:07.240]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykovitz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now
[03:46:07.240 --> 03:46:09.540]  two books with Alex Jones.
[03:46:09.540 --> 03:46:12.860]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[03:46:12.860 --> 03:46:16.780]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:46:16.780 --> 03:46:22.460]  And so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins, but the one thing that I have really
[03:46:22.460 --> 03:46:26.180]  found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[03:46:26.180 --> 03:46:31.500]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next
[03:46:31.500 --> 03:46:34.020]  four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[03:46:34.020 --> 03:46:39.500]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[03:46:39.500 --> 03:46:40.500]  All right.
[03:46:40.500 --> 03:46:41.500]  We love you.
[03:46:41.500 --> 03:46:42.500]  We'll be right back.
[03:46:42.500 --> 03:46:46.060]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at infowarstore.com.
[03:46:46.060 --> 03:46:58.060]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[03:46:58.060 --> 03:47:04.140]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.600 --> 03:47:26.600]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:47:26.600 --> 03:47:32.600]  Hey, great to be on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:32.600 --> 03:47:42.600]  And you know, Alex Jones and I keep talking about those water filtration systems, and about 10% off on their filtration products.
[03:47:42.600 --> 03:47:46.600]  Fukushima water dump. Yep.
[03:47:46.600 --> 03:47:53.600]  They're going to be dumping that poison water from Fukushima.
[03:47:53.600 --> 03:47:59.600]  Fukushima is spelled F-U-K-U-S-H-I-M-A.
[03:47:59.600 --> 03:48:06.600]  It should be F-U, and it gives another letter you want to throw in there, because that's what they're doing.
[03:48:06.600 --> 03:48:17.600]  Can you imagine this? They're dumping that poison, poison, uranium-filled water into the sea.
[03:48:18.500 --> 03:48:21.500]  This is the sickness of what's going on.
[03:48:21.500 --> 03:48:26.500]  And now, now, in Canada, all over, they're building more nuclear power plants.
[03:48:26.500 --> 03:48:29.500]  It'll be fine. Chernobyl, forget about it.
[03:48:29.500 --> 03:48:32.500]  You know, all these other ones, eh, well, they forgot.
[03:48:32.500 --> 03:48:35.500]  Yeah, don't worry about it. Fukushima, f*** you.
[03:48:35.500 --> 03:48:36.500]  Yep.
[03:48:36.800 --> 03:48:50.679]  Beijing's foreign ministers slammed the Fukushima wastewater plant, accusing Japan of treating
[03:48:50.679 --> 03:48:58.480]  the surrounding ocean as the country's own, quote, private sewer.
[03:48:58.480 --> 03:49:04.720]  On Friday, China expanded restrictions on food imports in Japan, which include a ban
[03:49:04.720 --> 03:49:08.880]  on food products from Fukushima and nine other prefectures.
[03:49:11.500 --> 03:49:16.500]  Eight out of ten South Koreans oppose the Fukushima water dump.
[03:49:16.500 --> 03:49:19.500]  Don't worry about it. It's fine.
[03:49:19.500 --> 03:49:22.500]  So this is why you need to get these products.
[03:49:22.500 --> 03:49:28.500]  And they have a lot of other products going to help you as they're killing us in so many different ways.
[03:49:28.500 --> 03:49:32.500]  And they got their Fourth of July sale going on now.
[03:49:32.500 --> 03:49:37.500]  And you're getting up to 60 percent off plus double Patriot points
[03:49:37.500 --> 03:49:41.500]  if you go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:49:41.500 --> 03:49:45.500]  You got their Brain Force Plus, 50 percent off.
[03:49:45.500 --> 03:49:54.500]  Brain Force Ultra, prebiotic fiber, immune support, organic green fiber caps, all 50 percent off.
[03:49:54.500 --> 03:50:00.500]  You got the ultimate fish oil, ultimate bone broth, ultimate sleep support, 40 percent off.
[03:50:00.500 --> 03:50:05.500]  And super female vitality, 60 percent off.
[03:50:06.500 --> 03:50:09.500]  And I love that super male vitality.
[03:50:09.500 --> 03:50:14.500]  And the ultimate, I love super female vitality too.
[03:50:14.500 --> 03:50:16.500]  I don't know if I should say that.
[03:50:16.500 --> 03:50:19.500]  No, I'm not transgender.
[03:50:19.500 --> 03:50:22.500]  Anyway, they got all these great products.
[03:50:22.500 --> 03:50:28.500]  And you're helping Infowars with these products.
[03:50:28.500 --> 03:50:32.500]  And their filtration products are getting 10 percent off.
[03:50:32.500 --> 03:50:37.500]  And there's never been a more crucial time to stand up and fight our republic,
[03:50:37.500 --> 03:50:40.500]  which is being destroyed right in front of our eyes.
[03:50:40.500 --> 03:50:43.500]  And globalist censorship and attacks are at an all-time high.
[03:50:43.500 --> 03:50:44.500]  We see it.
[03:50:44.500 --> 03:50:49.500]  I mean, again, if you don't swallow the crap spewing out of the government's mouth, you're censored.
[03:50:49.500 --> 03:50:53.500]  So go to Infowarsstore.com, Infowarsstore.com,
[03:50:53.500 --> 03:50:58.500]  and get these products that could help you and also help Infowars.
[03:50:58.500 --> 03:51:00.500]  It's a 360 win.
[03:51:00.500 --> 03:51:04.500]  And that's why I do what I do for Infowars, because I believe in what they're doing.
[03:51:04.500 --> 03:51:09.500]  You know, George Carlin said it's one big club and you ain't in it.
[03:51:09.500 --> 03:51:12.500]  I knew his brother, Patrick, who just passed away recently, by the way.
[03:51:12.500 --> 03:51:15.500]  Patrick used to work for me for a while as well.
[03:51:15.500 --> 03:51:21.500]  And George Carlin said it's one big club and you ain't in it.
[03:51:21.500 --> 03:51:24.500]  This was a story that came out last week.
[03:51:24.500 --> 03:51:36.500]  Alex Soros' access to Biden White House continues as he's now visited at least 20 times, record show.
[03:51:36.500 --> 03:51:40.500]  He also visited Albania with former President Bill Clinton.
[03:51:40.500 --> 03:51:41.500]  Yep.
[03:51:41.500 --> 03:51:47.500]  37-year-old son of George Soros, who doesn't give a penny for peace.
[03:51:47.500 --> 03:51:50.500]  Matter of fact, I lived near Soros.
[03:51:50.500 --> 03:51:51.500]  Soros lived near me.
[03:51:51.500 --> 03:51:53.500]  I lived near him when I was in Rhinebeck.
[03:51:53.500 --> 03:51:55.500]  He had a place up there as well.
[03:51:55.500 --> 03:51:58.500]  And I saw him one time up at Bard College.
[03:51:58.500 --> 03:52:02.500]  He was there with Patrick Moynihan, senator.
[03:52:02.500 --> 03:52:08.500]  I stood up at their conference and gave the other side of the story.
[03:52:08.500 --> 03:52:10.500]  And I was the only one that did it.
[03:52:10.500 --> 03:52:13.500]  But anyway, 20 times.
[03:52:13.700 --> 03:52:21.380]  20 times, hey, what is this guy, better than me?
[03:52:21.380 --> 03:52:26.300]  What the hell is he going to the White House 20 times for?
[03:52:26.300 --> 03:52:32.780]  You only go to the White House if you're a member of the club.
[03:52:32.780 --> 03:52:38.140]  Otherwise, you're just a piece of plantation worker of slavelandia.
[03:52:39.200 --> 03:52:44.200]  Could you see the control of this game?
[03:52:44.200 --> 03:52:47.200]  And you look at this cat, man.
[03:52:47.200 --> 03:52:49.200]  I got to tell you.
[03:52:49.200 --> 03:52:52.200]  I wouldn't want.
[03:52:52.200 --> 03:52:54.200]  A penny.
[03:52:54.200 --> 03:52:59.200]  Of sorrows is billions. If I had to look like that cat.
[03:52:59.200 --> 03:53:01.200]  Or his little boy.
[03:53:01.100 --> 03:53:07.380]  Not a penny.
[03:53:07.380 --> 03:53:14.940]  So going back, again, the Trends Journal gives you history before it happens.
[03:53:14.940 --> 03:53:21.880]  We warned about a commercial real estate bust, office building bust, going back over three
[03:53:21.880 --> 03:53:22.880]  years ago.
[03:53:22.880 --> 03:53:24.060]  You ready?
[03:53:24.200 --> 03:53:30.200]  Today is March, July 10th.
[03:53:30.200 --> 03:53:35.200]  On July 7th,
[03:53:33.500 --> 03:53:47.500]  commercial real estate values is set to crater as much as 40% by 2025 in these major cities.
[03:53:47.500 --> 03:53:51.500]  We warn this is going to happen.
[03:53:51.500 --> 03:53:53.500]  You read the whole article.
[03:53:54.400 --> 03:54:00.800]  And again I underlined the articles and we sent them to the writers and down at
[03:54:00.800 --> 03:54:08.199]  the bottom I wrote to Ben Davis who also does our high-tech science. Ben, not a
[03:54:08.199 --> 03:54:17.240]  word of how this will hit banks holding the loans. Not a word. Not a word.
[03:54:17.240 --> 03:54:21.560]  San Francisco is expected to suffer the largest decline commercial property
[03:54:21.560 --> 03:54:27.560]  values in the city plummeting 40 to 45 percent between 2023, that's this year,
[03:54:27.560 --> 03:54:30.960]  and 2025.
[03:54:31.800 --> 03:54:37.600]  Chicago and New York, 30 to 35 percent.
[03:54:36.800 --> 03:54:40.800]  Boston, 25 percent.
[03:54:40.800 --> 03:54:43.800]  Portland, Denver.
[03:54:43.800 --> 03:54:49.800]  Miami, Dallas, Atlanta, around 20 percent.
[03:54:49.800 --> 03:54:51.800]  That's huge.
[03:54:53.600 --> 03:54:55.600]  How are they going to pay off their debts?
[03:54:55.600 --> 03:54:57.600]  Oh, by the way, I forgot to say this.
[03:54:58.600 --> 03:55:01.600]  As interest rates rise, they got floating loans.
[03:55:01.600 --> 03:55:03.600]  A lot of these, they got to pay more.
[03:55:04.600 --> 03:55:07.600]  Oh, and nobody's talking about, oh, they're going to raise interest rates.
[03:55:07.600 --> 03:55:10.600]  Here's the guess is two more times.
[03:55:11.600 --> 03:55:15.600]  So now they got to pay more on their loans as they have less and less tenants.
[03:55:15.600 --> 03:55:17.600]  They're going to be defaulting on their loans.
[03:55:17.600 --> 03:55:18.600]  But don't worry.
[03:55:18.600 --> 03:55:20.600]  The small banks will go bust.
[03:55:20.600 --> 03:55:25.600]  They'll steal our money, the banks, the federal banksters,
[03:55:25.600 --> 03:55:31.600]  and they'll give it to the JPMorgan Chasers and the Wells Fargoes and the Bank of Americas.
[03:55:31.600 --> 03:55:35.600]  You know, give it all to them to buy up the banks.
[03:55:35.600 --> 03:55:37.600]  So the bigs become bigger.
[03:55:38.800 --> 03:55:46.800]  And Jimmy Codd has started that, letting banks go interstate.
[03:55:46.800 --> 03:55:50.800]  There were only interest state before. Bank of America was only in California.
[03:55:50.800 --> 03:55:53.800]  So the bigs are going to get bigger.
[03:55:53.800 --> 03:55:56.800]  Everything else is going to go down.
[03:55:56.800 --> 03:56:01.800]  And even now, merger and acquisition activity is down, because interest rates are up.
[03:56:01.800 --> 03:56:04.800]  But the bigs are buying, everybody else is failing.
[03:56:05.500 --> 03:56:09.500]  So we have to unite and change this.
[03:56:09.500 --> 03:56:16.500]  I was on with Alex as we do our top trends for the new year back in January.
[03:56:16.500 --> 03:56:21.500]  And it was a great interview, as it always is when I'm on with Alex.
[03:56:21.500 --> 03:56:31.500]  And I said to Alex, to me the best ticket, presidential ticket, would be, this is January,
[03:56:31.500 --> 03:56:38.500]  RFK Jr. for president, Judge Andrew Napolitano for vice president.
[03:56:38.200 --> 03:56:43.200]  Kennedy announced he was running for president in April.
[03:56:43.400 --> 03:56:51.640]  RFK, Jr. could change this.
[03:56:51.700 --> 03:56:55.700]  As I said to him, Mr.
[03:56:56.100 --> 03:56:59.100]  We spoke two weeks ago.
[03:56:59.700 --> 03:57:09.200]  I said, what man in this country, his father was assassinated, an uncle who was president
[03:57:09.200 --> 03:57:10.200]  was assassinated.
[03:57:10.200 --> 03:57:13.200]  He said, you have a heart and soul like nobody else in this country.
[03:57:14.300 --> 03:57:16.300]  We have to change this direction.
[03:57:17.300 --> 03:57:20.300]  And to me, that's the ticket.
[03:57:21.300 --> 03:57:23.300]  And we got to make it happen.
[03:57:24.300 --> 03:57:29.300]  So anyway, if you want history before it happens, you got to Trends Journal, TrendsJournal.com.
[03:57:30.300 --> 03:57:33.300]  You want these T-shirts, you go to TrendsJournal.com.
[03:57:33.300 --> 03:57:35.300]  Hey politicians, who the F are you to tell us what to do?
[03:57:36.300 --> 03:57:42.300]  And if you want to keep supporting the truth, keep supporting Infowars, because they're supporting you.
[03:57:43.300 --> 03:57:45.300]  www.infowars.com
[03:57:44.000 --> 03:57:54.080]  We have three original, one-of-a-kind toothpaste designed by my father, a dentist, at infowars.com
[03:57:54.080 --> 03:57:58.320]  that don't have fillers, that are filled with high-quality essential oils and more.
[03:57:58.320 --> 03:58:03.920]  We have the turmeric toothpaste, we have the ultimate tooth whitening, microcalcium toothpaste,
[03:58:03.920 --> 03:58:08.240]  and we have the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste, again, with a whole bunch of key
[03:58:08.240 --> 03:58:11.680]  essential oils that are so good, not just for your teeth and your gums, but your whole
[03:58:11.680 --> 03:58:13.440]  mouth, your throat, and more.
[03:58:13.440 --> 03:58:17.360]  These are really game-changing toothpastes, they're very, very strong, most over-the-counter
[03:58:17.360 --> 03:58:22.160]  toothpastes have fluoride, ours don't, and it doesn't have fillers in it, it is just
[03:58:22.160 --> 03:58:27.360]  chock-full of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[03:58:27.360 --> 03:58:32.600]  So it's now back in stock, it became a best-seller, the turmeric toothpaste is available again
[03:58:32.600 --> 03:58:36.040]  at infowars.com, we're selling out of the tooth whitening toothpaste, we've got some
[03:58:36.040 --> 03:58:39.840]  of that left, and we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste in stock,
[03:58:39.840 --> 03:58:41.120]  but it's running out as well.
[03:58:41.120 --> 03:58:46.680]  So all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time, infowars.com.
[03:58:46.680 --> 03:58:52.960]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[03:58:52.960 --> 03:58:54.080]  the atmosphere.
[03:58:54.080 --> 03:58:56.760]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:58:56.760 --> 03:59:03.240]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[03:59:03.240 --> 03:59:07.680]  into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic, but containable.
[03:59:07.680 --> 03:59:12.440]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to
[03:59:12.440 --> 03:59:13.560]  dispose of it.
[03:59:13.560 --> 03:59:18.480]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who
[03:59:18.480 --> 03:59:22.000]  was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[03:59:22.000 --> 03:59:28.520]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[03:59:28.520 --> 03:59:30.920]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:59:30.920 --> 03:59:36.160]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:59:36.160 --> 03:59:42.560]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a remedy to this madness.
[03:59:42.560 --> 03:59:45.040]  Available now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:59:45.040 --> 03:59:54.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
