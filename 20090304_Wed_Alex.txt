[00:49.500 --> 00:57.500]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  Alex Jones.
[01:31.000 --> 01:38.000]  It is Wednesday, the 4th day of March 2009. We're going to be live here for the next 4 hours.
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.500]  Normally I have Bob Chapman on once a week, but I've got him popping in for about 15 minutes today
[01:41.500 --> 01:46.500]  to break down the plunge of the stock market below 7000.
[01:46.500 --> 01:52.500]  Pastor Lindsey Williams, you know, his inside information has been proven to be so accurate and so important.
[01:52.500 --> 02:01.500]  And now we've had Davos, Switzerland forum members admit that they're using oil as a weapon against the world to bring it into depression.
[02:01.500 --> 02:07.500]  So the planet will accept the new world order. He'll be joining us for an hour to have open phones and take your calls.
[02:07.500 --> 02:14.500]  And then another state representative is joining us from a separate state, a state we haven't had on yet,
[02:14.500 --> 02:18.500]  who is attempting to declare sovereignty against the feds.
[02:18.500 --> 02:22.500]  So that is coming up today.
[02:22.500 --> 02:34.500]  Listen, I get literally 30, 40, 50 emails a day, comments on the websites, phone calls, questions on the street about Glenn Beck.
[02:34.500 --> 02:45.500]  And Glenn Beck comes out and says they're setting up a new world order with a global bank ruling all of us and that it's a bad thing.
[02:45.500 --> 02:52.500]  And then he always sandwiches it into Al Qaeda is going to get us. Russia is going to get us.
[02:52.500 --> 02:59.500]  We've, you know, got to deal with American terrorists. Ron Paul supporters need to be arrested.
[02:59.500 --> 03:08.500]  The army needs to move against them. So he sandwiches that type of propaganda in with it over and over again.
[03:08.500 --> 03:13.500]  And it's clear what he's doing because so many people have woken up to the new world order through the alternative media.
[03:13.500 --> 03:19.500]  The establishment is having to admit its existence, but then putting their own spin on it.
[03:19.500 --> 03:25.500]  Now, some people liken Glenn Beck to Lou Dobbs and say, well, Alex, you say you like Lou Dobbs.
[03:25.500 --> 03:31.500]  Why don't you like Glenn Beck? No, Lou Dobbs for years.
[03:31.500 --> 03:39.500]  We're talking at least seven, eight years that I know of has been talking about the new world order, the North American Union, the Napa Superhighway.
[03:39.500 --> 03:44.500]  And it's been a great paradox. If we know the media is controlled, how is he allowed to get on there?
[03:44.500 --> 03:49.500]  And about 95% of the time tell the truth.
[03:49.500 --> 03:55.500]  We've had Lou Dobbs on the show. It's completely separate from Glenn Beck.
[03:55.500 --> 04:03.500]  And Glenn Beck, when you hear his radio show, because I scan around in the morning when I'm getting ready to different talk show hosts,
[04:03.500 --> 04:09.500]  hear what they have to say almost every time I tune in, he's like, I hate 9-11 victims, families that say it's an inside job.
[04:09.500 --> 04:14.500]  I hate 9-11 truthers. They're scum. They're trash. They're idiots.
[04:14.500 --> 04:20.500]  Somebody who does something similar is Michael Weiner Savage. The real name is Michael Weiner.
[04:20.500 --> 04:26.500]  He'll say, yeah, there's a new world order, a global government. It's run by the Arabs and we've got to counter it.
[04:26.500 --> 04:31.500]  So they do this very simple bait and switch.
[04:31.500 --> 04:39.500]  And then I saw a clip yesterday. Now I've seen several others where Glenn Beck is on the air saying, yeah, I keep hearing about these FEMA camps
[04:39.500 --> 04:45.500]  and I'm going to have to investigate them and find out if they're real that he makes a joke and says, but Fox News won't let me cover it
[04:45.500 --> 04:51.500]  because I'm controlled. It's control, you know, whole conspiracy theory and then makes a joke.
[04:51.500 --> 04:55.500]  So he brings up FEMA camps that are openly admitted, openly all over the news.
[04:55.500 --> 04:58.500]  And then he acts like he's the only person talking about that he makes a joke about it.
[04:58.500 --> 05:05.500]  And then next cuts to Vladimir Putin is going to attack us and we've got to learn to, you know, single out evil.
[05:05.500 --> 05:13.500]  And Russia wants to go after the United States. Meanwhile, as you know, on 888 last year, a sneak attack was launched against Georgia.
[05:13.500 --> 05:17.500]  And then Russia came in with forces and World War Three almost commenced.
[05:17.500 --> 05:22.500]  You know, it's just incredible propaganda out of the sky.
[05:22.500 --> 05:28.500]  And some people in the comments section are like, oh, Alex, you know, we ought to be glad Becks coming out.
[05:28.500 --> 05:31.500]  Well, he's not coming out against the new world order.
[05:31.500 --> 05:35.500]  I mean, this is Fox News, ladies and gentlemen. This is a Psyop.
[05:35.500 --> 05:42.500]  And every time he covers something true to get people's confidence, he then slips in a bunch of disinfo.
[05:42.500 --> 05:48.500]  So, so Glenn Beck says he doesn't know if the FEMA camps exist or not. He also says maybe they're good.
[05:48.500 --> 05:53.500]  Maybe they're good. That's a quote. You know, maybe they're good. Maybe we need them.
[05:53.500 --> 05:58.500]  No, we don't need them. So coming up at the start of the next hour, I'm going to we're a lot of present planet TV.
[05:58.500 --> 06:04.500]  Hello, this is Steve Shank. Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[06:04.500 --> 06:08.500]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[06:08.500 --> 06:12.500]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods direct.
[06:12.500 --> 06:20.500]  If you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the Earth is cooling, don't call eFoods direct.
[06:20.500 --> 06:24.500]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[06:24.500 --> 06:30.500]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods direct.
[06:30.500 --> 06:34.500]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[06:34.500 --> 06:38.500]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones show are foolish, don't call eFoods direct.

[07:00.500 --> 07:09.500]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[07:09.500 --> 07:16.500]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[07:16.500 --> 07:25.500]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[07:25.500 --> 07:32.500]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[07:32.500 --> 07:35.500]  He had his hand in over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[07:35.500 --> 07:41.500]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[07:41.500 --> 07:50.500]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[07:50.500 --> 07:53.500]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[07:53.500 --> 07:59.500]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[07:59.500 --> 08:08.500]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[08:08.500 --> 08:14.500]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S. and Canada.

[08:59.500 --> 09:08.500]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[09:08.500 --> 09:24.500]  Music
[09:24.500 --> 09:31.500]  Coming up in 52 minutes, I'm going to do a 30-minute report on the FEMA camps.
[09:31.500 --> 09:35.500]  I'm not going to spend the whole time getting into Glenn Beck.
[09:35.500 --> 09:46.500]  But we're going to lay out the facts about the FEMA camps in the United States and our prison population period, how this is a military industrial prison complex.
[09:46.500 --> 09:54.500]  And then I'll break down the propaganda coming out of the mainstream media because now it is hundreds of articles per day.
[09:54.500 --> 09:58.500]  I mean hundreds of articles per day.
[09:58.500 --> 10:07.500]  You can go to Google, type in New World Order, click Google News, and there will be over 100 articles that are just published per day.
[10:07.500 --> 10:14.500]  All saying the New World Order is here. It will be ruled by a World Bank owned by private interest.
[10:14.500 --> 10:21.500]  You will pay carbon taxes to it. This is the only way to get the economy going again.
[10:21.500 --> 10:28.500]  See, they're giving us an offer we can't refuse. They implode the economy by design. The central banks set this up.
[10:28.500 --> 10:33.500]  And then now they are openly announcing that it is a world government.
[10:33.500 --> 10:42.500]  And of course they have a few little voices in the mainstream media so it keeps some semblance of credibility who will mildly criticize the New World Order.
[10:42.500 --> 10:51.500]  But in the case of Glenn Beck, we found like four of these now where he's saying, I'm going to see if these FEMA camps are real but then he makes little jokes.
[10:51.500 --> 10:54.500]  And we're going to see if it's really happening and he makes more jokes.
[10:54.500 --> 11:07.500]  And then he says in one of the clips, he says, well, well, you know, depending on how you look at the government, maybe these FEMA camps are a good thing.
[11:07.500 --> 11:09.500]  He said that on Fox and Friends.
[11:09.500 --> 11:15.500]  In fact, Jarron, we don't have time to play all these clips here, but on the Fox and Friends clip, just watch it.
[11:15.500 --> 11:17.500]  I think it's a couple of minutes in.
[11:17.500 --> 11:24.500]  He starts talking about the FEMA camps and everybody really does look freaked out on Fox News because they've all been told this is real.
[11:24.500 --> 11:26.500]  We're really going into martial law probably.
[11:26.500 --> 11:30.500]  And he then says, maybe, you know, maybe they're a good thing. Maybe the camps are a good thing.
[11:30.500 --> 11:34.500]  Because he says, I've been trying to discredit them, but I really can't.
[11:34.500 --> 11:37.500]  But then he goes, but maybe they're a good thing.
[11:37.500 --> 11:44.500]  And this is the guy who shed over and over again.
[11:44.500 --> 11:47.500]  We need to use the army against the American people.
[11:47.500 --> 11:53.500]  You swear on oath when you're in the army to fight all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[11:53.500 --> 11:56.500]  And well, the army needs to deal with these Ron Paul supporters.
[11:56.500 --> 11:57.500]  They're dangerous.
[11:57.500 --> 12:00.500]  And then he'll say, what do we do about the collapsing economy, the New World Order?
[12:00.500 --> 12:02.500]  You know, the good old boys, what are they going to do?
[12:02.500 --> 12:03.500]  They've got guns.
[12:03.500 --> 12:07.500]  He'll admit, oh, there's a New World Order, but maybe the camps are good.
[12:07.500 --> 12:09.500]  And maybe the good old boys need to be dealt with.
[12:09.500 --> 12:11.500]  The Ron Paul people need to be arrested.
[12:11.500 --> 12:13.500]  He mixes this thing one day.
[12:13.500 --> 12:17.500]  And the next day it's Ron Paul on going Congress.
[12:17.500 --> 12:22.500]  And one of these FEMA camps and Ron Paul goes, well, you know, they've only introduced a bill for the camps.
[12:22.500 --> 12:28.500]  But I think there is a concern because the government's so out of control.
[12:28.500 --> 12:29.500]  I mean, just incredible.
[12:29.500 --> 12:36.500]  But I'm not going to spend too much of the time next hour on Glenn Beck himself.
[12:36.500 --> 12:42.500]  I thought that I would get into the admission of the camps.
[12:42.500 --> 12:49.500]  The camps already built where you can find 24 of the army camps according to army.mil.
[12:49.500 --> 12:55.500]  And just hopefully finally clear the air here for people.
[12:55.500 --> 12:59.500]  I mean, I've made, I don't know, five of my films get into the FEMA camps.
[12:59.500 --> 13:01.500]  Oh, I forgot one more clip I want you to get.
[13:01.500 --> 13:03.500]  He's in there with dozens.
[13:03.500 --> 13:04.500]  We'll never get to them all.
[13:04.500 --> 13:08.500]  Just Google Oliver North FEMA camps.
[13:08.500 --> 13:10.500]  The same one you played on Burma's show last night.
[13:10.500 --> 13:12.500]  And we'll play some Senate hearings.
[13:12.500 --> 13:16.500]  House Senate joint sessions are in contra.
[13:16.500 --> 13:26.500]  Colonel North, I read in the Miami papers and other papers about your plan to hold, to suspend the Constitution and hold Americans in detention centers.
[13:26.500 --> 13:29.500]  Congressman Jack Brooks.
[13:29.500 --> 13:36.500]  And then they cut to the chairman in a way and he says that is classified information.
[13:36.500 --> 13:37.500]  We will not discuss that now.
[13:37.500 --> 13:45.500]  If you'd like to discuss that arrangements can be made to discuss it upon executive session.
[13:45.500 --> 13:57.500]  So that's going on there.
[13:57.500 --> 14:02.500]  But you have to understand that what they do psychologically is they deny the camps.
[14:02.500 --> 14:03.500]  They deny the new rule order.
[14:03.500 --> 14:08.500]  They deny a NAFTA superhighway North American Union.
[14:08.500 --> 14:15.500]  And it doesn't matter if we have the documents and the foreign video clips and world leaders admitting it in white papers and in their own memoirs.
[14:15.500 --> 14:23.500]  It's denied, denied, denied, denied, until they brought us to the implosion point as the trilateral commission said they would do.
[14:23.500 --> 14:28.500]  And now they're going to, as they're saying, look, world government will fix the economy.
[14:28.500 --> 14:31.500]  We're not turning the money spickets back on to you.
[14:31.500 --> 14:36.500]  We're not turning back on the economy until you acquiesce to this.
[14:36.500 --> 14:42.500]  Until you acquiesce to Northcom brigades on the streets of America.
[14:42.500 --> 14:48.500]  Until you acquiesce to local FEMA camps, merging with your local police and state police and clergy.
[14:48.500 --> 14:53.500]  Until you acquiesce to total control and everything you do being micromanaged.
[14:53.500 --> 14:58.500]  And then the government's there with handouts and mortgage help and welfare cards.
[14:58.500 --> 15:06.500]  Now go into just the mainline general public and the middle classes they implode down into total poverty.
[15:06.500 --> 15:09.500]  They're saying, yeah, we don't like it, but what do we do?
[15:09.500 --> 15:19.500]  And suddenly all these operatives like Pat Robertson and others, supposed conservatives come out and say, we all need to accept that socialism is good and will save America.
[15:19.500 --> 15:25.500]  And that Obama is unstoppable. God told me.
[15:25.500 --> 15:29.500]  And suddenly you have all these supposed other conservative leaders saying, well, it's what we've got to do.
[15:29.500 --> 15:34.500]  It's, you know, that or a crisis turning into a catastrophe.
[15:34.500 --> 15:37.500]  Meanwhile, you have all this other news.
[15:37.500 --> 15:40.500]  Russian scholars says U.S. will collapse in the next year.
[15:40.500 --> 15:44.500]  Now there's the Pentagon says they're planning to collapse the U.S.
[15:44.500 --> 15:45.500]  They're preparing for it.
[15:45.500 --> 15:47.500]  The Army War College says it.
[15:47.500 --> 15:49.500]  The British Ministry of Defense says it.
[15:49.500 --> 15:50.500]  All these big corporations say it.
[15:50.500 --> 15:52.500]  All these top trends forecasters say it.
[15:52.500 --> 15:58.500]  But when Fox News and the Wall Street Journal owned by News Corp. report on it, it's the dirty Russians.
[15:58.500 --> 16:00.500]  They are making America collapse.
[16:00.500 --> 16:03.500]  They want America to collapse.
[16:03.500 --> 16:04.500]  That's what Beck will do.
[16:04.500 --> 16:06.500]  It's a talking point, a psych warfare point.
[16:06.500 --> 16:08.500]  I see it everywhere.
[16:08.500 --> 16:16.500]  You know, it's a talking point when they all say it in unison.
[16:16.500 --> 16:26.500]  They come out and they say New World Order, World Bankers, World Government, FEMA camps, martial law, and then they go Russia, Iran.
[16:26.500 --> 16:36.500]  They'll just flip gears and say, yeah, it's really dangerous and go right into with no connection to Iran and Russia and other nations.
[16:36.500 --> 16:39.500]  The globalists want to attack.
[16:39.500 --> 16:40.500]  They get you all scared.
[16:40.500 --> 16:41.500]  Oh, there's an enemy.
[16:41.500 --> 16:42.500]  There's a New World Order.
[16:42.500 --> 16:45.500]  And then they just flip-flop it thinking you're so weak-minded you won't notice it.
[16:45.500 --> 16:51.500]  And without even making an intellectual connection, they just segue right into, we're being menaced by Russia.
[16:51.500 --> 16:52.500]  We're being menaced by Iran.
[16:52.500 --> 16:59.500]  We're being menaced by all these other countries.
[16:59.500 --> 17:00.500]  This is what they do.
[17:00.500 --> 17:04.500]  Meanwhile, the globalists have planned to collapse this economy and bring us into the New World Order.
[17:04.500 --> 17:16.500]  Instead of, as they collapse the economy, having the states declare sovereignty of the Ninth and Tenth Amendment and reconstitute the federal government under a constitutional system and arrest all these criminals that run our government.
[17:16.500 --> 17:22.500]  Those are the two options we really have.
[17:22.500 --> 17:24.500]  There are a few other sub-options.
[17:24.500 --> 17:34.500]  Russian scholar says U.S. will collapse next year.
[17:34.500 --> 17:35.500]  Oh, the Kremlin.
[17:35.500 --> 17:38.500]  The President of Barack Obama will order martial law this year.
[17:38.500 --> 17:39.500]  Sorry, we're already under martial law.
[17:39.500 --> 17:43.500]  Congress has been told they can't see congressional documents.
[17:43.500 --> 17:45.500]  They can't see White House documents.
[17:45.500 --> 17:49.500]  The cover sheet says the President's a dictator.
[17:49.500 --> 17:51.500]  P-81 and others.
[17:51.500 --> 17:52.500]  Let's see.
[17:52.500 --> 17:53.500]  Oh, it's about the Russians.
[17:53.500 --> 17:54.500]  They say it.
[17:54.500 --> 17:59.500]  So, see, when anybody else talks about this now, people go, that's Rusky propaganda, meanwhile, the Pentagon's been planning and all.
[17:59.500 --> 18:09.500]  North Com is the receivership physical thug the soldier for the mafia to carry this out.
[18:09.500 --> 18:11.500]  Barack Obama will order martial law this year.
[18:11.500 --> 18:22.500]  The U.S. will split into six rump states before 2011, and Russia and China will become the backbones of a New World Order.
[18:22.500 --> 18:26.500]  Yeah, over in Russia, it's openly discussed.
[18:26.500 --> 18:30.500]  They say, well, you want a world government, but we're going to run the world government.
[18:30.500 --> 18:32.500]  It's just openly discussed who's going to run the world government.
[18:32.500 --> 18:41.500]  Meanwhile, the average neocon is still sending me emails saying it doesn't exist because Pilhead Limbaugh says it doesn't.
[18:41.500 --> 18:53.500]  Pateron might be easy to ignore, but for the fact that he is the dean of the foreign military school for future diplomats and a regular in Russian state-guided TV channels, like Fox News isn't state-guided,
[18:53.500 --> 18:57.500]  and his predictions fit into an anti-American storyline of the Kremlin leadership.
[18:57.500 --> 19:06.500]  No, the Kremlin, when they source this, say that the European Union and the Anglo-American establishment want to break the U.S. up into the FEMA regions
[19:06.500 --> 19:14.500]  and want to create sectarian violence with Latin Americans that are filling the Southwest and that the British Ministry of Defense says they're setting this up.
[19:14.500 --> 19:19.500]  But see, they don't actually link to those reports. They don't want you to know that.
[19:19.500 --> 19:28.500]  That Russia isn't hard at this saying, please don't move weapons systems around us. Please don't attack us.
[19:28.500 --> 19:33.500]  There is a high probability that the collapse of the United States will occur by 2010.
[19:33.500 --> 19:40.500]  Pateron told dozens of students, professors, and diplomats Tuesday at the Diplomatic Academy, a lecture at the ministry,
[19:40.500 --> 19:46.500]  pointedly invited the Associated Press and foreign media to attend.
[19:46.500 --> 19:55.500]  The prediction by Pateron, a former spokesman for Russia's Federal Space Agency and reportedly an XKGB analyst,
[19:55.500 --> 20:02.500]  measures with negative view that the U.S. that has been flowing from the Kremlin in recent years, in particular from Vladimir Putin.
[20:02.500 --> 20:07.500]  Putin, the former president, who is now prime minister, is liking the United States and Nazi Germany's Third Reich
[20:07.500 --> 20:14.500]  and blames Washington for the global financial crisis that pounded the Russian economy.
[20:14.500 --> 20:21.500]  And the article goes on to say that the Russian analysts didn't give any details. Yes, he did, and his writings are everywhere.
[20:21.500 --> 20:33.500]  So, see, the globalists have hijacked the United States. They're starting World War III, and they want to introduce this that they're going to collapse the United States,
[20:33.500 --> 20:40.500]  and they're going to blame it on Russia, not the bankers. See how this works? And they are going to implode things.
[20:40.500 --> 20:45.500]  I have no doubt. Riots, martial law, you name it. It's pretty clear they're going to go ahead and pull the trigger on us.
[20:45.500 --> 20:53.500]  And then they'll tell you Putin did it on the news, and the public will go to the red lines and throw rocks at pictures of Putin.
[20:53.500 --> 21:19.500]  It's just unbelievable.
[21:19.500 --> 21:26.500]  Have you checked the results? Oh, that's right. I said that. Did you check the ingredients and you checked for caffeine?
[21:26.500 --> 21:35.500]  Life change tea is the real deal. Not a new yippee-yay-yay tea, but a tea if you drink it daily, it'll change your life, and it will clean your body.

[22:00.500 --> 22:07.500]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[22:07.500 --> 22:11.500]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[22:11.500 --> 22:16.500]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[22:16.500 --> 22:23.500]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[22:23.500 --> 22:30.500]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[22:30.500 --> 22:34.500]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[22:34.500 --> 22:44.500]  Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[22:44.500 --> 22:53.500]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com. Or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[22:53.500 --> 23:00.500]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[23:00.500 --> 23:04.500]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[23:04.500 --> 23:10.500]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[23:10.500 --> 23:16.500]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[23:16.500 --> 23:26.500]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933,
[23:26.500 --> 23:29.500]  some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[23:29.500 --> 23:35.500]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[23:35.500 --> 23:41.500]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[23:48.500 --> 23:54.500]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237. Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[23:54.500 --> 23:59.500]  1-800-686-2237.
[24:24.500 --> 24:50.500]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305. That's 866-295-5305.
[24:50.500 --> 25:12.500]  Order online at 866-295-5305 or hbxtract.com.
[25:12.500 --> 25:26.500]  You know, I made some preparations last night to go over the FEMA camps and the problem I've got is I'm literally have hundreds of documents and news articles printed off here in front of me.
[25:26.500 --> 25:36.500]  It's over a hundred. The bills, the executive orders, the presidential decision directives, the mainstream news admitting that Bush wanted to become a dictator
[25:36.500 --> 25:43.500]  and get rid of Posse Commentatus, which they've done, and make the president a dictator.
[25:43.500 --> 25:47.500]  They talk about banning free speech. It's all public.
[25:47.500 --> 25:53.500]  And then meanwhile, Glenn Beck, as if he's the arbiter of all of this, comes on and says,
[25:53.500 --> 26:00.500]  I'm investigating it. I'll let you know if it's true or not, but I've been looking at it. It looks like it's true. Looks like it's true.
[26:00.500 --> 26:05.500]  Never giving any evidence when it's all there. And then saying, but maybe it's a good idea.
[26:05.500 --> 26:08.500]  John, I forgot to ask you during the break, we're going to be playing some video clips in the next hour.
[26:08.500 --> 26:16.500]  We have to limit that because of time. Did you pull out that specific audio clip of him talking about him being a good idea? I sent you?
[26:16.500 --> 26:20.500]  Let's go ahead and play some of that right now.
[26:20.500 --> 26:24.500]  Okay, so it's coming up. You have to, okay, we have a limited staff.
[26:24.500 --> 26:27.500]  I got two guys, one in Minnesota working on this and Jaren out there.
[26:27.500 --> 26:32.500]  I literally came in and handed Jaren a stack of about 100 articles and said, put all these in the computer.
[26:32.500 --> 26:39.500]  That is, pull them up so we can put them on screen. He's in there writing a Q-list up so I can try to go through all these on air as he puts them on screen.
[26:39.500 --> 26:48.500]  Because the public's been conditioned not to believe any of this because they were told for decades it didn't exist while the infrastructure was being built.
[26:48.500 --> 26:55.500]  And you know what? I'm going to do a full hour on this tomorrow. I know we've booked so many guests, but I may have to cancel some guests.
[26:55.500 --> 27:05.500]  In fact, I'm on the verge of canceling guests right now because I don't know if I can do justice to this in 30 minutes and this needs to be done properly.
[27:05.500 --> 27:11.500]  Responsibility, folks. I mean, here's the top of the news that got in front of me.
[27:11.500 --> 27:15.500]  Fox News, Russian scholar says U.S. will collapse next year. Here's another one.
[27:15.500 --> 27:20.500]  Russian general says U.S. may have planned satellite collision. It was like one out of 100 million. That would happen.
[27:20.500 --> 27:27.500]  The New World Order on CNN, LUDOBS tonight, LUDOBS, totally different from Lindback, very credibly covers all of this.
[27:27.500 --> 27:34.500]  And whereas he doesn't go far enough, I've talked to him off air and had him on air. He is a good guy.
[27:34.500 --> 27:39.500]  And he signed a contract years ago to where he had editorial control over the show.
[27:39.500 --> 27:43.500]  You can then ask why to CNN and allow this is to keep some credibility.
[27:43.500 --> 27:50.500]  But he said they're calling for a New World Order last night and he broke down. It's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[27:50.500 --> 27:57.500]  The video's posted that they're setting up a world banking dictatorship.
[27:57.500 --> 28:05.500]  So continuing here, John Deans as Bush almost became an unconstitutional dictator going over these memos.
[28:05.500 --> 28:15.500]  No, Bush's job was to vest unconstitutional dictatorial powers and to continue the construction of the technological control grid.
[28:15.500 --> 28:21.500]  And he did that. See, the left is always making it look like it's like Naomi Wolf. Not saying she's a bad lady.
[28:21.500 --> 28:29.500]  She's just made it all about George Bush. And I said, you watch, lady. It's all going to, in fact, let's get her back on.
[28:29.500 --> 28:31.500]  It's all going to continue under Obama.
[28:31.500 --> 28:36.500]  Meanwhile, you know, we've been covering the clergy response teams a lot here on air.
[28:36.500 --> 28:41.500]  Two years before it was declassified and made public, we had the secret documents.
[28:41.500 --> 28:45.500]  26,000 preachers now integrated in with now over 50,000.
[28:45.500 --> 28:56.500]  I keep saying 25,000. It's now officially 50,000 executives in infregard with shoot to kill orders, license to kill orders under FBI secret deputization.
[28:56.500 --> 29:01.500]  That's been in mainstream news so that they've got secret spies there.
[29:01.500 --> 29:05.500]  But church document encourages congregation to obey government.
[29:05.500 --> 29:12.500]  Shocking provision of Romans 13 claims that pro abortion Obama is God's minister and we must obey everything he says.
[29:12.500 --> 29:19.500]  We got these memos and that were passed out to not just the higher ups in the church, but to the churchgoers.
[29:19.500 --> 29:24.500]  And this is just more examples of people on the government FEMA payroll.
[29:24.500 --> 29:30.500]  That's up on prisonplanet.com church document encourages congregation to obey Obama.
[29:30.500 --> 29:33.500]  So that's up on the site right now.
[29:33.500 --> 29:37.500]  And then I first covered this a few weeks ago and I see these reports all the time.
[29:37.500 --> 29:42.500]  And I got emails and comments on info wars and prison planet on the story we linked to saying I was making it up.
[29:42.500 --> 29:53.500]  I mean, it was a link to the Miami Herald and other newspapers where the babies women will show up when the abortionist is late playing golf in this case.
[29:53.500 --> 29:55.500]  And so she had the baby, it was alive.
[29:55.500 --> 30:04.500]  So they went and threw it up against the wall and then went through it in a trash can for a week and it was fed on by rats and roaches.
[30:04.500 --> 30:06.500]  People didn't like that.
[30:06.500 --> 30:10.500]  In fact, I had a radio station call and say, that's it, you're off the air.
[30:10.500 --> 30:19.500]  I'm bad because I read the Miami Herald on air and because some people out there are pro abortion and don't want to face up with the fact that they kill babies even after they're born.
[30:19.500 --> 30:30.500]  I mean, okay, fine. Have you not figured out folks that I lost more than two thirds of my stations when I came out and said 911 was an inside job and we built the show back to bigger than ever.
[30:30.500 --> 30:33.500]  I'm not compromising when it comes to killing babies.
[30:33.500 --> 30:36.500]  Okay, you can go straight to hell as far as I'm concerned.
[30:36.500 --> 30:39.500]  You understand that you get that straight through your head.
[30:39.500 --> 30:45.500]  All right, good. I'm glad you understand that it's if you want the blood of these dead kids on your soul, that's fine.
[30:45.500 --> 30:50.500]  But just get out of my way. You understand?
[30:50.500 --> 30:54.500]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[30:54.500 --> 31:00.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[31:00.500 --> 31:05.500]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins or herbal supplements?
[31:05.500 --> 31:14.500]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos and toothpaste are full of chemical additives such as sodium laurel sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[31:14.500 --> 31:18.500]  Did you know that most multi-vitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[31:18.500 --> 31:22.500]  Did you know that many herbal remedies contain unwanted additives and fillers?
[31:22.500 --> 31:24.500]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?

[32:51.500 --> 32:59.500]  We're in a no-holds-far information war. Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[32:59.500 --> 33:04.500]  Phase 1 of the insetters' plan for a one-world government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[33:04.500 --> 33:12.500]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior.
[33:12.500 --> 33:17.500]  But we've only seen the beginning. Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[33:17.500 --> 33:21.500]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[33:21.500 --> 33:26.500]  The insetters have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[33:26.500 --> 33:30.500]  Phase 1 is a one-world currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[33:30.500 --> 33:34.500]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[33:34.500 --> 33:39.500]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.
[33:39.500 --> 33:45.500]  That's www.foodshortageusa.com to learn how to prepare for the unthinkable.

[33:50.500 --> 33:56.500]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com or call 877-327-0365.
[33:56.500 --> 34:19.500]  It's 877-327-0365.
[34:26.500 --> 34:39.500]  My goal is to expose false flag terror and to lay myself in the line 110% for my family and humanity.
[34:39.500 --> 34:46.500]  Not because I'm a hero or because I have courage, because I know history and I know that's what liberty and freedom takes.
[34:46.500 --> 34:50.500]  That's the price.
[34:50.500 --> 34:54.500]  And so it is an honor to be persecuted. It is an honor to be lied about.
[34:54.500 --> 35:00.500]  It is a great honor to be attacked because I know I'm doing my job.
[35:00.500 --> 35:08.500]  A lot of you have been involved in abortions and if you repent of it and admit to yourself you are part of a eugenics operation
[35:08.500 --> 35:17.500]  and admit that you killed a precious treasure that was going to be so amazing in your life, you can get that weight, that anvil off your chest.
[35:17.500 --> 35:22.500]  But even if you're going to be for abortion, you should at least be against partial birth abortion in the last trimester.
[35:22.500 --> 35:29.500]  These babies can be adopted. These women aren't educated by Planned Parenthood, set up by Margaret Sanger, with Rockefeller funding you, the eugenicist,
[35:29.500 --> 35:33.500]  who got awards from Hitler and gave awards to Hitler, admired Hitler.
[35:33.500 --> 35:42.500]  Most women don't know that there are charities that will pay more than $50,000 in many cases for babies.
[35:42.500 --> 35:48.500]  And then every time I talk to a eugenicist liberal they go, oh, what about the black babies? Nobody wants them. What about the brown babies?
[35:48.500 --> 35:57.500]  No, no, no, they want those babies too. People stand in line and wait years to get babies of any color.
[35:57.500 --> 36:04.500]  I know my family, I'm natural born to my parents, but my sister was adopted from South Korea.
[36:04.500 --> 36:12.500]  I know. And they don't tell the women that, that there's actually more people wanting to adopt every year than there are even abortions.
[36:12.500 --> 36:18.500]  They don't know that they can go have the baby and give it up for adoption. There's such a huge desire for them.
[36:18.500 --> 36:22.500]  The CPS is out kidnapping a lot of kids and then fencing them through the adoption agencies.
[36:22.500 --> 36:31.500]  And the parents don't even know they're getting kidnapped kids that adopt, the non-biological parents.
[36:31.500 --> 36:41.500]  But they always say, oh, no, nobody wants these brown babies. That's a lie. That's a fraud.
[36:41.500 --> 36:46.500]  And I tell you, I love children so much that down the road, my three aren't enough.
[36:46.500 --> 37:00.500]  I'm probably going to adopt. The only reason I may not is because it's very hard to make sure that you go with an adoption agency where it wasn't some child kidnapped.
[37:00.500 --> 37:13.500]  I'll tell you right now that we make it through this martial law and can back this new world order off that I do intend to adopt little brown babies.
[37:13.500 --> 37:21.500]  But the issue here is that we cover the horrible things that are done to babies after they're even born by the thousands every year,
[37:21.500 --> 37:26.500]  put in tanks of water, put in refrigerators to freeze to death, thrown in trash cans.
[37:26.500 --> 37:31.500]  And here was a case that finally got some attention, Sun Sentinel out of Florida.
[37:31.500 --> 37:37.500]  Miami abortion clinic owner threw live baby away, prosecutors say.
[37:37.500 --> 37:39.500]  Well, yeah, they have witnesses and it's admitted.
[37:39.500 --> 37:44.500]  An abortion clinic owner is accused of delivering a live baby during a botched procedure and then throwing the infant away.
[37:44.500 --> 37:48.500]  Well, no, if you read what really happened, the abortionist didn't show up.
[37:48.500 --> 37:54.500]  So the abortion clinic owner came in, threw the baby up against the wall reportedly from eyewitnesses, the nurses and the woman,
[37:54.500 --> 37:58.500]  and then went and threw it in a trash can and it died days later.
[37:58.500 --> 38:05.500]  Bellicus Gonzalez, 42, was arrested Tuesday and charged with practicing medicine without a license and tampering with evidence.
[38:05.500 --> 38:11.500]  Both felonies said Ed Griffin, a spokesman from the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office,
[38:11.500 --> 38:20.500]  if found guilty Gonzalez would face at least a year in prison and up to 15 years, the teenage mother.
[38:20.500 --> 38:28.500]  Ms. Williams had filed a lawsuit alleging that Gonzalez knocked the infant off the chair when she gave birth
[38:28.500 --> 38:34.500]  and then scooped the baby up, placenta and afterbirth in a red plastic biohazard bag and threw it out.
[38:34.500 --> 38:41.500]  The clinic's doctor, Dr. Paris Jean Jacques Reniquel, had been scheduled to perform the procedure,
[38:41.500 --> 38:48.500]  but Williams went into labor after being given drugs to dilate her cervix and waiting for hours for the abortions to arrive.
[38:48.500 --> 38:57.500]  The suit said the doctor had said that he had been on his way to the clinic when he was called to treat another patient who was bleeding.
[38:57.500 --> 39:02.500]  Last month, the Board of Medicine revoked the doctor's license for committing medical malpractice,
[39:02.500 --> 39:09.500]  delegating responsibility to unlicensed personnel and failing to keep an accurate medical record.
[39:09.500 --> 39:17.500]  And it goes on. The baby lived for days and days and days in the trash outside
[39:17.500 --> 39:21.500]  and I don't want to go into what happens to a baby when that is done.
[39:21.500 --> 39:23.500]  Now, a lot of people don't want to hear about that.
[39:23.500 --> 39:27.500]  You don't want to hear about the whole people, your warehouse and nursing homes that die of bad sores.
[39:27.500 --> 39:32.500]  You don't want to hear about the children grabbed in the country that's even been in the New York Daily News
[39:32.500 --> 39:37.500]  and other publications that don't just have drugs tested on them until they die, but they have pesticides tested on them.
[39:37.500 --> 39:43.500]  You don't want to hear about how more than 90% of the infant formula has melamine in it, source-associated press.
[39:43.500 --> 39:48.500]  You don't want to hear about how there's mercury in half of the corn syrup products.
[39:48.500 --> 39:52.500]  You don't want to hear about how GMO food kills the rats and guinea pigs they feed it to.
[39:52.500 --> 39:55.500]  You don't want to hear about how cancer levels are exploding.
[39:55.500 --> 39:58.500]  You don't want to hear about how 9-11 was an inside job.
[39:58.500 --> 40:01.500]  You don't want to hear about a million, 300,000 dead Iraqis.
[40:01.500 --> 40:05.500]  You don't want to hear about anything and that's why tyranny is going to take over and hurt all of us.
[40:05.500 --> 40:10.500]  Because when you stop caring and when you stop being involved and when you stop at least saying no to evil
[40:10.500 --> 40:13.500]  and crying and it takes over and runs wild.
[40:21.500 --> 40:28.500]  And I tell you, this abortion issue, there are people that don't even want us to talk about how
[40:28.500 --> 40:39.500]  in most partial birth abortions, because it's by law they've got to kill the baby still in the woman.
[40:39.500 --> 40:42.500]  In the birth canal.
[40:42.500 --> 40:48.500]  I mean, if you're going to be involved in this, don't you at least want to know what it is?
[40:48.500 --> 40:50.500]  No, you don't want to hear it.
[40:50.500 --> 40:58.500]  So they take the baby and they claim it's a loophole if they hold the baby fully out of the woman
[40:58.500 --> 41:04.500]  where it's been warm and safe and they hold the baby's head touching the woman's body
[41:04.500 --> 41:12.500]  and they claim that's a loophole and they jab a big hole in the back of its head and they stick a high powered suction vacuum cleaner
[41:12.500 --> 41:16.500]  just like they use the dentist in the back of its head and they suck its portal brains out.
[41:16.500 --> 41:19.500]  Now listen to me.
[41:19.500 --> 41:26.500]  That's pure evil and I don't care what people say or think about me.
[41:26.500 --> 41:28.500]  I'm the same person.
[41:28.500 --> 41:30.500]  It's insane to do that.
[41:30.500 --> 41:35.500]  And if you don't like hearing about that and you're not going to stand up against that and say no to that,
[41:35.500 --> 41:41.500]  there's something fundamentally wrong with you.
[41:41.500 --> 41:47.500]  You know, they've done psychological studies and tests where if you see a dog being killed, everybody freaks out and cries and gets violent.
[41:47.500 --> 41:53.500]  But if you see humans dying, people don't care because we've been conditioned to not care about our own species.
[41:53.500 --> 41:56.500]  We've lost our humanity.
[41:56.500 --> 42:01.500]  And whereas I love dogs and hate seeing a dog die, it's nothing compared to seeing a human die
[42:01.500 --> 42:06.500]  because I haven't lost my humanity and that's my most valuable possession.
[42:06.500 --> 42:13.500]  That's who I am.
[42:13.500 --> 42:15.500]  This isn't, you know, I try to have fun on the show.
[42:15.500 --> 42:16.500]  I try to be positive.
[42:16.500 --> 42:18.500]  I try to be happy.
[42:18.500 --> 42:21.500]  I try to fund our operation.
[42:21.500 --> 42:24.500]  I try to expand what we're doing.
[42:24.500 --> 42:26.500]  I know we're right about the information we cover.
[42:26.500 --> 42:27.500]  I understand how the world operates.
[42:27.500 --> 42:28.500]  I understand history.
[42:28.500 --> 42:29.500]  I've done my research.
[42:29.500 --> 42:33.500]  I've done my homework.
[42:33.500 --> 42:43.500]  And it tears my guts out to know that we could just stand up and be good, decent people and say no to evil and learn to recognize evil
[42:43.500 --> 42:49.500]  and learn to fight evil and things would be so much better in society and people would be so fulfilled.
[42:49.500 --> 42:54.500]  But people aren't fulfilled on average, they're lazy, they're self-centered.
[42:54.500 --> 42:57.500]  They don't have a gauge for humanity or history.
[42:57.500 --> 43:00.500]  They don't have discernment.
[43:00.500 --> 43:08.500]  They don't even enjoy how beautiful God's nature is or how beautiful the stars are or how wondrous this one existence is.
[43:08.500 --> 43:13.500]  But they don't understand how they are meant to change the world and be involved in the world and make the world a better place.
[43:13.500 --> 43:21.500]  They don't have any understanding of what it is to be alive and that is what's so sad is that so many people are going through live
[43:21.500 --> 43:25.500]  just programmed by the television set and they're not even alive.
[43:25.500 --> 43:27.500]  I don't hate Glenn Beck.
[43:27.500 --> 43:28.500]  I just know who he is.
[43:28.500 --> 43:29.500]  I know what he is.
[43:29.500 --> 43:30.500]  I can look at him.
[43:30.500 --> 43:31.500]  I can listen to him.
[43:31.500 --> 43:32.500]  He works for Fox News.
[43:32.500 --> 43:34.500]  He says arrest Ron Paul supporters.
[43:34.500 --> 43:35.500]  Use the army against us.
[43:35.500 --> 43:39.500]  And now he flip-flops and says, yeah, I'm looking into the FEMA camps, but maybe they're needed.
[43:39.500 --> 43:46.500]  And then next he goes into how we've got to have war with Russia and Iran and how they're going to attack us and how they've got WMDs, the same old lies.
[43:46.500 --> 43:57.500]  And it's clear that they're just piggybacking patriot information and then tying an end to pro-neural order information to try to co-op the liberty movement that's awakening to support these wars and tyranny.
[43:57.500 --> 44:08.500]  And just because the new world order is evil doesn't mean that Iran is an evil and the leadership of Russia is a corrupt and evil.
[44:08.500 --> 44:09.500]  Absolutely.
[44:09.500 --> 44:11.500]  But we're talking about who is the big power?
[44:11.500 --> 44:12.500]  Who is the mega power?
[44:12.500 --> 44:13.500]  It's the central banks.
[44:13.500 --> 44:26.500]  Who's imploding the economy by design and bragging about it and openly setting up a carbon tax to regulate every facet of our lives and announcing there'll be carbon taxes from Australia to the United States on all newborn children?
[44:26.500 --> 44:27.500]  That's the one child policy.
[44:27.500 --> 44:29.500]  That's how it started in China in 1975.
[44:29.500 --> 44:32.500]  It came along in 1981.
[44:32.500 --> 44:38.500]  It's happening.
[44:38.500 --> 44:50.500]  And if we stand up and say no to this tyranny now, if we stand up and face the facts and the reality and get the word out and warn people, there will be such a human crime it's beginning to be raised.
[44:50.500 --> 44:51.500]  I see you doing it.
[44:51.500 --> 45:04.500]  We are literally moving the immovable object with God's help if we commit and decide no matter what we're doing, it's going to happen.
[45:04.500 --> 45:10.500]  There are so many documented cases of, you know, a car on top of a child and a mother will pick the car up.
[45:10.500 --> 45:16.500]  You see, the brain has a governor in it, just like an engine will have a governor or a lawnmower so you don't blow the engine.
[45:16.500 --> 45:34.500]  But when you go mind over matter and you decide, well, they've done psychological tasks to major universities where they've hypnotized a 150-pound man that can only bench press 200 pounds and they can hypnotize them and they can bench press, you know, 700 pounds, 800 pounds.
[45:34.500 --> 45:36.500]  And again, that's just physical mind over matter.
[45:36.500 --> 45:43.500]  You talk to the Olympic athletes and pro football people, you know, folks that can jump over a whole defensive line.
[45:43.500 --> 45:49.500]  It's getting in the zone, ladies and gentlemen, and we've got to get in the zone for liberty.
[45:49.500 --> 45:53.500]  I am not concerned if they grab me, torture me, and kill me.
[45:53.500 --> 45:56.500]  I'm not concerned if they destroy my name and make stuff up about me.
[45:56.500 --> 45:57.500]  I'm not concerned.
[45:57.500 --> 45:59.500]  I'm even ready to be in solitary confinement.
[45:59.500 --> 46:03.500]  I'm ready for whatever it takes because I know that I am meant to be a good human.
[46:03.500 --> 46:04.500]  I am meant to fight evil.
[46:04.500 --> 46:09.500]  I am meant to give 110% for liberty and truth.
[46:09.500 --> 46:14.500]  And if you have the attitude of you're willing to lay down your life, you're going to be given your life.
[46:14.500 --> 46:20.500]  You know, that's not magic there in the Bible when Christ says those that are ready to lay down their lives will game their life.
[46:20.500 --> 46:22.500]  Those that are going to keep their lives will lose their lives.
[46:22.500 --> 46:28.500]  When you're all cowards playing it safe, not getting outside the box, only watching your television set.
[46:28.500 --> 46:32.500]  You know, you may know about this stuff, but you're not out there involved because you're too scared.
[46:32.500 --> 46:38.500]  Because you wanted to save your life, you're probably going to lose your life, at least your financial future.
[46:38.500 --> 46:51.500]  But if you decide just to stand up, not take it, just the spiritual act of saying no to evil.
[46:51.500 --> 46:53.500]  The spiritual act of saying no to being a coward.
[46:53.500 --> 46:57.500]  The spiritual act of setting yourself on the right path of righteousness.
[46:57.500 --> 46:59.500]  And I don't mean the righteousness that the phony preachers talk about.
[46:59.500 --> 47:07.500]  I mean real righteousness, goodness, loving good things, loving honor, loving truth, loving beauty, loving innocence.
[47:07.500 --> 47:16.500]  Loving true sacrifice, not counterfeit sacrifice for the New World Order.
[47:16.500 --> 47:24.500]  Just that act of flipping your mindset into gear, then you'll know what to do against the New World Order.
[47:24.500 --> 47:29.500]  Then you'll be empowered and you will burn with desire.
[47:29.500 --> 47:37.500]  You will feel literal life force pouring through your sinews, through your bones, through your guts, through your mind to a level you can't believe.
[47:37.500 --> 47:47.500]  And the only thing you won't be happy about is that you can't do enough and that you are worldly and that you still have the flesh side of you attached to you like an anchor.
[47:47.500 --> 47:51.500]  But that anchor will become smaller and smaller and smaller.
[47:51.500 --> 48:02.500]  And as you go through tribulation and as you go through being slapped down and attacked and silenced and continue to persevere and continue to move forward with commitment,
[48:02.500 --> 48:07.500]  doors will open to you in the fight against tyranny.
[48:07.500 --> 48:12.500]  It is the law of the universe.
[48:12.500 --> 48:13.500]  The universe bends.
[48:13.500 --> 48:16.500]  I forget who said that, was it?
[48:16.500 --> 48:28.500]  I believe it was Einstein. The universe bends towards justice.
[48:28.500 --> 48:30.500]  But they taught you you were an addict.
[48:30.500 --> 48:38.500]  What first thing they do is they have Madison Avenue come out and teach men that they're not manly and that they're weak.
[48:38.500 --> 48:45.500]  Unless they do this, this and that, they teach women they're not beautiful, they're not fulfilled.
[48:45.500 --> 48:52.500]  And then once you feel like you're not fulfilled, once you feel like you don't have power, once you feel like there's not a greater destiny in your life,
[48:52.500 --> 49:00.500]  then you buy into, well, if I just go along with the system's paradigm, you know, they're overlay of the way the world works.
[49:00.500 --> 49:05.500]  And if I play ball and follow what the television set and the corporate media tells me a success, I'll be happy.
[49:05.500 --> 49:06.500]  And then you're not happy.
[49:06.500 --> 49:07.500]  You get more and more unhappy.
[49:07.500 --> 49:11.500]  So you go, well, I better just work harder to conform to this system.
[49:11.500 --> 49:21.500]  And this hierarchical system, like a bunch of parrots sitting in a tree and, you know, the king parrot sits the highest or the way chimpanzees or other primates operate.
[49:21.500 --> 49:23.500]  We have to transcend that.
[49:23.500 --> 49:25.500]  You watch these globalists, they relish petty power.
[49:25.500 --> 49:28.500]  They relish the exercise of power.
[49:28.500 --> 49:30.500]  They relish abusing goodness.
[49:30.500 --> 49:34.500]  They relish abusing honor because they are threatened by it.
[49:34.500 --> 49:35.500]  It is painful.
[49:35.500 --> 49:37.500]  It's like a screeching sound to them.
[49:37.500 --> 49:43.500]  It's like goodness is like a alarm going off.
[49:43.500 --> 49:44.500]  They just want to shut it up.
[49:44.500 --> 49:47.500]  It's like an alarm clock.
[49:47.500 --> 50:05.500]  Even if they've totally given their conscience over to evil and harden their heart as black as the Stygian night, they still, as black as the dark gulfs of Hades, as the dark gulfs between the stars, between the galaxies, as the coldness of the night circle of hell.
[50:05.500 --> 50:09.500]  Even when they've lost their soul, they still don't like goodness.
[50:09.500 --> 50:11.500]  It's still a blinding light.
[50:11.500 --> 50:12.500]  They can't stand it.
[50:12.500 --> 50:13.500]  They don't like it.
[50:13.500 --> 50:15.500]  They want to silence it.
[50:15.500 --> 50:25.500]  And that's why every time a powerful demon of the New World Order gets in control of a country through Stalin or Hitler or Mao or others, they just start slaughtering everyone.
[50:25.500 --> 50:30.500]  In Lenin's directives to his NKVD, he would just say, more blood, kill more.
[50:30.500 --> 50:31.500]  Kill more.
[50:31.500 --> 50:35.500]  They'd say, we've killed all the leadership of the town, we've stolen everything, and just kill more.
[50:35.500 --> 50:37.500]  Kill children, more blood.
[50:37.500 --> 50:41.500]  These are on record directives.
[50:41.500 --> 50:56.500]  It's on record in mainline history books that Lenin, before he went in in 1916, 1917, and over through Russia in 1918, that he would go with his wife to a little island that had all these overpopulated shins of rabbits.
[50:56.500 --> 51:01.500]  And he would just run around grabbing them, strangling them, killing them, rolling around.
[51:01.500 --> 51:03.500]  I mean, these people are nuts.
[51:03.500 --> 51:06.500]  And I tell you, the abortionists love killing babies.
[51:06.500 --> 51:08.500]  And I talk about how they're on record.
[51:08.500 --> 51:09.500]  Just Google it.
[51:09.500 --> 51:10.500]  Look it up.
[51:10.500 --> 51:11.500]  People see me.
[51:11.500 --> 51:13.500]  Oh, they don't love doing it.
[51:13.500 --> 51:17.500]  They don't enjoy the power.
[51:17.500 --> 51:19.500]  It's sick.
[51:19.500 --> 51:26.500]  It's a vortices into a hell-raiser dimension.
[51:26.500 --> 51:34.500]  It's a vortices into darkness.
[51:34.500 --> 51:36.500]  Call it what you want.
[51:36.500 --> 51:38.500]  Of the event horizon.
[51:38.500 --> 51:41.500]  And the evil is now coming through.
[51:41.500 --> 51:44.500]  It's now pouring into the world.
[51:44.500 --> 51:52.500]  And I'm telling you right now, what we need in this time is for the spirit of the Lord.
[51:52.500 --> 51:57.500]  When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[51:57.500 --> 51:59.500]  Are you that standard?
[51:59.500 --> 52:00.500]  You know you are.
[52:00.500 --> 52:01.500]  Arise.
[52:01.500 --> 52:03.500]  What will you do when the economy collapses?
[52:03.500 --> 52:06.500]  Store shelves are empty and your stored food is gone.

[52:57.500 --> 53:07.500]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[53:07.500 --> 53:09.500]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[53:09.500 --> 53:11.500]  But who is the enemy?
[53:11.500 --> 53:12.500]  Bin Laden.
[53:12.500 --> 53:13.500]  This is his MO.
[53:13.500 --> 53:14.500]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[53:14.500 --> 53:16.500]  We have to look to his home of Bin Laden.
[53:16.500 --> 53:23.500]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[53:23.500 --> 53:30.500]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[53:30.500 --> 53:34.500]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[53:34.500 --> 53:41.500]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[53:41.500 --> 53:44.500]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[53:44.500 --> 53:45.500]  Fabled Enemies.

[54:39.180 --> 54:43.440]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that
[54:43.440 --> 54:47.240]  would steal our God-given rights of healthcare and freedom of speech.
[54:47.240 --> 55:07.960]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com or call 888-213-4338 and help us win this battle.
[55:07.960 --> 55:11.400]  Make no mistake, this life is a test.
[55:11.400 --> 55:18.520]  You are meant to stand in the midst of evil and resistance.
[55:18.520 --> 55:28.160]  You will not be fulfilled until you set your mind and soul in motion to fight evil, to
[55:28.160 --> 55:52.880]  defend the weak.
[55:52.880 --> 56:03.120]  All right, in other news, the establishment is losing control of the Republican Party.
[56:03.120 --> 56:05.880]  Republicans are finding out there is a new world order, there is a world government limbo,
[56:05.880 --> 56:11.680]  lied to them all those years, stalling us when we still had time to stop things before
[56:11.680 --> 56:13.560]  they came to fruition.
[56:13.560 --> 56:16.920]  We can still stop it, but it's going to be a much harder fight now.
[56:16.920 --> 56:20.320]  So they're billing him as the leader of the Republican Party, and Ron Paula said that's
[56:20.320 --> 56:25.400]  a sad thing, you know, a discredited drug addict, and I don't even criticize him for
[56:25.400 --> 56:26.400]  that.
[56:26.400 --> 56:27.840]  People get hurt and they get addicted to opiates.
[56:27.840 --> 56:33.960]  The issue is he still says put drug users in prison and throw away the key, such a hypocrite.
[56:33.960 --> 56:40.440]  And it's now come out in Democratic memos, the Politico website is reporting.
[56:40.440 --> 56:44.040]  Top Democrats believe they have struck political gold by the victory of Russia limbo as the
[56:44.040 --> 56:47.760]  new face of the Republican Party, a full-scale effort hatched by some of the most familiar
[56:47.760 --> 56:52.160]  names in politics and now being guided as part of an inside White House operation.
[56:52.160 --> 56:59.680]  Now, I said this months ago, Obama can't run, and he's acting like he's still running,
[56:59.680 --> 57:03.920]  his agenda in the name of being anti-established because he's continuing everything Bush did
[57:03.920 --> 57:06.600]  and expanding much of it.
[57:06.600 --> 57:12.280]  And so they're going to use the ridiculous fake conservative characters who are attacking
[57:12.280 --> 57:18.760]  Obama, see, when you attack Obama from a fake right-wing position, it only politically
[57:18.760 --> 57:22.160]  strengthens him.
[57:22.160 --> 57:26.320]  And that's what limbo's job is.
[57:26.320 --> 57:29.200]  That's why Bill Clinton's been saying nice things about him, and they talk about how
[57:29.200 --> 57:38.440]  they hung out at dinner one time at a steakhouse, and it's just disgusting, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:38.440 --> 57:43.480]  And I'm just looking at limbo, I mean, he's so thoroughly discredited all those years
[57:43.480 --> 57:47.120]  saying the Council on Foreign Relations didn't exist, the New World Order didn't exist, and
[57:47.120 --> 57:50.440]  then, okay, the CFR exists, but they don't run anything, and then now, okay, there's
[57:50.440 --> 57:54.240]  a world government with a world carbon tax being set up, but the Liberals run it.
[57:54.240 --> 57:58.880]  When all Bush did was prepare it, Bush set the table, now Obama's sitting down to eat
[57:58.880 --> 58:03.920]  it with the bankers.
[58:03.920 --> 58:08.320]  And that's why the Obama deception that's on sale now at infowars.com is so important
[58:08.320 --> 58:14.040]  because it is all about smashing the left-right paradigm, showing how both parties are controlled,
[58:14.040 --> 58:18.920]  and the way it goes after Obama is the truth, and so it's the only effective way to shoot
[58:18.920 --> 58:22.440]  down their agenda.
[58:22.440 --> 58:24.720]  So I want to invite you to pre-order the Obama deception now.
[58:24.720 --> 58:26.920]  It's going to be shipping now in 11 days.
[58:26.920 --> 58:30.120]  Well, really technically, 10 because it goes out on the 15th.
[58:30.120 --> 58:31.120]  10 days from now.
[58:31.120 --> 58:40.600]  Get your order in at infowars.com, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or write

[58:49.400 --> 58:54.680]  And you know, opening up my heart last segment, everybody, that's really where I stand, and
[58:54.680 --> 58:58.000]  that's what we're doing.
[58:58.000 --> 59:02.640]  I just want to thank my family for all they've gone through in standing behind me, not just
[59:02.640 --> 59:08.520]  my wife and children, but my parents, and my one living grandmother, and my aunts and
[59:08.520 --> 59:09.520]  uncles and everybody.
[59:09.520 --> 59:15.240]  I love you, because even though we knew this was all coming, we knew we were right about
[59:15.240 --> 59:20.040]  it because it was the Global of Stone documents, it still is bracing.
[59:20.040 --> 59:26.280]  It's not fear, it's like jumping in the cold water, it's bracing, it makes you so awake,
[59:26.280 --> 59:28.920]  so alive.
[59:28.920 --> 59:32.160]  It does shake you to your foundations, but every time you shake your foundations, you
[59:32.160 --> 59:42.920]  only become stronger as you face the true horror of the New World Order and battle it.

[1:00:06.840 --> 1:00:10.800]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in
[1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:12.400]  the final equation between you.

[1:01:05.280 --> 1:01:06.280]  Big Brother.
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:08.280]  Mainstream media.
[1:01:08.280 --> 1:01:10.080]  Government cover-ups.
[1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:11.080]  You want answers?
[1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:13.200]  Well, so does he.
[1:01:13.200 --> 1:01:23.040]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:34.000]  It is Wednesday, the fourth day of March 2009, for the next 30 minutes, I'm going to break
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:39.240]  down the reality of the military industrial complex takeover, the FEMA camps, the open
[1:01:39.240 --> 1:01:42.280]  announcement of world government being set up by the banks that you'll pay card and taxes
[1:01:42.280 --> 1:01:48.880]  to, and how people like Glenn Beck are countering this, and after denying it all these years,
[1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:52.560]  and how they're attempting to co-op the Patriot Liberty Movement, and how every time he talks
[1:01:52.560 --> 1:01:56.080]  about FEMA camps, he then talks about the threat of Russia and Iran.
[1:01:56.080 --> 1:02:01.400]  He creates the fear of FEMA camps, then psychologically flips it into then going into Iran's got
[1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:05.040]  nukes, and we've got to go after them more of the same propaganda.
[1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:08.440]  Get your confidence talking about the FEMA camps, things like that, but then says maybe
[1:02:08.440 --> 1:02:11.640]  the FEMA camps are needed, and then we're also going to integrate that with some of
[1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:16.760]  those attacks on Ron Paul, 9-11 truthers, and others saying that we should have the
[1:02:16.760 --> 1:02:18.560]  military sicked on us.
[1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:23.440]  And the reason I'm getting into this is because this is a scythe by Fox News, this is Fox
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:27.640]  News, the big purveyors of propaganda, they're there to neutralize conservatives, you know,
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:31.680]  Limbaugh has been discredited for decades saying no new world order existed, now it's all over
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:33.520]  the news as the savior.
[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:37.200]  It's exactly as we said the new world order would be, a World Bank, Bank of the World
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:41.880]  Time Magazine Newsweek, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times of London, all saying it's
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:44.960]  good, North American Union's good, and the Wall Street Journal now owned by Newscore
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:50.200]  and Fox News, you know, okay, we're in a depression, the answer is world government.
[1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:53.200]  And then they have him over there playing the part of, well, I don't know if this is
[1:02:53.200 --> 1:02:58.600]  a good idea, but I'm worried about the bubble factor in their guns, what do we do?
[1:02:58.600 --> 1:03:04.160]  That's the same way that Tommy Franks four years ago would go on Fox and say, and other
[1:03:04.160 --> 1:03:07.880]  channels and say, you know, I'm real sad about this, but it's what the people are going
[1:03:07.880 --> 1:03:11.880]  to demand for security, that the next time we're hit by terrorists, we're going to have
[1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:15.960]  to have martial law and a military form of government in America, gee, I'm sorry that's
[1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:18.680]  going to happen, but that's all that'll keep us safe.
[1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:21.280]  You don't expect to come out and say martial law is good, military occupation is good,
[1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:25.040]  he says, gee, I'm sorry, it's not really our form of government, but it's all that'll
[1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:29.360]  keep you safe, you know, martial law is what'll keep you safe, it's what the people want.
[1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:33.840]  When it's not what the people want, martial law won't keep you safe, that's how they proposed
[1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:34.840]  it.
[1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:37.840]  And I said on air, we knew the Pentagon was spending tens of billions to buy reporters
[1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:42.920]  to have fake news, not just Armstrong Williams to push, you know, no child left behind, two
[1:03:42.920 --> 1:03:46.680]  hundred and forty something thousand a year ago out secretly and secretly being funded
[1:03:46.680 --> 1:03:47.680]  to push that.
[1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:52.400]  It was thousands of reporters and I said, I guarantee you, Franks is all over TV, he's
[1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:56.560]  getting money from the Pentagon slush fund to go say this and then it came out mainstream
[1:03:56.560 --> 1:04:02.240]  news that he was paid over $500,000 that year alone to go out and read that talking point
[1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:03.760]  on the news.
[1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:08.320]  Introducing that martial law keeps you safe, we've got to get rid of our form of government.
[1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:12.960]  Now the White House memos, I'm going through the evidence now, the John U. memos have been
[1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:17.080]  released and it says we're going to ban free speech, we're going to basically make Bush
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:20.000]  a dictator, this is mainstream headlines.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:24.480]  He went on to say, here's the headline, terror memos reveal total destruction of U.S. constitutional
[1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:25.480]  freedoms.
[1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:31.480]  It goes on to say that under PDD 51, just the cover sheet, it states that the president
[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:35.760]  is a dictator under any emergency, including economic, that the Congress can't review it.
[1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:39.920]  When Congress and the highest level committee on security, Homeland Security, asked to
[1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:43.640]  see the full document, they were told no national security.
[1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:47.480]  Now we have the John U. memos where they say the president is above all branches of government
[1:04:47.480 --> 1:04:53.400]  when supposedly legislative, executive, judicial or co-equal founders said that really the
[1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:57.880]  legislative was above the courts and the executive, the president.
[1:04:57.880 --> 1:05:03.800]  So all of that is going on, all of that is admitted, I've got scores of video clips here.
[1:05:03.800 --> 1:05:10.360]  One of them is titled 26,000 Pastors for Martial Law, Continuity of Government, and then it
[1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:14.880]  goes into Representative Peter Defazio on the Homeland Security Committee talking about
[1:05:14.880 --> 1:05:17.560]  how they were told they're not allowed to read it.
[1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:22.000]  They're co-equal with the president, but they can't see it.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:27.080]  And then we have other newscasts, years after we told you about the clergy response teams,
[1:05:27.080 --> 1:05:31.520]  how they had secretly hired 26,000 preachers, we got the secret FEMA documents to tell their
[1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:38.400]  flock to take implantable injections, go to FEMA camps, have their families broken up,
[1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:43.560]  people who couldn't believe it, now it's mainstream news, infregard, now 50,000 executives will
[1:05:43.560 --> 1:05:47.800]  shoot to kill orders who have been secretly FBI deputized, we're going to go over all
[1:05:47.800 --> 1:05:48.800]  of that.
[1:05:48.800 --> 1:05:53.000]  And a lot more coming up, Glenn Beck says he doesn't know if the camps are real, we'll
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:59.120]  have to be hiding, you know, under his bed not to know that, so we'll come back and go
[1:05:59.120 --> 1:06:00.720]  over all this.

[1:06:23.040 --> 1:06:24.400]  here in the U.S.
[1:06:24.400 --> 1:06:27.240]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.

[1:07:00.600 --> 1:07:06.280]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:07:06.280 --> 1:07:07.780]  against this country.
[1:07:07.780 --> 1:07:12.000]  The enemies struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  Bin Laden.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  This is his M.O.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:17.320]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:07:17.320 --> 1:07:21.760]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:07:21.760 --> 1:07:24.360]  networks inside the United States.
[1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:28.840]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[1:07:28.840 --> 1:07:31.000]  in and on the U.S.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:34.680]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:07:34.680 --> 1:07:40.160]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:44.320]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:45.320]  much more.
[1:07:45.320 --> 1:07:46.320]  Fabled Enemies.

[1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:04.040]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[1:08:04.040 --> 1:08:09.640]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:14.000]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  which are synthetic.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:16.680]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:20.400]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:24.840]  coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin,
[1:08:24.840 --> 1:08:25.840]  and mucous membranes.

[1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:04.520]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:10.720]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:11.720]  We are back live.
[1:09:11.720 --> 1:09:15.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to go over the evidence of FEMA camps to tell you exactly
[1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:19.640]  how they operate here right now, then I'm going to get into how the media, the corporate
[1:09:19.640 --> 1:09:24.640]  media, now that this can't be denied anymore, is trying to spin it.
[1:09:24.640 --> 1:09:33.240]  First off, Exhibit A, Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:36.640]  This is directly from the Army's own website.
[1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:43.000]  It's the top link, if you Google Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, you will be on
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:44.800]  the Army's own website.
[1:09:44.800 --> 1:09:47.080]  In 2002, I published my book Descent into Tyranny.
[1:09:47.080 --> 1:09:52.160]  I've been covering it since 97 when it was declassified, but I put it in my book Descent
[1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:53.840]  into Tyranny.
[1:09:53.840 --> 1:10:03.440]  The only other media outlet that I have seen that ever covered this was Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:07.560]  Human prisons coming soon to the U.S. Army base near you, little notice regulation allows
[1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:11.440]  construction of military installations to hold civilian U.S. citizens on them.
[1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:15.080]  Well, they've been in the camps since 86.
[1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:20.600]  It was not declassified till 1997.
[1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:25.520]  The regulation revises an earlier Civilian Inmate Labor Camp signed December 9, 97 under
[1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:26.520]  the Clinton administration.
[1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:28.200]  That's when they declassified it.
[1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:32.760]  So here is WorldNet Daily on that front.
[1:10:32.760 --> 1:10:43.280]  So it is Army regulation 210-35, Army regulation 210-35.
[1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:52.800]  Now in 1986, under Rex 84, they opened 12 secret Army camps to test if they could keep
[1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:54.800]  them secret while they held federal.
[1:10:54.800 --> 1:10:56.840]  Now they hold state prisoners as well.
[1:10:56.840 --> 1:10:59.920]  Federal prisoners would then be given a few years off their sentence if they agreed to
[1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:03.680]  not tell family about it and to go to the labor camps.
[1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:09.200]  It is a labor camp and under the revised military rules it allows any U.S. citizens to be put
[1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:11.320]  in under forced labor.
[1:11:11.320 --> 1:11:19.560]  Now this is only about, it's exactly 30 pages long.
[1:11:19.560 --> 1:11:24.880]  I suggest you Google, even if you're listening on AM and FM, shortwave satellite right now,
[1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:28.680]  just write notes, civilian inmate labor camp program even if you don't have a computer,
[1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:29.680]  go to the library.
[1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:30.860]  This is important.
[1:11:30.860 --> 1:11:37.440]  Write notes, go check all of this out for yourself, okay?
[1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:45.000]  Now that dovetails with the Houston Chronicle and other publications that reported first
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:52.440]  in January 7th in the Houston Chronicle 2006 that emergency FEMA camps were being built
[1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:55.720]  by a division of Halliburton, Kellogg Brown and Root.
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:12:00.440]  Write that note, Google it because Beck says he's been doing months of research and they've
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:01.440]  been having trouble finding it.
[1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:02.440]  He's doing research.
[1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:05.520]  He can't ever bring any facts and he makes little jokes about, oh, the government's going
[1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:06.520]  to get me here.
[1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:09.440]  Oh, I'm being censored on Fox and calls us conspiracy theorist.
[1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:13.200]  Okay, well here it is Beck and I know Lizard for years been sending you all this so don't
[1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:16.000]  act like you don't know.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.640]  Civilian inmate labor camp program.
[1:12:18.640 --> 1:12:23.040]  Now that dovetails with the new legislation introduced, the camps are already built, kind
[1:12:23.040 --> 1:12:28.360]  of like they already had the warrantless wiretapping for years and when they got caught they retroactively
[1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:30.040]  went and legalized it.
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:35.240]  The bill at these threat fusion centers, FEMA emergency centers in every county and
[1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:39.320]  city in the country, they're moving the National Guard in paying for free space for the police,
[1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:42.720]  fire department, emergency management under federal control.
[1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:46.400]  It says they're going to have the clergy response teams and community there to help the public
[1:12:46.400 --> 1:12:47.400]  as they go into the camp.
[1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:49.800]  Obama's going to build medical centers on these.
[1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:50.800]  They're going to advertise.
[1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:51.800]  It's fun to go to the camp.
[1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:54.840]  But Germany, they didn't say we're taking you to a slave camp, a forced labor camp and
[1:12:54.840 --> 1:12:55.840]  then a death camp.
[1:12:55.840 --> 1:13:01.920]  It was, oh, it's a place because you've lost your homes and you know, it's a refugee center.
[1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:05.160]  And they'll have little newscasts with rock bands there at night playing and then, you
[1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:06.760]  know, weekly movie they'll have at the camps.
[1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:07.760]  This is how it's been done.
[1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:10.000]  The Russians would do this in Eastern Europe when they take over.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:15.400]  It is the National Emergency Centers Act HR 645.
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:20.520]  National Emergency Centers Act HR 645, new legislation authorizes FEMA camps in the US.
[1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:22.760]  There's the bill number, gave it to you.
[1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:23.760]  In fact, we have this.
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:28.840]  We throw that up on screen for folks and I'll give you over 100 articles, but new legislation
[1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:30.120]  authorizes FEMA camps in the US.
[1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:31.120]  There you go.
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:32.120]  That integrates with this.
[1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:34.280]  Now, they doubled these from 12 camps that are listed.
[1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:37.360]  You can go to them with people on them.
[1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:39.960]  People on YouTube have gone and shot to the wire and shows prisoners at them.
[1:13:39.960 --> 1:13:42.400]  And we've shot video of children being held in them.
[1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:44.320]  It's in the end game.
[1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:45.320]  You can go.
[1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:50.480]  These are the 24 big ones, first 12 kept secret for 11 years from 86 to 97.
[1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:55.200]  It was declassified in 97 and now it's been radically expanded in 2005.
[1:13:55.200 --> 1:13:56.200]  Okay.
[1:13:56.200 --> 1:13:57.200]  There you have it right there.
[1:13:57.200 --> 1:13:59.640]  Absolute, total, complete proof.
[1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:02.200]  People working in them right now.
[1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:05.920]  Then we had the governor four years ago in Rhode Island.
[1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:10.920]  It was in the local news and the Providence Journal and the local NBC affiliate that they
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:14.400]  said, if you criticize the government, download music that was in the bill, hundreds of other
[1:14:14.400 --> 1:14:17.520]  things, life in prison as under treason.
[1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:21.400]  It was another bill almost passed in Oregon under Senator Menace.
[1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:26.480]  You can Google that Senator Menace FEMA camp bill and they said, downloading music, protesting
[1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:34.240]  life in prison in a forest labor camp.
[1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:38.120]  I mean, this is just off the charts, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:41.480]  And when the governor and others got confronted with this in Rhode Island, they said, well,
[1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:43.040]  the feds told us to pass this.
[1:14:43.040 --> 1:14:48.280]  So I just gave you the sources on that for everybody else that's out there.
[1:14:48.280 --> 1:14:52.560]  We told you Obama was going to set up a million-person domestic spy force because he announced
[1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:53.560]  they would.
[1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:55.320]  The Pentagon had written this up decades ago.
[1:14:55.320 --> 1:14:56.320]  Clinton had pushed it.
[1:14:56.320 --> 1:15:00.480]  Bush had pushed it under divisions of AmeriCorps called Secure Corp.
[1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:04.480]  There were Philadelphia Daily News articles about how they were training 15-year-olds
[1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:10.040]  with M16s in the public schools for warrant apprehension and during martial law.
[1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:12.400]  That's one source on that.
[1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:16.160]  Defense Department announces civilian expeditionary workforce.
[1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:21.240]  This is a Steve Watson info wars.net story, but it's all linked to the bills and mainstream
[1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:22.240]  news.
[1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:26.040]  Defense Department Directive 1404.10, again, write this down.
[1:15:26.040 --> 1:15:31.200]  Defense Department Directive 1404.10.
[1:15:31.200 --> 1:15:37.760]  And this is to establish a giant civilian military as big as the military, a million
[1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:42.560]  person, and it says that you will be deployed under draft.
[1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:47.040]  It says that it's compulsory, domestically and internationally overseas.
[1:15:47.040 --> 1:15:48.600]  So dual use.
[1:15:48.600 --> 1:15:52.240]  Defense Department announces civilian expeditionary workforce.
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:55.880]  And then we have links throughout the article to the Department of Defense announcements.
[1:15:55.880 --> 1:15:58.760]  Outside of Congress, they've just done this.
[1:15:58.760 --> 1:16:03.600]  Here's the Washington Post, Pentagon to detail troops to bolster domestic security.
[1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:07.120]  Military expects to have 20,000 uniformed troops on the streets of the United States.
[1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:13.280]  Also in the Army Times, they announced that for PR purposes, they would have military,
[1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:15.040]  army and Marines running checkpoints for DUIs.
[1:16:15.040 --> 1:16:16.640]  You're not for drunks, are you?
[1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:19.160]  This is how they conditioned you to accept it.
[1:16:19.160 --> 1:16:22.560]  That they would also have them with the jaws of life and it showed it on the Army.
[1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:25.640]  Own website, them helping cut people out of cars.
[1:16:25.640 --> 1:16:30.400]  Well, you're not against the military, fighting forest fires, cutting people out of cars,
[1:16:30.400 --> 1:16:31.840]  doing drug interdiction, doing anti-terror.
[1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:34.320]  See, that's just the cover story.
[1:16:34.320 --> 1:16:36.680]  Now the Army War College admits it's been all over the news.
[1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:41.400]  They're preparing to, quote, engage the American people and that their new mission under North
[1:16:41.400 --> 1:16:43.280]  Comm is suppressing the American people.
[1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:46.960]  They're teaching police that there's new white al-Qaeda and that Americans are about to rebel
[1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:47.960]  nationwide.
[1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:51.520]  That's mainstream news, that they're preparing to crush the American people.
[1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:55.800]  Pentagon to detail troops, zoom in on this camera, I'll use this as a close shot, some
[1:16:55.800 --> 1:17:00.160]  of these articles you don't have in the computer in there.
[1:17:00.160 --> 1:17:05.960]  Pentagon to detail troops to bolster domestic security.
[1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:12.320]  I'll remind you the Gonzales memos and you memos just got released where they said they
[1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:16.720]  were going to ban free speech in the United States, use troops on the streets of America
[1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:22.120]  and set up a dictatorship and that's being continued by Obama.
[1:17:22.120 --> 1:17:23.520]  There's the Sydney Morning Herald.
[1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:31.320]  Foundations are in place for martial law in the United States.
[1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:36.400]  British News is announcing that their government is preparing for martial law with the police
[1:17:36.400 --> 1:17:39.880]  and military against the British people.
[1:17:39.880 --> 1:17:42.960]  Sarkozy warns of social unrest because they've engineered it.
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:47.280]  In the IMF World Bank documents released in December of 2001, made widely public by the
[1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:52.320]  BBC in 2002, as Google IMF World Bank documents leaked.
[1:17:52.320 --> 1:17:56.480]  It said they institute riots, the first they collapse society, then there's rioting, then
[1:17:56.480 --> 1:17:58.520]  that's their excuse to bring in martial law.
[1:17:58.520 --> 1:18:03.760]  Then they basically repossess everything.
[1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:07.680]  And I could just go on and on and on.
[1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:08.680]  There's another story.
[1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:10.800]  U.S. troops asked if they would shoot at American citizens.
[1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:12.760]  Those are all public surveys they're being given.
[1:18:12.760 --> 1:18:16.520]  They're doing urban warfare drills for gun confiscation all over the country and admitting
[1:18:16.520 --> 1:18:19.960]  they're going door to door asking if they can search people's homes as part of a drill
[1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:21.800]  and blocking off the streets.
[1:18:21.800 --> 1:18:25.200]  Towns in Arkansas, Oklahoma, all over the country, this has been on CNN and they say
[1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:27.240]  it like it's a good thing when they report it.
[1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:30.400]  They're locking down the cities even during the daylight hours, searching everybody's
[1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:33.840]  cars, making you go through checkpoints and Google that.
[1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:38.600]  Towns declare martial law and they've been advised to do that by the feds.
[1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:43.840]  All of that is happening.
[1:18:43.840 --> 1:18:46.560]  But let's go back to the root of this.
[1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:50.280]  Let's go back to when they first set up this plan and they said they would use riots and
[1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:53.200]  the collapse society as the cover for that and that came out.
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:54.920]  That's just the cover.
[1:18:54.920 --> 1:19:00.200]  All over North in testimony before a joint session, a joint committee of Congress with
[1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:03.120]  Congressman Jack Brooks bringing it up and being told to shut up.
[1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:04.600]  You ready with that clip, guys?
[1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:07.720]  Okay, here is that clip for folks.
[1:19:07.720 --> 1:19:15.640]  Colonel North, in your work at the NSC, were you not assigned at one time to work on plans
[1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:19.360]  for the continuity of government in the event of a major disaster?
[1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:20.360]  Mr. Chairman?
[1:19:20.360 --> 1:19:30.000]  I believe that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:35.840]  So may I request that you not touch upon that, sir?
[1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:43.200]  I was particularly concerned, Mr. Chairman, because I read in Miami papers and several
[1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:53.840]  others that there had been a plan developed by that same agency, a contingency plan in
[1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:58.160]  the event of an emergency that would suspend the American Constitution, and I was deeply
[1:19:58.160 --> 1:19:59.160]  concerned about it.
[1:19:59.160 --> 1:20:02.320]  I'm wondering if that was the area in which he had worked?
[1:20:02.320 --> 1:20:03.320]  I'm more specifically...
[1:20:03.320 --> 1:20:10.840]  Well, I most respectfully request that that matter not be touched upon at this stage.
[1:20:10.840 --> 1:20:16.680]  We wish to get into this on certain arrangements can be made for an executive session.
[1:20:16.680 --> 1:20:21.840]  And tragically, the only member who got closed was Jack Brooks, and he was stopped by the
[1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:24.160]  chairman.
[1:20:24.160 --> 1:20:28.360]  And you can go watch Henry B. Gonzalez saying the government was going to use staged attacks,
[1:20:28.360 --> 1:20:30.240]  staged crises to bring in martial law.
[1:20:30.240 --> 1:20:32.960]  It got exposed, it was stopped.
[1:20:32.960 --> 1:20:36.480]  Every time we stop them from doing this, and they go, oh, look, it didn't exist, because
[1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:37.480]  we stopped it.
[1:20:37.480 --> 1:20:38.480]  You stopped it.
[1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:42.240]  Now, I'm going to come back, and I'm going to get into Glenn Beck saying none of this
[1:20:42.240 --> 1:20:43.240]  exists.
[1:20:43.240 --> 1:20:46.480]  And I have clip after clip after clip of Congress now.
[1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:50.520]  Congress threatened with martial law if they didn't pass the bank or takeover bill.
[1:20:50.520 --> 1:20:53.800]  Now 9.7 trillion stolen according to AP and Bloomberg.
[1:20:53.800 --> 1:20:55.760]  This is a banking hijacking.
[1:20:55.760 --> 1:20:57.600]  We have their own blueprints for it.
[1:20:57.600 --> 1:20:58.600]  Okay?
[1:20:58.600 --> 1:21:00.720]  This is the facts.
[1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:05.200]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and
[1:21:05.200 --> 1:21:08.880]  what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:13.520]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[1:21:13.520 --> 1:21:18.160]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:19.640]  It's a documented fact.
[1:21:19.640 --> 1:21:25.720]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and
[1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:27.200]  parasitic infection.
[1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:31.920]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and
[1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:37.680]  safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite
[1:21:37.680 --> 1:21:39.160]  beverage once a day.

[1:22:00.520 --> 1:22:02.520]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[1:22:02.520 --> 1:22:07.040]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[1:22:07.040 --> 1:22:08.560]  hour there is hope.
[1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:11.600]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:22:11.600 --> 1:22:15.840]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:17.360]  World Order master plan.
[1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:21.600]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[1:23:01.160 --> 1:23:06.640]  Ted Anderson from Midas Wednesday, March 4, 2009, Gold, 91980, Honseco Coins can be purchased
[1:23:06.640 --> 1:23:17.920]  for 946-3647318 for half, 236-59 for quarter, that's 949-3627318 and 236-59.
[1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:24.960]  On June 4, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the
[1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:29.240]  authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States
[1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:30.520]  government in interest.
[1:23:30.520 --> 1:23:34.080]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business. The November
[1:23:34.080 --> 1:23:38.120]  assassination quieted the production of the new currency, however the executive order
[1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:40.080]  still stands unrepealed.

[1:24:01.200 --> 1:24:07.440]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs? You are not alone. Millions
[1:24:07.440 --> 1:24:13.160]  of Americans suffer from restless legs. Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable
[1:24:13.160 --> 1:24:18.760]  urge to move your legs. Signs include itching, pulling, tugging and the feeling that bugs
[1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:23.600]  are crawling on your legs. If having restless legs is preventing you from getting the good
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:29.000]  night's sleep you deserve or is preventing you from enjoying life, you need Restulix.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:34.680]  Restulix is an all-natural supplement that contains 74 essential vitamins, minerals and

[1:25:10.080 --> 1:25:15.680]  Waging war on corruption. Thank you for joining us today.
[1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:20.320]  We're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the AM&F Mdial, Simulcastle
[1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:24.860]  Shortwave Satellite and always the web at infowars.com. We have the free podcast down
[1:25:24.860 --> 1:25:29.560]  on about more than 125,000 people a day for free at infowars.com and growing by about
[1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:32.960]  a few thousand a week.
[1:25:32.960 --> 1:25:40.720]  So if Glenn Beck wants to know if the FEMA camp is surreal or not, all he has to do is
[1:25:40.720 --> 1:25:45.960]  go to the Army War College, the Army.mil website, the Army Times and they say and it's been
[1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:49.400]  all over the Phoenix newspapers, the police say they're ready to work with the military
[1:25:49.400 --> 1:25:53.800]  against the people that their new mission is fighting the American people physically
[1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:58.440]  that they're acclimating us by having troops on the streets through PR at the checkpoints
[1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:02.640]  for DUIs against citizens, violating positive commentators, helping people get out of car
[1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:08.640]  wrecks. It's all PR and to condition the troops and police that it's okay. And more evidence,
[1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:12.360]  other exhibits are police state 2000, police state to the takeover, police state three
[1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:18.440]  total enslavement, all free on the web, films I made in the late nineties. And I went to
[1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:22.080]  urban warfare drills where the Marines and Army would hire role players who would scream
[1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:26.960]  I'm an American please no not the camp. They would do mock executions of American citizens.
[1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:34.040]  The Marines let us videotape mock interrogations of supposed U.S. citizens. They would set
[1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:36.680]  them down and say where are you from? I'm from San Francisco. Where'd you get the helmet?
[1:26:36.680 --> 1:26:42.080]  Where'd you get the weapons? So this is why I've been raising the alarm because they have
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:45.960]  been gearing up for this and telling the locals it was for training overseas and they do this
[1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:51.760]  over and over and over and over again. And for folks watching the simulcast at prison
[1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:56.960]  planet.tv we're showing video of the Marines. We're going to show you a mock FEMA camp.
[1:26:56.960 --> 1:27:02.240]  They also had foreign troops there assisting. We have video of a cooperative nugget in the
[1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:06.760]  mid 1990s where foreign troops admittedly were training in the U.S. to put Americans
[1:27:06.760 --> 1:27:14.000]  in camps. That is the camp right there you see on your screen. So it's all there for
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:18.840]  anybody that wants to know the truth. Now remember under PDD 51 signed a few years ago
[1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:24.840]  by Bush that Obama's expanded and continued. They state that Congress has no authority
[1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:28.680]  during emergencies and the president's basically absolute dictator when Congress wanted to see
[1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:33.760]  the detailed documents. They were told you're not allowed to international security when
[1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:37.400]  Congress is co-equal to the president. That is dictatorship. Let's go ahead and play the
[1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:41.320]  clip 26,000 pastors for martial law continuity of government because the first half of the
[1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:44.240]  clip is a newscast on that. We're not going to play that later. We're going to play right
[1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:49.040]  now Representative Peter DeFazio, Democrat Oregon and then later the chairman himself
[1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:53.200]  asked for the documents was told no. So the Congress can't be trusted to be part of this
[1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:56.680]  with the foreign troops. They can know all about PDD 51. Here it is.
[1:27:56.680 --> 1:28:00.680]  In fact the balance of this time for what purpose does the gentleman from Oregon rise?
[1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:01.680]  That's not the one.
[1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:06.680]  That objective.
[1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:11.920]  Most Americans would agree that it would be prudent to have a plan to provide for the
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:17.120]  continuity of government and the rule of law in case of a devastating terrorist attack
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:22.320]  or natural disaster plan that provides for the cooperation, the coordination and continued
[1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:26.640]  functioning of all three branches of the government. The Bush administration tells
[1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:32.480]  us they have such a plan and introduced a little sketchy public version that's clearly
[1:28:32.480 --> 1:28:38.280]  inadequate and doesn't really tell us what they have in mind. But they said don't worry
[1:28:38.280 --> 1:28:44.680]  there's a detailed classified version. But now they've denied the entire Homeland Security
[1:28:44.680 --> 1:28:51.760]  Committee of the United States House of Representatives access to their so-called detailed plan to
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:57.560]  provide for continuity of government. They say trust us. Trust us. The people who brought
[1:28:57.560 --> 1:29:04.400]  us Katrina to be competent in face of a disaster. Trust us. The people who brought us warrantless
[1:29:04.400 --> 1:29:11.600]  wiretapping and other excesses eroding our civil liberties. Trust us. Maybe the plan
[1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:16.800]  just really doesn't exist and that's why they won't show it to us. I don't know. Or maybe
[1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:22.800]  there's something there that's outrageous. The American people need their elected representatives
[1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:26.800]  to review this plan for the continuity of government.
[1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:34.360]  All right. Now when we come back, I'm going to play a clip and we have Senator Inhofe.
[1:29:34.360 --> 1:29:38.120]  We have Congressman Brad Sherman and others that we interviewed here on air or we played
[1:29:38.120 --> 1:29:42.840]  clip sub on air, both from Congress and here, where they were told martial law will be declared
[1:29:42.840 --> 1:29:49.520]  if you don't pass the banker bailout unread on October 3rd, 2008. And then they bait and
[1:29:49.520 --> 1:29:52.400]  switched and said it was going to be for the subprime mortgages. And then they said, we're
[1:29:52.400 --> 1:29:55.600]  not going to tell you and it wasn't 700 billion. They just picked a really big number. That's
[1:29:55.600 --> 1:30:01.440]  a quote. And it's now 9.7 trillion, five and a half months into this. Do the math. October,
[1:30:01.440 --> 1:30:08.200]  November, December, January, February, five months, five months and change into this.
[1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:14.840]  9.7 trillion to offshore banks. These are a bunch of benard made off scam artists that
[1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:18.480]  created all this fiat currency to buy the world. And now they're saying a new world
[1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:22.880]  bank, bank of the world all over the news will save us and we'll pay carbon taxes to
[1:30:22.880 --> 1:30:26.720]  them on everything, every facet of our lives. So see now the media is forced for all these
[1:30:26.720 --> 1:30:30.880]  years of saying there's no new world order to admit there is. But Glenn Beck says, well,
[1:30:30.880 --> 1:30:35.600]  they might be building camps, but he makes joke about conspiracy theories and then says,
[1:30:35.600 --> 1:30:40.840]  you know, maybe they're needed. Maybe they're needed. So that's coming up. This is the supposed
[1:30:40.840 --> 1:30:47.280]  champion exposing all of this. It's just, just incredible. All right, we'll be right
[1:30:47.280 --> 1:30:51.480]  back. Stay with us.
[1:30:51.480 --> 1:30:59.040]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:59.040 --> 1:31:05.200]  Hello, this is Steve Shank. Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food, but
[1:31:05.200 --> 1:31:09.280]  Alex and I decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[1:31:09.280 --> 1:31:13.760]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods direct. If you agree with
[1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:19.360]  one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the earth is
[1:31:19.360 --> 1:31:23.640]  cooling, don't call eFoods direct. If you think growing food for cars is better than
[1:31:23.640 --> 1:31:27.680]  feeding people, don't get food. If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime
[1:31:27.680 --> 1:31:31.960]  is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods direct. If you
[1:31:31.960 --> 1:31:36.600]  believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food. If you think the warnings on the
[1:31:36.600 --> 1:31:42.560]  Alex Jones show are foolish, don't call eFoods direct. For the rest of you, go to eFoodsDirect.com

[1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:06.360]  Today unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:32:06.360 --> 1:32:11.760]  against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:32:11.760 --> 1:32:16.160]  Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama
[1:32:16.160 --> 1:32:20.840]  Bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[1:32:20.840 --> 1:32:25.800]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that
[1:32:25.800 --> 1:32:32.080]  they're Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that
[1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:37.360]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers'
[1:32:37.360 --> 1:32:42.080]  ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings
[1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:47.160]  in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at

[1:34:00.440 --> 1:34:11.720]  Alright, let's cut right back into the news. Continue with all the FEMA camp evidence.
[1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:16.720]  We really got concerned in the mid to late 90s when the FBI training manuals went public.
[1:34:16.720 --> 1:34:20.240]  Flyers distributed to every major city department, small city departments. They put federally
[1:34:20.240 --> 1:34:27.160]  paid for anti-terror, anti-extremist police, and even small departments as few as 10 officers
[1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:31.940]  to become spying on the American people. We got video from firefighters and police from
[1:34:31.940 --> 1:34:35.520]  FEMA training seminars where they badmouthed the Second Amendment, the founding fathers.
[1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:39.640]  That's in my film, The Road to Terrany, free on Google and YouTube. Here's just one of
[1:34:39.640 --> 1:34:45.080]  the flyers. Call a member of the Phoenix FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, investigator
[1:34:45.080 --> 1:34:50.720]  Al Shearer, Maricopa County's office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and when you read
[1:34:50.720 --> 1:34:57.360]  the back of the flyer, just Google FBI Flyer, Constitutional Terrorist, you can then go
[1:34:57.360 --> 1:35:01.360]  read it and call the phone numbers on it and talk to the FBI if you'd like. I'll give
[1:35:01.360 --> 1:35:04.400]  me a close shot. I want to show folks the cover of the flyer. When you read in there,
[1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:09.200]  it says, Constitutional Terrorist, people that make frequent references to the U.S. Constitution,
[1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:12.520]  well, let's say they believe in the Second Amendment, are terrorists and need to be put
[1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:17.800]  in terrorism databases. Now, people thought this ended with Clinton and expanded covertly
[1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:27.360]  under Bush, so there is just one of the many flyers and pieces of material on that continuing.
[1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:31.760]  Let's go ahead and play Congressman Brad Sherman, who we also interviewed here on the show.
[1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:35.220]  They were threatened with martial law. He wouldn't say on the show because of House
[1:35:35.220 --> 1:35:39.720]  Rules and in close committee. Who threatened them? Later, Senator Inhofe went public from
[1:35:39.720 --> 1:35:44.560]  Oklahoma and said it was Ben Bernanke, head of the private Federal Reserve and the head
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:48.760]  of the Treasury, Paulson at the time. This is all just expanded under Obama, hasn't gone
[1:35:48.760 --> 1:35:55.200]  away. Let's go ahead and play this clip from Ohio. The only way they can pass this bill
[1:35:55.200 --> 1:36:02.880]  is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere. That atmosphere is not justified. Many of
[1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:10.000]  us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday that
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:14.360]  the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day,
[1:36:14.360 --> 1:36:19.320]  another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would
[1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:27.400]  be martial law in America if we voted no. That's what I call fear mongering, unjustified,
[1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:32.760]  proven wrong. We've got a week, we've got two weeks to write a good bill. The only
[1:36:32.760 --> 1:36:37.640]  way to write to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on. All right, now what has
[1:36:37.640 --> 1:36:42.040]  the Senate done to... All right, now I've gone through about 20 exhibits. There are
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:50.440]  over 100 exhibits and this week or next week I'm going to do two hours with no calls going
[1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:55.560]  through the exhibits. I'm going to pull all my research, all the bills, all the legislation,
[1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:59.840]  the whole history of the camps, mainstream media clips admitting it, but trying to sell
[1:36:59.840 --> 1:37:04.880]  it to the public and we're going to do a full, you know, half of the show, at least two hours
[1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:12.040]  on this subject uninterrupted with guest or calls. I want to challenge folks that after
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:15.040]  they watch this at PrisonPlanet.tv and it gets ripped to the web everywhere, which we
[1:37:15.040 --> 1:37:20.200]  appreciate, if you're watching this in a later part, be sure and watch the first few parts
[1:37:20.200 --> 1:37:24.440]  of the video. I imagine this would be four or five parts because you need to see the
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:29.240]  background, the proof I went over of the camps all admitted publicly for the American people,
[1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:33.600]  unconfiscation, forced inoculation, buying off city leaders, corporate leaders under
[1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:37.240]  InfraGuard, the clergy response teams, all these terms I'm using Google, you'll have
[1:37:37.240 --> 1:37:42.240]  mainstream news, but always telling you how good it is, so that when I get into Glenn
[1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:47.280]  Beck here briefly, you understand because Glenn Beck over and over again on his radio
[1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:51.080]  show says basically arrest 9-11 truthers, send us to secret camps. It was a talking
[1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:57.960]  point on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, use the Army against Ron Paul supporters because they're
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:03.400]  domestic threats, Sean Hannity saying arrest all militia members, every child needs a chip.
[1:38:03.400 --> 1:38:07.040]  I mean these guys push a lot of sick stuff and then back suddenly when it's all announcers
[1:38:07.040 --> 1:38:10.600]  of world government comes out and acts like he's fighting it, but then we'll mix into
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:14.280]  it. We've got to, you know, Russia's a threat, Iran's a threat, you know, we've got to do
[1:38:14.280 --> 1:38:18.400]  this, so I'm worried about the Bubbas and their guns, maybe we need FEMA camps. I don't
[1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:23.000]  know if FEMA camps exist, maybe they do. You know, I was going to cover it, but now I'm
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:27.200]  not because I'm still researching. Oh, I guess Fox is censoring me, you know, conspiracy
[1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:31.360]  theories, making a joke out of that when it's on record that all the major media is on government
[1:38:31.360 --> 1:38:35.400]  payroll and talking points. In fact, pull up some of the articles. I had you guys pull
[1:38:35.400 --> 1:38:40.040]  up some of the headlines. You just Google Pentagon paying for fake news in U.S., White
[1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:44.720]  House paying for fake news in U.S. It's now in the tens of billions every year. But when
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:48.480]  it came out, they just used one Armstrong-Williams case and one at the New York Times where somebody
[1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:55.840]  was being paid off to lie about aluminum tubes. This is what's going on. So there's an info
[1:38:55.840 --> 1:38:59.960]  wars.net story. But if you notice, I point you to our articles because when you go to
[1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:04.560]  Pentagon, Expand Propaganda Reach with foreign news websites, which they then admit are being
[1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:08.600]  pushed domestically, and then you can go to USA Today, you see a link there, you can go
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:13.360]  to the other mainstream news articles, all those, see all those blue hyperlinks, you're
[1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:17.160]  watching on prisonplanet.tv, you can go to that story, link to all of those. I've had
[1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:21.840]  Congress people on, talking about how it's illegal, the fake news, the fake news reports
[1:39:21.840 --> 1:39:26.200]  they produced and put on radio and TV that were made by the government. All of this is
[1:39:26.200 --> 1:39:33.040]  being done. Fake polls, everything. So his joke about that is asinine. Let's go ahead.
[1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:36.120]  We've done an audio boil down and we're going to play a few video clips. Again, when I do
[1:39:36.120 --> 1:39:39.520]  a full report on this, we'll get into more details as we analyze this propaganda. Here's
[1:39:39.520 --> 1:39:44.520]  Glenn Beck on several shows, his own Fox and Friends and others. Then we cut back to him,
[1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:48.480]  demonizing Ron Paul supporters and equating us with Timothy McVeigh. This is our champion.
[1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:55.480]  This is our friend that's waking up on Fox News, injecting all this Iran's got nuke propaganda
[1:39:55.480 --> 1:39:59.840]  in the middle of it. Same propaganda we heard under Bush. Here it is.
[1:39:59.840 --> 1:40:04.920]  I told you that I was going to tell you about the FEMA camps or the FEMA prisons today.
[1:40:04.920 --> 1:40:08.040]  This is something that I snapped on the air because somebody called me up and said, do
[1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:12.600]  you, why don't you talk about the FEMA prisons? And I said, can we just settle the FEMA prison
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:18.800]  thing? I don't believe in the FEMA prison. If these things exist, that's bad. And if
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:24.320]  they don't exist, it's irresponsible to not debunk this story. We have an independent
[1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:29.240]  group on this program looking into it, turning over every stone. I am going to bring you
[1:40:29.240 --> 1:40:34.920]  this story. This program is not beholden. This is going to drive the conspiracy theorists
[1:40:34.920 --> 1:40:41.120]  left. Crazy. Let me out of this. They're making me say this. Help. This program is not beholden
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:45.560]  to anybody. Stop right there. He says he's going to cover FEMA camps. And then he makes
[1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:51.240]  a joke about they're making me, you know, not say this help. So he's, he's discrediting
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:57.760]  it right there. Let's continue with the club ourselves. I answer to me. I lost sleep last
[1:40:57.760 --> 1:41:01.240]  night worrying about this story, thinking about this story and wanted to make sure that
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:06.880]  I got it right. The only thing that I answered to is myself. And I just want to be able to
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:12.880]  look at myself in the mirror and also sleep at night. Sleep, sleep, sleep. And I want
[1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:16.840]  to make it very clear. I'm not fearing these things are happening. I want to set the record
[1:41:16.840 --> 1:41:22.480]  straight because we've got to know what we can believe in. I wanted to debunk these FEMA
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:26.880]  camps. I'm tired of hearing. You know about them. I'm tired of hearing. I wanted to debunk
[1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:32.240]  them. Well, we've now for several days done research on them. I can't debunk them. It
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:38.440]  is our government. If you trust our government, it's fine. If you have any kind of fear that
[1:41:38.440 --> 1:41:43.080]  we might be headed towards a totalitarian state, look out, buckle up. There's something
[1:41:43.080 --> 1:41:49.720]  going on in our country that is ain't good. Joining me now is Congressman Ron Paul. First
[1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:53.320]  of all, I'm on the FEMA prison thing. I know we've been in contact with your office and
[1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:56.440]  we would appreciate any help that you have. I want to make sure we're turning over every
[1:41:56.440 --> 1:42:01.240]  stone. There's a lot of crazy stuff that is being said about these things. And I appreciate
[1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:05.320]  you talking to us and we'll be in touch with you again because I want to make sure that
[1:42:05.320 --> 1:42:11.520]  we have everything that you might be concerned with as well.
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:18.000]  Ron Paul's supporters are tapping in to something that's very real, the rising tide of disenfranchisement
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:23.920]  in this country. If fringe elements take that disenfranchisement and turn it into violence,
[1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:29.280]  we endanger the freedoms we're supposedly all fighting for. You're going after everybody
[1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:34.200]  and here's the thing, at one point with security so high and tensions on edge, don't you think
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:38.920]  they're going to get at the very least tased or beaten to a pulp by somebody who goes,
[1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:42.720]  these people look threatening? They don't look threatening? The Ron Paul revolution.
[1:42:42.720 --> 1:42:46.840]  I think it's meant to be a catchy slogan, but I fear some of his fringe supporters are
[1:42:46.840 --> 1:42:51.400]  taking the word revolution too literally. These truthers are exactly the kind of people
[1:42:51.400 --> 1:42:56.120]  who want to rock this nation's foundation, tear us apart and plant seeds of dissatisfaction
[1:42:56.120 --> 1:43:01.720]  in all of us. These guys are dangerous. I believe these guys are anarchists that are
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:07.760]  looking to tear us apart. I mean, this is the kind of group that a Timothy McVeigh would
[1:43:07.760 --> 1:43:11.760]  come from.
[1:43:11.760 --> 1:43:17.160]  And folks, it goes on and on. This is our little friend that he hates the 9-11 families
[1:43:17.160 --> 1:43:22.480]  that say it's an inside job, that he hates 9-11 truthers and it was a talking point where
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:27.200]  oh, the 9-11 truthers are going to bomb us. They work for Al Qaeda on all these news channels,
[1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:32.240]  a talking point. Now, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, every major publication,
[1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:36.200]  you name it, they've done it. Just type New World Order and pick the name of your newspaper,
[1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:40.960]  add it at the end, you'll see articles on Google. I mean, I've done this test, everyone,
[1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:46.560]  everywhere. But they're saying it's good. All these years saying it didn't exist. All
[1:43:46.560 --> 1:43:49.680]  these years saying that we were liars and crazy and we had all the documents in the
[1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:57.600]  video clips. Now they admit it's happening, but say it's going to save us. You see, they
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:03.680]  have to get you to trust them. So if you watch Glenn Beck, not even closely, it's completely
[1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:07.640]  obvious every night, he'll go, yeah, New World Order, Global Bankers, oh, it's horrible.
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:11.800]  And then he'll build the fear up and then say, flip it. By the way, Putin's wanting
[1:44:11.800 --> 1:44:16.240]  to attack us and so has Iran. And we've got to go after these guys right now. The terrorists
[1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:19.080]  are about to hit us. And I'm worried about the bubble factor. I'm worried about these
[1:44:19.080 --> 1:44:22.800]  gun owners, but I'm worried about the government too. What do I do? I mean, if you trust the
[1:44:22.800 --> 1:44:26.000]  government, the camps aren't a problem. But if you don't trust them and it's meant to
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  create fear, it's a chilling effect to everybody out there that knows what's going on. Oh my
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:33.200]  God, they're admitting camps. So we shut up. And then so the couch potatoes make the psychological
[1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:37.480]  decision to go, oh, well, I'm scared of Putin. There's nothing to do with it, but I'm scared
[1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:41.280]  of Putin. So I guess I'm for these camps and see the other rolling them out in the news.
[1:44:41.280 --> 1:44:45.360]  The camps will be for you when you're starving during the collapse of society, which is what
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:47.920]  the IMF and World Bank have done to countless third world countries in their own documents
[1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:52.560]  and say they want to do it here. That to fully bankrupt you so they can consolidate everything
[1:44:52.560 --> 1:44:58.200]  with the tens of trillions of fiat currency they're holding and hoarding of taxpayer money.
[1:44:58.200 --> 1:45:01.280]  And then once the riots start, which they're trying to push, you know, they have a Zignabraszinski
[1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:04.880]  on MSNBC. We played that the other day saying, I'm really worried about these bankers. They're
[1:45:04.880 --> 1:45:10.160]  going to cause riots nationwide as if he isn't one of the engineers of it. See, they know
[1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:13.920]  they've got revolution on their hands. They know that we did our job warning the people
[1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:18.440]  and exposing what was happening and putting all this information out and people found
[1:45:18.440 --> 1:45:26.520]  out it was true. So recapping, the Department of Defense in the Washington Post has announced
[1:45:26.520 --> 1:45:29.800]  they are putting regular troops on the streets to engage the American people. The Army War
[1:45:29.800 --> 1:45:35.360]  College admits this. They secretly have had Americans in camps since 1986. It was declassified
[1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:40.000]  in 97. Sounds incredible. You can read it all right here in the civilian inmate labor camp
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:45.600]  program. Just Google that. You'll be an Army.mil. They've introduced legislation for a million
[1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:53.600]  person domestic security force. We went over that area of the Army code that they have
[1:45:53.600 --> 1:46:00.760]  now announced and issued. They have also introduced the National Emergency Centers Act, HR 645,
[1:46:00.760 --> 1:46:05.440]  to build these FEMA camps and integrate them with local police and military. They are federalizing
[1:46:05.440 --> 1:46:12.640]  the National Guard under Northcom completely. That is the type of news and information we
[1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:16.240]  have. We played you congressmen telling you that they are not allowed to see the martial
[1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:20.160]  law plans but that they're there. We have the cover sheet, PDD 51. We played you the
[1:46:20.160 --> 1:46:24.040]  congressmen saying they've been threatened with martial law. Whatever they're told by
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:27.960]  the White House. We played you the clips and have these congressmen and people here on
[1:46:27.960 --> 1:46:34.360]  the show. We've shown you house hearings about the secret camps and congressmen being told
[1:46:34.360 --> 1:46:39.520]  to shut up. You can't talk about the camps. We've shown you the FBI terror flyer. Now
[1:46:39.520 --> 1:46:45.920]  I told you guys just on the fly to Google Kansas City. FEMA in Kansas City says founding
[1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:52.200]  fathers terrorist. Were you able to find that? Here it is. This is from my film, The Road
[1:46:52.200 --> 1:46:57.800]  to Terrany. I don't know how this from web video. I have the high quality DVDs here.
[1:46:57.800 --> 1:47:02.600]  People can get it in a combo pack. A three pack of three films are in one in higher quality
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:05.800]  but here it is from YouTube. I want to show you this. You can find it now for free and
[1:47:05.800 --> 1:47:10.320]  get it. 9-1-1 The Road to Terrany. Founding fathers were terrorist. And it goes, I mean
[1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:13.840]  I have 18 hours of this. I have them training all over the country. I have them teaching
[1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:17.440]  police to arrest anybody with a get us out of the UN sticker. This is what's been going
[1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:18.440]  on. Here it is.
[1:47:18.440 --> 1:47:43.000]  Now why is that important to understand because they are committed to their cause and to their
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:54.200]  way of life and you are yours. And they see you as being wrong. That's very different.
[1:47:54.200 --> 1:47:58.480]  When people are passionate about what they believe in, they become a very difficult enemy
[1:47:58.480 --> 1:48:07.480]  to defeat. Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States? Who? Founding fathers.
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:13.760]  Do you mean Thomas Jefferson? Back it up. Stop it right there. Stop it right there. You notice
[1:48:13.760 --> 1:48:17.240]  what Glenn Beck kept saying. All these crazy stuff about FEMA camps. Who they are going
[1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:22.480]  to get me. Making jokes. Look at this guy. He is talking about the founding fathers and
[1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:26.120]  people that are committed. He is talking about constitutional terrorists. Before that we have
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:30.080]  the FBI training manuals and flyers. They give police. We just showed you. The cops
[1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:33.680]  are so conditioned. They say who are the terrorists? Who are the first terrorists? The founding
[1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:36.640]  fathers. They all know. They all say founding fathers. They have already been taught this
[1:48:36.640 --> 1:48:44.720]  many times. And then he says this is a very difficult enemy to beat. No, you are the enemy
[1:48:44.720 --> 1:48:47.960]  when you become an enemy of the Bill of Rights of Constitution. Let foreign bankers take
[1:48:47.960 --> 1:48:49.360]  us over. Play it again.
[1:48:49.360 --> 1:49:10.760]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States? Who? Founding fathers.
[1:49:10.760 --> 1:49:21.680]  Did they try to intimidate the British? Did they use acts of violence? Your founding fathers,
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:25.880]  my founding fathers, were involved in acts of terrorism against British officials because
[1:49:25.880 --> 1:49:33.680]  they systematically had British officials assassinate. Assassinate. The guys who we call
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:38.200]  our founding fathers, George Washington, Mr. Arnold, who cut down a carry tree and admitted
[1:49:38.200 --> 1:49:43.920]  is the same guy who signed death orders, if you will, on members of the British government,
[1:49:43.920 --> 1:49:48.720]  the British crown, who they wanted to eliminate because politically they had influence in
[1:49:48.720 --> 1:49:54.080]  certain pockets of the United States at that time in 13 colonies and they wanted to divide
[1:49:54.080 --> 1:49:58.760]  and conquer. They may get a whole lot of civilians. And hey, I'm going to be honest with you,
[1:49:58.760 --> 1:50:05.760]  okay? If they killed 10,000 civilians tomorrow with a biological agent, that's too bad for
[1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:06.760]  them.
[1:50:06.760 --> 1:50:12.640]  Yeah, so what if they killed 10,000 civilians? You know how these patriots are. They're always
[1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:13.640]  killing civilians.
[1:50:13.640 --> 1:50:23.040]  That's enough. That's from my film. Now, see how he talks about how they assassinated.
[1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:26.480]  They were bad. They wanted to divide and conquer. The founders wanted to divide and conquer.
[1:50:26.480 --> 1:50:30.560]  They were terrorists. And then you read the manuals. It says those that make frequent
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:37.680]  references to the U.S. Constitution are terrorists. Gun owners are terrorists. This is why the
[1:50:37.680 --> 1:50:41.160]  police are so brainwashed. And in this film, I then had the police from their own squad
[1:50:41.160 --> 1:50:46.720]  cars pulling over a woman at a warrantless checkpoint, searching papers in Virginia to
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:50.880]  enable veteran, no criminal record, Abbey Newman, married buying canning supplies in town. And
[1:50:50.880 --> 1:50:55.040]  they want to search her car and she says, no, they pull her out, slam her against the car,
[1:50:55.040 --> 1:50:58.400]  charge her with assaulting him. She doesn't touch him. And then they dig out a pocket
[1:50:58.400 --> 1:51:02.360]  of the Constitution in one of my videos and they start getting scared going, she's one
[1:51:02.360 --> 1:51:06.160]  of them. She's one of the extremists. She's one of the terrorists. I can't believe we
[1:51:06.160 --> 1:51:11.440]  actually found one of them. It's squad car video. Then with their microphones outside
[1:51:11.440 --> 1:51:18.480]  the car, freaking out. Freaking. I mean, police now pull you over with a Patriot sticker.
[1:51:18.480 --> 1:51:22.080]  They just go ahead and tase her in many cases because they're so scared to death. Now the
[1:51:22.080 --> 1:51:25.960]  real terrorists are the people teaching the police that our founding fathers were bad.
[1:51:25.960 --> 1:51:29.760]  Now folks, I can go on for hour after hour and I am sometime this week or next week. I'm
[1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:36.000]  going to do two hours where we're just going to go through it all. This is not 10% of the
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  evidence I've got. Bob Chapman is going to join us for about 10, 15 minutes with a quick
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:43.840]  economic update with the plunging stock market and what's happening then for about an hour
[1:51:43.840 --> 1:51:47.280]  and a half. We've got Lindsey Williams coming back on with his powerful inside knowledge
[1:51:47.280 --> 1:51:51.560]  from former Atlantic Richfield executive about what's happening with this global operation
[1:51:51.560 --> 1:51:56.320]  plunging the oil prices to accentuate and accelerate the global depression. All this

[1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:06.720]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero
[1:53:06.720 --> 1:53:10.280]  and we knew what to do. Or at least we thought we did.
[1:53:10.280 --> 1:53:15.560]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:53:15.560 --> 1:53:24.520]  to tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air
[1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:29.800]  was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls
[1:53:29.800 --> 1:53:34.840]  throughout the world take action against their global masters. He had his hand over the radio
[1:53:34.840 --> 1:53:39.400]  while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was
[1:53:39.400 --> 1:53:46.760]  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising
[1:53:46.760 --> 1:53:54.200]  at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:53:54.200 --> 1:53:57.880]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[1:53:57.880 --> 1:54:26.360]  and bring in martial law.
[1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:51.800]  What, then, then, then, then, then, then.

[1:54:57.520 --> 1:54:59.540]  Survivalistseeds.com.
[1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:05.480]  Okay, until about 15 after next hour,
[1:55:05.480 --> 1:55:07.840]  we're gonna have Bob Chapman with us at internationalforecaster.com.
[1:55:07.840 --> 1:55:10.680]  My websites are infowars.com and prisonquana.com.
[1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:15.080]  In summation, the establishment knows everybody's waking up
[1:55:15.080 --> 1:55:17.400]  at the camps, that everything is exploding,
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:19.120]  our web numbers alone are doubling.
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:22.480]  This is the Buzz Worldwide.
[1:55:22.480 --> 1:55:24.760]  I'm on British radio and they say I saw a huge yellow truck
[1:55:24.760 --> 1:55:26.520]  with infowars.com driving around today.
[1:55:26.520 --> 1:55:27.680]  Is that you paying for that?
[1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:30.240]  No, the people worldwide are waking up
[1:55:30.240 --> 1:55:33.440]  because we warned them beforehand everything we said came true.
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:36.920]  So the establishment comes out and mixes some truth
[1:55:36.920 --> 1:55:39.200]  about FEMA camps and things, but then makes jokes about it.
[1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:41.400]  Mixing it in with patriots and gun owners are dangerous.
[1:55:41.400 --> 1:55:43.480]  He's currently doing that.
[1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:45.560]  And the people get, some of them get fooled by that.
[1:55:45.560 --> 1:55:46.680]  I challenge Glenn Beck.
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:48.880]  You claim you've been doing research for weeks on this
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:49.720]  and you can't sleep.
[1:55:49.720 --> 1:55:51.920]  Okay, buddy, everybody's gonna email you.
[1:55:52.920 --> 1:55:55.320]  You're ready to show and Fox News,
[1:55:55.320 --> 1:55:58.680]  the last 45 minute piece we've done.
[1:55:58.680 --> 1:56:00.360]  Your little staffers can watch that
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:02.680]  and everything there can be Google pulled up
[1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:05.320]  from government documents at the army.mil
[1:56:05.320 --> 1:56:06.760]  and FBI and everywhere else.
[1:56:06.760 --> 1:56:08.920]  And then you'll have a clear picture of what's being set up
[1:56:08.920 --> 1:56:10.920]  and how they now have orchestrated economic collapse
[1:56:10.920 --> 1:56:13.480]  to get us to accept this as society breaks down.
[1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:17.920]  And my film, The Obama Deception covers all of this.
[1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:20.240]  It's now available at infowars.com.
[1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:21.800]  And it shatters the left-right paradigm.
[1:56:21.800 --> 1:56:24.040]  President to president, it just continues.
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:25.240]  But that's the bottom line.
[1:56:25.240 --> 1:56:26.480]  I want to see all this.
[1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:28.720]  I want to see the civilian inmate labor camp program.
[1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:30.600]  I want to see the fact that the armies announced
[1:56:30.600 --> 1:56:32.760]  they're gonna engage the American people in the Northcom
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:34.800]  already has the country under effective martial law
[1:56:34.800 --> 1:56:36.520]  and that Congress has been threatened with martial law.
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:38.240]  That is martial law.
[1:56:38.240 --> 1:56:40.400]  I want to hear that, Bubba, all together
[1:56:40.400 --> 1:56:43.960]  until you making jokes and saying, oh, conspiracy theory.
[1:56:43.960 --> 1:56:44.920]  That's what we want to hear.
[1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:47.560]  This is happening because we're winning, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:49.360]  They're being forced to cover all this.
[1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:51.360]  Bob Chapman, formerly with Army Intelligence,
[1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:53.960]  then the largest financial newsletter on record
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:56:55.400]  until he retired, he's come back.
[1:56:55.400 --> 1:56:58.520]  And he also the largest gold and private silver broker.
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:00.720]  Bob Chapman, also, of course, great patriot,
[1:57:00.720 --> 1:57:02.600]  helped fund and finance the publishing
[1:57:02.600 --> 1:57:05.400]  of Nundair Call Conspiracy with Gary Allen back in the 70s.
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:06.760]  He's been working with Jebra Griffin and others
[1:57:06.760 --> 1:57:07.920]  for more than 40 years.
[1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:09.600]  Good to have you here with us.
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:10.920]  I want to come back for 15 minutes
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:12.400]  and cover the latest financial developments.
[1:57:12.400 --> 1:57:14.560]  But in a few minutes, sir, I know you've been
[1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:17.320]  on whole listening, your take on the fact
[1:57:17.320 --> 1:57:18.920]  that they're now admitting world government,
[1:57:18.920 --> 1:57:20.280]  push it, but saying it's going to save us
[1:57:20.280 --> 1:57:21.840]  and then vexing, yeah, there's some camps.
[1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:23.840]  Maybe they're good, maybe they're bad,
[1:57:23.840 --> 1:57:25.560]  but then giving no more information.
[1:57:25.560 --> 1:57:26.400]  Bob Chapman.
[1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:30.240]  Well, first of all, I think they've been exposed.
[1:57:31.160 --> 1:57:34.360]  You know, these broadcasts are going all over the world.
[1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:35.960]  There are only a handful of people,
[1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:39.160]  but they're making a tremendous difference.
[1:57:39.160 --> 1:57:41.440]  We're getting emails from all over the world
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:44.080]  from people saying, you know, thank you
[1:57:44.080 --> 1:57:47.200]  for being on the programs and enlightening us
[1:57:47.200 --> 1:57:48.120]  through what's going on.
[1:57:48.120 --> 1:57:52.000]  And we're getting a lot of foreign subscribers as well.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:55.440]  Just recently we've got about 10 from Russia,
[1:57:55.440 --> 1:57:57.200]  plus other places throughout the world.
[1:57:57.200 --> 1:57:59.160]  I'm having troops come up to me on the street
[1:57:59.160 --> 1:58:01.520]  and say they're awake and call in and letters.
[1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:03.200]  I mean, police, go ahead.
[1:58:04.320 --> 1:58:05.480]  Well, that's great.
[1:58:05.480 --> 1:58:08.000]  And that's why, the reason I mentioned that
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:12.200]  is that's why the conspiracy is exposing itself
[1:58:12.200 --> 1:58:13.440]  because it has to.
[1:58:13.440 --> 1:58:15.840]  It doesn't have any choice at this point.
[1:58:15.840 --> 1:58:17.960]  Too many people know what they're doing now.
[1:58:17.960 --> 1:58:20.000]  And it's going to get greater and greater and greater
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:22.240]  in the ignorant and the uneducated
[1:58:22.240 --> 1:58:24.200]  are finally going to catch on as well.
[1:58:24.200 --> 1:58:26.960]  So now, so now they're just hiding in plain view going,
[1:58:26.960 --> 1:58:28.680]  oh yeah, there's a world government in FEMA camps,
[1:58:28.680 --> 1:58:30.000]  but let's have a discussion.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:31.120]  Maybe we need them.
[1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:34.400]  Yeah, you're right about that.
[1:58:34.400 --> 1:58:39.400]  And I think that the propaganda that's being spewed out,
[1:58:41.040 --> 1:58:45.640]  this mixture of 95% truth and 5% propaganda
[1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:49.800]  isn't going to work and you've gone through it, Philly.
[1:58:49.800 --> 1:58:52.120]  Well, in a very short period of time,
[1:58:52.120 --> 1:58:55.080]  very thoroughly, especially in regard to Glenn Beck.
[1:58:55.080 --> 1:58:58.360]  And we discussed this a couple of weeks ago
[1:58:58.360 --> 1:59:01.520]  and they just want you to think
[1:59:01.520 --> 1:59:04.520]  that the major media is covering this one.
[1:59:04.520 --> 1:59:07.840]  In fact, they're really not, it's really misdirection.
[1:59:09.800 --> 1:59:12.600]  But this, I mean, every historical indication shows
[1:59:12.600 --> 1:59:15.120]  this means they're desperate and that they're in trouble.
[1:59:15.120 --> 1:59:16.120]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:19.200]  And I don't think many people realize this.
[1:59:19.200 --> 1:59:22.760]  I mean, you know, you and some others who are on the air
[1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:25.000]  are really drilling this thing.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:29.040]  But I am very, very chagrin, very unhappy
[1:59:29.040 --> 1:59:33.480]  that very few newsletters have pursued this.
[1:59:34.720 --> 1:59:35.560]  Stay there, Bob.
[1:59:35.560 --> 1:59:37.240]  Got a break, 72nd break.
[1:59:37.240 --> 1:59:39.360]  Third hour, only seconds away.
[1:59:39.360 --> 1:59:42.800]  Hello, friends, this is Alex Jones.
[1:59:42.800 --> 1:59:44.800]  I've told you for a long time it's important
[1:59:44.800 --> 1:59:47.200]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important
[1:59:47.200 --> 1:59:48.040]  than ever.
[1:59:48.040 --> 1:59:50.800]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[1:59:50.800 --> 1:59:52.400]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line
[1:59:52.400 --> 1:59:53.600]  if you have your own bread.
[1:59:53.600 --> 1:59:55.200]  You'll never have to go to the superdome
[1:59:55.200 --> 1:59:57.200]  and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[1:59:57.200 --> 1:59:59.800]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare,
[1:59:59.800 --> 2:00:02.200]  you'll never have to go to the superdome
[2:00:02.200 --> 2:00:04.200]  and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[2:00:04.200 --> 2:00:07.200]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare,
[2:00:07.200 --> 2:00:09.480]  in any emergency, if you simply prepare,
[2:00:09.480 --> 2:00:11.120]  no one is going to take care of your family
[2:00:11.120 --> 2:00:12.720]  in the final equation but you.
[2:00:12.720 --> 2:00:15.080]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift
[2:00:15.080 --> 2:00:17.040]  horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[2:00:17.040 --> 2:00:19.760]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports
[2:00:19.760 --> 2:00:21.440]  and they do it at almost half the cost
[2:00:21.440 --> 2:00:23.000]  of last year's grocery prices.

[2:00:46.920 --> 2:00:49.000]  The first step is getting storable food.
[2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:56.080]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:00:56.080 --> 2:00:59.120]  Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:04.120]  Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[2:01:04.120 --> 2:01:09.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:01:10.560 --> 2:01:11.800]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[2:01:11.800 --> 2:01:13.600]  The mainstream media everywhere is admitting
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:16.400]  world government is here but saying it's not.
[2:01:16.400 --> 2:01:17.240]  It's not.
[2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:18.080]  It's not.
[2:01:18.080 --> 2:01:18.920]  It's not.
[2:01:18.920 --> 2:01:19.760]  It's not.
[2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:20.600]  It's not.
[2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:21.440]  It's not.
[2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:22.280]  It's not.
[2:01:22.280 --> 2:01:23.120]  It's not.
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:23.960]  It's not.
[2:01:23.960 --> 2:01:24.800]  It's not.
[2:01:24.800 --> 2:01:25.640]  It's not.
[2:01:25.640 --> 2:01:26.480]  It's not.
[2:01:26.480 --> 2:01:27.320]  It's not.
[2:01:27.320 --> 2:01:28.160]  It's not.
[2:01:28.160 --> 2:01:29.180]  It's not.
[2:01:29.180 --> 2:01:30.040]  It's not.
[2:01:30.040 --> 2:01:30.860]  It's not.
[2:01:30.860 --> 2:01:31.700]  It's not.
[2:01:31.700 --> 2:01:34.160]  Only man is here but saying it will save us.
[2:01:34.160 --> 2:01:37.960]  A few people, like Lou Dobbs where saying it's a bad idea.
[2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:39.840]  He's been credibly doing it for a long time
[2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:40.740]  but conservatively.
[2:01:40.740 --> 2:01:42.740]  I believe he's good
[2:01:42.740 --> 2:01:44.700]  but seeing an in lets him on to have some credibility
[2:01:44.700 --> 2:01:46.920]  because people now know this is going on.
[2:01:46.920 --> 2:01:49.580]  The establishment can't ignore it any longer
[2:01:49.580 --> 2:01:51.140]  so we're into a conditioning period
[2:01:51.140 --> 2:01:52.520]  and the establishment's getting scared.
[2:01:52.520 --> 2:01:54.180]  That's why Brazovinsky and Oliver Dom taping.
[2:01:54.180 --> 2:01:55.560]  Oh the evil bankers.
[2:01:55.560 --> 2:01:57.960]  with the general public at the retail level.
[2:01:57.960 --> 2:02:00.480]  So they use our anger and put it into their own operations.
[2:02:00.480 --> 2:02:02.620]  It's very, very sophisticated.
[2:02:02.620 --> 2:02:05.240]  Bob Chapman, let's get into what's happening
[2:02:05.240 --> 2:02:07.040]  with the economy right now.
[2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:08.040]  Let's sub-break down.
[2:02:08.040 --> 2:02:10.840]  It plunging in the last two days below 7,000.
[2:02:10.840 --> 2:02:13.600]  You had predicted that for late February, early March,
[2:02:13.600 --> 2:02:15.440]  I remember a few months ago,
[2:02:15.440 --> 2:02:16.520]  but then you've also predicted,
[2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:18.720]  I'm going from memory that it'll go back up for a while
[2:02:18.720 --> 2:02:21.360]  and then take an even greater plunge.
[2:02:21.360 --> 2:02:24.760]  You've talked about it going down to 4,000, correct?
[2:02:24.760 --> 2:02:28.280]  Right, and I think if we were to hold at 4,000,
[2:02:28.280 --> 2:02:30.600]  we would be very, very fortunate.
[2:02:30.600 --> 2:02:34.600]  We touched 7,600 yesterday in that area,
[2:02:34.600 --> 2:02:39.160]  and the news that came out today was so dreadful
[2:02:39.160 --> 2:02:41.880]  on employment and other things
[2:02:41.880 --> 2:02:44.400]  and the market's up 127 points.
[2:02:44.400 --> 2:02:47.080]  And that means the United States government's in there
[2:02:47.080 --> 2:02:50.320]  trying to hold the market up to keep it from going lower.
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:54.080]  I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't get a small rally here
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:57.040]  back to 7,200, which would be normal,
[2:02:57.040 --> 2:03:01.720]  and to test that 7,268 bottom that was set in 1994
[2:03:01.720 --> 2:03:04.360]  and then again in 2002.
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:07.640]  And so over the period of time here,
[2:03:07.640 --> 2:03:12.640]  we'll go down into the 6,000 to 6,600 area,
[2:03:12.920 --> 2:03:15.200]  probably in the next month or so,
[2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:18.200]  and it'll find some sort of a bottom there,
[2:03:18.200 --> 2:03:20.920]  and then it'll rally again and then go lower.
[2:03:20.920 --> 2:03:25.920]  But perhaps this year, in all probability next year,
[2:03:27.160 --> 2:03:31.920]  in a timing on this is so hard, we're gonna see 4,000.
[2:03:31.920 --> 2:03:36.280]  And if you want to project what happened
[2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:37.920]  during the last depression,
[2:03:37.920 --> 2:03:39.880]  and we are in a depression already,
[2:03:39.880 --> 2:03:41.920]  we started at the beginning of February.
[2:03:43.040 --> 2:03:46.920]  If you wanna go back and compare it to the 1930s,
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:50.040]  and I believe we're about five times worse off today
[2:03:50.040 --> 2:03:51.600]  than we were then,
[2:03:51.600 --> 2:03:56.000]  I think that we're looking at a duplication
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  of the 89% correction that took place in 1933.
[2:04:01.440 --> 2:04:02.360]  And if that's the case,
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:07.360]  we're going down to somewhere between 1,260 and 1,450.
[2:04:09.480 --> 2:04:11.920]  And that's a long, long way down.
[2:04:11.920 --> 2:04:14.880]  And we'll eventually get there.
[2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:17.800]  And now the establishment just has to manage the collapse,
[2:04:17.800 --> 2:04:20.680]  poses our saviors, blame a few little Madoffs,
[2:04:20.680 --> 2:04:21.720]  the other minions,
[2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:23.280]  while they carry out the Ponzi scheme,
[2:04:23.280 --> 2:04:25.320]  it's meant to implode the whole world into their hands.
[2:04:25.320 --> 2:04:27.320]  I don't think they're gonna get away with it, Bob.
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:28.760]  I don't think so either.
[2:04:28.760 --> 2:04:32.160]  And I think one of their major problems
[2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:33.920]  is going to be right on Wall Street
[2:04:33.920 --> 2:04:36.320]  for people who are not directly involved,
[2:04:36.320 --> 2:04:37.640]  people who work there,
[2:04:37.640 --> 2:04:39.840]  they have a good idea what's going on.
[2:04:39.840 --> 2:04:41.720]  And I talked to some of them,
[2:04:41.720 --> 2:04:44.160]  and they usually live out in Long Island
[2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:47.320]  or a little bit upstate or over in New Jersey.
[2:04:47.320 --> 2:04:48.280]  And they were all armed
[2:04:48.280 --> 2:04:50.280]  in doing the same thing that we're doing
[2:04:50.280 --> 2:04:51.800]  because they know what's coming.
[2:04:51.800 --> 2:04:53.120]  Now that's the issue.
[2:04:53.120 --> 2:04:54.680]  We told the truth for decades.
[2:04:54.680 --> 2:04:56.920]  You told it for 40 plus years
[2:04:56.920 --> 2:04:58.240]  as we read the globalist plans.
[2:04:58.240 --> 2:04:59.360]  Now it's all coming through.
[2:04:59.360 --> 2:05:02.840]  We did our work planning the seeds of truth.
[2:05:02.840 --> 2:05:06.280]  Man, this is gonna be one hell of a fight though, Bob.
[2:05:06.280 --> 2:05:07.120]  I know it is.
[2:05:07.120 --> 2:05:09.080]  And they know what they lose.
[2:05:09.080 --> 2:05:11.000]  They're gonna totally lose power.
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:14.360]  And in some instances by a treason,
[2:05:14.360 --> 2:05:17.760]  they're probably gonna forfeit their lives and fortunes.
[2:05:17.760 --> 2:05:19.400]  But you know they'll stage nuke attacks.
[2:05:19.400 --> 2:05:20.800]  They'll stage fake terror attacks.
[2:05:20.800 --> 2:05:22.000]  Rand Corporation says they're getting ready
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:24.320]  to stage World War III to cover this up.
[2:05:24.320 --> 2:05:25.280]  I mean, we gotta realize
[2:05:25.280 --> 2:05:27.440]  we're dealing with vicious killers here.
[2:05:27.440 --> 2:05:28.280]  That's right.
[2:05:28.280 --> 2:05:29.920]  They are evil, evil people
[2:05:29.920 --> 2:05:31.720]  and they are going to have another war.
[2:05:31.720 --> 2:05:33.800]  And I've been talking about that
[2:05:33.800 --> 2:05:36.400]  on this program for some time.
[2:05:36.400 --> 2:05:37.240]  Bob, stay there.
[2:05:37.240 --> 2:05:38.440]  Let's talk more about the economy
[2:05:38.440 --> 2:05:42.600]  and how fast the deepening depression is accelerating
[2:05:42.600 --> 2:05:44.680]  and how bad it's gonna get with Bob Chapman.
[2:05:44.680 --> 2:05:46.120]  Then a schedule later,
[2:05:46.120 --> 2:05:48.280]  we got Lindsay Wums popping in to take your calls
[2:05:48.280 --> 2:05:49.960]  and get more into how they're imploding
[2:05:49.960 --> 2:05:51.840]  the oil markets by design.
[2:05:51.840 --> 2:05:53.160]  In fact, John, get that clip ready
[2:05:53.160 --> 2:05:55.200]  from the Davos thing with George Soros.
[2:05:55.200 --> 2:05:56.040]  We haven't even played that yet.
[2:05:56.040 --> 2:05:57.200]  We've had it for weeks.
[2:05:57.200 --> 2:05:58.360]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:05:58.360 --> 2:06:00.360]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[2:06:02.920 --> 2:06:05.520]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[2:06:05.520 --> 2:06:08.600]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[2:06:08.600 --> 2:06:10.880]  The price of food continues to rise
[2:06:10.880 --> 2:06:13.520]  and the economy continues to falter.
[2:06:13.520 --> 2:06:15.640]  You know that you need to prepare
[2:06:15.640 --> 2:06:17.040]  and maybe you've been putting it off
[2:06:17.040 --> 2:06:19.040]  but the time to act is now.
[2:06:19.040 --> 2:06:22.320]  That's why you need to visit organicaseed.com.

[2:07:01.440 --> 2:07:03.920]  It is a big idea.
[2:07:03.920 --> 2:07:07.480]  A new world order in the near future.
[2:07:07.480 --> 2:07:10.600]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:07:10.600 --> 2:07:13.440]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[2:07:13.440 --> 2:07:16.240]  Could their objective be world domination?
[2:07:16.240 --> 2:07:19.320]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:07:19.320 --> 2:07:22.280]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:07:22.280 --> 2:07:26.160]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[2:07:26.160 --> 2:07:27.160]  is at hand.
[2:07:29.760 --> 2:07:31.520]  For the first time in history,
[2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:33.600]  the elite's plan for world government
[2:07:33.600 --> 2:07:35.160]  is blown wide open.
[2:07:35.160 --> 2:07:37.920]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world
[2:07:37.920 --> 2:07:39.040]  order agenda.
[2:07:39.040 --> 2:07:40.600]  Bilderberg is making great progress
[2:07:40.600 --> 2:07:41.600]  toward a world government.
[2:07:41.600 --> 2:07:42.760]  Most people have no idea.
[2:07:42.760 --> 2:07:43.560]  They're not after money.
[2:07:43.560 --> 2:07:44.840]  They have all the money they need.
[2:07:44.840 --> 2:07:45.800]  They're after power.
[2:07:45.800 --> 2:07:46.880]  That's their after easy.

[2:07:58.440 --> 2:08:00.640]  You have been warned.
[2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:01.560]  You worry.
[2:08:01.560 --> 2:08:03.640]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[2:08:03.640 --> 2:08:06.240]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[2:08:06.240 --> 2:08:08.360]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:09.920]  Your answer may be at hand.
[2:08:09.920 --> 2:08:11.880]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land
[2:08:11.880 --> 2:08:13.560]  isolated from civilization.
[2:08:13.560 --> 2:08:15.720]  She knows that as long as the sun shines,
[2:08:15.720 --> 2:08:18.800]  there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[2:08:18.800 --> 2:08:20.400]  Perhaps the only sane insurance
[2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:22.840]  is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[2:08:22.840 --> 2:08:24.440]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[2:08:24.440 --> 2:08:27.320]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[2:08:27.320 --> 2:08:29.400]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious
[2:08:29.400 --> 2:08:30.800]  than our modern diets.
[2:08:30.800 --> 2:08:32.320]  Well respected in her field,
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:33.960]  Linda's approach to teaching this subject
[2:08:33.960 --> 2:08:36.000]  includes books, flashcards, and video
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:39.480]  with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[2:08:39.480 --> 2:08:42.160]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it,
[2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:44.320]  how to prepare, use, and store it.
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:46.520]  Go to Linda's website ofthefield.com
[2:08:46.520 --> 2:08:48.280]  and take advantage of special offers.

[2:08:54.160 --> 2:08:57.520]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[2:08:57.520 --> 2:09:01.080]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[2:09:01.080 --> 2:09:10.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:09:10.680 --> 2:09:12.280]  You want answers?
[2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:13.800]  Well, so does he.
[2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:17.960]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[2:09:17.960 --> 2:09:21.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:09:21.960 --> 2:09:24.680]  The websites are infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[2:09:24.680 --> 2:09:28.280]  Don't forget, March 15th, the Obama Deception Drops
[2:09:28.280 --> 2:09:30.480]  at prismplanet.tv and Super Act Quality,
[2:09:30.480 --> 2:09:32.680]  an information warfare weapon.
[2:09:32.680 --> 2:09:34.560]  Who the bankers are, how they control things,
[2:09:34.560 --> 2:09:36.840]  how Obama's their puppet, how Bush was their puppet,
[2:09:36.840 --> 2:09:39.160]  how it's seamless integration for administration,
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:40.960]  administration setting up their world government,
[2:09:40.960 --> 2:09:43.760]  their carbon taxes, total control, all of his lies.
[2:09:43.760 --> 2:09:45.680]  What his real agenda is, the FEMA camps,
[2:09:45.680 --> 2:09:48.480]  the forced conscription, the states revolted,
[2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:50.360]  the state's forced immigration,
[2:09:50.360 --> 2:09:52.440]  the state's forced conscription, the states revolting,
[2:09:52.440 --> 2:09:55.200]  the film is done, the film's been sent off to be mass-produced.
[2:09:55.200 --> 2:09:56.720]  We'll probably have it the next seven days
[2:09:56.720 --> 2:09:58.840]  and start packaging them up to ship out on the 15th.
[2:09:58.840 --> 2:10:01.600]  Get your orders in at infowars.com right now.
[2:10:01.600 --> 2:10:05.480]  Or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:07.720]  They're betting that he can neutralize the left
[2:10:07.720 --> 2:10:09.400]  and the general public to stand down
[2:10:09.400 --> 2:10:10.960]  while they launch their new world order
[2:10:10.960 --> 2:10:13.960]  so they can stage their terror attacks and start huge wars.
[2:10:13.960 --> 2:10:15.840]  They're doing it all, they're moving ahead.
[2:10:15.840 --> 2:10:17.680]  If we expose their agenda now, and believe me,
[2:10:17.680 --> 2:10:18.880]  these films have power.
[2:10:18.880 --> 2:10:20.160]  If you spread it out to everybody,
[2:10:20.160 --> 2:10:23.920]  make copies of the DVD, download it from prismpana.tv,
[2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:24.760]  spread it out to everybody.
[2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:28.080]  If you go crazy with this, it will have a big effect.
[2:10:28.080 --> 2:10:29.360]  Believe me, we have more power
[2:10:29.360 --> 2:10:31.640]  than a lot of you actually realize and know.
[2:10:31.640 --> 2:10:33.800]  Bob Chapman, the international forecaster.
[2:10:35.480 --> 2:10:37.240]  If people just realize they can take action
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:39.560]  and defeat this thing, we can do it.
[2:10:39.560 --> 2:10:42.720]  But really, folks need to understand that, don't they?
[2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:44.120]  They certainly do.
[2:10:44.120 --> 2:10:48.240]  And your program goes a long way toward accomplishing that.
[2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:50.280]  And please, when you get these tapes,
[2:10:50.280 --> 2:10:52.320]  make copies, send them all over the place,
[2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:55.800]  all over the world, let people know what's going on.
[2:10:55.800 --> 2:10:57.480]  It's just like with my publication.
[2:10:57.480 --> 2:10:59.560]  You know, I tell people who are subscribers,
[2:10:59.560 --> 2:11:01.560]  if you want to send it to other people, do it.
[2:11:01.560 --> 2:11:03.000]  Some of them will subscribe
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:04.400]  because they want to get their own copy.
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:06.600]  But that's not what the mission is.
[2:11:06.600 --> 2:11:09.240]  The mission is to get the story out,
[2:11:09.240 --> 2:11:12.640]  to make people understand who the real enemy is.
[2:11:12.640 --> 2:11:13.920]  Absolutely, Bob.
[2:11:15.080 --> 2:11:17.120]  When I say this, I'm not putting a good face on it.
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:18.400]  It's the truth.
[2:11:18.400 --> 2:11:19.640]  The military's waking up.
[2:11:19.640 --> 2:11:21.040]  More contributions than Ron Paul,
[2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:22.760]  than any other candidate, including the Democrat,
[2:11:22.760 --> 2:11:25.080]  kept saying, just Republican, no, it's all candidates.
[2:11:25.080 --> 2:11:27.080]  They know, the police are waking up.
[2:11:27.080 --> 2:11:28.960]  If people become aware of stage terror,
[2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:30.200]  stage financial collapse,
[2:11:30.200 --> 2:11:32.520]  and learn this is a bunch of made-off criminals
[2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:35.240]  running things, and he was the founder of the Nasdaq,
[2:11:35.240 --> 2:11:37.560]  and that all these banks are involved in this by design,
[2:11:37.560 --> 2:11:40.040]  and they learn how the IMF and World Bank bankrupt countries
[2:11:40.040 --> 2:11:41.680]  like Argentina, Iceland, and others,
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:44.000]  and now doing it here in England and Europe by design,
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:45.680]  we can defeat these people.
[2:11:45.680 --> 2:11:49.000]  I mean, bottom line, folks, we've gotta tell the truth.
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:50.760]  We've gotta get the story out there,
[2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:53.040]  because the enemy is so obviously criminal.
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:11:55.640]  If we just tell the truth, they're gonna be defeated.
[2:11:57.040 --> 2:11:59.680]  And I think what, to go along with this, Alex,
[2:11:59.680 --> 2:12:03.840]  is the fact that we have projected on your program,
[2:12:03.840 --> 2:12:08.560]  that the economy is going to do exactly what it has done
[2:12:08.560 --> 2:12:12.200]  over the past five years, you know, gone into the sewer.
[2:12:12.200 --> 2:12:15.160]  And your program, and my publication,
[2:12:15.160 --> 2:12:18.680]  and a handful of others, very few, unfortunately,
[2:12:18.680 --> 2:12:21.720]  have projected this, and we've been right all along.
[2:12:21.720 --> 2:12:23.960]  So, ladies and gentlemen, the audience,
[2:12:23.960 --> 2:12:27.040]  please listen, because we get the handle on this.
[2:12:27.040 --> 2:12:28.720]  We know what we're talking about.
[2:12:28.720 --> 2:12:30.680]  We know that where this is going.
[2:12:31.680 --> 2:12:34.360]  You've got to listen, and you've got to act,
[2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:39.240]  because when unemployment continues to expand,
[2:12:39.240 --> 2:12:43.200]  the U6 is really about 15.5% right now.
[2:12:43.200 --> 2:12:46.480]  That's a government figure that's intermediate on employment,
[2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:48.360]  and not to go into detail on it.
[2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:51.360]  And that'll be over 22% this year.
[2:12:51.360 --> 2:12:54.200]  And next year, it'll go higher.
[2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:57.440]  And as more and more people become discontented,
[2:12:57.440 --> 2:13:01.400]  all this information, particularly the tapes that you have,
[2:13:01.400 --> 2:13:03.080]  they will be put into fertile hands,
[2:13:03.080 --> 2:13:04.960]  because people will start listening,
[2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:09.000]  and saying to themselves, who did this to me?
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:12.600]  And we're gonna tell them who and how to change things.
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:14.400]  That's right, but if we're not there,
[2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:16.280]  and remember, we're the people that told you 10,
[2:13:16.280 --> 2:13:19.240]  15, 20, 30 years ago, as this was unfolding,
[2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:21.160]  America was a big country to take down,
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:22.000]  to bring into tyranny.
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:24.600]  But they slowly took over all the institutions,
[2:13:24.600 --> 2:13:26.240]  they set it up, and we always knew
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:28.280]  they'd have a financial implosion to do it.
[2:13:28.280 --> 2:13:30.600]  This is the final coup de gras, as they say.
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:33.280]  We have, and the globalists admit they're using this
[2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:34.840]  as an opportunity for their new world order.
[2:13:34.840 --> 2:13:37.560]  We have to use this as an opportunity, like Judo,
[2:13:37.560 --> 2:13:40.120]  as they attack us to use their force against them.
[2:13:40.120 --> 2:13:43.080]  I wanna play a video clip of George Sorrell's a few weeks ago,
[2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:45.480]  because this dovetails with what Lindsey Williams said,
[2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:48.080]  about not just imploding other commodities in oil.
[2:13:48.080 --> 2:13:50.200]  He said this back when it was $147 a barrel,
[2:13:50.200 --> 2:13:53.120]  because he knows a big oil company executive he worked with.
[2:13:53.120 --> 2:13:54.560]  He said it was gonna drop down below 50.
[2:13:54.560 --> 2:13:56.200]  It's gone as low as 33.
[2:13:56.200 --> 2:13:57.800]  It's right up at 40 right now.
[2:13:58.640 --> 2:14:00.600]  And he said a year and a half down the road,
[2:14:00.600 --> 2:14:02.680]  that we go back into hyperinflation,
[2:14:02.680 --> 2:14:07.120]  to bankrupt Russia, bankrupt Venezuela,
[2:14:07.120 --> 2:14:10.080]  bankrupt Canada, bankrupt the oil fields of Texas,
[2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:11.160]  and Oklahoma.
[2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:14.920]  So they're doing this to create a depression
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:17.280]  while they hyperinflate and buy everything up.
[2:14:17.280 --> 2:14:18.320]  So let's go ahead and play that clip
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:19.560]  and get Bob Chapman's take on this.
[2:14:19.560 --> 2:14:21.240]  Here's George Sorrell's admitting that,
[2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:22.520]  oh, it's okay that oil's plunging,
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:24.480]  this is being used basically as a weapon
[2:14:24.480 --> 2:14:26.360]  to bring down the Arab states and other nations.
[2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:27.320]  Here it is.
[2:14:27.320 --> 2:14:29.080]  At bank efforts going on in the United States,
[2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:30.760]  but there's so much else to be discussed here,
[2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:33.040]  because this is, after all, the world economic form.
[2:14:33.040 --> 2:14:35.480]  Let's talk for a moment about the price of oil.
[2:14:35.480 --> 2:14:39.080]  What are the implications of $40 oil in your mind?
[2:14:39.080 --> 2:14:42.760]  Well, it's a sudden reversal of fortunes
[2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:44.840]  for the oil producing countries.
[2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:49.840]  And in the Gulf states, you have quite a few bubbles popping.
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:58.480]  Dubai was probably the biggest real estate bubble
[2:14:58.720 --> 2:15:02.120]  in the world, and it's now bursting.
[2:15:02.120 --> 2:15:05.120]  However, it's not all bad news,
[2:15:05.120 --> 2:15:08.080]  because the major oil producing countries
[2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:11.240]  have been the enemies of the prevailing world order,
[2:15:11.240 --> 2:15:15.120]  Venezuela, Iran, Russia.
[2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:20.120]  And it's not so easy to finance a Bolivarian revolution
[2:15:20.720 --> 2:15:22.360]  with $40 oil.
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:25.880]  So I think Venezuela is Chavez,
[2:15:25.880 --> 2:15:28.040]  probably his days are numbered.
[2:15:28.040 --> 2:15:32.680]  And in Iran, I think that he's not going to last a year.
[2:15:34.280 --> 2:15:37.360]  Maybe wrong, but I mean he's under considerable duress,
[2:15:37.360 --> 2:15:40.200]  and his influence is going to decline.
[2:15:40.200 --> 2:15:45.200]  In Iran, and Ahmadinejad is up for elections in 1909,
[2:15:45.880 --> 2:15:50.720]  and unless he can provoke some incident,
[2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:55.720]  or I think that he's liable to also be defeated
[2:15:55.720 --> 2:15:59.080]  and you may have a more reasonable regime.
[2:15:59.080 --> 2:16:00.320]  But how much?
[2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:03.280]  Now, Russia is more troubling,
[2:16:03.280 --> 2:16:08.280]  because Putin has been using oil for a number of reasons
[2:16:13.320 --> 2:16:18.320]  to reestablish Russia's geopolitical influence,
[2:16:19.080 --> 2:16:23.320]  to enrich the rulers, to maintain themselves in power,
[2:16:23.320 --> 2:16:26.480]  and to bribe the rulers of the neighboring countries
[2:16:26.480 --> 2:16:29.760]  to gain control over their gas.
[2:16:29.760 --> 2:16:34.760]  But through the success, he was very popular.
[2:16:35.880 --> 2:16:36.720]  And...
[2:16:38.840 --> 2:16:40.080]  Not so easy now.
[2:16:40.080 --> 2:16:44.760]  Now, suddenly you have had a financial collapse,
[2:16:44.760 --> 2:16:49.760]  inflation, ruble falling, living standards falling.
[2:16:50.640 --> 2:16:55.640]  And there is a danger that he will be more adventurous
[2:16:55.640 --> 2:17:00.640]  trying to have some foreign adventure, Ukraine,
[2:17:02.200 --> 2:17:05.840]  whatever, to divert attention.
[2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:07.160]  I'm afraid we have to end it there.
[2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:08.680]  George Soros would like to thank you very much.
[2:17:08.680 --> 2:17:10.560]  We didn't get to China, but we heard lots about Russia.
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:12.400]  That is George Soros, live from Davos,
[2:17:12.400 --> 2:17:13.600]  the World Economic Forum.
[2:17:14.920 --> 2:17:16.600]  Now, understand, this is the perfect plan.
[2:17:16.600 --> 2:17:19.320]  Destroy the economy, destroy oil, consolidate everything.
[2:17:19.320 --> 2:17:21.040]  The banks hoard the bailout money given to them
[2:17:21.040 --> 2:17:22.960]  by every European and Western nation,
[2:17:22.960 --> 2:17:25.760]  including the U.S. and Canada, in over 20 trillion total,
[2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:27.600]  just 9.7 trillion here in the United States,
[2:17:27.600 --> 2:17:28.920]  alone of our tax money.
[2:17:28.920 --> 2:17:31.680]  This is their big, massive move.
[2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:36.120]  And there's Soros admitting all of this,
[2:17:36.120 --> 2:17:39.040]  but then claiming that Putin's starting things,
[2:17:39.040 --> 2:17:40.880]  and Venezuela's starting things,
[2:17:40.880 --> 2:17:42.120]  and Iran is starting things.
[2:17:42.120 --> 2:17:45.120]  When Iran has terrorists from the United States and Israel,
[2:17:45.120 --> 2:17:46.240]  they admit, the White House admits,
[2:17:46.240 --> 2:17:47.280]  staging terror attacks.
[2:17:47.280 --> 2:17:48.880]  Well, hobbyists, actually al-Qaeda,
[2:17:48.880 --> 2:17:50.160]  working with the globalists as they always do,
[2:17:50.160 --> 2:17:52.440]  attacking them, they're taking it.
[2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:53.400]  All of this is happening.
[2:17:53.400 --> 2:17:56.280]  They staged a sneak attack on Russian-held areas
[2:17:56.280 --> 2:17:59.240]  in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, back on 888.
[2:17:59.240 --> 2:18:01.040]  The media claimed that Russia had snuck attack,
[2:18:01.040 --> 2:18:02.800]  then had to admit that was a hoax.
[2:18:04.080 --> 2:18:05.680]  We can really see their move.
[2:18:05.680 --> 2:18:07.800]  And here's Soros, who implodes economies
[2:18:07.800 --> 2:18:09.680]  on a smaller scale to make his tens of billions
[2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:11.560]  in the past through currency manipulation.
[2:18:11.560 --> 2:18:13.600]  Now, he's posing like the good guy here.
[2:18:13.600 --> 2:18:15.040]  This is amazing, Bob Chapman.
[2:18:16.160 --> 2:18:17.040]  Yeah, it is.
[2:18:17.040 --> 2:18:20.160]  And it bears out what you said early in the program,
[2:18:20.160 --> 2:18:21.920]  that they're coming out into the open
[2:18:21.920 --> 2:18:24.520]  because they're being forced to.
[2:18:24.520 --> 2:18:25.840]  Not only by the knowledge
[2:18:25.840 --> 2:18:27.040]  that we're spreading throughout the world,
[2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:31.680]  but also the Berk nations, as they're called,
[2:18:31.680 --> 2:18:35.560]  have pushed the alumnus into a corner as well.
[2:18:35.560 --> 2:18:40.560]  What he says about Venezuela and Iran is true,
[2:18:41.200 --> 2:18:43.360]  in the case of Venezuela,
[2:18:43.360 --> 2:18:48.360]  the popularity of Mr. Chavez is down to 54% from over 60.
[2:18:48.360 --> 2:18:51.200]  And that's understandable.
[2:18:51.200 --> 2:18:54.760]  There's not as much money to go around under his regime.
[2:18:55.600 --> 2:18:59.680]  In Iran, as well as in Venezuela,
[2:19:00.520 --> 2:19:05.520]  you have the CIA and others
[2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:09.040]  who are trying to undermine the governments
[2:19:09.040 --> 2:19:10.440]  in those countries.
[2:19:10.440 --> 2:19:13.280]  And this stand for the fear that just happened,
[2:19:13.280 --> 2:19:16.000]  which they're trying to keep it undercover,
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:18.680]  was a government operation,
[2:19:18.680 --> 2:19:23.640]  which is very similar to the Australian Nugent Hand episode
[2:19:23.640 --> 2:19:26.560]  that went on in the, I think it was the late 80s,
[2:19:26.560 --> 2:19:29.360]  and which I won't get into here,
[2:19:29.360 --> 2:19:32.680]  but it was another government operation.
[2:19:32.680 --> 2:19:34.600]  And what George doesn't tell you
[2:19:34.600 --> 2:19:39.600]  is that he was the one who financed and organized
[2:19:39.840 --> 2:19:43.880]  all of these incursions into the Baltic countries,
[2:19:43.880 --> 2:19:45.920]  as well as Ukraine and others,
[2:19:45.920 --> 2:19:50.200]  with these orange and red and violet revolutions,
[2:19:50.200 --> 2:19:52.880]  which has caused Russia so much trouble.
[2:19:52.880 --> 2:19:56.840]  And this is intelligence warfare,
[2:19:56.840 --> 2:19:59.760]  and he's behind a good part of it.
[2:19:59.760 --> 2:20:03.080]  So for him to come out and say what he said,
[2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:06.680]  which could have been said by you, Alex, or I,
[2:20:08.240 --> 2:20:10.360]  because that is what's happening.
[2:20:11.360 --> 2:20:13.920]  For him to have to admit that,
[2:20:13.920 --> 2:20:16.200]  you know that they're on their backsides.
[2:20:16.200 --> 2:20:18.200]  They're wondering, what do we do next?
[2:20:20.520 --> 2:20:22.520]  It's amazing, though, that, again,
[2:20:22.520 --> 2:20:24.800]  we told people this six months ago,
[2:20:24.800 --> 2:20:26.360]  and now it's at Davos two weeks ago.
[2:20:26.360 --> 2:20:28.520]  I mean, everything we tell you is what's happening,
[2:20:28.520 --> 2:20:30.920]  because we really know how the geopolitical system works.
[2:20:30.920 --> 2:20:32.480]  We know who the globalist are.
[2:20:32.480 --> 2:20:33.600]  We're right about this.
[2:20:33.600 --> 2:20:35.240]  Bob, I want to do five more minutes with you
[2:20:35.240 --> 2:20:37.560]  on the other side, because I want you to talk about
[2:20:37.560 --> 2:20:39.320]  these latest Ponzi schemes that are imploding
[2:20:39.320 --> 2:20:40.880]  and how their intelligence operations,
[2:20:40.880 --> 2:20:44.520]  the National Security Exchange Commission
[2:20:44.520 --> 2:20:46.080]  coming out and saying national security
[2:20:46.080 --> 2:20:47.720]  on Madoff and other issues,
[2:20:47.720 --> 2:20:50.120]  admitting the White House is involved in all of this,
[2:20:50.120 --> 2:20:52.000]  stealing your pension funds, folks.
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:54.080]  These are nothing but banker criminals
[2:20:54.080 --> 2:20:56.200]  using the intelligence agencies in the West.
[2:20:56.200 --> 2:20:58.680]  They founded and homeland security
[2:20:58.680 --> 2:21:01.400]  to oppress the people while they thieve.

[2:22:00.960 --> 2:22:03.960]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years
[2:22:03.960 --> 2:22:06.000]  hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:07.640]  and live out their golden years.
[2:22:07.640 --> 2:22:11.400]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy,
[2:22:11.400 --> 2:22:13.520]  housing, and medical, many retirees
[2:22:13.520 --> 2:22:15.760]  are forced to live below the poverty line.
[2:22:15.760 --> 2:22:18.520]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit
[2:22:18.520 --> 2:22:20.400]  we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us
[2:22:20.400 --> 2:22:23.960]  into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[2:22:23.960 --> 2:22:25.600]  These questions and more can be answered
[2:22:25.600 --> 2:22:27.880]  by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[2:22:27.880 --> 2:22:29.000]  from Jekyll Island.
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:30.800]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's
[2:22:30.800 --> 2:22:34.240]  what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[2:22:34.240 --> 2:22:36.400]  A gripping adventure into the secret world
[2:22:36.400 --> 2:22:38.480]  of international banking cartel.
[2:22:38.480 --> 2:22:39.680]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[2:22:39.680 --> 2:22:42.120]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s
[2:22:42.120 --> 2:22:44.200]  to anyone who purchases this book.

[2:22:49.080 --> 2:22:52.080]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[2:23:00.440 --> 2:23:03.600]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[2:23:03.600 --> 2:23:07.160]  we have a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:23:07.160 --> 2:23:09.840]  The enemy struck America on September 11.
[2:23:09.840 --> 2:23:11.320]  But who is the enemy?
[2:23:11.320 --> 2:23:12.160]  bin Laden.
[2:23:12.160 --> 2:23:13.240]  This is his MO.
[2:23:13.240 --> 2:23:14.480]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:23:14.480 --> 2:23:16.480]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:23:16.480 --> 2:23:18.560]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[2:23:18.560 --> 2:23:21.240]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:23:21.240 --> 2:23:23.600]  networks inside the United States.
[2:23:23.600 --> 2:23:26.440]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis, again,
[2:23:26.440 --> 2:23:30.440]  very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[2:23:30.440 --> 2:23:32.800]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[2:23:32.800 --> 2:23:34.200]  have been detained.
[2:23:34.200 --> 2:23:36.040]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[2:23:36.040 --> 2:23:39.480]  the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:23:39.480 --> 2:23:42.240]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[2:23:42.240 --> 2:23:44.360]  the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:23:44.360 --> 2:23:45.640]  Fabled Enemies.
[2:23:45.640 --> 2:23:49.800]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality,
[2:23:49.800 --> 2:23:53.280]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:23:53.280 --> 2:23:56.800]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:24:00.240 --> 2:24:01.720]  Have you ever wanted to generate
[2:24:01.720 --> 2:24:03.680]  your own supply of electrical power?
[2:24:03.680 --> 2:24:06.320]  If so, this is going to be the most important message
[2:24:06.320 --> 2:24:07.400]  you will ever hear.
[2:24:07.400 --> 2:24:10.200]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions
[2:24:10.200 --> 2:24:13.760]  from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[2:24:13.760 --> 2:24:15.720]  These emergency backup systems provide
[2:24:15.720 --> 2:24:18.400]  life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:24:18.400 --> 2:24:21.560]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly,
[2:24:21.560 --> 2:24:24.440]  emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[2:24:24.440 --> 2:24:26.320]  It's like having an electric power plant running
[2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:27.840]  quietly in your own home.
[2:24:27.840 --> 2:24:30.760]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers,
[2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:32.560]  and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:24:32.560 --> 2:24:34.760]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts,
[2:24:34.760 --> 2:24:36.880]  or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer
[2:24:36.880 --> 2:24:38.800]  through painful power outages again.
[2:24:38.800 --> 2:24:40.760]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready
[2:24:40.760 --> 2:24:43.760]  with a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.

[2:24:58.400 --> 2:25:01.840]  Don't wait, call today.
[2:25:01.840 --> 2:25:04.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:07.680]  proudly presents the Alex Jones show,
[2:25:07.680 --> 2:25:11.400]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:25:11.400 --> 2:25:13.800]  Lindsey Williams is always very punctual about interviews.
[2:25:13.800 --> 2:25:15.480]  We may have gotten a time zone wrong with him,
[2:25:15.480 --> 2:25:16.800]  or he may have gotten one wrong.
[2:25:16.800 --> 2:25:20.040]  We'll probably be on the next hour, if not tomorrow.
[2:25:20.040 --> 2:25:22.280]  But we've got Bob Chapman on with us right now.
[2:25:22.280 --> 2:25:23.800]  But I wanted to get Williams on and play
[2:25:23.800 --> 2:25:25.320]  this Soros Clips and take your calls.
[2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:27.160]  Calls are coming up in the next segment.
[2:25:27.160 --> 2:25:28.680]  A bunch of other news I haven't gotten to,
[2:25:28.680 --> 2:25:30.840]  and we have another state rep from another state
[2:25:30.840 --> 2:25:32.040]  moving to declare sovereignty,
[2:25:32.040 --> 2:25:35.160]  popping in the last 15 minutes of the show today.
[2:25:35.160 --> 2:25:36.800]  Bob Chapman, it's clear that Obama
[2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:38.000]  is another color revolution,
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:41.080]  just like the CIA and Soros on record funded
[2:25:41.080 --> 2:25:43.960]  the orange and the purple and all these,
[2:25:43.960 --> 2:25:44.800]  that's what they call it,
[2:25:44.800 --> 2:25:46.040]  is they go by colors for those that don't know,
[2:25:46.040 --> 2:25:47.880]  encircling Russia, starting fights with it.
[2:25:47.880 --> 2:25:49.480]  We're no fans of the elites in Russia.
[2:25:49.480 --> 2:25:51.400]  The point is, the globalists are the big daddy,
[2:25:51.400 --> 2:25:53.600]  NATO's the big daddy, it's moving weapons in,
[2:25:53.600 --> 2:25:55.360]  it launched a sneak attack on Georgia,
[2:25:55.360 --> 2:25:57.960]  and Obama is their color revolution here,
[2:25:57.960 --> 2:26:00.360]  because of the people they fake revolution as well.
[2:26:02.280 --> 2:26:04.040]  Well, that capitalizes it.
[2:26:04.040 --> 2:26:05.800]  You're absolutely correct.
[2:26:05.800 --> 2:26:09.360]  And they're gonna continue to use these artifices
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:12.080]  and devices to mislead the public.
[2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:15.320]  And the public isn't educated in these matters.
[2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:18.240]  Most of them, once they get a job
[2:26:18.240 --> 2:26:19.480]  and they're going through life,
[2:26:19.480 --> 2:26:22.240]  they don't educate themselves further.
[2:26:22.240 --> 2:26:26.320]  They would rather watch the news and watch programs
[2:26:26.320 --> 2:26:28.520]  on television or sporting events.
[2:26:28.520 --> 2:26:30.560]  And so it's up to us to tell them
[2:26:30.560 --> 2:26:32.960]  what is being done to them
[2:26:32.960 --> 2:26:36.240]  and how people are pulling the wool over their eyes.
[2:26:36.240 --> 2:26:39.520]  And this color thing is one of those artifices
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:40.560]  which they use.
[2:26:41.720 --> 2:26:43.160]  Describe for those that don't know
[2:26:43.160 --> 2:26:45.040]  why they call it a color revolution.
[2:26:47.640 --> 2:26:51.040]  It's just a piece of misdirection.
[2:26:51.040 --> 2:26:53.280]  It's to make people think
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:58.040]  that there's actually a popular
[2:26:58.040 --> 2:27:00.280]  uprising within a country.
[2:27:00.280 --> 2:27:02.800]  We'll take Ukraine as an example.
[2:27:02.800 --> 2:27:06.760]  And by putting a color on it, it changes everything.
[2:27:06.760 --> 2:27:10.040]  It allows people to follow something
[2:27:10.040 --> 2:27:12.240]  rather than an individual
[2:27:12.240 --> 2:27:15.640]  following a colored movement like purple.
[2:27:15.640 --> 2:27:18.840]  And that's how they get away with what they're doing.
[2:27:18.840 --> 2:27:20.560]  And then they convince the people
[2:27:20.560 --> 2:27:22.480]  that they should change the government,
[2:27:22.480 --> 2:27:24.280]  which they did in a number of these countries.
[2:27:24.280 --> 2:27:27.000]  So it's staged false revolutions
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:29.360]  because they know worldwide that people are in revolt.
[2:27:29.360 --> 2:27:31.560]  That's in the Pentagon, the public documents
[2:27:31.560 --> 2:27:33.960]  that's in the British Ministry of Defense plans.
[2:27:33.960 --> 2:27:35.760]  And they admit the public is revolting
[2:27:35.760 --> 2:27:36.680]  against globalism.
[2:27:36.680 --> 2:27:38.040]  So every time the public revolts,
[2:27:38.040 --> 2:27:40.720]  the establishment goes in with a fake revolution.
[2:27:40.720 --> 2:27:42.320]  And that's what we've got to watch
[2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:45.040]  with Glenn Beck and others now posing as our saviors,
[2:27:45.040 --> 2:27:47.760]  but mixing all the lies and pro-war rhetoric
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:49.520]  into the middle of it.
[2:27:49.520 --> 2:27:51.400]  You have nailed it down.
[2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:55.080]  Absolutely, that's exactly what they're doing.
[2:27:55.080 --> 2:27:58.760]  Go back to the 1950s and read the first books
[2:27:58.760 --> 2:28:03.520]  on brainwashing, which had come into publishing
[2:28:03.520 --> 2:28:06.400]  at that time as a result of what went on
[2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:09.040]  during the Korean War.
[2:28:09.040 --> 2:28:11.040]  And the fundamentals are all there.
[2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:13.480]  I mean, I studied them because I had to.
[2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:16.800]  And fortunately, I must say.
[2:28:16.800 --> 2:28:20.600]  And every place that they started these,
[2:28:21.840 --> 2:28:25.440]  began and created these political revolutions,
[2:28:25.440 --> 2:28:27.240]  some of which became somewhat violent,
[2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:29.680]  but most of them were political.
[2:28:29.680 --> 2:28:31.120]  They've lost power.
[2:28:31.120 --> 2:28:33.840]  And the reason they were doing it in the Baltics
[2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:37.960]  and Ukraine and in the Balkans as well,
[2:28:37.960 --> 2:28:40.400]  is to keep Russia off balance.
[2:28:40.400 --> 2:28:42.040]  Yeah, that's what the Balkans were about.
[2:28:42.040 --> 2:28:43.560]  I mean, let me take the big color revolution
[2:28:43.560 --> 2:28:47.960]  from 1917, 1918, where on record, New York and London banks
[2:28:47.960 --> 2:28:50.160]  publicly funded the Bolsheviks, tens of thousands
[2:28:50.160 --> 2:28:54.280]  of terrorists with weapons and trainloads of gold
[2:28:54.280 --> 2:28:56.200]  to go in and blow out these czars
[2:28:56.200 --> 2:28:57.600]  who were not saying they're perfect.
[2:28:57.600 --> 2:28:59.480]  The point is, that was the British cousins
[2:28:59.480 --> 2:29:02.840]  knocking off their other cousins, the czars, on record.
[2:29:02.840 --> 2:29:05.080]  And they killed 40 million people.
[2:29:05.080 --> 2:29:06.360]  This is what they do.
[2:29:07.360 --> 2:29:08.680]  That's right.
[2:29:08.680 --> 2:29:12.320]  That's exactly what they do in the Russian established
[2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:14.400]  government at that time, the monarchy,
[2:29:14.400 --> 2:29:17.040]  that was getting hit from both sides.
[2:29:17.040 --> 2:29:19.480]  They had the Germans on one side attacking them,
[2:29:19.480 --> 2:29:23.400]  and then they had the Red Forces against the White Army,
[2:29:23.400 --> 2:29:24.560]  getting it from the other side.
[2:29:24.560 --> 2:29:26.480]  It was a brutal situation.
[2:29:27.440 --> 2:29:31.120]  Absolutely, and they know what they're doing,
[2:29:31.120 --> 2:29:33.720]  but if the public is aware of these operations,
[2:29:33.720 --> 2:29:34.920]  they fall apart and you're right.
[2:29:34.920 --> 2:29:39.520]  More and more, their false flag ops, their NATO options,
[2:29:39.520 --> 2:29:43.720]  the different systems that they've been using
[2:29:43.720 --> 2:29:45.680]  are blowing up in their face.
[2:29:45.680 --> 2:29:46.760]  They are not working.
[2:29:47.760 --> 2:29:49.880]  Well, we can't let government get away
[2:29:49.880 --> 2:29:54.880]  with what they got away with some years ago in BCCI.
[2:29:54.880 --> 2:29:58.240]  And this is what the Stanford thing is, I believe.
[2:29:58.240 --> 2:30:00.840]  I'm only guessing at this point, but I do know
[2:30:00.840 --> 2:30:05.200]  that the employees that Stanford had in Venezuela
[2:30:05.200 --> 2:30:07.480]  were paid by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[2:30:07.480 --> 2:30:09.920]  All right, I gotta stop you again.
[2:30:09.920 --> 2:30:11.240]  I know I said I was gonna let you go
[2:30:11.240 --> 2:30:13.040]  and I wanna go to calls, but quick break.
[2:30:13.040 --> 2:30:14.320]  We'll do four more minutes on the side,
[2:30:14.320 --> 2:30:15.440]  plug the newsletter too.
[2:30:15.440 --> 2:30:17.280]  I want, because I forgot last segment,
[2:30:17.280 --> 2:30:18.720]  I said I wanted you to talk about that,
[2:30:18.720 --> 2:30:20.640]  the made-off things, the Stanford deals,
[2:30:20.640 --> 2:30:21.960]  more and more of these Ponzi schemes,
[2:30:21.960 --> 2:30:24.640]  always with national security being declared around them.
[2:30:24.640 --> 2:30:26.240]  What is the point of all the money,
[2:30:26.240 --> 2:30:29.080]  these business fronts where they put Wall Street money in
[2:30:29.080 --> 2:30:31.200]  to go infiltrate countries, including our own,
[2:30:31.200 --> 2:30:32.440]  and they do it by stealing police,
[2:30:32.440 --> 2:30:34.280]  firemen, and teachers pension funds?
[2:30:34.280 --> 2:30:35.160]  And we'll break that down.
[2:30:35.160 --> 2:30:37.680]  Bob, you can do five more minutes.
[2:30:37.680 --> 2:30:38.840]  Any time you want.
[2:30:38.840 --> 2:30:40.240]  All right, you're the best.
[2:30:40.240 --> 2:30:41.240]  Bob Chapman is our guest,

[2:30:55.480 --> 2:30:58.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:31:01.440 --> 2:31:04.120]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs,
[2:31:04.120 --> 2:31:06.360]  as the dollar continues to fall in value,
[2:31:06.360 --> 2:31:08.640]  what can you and your family do to guarantee
[2:31:08.640 --> 2:31:10.160]  that fresh nutritious vegetables
[2:31:10.160 --> 2:31:11.960]  will make it to your dinner table?
[2:31:11.960 --> 2:31:13.360]  Garden in a can.

[2:31:24.600 --> 2:31:27.120]  non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds
[2:31:27.120 --> 2:31:28.960]  along with detailed planting instructions
[2:31:28.960 --> 2:31:32.000]  sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.

[2:31:55.520 --> 2:31:57.400]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[2:31:57.400 --> 2:32:00.000]  I've come with a message of information.
[2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:02.520]  9-11 was an inside job.
[2:32:02.520 --> 2:32:03.920]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[2:32:03.920 --> 2:32:05.640]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[2:32:05.640 --> 2:32:08.240]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[2:32:08.240 --> 2:32:10.600]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[2:32:10.600 --> 2:32:14.640]  the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR, and Lisa Donchella.
[2:32:14.640 --> 2:32:16.920]  The day that we stop asking questions
[2:32:16.920 --> 2:32:20.080]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[2:32:20.080 --> 2:32:22.000]  to grow at our own pace.
[2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:25.560]  It's the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[2:32:25.560 --> 2:32:26.560]  to grow at our own door.
[2:32:26.560 --> 2:32:29.720]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[2:32:29.720 --> 2:32:32.720]  a global awakening has taken place.
[2:32:32.720 --> 2:32:35.240]  An inside job?
[2:32:35.240 --> 2:32:36.400]  How dare you?
[2:32:36.400 --> 2:32:39.400]  I don't want to keep up the topic, sir.
[2:32:39.400 --> 2:32:41.000]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:42.880]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:32:42.880 --> 2:32:45.640]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:32:45.640 --> 2:32:48.560]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[2:32:48.560 --> 2:32:51.160]  we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[2:32:51.160 --> 2:32:52.160]  Truth rises.
[2:32:52.160 --> 2:32:54.960]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now,
[2:32:54.960 --> 2:32:57.240]  or get the DVD at ImpleWars.com.
[2:32:57.240 --> 2:33:00.720]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:33:00.720 --> 2:33:04.200]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[2:33:04.200 --> 2:33:06.280]  And did you know that you have greater exposure
[2:33:06.280 --> 2:33:08.320]  to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[2:33:08.320 --> 2:33:09.600]  than when drinking the water?
[2:33:09.600 --> 2:33:11.720]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled
[2:33:11.720 --> 2:33:14.760]  when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[2:33:14.760 --> 2:33:17.240]  The KDF dual-media shower filter works
[2:33:17.240 --> 2:33:20.520]  with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine,
[2:33:20.520 --> 2:33:22.240]  lead, mercury, and iron.
[2:33:22.240 --> 2:33:25.400]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae,
[2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:26.280]  and fungus.
[2:33:26.280 --> 2:33:28.800]  The KDF dual-media shower filter typically
[2:33:28.800 --> 2:33:32.040]  lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[2:33:32.040 --> 2:33:34.680]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities
[2:33:34.680 --> 2:33:37.400]  use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals,
[2:33:37.400 --> 2:33:38.320]  and bacteria.
[2:33:38.320 --> 2:33:39.320]  What about you?
[2:33:39.320 --> 2:33:42.200]  Order your KDF shower filter normally $49
[2:33:42.200 --> 2:33:45.800]  for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[2:33:51.320 --> 2:33:55.080]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[2:34:05.680 --> 2:34:08.840]  You know, you've studied history, the Roman Empire,
[2:34:08.840 --> 2:34:14.840]  the Byzantines, the Chinese Empire, the Chin, the Japanese.
[2:34:14.840 --> 2:34:15.760]  Humans act the same.
[2:34:15.760 --> 2:34:17.800]  People are people.
[2:34:17.800 --> 2:34:20.560]  Africa, people are people.
[2:34:20.560 --> 2:34:22.960]  I mean, in basic villages, between villages
[2:34:22.960 --> 2:34:27.040]  are subterfuge, backstabbing, cliques, secret societies,
[2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:30.920]  intelligence operations.
[2:34:30.920 --> 2:34:32.680]  And they somehow told everybody, go out and play
[2:34:32.680 --> 2:34:33.600]  the world's a wonderland.
[2:34:33.600 --> 2:34:34.120]  It's safe.
[2:34:34.120 --> 2:34:34.640]  Have fun.
[2:34:34.640 --> 2:34:35.920]  Leave your government alone.
[2:34:35.920 --> 2:34:40.240]  Let them operate and seek international security.
[2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:42.560]  Then we got used as military slaves.
[2:34:42.560 --> 2:34:43.440]  We lost our freedoms.
[2:34:43.440 --> 2:34:45.560]  We got taxed to fund the New World Order.
[2:34:45.560 --> 2:34:48.840]  And now they're really getting ready to make us serfs.
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:50.400]  They're fully dropping the hammer.
[2:34:50.400 --> 2:34:51.520]  They're done just using us.
[2:34:51.520 --> 2:34:55.160]  They want to make us basically bankrupt slaves.
[2:34:55.160 --> 2:35:00.800]  So we have no economic power to have jobs, to go to college.
[2:35:00.800 --> 2:35:04.120]  The globalists constantly say they want poor, stupid serfs,
[2:35:04.120 --> 2:35:10.400]  living in basically squalor, compact city control grids.
[2:35:10.400 --> 2:35:12.240]  And it's here.
[2:35:12.240 --> 2:35:14.760]  History is nothing but empires and slaughter and death
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:16.280]  and evil people taking control.
[2:35:16.280 --> 2:35:20.160]  There's a few precious times when people of vision
[2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:21.640]  who love humanity have gotten in control.
[2:35:21.640 --> 2:35:23.560]  They've set up systems to tie down
[2:35:23.560 --> 2:35:25.240]  tyranny, to tie down government.
[2:35:25.240 --> 2:35:26.200]  It's never been perfect.
[2:35:26.200 --> 2:35:29.360]  But under those systems, milk and honey flows.
[2:35:29.360 --> 2:35:33.680]  Creativity, inventiveness, explodes, renaissance.
[2:35:33.680 --> 2:35:37.400]  The globalists want to put us back into a post-industrial
[2:35:37.400 --> 2:35:39.840]  world, in their words.
[2:35:39.840 --> 2:35:40.960]  They want to control.
[2:35:40.960 --> 2:35:42.200]  That's what the carbon taxes are.
[2:35:42.200 --> 2:35:43.720]  This is hellish we're facing.
[2:35:43.720 --> 2:35:47.560]  So wake up, stop being children, join the fight of your life.
[2:35:47.560 --> 2:35:50.040]  We have a good chance of winning if you'll get up.
[2:35:50.040 --> 2:35:53.240]  The fake Christian churches are government paid for.
[2:35:53.240 --> 2:35:54.240]  They tell folks, lay down.
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:35:55.240]  It's the end of the world.
[2:35:55.240 --> 2:35:56.240]  Rejoice that things are getting bad.
[2:35:56.240 --> 2:35:57.560]  Jesus will be here soon.
[2:35:57.560 --> 2:35:58.840]  It's made up, folks.
[2:35:58.840 --> 2:36:01.120]  But even if it was the end of the world next week,
[2:36:01.120 --> 2:36:03.400]  you have a moral duty to fight evil and corruption.
[2:36:03.400 --> 2:36:04.760]  Bob Chapman, a comment on that.
[2:36:04.760 --> 2:36:07.760]  And then let's get your quick take on these Ponzi schemes.
[2:36:07.760 --> 2:36:10.160]  You had said, when the Mayaw thing first broke,
[2:36:10.160 --> 2:36:11.760]  that you had intelligent sources on air.
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:14.560]  You wrote about in the newsletter that it was a scan
[2:36:14.560 --> 2:36:17.600]  with the U.S. government and Israel fencing the money.
[2:36:17.600 --> 2:36:19.240]  Then it did start coming out in mainstream news
[2:36:19.240 --> 2:36:20.240]  that he had government connections.
[2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:22.760]  He was allowed to stay in his house, ship gold and diamonds
[2:36:22.760 --> 2:36:23.760]  out.
[2:36:23.760 --> 2:36:26.640]  I mean, obviously, one guy didn't steal $50 to $100 million
[2:36:26.640 --> 2:36:27.640]  by himself.
[2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:28.640]  They claim he ran it all himself.
[2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:31.960]  His sons have moved to Latin America.
[2:36:31.960 --> 2:36:34.040]  And then you said other Ponzi schemes would come out.
[2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:35.680]  Every time they do, there's all these intelligence
[2:36:35.680 --> 2:36:36.920]  agencies' connections.
[2:36:36.920 --> 2:36:38.800]  And then a few weeks ago in congressional, well, three weeks
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:41.960]  ago in congressional testimony, the Securities and Change
[2:36:41.960 --> 2:36:44.160]  Commission said, we will not testify on this.
[2:36:44.160 --> 2:36:46.520]  We're declaring national security, presidential
[2:36:46.520 --> 2:36:47.400]  directives.
[2:36:47.400 --> 2:36:49.280]  This is national security issue.
[2:36:49.280 --> 2:36:51.000]  And they were saying, for nine years,
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:52.880]  you were told this was a scam.
[2:36:52.880 --> 2:36:53.840]  And you did nothing.
[2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:55.520]  And they said, we declare national security.
[2:36:55.520 --> 2:36:57.120]  We played that clip here.
[2:36:57.120 --> 2:37:00.600]  That is an admission, right there, Bob, that you were right.
[2:37:00.600 --> 2:37:07.920]  And you know, the SEC have been on my case since 1967.
[2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:10.200]  And they have never let up.
[2:37:10.200 --> 2:37:13.840]  And they are nothing but a criminal organization.
[2:37:13.840 --> 2:37:18.080]  And they are working with the major broker terms, the banks,
[2:37:18.080 --> 2:37:20.040]  to perpetuate profit.
[2:37:20.040 --> 2:37:23.200]  They won't even put the uptick rule back in for shooting.
[2:37:23.200 --> 2:37:25.200]  They won't even stop making shooting.
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:28.680]  But they've got plenty of time to go and put small broker
[2:37:28.680 --> 2:37:31.960]  chouses, small brokers, and newsletter writers out of
[2:37:31.960 --> 2:37:33.440]  business.
[2:37:33.440 --> 2:37:36.320]  And so the proof is all there, made off.
[2:37:36.320 --> 2:37:39.000]  It took hundreds of people to pull that scam.
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:40.080]  Where did the money go?
[2:37:40.080 --> 2:37:41.080]  They don't want to tell you.
[2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:42.840]  It's a state secret.
[2:37:42.840 --> 2:37:47.200]  The latest is the apartment worth $7 million or $70 million
[2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:47.960]  or whatever it is.
[2:37:47.960 --> 2:37:48.600]  $60 million.
[2:37:48.600 --> 2:37:51.520]  He is allowed to live in, if you can believe this.
[2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:55.560]  This man is a criminal and admitted criminal.
[2:37:55.560 --> 2:37:58.680]  And it all belongs to his wife, so she should keep it.
[2:37:58.680 --> 2:38:00.360]  Give me a break.
[2:38:00.360 --> 2:38:02.600]  There's no way they're going to be able to prove that.
[2:38:02.600 --> 2:38:04.960]  Because the only way she can keep that
[2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:08.120]  is to prove that those things were given to her
[2:38:08.120 --> 2:38:09.360]  by somebody else.
[2:38:09.360 --> 2:38:11.240]  And that is not the case.
[2:38:11.240 --> 2:38:14.080]  And do you think somebody or a number of people
[2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:17.840]  are going to go up and lie about having given her
[2:38:17.840 --> 2:38:21.000]  that apartment or having given her that thing?
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:23.040]  Look at how they're protecting him.
[2:38:23.040 --> 2:38:25.240]  And I don't know if you watch those hearings in Congress.
[2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:28.760]  I watch quite a bit of it working on the Obama deception.
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:31.840]  They kept saying, the SEC kept defending made off, saying,
[2:38:31.840 --> 2:38:32.680]  it's not proven.
[2:38:32.680 --> 2:38:33.440]  He's not guilty.
[2:38:33.440 --> 2:38:36.040]  And they're like, he's confessed.
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:39.440]  And they said, national security, national security.
[2:38:39.440 --> 2:38:42.840]  Well, that's the level that I operate at.
[2:38:42.840 --> 2:38:46.080]  And I'll tell you, I've nailed them time after time.
[2:38:46.080 --> 2:38:50.320]  And the CFTC, the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation,
[2:38:50.320 --> 2:38:52.080]  is every bit as bad.
[2:38:52.080 --> 2:38:55.920]  And they're the ones who are in the comics
[2:38:55.920 --> 2:38:57.520]  and the commodity market.
[2:38:57.520 --> 2:39:00.400]  And the rigging in the gold and silver markets
[2:39:00.400 --> 2:39:02.440]  is in other markets as well.
[2:39:02.440 --> 2:39:05.120]  We show what they did in deleveraging
[2:39:05.120 --> 2:39:09.480]  by bringing down the entire commodity market, oil included.
[2:39:09.480 --> 2:39:11.360]  And look where we are now.
[2:39:11.360 --> 2:39:15.680]  And then to go along with what you were talking about,
[2:39:15.680 --> 2:39:19.880]  carbon taxes, go one step further, Massachusetts.
[2:39:19.880 --> 2:39:22.920]  And all of the big business leaders are for this.
[2:39:22.920 --> 2:39:25.240]  A parking tax.
[2:39:25.240 --> 2:39:30.440]  They want to put a gasoline tax of $0.26 a gallon on.
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:32.800]  That's one of the reasons they brought gasoline down.
[2:39:32.800 --> 2:39:34.280]  So they could do that.
[2:39:34.280 --> 2:39:38.080]  And next, they'll have a UN gasoline tax, which
[2:39:38.080 --> 2:39:40.520]  will fund those international.
[2:39:40.520 --> 2:39:41.840]  No, no, they've announced there's
[2:39:41.840 --> 2:39:44.680]  going to be a tax on children, a carbon tax.
[2:39:44.680 --> 2:39:45.640]  You can just Google that.
[2:39:45.640 --> 2:39:48.160]  It's all over the news how great it is.
[2:39:48.160 --> 2:39:50.560]  The very criminal bankers that have run all these scams
[2:39:50.560 --> 2:39:52.120]  now setting up world government, where
[2:39:52.120 --> 2:39:53.960]  we pay our taxes to them, it's incredible.
[2:39:53.960 --> 2:39:56.280]  Bob Chapman, the internationalforecaster.com,
[2:39:56.280 --> 2:39:57.480]  folks get a free copy of it there,
[2:39:57.480 --> 2:40:00.040]  or subscribe to it twice a week electronically.
[2:40:00.040 --> 2:40:03.280]  Or how often does the hard copy that gets mailed out go out?
[2:40:03.280 --> 2:40:06.200]  That goes out twice a month for those who are not on the internet.
[2:40:06.200 --> 2:40:09.280]  All right, so theinternationalforecaster.com.
[2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:11.840]  Bob Chapman, we'll talk to you again on Friday.
[2:40:11.840 --> 2:40:14.720]  So much is happening that will lead you back on again.
[2:40:14.720 --> 2:40:16.760]  Thank you so much for your knowledge and foresight
[2:40:16.760 --> 2:40:18.680]  and understanding of this is invaluable.
[2:40:18.680 --> 2:40:20.840]  And just you continue to be proven absolutely dead on.
[2:40:20.840 --> 2:40:22.200]  God bless you.
[2:40:22.200 --> 2:40:23.240]  Thank you very much.
[2:40:23.240 --> 2:40:24.040]  Bye-bye.
[2:40:24.040 --> 2:40:25.720]  Yeah, there goes Bob Chapman.
[2:40:25.720 --> 2:40:29.400]  As I said, Lindsey Williams is always on target, always on time.
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:31.560]  Time zone issue, something you may be coming in the next hour.
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:33.120]  If not, it'll be on the next few days.
[2:40:33.120 --> 2:40:34.680]  This is a lot of new developments there.
[2:40:34.680 --> 2:40:36.240]  I wanted to have Lindsey on it right now.
[2:40:36.240 --> 2:40:37.840]  Let's go to Mark in Wisconsin.
[2:40:37.840 --> 2:40:38.720]  Mark, you're on the air.
[2:40:42.560 --> 2:40:44.080]  Yes, Mark.
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:46.120]  I was going on a long time listening.
[2:40:46.120 --> 2:40:47.080]  You're a big fan.
[2:40:47.080 --> 2:40:47.920]  You're one of my heroes.
[2:40:47.920 --> 2:40:48.880]  Just want to get that out.
[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:50.680]  I know you're probably pressed for time,
[2:40:50.680 --> 2:40:53.080]  so I'll just get right into the issue.
[2:40:53.080 --> 2:40:54.920]  From Wisconsin, as far as I can tell,
[2:40:54.920 --> 2:40:59.120]  my state is not part of the state sovereignty movement.
[2:40:59.120 --> 2:41:01.400]  You really got to push for that.
[2:41:01.400 --> 2:41:03.360]  Right in front of me, I have the number
[2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:07.280]  if I can give it out for Senator Russ Feingold's office,
[2:41:07.280 --> 2:41:08.520]  area code 202.
[2:41:08.520 --> 2:41:09.040]  Hold on.
[2:41:09.040 --> 2:41:11.120]  Wouldn't you want to call the state legislature instead
[2:41:11.120 --> 2:41:14.120]  of the federal senator?
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:15.160]  You may be right.
[2:41:15.160 --> 2:41:17.080]  That's the only number I was able to get
[2:41:17.080 --> 2:41:18.320]  was his Washington office.
[2:41:18.320 --> 2:41:20.080]  I do have the local office.
[2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:21.640]  But see, he's a federal senator.
[2:41:21.640 --> 2:41:23.240]  They want federal control.
[2:41:23.240 --> 2:41:28.200]  You want to call the legislature, the state government.
[2:41:28.200 --> 2:41:29.520]  I got you.
[2:41:29.520 --> 2:41:32.200]  So go ahead and give Feingold's number out if you want.
[2:41:32.200 --> 2:41:33.560]  I mean, go ahead.
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:41.520]  All right, that number is area code 202-224-5323.
[2:41:41.520 --> 2:41:45.200]  What would your suggestion be then, as far as web pages
[2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:47.680]  to pull up for local representatives?
[2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:49.880]  I mean, I would Google Wisconsin legislature,
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:52.080]  and I would start calling your representative in your area,
[2:41:52.080 --> 2:41:54.200]  then committee chairman, others, and say 30.
[2:41:54.200 --> 2:41:56.840]  Now it's 31 states, but it is resolutions.
[2:41:56.840 --> 2:41:58.320]  And I would get copies of resolutions
[2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:00.000]  from New Hampshire, Oklahoma, and others,
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:01.640]  and I'd email them to their email address.
[2:42:01.640 --> 2:42:03.720]  I appreciate your call to hear from you, Mark.
[2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:07.520]  Lindsey in Idaho, Lindsey, you're on the air.
[2:42:07.520 --> 2:42:08.320]  Good day, Alex.
[2:42:08.320 --> 2:42:09.120]  How are you?
[2:42:09.120 --> 2:42:10.320]  Good.
[2:42:10.320 --> 2:42:14.600]  Just to let you know, you're talking about this Glenn Beck
[2:42:14.600 --> 2:42:17.440]  TV fiasco, I guess.
[2:42:17.440 --> 2:42:20.400]  Just to let listeners know, and you,
[2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:23.400]  I just sent the gentleman an email.
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:27.800]  And I just suggest that the listeners do the same,
[2:42:27.800 --> 2:42:33.400]  letting know pretty much what you think, I guess,
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:34.400]  is what I'm trying to say.
[2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:36.720]  Well, you need to send him documents, concentration camp
[2:42:36.720 --> 2:42:40.400]  documents, all the documents I covered in that 55-minute
[2:42:40.400 --> 2:42:42.960]  analysis I did with just all the proof of the FEMA camps,
[2:42:42.960 --> 2:42:45.760]  from the government, from the Army, direct sources, video
[2:42:45.760 --> 2:42:48.080]  of it, news articles, everything.
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:50.160]  So he doesn't seem to go, I'll tell you about the camps.
[2:42:50.160 --> 2:42:52.120]  He knows this is the biggest thing out there.
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:42:54.360]  And so the credibility, he'll cover some of it,
[2:42:54.360 --> 2:42:55.400]  then make jokes about it.
[2:42:55.400 --> 2:42:58.200]  This is a guy that said put 9-11 traitors in FEMA camps
[2:42:58.200 --> 2:42:59.880]  that were Timothy McVeigh's.
[2:42:59.880 --> 2:43:00.720]  Of course.
[2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:02.760]  I mean, this guy is a piece of work at Fox News.
[2:43:02.760 --> 2:43:04.080]  People are saying, trust him.
[2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:05.960]  When you watch it and it's a load of crap,
[2:43:05.960 --> 2:43:07.320]  he'll admit there's a new world order,
[2:43:07.320 --> 2:43:09.440]  but then say it's run by Putin.
[2:43:09.440 --> 2:43:11.320]  Well, I'm just saying that the listeners,
[2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:13.360]  to give him a good email barrage,
[2:43:13.360 --> 2:43:15.440]  I have his email address if you want it.
[2:43:15.440 --> 2:43:17.680]  Then people, if they want to send something to him,
[2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:19.160]  letting him know what you think.
[2:43:19.160 --> 2:43:20.640]  Sure, go ahead.
[2:43:20.640 --> 2:43:25.640]  His email address is m-e, just me, at glenbeck.com.
[2:43:28.040 --> 2:43:29.800]  All right, anything else, sir?
[2:43:29.800 --> 2:43:31.200]  I'm just saying to the listeners,
[2:43:31.200 --> 2:43:34.040]  I didn't put anything crude or derogatory
[2:43:34.040 --> 2:43:36.040]  or whatever, I just stated what I thought
[2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:39.160]  and that he needs to do a little more
[2:43:39.160 --> 2:43:43.760]  of his own accurate investigation
[2:43:43.760 --> 2:43:46.240]  before he goes out there and starts talking
[2:43:46.240 --> 2:43:47.640]  like he has been.
[2:43:47.640 --> 2:43:49.160]  And I'm just saying to the listeners
[2:43:49.160 --> 2:43:51.200]  to give him an email barrage and let him know
[2:43:51.200 --> 2:43:53.560]  that people are watching, that's all.
[2:43:53.560 --> 2:43:54.600]  Absolutely.
[2:43:54.600 --> 2:43:56.120]  Well, that's what he wants is the hype from this.
[2:43:56.120 --> 2:43:58.520]  The reason we're covering it, like when Lou Dobbs,
[2:43:58.520 --> 2:44:00.400]  conservatively in a focused manner,
[2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:02.080]  covers and tells the truth.
[2:44:02.080 --> 2:44:03.760]  We support him, it's amazing.
[2:44:05.200 --> 2:44:06.600]  You know, we're there.
[2:44:06.600 --> 2:44:08.960]  But when Glenn Beck, if you listen to him,
[2:44:08.960 --> 2:44:10.840]  he says, maybe FEMA camps are good.
[2:44:10.840 --> 2:44:11.760]  I don't know if they're real.
[2:44:11.760 --> 2:44:12.760]  Who conspiracy theories?
[2:44:12.760 --> 2:44:14.160]  He's making jokes about it
[2:44:14.160 --> 2:44:15.480]  while acting like he's against it.
[2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:16.800]  This is the guy that said,
[2:44:16.800 --> 2:44:19.000]  put 911 truthers in jail.
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:20.760]  This is the guy that said use the army against us.
[2:44:20.760 --> 2:44:21.840]  We're a bunch of McVays.
[2:44:21.840 --> 2:44:22.800]  This is the guy that says he's worried
[2:44:22.800 --> 2:44:24.560]  about bubbles in their guns.
[2:44:24.560 --> 2:44:25.680]  I mean, you could just watch it.
[2:44:25.680 --> 2:44:26.640]  It's double-speak.
[2:44:26.640 --> 2:44:29.000]  My gosh, it's so obvious.
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:31.640]  Alex, before I send him off a comment that I had,
[2:44:31.640 --> 2:44:33.680]  and like I said, it was nothing crude or anything,
[2:44:33.680 --> 2:44:36.760]  but just telling the gentleman to get us back straight.
[2:44:36.760 --> 2:44:38.080]  No, no, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[2:44:38.080 --> 2:44:40.880]  Just for anybody with his resources,
[2:44:40.880 --> 2:44:44.320]  with a radio producing crew and a Fox News crew
[2:44:44.320 --> 2:44:45.400]  saying he's looking into it,
[2:44:45.400 --> 2:44:46.400]  doesn't know if it's true or not,
[2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:48.280]  or maybe it is, or maybe it's a good thing.
[2:44:48.280 --> 2:44:50.240]  I mean, come on, we know this is a long-term plan.
[2:44:50.240 --> 2:44:51.760]  We've laid out all the evidence.
[2:44:51.760 --> 2:44:55.720]  Let's talk to Evie or Eve in Illinois.
[2:44:55.720 --> 2:44:57.640]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[2:44:57.640 --> 2:44:58.760]  Hi, Glenn.
[2:44:58.760 --> 2:45:00.600]  I've only been listening to you for about a week.
[2:45:00.600 --> 2:45:01.440]  This is Glenn back.
[2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:02.280]  I'm sorry, Glenn.
[2:45:02.280 --> 2:45:03.240]  We were just talking about Glenn.
[2:45:03.240 --> 2:45:04.080]  Sorry, Alex.
[2:45:04.080 --> 2:45:04.920]  No, it's okay, go ahead.
[2:45:04.920 --> 2:45:05.920]  I'm a little nervous.
[2:45:05.920 --> 2:45:08.640]  I'm a police officer and my husband's a police officer.
[2:45:08.640 --> 2:45:10.480]  I've only been listening to you for about a week,
[2:45:10.480 --> 2:45:13.240]  but my mom and dad have listened to your show
[2:45:13.240 --> 2:45:15.000]  and they've been talking just about it.
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  And my husband just recently was offered an opportunity
[2:45:20.120 --> 2:45:23.760]  to join a group called the Mobile Field Force.
[2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:27.600]  What it is, is every department in Illinois
[2:45:27.600 --> 2:45:30.480]  is sectioned off into like North, Southeast, and West,
[2:45:30.480 --> 2:45:33.000]  and they take so many officers from that department
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:35.560]  to go and train two and three times a month.
[2:45:35.560 --> 2:45:38.080]  Now, I find it a little odd
[2:45:38.080 --> 2:45:39.200]  because they really don't know exactly
[2:45:39.200 --> 2:45:40.120]  what they're training for.
[2:45:40.120 --> 2:45:42.800]  They try to play it off like it's after what happened
[2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:45.600]  in Louisiana when a crisis comes up
[2:45:45.600 --> 2:45:47.880]  or a natural disaster.
[2:45:47.880 --> 2:45:49.600]  They want to be able to have these officers.
[2:45:49.600 --> 2:45:51.280]  Yeah, we've had a male officer.
[2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:52.120]  Officer, stay there.
[2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:53.560]  I hear your radio's beeping.
[2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:54.640]  Do you need to take that real fast?
[2:45:54.640 --> 2:45:55.800]  We'll come back to you.
[2:45:55.800 --> 2:45:57.400]  No, I'm good.
[2:45:57.400 --> 2:45:59.840]  Okay, we share with other departments.
[2:45:59.840 --> 2:46:02.120]  That was just another department talking.
[2:46:02.120 --> 2:46:05.720]  But they train and from what my husband tells me,
[2:46:05.720 --> 2:46:09.760]  the training that they do is very militaristic in scope.
[2:46:09.760 --> 2:46:12.320]  And I just, he's a little,
[2:46:12.320 --> 2:46:13.800]  I don't know if I believe all that,
[2:46:13.800 --> 2:46:16.120]  but I know you're talking too that you think
[2:46:16.120 --> 2:46:17.640]  that there's going to be another terror attack
[2:46:17.640 --> 2:46:20.320]  and it's probably going to be in the schools or in a mall.
[2:46:20.320 --> 2:46:22.160]  And I also work part time at high schools
[2:46:22.160 --> 2:46:23.480]  with security guards.
[2:46:23.480 --> 2:46:25.440]  And after Columbine, I thought for sure,
[2:46:25.440 --> 2:46:27.600]  we would do a lot of drills and things like that
[2:46:27.600 --> 2:46:30.200]  just to make sure we're kind of up to snuff in our security
[2:46:30.200 --> 2:46:33.160]  and we've done nothing until the last year and a half.
[2:46:33.160 --> 2:46:35.920]  And we started intensifying and doing all these drills
[2:46:35.920 --> 2:46:37.600]  and doing all these scenarios.
[2:46:37.600 --> 2:46:39.240]  And I just find it a little odd
[2:46:39.240 --> 2:46:40.080]  and I just wanted to hear.
[2:46:40.080 --> 2:46:43.760]  Officer, let me tell you, go to YouTube, go to Google,
[2:46:43.760 --> 2:46:46.480]  watch police state 2000, police state two, the takeover,
[2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:48.120]  police state three total enslavement.
[2:46:48.120 --> 2:46:50.560]  You will witness troops training to take our guns.
[2:46:50.560 --> 2:46:53.560]  Earlier in the show, in the second hour,
[2:46:53.560 --> 2:46:56.560]  I spent almost all the segments,
[2:46:56.560 --> 2:46:58.800]  15 minutes going over all the documentation.
[2:46:58.800 --> 2:47:02.020]  There are real camps, people are already in them.
[2:47:02.020 --> 2:47:05.800]  They take police, you're really under federal control.
[2:47:05.800 --> 2:47:08.080]  The training's reasonable at first,
[2:47:08.080 --> 2:47:11.440]  no chemical or bio attack and then the next training is
[2:47:11.440 --> 2:47:13.080]  door-to-door gun confiscation,
[2:47:13.080 --> 2:47:14.840]  coordinating neighborhoods.
[2:47:14.840 --> 2:47:16.160]  Then you'll be training with the military.
[2:47:16.160 --> 2:47:17.760]  They're watching your husband.
[2:47:17.760 --> 2:47:19.360]  They're studying if he goes along with it.
[2:47:19.360 --> 2:47:20.920]  They're studying if he understands.
[2:47:20.920 --> 2:47:23.120]  They're sifting through the police
[2:47:23.120 --> 2:47:26.480]  to find these devilish jackboot cadres.
[2:47:26.480 --> 2:47:28.360]  The Illinois governor announced four months ago
[2:47:28.360 --> 2:47:31.520]  and then Blagojevich, former governor,
[2:47:31.520 --> 2:47:33.280]  on the news that we're gonna use the National Guard
[2:47:33.280 --> 2:47:35.080]  in neighborhood gun sweeps.
[2:47:35.080 --> 2:47:36.040]  They're doing drills everywhere
[2:47:36.040 --> 2:47:37.040]  with the military comes and says,
[2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:38.760]  let us search your neighborhood for guns.
[2:47:38.760 --> 2:47:41.080]  It's just a drill, North commas announced,
[2:47:41.080 --> 2:47:42.880]  they're gonna use the military against the people.
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:46.680]  So yes, yes, and I'm aware of those teams,
[2:47:46.680 --> 2:47:49.400]  the mobile field forces everywhere.
[2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:51.600]  They have these federally funded positions
[2:47:51.600 --> 2:47:52.760]  in the departments.
[2:47:52.760 --> 2:47:54.280]  That's what this is.
[2:47:54.280 --> 2:47:56.280]  We've had emergency managers from Indiana
[2:47:56.280 --> 2:47:59.200]  and other places on where they are gearing up
[2:47:59.200 --> 2:48:01.320]  for mass graves, for martial law.
[2:48:01.320 --> 2:48:04.600]  So specifically, any other points you've got
[2:48:04.600 --> 2:48:08.960]  or what is the training like that he's a little concerned about?
[2:48:10.560 --> 2:48:11.680]  Besides what we had to do,
[2:48:11.680 --> 2:48:13.320]  and I actually got to go do it with them,
[2:48:13.320 --> 2:48:17.680]  was we had to, like there was a biological attack
[2:48:17.680 --> 2:48:22.680]  and we had to escort a truck to the area in Joliet
[2:48:24.480 --> 2:48:27.280]  and we had to get these antidotes.
[2:48:27.280 --> 2:48:28.600]  Only enough for our department
[2:48:28.600 --> 2:48:30.960]  and our departmental family members.
[2:48:30.960 --> 2:48:33.040]  We had to provide guard duty for the truck
[2:48:33.040 --> 2:48:35.720]  as it came to town so that in case it was ambushed
[2:48:35.720 --> 2:48:37.560]  by people, obviously they wanted the antidote
[2:48:37.560 --> 2:48:41.160]  for their families and I really am to the point
[2:48:41.160 --> 2:48:43.160]  to where I don't want to be an officer anymore.
[2:48:43.160 --> 2:48:44.280]  I've been an officer for 12 years,
[2:48:44.280 --> 2:48:47.080]  my husband's 15, my dad's a retired officer.
[2:48:48.080 --> 2:48:50.840]  I just, pardon me, want to stay in it,
[2:48:50.840 --> 2:48:52.800]  try to kind of keep my head in the door.
[2:48:52.800 --> 2:48:54.760]  No, I think it's good, I think it's good,
[2:48:54.760 --> 2:48:57.600]  but in the time we have, listen to me very carefully officer.
[2:48:58.760 --> 2:49:00.200]  You notice I told you your first training
[2:49:00.200 --> 2:49:02.560]  would be biological weapons release, correct?
[2:49:02.560 --> 2:49:03.760]  Yes, and that's what it was.
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:05.440]  Okay, now let me explain something.
[2:49:05.440 --> 2:49:07.200]  Did you hear five years ago
[2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:08.960]  when they said all the police and first responders
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:11.600]  had to take the smallpox shot and they refused?
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:14.120]  I'm sure you remember that or heard about that.
[2:49:14.120 --> 2:49:16.640]  How do they make you want now?
[2:49:16.640 --> 2:49:18.800]  If you're doing dog training and humans are very similar
[2:49:18.800 --> 2:49:20.560]  to dogs, the Newell order Braggs and manuals
[2:49:20.560 --> 2:49:22.120]  that they train us like dogs,
[2:49:22.120 --> 2:49:25.240]  you act like you don't want the dog to have the chew toy.
[2:49:25.240 --> 2:49:29.880]  You want it to come after the chew toy.
[2:49:29.880 --> 2:49:32.080]  The chew toy is really poison.
[2:49:32.080 --> 2:49:36.520]  So all over they have them practice guarding these shots
[2:49:36.520 --> 2:49:38.360]  and you watch this will happen with your husband
[2:49:38.360 --> 2:49:39.720]  like it's some gold.
[2:49:39.720 --> 2:49:43.600]  That's to condition him to want to take the shots
[2:49:43.600 --> 2:49:46.080]  and to think of it as precious and wonderful
[2:49:46.080 --> 2:49:48.280]  because they have to make the first responders
[2:49:48.280 --> 2:49:50.400]  take the forced inoculations first
[2:49:50.400 --> 2:49:52.480]  so they will then force it on the public.
[2:49:52.480 --> 2:49:55.120]  And this has come out, we beat this five years ago.
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:49:58.040]  So then the next training down the road
[2:49:58.040 --> 2:50:01.000]  or maybe three layers in will be going
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:03.240]  and putting people on trucks and buses
[2:50:03.240 --> 2:50:04.960]  to take them to a sports stadium
[2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:06.640]  and they will have the role players
[2:50:06.640 --> 2:50:08.800]  generally played by their officers in the first phase
[2:50:08.800 --> 2:50:10.840]  saying I want that shot
[2:50:10.840 --> 2:50:13.640]  and practicing attacking police because they want the shot.
[2:50:13.640 --> 2:50:15.720]  Now in reality, the public's not gonna want the shot.
[2:50:15.720 --> 2:50:18.760]  And then that way the officers feel like it's a shot they want.
[2:50:18.760 --> 2:50:20.440]  It's a shot the public's gonna want.
[2:50:20.440 --> 2:50:22.640]  This is something precious.
[2:50:22.640 --> 2:50:23.480]  You understand?
[2:50:23.480 --> 2:50:25.640]  So this is psych warfare conditioning.
[2:50:25.640 --> 2:50:27.200]  Do you like being manipulated like that
[2:50:27.200 --> 2:50:29.040]  because they think you're stupid
[2:50:29.040 --> 2:50:30.720]  and I don't think you're stupid.
[2:50:30.720 --> 2:50:33.840]  No, no, my dad, he's been telling me the same things
[2:50:33.840 --> 2:50:37.480]  that you've been saying and because he's an un-veteran
[2:50:37.480 --> 2:50:41.000]  and he goes to the VA clinic and suffers insurance
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:44.200]  and he's like, I won't take any shots that they try to give me.
[2:50:44.200 --> 2:50:45.040]  I refuse them.
[2:50:45.040 --> 2:50:46.680]  I don't want them because he thinks you know
[2:50:46.680 --> 2:50:48.120]  that there's something in which there is.
[2:50:48.120 --> 2:50:49.720]  Officer, officer.
[2:50:49.720 --> 2:50:52.160]  Google cancer viruses and vaccines.
[2:50:52.160 --> 2:50:54.120]  You'll be mainstream news.
[2:50:54.120 --> 2:50:56.640]  Over 200 million Americans were injected with SV 40
[2:50:56.640 --> 2:50:58.120]  and they still put it in there.
[2:50:58.120 --> 2:51:00.960]  SV 40, it's deadly.
[2:51:00.960 --> 2:51:02.600]  Most cancer is viral.
[2:51:02.600 --> 2:51:04.520]  They discovered this over 100 years ago
[2:51:04.520 --> 2:51:07.440]  of that top scientist on mainline doctors.
[2:51:07.440 --> 2:51:08.840]  They found out it's viral.
[2:51:08.840 --> 2:51:12.480]  They implant all of us with time-delayed DNA,
[2:51:12.480 --> 2:51:16.880]  recombinant cancer viruses that activate around retirement
[2:51:18.240 --> 2:51:20.160]  because they don't want to pay you social spam.
[2:51:20.160 --> 2:51:21.000]  It's eugenics.
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:22.080]  Please look.
[2:51:22.080 --> 2:51:22.920]  Have you heard about how they tell you?
[2:51:22.920 --> 2:51:24.280]  Oh, I totally believe you.
[2:51:24.280 --> 2:51:27.600]  I just, I'm trying to wake other officers up to this,
[2:51:27.600 --> 2:51:30.720]  you know, and let them know that that's what's going on.
[2:51:30.720 --> 2:51:32.360]  You know, they are like you said,
[2:51:32.360 --> 2:51:34.080]  are just lulled into this dream state.
[2:51:34.080 --> 2:51:36.040]  Like, oh, we're the good guys.
[2:51:36.040 --> 2:51:37.120]  We're fighting the bad guys.
[2:51:37.120 --> 2:51:38.560]  But I try to let them know,
[2:51:38.560 --> 2:51:40.720]  I think they're gonna try to make us be the bad guys.
[2:51:40.720 --> 2:51:42.360]  And I'm not gonna go along with that.
[2:51:42.360 --> 2:51:43.640]  I'll die before I go in
[2:51:43.640 --> 2:51:45.920]  and I try to take another citizen of God.
[2:51:45.920 --> 2:51:46.760]  I'm not gonna go in.
[2:51:46.760 --> 2:51:47.600]  You know, this is incredible.
[2:51:47.600 --> 2:51:48.680]  We got Lindsay Williams,
[2:51:48.680 --> 2:51:50.800]  but I'm just gonna have to come back to you.
[2:51:50.800 --> 2:51:52.200]  Can we come back to you for a second?
[2:51:52.200 --> 2:51:53.200]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2:51:53.200 --> 2:51:54.040]  All right, good.
[2:51:54.040 --> 2:51:55.760]  Folks, police, don't laugh at me.
[2:51:55.760 --> 2:51:57.640]  They're injecting us all cancer.
[2:51:57.640 --> 2:52:00.240]  Please check it out for your own family, your own sake.
[2:52:01.440 --> 2:52:03.640]  Is your credit card debt out of control?
[2:52:03.640 --> 2:52:06.400]  Are you in over your head dealing with monthly payments?
[2:52:06.400 --> 2:52:07.800]  There's a powerful secret
[2:52:07.800 --> 2:52:10.200]  that credit card companies don't want you to know.

[2:52:13.440 --> 2:52:14.920]  for a fraction of what you owe,

[2:52:17.400 --> 2:52:19.440]  That's bad news for credit card companies,
[2:52:19.440 --> 2:52:21.040]  but it's great news for you.

[2:53:01.480 --> 2:53:03.720]  A day unlike any other in the long course
[2:53:03.720 --> 2:53:04.720]  of American history,
[2:53:04.720 --> 2:53:08.240]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:53:08.240 --> 2:53:10.920]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:53:10.920 --> 2:53:12.440]  But who is the enemy?
[2:53:12.440 --> 2:53:13.280]  Bin Laden.
[2:53:13.280 --> 2:53:14.360]  This is his MO.
[2:53:14.360 --> 2:53:15.600]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:53:15.600 --> 2:53:17.600]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:53:17.600 --> 2:53:19.680]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[2:53:19.680 --> 2:53:21.640]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[2:53:21.640 --> 2:53:24.680]  to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:53:24.680 --> 2:53:26.160]  Some U.S. investigators believe
[2:53:26.160 --> 2:53:28.720]  that there are Israelis again very much engaged
[2:53:28.720 --> 2:53:31.520]  in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:53:31.520 --> 2:53:35.360]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:53:35.360 --> 2:53:37.160]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[2:53:37.160 --> 2:53:39.120]  the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[2:53:39.120 --> 2:53:40.600]  the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:53:40.600 --> 2:53:42.200]  the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:53:42.200 --> 2:53:43.360]  warnings in war games,
[2:53:43.360 --> 2:53:44.280]  the shadow government,
[2:53:44.280 --> 2:53:45.480]  and much, much more.

[2:53:56.480 --> 2:53:58.280]  or you are with the terrorists.
[2:54:01.880 --> 2:54:03.640]  How many times have you been in the dark
[2:54:03.640 --> 2:54:05.240]  looking for a flashlight?
[2:54:05.240 --> 2:54:07.360]  Only to find the one that you have is broken.
[2:54:07.360 --> 2:54:08.320]  The batteries are dead,
[2:54:08.320 --> 2:54:09.960]  or it's just not bright enough.
[2:54:09.960 --> 2:54:11.600]  You need the pack light.
[2:54:11.600 --> 2:54:13.960]  The pack light is the longest-lasting flashlight
[2:54:13.960 --> 2:54:14.800]  on the market,
[2:54:14.800 --> 2:54:17.480]  and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery,
[2:54:17.480 --> 2:54:19.760]  and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[2:54:19.760 --> 2:54:21.720]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket,
[2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:23.360]  car, garage, and home.
[2:54:23.360 --> 2:54:25.800]  The pack light can survive severe impact,
[2:54:25.800 --> 2:54:28.200]  be frozen solid and still work flawlessly.
[2:54:28.200 --> 2:54:29.680]  The pack light is so durable.
[2:54:29.680 --> 2:54:31.280]  Soldiers overseas rely on them,
[2:54:31.280 --> 2:54:33.000]  and has been featured in the New York Times
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:34.600]  and Backpacker magazine.
[2:54:34.600 --> 2:54:36.800]  The pack light comes with a 25-year warranty,
[2:54:36.800 --> 2:54:39.240]  and prices startages $12.99.

[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:43.560]  just how incredible this small flashlight can be,

[2:55:01.520 --> 2:55:04.240]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[2:55:04.240 --> 2:55:07.440]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:55:11.560 --> 2:55:13.120]  Listen to me, folks.
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:14.720]  I know it's hard to believe
[2:55:14.720 --> 2:55:17.440]  they put cancer viruses in the vaccines and mercury.
[2:55:17.440 --> 2:55:19.320]  It's on record they do.
[2:55:19.320 --> 2:55:20.560]  All you gotta do is Google it,
[2:55:20.560 --> 2:55:22.440]  mainstream news, government documents.
[2:55:22.440 --> 2:55:24.840]  They've caught the U.N. sterilizing women.
[2:55:24.840 --> 2:55:27.600]  That's mainstream news, adding key pathogen
[2:55:27.600 --> 2:55:30.120]  that combines with the tetanus shot
[2:55:30.120 --> 2:55:31.960]  for an autoimmune response
[2:55:31.960 --> 2:55:36.240]  that destroys the key sexual organs and their fertility.
[2:55:36.240 --> 2:55:37.160]  It's eugenics.
[2:55:37.160 --> 2:55:38.400]  Everything is eugenics.
[2:55:38.400 --> 2:55:40.560]  Hitler got his ideas from the U.S. and England.
[2:55:40.560 --> 2:55:43.520]  The scientific community basically all believed this.
[2:55:43.520 --> 2:55:45.640]  My film in-game covers it.
[2:55:45.640 --> 2:55:48.040]  I had to get past my fear when I read these documents.
[2:55:48.040 --> 2:55:50.360]  I mean, it is bracing, it is shaking.
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:53.320]  There had been times years ago,
[2:55:53.320 --> 2:55:54.160]  I don't really do it anymore,
[2:55:54.160 --> 2:55:55.480]  where I would just sit down in the night
[2:55:55.480 --> 2:55:57.720]  and couldn't even cry.
[2:55:57.720 --> 2:55:59.800]  But tears would just, you know, like I wasn't retching,
[2:55:59.800 --> 2:56:02.400]  but tears would just start pouring out.
[2:56:02.400 --> 2:56:04.640]  I mean, it is, and I have to face them.
[2:56:04.640 --> 2:56:07.160]  I have to go up against these people.
[2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:08.280]  I have to, because, you know,
[2:56:08.280 --> 2:56:10.120]  I know they've killed so many, set so many up
[2:56:10.120 --> 2:56:13.280]  because we can't let them keep doing this.
[2:56:13.280 --> 2:56:14.120]  It's real.
[2:56:14.120 --> 2:56:15.400]  Lindsay Williams is coming up in five minutes.
[2:56:15.400 --> 2:56:16.360]  I'll be with us for 45 minutes
[2:56:16.360 --> 2:56:18.800]  and I have a state rep popping in for 10.
[2:56:18.800 --> 2:56:21.240]  And I'm gonna get Lindsay back on again very, very soon.
[2:56:21.240 --> 2:56:22.520]  We appreciate Lindsay Williams being there.
[2:56:22.520 --> 2:56:23.520]  Everything he's been saying
[2:56:23.520 --> 2:56:25.720]  has been proven to be documented in triple kit.
[2:56:25.720 --> 2:56:28.920]  But officer, is it a EV or a Eve?
[2:56:28.920 --> 2:56:29.760]  It's EV.
[2:56:29.760 --> 2:56:30.600]  EV.
[2:56:30.600 --> 2:56:31.440]  Yes.
[2:56:31.440 --> 2:56:32.520]  I do different spellings here on my screen.
[2:56:32.520 --> 2:56:33.360]  Sorry.
[2:56:33.360 --> 2:56:37.480]  Anything else as an officer in Illinois that,
[2:56:37.480 --> 2:56:39.320]  that, I mean, you're concerned,
[2:56:39.320 --> 2:56:40.920]  you're trying to reach out to other officers,
[2:56:40.920 --> 2:56:42.880]  or are you scared to?
[2:56:42.880 --> 2:56:44.200]  What's happening?
[2:56:44.200 --> 2:56:45.800]  Well, I mean, I have a little scared
[2:56:45.800 --> 2:56:48.040]  because, you know, they don't want you to, you know,
[2:56:48.040 --> 2:56:49.480]  be informed of what's going on.
[2:56:49.480 --> 2:56:51.600]  But yeah, I really just want officers to do,
[2:56:51.600 --> 2:56:53.000]  like what you said, go on YouTube,
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:55.040]  do, you know, Google these things and,
[2:56:55.040 --> 2:56:55.880]  and look into it.
[2:56:55.880 --> 2:56:58.520]  I mean, like I've been telling my husband,
[2:56:58.520 --> 2:57:00.200]  you don't have to take anyone's word for it.
[2:57:00.200 --> 2:57:01.680]  You can see it on paper, you know,
[2:57:01.680 --> 2:57:04.240]  in print from the news that you rely
[2:57:04.240 --> 2:57:05.960]  on probably other information, you know,
[2:57:05.960 --> 2:57:09.360]  and, you know, he's, he's been looking into it.
[2:57:09.360 --> 2:57:11.240]  And, you know, I think he's coming around.
[2:57:11.240 --> 2:57:13.680]  I just think his, his problem is, is,
[2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:15.480]  he's wanted to be a police officer his whole life.
[2:57:15.480 --> 2:57:16.600]  And, you know, he's kind of, you know,
[2:57:16.600 --> 2:57:18.440]  disappointed and shocked and sad
[2:57:18.440 --> 2:57:19.880]  that it's going to come to this.
[2:57:19.880 --> 2:57:21.280]  And he's probably going to have to, you know,
[2:57:21.280 --> 2:57:22.120]  give it up.
[2:57:22.120 --> 2:57:24.280]  But, you know, on the other hand, we have two children.
[2:57:24.280 --> 2:57:26.200]  So that really comes before anything.
[2:57:26.200 --> 2:57:29.520]  And, and, you know, we're, I want my freedom.
[2:57:29.520 --> 2:57:31.840]  You know, my family from, from the South.
[2:57:31.840 --> 2:57:33.600]  And, you know, I think that everyone should be able
[2:57:33.600 --> 2:57:34.440]  to carry a gun.
[2:57:34.440 --> 2:57:36.000]  I believe in concealed carry.
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:37.240]  And I support it.
[2:57:37.240 --> 2:57:38.720]  I'm an officer and I support it.
[2:57:38.720 --> 2:57:40.280]  I totally agree with you.
[2:57:40.280 --> 2:57:41.640]  You talk about Chicago.
[2:57:41.640 --> 2:57:42.720]  Look at what goes on there.
[2:57:42.720 --> 2:57:44.160]  I mean, I have a lot of officers
[2:57:44.160 --> 2:57:46.240]  that are friends that are in Chicago,
[2:57:46.240 --> 2:57:48.960]  they're officers and they think, you know,
[2:57:48.960 --> 2:57:50.560]  these people knew that the citizen
[2:57:50.560 --> 2:57:52.600]  that they were coming on to try to do something to
[2:57:52.600 --> 2:57:53.440]  might be armed.
[2:57:53.440 --> 2:57:54.920]  Maybe they might stop and not do it.
[2:57:54.920 --> 2:57:56.680]  Or, you know, maybe they think twice about it
[2:57:56.680 --> 2:57:57.800]  or get blown away.
[2:57:57.800 --> 2:58:00.680]  Well, maybe they've done polls of officers nationwide
[2:58:00.680 --> 2:58:03.760]  and upwards of 97% are pro-second amendment.
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:05.040]  They're good people.
[2:58:05.040 --> 2:58:06.800]  But it's the police chiefs that are bought
[2:58:06.800 --> 2:58:07.720]  and paid for by the globalists.
[2:58:07.720 --> 2:58:11.440]  Now, this is another example of what I'm talking about.
[2:58:11.440 --> 2:58:12.840]  A microcosm of it.
[2:58:12.840 --> 2:58:14.440]  That's why they train the troops.
[2:58:14.440 --> 2:58:16.080]  Oh, the army's here to help at checkpoints
[2:58:16.080 --> 2:58:16.920]  to stop drunks.
[2:58:16.920 --> 2:58:18.640]  Well, that's reasonable to stop drunks.
[2:58:18.640 --> 2:58:21.320]  Then the precedent set, then it's for gun confiscation.
[2:58:21.320 --> 2:58:23.320]  All of this, officers need to recognize
[2:58:23.320 --> 2:58:24.680]  how they're being manipulated.
[2:58:24.680 --> 2:58:27.360]  They need to recognize and understand we made films,
[2:58:27.360 --> 2:58:29.000]  you know, a decade ago, 12 years ago,
[2:58:29.000 --> 2:58:30.640]  documenting what would now happen.
[2:58:30.640 --> 2:58:32.280]  That we're not making this up.
[2:58:32.280 --> 2:58:34.400]  We're taking incredible risks to tell you this,
[2:58:34.400 --> 2:58:36.600]  but it's a greater risk not to fight it
[2:58:36.600 --> 2:58:38.000]  and not to go up against it.
[2:58:38.000 --> 2:58:40.280]  Had you ever tried to call in before?
[2:58:40.280 --> 2:58:42.040]  No, no, this is the first time I tried to call.
[2:58:42.040 --> 2:58:43.960]  I was really shocked I got through.
[2:58:43.960 --> 2:58:46.200]  Yeah, well, usually I have all these police and military.
[2:58:46.200 --> 2:58:47.440]  I have all these police and military
[2:58:47.440 --> 2:58:49.160]  that email me saying they can never get through.
[2:58:49.160 --> 2:58:50.160]  I'm glad you got through.
[2:58:50.160 --> 2:58:51.840]  We're gonna start having some days
[2:58:51.840 --> 2:58:53.680]  where only police and military can call in
[2:58:53.680 --> 2:58:55.800]  so they can get in and give us the intel
[2:58:55.800 --> 2:58:57.160]  and tell us what they're seeing and what's happening.
[2:58:57.160 --> 2:58:59.400]  I don't think it's his decision
[2:58:59.400 --> 2:59:01.840]  that your husband needs to leave the force.
[2:59:01.840 --> 2:59:04.200]  He needs to, within the law, within the constitution,
[2:59:04.200 --> 2:59:08.080]  read that, follow that, and start speaking out against it.
[2:59:08.080 --> 2:59:09.720]  You know, start talking about it,
[2:59:09.720 --> 2:59:12.080]  or covertly expose what's happening.
[2:59:12.080 --> 2:59:13.920]  He can choose the way, I mean, see,
[2:59:13.920 --> 2:59:15.640]  as good people find out about the evil,
[2:59:15.640 --> 2:59:18.000]  they all leave the military and police
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:20.400]  and they hire the illegal aliens, the felons,
[2:59:20.400 --> 2:59:22.440]  the foreigners to fill up the ranks.
[2:59:22.440 --> 2:59:26.800]  So it's a catch-22, but you don't need to leave.
[2:59:26.800 --> 2:59:29.320]  I mean, you're on the ground, you know better than I.
[2:59:29.320 --> 2:59:30.720]  You just need to gauge what's happening.
[2:59:30.720 --> 2:59:31.560]  God bless you.
[2:59:31.560 --> 2:59:33.440]  Good to have you on with this, Evie, okay?
[2:59:33.440 --> 2:59:34.880]  Yeah, my car, I appreciate it.
[2:59:34.880 --> 2:59:35.760]  God bless you, take care.
[2:59:35.760 --> 2:59:39.920]  That's a good peace officer, a guardian of the people.
[2:59:42.920 --> 2:59:46.080]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:59:46.080 --> 2:59:48.240]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:59:51.320 --> 2:59:52.960]  Hello, friends, this is Alex Jones.
[2:59:52.960 --> 2:59:54.360]  I've told you for a long time
[2:59:54.360 --> 2:59:55.960]  it's important to be self-sufficient,
[2:59:55.960 --> 2:59:57.720]  and today that's more important than ever.
[2:59:57.720 --> 2:59:58.920]  We need to be independent,
[2:59:58.920 --> 3:00:00.720]  and food and water is the key.
[3:00:00.720 --> 3:00:02.480]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line
[3:00:02.480 --> 3:00:03.800]  until you have your own bread.
[3:00:03.800 --> 3:00:05.440]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome
[3:00:05.440 --> 3:00:07.520]  and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[3:00:07.520 --> 3:00:09.800]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[3:00:09.800 --> 3:00:11.480]  No one is gonna take care of your family
[3:00:11.480 --> 3:00:13.040]  in the final equation between you.
[3:00:13.040 --> 3:00:15.080]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able
[3:00:15.080 --> 3:00:16.560]  to shift horrible food that's safe
[3:00:16.560 --> 3:00:19.040]  from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration,
[3:00:19.040 --> 3:00:20.560]  or Chinese imports, and they do it
[3:00:20.560 --> 3:00:23.320]  at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[3:00:47.200 --> 3:00:49.280]  The first step is getting storable food.
[3:00:54.040 --> 3:00:56.360]  Waging war on corruption.
[3:00:56.360 --> 3:00:59.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:59.360 --> 3:01:19.360]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are here back live
[3:01:19.360 --> 3:01:20.360]  for the next 45 minutes.
[3:01:20.360 --> 3:01:21.360]  Lindsay Williams joins us.
[3:01:21.360 --> 3:01:22.360]  We have a state rep popping in,
[3:01:22.360 --> 3:01:23.360]  another state declaring sovereignty.
[3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:25.360]  It's going to be joining us.
[3:01:25.360 --> 3:01:28.360]  George Soros at the World Economic Forum a few weeks ago,
[3:01:28.360 --> 3:01:29.360]  the video just surfaced.
[3:01:29.360 --> 3:01:30.360]  It was on international television.
[3:01:30.360 --> 3:01:33.360]  We just found it last week.
[3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:35.360]  Says, yes, we're staging the, you know,
[3:01:35.360 --> 3:01:38.360]  oil implosion price to bring down Venezuela,
[3:01:38.360 --> 3:01:41.360]  bring down Russia, bring down the Arabs.
[3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:42.360]  They're also imploding the markets
[3:01:42.360 --> 3:01:44.360]  so they can consolidate it.
[3:01:44.360 --> 3:01:45.360]  Everything that we separately had
[3:01:45.360 --> 3:01:48.360]  from our infiltration of Bilderberg in 2006,
[3:01:48.360 --> 3:01:49.360]  laying on everything that was going to happen,
[3:01:49.360 --> 3:01:51.360]  integrates with his oil company executive
[3:01:51.360 --> 3:01:53.360]  he worked with for many years,
[3:01:53.360 --> 3:01:55.360]  telling him about this.
[3:01:55.360 --> 3:01:58.360]  He predicted when the fuel was at $148, $149,
[3:01:58.360 --> 3:01:59.360]  the barrel that would drop below 50,
[3:01:59.360 --> 3:02:03.360]  it's gone as low as $33, a barrel that's at about 40 right now.
[3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:05.360]  Again, to bankrupt all these oil rich nations
[3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:07.360]  and bring in a worldwide depression.
[3:02:07.360 --> 3:02:10.360]  Lindsay Williams, it is a great honor to have you back on with us
[3:02:10.360 --> 3:02:13.360]  and we appreciate you spending time with us today.
[3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:15.360]  Thank you, Alex, so much for letting me be with you today
[3:02:15.360 --> 3:02:16.360]  for an update.
[3:02:16.360 --> 3:02:19.360]  You know, even though I lived with the elite of the world
[3:02:19.360 --> 3:02:22.360]  for three years time, I still sit back,
[3:02:22.360 --> 3:02:25.360]  utterly dumbfounded and amazed how these people
[3:02:25.360 --> 3:02:28.360]  have the power to do exactly what they're going to do,
[3:02:28.360 --> 3:02:31.360]  say they're going to do and do it,
[3:02:31.360 --> 3:02:37.360]  and do it meticulously exactly like they said they were going to.
[3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:40.360]  And, you know, Missouri is the show me state
[3:02:40.360 --> 3:02:41.360]  or put up and shut up.
[3:02:41.360 --> 3:02:43.360]  Everything you've told us over the years
[3:02:43.360 --> 3:02:45.360]  has all turned out exactly as you said
[3:02:45.360 --> 3:02:47.360]  because you wrote a book 20-something years ago,
[3:02:47.360 --> 3:02:49.360]  you worked with these people, you still know them,
[3:02:49.360 --> 3:02:51.360]  just like we can infiltrate Bilderberg
[3:02:51.360 --> 3:02:53.360]  without exactly what's going to happen
[3:02:53.360 --> 3:02:55.360]  because of the globalist rule
[3:02:55.360 --> 3:02:57.360]  and they're bringing us into a worldwide depression.
[3:02:57.360 --> 3:02:59.360]  Recap what he told you, then let's get into
[3:02:59.360 --> 3:03:02.360]  why would Soros come out and admit everything you said.
[3:03:02.360 --> 3:03:05.360]  Well, approximately seven months ago, I had a phone call.
[3:03:05.360 --> 3:03:08.360]  The phone call was for the purpose of telling me,
[3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:11.360]  you've said too much, either be quiet or we're going to take action.
[3:03:11.360 --> 3:03:13.360]  And the action that they gave me
[3:03:13.360 --> 3:03:16.360]  and the choice they gave me wasn't too pleasant.
[3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:20.360]  So I agreed with what he said for my website,
[3:03:20.360 --> 3:03:23.360]  withdrew my DVD, changed everything around,
[3:03:23.360 --> 3:03:25.360]  but that's not the important part.
[3:03:25.360 --> 3:03:26.360]  The important part was after that,
[3:03:26.360 --> 3:03:28.360]  I had not seen this man for 25 years.
[3:03:28.360 --> 3:03:29.360]  I know who he is.
[3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:31.360]  He's 82 years of age now.
[3:03:31.360 --> 3:03:33.360]  He knows everything that the elite are doing
[3:03:33.360 --> 3:03:35.360]  and everything that goes on behind closed doors.
[3:03:35.360 --> 3:03:37.360]  So I decided to be friendly.
[3:03:37.360 --> 3:03:39.360]  I asked him how you're family,
[3:03:39.360 --> 3:03:41.360]  how you've been doing, where you've been living.
[3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:44.360]  He would, he really, I was amazed
[3:03:44.360 --> 3:03:47.360]  how kind and nice he became all of a sudden.
[3:03:47.360 --> 3:03:50.360]  And for the next 45 minutes time,
[3:03:50.360 --> 3:03:53.360]  he told me everything that the elite plan to do
[3:03:53.360 --> 3:03:55.360]  on the face of the earth over the next year,
[3:03:55.360 --> 3:03:56.360]  to a year and a half.
[3:03:56.360 --> 3:04:00.360]  And at that time, crude oil was $147 a barrel
[3:04:00.360 --> 3:04:02.360]  and nobody would have ever,
[3:04:02.360 --> 3:04:04.360]  in the fargest imagination would have guessed
[3:04:04.360 --> 3:04:06.360]  that it was going to $50 a barrel.
[3:04:06.360 --> 3:04:09.360]  Oh, definitely not the $33 a barrel,
[3:04:09.360 --> 3:04:10.360]  which has been at slow.
[3:04:10.360 --> 3:04:13.360]  He said crude oil is going to $250 a barrel.
[3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:15.360]  I was done, found it immediately.
[3:04:15.360 --> 3:04:18.360]  I asked him, I said, why are you doing this?
[3:04:18.360 --> 3:04:21.360]  He was as bold as the day was long.
[3:04:21.360 --> 3:04:24.360]  And there again, Alex, nobody would have guessed
[3:04:24.360 --> 3:04:27.360]  that the OPEC oil producing countries of the world
[3:04:27.360 --> 3:04:30.360]  would have ever gone bankrupt.
[3:04:30.360 --> 3:04:33.360]  I mean, this was unthinkable, but it has.
[3:04:33.360 --> 3:04:36.360]  They are on the verge of bankruptcy right now
[3:04:36.360 --> 3:04:38.360]  and they say that unless they can get crude oil
[3:04:38.360 --> 3:04:40.360]  back up to above $80 a barrel,
[3:04:40.360 --> 3:04:42.360]  that they're going to have major financial problems.
[3:04:42.360 --> 3:04:45.360]  They've stopped buying our T-Bills, our Treasury Bills
[3:04:45.360 --> 3:04:46.360]  as a result.
[3:04:46.360 --> 3:04:48.360]  The dollar is in drastic trouble.
[3:04:48.360 --> 3:04:51.360]  The average American has not the slightest idea.
[3:04:51.360 --> 3:04:54.360]  Well, did he went on to say that the price of gasoline
[3:04:54.360 --> 3:04:57.360]  is going to $1.50 to $2 a gallon gas pump?
[3:04:57.360 --> 3:05:00.360]  But then he said it's going to stay there.
[3:05:00.360 --> 3:05:02.360]  And I gathered a year to a year and a half
[3:05:02.360 --> 3:05:04.360]  to keep it there in order to accomplish
[3:05:04.360 --> 3:05:05.360]  what they want to accomplish.
[3:05:05.360 --> 3:05:08.360]  Now, let me show you, I'm going to begin if I may.
[3:05:08.360 --> 3:05:10.360]  I'll make this update as fast as I can
[3:05:10.360 --> 3:05:12.360]  because no one got 45 minutes.
[3:05:12.360 --> 3:05:14.360]  So forgive me if I thought fast.
[3:05:14.360 --> 3:05:16.360]  But there's so much happened since I was with you a week
[3:05:16.360 --> 3:05:18.360]  or a week and a half ago, Alex,
[3:05:18.360 --> 3:05:20.360]  until I'm going to get in everything I can
[3:05:20.360 --> 3:05:23.360]  and thank you so much for letting me be with you.
[3:05:23.360 --> 3:05:25.360]  And the last few moments,
[3:05:25.360 --> 3:05:27.360]  I'm going to give what's happening to the farmers of America.
[3:05:27.360 --> 3:05:29.360]  And if nothing else bothers you,
[3:05:29.360 --> 3:05:31.360]  this one's going to wake you up.
[3:05:31.360 --> 3:05:33.360]  So you've got to have your pencil and paper handy
[3:05:33.360 --> 3:05:34.360]  because here we go.
[3:05:34.360 --> 3:05:36.360]  All right, Lindsey Williams, we've got a break.
[3:05:36.360 --> 3:05:37.360]  Come right back out.
[3:05:37.360 --> 3:05:39.360]  Give us all the latest info.
[3:05:39.360 --> 3:05:42.360]  Talk about why you believe Soros has gone public,
[3:05:42.360 --> 3:05:44.360]  admitting what you're saying
[3:05:44.360 --> 3:05:46.360]  at the public Bilderberg Group meeting,
[3:05:46.360 --> 3:05:48.360]  the Davos Switzerland World Economic Forum.
[3:05:48.360 --> 3:05:50.360]  He's Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[3:05:50.360 --> 3:05:52.360]  This is inside Bilderberg Group.
[3:05:52.360 --> 3:05:55.360]  New World Order level intelligence

[3:06:01.360 --> 3:06:02.360]  Detoxify.

[3:06:05.360 --> 3:06:07.360]  to cleanse your body of dangerous toxins.
[3:06:07.360 --> 3:06:09.360]  You are also being reminded that it's important

[3:06:11.360 --> 3:06:13.360]  will provide safe and effective results.
[3:06:13.360 --> 3:06:15.360]  It's time to clear the air and clear your body
[3:06:15.360 --> 3:06:17.360]  with safe and effective chelormax.

[3:06:26.360 --> 3:06:28.360]  bromine and chloride.

[3:06:59.360 --> 3:07:01.360]  From a doctor you can trust.
[3:07:01.360 --> 3:07:03.360]  A day unlike any other in the long course
[3:07:03.360 --> 3:07:06.360]  of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:07:06.360 --> 3:07:08.360]  against this country.
[3:07:08.360 --> 3:07:10.360]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:07:10.360 --> 3:07:12.360]  But who is the enemy?
[3:07:12.360 --> 3:07:13.360]  Bin Laden.
[3:07:13.360 --> 3:07:14.360]  This is his MO.
[3:07:14.360 --> 3:07:15.360]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:07:15.360 --> 3:07:17.360]  We have to look to some of Bin Laden.
[3:07:17.360 --> 3:07:19.360]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[3:07:19.360 --> 3:07:21.360]  to take a close look at the terrorist
[3:07:21.360 --> 3:07:24.360]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:07:24.360 --> 3:07:26.360]  Some U.S. investigators believe that
[3:07:26.360 --> 3:07:28.360]  there are Israelis again very much engaged
[3:07:28.360 --> 3:07:31.360]  in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:07:31.360 --> 3:07:35.360]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:07:35.360 --> 3:07:37.360]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[3:07:37.360 --> 3:07:39.360]  the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[3:07:39.360 --> 3:07:40.360]  the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:07:40.360 --> 3:07:42.360]  the Israeli intelligence network,
[3:07:42.360 --> 3:07:43.360]  warnings in war games,
[3:07:43.360 --> 3:07:44.360]  the shadow government,
[3:07:44.360 --> 3:07:45.360]  and much, much more.

[3:08:58.360 --> 3:09:01.360]  for all of your self-defense needs today.
[3:09:01.360 --> 3:09:04.360]  It's a sudden reversal of fortunes
[3:09:04.360 --> 3:09:06.360]  for the oil producing countries.
[3:09:06.360 --> 3:09:10.360]  And in the Gulf states,
[3:09:10.360 --> 3:09:15.360]  you have quite a few bubbles popping.
[3:09:15.360 --> 3:09:19.360]  Dubai was probably the biggest
[3:09:19.360 --> 3:09:21.360]  real estate bubble in the world.
[3:09:21.360 --> 3:09:24.360]  And it's now bursting.
[3:09:24.360 --> 3:09:27.360]  However, it's not all bad news
[3:09:27.360 --> 3:09:30.360]  because the major oil producing countries
[3:09:30.360 --> 3:09:33.360]  have been the enemies of the prevailing world order,
[3:09:33.360 --> 3:09:37.360]  Venezuela, Iran, Russia.
[3:09:37.360 --> 3:09:40.360]  And it's not so easy to finance
[3:09:40.360 --> 3:09:44.360]  a Bolivarian revolution with $40 oil.
[3:09:44.360 --> 3:09:46.360]  So I think Venezuela,
[3:09:46.360 --> 3:09:50.360]  Chavez, probably his days are numbered.
[3:09:50.360 --> 3:09:51.360]  And in Iran,
[3:09:51.360 --> 3:09:55.360]  I think that he's not going to last a year.
[3:09:55.360 --> 3:09:57.360]  I may be wrong,
[3:09:57.360 --> 3:09:59.360]  but I mean he's under considerable duress
[3:09:59.360 --> 3:10:02.360]  and his influence is going to decline.
[3:10:02.360 --> 3:10:04.360]  In Iran,
[3:10:04.360 --> 3:10:08.360]  Ahmadinejad is up for elections in 09.
[3:10:08.360 --> 3:10:13.360]  And unless he can provoke some incident
[3:10:13.360 --> 3:10:18.360]  or I think that he's liable to also be defeated
[3:10:18.360 --> 3:10:21.360]  may have a more reasonable regime.
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:25.360]  Now, Russia is more troubling
[3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:34.360]  because Putin has been using oil
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:38.360]  for a number of reasons to reestablish
[3:10:38.360 --> 3:10:41.360]  Russia's geopolitical influence
[3:10:41.360 --> 3:10:43.360]  to enrich the rulers,
[3:10:43.360 --> 3:10:45.360]  to maintain themselves in power
[3:10:45.360 --> 3:10:48.360]  and to bribe the rulers of the neighboring countries
[3:10:48.360 --> 3:10:51.360]  to gain control over their gas.
[3:10:51.360 --> 3:10:55.360]  But through the success,
[3:10:55.360 --> 3:10:57.360]  he was very popular.
[3:10:57.360 --> 3:11:04.360]  And now suddenly you have had
[3:11:04.360 --> 3:11:06.360]  financial collapse,
[3:11:06.360 --> 3:11:09.360]  inflation, ruble falling,
[3:11:09.360 --> 3:11:12.360]  living standards falling.
[3:11:12.360 --> 3:11:15.360]  And there is a danger
[3:11:15.360 --> 3:11:18.360]  that he will be more adventurous
[3:11:18.360 --> 3:11:22.360]  trying to have some foreign adventure,
[3:11:22.360 --> 3:11:25.360]  Ukraine, whatever,
[3:11:25.360 --> 3:11:27.360]  to divert attention.
[3:11:27.360 --> 3:11:29.360]  I'm afraid we have to end it there.
[3:11:29.360 --> 3:11:30.360]  George saw us and liked it.
[3:11:30.360 --> 3:11:31.360]  Thank you very much.
[3:11:31.360 --> 3:11:32.360]  We didn't get to China,
[3:11:32.360 --> 3:11:33.360]  but we heard lots about Russia.
[3:11:33.360 --> 3:11:35.360]  That is George Saw.
[3:11:35.360 --> 3:11:36.360]  Now remember,
[3:11:36.360 --> 3:11:38.360]  Lindsey Williams,
[3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:40.360]  months before they snuck attack
[3:11:40.360 --> 3:11:42.360]  Russia-controlled territory in Georgia,
[3:11:42.360 --> 3:11:44.360]  held since the early 90s,
[3:11:44.360 --> 3:11:47.360]  historically part of Russia.
[3:11:47.360 --> 3:11:49.360]  He said they're also going to start stuff with Russia.
[3:11:49.360 --> 3:11:51.360]  No one was even talking about that.
[3:11:51.360 --> 3:11:52.360]  That just came out of the clear blue one morning,
[3:11:52.360 --> 3:11:54.360]  but Lindsey was right.
[3:11:54.360 --> 3:11:56.360]  I played that, Lindsey Williams,
[3:11:56.360 --> 3:11:58.360]  because I wanted to, you know,
[3:11:58.360 --> 3:12:00.360]  have you be able to comment
[3:12:00.360 --> 3:12:01.360]  before we get into the latest developments
[3:12:01.360 --> 3:12:03.360]  on why do you think the elite
[3:12:03.360 --> 3:12:04.360]  are now basically admitting
[3:12:04.360 --> 3:12:06.360]  everything that you were saying,
[3:12:06.360 --> 3:12:07.360]  but you said it before.
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:09.360]  It was even announced or it even happened.
[3:12:09.360 --> 3:12:10.360]  Well, Alex, you have to understand,
[3:12:10.360 --> 3:12:12.360]  I'm just an ordinary everyday guy.
[3:12:12.360 --> 3:12:13.360]  I put on my virtues
[3:12:13.360 --> 3:12:15.360]  just like every other man every morning,
[3:12:15.360 --> 3:12:17.360]  but by the providence of God
[3:12:17.360 --> 3:12:18.360]  numbers of years ago,
[3:12:18.360 --> 3:12:20.360]  I had the privilege of living with the elite
[3:12:20.360 --> 3:12:21.360]  of the world for three years.
[3:12:21.360 --> 3:12:22.360]  As a result,
[3:12:22.360 --> 3:12:24.360]  I've kept in touch with some of them,
[3:12:24.360 --> 3:12:27.360]  and they have kept in touch with me sometimes
[3:12:27.360 --> 3:12:30.360]  over these past 35 years.
[3:12:30.360 --> 3:12:32.360]  They knew in advance,
[3:12:32.360 --> 3:12:34.360]  Alex, folks, I plead with you,
[3:12:34.360 --> 3:12:37.360]  everybody out in this audience today,
[3:12:37.360 --> 3:12:41.360]  I beg of you, please listen and believe
[3:12:41.360 --> 3:12:44.360]  every word Alex Jones is saying.
[3:12:44.360 --> 3:12:46.360]  He has tried to tell you for years
[3:12:46.360 --> 3:12:48.360]  that there is a group of elite,
[3:12:48.360 --> 3:12:50.360]  and let me say as emphatically
[3:12:50.360 --> 3:12:52.360]  as I humanly possibly can,
[3:12:52.360 --> 3:12:55.360]  there positively is a group of people
[3:12:55.360 --> 3:12:56.360]  on the face of this earth
[3:12:56.360 --> 3:12:57.360]  who control the world,
[3:12:57.360 --> 3:13:00.360]  and they knew a year to two years ago
[3:13:00.360 --> 3:13:02.360]  everything is taking place
[3:13:02.360 --> 3:13:03.360]  in the financial world right now.
[3:13:03.360 --> 3:13:05.360]  They knew they were going to take the price
[3:13:05.360 --> 3:13:07.360]  of crude oil from $147 a barrel
[3:13:07.360 --> 3:13:09.360]  to $50 a barrel.
[3:13:09.360 --> 3:13:11.360]  It was all planned in advance.
[3:13:11.360 --> 3:13:13.360]  This is not something that just happened
[3:13:13.360 --> 3:13:15.360]  out of a clear blue sky.
[3:13:15.360 --> 3:13:16.360]  I don't know whether George Soros
[3:13:16.360 --> 3:13:18.360]  knew it back then or not,
[3:13:18.360 --> 3:13:20.360]  but I know that seven months ago
[3:13:20.360 --> 3:13:22.360]  I was told it by one of these individuals
[3:13:22.360 --> 3:13:25.360]  who knows everything that goes on behind closed doors,
[3:13:25.360 --> 3:13:27.360]  so let me show you exactly what has happened
[3:13:27.360 --> 3:13:30.360]  in the past seven days,
[3:13:30.360 --> 3:13:31.360]  seven to nine days maybe.
[3:13:31.360 --> 3:13:32.360]  Okay, first of all,
[3:13:32.360 --> 3:13:35.360]  Dubai, last weekend,
[3:13:35.360 --> 3:13:36.360]  and George Soros just mentioned that.
[3:13:36.360 --> 3:13:38.360]  I'm so glad you played that, Alex.
[3:13:38.360 --> 3:13:39.360]  Thank you.
[3:13:39.360 --> 3:13:40.360]  Last weekend,
[3:13:40.360 --> 3:13:42.360]  Dubai, of all things,
[3:13:42.360 --> 3:13:45.360]  one of the opaque oil producing countries of the world,
[3:13:45.360 --> 3:13:48.360]  building that beautiful five-star city,
[3:13:48.360 --> 3:13:51.360]  Dubai, borrowed last weekend $10 billion
[3:13:51.360 --> 3:13:53.360]  on five-year onto-cured bonds,
[3:13:53.360 --> 3:13:56.360]  and they say that within another week's time
[3:13:56.360 --> 3:13:58.360]  they're going to have to borrow another $10 billion.
[3:13:58.360 --> 3:14:01.360]  They have canceled their concrete contract
[3:14:01.360 --> 3:14:04.360]  with an American company that was supplying the concrete
[3:14:04.360 --> 3:14:06.360]  for that beautiful five-star city,
[3:14:06.360 --> 3:14:11.360]  and sitting on the airport parking lot in Dubai City
[3:14:11.360 --> 3:14:16.360]  today are approximately 3,000 abandoned automobiles.
[3:14:16.360 --> 3:14:17.360]  Why?
[3:14:17.360 --> 3:14:18.360]  You see, in Dubai,
[3:14:18.360 --> 3:14:20.360]  if you don't make the automobile payment,
[3:14:20.360 --> 3:14:21.360]  oh, yes, they did.
[3:14:21.360 --> 3:14:24.360]  These workers went from around the world to Dubai
[3:14:24.360 --> 3:14:25.360]  to make their fortune,
[3:14:25.360 --> 3:14:27.360]  building that beautiful five-star city
[3:14:27.360 --> 3:14:29.360]  that there's never been anything like it
[3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:30.360]  on the face of the earth.
[3:14:30.360 --> 3:14:31.360]  They bought Mercedes.
[3:14:31.360 --> 3:14:33.360]  They bought Rolls Royces.
[3:14:33.360 --> 3:14:34.360]  But in Dubai,
[3:14:34.360 --> 3:14:36.360]  if you don't make the automobile payment
[3:14:36.360 --> 3:14:37.360]  or your house payment,
[3:14:37.360 --> 3:14:40.360]  they don't just come and get the automobile at the house.
[3:14:40.360 --> 3:14:41.360]  They come and get you,
[3:14:41.360 --> 3:14:43.360]  and these people lost their jobs.
[3:14:43.360 --> 3:14:45.360]  Dubai has closed down.
[3:14:45.360 --> 3:14:48.360]  It has ground to a halt.
[3:14:48.360 --> 3:14:50.360]  The skyscrapers aren't being built.
[3:14:50.360 --> 3:14:52.360]  The concrete's not being delivered.
[3:14:52.360 --> 3:14:53.360]  They don't have any more money.
[3:14:53.360 --> 3:14:54.360]  They're out.
[3:14:54.360 --> 3:14:56.360]  They've had to borrow all because they've lost
[3:14:56.360 --> 3:15:01.360]  75% of their income on every barrel of oil,
[3:15:01.360 --> 3:15:03.360]  and they've done it within four months' time.
[3:15:03.360 --> 3:15:06.360]  Now, Lindsey, we covered that when you were on with this,
[3:15:06.360 --> 3:15:08.360]  because I want to get into the new developments
[3:15:08.360 --> 3:15:11.360]  and go back to what this elitist
[3:15:11.360 --> 3:15:13.360]  former oil company had told you
[3:15:13.360 --> 3:15:16.360]  the globalists were planning at dovetails with our Intel,
[3:15:16.360 --> 3:15:19.360]  because it's now all of it is unfolding
[3:15:19.360 --> 3:15:21.360]  and how you see this unfolding,
[3:15:21.360 --> 3:15:22.360]  how bad it's going to get,
[3:15:22.360 --> 3:15:24.360]  how bad he told you that it was going to get.
[3:15:24.360 --> 3:15:27.360]  But clearly, they get the world over-extended in these debt bubbles,
[3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:28.360]  then they blow out the oil,
[3:15:28.360 --> 3:15:31.360]  they blow out the stock market for global consolidation
[3:15:31.360 --> 3:15:32.360]  so they can consolidate things.
[3:15:32.360 --> 3:15:34.360]  Is that not what you were told?
[3:15:34.360 --> 3:15:36.360]  Yes, that's exactly what you said.
[3:15:36.360 --> 3:15:38.360]  You said America will see a financial crisis
[3:15:38.360 --> 3:15:41.360]  that will be so great that it will take years to come out of it.
[3:15:41.360 --> 3:15:45.360]  You said that Russia was going to be made a great empire again.
[3:15:45.360 --> 3:15:47.360]  They'll have to break them first and control them.
[3:15:47.360 --> 3:15:50.360]  He also mentioned other countries of the world
[3:15:50.360 --> 3:15:51.360]  and what would happen to them.
[3:15:51.360 --> 3:15:54.360]  Let me point out what happened this past weekend.
[3:15:54.360 --> 3:15:56.360]  Latvia government collapsed.
[3:15:56.360 --> 3:15:59.360]  Yes, Latvia doesn't have natural resources,
[3:15:59.360 --> 3:16:01.360]  so it became a financial center.
[3:16:01.360 --> 3:16:03.360]  It has totally collapsed.
[3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:06.360]  The Ukraine, if you went to the bank in the Ukraine,
[3:16:06.360 --> 3:16:09.360]  you lived there, you could not pull money out.
[3:16:09.360 --> 3:16:12.360]  They will not allow anyone to take cash out of the bank into Ukraine.
[3:16:12.360 --> 3:16:15.360]  Iceland, as you remember, collapsed a while back.
[3:16:15.360 --> 3:16:17.360]  All of these to Hungary.
[3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:20.360]  Hungary is foreign.
[3:16:20.360 --> 3:16:22.360]  It fell to an all-time low on Monday.
[3:16:22.360 --> 3:16:26.360]  Poland's slotty slumped to the lowest in five years.
[3:16:26.360 --> 3:16:29.360]  This is a worldwide situation
[3:16:29.360 --> 3:16:32.360]  that they basically are going to bring in
[3:16:32.360 --> 3:16:34.360]  the control of the whole world.
[3:16:34.360 --> 3:16:37.360]  Eastern Central Europe has been supported by Germany
[3:16:37.360 --> 3:16:40.360]  as of this past two days ago.
[3:16:40.360 --> 3:16:42.360]  And by the way, they're now announcing world government
[3:16:42.360 --> 3:16:45.360]  and all the news as a savior ruled by banks
[3:16:45.360 --> 3:16:47.360]  in a new bank of the world that will pay carbon taxes
[3:16:47.360 --> 3:16:49.360]  to exactly what you said they were going to do.
[3:16:49.360 --> 3:16:52.360]  This is the foretold coming of the one-world government.
[3:16:52.360 --> 3:16:54.360]  It is now happening.
[3:16:54.360 --> 3:16:56.360]  Yes, that's exactly what's happening.
[3:16:56.360 --> 3:16:58.360]  And now let's go to the United States of America.
[3:16:58.360 --> 3:17:00.360]  How is this affecting us?
[3:17:00.360 --> 3:17:03.360]  First of all, he said to me seven months ago,
[3:17:03.360 --> 3:17:06.360]  and Alex, you granted me the privilege of breaking this news
[3:17:06.360 --> 3:17:09.360]  on your show for the first time when you allowed the 28th,
[3:17:09.360 --> 3:17:12.360]  and he said America will see a financial collapse so great
[3:17:12.360 --> 3:17:15.360]  that it will take years to come out of it.
[3:17:15.360 --> 3:17:17.360]  Now, let me point out what happened just this past week.
[3:17:17.360 --> 3:17:20.360]  Corporate profits report on this Monday.
[3:17:20.360 --> 3:17:23.360]  Mesa's profits were down 59%.
[3:17:23.360 --> 3:17:26.360]  Target, yeah, most of you, a lot of you do business there
[3:17:26.360 --> 3:17:28.360]  from time to time.
[3:17:28.360 --> 3:17:31.360]  41% down on profit report.
[3:17:31.360 --> 3:17:33.360]  JCPenney, 41%.
[3:17:33.360 --> 3:17:36.360]  Office Depot lost 1.5 billion.
[3:17:36.360 --> 3:17:40.360]  Imagine how this is going to affect the tax structure
[3:17:40.360 --> 3:17:43.360]  of the federal and state government within 60 to 90 days.
[3:17:43.360 --> 3:17:45.360]  And the crime rate is exploding,
[3:17:45.360 --> 3:17:47.360]  and they're openly announcing they're getting ready
[3:17:47.360 --> 3:17:49.360]  for martial law. Please continue.
[3:17:49.360 --> 3:17:52.360]  Yes, AIG, Logistics Insurance Company in the world,
[3:17:52.360 --> 3:17:55.360]  I guess it is, reported the biggest quarterly loss ever
[3:17:55.360 --> 3:17:58.360]  in U.S. financial history.
[3:17:58.360 --> 3:18:01.360]  Close to $70 billion in one quarter.
[3:18:01.360 --> 3:18:04.360]  It's lost over $100 billion in the last year.
[3:18:04.360 --> 3:18:07.360]  Yes, we bailed them out to $120 billion,
[3:18:07.360 --> 3:18:10.360]  and now they are going back for another $60 billion.
[3:18:10.360 --> 3:18:13.360]  And let me put it this way.
[3:18:13.360 --> 3:18:18.360]  In 1975, a person could buy all of the real estate in America,
[3:18:18.360 --> 3:18:20.360]  all of the shopping malls in America,
[3:18:20.360 --> 3:18:22.360]  all of the hotels in America,
[3:18:22.360 --> 3:18:24.360]  all of the land in the United States of America
[3:18:24.360 --> 3:18:27.360]  could have been bought in 1975,
[3:18:27.360 --> 3:18:29.360]  but what the government of the United States of America
[3:18:29.360 --> 3:18:31.360]  has spent in the past 90 days.
[3:18:31.360 --> 3:18:34.360]  I mean, folks, this is so startling.
[3:18:34.360 --> 3:18:37.360]  It shatters the thinking of a person,
[3:18:37.360 --> 3:18:40.360]  almost city group, has borrowed $40 billion
[3:18:40.360 --> 3:18:43.360]  from the U.S. Treasury, yet it's only worth $13 billion.
[3:18:43.360 --> 3:18:46.360]  You realize that your great-great-grandchildren
[3:18:46.360 --> 3:18:49.360]  are going to be responsible for this indebtedness
[3:18:49.360 --> 3:18:53.360]  of the outlandish things that are being done right now.
[3:18:53.360 --> 3:18:58.360]  A Saudi Arabian prince had invested hundreds of billions of dollars
[3:18:58.360 --> 3:19:00.360]  into Citibank.
[3:19:00.360 --> 3:19:01.360]  He's going broke.
[3:19:01.360 --> 3:19:04.360]  I mean, he literally is on the verge of wondering,
[3:19:04.360 --> 3:19:07.360]  this man told me, he said,
[3:19:07.360 --> 3:19:10.360]  the oil-producing country's opaque.
[3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:15.360]  They are doing this for the purpose of bringing them to bankruptcy,
[3:19:15.360 --> 3:19:18.360]  and every bit of it is exactly what you've been saying
[3:19:18.360 --> 3:19:21.360]  all of these times, these years.
[3:19:21.360 --> 3:19:25.360]  Alex, it's coming to pass right before our eyes.
[3:19:25.360 --> 3:19:28.360]  And soon the riots and the martial law and the FEMA camps,
[3:19:28.360 --> 3:19:31.360]  unless we go completely wild,
[3:19:31.360 --> 3:19:33.360]  warning people is watching them on the wall,
[3:19:33.360 --> 3:19:35.360]  I believe that if we expose this,
[3:19:35.360 --> 3:19:37.360]  at least here in the United States and a few other pockets,
[3:19:37.360 --> 3:19:39.360]  because we do have the Second Amendment,
[3:19:39.360 --> 3:19:41.360]  they may not bring in the full martial law here
[3:19:41.360 --> 3:19:43.360]  as they're doing all over the world right now.
[3:19:43.360 --> 3:19:47.360]  Well, let me come down to where we are.
[3:19:47.360 --> 3:19:51.360]  At this, this past weekend, I'm going to give a place.
[3:19:51.360 --> 3:19:53.360]  I'm going to give a name.
[3:19:53.360 --> 3:19:56.360]  I have permission to do this.
[3:19:56.360 --> 3:19:58.360]  Campo, Colorado.
[3:19:58.360 --> 3:20:00.360]  Southeastern Colorado, northern Texas.
[3:20:00.360 --> 3:20:03.360]  40% of the food supply in the United States of America
[3:20:03.360 --> 3:20:05.360]  is grown right there.
[3:20:05.360 --> 3:20:07.360]  The couple is Betalock.
[3:20:07.360 --> 3:20:10.360]  She and her husband own a farm of thousands of acres.
[3:20:10.360 --> 3:20:13.360]  The largest farms in America are in that part of the country.
[3:20:13.360 --> 3:20:18.360]  Now, folks, please, if anything else that's said on this program today,
[3:20:18.360 --> 3:20:20.360]  this you must remember,
[3:20:20.360 --> 3:20:23.360]  because it's going to affect whether you eat dinner or not.
[3:20:23.360 --> 3:20:27.360]  She said to me, Captain Williams, we don't know what we're going to do.
[3:20:27.360 --> 3:20:31.360]  She said, right now we're getting $3 a bushel for Cohen.
[3:20:31.360 --> 3:20:33.360]  He said we're ready to put in all the profits.
[3:20:33.360 --> 3:20:34.360]  He can't do it.
[3:20:34.360 --> 3:20:40.360]  He said it costs us $5.50 to raise that coin this next year.
[3:20:40.360 --> 3:20:41.360]  Stay there.
[3:20:41.360 --> 3:20:43.360]  We're going to talk about how they destroyed the commodities market
[3:20:43.360 --> 3:20:44.360]  by design to bankrupt everything.
[3:20:44.360 --> 3:20:47.360]  This is the massive new order move
[3:20:47.360 --> 3:20:49.360]  as you're doing third world countries on a global scale
[3:20:49.360 --> 3:20:53.360]  bankrupting everything so riots break out and martial law can be declared.
[3:20:53.360 --> 3:20:55.360]  Then they set up dictatorship.
[3:20:55.360 --> 3:20:57.360]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:20:57.360 --> 3:20:58.360]  Lindsey Williams is our guest.
[3:20:58.360 --> 3:21:01.360]  Quick break, we'll be right back.
[3:21:28.360 --> 3:21:35.360]  We'll be right back.
[3:21:58.360 --> 3:22:08.360]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, executive order 11,110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States of America.
[3:22:29.360 --> 3:22:34.360]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[3:22:34.360 --> 3:22:37.360]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[3:22:37.360 --> 3:22:40.360]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[3:22:40.360 --> 3:22:43.360]  Minus has the Kennedy versus Fed document.
[3:22:43.360 --> 3:22:46.360]  Call 800-686-2237.
[3:22:46.360 --> 3:22:48.360]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[3:22:48.360 --> 3:22:51.360]  Call 800-686-2237.

[3:22:58.360 --> 3:23:01.360]  That's 800-686-2237.
[3:23:01.360 --> 3:23:09.360]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[3:23:09.360 --> 3:23:11.360]  Or at least we thought we did.
[3:23:11.360 --> 3:23:17.360]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:23:17.360 --> 3:23:26.360]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:23:26.360 --> 3:23:33.360]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:23:33.360 --> 3:23:36.360]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:23:36.360 --> 3:23:42.360]  He takes his hand off and you hear it three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:23:42.360 --> 3:23:49.360]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[3:23:49.360 --> 3:23:54.360]  and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:23:54.360 --> 3:24:01.360]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:24:01.360 --> 3:24:08.360]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S. and the world.
[3:24:08.360 --> 3:24:12.360]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[3:24:12.360 --> 3:24:18.360]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[3:24:18.360 --> 3:24:23.360]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[3:24:23.360 --> 3:24:28.360]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with doubly-nammeled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[3:24:28.360 --> 3:24:33.360]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[3:24:33.360 --> 3:24:39.360]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[3:24:39.360 --> 3:24:41.360]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[3:24:41.360 --> 3:24:45.360]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.

[3:25:27.360 --> 3:25:34.360]  I may even cancel the state rep who has introduced a pro-tenth amendment saying they are not going to follow the Fed's gun control.
[3:25:34.360 --> 3:25:40.360]  This is an Alabama Representative Mark Kehe, but we will see what happens.
[3:25:40.360 --> 3:25:45.360]  This Lindsey Williams stuff is so important, but maybe we will have to rep on for five minutes while he is with us and then go back to Lindsey.
[3:25:45.360 --> 3:25:47.360]  Okay, Lindsey, recap.
[3:25:47.360 --> 3:25:50.360]  Going into what is happening to the farmers, not just here but worldwide.
[3:25:50.360 --> 3:25:53.360]  Riots are breaking out all over the planet over the last year.
[3:25:53.360 --> 3:25:57.360]  They are falling all over Africa.
[3:25:57.360 --> 3:25:59.360]  You name it, it is getting crazy.
[3:25:59.360 --> 3:26:03.360]  I listen to the BBC every day in my car on XM and it is another country falling.
[3:26:03.360 --> 3:26:05.360]  Revolutions everywhere.
[3:26:05.360 --> 3:26:07.360]  The globalists are moving on all fronts right now.
[3:26:07.360 --> 3:26:09.360]  Please continue.
[3:26:09.360 --> 3:26:13.360]  Everything that the elitists planned a year ago, a year and a half ago,
[3:26:13.360 --> 3:26:19.360]  but they have planned for many years in the financial crisis with what is happening in real estate and banking in America right now.
[3:26:19.360 --> 3:26:22.360]  All of this was planned many, many years ago.
[3:26:22.360 --> 3:26:26.360]  Everything that we are going to do in advance, and now it comes down to the one thing,
[3:26:26.360 --> 3:26:29.360]  that whenever you control that, you control the masses of population.
[3:26:29.360 --> 3:26:31.360]  Now there are two things that every human being must have.
[3:26:31.360 --> 3:26:33.360]  You have got to have water.
[3:26:33.360 --> 3:26:36.360]  At least once every 24 hours, you must drink water.
[3:26:36.360 --> 3:26:38.360]  There is something else you have to have to live.
[3:26:38.360 --> 3:26:42.360]  You might do without a house or an automobile or some of these other things like a boat and so on.
[3:26:42.360 --> 3:26:45.360]  You cannot do without food.
[3:26:45.360 --> 3:26:47.360]  It finally has come to that.
[3:26:47.360 --> 3:26:49.360]  They have gotten the farmers right where they want them.
[3:26:49.360 --> 3:26:55.360]  Be it a lot, Campo, Colorado, thousands of acres, 40% of the food supply of America.
[3:26:55.360 --> 3:26:59.360]  Corn right now, they are selling it for $3 a bushel.
[3:26:59.360 --> 3:27:01.360]  Now this was this weekend.
[3:27:01.360 --> 3:27:05.360]  It cost them to raise that corn $5.50 a bushel.
[3:27:05.360 --> 3:27:07.360]  They cannot put their crops in this spring.
[3:27:07.360 --> 3:27:11.360]  Wheat, they are getting for it right now $5 a bushel.
[3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:15.360]  It cost them to raise that wheat $6 to $7 a bushel.
[3:27:15.360 --> 3:27:18.360]  And the farmers, what are they going to do?
[3:27:18.360 --> 3:27:19.360]  They can't plant.
[3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:20.360]  I asked Vita.
[3:27:20.360 --> 3:27:22.360]  I said, where are the farmers going?
[3:27:22.360 --> 3:27:27.360]  She said, the only farmers that are going to plant this spring are those who have irrigated crops.
[3:27:27.360 --> 3:27:30.360]  And she said, they know they are not going to be able to produce enough.
[3:27:30.360 --> 3:27:35.360]  And she said, they are planting and they are depending on the insurance to bail them out.
[3:27:35.360 --> 3:27:40.360]  Regardless of what happens to the weather, she said, Lindsay, there is going to be a major crisis.
[3:27:40.360 --> 3:27:42.360]  Now folks, please listen to this.
[3:27:42.360 --> 3:27:44.360]  This startled me to no end.
[3:27:44.360 --> 3:27:45.360]  She said one other thing.
[3:27:45.360 --> 3:27:50.360]  She said, Jacqueline Williams, she said, listen, there was nothing.
[3:27:50.360 --> 3:27:54.360]  Folks, please, you've got to see what our president is doing.
[3:27:54.360 --> 3:28:02.360]  Nothing in the stimulus package, not one penny in the stimulus package was earmarked for farmers.
[3:28:02.360 --> 3:28:03.360]  It's all for the bankers.
[3:28:03.360 --> 3:28:04.360]  All for the bankers.
[3:28:04.360 --> 3:28:05.360]  All for the bankers.
[3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:08.360]  All for the bailout of the money people.
[3:28:08.360 --> 3:28:10.360]  All of their friends and their cronies.
[3:28:10.360 --> 3:28:12.360]  But nothing, not one penny.
[3:28:12.360 --> 3:28:16.360]  Think of it now, go back to the stimulus package for yourself.
[3:28:16.360 --> 3:28:18.360]  Think of everything you've heard about it for the last few weeks.
[3:28:18.360 --> 3:28:22.360]  Nothing in the stimulus package was earmarked for the farmers of America.
[3:28:22.360 --> 3:28:25.360]  And yet they cannot plant their crops this spring.
[3:28:25.360 --> 3:28:32.360]  And I said to Vita, I said, Vita, how long is this going to, how long before this is going to show up on the store shelves?
[3:28:32.360 --> 3:28:36.360]  She said, Lindsay, we can't plant this spring.
[3:28:36.360 --> 3:28:38.360]  She said, there's nothing we can do about it.
[3:28:38.360 --> 3:28:41.360]  Our farms, many of them are going to be lost.
[3:28:41.360 --> 3:28:45.360]  She said, next fall, the crop's not going to be there.
[3:28:45.360 --> 3:28:50.360]  For those who do irrigate and will dare to plant knowing that about all they're going to get is the insurance out of it.
[3:28:50.360 --> 3:28:52.360]  She said, the food's not going to be there.
[3:28:52.360 --> 3:28:54.360]  She said, you have about six to nine.
[3:28:54.360 --> 3:28:57.360]  Now, Alex, this is what's so amazing.
[3:28:57.360 --> 3:29:08.360]  This man indicated to me that nine to 12 months, six to nine to 12, he didn't say exactly how long there would be this crisis that would appear in America.
[3:29:08.360 --> 3:29:15.360]  And it is going exactly almost to the month what this man told me was going to happen when I book it on your book.
[3:29:15.360 --> 3:29:18.360]  I am so glad you allowed me to tell it on July the 28th.
[3:29:18.360 --> 3:29:27.360]  Otherwise, many people in the listening audience would have difficulty believing today that they had all this planned in advance, but they did.
[3:29:27.360 --> 3:29:34.360]  And yet now that I would come down to the one control item, that if you want to control the masses of people, you control the food.
[3:29:34.360 --> 3:29:39.360]  And this weekend, Vita Lock said to me, oh, go to it, look in the phone directory, call her up.
[3:29:39.360 --> 3:29:41.360]  If you doubt what I'm saying.
[3:29:41.360 --> 3:29:43.360]  No, no, no, listen, listen, listen.
[3:29:43.360 --> 3:29:53.360]  Beef is more in the stores, but because the meat packers, four companies have bought up all of the processing, the people raising cattle are literally going bankrupt.
[3:29:53.360 --> 3:29:56.360]  They can't even make the money they put into it on selling them.
[3:29:56.360 --> 3:29:57.360]  They're losing money.
[3:29:57.360 --> 3:29:58.360]  The cows are stacking up.
[3:29:58.360 --> 3:30:03.360]  The beef is more, just like all the raw materials, the corn, the wheat is more at the store.
[3:30:03.360 --> 3:30:09.360]  But they've gotten it so imploded at the grassroots level of the economy that they've got a shortage of it.
[3:30:09.360 --> 3:30:12.360]  Just like when they have a shortage of gold, its price doesn't go up.
[3:30:12.360 --> 3:30:14.360]  This is not a free market.
[3:30:14.360 --> 3:30:21.360]  This is a controlled system, and they're coming in with the animal idea, the premise society, shutting down the farms, controlling them.
[3:30:21.360 --> 3:30:29.360]  With carbon taxes in New Zealand and Australia, the headlines are just shutting down their farms because there's hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxes just on a few sheep.
[3:30:29.360 --> 3:30:33.360]  I mean, this is total feudalism, total control by design.
[3:30:33.360 --> 3:30:37.360]  I promised we're going to have Lindsay on for an hour and a half, but we got the time zones messed up.
[3:30:37.360 --> 3:30:38.360]  We're going to have him back up soon.
[3:30:38.360 --> 3:30:40.360]  We're going to come back with him for the rest of the hour.
[3:30:40.360 --> 3:30:41.360]  I've cancelled the state rep.
[3:30:41.360 --> 3:30:43.360]  We'll have him back on about the Second Amendment.
[3:30:43.360 --> 3:30:50.360]  This is too important with Lindsay-Williams, and I promise to take a few calls, so specifically for Lindsay-Williams, 1-800-25-99-231.
[3:30:51.360 --> 3:30:52.360]  We're on the march.
[3:30:52.360 --> 3:30:55.360]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:30:55.360 --> 3:30:59.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[3:32:01.360 --> 3:32:08.360]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:32:08.360 --> 3:32:10.360]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:32:10.360 --> 3:32:12.360]  But who is the enemy?
[3:32:12.360 --> 3:32:13.360]  Bin Laden.
[3:32:13.360 --> 3:32:14.360]  This is his ammo.
[3:32:14.360 --> 3:32:17.360]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:32:17.360 --> 3:32:24.360]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:32:24.360 --> 3:32:31.360]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:32:31.360 --> 3:32:35.360]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:32:35.360 --> 3:32:42.360]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[3:32:42.360 --> 3:32:45.360]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[3:32:45.360 --> 3:32:46.360]  Fabled Enemies.

[3:34:03.360 --> 3:34:08.360]  The globalists are militarily and economically moving against us on every front, but the people are awakening.
[3:34:08.360 --> 3:34:11.360]  This is their point of greatest strength and greatest weakness.
[3:34:11.360 --> 3:34:13.360]  Their operations are being launched.
[3:34:13.360 --> 3:34:24.360]  Worldwide, coups, murders, just Google, African presidents being killed, prime ministers, generals, Madagascar, Eastern Europe, Asia.
[3:34:24.360 --> 3:34:32.360]  They are moving on every front, fights between Russia and the United States over who controls what countries payoffs going on on both sides.
[3:34:32.360 --> 3:34:34.360]  It's all happening.
[3:34:34.360 --> 3:34:38.360]  Historians say that more happens sometimes in a year than happens in the previous hundred.
[3:34:38.360 --> 3:34:45.360]  Lenin had another wicked quote along those lines about sometimes things happen more in a week than happen in a decade.
[3:34:45.360 --> 3:34:53.360]  We're in that now. We're about to go back to Lindsey Williams right now, but I have been rampaging here on air with all this key info for two hours, three hours and 33 minutes.
[3:34:53.360 --> 3:34:55.360]  Three hours and 33 minutes.
[3:34:55.360 --> 3:35:01.360]  And it is sponsors that make this show possible, so I want to name a few of those sponsors right now that I believe in that I use.
[3:35:01.360 --> 3:35:04.360]  I'm drinking a cup of blue water right here, baby.
[3:35:04.360 --> 3:35:10.360]  I love it. Right here in the office, right out of there, people go, what is it? There's no water bottle on top of it. No, it's out of the air.
[3:35:10.360 --> 3:35:13.360]  Atmospheric water generated from the home pays for itself in one year.
[3:35:13.360 --> 3:35:16.360]  You buy water from the store, pure clean water without the floor out without anything.
[3:35:16.360 --> 3:35:18.360]  There's seven filters inside.
[3:35:18.360 --> 3:35:21.360]  You hear the ad, I run, it's wrong. I got to recut it and say five filters. It's seven.
[3:35:21.360 --> 3:35:25.360]  Just an amazing system, great tasting pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[3:35:25.360 --> 3:35:29.360]  1-800-691-6043, hook it up to a solar panel.
[3:35:29.360 --> 3:35:30.360]  Don't even need a well, folks.
[3:35:30.360 --> 3:35:32.360]  By the way, we just drilled another well in our family land.
[3:35:32.360 --> 3:35:35.360]  We had 1-300 footer. We went in 800 feet of secure water.
[3:35:35.360 --> 3:35:37.360]  I mean, I'm getting ready, okay?
[3:35:37.360 --> 3:35:42.360]  And we hope to avert all this, but I mean, I got guns and food and I'm going to take care of my family, folks.
[3:35:42.360 --> 3:35:44.360]  What I'm telling you, I believe in.
[3:35:44.360 --> 3:35:50.360]  1-800-691-6043, 1-800-691-6043.

[3:35:55.360 --> 3:36:00.360]  Another fine sponsor that makes this show possible is the Best Storeable Foods Company out there.
[3:36:00.360 --> 3:36:04.360]  The Biggest Storeable Foods Company out there, non-GMO.
[3:36:04.360 --> 3:36:06.360]  It's just amazing quality food, great prices.
[3:36:06.360 --> 3:36:10.360]  800-409-5633, E-FoodsDirect.com.
[3:36:10.360 --> 3:36:12.360]  You'll never stand on the bread line if you have your own food.
[3:36:12.360 --> 3:36:15.360]  The UN has said, just Google, UN says use food as a weapon.
[3:36:15.360 --> 3:36:18.360]  You'll read the official UN website saying they use it as a weapon.
[3:36:18.360 --> 3:36:22.360]  800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[3:36:22.360 --> 3:36:27.360]  Our job is to get folks prepared and it's symbiotic and the sponsors also make the show possible.
[3:36:27.360 --> 3:36:34.360]  And the incredible amount of funds it takes to run this. So we thank E-FoodsDirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[3:36:34.360 --> 3:36:38.360]  And one other sponsor that I wanted to tell you about.
[3:36:38.360 --> 3:36:41.360]  And it also goes along the lines of preparedness.
[3:36:41.360 --> 3:36:46.360]  And that's MySolarBackup.com from the great folks at Solutions from Science.
[3:36:46.360 --> 3:36:50.360]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the PowerSource 1800 Power Plant
[3:36:50.360 --> 3:36:53.360]  and the High Efficiency Solar Plant designed to provide endless electricity.
[3:36:53.360 --> 3:36:55.360]  That's right, it generates free electricity once you have the unit.
[3:36:55.360 --> 3:36:59.360]  Remember too that gas generators need gas but in blackouts gas pumps can't work
[3:36:59.360 --> 3:37:03.360]  because they run electricity, the solar generator is like having your own power plant hidden in your home.
[3:37:03.360 --> 3:37:07.360]  It's a perfect emergency backup for troubled times if you need more power, get more units.
[3:37:07.360 --> 3:37:16.360]  MySolarBackup.com, MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[3:37:16.360 --> 3:37:20.360]  Again, MySolarBackup.com.
[3:37:20.360 --> 3:37:23.360]  Another group I want to plug, not really even a sponsor, they are on the website.
[3:37:23.360 --> 3:37:25.360]  I just want to have them on as guest period to promote it.
[3:37:25.360 --> 3:37:29.360]  Not even a sponsor is TruthRadio.com.
[3:37:29.360 --> 3:37:31.360]  Or is it TruthAM?
[3:37:31.360 --> 3:37:37.360]  That's right, TruthAM.com, TruthAM.com, TruthAM.com, TruthAM.com.
[3:37:37.360 --> 3:37:42.360]  These little AMs, FCC, license, legal, they go out three miles.
[3:37:42.360 --> 3:37:46.360]  You put that in your area on your house, put up signs all over the three miles.
[3:37:46.360 --> 3:37:47.360]  That's how we're going to beat them.
[3:37:47.360 --> 3:37:51.360]  TruthAM.com is throwing that into, they're not even paying for me to do that.
[3:37:51.360 --> 3:37:54.360]  I believe in it, we've got to get micro-FMs up, whatever.
[3:37:54.360 --> 3:37:56.360]  I mean, just we've got to do it now, folks.
[3:37:56.360 --> 3:37:58.360]  We've got to move now to fight these people.
[3:37:58.360 --> 3:38:01.360]  Okay, that said, that done.
[3:38:01.360 --> 3:38:05.360]  It's just amazing.
[3:38:05.360 --> 3:38:09.360]  Lindsay Williams, please continue, sir, with what this guy told you.
[3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:15.360]  When you came on six months ago, you told seven months ago, you told Dr. Stan Monteith about this.
[3:38:15.360 --> 3:38:20.360]  You couldn't go public the time, but then six months ago you did when oil was right up at 147, 148, a barrel.
[3:38:20.360 --> 3:38:22.360]  Now below 40.
[3:38:22.360 --> 3:38:27.360]  He said they were going to implode that, bring in world depression, have crises in the US.
[3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:29.360]  He told you you better get out of the US.
[3:38:29.360 --> 3:38:30.360]  There's nowhere to run.
[3:38:30.360 --> 3:38:31.360]  This is worldwide.
[3:38:31.360 --> 3:38:32.360]  Please continue.
[3:38:32.360 --> 3:38:34.360]  How fast can it happen?
[3:38:34.360 --> 3:38:36.360]  I do not want to frighten you.
[3:38:36.360 --> 3:38:38.360]  And I'm sure Alex doesn't want to frighten you.
[3:38:38.360 --> 3:38:40.360]  He just tells you the truth like it is.
[3:38:40.360 --> 3:38:42.360]  This is how fast it can happen.
[3:38:42.360 --> 3:38:45.360]  Two weeks ago, the government collapsed.
[3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:47.360]  Now, the first government to collapse was Iceland.
[3:38:47.360 --> 3:38:49.360]  You remember that about three to four months ago.
[3:38:49.360 --> 3:38:50.360]  Yes.
[3:38:50.360 --> 3:38:52.360]  It was havoc in that country shortly after.
[3:38:52.360 --> 3:38:53.360]  And it's still havoc.
[3:38:53.360 --> 3:38:54.360]  Yeah.
[3:38:54.360 --> 3:38:55.360]  And this is it.
[3:38:55.360 --> 3:38:56.360]  Oh, yeah.
[3:38:56.360 --> 3:38:58.360]  They won't be anything but bankrupt from now.
[3:38:58.360 --> 3:39:04.360]  And then the second company to put a country to declare bankruptcy, Latvian government, two weeks ago.
[3:39:04.360 --> 3:39:07.360]  Now, I want you to see just how fast things can happen.
[3:39:07.360 --> 3:39:12.360]  And folks, this is just how fast it will happen in the United States of America.
[3:39:12.360 --> 3:39:16.360]  I beg of you, understand it can take place within a matter of hours.
[3:39:16.360 --> 3:39:17.360]  Here it is.
[3:39:17.360 --> 3:39:19.360]  Latvian government collapsed.
[3:39:19.360 --> 3:39:22.360]  Here, government is cutting spending wherever it can.
[3:39:22.360 --> 3:39:26.360]  Hospitals, schools throughout the country are on threat of closure.
[3:39:26.360 --> 3:39:32.360]  In two weeks, as local administrations find their budgets reduced to as much as 40%,
[3:39:32.360 --> 3:39:35.360]  government salaries have been cut 25%.
[3:39:35.360 --> 3:39:39.360]  Two weeks, do you know how fast this can happen in America?
[3:39:39.360 --> 3:39:45.360]  Meanwhile, the country's export driven economy, which burned red hot at the height of the everything going so well,
[3:39:45.360 --> 3:39:47.360]  has ground to a halt.
[3:39:47.360 --> 3:39:49.360]  Unemployment has rocketed in Latvia.
[3:39:49.360 --> 3:39:54.360]  Those who have managed to hold on to their jobs are receiving significantly less pay.
[3:39:54.360 --> 3:40:01.360]  And they're predicting that every Eastern European country is going to basically completely collapse a domino effect into Asia,
[3:40:01.360 --> 3:40:03.360]  the Middle East, the United States.
[3:40:03.360 --> 3:40:09.360]  And then meanwhile, Fox News is blaming it on Russia and saying the Russians want us to collapse in these weird spin articles
[3:40:09.360 --> 3:40:11.360]  when Russia has nothing to do with it.
[3:40:11.360 --> 3:40:16.360]  Yeah, and construction real estate farming has ground to a halt.
[3:40:16.360 --> 3:40:21.360]  Folks, this is just how fast it can happen in the United States of America.
[3:40:21.360 --> 3:40:24.360]  Don't think that we're alarmists. We aren't. We're realists.
[3:40:24.360 --> 3:40:26.360]  And we're trying our best to tell you.
[3:40:26.360 --> 3:40:30.360]  I was told seven months ago that this was going to happen.
[3:40:30.360 --> 3:40:32.360]  They had it planned in advance.
[3:40:32.360 --> 3:40:37.360]  He said America will see a financial collapse that will be so great it will take years to come out of it.
[3:40:37.360 --> 3:40:41.360]  Don't think it's going to come out in 24 hours.
[3:40:41.360 --> 3:40:44.360]  Our president is not going to bring it out in six months to a year.
[3:40:44.360 --> 3:40:50.360]  This is going to be a long term thing that you must make preparations for right now.
[3:40:50.360 --> 3:40:54.360]  Already OPEC has lost in four months time.
[3:40:54.360 --> 3:41:00.360]  All producing countries of the world have lost two and one half trillion dollars in four months time.
[3:41:00.360 --> 3:41:03.360]  They cannot buy our treasury bills.
[3:41:03.360 --> 3:41:06.360]  Now, this is the thing that is startling so much.
[3:41:06.360 --> 3:41:12.360]  Whenever you consider that maces, that profits down 51, 59 percent,
[3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:16.360]  targets down 41 percent, JCPenney down 41 percent,
[3:41:16.360 --> 3:41:20.360]  Office Depot lost 1.5 billion dollars in the last quarter.
[3:41:20.360 --> 3:41:27.360]  Now think of all the taxes that would have gone to the federal government and the state governments
[3:41:27.360 --> 3:41:31.360]  if these stores had still been doing 100 percent of business.
[3:41:31.360 --> 3:41:38.360]  I think 75 percent of the taxes that come in at the gas pump on the gallon of gasoline
[3:41:38.360 --> 3:41:41.360]  are no longer going to the federal government and state governments.
[3:41:41.360 --> 3:41:45.360]  The thing I am so drastically concerned about at this point is,
[3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:49.360]  every state in America, whenever they figure up that books,
[3:41:49.360 --> 3:41:53.360]  which usually takes two to three months for them to catch up with where their bookkeeping is,
[3:41:53.360 --> 3:41:57.360]  they are going to realize that they have lost 60 to 75 percent,
[3:41:57.360 --> 3:42:01.360]  depending on the product and the store of that tax structure,
[3:42:01.360 --> 3:42:03.360]  they are not going to be able to support the schools.
[3:42:03.360 --> 3:42:06.360]  I mean, don't go out there and riot and say,
[3:42:06.360 --> 3:42:08.360]  oh, we ought to have all of our children.
[3:42:08.360 --> 3:42:10.360]  Well, the tax structure is not there.
[3:42:10.360 --> 3:42:12.360]  They want you to play into that.
[3:42:12.360 --> 3:42:14.360]  That is why they are hyping the thing to do as riots.
[3:42:14.360 --> 3:42:17.360]  They have provocateur groups on record, Ford Foundation,
[3:42:17.360 --> 3:42:19.360]  Rockefeller Foundation funding it.
[3:42:19.360 --> 3:42:22.360]  So when everything implodes, they are going to put us into forced labor camps,
[3:42:22.360 --> 3:42:26.360]  officially built, I am holding up the Army list of 24 mass camps.
[3:42:26.360 --> 3:42:28.360]  We have tens of millions of Americans.
[3:42:28.360 --> 3:42:31.360]  This is not a game. This is not a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:34.360]  If you don't say no to this, if you don't realize who the enemy is, it's all over.
[3:42:34.360 --> 3:42:37.360]  Go ahead, CIA, FBI, police, play along.
[3:42:37.360 --> 3:42:39.360]  You are going to ruin your future, too.
[3:42:39.360 --> 3:42:42.360]  It's time to gut up and decide who you are with and who you stand with.
[3:42:42.360 --> 3:42:45.360]  And someone said to me the other day, they said,
[3:42:45.360 --> 3:42:48.360]  Pastor Williams, these people live in America.
[3:42:48.360 --> 3:42:51.360]  They said, you know who they are. I said, yes, I know many of them.
[3:42:51.360 --> 3:42:53.360]  They said, do they live in the United States of America?
[3:42:53.360 --> 3:42:55.360]  I said, most of them do.
[3:42:55.360 --> 3:42:57.360]  They want to destroy their own country.
[3:42:57.360 --> 3:42:59.360]  I said, no, they are not destroying their own country.
[3:42:59.360 --> 3:43:02.360]  They have everything in the world to gain by this.
[3:43:02.360 --> 3:43:04.360]  They are going to hold the banks of America.
[3:43:04.360 --> 3:43:07.360]  They are going to own the lending institutions of America.
[3:43:07.360 --> 3:43:09.360]  They are going to own the mom and pop businesses.
[3:43:09.360 --> 3:43:13.360]  Go to the shopping centers and see how many stores are vacant now.
[3:43:13.360 --> 3:43:15.360]  Look what's happening to the banking system.
[3:43:15.360 --> 3:43:17.360]  They are going to own the real estate of America.
[3:43:17.360 --> 3:43:20.360]  You realize that every mortgage house was mortgage.
[3:43:20.360 --> 3:43:23.360]  You got your mortgage from some lending institution
[3:43:23.360 --> 3:43:26.360]  which now belongs to the elite by where the Federal Reserve,
[3:43:26.360 --> 3:43:29.360]  through the Treasury of the United States of America, bailing them out,
[3:43:29.360 --> 3:43:32.360]  and they are going to own the majority of the real estate of America.
[3:43:32.360 --> 3:43:35.360]  They have everything to gain by what they are doing.
[3:43:35.360 --> 3:43:39.360]  David Walker, former Comptroller General of the United States of America,
[3:43:39.360 --> 3:43:41.360]  said it so well.
[3:43:41.360 --> 3:43:43.360]  Now, he held the currency for a while until he retired.
[3:43:43.360 --> 3:43:49.360]  He said, America's unfunded liability is $66 trillion.
[3:43:49.360 --> 3:43:52.360]  That includes the national debt, social security, Medicare, Medicaid,
[3:43:52.360 --> 3:43:57.360]  $66 trillion is more than the GDP, the gross domestic product,
[3:43:57.360 --> 3:44:00.360]  of the entire world.
[3:44:00.360 --> 3:44:03.360]  The whole world, GDP is only $65 trillion,
[3:44:03.360 --> 3:44:07.360]  and America's unfunded liability is $66 trillion,
[3:44:07.360 --> 3:44:12.360]  and America has more debt than all the rest of the world combined.
[3:44:12.360 --> 3:44:16.360]  America must attract 17% of the world's capital in any given day
[3:44:16.360 --> 3:44:21.360]  just to service the debt, the interest, on the national debt.
[3:44:21.360 --> 3:44:23.360]  Alex, there is no way out.
[3:44:23.360 --> 3:44:26.360]  I mean, they have it all set so that when it's all over with
[3:44:26.360 --> 3:44:31.360]  and the smoke is cleared, if they have their way, they will control this.
[3:44:31.360 --> 3:44:33.360]  But Alex, they're not going to do it.
[3:44:33.360 --> 3:44:35.360]  They're not going to do it because of programs like yours.
[3:44:35.360 --> 3:44:38.360]  And there's one thing that I found that these people fear.
[3:44:38.360 --> 3:44:40.360]  When I lived with them for those three years,
[3:44:40.360 --> 3:44:44.360]  they are scared to death of the masses of people in America waking up.
[3:44:44.360 --> 3:44:46.360]  It's the only thing that bothers them.
[3:44:46.360 --> 3:44:50.360]  Everything else is secondary, and the American people are waking up.
[3:44:50.360 --> 3:44:54.360]  I am amazed at what I'm hearing lately as to how many are taking action.
[3:44:54.360 --> 3:44:56.360]  And by the way, Lindsay, I want to hear more about that.
[3:44:56.360 --> 3:44:58.360]  We are putting on screen the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp program.
[3:44:58.360 --> 3:45:01.360]  I keep talking about the forced labor camps, about Americans,
[3:45:01.360 --> 3:45:04.360]  how they're already open, how they already put federal and state prisoners in them
[3:45:04.360 --> 3:45:06.360]  to get the military ready and trained to do this.
[3:45:06.360 --> 3:45:08.360]  They kept it secret for 11 years while they first set it up.
[3:45:08.360 --> 3:45:10.360]  They've had people secretly for 11 years on these,
[3:45:10.360 --> 3:45:13.360]  and now they're just announcing and all throwing it in everyone's face
[3:45:13.360 --> 3:45:16.360]  and Glenn Beck's making jokes about it like we can trust him,
[3:45:16.360 --> 3:45:19.360]  saying he'll look into it and giggling and snickering.
[3:45:19.360 --> 3:45:21.360]  I mean, they're being forced to talk about this
[3:45:21.360 --> 3:45:23.360]  because everybody's starting to wake up to them.
[3:45:23.360 --> 3:45:25.360]  Yes, they are, exactly.
[3:45:25.360 --> 3:45:29.360]  Now, Alex, would you let me say just a brief word about the two presentations
[3:45:29.360 --> 3:45:30.360]  I've just presented?
[3:45:30.360 --> 3:45:31.360]  Absolutely.
[3:45:31.360 --> 3:45:32.360]  In fact, let's do that.
[3:45:32.360 --> 3:45:34.360]  But then I want to, because I've got you to the end of the show.
[3:45:34.360 --> 3:45:35.360]  I canceled the other guests.
[3:45:35.360 --> 3:45:37.360]  Lindsay, you can stay another 15 minutes, right?
[3:45:37.360 --> 3:45:38.360]  Okay.
[3:45:38.360 --> 3:45:40.360]  Yeah, I'd be more than happy to consider it appropriately.
[3:45:40.360 --> 3:45:42.360]  Okay, well, all the folks have time to get a pen and paper.
[3:45:42.360 --> 3:45:43.360]  We'll do that at the end of the show,
[3:45:43.360 --> 3:45:46.360]  because it's so important that they get this information and spread it to everybody
[3:45:46.360 --> 3:45:47.360]  because you want them to copy it.
[3:45:47.360 --> 3:45:49.360]  But before we do that,
[3:45:49.360 --> 3:45:53.360]  again, you're saying that you believe this can at least be blunted and stopped.
[3:45:53.360 --> 3:45:55.360]  If people decide the government's going to save them,
[3:45:55.360 --> 3:45:57.360]  they're going to win and get the whole thing away.
[3:45:57.360 --> 3:45:58.360]  I mean, they're going to get away with it.
[3:45:58.360 --> 3:46:02.360]  What do we do to stop them in your mind, in your research?
[3:46:02.360 --> 3:46:03.360]  What are they most afraid of?
[3:46:03.360 --> 3:46:04.360]  How do we defeat this?
[3:46:04.360 --> 3:46:07.360]  The one thing that will defeat them more than anything else
[3:46:07.360 --> 3:46:10.360]  is for the information to be given out just like you're doing.
[3:46:10.360 --> 3:46:14.360]  Just blast it all across America every place possible.
[3:46:14.360 --> 3:46:15.360]  Put it on the Internet.
[3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:17.360]  You say you're doing another program at night.
[3:46:17.360 --> 3:46:18.360]  Congratulations.
[3:46:18.360 --> 3:46:19.360]  God bless you, Alex.
[3:46:19.360 --> 3:46:21.360]  I appreciate it so much.
[3:46:21.360 --> 3:46:23.360]  Get the message out to the American people.
[3:46:23.360 --> 3:46:24.360]  Now, people are hurting.
[3:46:24.360 --> 3:46:25.360]  Remember one thing.
[3:46:25.360 --> 3:46:28.360]  The most sensitive part of anybody's anatomy is the rear pocket.
[3:46:28.360 --> 3:46:32.360]  And right now, people are hurting where the dollar is,
[3:46:32.360 --> 3:46:36.360]  and they will wake up before they wouldn't even listen to you.
[3:46:36.360 --> 3:46:37.360]  They're beginning to listen now.
[3:46:37.360 --> 3:46:40.360]  Stockpockets down 6,000 in some odd,
[3:46:40.360 --> 3:46:43.360]  and they're hurting to the point that for the first time,
[3:46:43.360 --> 3:46:46.360]  they'll at least consider us wackos,
[3:46:46.360 --> 3:46:49.360]  and give us some thought as to the fact that we might be right,
[3:46:49.360 --> 3:46:53.360]  and when you can document what you're saying.
[3:46:53.360 --> 3:46:55.360]  Listen to Alex Jones' show every single day
[3:46:55.360 --> 3:46:57.360]  so you can document what you're saying.
[3:46:57.360 --> 3:47:00.360]  Be able to prove every point that you give.
[3:47:00.360 --> 3:47:01.360]  Then you'll have no problem.
[3:47:01.360 --> 3:47:07.360]  Both things like OPEC just lost $2.5 trillion in four months' time.
[3:47:07.360 --> 3:47:10.360]  Both things such as the tax structure of the United States of America
[3:47:10.360 --> 3:47:13.360]  is in jeopardy, and wait 30 days from now.
[3:47:13.360 --> 3:47:15.360]  And when the states finally figure out their books
[3:47:15.360 --> 3:47:16.360]  and realize where they are,
[3:47:16.360 --> 3:47:19.360]  you have never seen such cuts yet.
[3:47:19.360 --> 3:47:23.360]  Listen, give these things that you're hearing on Alex Jones' show.
[3:47:23.360 --> 3:47:25.360]  And you know things are happening so fast, Alex.
[3:47:25.360 --> 3:47:29.360]  I'm glad that you punctuated the moment to go how quickly they're happening,
[3:47:29.360 --> 3:47:32.360]  because people must listen to your show every day.
[3:47:32.360 --> 3:47:33.360]  They used to, you could listen.
[3:47:33.360 --> 3:47:35.360]  This is an emergency situation.
[3:47:35.360 --> 3:47:38.360]  The people that did the Bolshevik Revolution
[3:47:38.360 --> 3:47:40.360]  and funded Hitler and Mao,
[3:47:40.360 --> 3:47:42.360]  Rockefeller wrote The New York Times,
[3:47:42.360 --> 3:47:43.360]  so they funded Mao and did all that.
[3:47:43.360 --> 3:47:44.360]  They're doing it here.
[3:47:44.360 --> 3:47:47.360]  They destroy the economy to come in with FEMA camps,
[3:47:47.360 --> 3:47:49.360]  re-education, mass murders.
[3:47:49.360 --> 3:47:51.360]  They're going to do it if they think the cops will go along with it.
[3:47:51.360 --> 3:47:52.360]  It's over, police.
[3:47:52.360 --> 3:47:54.360]  You can't suck your thumbs anymore.
[3:47:54.360 --> 3:47:56.360]  Decide who you're with.
[3:47:56.360 --> 3:47:57.360]  Lindsey, please continue.
[3:47:57.360 --> 3:48:00.360]  They create a problem, then they create a solution.
[3:48:00.360 --> 3:48:02.360]  This is the way that they do everything.
[3:48:02.360 --> 3:48:04.360]  I watched them do it on the Franco-Alaska oil pipeline.
[3:48:04.360 --> 3:48:10.360]  They would come in and give a few million dollars to the Sierra Club
[3:48:10.360 --> 3:48:15.360]  and to other groups that were costing them thousands of dollars,
[3:48:15.360 --> 3:48:17.360]  and I asked one of the oil men one day,
[3:48:17.360 --> 3:48:19.360]  I said, why do you give this to your enemies,
[3:48:19.360 --> 3:48:22.360]  the very people that are coming in and causing you to have to spend so much
[3:48:22.360 --> 3:48:24.360]  on this Franco-Alaska oil pipeline?
[3:48:24.360 --> 3:48:26.360]  He said, Chaplain, we play both sides.
[3:48:26.360 --> 3:48:27.360]  They play Republican.
[3:48:27.360 --> 3:48:29.360]  They play Democrat.
[3:48:29.360 --> 3:48:32.360]  They played the conservatives.
[3:48:32.360 --> 3:48:35.360]  They played both sides of everything.
[3:48:35.360 --> 3:48:38.360]  They said, we give these money to them so we can control them.
[3:48:38.360 --> 3:48:41.360]  The name of the game is controlled.
[3:48:41.360 --> 3:48:42.360]  You've heard me say it.
[3:48:42.360 --> 3:48:44.360]  You've heard Alex say it over and over and over.
[3:48:44.360 --> 3:48:45.360]  This is what they want.
[3:48:45.360 --> 3:48:48.360]  It's not necessarily money that they're after.
[3:48:48.360 --> 3:48:51.360]  They already hold that through the Federal Reserve,
[3:48:51.360 --> 3:48:54.360]  through the false evidences around the world.
[3:48:54.360 --> 3:48:56.360]  The name of the game is controlled.
[3:48:56.360 --> 3:48:57.360]  Same thing Hitler did.
[3:48:57.360 --> 3:48:59.360]  Same thing Mussolini did.
[3:48:59.360 --> 3:49:01.360]  Same thing Stalin did.
[3:49:01.360 --> 3:49:05.360]  It's a matter of control of masses of population in humanity.
[3:49:05.360 --> 3:49:08.360]  They're literally obsessed with the control of this nation,
[3:49:08.360 --> 3:49:10.360]  and that's what they're trying to do.
[3:49:10.360 --> 3:49:12.360]  That's why the elites have always been in control.
[3:49:12.360 --> 3:49:16.360]  The elites have always been in control because they're ruthless and cunning,
[3:49:16.360 --> 3:49:20.360]  and the average person doesn't understand how serious the power elite are.
[3:49:20.360 --> 3:49:22.360]  Lindsay, I want to come back and get into any other,
[3:49:22.360 --> 3:49:25.360]  and we know his predictions, but now how those are all manifesting.
[3:49:25.360 --> 3:49:29.360]  Again, I want you specifically why you think George Soros went public
[3:49:29.360 --> 3:49:31.360]  with all of this right now.
[3:49:31.360 --> 3:49:34.360]  But first, folks, we have a lot of time, so listen carefully.
[3:49:34.360 --> 3:49:38.360]  You're now putting out weekly emergency DVD reports that break down this.
[3:49:38.360 --> 3:49:40.360]  Perfect to give people.
[3:49:40.360 --> 3:49:42.360]  How do folks call and get that, Lindsay?
[3:49:42.360 --> 3:49:47.360]  Call number 800-321-2900.
[3:49:47.360 --> 3:49:48.360]  Emergency update.
[3:49:48.360 --> 3:49:50.360]  We're having to update it every so many weeks
[3:49:50.360 --> 3:49:52.360]  because things are happening so fast.
[3:49:52.360 --> 3:49:56.360]  And then last week, I produced for the first time one entitled prophecy.
[3:49:56.360 --> 3:49:57.360]  You've got to see it.
[3:49:57.360 --> 3:49:59.360]  I deal with the prophecy that this man gave.
[3:49:59.360 --> 3:50:02.360]  I call it a prophecy because you know the elite,
[3:50:02.360 --> 3:50:05.360]  even though they aren't God, they think they are.
[3:50:05.360 --> 3:50:08.360]  And they give some things like this gentleman gave me seven months ago,
[3:50:08.360 --> 3:50:11.360]  told me everything that was going to happen for the next year and a half,
[3:50:11.360 --> 3:50:16.360]  and I produced one entitled prophecy because it's what he said was going to happen.
[3:50:16.360 --> 3:50:20.360]  And then I go back to the scriptures and compare this to the one...
[3:50:20.360 --> 3:50:21.360]  Give the number.
[3:50:21.360 --> 3:50:22.360]  Give the number.
[3:50:22.360 --> 3:50:23.360]  Give the number for folks.
[3:50:23.360 --> 3:50:30.360]  The number is 800, the number is toll-free, 800-321-2900.
[3:50:30.360 --> 3:50:32.360]  Two presentations I've done in the last few weeks,
[3:50:32.360 --> 3:50:34.360]  plus the package of two DVDs.
[3:50:34.360 --> 3:50:36.360]  I beg of you for the sake of your dinner table.
[3:50:36.360 --> 3:50:41.360]  800-321-2900.
[3:50:41.360 --> 3:50:42.360]  Absolutely.
[3:50:42.360 --> 3:50:43.360]  And we appreciate your courage doing this.
[3:50:43.360 --> 3:50:45.360]  Okay, briefly, start getting into Soros.
[3:50:45.360 --> 3:50:47.360]  I mean, to have him admit they're imploding the oil price
[3:50:47.360 --> 3:50:49.360]  to bankrupt the planet and their enemies.
[3:50:49.360 --> 3:50:52.360]  I mean, again, this is six and a half months after you go public.
[3:50:52.360 --> 3:50:53.360]  Here they are admitting it.
[3:50:53.360 --> 3:50:54.360]  It's incredible.
[3:50:54.360 --> 3:50:56.360]  Well, I don't think he had any choice.
[3:50:56.360 --> 3:50:58.360]  Alec, can you say why did he do it?
[3:50:58.360 --> 3:51:02.360]  I think he did it because it happened.
[3:51:02.360 --> 3:51:03.360]  He's here.
[3:51:03.360 --> 3:51:05.360]  He knows it's real.
[3:51:05.360 --> 3:51:08.360]  There was no need in trying to hide it any longer.
[3:51:08.360 --> 3:51:13.360]  And I think he did it solely because of the fact he didn't have any choice but to do it.
[3:51:13.360 --> 3:51:15.360]  I'll make his own self look bad.
[3:51:15.360 --> 3:51:18.360]  That's what Bob Chapman said agreeing with you last hour about it.
[3:51:18.360 --> 3:51:19.360]  They've dropped the hammer.
[3:51:19.360 --> 3:51:20.360]  They've gone to the point of return.
[3:51:20.360 --> 3:51:23.360]  They've committed so many public crimes looting with the banks
[3:51:23.360 --> 3:51:25.360]  that either they take over with the world government
[3:51:25.360 --> 3:51:27.360]  or they end up getting brought to justice.
[3:51:27.360 --> 3:51:28.360]  They know that.
[3:51:28.360 --> 3:51:31.360]  They know they're creating a revolution which will create a crisis,
[3:51:31.360 --> 3:51:35.360]  exacerbate their crisis, and they'll come in and smash it as the saviors.
[3:51:35.360 --> 3:51:36.360]  They are making their move.
[3:51:36.360 --> 3:51:38.360]  They have jumped out of the airplane.
[3:51:38.360 --> 3:51:39.360]  They're pulling the ripcord.
[3:51:39.360 --> 3:51:40.360]  Do they have a parachute?
[3:51:40.360 --> 3:51:41.360]  That's up to you.
[3:51:41.360 --> 3:51:44.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, all the pieces have been put in place.
[3:51:44.360 --> 3:51:46.360]  The domino has been flicked.
[3:51:46.360 --> 3:51:47.360]  It's now in motion.
[3:51:47.360 --> 3:51:52.360]  This is toe-to-toe combat with the eugenicist mass murder forces of
[3:51:52.360 --> 3:51:54.360]  what they call themselves Luciferians.
[3:51:54.360 --> 3:51:55.360]  This is it.
[3:51:55.360 --> 3:51:57.360]  It is now upon us.
[3:51:57.360 --> 3:51:59.360]  What are you going to do?
[3:52:01.360 --> 3:52:04.360]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors
[3:52:04.360 --> 3:52:07.360]  in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[3:52:07.360 --> 3:52:12.360]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[3:52:12.360 --> 3:52:17.360]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[3:52:17.360 --> 3:52:21.360]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[3:52:21.360 --> 3:52:26.360]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline
[3:52:26.360 --> 3:52:30.360]  while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[3:52:30.360 --> 3:52:35.360]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[3:52:35.360 --> 3:52:39.360]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste
[3:52:39.360 --> 3:52:42.360]  and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[3:52:42.360 --> 3:52:47.360]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[3:53:09.360 --> 3:53:14.360]  an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[3:53:14.360 --> 3:53:18.360]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation
[3:53:18.360 --> 3:53:21.360]  in which family members receive answers to their questions
[3:53:21.360 --> 3:53:25.360]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[3:53:25.360 --> 3:53:29.360]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[3:53:29.360 --> 3:53:33.360]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings,

[3:54:05.360 --> 3:54:07.360]  You are not alone.
[3:54:07.360 --> 3:54:10.360]  Millions of Americans suffer from restless legs.
[3:54:10.360 --> 3:54:15.360]  Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your legs.
[3:54:15.360 --> 3:54:20.360]  Signs include itching, pulling, tugging, and the feeling that bugs are crawling on your legs.
[3:54:20.360 --> 3:54:25.360]  If having restless legs is preventing you from getting the good night's sleep you deserve
[3:54:25.360 --> 3:54:29.360]  or is preventing you from enjoying life, you need Restulex.
[3:54:29.360 --> 3:54:35.360]  Restulex is an all-natural supplement that contains 74 essential vitamins, minerals, and herbs

[3:55:31.360 --> 3:55:35.360]  I'm going to call this number 430 on Sunday, we will talk to you.
[3:55:35.360 --> 3:55:38.360]  I said we go to calls and the time ran out, I'm going to try to jam in a few here,
[3:55:38.360 --> 3:55:41.360]  but just ask a question of Lindsay's, you can briefly answer it.
[3:55:41.360 --> 3:55:42.360]  I'm only taking one or two of these.
[3:55:42.360 --> 3:55:46.360]  Steve in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[3:55:46.360 --> 3:55:49.360]  Hey, Alex and Hi, Pastor.
[3:55:49.360 --> 3:55:50.360]  Hi, Steve.
[3:55:50.360 --> 3:55:52.360]  Yes.
[3:55:52.360 --> 3:55:53.360]  Go ahead, sir.
[3:55:53.360 --> 3:56:00.360]  I was watching the news today and I saw Gordon Brown addressing the Congress the same way that Obama did last week
[3:56:00.360 --> 3:56:05.360]  with Biden behind him to the right, Pelosi to the left behind him,
[3:56:05.360 --> 3:56:12.360]  and he pretty much sold the Congress and really everybody watching everything but a vacuum cleaner
[3:56:12.360 --> 3:56:16.360]  and announced everything including a new global currency.
[3:56:16.360 --> 3:56:19.360]  I was wondering what you know about his role.
[3:56:19.360 --> 3:56:23.360]  It's here, it's here, I knew that was on today, somebody retapes C-SPAN tonight
[3:56:23.360 --> 3:56:25.360]  or it'll be all over YouTube and Google everywhere else.
[3:56:25.360 --> 3:56:28.360]  Too bad that won't be in the Obama deception, we had to cut it off somewhere.
[3:56:28.360 --> 3:56:31.360]  Thanks for the call and I apologize, we're cutting you off so short.
[3:56:31.360 --> 3:56:33.360]  Lindsay, a comment on that.
[3:56:33.360 --> 3:56:35.360]  I'm so glad that you mentioned global currency.
[3:56:35.360 --> 3:56:40.360]  It's my contention that they're going to bypass the North American Union and the Amaro
[3:56:40.360 --> 3:56:43.360]  and we'll go directly to a global currency, that's just my opinion.
[3:56:43.360 --> 3:56:50.360]  This person did not say that to me back in July but it looks that they have jumped, literally leaped into the future.
[3:56:50.360 --> 3:56:54.360]  Alright Lindsay, I'm going to talk to you for an hour and a half Sunday, 4.30 to 6.00 p.m.
[3:56:54.360 --> 3:56:58.360]  The last hour and a half of the two hour Sunday show will be calling you at this number, sir.
[3:56:58.360 --> 3:57:00.360]  I will see you then, God bless you.
[3:57:00.360 --> 3:57:02.360]  Thank you Alex and likewise.
[3:57:02.360 --> 3:57:06.360]  Lord bless you greatly because you have such a voice out there and a watchman on the wall.
[3:57:06.360 --> 3:57:08.360]  Well, how will we not do what we do?
[3:57:08.360 --> 3:57:12.360]  I mean we're just telling the truth and we know what's happening so you too my friend, God bless you, take care.
[3:57:12.360 --> 3:57:15.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can't get to everybody else.
[3:57:15.360 --> 3:57:18.360]  Kevin and Joy and Mark and Jay and everybody else.
[3:57:18.360 --> 3:57:20.360]  We're just out of time for this transmission.
[3:57:20.360 --> 3:57:25.360]  Jason Burmes is coming up tonight, 9 to midnight here on the Genesis Network and streaming at infowars.com
[3:57:25.360 --> 3:57:27.360]  and prismplanet.tv will be able to view it.
[3:57:27.360 --> 3:57:30.360]  Please spread the word about that and I'm up here at night a lot so I pop in on the show as well.
[3:57:30.360 --> 3:57:32.360]  A lot of important informative guests there.
[3:57:32.360 --> 3:57:36.360]  I just want to bring them up for a minute and a half at the end of the show because yes it funds this operation
[3:57:36.360 --> 3:57:41.360]  but it's a great deal and we need more capital to operate but really not much comes in.
[3:57:41.360 --> 3:57:46.360]  Compared to the cost we have with Ted because his discounts is so low.
[3:57:46.360 --> 3:57:50.360]  I want to bring Ted in for a minute and a half at the end with all this craziness with the banks going on.
[3:57:50.360 --> 3:57:53.360]  People are insane about getting the gold and silver right now.
[3:57:53.360 --> 3:57:57.360]  It's gone up several hundred dollars in the last month and cost it dropped back a little bit.
[3:57:57.360 --> 3:58:00.360]  Now is the time to move and Ted has some really good deals for you briefly Ted.
[3:58:00.360 --> 3:58:02.360]  Give folks today's offer.
[3:58:02.360 --> 3:58:09.360]  Yeah, right now Frank said 220 British sovereigns at 262 Franklin halves at 869.
[3:58:09.360 --> 3:58:13.360]  All those are really good by Alex and you're just exactly right on the money on that.
[3:58:13.360 --> 3:58:15.360]  Unemployment figures came out.
[3:58:15.360 --> 3:58:19.360]  The markets, the gold, the bank stocks.
[3:58:19.360 --> 3:58:26.360]  I mean everything out there is just it's turmoil and trouble and this is one of those opportunities that we've always talked about it.
[3:58:26.360 --> 3:58:28.360]  How I'm buying low, holding on to it.
[3:58:28.360 --> 3:58:34.360]  The market goes up and I get a chance to sell it at a higher and sell it at a discount to the higher prices there.
[3:58:34.360 --> 3:58:38.360]  Right now is one of those times where I'm in there just accumulating all I can.
[3:58:38.360 --> 3:58:44.360]  I'm smart enough to know that the economic problems of the United States of America have not been solved.
[3:58:44.360 --> 3:58:46.360]  And now is the time to be buying hands.
[3:58:46.360 --> 3:58:48.360]  They're inflating the currency like gangbusters.
[3:58:48.360 --> 3:58:50.360]  The banks are teetering and imploding all around us.
[3:58:50.360 --> 3:58:52.360]  Folks, give them a call. You can't beat these deals.
[3:58:52.360 --> 3:58:55.360]  You also have the silver dollars at an insane price.
[3:58:55.360 --> 3:58:56.360]  The silver half dollars.
[3:58:56.360 --> 3:58:57.360]  Yep, sure do.
[3:58:57.360 --> 3:58:58.360]  Yep, we sure do.
[3:58:58.360 --> 3:59:03.360]  800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[3:59:03.360 --> 3:59:04.360]  Here's that number.
[3:59:04.360 --> 3:59:05.360]  They'll be there until midnight tonight.
[3:59:05.360 --> 3:59:09.360]  Simple standard time on those deals you just heard. Take advantage of it or you're insane in my opinion.
[3:59:09.360 --> 3:59:12.360]  800-686-2237.
[3:59:12.360 --> 3:59:14.360]  Ted Anderson, thank you for joining us.
[3:59:14.360 --> 3:59:15.360]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[3:59:15.360 --> 3:59:16.360]  You bet.
[3:59:16.360 --> 3:59:19.360]  We're going to go into the first hour and second hour today.
[3:59:19.360 --> 3:59:26.360]  I did a devastating analysis of the FEMA camps with the video clips, the documents, the counter to Glenn Beck and his whitewashing while acting like he's a patriot.
[3:59:26.360 --> 3:59:30.360]  Key info coming up in the retransmission right now at infowars.com.
[3:59:30.360 --> 3:59:35.360]  On the audio streams, we'll be back in 70 seconds in Burma's 9 to Midnight Tonight Central.
[3:59:35.360 --> 3:59:36.360]  God bless you all.
[3:59:36.360 --> 4:00:01.360]  We'll see you at prisonplanet.tv on the Obama Deception, March 15th.
