[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.049]  And so on.

[00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.051]  Not the pictures of the bikini babes and such, but the results.
[00:00:06.051 --> 00:00:11.373]  Have you checked their pricing and the funky three-month contracts and all that stuff?
[00:00:11.373 --> 00:00:12.554]  Have you checked their results?
[00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:13.654]  Oh, that's right, I said that.
[00:00:13.654 --> 00:00:16.115]  Did you check the ingredients and you checked for caffeine?
[00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:17.375]  Yeah!
[00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:19.236]  Life Change Tea's the real deal.
[00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:24.298]  Not a new yippee-yi-yay tea, but a tea if you drink it daily, it'll change your life.
[00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:25.739]  And it will clean your body.

[00:00:53.263 --> 00:01:04.812]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:01:04.812 --> 00:01:06.113]  Big Brother.
[00:01:06.113 --> 00:01:07.894]  Mainstream media.
[00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:09.635]  Government cover-ups.
[00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:11.236]  You want answers?
[00:01:11.236 --> 00:01:12.777]  Well, so does he.
[00:01:12.777 --> 00:01:16.981]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:21.044]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:31.214 --> 00:01:33.235]  It is Wednesday, the fourth day of March 2009.
[00:01:33.235 --> 00:01:37.958]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:44.041]  Normally I have Bob Chapman on once a week, but I've got him popping in for about 15 minutes today to break down the plunge of the stock market below 7,000.
[00:01:46.516 --> 00:02:04.062]  Pastor Lindsey Williams, you know, his inside information has been proven to be so accurate and so important, and now we've had Davos Switzerland forum members admit that they're using oil as a weapon against the world to bring it into depression, so the planet will accept the new world order.
[00:02:04.062 --> 00:02:10.645]  He'll be joining us for an hour to have open phones and take your calls, and then another state representative is joining us.
[00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:18.889]  From a separate state, a state we haven't had on yet, who is attempting to declare sovereignty against the Feds.
[00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.511]  So, that is coming up today.
[00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:35.038]  Listen, I get literally 30, 40, 50 emails a day, comments on the websites, phone calls, questions on the street about Glenn Beck.
[00:02:35.038 --> 00:02:35.878]  And Glenn Beck
[00:02:37.512 --> 00:03:00.926]  Comes out and says they're setting up a new world order with a global bank ruling all of us, and that it's a bad thing, and then he always sandwiches it into, Al Qaeda's going to get us, Russia's going to get us, we've, you know, got to deal with American terrorists, Ron Paul supporters need to be arrested, the army needs to move against them.
[00:03:00.926 --> 00:03:05.389]  So he sandwiches that type of propaganda in with it.
[00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:09.046]  Over and over again.
[00:03:09.046 --> 00:03:20.450]  And it's clear what he's doing, because so many people have woken up to the New World Order through the alternative media, the establishment is having to admit its existence, but then putting their own spin on it.
[00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.233]  Now some people liken Glenn Beck to Lou Dobbs, and say, well Alex, you say you like Lou Dobbs, why don't you like Glenn Beck?
[00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:32.955]  No, Lou Dobbs, for years, we're talking
[00:03:34.238 --> 00:03:39.181]  At least seven, eight years that I know of has been talking about the New World Order, the North American Union, the Napa Superhighway.
[00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:41.442]  And it's been a great paradox.
[00:03:41.442 --> 00:03:50.447]  If we know the media is controlled, how is he allowed to get on there and about 95% of the time tell the truth?
[00:03:50.447 --> 00:03:52.688]  We've had Lou Dobbs on the show.
[00:03:52.688 --> 00:03:55.529]  It's completely separate from Glenn Beck.
[00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:56.110]  Glenn Beck
[00:03:57.614 --> 00:04:15.341]  When you hear his radio show, because I scan around in the morning when I'm getting ready to different talk show hosts, hear what they have to say, almost every time I tune in he's like, I hate 9-11 victims' families that say it's an inside job, I hate 9-11 truthers, they're scum, they're trash, they're idiots.
[00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:18.923]  Somebody who does something similar is Michael Wiener Savage.
[00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:20.824]  The real name's Michael Wiener.
[00:04:20.824 --> 00:04:25.966]  He'll say, yeah, there's a new world order of global government, it's run by the Arabs, and we've got to counter it.
[00:04:27.486 --> 00:04:36.637]  So they do this very simple bait and switch, and then I saw a clip yesterday, now I've seen several others, where Glenn Beck is on the air saying,
[00:04:37.785 --> 00:04:51.188]  Yeah, I keep hearing about these FEMA camps, and I'm going to have to investigate them and find out if they're real, then he makes a joke and says, but Fox News won't let me cover it, because I'm controlled, it's controlled, you know, whole conspiracy theory, and then makes a joke.
[00:04:51.188 --> 00:05:04.050]  So he brings up FEMA camps that are openly admitted, openly all over the news, and then he acts like he's the only person talking about it, then he makes a joke about it, and then next cuts to Vladimir Putin is going to attack us, and we've got to learn to, you know, single out evil,
[00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.692]  And Russia wants to go after the United States.
[00:05:07.692 --> 00:05:17.778]  Meanwhile, as you know, on 888, last year, a sneak attack was launched against Georgia, and then Russia came in with forces, and World War III almost commenced.
[00:05:17.778 --> 00:05:24.122]  You know, it's just incredible propaganda out of the sky, and some people in the comments section are like,
[00:05:26.564 --> 00:05:28.445]  You know, we ought to be glad Beck's coming out.
[00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:31.327]  Well, he's not coming out against the New World Order.
[00:05:31.327 --> 00:05:34.709]  I mean, this is Fox News, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:42.973]  This is a psy-op, and every time he covers something true, to get people's confidence, he then slips in a bunch of disinfo.
[00:05:42.973 --> 00:05:46.355]  So, Glenn Beck says he doesn't know if the FEMA camps exist or not.
[00:05:46.355 --> 00:05:48.696]  He also says maybe they're good.
[00:05:48.696 --> 00:05:49.517]  Maybe they're good.
[00:05:49.517 --> 00:05:51.018]  That's a quote.
[00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:51.938]  You know, maybe they're good.
[00:05:51.938 --> 00:05:52.679]  Maybe we need them.
[00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:54.620]  No, we don't need them.
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.305]  So coming up at the start of the next hour, we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:58.305 --> 00:06:00.768]  I'm going to detail it.
[00:06:00.768 --> 00:06:02.130]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.533]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[00:06:04.533 --> 00:06:08.698]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:06:08.698 --> 00:06:10.640]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[00:06:16.016 --> 00:06:24.863]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[00:06:24.863 --> 00:06:31.228]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[00:06:31.228 --> 00:06:34.831]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[00:06:34.831 --> 00:06:38.974]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[00:06:46.943 --> 00:06:49.804]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:06:49.804 --> 00:06:51.025]  And we knew what to do.
[00:06:51.025 --> 00:06:52.605]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:52.605 --> 00:06:56.407]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:07:16.934 --> 00:07:25.466]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:07:25.834 --> 00:07:32.941]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:07:32.941 --> 00:07:36.124]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:07:36.124 --> 00:07:41.889]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:44.972]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:07:44.972 --> 00:07:51.698]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:08.910]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:14.035]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:14.915]  and Canada.
[00:08:14.915 --> 00:08:21.441]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[00:08:21.983 --> 00:08:25.387]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[00:08:25.387 --> 00:08:27.829]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[00:08:27.829 --> 00:08:34.436]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[00:08:34.436 --> 00:08:37.960]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.

[00:09:00.452 --> 00:09:05.854]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:09:05.854 --> 00:09:08.135]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:09:25.282 --> 00:09:32.268]  Coming up in 52 minutes, I'm going to do a 30-minute report on the FEMA camps.
[00:09:32.268 --> 00:09:36.031]  I'm not going to spend the whole time getting into Glenn Beck.
[00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:45.100]  But we're going to lay out the facts about the FEMA camps in the United States in our prison population period, how this is a military-industrial prison complex.
[00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:54.565]  And then I'll break down the propaganda coming out of the mainstream media because now it is hundreds of articles per day.
[00:09:54.565 --> 00:09:57.511]  I mean hundreds of articles per day.
[00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:22.028]  You can go to Google, type in New World Order, click Google News, and there will be over a hundred articles that are just published per day, all saying the New World Order is here, it will be ruled by a world bank owned by private interest, you will pay carbon taxes to it, this is the only way to get the economy going again.
[00:10:22.028 --> 00:10:24.009]  See, they're giving us an offer we can't refuse.
[00:10:24.009 --> 00:10:27.391]  They implode the economy by design, the central bank set this up,
[00:10:29.298 --> 00:10:33.759]  And then now they are openly announcing that it is a world government.
[00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:43.361]  And of course they have a few little voices in the mainstream media so it keeps some semblance of credibility who will mildly criticize the new world order.
[00:10:43.361 --> 00:10:50.482]  But in the case of Glenn Beck, we've found like four of these now where he keeps saying, I'm going to see if these FEMA camps are real.
[00:10:50.482 --> 00:10:55.603]  Then he makes little jokes and we're going to see if it's really happening and he makes more jokes.
[00:10:55.603 --> 00:10:58.104]  And then he says in one of the clips, he says, well,
[00:11:02.591 --> 00:11:07.513]  Well, you know, depending on how you look at the government, maybe these FEMA camps are a good thing.
[00:11:07.513 --> 00:11:09.674]  He said that on Fox and Friends.
[00:11:09.674 --> 00:11:16.077]  In fact, Jaren, we don't have time to play all these clips here, but on the Fox and Friends clip, just watch it.
[00:11:16.077 --> 00:11:17.978]  I think it's a couple minutes in.
[00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:19.479]  He starts talking about the FEMA camps.
[00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:26.386]  And everybody really does look freaked out on Fox News because they've all been told this is real, we're really going into martial law probably.
[00:11:26.386 --> 00:11:29.269]  And he then says, maybe they're a good thing.
[00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:30.710]  Maybe the camps are a good thing.
[00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.194]  Because he says, I've been trying to discredit them, but I really can't.
[00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:37.898]  But then he goes, but maybe they're a good thing.
[00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:39.640]  And this is the guy.
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:47.843]  Who said over and over again we need to use the army against the American people.
[00:11:47.843 --> 00:11:51.646]  You swear an oath when you're in the army to fight all enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:56.889]  And, well, the Army needs to deal with these Ron Paul supporters.
[00:11:56.889 --> 00:11:58.350]  They're dangerous.
[00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.213]  And then he'll say, what do we do about the collapsing economy, the New World Order?
[00:12:01.213 --> 00:12:02.834]  You know, the good old boys, what are they going to do?
[00:12:02.834 --> 00:12:04.316]  They've got guns!
[00:12:04.316 --> 00:12:10.762]  See, it's, it's, it's, it's, he'll admit, oh, there's a New World Order, but maybe the camps are good, and maybe the good old boys need to be dealt with.
[00:12:10.762 --> 00:12:12.744]  The Ron Paul people need to be arrested.
[00:12:12.744 --> 00:12:16.548]  He mixes this thing in one day, and the next day it's Ron Paul on.
[00:12:18.288 --> 00:12:19.869]  Well, and Congressman, what do you think of these FEMA camps?
[00:12:19.869 --> 00:12:29.217]  And Ron Paul goes, well, you know, they've only introduced a bill for the camps, but I think there is a concern because the government's so out of control.
[00:12:29.217 --> 00:12:30.939]  I mean, just incredible.
[00:12:30.939 --> 00:12:37.985]  But I'm not going to spend too much of the time next hour on Glenn Beck himself.
[00:12:37.985 --> 00:12:44.651]  I thought that I would get into the admission of the camps, the camps already built,
[00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:56.157]  Where you can find 24 of the Army camps, according to Army.mil, and just hopefully finally clear the air here for people.
[00:12:56.157 --> 00:13:00.200]  I mean, I've made, I don't know, five of my films get into the FEMA camps.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.662]  Oh, I forgot one more clip I want you to get.
[00:13:02.662 --> 00:13:03.502]  He's in there with dozens.
[00:13:03.502 --> 00:13:05.224]  We'll never get to them all.
[00:13:05.224 --> 00:13:15.491]  Just Google Oliver North FEMA camps, the same one you played on Burmese's show last night, and we'll play some Senate hearings, House-Senate joint sessions, or ANCONTRA.
[00:13:16.874 --> 00:13:26.699]  Colonel North, I read in the Miami Papers and other papers about your plan to suspend the Constitution and hold Americans in detention centers.
[00:13:26.699 --> 00:13:30.361]  Congressman Jack Brooks.
[00:13:30.361 --> 00:13:42.468]  And then they cut to the Chairman in a way and he says, that is classified information, we will not discuss that now, if you'd like to discuss that, arrangements can be made to discuss it upon executive session.
[00:13:47.293 --> 00:13:58.139]  So that's going on there.
[00:13:58.139 --> 00:14:04.463]  But you have to understand that what they do psychologically is they deny the camps, they deny the New World Order, they deny
[00:14:06.223 --> 00:14:06.403]  I think?
[00:14:37.244 --> 00:14:43.132]  Until you acquiesce to NORTHCOM brigades on the streets of America.
[00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:49.580]  Until you acquiesce to local FEMA camps merging with your local police and state police and clergy.
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.585]  Until you acquiesce to total control and everything you do being micromanaged.
[00:14:54.690 --> 00:15:05.594]  And then the government's there with handouts and mortgage help and welfare cards, now going to just the mainline general public and the middle class as they implode down into total poverty.
[00:15:05.594 --> 00:15:09.175]  They're saying, yeah, we don't like it, but what do we do?
[00:15:09.175 --> 00:15:21.619]  And suddenly all these operatives like Pat Robertson and others, supposedly conservatives, come out and say, we all need to accept that socialism is good and will save America, and that Obama is unstoppable.
[00:15:21.619 --> 00:15:22.860]  God told me!
[00:15:25.885 --> 00:15:29.818]  And suddenly you have all these supposed other conservative leaders saying, well, it's what we've got to do.
[00:15:29.818 --> 00:15:32.526]  It's, you know, that or a crisis turning into a catastrophe.
[00:15:35.424 --> 00:15:37.925]  Meanwhile, you have all this other news.
[00:15:37.925 --> 00:15:39.326]  Russian scholar says U.S.
[00:15:39.326 --> 00:15:41.127]  will collapse in the next year.
[00:15:41.127 --> 00:15:44.589]  Now, the Pentagon says they're planning to collapse the U.S.
[00:15:44.589 --> 00:15:46.110]  They're preparing for it.
[00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.371]  The Army War College says it.
[00:15:47.371 --> 00:15:49.112]  The British Ministry of Defense says it.
[00:15:49.112 --> 00:15:50.433]  All these big corporations say it.
[00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:52.494]  All these top trends forecasters say it.
[00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:58.617]  But when Fox News and the Wall Street Journal and My News Corp report on it, it's the dirty Russians.
[00:15:58.617 --> 00:16:00.579]  They are making America collapse.
[00:16:00.579 --> 00:16:02.220]  They want America to collapse.
[00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:04.779]  That's what Beck will do.
[00:16:04.779 --> 00:16:06.580]  It's a talking point, a psych warfare point.
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.800]  I see it everywhere.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:16.903]  You know it's a talking point when they all say it in unison.
[00:16:16.903 --> 00:16:26.785]  They come out and they say, New World Order, World Bankers, World Government, FEMA Camps, Martial Law, and then they go, Russia, Iran.
[00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:32.487]  They'll just flip gears and say, yeah, it's really dangerous, and go right into, with no connection,
[00:16:34.312 --> 00:16:39.457]  To Iran and Russia and other nations the globalists want to attack.
[00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:54.473]  They get you all scared, oh there's an enemy, there's a new world order, and then they just flip-flop it, thinking you're so weak-minded you won't notice it, and without even making an intellectual connection, they just segue right into, we're being menaced by Russia, we're being menaced by Iran, we're being menaced by all these other countries.
[00:16:59.414 --> 00:17:00.435]  This is what they do.
[00:17:00.435 --> 00:17:17.163]  Meanwhile, the globalists have planned to collapse this economy and bring us into the New World Order instead of, as they collapse the economy, having the states declare sovereignty on the 9th and 10th Amendment and reconstitute the federal government under a constitutional system and arrest all these criminals that run our government.
[00:17:17.163 --> 00:17:18.524]  Those are the two
[00:17:20.916 --> 00:17:22.517]  Options, we really have.
[00:17:22.517 --> 00:17:24.939]  There are a few other sub-options.
[00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:28.381]  Russian scholar says US will collapse next year, Fox News.
[00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:34.926]  If you're inclined to believe Igor Panarin and the Kremlin, wouldn't mind if you did.
[00:17:34.926 --> 00:17:36.267]  Oh, the Kremlin.
[00:17:36.267 --> 00:17:38.768]  The President Barack Obama will order martial law this year.
[00:17:38.768 --> 00:17:40.409]  Sorry, we're already under martial law.
[00:17:40.409 --> 00:17:46.233]  Congress has been told they can't see congressional documents, that they can't see White House documents.
[00:17:46.233 --> 00:17:48.335]  The cover sheet says the President's a dictator.
[00:17:50.114 --> 00:17:52.056]  P-51 and others.
[00:17:52.056 --> 00:17:53.377]  Let's see, oh, it's about the Russians.
[00:17:53.377 --> 00:17:54.238]  They say it.
[00:17:54.238 --> 00:17:58.122]  So, see, when anybody else talks about this now, people go, that's ruski propaganda!
[00:17:58.122 --> 00:18:00.184]  Meanwhile, the Pentagon's been planning it all.
[00:18:00.184 --> 00:18:10.114]  NORTHCOM is the receivership physical thug, the soldier, for the Mafia to carry this out.
[00:18:10.114 --> 00:18:12.157]  Barack Obama will order martial law this year.
[00:18:12.157 --> 00:18:12.517]  The U.S.
[00:18:12.517 --> 00:18:13.238]  will split into six
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:24.622]  Rump states before 2011 and Russia and China will become the backbones of a new world order.
[00:18:24.622 --> 00:18:26.242]  Yeah, over in Russia, it's openly discussed.
[00:18:26.242 --> 00:18:30.443]  They say, well, you want a world government, but we're going to run the world government.
[00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.884]  It's just openly discussed who's going to run the world government.
[00:18:32.884 --> 00:18:38.565]  Meanwhile, the average neocon is still sending me emails saying it doesn't exist because Pillhead Limbaugh says it doesn't.
[00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:52.951]  Panarin might be easy to ignore, but for the fact that he is the Dean of the Foreign Military School for Future Diplomats, and a regular on Russian state-guided TV channels, like Fox News is a state-guided,
[00:18:53.931 --> 00:18:58.173]  And his predictions fit into an anti-American storyline of the Kremlin leadership.
[00:18:58.173 --> 00:19:05.717]  No, the Kremlin, when they source this, say that the European Union and the Anglo-American establishment want to break the U.S.
[00:19:05.717 --> 00:19:15.603]  up into the FEMA regions, and want to create sectarian violence with Latin Americans that are filling the Southwest, and that the British Ministry of Defense says they're setting this up.
[00:19:15.603 --> 00:19:18.564]  But see, they don't actually link to those reports.
[00:19:18.564 --> 00:19:19.765]  They don't want you to know that.
[00:19:20.345 --> 00:19:28.573]  That Russia is in horror at this, saying, please don't move weapon systems around us, please don't attack us.
[00:19:28.573 --> 00:19:34.158]  There is a high probability that the collapse of the United States will occur by 2010.
[00:19:34.158 --> 00:19:44.868]  Panarin told dozens of students, professors, and diplomats Tuesday at the Diplomatic Academy, a lecture of the ministry, pointedly invited the Associated Press and foreign media to attend.
[00:19:47.415 --> 00:19:57.245]  The prediction by Panarin, a former spokesman for Russia's Federal Space Agency, and reportedly an ex-KGB analyst, matches the negative view of the U.S.
[00:19:57.245 --> 00:20:03.150]  that has been flowing from the Kremlin in recent years, in particular from Vladimir Putin.
[00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:10.918]  Putin, the former president, who is now Prime Minister, is liking the United States and Nazi Germany's Third Reich, and blames Washington for the global financial crisis that pounded the Russian economy.
[00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:17.959]  And the article goes on to say that the Russian analyst didn't give any details.
[00:20:17.959 --> 00:20:22.620]  Yes he did, and his writings are everywhere.
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:37.263]  So see, the globalists have hijacked the United States, they're starting World War III, and they want to introduce this that they're going to collapse the United States, and they're going to blame it on Russia, not the bankers.
[00:20:37.263 --> 00:20:37.963]  See how this works?
[00:20:39.181 --> 00:20:41.102]  And they are going to implode things, I have no doubt.
[00:20:41.102 --> 00:20:43.464]  Riots, martial law, you name it.
[00:20:43.464 --> 00:20:46.265]  It's pretty clear they're going to go ahead and pull the trigger on us.
[00:20:46.265 --> 00:20:53.289]  And then they'll tell you Putin did it on the news, and the public will go to the red lines and throw rocks at pictures of Putin.
[00:20:53.289 --> 00:20:54.390]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:21:02.162 --> 00:21:04.004]  Life Change Tea sets the standard.
[00:21:04.004 --> 00:21:11.089]  Have you heard on radio all the new teas with funny names, movie stars, celebrities endorsing these products and so on?
[00:21:11.089 --> 00:21:12.691]  Have you checked the results?
[00:21:12.691 --> 00:21:16.074]  Not the pictures of the bikini babes and such, but the results.
[00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:21.418]  Have you checked their pricing and the funky three-month contracts and all that stuff?
[00:21:21.418 --> 00:21:22.619]  Have you checked their results?
[00:21:22.619 --> 00:21:23.700]  Oh, that's right, I said that.
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.162]  Did you check the ingredients and you check for caffeine?
[00:21:26.162 --> 00:21:26.662]  Yeah!
[00:21:27.423 --> 00:21:29.284]  Life Change Tea is the real deal.
[00:21:29.284 --> 00:21:34.305]  Not a new yippee-yi-yay tea, but a tea if you drink it daily, it'll change your life.
[00:21:34.305 --> 00:21:35.766]  And it will clean your body.
[00:21:35.766 --> 00:21:37.086]  Our middle name is Results.
[00:21:37.086 --> 00:21:39.467]  You can pay more and you can have a celebrity smile.

[00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:41.128]  Your call.
[00:21:41.128 --> 00:21:43.388]  Or should I say, make the call.
[00:21:43.388 --> 00:21:44.069]  Get the tea at 928-308-0408.
[00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:44.389]  That's 928-308-0408.

[00:21:46.429 --> 00:21:47.350]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[00:21:57.253 --> 00:21:59.054]  Order now for real results.
[00:22:09.815 --> 00:22:11.356]  But who is the enemy?
[00:22:11.356 --> 00:22:12.176]  Bin Laden.
[00:22:12.176 --> 00:22:13.197]  This is his M.O.
[00:22:13.197 --> 00:22:14.538]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:22:14.538 --> 00:22:16.519]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:22:16.519 --> 00:22:23.683]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:22:23.683 --> 00:22:24.163]  Some U.S.
[00:22:24.163 --> 00:22:29.807]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:22:30.507 --> 00:22:34.008]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:22:34.008 --> 00:22:36.809]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:23:00.666 --> 00:23:04.728]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:23:04.728 --> 00:23:10.612]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:23:10.612 --> 00:23:11.732]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:23:11.732 --> 00:23:15.775]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:23:16.435 --> 00:23:30.247]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:23:30.247 --> 00:23:35.852]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:23:35.852 --> 00:23:41.677]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:23:42.478 --> 00:23:43.759]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:45.481]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:23:45.481 --> 00:23:45.901]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:45.901 --> 00:23:47.943]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:23:47.943 --> 00:23:48.003]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:00.484 --> 00:24:02.465]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:24:02.465 --> 00:24:09.447]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:24:09.447 --> 00:24:17.830]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:23.552]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:24:23.732 --> 00:24:25.573]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:24:25.573 --> 00:24:27.754]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:24:27.754 --> 00:24:32.297]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:24:32.297 --> 00:24:34.518]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:24:34.518 --> 00:24:41.982]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:24:42.142 --> 00:24:42.602]  I'm healthy.
[00:25:12.506 --> 00:25:26.350]  You know, I made some preparations last night to go over the FEMA camps, and the problem I've got is I literally have hundreds of documents and news articles printed off here in front of me.
[00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:29.151]  It's over a hundred.
[00:25:29.151 --> 00:25:41.454]  The bills, the executive orders, the presidential decision directives, the mainstream news admitting that Bush wanted to become a dictator and get rid of posse commentatus, which they've done, and make the president a dictator.
[00:25:43.677 --> 00:25:45.300]  They talk about banning free speech.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.886]  It's all public.
[00:25:47.886 --> 00:25:52.175]  And then, meanwhile, Glenn Beck, as if he's the arbiter of all of this, comes on and says,
[00:25:53.658 --> 00:25:54.679]  I'm investigating it.
[00:25:54.679 --> 00:25:56.960]  I'll let you know if it's true or not, but I've been looking at it.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.561]  It looks like it's true.
[00:25:58.561 --> 00:26:00.282]  Looks like it's true.
[00:26:00.282 --> 00:26:02.404]  Never giving any evidence when it's all there.
[00:26:02.404 --> 00:26:05.266]  And then saying, but maybe it's a good idea.
[00:26:05.266 --> 00:26:06.767]  In fact, John, I forgot to ask you during the break.
[00:26:06.767 --> 00:26:08.908]  We're going to be playing some video clips in the next hour.
[00:26:08.908 --> 00:26:10.669]  We have to limit that because of time.
[00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:16.893]  Did you pull out that specific audio clip of him talking about it being a good idea I sent you?
[00:26:16.893 --> 00:26:19.495]  Let's go ahead and play some of that right now.
[00:26:21.287 --> 00:26:23.689]  Okay, so it's coming up.
[00:26:23.689 --> 00:26:24.409]  We have limited staff.
[00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:27.171]  I got two guys, one in Minnesota working on this and Jaron out there.
[00:26:27.171 --> 00:26:32.654]  I literally came in and handed Jaron a stack of about a hundred articles and said put all these in the computer.
[00:26:32.654 --> 00:26:35.056]  That is pull them up so we can put them on screen.
[00:26:35.056 --> 00:26:39.939]  He's in there writing a cue list up so I can try to go through all these on air as he puts them on screen.
[00:26:39.939 --> 00:26:46.063]  Because the public's been conditioned not to believe any of this because they were told for decades it didn't exist while the infrastructure was being built.
[00:26:48.686 --> 00:26:51.907]  And you know what, I'm going to do a full hour on this tomorrow.
[00:26:51.907 --> 00:26:54.848]  I know we've booked so many guests, but I may have to cancel some guests.
[00:26:54.848 --> 00:26:59.309]  In fact, I'm on the verge of canceling guests right now.
[00:26:59.309 --> 00:27:05.710]  Because I don't know if I can do justice to this in 30 minutes, and this needs to be done properly.
[00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:06.791]  Responsibility, folks.
[00:27:09.309 --> 00:27:11.170]  I mean, here's the type of news I got in front of me.
[00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:12.772]  Fox News, Russian scholar says U.S.
[00:27:12.772 --> 00:27:14.653]  will collapse next year.
[00:27:14.653 --> 00:27:16.434]  Here's another one, Russian general says U.S.
[00:27:16.434 --> 00:27:18.316]  may have planned satellite collision.
[00:27:18.316 --> 00:27:20.738]  It was like one out of a hundred million that would happen.
[00:27:20.738 --> 00:27:23.200]  The New World Order on CNN, Lou Dobbs tonight.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.421]  Lou Dobbs, totally different from Glenn Beck.
[00:27:25.421 --> 00:27:28.063]  Very credibly covers all of this.
[00:27:28.063 --> 00:27:29.484]  And whereas he doesn't go far enough,
[00:27:30.447 --> 00:27:34.689]  I've talked to him off air and had him on air, and he is a good guy.
[00:27:34.689 --> 00:27:39.411]  And he signed a contract years ago to where he had editorial control over the show.
[00:27:39.411 --> 00:27:41.672]  You can then ask why does CNN allow this?
[00:27:41.672 --> 00:27:44.033]  It's to keep some credibility.
[00:27:44.033 --> 00:27:54.877]  But he said they're calling for a new rule of order last night, and he broke down, it's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, the video's posted, that they're setting up a world banking dictatorship.
[00:27:57.992 --> 00:28:06.036]  So, continuing here, John Dean says Bush almost became an unconstitutional dictator going over these memos.
[00:28:06.036 --> 00:28:17.882]  No, Bush's job was to vest unconstitutional dictatorial powers and to continue the construction of the technological control grid, and he did that.
[00:28:17.882 --> 00:28:23.705]  See, the left is always making it look like Naomi Wolf, not saying she's a bad lady, she just made it all about
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.301]  George Bush.
[00:28:26.301 --> 00:28:27.942]  And I said, you watch, lady.
[00:28:27.942 --> 00:28:30.184]  Let's get her back on.
[00:28:30.184 --> 00:28:31.505]  It's all going to continue under Obama.
[00:28:32.583 --> 00:28:37.444]  Meanwhile, you know, we've been covering the clergy response teams a lot here on air.
[00:28:37.444 --> 00:28:42.765]  Two years before it was declassified and made public, we had the secret documents.
[00:28:42.765 --> 00:28:44.986]  26,000 preachers now, integrated in with now over 50,000.
[00:28:44.986 --> 00:28:57.229]  I keep saying 25,000, it's now officially 50,000 executives in InfraGard with shoot-to-kill orders, licensed-to-kill orders under FBI secret deputization.
[00:28:57.229 --> 00:28:59.610]  That's been in mainstream news.
[00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:01.170]  So they've got secret spies there.
[00:29:02.662 --> 00:29:06.443]  But a church document encourages congregation to obey government.
[00:29:06.443 --> 00:29:13.045]  Shocking provision of Romans 13 claims that pro-abortion Obama is God's minister and we must obey everything he says.
[00:29:13.045 --> 00:29:20.006]  We got these memos that were passed out to not just the higher ups in the church but to the church goers.
[00:29:20.006 --> 00:29:24.728]  And this is just more examples of people on the government FEMA payroll.
[00:29:24.728 --> 00:29:26.388]  That's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:26.388 --> 00:29:29.629]  Church document encourages congregation to obey Obama.
[00:29:31.263 --> 00:29:33.325]  So that's up on the site right now.
[00:29:33.325 --> 00:29:42.912]  And then I first covered this a few weeks ago, and I see these reports all the time, and I got emails and comments on InfoWars and Prison Planet on the story we linked to saying I was making it up.
[00:29:42.912 --> 00:29:52.159]  I mean, it was a link to the Miami Herald and other newspapers where the babies, women, will show up when the abortionist is late playing golf in this case.
[00:29:53.681 --> 00:30:04.635]  And so she had the baby, it was alive, so they went and threw it up against the wall, and then went and threw it in a trash can for a week, and it was fed on by rats and roaches.
[00:30:04.635 --> 00:30:05.476]  People didn't like that.
[00:30:07.048 --> 00:30:11.170]  In fact, I had a radio station call him and say, that's it, you're off the air.
[00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:19.913]  I'm bad because I read the Miami Herald on air and because some people out there are pro-abortion and don't want to face up to the fact that they kill babies even after they're born.
[00:30:19.913 --> 00:30:21.894]  I mean, okay, fine.
[00:30:21.894 --> 00:30:24.215]  Have you not figured out, folks, that I lost
[00:30:24.955 --> 00:30:31.478]  More than two-thirds of my stations, when I came out and said 9-11 was an inside job, and we built the show back to bigger than ever.
[00:30:31.478 --> 00:30:33.999]  I'm not compromising when it comes to killing babies, okay?
[00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:36.740]  You can go straight to hell, as far as I'm concerned.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:37.800]  You understand that?
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.101]  You get that straight through your head.
[00:30:40.101 --> 00:30:40.581]  Alright, good.
[00:30:40.581 --> 00:30:42.882]  I'm glad you understand that.
[00:30:42.882 --> 00:30:50.906]  If you want the blood of these dead kids on your soul, that's fine, but just get out of my way, you understand?
[00:30:50.906 --> 00:30:52.286]  We're on the march.
[00:30:52.286 --> 00:30:53.807]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:54.793 --> 00:31:00.655]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:31:00.655 --> 00:31:06.076]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:31:06.076 --> 00:31:15.279]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes are full of chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:18.720]  Did you know that most multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.901]  Did you know that many herbal remedies contain unwanted additives and fillers?
[00:31:22.901 --> 00:31:25.181]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[00:31:25.181 --> 00:31:28.622]  Make the change to only organic health and beauty products.

[00:32:00.712 --> 00:32:13.866]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:32:13.866 --> 00:32:20.634]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:32:20.974 --> 00:32:24.917]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:32:24.917 --> 00:32:28.339]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:32:28.339 --> 00:32:36.224]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:32:50.213 --> 00:32:50.814]  We're good to go.
[00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:05.273]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:33:05.273 --> 00:33:12.698]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:33:12.698 --> 00:33:14.319]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:33:14.319 --> 00:33:18.482]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:33:18.482 --> 00:33:22.325]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:33:22.325 --> 00:33:26.788]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:33:26.788 --> 00:33:30.230]  Phase One is a One World Currency, which we are currently being prepared
[00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.430]  We're good.
[00:34:03.217 --> 00:34:12.601]  My goal is to rally the people to be aware of the fact we're being conquered by offshore banks.
[00:34:12.601 --> 00:34:16.223]  My goal is to expose false flag terror
[00:34:34.844 --> 00:34:39.768]  And to lay myself on the line 110% for my family and humanity.
[00:34:39.768 --> 00:34:42.450]  Not because I'm a hero or because I have courage.
[00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:46.613]  Because I know history and I know that's what liberty and freedom takes.
[00:34:46.613 --> 00:34:51.337]  That's the price.
[00:34:51.337 --> 00:34:53.399]  And so it is an honor to be persecuted.
[00:34:53.399 --> 00:34:55.260]  It is an honor to be lied about.
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.384]  It is a great honor to be attacked because I know I'm doing my job.
[00:35:01.084 --> 00:35:17.026]  You know a lot of you have been involved in abortions and you know if you repent of it and admit to yourself you were part of a eugenics operation and admit that you killed a precious treasure that was going to be so amazing in your life, you can get that weight, that anvil off your chest.
[00:35:18.513 --> 00:35:23.296]  But even if you're going to be for abortion, you should at least be against partial birth abortion in the last trimester.
[00:35:23.296 --> 00:35:24.517]  These babies can be adopted.
[00:35:24.517 --> 00:35:35.043]  These women aren't educated by Planned Parenthood, set up by Margaret Sanger, with Rockefeller funding, the eugenicist who got awards from Hitler and gave awards to Hitler, admired Hitler.
[00:35:35.043 --> 00:35:39.966]  Most women don't know that there are charities that will pay more than $50,000, in many cases, for babies.
[00:35:43.018 --> 00:35:47.400]  And then every time I talk to a eugenicist liberal, they go, Oh, what about the black babies?
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.180]  Nobody wants them.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.300]  What about the brown babies?
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:49.940]  No, no, no.
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.701]  They want those babies too.
[00:35:52.701 --> 00:35:58.323]  People stand in line and wait years to get babies of any color.
[00:35:58.323 --> 00:35:59.824]  I know my family.
[00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:05.646]  I'm natural born to my parents, but my sister was adopted from South Korea.
[00:36:05.646 --> 00:36:05.926]  I know.
[00:36:07.338 --> 00:36:12.642]  And they don't tell the women that, that there's actually more people wanting to adopt every year than there are even abortions.
[00:36:12.642 --> 00:36:16.846]  They don't know that they can go have the baby and give it up for adoption.
[00:36:16.846 --> 00:36:18.948]  There's such a huge desire for them.
[00:36:18.948 --> 00:36:27.054]  The CPS is out kidnapping a lot of kids and then fencing them through the adoption agencies and the parents don't even know they're getting kidnapped kids that adopt.
[00:36:27.054 --> 00:36:31.798]  The non-biological parents.
[00:36:31.798 --> 00:36:34.420]  But they always say, oh no, nobody wants these brown babies.
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.161]  That's a lie.
[00:36:37.421 --> 00:36:41.985]  That's a fraud.
[00:36:41.985 --> 00:36:47.389]  And I tell you, I love children so much that down the road, my three aren't enough.
[00:36:47.389 --> 00:36:49.210]  I'm probably going to adopt.
[00:36:49.210 --> 00:37:01.100]  The only reason I may not is because it's very hard to make sure that you go with an adoption agency where it wasn't some child kidnapped.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.041]  I'll tell you right now that
[00:37:03.442 --> 00:37:14.190]  We make it through this martial law and can back this New World Order off that I do intend to adopt little brown babies.
[00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:27.419]  But the issue here is that we cover the horrible things that are done to babies after they're even born by the thousands every year, put in tanks of water, put in refrigerators to freeze to death, thrown in trash cans.
[00:37:27.419 --> 00:37:29.580]  And here was a case that finally got some attention.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.462]  Son Sentinel, out of Florida,
[00:37:32.782 --> 00:37:37.923]  Miami abortion clinic owner threw live baby away, prosecutors say.
[00:37:37.923 --> 00:37:39.623]  Well, yeah, they have witnesses and it's admitted.
[00:37:39.623 --> 00:37:44.704]  An abortion clinic owner is accused of delivering a live baby during a botched procedure and then throwing the infant away.
[00:37:44.704 --> 00:37:47.085]  We'll know if you read what really happened.
[00:37:47.085 --> 00:37:57.587]  The abortionist didn't show up, so the abortion clinic owner came in, threw the baby up against the wall, reportedly, from eyewitnesses, the nurses and the woman, and then went and threw it in a trash can and it died days later.
[00:37:59.269 --> 00:38:05.777]  Bellicus Gonzalez 42 was arrested Tuesday and charged with practicing medicine without a license and tampering with evidence.
[00:38:05.777 --> 00:38:12.364]  Both felonies said Ed Griffin, a spokesman from the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office.
[00:38:12.364 --> 00:38:19.913]  If found guilty, Gonzalez would face at least a year in prison and up to 15 years, the teenage mother.
[00:38:23.527 --> 00:38:35.314]  Miss Williams had filed a lawsuit alleging that Gonzalez knocked the infant off the chair when she gave birth and then scooped the baby up, placenta and afterbirth, in a red plastic biohazard bag and threw it out.
[00:38:35.314 --> 00:38:37.715]  The clinic's doctor, Dr. Paris Jean-Jacques
[00:38:39.187 --> 00:38:48.612]  Reniquel had been scheduled to perform the procedure, but Williams went into labor after being given drugs to dilate her cervix and waiting for hours for the abortionist to arrive.
[00:38:48.612 --> 00:38:57.878]  The suit said the doctor had said that he had been on his way to the clinic when he was called to treat another patient who was bleeding.
[00:38:57.878 --> 00:39:07.063]  Last month, the Board of Medicine revoked the doctor's license for committing medical malpractice, delegating responsibility to unlicensed personnel, and failing to keep an accurate medical record.
[00:39:09.639 --> 00:39:11.920]  And it goes on.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:17.703]  The baby lived for days and days and days in the trash outside.
[00:39:17.703 --> 00:39:20.965]  And I don't want to go into what happens to a baby when that is done.
[00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:23.611]  Now, a lot of people don't want to hear about that.
[00:39:23.611 --> 00:39:27.794]  You don't want to hear about the old people, your warehouse and nursing homes that die of bad sores.
[00:39:27.794 --> 00:39:30.635]  You don't want to hear about the children grabbed in the country.
[00:39:30.635 --> 00:39:37.280]  It's even been in the New York Daily News and other publications that don't just have drugs tested on them until they die, but they have pesticides tested on them.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:43.244]  You don't want to hear about how more than 90% of the infant formula has melamine in it, Source Associated Press.
[00:39:43.244 --> 00:39:48.107]  You don't want to hear about how there's mercury in half of the corn syrup products.
[00:39:48.567 --> 00:39:52.611]  You don't want to hear about how GMO food kills the rats and guinea pigs they feed it to.
[00:39:52.611 --> 00:39:55.814]  You don't want to hear about how cancer levels are exploding.
[00:39:55.814 --> 00:39:58.136]  You don't want to hear about how 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:39:58.136 --> 00:40:01.079]  You don't want to hear about 1,300,000 dead Iraqis.
[00:40:01.079 --> 00:40:05.103]  You don't want to hear about anything, and that's why tyranny is going to take over and hurt all of us.
[00:40:05.103 --> 00:40:12.550]  Because when you stop caring, and when you stop being involved, and when you stop at least saying no to evil and decrying it, it takes over and runs wild!
[00:40:21.598 --> 00:40:45.392]  And I tell you, this abortion issue, there are people that don't even want us to talk about how, in most partial birth abortions, because it's, by law, they've got to kill the baby still in the, still in the woman, in the birth canal.
[00:40:45.392 --> 00:40:49.474]  I mean, if you're going to be involved in this, don't you at least want to know what it is?
[00:40:49.474 --> 00:40:50.335]  No, you don't want to hear it.
[00:40:52.315 --> 00:41:17.375]  So they take the baby, and they claim it's a loophole if they hold the baby fully out of the woman, where it's been warm and safe, and they hold the baby's head, touching the woman's body, and they claim that's a loophole, and they jab a big hole in the back of its head, and they stick a high-powered suction vacuum cleaner, just like they use the dentist, in the back of its head, and they suck its poor little brains out.
[00:41:17.375 --> 00:41:19.997]  Now listen to me.
[00:41:19.997 --> 00:41:21.719]  That's pure evil, and I don't care
[00:41:25.117 --> 00:41:28.542]  What people say or think about me, I'm the sane person.
[00:41:28.542 --> 00:41:38.435]  It's insane to do that, and if you don't like hearing about that, and you're not going to stand up against that and say no to that, there's something fundamentally wrong with you.
[00:41:41.613 --> 00:41:47.575]  You know, they've done psychological studies and tests where if you see a dog being killed, everybody freaks out and cries and gets violent.
[00:41:47.575 --> 00:41:53.556]  But if you see humans dying, people don't care, because we've been conditioned to not care about our own species.
[00:41:53.556 --> 00:41:56.857]  We've lost our humanity.
[00:41:56.857 --> 00:42:06.840]  Whereas I love dogs and hate seeing a dog die, it's nothing compared to seeing a human die, because I haven't lost my humanity, and that's my most valuable possession.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.920]  That's who I am.
[00:42:13.939 --> 00:42:15.959]  This isn't, you know, I try to have fun on the show.
[00:42:15.959 --> 00:42:16.980]  I try to be positive.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:19.540]  I try to be happy.
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.981]  I try to fund our operation.
[00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:24.721]  I try to expand what we're doing.
[00:42:24.721 --> 00:42:26.722]  I know we're right about the information we cover.
[00:42:26.722 --> 00:42:28.162]  I understand how the world operates.
[00:42:28.162 --> 00:42:29.022]  I understand history.
[00:42:29.022 --> 00:42:30.083]  I've done my research.
[00:42:30.083 --> 00:42:33.603]  I've done my homework.
[00:42:33.603 --> 00:42:36.404]  And it tears my guts out.
[00:42:38.618 --> 00:42:50.092]  To know that we could just stand up and be good, decent people, and say no to evil, and learn to recognize evil, and learn to fight evil, and things would be so much better in society, and people would be so fulfilled.
[00:42:50.092 --> 00:42:51.914]  But people aren't fulfilled.
[00:42:51.914 --> 00:42:58.742]  On average, they're lazy, they're self-centered, they don't have a gauge for humanity or history, they don't have discernment.
[00:43:00.865 --> 00:43:08.970]  They don't even enjoy how beautiful God's nature is or how beautiful the stars are or how wondrous this one existence is.
[00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:13.973]  They don't understand how they are meant to change the world and be involved in the world and make the world a better place.
[00:43:13.973 --> 00:43:24.040]  They don't have any understanding of what it is to be alive and that is what's so sad is that so many people are going through life just programmed by the television set and they're not even alive.
[00:43:25.757 --> 00:43:27.798]  I don't hate Glenn Beck.
[00:43:27.798 --> 00:43:28.919]  I just know who he is.
[00:43:28.919 --> 00:43:29.579]  I know what he is.
[00:43:29.579 --> 00:43:30.239]  I can look at him.
[00:43:30.239 --> 00:43:30.940]  I can listen to him.
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:31.940]  He works for Fox News.
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.681]  He says, arrest Ron Paul supporters.
[00:43:34.681 --> 00:43:35.602]  Use the army against us.
[00:43:35.602 --> 00:43:39.944]  And now he flip-flops and says, yeah, I'm looking into the FEMA camps, but maybe they're needed.
[00:43:39.944 --> 00:43:46.507]  And then next he goes into how we've got to have war with Russia and Iran and how they're going to attack us and how they've got WMDs, the same old lies.
[00:43:46.507 --> 00:43:54.771]  And it's clear that they're just piggybacking Patriot information and then tying it into pro-New World Order information to try to co-opt the Liberty Movement that's awakening
[00:43:55.031 --> 00:44:02.274]  To support these wars and tyranny.
[00:44:02.274 --> 00:44:09.257]  And just because the New World Order is evil doesn't mean that Iran isn't evil and the leadership of Russia isn't corrupt and evil.
[00:44:09.257 --> 00:44:09.837]  Absolutely.
[00:44:09.837 --> 00:44:11.518]  But we're talking about who is the big power?
[00:44:11.518 --> 00:44:12.899]  Who is the mega power?
[00:44:12.899 --> 00:44:13.919]  It's the central banks.
[00:44:13.919 --> 00:44:22.863]  Who's imploding the economy by design and bragging about it and openly setting up a carbon tax to regulate every facet of our lives and announcing there'll be carbon taxes from Australia to the United States?
[00:44:25.032 --> 00:44:27.074]  On all newborn children.
[00:44:27.074 --> 00:44:28.275]  That's the one-child policy.
[00:44:28.275 --> 00:44:33.260]  That's how it started in China in 75, became law in 81.
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:39.185]  It's happening!
[00:44:39.185 --> 00:44:44.350]  And if we stand up and say no to this tyranny now, if we stand up and face the facts and the reality,
[00:44:46.127 --> 00:44:48.509]  And get the word out and warn people.
[00:44:48.509 --> 00:44:50.971]  There will be such a hue and cry and it's beginning to be raised.
[00:44:50.971 --> 00:44:52.153]  I see you doing it.
[00:44:52.153 --> 00:44:56.997]  We are literally moving the immovable object with God's help.
[00:44:56.997 --> 00:45:03.423]  If we commit and decide no matter what, we're doing it, it's going to happen.
[00:45:05.148 --> 00:45:11.611]  There are so many documented cases of, you know, a car on top of a child, and a mother will pick the car up.
[00:45:11.611 --> 00:45:17.673]  You see, the brain has a governor in it, just like an engine will have a governor, or a lawnmower, so you don't blow the engine.
[00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:32.059]  But when you go mind over matter, and you decide, well, they've done psychological tests at major universities where they've hypnotized a 150 pound man who can only bench press 200 pounds, and they can hypnotize him and they can bench press, you know, 700 pounds, 800 pounds.
[00:45:35.185 --> 00:45:37.228]  And again, that's just physical mind over matter.
[00:45:37.228 --> 00:45:44.620]  You can talk to the Olympic athletes and pro football folks that can jump over a whole defensive line.
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:48.346]  It's getting in the zone, ladies and gentlemen, and we've got to get in the zone for liberty.
[00:45:50.169 --> 00:45:53.511]  I am not concerned if they grab me, torture me, and kill me.
[00:45:53.511 --> 00:45:56.353]  I'm not concerned if they destroy my name and make stuff up about me.
[00:45:56.353 --> 00:45:57.213]  I'm not concerned.
[00:45:57.213 --> 00:45:59.254]  I'm even ready to be in solitary confinement.
[00:45:59.254 --> 00:46:03.817]  I'm ready for whatever it takes because I know that I am meant to be a good human.
[00:46:03.817 --> 00:46:04.958]  I am meant to fight evil.
[00:46:04.958 --> 00:46:10.001]  I am meant to give 110% for liberty and truth.
[00:46:10.001 --> 00:46:13.423]  And if you have the attitude and you're willing to lay down your life, you're going to be given your life.
[00:46:14.807 --> 00:46:20.989]  You know, that's not magic there in the Bible when Christ says, those that are ready to lay down their lives will gain their lives.
[00:46:20.989 --> 00:46:23.010]  Those that try to keep their lives will lose their lives.
[00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:29.513]  When you're all cowards, playing it safe, not getting outside the box, only watching your television set.
[00:46:29.513 --> 00:46:32.774]  You know, you may know about this stuff, but you're not out there involved because you're too scared.
[00:46:32.774 --> 00:46:40.937]  Because you wanted to save your life, you're probably going to lose your life, at least your financial future.
[00:46:40.937 --> 00:46:43.898]  But if you decide just to stand up,
[00:46:45.225 --> 00:46:47.787]  Not take it.
[00:46:47.787 --> 00:46:51.909]  Just the spiritual act of saying no to evil.
[00:46:51.909 --> 00:46:54.291]  The spiritual act of saying no to being a coward.
[00:46:54.291 --> 00:46:58.314]  The spiritual act of setting yourself on the right path of righteousness.
[00:46:58.314 --> 00:47:00.595]  And I don't mean the righteousness the phony preachers talk about.
[00:47:00.595 --> 00:47:01.776]  I mean real righteousness.
[00:47:01.776 --> 00:47:02.576]  Goodness.
[00:47:02.576 --> 00:47:03.737]  Loving good things.
[00:47:03.737 --> 00:47:04.598]  Loving honor.
[00:47:04.598 --> 00:47:05.558]  Loving truth.
[00:47:05.558 --> 00:47:06.599]  Loving beauty.
[00:47:06.599 --> 00:47:07.720]  Loving innocence.
[00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:19.112]  Loving true sacrifice, not counterfeit sacrifice for the New World Order.
[00:47:19.112 --> 00:47:24.694]  Just that act of flipping your mindset into gear, then you'll know what to do against the New World Order.
[00:47:24.694 --> 00:47:30.136]  Then you'll be empowered and you will burn with desire.
[00:47:30.136 --> 00:47:38.319]  You will feel literal life force pouring through your sinews, through your bones, through your guts, through your mind to a level you can't believe.
[00:47:38.319 --> 00:47:41.980]  And the only thing you won't be happy about is that you can't do enough
[00:47:43.018 --> 00:47:51.622]  And that you are worldly and that you still have the flesh side of you attached to you like an anchor, but that anchor will become smaller and smaller and smaller.
[00:47:51.622 --> 00:48:07.850]  And as you go through tribulation, and as you go through being slapped down and attacked and silenced and continue to persevere and continue to move forward with commitment, doors will open to you in the fight against tyranny.
[00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:09.611]  It is the law of the universe.
[00:48:12.469 --> 00:48:13.749]  The universe bends.
[00:48:13.749 --> 00:48:17.210]  I forget who said that, was it?
[00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:18.650]  I believe it was Einstein.
[00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:28.652]  The universe bends towards justice.
[00:48:28.652 --> 00:48:30.612]  But they taught you you were inadequate.
[00:48:30.612 --> 00:48:38.694]  First thing they do is they have Madison Avenue come out and teach men that they're not manly and that they're weak.
[00:48:38.694 --> 00:48:39.974]  Unless they do this, this, and that.
[00:48:40.885 --> 00:48:43.102]  They teach women they're not beautiful, they're not fulfilled.
[00:48:45.851 --> 00:49:05.957]  And then once you feel like you're not fulfilled, once you feel like you don't have power, once you feel like there's not a greater destiny in your life, then you buy into, well, if I just go along with the system's paradigm, you know, their overlay of the way the world works, and if I play ball and follow what the television set and the corporate media tells me is success, I'll be happy.
[00:49:05.957 --> 00:49:06.817]  And then you're not happy.
[00:49:06.817 --> 00:49:10.858]  You get more and more unhappy, so you go, well, I better just work harder to conform to this system.
[00:49:12.225 --> 00:49:22.193]  And this hierarchical system, like a bunch of parrots sitting in a tree, and you know, the king parrot sits the highest, or the way chimpanzees or other primates operate.
[00:49:22.193 --> 00:49:24.015]  We have to transcend that.
[00:49:24.015 --> 00:49:26.797]  You watch these globalists, they relish petty power.
[00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:29.219]  They relish the exercise of power.
[00:49:29.219 --> 00:49:31.641]  They relish abusing goodness.
[00:49:31.641 --> 00:49:34.864]  They relish abusing honor, because they are threatened by it.
[00:49:34.864 --> 00:49:35.864]  It is painful.
[00:49:35.864 --> 00:49:38.266]  It's like a screeching sound to them.
[00:49:41.095 --> 00:49:43.897]  Goodness is like a alarm going off.
[00:49:43.897 --> 00:49:45.238]  They just want to shut it up.
[00:49:45.238 --> 00:49:48.059]  It's like an alarm clock.
[00:49:48.059 --> 00:50:02.467]  Even if they've totally given their conscience over to evil and hardened their heart as black as the stinging of night, they still, as black as the dark gulfs of Hades, as the dark gulfs between the stars, between the galaxies, as the coldness of the night circle of hell,
[00:50:06.428 --> 00:50:09.932]  Even when they've lost their soul, they still don't like goodness.
[00:50:09.932 --> 00:50:12.114]  It's still a blinding light.
[00:50:12.114 --> 00:50:13.175]  They can't stand it.
[00:50:13.175 --> 00:50:14.236]  They don't like it.
[00:50:14.236 --> 00:50:15.557]  They want to silence it.
[00:50:15.557 --> 00:50:23.725]  And that's why every time a powerful demon of the New World Order gets in control of a country through Stalin or Hitler or Mao or others, they just start slaughtering everyone.
[00:50:26.365 --> 00:50:35.793]  In Lennon's directives to his NKVD, he would just say, more blood, kill more, kill more, and they'd say, we've killed all the leadership of the town, we've stolen everything, and just kill more!
[00:50:35.793 --> 00:50:38.074]  Kill children, more blood!
[00:50:38.074 --> 00:50:41.717]  These are on record directives.
[00:50:41.717 --> 00:50:51.866]  It's on record in mainline history books that Lennon, before he went in in 1916, 1917, and over through Russia in 1918, that he would go with his wife to a little island
[00:50:53.171 --> 00:50:56.972]  That had all these, you know, overpopulation of rabbits.
[00:50:56.972 --> 00:51:00.094]  And he would just run around grabbing them, strangling them, killing them, rolling around.
[00:51:00.094 --> 00:51:03.995]  I mean, these people are nuts!
[00:51:03.995 --> 00:51:07.256]  And I tell you, the abortionists love killing babies.
[00:51:07.256 --> 00:51:08.597]  And I talk about how they're on record.
[00:51:08.597 --> 00:51:09.257]  Just Google it.
[00:51:09.257 --> 00:51:10.077]  Look it up.
[00:51:10.077 --> 00:51:10.597]  People see me.
[00:51:10.597 --> 00:51:13.839]  Oh, they don't love doing it.
[00:51:13.839 --> 00:51:18.360]  They don't enjoy the power.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.981]  It's sick.
[00:51:19.981 --> 00:51:22.322]  It's a vortices into a hell-raiser
[00:51:24.645 --> 00:51:26.866]  Dimension.
[00:51:26.866 --> 00:51:34.511]  It's a vortices into darkness.
[00:51:34.511 --> 00:51:37.073]  Call it what you want.
[00:51:37.073 --> 00:51:39.154]  Of the event horizon.
[00:51:39.154 --> 00:51:41.196]  And the evil is now coming through.
[00:51:41.196 --> 00:51:44.498]  It's now pouring into the world.
[00:51:44.498 --> 00:51:49.601]  And I'm telling you right now, what we need in this time is for the Spirit of the Lord
[00:51:52.176 --> 00:51:57.183]  When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[00:51:57.183 --> 00:51:58.905]  Are you that standard?
[00:51:58.905 --> 00:51:59.827]  You know you are!
[00:51:59.827 --> 00:52:00.708]  Arise!
[00:52:00.708 --> 00:52:06.196]  What will you do when the economy collapses, store shelves are empty, and your stored food is gone?
[00:52:06.196 --> 00:52:07.838]  How will you feed your family?
[00:52:07.998 --> 00:52:08.478]  We're good to go.
[00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:32.229]  I think so.
[00:53:00.626 --> 00:53:07.389]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:53:07.389 --> 00:53:10.031]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:53:10.031 --> 00:53:11.592]  But who is the enemy?
[00:53:11.592 --> 00:53:12.392]  Bin Laden.
[00:53:12.392 --> 00:53:13.412]  This is his M.O.
[00:53:13.412 --> 00:53:14.753]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:53:14.753 --> 00:53:16.754]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:53:16.754 --> 00:53:23.898]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:53:23.898 --> 00:53:24.378]  Some U.S.
[00:53:24.378 --> 00:53:30.021]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:53:30.701 --> 00:53:34.224]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:53:34.224 --> 00:53:37.026]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:54:00.783 --> 00:54:04.225]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:54:04.225 --> 00:54:08.468]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:54:08.468 --> 00:54:16.433]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[00:54:16.713 --> 00:54:17.153]  We're good to go!
[00:54:46.636 --> 00:54:48.997]  Make no mistake, this life is a test.
[00:54:48.997 --> 00:54:52.019]  You are meant to stand in the midst of evil and resistance.
[00:55:18.453 --> 00:55:28.940]  You will not be fulfilled until you set your mind and soul in motion to fight evil, to defend the weak.
[00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:33.884]  I've seen trouble all my day.
[00:55:33.884 --> 00:55:46.853]  I bid farewell to old Kentucky, the place where I was born and raised.
[00:55:52.859 --> 00:55:56.442]  All right.
[00:55:56.442 --> 00:56:02.648]  In other news, the establishment is losing control of the Republican Party.
[00:56:02.648 --> 00:56:10.334]  Republicans are finding out there is a new world order, there is a world government, Limbaugh lied to them all those years, stalling us when we still had time to stop things.
[00:56:11.465 --> 00:56:13.466]  Before they came to fruition.
[00:56:13.466 --> 00:56:16.828]  We can still stop it, but it's going to be a much harder fight now.
[00:56:16.828 --> 00:56:22.571]  So they're billing him as the leader of the Republican Party, and Ron Paul has said that's a sad thing.
[00:56:22.571 --> 00:56:25.493]  You know, a discredited drug addict, and I don't even criticize him for that.
[00:56:25.493 --> 00:56:27.814]  People get hurt and they get addicted to opiates.
[00:56:27.814 --> 00:56:31.996]  The issue is he still says put drug users in prison and throw away the key.
[00:56:31.996 --> 00:56:35.178]  He's such a hypocrite.
[00:56:35.178 --> 00:56:38.900]  And it's now come out in Democratic memos, the Politico website is reporting.
[00:56:40.267 --> 00:56:45.691]  Top Democrats believe they have struck political gold by depicting Rush Limbaugh as the new face of the Republican Party.
[00:56:45.691 --> 00:56:52.076]  A full-scale effort hatched by some of the most familiar names in politics and now being guided as part of an inside White House operation.
[00:56:52.076 --> 00:57:05.045]  Now, I said this months ago, Obama can't run, and he's acting like he's still running, his agenda, in the name of being anti-establishment because he's continuing everything Bush did and expanding much of it.
[00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:13.579]  And so they're going to use the ridiculous fake conservative caricatures who are attacking Obama.
[00:57:13.579 --> 00:57:21.982]  See, when you attack Obama from a fake right-wing position, it only politically strengthens him.
[00:57:21.982 --> 00:57:26.244]  And that's what Limbaugh's job is.
[00:57:26.244 --> 00:57:32.866]  That's why Bill Clinton's been saying nice things about him, and they talk about how they hung out at dinner one time at a steakhouse.
[00:57:32.866 --> 00:57:35.267]  It's just disgusting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:38.362 --> 00:57:41.484]  And I'm just looking at Limbaugh.
[00:57:41.484 --> 00:57:54.153]  I mean, he's so thoroughly discredited all those years saying the Council on Foreign Relations didn't exist, the New World Order didn't exist, and then, okay, the CFR exists, but they don't run anything, and then now, okay, there's a world government with a world carbon tax being set up, but the liberals run it.
[00:57:54.153 --> 00:58:00.158]  When all Bush did was prepare it, Bush set the table, now Obama's sitting down to eat it with the bankers.
[00:58:03.834 --> 00:58:19.769]  And that's why the Obama deception that's on sale now at Infowars.com is so important, because it is all about smashing the left-right paradigm, showing how both parties are controlled, and the way it goes after Obama is the truth, and so it's the only effective way to shoot down their agenda.
[00:58:22.386 --> 00:58:24.646]  So I want to invite you to pre-order the Obama Deception now.
[00:58:24.646 --> 00:58:27.387]  It's going to be shipping now in 11 days.
[00:58:27.387 --> 00:58:30.148]  Well, really technically 10 because it goes out on the 15th.

[00:59:12.762 --> 00:59:21.168]  Because even though we knew this was all coming, we knew we were right about it because it was the Globalist's own documents, it still is bracing.
[00:59:21.168 --> 00:59:21.848]  It's not fear.
[00:59:21.848 --> 00:59:22.949]  It's like jumping into cold water.
[00:59:22.949 --> 00:59:24.990]  It's bracing.
[00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:28.853]  It makes you so awake, so alive.
[00:59:28.853 --> 00:59:38.619]  It does shake you to your foundations, but every time you shake your foundations, you only become stronger as you face the true horror of the New World Order and battle it.

[00:59:50.566 --> 00:59:51.207]  Hello, friends.
[00:59:51.207 --> 00:59:52.267]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:59:52.267 --> 00:59:57.011]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:59:57.011 --> 00:59:59.973]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:59.973 --> 01:00:03.015]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:00:03.015 --> 01:00:07.738]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:00:07.958 --> 01:00:09.078]  If you simply prepare.
[01:00:09.078 --> 01:00:12.320]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:19.323]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:00:53.365 --> 01:00:55.766]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:55.766 --> 01:01:05.171]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:01:05.171 --> 01:01:06.492]  Big Brother.
[01:01:06.492 --> 01:01:08.253]  Mainstream media.
[01:01:08.253 --> 01:01:10.014]  Government cover-ups.
[01:01:10.014 --> 01:01:11.595]  You want answers?
[01:01:11.595 --> 01:01:13.155]  Well, so does he.
[01:01:13.155 --> 01:01:17.338]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:01:17.338 --> 01:01:21.400]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:01:27.044 --> 01:01:28.650]  It is Wednesday, the fourth day.
[01:01:29.975 --> 01:01:32.936]  of March 2009 for the next 30 minutes.
[01:01:32.936 --> 01:01:56.024]  I'm going to break down the reality of the military-industrial complex takeover, the FEMA camps, the open announcement of world government being set up by the banks that you'll pay carbon taxes to, and how people like Glenn Beck are countering this after denying it all these years, and how they're attempting to co-opt the Patriot Liberty Movement, and how every time he talks about FEMA camps, he then talks about the threat of Russia and Iran.
[01:01:56.024 --> 01:01:58.825]  He creates the fear of FEMA camps, then psychologically flips it
[01:01:59.585 --> 01:01:59.985]  I think so.
[01:02:18.973 --> 01:02:22.756]  And the reason I'm getting into this is because this is a psy-op by Fox News.
[01:02:22.756 --> 01:02:25.677]  This is Fox News, the big purveyors of propaganda.
[01:02:25.677 --> 01:02:27.278]  They're there to neutralize conservatives.
[01:02:27.278 --> 01:02:31.101]  You know, Limbaugh's been discredited for decades saying no New World Order existed.
[01:02:31.101 --> 01:02:33.463]  Now it's all over the news as the savior.
[01:02:33.463 --> 01:02:35.244]  It's exactly as we said the New World Order would be.
[01:02:35.244 --> 01:02:42.168]  A World Bank, Bank of the World, Time Magazine, Newsweek, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times of London, all saying it's good.
[01:02:42.168 --> 01:02:45.651]  North American Union's good and the Wall Street Journal now owned by News Corp and Fox News.
[01:02:47.391 --> 01:02:50.133]  Okay, we're in a depression, the answer is world government.
[01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:52.594]  And then they have him over there playing the part of Welton.
[01:02:52.594 --> 01:02:56.816]  I don't know if this is a good idea, but I'm worried about the bubble factor in their guns.
[01:02:56.816 --> 01:02:57.296]  What do we do?
[01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:15.198]  That's the same way that Tommy Franks, four years ago, would go on Fox and say, and other channels, and say, you know, I'm real sad about this, but it's what the people are going to demand for security, that the next time we're hit by terrorists, we're going to have to have martial law and a military form of government in America.
[01:03:15.198 --> 01:03:18.640]  Gee, I'm sorry that's going to happen, but that's all that'll keep us safe.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:21.281]  You don't expect to come out and say martial law's good, military occupation's good.
[01:03:21.281 --> 01:03:25.724]  He says, gee, I'm sorry, it's not really our form of government, but it's all that'll keep you safe.
[01:03:26.684 --> 01:03:28.285]  You know, martial law is what will keep you safe.
[01:03:28.285 --> 01:03:29.266]  It's what the people want.
[01:03:29.266 --> 01:03:31.828]  When it's not what the people want, martial law won't keep you safe.
[01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:47.441]  That's how they proposed it, and I said on air, we knew the Pentagon was spending tens of billions to buy reporters, to have fake news, not just Armstrong Williams to push, you know, No Child Left Behind, $240-something thousand a year to go out secretly and secretly being funded to push that.
[01:03:47.441 --> 01:04:02.012]  It was thousands of reporters, and I said, I guarantee you, Frank's is all over TV, he's getting money from the Pentagon slush fund to go say this, and then it came out in mainstream news that he was paid over $500,000 that year alone to go out and read that talking point
[01:04:02.472 --> 01:04:08.276]  On the news, introducing that martial law keeps you safe, we've got to get rid of our form of government.
[01:04:08.276 --> 01:04:20.005]  Now the White House memos, I'm going through the evidence now, the John Yoo memos have been released and it says we're going to ban free speech, we're going to basically make Bush a dictator, this is mainstream headlines.
[01:04:20.005 --> 01:04:24.088]  He went on to say, here's the headline, terror memos reveal total destruction of U.S.
[01:04:24.088 --> 01:04:25.849]  constitutional freedoms.
[01:04:25.849 --> 01:04:29.312]  He goes on to say that under PDD 51, just the cover sheet,
[01:04:30.232 --> 01:04:35.696]  It states that the President is a dictator under any emergency, including economic, that the Congress can't review it.
[01:04:35.696 --> 01:04:43.642]  When Congress and the highest level committee on security, Homeland Security, asked to see the full document, they were told no national security.
[01:04:43.642 --> 01:04:56.912]  Now we have the John U. memos, where they say the President is above all branches of government, when supposedly legislative, executive, judicial, or co-equal founders said that really the legislative was above the courts and the executive, the President.
[01:04:57.856 --> 01:05:00.398]  So all of that is going on, all of that is admitted.
[01:05:00.398 --> 01:05:03.761]  I've got scores of video clips here.
[01:05:03.761 --> 01:05:17.493]  One of them is titled, 26,000 Pastors for Martial Law, Continuity of Government, and then it goes in Representative Peter Defazio on the Homeland Security Committee talking about how they were told they're not allowed to read it.
[01:05:17.493 --> 01:05:20.056]  They're co-equal with the President, but they can't see it.
[01:05:21.943 --> 01:05:24.684]  And then we have other newscasts.
[01:05:24.684 --> 01:05:29.206]  Years after we told you about the Clergy Response Teams, how they had secretly hired 26,000 preachers.
[01:05:29.206 --> 01:05:38.230]  We got the secret FEMA documents to tell their flock to take implantable injections, go to FEMA camps, have their families broken up.
[01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:40.931]  People who couldn't believe it, now it's mainstream news.
[01:05:40.931 --> 01:05:47.173]  InfraGard, now 50,000 executives who shoot to kill orders, who have been secretly FBI deputized.
[01:05:47.173 --> 01:05:48.234]  We're going to go over all of that.
[01:05:49.266 --> 01:05:50.528]  And a lot more coming up.
[01:05:50.528 --> 01:05:53.232]  You know, Glenn Beck says he doesn't know if the camps are real.
[01:05:53.232 --> 01:05:57.999]  We'll have to be hiding, you know, under his bed not to know that.
[01:05:57.999 --> 01:05:59.781]  So we'll come back and go over all this.
[01:06:01.576 --> 01:06:05.399]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[01:06:05.399 --> 01:06:12.464]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:06:12.464 --> 01:06:13.945]  Here is why.
[01:06:13.945 --> 01:06:23.892]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[01:06:24.392 --> 01:06:27.133]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[01:06:27.133 --> 01:06:29.254]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[01:06:29.254 --> 01:06:30.235]  this fall?
[01:06:30.235 --> 01:06:31.155]  Don't wait.

[01:06:57.572 --> 01:07:00.034]  Act now!
[01:07:00.034 --> 01:07:07.739]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:07:07.739 --> 01:07:09.401]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:11.920]  But who is the enemy?
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.721]  Bin Laden.
[01:07:12.721 --> 01:07:13.702]  This is his M.O.s.
[01:07:13.702 --> 01:07:15.083]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:17.084]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:07:17.084 --> 01:07:24.229]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:07:24.229 --> 01:07:24.710]  Some U.S.
[01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:30.394]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:07:31.054 --> 01:07:34.517]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.699]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:08:00.925 --> 01:08:04.006]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:08:04.006 --> 01:08:09.529]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:15.251]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:08:15.251 --> 01:08:16.732]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:08:16.732 --> 01:08:25.756]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:08:25.776 --> 01:08:26.036]  Yes.
[01:08:26.036 --> 01:08:27.879]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:08:27.879 --> 01:08:32.104]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:08:56.481 --> 01:09:01.764]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:09:01.764 --> 01:09:07.366]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:09:10.687 --> 01:09:12.628]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:12.628 --> 01:09:17.469]  I'm going to go over the evidence of FEMA camps and tell you exactly how they operate here right now.
[01:09:17.469 --> 01:09:24.371]  Then I'm going to get into how the media, the corporate media, now that this can't be denied anymore, is trying to spin it.
[01:09:24.371 --> 01:09:31.733]  First off, Exhibit A. Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:36.542]  This is directly from the Army's own website.
[01:09:36.542 --> 01:09:37.363]  It's the top link.
[01:09:37.363 --> 01:09:44.747]  If you Google, Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, you will be on the Army's own website.
[01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:47.069]  In 2002, I published my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:09:47.069 --> 01:09:53.773]  I've been covering it since 97, when it was declassified, but I put it in my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:09:53.773 --> 01:10:01.938]  The only other media outlet that I have seen that ever covered this was Dr. Jerome Corsi,
[01:10:03.061 --> 01:10:05.043]  Civilian prisons coming soon to the U.S.
[01:10:05.043 --> 01:10:05.964]  Army base near you.
[01:10:05.964 --> 01:10:10.427]  Little notice regulation allows construction of military installations to hold civilian U.S.
[01:10:10.427 --> 01:10:11.548]  citizens on them.
[01:10:11.548 --> 01:10:14.811]  Well, they've been in the camps since 86.
[01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:16.713]  It was not declassified until 1997.
[01:10:20.572 --> 01:10:26.414]  The regulation revises an earlier civilian inmate labor camp signed December 9th, 1997 under the Clinton administration.
[01:10:26.414 --> 01:10:28.114]  That's when they declassified it.
[01:10:28.114 --> 01:10:32.676]  So, here is WorldNet Daily on that front.
[01:10:32.676 --> 01:10:36.657]  So, it is Army Regulation 210-35.
[01:10:36.657 --> 01:10:37.097]  Army Regulation 210-35.
[01:10:37.097 --> 01:10:37.338]  Now, in
[01:10:46.945 --> 01:10:54.770]  1986, under Rex 84, they opened 12 secret army camps to test if they could keep them secret while they held federal.
[01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:56.651]  Now they hold state prisoners as well.
[01:10:56.651 --> 01:11:03.695]  Federal prisoners would then be given a few years off, their sentence if they agreed to not tell family about it, and to go to the labor camps.
[01:11:03.695 --> 01:11:08.498]  It is a labor camp, and under the revised military rules, it allows any U.S.
[01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:11.300]  citizens to be put in it under forced labor.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.142]  Now, this is only about
[01:11:17.466 --> 01:11:19.667]  It's exactly 30 pages long.
[01:11:19.667 --> 01:11:26.289]  I suggest you Google, even if you're listening on AM and FM shortwave satellite right now, just write notes.
[01:11:26.289 --> 01:11:29.590]  Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, even if you don't have a computer, go to the library.
[01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:30.670]  This is important.
[01:11:30.670 --> 01:11:32.351]  Write notes.
[01:11:32.351 --> 01:11:37.352]  Go check all of this out for yourself, okay?
[01:11:37.352 --> 01:11:42.914]  Now, that dovetails with the Houston Chronicle and other publications that reported
[01:11:44.597 --> 01:11:55.585]  First in January 7th in the Houston Chronicle 2006, that emergency FEMA camps were being built by a division of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown and Root.
[01:11:55.585 --> 01:11:57.046]  Write that note, Google it.
[01:11:57.046 --> 01:12:01.469]  Because Beck says he's been doing months of research and they've been having trouble finding him.
[01:12:01.469 --> 01:12:09.355]  He's doing research, but he can't ever bring any facts, and he makes little jokes about, ooh, the government's going to get me, or, oh, I'm being censored on Fox and calls us conspiracy theorists.
[01:12:09.355 --> 01:12:13.958]  Okay, well here it is, Beck, and I know listeners for years have been sending you all this, so don't act like you don't know.
[01:12:15.615 --> 01:12:18.618]  Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[01:12:18.618 --> 01:12:21.920]  Now that dovetails with the new legislation introduced.
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.684]  The camps are already built, kind of like they already had the warrantless wiretapping for years.
[01:12:26.684 --> 01:12:29.207]  And when they got caught, they retroactively went and legalized it.
[01:12:30.017 --> 01:12:42.705]  The bill at these threat fusion centers, FEMA emergency centers in every county and city in the country, they're moving the National Guard in, paying for free space for the police, fire department, emergency management, under federal control.
[01:12:42.705 --> 01:12:47.429]  It says they're going to have the clergy response teams and community there to help the public as they go into the camp.
[01:12:47.429 --> 01:12:49.730]  Obama's going to build medical centers on these.
[01:12:49.730 --> 01:12:51.691]  They're going to advertise, it's fun to go to the camp.
[01:12:51.691 --> 01:12:55.774]  Like Germany, they didn't say we're taking you to a slave camp, a forced labor camp, and then a death camp.
[01:12:55.774 --> 01:12:59.877]  It was, oh, it's a place because you lost your homes, and you know, it's a refugee
[01:12:59.957 --> 01:13:01.840]  We're good to go.
[01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:16.912]  National Emergency Centers Act, H.R.
[01:13:16.912 --> 01:13:17.952]  645.
[01:13:17.952 --> 01:13:20.373]  New legislation authorizes FEMA camps in the U.S.
[01:13:20.373 --> 01:13:21.153]  Okay?
[01:13:21.153 --> 01:13:22.274]  There's the bill number.
[01:13:22.274 --> 01:13:22.734]  Gave it to you.
[01:13:22.734 --> 01:13:23.514]  In fact, we have this.
[01:13:23.514 --> 01:13:26.035]  Can we throw that up on screen for folks?
[01:13:26.035 --> 01:13:27.315]  And I'll give you over 100 articles.
[01:13:27.315 --> 01:13:30.076]  But, uh, new legislation authorizes FEMA camps in the U.S.
[01:13:30.076 --> 01:13:30.656]  There you go.
[01:13:30.656 --> 01:13:31.657]  That integrates with this.
[01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:34.238]  Now, they doubled these from 12 camps that are listed.
[01:13:34.238 --> 01:13:37.159]  You can go to them with people on them.
[01:13:37.159 --> 01:13:39.860]  People on YouTube have gone and shot to the wire and showed prisoners at them.
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:42.380]  And we've shot video of children being held in them.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:43.401]  It's in, uh, in-game.
[01:13:44.266 --> 01:13:54.173]  You can go, uh, these are the 24 big ones, first 12, kept secret for 11 years, from 86 to 97, was declassified in 97, and now it's been radically expanded in 2005.
[01:13:54.173 --> 01:13:55.714]  Okay?
[01:13:55.714 --> 01:13:56.995]  There you have it right there.
[01:13:56.995 --> 01:13:59.417]  Absolute, total, complete proof.
[01:13:59.417 --> 01:14:02.099]  People working in them right now.
[01:14:02.099 --> 01:14:05.922]  Then we had the governor four years ago in Rhode Island.
[01:14:05.922 --> 01:14:07.023]  It was in the local news.
[01:14:08.464 --> 01:14:17.832]  In the Providence Journal and the local NBC affiliate, they said if you criticize the government, download music, this was in the bill, hundreds of other things, life in prison as under treason.
[01:14:17.832 --> 01:14:29.342]  There was another bill almost passed in Oregon under Senator Menace, you can Google that, Senator Menace, FEMA camp bill, and they said downloading music, protesting, life in prison in a forest labor camp.
[01:14:34.264 --> 01:14:37.905]  I mean, this is just off the charts, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:37.905 --> 01:14:42.966]  And when the Governor and others got confronted with this in Rhode Island, they said, well, the Feds told us to pass this.
[01:14:42.966 --> 01:14:48.228]  So, I just gave you the sources on that for everybody else that's out there.
[01:14:48.228 --> 01:14:53.209]  We told you Obama was going to set up a million-person domestic spy force, because he announced they would.
[01:14:53.209 --> 01:14:55.330]  The Pentagon had written this up decades ago.
[01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:56.150]  Clinton had pushed it.
[01:14:56.150 --> 01:14:59.471]  Bush had pushed it under divisions of AmeriCorps called Secure Corps.
[01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:10.559]  There were Philadelphia Daily News articles about how they were training 15-year-olds with M-16s in the public schools for warrant apprehension during martial law.
[01:15:10.559 --> 01:15:12.160]  That's one source on that.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.043]  Defense Department announces civilian expeditionary workforce.
[01:15:16.043 --> 01:15:21.807]  This is a Steve Watson, Infowars.net story, but it's all linked to the bills and mainstream news.
[01:15:21.807 --> 01:15:24.949]  Defense Department Directive 1404.10.
[01:15:24.949 --> 01:15:25.830]  Again, write this down.
[01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:26.911]  Defense Department Directive 1404.10.
[01:15:31.064 --> 01:15:48.415]  And this is to establish a giant civilian military, as big as the military, a million person, and it says that you will be deployed under draft, it says that it's compulsory, domestically and internationally overseas, so dual use.
[01:15:48.415 --> 01:15:55.579]  Defense Department announces civilian expeditionary workforce, and then we have links throughout the article to the Department of Defense announcements.
[01:15:55.579 --> 01:15:57.120]  Outside of Congress, they've just done this.
[01:15:58.632 --> 01:16:00.213]  Here's the Washington Post.
[01:16:00.213 --> 01:16:03.296]  Pentagon to detail troops to bolster domestic security.
[01:16:03.296 --> 01:16:06.919]  Military expects to have 20,000 uniformed troops on the streets of the United States.
[01:16:06.919 --> 01:16:15.326]  Also in the Army Times, they announced that for PR purposes, they would have military, Army, and Marines running checkpoints for DUIs.
[01:16:15.326 --> 01:16:16.547]  You're not for drunks, are you?
[01:16:16.547 --> 01:16:19.069]  This is how they condition you to accept it.
[01:16:19.069 --> 01:16:25.174]  That they would also have them with the jaws of life, and it showed it on the Army own website, them helping cut people out of cars.
[01:16:26.428 --> 01:16:32.190]  Well, you're not against the military fighting forest fires, cutting people out of cars, doing drug interdiction, doing anti-terror.
[01:16:32.190 --> 01:16:34.251]  See, that's just the cover story.
[01:16:34.251 --> 01:16:38.893]  Now the Army War College admits, it's been all over the news, they're preparing to quote, engage the American people.
[01:16:40.117 --> 01:16:43.159]  And that their new mission under NORTHCOM is suppressing the American people.
[01:16:43.159 --> 01:16:45.721]  They're teaching police that there's new white Al-Qaeda.
[01:16:45.721 --> 01:16:47.622]  And that Americans are about to rebel nationwide.
[01:16:47.622 --> 01:16:48.943]  That's mainstream news.
[01:16:48.943 --> 01:16:51.045]  That they're preparing to crush the American people.
[01:16:51.045 --> 01:16:52.986]  Pentagon to detail troops.
[01:16:52.986 --> 01:16:53.847]  Zoom in on this camera.
[01:16:53.847 --> 01:16:55.688]  I'll use this as a close shot.
[01:16:55.688 --> 01:16:59.631]  Some of these articles you don't have on the computer in there.
[01:16:59.631 --> 01:17:05.975]  Pentagon to detail troops to bolster domestic security.
[01:17:05.975 --> 01:17:07.857]  I'll remind you the Gonzales memos and
[01:17:10.618 --> 01:17:17.860]  You memos just got released where they said they were going to ban free speech in the United States, use troops on the streets of America, and set up a dictatorship.
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:22.001]  And that's being continued by Obama.
[01:17:22.001 --> 01:17:23.081]  Here's the Sydney Morning Herald.
[01:17:23.081 --> 01:17:31.083]  Foundations are in place for martial law in the United States.
[01:17:31.083 --> 01:17:38.425]  British News is announcing that their government is preparing for martial law with the police and military against the British people.
[01:17:39.881 --> 01:17:42.903]  Sarkozy warns of social unrest because they've engineered it.
[01:17:42.903 --> 01:17:54.148]  In the IMF World Bank documents, released in December 2001, made widely public by the BBC in 2002, as Google IMF World Bank documents leaked, it said they institute riots.
[01:17:54.148 --> 01:17:58.431]  First they collapse society, then there's rioting, then that's their excuse to bring in martial law.
[01:17:58.431 --> 01:18:03.693]  Then they basically repossess everything.
[01:18:03.693 --> 01:18:04.654]  And I could just go on
[01:18:05.993 --> 01:18:08.335]  And on, and on, there's another story.
[01:18:08.335 --> 01:18:08.515]  U.S.
[01:18:08.515 --> 01:18:10.697]  troops asked if they would shoot at American citizens.
[01:18:10.697 --> 01:18:12.518]  Those are all public surveys that are being given.
[01:18:12.518 --> 01:18:21.485]  They're doing urban warfare drills for gun confiscation all over the country, and admitting they're going door-to-door, asking if they can search people's homes as part of a drill, and blocking off the streets.
[01:18:21.485 --> 01:18:32.733]  Towns in Arkansas, Oklahoma, all over the country, this has been on CNN, and they say it like it's a good thing, when they report it, are locking down the cities, even during the daylight hours, searching everybody's cars, making you go through checkpoints.
[01:18:32.733 --> 01:18:33.594]  You can Google that.
[01:18:33.594 --> 01:18:34.714]  Towns declare martial law.
[01:18:35.495 --> 01:18:38.536]  And they've been advising that by the Feds.
[01:18:38.536 --> 01:18:43.739]  All of that is happening.
[01:18:43.739 --> 01:18:46.440]  But let's go back to the root of this.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:53.063]  Let's go back to when they first set up this plan, and they said they would use riots and the Collapsed Society as the cover for that, and that came out.
[01:18:53.063 --> 01:18:53.744]  That's just the cover.
[01:18:54.807 --> 01:19:03.091]  With Oliver North in testimony before a joint session, a joint committee of Congress, with Congressman Jack Brooks bringing it up and being told to shut up.
[01:19:03.091 --> 01:19:04.952]  You ready with that clip, guys?
[01:19:04.952 --> 01:19:09.014]  Okay, here is that clip for folks.
[01:19:09.014 --> 01:19:19.859]  Colonel North, in your work at the NSC, were you not assigned at one time to work on plans for the continuity of government in the event of a major disaster?
[01:19:19.859 --> 01:19:20.619]  Mr. Chairman,
[01:19:24.131 --> 01:19:35.995]  I believe that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area, so may I request that you not touch upon that, sir?
[01:19:35.995 --> 01:19:52.562]  I was particularly concerned, Mr. Chairman, because I read in Miami Papers and several others that there had been a plan developed by that same agency, a contingency plan,
[01:19:53.766 --> 01:20:03.070]  In the event of an emergency that would suspend the American Constitution, and I was deeply concerned about it, and wondered if that was the area in which he had worked.
[01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:10.813]  May I most respectfully request that that matter not be touched upon at this stage.
[01:20:10.813 --> 01:20:16.635]  If we wish to get into this on certain arrangements can be made for an executive session.
[01:20:16.635 --> 01:20:22.237]  And tragically, the only member who got close was Jack Brooks, and he was stopped by the chairman.
[01:20:24.079 --> 01:20:30.224]  And you can go watch Henry B. Gonzalez saying the government was going to use staged attacks, staged crises to bring in martial law.
[01:20:30.224 --> 01:20:31.425]  It got exposed.
[01:20:31.425 --> 01:20:32.886]  It was stopped.
[01:20:32.886 --> 01:20:37.470]  Every time we stop them from doing this, and they go, oh look, it didn't exist, because we stopped it.
[01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:38.491]  You stopped it.
[01:20:38.491 --> 01:20:42.834]  Now I'm going to come back, and I'm going to get into Glenn Beck saying none of this exists.
[01:20:42.834 --> 01:20:49.419]  And I have clip after clip after clip of Congress now, Congress threatened with martial law if they didn't pass the Banker Takeover Bill.
[01:20:50.524 --> 01:20:53.705]  Now 9.7 trillion stolen according to AP and Bloomberg.
[01:20:53.705 --> 01:20:55.726]  This is a banking hijacking.
[01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:57.647]  We have their own blueprints for it.
[01:20:57.647 --> 01:20:58.107]  Okay?
[01:20:58.107 --> 01:21:00.589]  This is the facts.
[01:21:00.589 --> 01:21:08.832]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[01:21:08.832 --> 01:21:13.394]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[01:21:13.394 --> 01:21:18.056]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[01:21:18.056 --> 01:21:19.457]  It's a documented fact.
[01:21:19.677 --> 01:21:27.101]  Almost 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[01:21:27.101 --> 01:21:39.208]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.

[01:23:05.233 --> 01:23:05.733]  That's 949.36, 273.18, and 236.59.
[01:23:17.867 --> 01:23:30.391]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:23:30.391 --> 01:23:33.572]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:23:33.572 --> 01:23:36.913]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:23:36.913 --> 01:23:39.754]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[01:23:40.014 --> 01:23:42.816]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.

[01:25:31.351 --> 01:25:32.899]  Okay.
[01:25:32.899 --> 01:25:33.080]  So...
[01:25:35.982 --> 01:26:03.805]  If Glenn Beck wants to know if the FEMA camps are real or not, all he has to do is go to the Army War College, the army.mil website, the Army Times, and they say, and it's been all over the Phoenix newspapers, the police say they're ready to work with the military against the people, that their new mission is fighting the American people physically, that they're acclimating us by having troops on the streets through PR, at the checkpoints for DUIs, against citizens, violating posse comitatus, helping people get out of car wrecks, it's all PR.
[01:26:04.205 --> 01:26:06.946]  And to condition the troops and police that it's okay.
[01:26:06.946 --> 01:26:14.929]  And more evidence, other exhibits, are Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, all free on the web.
[01:26:14.929 --> 01:26:18.091]  Films I made in the late 90s.
[01:26:18.091 --> 01:26:24.113]  And I went to urban warfare drills where the Marines and Army would hire role players who would scream, I'm an American, please no, not the camp.
[01:26:24.113 --> 01:26:26.934]  They would do mock executions of American citizens.
[01:26:26.934 --> 01:26:31.776]  The Marines let us videotape mock interrogations of supposed US citizens.
[01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:35.051]  They would set them down and say, where are you from?
[01:26:35.051 --> 01:26:35.852]  I'm from San Francisco.
[01:26:35.852 --> 01:26:36.573]  Where'd you get the helmet?
[01:26:36.573 --> 01:26:38.055]  Where'd you get the weapons?
[01:26:38.055 --> 01:26:45.524]  So, this is why I've been raising the alarm, because they have been gearing up for this and telling the locals it was for training overseas.
[01:26:45.524 --> 01:26:47.968]  And they do this over and over and over and over again.
[01:26:49.494 --> 01:26:54.759]  And for folks watching the simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv, we're showing video of the Marines.
[01:26:54.759 --> 01:26:56.920]  We're going to show you a mock FEMA camp.
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:00.103]  They also had foreign troops there assisting.
[01:27:00.103 --> 01:27:05.368]  We have video of a cooperative nugget in the mid-1990s where foreign troops admittedly were training in the U.S.
[01:27:05.368 --> 01:27:08.250]  to put Americans in camps.
[01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:10.152]  That is the camp right there you see on your screen.
[01:27:13.092 --> 01:27:15.495]  So it's all there for anybody that wants to know the truth.
[01:27:15.495 --> 01:27:27.368]  Now remember, under PDD 51, signed a few years ago by Bush that Obama's expanded and continued, they state that Congress has no authority during emergencies and the President's basically an absolute dictator.
[01:27:27.368 --> 01:27:29.751]  When Congress wanted to see the detailed documents,
[01:27:31.533 --> 01:27:35.295]  They were told you're not allowed to international security when Congress is co-equal to the President.
[01:27:35.295 --> 01:27:36.636]  That is dictatorship.
[01:27:36.636 --> 01:27:38.117]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[01:27:38.117 --> 01:27:40.658]  26,000 pastors for martial law, continuity of government.
[01:27:40.658 --> 01:27:42.860]  Because the first half of the clip is a newscast on that.
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:43.740]  We're not going to play that later.
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:47.663]  We're going to play right now, Representative Peter Defazio, Democrat, Oregon.
[01:27:47.663 --> 01:27:50.804]  And then later, the Chairman himself asked for the documents, was told no.
[01:27:50.804 --> 01:27:54.547]  So the Congress can't be trusted to be part of this with the foreign troops.
[01:27:54.547 --> 01:27:56.148]  They can know all about PDD 51.
[01:27:56.148 --> 01:27:57.108]  Here it is.
[01:27:57.108 --> 01:27:59.950]  Back about this time for what purpose of the gentleman from Oregon, right?
[01:28:06.355 --> 01:28:09.217]  Most Americans would agree that it would be prudent
[01:28:10.382 --> 01:28:18.370]  To have a plan to provide for the continuity of government and the rule of law in case of a devastating terrorist attack or natural disaster.
[01:28:18.370 --> 01:28:25.196]  A plan to provide for the cooperation, the coordination and continued functioning of all three branches of the government.
[01:28:25.196 --> 01:28:29.060]  The Bush administration tells us they have such a plan.
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:33.164]  They introduced a little sketchy public version that's clearly inadequate.
[01:28:33.784 --> 01:28:37.385]  Uh, and doesn't really tell us what they have in mind.
[01:28:37.385 --> 01:28:41.026]  But they said, don't worry, there's a detailed, classified version.
[01:28:41.026 --> 01:28:54.311]  But now, they've denied the entire Homeland Security Committee of the United States House of Representatives access to their so-called detailed plan to provide for continuity of government.
[01:28:54.311 --> 01:28:55.711]  They say, trust us.
[01:28:55.711 --> 01:28:56.811]  Trust us?
[01:28:56.811 --> 01:28:58.392]  The people who brought us Katrina?
[01:28:58.972 --> 01:29:01.536]  To be competent in face of a disaster?
[01:29:01.536 --> 01:29:02.657]  Trust us!
[01:29:02.657 --> 01:29:09.226]  The people who brought us warrantless wiretapping and other excesses eroding our civil liberties?
[01:29:09.226 --> 01:29:10.949]  Trust us?
[01:29:10.949 --> 01:29:14.814]  Maybe the plan just really doesn't exist and that's why they won't show it to us.
[01:29:15.555 --> 01:29:16.476]  I don't know.
[01:29:16.476 --> 01:29:19.297]  Or maybe there's something there that's outrageous.
[01:29:19.297 --> 01:29:26.861]  The American people need their elected representatives to review this plan for the continuity of government.
[01:29:33.052 --> 01:29:45.758]  And we have Senator Inhofe, we have Congressman Brad Sherman and others that we interviewed here on air or we played clips of on air, both from Congress and here, where they were told martial law will be declared if you don't pass the banker bailout unread on October 3rd, 2008.
[01:29:48.976 --> 01:30:00.190]  And then they bait-and-switched and said it was going to be for the subprime mortgages, and then they said, we're not going to tell you, and it wasn't $700 billion, they just picked a really big number, that's a quote, and it's now $9.7 trillion, five and a half months into this.
[01:30:00.190 --> 01:30:01.010]  Do the math.
[01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:03.754]  October, November, December, January, February.
[01:30:03.754 --> 01:30:04.815]  Five months.
[01:30:04.815 --> 01:30:06.837]  Five months and change into this.
[01:30:09.686 --> 01:30:11.427]  9.7 trillion to offshore banks.
[01:30:11.427 --> 01:30:24.833]  These are a bunch of Bernard Madoff scam artists that created all this fiat currency to buy the world, and now they're saying a New World Bank, Bank of the World, all over the news, will save us and will pay carbon taxes to them on every facet of our lives.
[01:30:24.833 --> 01:30:32.497]  So see, now the media's forced, after all these years of saying there's no New World Order, to admit there is, but Glenn Beck says, well, they might be building camps.
[01:30:32.497 --> 01:30:36.619]  And he makes a joke about conspiracy theories and then says, but you know, maybe they're needed.
[01:30:37.489 --> 01:30:38.850]  Maybe they're needed.
[01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:39.871]  So, that's coming up.
[01:30:39.871 --> 01:30:45.256]  This is the supposed champion exposing all of this.
[01:30:45.256 --> 01:30:46.697]  It's just incredible.
[01:30:46.697 --> 01:30:47.538]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:30:47.538 --> 01:30:51.322]  Stay with us.
[01:30:51.322 --> 01:30:52.723]  We're on the march.
[01:30:52.723 --> 01:30:55.245]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:55.245 --> 01:30:57.948]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:31:01.311 --> 01:31:02.694]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[01:31:02.694 --> 01:31:05.099]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[01:31:05.099 --> 01:31:09.248]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:31:09.248 --> 01:31:11.313]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[01:31:14.650 --> 01:31:21.572]  If you're dreaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the Earth is cooling, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:31:21.572 --> 01:31:25.413]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[01:31:25.413 --> 01:31:31.795]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:31:31.795 --> 01:31:35.396]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[01:31:35.396 --> 01:31:39.798]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:31:39.798 --> 01:31:40.878]  For the rest of you, go to
[01:31:43.715 --> 01:31:47.958]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:47.958 --> 01:31:49.239]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:32:10.444 --> 01:32:12.005]  But who is the enemy?
[01:32:12.005 --> 01:32:12.806]  Bin Laden.
[01:32:12.806 --> 01:32:13.807]  This is his M.O.
[01:32:13.807 --> 01:32:15.168]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:32:15.168 --> 01:32:17.149]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:24.314]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:32:24.314 --> 01:32:24.795]  Some U.S.
[01:32:24.795 --> 01:32:30.479]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:32:31.139 --> 01:32:34.642]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:32:34.642 --> 01:32:37.444]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:33:01.153 --> 01:33:05.717]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.
[01:33:05.717 --> 01:33:08.600]  Can't afford a new vehicle or even an expensive repair?
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:15.386]  Now you can take care of your vehicle with Protecta Engine Oil Booster by SFR, which is a fully synthetic oil booster.
[01:33:15.386 --> 01:33:17.688]  Protecta Engine Oil Booster fortifies your motor oil

[01:33:49.622 --> 01:33:53.043]  Alright, let's cut right back into the news, continuing with all the FEMA camp evidence.
[01:34:11.661 --> 01:34:19.643]  We really got concerned in the mid to late 90s when the FBI training manuals went public, flyers distributed to every major city department, small city departments.
[01:34:19.643 --> 01:34:29.906]  They put federally paid for anti-terror, anti-extremist police, and even small departments as few as 10 officers to become spying on the American people.
[01:34:29.906 --> 01:34:37.788]  We got video from firefighters and police from FEMA training seminars where they badmouth the Second Amendment, the Founding Fathers, that's in my film The Road to Tyranny, free on Google and YouTube.
[01:34:39.076 --> 01:34:40.317]  Here's just one of the flyers.
[01:34:40.317 --> 01:34:56.755]  Call a member of the Phoenix FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, Investigator Al Shearer, Maricopa County's office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and when you read the back of the flyer, just Google FBI Flyer Constitutional Terrorist.
[01:34:56.755 --> 01:35:00.038]  You can then go read it and call the phone numbers on it and talk to the FBI if you'd like.
[01:35:01.019 --> 01:35:03.721]  And give me a close shot, I want to show folks the cover of the flyer.
[01:35:03.721 --> 01:35:06.703]  When you read in there it says, Constitutional Terrorist.
[01:35:06.703 --> 01:35:08.064]  People that make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:35:08.064 --> 01:35:09.005]  Constitution.
[01:35:09.005 --> 01:35:11.187]  People that say they believe in the Second Amendment.
[01:35:11.187 --> 01:35:14.549]  Are terrorists and need to be put in terrorism databases.
[01:35:14.549 --> 01:35:18.392]  Now, people thought this ended with Clinton and expanded covertly under Bush.
[01:35:21.263 --> 01:35:25.666]  So there is just one of the many flyers and pieces of material.
[01:35:25.666 --> 01:35:31.670]  On that, continuing, let's go ahead and play Congressman Brad Sherman, who we also interviewed here on the show.
[01:35:31.670 --> 01:35:33.431]  They were threatened with martial law.
[01:35:33.431 --> 01:35:37.434]  He wouldn't stay on the show because of House rules and closed committee.
[01:35:37.434 --> 01:35:38.114]  Who threatened them?
[01:35:38.114 --> 01:35:46.280]  Later, Senator Inhofe went public from Oklahoma and said it was Ben Bernanke, head of the private Federal Reserve and the head of the Treasury, Paulson at the time.
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:49.302]  This has all just expanded under Obama, hasn't gone away.
[01:35:49.302 --> 01:35:50.983]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[01:35:51.523 --> 01:35:59.215]  From Ohio, the only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere.
[01:35:59.215 --> 01:36:01.538]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[01:36:02.509 --> 01:36:22.319]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday, that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[01:36:23.533 --> 01:36:25.994]  That's what I call fear-mongering.
[01:36:25.994 --> 01:36:27.335]  Unjustified.
[01:36:27.335 --> 01:36:28.715]  Proven wrong.
[01:36:28.715 --> 01:36:32.457]  We've got a week, we've got two weeks to write a good bill.
[01:36:32.457 --> 01:36:36.799]  The only way to write, to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on.
[01:36:36.799 --> 01:36:39.200]  Alright, now what has the Senate done?
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.861]  Alright, now, I've gone through about 20 exhibits.
[01:36:41.861 --> 01:36:46.303]  There are over 100 exhibits, and this week or next week, I'm gonna do
[01:36:47.984 --> 01:36:51.207]  Two hours, with no calls, going through the exhibits.
[01:36:51.207 --> 01:37:07.903]  I'm going to pull all my research, all the bills, all the legislation, the whole history of the camps, mainstream media clips admitting it, but trying to sell it to the public, and we're going to do a full, you know, half of the show, at least two hours on this subject, uninterrupted, with guests or calls.
[01:37:10.697 --> 01:37:21.561]  I want to challenge folks that after they watch us at PrisonPlanet.tv and it gets ripped to the web everywhere, which we appreciate, if you're watching this in a later part, be sure and watch the first few parts of the video.
[01:37:21.561 --> 01:37:23.602]  I imagine this will be four or five parts.
[01:37:23.602 --> 01:37:39.168]  Because you need to see the background, the proof I went over of the camps all admitted publicly for the American people, gun confiscation, forced inoculation, buying off city leaders, corporate leaders under InfraGard, the clergy response teams, all these terms I'm using Google, you'll have mainstream news, but always telling you how good it is.
[01:37:41.348 --> 01:37:45.249]  So that when I get into Glenn Beck here briefly, you understand.
[01:37:45.249 --> 01:37:50.590]  Because Glenn Beck over and over again on his radio show says basically, arrest 9-11 truthers, send us to secret camps.
[01:37:50.590 --> 01:37:55.531]  It was a talking point on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC.
[01:37:55.531 --> 01:38:00.132]  Use the army against Ron Paul supporters because they're domestic threats.
[01:38:00.132 --> 01:38:03.433]  Sean Hannity saying arrest all militia members, every child needs a chip.
[01:38:03.433 --> 01:38:05.213]  I mean, these guys push a lot of sick stuff.
[01:38:05.213 --> 01:38:09.454]  And then Beck suddenly, when it's all announced as a world government, comes out and acts like he's fighting it.
[01:38:09.774 --> 01:38:10.755]  But then we'll mix into it.
[01:38:10.755 --> 01:38:12.195]  We've got a, you know, Russia's a threat.
[01:38:12.195 --> 01:38:13.356]  Iran's a threat.
[01:38:13.356 --> 01:38:14.476]  You know, we've got to do this.
[01:38:14.476 --> 01:38:16.817]  Oh, I'm worried about the Bubbas and their guns.
[01:38:16.817 --> 01:38:18.198]  Maybe we need FEMA camps.
[01:38:18.198 --> 01:38:19.379]  I don't know if FEMA camps exist.
[01:38:19.379 --> 01:38:20.059]  Maybe they do.
[01:38:20.059 --> 01:38:24.401]  You know, I was going to cover it, but now I'm not because I'm still researching.
[01:38:24.401 --> 01:38:26.202]  Oh, I guess Fox is censoring me.
[01:38:26.202 --> 01:38:27.382]  You know, conspiracy theories.
[01:38:27.382 --> 01:38:32.585]  Making a joke out of that when it's on record that all the major media is on government payroll and talking points.
[01:38:33.405 --> 01:38:34.826]  In fact, pull up some of the articles.
[01:38:34.826 --> 01:38:36.248]  I had you guys pull up some of the headlines.
[01:38:36.248 --> 01:38:41.493]  You just Google, Pentagon paying for fake news in the U.S., White House paying for fake news in the U.S.
[01:38:41.493 --> 01:38:44.516]  It's now in the tens of billions every year.
[01:38:44.516 --> 01:38:51.463]  But when it came out, they just used one Armstrong-Williams case and one at the New York Times where somebody was being paid off to lie about aluminum tubes.
[01:38:51.463 --> 01:38:52.504]  This is what's going on.
[01:38:53.797 --> 01:39:08.876]  So, there's an Infowars.net story, but if you notice, I point you to our articles because when you go to Pentagon Expands Propaganda Reach with foreign news websites, which they then admit are being pushed domestically, and then you can go to USA Today, see a link there, and go to the
[01:39:10.137 --> 01:39:16.964]  Other mainstream news articles, all those, see all those blue hyperlinks, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you can go to that story, link to all of those.
[01:39:16.964 --> 01:39:24.271]  I've had Congress people on talking about how it's illegal, the fake news, the fake news reports they produced and put on radio and TV that were made by the government.
[01:39:25.413 --> 01:39:26.813]  All of this is being done.
[01:39:26.813 --> 01:39:28.414]  Fake polls, everything.
[01:39:28.414 --> 01:39:30.574]  So his joke about that is asinine.
[01:39:30.574 --> 01:39:32.175]  Let's go ahead.
[01:39:32.175 --> 01:39:34.175]  We've done an audio boildown.
[01:39:34.175 --> 01:39:35.696]  We're going to play a few video clips.
[01:39:35.696 --> 01:39:39.337]  Again, when I do a full report on this, we'll get into more detail as we analyze this propaganda.
[01:39:39.337 --> 01:39:42.958]  Here's Glenn Beck on several shows, his own, Fox & Friends, and others.
[01:39:42.958 --> 01:39:47.339]  Then we cut back to him demonizing Ron Paul supporters and equating us with Timothy McVeigh.
[01:39:47.339 --> 01:39:48.419]  This is our champion.
[01:39:48.419 --> 01:39:50.300]  This is our friend that's waking up.
[01:39:52.105 --> 01:39:56.406]  On Fox News, injecting all this Iran's got nuke propaganda in the middle of it.
[01:39:56.406 --> 01:39:58.406]  Same propaganda we heard under Bush.
[01:39:58.406 --> 01:39:59.867]  Here it is.
[01:39:59.867 --> 01:40:04.827]  I told you that I was going to tell you about the FEMA camps or the FEMA prisons today.
[01:40:04.827 --> 01:40:09.688]  This is something that I snapped on the air because somebody called me up and said, do you, why don't you talk about the FEMA prisons?
[01:40:09.688 --> 01:40:13.269]  And I said, can we just settle the FEMA prison thing?
[01:40:13.269 --> 01:40:15.350]  I don't believe in the FEMA prison.
[01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:17.470]  If these things exist, that's bad.
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:23.566]  If they don't exist, it's irresponsible to not debunk this story.
[01:40:23.566 --> 01:40:28.131]  We have an independent group on this program looking into it, turning over every stone.
[01:40:28.131 --> 01:40:30.514]  I am going to bring you this story.
[01:40:30.514 --> 01:40:32.556]  This program is not beholden.
[01:40:32.556 --> 01:40:36.681]  This is going to drive the conspiracy theorists crazy.
[01:40:36.681 --> 01:40:38.643]  They're making me say this.
[01:40:38.643 --> 01:40:38.864]  Help!
[01:40:39.764 --> 01:40:42.105]  This program is not beholden to anybody.
[01:40:42.105 --> 01:40:43.266]  Stop right there!
[01:40:43.266 --> 01:40:50.008]  He says he's going to cover FEMA camps and then he makes a joke about they're making me, you know, not say this help.
[01:40:50.008 --> 01:40:52.570]  So he's discrediting it right there.
[01:40:52.570 --> 01:40:54.010]  Let's continue with the clip.
[01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.811]  Ourselves, I answer to me.
[01:40:56.811 --> 01:41:02.634]  I lost sleep last night worrying about this story, thinking about this story and wanted to make sure that I got it right.
[01:41:02.634 --> 01:41:08.136]  The only thing that I answer to is myself and I just want to be able to look at myself in the mirror
[01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:09.981]  And also sleep at night.
[01:41:09.981 --> 01:41:31.541]  Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep,
[01:41:32.161 --> 01:41:33.623]  It is our government.
[01:41:33.623 --> 01:41:36.225]  If you trust our government, it's fine.
[01:41:36.225 --> 01:41:41.989]  If you have any kind of fear that we might be headed towards a totalitarian state, look out.
[01:41:41.989 --> 01:41:42.589]  Buckle up.
[01:41:42.589 --> 01:41:46.653]  There's something going on in our country that is, uh, ain't good.
[01:41:46.653 --> 01:41:49.195]  Joining me now is Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:55.028]  I know we've been in contact with your office and we would appreciate any help that you have.
[01:41:55.028 --> 01:41:57.270]  I want to make sure we're turning over every stone.
[01:41:57.270 --> 01:42:07.399]  There's a lot of crazy stuff that is being said about these things and I appreciate you talking to us and we'll be in touch with you again because I want to make sure that we have everything that you might be concerned with as well.
[01:42:11.519 --> 01:42:15.383]  Ron Paul's supporters are tapping into something that's very real.
[01:42:15.383 --> 01:42:19.107]  The rising tide of disenfranchisement in this country.
[01:42:19.107 --> 01:42:27.295]  If fringe elements take that disenfranchisement and turn it into violence, we endanger the freedoms we're supposedly all fighting for.
[01:42:27.535 --> 01:42:40.280]  You're going after everybody, and here's the thing, at one point with security so high and tensions on edge, don't you think they're going to get at the very least tased or beaten to a pulp by somebody who goes, these people look threatening?
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.381]  They don't look threatening?
[01:42:41.381 --> 01:42:43.302]  The Ron Paul revolution.
[01:42:43.302 --> 01:42:49.464]  I think it's meant to be a catchy slogan, but I fear some of his fringe supporters are taking the word revolution too literally.
[01:42:49.464 --> 01:42:55.847]  These truthers are exactly the kind of people who want to rock this nation's foundation terrace apart and plant seeds of dissatisfaction
[01:42:56.227 --> 01:42:58.708]  In all of us, these guys are dangerous.
[01:42:58.708 --> 01:43:03.591]  I believe these guys are anarchists that are looking to tear us apart.
[01:43:03.591 --> 01:43:08.253]  I mean, this is the kind of group that a Timothy McVeigh would come from.
[01:43:11.693 --> 01:43:13.554]  And folks, it goes on and on.
[01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:24.242]  This is our little friend that he hates the 9-11 families that say it's an inside job, that he hates 9-11 truthers, and it was a talking point, you know, where, oh, the 9-11 truthers are going to bomb us.
[01:43:24.242 --> 01:43:26.084]  They work for Al-Qaeda.
[01:43:26.084 --> 01:43:28.405]  On all these news channels, a talking point.
[01:43:28.405 --> 01:43:33.089]  Now, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, every major publication, you name it, they've done it.
[01:43:33.709 --> 01:43:38.693]  Just type New World Order and pick the name of your newspaper, add it at the end, you'll see articles on Google.
[01:43:38.693 --> 01:43:39.974]  I mean, I've done this test.
[01:43:39.974 --> 01:43:40.934]  Everyone.
[01:43:40.934 --> 01:43:41.515]  Everywhere.
[01:43:41.515 --> 01:43:43.616]  But they're saying it's good.
[01:43:43.616 --> 01:43:46.438]  All these years saying it didn't exist.
[01:43:46.438 --> 01:43:50.781]  All these years saying that we were liars and crazies and we had all the documents and the video clips.
[01:43:50.781 --> 01:43:57.326]  Now they admit it's happening but say it's going to save us.
[01:43:57.326 --> 01:43:59.067]  You see, they have to get you to trust them.
[01:43:59.067 --> 01:44:01.409]  So, if you watch Glenn Beck
[01:44:02.435 --> 01:44:03.275]  Well, not even closely.
[01:44:03.275 --> 01:44:04.216]  It's completely obvious.
[01:44:04.216 --> 01:44:07.597]  Every night, he'll go, yeah, New World Order, global bankers, oh, it's horrible.
[01:44:07.597 --> 01:44:15.821]  And then he'll build the fear up and then say, flip it, by the way, Putin's wanting to attack us and so is Iran, and we've got to go after these guys right now.
[01:44:15.821 --> 01:44:18.502]  The terrorists are about to hit us, and I'm worried about the bubble factor.
[01:44:18.502 --> 01:44:19.603]  I'm worried about these gun owners.
[01:44:20.677 --> 01:44:21.758]  But I'm worried about the government, too.
[01:44:21.758 --> 01:44:22.218]  What do I do?
[01:44:22.218 --> 01:44:24.379]  I mean, if you trust the government, the camps aren't a problem.
[01:44:24.379 --> 01:44:28.883]  But if you don't trust them, and it's meant to create fear, it's a chilling effect to everybody out there that knows what's going on.
[01:44:28.883 --> 01:44:31.304]  Oh, my God, they're admitting camps, so we shut up.
[01:44:31.304 --> 01:44:35.247]  And then so the couch potatoes make the psychological decision to go, oh, well, I'm scared of Putin.
[01:44:35.247 --> 01:44:39.490]  It has nothing to do with it, but I'm scared of Putin, so I guess I'm for these camps.
[01:44:39.490 --> 01:44:41.271]  And see, now they're rolling them out in the news.
[01:44:41.271 --> 01:44:48.696]  The camps will be for you when you're starving, during the collapse of society, which is what the IMF and World Bank have done to countless third world countries in their own documents say they want to do it here.
[01:44:50.216 --> 01:44:58.118]  That to fully bankrupt you so they can consolidate everything with the tens of trillions of fiat currency they're holding, and hoarding, of taxpayer money.
[01:44:58.118 --> 01:45:06.941]  And then once the riots start, which they're trying to push, you know, they had Bezigna Brzezinski on MSNBC, we played that the other day, saying, I'm really worried about these bankers, they're going to cause riots nationwide.
[01:45:06.941 --> 01:45:09.002]  As if he isn't one of the engineers of it.
[01:45:09.002 --> 01:45:11.703]  See, they know they've got revolution on their hands.
[01:45:11.703 --> 01:45:19.105]  They know that we did our job warning the people, and exposing what was happening, and putting all this information out, and people found out it was true.
[01:45:20.666 --> 01:45:23.528]  So, recapping.
[01:45:23.528 --> 01:45:29.332]  The Department of Defense in the Washington Post has announced they are putting regular troops on the streets to engage the American people.
[01:45:29.332 --> 01:45:31.053]  The Army War College admits this.
[01:45:31.053 --> 01:45:34.155]  They secretly have had Americans in camps since 1986.
[01:45:34.155 --> 01:45:35.736]  It was declassified in 1997.
[01:45:35.736 --> 01:45:37.457]  Sounds incredible.
[01:45:37.457 --> 01:45:40.479]  You can read it all right here in the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp program.
[01:45:41.701 --> 01:45:44.163]  Just Google that, you'll be at army.mil.
[01:45:44.163 --> 01:45:48.747]  They've introduced legislation for a million-person domestic security force.
[01:45:48.747 --> 01:45:56.393]  We went over that area of the Army Code that they have now announced and issued.
[01:45:56.393 --> 01:46:00.417]  They have also introduced the National Emergency Centers Act, H.R.
[01:46:00.417 --> 01:46:04.680]  645, to build these FEMA camps and integrate them with the local police and military.
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:07.683]  They are federalizing the National Guard under NORTHCOM completely.
[01:46:10.287 --> 01:46:13.029]  That is the type of news and information we have.
[01:46:13.029 --> 01:46:17.631]  We've played you congressmen telling you that they are not allowed to see the martial law plans but that they're there.
[01:46:17.631 --> 01:46:19.692]  We have the cover sheet, PDD 51.
[01:46:19.692 --> 01:46:24.655]  We've played you the congressmen saying they've been threatened with martial law if they don't do whatever they're told by the White House.
[01:46:24.655 --> 01:46:28.317]  We've played you the clips and have these congressmen and people here on the show.
[01:46:30.421 --> 01:46:36.528]  We've shown you House hearings about the secret camps and Congressmen being told to shut up, you can't talk about the camps.
[01:46:36.528 --> 01:46:39.471]  We've shown you the FBI terror flyer.
[01:46:39.471 --> 01:46:46.759]  Now I told you guys just on the fly to Google Kansas City, FEMA in Kansas City, says Founding Fathers terrorist.
[01:46:48.592 --> 01:46:49.952]  Were you able to find that?
[01:46:49.952 --> 01:46:50.393]  Here it is.
[01:46:50.393 --> 01:46:52.913]  This is from my film, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:46:52.913 --> 01:46:55.574]  I don't know how this is from web video.
[01:46:55.574 --> 01:46:57.795]  I have the high-quality DVDs here.
[01:46:57.795 --> 01:46:59.836]  People can get it in a combo pack, a three-pack.
[01:46:59.836 --> 01:47:02.657]  The three films are in one, but in higher quality.
[01:47:02.657 --> 01:47:03.557]  But here it is from YouTube.
[01:47:03.557 --> 01:47:06.078]  I want to show you this so you can find it now for free and get it.
[01:47:06.078 --> 01:47:08.099]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:47:08.099 --> 01:47:09.679]  Founding fathers were terrorists.
[01:47:09.679 --> 01:47:11.540]  And it goes, I mean, I have 18 hours of this.
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:13.300]  I have them training all over the country.
[01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:16.521]  I have them teaching police to arrest anybody with a Get Us Out of the UN sticker.
[01:47:16.521 --> 01:47:17.702]  This is what's been going on.
[01:47:17.702 --> 01:47:18.082]  Here it is.
[01:47:21.241 --> 01:47:23.542]  It damn hurt, because think about the Christians, okay?
[01:47:23.542 --> 01:47:25.684]  Do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?
[01:47:25.684 --> 01:47:25.884]  No.
[01:47:25.884 --> 01:47:26.484]  What did they do?
[01:47:26.484 --> 01:47:28.285]  They took your head off!
[01:47:28.285 --> 01:47:31.627]  They behaved you if you didn't accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.
[01:47:31.627 --> 01:47:33.748]  See, this is reality.
[01:47:33.748 --> 01:47:38.651]  Yeah, they're terrorists, but the bottom line is, to them, they are not.
[01:47:38.651 --> 01:47:40.472]  Now, why is that important to understand?
[01:47:40.472 --> 01:47:46.695]  Because they are as committed to their cause and to their way of life as you are yours.
[01:47:46.695 --> 01:47:49.397]  And they see you as being wrong.
[01:47:54.114 --> 01:47:59.316]  When people are passionate about what they believe in, they become a very difficult entity to deal with.
[01:47:59.316 --> 01:48:04.077]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[01:48:04.077 --> 01:48:04.497]  Who?
[01:48:04.497 --> 01:48:05.557]  The Founding Fathers.
[01:48:05.557 --> 01:48:06.918]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[01:48:06.918 --> 01:48:08.178]  Back it up!
[01:48:08.178 --> 01:48:09.938]  Stop it right there!
[01:48:09.938 --> 01:48:10.718]  Stop it right there!
[01:48:13.493 --> 01:48:14.734]  You notice what Glenn Beck kept saying?
[01:48:14.734 --> 01:48:16.895]  Oh, these crazies, crazy stuff about FEMA camps.
[01:48:16.895 --> 01:48:17.876]  Ooh, they're going to get me.
[01:48:17.876 --> 01:48:18.776]  Making jokes.
[01:48:18.776 --> 01:48:19.997]  Look at this guy.
[01:48:19.997 --> 01:48:23.279]  He's talking about the Founding Fathers and people that are committed.
[01:48:23.279 --> 01:48:24.479]  He's talking about constitutional terrorists.
[01:48:24.479 --> 01:48:28.922]  Before that, we have the FBI training manuals and flyers they give police.
[01:48:28.922 --> 01:48:29.742]  We just showed you.
[01:48:29.742 --> 01:48:30.843]  The cops are so conditioned.
[01:48:30.843 --> 01:48:32.544]  They say, who are the terrorists?
[01:48:32.544 --> 01:48:33.364]  Who were the first terrorists?
[01:48:33.364 --> 01:48:34.125]  The Founding Fathers.
[01:48:34.125 --> 01:48:34.685]  They all know.
[01:48:34.685 --> 01:48:35.786]  They all say Founding Fathers.
[01:48:35.786 --> 01:48:38.848]  They've already been taught this many times.
[01:48:38.848 --> 01:48:39.148]  And then,
[01:48:41.007 --> 01:48:43.448]  He says that's a very difficult enemy to beat.
[01:48:43.448 --> 01:48:48.849]  No, you are the enemy when you become an enemy of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and let foreign bankers take us over.
[01:48:48.849 --> 01:48:49.369]  Play it again.
[01:49:02.304 --> 01:49:04.204]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[01:49:04.204 --> 01:49:07.045]  You mean George Washington?
[01:49:07.045 --> 01:49:08.705]  Paul Revere?
[01:49:08.705 --> 01:49:10.245]  These guys right here.
[01:49:10.245 --> 01:49:12.426]  Let me ask you something.
[01:49:12.426 --> 01:49:15.906]  Did they try to scare people?
[01:49:15.906 --> 01:49:17.987]  They tried to intimidate the British.
[01:49:17.987 --> 01:49:20.107]  Did they use acts of violence?
[01:49:20.107 --> 01:49:30.129]  Your founding fathers, my founding fathers, were involved in acts of terrorism against British officials because they systematically had British officials assassinated.
[01:49:30.129 --> 01:49:30.909]  Assassinated.
[01:49:32.532 --> 01:49:55.022]  The guys who we call our founding fathers, George Washington, Mr. Honest, who cut down the cherry tree in Mizzit, is the same guy who signed death orders, if you will, on members of the greatest government, the greatest crown, who they wanted to eliminate because politically they had influence in certain pockets of the United States at that time, the 13 colonies, and they wanted to divide and conquer.
[01:49:55.022 --> 01:49:56.543]  They may have a whole lot of civilians,
[01:49:56.923 --> 01:49:59.766]  And hey, let's- I'm gonna be honest with you, okay?
[01:49:59.766 --> 01:50:07.873]  If they kill 10,000 civilians tomorrow with a biological agent, that's too bad for them.
[01:50:07.873 --> 01:50:10.556]  Yeah, so what if they kill 10,000 civilians?
[01:50:10.556 --> 01:50:12.037]  You know how these patriots are.
[01:50:12.037 --> 01:50:13.398]  They're always killing civilians.
[01:50:13.398 --> 01:50:14.459]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:50:14.459 --> 01:50:15.581]  That's from my film.
[01:50:15.581 --> 01:50:15.741]  Now...
[01:50:19.955 --> 01:50:27.567]  See how he talks about how they assassinated, they were bad, they wanted to divide and conquer, the founders wanted to divide and conquer, they were terrorists.
[01:50:27.567 --> 01:50:31.273]  And then you read the manuals, it says those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:50:31.273 --> 01:50:33.838]  Constitution are terrorists.
[01:50:35.037 --> 01:50:37.079]  Gun owners are terrorists.
[01:50:37.079 --> 01:50:38.901]  This is why the police are so brainwashed.
[01:50:38.901 --> 01:50:46.629]  And in this film, I then have the police from their own squad cars pulling over a woman at a warrantless checkpoint searching papers in Virginia.
[01:50:46.629 --> 01:50:50.773]  She's a naval veteran, no criminal record, Abby Newman, married, buying canning supplies in town.
[01:50:50.773 --> 01:50:52.835]  And they want to search her car, and she says no.
[01:50:52.835 --> 01:50:54.396]  They pull her out, slam her against the car.
[01:50:55.057 --> 01:51:02.803]  Charge her with assaulting him, she doesn't touch him, and then they dig out a pocket constitution in one of my videos, and they start getting scared going, she's one of them!
[01:51:02.803 --> 01:51:04.143]  She's one of the extremists!
[01:51:04.143 --> 01:51:05.484]  She's one of the terrorists!
[01:51:05.484 --> 01:51:09.167]  I can't believe we actually found one of them!
[01:51:09.167 --> 01:51:13.070]  It's squad car video, them with their microphones outside the car, freaking out!
[01:51:16.249 --> 01:51:18.431]  Freaking, I mean, police now pull you over with a Patriot sticker.
[01:51:18.431 --> 01:51:20.153]  They just go ahead and taser you in many cases.
[01:51:20.153 --> 01:51:21.915]  Because they're so scared to death.
[01:51:21.915 --> 01:51:25.939]  No, the real terrorists are the people teaching the police that our founding fathers were bad.
[01:51:25.939 --> 01:51:28.182]  Now, folks, I could go on for hour after hour, and I am.
[01:51:28.182 --> 01:51:29.703]  Sometime this week or next week.
[01:51:29.703 --> 01:51:30.865]  I'm gonna do two hours.
[01:51:32.418 --> 01:51:34.459]  Well, we're just going to go through it all.
[01:51:34.459 --> 01:51:37.521]  This is not 10% of the evidence I've got.
[01:51:37.521 --> 01:51:43.405]  Bob Chapman is going to join us for about 10-15 minutes with a quick economic update with the plunging stock market and what's happening then.
[01:51:43.405 --> 01:51:56.073]  For about an hour and a half, we've got Lindsey Williams coming back on with his powerful inside knowledge from former Atlantic Richfield executive about what's happening with this global operation plunging the oil prices to accentuate and accelerate the global depression.
[01:51:56.073 --> 01:51:57.914]  All this documentation is at InfoWars.com.
[01:51:57.914 --> 01:51:58.934]  You've been seeing.
[01:51:58.934 --> 01:51:59.455]  Stay with us.
[01:52:02.634 --> 01:52:06.604]  In these uncertain times, safety and precaution are key.
[01:52:06.604 --> 01:52:08.188]  Don't rely on others for protection.
[01:52:08.635 --> 01:52:12.218]  Protect yourself and your family with products from Pepperspray.com.
[01:52:12.218 --> 01:52:17.582]  Pepperspray.com carries the largest assortment of pepper spray and personal safety devices on the web.
[01:52:17.582 --> 01:52:21.325]  From home safety to nighttime safety we have the products you need.
[01:52:21.325 --> 01:52:31.913]  Order the Discreet Pepper Mace Baton, which relies on a powerful pepper formula that upon direct contact with an attacker's eyes, forces them to slam shut, causing an intense burning sensation.
[01:52:31.913 --> 01:52:35.016]  This refillable unit is designed to be carried as a key ring.
[01:52:35.016 --> 01:52:36.357]  Easily accessible pepper spray
[01:52:36.697 --> 01:52:37.578]  On September 11, 2001, along with
[01:53:04.301 --> 01:53:06.804]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:53:06.804 --> 01:53:08.145]  And we knew what to do.
[01:53:08.145 --> 01:53:10.148]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:53:10.148 --> 01:53:17.155]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:53:17.155 --> 01:53:25.705]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:53:26.075 --> 01:53:33.180]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:36.342]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[01:53:36.342 --> 01:53:42.125]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:53:42.125 --> 01:53:45.187]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:53:45.187 --> 01:53:51.972]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[01:53:54.753 --> 01:53:55.134]  We're good to go.
[01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:07.503]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[01:54:07.503 --> 01:54:13.925]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[01:54:13.925 --> 01:54:19.668]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[01:54:19.668 --> 01:54:22.629]  Starve or surrender.
[01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:26.430]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:27.311]  What then?
[01:54:30.029 --> 01:54:33.111]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[01:54:33.111 --> 01:54:37.454]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[01:54:37.454 --> 01:54:40.315]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[01:54:40.315 --> 01:54:47.540]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots, or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:49.441]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:54:49.441 --> 01:54:54.844]  And now you can go into business with Big John at SurvivalistSeeds.com by becoming an affiliate.
[01:54:54.844 --> 01:54:57.586]  See his link at SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:54:57.586 --> 01:54:58.446]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:55:01.348 --> 01:55:07.813]  Okay, until about 15 after next hour, we're going to have Bob Chapman with us, InternationalForecaster.com.
[01:55:07.813 --> 01:55:10.755]  My websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:55:10.755 --> 01:55:16.359]  In summation, the establishment knows everybody's waking up at the camps.
[01:55:16.359 --> 01:55:17.480]  Everything is exploding.
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:18.901]  Our web numbers alone are doubling.
[01:55:21.226 --> 01:55:22.447]  This is the buzz worldwide.
[01:55:22.447 --> 01:55:26.709]  I'm on British radio and they say I saw a huge yellow truck with InfoWars.com driving around today.
[01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:27.709]  Is that you paying for that?
[01:55:27.709 --> 01:55:28.729]  No.
[01:55:28.729 --> 01:55:31.851]  The people worldwide are waking up because we warned them beforehand.
[01:55:31.851 --> 01:55:33.452]  Everything we said came true.
[01:55:33.452 --> 01:55:39.274]  So the establishment comes out and mixes some truth about FEMA camps and things but then makes jokes about it.
[01:55:39.274 --> 01:55:41.395]  Mixing it in with patriots and gun owners are dangerous.
[01:55:41.395 --> 01:55:42.356]  He's currently doing that.
[01:55:43.633 --> 01:55:45.655]  Some of them get fooled by that.
[01:55:45.655 --> 01:55:46.655]  I challenge Glenn Beck.
[01:55:46.655 --> 01:55:49.557]  You claim you've been doing research for weeks on this and you can't sleep.
[01:55:49.557 --> 01:55:50.318]  Okay, buddy.
[01:55:50.318 --> 01:55:51.539]  Everybody's going to email you.
[01:55:52.930 --> 01:56:14.887]  Your radio show and Fox News, the last 45 minute piece we've done, your little staffers can watch that and everything there can be googled, pulled up from government documents, at army.mil and FBI and everywhere else, and then you'll have a clear picture of what's being set up and how they now have to orchestrate an economic collapse to get us to accept this as society breaks down.
[01:56:14.887 --> 01:56:16.889]  And my film, The Obama Deception, covers all of this.
[01:56:17.930 --> 01:56:20.251]  It's now available at InfoWars.com.
[01:56:20.251 --> 01:56:21.851]  And it shatters the left-right paradigm.
[01:56:21.851 --> 01:56:24.032]  President to president, it just continues.
[01:56:24.032 --> 01:56:25.352]  But that's the bottom line.
[01:56:25.352 --> 01:56:26.552]  I want to see all this.
[01:56:26.552 --> 01:56:28.753]  I want to see the civilian inmate labor camp program.
[01:56:28.753 --> 01:56:36.555]  I want to see the fact that the Army's announced they're going to engage the American people, and that NORTHCOM already has the country under effective martial law, and that Congress has been threatened with martial law.
[01:56:36.555 --> 01:56:37.395]  That is martial law.
[01:56:38.317 --> 01:56:44.021]  I want to hear that, Bubba, all together, instead of you making jokes and saying, oh, you know, conspiracy theory.
[01:56:44.021 --> 01:56:44.962]  That's what we want to hear.
[01:56:44.962 --> 01:56:47.584]  This is happening because we're winning, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:47.584 --> 01:56:49.405]  They're being forced to cover all this.
[01:56:49.405 --> 01:56:57.851]  Bob Chapman, formerly with Army Intelligence, in the largest financial newsletter on record until he retired, he's come back, and also the largest gold and private silver broker.
[01:56:58.551 --> 01:57:05.455]  Bob Chapman, also, of course, a great patriot, helped fund and finance the publishing of Dundare Call Conspiracy with Gary Allen back in the 70s.
[01:57:05.455 --> 01:57:06.235]  He's been working with J.E.B.
[01:57:06.235 --> 01:57:07.916]  Griffin and others for more than 40 years.
[01:57:07.916 --> 01:57:09.697]  Good to have you here with us.
[01:57:09.697 --> 01:57:25.585]  I want to come back in 15 minutes and cover the latest financial developments, but in a few minutes, sir, I know you've been on hold listening, your take on the fact that they're now admitting world government, push it, but saying it's going to save us, and then vexing, yeah, there's some camps, maybe they're good, maybe they're bad, but then giving no more information.
[01:57:25.585 --> 01:57:26.065]  Bob Chapman.
[01:57:27.375 --> 01:57:31.137]  Well, first of all, I think they've been exposed.
[01:57:31.137 --> 01:57:34.338]  You know, these broadcasts are going all over the world.
[01:57:34.338 --> 01:57:39.160]  There are only a handful of people, but they're making a tremendous difference.
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:48.124]  We're getting emails from all over the world from people saying, you know, thank you for being on the programs and enlightening us to what's going on.
[01:57:48.124 --> 01:57:52.026]  And we're getting a lot of foreign subscribers as well.
[01:57:52.026 --> 01:57:54.507]  Just recently, we've got about 10 from Russia.
[01:57:55.454 --> 01:57:57.215]  Plus other places throughout the world.
[01:57:57.215 --> 01:58:01.517]  I'm having troops come up to me on the street and say they're awake and call in and letters.
[01:58:01.517 --> 01:58:02.557]  I mean, police?
[01:58:02.557 --> 01:58:04.298]  Go ahead.
[01:58:04.298 --> 01:58:05.518]  Well, that's great.
[01:58:05.518 --> 01:58:12.121]  And that's the reason I mention that, is that's why the conspiracy is exposing itself.
[01:58:12.121 --> 01:58:13.482]  Because it has to.
[01:58:13.482 --> 01:58:15.823]  It doesn't have any choice at this point.
[01:58:15.823 --> 01:58:17.984]  Too many people know what they're doing now.
[01:58:17.984 --> 01:58:20.725]  And it's going to get greater and greater and greater in the ignorant
[01:58:21.249 --> 01:58:25.070]  And the uneducated are finally going to catch on as well.
[01:58:25.070 --> 01:58:30.011]  So now they're just hiding in plain view going, oh yeah, there's a world government in FEMA camps, but let's have a discussion.
[01:58:30.011 --> 01:58:33.372]  Maybe we need them.
[01:58:33.372 --> 01:58:34.552]  You're right about that.
[01:58:34.552 --> 01:58:48.176]  And I think that the propaganda that's being spewed out, this mixture of 95% truth and 5% propaganda, isn't going to work.
[01:58:48.176 --> 01:58:49.996]  And you've gone through it fairly well.
[01:58:50.815 --> 01:58:55.079]  In a very short period of time, very thoroughly, especially in regard to Glenn Beck.
[01:58:55.079 --> 01:58:58.521]  And we discussed this a couple of weeks ago.
[01:58:58.521 --> 01:59:06.247]  And they just want you to think that the major media is covering this, when in fact they're really not.
[01:59:06.247 --> 01:59:09.830]  It's really misdirection.
[01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:15.234]  But this, I mean, every historical indication shows this means they're desperate and that they're in trouble.
[01:59:15.234 --> 01:59:16.155]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:59:16.155 --> 01:59:18.677]  And I don't think many people realize this.
[01:59:19.255 --> 01:59:25.017]  I mean, you know, you and some others who are on the air are really drilling this thing.
[01:59:25.017 --> 01:59:34.599]  But I am very, very chagrined, very unhappy that very few newsletter writers have pursued this.
[01:59:34.599 --> 01:59:35.560]  Stay there, Bob.
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:36.080]  Got a break.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:37.260]  70-second break.
[01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:39.181]  Third hour, only seconds away.
[01:59:39.181 --> 01:59:43.742]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:59:46.727 --> 01:59:50.991]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:50.991 --> 01:59:51.611]  Hello, friends.
[01:59:51.611 --> 01:59:52.672]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:59:52.672 --> 01:59:57.416]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:59:57.416 --> 02:00:00.398]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:00:00.398 --> 02:00:03.441]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:00:03.441 --> 02:00:08.145]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:00:08.365 --> 02:00:09.505]  If you simply prepare.
[02:00:09.505 --> 02:00:12.747]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:00:12.747 --> 02:00:19.730]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:00:19.730 --> 02:00:23.011]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[02:00:40.156 --> 02:00:41.977]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:00:53.777 --> 02:00:56.179]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:56.179 --> 02:01:05.444]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:05.444 --> 02:01:06.765]  Big Brother.
[02:01:06.765 --> 02:01:08.526]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:08.526 --> 02:01:10.287]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:10.287 --> 02:01:11.848]  You want answers?
[02:01:11.848 --> 02:01:13.429]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:13.429 --> 02:01:17.611]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:17.611 --> 02:01:21.654]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:24.548 --> 02:01:25.809]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[02:01:25.809 --> 02:01:30.793]  The mainstream media everywhere is admitting world government is here, but saying it will save us.
[02:01:30.793 --> 02:01:34.296]  A few people like Lou Dobbs are saying it's a bad idea.
[02:01:34.296 --> 02:01:38.299]  He's been credibly doing it for a long time, but conservatively, I believe he's good.
[02:01:38.299 --> 02:01:41.822]  But CNN lets him on to have some credibility, because people now
[02:01:42.222 --> 02:01:43.183]  No, this is going on.
[02:01:43.183 --> 02:01:45.785]  The establishment can't ignore it any longer.
[02:01:45.785 --> 02:01:47.387]  So we're into a conditioning period.
[02:01:47.387 --> 02:01:48.768]  And the establishment's getting scared.
[02:01:48.768 --> 02:01:51.371]  That's why Brzezinski and all of them are on TV going, oh, the evil bankers.
[02:01:51.371 --> 02:01:52.331]  Oh, we've got to do something.
[02:01:52.331 --> 02:01:57.997]  They're going to bait and switch that and shut down smaller tax havens for the general public at the retail level.
[02:01:57.997 --> 02:02:00.479]  So they use our anger and put it into their own operations.
[02:02:00.479 --> 02:02:02.641]  It's very, very sophisticated.
[02:02:02.641 --> 02:02:04.362]  Bob Chapman, let's get into what's happening.
[02:02:05.259 --> 02:02:08.622]  Right, and I think if we were to hold at $4,000 we would be very, very fortunate.
[02:02:08.622 --> 02:02:09.322]  We touched $6,700 yesterday.
[02:02:33.826 --> 02:02:44.449]  In that area, and the news that came out today was so dreadful on employment and other things, and the market's up 127 points.
[02:02:44.449 --> 02:02:50.390]  And that means the United States government's in there trying to hold the market up to keep it from going lower.
[02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:57.932]  I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't get a small rally here back to 7200, which would be normal, and to test that 7268.
[02:02:59.725 --> 02:03:04.428]  Bottom that was set in 1994 and then again in 2002.
[02:03:04.428 --> 02:03:15.394]  And so, over the period of time here, we'll go down into the 6,000, the 6,600 area, probably in the next month or so.
[02:03:15.394 --> 02:03:20.957]  And it'll find some sort of a bottom there, and then it'll rally again and then go lower.
[02:03:20.957 --> 02:03:28.842]  But perhaps this year, in all probability next year, and the timing on this is so hard,
[02:03:29.923 --> 02:03:31.124]  We're going to see 4,000.
[02:03:31.124 --> 02:03:39.869]  And if you want to project what happened during the last depression, and we are in a depression already.
[02:03:39.869 --> 02:03:43.110]  We started at the beginning of February.
[02:03:43.110 --> 02:03:50.894]  If you want to go back and compare it to the 1930s, and I believe we're about five times worse off today than we were then.
[02:03:50.894 --> 02:03:56.497]  I think that we're looking at a duplication of the 89% correction
[02:03:58.399 --> 02:04:08.065]  That took place in 1933, and if that's the case, we're going down to somewhere between 1,260 and 1,450.
[02:04:08.065 --> 02:04:11.928]  And that's a long, long way down.
[02:04:11.928 --> 02:04:14.889]  And we'll eventually get there.
[02:04:14.889 --> 02:04:25.096]  And now the establishment just has to manage the collapse, pose as our saviors, blame a few little made-offs, the other minions, while they carry out the Ponzi scheme that's meant to implode the whole world into their hands.
[02:04:25.096 --> 02:04:26.497]  I don't think they're going to get away with it, Bob.
[02:04:27.435 --> 02:04:28.836]  I don't think so either.
[02:04:28.836 --> 02:04:36.364]  And I think, you know, one of their major problems is going to be right on Wall Street for people who are not directly involved.
[02:04:36.364 --> 02:04:39.927]  People who work there, they have a good idea what's going on.
[02:04:39.927 --> 02:04:51.398]  And I talked to some of them, and they usually live out in Long Island or a little bit upstate or over in New Jersey, and they're all armed and doing the same thing that we're doing, because they know what's coming.
[02:04:51.803 --> 02:04:53.204]  Now that's the issue.
[02:04:53.204 --> 02:04:54.664]  We told the truth for decades.
[02:04:54.664 --> 02:04:58.266]  You told it for 40 plus years as we read the globalist plans.
[02:04:58.266 --> 02:04:59.406]  Now it's all coming true.
[02:04:59.406 --> 02:05:02.988]  We did our work planting the seeds of truth.
[02:05:02.988 --> 02:05:06.329]  Man, this is going to be one hell of a fight though, Bob.
[02:05:06.329 --> 02:05:16.373]  I know it is and they know if they lose, they're going to totally lose power and in some instances via treason, they're probably going to forfeit their lives and fortunes.
[02:05:17.725 --> 02:05:18.145]  That's right.
[02:05:18.145 --> 02:05:22.249]  They are evil, evil people and they are going to have another war and I've been talking about that on this program for some time.
[02:05:36.383 --> 02:05:37.003]  Bob, stay there.
[02:05:37.003 --> 02:05:44.647]  Let's talk more about the economy and how fast the deepening depression is accelerating and how bad it's going to get with Bob Chapman.
[02:05:44.647 --> 02:05:51.530]  Then, scheduled later, we got Lindsey Williams popping in to take your calls and get more into how they're imploding the oil markets by design.
[02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:55.151]  In fact, John, get that clip ready from the Davos thing with George Soros.
[02:05:55.151 --> 02:05:55.952]  We haven't even played that yet.
[02:05:55.952 --> 02:05:57.252]  We've had it for weeks.
[02:05:57.252 --> 02:05:58.313]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:58.313 --> 02:06:02.955]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[02:06:02.955 --> 02:06:04.916]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[02:06:05.529 --> 02:06:08.598]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[02:06:08.598 --> 02:06:12.770]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[02:06:13.536 --> 02:06:15.638]  You know that you need to prepare.
[02:06:15.638 --> 02:06:19.041]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[02:06:19.041 --> 02:06:22.344]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.

[02:06:58.683 --> 02:07:01.464]  OrganicaSeed.com today.
[02:07:01.464 --> 02:07:02.884]  It is a big idea.
[02:07:02.884 --> 02:07:05.704]  A new world order.
[02:07:05.704 --> 02:07:10.045]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:13.411]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:07:13.411 --> 02:07:16.214]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:07:16.214 --> 02:07:19.397]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:07:19.397 --> 02:07:26.723]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:07:29.741 --> 02:07:35.185]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:07:35.185 --> 02:07:39.047]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:07:39.047 --> 02:07:41.609]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:07:41.609 --> 02:07:42.790]  Most people have no idea.
[02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:43.570]  They're not after money.
[02:07:43.570 --> 02:07:44.851]  They have all the money they need.
[02:07:44.851 --> 02:07:45.832]  They're after power.
[02:07:45.832 --> 02:07:46.973]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:07:55.678 --> 02:07:56.459]  In Game.
[02:07:56.459 --> 02:07:58.520]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:07:59.581]  You have been warned.
[02:07:59.701 --> 02:08:00.682]  Yeah.
[02:08:00.682 --> 02:08:01.582]  You worry.
[02:08:01.582 --> 02:08:03.644]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:08:03.644 --> 02:08:06.306]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:08:06.306 --> 02:08:08.428]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[02:08:08.428 --> 02:08:10.029]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:08:10.029 --> 02:08:13.631]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:08:13.631 --> 02:08:18.855]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:08:18.855 --> 02:08:22.178]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:08:22.827 --> 02:08:24.508]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:08:24.508 --> 02:08:27.408]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[02:08:27.408 --> 02:08:30.869]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:08:30.869 --> 02:08:39.512]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.

[02:08:53.743 --> 02:08:55.486]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[02:09:05.862 --> 02:09:07.163]  Big Brother.
[02:09:07.163 --> 02:09:08.945]  Mainstream media.
[02:09:08.945 --> 02:09:10.706]  Government cover-ups.
[02:09:10.706 --> 02:09:12.288]  You want answers?
[02:09:12.288 --> 02:09:13.209]  Well, so does he.
[02:09:13.209 --> 02:09:18.033]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:09:18.033 --> 02:09:22.077]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:09:24.731 --> 02:09:28.476]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:28.476 --> 02:09:36.685]  Don't forget, March 15th, the Obama deception drops at PrisonPlanet.tv and SuperhighQuality, an information warfare weapon.
[02:09:36.685 --> 02:09:39.468]  Who the bankers are, how they control things, how Obama's their puppet.
[02:09:39.748 --> 02:09:58.867]  How Bush was their puppet, how it's seamless integration for administration to administration, setting up their world government, their carbon taxes, total control, all of his lies, what his real agenda is, the FEMA camps, the forced conscription, the state's revolting, the film is done, the film's been sent off to be mass produced, we'll probably have it in the next seven days and start packaging them up to ship out on the 15th.
[02:09:58.867 --> 02:10:01.190]  Get your orders in at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:10:01.610 --> 02:10:04.031]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:10:04.031 --> 02:10:13.936]  They're betting that he can neutralize the left and the general public to stand down while they launch their New World Order so they can stage their terror attacks and start huge wars.
[02:10:13.936 --> 02:10:14.756]  They're doing it all.
[02:10:14.756 --> 02:10:15.877]  They're moving ahead.
[02:10:15.877 --> 02:10:18.918]  If we expose their agenda now, and believe me, these films have power.
[02:10:18.918 --> 02:10:24.741]  If you spread it out to everybody, make copies of the DVD, download it from PrisonPlanet.tv, spread it out to everybody.
[02:10:24.741 --> 02:10:26.822]  If you go crazy with this, it will have a big effect.
[02:10:28.100 --> 02:10:31.661]  Believe me, we have more power than a lot of you actually realize and know.
[02:10:31.661 --> 02:10:39.563]  Bob Chapman, the International Forecaster, if people just realize they can take action and defeat this thing, we can do it.
[02:10:39.563 --> 02:10:42.704]  But really, folks need to understand that, don't they?
[02:10:42.704 --> 02:10:44.224]  They certainly do.
[02:10:44.224 --> 02:10:48.405]  And your program goes a long way toward accomplishing that.
[02:10:48.405 --> 02:10:51.086]  And please, when you get these tapes, make copies.
[02:10:51.086 --> 02:10:53.807]  Send them all over the place, all over the world.
[02:10:53.807 --> 02:10:55.187]  Let people know what's going on.
[02:10:55.928 --> 02:11:01.612]  It's just like with my publication, you know, I tell people who are subscribers, if you want to send it to other people, do it.
[02:11:01.612 --> 02:11:06.615]  Some of them will subscribe because they want to get their own copy, but that's not what the mission is.
[02:11:06.615 --> 02:11:11.899]  The mission is to get the story out, to make people understand who the real enemy is.
[02:11:12.725 --> 02:11:13.666]  Absolutely, Bob.
[02:11:13.666 --> 02:11:17.108]  When I say this, I'm not putting a good face on it.
[02:11:17.108 --> 02:11:18.389]  It's the truth.
[02:11:18.389 --> 02:11:19.610]  The military's waking up.
[02:11:19.610 --> 02:11:22.492]  More contributions than Ron Paul, than to any other candidate, including the Democrat.
[02:11:22.492 --> 02:11:23.593]  I keep saying it's Republican.
[02:11:23.593 --> 02:11:25.114]  No, it's all candidates.
[02:11:25.114 --> 02:11:25.575]  They know.
[02:11:25.575 --> 02:11:27.156]  The police are waking up.
[02:11:27.156 --> 02:11:33.241]  If people become aware of stage terror, stage financial collapse, and learn this is a bunch of made-off criminals running things.
[02:11:33.241 --> 02:11:34.642]  I mean, he was the founder of the Nasdaq.
[02:11:35.222 --> 02:11:44.066]  And that all these banks are involved in this by design, and they learn how the IMF and World Bank bankrupt countries like Argentina, Iceland, and others, and now doing it here in England and Europe by design.
[02:11:44.066 --> 02:11:45.666]  We can defeat these people.
[02:11:45.666 --> 02:11:48.948]  I mean, bottom line, folks, we've got to tell the truth.
[02:11:48.948 --> 02:11:53.029]  We've got to get the story out there, because the enemy is so obviously criminal.
[02:11:53.029 --> 02:11:57.031]  If we just tell the truth, they're going to be defeated.
[02:11:57.031 --> 02:12:04.734]  And I think what, to go along with this, Alex, is the fact that we have projected on your program that the
[02:12:05.407 --> 02:12:12.310]  Economy is going to do what exactly what it has done over the past five years, you know, gone into the sewer.
[02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:19.894]  And your program and my publication and a handful of others, very few, unfortunately, have projected this.
[02:12:19.894 --> 02:12:21.715]  And we've been right all along.
[02:12:21.715 --> 02:12:27.057]  So ladies and gentlemen, the audience, please listen, because we get the handle on this.
[02:12:27.057 --> 02:12:28.718]  We know what we're talking about.
[02:12:28.718 --> 02:12:34.681]  We know that with where this is going, you've got to listen and you've got to act because
[02:12:35.462 --> 02:12:43.185]  When unemployment continues to expand, the U6 is really about 15.5% right now.
[02:12:43.185 --> 02:12:48.447]  That's a government figure, that's intermediate unemployment, and not to go into detail on it.
[02:12:48.447 --> 02:12:51.528]  And that'll be over 22% this year.
[02:12:51.528 --> 02:12:54.269]  And next year, it'll go higher.
[02:12:54.269 --> 02:13:04.553]  And as more and more people become discontented, all this information, particularly the tapes that you have, they will be put into fertile hands because people will start listening
[02:13:05.006 --> 02:13:08.990]  And saying to themselves, who did this to me?
[02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:12.553]  And we're going to tell them who and how to change things.
[02:13:12.553 --> 02:13:13.014]  That's right.
[02:13:13.014 --> 02:13:21.962]  But if we're not there, and remember, we're the people that told you 10, 15, 20, 30 years ago, as this was unfolding, America was a big country to take down, to bring into tyranny.
[02:13:21.962 --> 02:13:27.848]  But they slowly took over all the institutions, they set it up, and we always knew they'd have a financial implosion to do it.
[02:13:28.288 --> 02:13:31.729]  This is the final coup de grace, as they say.
[02:13:31.729 --> 02:13:34.911]  The globalists admit they're using this as an opportunity for their New World Order.
[02:13:34.911 --> 02:13:40.073]  We have to use this as an opportunity, like judo, as they attack us, to use their force against them.
[02:13:40.073 --> 02:13:42.254]  I want to play a video clip of George Soros a few weeks ago.
[02:13:42.254 --> 02:13:48.096]  This dovetails with what Lindsey Williams said about not just imploding other commodities in oil.
[02:13:48.096 --> 02:13:52.178]  He said this back when it was $147 a barrel, because he knows a big oil company executive he worked with.
[02:13:53.118 --> 02:13:54.298]  He said it was going to drop down below 50.
[02:13:54.298 --> 02:13:55.299]  It's gone as low as 33.
[02:13:55.299 --> 02:13:57.459]  It's right up at 40 right now.
[02:13:57.459 --> 02:14:10.803]  And he said a year and a half down the road it would go back into hyperinflation to bankrupt Russia, bankrupt Venezuela, bankrupt Canada, bankrupt the oil fields of Texas and Oklahoma.
[02:14:12.395 --> 02:14:17.181]  So they're doing this to create a depression while they hyperinflate and buy everything up.
[02:14:17.181 --> 02:14:19.544]  So let's go ahead and play that clip and get Bob Chapman's take on this.
[02:14:19.544 --> 02:14:22.507]  Here is George Soros admitting that, oh, it's okay that oil is plunging.
[02:14:22.507 --> 02:14:26.372]  This is being used basically as a weapon to bring down the Arab states and other nations.
[02:14:26.372 --> 02:14:26.713]  Here it is.
[02:14:27.318 --> 02:14:33.020]  ...had bank efforts going on in the United States, but there's so much else to be discussed here because this is, after all, the World Economic Forum.
[02:14:33.020 --> 02:14:35.561]  Let's talk for a moment about the price of oil.
[02:14:35.561 --> 02:14:39.142]  What are the implications of $40 oil, in your mind?
[02:14:39.142 --> 02:14:45.144]  Well, it's a sudden reversal of fortunes for the oil-producing countries.
[02:14:45.144 --> 02:14:53.946]  In the Gulf states, you have quite a few bubbles popping.
[02:14:53.946 --> 02:14:55.607]  Dubai was one of the
[02:14:56.127 --> 02:15:02.173]  Probably the biggest real estate bubble in the world and it's now bursting.
[02:15:02.173 --> 02:15:11.282]  However, it's not all bad news because the major oil producing countries have been the enemies of the prevailing world order.
[02:15:11.282 --> 02:15:12.783]  Venezuela, Iran,
[02:15:13.955 --> 02:15:22.421]  Russia and it's not so easy to finance a Bolivarian revolution with $40 oil.
[02:15:22.421 --> 02:15:25.943]  So I think Venezuela is Chavez.
[02:15:25.943 --> 02:15:28.185]  Probably his days are numbered.
[02:15:28.185 --> 02:15:32.328]  And in Iran, I think that is not going to last a year.
[02:15:34.328 --> 02:15:40.290]  Maybe wrong but I mean he's under considerable duress and his influence is going to decline.
[02:15:40.290 --> 02:15:48.933]  In Iran, Ahmadinejad is up for elections in 2009 and unless he can provoke some
[02:15:50.131 --> 02:16:00.379]  I think that he's liable to also be defeated and you may have a more reasonable regime.
[02:16:00.379 --> 02:16:09.427]  Now, Russia is more troubling because there, you see, Putin
[02:16:09.967 --> 02:16:29.886]  He has been using oil for a number of reasons to re-establish Russia's geopolitical influence, to enrich the rulers, to maintain themselves in power, and to bribe the rulers of the neighboring countries to gain control over their gas.
[02:16:29.886 --> 02:16:35.030]  But through the success, he was very popular.
[02:16:36.042 --> 02:16:40.163]  And not so easy now.
[02:16:40.163 --> 02:16:49.787]  Now, suddenly you have had a financial collapse, inflation, ruble falling, living standards falling.
[02:16:50.763 --> 02:17:05.851]  And there's a danger that he will be more adventurous trying to have some foreign adventure, Ukraine, whatever, to divert attention.
[02:17:05.851 --> 02:17:07.172]  I'm afraid we have to end it there.
[02:17:07.172 --> 02:17:08.672]  George Soros, I'd like to thank you very much.
[02:17:08.672 --> 02:17:10.553]  We didn't get to China, but we heard lots about Russia.
[02:17:10.553 --> 02:17:13.315]  That is George Soros, live from Davos, the World Economic Forum.
[02:17:14.878 --> 02:17:16.599]  Now understand, this is the perfect plan.
[02:17:16.599 --> 02:17:19.300]  Destroy the economy, destroy oil, consolidate everything.
[02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:23.543]  The banks hoard the bailout money given to them by every European and Western nation, including the U.S.
[02:17:23.543 --> 02:17:29.006]  and Canada, in over $20 trillion total, just $9.7 trillion here in the United States alone of our tax money.
[02:17:29.006 --> 02:17:34.349]  This is their big, massive move, and they're Soros admitting
[02:17:35.549 --> 02:17:42.093]  All of this, but then claiming that Putin's starting things, and Venezuela's starting things, and Iran is starting things.
[02:17:42.093 --> 02:17:47.295]  When Iran has terrorists from the United States and Israel, they admit, the White House admits, staging terror attacks.
[02:17:47.295 --> 02:17:51.077]  Wahhabis, actually Al-Qaeda, working with the globalists, as they always do, attacking them.
[02:17:51.077 --> 02:17:52.558]  They're taking it.
[02:17:52.558 --> 02:17:53.398]  All of this is happening.
[02:17:53.398 --> 02:17:58.000]  They staged the sneak attack on Russian-held areas in South Ossetia and Abkhazia back on 888.
[02:17:59.241 --> 02:18:04.144]  The media claimed that Russia had a snug attack, then had to admit that was a hoax.
[02:18:04.144 --> 02:18:05.644]  We can really see their move.
[02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:11.568]  And here's Soros, who implodes economies on a smaller scale to make us tens of billions in the past, through currency manipulation.
[02:18:11.568 --> 02:18:13.609]  Now he's posing like the good guy here.
[02:18:13.609 --> 02:18:16.170]  This is amazing, Bob Chapman.
[02:18:16.170 --> 02:18:17.150]  Yeah, it is.
[02:18:17.150 --> 02:18:24.594]  And it bears out what you said earlier in the program, that they're coming out into the open because they're being forced to.
[02:18:24.594 --> 02:18:27.576]  Not only by the knowledge that we're spreading throughout the world, but also
[02:18:28.924 --> 02:18:35.709]  The BRIC nations, as they're called, have pushed the Illuminists into a corner as well.
[02:18:35.709 --> 02:18:41.174]  What he says about Venezuela and Iran is true.
[02:18:41.174 --> 02:18:49.741]  In the case of Venezuela, the popularity of Mr. Chavez is down to 54% from over 60.
[02:18:49.741 --> 02:18:51.102]  And that's understandable.
[02:18:51.102 --> 02:18:54.405]  There's not as much money to go around under his regime.
[02:18:57.437 --> 02:19:10.583]  As well as in Venezuela, you have the CIA and others who are trying to undermine the governments in those countries.
[02:19:10.583 --> 02:19:25.410]  And this Stanford affair that just happened, which they're trying to keep it undercover, was a government operation which is very similar to the Australian Nugent Hand episode that went on in the, I think it was the late 80s.
[02:19:26.696 --> 02:19:32.761]  And which I won't get into here, but it was another government operation.
[02:19:32.761 --> 02:19:53.098]  And what George doesn't tell you is that he was the one who financed and organized all of these incursions into the Baltic countries, as well as Ukraine and others, with these orange and red and violet revolutions, which has caused Russia so much trouble.
[02:19:53.098 --> 02:19:54.379]  And this is
[02:19:55.231 --> 02:19:59.835]  Intelligence warfare, and he's behind a good part of it.
[02:19:59.835 --> 02:20:11.446]  So for him to come out and say what he said, which could have been said by you, Alex, or I, because that is what's happening.
[02:20:11.446 --> 02:20:16.130]  For him to have to admit that, you know that they're on their backsides.
[02:20:16.130 --> 02:20:17.471]  They're wondering, what do we do next?
[02:20:20.586 --> 02:20:26.350]  It's amazing though that, again, we told people this six months ago, and now it's at Davos two weeks ago.
[02:20:26.350 --> 02:20:30.892]  I mean, everything we tell you is what's happening, because we really know how the geopolitical system works.
[02:20:30.892 --> 02:20:32.473]  We know who the globalists are.
[02:20:32.473 --> 02:20:33.574]  We're right about this.
[02:20:33.574 --> 02:20:40.538]  Bob, I want to do five more minutes with you on the other side, because I want you to talk about these latest Ponzi schemes that are imploding, and how their intelligence operations,
[02:20:42.782 --> 02:20:52.045]  The Securities and Exchange Commission coming out and saying national security on Madoff and other issues, admitting the White House is involved in all of this, stealing your pension funds, folks.
[02:20:52.045 --> 02:21:00.328]  These are nothing but banker criminals using the intelligence agencies in the West they founded and Homeland Security to oppress the people while they thieve.
[02:21:01.394 --> 02:21:08.779]  Yourfoodstorage.com has been helping families prepare with the lowest priced, highest quality, storable food for over a decade.
[02:21:08.779 --> 02:21:13.063]  And right now, a one-year food supply that feeds 4 to 5 people is only $39.95.
[02:21:13.063 --> 02:21:18.086]  That's right, a one-year supply that feeds 4 to 5 people for under $4,000.
[02:21:18.086 --> 02:21:19.828]  That's only 92 cents per person for each meal.
[02:21:21.889 --> 02:21:22.409]  We're good to go.
[02:21:39.980 --> 02:21:44.624]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:07.651 --> 02:22:15.775]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:15.775 --> 02:22:23.939]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:23.939 --> 02:22:28.702]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:29.022 --> 02:22:34.247]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:34.247 --> 02:22:38.612]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:38.612 --> 02:22:39.693]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:39.693 --> 02:22:44.197]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:44.197 --> 02:22:45.579]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:49.082 --> 02:22:52.085]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:52.085 --> 02:22:55.990]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:55.990 --> 02:22:58.893]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:58.893 --> 02:23:07.142]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:23:07.142 --> 02:23:08.804]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:23:09.764 --> 02:23:11.326]  But who is the enemy?
[02:23:11.326 --> 02:23:12.106]  Bin Laden.
[02:23:12.106 --> 02:23:13.047]  This is his ammo.
[02:23:13.047 --> 02:23:14.489]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:23:14.489 --> 02:23:16.471]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:23:16.471 --> 02:23:23.638]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:23:23.638 --> 02:23:24.119]  Some U.S.
[02:23:24.119 --> 02:23:29.785]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:23:30.445 --> 02:23:33.948]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:23:33.948 --> 02:23:36.110]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:24:00.307 --> 02:24:03.790]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:24:03.790 --> 02:24:07.553]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:24:07.553 --> 02:24:13.877]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[02:24:13.877 --> 02:24:18.501]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:24:18.501 --> 02:24:24.526]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:24:24.526 --> 02:24:27.948]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:24:27.948 --> 02:24:29.850]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios,
[02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.590]  I think so.
[02:25:01.866 --> 02:25:07.673]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:07.673 --> 02:25:09.956]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:25:11.417 --> 02:25:13.798]  Lindsay Williams is always very punctual about interviews.
[02:25:13.798 --> 02:25:16.780]  We may have gotten a time zone wrong with him, or he may have gotten one wrong.
[02:25:16.780 --> 02:25:18.802]  We'll probably be on in the next hour, if not tomorrow.
[02:25:18.802 --> 02:25:21.923]  But we've got Bob Chapman on with us right now.
[02:25:21.923 --> 02:25:25.386]  And I wanted to get Williams on and play this Soros clips and take your calls.
[02:25:25.386 --> 02:25:27.167]  Calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:25:27.167 --> 02:25:28.708]  A bunch of other news I haven't gotten to.
[02:25:28.708 --> 02:25:35.211]  And we have another state rep from another state moving to declare sovereignty, popping in the last 15 minutes of the show today.
[02:25:35.211 --> 02:25:38.033]  Bob Chapman, it's clear that Obama is another color revolution.
[02:25:38.033 --> 02:25:40.655]  Just like the CIA and Soros on record funded
[02:25:41.015 --> 02:25:41.735]  Well, that capsulizes it.
[02:25:41.735 --> 02:25:42.396]  You're absolutely correct.
[02:25:42.396 --> 02:25:44.617]  And they're going to continue to use these artifices and devices
[02:26:10.751 --> 02:26:16.212]  To mislead the public and you know the public isn't educated in these matters.
[02:26:16.212 --> 02:26:22.254]  You know most of them once they get a job and they're going through life they don't educate themselves further.
[02:26:22.254 --> 02:26:40.238]  They would rather watch the news and watch programs on television or sporting events and so it's up to us to tell them what what is being done to them and you know how people are pulling the wool over their eyes and this color thing is is one of those artifices which they use.
[02:26:41.744 --> 02:26:48.029]  Describe for those that don't know why they call it a color revolution.
[02:26:48.029 --> 02:26:51.352]  It's just a piece of misdirection.
[02:26:51.352 --> 02:27:00.278]  It's to make people think that there's actually a popular uprising within a country.
[02:27:00.278 --> 02:27:02.980]  We'll take Ukraine as an example.
[02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:07.064]  And by putting a color on it, it changes everything.
[02:27:07.064 --> 02:27:11.387]  It allows people to follow something rather than an individual.
[02:27:12.054 --> 02:27:15.820]  Uh, following a colored movement like Purple.
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:21.970]  And, uh, and that's how they get away with what they're doing, and then they convince the people that they should change the government.
[02:27:22.598 --> 02:27:24.359]  Which they did in a number of these countries.
[02:27:24.359 --> 02:27:29.340]  So it's staged false revolutions because they know worldwide the people are in revolt.
[02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:36.643]  That's in the Pentagon, the public documents, that's in the British Ministry of Defense plans, and they admit the public is revolting against globalism.
[02:27:36.643 --> 02:27:49.647]  So every time the public revolts, the establishment goes in with a fake revolution, and that's what we've got to watch, with Glenn Beck and others now posing as our saviors, but mixing all the lies and pro-war rhetoric into the middle of it.
[02:27:49.647 --> 02:27:51.088]  You have nailed it down.
[02:27:52.501 --> 02:27:53.362]  Absolutely.
[02:27:53.362 --> 02:27:55.042]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[02:27:55.042 --> 02:28:09.149]  Go back to the 1950s and read the first books on brainwashing, which had, you know, come into publishing at that time as a result of what went on during the Korean War.
[02:28:09.149 --> 02:28:11.090]  And the fundamentals are all there.
[02:28:11.090 --> 02:28:13.692]  I mean, I studied them because I had to.
[02:28:13.692 --> 02:28:17.013]  And fortunately, I must say.
[02:28:17.013 --> 02:28:20.255]  And every place that they've started these
[02:28:21.957 --> 02:28:22.458]  I don't know.
[02:28:38.068 --> 02:28:40.509]  is to keep Russia off balance.
[02:28:40.509 --> 02:28:42.030]  Yeah, that's what the Balkans were about.
[02:28:42.030 --> 02:28:45.911]  I mean, when we take the Big Color Revolution of 1917, 1918, we're on record.
[02:28:45.911 --> 02:28:57.536]  New York and London banks publicly funded the Bolsheviks, tens of thousands of terrorists with weapons and trainloads of gold to go in and blow out the Tsars, who were, you know, not saying they're perfect.
[02:28:57.536 --> 02:29:02.939]  The point is, that was the British cousins knocking off their other cousins, the Tsars, on record.
[02:29:02.939 --> 02:29:05.059]  And, you know, they killed 40 million people.
[02:29:05.059 --> 02:29:05.940]  This is what they do.
[02:29:07.338 --> 02:29:08.498]  That's right.
[02:29:08.498 --> 02:29:09.959]  That's exactly what they do.
[02:29:09.959 --> 02:29:17.001]  You know, when the Russian established government at that time, the monarchy, was getting hit from both sides.
[02:29:17.001 --> 02:29:24.523]  They had the Germans on one side attacking them, and then they had the Red Forces against the White Army getting it from the other side.
[02:29:24.523 --> 02:29:27.504]  It was a brutal situation.
[02:29:27.504 --> 02:29:28.144]  Absolutely.
[02:29:30.049 --> 02:29:34.310]  They know what they're doing, but if the public is aware of these operations, they fall apart.
[02:29:34.310 --> 02:29:34.970]  And you're right.
[02:29:34.970 --> 02:29:45.672]  More and more, their false flag ops, their NATO options, the different systems that they've been using, are blowing up in their face.
[02:29:45.672 --> 02:29:47.713]  They are not working.
[02:29:47.713 --> 02:29:54.854]  Well, we can't let government get away with what they got away with some years ago in BCCI.
[02:29:54.854 --> 02:29:57.715]  And this is what the Stanford thing is, I believe.
[02:29:58.228 --> 02:30:08.970]  I'm only guessing at this point, but I do know that the employees that Stanford had in Venezuela were paid by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:30:08.970 --> 02:30:09.911]  I've got to stop you again.
[02:30:09.911 --> 02:30:12.991]  I know I said I was going to let you go, and I want to go to calls, but quick break.
[02:30:12.991 --> 02:30:14.292]  We'll do four more minutes on the side.
[02:30:14.292 --> 02:30:15.752]  Plug the newsletter, too.
[02:30:15.752 --> 02:30:24.194]  Because I forgot last segment, I said I wanted you to talk about that, the Madoff things, the Stanford deals, more and more of these Ponzi schemes, always with national security being declared around them.
[02:30:24.654 --> 02:30:34.217]  What is the point of all the money, you know, these business fronts where they put Wall Street money in to go infiltrate countries, including our own, and they do it by stealing police, firemen, and teachers' pension funds.
[02:30:34.217 --> 02:30:35.137]  And we'll break that down.
[02:30:35.137 --> 02:30:37.678]  Bob, you can do five more minutes?
[02:30:37.678 --> 02:30:38.798]  Anytime you want.
[02:30:38.798 --> 02:30:40.218]  All right, you're the best.
[02:30:40.218 --> 02:30:41.199]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:30:41.199 --> 02:30:42.179]  Your phone call straight ahead.
[02:30:42.179 --> 02:30:43.900]  A ton of news and a lot more.
[02:30:43.900 --> 02:30:44.400]  Stay with us.
[02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:45.340]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:30:51.627 --> 02:30:55.573]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:30:55.573 --> 02:30:58.237]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:01.414 --> 02:31:12.004]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[02:31:12.004 --> 02:31:13.425]  Garden in a Can!

[02:31:34.637 --> 02:31:35.337]  Fresh.

[02:32:00.327 --> 02:32:02.508]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:32:02.508 --> 02:32:04.910]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:32:04.910 --> 02:32:07.531]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:32:07.531 --> 02:32:08.752]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:32:08.752 --> 02:32:10.473]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[02:32:10.473 --> 02:32:13.355]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:32:13.355 --> 02:32:16.997]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:32:26.649 --> 02:32:31.442]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:32:31.442 --> 02:32:32.606]  An inside job.
[02:32:35.305 --> 02:32:37.748]  How dare you?
[02:32:37.748 --> 02:32:42.812]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:32:42.812 --> 02:32:45.715]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:32:45.715 --> 02:32:51.441]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of Donald Trump.
[02:32:51.441 --> 02:32:52.182]  Truth Rising.

[02:32:55.024 --> 02:32:57.286]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:32:57.286 --> 02:32:59.769]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:33:00.726 --> 02:33:04.250]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:33:04.250 --> 02:33:09.656]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:33:09.656 --> 02:33:14.342]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:33:15.643 --> 02:33:26.326]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[02:33:26.326 --> 02:33:32.088]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[02:33:32.088 --> 02:33:38.350]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:33:38.350 --> 02:33:39.390]  What about you?
[02:33:39.390 --> 02:33:43.391]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[02:34:05.731 --> 02:34:07.913]  You know, you've studied history.
[02:34:07.913 --> 02:34:14.838]  The Roman Empire, the Byzantines, the Chinese Empires, the Qin, the Japanese.
[02:34:14.838 --> 02:34:15.819]  Humans act the same.
[02:34:15.819 --> 02:34:17.921]  People are people.
[02:34:17.921 --> 02:34:20.583]  Africa, people are people.
[02:34:20.583 --> 02:34:28.369]  I mean, in basic villages, between villages, there's subterfuge, backstabbing, cliques, secret societies, intelligence operations.
[02:34:31.001 --> 02:34:40.204]  And they somehow told everybody, go out and play the Worlds of Wonderland, it's safe, have fun, leave your government alone, let them operate in secret under national security.
[02:34:40.204 --> 02:34:48.848]  But we got used as military slaves, we lost our freedoms, we got taxed to fund the New World Order, and now they're really getting ready to make us serfs.
[02:34:48.848 --> 02:34:50.388]  They're fully dropping the hammer.
[02:34:50.388 --> 02:34:56.971]  They're done just using us, they want to make us basically bankrupt slaves, so we have no economic power
[02:34:58.342 --> 02:35:00.827]  To have jobs, to go to college.
[02:35:00.827 --> 02:35:06.799]  The globalists constantly say they want poor, stupid serfs living in basically squalor.
[02:35:06.799 --> 02:35:08.141]  Compact city control grids.
[02:35:10.567 --> 02:35:12.328]  And it's here.
[02:35:12.328 --> 02:35:16.289]  History is nothing but empires and slaughter and death and evil people taking control.
[02:35:16.289 --> 02:35:21.651]  There's a few precious times when people of vision who love humanity have gotten in control.
[02:35:21.651 --> 02:35:25.213]  They've set up systems to tie down tyranny, to tie down government.
[02:35:25.213 --> 02:35:29.394]  And it's never been perfect, but under those systems, milk and honey flows.
[02:35:29.394 --> 02:35:31.755]  Creativity, inventiveness explodes.
[02:35:31.755 --> 02:35:33.736]  Renaissance.
[02:35:33.736 --> 02:35:38.178]  The globalists want to put us back into a post-industrial world, in their words.
[02:35:39.878 --> 02:35:40.959]  They want to control.
[02:35:40.959 --> 02:35:42.220]  That's what the carbon taxes are.
[02:35:42.220 --> 02:35:43.801]  This is hellish we're facing.
[02:35:43.801 --> 02:35:44.622]  Wake up!
[02:35:44.622 --> 02:35:45.923]  Stop being children.
[02:35:45.923 --> 02:35:47.484]  Join the fight of your life.
[02:35:47.484 --> 02:35:50.026]  We have a good chance of winning if you'll get up.
[02:35:50.026 --> 02:35:53.229]  The fake Christian churches are government-paid for.
[02:35:53.229 --> 02:35:54.170]  They tell folks, lay down.
[02:35:54.170 --> 02:35:55.010]  It's the end of the world.
[02:35:55.010 --> 02:35:56.171]  Rejoice that things are getting bad.
[02:35:56.171 --> 02:35:57.493]  Jesus will be here soon.
[02:35:57.493 --> 02:35:58.734]  It's made up, folks.
[02:35:58.734 --> 02:36:03.377]  But even if it was the end of the world next week, you have a moral duty to fight evil and corruption.
[02:36:03.377 --> 02:36:07.661]  Bob Chapman, a comment on that, and then let's get your quick take on these Ponzi schemes.
[02:36:07.661 --> 02:36:08.361]  You had said
[02:36:09.062 --> 02:36:15.026]  When the Mayo thing first broke, you had intelligence sources on air, you wrote about the newsletter, that it was a scam with the U.S.
[02:36:15.026 --> 02:36:17.467]  government and Israel fencing the money.
[02:36:17.467 --> 02:36:23.091]  Then it did start coming out in mainstream news that he had government connections, he was allowed to stay in his house, ship gold and diamonds out.
[02:36:23.091 --> 02:36:28.634]  I mean, obviously one guy didn't steal 50 to 100 million dollars by himself, they claim he ran it all himself.
[02:36:28.634 --> 02:36:30.075]  His sons have moved to Latin America.
[02:36:31.874 --> 02:36:32.374]  And you know,
[02:37:01.940 --> 02:37:10.323]  The SEC have been on my case since 1967, and they have never let up.
[02:37:10.323 --> 02:37:13.904]  And they are nothing but a criminal organization.
[02:37:13.904 --> 02:37:20.086]  And they are working with the major brokerage firms, the banks, to perpetuate profit.
[02:37:20.086 --> 02:37:23.228]  They won't even put the uptick rule back in for shorting.
[02:37:23.228 --> 02:37:25.228]  They won't even stop making shorting.
[02:37:25.228 --> 02:37:30.210]  But they've got plenty of time to go and put small brokerage houses, small brokers,
[02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:33.501]  And newsletter writers out of business.
[02:37:33.501 --> 02:37:35.742]  And so the proof is all there.
[02:37:35.742 --> 02:37:39.043]  Madoff, it took hundreds of people to pull that scam.
[02:37:39.043 --> 02:37:40.103]  Where did the money go?
[02:37:40.103 --> 02:37:40.984]  They don't want to tell you.
[02:37:40.984 --> 02:37:42.924]  It's a state secret.
[02:37:42.924 --> 02:37:51.527]  The latest is the apartment worth $7 million or $70 million or whatever it is that he is allowed to live in, if you can believe this.
[02:37:51.527 --> 02:37:55.609]  This man is a criminal, an admitted criminal.
[02:37:55.609 --> 02:37:58.690]  And it all belongs to his wife, so she should keep it.
[02:37:58.690 --> 02:37:59.550]  Give me a break.
[02:38:00.336 --> 02:38:10.665]  There's no way they're going to be able to prove that because the only way she can keep that is to prove that those things were given to her by somebody else and that is not the case.
[02:38:11.306 --> 02:38:21.012]  And do you think somebody, or a number of people, are going to go up and lie about having given her that apartment, or having given her other things?
[02:38:21.012 --> 02:38:28.757]  Look at how they're protecting him, and I don't know if you watched those hearings in Congress, I watched quite a bit of it, working on the Obama deception.
[02:38:28.757 --> 02:38:36.041]  The SEC kept defending Madoff, saying it's not proven, he's not guilty, and they're like, he's confessed!
[02:38:36.041 --> 02:38:38.383]  And they said, national security, national security.
[02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:42.822]  Well, that's the level that I operate at.
[02:38:42.822 --> 02:38:46.063]  And I'll tell you, I've nailed them time after time.
[02:38:46.063 --> 02:38:52.066]  And the CFTC, the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation, is every bit as bad.
[02:38:52.066 --> 02:38:57.588]  And they're the ones who are in the com-ex and the commodity market.
[02:38:57.588 --> 02:39:08.813]  And the rigging in the gold and silver markets, and other markets as well, you saw what they did in deleveraging by bringing down the entire commodity market, oil included.
[02:39:09.551 --> 02:39:11.413]  And look where we are now.
[02:39:11.413 --> 02:39:18.381]  And then to go along with what you were talking about, carbon taxes, go one step further.
[02:39:18.381 --> 02:39:22.906]  Massachusetts and all of the big business leaders are for this.
[02:39:22.906 --> 02:39:25.269]  A parking tax?
[02:39:25.269 --> 02:39:29.954]  They want to put a gasoline tax of 26 cents a gallon on.
[02:39:30.410 --> 02:39:34.295]  That's one of the reasons they brought gasoline down, so they could do that.
[02:39:34.295 --> 02:39:36.518]  And next they'll have a U.N.
[02:39:36.518 --> 02:39:44.608]  gasoline tax, which will fund those international... No, no, they've announced there's going to be a tax on children, a carbon tax.
[02:39:44.608 --> 02:39:45.610]  You can just Google that.
[02:39:45.610 --> 02:39:46.911]  It's all over the news how great it is.
[02:39:48.143 --> 02:39:53.185]  The very criminal bankers that have run all these scams now setting up world government where we pay our taxes to them.
[02:39:53.185 --> 02:39:53.966]  It's incredible.
[02:39:53.966 --> 02:39:56.227]  Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:39:56.227 --> 02:39:58.028]  Folks, get a free copy of it there or subscribe.
[02:39:58.028 --> 02:40:00.169]  Get it twice a week electronically.
[02:40:00.169 --> 02:40:02.630]  Or how often does the hard copy that gets mailed out go out?
[02:40:03.277 --> 02:40:06.198]  That goes out twice a month for those who are not on the internet.
[02:40:06.198 --> 02:40:09.298]  Alright, so TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:40:09.298 --> 02:40:11.899]  Bob Chapman, we'll talk to you again on Friday.
[02:40:11.899 --> 02:40:14.720]  So much is happening that we'll need you back on again.
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:15.420]  Thank you so much.
[02:40:15.420 --> 02:40:20.821]  Your knowledge and foresight and understanding of this is invaluable and you continue to be proven absolutely dead on.
[02:40:20.821 --> 02:40:22.202]  God bless you.
[02:40:22.202 --> 02:40:23.262]  Thank you very much.
[02:40:23.262 --> 02:40:23.562]  Bye-bye.
[02:40:24.028 --> 02:40:24.168]  Hello?
[02:40:44.108 --> 02:40:45.209]  Hi, what's going on?
[02:40:45.209 --> 02:40:48.872]  A long time listener, big fan, you're one of my heroes, just want to get that out.
[02:40:48.872 --> 02:40:53.095]  I know you're probably pressed for time, so I'll just get right into the issue.
[02:40:53.095 --> 02:40:59.080]  From Wisconsin, as far as I can tell, my state is not part of the state sovereignty movement.
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:01.382]  We've really got to push for that.
[02:41:01.382 --> 02:41:08.187]  Right in front of me I have the number, if I can give it out, for Senator Russ Feingold's office, area code 202.
[02:41:08.187 --> 02:41:11.830]  Hold on, wouldn't you want to call the state legislature instead of the federal senator?
[02:41:13.939 --> 02:41:15.160]  Ah, you may be right.
[02:41:15.160 --> 02:41:18.322]  That's the only number I was able to get with his Washington office.
[02:41:18.322 --> 02:41:20.024]  I do have the local offices.
[02:41:20.024 --> 02:41:21.625]  But see, he's a federal senator.
[02:41:21.625 --> 02:41:23.206]  They want federal control.
[02:41:23.206 --> 02:41:25.647]  You want to call the legislature.
[02:41:25.647 --> 02:41:28.389]  The state government.
[02:41:28.389 --> 02:41:30.030]  Ah, I gotcha.
[02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:32.152]  I mean, go ahead and give Feingold's number out if you want.
[02:41:32.152 --> 02:41:33.613]  I mean, go ahead.
[02:41:33.613 --> 02:41:35.394]  Alright, that number is area code 202-224-5323.
[02:41:41.556 --> 02:41:47.680]  What would your suggestion be then as far as webpages to pull up for local representatives?
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:48.040]  Good day, Alex.
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:48.600]  How are you?
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:48.760]  Good.
[02:42:10.366 --> 02:42:17.488]  Just to let you know, you're talking about this Glenn Beck TV fiasco, I guess.
[02:42:17.488 --> 02:42:26.111]  Just to let the listeners know, I just sent the gentleman an email, and I just suggest that the listeners do the same.
[02:42:32.441 --> 02:42:34.363]  What you think I guess is what I'm trying to say.
[02:42:52.222 --> 02:43:00.949]  Well, I'm just saying that the listeners, to give him a good email barrage, I have his email address if you want it, and people, if they want to send something to him, let me know what you think.
[02:43:20.482 --> 02:43:20.742]  I don't
[02:43:41.028 --> 02:44:10.331]  uh... uh... accurate investigation before he goes out there and you know starts talking like he has been and i'm just saying to the listeners to give him an email barrage and let him know that you know people are watching that's all absolutely well that's what he wants is the hype from this the reason we're covering it like when Lou Dobbs conservatively in a focused manner covers and tells the truth we support him it's amazing uh... you know we're there but when Glenn Beck if you listen to him he says maybe FEMA camps are good
[02:44:10.831 --> 02:44:11.732]  I don't know if they're real.
[02:44:11.732 --> 02:44:12.693]  Ooh, conspiracy theories.
[02:44:12.693 --> 02:44:15.457]  He's making jokes about it while acting like he's against it.
[02:44:15.457 --> 02:44:18.961]  This is the guy that said put 9-11 truthers in jail.
[02:44:18.961 --> 02:44:20.703]  This is the guy that said use the army against us.
[02:44:20.703 --> 02:44:21.825]  We're a bunch of McVeys.
[02:44:21.825 --> 02:44:23.988]  This is the guy that says he's worried about Bubba's and their guns.
[02:44:23.988 --> 02:44:25.690]  I mean, you could just watch it.
[02:44:25.690 --> 02:44:26.651]  It's double-speak.
[02:44:26.651 --> 02:44:28.033]  My gosh, it's so obvious.
[02:44:28.968 --> 02:44:36.752]  Alex, before I send him off, a comment that I had, and like I said, it was nothing crude or anything, but just telling the gentleman to get his facts straight.
[02:44:36.752 --> 02:44:38.093]  No, no, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[02:44:38.093 --> 02:44:47.937]  Just for anybody with his resources, with a radio-producing crew, and a Fox News crew, saying he's looking into it, he doesn't know if it's true or not, or maybe it is, or maybe it's a good thing.
[02:44:47.937 --> 02:44:51.899]  I mean, come on, we know this is a long-term plan, we've laid out all the evidence.
[02:44:51.899 --> 02:44:52.440]  Let's talk to
[02:44:54.258 --> 02:44:55.699]  Evie, you're Eve in Illinois.
[02:44:55.699 --> 02:44:56.239]  You're on the air.
[02:44:56.239 --> 02:44:56.639]  Go ahead.
[02:44:56.639 --> 02:44:58.740]  Hi, Glenn.
[02:44:58.740 --> 02:45:00.561]  I've only been listening to you for about a week.
[02:45:00.561 --> 02:45:01.261]  This is Glenn Beck.
[02:45:01.261 --> 02:45:01.982]  Sorry, Glenn.
[02:45:01.982 --> 02:45:03.182]  We were just talking about Glenn.
[02:45:03.182 --> 02:45:03.963]  Sorry, Alex.
[02:45:03.963 --> 02:45:04.403]  No, it's okay.
[02:45:04.403 --> 02:45:04.823]  Go ahead.
[02:45:04.823 --> 02:45:05.903]  I'm a little nervous.
[02:45:05.903 --> 02:45:08.585]  I'm a police officer and my husband's a police officer.
[02:45:08.585 --> 02:45:15.128]  I've only been listening to you for about a week, but my mom and dad have listened to your show and they've been talking to us about it.
[02:45:15.128 --> 02:45:21.791]  And my husband just recently was offered an opportunity to join a group called the
[02:45:22.592 --> 02:45:23.773]  Mobile Field Force.
[02:45:23.773 --> 02:45:35.558]  What it is, is every department in Illinois is sectioned off into like North, South, East, and West, and they take so many officers from that department to go and train two and three times a month.
[02:45:35.558 --> 02:45:40.081]  Now, I find it a little odd because they really don't know exactly what they're training for.
[02:45:40.081 --> 02:45:47.844]  They try to play it off like it's after what happened in Louisiana when a, you know, crisis comes up or a natural disaster.
[02:45:47.844 --> 02:45:49.325]  They want to be able to have these officers
[02:45:49.588 --> 02:45:51.269]  Yeah, we've had a male officer.
[02:45:51.269 --> 02:45:51.949]  Officer, stay there.
[02:45:51.949 --> 02:45:53.450]  I mean, I hear your radios beeping.
[02:45:53.450 --> 02:45:55.811]  Do you need to take that real fast and we'll come back to you?
[02:45:55.811 --> 02:45:57.351]  No, I'm good.
[02:45:57.351 --> 02:45:58.592]  Okay.
[02:45:58.592 --> 02:46:02.093]  We share with another department, so that was just another department talking.
[02:46:02.093 --> 02:46:09.756]  But they train, and from what my husband tells me, the training that they do is very militaristic, you know, in scope.
[02:46:09.756 --> 02:46:13.718]  And I just, he's a little, you know, I don't know if I believe all that, but
[02:46:14.665 --> 02:46:20.409]  I know you're talking too that you think that there's going to be another terror attack and it's probably going to be, you know, in the schools or in a mall.
[02:46:20.409 --> 02:46:23.570]  And I also work part-time at a high school as a security guard.
[02:46:23.570 --> 02:46:30.174]  And after Columbine, I thought for sure we would, you know, do a lot of drills and things like that just to make sure we're kind of up to snuff in our security.
[02:46:30.174 --> 02:46:32.656]  And we've done nothing until the last year and a half.
[02:46:33.157 --> 02:46:40.725]  And we started intensifying and doing all these drills and doing all these scenarios and I just find it a little odd.
[02:46:40.725 --> 02:46:48.132]  Officer, let me tell you, go to YouTube, go to Google, watch Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:46:48.132 --> 02:46:50.595]  You will witness troops trying to take our guns.
[02:46:50.595 --> 02:46:54.139]  Earlier in the show, in the second hour, I spent
[02:46:55.578 --> 02:46:58.760]  Almost all the segments, 50 minutes, going over all the documentation.
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:00.321]  There are real camps.
[02:47:00.321 --> 02:47:02.043]  People are already in them.
[02:47:02.043 --> 02:47:03.564]  They take police.
[02:47:03.564 --> 02:47:05.846]  You're really under federal control.
[02:47:05.846 --> 02:47:07.967]  The training's reasonable at first.
[02:47:07.967 --> 02:47:09.348]  You know, chemical or bio attack.
[02:47:09.348 --> 02:47:14.852]  And then the next training is door-to-door gun confiscation, coordinating neighborhoods.
[02:47:14.852 --> 02:47:16.133]  Then you'll be training with the military.
[02:47:16.133 --> 02:47:17.754]  They're watching your husband.
[02:47:17.754 --> 02:47:19.295]  They're studying if he goes along with it.
[02:47:19.295 --> 02:47:20.957]  They're studying if he understands.
[02:47:20.957 --> 02:47:22.538]  They're sifting through the police.
[02:47:23.098 --> 02:47:26.481]  To find these devilish jackboot cadres.
[02:47:26.481 --> 02:47:34.987]  The Illinois governor announced four months ago, Blagojevich, former governor, on the news that we're going to use the National Guard in neighborhood gun sweeps.
[02:47:34.987 --> 02:47:38.810]  They're doing drills everywhere where the military comes and says, let us search your neighborhood for guns.
[02:47:38.810 --> 02:47:40.151]  It's just a drill.
[02:47:40.151 --> 02:47:42.993]  Northcom has announced they're going to use the military against the people.
[02:47:42.993 --> 02:47:43.673]  So, yes.
[02:47:44.554 --> 02:47:52.860]  Yes, and I'm aware of those teams, the Mobile Field Forces, everywhere they have these federally funded positions in the departments.
[02:47:52.860 --> 02:47:54.321]  That's what this is.
[02:47:54.321 --> 02:48:01.406]  We've had emergency managers from Indiana and other places on where they are gearing up for mass graves for martial law.
[02:48:01.406 --> 02:48:08.651]  So, specifically, any other points you've got or what is the training like that he's a little concerned about?
[02:48:10.623 --> 02:48:30.936]  The exercises we had to do, and I actually got to go do it with them, was we had to, um, like there was a biological attack and we had to escort a truck to the area in Joliet and we had to get these antidotes only enough for our department and our departmental family members.
[02:48:30.936 --> 02:48:39.061]  We had to provide guard duty for the truck as it came to town in case it was ambushed by people, you know, obviously that wanted the antidote for their families and I just
[02:48:39.833 --> 02:48:43.075]  I really am to the point to where I don't want to be an officer anymore.
[02:48:43.075 --> 02:48:46.758]  I've been an officer for 12 years, my husband 15, my dad's a retired officer.
[02:48:46.758 --> 02:48:52.722]  I just, you know, part of me wants to stay in and try to, you know, kind of keep my head in the door.
[02:48:52.722 --> 02:48:54.023]  No, no, I think it's good.
[02:48:54.023 --> 02:48:58.706]  I think it's good, but in the time we have, listen to me very carefully, officer.
[02:48:58.706 --> 02:49:02.508]  You notice I told you your first training would be biological weapons release, correct?
[02:49:02.508 --> 02:49:03.389]  Yes, and that's what it was.
[02:49:03.775 --> 02:49:05.456]  Okay, now let me explain something.
[02:49:05.456 --> 02:49:11.560]  Did you hear five years ago when they said all the police and first responders had to take the smallpox shot and they refused?
[02:49:11.560 --> 02:49:13.441]  I'm sure you remember that or heard about that.
[02:49:13.441 --> 02:49:14.141]  Yes.
[02:49:14.141 --> 02:49:16.703]  How do they make you want it now?
[02:49:16.703 --> 02:49:27.409]  If you're doing dog training, and humans are very similar to dogs, the New World Order brags in manuals that they train us like dogs, you act like you don't want the dog to have the chew toy.
[02:49:27.409 --> 02:49:29.910]  You want it to come after the chew toy.
[02:49:29.910 --> 02:49:31.011]  The chew toy is really poison.
[02:49:32.142 --> 02:49:39.728]  So, all over, they have them practice guarding these shots, and you watch what will happen with your husband, like it's some gold.
[02:49:39.728 --> 02:49:52.418]  That's to condition him to want to take the shots, and to think of it as precious and wonderful, because they have to make the first responders take the forced inoculations first, so they will then force it on the public.
[02:49:52.418 --> 02:49:54.580]  And this has come out, we beat this five years ago.
[02:49:55.180 --> 02:50:13.616]  So, then the next training down the road, or maybe three layers in, will be going and putting people on trucks and buses to take them to a sports stadium, and they will have the role players, generally played by their officers in the first phase, saying, I want that shot, and practicing attacking police because they want the shot.
[02:50:13.616 --> 02:50:21.742]  Now, in reality, the public's not going to want the shot, and then that way the officers feel like it's a shot they want, it's a shot the public's going to want, this is something precious.
[02:50:22.583 --> 02:50:23.443]  You understand?
[02:50:23.443 --> 02:50:25.564]  So this is psych warfare conditioning.
[02:50:25.564 --> 02:50:27.144]  Do you like being manipulated like that?
[02:50:27.144 --> 02:50:30.705]  Because they think you're stupid, and I don't think you're stupid.
[02:50:30.705 --> 02:50:31.685]  No, no.
[02:50:31.685 --> 02:50:43.608]  My dad, he's been telling me the same things that you've been saying, because he's a Vietnam veteran, and he goes to the VA clinic and suffers insurance, and he's like, I won't take any shots that they try to give me.
[02:50:44.238 --> 02:50:48.724]  I refuse them, I don't want them, because he thinks, you know, that there's something in which there is.
[02:50:48.724 --> 02:50:52.088]  Officer, Google cancer viruses and vaccines.
[02:50:52.088 --> 02:50:54.170]  You'll be mainstream news.
[02:50:54.170 --> 02:50:58.255]  Over 200 million Americans were injected with SV40 and they still put it in there.
[02:50:58.255 --> 02:50:58.396]  SV40.
[02:51:00.225 --> 02:51:01.066]  It's deadly!
[02:51:01.066 --> 02:51:02.567]  Most cancer is viral.
[02:51:02.567 --> 02:51:04.108]  They discovered this over a hundred years ago.
[02:51:04.108 --> 02:51:07.471]  I've had top scientists on, mainline doctors.
[02:51:07.471 --> 02:51:08.832]  They found out it's viral.
[02:51:08.832 --> 02:51:17.980]  They implant all of us with time-delayed DNA recombinant cancer viruses that activate around retirement.
[02:51:17.980 --> 02:51:18.220]  Yeah.
[02:51:18.220 --> 02:51:20.181]  Because they don't want to pay you social spam.
[02:51:20.181 --> 02:51:21.282]  It's eugenics.
[02:51:21.282 --> 02:51:22.083]  Please look.
[02:51:22.083 --> 02:51:22.724]  Have you heard about it?
[02:51:22.724 --> 02:51:23.264]  Oh, I believe you.
[02:51:23.264 --> 02:51:25.306]  I totally believe you.
[02:51:25.306 --> 02:51:29.209]  I'm trying to wake other officers up to this, you know, and let them know that
[02:51:29.608 --> 02:51:42.411]  That's what's going on, you know, they, they, like you said, are just lulled into this dream state, like, oh, we're, we're the good guys, we're fighting the bad guys, but I try to let them know I think they're going to try to make us be the bad guys, and I'm not going to go along with that.
[02:51:42.411 --> 02:51:45.492]  I'll die before I go in and I try to make another citizen of God.
[02:51:45.492 --> 02:51:46.312]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:51:46.312 --> 02:51:47.313]  You know, this is incredible.
[02:51:47.313 --> 02:51:50.793]  We got Lindsey Williams, but I'm just going to have to come back to you.
[02:51:50.793 --> 02:51:51.994]  Can we come back to you for a second?
[02:51:51.994 --> 02:51:52.774]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:51:53.214 --> 02:51:53.995]  Alright, good.
[02:51:53.995 --> 02:51:55.776]  Folks, police, don't laugh at me.
[02:51:55.776 --> 02:51:57.597]  They're injecting us all with cancer.
[02:51:57.597 --> 02:51:59.939]  Please, check it out for your own family and your own sake.
[02:52:01.511 --> 02:52:03.673]  Is your credit card debt out of control?
[02:52:03.673 --> 02:52:06.455]  Are you in over your head dealing with monthly payments?
[02:52:06.455 --> 02:52:10.297]  There's a powerful secret that credit card companies don't want you to know.
[02:52:10.297 --> 02:52:17.422]  If you have credit card debt, you have the power to settle that debt for a fraction of what you owe, cutting your payments by up to half or more.
[02:52:17.422 --> 02:52:28.570]  That's bad news for credit card companies, but it's great news for you, and we'd like to offer you free information that will show you how to settle your credit card debt and lower your payments by up to half or more.
[02:52:28.570 --> 02:52:29.991]  It's yours free when you call
[02:52:29.991 --> 02:52:30.251]  All right.
[02:52:40.026 --> 02:52:40.647]  We're good to go.
[02:53:01.465 --> 02:53:08.207]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:53:08.207 --> 02:53:10.848]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:53:10.848 --> 02:53:12.388]  But who is the enemy?
[02:53:12.388 --> 02:53:13.209]  Bin Laden.
[02:53:13.209 --> 02:53:14.129]  This is his ammo.
[02:53:14.129 --> 02:53:15.569]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:53:15.569 --> 02:53:17.550]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:53:17.550 --> 02:53:24.692]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:53:24.692 --> 02:53:25.192]  Some U.S.
[02:53:25.192 --> 02:53:30.834]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:53:31.534 --> 02:53:35.036]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:53:35.036 --> 02:53:37.837]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:54:01.934 --> 02:54:10.000]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:11.602]  You need the Paclite!
[02:54:11.602 --> 02:54:19.848]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[02:54:19.848 --> 02:54:23.391]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[02:54:23.391 --> 02:54:28.235]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[02:54:28.235 --> 02:54:29.496]  The Paclite is so durable,
[02:54:29.756 --> 02:54:34.581]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[02:54:34.581 --> 02:54:39.246]  The Paclite comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[02:54:39.246 --> 02:54:46.254]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlite.com.
[02:54:46.254 --> 02:54:48.816]  That address again is 9voltlite.com.
[02:54:49.797 --> 02:54:51.358]  Or call us today at 877-715-4448.
[02:54:51.358 --> 02:54:51.698]  That's 877-715-4448.
[02:54:51.698 --> 02:54:54.899]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:55:11.570 --> 02:55:13.192]  Listen to me, folks.
[02:55:13.192 --> 02:55:17.497]  I know it's hard to believe they put cancer viruses in the vaccines and mercury.
[02:55:17.497 --> 02:55:19.419]  It's on record they do.
[02:55:19.419 --> 02:55:20.620]  All you've got to do is Google it.
[02:55:20.620 --> 02:55:22.442]  Mainstream news, government documents.
[02:55:22.442 --> 02:55:24.945]  They've caught the UN sterilizing women.
[02:55:24.945 --> 02:55:26.167]  That's mainstream news.
[02:55:26.167 --> 02:55:29.170]  Adding a key pathogen that combines with the tetanus shot.
[02:55:30.111 --> 02:55:36.297]  For an autoimmune response that destroys the key sexual organs and their fertility.
[02:55:36.297 --> 02:55:37.238]  It's eugenics.
[02:55:37.238 --> 02:55:38.419]  Everything is eugenics.
[02:55:38.419 --> 02:55:40.100]  Hitler got his ideas from the U.S.
[02:55:40.100 --> 02:55:40.561]  and England.
[02:55:40.561 --> 02:55:43.544]  The scientific community basically all believe this.
[02:55:43.544 --> 02:55:45.726]  My film, Endgame, covers it.
[02:55:45.726 --> 02:55:48.068]  I had to get past my fear when I read these documents.
[02:55:48.068 --> 02:55:49.309]  I mean, it is bracing.
[02:55:49.309 --> 02:55:50.090]  It is shaking.
[02:55:52.128 --> 02:56:02.440]  There have been times years ago, I don't really do it anymore, where I would just sit down in the night and couldn't even cry, but tears would just, you know, like I wasn't retching, but tears would just start pouring out.
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:04.743]  I mean, it is, and I have to face them.
[02:56:04.743 --> 02:56:06.105]  I have to go up against these people.
[02:56:07.245 --> 02:56:13.368]  I have to, because, you know, I know they've killed so many, set so many up, because we can't let them keep doing this.
[02:56:13.368 --> 02:56:13.889]  It's real.
[02:56:13.889 --> 02:56:15.410]  Lindsey Williams is coming up in five minutes.
[02:56:15.410 --> 02:56:18.491]  He'll be with us for 45 minutes, and I have a state rep popping in for ten.
[02:56:18.491 --> 02:56:21.253]  And I'm going to get Lindsey back on again very, very soon.
[02:56:21.253 --> 02:56:22.554]  We appreciate Lindsey Williams being there.
[02:56:22.554 --> 02:56:25.755]  Everything he's been saying has been proven to be documented and triplicate.
[02:56:25.755 --> 02:56:28.357]  But, officer, is it an Evie or an Eve?
[02:56:29.818 --> 02:56:42.908]  Evie, anything else as an officer in Illinois that, I mean, you're concerned, you're trying to reach out to other officers, are you scared to?
[02:56:42.908 --> 02:56:44.189]  What's happening?
[02:56:44.189 --> 02:56:55.857]  Well, I mean, obviously I'm a little scared because, you know, they don't want you to, you know, be informed of what's going on, but yeah, I really just want officers to do like what you said, go on YouTube, you know, Google these things and look into it.
[02:56:55.857 --> 02:56:58.319]  I mean, like I've been telling my husband,
[02:56:58.649 --> 02:57:00.171]  You don't have to take anyone's word for it.
[02:57:00.171 --> 02:57:06.037]  You can see it on paper, you know, in print from the news that you rely on for all your other information, you know.
[02:57:06.037 --> 02:57:11.222]  And, you know, he's been looking into it and, you know, I think he's coming around.
[02:57:11.222 --> 02:57:21.733]  I just think his problem is that he's wanted to be a police officer his whole life and, you know, he's kind of, you know, disappointed and shocked and sad that it's going to come to this and he's probably going to have to, you know, give it up.
[02:57:22.799 --> 02:57:29.502]  You know, on the other hand, we have two children, so that really comes before anything, and I want my freedom.
[02:57:29.502 --> 02:57:30.183]  What do you mean?
[02:57:30.183 --> 02:57:34.205]  I'm from the South, and I think that everyone should be able to carry a gun.
[02:57:34.205 --> 02:57:37.246]  I believe in concealed carry, and I support it.
[02:57:37.246 --> 02:57:39.067]  I'm an officer, and I support it.
[02:57:39.067 --> 02:57:41.709]  I totally agree with you when you talk about Chicago.
[02:57:41.709 --> 02:57:42.789]  Look at what goes on there.
[02:57:42.789 --> 02:57:48.072]  I mean, I have a lot of friends that are in Chicago that are officers, and they think
[02:57:48.933 --> 02:57:53.436]  These people knew that the citizen that they were coming on to try to do something to might be armed.
[02:57:53.436 --> 02:57:54.918]  Maybe they might stop and not do it.
[02:57:54.918 --> 02:57:57.780]  Or, you know, maybe they think twice about it or get blown away.
[02:57:57.780 --> 02:58:03.744]  Well, Evie, they've done polls of officers nationwide and upwards of 97% are pro-Second Amendment.
[02:58:03.744 --> 02:58:05.126]  They're good people.
[02:58:05.126 --> 02:58:07.828]  But it's the police chiefs that are bought and paid for by the globalists now.
[02:58:09.355 --> 02:58:12.317]  This is another example of what I'm talking about, a microcosm of it.
[02:58:39.275 --> 02:58:40.336]  No.
[02:58:40.336 --> 02:58:44.000]  No, this is the first time I tried to call.
[02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.202]  I was really shocked I got through.
[02:58:46.202 --> 02:58:49.185]  I have all these police and military that email me saying they can never get through.
[02:58:49.185 --> 02:58:50.126]  I'm glad you got through.
[02:58:50.126 --> 02:58:57.273]  We're going to start having some days where only police and military can call in so they can get in and give us the intel and tell us what they're seeing and what's happening.
[02:58:57.273 --> 02:59:01.137]  I don't think it's his decision that your husband needs to leave the force.
[02:59:01.858 --> 02:59:08.062]  He needs to, within the law, within the Constitution, read that, follow that, and start speaking out against it.
[02:59:08.062 --> 02:59:12.045]  You know, start talking about it, or covertly, you know, expose what's happening.
[02:59:12.045 --> 02:59:22.572]  He can choose the way... I mean, see, as good people find out about the evil, they all leave the military and police, and they hire the illegal aliens, the felons, you know, the foreigners, to fill up the ranks, so...
[02:59:23.152 --> 02:59:26.374]  It's a catch-22, but you don't need to leave.
[02:59:26.374 --> 02:59:28.155]  I mean, you're on the ground.
[02:59:28.155 --> 02:59:30.697]  You know better than I. You just need to gauge what's happening.
[02:59:30.697 --> 02:59:31.397]  God bless you.
[02:59:31.397 --> 02:59:32.718]  Good to have you on with us, Evie, okay?
[02:59:32.718 --> 02:59:33.798]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:59:33.798 --> 02:59:34.839]  I appreciate it.
[02:59:34.839 --> 02:59:35.379]  God bless you.
[02:59:35.379 --> 02:59:35.719]  Take care.
[02:59:35.719 --> 02:59:38.681]  That's a good peace officer, a guardian of the people.
[02:59:38.681 --> 02:59:46.126]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:59:46.126 --> 02:59:48.067]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:59:51.271 --> 02:59:52.952]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:59:52.952 --> 02:59:57.695]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:59:57.695 --> 03:00:00.656]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:00:00.656 --> 03:00:03.698]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:00:03.698 --> 03:00:08.421]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:00:08.581 --> 03:00:08.821]  We're good.
[03:00:28.436 --> 03:00:34.703]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[03:00:34.703 --> 03:00:38.488]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.

[03:00:39.829 --> 03:00:40.450]  Take action today.
[03:00:40.450 --> 03:00:42.432]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:00:54.045 --> 03:00:56.446]  Waging War on Corruption.
[03:00:56.446 --> 03:00:59.228]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:01:16.528 --> 03:01:20.552]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are here, back live for the next 45 minutes.
[03:01:20.552 --> 03:01:21.332]  Lindsey Williams joins us.
[03:01:21.332 --> 03:01:25.176]  We have a state rep popping in, another state declaring sovereignty that's going to be joining us.
[03:01:25.176 --> 03:01:28.779]  George Soros at the World Economic Forum a few weeks ago.
[03:01:28.779 --> 03:01:29.800]  The video just surfaced.
[03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:31.041]  It was on international television.
[03:01:31.041 --> 03:01:32.322]  We just found it last week.
[03:01:34.097 --> 03:01:41.402]  Yes, we're staging the, you know, oil implosion price to bring down Venezuela, bring down Russia, bring down the Arabs.
[03:01:41.402 --> 03:01:44.484]  They're also imploding the markets so they can consolidate it.
[03:01:44.484 --> 03:01:55.351]  Everything that we separately had from our infiltration of Bilderberg in 2006, laying on everything that was going to happen, integrates with his oil company executive he worked with for many years, telling him about this.
[03:01:55.351 --> 03:01:57.913]  He predicted when fuel was at $148, $149 a barrel, it would drop below $50.
[03:01:57.913 --> 03:01:58.954]  It's gone as low as $33 a barrel.
[03:01:58.954 --> 03:01:59.474]  It's at about $40 right now.
[03:02:04.017 --> 03:02:08.338]  Again, to bankrupt all these oil-rich nations and bring in a worldwide depression.
[03:02:08.338 --> 03:02:13.440]  Lindsey Williams, it is a great honor to have you back on with us, and we appreciate you spending time with us today.
[03:02:13.440 --> 03:02:16.861]  Thank you, Alex, so much for letting me be with you today for an update.
[03:02:16.861 --> 03:02:30.645]  You know, even though I lived with the elite of the world for three years' time, I still sit back, utterly dumbfounded and amazed how these people have the power to do exactly what they're going to do, say they're going to do, and do it.
[03:02:31.806 --> 03:02:37.650]  And do it meticulously, exactly like they said they were going to.
[03:02:37.650 --> 03:02:41.593]  And, you know, Missouri is the show-me state, or put-up-and-shut-up.
[03:02:41.593 --> 03:02:54.421]  Everything you've told us over the years has all turned out exactly as you said, because you wrote a book twenty-something years ago, you work with these people, you still know them, just like we can infiltrate Bilderberg and find out exactly what's going to happen, because the globalists rule
[03:02:55.558 --> 03:02:57.379]  And they're bringing us into a worldwide depression.
[03:02:57.379 --> 03:03:02.721]  Recap what he told you, then let's get into why would Soros come out and admit everything you said.
[03:03:02.721 --> 03:03:05.862]  Well, approximately seven months ago, I had a phone call.
[03:03:05.862 --> 03:03:12.065]  The phone call was for the purpose of telling me, you've said too much, either be quiet, or we're going to take action.
[03:03:12.065 --> 03:03:16.287]  And the action that they gave me and the choice they gave me wasn't too pleasant.
[03:03:16.287 --> 03:03:21.569]  So I agreed with what he said, pulled my website, withdrew my DVD,
[03:03:22.233 --> 03:03:24.794]  Change everything around, but that's not the important part.
[03:03:24.794 --> 03:03:26.535]  The important part was after that.
[03:03:26.535 --> 03:03:28.495]  I had not seen this man for 25 years.
[03:03:28.495 --> 03:03:29.276]  I know who he is.
[03:03:29.276 --> 03:03:31.236]  He's 82 years of age now.
[03:03:31.236 --> 03:03:35.978]  He knows everything that the elite are doing and everything that goes on behind closed doors.
[03:03:35.978 --> 03:03:37.879]  So I decided to be friendly.
[03:03:37.879 --> 03:03:41.780]  I asked him how your family, how you've been doing, where you've been living.
[03:03:41.780 --> 03:03:47.482]  Uh, he, he, he really, I was amazed how kind and nice he became all of a sudden.
[03:03:47.998 --> 03:03:55.980]  And for the next 45 minutes time, he told me everything that the elite plan to do on the face of the earth over the next year to a year and a half.
[03:03:55.980 --> 03:04:06.762]  And at that time, crude oil was $147 a barrel, and nobody would have ever, in the foggiest imagination, would have guessed that it was going to $50 a barrel.
[03:04:06.762 --> 03:04:10.403]  Oh, definitely not to $33 a barrel, which has been its low.
[03:04:10.403 --> 03:04:13.883]  He said, crude oil's going to $250 a barrel.
[03:04:13.883 --> 03:04:15.044]  I was dumbfounded.
[03:04:15.044 --> 03:04:16.584]  Immediately, I asked him, I said,
[03:04:17.057 --> 03:04:18.619]  Why are you doing this?
[03:04:18.619 --> 03:04:21.822]  He was as bold as the day was long ago.
[03:04:21.822 --> 03:04:30.049]  There again, Alex, nobody would have guessed that the OPEC oil producing countries of the world would have ever gone bankrupt.
[03:04:30.049 --> 03:04:32.832]  I mean, this was unthinkable.
[03:04:32.832 --> 03:04:33.793]  But it has.
[03:04:33.793 --> 03:04:39.298]  They are on the verge of bankruptcy right now, and they say that unless they can get crude oil back up to above $80 a barrel,
[03:04:40.632 --> 03:04:42.814]  That they're going to have major financial problems.
[03:04:42.814 --> 03:04:45.817]  They've stopped buying our T-Bills, our Treasury Bills.
[03:04:45.817 --> 03:04:48.920]  As a result, the dollar is in drastic trouble.
[03:04:48.920 --> 03:04:51.623]  The average American has not the slightest idea.
[03:04:51.623 --> 03:04:57.989]  Well, then he went on to say that the price of gasoline is going to $1.50 to $2 a gallon for a gas pump.
[03:04:57.989 --> 03:05:00.332]  But then, he said it's going to stay there.
[03:05:00.332 --> 03:05:03.555]  And I gathered a year to a year and a half to keep it there.
[03:05:04.013 --> 03:05:06.095]  In order to accomplish what they want to accomplish.
[03:05:06.095 --> 03:05:07.116]  Now, let me show you.
[03:05:07.116 --> 03:05:08.737]  I'm going to begin if I may.
[03:05:08.737 --> 03:05:12.701]  I'll make this update as fast as I can because we've only got 45 minutes.
[03:05:12.701 --> 03:05:14.802]  So forgive me if I talk fast.
[03:05:14.802 --> 03:05:19.066]  But there's so much happened since I was with you a week, a week and a half ago, Alex.
[03:05:19.066 --> 03:05:20.908]  Until I'm going to get in everything I can.
[03:05:20.908 --> 03:05:23.850]  And thank you so much for letting me be with you.
[03:05:23.850 --> 03:05:27.954]  And the last few moments, I'm going to give what's happening to the farmers of America.
[03:05:28.317 --> 03:05:31.559]  And if nothing else bothers you, this one's going to wake you up.
[03:05:31.559 --> 03:05:34.380]  So you better have your pencil and paper handy because here we go.
[03:05:44.506 --> 03:05:48.831]  ...at the public Bilderberg Group meeting, the Davos Switzerland World Economic Forum.
[03:05:48.831 --> 03:05:50.493]  He's Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[03:05:50.493 --> 03:06:01.225]  This is inside Bilderberg Group, New World Order level intelligence, directly laying out the future with 100% precision accuracy.
[03:06:02.028 --> 03:06:02.969]  Detoxify.
[03:06:02.969 --> 03:06:07.573]  You are constantly reminded how important detoxify is to cleanse your body of dangerous toxins.
[03:06:07.573 --> 03:06:13.558]  You are also being reminded that it's important to detoxify safely and not all products will provide safe and effective results.
[03:06:13.558 --> 03:06:17.461]  It's time to clear the air and clear your body with safe and effective Keelermax.
[03:06:17.461 --> 03:06:22.425]  With the help of Nutriodine, Keelermax will help your body to remove heavy metals, toxins and chemicals.
[03:06:22.585 --> 03:06:28.287]  The liquid zeolite formula, Humic, helps to remove chemicals, toxins and fluoride, bromine and chloride.
[03:06:28.287 --> 03:06:32.308]  Add Malignabla to stimulate these two detox and anti-cancer protection.
[03:06:32.308 --> 03:06:37.089]  Green Tea Supreme to bind ionic toxins and protecting DNA and membranes.
[03:06:37.089 --> 03:06:43.751]  And Nutratrala to recycle all fat and water-soluble antioxidant cellular protection enzymes and molecules.
[03:06:43.751 --> 03:06:45.972]  Keeler Max and Dr. Bill's Oral Detox.
[03:06:46.232 --> 03:06:49.594]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:06:49.594 --> 03:06:51.035]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:07:11.129 --> 03:07:12.671]  But who is the enemy?
[03:07:12.671 --> 03:07:13.471]  Bin Laden.
[03:07:13.471 --> 03:07:14.292]  This is his M.O.
[03:07:14.292 --> 03:07:15.834]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:07:15.834 --> 03:07:17.836]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:07:17.836 --> 03:07:24.983]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:07:24.983 --> 03:07:25.464]  Some U.S.
[03:07:25.464 --> 03:07:31.110]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:07:31.790 --> 03:07:35.272]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:07:35.272 --> 03:07:37.293]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:08:01.690 --> 03:08:04.912]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[03:08:04.912 --> 03:08:08.253]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[03:08:08.253 --> 03:08:12.035]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[03:08:12.035 --> 03:08:18.619]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[03:08:18.619 --> 03:08:23.841]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[03:08:23.841 --> 03:08:30.525]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[03:08:30.845 --> 03:08:31.946]  Need something more?
[03:08:31.946 --> 03:08:35.888]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.

[03:09:02.391 --> 03:09:07.393]  It's a sudden reversal of fortunes for the oil producing countries.
[03:09:07.393 --> 03:09:16.757]  In the Gulf states you have quite a few bubbles popping.
[03:09:16.757 --> 03:09:22.620]  Dubai was probably the biggest real estate bubble in the world and it's now
[03:09:23.540 --> 03:09:23.900]  I think?
[03:09:47.257 --> 03:09:50.440]  Chavez, probably his days are numbered.
[03:09:50.440 --> 03:09:54.664]  And in Iran, I think that he's not going to last a year.
[03:09:54.664 --> 03:10:02.051]  I may be wrong, but I mean he's under considerable duress and his influence is going to decline.
[03:10:02.051 --> 03:10:11.219]  In Iran, Ahmadinejad is up for elections in 2009 and unless he can provoke some
[03:10:12.244 --> 03:10:13.746]  What about Russia?
[03:10:13.746 --> 03:10:14.967]  What about Russia?
[03:10:27.841 --> 03:10:50.697]  There, you see, Putin has been using oil for a number of reasons to re-establish Russia's geopolitical influence, to enrich the rulers, to maintain themselves in power, and to bribe the rulers of the neighboring countries to gain control over their gas.
[03:10:54.020 --> 03:10:57.304]  Through the success, he was very popular.
[03:10:57.304 --> 03:11:02.430]  Not so easy now.
[03:11:02.430 --> 03:11:12.082]  Now, suddenly you have financial collapse, inflation, ruble falling, living standards falling.
[03:11:13.032 --> 03:11:28.108]  And there's a danger that he will be more adventurous trying to have some foreign adventure, Ukraine, whatever, to divert attention.
[03:11:28.108 --> 03:11:29.449]  I'm afraid we have to end it there.
[03:11:29.449 --> 03:11:30.951]  George Soros, I'd like to thank you very much.
[03:11:30.951 --> 03:11:32.813]  We didn't get to China, but we heard lots about Russia.
[03:11:32.813 --> 03:11:33.654]  That is George Soros.
[03:11:36.192 --> 03:11:49.597]  Now remember, Lindsey Williams, months before they snuck attack Russian-controlled territory in Georgia, held since the early 90s, historically part of Russia, he said they're also going to start stuff with Russia.
[03:11:49.597 --> 03:11:51.157]  No one was even talking about that.
[03:11:51.157 --> 03:11:54.959]  That just came out of the clear blue one morning, but Lindsey was right.
[03:11:54.959 --> 03:11:57.980]  I played that Lindsey Williams because I wanted to, you know,
[03:11:59.116 --> 03:12:09.519]  Have you been able to comment, before we get into the latest developments, on why do you think the elite are now basically admitting everything that you were saying, but you said it before it was even announced or it even happened?
[03:12:09.519 --> 03:12:12.460]  Well, Alex, you have to understand, I'm just an ordinary everyday guy.
[03:12:12.460 --> 03:12:15.501]  I put on my britches just like every other man every morning.
[03:12:15.501 --> 03:12:22.063]  But, by the providence of God, numbers of years ago, I had the privilege of living with the elite of the world for three years.
[03:12:22.063 --> 03:12:24.244]  As a result, I've kept in touch with some of them.
[03:12:25.051 --> 03:12:30.614]  They have kept in touch with me sometimes over these past 35 years.
[03:12:30.614 --> 03:12:32.336]  They knew in advance.
[03:12:32.336 --> 03:12:34.737]  Alex, folks, I plead with you.
[03:12:34.737 --> 03:12:44.083]  Everybody out in this audience today, I beg of you, please listen and believe every word Alex Jones is saying.
[03:12:44.083 --> 03:12:52.388]  He has tried to tell you for years that there is a group of elite, and let me say as emphatically as I humanly possibly can,
[03:12:52.921 --> 03:13:03.968]  There positively is a group of people on the face of this earth who control the world, and they knew a year to two years ago everything that's taking place in the financial world right now.
[03:13:03.968 --> 03:13:09.611]  They knew they were going to take the price of crude oil from $147 a barrel to $50 a barrel.
[03:13:09.611 --> 03:13:11.312]  It was all planned in advance.
[03:13:11.312 --> 03:13:15.615]  This is not something that just happened out of a clear blue sky.
[03:13:15.615 --> 03:13:17.937]  I don't know whether George Soros knew it back then or not.
[03:13:19.085 --> 03:13:30.369]  I know that seven months ago, I was told it by one of these individuals who knows everything that goes on behind closed doors, so let me show you exactly what has happened in the past seven days.
[03:13:30.369 --> 03:13:31.950]  Seven to nine days, maybe.
[03:13:31.950 --> 03:13:33.770]  Okay, first of all, Dubai.
[03:13:33.770 --> 03:13:36.812]  Last weekend, and George Soros just mentioned that.
[03:13:36.812 --> 03:13:38.432]  I'm so glad you played that, Alex.
[03:13:38.432 --> 03:13:39.393]  Thank you.
[03:13:39.393 --> 03:13:45.875]  Last weekend, Dubai, of all things, one of the OPEC, Oil Producing Countries of the World,
[03:13:46.331 --> 03:13:48.412]  Building that beautiful five-star city.
[03:13:48.412 --> 03:13:59.079]  Dubai borrowed last weekend $10 billion on five-year unsecured bonds, and they say that within another week's time they're going to have to borrow another $10 billion.
[03:13:59.079 --> 03:14:11.868]  They have canceled their concrete contract with an American company that was supplying the concrete for that beautiful five-star city, and sitting on the airport parking lot in Dubai City today
[03:14:12.506 --> 03:14:16.387]  Approximately 3,000 abandoned automobiles.
[03:14:16.387 --> 03:14:17.247]  Why?
[03:14:17.247 --> 03:14:20.887]  You see, in Dubai, if you don't make your automobile payment... Oh, yes, they did.
[03:14:20.887 --> 03:14:30.309]  These workers went from around the world to Dubai to make their fortune, building that beautiful five-star city that there's never been anything like it on the face of the earth.
[03:14:30.309 --> 03:14:31.489]  They bought Mercedes.
[03:14:31.489 --> 03:14:34.030]  They bought Rolls Royces.
[03:14:34.030 --> 03:14:40.291]  But in Dubai, if you don't make your automobile payment or your house payment, they don't just come and get the automobile of the house.
[03:14:40.291 --> 03:14:40.991]  They come and get you.
[03:14:41.858 --> 03:14:42.339]  I don't
[03:14:59.634 --> 03:15:04.617]  On every barrel of oil, and they've done it within four months' time.
[03:15:04.617 --> 03:15:14.283]  Now, Lindsey, we covered that when you were on with us, because I want to get into the new developments and, you know, go back to what this elitist former oil company had told you the globalists were planning.
[03:15:14.283 --> 03:15:24.429]  It dovetails with our intel, because it's now all of it is unfolding, and how you see this unfolding, how bad it's going to get, how bad he told you that it was going to get.
[03:15:24.429 --> 03:15:26.831]  But clearly, they get the world overextended in these debt bubbles.
[03:15:27.833 --> 03:15:33.136]  Then they blow out the oil, they blow out the stock market for a global consolidation so they can consolidate things.
[03:15:33.136 --> 03:15:35.158]  Is that not what you were told?
[03:15:35.158 --> 03:15:36.679]  Yes, that's exactly what he said.
[03:15:36.679 --> 03:15:42.122]  He said America will see a financial crisis that will be so great that it will take years to come out of it.
[03:15:42.122 --> 03:15:45.464]  He said that Russia was going to be made a great empire again.
[03:15:45.464 --> 03:15:47.926]  They'll have to break them first and control them.
[03:15:47.926 --> 03:15:51.969]  He also mentioned other countries of the world and what would happen to them.
[03:15:51.969 --> 03:15:54.450]  Let me point out what happened this past weekend.
[03:15:54.450 --> 03:15:56.872]  Latvia, government collapsed.
[03:15:56.872 --> 03:15:57.152]  Yes!
[03:15:57.642 --> 03:16:01.663]  Yeah, Latvia doesn't have natural resources, so it became a financial center.
[03:16:01.663 --> 03:16:03.404]  It has totally collapsed.
[03:16:03.404 --> 03:16:09.545]  The Ukraine, if you went to the bank in the Ukraine, you live there, you could not pull money out.
[03:16:09.545 --> 03:16:13.326]  They will not allow anyone to take cash out of the bank into Ukraine.
[03:16:13.326 --> 03:16:16.127]  Iceland, as you remember, collapsed a while back.
[03:16:16.127 --> 03:16:22.789]  All of these, Hungary, Hungary's foreign fell to an all-time low on Monday.
[03:16:22.789 --> 03:16:26.470]  Poland's volatility slumped to the lowest in five years.
[03:16:26.897 --> 03:16:33.779]  This is a worldwide situation that they basically are going to bring in the control of the whole world.
[03:16:33.779 --> 03:16:40.401]  East and Central Europe has been supported by Germany as of this past, what, two days ago.
[03:16:40.401 --> 03:16:43.761]  And by the way, they're now announcing world government and all the news is the same.
[03:16:43.761 --> 03:16:49.263]  You're ruled by banks and a new bank of the world that will pay carbon taxes to exactly what you said they were going to do.
[03:16:49.263 --> 03:16:51.964]  This is the foretold coming of the one world government.
[03:16:51.964 --> 03:16:53.324]  It is now happening.
[03:16:54.226 --> 03:16:58.670]  Yes, that's exactly what's happening, and now let's go to the United States of America.
[03:16:58.670 --> 03:16:59.891]  How is this affecting us?
[03:16:59.891 --> 03:17:15.506]  First of all, he said to me seven months ago, and Alex, you granted me the privilege of breaking this news on your show for the first time on July the 28th, and he said, America will see a financial collapse so great that it will take years to come out of it.
[03:17:15.506 --> 03:17:17.568]  Now let me point out what happened just this past week.
[03:17:17.568 --> 03:17:19.129]  Corporate profits report.
[03:17:19.705 --> 03:17:23.728]  On this Monday, Mesa's profits were down 59%.
[03:17:23.728 --> 03:17:27.651]  Target, yeah, a lot of you do business there from time to time.
[03:17:27.651 --> 03:17:31.554]  41% down on profit report.
[03:17:31.554 --> 03:17:33.536]  JCPenney, 41%.
[03:17:33.536 --> 03:17:37.098]  Office Depot lost $1.5 billion.
[03:17:37.098 --> 03:17:44.184]  Imagine how this is going to affect the tax structure of the federal and state government within 60 to 90 days.
[03:17:44.184 --> 03:17:47.646]  And the crime rate's exploding and they're openly announcing they're getting ready for martial law.
[03:17:47.646 --> 03:17:48.247]  Please continue.
[03:17:49.076 --> 03:17:57.518]  Yes, AIG, largest insurance company in the world, I guess it is, reported the biggest quarterly loss ever in U.S.
[03:17:57.518 --> 03:17:59.079]  financial history.
[03:17:59.079 --> 03:18:01.679]  Close to $70 billion in one quarter.
[03:18:01.679 --> 03:18:04.380]  It's lost over $100 billion in the last year.
[03:18:04.380 --> 03:18:10.682]  Yes, we bailed them out to $120 billion, and now they are going back for another $60 billion.
[03:18:10.682 --> 03:18:13.122]  Let me put it this way.
[03:18:13.122 --> 03:18:13.223]  In 1975,
[03:18:15.535 --> 03:18:31.300]  A person could buy all of the real estate in America, all of the shopping malls in America, all of the hotels in America, all of the land in the United States of America could have been bought in 1975, but what the government of the United States of America has spent in the past 90 days.
[03:18:31.300 --> 03:18:36.041]  I mean, folks, this is so startling.
[03:18:36.041 --> 03:18:38.802]  It shatters the thinking of a person, almost any group.
[03:18:39.252 --> 03:18:41.393]  He has borrowed $40 billion from the U.S.
[03:18:41.393 --> 03:18:43.615]  Treasury, yet it's only worth $13 billion.
[03:18:43.615 --> 03:18:53.400]  Do you realize that your great-great-grandchildren are going to be responsible for this indebtedness of the outlandish things that are being done right now?
[03:18:53.400 --> 03:19:00.444]  A Saudi Arabian prince had invested hundreds of billions of dollars into Citibank.
[03:19:00.444 --> 03:19:01.505]  He's going broke!
[03:19:01.505 --> 03:19:04.647]  I mean, he literally is on the verge of wandering out.
[03:19:05.784 --> 03:19:21.903]  This man told me, he said the oil producing countries, OPEC, they are doing this for the purpose of bringing them to bankruptcy and every bit of it is exactly what you've been saying all of these times, these years, Alex.
[03:19:21.903 --> 03:19:23.725]  It's coming to pass right before our eyes.
[03:19:25.455 --> 03:19:27.736]  Well, let me come down to where we are.
[03:19:27.736 --> 03:19:31.859]  This past weekend, I'm going to give a place, I'm going to give a name.
[03:19:53.411 --> 03:19:56.553]  Uh, you know, I have permission to do this.
[03:19:56.553 --> 03:19:58.354]  Campo, Colorado.
[03:19:58.354 --> 03:20:00.675]  Southeastern Colorado, Northern Texas.
[03:20:00.675 --> 03:20:05.558]  Forty percent of the food supply in the United States of America is grown right there.
[03:20:05.558 --> 03:20:07.219]  The couple is Vito Locke.
[03:20:07.219 --> 03:20:10.680]  She and her husband own a farm of thousands of acres.
[03:20:10.680 --> 03:20:13.962]  The largest farms in America are in that part of the country.
[03:20:13.962 --> 03:20:22.807]  Now, folks, please, if anything else is said on this program today, this you must remember because it's going to affect whether you eat dinner or not.
[03:20:23.587 --> 03:20:27.973]  She said to me, Catherine Williams, we don't know what we're going to do.
[03:20:27.973 --> 03:20:31.897]  She said, right now, we're getting $3 a bushel for coin.
[03:20:31.897 --> 03:20:34.821]  She said, we're ready to put in our prop, and she can't do it.
[03:20:34.821 --> 03:20:37.144]  She said, it cost us $5.50 to raise that coin this next year.
[03:20:41.167 --> 03:20:41.627]  Stay there.
[03:20:41.627 --> 03:20:45.049]  We're going to talk about how they destroyed the commodities market by design to bankrupt everything.
[03:20:45.049 --> 03:20:53.795]  This is the massive new world order move, as you do in third world countries, but on a global scale, bankrupting everything so riots break out and martial law can be declared.
[03:20:53.795 --> 03:20:56.297]  Then they set up dictatorship.
[03:20:56.297 --> 03:20:57.677]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:20:57.677 --> 03:20:58.818]  Lindsey Williams is our guest.
[03:20:58.818 --> 03:20:59.298]  Quick break.
[03:20:59.298 --> 03:21:00.039]  We'll be right back.
[03:21:01.542 --> 03:21:03.223]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[03:21:03.223 --> 03:21:04.963]  What does humidity mean to you?
[03:21:04.963 --> 03:21:07.644]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[03:21:07.644 --> 03:21:12.786]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[03:21:12.786 --> 03:21:15.967]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[03:22:02.250 --> 03:22:06.372]  Ted Anderson from Midas Wednesday, March 4, 2009 Gold 919.80 Hansco Coins can be purchased for $946.36, $473.18 for half, $236.59 for quarter.
[03:22:06.372 --> 03:22:06.892]  That's $949.36, $273.18, and $236.59.
[03:22:19.028 --> 03:22:31.555]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[03:22:31.555 --> 03:22:34.737]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[03:22:34.737 --> 03:22:38.079]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[03:22:38.079 --> 03:22:40.921]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[03:22:41.161 --> 03:22:43.963]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[03:22:43.963 --> 03:22:44.483]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:44.483 --> 03:22:49.165]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[03:22:49.165 --> 03:22:50.026]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:50.026 --> 03:22:55.789]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:55.789 --> 03:22:56.009]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:22:56.009 --> 03:22:59.031]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[03:22:59.031 --> 03:23:00.071]  And we knew what to do.
[03:23:09.718 --> 03:23:10.980]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:23:10.980 --> 03:23:18.029]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:23:18.029 --> 03:23:26.561]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:23:26.926 --> 03:23:34.010]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:23:34.010 --> 03:23:37.192]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:23:37.192 --> 03:23:42.956]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:23:42.956 --> 03:23:46.038]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:23:46.038 --> 03:23:53.282]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[03:23:55.742 --> 03:23:56.002]  I don't know.
[03:24:12.131 --> 03:24:18.638]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[03:24:18.638 --> 03:24:20.660]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.

[03:25:04.486 --> 03:25:09.248]  So many things are happening so fast right now that we've started another show, 9 to Midnight.
[03:25:09.248 --> 03:25:14.970]  Jason Mervis, the Infowarrior, on the Genesis Network and on the internet streams at Infowars.com.
[03:25:14.970 --> 03:25:21.553]  Also, it's PrisonPlanet.tv, the full three hours, just like we've done three of the four hours today live TV.
[03:25:21.553 --> 03:25:23.593]  He's doing all three every night live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:25:25.481 --> 03:25:27.205]  All right, going back to Lindsey Williams.
[03:25:27.205 --> 03:25:34.540]  I may even cancel the state rep who's coming on, who's introduced a pro-Tenth Amendment thing saying they're not going to follow the Fed's gun control.
[03:25:34.540 --> 03:25:36.584]  This is in Alabama, Representative Mark, uh...
[03:25:37.967 --> 03:25:39.908]  Kiki, but we'll see what happens.
[03:25:39.908 --> 03:25:45.232]  This Lindsey Williams stuff is so important, but maybe we'll just have the rep on for five minutes while he's with us, and then go back to Lindsey.
[03:25:45.232 --> 03:25:47.094]  Okay, Lindsey, recap.
[03:25:47.094 --> 03:25:50.617]  Going into what's happening to the farmers, not just here, but worldwide.
[03:25:50.617 --> 03:25:53.078]  Riots are breaking out all over the planet over the last year.
[03:25:53.078 --> 03:25:54.519]  Countries are falling all over Africa.
[03:25:56.701 --> 03:25:58.903]  I mean, you name it, it is getting crazy.
[03:25:58.903 --> 03:26:02.506]  I listen to the BBC every day in my car on XM, and it's another country falling.
[03:26:02.506 --> 03:26:03.787]  Revolutions everywhere.
[03:26:03.787 --> 03:26:05.248]  CIA-backed coups.
[03:26:05.248 --> 03:26:07.250]  The globalists are moving on all fronts right now.
[03:26:07.250 --> 03:26:08.871]  Please continue.
[03:26:08.871 --> 03:26:21.522]  Everything that the elitists planned a year ago, a year and a half ago, what they've planned for many years in the financial crisis, with what's happening in real estate and banking in America right now, all of this was planned many, many years ago.
[03:26:21.522 --> 03:26:25.585]  They knew everything they were going to do in advance, and now it comes down to the one thing,
[03:26:26.129 --> 03:26:29.152]  That whenever you control that, you control the masses of population.
[03:26:29.152 --> 03:26:31.353]  Now, there are two things that every human being must have.
[03:26:31.353 --> 03:26:33.235]  You've got to have water.
[03:26:33.235 --> 03:26:36.397]  At least once every 24 hours, you must drink water.
[03:26:36.397 --> 03:26:38.599]  There's something else you have to have to live.
[03:26:38.599 --> 03:26:42.943]  You might do without a house or an automobile or some of these other things, like a boat and so on.
[03:26:42.943 --> 03:26:45.505]  You can not do without food.
[03:26:45.505 --> 03:26:47.246]  It finally has come to that.
[03:26:47.246 --> 03:26:49.568]  They've gotten the farmers right where they want them.
[03:26:49.568 --> 03:26:51.530]  Beedle Rock, Tampo, Colorado.
[03:26:52.014 --> 03:26:53.015]  Thousands of acres.
[03:26:53.015 --> 03:26:55.876]  40% of the food supply of America.
[03:26:55.876 --> 03:26:59.758]  Corn right now, they're selling it for $3 a bushel.
[03:26:59.758 --> 03:27:01.699]  Now, this was this weekend.
[03:27:01.699 --> 03:27:05.761]  It cost them to raise that corn $5.50 a bushel.
[03:27:05.761 --> 03:27:07.942]  They cannot put their crops in this spring.
[03:27:07.942 --> 03:27:08.782]  Wheat.
[03:27:08.782 --> 03:27:11.664]  Wheat, they're getting for it right now $5 a bushel.
[03:27:11.664 --> 03:27:16.026]  It cost them to raise that wheat $6 to $7 a bushel.
[03:27:16.026 --> 03:27:17.947]  And the farmers, what are they going to do?
[03:27:17.947 --> 03:27:19.407]  They can't plant.
[03:27:19.407 --> 03:27:20.348]  I asked Vita.
[03:27:20.348 --> 03:27:20.608]  I said,
[03:27:21.193 --> 03:27:22.514]  Where are the farmers going?
[03:27:22.514 --> 03:27:27.676]  She said, the only farmers that are going to plant this spring are those who have irrigated crops.
[03:27:27.676 --> 03:27:30.998]  And she said, they know they aren't going to be able to produce enough.
[03:27:30.998 --> 03:27:38.241]  And she said, they are planning, and they're depending on the insurance to bail them out, regardless of what happens to the weather.
[03:27:38.241 --> 03:27:41.022]  She said, Lindsey, there's going to be a major crisis.
[03:27:41.022 --> 03:27:43.163]  Folks, please listen to this.
[03:27:43.163 --> 03:27:44.644]  This startled me to no end.
[03:27:44.644 --> 03:27:46.004]  She said one other thing.
[03:27:46.004 --> 03:27:49.226]  She said, Chaplain Williams, she said, listen,
[03:27:49.724 --> 03:27:51.165]  There was nothing.
[03:27:51.165 --> 03:27:52.825]  Folks, please.
[03:27:52.825 --> 03:27:55.366]  You've got to see what our President is doing.
[03:27:55.366 --> 03:27:58.107]  Nothing in the stimulus package.
[03:27:58.107 --> 03:28:02.909]  Not one penny in the stimulus package was earmarked for farmers.
[03:28:02.909 --> 03:28:04.190]  It's all for the bankers.
[03:28:04.190 --> 03:28:04.910]  All for the bankers.
[03:28:04.910 --> 03:28:06.250]  All for the bankers.
[03:28:06.250 --> 03:28:09.191]  All for the bailout of the money people.
[03:28:09.191 --> 03:28:11.292]  All of their friends and their cronies.
[03:28:11.292 --> 03:28:12.253]  But nothing.
[03:28:12.253 --> 03:28:13.633]  Not one penny.
[03:28:13.633 --> 03:28:14.313]  Think of it now.
[03:28:14.313 --> 03:28:16.394]  Go back to the stimulus package for yourself.
[03:28:16.394 --> 03:28:18.595]  Think of everything you've heard about it for the last few weeks.
[03:28:19.233 --> 03:28:25.794]  Nothing in the stimulus package was earmarked for the farmers of America, and yet they cannot plant their crops this spring.
[03:28:25.794 --> 03:28:33.036]  And I said to Vita, I said, Vita, how long is this going to, how long before this is going to show up on the store shelves?
[03:28:33.036 --> 03:28:36.516]  She said, Lindsey, we can't plant this spring.
[03:28:36.516 --> 03:28:39.197]  She said, there's nothing we can do about it.
[03:28:39.197 --> 03:28:41.737]  Our farms, many of them are going to be lost.
[03:28:41.737 --> 03:28:44.698]  She said, next fall, the crop's not going to be there.
[03:28:45.151 --> 03:28:52.514]  For those who do irrigate and will dare to plant, knowing that about all they're going to get is the insurance out of it, she said the food's not going to be there.
[03:28:52.514 --> 03:28:57.436]  She said, you have about six to nine... Now, Alex, this is what's so amazing.
[03:28:57.436 --> 03:29:11.621]  This man indicated to me that nine to twelve months, six to nine to twelve, he didn't say exactly how long, there would be this crisis that would appear in America, and it is going exactly almost to the month
[03:29:12.267 --> 03:29:15.629]  What this man told me was going to happen when I broke it on you folks.
[03:29:15.629 --> 03:29:18.991]  I am so glad you allowed me to tell it on July the 28th.
[03:29:18.991 --> 03:29:26.496]  Otherwise, many people in the listening audience would have difficulty believing today that they had all this planned in advance.
[03:29:26.496 --> 03:29:27.837]  But they did!
[03:29:27.837 --> 03:29:34.802]  And now I would come down to the one control item that if you want to control the masses of people, you control the food.
[03:29:34.802 --> 03:29:37.624]  And this weekend, Vito Locke said to me, folks, don't do it.
[03:29:37.624 --> 03:29:38.644]  Look in the phone directory.
[03:29:38.644 --> 03:29:39.085]  Call her up.
[03:29:39.910 --> 03:29:41.954]  If you doubt what I'm saying... No, no, no.
[03:29:41.954 --> 03:29:43.516]  Listen, listen, listen.
[03:29:43.516 --> 03:29:49.586]  Beef is more in the stores, but because the meat packers, four companies, have bought up all of the processing...
[03:29:50.825 --> 03:29:53.646]  The people raising cattle are literally going bankrupt.
[03:29:53.646 --> 03:29:56.328]  They can't even make the money they put into it on selling them.
[03:29:56.328 --> 03:29:57.428]  They're losing money.
[03:29:57.428 --> 03:29:59.189]  The cows are stacking up.
[03:29:59.189 --> 03:30:00.350]  The beef is more.
[03:30:00.350 --> 03:30:09.194]  Just like all the raw materials, the corn, the wheat is more at the store, but they've gotten it so imploded at the grassroots level of the economy that they've got a shortage of it.
[03:30:09.194 --> 03:30:13.016]  You know, just like when they have a shortage of gold, its price doesn't go up.
[03:30:13.016 --> 03:30:13.596]  This is not a
[03:30:14.156 --> 03:30:14.816]  Free market.
[03:30:14.816 --> 03:30:17.678]  This is a controlled system.
[03:30:17.678 --> 03:30:22.281]  And they're coming in with the Animal Society, the Prima Society, shutting down the farms, controlling them.
[03:30:22.281 --> 03:30:30.205]  With carbon taxes in New Zealand and Australia, the headlines are just shutting down their farms because there's hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes just on a few sheep.
[03:30:30.205 --> 03:30:33.127]  I mean, this is total feudalism, total control.
[03:30:33.587 --> 03:30:34.587]  By design.
[03:30:34.587 --> 03:30:37.828]  I promised we're gonna have Lindsey on for an hour and a half, but we got the time zones messed up.
[03:30:37.828 --> 03:30:39.009]  We're gonna have him back up soon.
[03:30:39.009 --> 03:30:40.489]  We're gonna come back with him for the rest of the hour.
[03:30:40.489 --> 03:30:41.830]  I've canceled the state rep.
[03:30:41.830 --> 03:30:43.610]  We'll have him back on about the Second Amendment.
[03:30:43.610 --> 03:30:46.611]  This is too important with Lindsey Williams, and I promised to take a few calls.
[03:30:46.611 --> 03:30:51.733]  So specifically for Lindsey Williams, 1-800-259-9231.
[03:30:51.733 --> 03:30:53.133]  We're on the march.
[03:30:53.133 --> 03:30:55.654]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:55.654 --> 03:30:58.355]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:31:01.858 --> 03:31:05.399]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[03:31:05.399 --> 03:31:07.879]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?

[03:32:01.831 --> 03:32:08.573]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:32:08.573 --> 03:32:10.274]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:32:11.412 --> 03:32:12.774]  Who is the enemy?
[03:32:12.774 --> 03:32:13.595]  Bin Laden.
[03:32:13.595 --> 03:32:14.576]  This is his M.O.
[03:32:14.576 --> 03:32:15.917]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:32:15.917 --> 03:32:17.939]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.

[03:32:25.086 --> 03:32:25.567]  Some U.S.
[03:32:25.567 --> 03:32:31.213]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:32:31.913 --> 03:32:35.415]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:32:35.415 --> 03:32:37.576]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.

[03:33:58.158 --> 03:34:08.505]  The globalists are militarily and economically moving against us on every front, but the people are awakening.
[03:34:08.505 --> 03:34:11.507]  This is their point of greatest strength and greatest weakness.
[03:34:11.507 --> 03:34:14.308]  Their operations are being launched worldwide.
[03:34:14.308 --> 03:34:19.231]  Coups, murders, just Google African presidents being killed, prime ministers, generals.
[03:34:21.744 --> 03:34:24.846]  Madagascar, Eastern Europe, Asia.
[03:34:24.846 --> 03:34:26.987]  They are moving on every front.
[03:34:26.987 --> 03:34:31.369]  Fights between Russia and the United States over who controls what countries.
[03:34:31.369 --> 03:34:33.230]  Payoffs going on on both sides.
[03:34:33.230 --> 03:34:34.951]  It's all happening.
[03:34:34.951 --> 03:34:38.313]  Historians say that more happens sometimes in a year than happens in the previous hundred.
[03:34:39.053 --> 03:34:45.575]  Lennon had another wicked quote along those lines about sometimes things happen more in a week than happen in a decade.
[03:34:45.575 --> 03:34:46.255]  We're in that now.
[03:34:46.255 --> 03:34:53.697]  We're about to go back to Lindsey Williams right now, but I have been rampaging here on air with all this key info for two hours, three hours and thirty-three minutes.
[03:34:53.697 --> 03:34:56.077]  Three hours and thirty-three minutes.
[03:34:56.077 --> 03:35:01.778]  And it is sponsors that make this show possible, so I want to name a few of those sponsors right now that I believe in, that I use.
[03:35:01.778 --> 03:35:03.479]  I'm drinking a color blue water right here, baby.
[03:35:05.359 --> 03:35:05.980]  I love it.
[03:35:05.980 --> 03:35:07.102]  Right here in the office, right out of the air.
[03:35:07.102 --> 03:35:07.703]  People go, what is it?
[03:35:07.703 --> 03:35:09.085]  There's no water bottle on top of it.
[03:35:09.085 --> 03:35:09.886]  No, it's out of the air.
[03:35:11.252 --> 03:35:12.552]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[03:35:12.552 --> 03:35:13.413]  Pays for itself in one year.
[03:35:13.413 --> 03:35:14.373]  You buy your water from the store.
[03:35:14.373 --> 03:35:16.134]  Pure, clean water without the flora, without anything.
[03:35:16.134 --> 03:35:18.474]  Goes through seven filters inside.
[03:35:18.474 --> 03:35:19.715]  You hear the ad I run, it's wrong.
[03:35:19.715 --> 03:35:21.035]  I've got to recut it and say five filters.
[03:35:21.035 --> 03:35:21.936]  It's seven.
[03:35:21.936 --> 03:35:23.056]  Just an amazing system.
[03:35:23.056 --> 03:35:23.996]  Great tasting, pure H2O.
[03:35:23.996 --> 03:35:25.937]  Exactly the way nature makes it.
[03:35:25.937 --> 03:35:26.217]  1-800-691-6043.
[03:35:26.217 --> 03:35:29.318]  Hook it up to a solar panel.
[03:35:29.318 --> 03:35:30.619]  Don't even need a well, folks.
[03:35:30.619 --> 03:35:32.839]  By the way, we just drilled another well in our family land.
[03:35:32.839 --> 03:35:33.880]  We had one 300-footer.
[03:35:33.880 --> 03:35:35.980]  We went in 800 feet to secure water.
[03:35:35.980 --> 03:35:37.401]  I mean, I'm getting ready, okay?
[03:35:38.041 --> 03:35:43.326]  And we hope to avert all this, but I mean, I got guns and food and I'm going to take care of my family, folks.
[03:35:43.326 --> 03:35:44.447]  What I'm telling you, I believe in.
[03:35:44.447 --> 03:35:44.967]  1-800-691-6043.
[03:35:44.967 --> 03:35:45.027]  1-800-691-6043.
[03:35:51.206 --> 03:35:56.410]  NicolaBlue.com, E-C-O-L-O, blue.com, get yours today.
[03:35:56.410 --> 03:36:10.681]  Another fine sponsor that makes this show possible is the best storable foods company out there, the biggest storable foods company out there, non-GMO, it's just amazing quality food, great prices, 800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com.
[03:36:10.681 --> 03:36:12.603]  You'll never stand in the bread line if you have your own food.
[03:36:12.603 --> 03:36:13.023]  The U.N.
[03:36:13.023 --> 03:36:14.244]  has said, just Google, U.N.
[03:36:14.244 --> 03:36:15.525]  says, use food as a weapon.
[03:36:15.525 --> 03:36:16.526]  You'll read the official U.N.
[03:36:16.526 --> 03:36:17.947]  website saying they use it as a weapon.
[03:36:18.587 --> 03:36:19.087]  800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[03:36:19.087 --> 03:36:29.331]  Our job is to get folks prepared, and it's symbiotic that the sponsors also make this show possible, and the incredible amount of funds it takes to run this.
[03:36:29.331 --> 03:36:31.132]  So we thank efoodsdirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[03:36:31.132 --> 03:36:45.458]  And one other sponsor that I wanted to tell you about, and it also goes along the lines of preparedness, and that's mysolarbackup.com, from the great folks at Solutions from Science.
[03:36:46.650 --> 03:36:52.994]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of a power source, 1800 power plant, and a high-efficiency solar plant designed to provide endless electricity.
[03:36:52.994 --> 03:36:55.276]  That's right, it generates free electricity once you have the unit.
[03:36:55.276 --> 03:37:00.299]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in blackouts gas pumps can't work because they run on electricity.
[03:37:00.299 --> 03:37:04.002]  The solar generator is like having your own power plant hidden in your home.
[03:37:04.002 --> 03:37:05.883]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[03:37:05.883 --> 03:37:07.764]  If you need more power, get more units.
[03:37:07.764 --> 03:37:09.105]  MySolarBackup.com.
[03:37:09.105 --> 03:37:10.366]  MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[03:37:10.366 --> 03:37:10.406]  877-327-0365.
[03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:20.835]  Again, MySolarBackup.com.
[03:37:20.835 --> 03:37:29.787]  Another group I want to plug, not really even a sponsor, they are on the website, but I just want to have them on as guests, period, to promote it, not even as sponsors, is TruthRadio.com.
[03:37:29.787 --> 03:37:30.688]  Or is it Truth AM?
[03:37:31.834 --> 03:37:37.657]  That's right, trutham.com, trutham.com, trutham.com, trutham.com.
[03:37:37.657 --> 03:37:42.939]  These little AMs, FCC license, legal, they go out three miles.
[03:37:42.939 --> 03:37:46.641]  You put that in your area, on your house, put up signs all over the three miles.
[03:37:46.641 --> 03:37:47.841]  That's how we're going to beat them.
[03:37:47.841 --> 03:37:50.022]  Trutham.com is throwing that in too.
[03:37:50.022 --> 03:37:51.583]  They're not even paying for me to do that.
[03:37:51.583 --> 03:37:52.123]  I believe in it.
[03:37:52.123 --> 03:37:54.364]  We've got to get micro-FMs up, whatever.
[03:37:54.364 --> 03:37:56.025]  I mean, we've got to do it now, folks.
[03:37:56.025 --> 03:37:57.886]  We've got to move now to fight these people.
[03:37:57.886 --> 03:37:59.006]  Okay.
[03:37:59.006 --> 03:38:00.047]  That said, that done.
[03:38:02.322 --> 03:38:05.664]  It's just, it's just amazing.
[03:38:05.664 --> 03:38:15.890]  Lindsey Williams, please continue, sir, with what this guy told you, because when you came on six months ago, you told, seven months ago, you told Dr. Stan Monteith about this.
[03:38:15.890 --> 03:38:22.554]  You couldn't go public at the time, but then six months ago you did, when oil was right up at 147, 148 a barrel, now below 40.
[03:38:22.554 --> 03:38:27.596]  He said they were going to implode that, bring in World Depression, you know, have crises in the U.S.
[03:38:27.596 --> 03:38:29.698]  He told you, you better get out of the U.S.
[03:38:29.698 --> 03:38:30.458]  There's nowhere to run.
[03:38:30.458 --> 03:38:31.199]  This is worldwide.
[03:38:31.199 --> 03:38:31.759]  Please continue.
[03:38:32.742 --> 03:38:34.443]  How fast can it happen?
[03:38:34.443 --> 03:38:36.424]  I do not want to frighten you.
[03:38:36.424 --> 03:38:38.665]  And I'm sure Alex doesn't want to frighten you.
[03:38:38.665 --> 03:38:41.046]  He just tells you the truth like it is.
[03:38:41.046 --> 03:38:42.467]  This is how fast it can happen.
[03:38:42.467 --> 03:38:45.588]  Two weeks ago, the Latvian government collapsed.
[03:38:45.588 --> 03:38:47.669]  Now, the first government to collapse was Iceland.
[03:38:47.669 --> 03:38:49.550]  You remember that about three to four months ago?
[03:38:49.550 --> 03:38:49.810]  Yes.
[03:38:49.810 --> 03:38:52.032]  It was havoc in that country shortly afterwards.
[03:38:52.032 --> 03:38:52.732]  And it's still havoc!
[03:38:53.527 --> 03:38:54.967]  Yeah, and this is it.
[03:38:54.967 --> 03:38:58.288]  Oh yeah, it won't be anything but bankrupt from now on.
[03:38:58.288 --> 03:39:01.569]  I've been the second country to declare bankruptcy.
[03:39:01.569 --> 03:39:04.089]  Latvian government two weeks ago.
[03:39:04.089 --> 03:39:07.610]  Now, I want you to see just how fast things can happen.
[03:39:07.610 --> 03:39:12.491]  And folks, this is just how fast it will happen in the United States of America.
[03:39:12.491 --> 03:39:13.751]  I beg of you.
[03:39:13.751 --> 03:39:16.832]  Understand, it can take place within a matter of hours.
[03:39:16.832 --> 03:39:17.472]  Here it is.
[03:39:17.472 --> 03:39:19.813]  Latvian government collapsed.
[03:39:19.813 --> 03:39:21.993]  Government is cutting spending wherever it can.
[03:39:22.481 --> 03:39:27.165]  Hospitals, schools throughout the country are on threat of closure.
[03:39:27.165 --> 03:39:28.566]  In two weeks!
[03:39:28.566 --> 03:39:35.652]  As local administrations find their budgets reduced to as much as 40 percent, government salaries have been cut 25 percent.
[03:39:35.652 --> 03:39:37.033]  Two weeks!
[03:39:37.033 --> 03:39:39.515]  Do you know how fast this can happen in America?
[03:39:39.515 --> 03:39:47.022]  Meanwhile, the country's export-driven economy, which burned red-hot at the height of everything going so well, has ground to a halt.
[03:39:47.022 --> 03:39:49.564]  Unemployment has rocketed in Latvia.
[03:39:50.089 --> 03:39:54.311]  Those who have managed to hold on to their jobs are receiving significantly less pay.
[03:39:54.311 --> 03:40:12.561]  And they're predicting that every Eastern European country is going to basically completely collapse, a domino effect into Asia, the Middle East, the United States, and then meanwhile Fox News is blaming it on Russia and saying the Russians want us to collapse in these weird spin articles when Russia has nothing to do with it.
[03:40:12.561 --> 03:40:16.083]  Yeah, and construction, real estate, farming has ground to a halt.
[03:40:17.275 --> 03:40:21.716]  Folks, this is just how fast it can happen in the United States of America.
[03:40:21.716 --> 03:40:23.257]  Don't think that we're alarmists.
[03:40:23.257 --> 03:40:23.717]  We aren't.
[03:40:23.717 --> 03:40:27.038]  We're realists, and we're trying our best to tell you.
[03:40:27.038 --> 03:40:30.679]  I was told seven months ago that this was going to happen.
[03:40:30.679 --> 03:40:32.759]  They had it planned in advance.
[03:40:32.759 --> 03:40:37.961]  He said America will see a financial collapse that will be so great it will take years to come out of it.
[03:40:37.961 --> 03:40:39.121]  Don't think it's going to
[03:40:39.774 --> 03:40:41.555]  Come out in 24 hours.
[03:40:41.555 --> 03:40:45.177]  Our president is not going to bring it out in six months to a year.
[03:40:45.177 --> 03:40:51.021]  This is going to be a long-term thing that you must make preparations for right now.
[03:40:51.021 --> 03:41:01.267]  Already, OPEC has lost, in four months' time, all producing countries of the world, have lost $2.5 trillion in four months' time.
[03:41:01.267 --> 03:41:03.529]  They cannot buy our Treasury bills.
[03:41:03.529 --> 03:41:04.969]  Now, here's the next.
[03:41:04.969 --> 03:41:07.031]  This is the thing that is startling so much.
[03:41:07.031 --> 03:41:09.192]  Whenever you consider that Macy's
[03:41:10.095 --> 03:41:12.696]  Their profit's down 59%.
[03:41:12.696 --> 03:41:14.216]  Target's down 41%.
[03:41:14.216 --> 03:41:15.056]  JCPenney down 41%.
[03:41:15.056 --> 03:41:21.437]  Office Depot lost $1.5 billion in the last quarter.
[03:41:21.437 --> 03:41:33.379]  Now think of all the taxes that would have gone to the federal government and the state governments if these stores had still been doing 100% of business.
[03:41:33.379 --> 03:41:38.080]  Think, 75% of the taxes that come in at the gas pump on the gallon of gasoline
[03:41:38.433 --> 03:41:41.816]  I'm no longer going to the federal government and state governments.
[03:41:41.816 --> 03:42:01.291]  The thing I am so drastically concerned about at this point is every state in America, whenever they figure up their books, which usually takes two to three months for them to catch up with where their bookkeeping is, they are going to realize that they have lost 60 to 70 to 75% depending on the product in the store of their tax structure.
[03:42:01.291 --> 03:42:03.513]  They're not going to be able to support the schools.
[03:42:03.513 --> 03:42:04.974]  I mean, don't go out there and riot.
[03:42:05.644 --> 03:42:08.367]  And say, oh, we ought to have more for our children.
[03:42:08.367 --> 03:42:09.908]  Well, the tax structure's not there.
[03:42:09.908 --> 03:42:11.450]  They want you to play into that.
[03:42:11.450 --> 03:42:13.872]  That's why they're hyping the thing to do is riots.
[03:42:13.872 --> 03:42:18.597]  They have provocateur groups on record, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation funding it.
[03:42:18.597 --> 03:42:22.461]  So when everything implodes, they're going to put us into forced labor camps, officially built.
[03:42:22.461 --> 03:42:24.342]  I'm holding up the Army list of 24 mass camps.
[03:42:25.984 --> 03:42:27.624]  This will hold tens of millions of Americans.
[03:42:27.624 --> 03:42:29.005]  This is not a game.
[03:42:29.005 --> 03:42:30.985]  This is not a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:42:30.985 --> 03:42:34.226]  If you don't say no to this, if you don't realize who the enemy is, it's all over.
[03:42:34.226 --> 03:42:36.727]  Go ahead, CIA, FBI, police, play along.
[03:42:36.727 --> 03:42:38.408]  You're going to ruin your future, too.
[03:42:38.408 --> 03:42:42.509]  It's time to gut up and decide who you're with and who you stand with.
[03:42:42.509 --> 03:42:47.650]  And someone said to me the other day, they said, Pastor Williams, these people live in America.
[03:42:47.650 --> 03:42:48.711]  They said, you know who they are?
[03:42:48.711 --> 03:42:50.471]  I said, yes, I know many of them.
[03:42:50.471 --> 03:42:52.672]  They said, do they live in the United States of America?
[03:42:52.672 --> 03:42:53.552]  I said, most of them do.
[03:42:54.266 --> 03:42:56.988]  They said, well, do they want to destroy their own country?
[03:42:56.988 --> 03:42:59.630]  I said, no, they're not destroying their own country.
[03:42:59.630 --> 03:43:02.492]  They have everything in the world to gain by this.
[03:43:02.492 --> 03:43:04.933]  They are going to hold the banks of America.
[03:43:04.933 --> 03:43:07.675]  They're going to own the lending institutions of America.
[03:43:07.675 --> 03:43:09.817]  They're going to own the mom and pop businesses.
[03:43:09.817 --> 03:43:13.859]  Go to the shopping centers and see how many stores are vacant now.
[03:43:13.859 --> 03:43:15.641]  Look what's happening to the banking system.
[03:43:15.641 --> 03:43:17.582]  They're going to own the real estate of America.
[03:43:17.972 --> 03:43:21.395]  You realize that every mortgage house was mortgaged?
[03:43:21.395 --> 03:43:33.327]  You got your mortgage from some lending institution which now belongs to the elite by way of the Federal Reserve through the Treasury of the United States of America bailing them out and they are going to own the majority of the real estate of America.
[03:43:33.327 --> 03:43:36.369]  They have everything to gain by what they're doing.
[03:43:36.369 --> 03:43:41.074]  David Walker, former Comptroller General of the United States of America, said it so well.
[03:43:41.553 --> 03:43:44.154]  Now, he held the currency for a while until he retired.
[03:43:44.154 --> 03:43:50.015]  He said, America's unfunded liability is $66 trillion.
[03:43:50.015 --> 03:43:54.215]  That includes the national debt, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid.
[03:43:54.215 --> 03:44:00.577]  $66 trillion is more than the GDP, the Gross Domestic Product, of the entire world.
[03:44:00.577 --> 03:44:06.818]  The whole world's GDP is only $65 trillion, and America's unfunded liability is $66 trillion.
[03:44:08.453 --> 03:44:13.195]  And America has more debt than all the rest of the world combined.
[03:44:13.195 --> 03:44:22.059]  America must attract 17% of the world's capital in any given day just to service the debt, the interest on the national debt.
[03:44:22.059 --> 03:44:23.300]  Alex, there is no way out.
[03:44:23.300 --> 03:44:31.663]  I mean, they have it all set so that when it's all over with and the smoke is cleared, if they have their way, they will control this.
[03:44:31.663 --> 03:44:32.844]  But Alex, they're not going to do it.
[03:44:32.844 --> 03:44:35.585]  They're not going to do it because of programs like yours.
[03:44:36.258 --> 03:44:39.121]  And there's one thing that I found that these people fear.
[03:44:39.121 --> 03:44:45.266]  When I lived with them for those three years, they are scared to death of the masses of people in America waking up.
[03:44:45.266 --> 03:44:47.028]  It's the only thing that bothers them.
[03:44:47.028 --> 03:44:48.429]  Everything else is secondary.
[03:44:48.869 --> 03:44:50.851]  And the American people are waking up.
[03:44:50.851 --> 03:44:54.456]  I am amazed at what I'm hearing lately as to how many are taking action.
[03:45:08.872 --> 03:45:20.400]  They've had people secretly for 11 years on these, and now they're just announcing it all, throwing it in everyone's face, and Glenn Beck's making jokes about it like we can trust him, saying he'll look into it, and then giggling and snickering.
[03:45:20.400 --> 03:45:24.662]  I mean, they're being forced to talk about this because everybody's starting to wake up to them.
[03:45:24.662 --> 03:45:25.743]  Yes, they are, exactly.
[03:45:25.743 --> 03:45:31.367]  Now, Alex, would you let me say just a brief word about the two presentations I've just presented?
[03:45:31.367 --> 03:45:32.047]  Absolutely!
[03:45:32.047 --> 03:45:34.769]  In fact, let's do that, but then I want to, because I've got you to the end of the show.
[03:45:34.769 --> 03:45:36.150]  I canceled the other guest, Lindsey.
[03:45:36.150 --> 03:45:37.391]  You can stay another 15 minutes, right?
[03:45:38.379 --> 03:45:39.960]  Okay, yeah, oh, I'd be more than happy.
[03:45:39.960 --> 03:45:40.841]  Consider it a privilege.
[03:45:40.841 --> 03:45:47.747]  Okay, well, all the folks who have time to get a patent paper, and we'll do that at the end of the show, because it's so important that they get this information and spread it to everybody, because you want them to copy it.
[03:45:47.747 --> 03:45:53.952]  But before we do that, again, you're saying that you believe this can at least be blunted and stopped.
[03:45:53.952 --> 03:45:56.915]  If people decide the government's going to save them, they're going to win and get the whole thing away.
[03:45:56.915 --> 03:45:58.976]  I mean, they're going to get away with it.
[03:45:58.976 --> 03:46:02.439]  What do we do to stop them, in your mind, in your research?
[03:46:02.439 --> 03:46:03.400]  What are they most afraid of?
[03:46:03.400 --> 03:46:04.341]  How do we defeat this?
[03:46:05.250 --> 03:46:11.274]  The one thing that will defeat them more than anything else is for the information to be given out, just like you're doing.
[03:46:11.274 --> 03:46:14.376]  Just blast it all across America, every place possible.
[03:46:14.376 --> 03:46:15.397]  Put it on the internet.
[03:46:15.397 --> 03:46:17.358]  You say you're doing another program at night.
[03:46:17.358 --> 03:46:18.519]  Congratulations.
[03:46:18.519 --> 03:46:20.180]  God bless you, Alex.
[03:46:20.180 --> 03:46:21.801]  I appreciate it so much.
[03:46:21.801 --> 03:46:23.862]  Get the message out to the American people.
[03:46:23.862 --> 03:46:25.003]  Now, people are hurting.
[03:46:25.003 --> 03:46:26.063]  Remember one thing.
[03:46:26.063 --> 03:46:29.285]  The most sensitive part of anybody's anatomy is the rear pocket.
[03:46:29.285 --> 03:46:33.028]  And right now, people are hurting where the dollar is.
[03:46:33.633 --> 03:46:38.235]  And they will wake up when, before they wouldn't even listen to you, they're beginning to listen now.
[03:46:38.235 --> 03:46:49.858]  Stock market's down $6,000 and some odd, and they're hurting to the point that for the first time they'll at least consider us wackos and give us some thought as to the fact that we might be right.
[03:46:49.858 --> 03:46:57.481]  And when you can, when you can document what you're saying, listen, listen to Alex Jones Show every single day so you can document what you're saying.
[03:46:57.481 --> 03:47:00.302]  Be able to prove every point that you give.
[03:47:00.302 --> 03:47:01.382]  Then you'll have no problem.
[03:47:01.792 --> 03:47:07.356]  Well, things like OPEC just lost two and one-half trillion dollars in four months' time.
[03:47:07.356 --> 03:47:11.799]  Well, things such as the tax structure of the United States of America is in jeopardy.
[03:47:11.799 --> 03:47:19.564]  And wait 30 days from now, and when the states finally figure up their books and realize where they are, you have never seen such cuts yet.
[03:47:19.564 --> 03:47:29.331]  Listen, give these things that you're hearing on Alex Jones Show, and, you know, things are happening so fast, Alex, I'm glad that you punctuated a moment ago how quickly they're happening.
[03:47:29.656 --> 03:47:32.377]  Because people must listen to your show every day.
[03:47:32.377 --> 03:47:35.998]  This is an emergency situation!
[03:47:35.998 --> 03:47:41.419]  It's the people that did the Bolshevik Revolution and funded Hitler and Mao.
[03:47:41.419 --> 03:47:43.699]  Rockefeller wrote the New York Times and they funded Mao and did all that.
[03:47:43.699 --> 03:47:45.260]  They're doing it here!
[03:47:45.260 --> 03:47:49.561]  They destroy economy to come in with FEMA camps, re-education, mass murder.
[03:47:49.561 --> 03:47:52.062]  They're going to do it if they think the cops will go along with it!
[03:47:52.062 --> 03:47:53.282]  It's over, police!
[03:47:53.282 --> 03:47:55.162]  You can't suck your thumbs anymore!
[03:47:55.162 --> 03:47:56.683]  Decide who you're with.
[03:47:56.683 --> 03:47:57.583]  Lindsey, please continue.
[03:47:58.291 --> 03:48:00.773]  They create a problem, then they create a solution.
[03:48:00.773 --> 03:48:02.574]  This is the way that they do everything.
[03:48:02.574 --> 03:48:05.237]  I watched them do it on the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline.
[03:48:05.237 --> 03:48:15.985]  They would come in and give a few million dollars to the Sierra Club and to other groups that were costing them thousands of dollars.
[03:48:15.985 --> 03:48:19.968]  And I asked one of the oil men one day, I said, why do you give this to your enemies?
[03:48:19.968 --> 03:48:24.992]  The very people that are coming in and causing you to have to spend so much on this Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline.
[03:48:24.992 --> 03:48:26.814]  He said, Chaplain, we play both sides.
[03:48:27.284 --> 03:48:35.808]  They play Republican, they play Democrat, they play the Conservatives, they can play both sides of everything.
[03:48:35.808 --> 03:48:39.070]  They said, we give these money to them so we can control them.
[03:48:39.070 --> 03:48:41.571]  The name of the game is control.
[03:48:41.571 --> 03:48:44.872]  You've heard me say it, you've heard Alex say it over and over and over.
[03:48:44.872 --> 03:48:46.053]  This is what they want.
[03:48:46.053 --> 03:48:48.734]  It's not necessarily money that they're after.
[03:48:48.734 --> 03:48:54.237]  They already hold that through the Federal Reserve, through the fake currencies around the world.
[03:48:54.676 --> 03:48:56.398]  The name of the game is control.
[03:48:56.398 --> 03:49:01.382]  Same thing Hitler did, same thing Mussolini did, same thing Stalin did.
[03:49:01.382 --> 03:49:05.126]  It's a matter of control of masses of population and humanity.
[03:49:05.126 --> 03:49:06.447]  They're literally obsessed.
[03:49:06.926 --> 03:49:10.028]  With the control of this nation, and that's what they're trying to do.
[03:49:10.028 --> 03:49:12.889]  That's why the elites have always been in control.
[03:49:12.889 --> 03:49:20.073]  The elites have always been in control, because they're ruthless and cunning, and the average person doesn't understand how serious the power elite are.
[03:49:20.073 --> 03:49:20.974]  Lindsey, I want to come back.
[03:49:26.977 --> 03:49:30.780]  Again, I want you to specifically why you think George Soros went public with all of this right now.
[03:49:30.780 --> 03:49:34.222]  But first, folks, we don't have a lot of time, so listen carefully.
[03:49:34.222 --> 03:49:38.746]  You're now putting out weekly emergency DVD reports that break down this.
[03:49:38.746 --> 03:49:40.347]  Perfect to give people.
[03:49:40.347 --> 03:49:42.949]  How do folks call and get that, Lindsey?
[03:49:42.949 --> 03:49:43.629]  Call number 800-321-8000.
[03:49:46.255 --> 03:49:48.615]  2-9-0-0 emergency update.
[03:49:48.615 --> 03:49:52.796]  We're having to update it every so many weeks because things are happening so fast.
[03:49:52.796 --> 03:49:56.457]  And then last week, I produced, for the first time, one entitled Prophecy.
[03:49:56.457 --> 03:49:57.657]  You've got to see it.
[03:49:57.657 --> 03:49:59.658]  I deal with the prophecy that this man gave.
[03:49:59.658 --> 03:50:05.279]  I call it a prophecy because, you know, the elite, even though they aren't God, they think they are.
[03:50:05.279 --> 03:50:11.160]  And they give some things, like this gentleman gave me seven months ago, told me everything that was going to happen for the next year and a half.
[03:50:12.153 --> 03:50:22.241]  And I produced one entitled Prophecy because it's what he said was going to happen, and then I go back to the scriptures and compare this to the one page... Give the number!
[03:50:22.241 --> 03:50:23.042]  Give the number!
[03:50:23.042 --> 03:50:23.903]  ...and it was always right.
[03:50:23.903 --> 03:50:25.764]  Give the number for folks.
[03:50:25.764 --> 03:50:30.308]  And the number is 800, the number at toll-free, 800-321-2900.
[03:50:30.308 --> 03:50:34.712]  Two presentations I've done in the last few weeks, plus the package of two DVDs.
[03:50:34.712 --> 03:50:36.813]  I beg of you, for the sake of your dinner table, 800.
[03:50:38.158 --> 03:50:41.900]  3-2-1-2-9-0-0.
[03:50:41.900 --> 03:50:43.800]  Absolutely, and we appreciate your courage doing this.
[03:50:43.800 --> 03:50:45.421]  Okay, briefly, start getting into Soros.
[03:50:45.421 --> 03:50:52.884]  I mean, to have him admit they're imploding the oil price to bankrupt the planet and their enemies, I mean, again, this is six and a half months after you go public.
[03:50:52.884 --> 03:50:53.824]  Here they are admitting it.
[03:50:53.824 --> 03:50:55.285]  It's incredible.
[03:50:55.285 --> 03:50:57.246]  Well, I don't think he had insurance.
[03:50:57.246 --> 03:50:59.106]  Alex, you say, why did he do it?
[03:50:59.106 --> 03:51:03.208]  I think he did it because it happened.
[03:51:03.208 --> 03:51:04.329]  It's here.
[03:51:04.329 --> 03:51:05.329]  He knows it's for real.
[03:51:05.848 --> 03:51:15.854]  There was no need in trying to hide it any longer, and I think he did it solely because of the fact that he didn't have any choice but to do it, or make his own self look bad.
[03:51:15.854 --> 03:51:18.816]  That's what Bob Chapman said, agreeing with you last hour about it.
[03:51:18.816 --> 03:51:19.796]  They've dropped the hammer.
[03:51:19.796 --> 03:51:20.937]  They've gone to the point of no return.
[03:51:20.937 --> 03:51:27.741]  They've committed so many public crimes, looting with the banks, that either they take over with the world government, or they end up getting brought to justice.
[03:51:27.741 --> 03:51:28.542]  They know that.
[03:51:28.542 --> 03:51:33.985]  They know they're creating a revolution, which will create a crisis, exacerbate their crisis, and they'll come in and smash
[03:51:34.005 --> 03:51:35.026]  We're good to go.
[03:52:01.906 --> 03:52:07.849]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[03:52:07.849 --> 03:52:12.871]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[03:52:12.871 --> 03:52:18.053]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[03:52:18.053 --> 03:52:21.495]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[03:52:21.975 --> 03:52:30.502]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[03:52:30.502 --> 03:52:36.306]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[03:52:36.306 --> 03:52:42.291]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:52:42.291 --> 03:52:44.613]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[03:52:44.873 --> 03:52:47.537]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment?

[03:55:09.369 --> 03:55:14.316]  Lindsay, I don't know how busy you are, but I want to set you up for a show you've never been on, my syndicated Sunday show.
[03:55:15.555 --> 03:55:20.518]  Briefly, can you come on this Sunday for an hour and a half so we can talk more about this and finally take calls?
[03:55:20.518 --> 03:55:24.340]  Alex, I would consider it a privilege to do it.
[03:55:24.340 --> 03:55:26.542]  Alright, we're live 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:55:26.542 --> 03:55:26.942]  Central.
[03:55:26.942 --> 03:55:30.864]  Let's have you on from 4.30 Central to 6, an hour and a half on the show.
[03:55:30.864 --> 03:55:34.246]  I'm going to call this number 4.30 on Sunday.
[03:55:34.246 --> 03:55:35.227]  We will talk to you.
[03:55:35.227 --> 03:55:36.828]  I said we go to calls and the timer ran out.
[03:55:36.828 --> 03:55:40.770]  I'm going to try to jam in a few here, but just ask a question of Lindsey's, you can briefly answer it.
[03:55:40.770 --> 03:55:42.391]  Okay, I'm only taking one or two of these.
[03:55:42.391 --> 03:55:43.692]  Steve in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:55:43.692 --> 03:55:43.992]  Go ahead.
[03:55:46.772 --> 03:55:49.293]  Hey, Alex, and hey, Pastor.
[03:55:49.293 --> 03:55:50.733]  Can you hear me?
[03:55:50.733 --> 03:55:52.253]  Yes.
[03:55:52.253 --> 03:55:52.753]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:55:52.753 --> 03:56:05.516]  Yeah, I was watching the news today, and I saw Gordon Brown addressing the Congress the same way that Obama did last week, with Biden behind him to the right, Pelosi to the left behind him.
[03:56:05.516 --> 03:56:14.018]  And he pretty much sold the Congress, and really everybody watching, everything but a vacuum cleaner, and announced everything, including a new
[03:56:14.775 --> 03:56:16.877]  I'm so glad that you mentioned global currency.
[03:56:16.877 --> 03:56:20.400]  It's my contention that they're going to bypass the North American Union and the Amero
[03:56:40.640 --> 03:56:42.702]  And we'll go directly to a global currency.
[03:56:42.702 --> 03:56:44.064]  That's just my opinion.
[03:56:44.064 --> 03:56:50.671]  This person did not say that to me back in July, but it looks that they have jumped, literally leaped into the future.
[03:56:50.671 --> 03:56:54.515]  All right, Lindsey, I'm going to talk to you for an hour and a half Sunday, 4.30 to 6 p.m.
[03:56:54.515 --> 03:56:57.037]  The last hour and a half of the two-hour Sunday show.
[03:56:57.037 --> 03:56:58.799]  We'll be calling you at this number, sir.
[03:56:58.799 --> 03:56:59.620]  I will see you then.
[03:56:59.620 --> 03:57:00.101]  God bless you.
[03:57:00.748 --> 03:57:02.190]  Thank you, Alex, and likewise.
[03:57:02.190 --> 03:57:06.516]  Lord bless you greatly, because you are such a voice out there and a watchman on the wall.
[03:57:06.516 --> 03:57:08.139]  Well, how would we not do what we do?
[03:57:08.139 --> 03:57:11.203]  I mean, we're just telling the truth and we know what's happening, so you too, my friend.
[03:57:11.203 --> 03:57:11.724]  God bless you.
[03:57:11.724 --> 03:57:12.044]  Take care.
[03:57:12.955 --> 03:57:15.577]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can't get to everybody else.
[03:57:15.577 --> 03:57:18.859]  Kevin and Joy and Mark and Jay and everybody else.
[03:57:18.859 --> 03:57:20.440]  We're just out of time for this transmission.
[03:57:20.440 --> 03:57:27.764]  Jason Burmiss is coming up tonight, 9 to midnight, here on the Genesis Network and streaming at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv to be able to view it.
[03:57:27.764 --> 03:57:28.805]  Please spread the word about that.
[03:57:28.805 --> 03:57:31.086]  I'm up here at night a lot, so I pop in on the show as well.
[03:57:31.086 --> 03:57:32.487]  A lot of important, informative guests there.
[03:57:32.487 --> 03:57:41.792]  I just want to bring him up for a minute and a half at the end of the show because, yes, it funds this operation, but it's a great deal and we need more capital to operate, but really not much comes in, you know, as
[03:57:42.813 --> 03:57:45.555]  Yeah, right now Frank's at $220, British Sovereign's at $262, Franklin Have's at $869.
[03:58:09.938 --> 03:58:14.420]  All those are really good buy, Alex, and you're just exactly right on the money on that.
[03:58:14.420 --> 03:58:35.349]  Unemployment figures came out, the markets, the gold, the bank stocks, I mean, everything out there is just turmoil and trouble, and this is one of those opportunities that, you know, we've always talked about it, how I'm buying low, holding on to it, the market goes up, and I get a chance to sell it at a discount to the higher prices there.
[03:58:35.349 --> 03:58:38.370]  Right now is one of those times where I'm in there just accumulating all I can.
[03:58:38.786 --> 03:58:46.950]  I'm smart enough to know that the economic problems of the United States of America have not been solved, and now is the time to be buying hands down.
[03:58:46.950 --> 03:58:48.971]  Oh yeah, they're inflating the currency like gangbusters.
[03:58:48.971 --> 03:58:51.192]  The banks are teetering and imploding all around us.
[03:58:51.192 --> 03:58:51.852]  Folks, give them a call.
[03:58:51.852 --> 03:58:52.952]  You can't beat these deals.
[03:58:52.952 --> 03:58:55.394]  You also have the silver dollars at an insane price.
[03:58:55.394 --> 03:58:56.634]  The silver half dollars.
[03:58:56.634 --> 03:58:57.354]  Yep, sure do.
[03:58:57.354 --> 03:58:58.275]  Yep, we sure do.
[03:58:58.575 --> 03:58:59.196]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:59.196 --> 03:59:00.937]  800-686-2237.
[03:59:00.937 --> 03:59:04.040]  Here's that number.
[03:59:04.040 --> 03:59:05.481]  It'll be there till midnight tonight.
[03:59:05.481 --> 03:59:07.303]  Central Standard Time on those deals you just heard.
[03:59:07.303 --> 03:59:10.406]  Take advantage of it or you're insane, in my opinion.
[03:59:10.406 --> 03:59:12.068]  800-686-2237.
[03:59:12.068 --> 03:59:14.310]  Ted Anderson, thank you for joining us.
[03:59:14.310 --> 03:59:15.431]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[03:59:15.751 --> 03:59:17.172]  You bet.
[03:59:17.172 --> 03:59:19.354]  We're going to go into the first hour and second hour today.
[03:59:19.354 --> 03:59:26.661]  I did a devastating analysis of the FEMA camps with the video clips, the documents, the counter to Glenn Beck and his whitewashing while acting like he's a patriot.
[03:59:26.661 --> 03:59:31.785]  Key info coming up in the retransmission right now at InfoWars.com on the audio streams.
[03:59:31.785 --> 03:59:33.007]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[03:59:33.007 --> 03:59:35.108]  Then Burma's 9 to midnight tonight central.
[03:59:35.108 --> 03:59:36.390]  God bless you all.
[03:59:36.390 --> 03:59:39.532]  We'll see you at PrisonPlanet.tv in the Obama deception, March 15th.
