[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:23.080]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.080 --> 00:31.680]  man this world is getting crazier and crazier by the minute we are going to
[00:31.680 --> 00:37.840]  attempt to cover it all as the private banking cartel known as the New World
[00:37.840 --> 00:48.000]  Order launches offensives against every pillar of a free society the currency
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.240]  the family private property our health everything under assault by these
[00:54.240 --> 01:00.920]  individuals in their constant seeking for complete domination over land air and
[01:00.920 --> 01:08.400]  sea and most importantly inside our minds as the globalist lust after total
[01:08.400 --> 01:13.520]  control of the planet total control over all thoughts and technology so that they
[01:13.520 --> 01:17.920]  can enjoy the life extension systems that have been developed for themselves and
[01:17.920 --> 01:23.520]  so the rest of us can be damned off from it and kept from having access to it so
[01:23.520 --> 01:30.720]  we can then be orderly exterminated this is the stated program and pogrom of the
[01:30.720 --> 01:34.800]  New World Order against free humanity and we're going to be breaking it down
[01:34.800 --> 01:41.720]  today now Dr. Jerome Corsi who has been covering probably more than anybody
[01:41.720 --> 01:48.000]  other than judicial watch with foyer request and inside sources the merger
[01:48.000 --> 01:54.040]  of North America into the EU will be joining us coming up in the next hour
[01:54.040 --> 01:58.520]  and also want to raise the Ottawa Citizen and other news articles where
[01:58.520 --> 02:02.720]  they're just calmly saying yes and foreign troops will patrol Canada the
[02:02.720 --> 02:10.200]  US and Mexico it's no big deal and they do it where they just throw something so
[02:10.200 --> 02:14.720]  massive and so important right out there in the open and and try to just
[02:14.720 --> 02:20.280]  condition us to accept it so we'll also talk about that with Dr. Jerome Corsi
[02:20.280 --> 02:27.240]  coming up in the second hour today and you know sometimes I go six eight months
[02:27.240 --> 02:30.520]  without having Lindsay Williams on but lately I've been having him on almost
[02:30.520 --> 02:37.760]  every week in the last month because he did call it and my crew had said they
[02:37.760 --> 02:41.680]  were going to work on it but I haven't asked him if they have were we able to
[02:41.680 --> 02:48.200]  pull up the October interview with him where he predicted we didn't predict his
[02:48.200 --> 02:51.760]  source told him that in the new year the Middle East would explode and oil would
[02:51.760 --> 02:57.320]  go to 150 to 200 within six months to a year and of course it's not just like
[02:57.320 --> 03:01.920]  you know Lindsay called it that one time he called it repeatedly before that he's
[03:01.920 --> 03:07.280]  going to be coming on the last hour to take your phone call specifically Lindsay
[03:07.280 --> 03:13.200]  Williams coming on to take your phone calls in the third hour today and again
[03:13.200 --> 03:18.400]  my guys and gal in there that they volunteered I said I don't have the
[03:18.400 --> 03:22.040]  staff I said listeners we wrote articles about it but you ought to go pull up
[03:22.040 --> 03:24.840]  from the October interview it's on YouTube with Lindsay Williams and pull
[03:24.840 --> 03:29.720]  that out for us listeners and post it and my crew said no we'll we'll get
[03:29.720 --> 03:35.880]  that so I I do want to kind of scare that up by the time that Williams comes
[03:35.880 --> 03:39.720]  on because it's one thing to come on air and say he said all this I remember
[03:39.720 --> 03:43.760]  saying it you do as well but it's another thing to actually play it so you
[03:43.760 --> 03:49.760]  can hear it on record so we're gonna work on that I just remembered that here
[03:49.760 --> 03:55.560]  on air as I was beginning to speak here at the start of the transmission now
[03:55.560 --> 03:58.960]  there's a lot of issues I want to talk about in the meantime before Dr. Corsi
[03:58.960 --> 04:06.720]  joins us and before Lindsay Williams joins us and one of the big ones out of
[04:06.720 --> 04:13.200]  the gates is the unions and what's happening in Wisconsin and what's now
[04:13.200 --> 04:17.920]  spreading in Michigan people taking over the Capitol there because so many
[04:17.920 --> 04:23.200]  people email me and call me and write comments and they don't understand what
[04:23.200 --> 04:29.400]  I'm talking about I mean it's kind of like when I describe how gold and silver
[04:29.400 --> 04:34.480]  is a hedge against inflation people send me emails saying but then I'll have to
[04:34.480 --> 04:39.680]  cash it in for dollars later yeah but your gold will keep its value so when
[04:39.680 --> 04:43.120]  the dollars devalued when you cash the gold in you'll get more dollars back
[04:43.120 --> 04:46.520]  than what it took for you to buy the gold and people just say I don't understand
[04:46.520 --> 04:51.480]  that I don't understand it it's like two plus two equals four it's the same
[04:51.480 --> 04:54.600]  thing with these unions all I'm gonna try to break it down the other side it's
[04:54.600 --> 04:58.920]  as clear as the nose on my face your face I know the general audience
[04:58.920 --> 05:02.560]  understands but some don't this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[05:02.560 --> 05:07.000]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.040]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[05:11.040 --> 05:14.920]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[05:14.920 --> 05:18.960]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[05:18.960 --> 05:23.360]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[05:23.360 --> 05:27.520]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.520 --> 05:31.320]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.320 --> 05:34.920]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:34.920 --> 05:39.280]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:39.280 --> 05:42.440]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[05:42.440 --> 05:46.120]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[06:05.560 --> 06:09.600]  caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're seeing the impact right
[06:09.600 --> 06:13.360]  here in the United States ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use
[06:13.360 --> 06:18.360]  and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February and pump prices are expected to
[06:18.360 --> 06:23.040]  reach $5 a gallon because of shipping costs food is being priced out of the
[06:23.040 --> 06:27.840]  reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days

[08:08.640 --> 08:16.240]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[08:16.240 --> 08:30.680]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones we are live it is Wednesday
[08:30.680 --> 08:38.920]  the ninth day of March 2011 we're gonna be live here obviously for the next three
[08:38.920 --> 08:44.200]  hours Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us on the fact that the North American Union never
[08:44.200 --> 08:48.880]  went away it's being integrated by stealth and now Obama has continued the
[08:48.880 --> 08:58.160]  continuity of agenda with Clinton and George W. Bush right through to Obama
[08:58.160 --> 09:02.320]  today and it's in high gear then when we of course we have Lindsay Williams
[09:02.320 --> 09:07.680]  joining us don't forget he did say and we have found the clip back from what
[09:07.680 --> 09:16.800]  was it October 20th October 21st of last year where he specifically over and
[09:16.800 --> 09:24.520]  over again said his source former head of a big three oil company said on record
[09:24.520 --> 09:29.360]  on record to Lindsay and Lindsay put it on record here that it would go to a
[09:29.360 --> 09:37.560]  hundred fifty two hundred dollars a barrel within six months to a year on
[09:37.560 --> 09:42.920]  the name of the video that has it all broken down from the 21st of October
[09:42.920 --> 09:45.800]  last year as crude oil is going to a hundred fifty two hundred dollars a
[09:45.800 --> 09:53.480]  barrel Lindsay Williams predictions Alex Jones and this was uploaded to
[09:53.480 --> 10:01.440]  Planet Earth Awaken 01 on YouTube October 21st 2010 the day it happened so
[10:01.440 --> 10:06.800]  we're gonna be playing that later when Lindsay joins us let me just give you a
[10:06.800 --> 10:12.600]  smattering of some of the news and information that's here in front of me
[10:12.600 --> 10:20.840]  and then I will get specifically into the unions and what's happening on that
[10:20.840 --> 10:28.120]  front but Saudi Arabia's Day of Rage lures record bets on $200 a barrel oil
[10:28.120 --> 10:32.600]  and they're betting on that for June delivery so that's what the majority of
[10:32.600 --> 10:39.240]  the bets are is that oil is going to be $200 a barrel in June that would make
[10:39.240 --> 10:44.840]  Williams prediction of six months for it to be in full swing absolute
[10:44.840 --> 10:51.480]  precision continuing here's the London Telegraph that was Bloomberg oil market
[10:51.480 --> 11:01.040]  braces for Saudi rage as global spare capacity wears thin oil hovers at around
[11:01.040 --> 11:06.240]  105 right now but futures for just in the next two weeks have it at about 120
[11:06.240 --> 11:14.120]  or higher on average between 114 and 122 and depending on what type of crude it
[11:14.120 --> 11:17.960]  is and where it's being delivered from so that's just some of what we're gonna
[11:17.960 --> 11:21.600]  be covering we've got a lot of news obviously with what's going on in
[11:21.600 --> 11:26.360]  Libya you know that it's been proven that Gaddafi was not strafing crowds of
[11:26.360 --> 11:32.040]  unarmed people that he did not flee to Venezuela three weeks ago and he is not
[11:32.040 --> 11:38.240]  the missing member of the Brady bunch or a sleet stack from land of the lost more
[11:38.240 --> 11:43.880]  and more people realize we're being given total fantasy out of the North
[11:43.880 --> 11:49.320]  African country and that the globalists want that biggest oil supply in Africa
[11:49.320 --> 11:53.880]  for themselves so they can shut it down and create artificial scarcity and make
[11:53.880 --> 11:59.840]  even bigger profits and have a post industrial world in some of the other
[11:59.840 --> 12:06.880]  news Obama creates indefinite detention system for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay
[12:06.880 --> 12:15.720]  and if you read the executive order he signed on Monday and major law universities
[12:15.720 --> 12:20.040]  constitutional law scholars have read over the order and I've read it as well
[12:20.040 --> 12:23.800]  and it doesn't take a rocket scientist it clearly states that indefinite
[12:23.800 --> 12:29.960]  detention can be done to US citizens there's no court if the Pentagon or any
[12:29.960 --> 12:34.320]  adjunct of the president wishes to grab a citizen put a bag over your head you
[12:34.320 --> 12:39.800]  can disappear forever and be tortured to death or put before a secret tribunal
[12:39.800 --> 12:47.360]  and basically executed or imprisoned for life and so you notice we told you an
[12:47.360 --> 12:52.160]  Obama deception that he was not going to shut down Guantanamo Bay again
[12:52.160 --> 12:57.320]  everything Obama says is a lie everything is a double-cross everything is a
[12:57.320 --> 13:02.760]  fraud everything is a foil and a deception within a scam within a lie
[13:02.760 --> 13:09.760]  within a camouflage deceit within a shill wheels within wheels lies within
[13:09.760 --> 13:14.320]  lies and so you can't listen to what they say you've got to look at what they
[13:14.320 --> 13:22.320]  do and then that's crystal total unity total continuity of agenda from the
[13:22.320 --> 13:27.560]  time at JFK had his head blown off in 1963 there was plenty of corruption
[13:27.560 --> 13:32.160]  before that but the military industrial complex said look we overthrow third
[13:32.160 --> 13:37.120]  world countries we kill whoever we want we shoot little kids up worldwide with
[13:37.120 --> 13:42.120]  polio we're black ops we're death we're murder we run this country we're
[13:42.120 --> 13:46.600]  foreign bank mercenaries and we killed the president in broad daylight we run
[13:46.600 --> 13:51.600]  this country now now sit down and shut up and then they came in with big
[13:51.600 --> 13:55.440]  government invested your pension funds and offshore banks and they've taken all
[13:55.440 --> 13:59.320]  of that the derivatives and they're gonna take your health care and they're
[13:59.320 --> 14:03.160]  gonna forcibly shoot you up with cancer-filled vaccines and they're gonna
[14:03.160 --> 14:06.800]  give you a bunch of red white and blue packaging on it and most of you are
[14:06.800 --> 14:11.640]  gonna fall down on your knees guzzle fluoride inject your children and roll
[14:11.640 --> 14:16.720]  over and enjoy the early death I understand that fully you're gonna
[14:16.720 --> 14:22.440]  gibber and laugh like arrested development monkeys Howard Stern listeners
[14:22.440 --> 14:27.400]  every one as you go off the cliff straight into Valhalla so knock
[14:27.400 --> 14:33.200]  yourselves out as for me and my house we know what's going on we've been right
[14:33.200 --> 14:39.520]  across the board we've studied history and we are firing up the cadres the
[14:39.520 --> 14:45.680]  powerful remnant a lot more than 5% that the revolutionary forebearers had we got
[14:45.680 --> 14:51.000]  probably more like 15% to bring in the big W against the New World Order but we
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.160]  realize how serious it is and that we don't have a choice we got to go all the
[14:55.160 --> 15:01.120]  way for the big win and it's gonna be boldness it's gonna be focus it's going
[15:01.120 --> 15:06.680]  to be dedication and commitment and fearlessness and accuracy and
[15:06.680 --> 15:11.840]  understanding and true discernment that's gonna carry us out of this and
[15:11.840 --> 15:18.520]  we've got to rely and throw ourselves in the providence of God God wants to help
[15:18.520 --> 15:22.640]  us but we got to help ourselves first and show we've got the courage you throw
[15:22.640 --> 15:27.120]  yourself in front of the train you stand up against Goliath God will guide you
[15:27.120 --> 15:31.680]  ladies and gentlemen but not until you take the field it is not until you take
[15:31.680 --> 15:37.760]  the field that you will feel yourself connected literally to the energy of the
[15:37.760 --> 15:43.040]  universe once you take the field once you step out on the plate once you make
[15:43.040 --> 15:49.520]  that commitment that I have a tiger commitment that you are going 110% as
[15:49.520 --> 15:54.520]  soon as you step through that doorway as soon as you get past your fear you will
[15:54.520 --> 15:58.880]  truly be alive and you will stop being flotsam and jetsam that can just be
[15:58.880 --> 16:07.000]  manipulated at nauseam at the globalist leisure but it it it takes getting rid of
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.640]  some of your preconceived notions and the mental symbols that you've been
[16:11.640 --> 16:17.240]  pre-programmed with myself included I constantly say our military our government
[16:17.240 --> 16:22.160]  it's not our military oh our citizens are in it many of them good people being
[16:22.160 --> 16:28.440]  used being mind control with the false political projection hologram pushed
[16:28.440 --> 16:33.720]  into their minds by propaganda but it's not our military it's not our government
[16:33.720 --> 16:38.160]  we have to admit America fell a long time ago we have to admit we've been
[16:38.160 --> 16:43.040]  hijacked and overtaken that the government isn't corrupt that was a
[16:43.040 --> 16:48.400]  long time ago that it was corrupt the government is completely taken over and
[16:48.400 --> 16:56.880]  I use the analogy of John Carpenter's 1982 or 83 the thing they dig it up in the
[16:56.880 --> 17:07.640]  snow crash-flying saucer you know the Norwegians do and the American base
[17:07.640 --> 17:12.080]  it goes out and checks out the Norwegian base and basically everybody's dead but
[17:12.080 --> 17:16.360]  there's this deformed creature in the snow that's been partially burned they
[17:16.360 --> 17:20.960]  bring it back to their base and it thaws out and starts basically overtaking
[17:20.960 --> 17:26.640]  members of the Arctic party or the Antarctic party and absorbing them and
[17:26.640 --> 17:33.520]  once it's absorbed somebody you can perfectly mimic them but it doesn't
[17:33.520 --> 17:39.640]  mean it's that person well this thing doesn't even mimic our Republic it is
[17:39.640 --> 17:44.660]  tyranny incarnate it follows every rule of tyranny it announces itself as
[17:44.660 --> 17:49.120]  brazen tyranny because the psychological warfare chiefs made the
[17:49.120 --> 17:53.680]  decision to hide it in plain view and to not try to shield it anymore because
[17:53.680 --> 17:58.560]  they want to go full bore so they need to break our will and condition us and
[17:58.560 --> 18:06.800]  push the envelope so we accept it so we're here we're here right now we're
[18:06.800 --> 18:11.080]  going into very deep tyranny we know exactly where this leads we have the
[18:11.080 --> 18:14.440]  historical roadmap we have the globalist own statements about where
[18:14.440 --> 18:23.080]  they're taking us and it's hellish and our government's gone it's not corrupt I
[18:23.080 --> 18:30.040]  mean it is corrupt but that's not enough of a word it's fully unconstitutional
[18:30.040 --> 18:35.600]  it's fully illegitimate it's fully criminal and the few good apples in the
[18:35.600 --> 18:41.240]  rotten barrel like Ron Paul are demonized at infinitum by the liberal
[18:41.240 --> 18:45.120]  media the conservative media they're ignored as they enter the election cycle
[18:45.120 --> 18:49.440]  the media won't even report that he won the straw poll I hear so-called
[18:49.440 --> 18:53.440]  conservative radio news every day talking about Republican leading
[18:53.440 --> 18:59.080]  contenders never mentioning Ron Paul and again that's just one example of how
[18:59.080 --> 19:04.440]  they enjoy most these people in the media love selling out they don't even have
[19:04.440 --> 19:08.840]  to be given orders they just know to sell out and play the party line and they
[19:08.840 --> 19:17.280]  feel like winners sitting there nesting in their IRN you know radio news and in
[19:17.280 --> 19:22.360]  their Fox news and the rest of it getting off on the power of deceiving
[19:22.360 --> 19:28.960]  biomission getting off on keeping people from real solutions they like it they
[19:28.960 --> 19:37.320]  enjoy it like a moth thinks it's winning when it flies into a flame all

[19:41.440 --> 19:48.120]  headlines here and then I'm going to get into the two plus two equals four it's

[24:50.400 --> 24:56.720]  arrogant a public under narcissistic mind control being reduced down the level
[24:56.720 --> 25:01.440]  of demonic five-year-olds unable to critically think reveling in their own

[25:07.080 --> 25:13.160]  like nothing but debased horse oh we're gonna be breaking down international
[25:13.160 --> 25:17.600]  women's day how much the UN cares about women and women kind of look at the
[25:17.600 --> 25:23.200]  surface of it go go girl girls team yeah girls team the truth is there are no
[25:23.200 --> 25:29.200]  women there are no men there is homo sapien sapien the combined grouping and
[25:29.200 --> 25:33.600]  when they attack a woman or a man they attack us all we're under attack the new
[25:33.600 --> 25:37.800]  world order isn't an empire that just attacks countries it attacks the
[25:37.800 --> 25:43.640]  individual it attacks language it attacks speech it attacks intelligence
[25:43.640 --> 25:52.840]  because it is an extermination system it is a full spectrum dominance death
[25:52.840 --> 26:00.720]  machine unleashed and we're only in the middle phases of its unfolding system of
[26:00.720 --> 26:05.120]  total grid control when the grid is completed and we're approaching that
[26:05.120 --> 26:10.240]  point then the rollout exterminations will begin through controlled bio weapon
[26:10.240 --> 26:16.000]  releases that will be blamed on accidents but also on terrorists the tens of
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.080]  thousands that die in the first waves will be used as martyrs to set up highly
[26:20.080 --> 26:25.600]  controlled bio containment grids over cities integrated with the carbon tax
[26:25.600 --> 26:32.720]  control grids as another overlay pretext for total surveillance then a few
[26:32.720 --> 26:36.920]  years after those grids have been put in mass plagues will hit killing hundreds
[26:36.920 --> 26:41.880]  of millions then even greater controls will be put in place then the super
[26:41.880 --> 26:48.280]  megadeth they intend to release a bio weapon and probably only keep five ten
[26:48.280 --> 26:53.800]  thousand people alive they tell their minions and acolytes that that 20% will
[26:53.800 --> 26:58.480]  be left alive that's in the official UN biological diversity assessment 1996
[26:58.480 --> 27:02.840]  club of Rome statements you hear the Ted Turner statements the Jacosta statements
[27:02.840 --> 27:06.560]  because the government minions and bureaucrats and power-tripping computer
[27:06.560 --> 27:09.280]  company owners you know they think they're gonna be on the inside so they
[27:09.280 --> 27:13.240]  say you know for the outer masses that are into the control freak religion of
[27:13.240 --> 27:19.240]  talking about killing the unwashed masses they say 80% kill but when you get
[27:19.240 --> 27:26.040]  into actual academic circles they say 95% and that's it Peter Singer at at
[27:26.040 --> 27:30.800]  Princeton Dr. Pianca UT every university they run all the major departments they
[27:30.800 --> 27:35.080]  always publish books Rockefeller Foundation or UN saying we need global
[27:35.080 --> 27:38.680]  police state to carry out the extermination and then the true acolytes
[27:38.680 --> 27:44.560]  say I am not worthy I am a professor dr. Pianca I am ready to die with my
[27:44.560 --> 27:48.840]  family soon the airborne Ebola will be among us and then his graduate students
[27:48.840 --> 27:51.840]  send me threatening letters and I Google their name and it's them in white
[27:51.840 --> 27:56.960]  lab coats in US government bio weapons facilities hardcore savage death machines
[27:56.960 --> 28:00.640]  ready to kill you and your family and they can't wait and they think you're
[28:00.640 --> 28:04.280]  too weak to understand their attack profile I've given it all to you ladies
[28:04.280 --> 28:07.400]  and gentlemen listen to me police officers military all of you they're
[28:07.400 --> 28:10.600]  gonna murder all of us deader than a hammer you better come in and join the
[28:10.600 --> 28:14.360]  Republic for the big win and we need to deal with these people immediately and
[28:14.360 --> 28:18.880]  build the bases and go off world and there can be a trillion humans we don't
[28:18.880 --> 28:22.880]  have to act like this and let a bunch of degenerate scum run our lives I've had
[28:22.880 --> 28:29.000]  it wake up I demand you break your conditioning because when you get into
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.880]  their higher level literature they say humans are a parasite period and they're
[28:32.880 --> 28:40.440]  gonna kill everybody except for the chosen few that merged with machines they
[28:40.440 --> 28:44.720]  hate creation they hate the natural order they hate the family these are
[28:44.720 --> 28:50.320]  sickos look at the tropism of tyranny how it's always black uniforms torture
[28:50.320 --> 28:55.200]  death-burning cities that's what tyranny manifests these psychopaths that get
[28:55.200 --> 29:01.280]  control in the last 6,000 years of known civilization now you project that for
[29:01.280 --> 29:04.960]  with a high-tech overlay and all the systems they've got what is that spell
[29:04.960 --> 29:11.800]  hellraiser type situation now you have been warned but I'm sick and tired of
[29:11.800 --> 29:15.600]  people's weakness you're strong enough out there if you're conscious of the
[29:15.600 --> 29:19.640]  mind control to break your conditioning now you still got human instincts that
[29:19.640 --> 29:24.400]  took our species this far and a tribal instinctive spiritual level you know
[29:24.400 --> 29:29.000]  you're hearing 100% truth you know that I am here literally the spirit of your
[29:29.000 --> 29:33.800]  ancestors speaking to the spirit of your ancestors right now and demanding that
[29:33.800 --> 29:38.360]  you break your conditioning and that you join humanity for all of our ancestors
[29:38.360 --> 29:42.840]  that fought and sacrificed and bled for us to be here today and that we now make
[29:42.840 --> 29:49.320]  them proud in the universe and that justice bends towards the truth and
[29:49.320 --> 29:55.520]  we're gonna win we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the

[31:05.800 --> 31:11.240]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[31:11.240 --> 31:15.040]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[31:15.040 --> 31:20.120]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[31:20.120 --> 31:25.520]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[31:25.520 --> 31:30.400]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[31:30.400 --> 31:34.800]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[31:34.800 --> 31:38.560]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[31:38.560 --> 31:42.480]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[31:42.480 --> 31:48.040]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[32:00.520 --> 32:03.880]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[32:03.880 --> 32:07.840]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[32:07.840 --> 32:12.080]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[32:12.080 --> 32:16.360]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[32:16.360 --> 32:20.720]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[32:20.720 --> 32:24.800]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[32:24.800 --> 32:29.360]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[32:29.360 --> 32:33.480]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[32:33.480 --> 32:37.480]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[32:37.480 --> 32:41.280]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[32:41.280 --> 32:44.000]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[32:44.000 --> 32:50.000]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[32:50.000 --> 32:54.520]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go

[33:01.360 --> 33:18.840]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central standard time we are here live
[33:18.840 --> 33:26.080]  back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. you heard some of my frustration come through earlier
[33:26.080 --> 33:30.080]  this nightmare doesn't have to happen if we'll just get our survival instincts
[33:30.080 --> 33:35.440]  back and and and and and realize that we're under assault I mean if your
[33:35.440 --> 33:38.200]  neighbor came over and slapped you in the face a neighbor you've known ten
[33:38.200 --> 33:44.520]  years you punch them in the nose but the globalist steal your money try to take
[33:44.520 --> 33:49.640]  your kids away from you brainwash them poison your food your water and then
[33:49.640 --> 33:53.400]  run around with as a bunch of authority figures with cops standing behind them
[33:53.400 --> 33:58.520]  with like ancient you know monkey suits on yeah that's what chiefs wear big
[33:58.520 --> 34:03.560]  ribbons and and crowns to impress people government wear these jackets with all
[34:03.560 --> 34:08.480]  these markings on it just a bunch of primitive monkey behavior and then we
[34:08.480 --> 34:13.280]  bow down to these criminals who were just running all over us I've had it I've
[34:13.280 --> 34:21.280]  had it I'm done and I'm tired of just one-dimensional moronic thinking and
[34:21.280 --> 34:26.360]  people not understanding it's very frustrating now I want to hit some more
[34:26.360 --> 34:32.520]  of the news that's that's that's percolating out there and then I want to
[34:32.520 --> 34:36.520]  break down simply and succinctly I'm gonna try it again because some didn't
[34:36.520 --> 34:44.400]  understand why I'm angry at not just the governor of Wisconsin but also people
[34:44.400 --> 34:48.880]  like Michael Moore because see folks are like but the media says we got to choose
[34:48.880 --> 34:52.360]  aside we got to choose Republican or Democrat we got to choose liberal or
[34:52.360 --> 34:58.280]  conservative we got to choose union or or the governor no no that's only one
[34:58.280 --> 35:05.440]  part of the larger equation stop letting them set the parameters have you heard
[35:05.440 --> 35:09.680]  get outside the box the globalist are all about putting you in smaller and
[35:09.680 --> 35:13.400]  smaller boxes and what's comfortable to talk about and what's comfortable to
[35:13.400 --> 35:17.960]  debate and I see people all the time at restaurants or places having political
[35:17.960 --> 35:21.400]  discussions and they always discuss the most mindless political things and find
[35:21.400 --> 35:24.840]  things they agree on and then sit there and agree with each other and it's
[35:24.840 --> 35:28.840]  always some mindless pap you know some talking point that's been put out for
[35:28.840 --> 35:32.560]  years that they're repeating and feeling like they're big smart political
[35:32.560 --> 35:37.440]  insiders discussing a baseball game or something hey you're not in the baseball
[35:37.440 --> 35:40.600]  team you're not making the ten million dollars a year and you're not in the
[35:40.600 --> 35:45.400]  political process you're discussing it because that political process is rigged
[35:45.400 --> 35:49.160]  the only way to be really involved politically is to know how the game
[35:49.160 --> 35:54.400]  really works okay but you are obsessed and watching projections on the cave
[35:54.400 --> 36:01.240]  wall I go back to Plato's the cave allegory okay go up top see the real
[36:01.240 --> 36:06.200]  world folks not a projection where you're chained up in a cave watching
[36:06.200 --> 36:10.800]  puppet shows okay that's what I'm telling you here there's a whole universe a
[36:10.800 --> 36:16.760]  whole world going on and we allow the control freaks who know how humans
[36:16.760 --> 36:20.920]  operate but instead of using that information to further empower people
[36:20.920 --> 36:27.000]  they don't like that they don't enjoy seeing people enlightened and awakening
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.640]  they like knowing your weaknesses they like pushing your buttons they like
[36:31.640 --> 36:38.120]  pulling your chain it's it's it's to the power of infinity we all work with
[36:38.120 --> 36:44.960]  people know people who who play high school mind games and and and you'll
[36:44.960 --> 36:48.240]  always notice more successful people are just about business and don't really
[36:48.240 --> 36:51.160]  play the mind games but a lot of times you just kind of put up with it because
[36:51.160 --> 36:54.920]  people can't help it most people that play little mind games aren't even aware
[36:54.920 --> 36:58.880]  they're doing it and I guess we all do it to some extent but the globalist
[36:58.880 --> 37:03.000]  consciously play mind games with people and they enjoy punching your buttons
[37:03.000 --> 37:08.480]  they enjoy deceiving you you know what I enjoy I enjoy seeing people wake up and
[37:08.480 --> 37:14.920]  routing these people I want to see unbridled human potential I am a fan of
[37:14.920 --> 37:20.760]  man and Hollywood puts out the devil's advocate where Satan incarnate is a fan
[37:20.760 --> 37:28.280]  of man and believes in humanity what a lie the devil comes to kill steal and
[37:28.280 --> 37:33.320]  destroy even if you don't believe in a physical galactic entity of malevolent
[37:33.320 --> 37:39.200]  destruction the globalist hate beauty their their fetishes that what they're
[37:39.200 --> 37:46.080]  obsessed with is ruining beautiful innocent things they love it well I'll
[37:46.080 --> 37:53.640]  tell you one thing my gut my soul everything I am is turned against them my
[37:53.640 --> 37:59.680]  entire being is focused down on them and it's so frustrating that when you're
[37:59.680 --> 38:05.120]  good but know these secrets you see how worm-like and weak they are and then you
[38:05.120 --> 38:09.920]  watch the world and people that are unconscious selling their souls their
[38:09.920 --> 38:16.120]  name everything they are for ashes for things that don't matter at the end of
[38:16.120 --> 38:23.080]  the day and none of us are perfect all of us fall into that trap look look at the
[38:23.080 --> 38:26.800]  Charlie scene situation Charlie sheen six and a half years ago calls me I'm
[38:26.800 --> 38:30.360]  talking to him three or four months he comes on air for 9-11 truth in early
[38:30.360 --> 38:35.760]  2006 he gets a lot of attention to it because he was well-spoken but also his
[38:35.760 --> 38:40.480]  baggage made the media attack him on it which actually backfired on them and
[38:40.480 --> 38:43.560]  they realize it was backfiring so went from the biggest news story to nothing
[38:43.560 --> 38:48.920]  overnight then I become his friend he's clean he's married he's not involved in
[38:48.920 --> 38:53.520]  drugs then he goes off the rails like a drowning man he says come out and see me
[38:53.520 --> 38:59.360]  I need help I go out there he's off drugs getting clean but the manic phase I
[38:59.360 --> 39:02.080]  get him on the air to say hey let's talk about how you're off drugs and it's
[39:02.080 --> 39:07.640]  positive and then I let him do what he did on air when hindsight I should have
[39:07.640 --> 39:12.080]  stopped it probably and right after it happened I said we better apologize and
[39:12.080 --> 39:15.240]  back off of this I said they're gonna fire you and he said well I don't care
[39:15.240 --> 39:20.160]  if they do but I don't think they will and I said yeah they are man because
[39:20.160 --> 39:25.480]  they can't have you basically standing up against him and and and maybe he's
[39:25.480 --> 39:28.080]  right and what he's doing but now into the stress and the people he's got
[39:28.080 --> 39:32.400]  around him the yes men Charlie doesn't want people right now around him he'll
[39:32.400 --> 39:40.200]  sit there and argue with him but I don't sit there and judge Charlie he is a
[39:40.200 --> 39:44.560]  human like all of us did he kill a million Iraqis is he involved using
[39:44.560 --> 39:48.960]  information to abuse and control people know at his heart he's a good
[39:48.960 --> 39:56.200]  gentlemanly guy everybody that knows him has said that at his core he's a good
[39:56.200 --> 40:06.120]  man but is he lost is he the prodigal son is he gonna come back maybe not but I
[40:06.120 --> 40:11.640]  got to know Charlie and like him as the person but then I could see the power of
[40:11.640 --> 40:15.440]  that Hollywood image that the global issues all those other Hollywood people
[40:15.440 --> 40:22.720]  to push their agendas on the population think what would happen if we had a
[40:22.720 --> 40:27.960]  rebellion of the Hollywood people in that corrupt decadent system against the
[40:27.960 --> 40:33.240]  new world order it could totally turn the tide against the globalist and that's
[40:33.240 --> 40:36.200]  why they do surveil the Hollywood people that's why they are using
[40:36.200 --> 40:41.800]  psychotronic weapons on them that's why they are slipping them mickeys so many
[40:41.800 --> 40:46.360]  Hollywood stars are murdered for the insurance money are murdered by their
[40:46.360 --> 40:54.360]  managers it is a hellish system they live under and so pray for Charlie Sheen
[40:57.120 --> 41:00.840]  in fact I was on coast to coast AM last night they wanted me to come on and
[41:00.840 --> 41:03.680]  talk about Charlie some and then some other issues and I'm gonna get into
[41:03.680 --> 41:07.800]  those in a moment but I mean Charlie is an example of humanity and the highs and
[41:07.800 --> 41:11.680]  lows it can have and I was reading the news about Charlie before I went on and
[41:11.680 --> 41:19.120]  I saw men co-star Holland Taylor defends Charlie Sheen while US television
[41:19.120 --> 41:23.400]  network CBS is keeping mum about Charlie Sheen one of his co-stars has been
[41:23.400 --> 41:27.760]  speaking out and sharing kind words about the embattled actor two and a half
[41:27.760 --> 41:32.400]  men star Holland Taylor defended the actor she has worked with since the show
[41:32.400 --> 41:37.840]  began in 2003 Charlie was cordial and polite with all of the cast all of his
[41:37.840 --> 41:43.440]  cast mates and crew sometimes even courtly and that's how he is unbelievably
[41:43.440 --> 41:49.440]  generous and polite and and and gentlemanly and you know giving homeless
[41:49.440 --> 41:54.240]  people thousand dollar bills and giving money to charity and and and helping
[41:54.240 --> 41:58.960]  people and you know just just incredible but then he's also got a wild side
[41:58.960 --> 42:03.280]  Charlie was cordial and polite with all the cast mates and crew sometimes even
[42:03.280 --> 42:09.320]  courtly and always witty yeah very smart I mean you know all of his all of his
[42:09.320 --> 42:14.200]  antics on these video cast are just him being in their face and it comes off some
[42:14.200 --> 42:20.400]  of his cartoonish in person he's really smart and witty Taylor said Tuesday and
[42:20.400 --> 42:25.040]  email the Associated Press we watch movies at his house occasionally warm
[42:25.040 --> 42:29.760]  evenings with interesting spirited conversation this is the guy I know in
[42:29.760 --> 42:33.400]  this very sad and complicated time I really have no comment she continued
[42:33.400 --> 42:37.760]  beyond valuing my own history with Charlie and my abiding affection for him
[42:37.760 --> 42:48.760]  and that's that's pretty much what I would say I have some frustration that
[42:48.760 --> 42:55.320]  he is so locked in his battle with them and his anger that that he is being
[42:55.320 --> 43:00.960]  over the top pretty much on purpose but it's not an act for the media wondering
[43:00.960 --> 43:03.920]  out there that I'm gonna shift gears but I just want to talk about this
[43:03.920 --> 43:09.240]  briefly it's not an act but it is you know basically he's just letting himself
[43:09.240 --> 43:15.880]  throw it all in their face but I don't know if there's a method to the madness
[43:15.880 --> 43:21.560]  it's like he's on a treadmill and I think the seven months of drugs hurt him at
[43:21.560 --> 43:26.080]  certain levels and kind of destabilized even now he's in a manic phase I just
[43:26.080 --> 43:32.840]  pray to God he doesn't go back on drugs I pray because they are just waiting to
[43:32.840 --> 43:36.600]  destroy him ladies and gentlemen I mean this is a guy who told me in his
[43:36.600 --> 43:41.960]  kitchen six years ago that he was born again Christian and now look at him I
[43:41.960 --> 43:44.560]  told him I'll pray for you the other night and he said what you're gonna
[43:44.560 --> 43:49.000]  pray to your sky god for me and I said man you know there's more going on
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.560]  Horatio in heaven and earth and what's in your books we guys pull up the
[43:53.560 --> 43:56.920]  Shakespeare quote there's more in heaven and earth than in all your books I
[43:56.920 --> 44:01.840]  think it says it to Horatio but I maybe get or I'm forgetting my Shakespeare
[44:01.840 --> 44:13.720]  because I'm still under the weather a bit I mean I feel God I know God I I and
[44:13.720 --> 44:18.600]  and so the Charlie I know in love is the one that has a relationship with God
[44:18.600 --> 44:22.880]  but I can't judge him now and throw him down and say look at you you're bad
[44:22.880 --> 44:28.360]  you're a sinner when I'm probably a bigger sinner in many ways in different
[44:28.360 --> 44:39.760]  ways in my life it's just incredible I don't know what else to say on that front
[44:39.760 --> 44:44.920]  I said I get into the Michael Moore situation and I am going to do that it's
[44:44.920 --> 44:51.960]  from Hamlet and he's talking to Horatio and therefore as a stranger give it
[44:51.960 --> 44:57.000]  welcome there are more things in heaven and earth Horatio that are dreamt of in
[44:57.000 --> 45:09.800]  your philosophy Horatio advised against it barge into Hamlet's conversation with
[45:09.800 --> 45:16.880]  father's ghost see something is rotten in the state of Denmark and I just can't
[45:16.880 --> 45:22.880]  get enough Shakespeare oh my gosh you have you seen Charlton Heston's rendition
[45:22.880 --> 45:32.960]  of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar oh man who language the power and the
[45:32.960 --> 45:38.440]  depth of the language and then you hear something like Howard Stern doing
[45:38.440 --> 45:42.800]  flatulence jokes and it's just it's obscene not that you're shocked by
[45:42.800 --> 45:50.760]  flatulence jokes are shocked by the sexy devil cheerleader once you had it man
[45:50.760 --> 45:58.400]  you realize it's like a dirt sandwich quantum mechanics space travel
[45:58.400 --> 46:08.720]  gardening family children adventures rock climbing deep-sea diving real risk-taking
[46:08.720 --> 46:18.120]  boxing real things a better human that challenge you not just floundering
[46:18.120 --> 46:21.880]  around like a two and a half year old that laughs if you tell him a flatulence
[46:21.880 --> 46:26.520]  joke and I see grown men everywhere that I can't even communicate with and it's
[46:26.520 --> 46:30.800]  almost like idiocracy that Mike judge put out where the guys you know 300 years
[46:30.800 --> 46:34.280]  in the future with the dumbed-down public that can hardly talk and he was
[46:34.280 --> 46:36.960]  kind of a low-grade moron in his day but now he's the smartest guy on the
[46:36.960 --> 46:40.640]  planet and he's in there talking to the judge in plain English trying to defend
[46:40.640 --> 46:45.320]  himself and the judge is going look he knows how to read look he's a you know
[46:45.320 --> 46:51.680]  he's a wimp they're all I mean it's just like what and the technocrats are up
[46:51.680 --> 46:55.480]  there publicly saying okay get the system shut up we're gonna go ahead and
[46:55.480 --> 46:59.240]  wipe these people out the globalists are so arrogant they're like Jones you go
[46:59.240 --> 47:02.560]  ahead and warn them these people are animals we're gonna wipe them out I'm
[47:02.560 --> 47:06.520]  like your animals too look at how the way you live look at what you look at
[47:06.520 --> 47:11.280]  your taste you globalists think you're gonna stop killing when you've wiped us
[47:11.280 --> 47:17.760]  out no there could be two globalists in a high mountain keep 200 years from now
[47:17.760 --> 47:23.240]  with life extension technology through the cybernetic interfaces you really
[47:23.240 --> 47:26.480]  still won't be what you originally were so you're not really living forever but
[47:26.480 --> 47:34.520]  a facsimile a 3d hologram of who you were were will go on an abomination and
[47:34.520 --> 47:40.200]  you could have you know those two entities basically the other two
[47:40.200 --> 47:44.080]  globalists left and they would be trying to kill each other and find out
[47:44.080 --> 47:48.400]  where all the copies of the other were you know spread around the solar system
[47:48.400 --> 47:53.760]  and they'd be having huge factories launching drones into deep space running
[47:53.760 --> 47:57.640]  from the other to seed their consciousness and then and then a trillion
[47:57.640 --> 48:02.520]  year war as they run around trying to destroy the other replicant version of
[48:02.520 --> 48:07.680]  the other I mean this is what's going on this is what they talk about this is
[48:07.680 --> 48:14.800]  what's happening not some nerd you know hawking over like a vampire feeding on
[48:14.800 --> 48:20.120]  on a weak-minded people and a creating a feedback loop engineered by people like
[48:20.120 --> 48:27.520]  Sumner Redstone to turn us into lower than animals so they can sweep us up
[48:28.560 --> 48:33.600]  that's what's going on that's what's happening in this world they're
[48:33.600 --> 48:47.560]  laughing at you they think it's funny and it's not funny it's not cute humanity
[48:47.560 --> 48:54.840]  is on the verge of committing suicide that's basically what's happening and
[48:54.840 --> 48:59.080]  in civilizations have committed suicide many times but this time we've got the
[48:59.080 --> 49:07.160]  power to commit harry-cary sepicoe on the entire species and I am not going to
[49:07.160 --> 49:12.400]  stand by idly and just watch it happen I'm going to throw myself a hundred and
[49:12.400 --> 49:16.920]  ten percent against this and against the phony globalist churches with a hundred
[49:16.920 --> 49:20.400]  and fifty year old doctrine that it's the end of the world lay down to evil
[49:20.400 --> 49:25.480]  that isn't in the Bible ladies and gentlemen that is the doctrine of the
[49:25.480 --> 49:32.640]  pus-filled gut of Satan filled with the rotten little bodies of all the children
[49:32.640 --> 49:39.680]  it's devoured all the souls it's gobbled up you know Christ always talked
[49:39.680 --> 49:43.960]  at about 20 different levels a simple mind it would read it and get one
[49:43.960 --> 49:48.280]  meaning those that think they have wisdom would get another but those that
[49:48.280 --> 49:52.520]  have the beginning of wisdom have the fear of God and can see the hundreds of
[49:52.520 --> 49:58.200]  meanings within the 20 meanings but suffer the little children it is better
[49:58.200 --> 50:02.360]  to tie a giant boulder around your neck and throw yourself the deepest ocean
[50:02.360 --> 50:06.440]  than to harm one of them Christ is talking about little children and
[50:06.440 --> 50:10.840]  retarded children and and ignorant women and ignorant men but he's more
[50:10.840 --> 50:16.800]  importantly talking about weak-minded people who were childlike instead of
[50:16.800 --> 50:22.040]  trying to build their intellect up you use that against them you take their
[50:22.040 --> 50:26.840]  little hand and you tell them you're taking them for some candy and some
[50:26.840 --> 50:31.080]  puppy dogs in the car and you take them and you chain them up and you rape them
[50:31.080 --> 50:36.280]  for three weeks and you shock them and you and you you you psychically feed off
[50:36.280 --> 50:39.640]  their screaming and they're begging in their pain and when they finally go into
[50:39.640 --> 50:44.360]  a catatonic state you strangle them well that's what the globalists are doing to
[50:44.360 --> 50:49.000]  all of humanity and you are damned to Hades for all eternity and there is a
[50:49.000 --> 50:54.200]  spiritual force and it's real and I can see it and I know you're going straight
[50:54.200 --> 50:59.800]  to hell my only hope is that we can save humanity from being sucked down with

[55:42.000 --> 55:48.040]  celebrating how blind everyone is treating you like a bunch of blind
[55:48.040 --> 55:53.360]  deaf children all right look I said I'd get into Michael Moore and I'm gonna get
[55:53.360 --> 55:56.760]  into it more with Dr. Corsi coming up and get his view on it but let me explain
[55:56.760 --> 56:01.920]  something it's very simple we're told either the governor of Wisconsin is good
[56:01.920 --> 56:06.800]  and the Koch brothers are good or they're bad we're told either the unions
[56:06.800 --> 56:10.880]  are good and Obama's good or they're bad
[56:11.040 --> 56:17.520]  well Obama was given four times the money by Wall Street that John McCain
[56:17.520 --> 56:22.320]  was does that mean John McCain was good no it means that they thought they could
[56:22.320 --> 56:27.960]  get further with Obama conning people than John McCain you're like how does
[56:27.960 --> 56:36.280]  that explain Michael Moore it explains it right there they own both sides this
[56:36.800 --> 56:45.880]  se ic group and these other organizations in fact I had it right
[56:45.880 --> 56:54.800]  here in my stack they're all running around taking over Bank of America in
[56:54.800 --> 57:01.400]  places right target wrong solution and calling for higher taxes and saying you
[57:01.400 --> 57:05.720]  our money is in there and a few of them are even saying this is banker bailout
[57:05.720 --> 57:12.720]  money but they don't then go on to point out that government can never deliver
[57:12.720 --> 57:16.440]  and never does deliver if you have a total communist system most people end up
[57:16.440 --> 57:20.720]  starving to death because then you just have the party chiefs who become the
[57:20.720 --> 57:26.040]  new robber barons and then they blame the free market system for what's
[57:26.040 --> 57:31.120]  happening in our economy and politically no it's big government that has bought
[57:31.120 --> 57:37.440]  in to the 1500 plus quadrillion created by the private bankers so that's where
[57:37.440 --> 57:40.960]  all your pension fund money went that's where all the investment money went
[57:40.960 --> 57:45.000]  that's where the economy went it's globalism that did this it's the
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.960]  unions many of them signing on to it it's conservative signing on to the to
[57:49.960 --> 57:58.240]  nafta and get our economy and I explained all this yesterday I explained it
[57:58.240 --> 58:03.160]  all in crystal clarity how you have the video of the union people saying you
[58:03.160 --> 58:06.160]  don't have a right to your own money to the defense contractors and the guys
[58:06.160 --> 58:09.440]  like well I'm not sucking off the government largesse I'm a defense
[58:09.440 --> 58:17.320]  contractor what what I was criticizing both saying see more than half the
[58:17.320 --> 58:21.840]  population is either on government dole government jobs government welfare
[58:21.840 --> 58:27.400]  government contracts that is a recipe for total collapse of society that's a
[58:27.400 --> 58:32.320]  economic fact and union people are like more taxes more government get the
[58:32.320 --> 58:37.080]  bankers the stinking bankers want big government the insurance companies
[58:37.080 --> 58:46.400]  owned by the banks wrote the health care plan idiots this is GCN the Genesis

[59:05.960 --> 59:09.480]  own family now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[59:09.480 --> 59:14.240]  the crazy part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM
[59:14.240 --> 59:17.520]  panty may Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth
[59:17.520 --> 59:22.360]  properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he

[59:25.800 --> 59:29.800]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress

[1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:21.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:21.760 --> 1:00:26.600]  alright Dr. Jerome Corsi on the North American Union on his view on these
[1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:30.480]  unions and what's happening it's all coming up with Dr. Jerome Corsi then
[1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:34.640]  Lindsey Williams I haven't even gotten to that audio clip of Lindsey Williams
[1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:41.760]  predicting yet but I'll do that ahead of Williams coming on in the next hour but
[1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:48.360]  we did find the clip the crew did look there's a lot of problems with what
[1:00:48.360 --> 1:00:53.480]  Michael Morris saying he's saying that people's wealth in America is a national
[1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:57.440]  resource the problem is the globalists are offshore and above the law and they
[1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:01.800]  fool the general public into wanting socialism and in every case socialism's
[1:01:01.800 --> 1:01:06.360]  created and the money is then conduit it offshore to the bankers who openly lobby
[1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:12.320]  for it they're not free market they're robber baron criminals that come in and
[1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:18.800]  lobby government to create a social system to get people domesticated so they
[1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:24.000]  can use that domesticated mass to go menace the rest of the economy and the
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:28.560]  rest of the middle class and the new vorice into paying more and more taxes
[1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:33.000]  that the lion's share of go to the select defense contractors banks and
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:38.440]  insurance companies and then chicken feeds given to the servile dumb-down
[1:01:38.440 --> 1:01:45.600]  mass minions now that's very simple if you can understand that I'm sorry I got
[1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:49.960]  emails and stuff and saw some comments on the website even people saying why
[1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:54.560]  are you bashing the Michael Moore will gee he's a hypocrite he's been caught
[1:01:54.560 --> 1:01:58.360]  owning all these big defense stocks over and over again while he bashes them I
[1:01:58.360 --> 1:02:02.200]  wouldn't own any of those stocks I don't know any biometric prison stocks I own
[1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:07.200]  no stock because it's all a fraud that's my moral decision I'm not on some high
[1:02:07.200 --> 1:02:12.720]  horse but he runs around it's like Rush Limbaugh saying minimum sentences for
[1:02:12.720 --> 1:02:17.360]  cocaine if you get caught with cocaine or heroin minimum 15-year sentence then
[1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:22.760]  he's caught with synthetic heroin and commits massive felonies and if some
[1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:26.400]  street kid got caught with it 15 years in prison nothing happens to him
[1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:31.280]  nothing should have happened to you you had a back injury you got addicted it's
[1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:36.240]  a disease we shouldn't make it illegal and send you to prison college for
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:40.920]  criminals I shouldn't have to pay to put you in there Mr. Libertarian Limbaugh
[1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:48.160]  okay I feel sorry for you but don't be a big fat hypocrite like the self-propelled
[1:02:48.160 --> 1:02:52.600]  blubber butt and people are like don't be hypocritical sure a little overweight
[1:02:52.600 --> 1:02:57.320]  oh really I'm a little overweight folks about 20 pounds overweight I'm not in
[1:02:57.320 --> 1:03:00.480]  great shape but I can run two miles I could bench press 300 pounds I got a
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:06.960]  little bitty beer belly I'm not 600 pounds like him I'm 230 pounds it

[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:16.440]  the point is he's psychically a blubber butt feeding off of the trough and and
[1:03:16.440 --> 1:03:24.520]  and he sits there he sits there in everybody's face saying the bankers
[1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:29.560]  the bankers it's our money yes it's our money but is he calling for auditing the
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:35.320]  Fed is he calling for writing off the 1.5 quadrillion that we don't know no he's
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:40.240]  calling for increased taxes which is exactly what the Democrats and the
[1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:43.280]  bankers and the head of the Federal Reserve is called for higher taxes
[1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:47.720]  Bernanke all of them that's what they want I mean here's the news articles

[1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:16.840]  their answer is raise taxes the very banker heads are lobbying for that because

[1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:13.880]  Union we also are going to get into more and more bizarre mainstream articles
[1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:18.040]  Canada US agree to use each other's troops in civil emergencies that's out
[1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:21.640]  of the Ottawa citizen that's consummated by this deal two weeks ago by Lord
[1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:27.000]  Obama now three weeks ago on February 7th the course he wrote about it world
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:32.240]  that daily that is coming up also warning of food riots in the UK we
[1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:35.560]  told you that eight years ago it's all been planned but first I want to get
[1:12:35.560 --> 1:12:39.760]  course he's take on Lindsay Williams who had Ken from the head of Atlantic
[1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:45.320]  Richfield tell him five months ago as he was dying of cancer that oil would go
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:51.880]  to 150 to 200 with a staged globalist George Soros style revolution that
[1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:55.560]  mean the revolution isn't real it's just triggered by the globalist to drive up
[1:12:55.560 --> 1:13:00.880]  oil prices kill the Arabs financially then killing the dollar now you see
[1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:04.840]  Wall Street Journal saying the end of the dollar is here oh it's a good thing
[1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:08.760]  that's like saying oh you got brain cancer that's a good thing we're gonna
[1:13:08.760 --> 1:13:13.120]  get Dr. Corsi who's also a really an economics experts take on that but so
[1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:17.720]  he can hear Lindsay Williams from October 21st on this show he went into a
[1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:20.600]  lot more detail but I'll play a short clip of it because Lindsay Williams is
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:24.560]  joining us next hour here is that clip of him laying it out not just from Ken
[1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:29.520]  from who died a month later but from his other and I know the man's name and
[1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:33.720]  we've actually called him and leave that out of it so is Dr. Montee who was an
[1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:39.600]  even bigger CEO of a big three confirmed it and laughed with pleasure and said you
[1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:43.280]  go ahead and tell the slaves there's nothing they can do to stop us and now
[1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:48.640]  exactly what he told Pastor Williams is now happening here's that clip with
[1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:54.280]  that crude oil prices this means that their program is on schedule they're
[1:13:54.280 --> 1:13:58.320]  doing exactly what they've been telling me over these years they were going to
[1:13:58.320 --> 1:14:05.520]  here it is here's the price crude oil is going back to a hundred fifty two two
[1:14:05.520 --> 1:14:12.680]  hundred dollars a barrel gasoline at the gas pump will be four to five dollars a
[1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:19.160]  gallon this is going to contrive of massive inflation can you imagine what
[1:14:19.160 --> 1:14:24.080]  this is going to do to airline fares for the airlines I'm only making money right
[1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:29.320]  now be one of the most reliable businesses in America can you imagine
[1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:33.760]  what this is going to do to the truck and freight line prices can you imagine
[1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:37.720]  what this will do to the grocery store and the hot weather okay it goes on and
[1:14:37.720 --> 1:14:42.240]  on meanwhile the Fed is oblivious saying there's no inflation inflation's
[1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:46.040]  rearing up everywhere it's triggering many of the riots at the globalist then
[1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:52.440]  are using dr. Corsi what's your take on my last five minute rant and Lindsay
[1:14:52.440 --> 1:14:57.400]  Williams prediction one of many coming true with precision well I hope you'll
[1:14:57.400 --> 1:15:01.160]  I've got great respect for Lindsay Williams I hope you give my best regards
[1:15:01.160 --> 1:15:06.240]  when he's on the next segment I really agree that we're headed you know I
[1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:10.360]  predicted when I wrote black gold stranglehold that we would hit a hundred
[1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:15.040]  dollars the barrel oil I was about in 2005 and that prediction was ridiculed
[1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:20.840]  then we hit a hundred and forty eight dollars the barrel in July 2008 and I
[1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:24.640]  agree with Lindsay Williams we're headed back to that level we'll be lucky if it
[1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:30.000]  doesn't go higher than a hundred forty eight dollars a barrel now what's your
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:35.120]  view before we shift gears into the main reason you're here North American
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:38.760]  Union on what's happening in the Middle East you notice it's all the key choke
[1:15:38.760 --> 1:15:43.280]  points on the waterways and we know George Soros's people are in there
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:50.900]  Google's in there NSA MI6 SAS I mean there's no and CNN's hailing it Glen
[1:15:50.900 --> 1:15:54.680]  Beck's being criticized for staying at staged dr. Corsi what's your view on
[1:15:54.680 --> 1:16:00.320]  this well and I agree with you look the George Soros funding of causes around
[1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:06.120]  the world against the United States is are notorious and the manipulation of
[1:16:06.120 --> 1:16:11.200]  oil which is being done by OPEC the globalists have manipulated oil for a
[1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:16.080]  long time Barack Obama if you recall when he campaigned said he welcomed the
[1:16:16.080 --> 1:16:20.240]  high price of oil because he thought he'd move people to green energies I
[1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:24.320]  think really Barack Obama had the globalist agenda and heart and that is
[1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:28.400]  he knew that it would devastate the United States economy high prices of
[1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:32.880]  oil and natural gas that it would destroy industrial activity and push us
[1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:39.840]  back into a you know agency to our agenda 21 type low growth if not
[1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:44.560]  population decline pattern which the globalists have wanted for decades we've
[1:16:44.560 --> 1:16:51.240]  got abundant natural gas and oil here in the United States offshore in Alaska I've
[1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:57.880]  maintained for a long time that oil is a biotic it's not dinosaur soup it's not
[1:16:57.880 --> 1:17:01.440]  created by fossil well we know now that's being proven you're not just you
[1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:04.240]  writing about it a decade ago with all the scientists you interviewed but now
[1:17:04.240 --> 1:17:08.520]  all the oil wells most of them around the world keep filling back up and look
[1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:12.640]  how deep they are look at this deep water horizon which blue with such
[1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:16.920]  tremendous pressure that was almost through the crust right and we were
[1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:21.680]  down you know they're five six seven miles below the surface of the water
[1:17:21.680 --> 1:17:28.400]  were the the Russians the Soviets at the end of World War two knew that oil was a
[1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:34.040]  deep energy resource that it was not created by sedimentary rock you know
[1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:37.160]  it's not the case that all the dinosaurs heard is Saudi Arabian died
[1:17:37.160 --> 1:17:42.160]  the big heat at the end of the message oh yeah you know underneath the oil no
[1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:46.640]  the crust is just thinner there so it's easier to get out right they decided
[1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:50.000]  we're gonna proceed the elephants they decided to go to the great hunting
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:54.680]  ground at the dial and big heat that's not how we had oil in the Middle East if
[1:17:54.680 --> 1:17:59.320]  you take a look at the studies of the bedrock fractures underneath the oil
[1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:04.400]  fields in Saudi Arabia the oil fields are right on top of the bedrock fractures
[1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:08.600]  that's where the oil is seeped up from being created at the mantle of the earth
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:14.640]  and pools they sedimentary rocks so we have abundant oil in the Gulf of Mexico
[1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:19.200]  great meteor hit that at the end of the message oh I care we know that it deeply
[1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:23.600]  fractured the bedrock of the Gulf and the Gulf as a result is filled with oil
[1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:28.760]  we'll find abundant oil three quarters of the world is filled with water we've
[1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:33.480]  barely looked under the oceans for oil you know we'll be having nuclear
[1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:39.120]  batteries driving our cars before we ever come close to running out of oil but
[1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:45.440]  yet the globalists the Barack Obama's of the world the George Soros's do not want
[1:18:45.440 --> 1:18:49.800]  the United States of America to have abundant cheap energy which we could
[1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:54.720]  have it's also a deep dark secret that the oil companies fund the
[1:18:54.720 --> 1:19:00.440]  environmentalists and they have a big game on you know British petroleum has
[1:19:00.440 --> 1:19:06.080]  this big ad campaign BP beyond petroleum it's a joke that BP you know they're
[1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:10.280]  creating artificial scarcity it's just like George Soros gets the sweetheart
[1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:14.280]  deals with Obama GE and Soros so the only ones allowed to build new power
[1:19:14.280 --> 1:19:18.480]  plants all their competition gets shut down that's just the mafia model like
[1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:23.280]  the 1040 healthcare waivers to their buddies who don't have to get that the
[1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:26.480]  healthcare for their employees an unfair trade advantage this is just
[1:19:26.480 --> 1:19:30.880]  Chicago mafia system I agree and you know look also what you've got going on
[1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:35.960]  Alex is that if people are convinced that oil is fossil fuel there are only
[1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:40.200]  so many fossils so there can only be so much oil and that's where this whole
[1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:46.760]  conspiracy to make people think oil is rare starts absolutely Dr. Corsi stay
[1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:50.000]  there by the way this is not an alternative theory about the abiotic
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:56.280]  oil okay it's an absolute fact that oil does not come from dead dinosaurs okay
[1:19:56.280 --> 1:20:00.400]  we'll be right back with Dr. Jerome Corsi to get into the North American
[1:20:00.400 --> 1:20:03.480]  Union don't you just laugh every time the news plays another story about a
[1:20:03.480 --> 1:20:06.960]  foreclosure bank or attorney under investigation bankrupted or being sued

[1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:19.880]  addressing a new world of possibilities it means all the world under their
[1:21:19.880 --> 1:21:24.680]  control the United Nations would take over America the tri-lateral Commission
[1:21:24.680 --> 1:21:29.200]  would control the world invisible Empire Chronicles how men of power and

[1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:37.120]  world government I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a

[1:23:53.440 --> 1:24:06.920]  that's l e c i g dot com the sig for today's modern smoker okay we got about
[1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:12.160]  25 minutes or so our little less left with dr. Corsi this is a short segment
[1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:15.760]  long one coming up and I wanted to get into the main reason we have him here
[1:24:15.760 --> 1:24:20.160]  today as we can then hurry and get into the unions you know what we'll get into
[1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:23.280]  the North American Union stuff the next segment in this short segment let's get
[1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:28.840]  into the unions dr. Corsi the way I see this is you've got the big mega banks
[1:24:28.840 --> 1:24:32.280]  that are openly globalists that have stolen trillions and trillions of
[1:24:32.280 --> 1:24:35.920]  dollars they've gotten the government of the u.s. and other countries to sign on
[1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:41.880]  to their derivatives that admittedly we don't owe and so now austerity is here
[1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:46.080]  and so just like a third-world country they're cutting the unions they're
[1:24:46.080 --> 1:24:51.600]  cutting the government pay but still some of the unions are corrupt they bet on
[1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:57.200]  the wrong globalist team they certainly don't have a right to my money and now
[1:24:57.200 --> 1:25:02.120]  Obama has his admitted controlled unions and I have the news articles right here
[1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:06.360]  where se i u went in you know and took over the Bank of America building and
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:10.720]  they're calling for higher taxes but then the taxes end up going to the bankers
[1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:16.720]  and these poor useful idiots think they're there you know you've got you've
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:21.920]  got Michael Moore saying 400 people have more money than the other than 50% of
[1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:26.560]  the country yeah but those 400 people are actually lobbying a lot of them to
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:31.480]  have the dumbed-down horde come take the money from the other 49% plus that
[1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:36.280]  they're not talking about I mean this is such a simple equation that globalism
[1:25:36.280 --> 1:25:40.720]  gives out this chicken feed to have this domesticated mass to be used as a
[1:25:40.720 --> 1:25:44.960]  weapon to control the government to make sure big governments there so crony
[1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:48.320]  capitalism can control things through government what's your view on this
[1:25:48.320 --> 1:25:53.760]  well look here's where I'm gonna start the we're point about the unions is
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:57.760]  correct and I come from a union family my father was with a brother but a real
[1:25:57.760 --> 1:26:01.840]  real training he helped to create the United Transportation Union the unions
[1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:07.760]  today are nothing what the unions were you know the 30s 40s 50s even 60s in the
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:13.040]  United States today the unions are more or less kind of like got it got on they
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:19.400]  have on the kind of almost mafia kind of organized crime game there's no
[1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:23.640]  collective bargaining the unions get into power they take over teachers let's
[1:26:23.640 --> 1:26:27.440]  say teachers and with content and they wanted to be you can't be a teacher
[1:26:27.440 --> 1:26:31.440]  unless you join the union and the union's gonna take part of your pay
[1:26:31.440 --> 1:26:36.000]  that's your union do was you don't have a choice you pay your union dues then the
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:41.120]  union decides to put that money good portion of it into democratic party
[1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:45.360]  political campaigns you have no choice about where your money goes in the
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:49.080]  political campaign and the Democrats give you an aftin get it's right and the
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:53.600]  Democrats get into power and then the Democratic governors vote to the unions
[1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:59.400]  more and more pay for their current benefits pension benefits whatever the
[1:26:59.400 --> 1:27:03.120]  union wants because again the governor's especially with pension bug
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:06.960]  benefits no it's gonna come out of some future generations and some other
[1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:12.520]  governor's budget so the unions and the Democratic Party have in place this
[1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:19.440]  quick game which is holds hostage government employees now you can't be
[1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:23.360]  part of the government employee racket unless you belong to the union racket
[1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:28.440]  they're all confiscating the money through union dues funding Democratic Party
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:32.720]  it's this is a mafia game if we're done in business all these people would be
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:37.840]  put in jail for organizing a Rico racket and they're extorting the taxpayers
[1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:42.360]  that's right then they come back around and Michael Moore was completely if
[1:27:42.360 --> 1:27:45.480]  anybody has any doubt that this is headed towards socialism or outright
[1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:51.000]  communism Michael Moore basically said your money is mine he said you know all
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:54.960]  the money in the world belongs to the state the state can confiscate it take
[1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:59.600]  it and give it to the people well that idea ever worked in history it'd be
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:05.240]  worth listening to but all it is a kind of an idea that you know the thugs like
[1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:09.600]  Michael Moore and the others who organized the unions or rabble rouse to
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:14.480]  get the proletariat raised up you know there was no never a poor communist at
[1:28:14.480 --> 1:28:18.800]  the top they always stole the money make sure they got their share just like the
[1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:22.760]  union bosses find me a poor union boss but now they're trying to juxtapose
[1:28:22.760 --> 1:28:26.720]  themselves against the banksters but the big banksters they're the ones that
[1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:30.800]  created the big government to control things and then you've got Obama sending
[1:28:30.800 --> 1:28:35.120]  his thugs in to protest against Bank of America when he's financed by him it's
[1:28:35.120 --> 1:28:39.440]  totally staged well it's all stage because if you take a look at the
[1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:43.880]  transit the money that goes in from Wall Street this is another one of the you
[1:28:43.880 --> 1:28:47.840]  know Michael Moore ought to go to the federal election commission and read the
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:53.840]  reports because Wall Street largely funded Barack Obama and anybody who has
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:58.320]  any mystery about that are realized that when it came time Barack Obama paid
[1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:03.120]  back he bailed out all of his buddies especially Goldman Sachs there's a big
[1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:10.120]  game on Goldman Sachs has made trillions of dollars over the decades being in
[1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:16.000]  bed with big government and controlling the SEC it is made off scam should make
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:21.440]  it clear to everybody that the SEC is and has always been in bed with whoever
[1:29:21.440 --> 1:29:27.120]  is controlling stealing cheating money on the Wall Street is a big game as the
[1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:30.880]  game is to the detriment of the American people the American economy and the
[1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:34.920]  globalists of the people at the top want to manage this big money game so Wall
[1:29:34.920 --> 1:29:40.880]  Street funds Barack Obama and win quick they deny it amazing stay there let's
[1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:43.600]  come back and finish up on that doctor coursing then I'm going to get into the

[1:32:05.600 --> 1:32:11.240]  is our last chance to not relive history as a finishing off this agenda that we
[1:32:11.240 --> 1:32:15.400]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home turn members influence
[1:32:15.400 --> 1:32:20.240]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think
[1:32:20.240 --> 1:32:25.600]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:30.800]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[1:32:30.800 --> 1:32:35.120]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[1:32:35.120 --> 1:32:39.280]  Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[1:32:39.280 --> 1:32:43.000]  Congress is saying who to make the check out to today seems like nobody does
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic yet
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:54.320]  your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching
[1:32:54.320 --> 1:33:08.560]  online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[1:33:24.320 --> 1:33:41.920]  okay we are back live with Dr. Jerome Corsi what's happening is we're going
[1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:47.120]  into an engineered plan economy it's a global corporate government but it's
[1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:51.280]  not free market so republicans are taught if it's free market if it's a
[1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:55.720]  corporation it can do no wrong but the corporations are acting like governments
[1:33:55.720 --> 1:33:59.800]  coming in and taking over our governments lobbying to have our farms and
[1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:04.760]  ranches shut down so big agribusiness has a monopoly passing environmental laws
[1:34:04.760 --> 1:34:09.800]  to shut down small industry so it can only operate in China India and Mexico
[1:34:09.800 --> 1:34:15.440]  operating so only general electric gets the waivers for new cold powered plants
[1:34:15.440 --> 1:34:19.760]  openly to shut down the competition that's the Enron plan there's been more
[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:24.680]  indictments over the pump and dump stuff with the plants I mean this is not our
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:29.320]  opinion and when you read the SPP documents that judicial watch got the
[1:34:29.320 --> 1:34:35.200]  Dr. Corsi went through in 2007 and other documents since they said look we've
[1:34:35.200 --> 1:34:38.680]  got to integrate by stealth it's covered my film in game blueprint for global
[1:34:38.680 --> 1:34:43.800]  enslavement covered in his book the late great USA they said and it was it was
[1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:48.200]  over a hundred corporate CEOs they're giving orders to the heads of the
[1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:52.760]  unelected bureaucracy and they said we'll use the flu as a way to integrate
[1:34:52.760 --> 1:34:57.040]  we'll use terror threat we'll use drug threat we'll use economic collapse and
[1:34:57.040 --> 1:35:02.000]  now they never stop building it in stealth now Obama has come out and
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:09.400]  signed the North American Union security perimeter Dr. Corsi has written at length
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:13.840]  about this and it's all part of the strategic corporate hijacking of the
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:18.280]  big mega corporations that are bigger than most governments who have disdain
[1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:24.760]  for the free market and as John D Rockefeller said competition is a sin
[1:35:24.760 --> 1:35:31.560]  competition is a sin because he liked inside operations Dr. Corsi you've got
[1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:35.640]  the floor on this situation we're still going into North American integration
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:40.360]  by stealth and it looks like David put the afterburners back on well they have
[1:35:40.360 --> 1:35:46.840]  I mean I wrote an article in WND people are unaware that Bronco Obama met with
[1:35:46.840 --> 1:35:52.520]  Prime Minister Stephen Harper they agreed on February 4th they signed a
[1:35:52.520 --> 1:35:58.000]  beyond-the-border bilateral declaration it created a North American
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:03.280]  continental perimeter this was one of the chief goals of the security and
[1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:08.120]  prosperity partnership in North America and then I also wrote my red alert
[1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:12.680]  newsletter and people now can get the red alert newsletter free I'm a managing
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:17.120]  director at Guilford Securities in New York I'm still very actively involved in
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:21.680]  the securities industry GuilfordSecurities.com you can get red alert
[1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:26.680]  I write it every week free or through WND the article I'm headlining this week
[1:36:26.680 --> 1:36:31.440]  is that Obama has already decided he was announced at his press conference last
[1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:37.080]  week with Mexico's president Felipe Calderon to allow the Mexican trucks to
[1:36:37.080 --> 1:36:40.920]  come back into the United States to roll freely throughout the United States
[1:36:40.920 --> 1:36:47.280]  Congress took the money away from this in fact Obama signed the executive order
[1:36:47.280 --> 1:36:53.080]  I signed the law the defunding was in the 410 billion omnibus funding bill
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:57.560]  President Obama signed in March 2009 Congress took away the money from the
[1:36:57.560 --> 1:37:01.680]  Department of Transportation to do this Mexican truck demonstration project but
[1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:06.160]  Obama is allowing the Mexican trucks to come back into the United States under
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:11.720]  his own authority without any attempt at all to come to Congress to get
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:20.080]  authorization or seek approval Wow please continue but then I've really
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:27.040]  tried to detail how what's going on now is a closer merging together with Canada
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:30.240]  on this perimeter continental perimeter deal and then building the
[1:37:30.240 --> 1:37:34.600]  infrastructure to integrate with Mexico now another thing most people don't
[1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:40.600]  realize is that Janet Napolitano went down to Mexico on November 30th the end
[1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:46.400]  of last year she signed an agreement on trusted travelers the North American
[1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:51.000]  trusted traveler program was put into place with Mexico and what this does is
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  it allows Mexicans to come and get a card looks like just an ATM card of it or
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:00.880]  driver's license with a picture on it there'll be a biometric card issued by
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:05.240]  the Department of Homeland Security and Mexico is claiming something like 80
[1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:09.120]  million and Mexicans which is about 8 10th of the country is ultimately gonna
[1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:14.880]  have these cards now what you do with these cards is when you come into a
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:20.960]  airport or port of entry so take a look at global entry dot gov where you've
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:25.240]  got these terminals being put in place they look like ATM machines you take
[1:38:25.240 --> 1:38:29.120]  your Mexican trusted traveler North American card you sweep it through the
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:33.720]  global entry dot gov terminal you answer a few questions and you walk in
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:38.120]  across the border and Mexico is just demanded they're putting into place a
[1:38:38.120 --> 1:38:45.880]  program where all children in the schools under age 19 which is probably
[1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:50.360]  going to be about 25 million children in Mexico are going to be issued they have
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:57.480]  to go get these biometric government issued ID cards they have a picture have
[1:38:57.480 --> 1:39:03.120]  a facial scan with full facial digital recognition iris recognition
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:07.960]  built into the card all 10 fingerprints and this is the beginning of you know
[1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:11.880]  once the Mexican children get these IDs from the Mexican government then they
[1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:15.880]  become trusted travelers in North America this is another key program of
[1:39:15.880 --> 1:39:18.960]  the security and prosperity partnership in North America I've been writing about
[1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:24.200]  it on WND and my red alert newsletter hardly anybody knows it's being put into
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:28.960]  place because Barack Obama decided to go under the radar he's taken down the
[1:39:28.960 --> 1:39:35.880]  website SPP.gov but without announcing these big decisions in any major way
[1:39:35.880 --> 1:39:39.800]  through the authority the White House alone Barack Obama is building the
[1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:43.800]  Mexican trucks come into the United States declaring a North American
[1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:48.640]  security border with Canada and beginning the trusted traveler of North
[1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:57.160]  American program with Mexico they just continue to move ahead with this
[1:39:57.160 --> 1:40:04.480]  takeover and and I have a news article here in my stack and and I've seen
[1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:07.800]  similar ones over the years over and over again in the Associated Press you
[1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:12.240]  name it Canada U.S. agreed to use each other's troops in civil emergencies
[1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:16.240]  Canada the U.S. have signed an agreement that paves the way for the
[1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:19.760]  militaries from either nation to send troops across each other's borders
[1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:24.280]  during an emergency but some are questioning why the government has kept
[1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:30.600]  silent on the deal and but then you bring up in LE09 and open drills to use
[1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:34.560]  foreign troops to quote fight American terrorists and Mexican troops going to
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:39.480]  New Orleans and during Katrina I've been to the urban warfare drills the
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:44.680]  role players at drill after drill with Marines and Army with foreign troops is
[1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:51.880]  American gun owners and libertarians so there is a giant program going on
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:58.160]  preparing for war with the American people and we need to stop denying that
[1:40:58.160 --> 1:41:02.520]  the bureaucracies out of control that this is high treason that Bush committed
[1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:07.280]  an act of treason signing the SPP in secret in 2005 and Waco as you know Dr.
[1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:11.880]  Corsi I said that directly at the time and there's ongoing continuity of
[1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:16.200]  agenda there's really no difference and and and I mean how do we stop this I
[1:41:16.200 --> 1:41:19.800]  mean I mean now they're now they're you know our troops are at their Olympics
[1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:24.200]  their troops are down here I mean we've signed agreement under the
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:28.080]  security and prosperity partnership with Mexico and Canada that if there is
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:34.440]  another breakout of influenza or avian flu or another health epidemic the
[1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:37.960]  United States has agreed to go under you and authority and to work with a
[1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:43.120]  North American command to deal with the health emergency in the United States
[1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:48.280]  we've already signed the agreement and again boys signed the agreement as a
[1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:52.360]  one of these agreements with Mexico and Canada was never brought before Canada
[1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:58.560]  to Congress as a treaty this is all being done under the radar and when
[1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:03.280]  people like you or I mean I'm going I'm saying here's the government websites
[1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:10.000]  go to globalentry.gov I list the 20 airports where these terminals are
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:14.600]  being put into place the trusted traveler terminals Boston Logan Dallas
[1:42:14.600 --> 1:42:20.640]  Houston Honolulu JFK in New York these are the major airports all around the
[1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:26.000]  country the terminals are there global entry.gov government website shows that
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:30.400]  they're there we point out government websites and they still say we're the
[1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:34.440]  conspiracy theorist because the Obama administration just like the Bush
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:38.440]  administration does not want their globalist North American Union agenda
[1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:44.320]  exposed and when we do expose it Alex they they hit back by trying to add
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:49.120]  hominem attacks calling us names where the truth is that the real conspirators
[1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:53.480]  are the Bush administration the Obama administration Canada's government
[1:42:53.480 --> 1:42:57.040]  Mexico's government they're all working together to put in place the
[1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:00.800]  infrastructure of the North American Union without officially announcing it
[1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:08.200]  to the peoples of any of the three countries. Now how do we get the word
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:12.560]  out to people though that the same multinational corporations Microsoft
[1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:20.200]  Yahoo Google and others Cisco you name it have openly helped China and India
[1:43:20.200 --> 1:43:25.120]  roll out their RFID national slave ID cards that they're helping set that up
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:29.680]  here that the hemispheric ID card out for three years is the North American
[1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:37.560]  real ID that the TSA is the federal Gestapo even congressman now saying
[1:43:37.560 --> 1:43:40.480]  yes they're going to take over the streets of America they are running
[1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:45.240]  checkpoints they're having high-powered x-rays that they drive citizens under
[1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:50.680]  where the where the TSA and TSA trained police stand under they're not even
[1:43:50.680 --> 1:43:58.720]  following OSHA rules on radiology I mean it's it's a brazen full-out offensive
[1:43:58.720 --> 1:44:06.520]  against every form of liberty and that's the one angle that they've got up on us
[1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:11.480]  it seems is that it's so crazy that even when it's in the news that they're
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:14.760]  training to bring in Mexican and Canadian troops to quote deal with American
[1:44:14.760 --> 1:44:20.880]  terrorists that's associated press quote that that it's so crazy people can't
[1:44:20.880 --> 1:44:26.600]  can't even deal with it I mean it's almost like the reports of 500 years
[1:44:26.600 --> 1:44:35.000]  ago and 1492 when when the Islanders the natives in the Americas would see
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:39.320]  sailing ships they never seen anything like it so some of them couldn't even
[1:44:39.320 --> 1:44:43.840]  see it even though it was right there they they couldn't see it because they
[1:44:43.840 --> 1:44:48.760]  had no no psychological lexicon do you see what I'm saying Dr. Carson I do and
[1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:53.720]  what my approach has always been Alex when I'm reporting in WND in my book
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:58.360]  another book out here soon it's going to be another big fight I try to tell
[1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:01.640]  people like with the Mexican trucks I've been writing about this for years and
[1:45:01.640 --> 1:45:07.000]  saying the it's the both the Bush administration the Obama administration
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:10.920]  they're gonna let Mexican trucks in and people say oh no no the you know the
[1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:15.360]  Teamsters Union and the how the owner operator independent drivers
[1:45:15.360 --> 1:45:20.000]  association they all supported Obama the Union supported Obama Obama would
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:24.560]  never do the Teamsters in by letting Mexican trucks in the United States and
[1:45:24.560 --> 1:45:29.760]  you don't understand Obama doesn't care about the Teamsters globalist agenda so
[1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:35.160]  now when the Mexican trucks do start rolling in the United States I expect
[1:45:35.160 --> 1:45:38.640]  people to go back to the articles I wrote to see that this was what I was
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:43.200]  writing about that was predicting and documenting it also Alex I'd like to
[1:45:43.200 --> 1:45:47.080]  think everything I write is well documented I've got links in my articles
[1:45:47.080 --> 1:45:51.760]  you can see the government websites I'm interviewing the government authorities
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:57.520]  I'm quoting them directly you know now would you read one of my pieces you
[1:45:57.520 --> 1:46:01.080]  yourself can go see the primary documents where the government indicates
[1:46:01.080 --> 1:46:04.760]  that yes the Mexican trucks are now going to come into the United States
[1:46:04.760 --> 1:46:09.840]  Obama did do this he's ignoring Congress there's no no congressional vote
[1:46:09.840 --> 1:46:14.440]  gonna be held on this Congress took away the money at the end of the Bush
[1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:18.600]  administration Obama's not gonna care he's just gonna say we're gonna do the
[1:46:18.600 --> 1:46:22.640]  Mexican trucks and let somebody stop it when you call the doctor Corsi when you
[1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:26.480]  call this government it's not even government now it's like care about the
[1:46:26.480 --> 1:46:30.000]  Constitution anymore Alex it's not government it's not even legitimate I
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:33.600]  mean take the case that came out three weeks ago that we've really dropped the
[1:46:33.600 --> 1:46:36.880]  ball on we've covered it some we have a new article by JT coyote today on
[1:46:36.880 --> 1:46:43.000]  info wars.com BATV secret op creates terror and Mexican border towns I knew
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:47.360]  this several years ago five years ago I had sell a Costello it was a former top
[1:46:47.360 --> 1:46:51.360]  DEA agent to actually set him up over this and set him to prison for coming
[1:46:51.360 --> 1:46:54.840]  on this show and others and he said they're training Mexican drug cartels in
[1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:58.360]  South Texas they're gonna go after the cartels they don't control the Mexican
[1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:03.160]  military is the main dealer the CIA is training them it's gonna start it's gonna
[1:47:03.160 --> 1:47:07.560]  be a war down there and the government shipping arms into Mexico to destabilize
[1:47:07.560 --> 1:47:13.240]  it now you have top ATF agents coming out valiantly in CBS news and saying yes
[1:47:13.240 --> 1:47:20.720]  we're ordered to let fully you know auto weapons 50 Cal Barrett's everything
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:27.160]  in quantity in quantity to Mexico because they know that over 90% of the
[1:47:27.160 --> 1:47:30.640]  weapons were being bought from the Germans and sold to the military I'm I
[1:47:30.640 --> 1:47:34.320]  know I'm gonna run down to state it sold to the military so the so so so the
[1:47:34.320 --> 1:47:38.800]  military selling to the cartels hardly any of it's from America so the ATF
[1:47:38.800 --> 1:47:44.160]  sets up dealers and conduits to sell guns so they can trace them back to then
[1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:49.080]  try to take our guns take away the second I mean this is a Dr. Corsi is this
[1:47:49.080 --> 1:47:54.040]  not a false flag that we've caught Obama of course it is this whole idea the ATF
[1:47:54.040 --> 1:47:58.240]  allowing guns to be sold to Mexico and then putting out reports that the guns
[1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:02.680]  are being smuggled into Mexico so as to limit the Second Amendment this is a
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:06.440]  total government operation to destroy the Second Amendment it's a false flag
[1:48:06.440 --> 1:48:11.680]  it's you mean but look my new book coming out area we're gonna be where's the
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:16.400]  birth certificate it's on the birth date we have a present by the way I want to
[1:48:16.400 --> 1:48:20.120]  carry that book who do I call to carry those in both Joseph Harris gonna be
[1:48:20.120 --> 1:48:24.520]  published by WND we'll make sure you get to carry the book well I'm not gonna
[1:48:24.520 --> 1:48:27.120]  carry it unless I can carry it out of the gates though how do I do that well
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:30.000]  we'll make sure I'll work with you producer we'll get it set up right
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:34.640]  now I'll say it's gonna be published on May 17th we two months out from
[1:48:34.640 --> 1:48:38.400]  publication so the book has already been on but again the fact that they know
[1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:42.960]  there's questions about his his his Providence and where he came from that's
[1:48:42.960 --> 1:48:47.880]  all part of this precedent they don't care the the White House doesn't regard
[1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:53.160]  the government doesn't care about the Constitution in this NPR interview that
[1:48:53.160 --> 1:48:59.760]  was done by you know the it shows they're like childlike cults where they
[1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:04.320]  just sit around making fun of the NPR admits they're not gonna cover the
[1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:09.200]  birther story even though NPR sitting at that table saying we know that there's
[1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:14.200]  validity here we know Barack Obama cannot prove that he is a natural born
[1:49:14.200 --> 1:49:18.880]  citizen of the United States they know it they just won't cover it and here
[1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:23.200]  they are secretly taped admitting it admitting it it's the same thing with
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:26.960]  the guns you know that's why I think my book is already gonna be a bestseller
[1:49:26.960 --> 1:49:31.920]  for the pre-publication sales take a look Amazon.com take a look on Barnes and
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:35.400]  Noble we'll get it up on your site right away I'll work with your producer yeah
[1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:38.080]  it needs to be up next week if it's already in pre-sell because I want to
[1:49:38.080 --> 1:49:42.280]  get it out but but just just in closing Dr. Corsi going back to this gun issue
[1:49:42.280 --> 1:49:46.360]  shouldn't we start a movement to call for impeachment of Obama absolutely
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:51.960]  because this is total disregard for the Constitution. The government is selling
[1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:56.560]  the guns to the cartels to then blame it on America in the Second Amendment that's
[1:49:56.560 --> 1:50:01.840]  staged terror and coming out with reports saying these guns are being
[1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:06.160]  smuggled into Mexico therefore we need to have gun control in the United States
[1:50:06.160 --> 1:50:09.240]  terrorism all the while it's the government doing it I mean how many
[1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:13.480]  times doctor do we have to catch them creating the crisis to realize this is
[1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:16.840]  a group of ruthless crooks and if they're gonna commit a hundred crimes
[1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:20.560]  why not commit 10,000 or 10 million well let's get let's go interview the
[1:50:20.560 --> 1:50:25.000]  Teamsters Union see how they feel having supported Barack Obama now Barack
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:28.280]  Obama's letting the Mexican trucks in the United States. Barack Obama does not
[1:50:28.280 --> 1:50:33.680]  care that you know about 93% of all motor carriers in the United States have fewer
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:38.800]  than 20 trucks in their fleet wait till the wait till US companies big companies
[1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:42.480]  are going down to Mexico and operating as Mexican trucking companies now it's over
[1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:45.840]  it's it's it's it's part of the race at the bottom and it won't help Mexico
[1:50:45.840 --> 1:50:49.920]  either dr. Cortese always great having you on let's have you on next week or

[1:55:22.200 --> 1:55:27.560]  the world economy implode the Middle East and then blame it on the Arabs and
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:31.920]  oil and now they're all over the news Wall Street Journal New York Times the
[1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:37.520]  Economist just as the world was recovering oil as a as a time bomb with
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:45.200]  the fuse burning I mean it's just everywhere it's all scripted I mean do
[1:55:45.200 --> 1:55:52.320]  we even tell you exactly what they're going to do with exact numbers and then

[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:04.720]  about chemtrails to admitting it but saying it's good they've gone from
[1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:07.440]  laughing at us saying they're putting lithium and things in the water to
[1:56:07.440 --> 1:56:12.760]  saying yeah we're doing it it's for your own good do you realize all over the
[1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:16.600]  country they add uranium and other isotopes to the water and it's even in
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:21.960]  the mainstream news and nobody gets in trouble yeah we're adding uranium die the

[2:00:28.840 --> 2:00:32.480]  full hour pastor Chaplain Lindsay Williams Giants then I'm going into
[2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:38.120]  overdrive with Aaron Dykes with a detailed 20 30-minute report on the
[2:00:38.120 --> 2:00:42.600]  takeover of the energy infrastructure the power plants in the US and how it's
[2:00:42.600 --> 2:00:48.160]  hidden in plain view run by Enron type people set up by them George Soros how
[2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:52.160]  the scam works this is so important to our future a lot of folks just flip the
[2:00:52.160 --> 2:00:55.880]  light switch on but wonder whether power bills going up we're gonna explain all
[2:00:55.880 --> 2:01:00.120]  of that but I you know I had to get Lindsay Williams back on because we
[2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:08.440]  finally got up off of our rumpuses and went to the audio of the October 21st
[2:01:08.440 --> 2:01:16.760]  2010 now about five months ago audio of Pastor Lindsay Williams saying that he
[2:01:16.760 --> 2:01:20.080]  has now deceased oil company exact connection who died a few months after
[2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:24.240]  that and his other even bigger connection told him yes within six months
[2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:30.960]  hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars a barrel now we have Bloomberg London
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:37.800]  Telegraph and others reporting Saudi Arabia's day of rage lures record bets
[2:01:37.800 --> 2:01:45.320]  on $200 oil chart and it says that the the the the the largest call contract
[2:01:45.320 --> 2:01:52.760]  options by New York crude for June delivery is at $200 a barrel and that
[2:01:52.760 --> 2:01:58.720]  is exactly what is now beginning to unfold and this is what is and remember
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:02.840]  his old company exact sources have been right and I'm in the next segment
[2:02:02.840 --> 2:02:05.560]  everybody joins us I'm gonna go over some of the history of Lindsay's
[2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:10.600]  predictions briefly and then and then this new revelation of information where
[2:02:10.600 --> 2:02:14.960]  all of this is going but the main reason we have Lindsay here today is to take
[2:02:14.960 --> 2:02:19.400]  your phone calls and you know just say look see Lindsay told you so I mean I
[2:02:19.400 --> 2:02:25.240]  knew Ken from was years ago couldn't tell you the name he's dead now we can I
[2:02:25.240 --> 2:02:29.120]  know who the other guy is can't tell you who he is and he's alive and well and
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:35.120]  what they're telling you is from what the insiders plan to do and it's just
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:37.640]  incredible but Lindsay we're about to go to break and come back to the full
[2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:42.840]  audience but I wish your sources were wrong but the key to this all with him
[2:02:42.840 --> 2:02:47.320]  being proven right shows on top of all the other admissions of George Soros and
[2:02:47.320 --> 2:02:54.040]  NSA and CIA and Google and MI6 and SAS running these over throws that's a fact
[2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:57.880]  they're doing it doesn't mean these dictators are good the point is this is
[2:02:57.880 --> 2:03:02.800]  staged but you said this five months ago on the show
[2:03:03.400 --> 2:03:09.160]  turn him on we'll go to him Lindsay do we have you there yes you exactly right
[2:03:09.160 --> 2:03:14.280]  Alex you allowed me the privilege to be on your show and I know both of us had
[2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:19.040]  our reputations at stake and I said that they had told me that within four to
[2:03:19.040 --> 2:03:23.240]  five months there would be a conflict in the Middle East they did not say Iran
[2:03:23.240 --> 2:03:28.200]  they did not say Egypt I knew it was going to happen and then two weeks ago
[2:03:28.200 --> 2:03:34.640]  I found out why it happened and today we know not only what all this is about
[2:03:34.640 --> 2:03:40.200]  but what it's going to be about from this point on Alex well it's incredible
[2:03:40.200 --> 2:03:44.320]  and we're gonna come back in a moment and basically recap the previous things
[2:03:44.320 --> 2:03:49.360]  they told you just in brevity as brief as we can you know three and a half years
[2:03:49.360 --> 2:03:54.000]  ago it was $50 a barrel they said it go to 150 it did then the media said it
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:58.080]  would go to 200 you said no now it's going to go down to 40 within the next
[2:03:58.080 --> 2:04:01.880]  two months did exactly that you got laughed at that it happened how quickly
[2:04:01.880 --> 2:04:05.360]  they forget then you said now enjoy yourself for the next two years it'll
[2:04:05.360 --> 2:04:09.960]  only grow a little bit to $60 a barrel or so but then after that look out it's
[2:04:09.960 --> 2:04:13.560]  going to center in and around a flare up in the Middle East and it's going to go
[2:04:13.560 --> 2:04:17.840]  up to 150 or more then five months ago they tell you okay here's the time frame
[2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:22.120]  six months from now this will begin $150 $200 a barrel now we see that
[2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:25.960]  happening I mean it just goes on and on Lindsay we're going to come back recap
[2:04:25.960 --> 2:04:29.920]  that go over some of the news headlines look at what dollar devaluation means

[2:08:50.680 --> 2:08:56.480]  about 55 $60 a barrel Lindsey Williams says it will go to 150 from his inside
[2:08:56.480 --> 2:09:00.680]  two oil company exact connections who are globalists known to us now one of
[2:09:00.680 --> 2:09:05.240]  them's dead we could talk about him Ken from can't talk about mr. L still alive
[2:09:05.240 --> 2:09:11.720]  oil then they're my laughs at Lindsey it then rockets to 149 then it drops starts
[2:09:11.720 --> 2:09:14.280]  dropping a little before that even happens Lindsey says it will go down to
[2:09:14.280 --> 2:09:18.880]  40 it doesn't just go to 40 it goes to 32 for a while then he says enjoy
[2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:22.760]  yourselves for two years my sources say it's going to move up just a little bit
[2:09:22.760 --> 2:09:27.000]  to 60 or so then there'll be destabilization in the Middle East after
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:34.440]  two years it will explode and go to 150 or more then on October 21st 2010 five
[2:09:34.440 --> 2:09:40.480]  months ago on this broadcast he broke the news that mr. Fromm very close to
[2:09:40.480 --> 2:09:46.920]  death and he did die a month and a half later said that the plan has been
[2:09:46.920 --> 2:09:51.160]  initiated for destabilization not war in the Middle East destabilization that is
[2:09:51.160 --> 2:09:55.160]  not countries fighting each other but civil war you can hear the old hour
[2:09:55.160 --> 2:09:58.920]  interview from that date it's up on our YouTube channel it's up on present
[2:09:58.920 --> 2:10:04.920]  planet TV as well and in fact it's just Lindsay Williams predictions on the
[2:10:04.920 --> 2:10:13.080]  Alex Jones show October 21st 2010 and so William said it's gonna go up to 150
[2:10:13.080 --> 2:10:16.720]  then he said now it's gonna go down to 40 people laugh went down to 40 now it's
[2:10:16.720 --> 2:10:20.240]  gonna just slowly go up but not above 60 yourself for two years enjoy
[2:10:20.240 --> 2:10:27.120]  yourselves then after that in the next six months it's gonna explode in the
[2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:31.760]  Middle East boom it's happening now one of the headlines today and yesterday
[2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:39.080]  Saudi Arabia's day of rage lures record bets on $200 oil chart of the day by
[2:10:39.080 --> 2:10:43.840]  June delivery that would make it six and a half seven months from Lindsay
[2:10:43.840 --> 2:10:50.520]  Williams report to us right on time for $200 a barrel continuing oil markets
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:57.960]  brace for Saudi rage is global spare capacity wears thin talk of $150 to $200
[2:10:57.960 --> 2:11:02.960]  a barrel it's already over eight bucks a gallon in Europe or a leader continuing
[2:11:02.960 --> 2:11:09.680]  oil already above 105 in the next month the futures between 114 and 122 that's
[2:11:09.680 --> 2:11:14.160]  just some of the news on that front but before we go to Lindsay Williams I want
[2:11:14.160 --> 2:11:24.960]  to play a clip from him here on the show and this was on October October 21st
[2:11:24.960 --> 2:11:34.880]  2010 on this radio broadcast where Lindsay Williams laid out this information
[2:11:34.880 --> 2:11:38.840]  and they didn't know they didn't know I was going to it okay Lindsay tell us
[2:11:38.840 --> 2:11:43.480]  about this clip that's coming up here in a minute from you in October what you
[2:11:43.480 --> 2:11:49.240]  were told by mr. Fromm and others I feel so honored it by the promise of God I
[2:11:49.240 --> 2:11:52.880]  would be allowed to know these things in advance so that I could tell the
[2:11:52.880 --> 2:11:56.960]  American people what's happening and if it had not been for those three years I
[2:11:56.960 --> 2:12:01.080]  lived with the elite of the world I would not know it but on this clip and I
[2:12:01.080 --> 2:12:07.000]  said it on your show and again Alex please allow me I am not a prophet I
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:13.360]  only care what the elite have turned me because of their trust in me 35 years
[2:12:13.360 --> 2:12:18.200]  ago when I was there chaplain for three years and lived with them and they have
[2:12:18.200 --> 2:12:22.000]  said everything is going to take place before it happens because it's part of
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:26.440]  their moral code that they must tell the world what they're going to do before
[2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:31.480]  they do it and on your show you were daring enough to allow me to say some
[2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:36.480]  things that could have learned either one of our reputations and I said that I
[2:12:36.480 --> 2:12:41.400]  had just been told by the elite of the world that within five months there
[2:12:41.400 --> 2:12:45.720]  would be a conflict in the Middle East now let's go back again because you
[2:12:45.720 --> 2:12:51.240]  pre-iterated some of these and you were exactly right I actually said it only
[2:12:51.240 --> 2:12:56.000]  because they had said it to me three years ago they said the price of food
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:01.160]  or it's going from $137 a barrel of $50 a barrel a dollar and fifty cents a
[2:13:01.160 --> 2:13:05.920]  gallon at the gas pump at this and it happened three months after I said it on
[2:13:05.920 --> 2:13:10.280]  your show a exactly but before that you predicted it would go to 150 and that
[2:13:10.280 --> 2:13:16.280]  was right too yes and then they said it was through that this Alex that nobody
[2:13:16.280 --> 2:13:19.760]  in the world can doubt this because I said it on your show two and a half
[2:13:19.760 --> 2:13:25.480]  years I said that they told me it was going to stay between $70 and $80 a
[2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:31.360]  barrel and it did it exactly almost to the day then they said it's going to go
[2:13:31.360 --> 2:13:37.800]  back up to 150 to $200 a barrel exactly as I was told folks are you getting this
[2:13:37.800 --> 2:13:43.000]  date and I recorded in my book the energy and on prices that exactly as I was
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:54.240]  told in 1947 when I watched the island field brought in you mean 1977 1977 I'm
[2:13:54.240 --> 2:13:59.600]  sorry and they said the price of the crude oil we will get it to where we
[2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:04.640]  want to go before we release any air from the attic while I for a few now
[2:14:04.640 --> 2:14:08.120]  they're gonna open that up so so so this is all coming to pass we do have the
[2:14:08.120 --> 2:14:14.000]  clip ready from you October 21st 2010 five months ago here on air here's
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:18.720]  Lindsay Williams but it's backed up with their crude oil prices this means that
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:24.480]  their program is on schedule they're doing exactly what they've been telling me
[2:14:24.480 --> 2:14:28.840]  over these years they were going to here it is here's the price crude oil is
[2:14:28.840 --> 2:14:38.640]  going back to $152 to $100 a barrel gasoline at the gas pump will be four
[2:14:38.640 --> 2:14:45.880]  to five dollars a gallon this is going to contrive massive inflation can you
[2:14:45.880 --> 2:14:50.360]  imagine what this is going to do to airline fares with the airlines I'm
[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:55.520]  only making money right now they're one of the most reliable businesses in
[2:14:55.520 --> 2:14:58.960]  America can you imagine what this is going to do to the truck and freight
[2:14:58.960 --> 2:15:03.240]  line prices can you imagine what this will do to the grocery store and the
[2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:07.920]  hardware store because every bit of it is hauled by either a diesel train or a
[2:15:07.920 --> 2:15:13.200]  truck right down and now the albos and others are positioned to roll out with
[2:15:13.200 --> 2:15:18.440]  their solution the quote green economy that they control yes and every
[2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:22.880]  business is part of their total program of what they're going to do now what
[2:15:22.880 --> 2:15:28.040]  Janet of Colorado said only moments ago on national news on a special bulletin
[2:15:28.040 --> 2:15:33.440]  that they are very concerned about a cyber attack do you realize what this
[2:15:33.440 --> 2:15:37.720]  would do to crude oil prices when you went to for instance you go to the
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:42.080]  service station and you can't use your credit card okay folks so it goes on for
[2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:45.960]  an hour him talking about the Middle East flare up all of it the date is
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:51.080]  October 21st of last year it's in our archives the free audio archives the
[2:15:51.080 --> 2:15:54.880]  higher quality prison planet TV it's on the Alex Jones channel it's all over
[2:15:54.880 --> 2:15:57.800]  the web you want to go hear the hour-long interview where he lays it all
[2:15:57.800 --> 2:16:02.840]  out but but you know there it is 150 $200 that's what they're telling him and
[2:16:02.840 --> 2:16:06.200]  then he goes on to say flare up in the Middle East you can hear the whole hour
[2:16:06.200 --> 2:16:10.800]  long program up on the site but there it is Lindsey now we're seeing it all
[2:16:10.800 --> 2:16:17.680]  unfold like clockwork now the headlines are 150 to $200 a barrel because your
[2:16:17.680 --> 2:16:22.040]  inside oil company execs are running in the same group as the head of shell and
[2:16:22.040 --> 2:16:26.520]  others now saying the exact same thing because they're covering a blueprint
[2:16:26.520 --> 2:16:31.720]  no one could have ever possibly have known this without them telling it to you
[2:16:31.720 --> 2:16:36.600]  I could not have guessed this even if I had tried there's no way the little
[2:16:36.600 --> 2:16:41.360]  insignificant guy sitting down here could possibly have ever conjured all of this
[2:16:41.360 --> 2:16:46.960]  up and been right there three single time for 35 years now this morning in
[2:16:46.960 --> 2:16:53.240]  Europe gasoline right now I was speaking on the air gasoline is eight dollars and
[2:16:53.240 --> 2:16:59.360]  32 cents a liter but cars will be a cut off 1.6 million barrels of oil it cars
[2:16:59.360 --> 2:17:04.320]  the price of gasoline to grow up everywhere across Europe folks you are
[2:17:04.320 --> 2:17:08.080]  going to see the identical same thing happen in the United States of America
[2:17:08.080 --> 2:17:12.440]  when I remember that was eight dollars and 32 cents a liter in the United States
[2:17:12.440 --> 2:17:17.120]  of America you're going to see four and five and maybe even six dollars a gallon
[2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:22.520]  Garland Sacks warned all their investors on yesterday you can go look this up for
[2:17:22.520 --> 2:17:27.840]  yourself and they said there is a day of rage did you rather Muslim brotherhood

[2:17:36.960 --> 2:17:41.440]  succeed in what they're going to do but Garland Sacks said the Muslim brotherhood
[2:17:41.440 --> 2:17:47.020]  has scheduled a day of rage this weekend if they succeed that's exactly what
[2:17:47.020 --> 2:17:50.720]  Garland warned the people who play the future well that's what you were saying
[2:17:50.720 --> 2:17:54.920]  three weeks ago let Lindsey Lindsey Lindsey three weeks ago you were the
[2:17:54.920 --> 2:17:59.040]  first to say day of rage this is going to be the trigger I've been told Saudi

[2:18:29.920 --> 2:18:34.640]  I'm not saying this will happen now I was not told by the elite that this will
[2:18:34.640 --> 2:18:38.160]  happen I'm talking about going with Sacks said it to their investors
[2:18:38.160 --> 2:18:42.840]  yesterday that if the Muslim brotherhood exceed succeed this weekend with

[2:18:48.080 --> 2:18:53.920]  or you could see gasoline at the gas pump $6 to $7 a gallon now I didn't say
[2:18:53.920 --> 2:18:58.720]  that I did not say the elite told me that and don't you dare misquote me all of

[2:22:07.600 --> 2:22:11.760]  natural invisible empire is a damning indictment of the globalist through their

[2:24:12.560 --> 2:24:16.480]  that break but I've analyzed all the things that mr. Fromm and the other guy
[2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:20.720]  told you and they've all come true except for one of them and when you got
[2:24:20.720 --> 2:24:24.360]  one of these old guys some of it's gonna be speculation like they won't fix that
[2:24:24.360 --> 2:24:29.200]  oil leak it's under too much pressure well they did fix most of it it's still
[2:24:29.200 --> 2:24:36.000]  leaking today out of fractures but I mean you know nobody's infallible but I
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:40.240]  mean if people don't like what you're saying and you're telling them when
[2:24:40.240 --> 2:24:43.680]  you've been right about 95% of the time then they don't need to listen so that's
[2:24:43.680 --> 2:24:46.920]  why I say don't spend time on that Lindsey let's let's go to phone calls
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:51.680]  while we've got you here today and we appreciate you joining us Larry and Iowa
[2:24:51.680 --> 2:24:55.320]  than Mike Joe Joe Michael and others Larry you're on the air with Lindsey
[2:24:55.320 --> 2:24:59.400]  Williams the question or comment V for victory and we are the resistance
[2:24:59.400 --> 2:25:07.960]  that nice to talk to you guys I got a proposal about you know nationalizing
[2:25:07.960 --> 2:25:12.000]  our domestic oil and you'd have to do that in conjunction probably with
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:18.960]  abolishing the Fed and getting up a panel of a patriot economists to govern
[2:25:18.960 --> 2:25:27.120]  that but you know I haven't really heard that talked about much comments Lindsey
[2:25:27.120 --> 2:25:34.040]  yes how do you default or how do they the elite how they do they default on the
[2:25:34.040 --> 2:25:39.280]  national debt graciously and have an excuse for doing it I think this is
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:43.560]  basically what I will call is talking about it this will happen and the only
[2:25:43.560 --> 2:25:47.840]  way in the world to for those two bills and federal reserve issues to
[2:25:47.840 --> 2:25:52.960]  basically default they'll ever pay off the national debt they know that the
[2:25:52.960 --> 2:25:56.000]  interest on the national debt can't be paid anymore because countries are not
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:59.800]  coming in and buying the federal reserve issues how do they default on this and
[2:25:59.800 --> 2:26:04.600]  get out of it graciously only one way conflict the Middle East take proof our
[2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:09.720]  prices so high the American economy continued to integrate till the American
[2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:13.360]  dollar becomes almost worthless and you take a little borrow to the grocery store
[2:26:13.360 --> 2:26:18.800]  to get a loaf of bread at that point it will be very easy to default on the
[2:26:18.800 --> 2:26:25.840]  national debt of 14 trillion dollars the TBRs that China all producing
[2:26:25.840 --> 2:26:29.160]  countries of the world have battled with these years as Mr. Kissinger made the
[2:26:29.160 --> 2:26:33.960]  deal with them at that point they are burnt bankrupt overnight and they
[2:26:33.960 --> 2:26:40.720]  realized that they have been double-crossed it is a gross way of
[2:26:40.720 --> 2:26:47.880]  getting out from under the national debt graciously all right thank you so much
[2:26:47.880 --> 2:26:53.320]  Larry let's talk to Mike in North Carolina you're on the air Mike hey
[2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:57.120]  Alex and Pastor Williams how's everybody today good good uh Pastor
[2:26:57.120 --> 2:27:01.600]  Williams as a God-fearing man I'm sure you are where's the religion aspect in
[2:27:01.600 --> 2:27:05.840]  all this I mean if people aren't awake to what's really going on in the in the
[2:27:05.840 --> 2:27:11.480]  world they're they're dumber than a box of rocks and unfortunately with God you
[2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:16.480]  mean if you book a revelation clearly a lot of people claim they speak for God
[2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:20.120]  and so you got all these denominations controlled by the World Council of
[2:27:20.120 --> 2:27:24.280]  Churches and the clergy response teams run by the FEMA and the federal
[2:27:24.280 --> 2:27:28.240]  government telling people to love tyranny so the church is absent in
[2:27:28.240 --> 2:27:32.280]  America the real church helped found this country and now the counterfeit
[2:27:32.280 --> 2:27:35.960]  church is helping kill this country I appreciate your call Mike any comments
[2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:40.880]  on that Lindsey the devil Messiah you remember I gave this on your program back
[2:27:40.880 --> 2:27:44.520]  all about two three years ago yeah that's their term for taking over the
[2:27:44.520 --> 2:27:49.800]  church yeah every bit of it fits in because they had to destroy the God that
[2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:54.360]  made America great in order to be able to bring about the new world order and
[2:27:54.360 --> 2:27:58.320]  you must you must understand what they're talking about when they say the
[2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:02.200]  devil Messiah and yes I'm very upset with the ministers of America today all
[2:28:02.200 --> 2:28:08.760]  so but I'm also the American people it's so sad our down through history man has
[2:28:08.760 --> 2:28:12.520]  worshiped something I have never seen it and I love the history student I'm
[2:28:12.520 --> 2:28:16.280]  on it in history and college I have never seen a time when he would have
[2:28:16.280 --> 2:28:20.880]  been seen to have no God consciousness as much as they do today it is very
[2:28:20.880 --> 2:28:25.120]  disturbing to me because if ever people should be turning well they're empty I
[2:28:25.120 --> 2:28:28.560]  mean I mean they're empty they're not tuned into things they're just kind of
[2:28:28.560 --> 2:28:32.480]  like bestial zombies running around gibbering like demons
[2:28:32.480 --> 2:28:36.160]  our down through history to worship something if it wasn't anything but a
[2:28:36.160 --> 2:28:41.000]  stick or a stone of the Sun of the moon they worship something but today people
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:46.680]  seem to have no God to God consciousness of worshiping anything and it's appalling
[2:28:46.680 --> 2:28:52.120]  at the very time they should be turning to him for answers Alex very well said
[2:28:52.120 --> 2:28:56.160]  Lindsay Williams Crammond one more long segment coming up Joe in Florida you're

[2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:17.760]  who was disabled at a young age the other day but if you wanted to invest
[2:29:17.760 --> 2:29:21.920]  principle and needed to hedge you know to protect your principal against the
[2:29:21.920 --> 2:29:27.040]  devaluation of the dollar but needed some type of dividends from your principle
[2:29:27.040 --> 2:29:33.920]  you know because you didn't count on your SSI in the future what would be a
[2:29:33.920 --> 2:29:38.560]  safe investment okay well we'll try to answer that on the other side going into
[2:29:38.560 --> 2:29:41.720]  a meltdown like this there's no silver bullet but I'll give you my view we'll

[2:30:17.720 --> 2:30:22.080]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:26.400]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[2:30:26.400 --> 2:30:30.160]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four

[2:34:30.520 --> 2:34:34.760]  calls here with Lindsay Williams but answering Joe in Florida's question I
[2:34:34.760 --> 2:34:41.720]  would just give the answer that you want to invest in something where you get a
[2:34:41.720 --> 2:34:47.200]  return you know where it's a safe investment and you get a dividend and
[2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:50.960]  you know they always say hedge your bets and things but then people never
[2:34:50.960 --> 2:34:55.360]  understand gold and silver they go away I buy gold and silver now as the dollar
[2:34:55.360 --> 2:34:58.920]  devalues later I cash it in for the dollar but those are still worthless
[2:34:58.920 --> 2:35:02.640]  dollars no they've been devalued so let's say you buy gold at two hundred and
[2:35:02.640 --> 2:35:08.480]  sixty dollars an ounce eleven years ago and now it's fourteen hundred and you
[2:35:08.480 --> 2:35:12.960]  know 30 or whatever it's at today well what's called today 1440 I forget the
[2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:22.000]  point is so see the dollars devalued that much in the 11 years from 260
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:26.120]  something an ounce to 1400 something an ounce and so now you go turn that gold
[2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:30.640]  coin in you bought a 260 that ounce and they go here's fourteen hundred and
[2:35:30.640 --> 2:35:35.360]  thirty something dollars or more and people are like I don't understand what
[2:35:35.360 --> 2:35:38.760]  you're saying that's too confusing and I'm like I don't know what else I can do
[2:35:38.760 --> 2:35:45.240]  for you I I just don't I can't help them I mean I really can't help and and
[2:35:45.240 --> 2:35:48.520]  maybe I'm the bad man maybe Lindsay's bad for telling you oil would go up and
[2:35:48.520 --> 2:35:52.960]  it's right again in fact we should probably apologize right now that we
[2:35:52.960 --> 2:35:58.040]  said by golden silver and they're both up over four hundred percent but I mean
[2:35:58.040 --> 2:36:01.720]  and there are some other investments if you got enough money you could buy into
[2:36:01.720 --> 2:36:05.000]  the right farming stocks the right commodity stocks we told you that with
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:09.520]  investor experts the last decade we've been right on every front but it's not
[2:36:09.520 --> 2:36:13.800]  that we're even smart the globalist all invest in this while telling chumps to
[2:36:13.800 --> 2:36:19.640]  invest in everything else it's like telling people not to play in traffic I
[2:36:19.640 --> 2:36:23.000]  mean Lindsay does it ever and I'm not saying the collars question was stupid
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:26.240]  I'm just keep going back to people that still don't understand gold and silver
[2:36:26.240 --> 2:36:31.720]  they're like why do you want my fiat money if it ain't worth nothing well
[2:36:31.720 --> 2:36:35.560]  because then we take it and we get gold ourselves well then what do you cash the
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:43.440]  golden for if it's gonna be fiat but the fiat's been devalued so then I'll get
[2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:49.880]  more of it back it freezes the inflation they're like huh and and sometimes
[2:36:49.880 --> 2:36:53.120]  you just can't you can lead a horse to water you can't make them drink Lindsay
[2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:59.360]  Alex right here on your show in three years ago I'm sure that you're
[2:36:59.360 --> 2:37:03.680]  producer can go back and pull it up he wants to I said that I had just been
[2:37:03.680 --> 2:37:09.640]  on the phone with my elitist friend and I was a exasperated I look at my own son
[2:37:09.640 --> 2:37:14.600]  and my wife and my family and I say how can I provide for them this man had
[2:37:14.600 --> 2:37:20.200]  told me what they were going to do how the price was going up from 147 to 50
[2:37:20.200 --> 2:37:23.240]  how it was going to be there for two and a half years how it would go back up
[2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:26.480]  again he did not tell me about the Middle East crisis right now until
[2:37:26.480 --> 2:37:33.640]  later and at the time I said what can't I do I said my family what do I do he
[2:37:33.640 --> 2:37:37.840]  said to me he said Jacqueline there is only one way that you can spare your
[2:37:37.840 --> 2:37:42.680]  assets and he said that is our currency I actually remember me saying that he
[2:37:42.680 --> 2:37:47.960]  said it is our currency I asked him the question I said what is your currency he
[2:37:47.960 --> 2:37:51.360]  said our currency is gold and silver he said if it's written on a piece of
[2:37:51.360 --> 2:37:55.520]  paper it's worth the paper it's written on and I came back on your show three
[2:37:55.520 --> 2:38:00.520]  years ago and I said when you could buy gold for $700 an ounce I begged with you
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:05.520]  I pleaded with you I got everything but got on my knees and cried and asked you
[2:38:05.520 --> 2:38:11.000]  to go and buy gold at $700 an ounce and I want you to apologize right now and
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:17.040]  I'm gonna apologize I'm sorry I told people to buy it at 260 I'm sorry I told
[2:38:17.040 --> 2:38:23.520]  people to buy silver at $5 and now it's at 35 Lindsay you're bad for telling the
[2:38:23.520 --> 2:38:28.160]  truth and being right I'm bad we're bad the government lying to people on

[2:38:52.680 --> 2:38:58.240]  told me it's going it is going to two and three thousand dollars an ounce for
[2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:02.160]  gold mark my words put it down beside you tell it to don't you call me a
[2:39:02.160 --> 2:39:06.720]  profit you say that mr. Williams a leaf friend told him and why are they gonna
[2:39:06.720 --> 2:39:10.800]  take it there there's a reason why this is just as important as the fact is
[2:39:10.800 --> 2:39:15.120]  going there because the dollar will be good I didn't say non-existent did by
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:21.680]  the end of 2012 and in order to bring in a new world courage you've heard Alex
[2:39:21.680 --> 2:39:25.320]  Jones talk about this for years folks please believe every words you're
[2:39:25.320 --> 2:39:29.000]  hearing him say on info world listen to him every day and don't miss a word of
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:32.840]  it whenever they come out with a new world currency it will be backed by
[2:39:32.840 --> 2:39:37.040]  gold they cannot do it at a thousand dollars an ounce or two hundred and
[2:39:37.040 --> 2:39:42.120]  fifty dollars an ounce they've got to do it at three to four thousand dollars an
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:47.080]  ounce and you take the gold that Alex and I have begged you to buy for the last
[2:39:47.080 --> 2:39:51.280]  three years turn around and it'll be worth three to four thousand dollars an
[2:39:51.280 --> 2:39:59.200]  ounce by the new world and we'll be bad guys again we'll be evil we're bad we're
[2:39:59.200 --> 2:40:03.760]  bad for why is it in this sick demonic world now though that telling the truth
[2:40:03.760 --> 2:40:08.200]  and being right is bad when you're wrong you're hailed it's like oh you know
[2:40:08.200 --> 2:40:12.000]  these guys on TV keep lying to me and giving me bad info but they're wearing
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:18.040]  fancy suits with teleprompters but then when you're right it's bad well Alex
[2:40:18.040 --> 2:40:21.600]  you've been right you've been right over the years I've followed you before you
[2:40:21.600 --> 2:40:27.440]  ever even knew me and I what you've said has come true exactly as you have said
[2:40:27.440 --> 2:40:32.400]  it you got yours from many different sources I received mine from the elite
[2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:36.200]  only two of them in particular over these years have been willing to give me
[2:40:36.200 --> 2:40:40.920]  this information and then of course the latest one who said I'm too old to care
[2:40:40.920 --> 2:40:44.640]  just going to tell the world everything and Alex at that point I pulled out all
[2:40:44.640 --> 2:40:50.320]  the stops and total everything and I was just doing it I'm not going to go into
[2:40:50.320 --> 2:40:55.600]  either because you've got to know what's going you do not have to lose sleep over
[2:40:55.600 --> 2:41:00.240]  this you do not need to look for black helicopters and look behind bushes if
[2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:03.840]  you'll take the advice of the elite because they're the ones that are doing
[2:41:03.840 --> 2:41:09.440]  it and do what would seem right to do in light of what they're going to do you
[2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:14.080]  can spare yourself heartache and pain in light of what's about to happen what
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:18.320]  the inevitable is Alex absolutely I want to go back to the calls and of course
[2:41:18.320 --> 2:41:22.120]  I was being sarcastic earlier we should be appreciated and thanked and we are by
[2:41:22.120 --> 2:41:27.800]  many people it's just that the gibbering masses who will not take our advice
[2:41:27.800 --> 2:41:34.000]  become more enraged as we become more and more you know confirmed as everything
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:39.520]  we talk about becomes more and more certified and bonafide they they become
[2:41:39.520 --> 2:41:43.680]  more fearful and they say it's your fault the economy's imploding you
[2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:49.000]  destroyed confidence or no gold and silver isn't a good investment or you
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:54.600]  didn't say oil was going to go up it's not true and it's I mean I've run into
[2:41:54.600 --> 2:41:59.560]  this with with more distant family at family reunions and events I'll see
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:06.040]  cousins and people or you know some of my in-laws family and I'll tell them
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:11.760]  remember six seven years ago at the birthday party I said buy gold and it
[2:42:11.760 --> 2:42:16.720]  was 400 bucks an ounce then and they go yeah I know but you know what are you a
[2:42:16.720 --> 2:42:22.520]  financial planner you advise and I go well you know now it's gone up 300
[2:42:22.520 --> 2:42:28.080]  400 bucks yeah it's the best hold on hold on and then I saw him again about a
[2:42:28.080 --> 2:42:34.160]  year ago and I said well it was 300 and now it's you know almost 1400 and I said
[2:42:34.160 --> 2:42:38.340]  and they thought I was showing off to put them down and laughed at me and said
[2:42:38.340 --> 2:42:43.800]  I basically had no financial acumen and I said but wait I was right I'm trying to
[2:42:43.800 --> 2:42:48.680]  tell you this to help you not to show off you stupid yuppie you know I mean
[2:42:48.680 --> 2:42:53.440]  it's like it's like they're drowning out there in the water and you try to
[2:42:53.440 --> 2:42:58.840]  throw them a life raft and they stab it with daggers and go no don't show off
[2:42:58.840 --> 2:43:04.440]  and just stab stab it's like it's it's like they want to be run over the
[2:43:04.440 --> 2:43:09.160]  people want to lose they want to fail their religion is about being weak I
[2:43:09.160 --> 2:43:14.200]  don't know what do you call that the greatest financial planner on the face
[2:43:14.200 --> 2:43:18.800]  of this earth Alex is the elite are you gotta do is listen to them and I've
[2:43:18.800 --> 2:43:22.360]  written three books trying to explain the mindset of these people after we are
[2:43:22.360 --> 2:43:25.960]  out of print now maybe I should put all three of them back in print again when
[2:43:25.960 --> 2:43:32.000]  you understand you were ordered from Daddy Bush when you understand a thousand
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:35.800]  parts of white from Daddy Bush you'll be able to know exactly what to do
[2:43:35.800 --> 2:43:41.040]  listen to the elite I listened to my friends and when they said the gold was
[2:43:41.040 --> 2:43:44.960]  the only thing I could spare my assets in I invested in Golden Silver let me
[2:43:44.960 --> 2:43:48.800]  say emphatically right now I do not sell Golden Silver you couldn't buy a penny
[2:43:48.800 --> 2:43:53.480]  from me if you tried to Alex says people on these shows you where to go and buy
[2:43:53.480 --> 2:43:57.160]  from all I'm trying to do is tell you the truth so you can spare your dinner
[2:43:57.160 --> 2:44:03.560]  table in coming days Alex well to be clear I sure sell Golden Silver and I
[2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:07.080]  try to get folks to buy firearms to you know I don't sell firearms we need some
[2:44:07.080 --> 2:44:11.200]  sponsors by the way good firearms manufacturers I mean I mean I promote
[2:44:11.200 --> 2:44:14.960]  what I believe in because I sleep good at night and and I hope folks call minus
[2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:18.280]  resources and take advantage of those three silver dollars three of my best
[2:44:18.280 --> 2:44:22.200]  selling films and free shipping for a hundred and ten dollars that's about a
[2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:26.800]  sixty five dollar a value you can't beat it eight hundred six eight six two
[2:44:26.800 --> 2:44:31.560]  two three seven eight hundred six eight six two two three seven don't screw
[2:44:31.560 --> 2:44:36.320]  around don't wait let's go back to the calls but Joe other investments for you
[2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:40.880]  look I don't know your personal standing or we know the lay of your
[2:44:40.880 --> 2:44:45.680]  financial landscape so I can't give you advice I just tell you what I would do
[2:44:45.680 --> 2:44:52.160]  and it's real simple let's go ahead and I would buy Bullion Golden Silver and
[2:44:52.160 --> 2:44:58.480]  then you know hide it big time let's talk to Joe in Pennsylvania Joe you're on
[2:44:58.480 --> 2:45:05.400]  the air welcome hey Alex I feel sorry for you maybe if you use the paper and
[2:45:05.400 --> 2:45:12.600]  crayon and use smaller words that could help I got my my book my DVDs and my
[2:45:12.600 --> 2:45:17.360]  four gold or silver coins from minus resources when it was twenty seven
[2:45:17.360 --> 2:45:24.760]  dollars an ounce and but anyway and now it's 35 an ounce I apologize you must
[2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:28.840]  have bought that a week or two ago and you've made a huge profit I'm sorry Joe
[2:45:28.840 --> 2:45:33.880]  well your apologies now tell me I'm bad right now I'm scum you're horrible for
[2:45:33.880 --> 2:45:41.360]  making me money okay you're horrible but for mr. Williams it's an honor to talk
[2:45:41.360 --> 2:45:47.360]  to you and you answered part of my question while I was listening but I'm
[2:45:47.360 --> 2:45:52.280]  going back to when Kissinger made the deal with the Middle East about selling
[2:45:52.280 --> 2:45:57.480]  the oil and in the dollars and that they would have to buy a certain amount of
[2:45:57.480 --> 2:46:02.520]  our bonds and then I was listening another time when you were talking with
[2:46:02.520 --> 2:46:09.080]  Alex and and he said that you're gonna open up the North Slope in Alaska and
[2:46:09.080 --> 2:46:14.840]  other oil fields that we have in this country now my question is this do you
[2:46:14.840 --> 2:46:19.560]  think that the elite because the Middle East said you know what we're not going
[2:46:19.560 --> 2:46:23.840]  to sell on dollars anymore we're going to get out of this that they had this
[2:46:23.840 --> 2:46:27.960]  planned all along and they're kind of like spanking the Middle East on the
[2:46:27.960 --> 2:46:33.080]  rear end saying this is what you get for messing with us and my next question
[2:46:33.080 --> 2:46:37.760]  after that was as far as investing what do you think about investing in oil
[2:46:37.760 --> 2:46:42.600]  futures now knowing that it's going to go up to make money well it's so detailed
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:46.920]  and complex I'm sorry go ahead Lindsey if it's written on a piece of paper it's
[2:46:46.920 --> 2:46:50.680]  worth the paper it's written on and he stressed that to me over and over and
[2:46:50.680 --> 2:46:55.040]  over and over and I asked you about it many times he said Chaplin if it's
[2:46:55.040 --> 2:46:58.320]  written on a piece of paper it's worth the paper it's written on as far as
[2:46:58.320 --> 2:47:04.360]  that planning all of this is concerned I think my record of predictions based on
[2:47:04.360 --> 2:47:09.000]  what they've told me shows that they have planned this in advance they knew
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:12.360]  everything they were going to do two three four and five years in advance yeah
[2:47:12.360 --> 2:47:16.840]  they're planning a complete meltdown that's why they're preparing foreign
[2:47:16.840 --> 2:47:20.400]  troops it doesn't mean they'll do it it doesn't mean they'll go all the way but
[2:47:20.400 --> 2:47:25.280]  on this continuum of force we know they're going to project it downfield we
[2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:29.600]  don't know they're going to get 20 yards 50 yards 100 yards or how much force
[2:47:29.600 --> 2:47:33.640]  they want to use on the lever they don't want to blow their race car engine but
[2:47:33.640 --> 2:47:37.840]  the point is they're ready and committed to their plan with absolute military
[2:47:37.840 --> 2:47:43.480]  occupation total destruction of all currency and total enslavement I mean
[2:47:43.480 --> 2:47:48.600]  that's on the table uh-oh uh-oh Pastor Williams the fast on the debt you're
[2:47:48.600 --> 2:47:53.080]  exactly right they have to find a gracious amount of in order to the fast
[2:47:53.080 --> 2:47:56.720]  on this debt so the American people will not accuse them for all the problems
[2:47:56.720 --> 2:48:01.080]  that they've created and they're going to do it and this is what I give in my
[2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:05.520]  very latest DVD series the Middle East the rest of the crisis I try the
[2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:10.320]  intricate details of how they're doing all of this so Alex yes you're exactly
[2:48:10.320 --> 2:48:15.080]  right they have to find a way to do this but and they will succeed I'm not
[2:48:15.080 --> 2:48:18.440]  saying that the Muslim brotherhood this weekend will do everything they say
[2:48:18.440 --> 2:48:22.440]  they're going to Saudi Arabia but give them time and they will because they're
[2:48:22.440 --> 2:48:27.600]  the ones that they're fine and spy they're financed by MI six and Soros on
[2:48:27.600 --> 2:48:32.000]  record here's the economist just as the world economy was recovering it was
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:38.600]  never recovering they it shows the globe with an oil barrel as a bomb with a
[2:48:38.600 --> 2:48:42.680]  fuse on it about to blow the planet up and I've already seen and I predict
[2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:45.560]  there's a few months ago but now you see him doing it because you know their
[2:48:45.560 --> 2:48:49.640]  next play when you study them they're already scapegoating the global
[2:48:49.640 --> 2:48:53.720]  financial meltdown on what's happening in the Middle East exactly what you said
[2:48:53.720 --> 2:48:57.800]  four and a half five months ago that they would destroy the Arabs because
[2:48:57.800 --> 2:49:02.680]  they're the biggest owner in the aggregate of the debt thus mortally
[2:49:02.680 --> 2:49:07.200]  wounding the dollar that's why the Wall Street Journal came out on Monday and
[2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:12.920]  said the end of the dollar is here fact let me pull out that article they said
[2:49:12.920 --> 2:49:16.880]  the end of the dollar is nigh and promoted it like it was a good deal
[2:49:16.880 --> 2:49:22.040]  they are bringing in the chaos to then bring in their order it is their
[2:49:22.040 --> 2:49:26.560]  strategy and people ignore that at their peril Joe I appreciate your call we're
[2:49:26.560 --> 2:49:29.600]  gonna keep Lindsay five minutes in the next hour than Aaron Dykes for a
[2:49:29.600 --> 2:49:33.600]  segment or two with information that again dovetails with all of this with
[2:49:33.600 --> 2:49:41.800]  the absolute treason brazen mafia takeover of the coal power plants because
[2:49:41.800 --> 2:49:44.520]  they're not just gonna cut off the oil from the Middle East they want to shut
[2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:49.000]  down all their competition rape us more financially you think your power bill
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:52.120]  doubling and on average the last two years of Obama shutting down power
[2:49:52.120 --> 2:49:55.160]  plants is anything the head of the energy department says they're gonna shut
[2:49:55.160 --> 2:49:59.560]  down massive amounts anybody who in George Soros or General Electric running
[2:49:59.560 --> 2:50:04.920]  the White House is over it is over these people are mafia they are brutal and
[2:50:04.920 --> 2:50:10.080]  then when the poor people are starving in the streets they'll turn them loose on
[2:50:10.080 --> 2:50:14.000]  the general public and demand total socialism to feed chicken feed to the
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:18.920]  starving unwashed masses who will then become their brown shirt TSA goons who
[2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:22.320]  will slit your family's throat with pleasure I'm not trying to scare you

[2:54:24.280 --> 2:54:29.280]  that Lindsay Williams is gonna have shipping out on Friday but continuing here's
[2:54:29.280 --> 2:54:34.520]  some of the new news at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com again integrating them
[2:54:34.520 --> 2:54:40.080]  with exactly what Lindsay was just talking about. Day of Rage Saudi Arabia
[2:54:40.080 --> 2:54:44.760]  unveiled threat to the United States as the world braces itself for Saudi
[2:54:44.760 --> 2:54:49.960]  Arabia's Day of Rage on Friday which many fear could be the spark that sends oil
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:55.040]  prices soaring beyond $200 a barrel mark. Saudi foreign minister Prince Saud
[2:54:55.040 --> 2:54:59.200]  Al-Faisal issued a veiled threat to the United States warning that the kingdom
[2:54:59.200 --> 2:55:03.960]  was prepared to cut foreign fingers in the event of any outside interference.
[2:55:03.960 --> 2:55:08.360]  Saudi Arabia now is figuring out they're being double-crossed because
[2:55:08.360 --> 2:55:12.120]  they're about to have their T-bills devalued. The Day of Rage has been
[2:55:12.120 --> 2:55:17.040]  organized by Saudi use using Facebook it's all CIA run. Again it's the globalist
[2:55:17.040 --> 2:55:22.080]  turning on their old puppets. Soros says communist Chinese model of order may
[2:55:22.080 --> 2:55:26.280]  become the envy of the world. Western democracies provide less successful
[2:55:26.280 --> 2:55:30.520]  leadership than China. That's more David Rockefeller propaganda. These people are
[2:55:30.520 --> 2:55:37.720]  open tyrannous, maximus, maximum tyrants. I am these people are a bunch of baby
[2:55:37.720 --> 2:55:43.000]  stalling baby hitlers trying to get up on their legs man. Stop licking their
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:46.840]  boots as they put in TSA body scanners nationwide and try to stick their
[2:55:46.840 --> 2:55:51.920]  hands down our pants. They're trying to break our will. Lindsey Williams looking
[2:55:51.920 --> 2:55:55.840]  at this I mean you said it the Middle East four and a half months ago the
[2:55:55.840 --> 2:55:59.520]  trigger for the global meltdown their scapegoat and now the economist
[2:55:59.520 --> 2:56:05.080]  Bilderberg group publication saying the exact same thing Lindsey. Yes in one of
[2:56:05.080 --> 2:56:09.960]  these days after they have told you what they're doing the first words as Alec
[2:56:09.960 --> 2:56:14.120]  has just mentioned tells you everything they're going to do and then they turn
[2:56:14.120 --> 2:56:17.800]  around if you want from now after they've already done it and say we told
[2:56:17.800 --> 2:56:22.960]  you so why didn't you listen? Why don't people sit up and listen to what these
[2:56:22.960 --> 2:56:26.720]  people you are going to be paying six seven and eight dollars a gallon of the
[2:56:26.720 --> 2:56:30.600]  gas pump. That'll be your fault for warning them. The bankers love them the
[2:56:30.600 --> 2:56:33.720]  government's gonna help them. Michael Moore cares. We're gonna before you leave
[2:56:33.720 --> 2:56:36.600]  us the next time we give that number out again but right now it's jam these calls
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:41.560]  and Michael in Texas you're on the air. Quick question sir. Yes question and
[2:56:41.560 --> 2:56:45.360]  quick comment. Hey gentlemen don't feel bad about what you're doing. I'm almost
[2:56:45.360 --> 2:56:49.600]  in Paris quoting the scripture with Lindsey here. Isaiah the prophet in
[2:56:49.600 --> 2:56:54.680]  chapter 30 verse 10 he threw his hands up in the air because he was trying to
[2:56:54.680 --> 2:56:58.000]  warn the people and all they would do is come back to him and say tell us
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:01.960]  illusions tell us smooth things tell us what we want to hear. This is human
[2:57:01.960 --> 2:57:06.280]  nature gentlemen so don't feel bad. You're warning the people and the ones
[2:57:06.280 --> 2:57:11.200]  that listen have listened. I just placed another order with Ted Anderson's
[2:57:11.200 --> 2:57:15.520]  brother over at Midas Resources for Silver. I've been reading Porter
[2:57:15.520 --> 2:57:21.080]  Stansbury's publications for years. I just bought another membership at
[2:57:21.080 --> 2:57:26.240]  front site to get my firearms training. The people who you're trying to warn
[2:57:26.240 --> 2:57:31.400]  they're listening so don't feel bad. This is just human nature. People have
[2:57:31.400 --> 2:57:35.920]  always been like this and I don't understand it myself. Some of them
[2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:38.800]  like to lose. Do you have a question real quick because we're almost out of
[2:57:38.800 --> 2:57:42.400]  time. I got to get to other callers. Do you have any questions for Lindsey? Yeah
[2:57:42.400 --> 2:57:47.680]  quick question. I understand Pastor that we're gonna try to double cross or
[2:57:47.680 --> 2:57:51.520]  we're going to double cross Saudi Arabia. Now they don't have a military to
[2:57:51.520 --> 2:57:56.640]  respond. We're their muscle in the Middle East. We're their protector as far as the
[2:57:56.640 --> 2:58:01.640]  military is concerned. Think more about is China. We owe them a lot of money and
[2:58:01.640 --> 2:58:07.480]  they just brought a submarine up off of California and in a saber-rattling move
[2:58:07.480 --> 2:58:12.320]  lost a missile. How are we going to double cross China and think we're gonna
[2:58:12.320 --> 2:58:16.600]  get away with it? Well the other cross is going to be the defense on the national
[2:58:16.600 --> 2:58:20.200]  debt. This has to happen because Washington knows they can't pay it off.
[2:58:20.200 --> 2:58:24.680]  And now the nations are showing up to buy the debuts of the Federal Reserve
[2:58:24.680 --> 2:58:29.800]  issues and as a result last week, I mean this is starting, as of last week the
[2:58:29.800 --> 2:58:34.320]  Federal Reserve surpassed China is the largest parameter of the United States debt.
[2:58:34.320 --> 2:58:38.720]  I mean the bankers are getting ready to cheat all the people that invested
[2:58:38.720 --> 2:58:41.760]  with them. Stay with us.

[2:59:10.520 --> 2:59:14.880]  existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[2:59:14.880 --> 2:59:18.840]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has
[2:59:18.840 --> 2:59:22.880]  established an old powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the

[2:59:37.240 --> 2:59:41.960]  new world order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[2:59:58.520 --> 3:00:01.800]  Network.
[3:00:14.240 --> 3:00:18.560]  I'm trying to get to as many of your calls as I can here with Lindsay Williams.
[3:00:18.560 --> 3:00:24.040]  Lindsay, before I forget, ProposyClub.com to get the Middle East, the rest of the
[3:00:24.040 --> 3:00:29.080]  story, 3DVDSet, but also what's that number one more time for folks that don't
[3:00:29.080 --> 3:00:55.720]  have it? Well good, folks should get it and get it out to everybody. Let's jam in a
[3:00:55.720 --> 3:00:59.800]  few final calls here. John in Texas, you're on the air with Pastor Lindsay
[3:00:59.800 --> 3:01:05.040]  Williams. Go ahead. Hey Alex, how you doing? Oh, just sitting here, you know,
[3:01:05.040 --> 3:01:10.360]  tracking the globalist. What's on your mind? That's a good thing. I just want to
[3:01:10.360 --> 3:01:16.280]  comment and just on what's being talked about is something I found out and was
[3:01:16.280 --> 3:01:21.600]  very interesting is that there's a person here locally that has a friend
[3:01:21.600 --> 3:01:26.640]  who lives in China, the country of China, and he's like a trends forecaster. He's
[3:01:26.640 --> 3:01:31.400]  like a Gerald Slentate. Okay, what's he saying? He's saying he's crunching the
[3:01:31.400 --> 3:01:37.520]  numbers, he's doing his analysis, and what he's telling this person here
[3:01:37.520 --> 3:01:43.280]  locally that things are going to start to come unraveled here in August. So it's
[3:01:43.280 --> 3:01:46.840]  just a word of the wise and Lindsay. I know you said before in the past, get your
[3:01:46.840 --> 3:01:51.280]  family ready, get your food ready, get your water, gas, probably, you know, pull
[3:01:51.280 --> 3:01:54.560]  money out of an ATM, get it out of a bank, you know, before things do get that.
[3:01:54.560 --> 3:01:59.360]  But that's the information that we're getting from this man in China. And he
[3:01:59.360 --> 3:02:02.920]  said that things will start to come unraveled here in August. So I want to
[3:02:02.920 --> 3:02:05.880]  just throw that out and that's just we're talking five, five and a half months.
[3:02:05.880 --> 3:02:09.240]  Well, notice they've been telling us that the recovery's been great in the last
[3:02:09.240 --> 3:02:13.360]  two years, even though we're in a depression, and now they're telling us,
[3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:18.040]  oh, the Arabs, it's going to cause a meltdown. Appreciate your call, John. Any
[3:02:18.040 --> 3:02:22.640]  comments on what John said, Lindsay? I was given these exact words, and I'll quote
[3:02:22.640 --> 3:02:28.120]  them word for word. I've said it on Alex Jones show about two years ago. He said
[3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:33.160]  to me, he said, China is the big one. Alex, you'll remember me saying that on
[3:02:33.160 --> 3:02:37.000]  your show. He went on to explain what's going to happen with China, how the
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:40.680]  Daddy Bridge brought him out from the closed society of many years ago, and
[3:02:40.680 --> 3:02:45.320]  they moved our industry abroad, and he used the expression and went on to
[3:02:45.320 --> 3:02:50.640]  explain to me what's going to happen. China is the big one, Alex. Absolutely.
[3:02:50.640 --> 3:02:54.280]  Let's try to jam in some more calls here. Let's talk to Jack in Michigan. You're
[3:02:54.280 --> 3:02:59.120]  on the air with Pastor Lindsay Williams. Yes, Pastor Williams, I did read your book,
[3:02:59.120 --> 3:03:04.520]  The Energy Non-Crisis, and my question is, which government agency told the
[3:03:04.520 --> 3:03:09.920]  Alaska Pipeline to only build two pipelines instead of twelve? That's my
[3:03:09.920 --> 3:03:18.440]  first question, and the second one is, you wrote another book called
[3:03:18.440 --> 3:03:23.280]  Where is the Food? Your first book. Can you get this? There's still a copy of that
[3:03:23.280 --> 3:03:27.960]  book somewhere. No, it's out of print. All of those books are presently out of
[3:03:27.960 --> 3:03:32.480]  print. Let me ask you a question. First of all, one day I was with one of these
[3:03:32.480 --> 3:03:36.000]  elitists. We spent quite some time together that day, riding around this
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:41.200]  restaurant, and I asked him, I said, look at all these ecologists out here,
[3:03:41.200 --> 3:03:45.280]  and I said, they're costing you thousands of dollars trying to produce this
[3:03:45.280 --> 3:03:50.240]  pipeline. I said, I understand that you actually give money to support from the
[3:03:50.240 --> 3:03:55.160]  Sierra Club and Greenpeace and all the rest of them. He said, Chaplin, we give to
[3:03:55.160 --> 3:03:58.680]  the Democratic Party, we give to the Republican Party, we give to Greenpeace,
[3:03:58.680 --> 3:04:03.400]  we give to Sierra Club. He said, we do every one of them. Big a mouse every year.
[3:04:03.400 --> 3:04:08.240]  He said, we do it because regardless of who gets in, Democrats or Republicans, we
[3:04:08.240 --> 3:04:13.640]  can control the whole thing on either side. Now, he said, who did what they did that
[3:04:13.640 --> 3:04:18.320]  day? I'll tell you who did it. The oil companies wanted to see to it that oil was
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:22.960]  not given to the American people until they took it to $200 a barrel. Now, the
[3:04:22.960 --> 3:04:26.240]  oil companies did it, and the government backs it up with the fake
[3:04:26.240 --> 3:04:30.360]  environmental movements that are paid for by the oil companies on record to shut
[3:04:30.360 --> 3:04:54.640]  down their competition. That's what they did. Lindsey, thank you so much for joining us.
[3:04:54.640 --> 3:04:58.560]  We're going to talk to you again very, very soon. Thank you so much. We're going
[3:04:58.560 --> 3:05:01.640]  to come back with Aaron Dyke's special report.
[3:05:28.560 --> 3:05:35.560]  Thank you so much for joining us today. We're going to talk to you again very, very soon.
[3:05:58.560 --> 3:06:03.760]  America's Health Care, one American at a time. They helped to create a new world order. We
[3:06:03.760 --> 3:06:09.800]  are part of a new world order. A new world order based upon collective action. Invisible
[3:06:09.800 --> 3:06:14.400]  Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents. The
[3:06:14.400 --> 3:06:19.400]  new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities. It means all
[3:06:19.400 --> 3:06:24.800]  the world under their control. The United Nations would take over America. The Trilateral
[3:06:24.800 --> 3:06:30.360]  Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence
[3:06:30.360 --> 3:06:35.240]  have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government. I believe
[3:06:35.240 --> 3:06:39.760]  first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial
[3:06:39.760 --> 3:06:44.880]  system. Global governance with the establishment of a G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling
[3:06:44.880 --> 3:06:51.080]  elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else. Invisible Empire.
[3:06:51.080 --> 3:06:57.800]  We are copied today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or watch it online in the highest quality
[3:06:57.800 --> 3:07:02.880]  at prisonplanet.tv. There's a man named Dr. Wallach who is anything but your typical
[3:07:02.880 --> 3:07:08.440]  doctor. Both a veterinary and a naturopathic physician, Doc asks, why does the United States
[3:07:08.440 --> 3:07:14.480]  spend more money on health care by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide?
[3:07:14.480 --> 3:07:19.280]  He believes that people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition, taking
[3:07:19.280 --> 3:07:24.840]  charge of their life and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition, not by toxic
[3:07:24.840 --> 3:07:29.760]  prescription drugs leading to side effects. This is clearly a deadly recipe. The good news
[3:07:29.760 --> 3:07:34.040]  is Doc Wallach's message is resonating with an increasing number of Americans who are
[3:07:34.040 --> 3:07:38.760]  waking up to all the big government and big pharma manipulation of our health care system.
[3:07:38.760 --> 3:07:42.920]  I like what Doc Wallach is saying and doing to enlighten people about health care and
[3:07:42.920 --> 3:07:48.560]  have joined forces to help this tireless crusader spread his message. Visit infowarsteam.com
[3:07:48.560 --> 3:07:53.360]  and listen to Dr. Wallach's deadly recipes lecture. It makes a lot of sense and I want
[3:07:53.360 --> 3:08:01.440]  you to join our InfoWars team. Go to infowarsteam.com. That's infowarsteam.com.
[3:08:01.440 --> 3:08:07.360]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's
[3:08:07.360 --> 3:08:12.640]  a war on for your mind.
[3:08:12.640 --> 3:08:21.040]  Alright, we're live into overdrive into the fourth hour. It is the ninth day on this
[3:08:21.040 --> 3:08:30.280]  Wednesday of March 2011. Aaron Dykes is with us here. You know, a few months ago, during
[3:08:30.280 --> 3:08:36.640]  the big ice storms and the power outages, the White House responded to us on WhiteHouse.gov,
[3:08:36.640 --> 3:08:40.320]  the communications director, and said we were liars, that Obama hadn't shut down any
[3:08:40.320 --> 3:08:45.580]  power plants, so we made a video and wrote articles showing they'd shut dozens and dozens
[3:08:45.580 --> 3:08:50.120]  down around the country and, quote, plan to shut down thousands. But again, they think
[3:08:50.120 --> 3:08:54.040]  their audience is a bunch of idiots, a bunch of morons, and I guess some of them are. I
[3:08:54.040 --> 3:08:56.640]  mean, they'd believe anything. They could tell people jump off a cliff and they'd do
[3:08:56.640 --> 3:09:01.280]  it if the government told them. These are cult members. It's like Jim Jones followers.
[3:09:01.280 --> 3:09:06.320]  But these people, even those that are attacking them say, oh, they're environmental wackos.
[3:09:06.320 --> 3:09:11.040]  They think they're saving the earth. No, they don't. These people are invested in biotech
[3:09:11.040 --> 3:09:16.040]  companies openly planning cross species genetic engineered stuff that actually is to endangering
[3:09:16.040 --> 3:09:19.720]  the planet. These people are developing all sorts of weapons systems. They could care
[3:09:19.720 --> 3:09:25.400]  less. They guilt you into letting them take over markets and industries to vertically
[3:09:25.400 --> 3:09:31.400]  integrate it. And then they use it as a tool of control. This is feudalism. This is serfdom.
[3:09:31.400 --> 3:09:34.800]  And now it's in the news. Well, you know what? I'm going to give Aaron Dykes to give us
[3:09:34.800 --> 3:09:40.600]  this report the floor, but every day or two, I see, you know, Reuters, Soros, Albright
[3:09:40.600 --> 3:09:46.920]  invest 250 million and the government's helping fund them. And they're setting up, you know,
[3:09:46.920 --> 3:09:52.360]  power plants in the U S the head of GE gets a waiver on their new power plants. He's the
[3:09:52.360 --> 3:10:00.040]  head of the economic commission, the president's council, just like 1,040 of the insider companies
[3:10:00.040 --> 3:10:04.120]  like McDonald's. They don't have to get health insurance, but this year I've got to start
[3:10:04.120 --> 3:10:09.760]  getting it, but their companies don't. I mean, it's just pure brazen discrimination, but
[3:10:09.760 --> 3:10:14.800]  we only think of discrimination black versus white. Not insiders don't have to pay the
[3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:22.680]  taxes, but the local farm has to shut down. I mean, but people are running around. I'm
[3:10:22.680 --> 3:10:28.000]  a woman. I'm a man. I'm black. I'm white. And they have us all fight with each other.
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:32.400]  Meanwhile, the globalist are a bunch of slimy crooks. So I'm going to go over the history
[3:10:32.400 --> 3:10:38.360]  of the carbon taxes, the sustainability councils and who they really are. They're, they are
[3:10:38.360 --> 3:10:45.440]  literally a mafia, a knuckle dragging mafia. Let's go over air index. Yeah, Alex, you're
[3:10:45.440 --> 3:10:50.320]  absolutely right to bring up the shutdown of the coal plants from back in February, which
[3:10:50.320 --> 3:10:54.720]  they denied, but which was happening right here in Texas. And we're the largest coal
[3:10:54.720 --> 3:10:59.120]  supplier we supplied to many other states. And it's just like a week and a half ago or
[3:10:59.120 --> 3:11:04.440]  whatever it was where they said the era of having on demand electricity is over. And
[3:11:04.440 --> 3:11:07.920]  you know, people talked about how now we're North Korea, that's because they only allow
[3:11:07.920 --> 3:11:13.200]  their people at most two hours of power a day. Well, they're starving their people. They're
[3:11:13.200 --> 3:11:19.760]  starving us in a Neo Malthusian agenda, which is directly tied to agenda 21. And this all
[3:11:19.760 --> 3:11:26.320]  started in a concentrated fashion right after bill, um, the book first Bush agreed to the
[3:11:26.320 --> 3:11:32.120]  agenda 21 and then Bill Clinton immediately started the council for sustainable development.
[3:11:32.120 --> 3:11:37.800]  And that was the announcement in 92, uh, in Rio by morey strong about the post industrial
[3:11:37.800 --> 3:11:42.800]  world. I mean, this is their stated goal. And that was a framework for a whole new society
[3:11:42.800 --> 3:11:49.000]  where consumption is over. Uh, the Judeo Christian West is supposedly over and it's all about
[3:11:49.000 --> 3:11:55.480]  this, uh, micro management by these globalists. And yeah, Bill Clinton in 1993 issued the
[3:11:55.480 --> 3:12:01.480]  agenda 21 through executive order number one, two, eight, five, two, uh, directly setting
[3:12:01.480 --> 3:12:07.000]  up the council for sustainable development. And it's just amazing because you see directly
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:12.200]  right there, the nexus between these energy giants and the supposed environmental people
[3:12:12.200 --> 3:12:16.760]  concerned supposedly about the earth were in bed together from the beginning in this
[3:12:16.760 --> 3:12:21.840]  agenda 21 council set up by, uh, Bill Clinton and of course, continued through the president
[3:12:21.840 --> 3:12:26.760]  not about saving Wales continuum. And it has nothing to do with Obama being supposedly
[3:12:26.760 --> 3:12:31.160]  a socialist because this has been obviously left right all along. And those terms are
[3:12:31.160 --> 3:12:36.960]  all distraction. These are pirates using government to consolidate power and using gaggles of well
[3:12:36.960 --> 3:12:42.760]  meaning socialist who are dependents as political weapons to take over the rest of the economy.
[3:12:42.760 --> 3:12:47.520]  Yeah. Because Enron was known for being in bed with the Bush administration and all that,
[3:12:47.520 --> 3:12:51.800]  but they were in bed with the Clinton administration long before that. And before they came in
[3:12:51.800 --> 3:12:56.600]  up with trading carbon dioxide, they were already, uh, taxing and trading on sulfur
[3:12:56.600 --> 3:13:01.120]  dioxide. Uh, so they've been in this game for a long time. Uh, but it's important to
[3:13:01.120 --> 3:13:07.520]  note that on that council for sustainable development was Ken lay, uh, was a number
[3:13:07.520 --> 3:13:13.800]  of the leading environmental agencies and other people from Enron and other energy companies.
[3:13:13.800 --> 3:13:17.800]  And they have just been a part of this whole thing. And guys, while he's going over these
[3:13:17.800 --> 3:13:22.160]  documents, uh, just scooping in and paying back and forth. So folks can see that over
[3:13:22.160 --> 3:13:26.080]  there. Just scooping in over there. Yeah, go ahead. Thank you. Go ahead. Now again,
[3:13:26.080 --> 3:13:30.760]  that council for sustainable development set up by Clinton in 93, uh, of course really
[3:13:30.760 --> 3:13:37.440]  came to a head around 97 with the Kyoto protocol. And you have not only Ken lay of Enron, but
[3:13:37.440 --> 3:13:44.360]  also John Palmisano of Enron, uh, who was their environmental guy. He put out this
[3:13:44.360 --> 3:13:50.920]  memo, uh, which is known among researchers anyway, who cover this in 1997, saying this
[3:13:50.920 --> 3:13:56.240]  Kyoto stuff, this cap and trade stuff is a win. It's winning, winning, winning for
[3:13:56.240 --> 3:14:00.960]  Enron and anyone who wants to trade this stuff. Uh, let me read a couple excerpts from that
[3:14:00.960 --> 3:14:07.800]  memo from John Palmisano of Enron. If implemented, this agreement would do more to promote Enron's
[3:14:07.800 --> 3:14:12.480]  business than will almost any other regulatory initiative outside of restructuring of the
[3:14:12.480 --> 3:14:17.280]  energy and natural gas industries in Europe and the United States on the business front
[3:14:17.280 --> 3:14:21.520]  during the next year. There will be intense positioning of organizations to capture an
[3:14:21.520 --> 3:14:26.560]  early lead in the variety of carbon trading businesses. The endorsement of joint implementation
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:32.880]  is exactly what we've been lobbying for. And it seems like we won winning. Sorry, I'm
[3:14:32.880 --> 3:14:37.040]  just referencing that. The clean development fund will be a mechanism for funding renewable
[3:14:37.040 --> 3:14:42.720]  projects. Again, we, this being Enron one, the endorsement of admissions trading was
[3:14:42.720 --> 3:14:48.240]  another victory for us. So you see Enron was very excited, uh, at the implementation of
[3:14:48.240 --> 3:14:54.240]  cap and trade because of course they helped design the system under the council for sustainable
[3:14:54.240 --> 3:15:00.200]  development. Uh, and you also see a parallel, uh, because of course this is a military industrial
[3:15:00.200 --> 3:15:05.200]  complex, not only of government, not only of business, uh, but of these nonprofit groups
[3:15:05.200 --> 3:15:10.960]  of the environmental sector. Now the John Heinz three center, which is run by, uh, John
[3:15:10.960 --> 3:15:17.760]  Heinz is the late skull and bones member, uh, Teresa Heinz carry, uh, was his wife now married
[3:15:17.760 --> 3:15:23.760]  to John Kerry, also skull and bones. And that center, uh, wrote this report in 1998 designs
[3:15:23.760 --> 3:15:29.440]  for domestic carbon emissions trading. And you see in their members, uh, a good half of
[3:15:29.440 --> 3:15:36.720]  the staff of the council on sustainable development, including Ken lay, including, um, John Paul
[3:15:36.720 --> 3:15:42.320]  Massamo, also of both of Enron. And you also see Alcoa in that group. You also see the
[3:15:42.320 --> 3:15:48.160]  environmental defense fund who are very important. You see SC Johnson. So it's the big insiders
[3:15:48.160 --> 3:15:53.280]  with a gaggle of, of environmental groups shutting down all their competition. Yeah,
[3:15:53.280 --> 3:15:59.200]  that's it. Because as we discussed yesterday, Enron completely, uh, used the deregulated
[3:15:59.200 --> 3:16:04.480]  energy market in California and the early 2000s to just make a killing. And there's been some
[3:16:04.480 --> 3:16:09.520]  new indictments dealing with carbon tax pump and dump. Yeah, I have that here. Uh, I don't want
[3:16:09.520 --> 3:16:14.800]  to jump around too much. I'm sorry. No, no, no, I just, uh, February 18th. This was only a few
[3:16:14.800 --> 3:16:21.600]  weeks ago, 2011. SCC charges seven people in a global warming pump and dump scheme. Uh, so just
[3:16:21.600 --> 3:16:26.240]  like Enron was always part of those pump and dump schemes. Here we have people involved in the
[3:16:26.240 --> 3:16:31.280]  global warming trading part of the pump and dump scheme. Uh, the securities and exchange commission
[3:16:31.280 --> 3:16:35.920]  today charged a group of seven individuals who perpetrated a fraudulent pump and dump scheme
[3:16:35.920 --> 3:16:40.480]  in the stock of a sham company, perpetrated to provide products and services to fight global
[3:16:40.480 --> 3:16:44.560]  warming. Uh, when you get into the details, you see that they were not only part of this global
[3:16:44.560 --> 3:16:48.800]  warming trading, but they were, of course, laundering money across several countries,
[3:16:48.800 --> 3:16:52.400]  including. Oh, they're good people. All right, let's continue with the friendliness.
[3:16:52.400 --> 3:16:58.000]  Well, look, going back to the, the president's council on sustainable development is a real
[3:16:58.000 --> 3:17:02.960]  powerhouse of business, but also of these supposed environmental groups. And one of the most
[3:17:02.960 --> 3:17:08.880]  important members is Fred Krupp, uh, who's part of the environmental defense fund. And you see,
[3:17:08.880 --> 3:17:13.040]  when we look at what happened in Texas with the coal plants and why they were shut down
[3:17:13.040 --> 3:17:17.200]  for cap and trade reasons, that was right after the Bilderberg group of me, uh, meeting that Perry
[3:17:17.200 --> 3:17:22.400]  was that. Yeah, that's right. And I started tracking it because I was tracking Bilderberg, I was
[3:17:22.400 --> 3:17:27.280]  tracking Perry, I was tracking the toll road. And even back then you said this is about power plants.
[3:17:27.280 --> 3:17:32.000]  Yeah, because they were all about this TXU. They were going to build 11 new coal power plants in
[3:17:32.000 --> 3:17:36.960]  Texas. They cut that down to eight because of this group that I'm talking about, including
[3:17:36.960 --> 3:17:42.400]  Fred Krupp of the environmental defense fund. And I knew it was going on because Goldman Sachs and,
[3:17:42.400 --> 3:17:49.680]  uh, uh, KKR, Kravis, one of the Bilderberg members, they were all over it like flies on, you know what.
[3:17:50.720 --> 3:17:56.000]  But I went back to that report, uh, as to what happened with the TXU buyout to try to understand
[3:17:56.000 --> 3:18:02.160]  why the coal plants were shut down today. And here's this article from 2007, TXU buyout,
[3:18:02.160 --> 3:18:07.440]  Anatomy of a Deal, and who was involved in the environmental, it's the environmental defense
[3:18:07.440 --> 3:18:13.120]  fund. This Fred Krupp was at the meeting, uh, of the Colbert, Kravis, and Roberts and Goldman
[3:18:13.120 --> 3:18:18.480]  Sachs and to Texas Pacific Group buyout. Uh, it was touted as the biggest buyout of all time,
[3:18:18.480 --> 3:18:27.120]  a $45 billion buyout, then cut to $32 billion. And part of that deal was them agreeing to implement
[3:18:27.120 --> 3:18:32.960]  cap and trade and join the US cap, which is the climate action program. They voluntarily joined
[3:18:32.960 --> 3:18:38.880]  it in 2007 before Obama could do anything about it, and they agreed to cut their emissions,
[3:18:38.880 --> 3:18:43.840]  and they agreed to cut back their 11 power plants to only, I believe, three, or at least that's what
[3:18:43.840 --> 3:18:49.200]  they... And they also come in and lobby to buy up city-owned utilities like the old, uh, power plant
[3:18:49.200 --> 3:18:54.160]  Holly Street that supplied much of the city. And they could retrofit it, make it totally clean.
[3:18:54.160 --> 3:18:59.360]  They don't want that. They'd rather give you one hour of power a day and charge you for a week's
[3:18:59.360 --> 3:19:04.560]  worth of it. I mean, did they admit it's about controlling us? That's exactly it. It's profits
[3:19:04.560 --> 3:19:09.600]  in the short term, and in the long term, it's a gender 21 sustainable development, uh, you know,
[3:19:09.600 --> 3:19:14.960]  neo-malthusian starving our consumer, uh, because they don't only want to cut our, uh,
[3:19:14.960 --> 3:19:19.360]  our population numbers and depopulate us, as you know, but they also want to cut back our Western
[3:19:19.360 --> 3:19:24.080]  culture, uh, consumerism because... And this was a trap because they built the infrastructure
[3:19:24.080 --> 3:19:29.360]  where we're dependent on it, where we're not classically, you know, sustainable. They always
[3:19:29.360 --> 3:19:34.640]  create a counterfeit of that. And now they want to strangle us. Yeah. Well, let's come back in
[3:19:34.640 --> 3:19:39.120]  this next segment and go over the rest of it. This is very, very important. Aaron Dykes in here
[3:19:39.120 --> 3:19:44.160]  with us right now live. I'm Alex Jones. This is the GCN Radio Network. You can also see these
[3:19:44.160 --> 3:19:50.800]  articles that Aaron's written at GCNLive.com. Again, that's GCNLive.com. We'll continue on the other
[3:19:50.800 --> 3:19:56.320]  side. When you see these local little environmentalists running around saying shut down power plants,
[3:19:56.320 --> 3:20:03.680]  these are dangerous cult members. Remember that and they work for the bankers. Alex has told you
[3:20:03.680 --> 3:20:08.800]  that the mid-east uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading
[3:20:08.800 --> 3:20:13.680]  worldwide. We're seeing the impact right here in the United States. Ethanol that was supposed to
[3:20:13.680 --> 3:20:19.680]  reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30 month high in February and pump prices are expected
[3:20:19.680 --> 3:20:25.200]  to reach $5 a gallon. Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions
[3:20:25.200 --> 3:20:31.200]  of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days. Move quickly while you could still
[3:20:31.200 --> 3:20:35.760]  afford it. And eFoods Direct will pay your shipping costs for you. For the best tasting,

[3:21:01.520 --> 3:21:06.240]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S. dollar has
[3:21:06.240 --> 3:21:11.120]  been evaluating. What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[3:21:11.120 --> 3:21:15.040]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value? The answer to all of this is
[3:21:15.040 --> 3:21:20.800]  gold and silver. They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years. If you had $100,000
[3:21:20.800 --> 3:21:27.040]  in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have
[3:21:27.040 --> 3:21:32.080]  the buying power of only $4,800, but your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.

[3:22:04.080 --> 3:22:08.400]  warning you about a single event we believe will happen in the next 12 months that will shake

[3:22:18.480 --> 3:22:22.640]  this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything

[3:22:30.480 --> 3:22:34.400]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[3:22:34.400 --> 3:22:39.040]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[3:22:39.040 --> 3:22:43.680]  mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a tired prophecy. If

[3:24:20.240 --> 3:24:28.480]  Global spare capacity thins attack on Iraq pipeline, halts oil exports. Almost all oil
[3:24:28.480 --> 3:24:34.720]  has halted coming out of Libya. KDF forces hit oil facilities in central Libya,
[3:24:34.720 --> 3:24:45.120]  violence flares in Egypt, 13 killed. KDF holds in his fight. Again, there's too much energy,
[3:24:45.120 --> 3:24:50.560]  too much resources, too many factories, too much wealth. The globalist system is all about
[3:24:50.560 --> 3:24:56.560]  artificial scarcity. Diamonds are in the semi-precious range, but people will pay a year's salary
[3:24:56.560 --> 3:25:02.800]  for the engagement for a piece of clear carbon, you know, like a bird that want, you know,
[3:25:02.800 --> 3:25:08.800]  that collect shiny things. It's at a real wealth because the woman is told and the culture's told,
[3:25:08.800 --> 3:25:15.280]  you must have this. And it's the same thing. You must be trendy. You must go along with this. You
[3:25:15.280 --> 3:25:22.000]  must pay for carbon. Oh my gosh, the carbon dioxide's killing the trees. It's killing them.
[3:25:22.720 --> 3:25:27.520]  Ban dihydrogen monoxide. Almost everybody at these environmental events, they've done it over
[3:25:27.520 --> 3:25:31.600]  and over again. Test. We'll sign it. Ban it. Dihydrogen monoxide sounds scary. It's water.
[3:25:31.600 --> 3:25:40.400]  Ban sodium chloride. It's salt. And they just run around. Meanwhile, big, vicious, globalist
[3:25:40.400 --> 3:25:45.360]  operators who love tyranny, who love working with dictators worldwide, who are helping the
[3:25:45.360 --> 3:25:51.520]  Chinese put in their control grid, GE and others, Soros, who help the Nazis round people up and
[3:25:51.520 --> 3:25:56.800]  even has Jewish groups he runs, attack Glenn Beck and say it's wrong to mention he helped the Nazis.
[3:25:56.800 --> 3:26:00.320]  They don't even deny it's wrong. They just, I mean, they don't even deny that he did it.
[3:26:00.320 --> 3:26:06.000]  They just say it's wrong to even talk about it. I mean, it's just, and he's called a philanthropist.
[3:26:06.720 --> 3:26:11.200]  And it's simple. They shut down all their competition and give you one hour of power a day.
[3:26:11.200 --> 3:26:18.000]  And Soros is in the news today on prisonplanet.com saying freedom isn't good. He wants Chinese
[3:26:18.000 --> 3:26:24.320]  tyranny. These are, people are like NPR and all they were like, oh yes, because you're not liberals.
[3:26:24.320 --> 3:26:31.280]  You're horrible, chicken-necked, fake intellectual, wicked 21st century Nazis who were so evil,
[3:26:31.280 --> 3:26:35.440]  you don't even know what you are. Aaron Dykes, we've got three minutes left.
[3:26:35.440 --> 3:26:39.040]  Break down the rest of their sickening seizure of our energy infrastructure.
[3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:44.320]  Let me take you back just a little more over a year ago to February 2010 before they decided to
[3:26:44.320 --> 3:26:48.800]  implement the cap and trade under the EPA when they're still trying to pass the Senate bill.
[3:26:48.800 --> 3:26:53.440]  And they remarked that a climate bill, and this is in Reuters, was getting a last big push from
[3:26:53.440 --> 3:26:59.200]  an unlikely ally, a group of energy companies, including General Electric, Duke and Shell Oil.
[3:26:59.840 --> 3:27:04.560]  Why? Because they were lobbying with the environmentalist under the U.S. Climate Action
[3:27:04.560 --> 3:27:10.800]  Partnership. Their idea was to implement cap and trade first on power utilities,
[3:27:10.800 --> 3:27:14.960]  and then later on oil refinemies and other industries. And we have this cap-
[3:27:14.960 --> 3:27:19.040]  Because they all get the waivers, but the little guys don't, which is in the documents
[3:27:19.040 --> 3:27:24.720]  AP got when they sued in 2000 from 1996, where the big oil companies got together and said,
[3:27:24.720 --> 3:27:28.800]  shut down all the little oil companies and refineries, that way the glut of oil can't come
[3:27:28.800 --> 3:27:33.120]  to market. Sorry, go ahead. No, no, no, it's exactly in point because with cap and trade,
[3:27:33.120 --> 3:27:36.160]  you have- You just don't care about the bunny rabbits.
[3:27:36.720 --> 3:27:41.200]  Well, in Ron and Goldman Sachs helped write this bill because they knew if you outlaw carbon,
[3:27:41.200 --> 3:27:46.240]  the price on it goes up, up, up for those credits indefinitely. It's guaranteed profit.
[3:27:46.240 --> 3:27:50.080]  But the yuppies like being conned, Aaron. I mean, what would happen if you outlawed drugs,
[3:27:50.080 --> 3:27:55.280]  but you had a limited supply only for the most indulgent drug users to bid up on?
[3:27:55.280 --> 3:27:59.920]  That's what they've done. That's what the war in Mexico is about, boosting cash.
[3:27:59.920 --> 3:28:04.640]  And you see a parallel directly to the way they use the derivatives market in California
[3:28:04.640 --> 3:28:08.400]  to instill rolling blackouts and drive those prices way, way up.
[3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:11.440]  By the way, you have that clip. Let's play that. Tell folks about this clip.
[3:28:11.440 --> 3:28:16.080]  It's 30 seconds. You have actual audio tape of Enron traders calling up the power plants,
[3:28:16.080 --> 3:28:17.920]  telling them to shut down. Roll it please.
[3:28:18.720 --> 3:28:22.640]  Traders soon discovered that by shutting down power plants,
[3:28:22.640 --> 3:28:27.360]  they could create artificial shortages that would push prices even higher.
[3:28:30.560 --> 3:28:35.840]  Hey, yeah, this is David up at Enron. There's not much demand for power at all here.
[3:28:35.840 --> 3:28:39.200]  If we shut it down, can you bring it back up in three or four hours?
[3:28:39.200 --> 3:28:39.760]  Oh, yeah.
[3:28:39.760 --> 3:28:42.240]  Why don't you just go ahead and shut her down then, if that's okay?
[3:28:42.240 --> 3:28:46.720]  I want you guys to get a little creative and come up with a reason to go down.
[3:28:46.720 --> 3:28:48.560]  Like a forced outage type thing.
[3:28:48.560 --> 3:28:49.360]  Right.
[3:28:49.360 --> 3:28:54.080]  Those guys at the flip of a switch could just yank the California economy on its leash
[3:28:54.080 --> 3:28:56.720]  whenever they wanted to, and they did it, and they did it, and they did it.
[3:28:56.720 --> 3:29:03.200]  Okay, so what? Now, Obama, they claimed that 50 plants malfunctioned, turned out they didn't.
[3:29:03.200 --> 3:29:06.640]  Turns out they couldn't supply it. Some of the insiders did shut down power,
[3:29:06.640 --> 3:29:10.640]  and they made a few extra bills. Same thing was being done every day in California.
[3:29:10.640 --> 3:29:14.080]  Can the public figure this out when it's stated by them?
[3:29:14.880 --> 3:29:18.240]  I guess it would be untrendy to actually not be conned.
[3:29:18.240 --> 3:29:21.520]  The whole worldwide power market, the conventional power market,
[3:29:21.520 --> 3:29:25.040]  it's only a couple hundred billion, but they figure under this carbon paradigm,
[3:29:25.040 --> 3:29:27.760]  it's a guaranteed trillion, maybe more per year.
[3:29:28.720 --> 3:29:31.520]  While they kill the conventional real economy?
[3:29:31.520 --> 3:29:36.080]  Yeah, because they want to shut us down, deindustrializes, according to Agenda 21,
[3:29:36.080 --> 3:29:37.360]  but they let the select...
[3:29:37.360 --> 3:29:40.720]  And then that allows the paper market to come in and buy up what's left.
[3:29:41.360 --> 3:29:42.080]  It's amazing, right?
[3:29:42.080 --> 3:29:44.000]  Aaron, incredible job on this report.
[3:29:44.000 --> 3:29:47.680]  Hope all you trendies check out everything we said to save yourselves,
[3:29:47.680 --> 3:30:08.000]  or if you like being raped, knock yourselves out.
