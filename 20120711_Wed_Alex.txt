[01:26.400 --> 01:46.400]  Hillary Clinton and the WikiLeaks documents said we cannot criticize China anyway they own us Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and others brag they have taken over the United States by fraud and Europe they brag in hundreds of publications a month we read the publications here on air a smattering of them
[01:46.400 --> 02:06.400]  it's out in the open we've been conquered through fraud we've been signed on to debt that isn't ours and this is a designed global depression that's been hooked up to consolidate control that's the message there are great bureaucrats out there

[08:45.400 --> 09:04.400]  listeners like you spreading the word on facebook twitter person to person spreading the word about local am and fm affiliates that folks are listening to us on across the country as well as xm channel one sixty six if you're a new listener are saying what is this guy talking about
[09:04.400 --> 09:22.400]  what does this guy stand for i am an individual who is a constitutionalist i believe in the bill of rights and constitution i think it's the best system ever produced and deployed in a governmental system i am a staunch defender of our national sovereignty
[09:22.400 --> 09:40.400]  and i diametrically oppose everything that the new world order stands for what is the new world order well it's the same thing i said seventeen years ago on air that i say it is today it is a consortium of six private mega banks that have gotten governments
[09:40.400 --> 09:59.400]  in the western world in the last two hundred years here is only the last ninety nine to accept unlimited fiat currency they control so they literally control the issuance of currency and credit and are able to take over economies in an unfair trade advantage that's putting it lightly
[09:59.400 --> 10:20.400]  they are monopolistic and authoritarian in their every move they are anti human they are robber barons who have codified their dictatorial activities into a cosmology and world view system known as eugenics under modern names it is known as transhumanism
[10:20.400 --> 10:36.400]  and they are pushing a world soviet run by private interest so the communism you've been taught about is not the true communism it is a corporate fascism on top directing a compartmentalized
[10:36.400 --> 10:51.400]  soviet communitarian model on the bottom two different systems it is government for and by inbred scientific technocrats who openly in every one of their major tomes and
[10:51.400 --> 11:10.400]  and and and and treatises are announcing a planetary world government to shut off resources incrementally until you are disarmed and poor and have no way to resist then from high tech armored fortresses and underground keeps the globalist will launch drone and
[11:10.400 --> 11:25.400]  robot delivered bio and chem attacks reducing the world population by 99% at least publicly they say 80 to 90% but in their deeper writings they obviously don't tell their servant class they're going to kill everybody or almost everybody or they wouldn't be serving
[11:25.400 --> 11:41.400]  them but again ladies and gentlemen this is a mass total takeover program this is an emergency global transmission warning you we have reverse engineered their entire program 17 years ago now it is a public we the globalist openly
[11:41.400 --> 11:59.400]  announced that they've established world government over the entire planet they are mopping up a few isolated areas right now doesn't mean the countries they're mopping up or even good most governments are horrible and wicked but the larger scientific mechanized focused
[11:59.400 --> 12:15.400]  organized evil of the new world order it has got back room deals with China and it's pretty much absorbed the communist model there but there's still some infighting going on because the globalist balance power against each other Russia is a dictatorial
[12:15.400 --> 12:31.400]  authoritarian system but compared to the Anglo-American new world order variety is not eugenics based at this time so the globalist are contending with them infiltrating their country openly trying to overthrow it publicly the globalist are
[12:31.400 --> 12:45.400]  overthrowing the family they're overthrowing any religious system because the state has to be God has to be replaced with that they are rewriting the genetic code of humanity and almost every other major species of plant and animal publicly they are engaged in
[12:45.400 --> 13:01.400]  psychopathic power mad orgies of irrevocable damage to the planet itself in their mad lust and race for godhood and before I get a bunch of preachers sending me email saying they're not going to become gods they're not going to live forever I don't believe that
[13:01.400 --> 13:17.400]  that's what they believe that's what the globalists say I bibliographic it's all it what is the end game dot com what is the end game dot com a bit online building bibliography for my film in game and that was made five years ago we've made countless films
[13:17.400 --> 13:33.400]  countless reports countless articles every day reports with their admissions Rockefeller Foundation all of it how they're killing us how the operation works how they're killing the gut flora to then come and sell us new gut flora making us totally dependent on them those that are even
[13:33.400 --> 13:49.400]  allowed to live in the next phase before mass extermination absolute total psychopath playing God made a emergency worldwide this is what we're talking about okay that's it that's the basics and I want to know you think I'm crazy you
[13:49.400 --> 14:05.400]  think I'll just go shut up everything's fine or do you understand have you looked into what I've claimed have you found out it's true and then some and then some and then some again because believe me staring into this when you find out how public it is and the fact that it's hidden in plain view
[14:05.400 --> 14:25.400]  you can't go to a baseball game anymore you can't sit there and hear the preacher talk about worshiping government all day anymore you can't sit there and live in law land anymore because let me tell you something I have found reality the globalists think you're so stupid they've written all of this down over and over again
[14:25.400 --> 14:45.400]  and have implemented it and they're following their plan to the T we've got them six seven years behind they are in 2012 or they wanted to be in about 2005 but they are following it all exactly as they said they would so I sit here with horror announcing to you
[14:45.400 --> 14:57.400]  daily what the next phase will be and we fight them on certain issues and then we're able to analyze how they're going to try to go around us when we beat them I mean when you're really living this war I mean we're in a virtual and real
[14:57.400 --> 15:13.400]  battlefield here and humanity is in the crosshairs and we're I mean I said I'd go to your phone calls in this segment just out of the gates I am in fact I'm not even going to get to the off the chart news until I've taken 15 calls in fact John Harmon you're up there taking the calls
[15:13.400 --> 15:30.400]  I'm not allowed to go to news till I've taken 15 calls because I've somehow got a break the cycle of not covering the news and not taking calls and nobody's complaining but me I listen to the broadcast and and sometimes there's moments of genius there's other moments of
[15:30.400 --> 15:48.400]  overheating in my psychological engine blowing up so it's a long race here it's an indie 500 and it's we've got to be the tortoise not to hair but let me tell you the news is movie crazy let me just give you one little tidbit the last four days it's come out that three big
[15:48.400 --> 16:04.400]  psychological companies knowingly we're killing their customers and laughing about it with vaccines with with psychotropic and with asthma drugs knowing that it would kill people and wouldn't even help it's not like oh it helps some kills other
[16:04.400 --> 16:20.400]  no knowing their products are total crud giving you measles mumps rubella in the shot killing your child when they go to get asthma medication just it's all a giant joke it's all a giant huge
[16:20.400 --> 16:37.400]  in your face joke to the globalist and now they've got legislation that looks like it's going to pass to give themselves total immunity and not just immunity for drug companies they already have it for the vaccines
[16:37.400 --> 16:50.400]  and love was like we're gonna be killing people with this giving them cancer and stuff how brain damaging them and we got to have immunity and they and they've got immunity which is a fraud it's it's kind of like the Nazi saying they had immunity we'll see how much immunity you have at the end of a
[16:50.400 --> 17:03.400]  rope it's a mind game oh I have immunity oh yes now you have immunity it will see how much immunity you've got Nixon said he had immunity for chump change crimes compared to what's going on now
[17:03.400 --> 17:18.400]  I'm going to get into that because now big big agra with biotech once once liability protection from the federal government and the bills very close to passing she they want liability protection from food they're going to make you eat
[17:18.400 --> 17:37.400]  because it's so good for you and we've got all the documents and all the news articles going back 15 years where the Monsanto crew will not eat their own food and all their big biotech campuses you know behind armed guards and swipe cards and the rest of it
[17:37.400 --> 18:03.400]  at their at their at their really bioweapon facilities they call it food production they this this eugenics company their scientists have GMO free cafeterias I'm sorry let's let's go ahead and go to Kevin in Kentucky Kevin you're on the air welcome
[18:03.400 --> 18:08.400]  thank you for taking my call Alex.
[18:08.400 --> 18:18.400]  answer your question I guess no I don't think you're crazy and exaggerating if anything you're not going far enough but hey you're doing what you can do.
[18:18.400 --> 18:35.400]  I did want to say last night I was speaking with a friend of mine who is in the health care industry she's she's a nurse and we were just having a conversation I asked her what she thought about the new health care bill being passed.
[18:35.400 --> 18:55.400]  And before she she just started I just want to let people are waking up she says what in the world I am so sick of all these people complaining about Obama and the new health care law it's driving me crazy.
[18:55.400 --> 19:05.400]  So people are waking up.
[19:05.400 --> 19:10.400]  Another friend says that those kind of things will never happen in our lifetime they're not worried about it.
[19:10.400 --> 19:25.400]  Most of the people I've talked to that aren't awake don't have children they don't have any you know bills to pay per se you know they're getting their food stamps they're living just fine so they have no reason to worry about it.
[19:25.400 --> 19:36.400]  I have two children a family at home trying to live the American dream that my parents did me and you're the same age and it's tough it's really tough and it's hard to explain.
[19:36.400 --> 19:45.400]  But all these people on disability a lot of them you know need it I'm not saying they're even bad or you've got over 51% of the public on government dole one way or the other.
[19:45.400 --> 20:00.400]  And the rest of us are getting ready to have our backs break and the globalist answer is reeducation camps and labor camps and they now admit this this is not going to be like Russia where they get away with it there's 200 million guns in this country.
[20:00.400 --> 20:08.400]  Let me ask you a question what does freedom mean to you freedom to choose the freedom to vote the freedom to worship how about the freedom to take control of your own future.

[24:17.400 --> 24:26.400]  Of course we reported this three months ago and then again another month ago there's a train of Russian ships pulling in to the port there.
[24:26.400 --> 24:33.400]  They're only Mediterranean port in the Mediterranean there in Syria. That's part of the news coming up.
[24:33.400 --> 24:42.400]  Now the New York Times has reported it. So we now know it's true. Again when the sun comes up in the morning the New York Times has to say so for us to then.
[24:42.400 --> 24:51.400]  Because they told us there was yellow cake from Niger in Saddam's garden. Remember they even said it was buried under a rose bush.
[24:51.400 --> 24:56.400]  But now they're saying ships are being sent so I have to question it. Maybe Russian ships aren't being sent.
[24:56.400 --> 25:04.400]  No the Russians confirmed a month ago they're sending in spetsnats you name it. That's coming up. That's the type of news we're going to be covering.
[25:04.400 --> 25:17.400]  And NATO is saying they want to start bombing in a humanitarian way Damascus with Russians in it. You know what that sounds like to me. Yeah it's not very good.
[25:17.400 --> 25:26.400]  You see the world is in more danger now than it's ever been. But they've got trash men all over the country busy looking at our trash cans for al-Qaeda.
[25:26.400 --> 25:35.400]  That's just the priming you. In fact they've already switched to oh and anything else that looks illegal. You smell marijuana in there. You see any marijuana seeds.
[25:35.400 --> 25:44.400]  They get you primed on. Here's al-Qaeda and then pretty soon did you see somebody spank your kid.
[25:44.400 --> 25:55.400]  That's why I'm creeped out ladies and gentlemen. The government is not the government anymore. I don't care if the average person in it isn't a bad person. It doesn't matter.
[25:55.400 --> 26:05.400]  The people driving the ship are super bad ombres and bending over to them and licking their boots isn't going to get us out of this.
[26:05.400 --> 26:14.400]  Let me just give everybody a news flash. I've got to shut up now and never get to my 15 calls. I get to the nose. John in New York. John you're on the air.
[26:14.400 --> 26:28.400]  Yeah Alex I wanted to share two points with you because I believe in everything that you're doing you've woken me up extremely and my first point it actually goes to television and film.
[26:28.400 --> 26:38.400]  There is so much new world order in television and film. At least I've been realizing in the last five years that is just no you're absolutely.
[26:38.400 --> 26:44.400]  That's why I'm hiring four or five more reporters if I can afford it is because I'll just give you inside baseball.
[26:44.400 --> 26:56.400]  I plan to put two of them on the media beat because every time I turn on a movie or TV show it's anti-family anti-gun pro-world government military checkpoints on the highways.
[26:56.400 --> 27:05.400]  I mean it's all anti-freedom messages because they know about 80% of people don't even watch the news. I mean you think the news is full of bull folks.
[27:05.400 --> 27:14.400]  You ought to try. Every movie I see is laced with it. I mean yes or you're right we're going to try to focus on that more. What kind of things are you noticing.
[27:14.400 --> 27:29.400]  Just corporations and world government that's a new show continuum that's airing in Canada is very famous and it's truly about the new world order that that is the plot it is about a officer who.
[27:29.400 --> 27:46.400]  Has finally woken up to the new world order and how corporations in the future in 2076 have bought all the people they bought all the land that they own you you don't own yourself they own you by the way.
[27:46.400 --> 28:00.400]  Do you know the psych warfare I know a lot of TV producers a lot of Hollywood people and a lot of directors and producers and I met so many of them and they described it this way they said look a lot of us know what's going on.
[28:00.400 --> 28:19.400]  But this stuff doesn't get approved by the big heads of the different corporations. It doesn't get approved by Fox or by universal or by the studio heads.
[28:19.400 --> 28:31.400]  Unless it fits in their agenda so they'll be anti new world order and you'll even get some shows out like Jericho on mainstream television or a merc group.
[28:31.400 --> 28:38.400]  In the government stages and a nuclear attack to get martial law going which is actually one of the real plans because it is the new order is a banker merc takeover of America.
[28:38.400 --> 28:49.400]  But see the reason they'll allow that on air and it was top rated and then somebody higher up said kill it is they only want a little of it to condition people like oh that's a movie.
[28:49.400 --> 29:02.400]  That's only a movie where the mercs nuke things or that's only a movie or it's 2075 when there's a global corporation and they've been taking blood for 40 years they've now ruled blood samples taken over 25 years ago.
[29:02.400 --> 29:11.400]  You just look this up court rules corporations own your DNA when they take your baby blood or you agree and sign forms for a blood test.
[29:11.400 --> 29:19.400]  You know you think it's a free blood test at college or whatever they say oh free HIV test or when everybody's scared of getting it because they're sexually active so you'll get the blood test.
[29:19.400 --> 29:26.400]  And it was free but the form said they could actually use it for research. You're like oh that's okay even if you read it.
[29:26.400 --> 29:33.400]  Now when you go in you have individual protein combos and things you go to get a genetic treatment.
[29:33.400 --> 29:37.400]  They go that's going to be a million dollars and you go what why a million dollars.
[29:37.400 --> 29:41.400]  They go we own your DNA now to give you your own DNA treatment.
[29:41.400 --> 29:42.400]  Great point.
[29:42.400 --> 29:43.400]  Stay there.
[29:43.400 --> 29:45.400]  I want to hear another comment from you John.
[29:45.400 --> 29:49.400]  We're going to go to Scott, Mark, Nick, Alan and others and the news is coming up.

[30:53.400 --> 30:56.400]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[30:56.400 --> 31:04.400]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions.
[31:04.400 --> 31:13.400]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.

[33:23.400 --> 33:26.400]  Alright, we're going back to your calls here in a moment.
[33:26.400 --> 33:34.400]  And the last caller really hit one of my pet peeves, John in New York, and we're going back to him in a few minutes here.
[33:34.400 --> 33:42.400]  One of the areas I kick myself constantly is that I'm not following propaganda and entertainment enough.
[33:42.400 --> 33:47.400]  And I don't just mean Illuminati imagery. I don't just mean things like that.
[33:47.400 --> 33:58.400]  Any time my wife downloads mainline TV shows to watch when she's lifting weights at the house or running on the treadmill or whatever,
[33:58.400 --> 34:01.400]  she'll call me over and go, look at this, look at this.
[34:01.400 --> 34:07.400]  And the bad person that's got children kidnapped in a basement refuses to vaccinate their children.
[34:07.400 --> 34:12.400]  Or the person that refuses to vaccinate wants to secretly nerve gas New York City.
[34:12.400 --> 34:21.400]  It's every show. I know you're seeing it. I don't watch entertainment shows other than things like the Olympics.
[34:21.400 --> 34:28.400]  I will probably TVO it. I have cable. I don't have cable. I have dish or whatever it is.
[34:28.400 --> 34:31.400]  I have some system in my house. I don't even watch enough to know.
[34:31.400 --> 34:34.400]  I will watch some of the Olympic stuff.
[34:34.400 --> 34:42.400]  And again, I'll feel guilty the entire time because they'll be bombarding, New World Order, global government messages.
[34:42.400 --> 34:49.400]  I'll turn the television off or fast forward every time ads come on because of all the subliminals and things.
[34:49.400 --> 34:56.400]  But overall, it is good to see human potential and I like track and field the swimming and things like that.
[34:56.400 --> 35:02.400]  It's good for my children to see that because then it gives them role models to be into sports instead of into other things.
[35:02.400 --> 35:15.400]  So I get why people run the sports. It just becomes this totally overdone, you know, sick culture where we then idolize all these big professional athletes who've got the sorted background.
[35:15.400 --> 35:20.400]  But when it comes to just flat out straight up sports, it's one of the healthiest things out there.
[35:20.400 --> 35:24.400]  Certainly not saying I'm some sports aficionado.
[35:24.400 --> 35:28.400]  I just as I get older, realize how important sports is for children.
[35:28.400 --> 35:35.400]  But I'm going to digress at that point. I know I'm stating the obvious here and do two plugs here.
[35:35.400 --> 35:37.400]  One is just informational.
[35:37.400 --> 35:43.400]  We make videos all the time that we air here on the radio slash TV or on the nightly news.
[35:43.400 --> 35:53.400]  I can shoot one at my house for five minutes holding the camera myself with it shaking and it gets 800,000 views.
[35:53.400 --> 35:57.400]  I can produce a documentary that takes a year to make. It gets 5 million views.
[35:57.400 --> 36:02.400]  I can make a documentary that takes two days to make and it gets 4 million views.
[36:02.400 --> 36:11.400]  You never know what is going to hit the zeitgeist with people and I don't tailor what we produce to try to hit a zeitgeist.
[36:11.400 --> 36:20.400]  I believe that people should want to know what's going on in reality and know about threats to their future and they're present for that matter.
[36:20.400 --> 36:28.400]  So I produce things that I think are important and it's hit or miss but I still produce what I think is important.
[36:28.400 --> 36:40.400]  And we spent all of two and a half almost three weeks producing a 20 minute video titled Humanities Greatest Secret Dreams of the Universe.
[36:40.400 --> 36:48.400]  And it came out Saturday afternoon and it's only had 191,000 views.
[36:48.400 --> 36:57.400]  Now I've seen algorithms out there and reports that YouTube has gotten harder and harder because there are tens of millions of people posting stuff so it's so competitive.
[36:57.400 --> 37:01.400]  People that used to get millions of views every video, they're lucky to get 100,000 now.
[37:01.400 --> 37:11.400]  So I understand with one of our channels with 220 million views or whatever we have about 500 something million total in the last few years that we're dominating news and politics on YouTube.
[37:11.400 --> 37:15.400]  That's the quote genre of the box they put us in.
[37:15.400 --> 37:25.400]  We're dominating and it's an important area YouTube is because that's where we reach mainline people, young people and others who would never come across this information, who don't listen to talk radio.
[37:25.400 --> 37:30.400]  Our biggest sustained audience is now over 115 AM and FM stations.
[37:30.400 --> 37:38.400]  It's really getting scary how many stations we're getting because we're always gaining stations but then losing them as they sell or change formats or things like that.
[37:38.400 --> 37:52.400]  So normally we would have around 60, 70, 80 stations over the years. Now it's been well over 100 for a while and we're gaining three, four stations a week now and it's going to be like 150 of this keeps going in four, five, six weeks.
[37:52.400 --> 38:01.400]  And it really scares me because the fact that I'm becoming mainstream really shows I'm right.
[38:01.400 --> 38:10.400]  I mean I wish I was wrong every day I try to think of ways to be wrong. I try to think of ways that I'm over estimating the globalist.
[38:10.400 --> 38:19.400]  I try to think of ways that I'm wrong and it's not that bad and believe me folks I know a lot of you are in denial. I want to be in denial.
[38:19.400 --> 38:29.400]  I want to be in denial and the fact that we're breaking through on every front is very positive showing people are waking up.
[38:29.400 --> 38:38.400]  But then I hear the kind of stuff I say sometimes in the rebroadcasts I'll have it on at night or something and I'll go that just sounds crazy but I go but I have all those articles on it.
[38:38.400 --> 38:48.400]  I mean they, I just can't believe this is really happening but again the tyrants by increments have gotten us to this point.
[38:48.400 --> 38:55.400]  The tyrants by increments have just ratcheted up, ratcheted up, got a little more, a little more, a little more, a little more.
[38:55.400 --> 39:02.400]  And because we had a system of freedom it produced so much wealth that we've become decadent slobs.
[39:02.400 --> 39:16.400]  This is what every historian and philosopher and Christian religious leader has pointed out that where you have the blessings of God and where you have liberty you create unbelievable milk and honey.
[39:16.400 --> 39:27.400]  You produce wealth and then your kids become a little less hardworking, they become a little less hardworking and then they become decadent and they become evil and they become corrupt.
[39:27.400 --> 39:34.400]  So we're sitting here in the western world but also all over the planet with good hardworking pure people who are trying to be a pure of heart.
[39:34.400 --> 39:44.400]  Certainly sinful, certainly have problems but trying to be good and then there are those out there that could care less and would sell their mother out for to stick a bubblegum.
[39:44.400 --> 39:50.400]  And we're reaching that tipping point now where the corrupt have gotten away with so much.
[39:50.400 --> 39:55.400]  These corporate CEOs.
[39:55.400 --> 40:04.400]  Three big news stories the last four or five days were big pharma knowingly in their own documents knows their products.
[40:04.400 --> 40:05.400]  They don't help people.
[40:05.400 --> 40:07.400]  It's not like it's a cost benefit.
[40:07.400 --> 40:09.400]  Well, it helps 10 but hurts one.
[40:09.400 --> 40:14.400]  And then hide that from people. No, no, no, it's it doesn't work. It kills people.
[40:14.400 --> 40:15.400]  We know it's killing them.
[40:15.400 --> 40:17.400]  Ha ha ha.
[40:17.400 --> 40:22.400]  It's like that former Goldman Sachs managing, you know, international director.
[40:22.400 --> 40:26.400]  We had on with the film that we're selling a greater good.
[40:26.400 --> 40:30.400]  And I said, man, your film is your kind of main line about the dangers of vaccines.
[40:30.400 --> 40:31.400]  Did you know it's really on purpose?
[40:31.400 --> 40:36.400]  And she goes, yes, that's how I woke up the head of a $7 billion a year company was in my office.
[40:36.400 --> 40:42.400]  And he said, we've got this new drug that's going to kill a bunch of people and make us a bunch of money and started laughing.
[40:42.400 --> 40:46.400]  She said, so yes, sir, I know.
[40:46.400 --> 40:48.400]  I just saw the film and thought it was very informed and good.
[40:48.400 --> 40:51.400]  I hadn't even looked into the fact that she was a former top person in gold.
[40:51.400 --> 40:53.400]  I mean, you know, highest level of Goldman Sachs.
[40:53.400 --> 40:55.400]  And she goes, yeah, yeah, I know they want to kill us.
[40:55.400 --> 40:57.400]  But I, you know, the public isn't ready for that.
[40:57.400 --> 40:58.400]  So I just made this film.
[40:58.400 --> 41:02.400]  And again, you can talk to anybody in the upper echelons of power and go, you've been in the meetings.
[41:02.400 --> 41:03.400]  We're talking about killing everybody, right?
[41:03.400 --> 41:07.400]  They go, yeah, sure, I have. That's what they're into.
[41:07.400 --> 41:09.400]  You can talk to the top of their class of the university.
[41:09.400 --> 41:11.400]  They've been called in and given the speech.
[41:11.400 --> 41:14.400]  You can talk to the top guy at the FBI.
[41:14.400 --> 41:17.400]  If he was honest, he'd tell you he, I mean, this is the club.
[41:17.400 --> 41:22.400]  Okay. And either you're, and they'll test you once you start getting up to those highest levels.
[41:22.400 --> 41:25.400]  They'll test you and see if you're into it.
[41:25.400 --> 41:32.400]  I've had Russian bio, you know, genetic engineering experts on.
[41:32.400 --> 41:35.400]  I've had British ones who were making millions a year at these companies.
[41:35.400 --> 41:38.400]  And they go, hey, this is sterilizing all the rats or all the guinea pigs.
[41:38.400 --> 41:42.400]  This potato is this corn is, and they go, just don't worry about it.
[41:42.400 --> 41:44.400]  They're like, but this is going to sterilize humans.
[41:44.400 --> 41:47.400]  And they go, that's the point.
[41:47.400 --> 41:48.400]  It's not just the trait.
[41:48.400 --> 41:49.400]  We're advertising.
[41:49.400 --> 41:51.400]  Now don't worry about it.
[41:51.400 --> 41:55.400]  And they're like, but this is really bad.
[41:55.400 --> 41:57.400]  It's also causing cancer and stuff.
[41:57.400 --> 42:00.400]  There's too many people shut up.
[42:00.400 --> 42:03.400]  You like your job, don't you?
[42:03.400 --> 42:08.400]  As director of this project, but it's going to kill people.
[42:08.400 --> 42:13.400]  Oh, do you like your family?
[42:13.400 --> 42:15.400]  How's your daughter doing?
[42:15.400 --> 42:16.400]  How's your son doing?
[42:16.400 --> 42:23.400]  I mean, usually I've interviewed the police on air who have named the names of where at Oklahoma City,
[42:23.400 --> 42:28.400]  the FBI would come to their office, into the sergeant's office, into the head of the canine unit's office
[42:28.400 --> 42:31.400]  and others and say, do you like your wife and kids?
[42:31.400 --> 42:36.400]  Because they're going to be dead if you don't stop investigating this.
[42:36.400 --> 42:40.400]  Okay, that's who's running things in America.
[42:40.400 --> 42:43.400]  So let's stop being naive about it.
[42:43.400 --> 42:46.400]  Okay, it's going to get us all killed.
[42:46.400 --> 42:47.400]  Let me tell you something.
[42:47.400 --> 42:48.400]  The globalists are out of control.
[42:48.400 --> 42:49.400]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[42:49.400 --> 42:50.400]  We're going to go to them right now.
[42:50.400 --> 42:52.400]  The guy got me on a jag there.
[42:52.400 --> 42:57.400]  The point is that video, I'm going to have it reposted by Adon,
[42:57.400 --> 42:59.400]  one of our great writers and webmasters.
[42:59.400 --> 43:01.400]  I'm going to have it reposted as a red link again,
[43:01.400 --> 43:05.400]  but I'm going to give it the headline what I really think it is.
[43:05.400 --> 43:07.400]  Humanities Prime Directive.
[43:07.400 --> 43:09.400]  You call Adon here real quick.
[43:09.400 --> 43:10.400]  Thank you.
[43:10.400 --> 43:12.400]  And then we're going to Twitter it out at real Alex Jones.
[43:12.400 --> 43:20.400]  And I want you to get this 20-minute video out to people because it really sets the stage mentally for people to think about.
[43:20.400 --> 43:21.400]  Come on in, bro.
[43:21.400 --> 43:23.400]  Yeah, come on in, Adon.
[43:23.400 --> 43:29.400]  Hey, will you take this video and repost it as a red link and just give it the headline?
[43:29.400 --> 43:32.400]  Humanities Prime Directive.
[43:32.400 --> 43:33.400]  Perfect.
[43:33.400 --> 43:34.400]  Top red link, infowars.com.
[43:34.400 --> 43:35.400]  Thank you, my friend.
[43:35.400 --> 43:37.400]  That'll be up there in about 10 minutes, folks.
[43:37.400 --> 43:40.400]  It'll be up there in about a minute and a half, but you've got to hit refresh.
[43:40.400 --> 43:45.400]  I think we need to put an auto refresh on infowars every 10 minutes or something.
[43:45.400 --> 43:47.400]  There's so many times people don't hit refresh.
[43:47.400 --> 43:48.400]  They don't get to new articles.
[43:48.400 --> 43:49.400]  It's important to do that.
[43:49.400 --> 43:50.400]  Okay, I'm digressing.
[43:50.400 --> 43:51.400]  It's what I do.
[43:51.400 --> 43:52.400]  I'm going to get to your calls.
[43:52.400 --> 43:55.400]  I said I'd take 15 calls or even got to the news.
[43:55.400 --> 43:57.400]  I'm only on to the second caller right now.
[43:57.400 --> 43:59.400]  I'm going to go back to him in a moment.
[43:59.400 --> 44:02.400]  First off, paying some bills and how do we pay our bills here?
[44:02.400 --> 44:10.400]  We pay our bills, shelling things at very low prices that I use and I believe in.
[44:10.400 --> 44:13.400]  We own all of the last run.
[44:13.400 --> 44:17.400]  This doesn't even sell at Amazon until the 24th of July.
[44:17.400 --> 44:20.400]  We have it with a free citizen rulebook and bumper stickers.
[44:20.400 --> 44:24.400]  Dreams from my real father, Joel Gilbert, about the real Barack Obama.
[44:24.400 --> 44:27.400]  This is a film you've got to see and won't put down, believe me.
[44:27.400 --> 44:30.400]  Everybody I've seen it says, wow, you weren't hyping this.

[45:51.400 --> 45:53.400]  I'll tell you right now.
[45:53.400 --> 45:56.400]  But we sure are eager to fight tyranny and we're the best there is.
[45:56.400 --> 45:58.400]  We're the biggest thing there is fighting these people.
[45:58.400 --> 46:00.400]  And we're just now starting to get traction.
[46:00.400 --> 46:05.400]  So again, please buy the books, videos, t-shirts, everything at infowarshop.com or infowars.com.
[46:05.400 --> 46:06.400]  We'll get you there.
[46:06.400 --> 46:07.400]  I'm going to shut up now.
[46:07.400 --> 46:09.400]  I've got to just shut up and go to the calls.
[46:09.400 --> 46:15.400]  John in New York, any other examples of brainwashing and entertainment TV versus what's in the
[46:15.400 --> 46:16.400]  news?
[46:16.400 --> 46:21.400]  Well, right now you can definitely see coming up that total recall.
[46:21.400 --> 46:23.400]  You definitely need to do a video on that.
[46:23.400 --> 46:29.400]  That's total new world order, mind control and Red Gauna film that was at MGM that's
[46:29.400 --> 46:30.400]  getting released this October.
[46:30.400 --> 46:32.400]  Finally, the remake in theaters.
[46:32.400 --> 46:35.400]  They've been trying to shove it in.
[46:35.400 --> 46:36.400]  I do mean to make up.
[46:36.400 --> 46:41.400]  Well, it was going to be about the Chinese invading, leading a Latin American force, which is actually
[46:41.400 --> 46:43.400]  an accurate scenario.
[46:43.400 --> 46:45.400]  That's a public scenario.
[46:45.400 --> 46:49.400]  But no, now it's North Korea that can't even build a car or tie their shoelaces.
[46:49.400 --> 46:54.400]  They're so big, you're playing the part of TSA agents gone to heaven.
[46:54.400 --> 46:55.400]  I mean, that's what they are.
[46:55.400 --> 46:57.400]  It's the kingdom of TSA behavior.
[46:57.400 --> 47:01.400]  And for those that don't know, Red Gauna was supposed to come out a year ago.
[47:01.400 --> 47:05.400]  Two years ago, Charlie Sheen was telling me about it, the remake.
[47:05.400 --> 47:08.400]  And instead, he's not in it, but he was in the first one.
[47:08.400 --> 47:09.400]  So he knew about it.
[47:09.400 --> 47:10.400]  I went and looked it up.
[47:10.400 --> 47:16.400]  The Chinese government threatened the US government and they went and pressured the film company
[47:16.400 --> 47:18.400]  and they went and re-edited the whole thing.
[47:18.400 --> 47:20.400]  Do you believe that?
[47:20.400 --> 47:21.400]  Unbelievable.
[47:21.400 --> 47:27.400]  And it's just that one thing I wanted to say, though, is that with everything that you're
[47:27.400 --> 47:32.400]  doing, that people have to know that it's not so much about seeing this information
[47:32.400 --> 47:37.400]  because I think what the New World Order wants is they'll throw all this information at you
[47:37.400 --> 47:43.400]  and then try to paint it as fiction so that you can be fooled and not fully understand
[47:43.400 --> 47:45.400]  that this is actually real.
[47:45.400 --> 47:47.400]  This is actually happening.
[47:47.400 --> 47:48.400]  No, no, no, exactly.
[47:48.400 --> 47:49.400]  Exactly.
[47:49.400 --> 47:50.400]  Great points.
[47:50.400 --> 47:51.400]  God bless you.
[47:51.400 --> 47:55.400]  Yeah, there's a salon article out today demonizing myself and Joseph Farah, a world
[47:55.400 --> 47:58.400]  net daily who was on last week.
[47:58.400 --> 48:03.400]  And it says we're basically delusional because we think the government's targeting people
[48:03.400 --> 48:04.400]  that like George Washington.
[48:04.400 --> 48:09.400]  That's in hundreds of police and military training manuals and we have it on video.
[48:09.400 --> 48:11.400]  That's been all over the news.
[48:11.400 --> 48:16.400]  And they're there thinking their readers are dumb, which I guess they are.
[48:16.400 --> 48:20.400]  And then the commenters, they have the Joseph Farah clip about, you know, Obama wins.
[48:20.400 --> 48:22.400]  They're going to hunt us down.
[48:22.400 --> 48:26.400]  And they say, and the commenters are almost all saying, yes, kill them, kill conservatives.
[48:26.400 --> 48:30.400]  That's how they see anybody that isn't for aborting babies as a conservative.
[48:30.400 --> 48:34.400]  And it's just like, yes, kill us, kill us, murder us, but we're paranoid that we think
[48:34.400 --> 48:35.400]  they're coming after us.
[48:35.400 --> 48:37.400]  It's called right wing publisher.
[48:37.400 --> 48:39.400]  We run some misinformation.
[48:39.400 --> 48:40.400]  Oh, they got to know that's not the article.
[48:40.400 --> 48:41.400]  I don't know.
[48:41.400 --> 48:42.400]  They've changed the headline.
[48:42.400 --> 48:44.400]  That's from April 11th a year ago.
[48:44.400 --> 48:48.400]  You type in Alex Jones and click news.
[48:48.400 --> 48:52.400]  Web will give you an old search and we're not, the crew is not in trouble.
[48:52.400 --> 48:54.400]  I'm just training new folks here on the job.
[48:54.400 --> 48:57.400]  Just type in Alex Jones as I do every morning are getting Google alerts.
[48:57.400 --> 49:02.400]  And I saw this, Joseph Farah, Alex Jones, and it's a new article out.
[49:02.400 --> 49:03.400]  I forget the exact headline.
[49:03.400 --> 49:04.400]  Let's go to their call here.
[49:04.400 --> 49:08.400]  Scott and Tennessee are on the air.
[49:08.400 --> 49:09.400]  Hello.
[49:09.400 --> 49:10.400]  Yes, sir.
[49:10.400 --> 49:11.400]  Go ahead.
[49:11.400 --> 49:12.400]  Hey, Alex.
[49:12.400 --> 49:13.400]  Great talk to you, man.
[49:13.400 --> 49:14.400]  They listen.
[49:14.400 --> 49:16.400]  You're doing a great job and you're really just scratching the surface.
[49:16.400 --> 49:19.400]  I mean, it goes so much deeper than anybody can even conceive of.
[49:19.400 --> 49:23.400]  And it's a millennia old plan just to destroy people.
[49:23.400 --> 49:28.400]  I spent almost 25 years working in nonprofits as a pastor and I couldn't take it anymore.
[49:28.400 --> 49:34.400]  I got out because the real work to be done is outside person to person, family to family.
[49:34.400 --> 49:37.400]  And that's what encourage everybody out there, especially dads.
[49:37.400 --> 49:41.400]  You know, I mean, if you're a father and you have children, raise them with the awareness
[49:41.400 --> 49:44.400]  that what's coming in the future is going to cost them.
[49:44.400 --> 49:48.400]  This will be a price to pay to maintain their freedom and their sanity.
[49:48.400 --> 49:53.400]  And I mean, it's going to take some serious digging in and fighting for what we have.
[49:53.400 --> 49:54.400]  And it's going to get worse.
[49:54.400 --> 49:59.400]  You're going to have already increasing mass suicides, more crazy zombie behavior.
[49:59.400 --> 50:05.400]  This is a society that's having its life force sucked out of it.
[50:05.400 --> 50:08.400]  That's having its survival instinct turned off.
[50:08.400 --> 50:10.400]  We are going into total self-destruction.
[50:10.400 --> 50:11.400]  Seven children.
[50:11.400 --> 50:14.400]  And everybody thought we were crazy back in the day for having a big family.
[50:14.400 --> 50:18.400]  They're like, oh no, man, you know, be selfish, live in a big house, have nice cars.
[50:18.400 --> 50:20.400]  And I'm like, no, I can see what's coming on the horizon.
[50:20.400 --> 50:22.400]  And I want a big family around me.
[50:22.400 --> 50:23.400]  I've got five sons.
[50:23.400 --> 50:24.400]  We've worked hard.
[50:24.400 --> 50:25.400]  We've trained them.
[50:25.400 --> 50:28.400]  We've homeschooled them and told them at one point, you're probably going to have to give
[50:28.400 --> 50:32.400]  your life on American soil or on a mission field somewhere for what you believe in.
[50:32.400 --> 50:33.400]  Tell you what, stay there.
[50:33.400 --> 50:36.400]  I want to hear about how you raised your five sons.
[50:36.400 --> 50:37.400]  And I'll be honest.
[50:37.400 --> 50:38.400]  I've been fighting the globalists so hard.
[50:38.400 --> 50:40.400]  I haven't even done the best job on my shoulder.
[50:40.400 --> 50:41.400]  My wife's done a great job.
[50:41.400 --> 50:42.400]  But you're right.
[50:42.400 --> 50:43.400]  Raise them upright like an arrow.
[50:43.400 --> 50:48.400]  Once you release them, you know, it's all about that aiming those first few years.
[50:48.400 --> 50:49.400]  Absolutely.
[50:49.400 --> 50:52.400]  And you children are designed to listen to their parents.
[50:52.400 --> 50:56.400]  The state tells you don't educate your kids so the state can indoctrinate them.
[50:56.400 --> 50:57.400]  Stay there.
[50:57.400 --> 51:26.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[51:27.400 --> 51:53.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[51:53.400 --> 52:19.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[52:19.400 --> 52:47.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[52:47.400 --> 53:14.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[53:14.400 --> 53:41.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[53:41.400 --> 54:08.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[54:08.400 --> 54:36.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[54:36.400 --> 55:05.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[55:05.400 --> 55:32.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[55:32.400 --> 55:59.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[55:59.400 --> 56:27.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[56:27.400 --> 56:56.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[56:56.400 --> 57:25.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[57:25.400 --> 57:52.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[57:52.400 --> 58:21.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[58:21.400 --> 58:50.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[58:50.400 --> 59:17.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[59:17.400 --> 59:45.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[59:45.400 --> 1:00:12.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:41.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:00:41.400 --> 1:01:08.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:37.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:01:38.400 --> 1:02:07.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:02:07.400 --> 1:02:36.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:02:37.400 --> 1:03:04.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:31.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:58.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:27.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:04:28.400 --> 1:04:57.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:25.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:54.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:05:55.400 --> 1:06:22.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:06:22.400 --> 1:06:48.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:06:48.400 --> 1:07:14.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:41.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:07:41.400 --> 1:08:08.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:35.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:08:35.400 --> 1:09:02.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:30.400]  I'm going to come back to you.

[1:11:46.400 --> 1:12:13.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:40.400]  I'm going to come back to you.

[1:13:06.400 --> 1:13:33.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:13:33.400 --> 1:14:02.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:29.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:14:29.400 --> 1:14:56.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:14:56.400 --> 1:15:23.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:50.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:15:50.400 --> 1:16:19.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:46.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:16:46.400 --> 1:17:13.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:40.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:17:40.400 --> 1:18:09.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:36.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:18:36.400 --> 1:19:03.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:19:03.400 --> 1:19:30.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:56.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:19:56.400 --> 1:20:23.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:20:23.400 --> 1:20:50.400]  I'm going to come back to you.

[1:21:44.400 --> 1:22:11.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:22:11.400 --> 1:22:38.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:22:38.400 --> 1:23:07.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:23:07.400 --> 1:23:34.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:23:34.400 --> 1:24:01.400]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:24:01.400 --> 1:24:22.400]  I'm going to continue with your calls ahead of more news, but just to lay out some more basic knowledge to new listeners.
[1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:33.400]  And all of this is self-evident. You already knew it. I'm just pointing it out.
[1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:44.400]  They know as the Romans knew 2000 years ago to get a large part of the population on the dole.
[1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:56.400]  The Romans handed out coinage and free bread to the poor who weren't slaves to get them to become dependent.
[1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:01.400]  Just like feeding animals at the park or something makes them dependent on humans.
[1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:06.400]  They want to make you dependent on the state. It's an elementary statement. I know you already know that.
[1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:14.400]  But think about it. 51% of this country is surviving on a government check.
[1:25:14.400 --> 1:25:19.400]  Because the government, in a lot of cases, took their money for decades and now gives them a pittance back.
[1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:26.400]  But the point is, nevertheless, they're now dependent on it.
[1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:28.400]  That's why they're going ahead with all this.
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:38.400]  Because they've gotten us so addicted to them and they've gotten us so conditioned to live on the plantation, the reservation, that the pension funds
[1:25:38.400 --> 1:25:43.400]  and the whole system is wired into it so they can hold society hostage and say,
[1:25:43.400 --> 1:25:49.400]  now we're going to sign your government on to $1,500 trillion. That's what the global debt is.
[1:25:49.400 --> 1:25:54.400]  $644 trillion. The Washington Post says it's our debt. Our real debt is $15 trillion.
[1:25:54.400 --> 1:26:01.400]  There's a $600 plus trillion. But they're saying, oh, these are the banks that are the custodians of everything.
[1:26:01.400 --> 1:26:07.400]  You better prop us up or everything goes under. But it's impossible. Well, they know it's impossible.
[1:26:07.400 --> 1:26:11.400]  It was designed to be impossible. It's designed to destroy everything.
[1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:16.400]  It's designed to render you down to totally poor. This is the model.
[1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:21.400]  Because when you're totally poor, they can make you dependent and totally control you. It is elementary.
[1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:25.400]  So people talk about, oh, somebody needs to impeach Obama.
[1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:30.400]  That's good because it would send a message that their puppets aren't invincible.
[1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:36.400]  But then you say, oh, somebody needs to get rid of him. That would be the best thing for the New World Order.
[1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:42.400]  We turn him into a martyr, all of his programs. If you're not for government health care, you're a president killer.
[1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:54.400]  We need to pray for Obama that he be hit by a spiritual bolt of lightning like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus and wake up from his evil.
[1:26:54.400 --> 1:27:03.400]  But I wish no physical harm to him. And I pray for his protection because he's a teleprompter reading Harvard con man lawyer,
[1:27:03.400 --> 1:27:06.400]  just like all the rest of these people, just like Mitt Romney.
[1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:13.400]  So again, the idea that the buck stops with them, the real power structure doesn't want you to know they have power.
[1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:20.400]  Rockefellers, Rothschilds and others. They don't want you to know, they spend all their time telling you how unpowerful they are.
[1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:23.400]  Same thing with the Queen of England, same thing with the Queen of the Netherlands.
[1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:28.400]  They don't want you to know that they've got the power. They want you to worry about their prime ministers and presidents.
[1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:32.400]  So that's another reason it's a bad idea.
[1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:39.400]  See, just having a civil war and picking the first government person and shooting them, that's really easy to do.
[1:27:39.400 --> 1:27:42.400]  And that will run underground, hide behind their government buildings.
[1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:47.400]  And then the society, because they're going to turn the power off and a bunch of other stuff, is going to get into turmoil.
[1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:53.400]  The checks aren't going to arrive. There's going to be riots up and down the road with all the giant dependent people.
[1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:58.400]  There's going to be huge shootouts with those in the suburbs and rural areas defending themselves.
[1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:05.400]  And the globalists will just sit back while the U.S. is in a civil war and then everybody's going to beg the big red one.
[1:28:05.400 --> 1:28:15.400]  Everybody's going to beg the first calf right into their cities in all the training manuals and all the higher level preparation.
[1:28:15.400 --> 1:28:21.400]  They're getting ready for a civil war in this country. We don't want that civil war to happen.
[1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:26.400]  You think the globalists care if a half million cops get killed? They can replace them like that.
[1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:30.400]  You think they care if a million citizens get killed?
[1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:37.400]  Folks, they don't. In fact, it's not just that they don't care. They want this to happen.
[1:28:37.400 --> 1:28:42.400]  This is one of the plans they're looking at. But the globalists don't have total control yet.
[1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:47.400]  That's why we're on talk radio. That's why I was reading that military-based major newspaper.
[1:28:47.400 --> 1:28:54.400]  I had a copy of it. Guys, you put a PDF on screen that's distributed hundreds of thousands of copies in Southern California.
[1:28:54.400 --> 1:28:59.400]  And the whole thing is Obama's a dictator. The U.N. is taking over America. The president's legalizing the illegals.
[1:28:59.400 --> 1:29:08.400]  This is treason. I mean, they are a few degrees away from fully waking up to, hey, it's not just Obama.
[1:29:08.400 --> 1:29:14.400]  It's the megabanks that have hijacked America. And the minute that last lesson is learned, it's game over.
[1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:19.400]  So the globalists are racing to go to drones and autonomous ground robots.
[1:29:19.400 --> 1:29:24.400]  This is MIT 15 years ago, 10 years ago. That's how I knew all this would happen.
[1:29:24.400 --> 1:29:32.400]  Folks, they're going to have combat robots on every street corner. Soon they're going to be able to make them and deliver them for a few hundred thousand dollars.
[1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:39.400]  Then they're going to get even cheaper. Every year, they're going to get cheaper until they're twenty, thirty thousand dollars for a combat robot.
[1:29:39.400 --> 1:29:47.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're like, that's Star Wars. Folks, it's 2012. They got our tax money. They're mad scientists. Look out.
[1:29:47.400 --> 1:29:49.400]  They're going to replace the military and police.
[1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:56.400]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:00.400 --> 1:30:04.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:30:04.400 --> 1:30:09.400]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:30:09.400 --> 1:30:14.400]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[1:30:14.400 --> 1:30:20.400]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:30:20.400 --> 1:30:24.400]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:30:24.400 --> 1:30:28.400]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:32.400]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:35.400]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:30:35.400 --> 1:30:40.400]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:46.400]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[1:30:46.400 --> 1:30:52.400]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:30:52.400 --> 1:31:00.400]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[1:31:02.400 --> 1:31:06.400]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:31:06.400 --> 1:31:15.400]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[1:31:15.400 --> 1:31:19.400]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[1:31:19.400 --> 1:31:26.400]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[1:31:26.400 --> 1:31:31.400]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[1:31:31.400 --> 1:31:35.400]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products,
[1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:40.400]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:31:40.400 --> 1:31:46.400]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[1:31:46.400 --> 1:31:53.400]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:31:53.400 --> 1:32:06.400]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:46.400]  Propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there. It's what my family uses.
[1:32:46.400 --> 1:32:55.400]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Propure, but if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[1:32:55.400 --> 1:33:17.400]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[1:33:17.400 --> 1:33:31.400]  It is a mathematical certainty, according to every economist we've interviewed, who's accurately charted what's happening, that we will completely collapse
[1:33:31.400 --> 1:33:45.400]  and that hundreds of times, it's over 200 roughly, all the wealth in the world could be fed into the derivatives, counterfeit, fraud instruments that make Bernie Madoff look like a saint.
[1:33:45.400 --> 1:33:49.400]  The bankers have created this. They've set up a world government.
[1:33:49.400 --> 1:33:53.400]  I mean, we knew it was the bankers doing it because decades ago, they were the ones always financing.
[1:33:53.400 --> 1:34:00.400]  NAFTA, GATT, world government, always giving themselves the power bragging in books they wrote.
[1:34:00.400 --> 1:34:10.400]  David Rockefeller, Helmut Schmidt, Ted Turner, I mean, they think you don't read books because I guess they put a book out, maybe 50,000 copies get sold.
[1:34:10.400 --> 1:34:15.400]  All that read it are other globalist and then minion-level people who literally read the books.
[1:34:15.400 --> 1:34:20.400]  They can go to a cocktail party for grants that David Rockefeller said.
[1:34:20.400 --> 1:34:24.400]  This is how this works and say, hi, I'm the chair of this university, Mr. Rockefeller.
[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:31.400]  I'm very familiar with your work in the OSS from the time you were 19 through to today and setting up all these different groups.
[1:34:31.400 --> 1:34:35.400]  I would like to be able to someday work with one of your foundations, sir.
[1:34:35.400 --> 1:34:45.400]  And literally just to impress them. The social climbers go and study all this just so they can sound smart and put on the best act.
[1:34:45.400 --> 1:34:51.400]  And David Rockefeller, well, my dear, literally, these are true stories I've been told and read about.
[1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:59.400]  We actually do need some help locally with a operation we're doing, trying to get the community to accept what we're trying to do.
[1:34:59.400 --> 1:35:07.400]  Now, let me give you a session session. They'll brief you and then if they do good on that project for free as a lobbyist consultant.
[1:35:07.400 --> 1:35:14.400]  This is how it works. This is one way it works. Then you get promoted up and it's all about can you lie?
[1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:21.400]  Can you con? Can you deceive? Will you do anything? And it's over.
[1:35:21.400 --> 1:35:25.400]  I don't want to get into a whole story about it, but I'm not even going to go there.
[1:35:25.400 --> 1:35:28.400]  I'm not even going to get into it. Maybe someday I can tell you a story about it.
[1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:35.400]  The point is, this is how the real world works. And they write all these books about what they're going to do.
[1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:44.400]  And I remember in the 30s and 40s Bertrand Russell, who they gave all these prizes to and Nobel prizes to how they set up a world government,
[1:35:44.400 --> 1:35:52.400]  how they put chemicals in the food and water to sterilize us and make a servile, how they use sports to divert us,
[1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:59.400]  how they would then have a nuclear war, maybe a giant bio weapons release to destroy what was left of the old civilization.
[1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:04.400]  And the elites would reemerge from their underground bases.
[1:36:04.400 --> 1:36:14.400]  This is the type of stuff that they openly talk about. And then I see them implementing so much of it and their whole world is about getting this in place.
[1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:21.400]  And you sit here and you're aware of all this and you just want to warn people.
[1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:26.400]  And Aaron Dyke still, every week, buys books written by these people and reads them and comes running to me saying,
[1:36:26.400 --> 1:36:31.400]  here it is, here it is. My gosh, I thought you were exaggerating about this. Here they are.
[1:36:31.400 --> 1:36:38.400]  Until now, Aaron, on the case of Eugenics, has probably read more books on it and more literature by them than I have.
[1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:44.400]  He's just been here six years. And he's always coming to me now going, oh my gosh, it's worse than you said.
[1:36:44.400 --> 1:36:50.400]  That's right. It's worse than I said. It's out in the open because they think you're dumb and aren't reading
[1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:56.400]  what they write and what they do. And if you think, you know, you get married at 19,
[1:36:56.400 --> 1:37:00.400]  your wife dies at 30 of cancer, or you think having a deformed baby is good,
[1:37:00.400 --> 1:37:05.400]  or you think, you know, having half the kids on your block, having gut disorders or neurological disorders.
[1:37:05.400 --> 1:37:11.400]  I mean, if you think them killing us is fun and cute and cool, then hey, then I can't help you.
[1:37:11.400 --> 1:37:15.400]  People are like, well, then why are you still alive? If they kill all these people, why are you still alive?
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:22.400]  Because they do all this stuff through processes so that there's giant boards and interlocking directrix
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:29.400]  where hundreds of globalists at the top, thousands beneath that layer, tens of thousands and then hundreds of thousands,
[1:37:29.400 --> 1:37:34.400]  all sign on just like they get you into welfare and get you compromised into the system,
[1:37:34.400 --> 1:37:37.400]  or you're a defense contractor or you get government contracts.
[1:37:37.400 --> 1:37:40.400]  They trick you into being part of the system, being dependent.
[1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:46.400]  At the higher levels, they have this shared plausible deniability is what they call it.
[1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:53.400]  And so they have the technocratic system rolling, and if something's good for that system, then it's agreed upon and moves forward.
[1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:59.400]  They work with each other to divide up the spoils because it's the goal that matters with these people.
[1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:05.400]  They stick together better than we do, affect a lot better because they're bound together by their love of absolute evil.
[1:38:05.400 --> 1:38:12.400]  They got somebody pulling the strings. These people are instruments, they're vessels.
[1:38:12.400 --> 1:38:16.400]  You don't even believe in God, whatever, the color out of space, some dark energy.
[1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:21.400]  They are bound, they are energized, okay? They're excited about what they're doing.
[1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:24.400]  I mean, I'm not talking about their low-level minions that are just drones.
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:31.400]  Mid-level, high-level, they are animated, they enjoy it, they like what they're doing, they get excited about it.
[1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:37.400]  Excited about kids dying horrible deaths. Excited about drones and napalm-burning children.
[1:38:37.400 --> 1:38:47.400]  Excited, and they don't care when their kids die, their wife dies. It's all just a vampiric orgy.
[1:38:47.400 --> 1:38:53.400]  And so it's old, I was talking to Steve Pachennick, Dr. Pachennick, who we ought to get back on,
[1:38:53.400 --> 1:38:58.400]  who wrote the book on psychological warfare of the State Department, CIA, ran assassinations overseas,
[1:38:58.400 --> 1:39:01.400]  co-wrote some of the books with Tom Clancy, made a lot of big movies.
[1:39:01.400 --> 1:39:04.400]  Pretty famous guy, nobody knows what he looks like, you notice.
[1:39:04.400 --> 1:39:11.400]  And he tried to get Pachennick back on, he was irritated, I didn't want to hold like 15 minutes once he hung up.
[1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:17.400]  The point is, is Pachennick, I go, yeah, he goes, yeah, you got a lot of courage off air, and I said, oh, not really.
[1:39:17.400 --> 1:39:21.400]  But I do wonder, sometimes they're going to kill me. He goes, well, that's probably too much paperwork.
[1:39:21.400 --> 1:39:30.400]  He goes, and I mean, that's what it comes down to. The system doesn't do anything unless at the very highest levels it's been authorized.
[1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:37.400]  And somebody like a Rockefeller or somebody, they're just going to count on the public's weakness when we talk about all these things,
[1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:44.400]  to not go check it, not go look it up. Or they'll just have Nightline and CNN, Samacook and Salon, Samacook.
[1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:51.400]  That's what they just kill your name, they just kill your credibility, they believe.
[1:39:51.400 --> 1:39:55.400]  Plus, I've gotten my message out, I've transmitted my information.
[1:39:55.400 --> 1:40:05.400]  So they kill me, it makes it evergreen, gold, underline, it makes it prophetic, puts exclamation points behind it.
[1:40:05.400 --> 1:40:13.400]  But that tells you about how they work, they've got to create a consensus, they've got to get all these boards and countries to sign off
[1:40:13.400 --> 1:40:21.400]  on the bombarding Libby and putting Al Qaeda in. And then everybody can just say, well, the community decided.
[1:40:21.400 --> 1:40:25.400]  Oh, well, the community of nations decided to sterilize people all over the world.
[1:40:25.400 --> 1:40:32.400]  So you can't go grab one of them by the neck, that's how these big banks work.
[1:40:32.400 --> 1:40:36.400]  And that's why they love drones, they're now giving medals to the people that kill folks.
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:49.400]  And they say, it's okay to kill 200 innocents and kill one person we claim is a terrorist, violating international law in just random countries everywhere.
[1:40:49.400 --> 1:40:55.400]  And then now they're saying they'll do it to us here, but don't worry, there's no drones, but there is drones, we're going to kill you in DAA, but they're not.
[1:40:55.400 --> 1:41:00.400]  See, they talk to you like you're an idiot. And if you act like an idiot, I guess it means you are an idiot.
[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:09.400]  It's time to really have disdain for these people and realize how dangerous they are and how mentally ill they are.
[1:41:09.400 --> 1:41:19.400]  I mean, we got a shipload of devils running things and there's never enough forum on any front. That's what I'm going to get across.
[1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:25.400]  Now, they may set me up and kill me. I mean, they've tried before. They've got agencies that do that.
[1:41:25.400 --> 1:41:32.400]  They send the FBI out to all your events over the years or you're out of town and a guy comes up to you at the bar.
[1:41:32.400 --> 1:41:38.400]  It's obviously the build of a former military person, 45-year-old FBI agent.
[1:41:38.400 --> 1:41:44.400]  You know, they're FBI immediately. You're sitting there ordering your hamburger at the hotel bar drinking a beer.
[1:41:44.400 --> 1:41:48.400]  Hey, man, I'd say this government makes me mad. We ought to kill some judges.
[1:41:48.400 --> 1:41:54.400]  Obviously kill judges because they know judges will get mad then and go ahead with a warrant and stuff for you when you go, hey, they're saying kill judges.
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:42:00.400]  You know, it's all the manipulative judges and you just look at them and you're like, oh, really? I'm not for violence.
[1:42:00.400 --> 1:42:10.400]  I mean, this has probably happened to me 50 times. You're on the hiking bike trail and stop and they're waiting where you've parked and are waiting.
[1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:17.400]  Oh, hey, I'll show them. I'm a fan. It's like, oh, this is a, even one time I was down at the governor's mansion protesting when Bush was in.
[1:42:17.400 --> 1:42:21.400]  He'd become president-elect and they were all contesting the election.
[1:42:21.400 --> 1:42:30.400]  And I could even tell what type of military they were. They had his private security, Navy SEALs, but the little type, their favorite ones are like these little five-foot-six guys.
[1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:35.400]  And I could just look at them. They're bearing their confidence, the fact they were not trying to look confident.
[1:42:35.400 --> 1:42:42.400]  And I was like, why are, it's illegal for Navy SEALs to be out here? And one of them looked at me and he goes, how in the world do you know that?
[1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:54.400]  And started laughing because I'm awake, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, it's not hard when you've had a green beret jumped out of the bushes and starts setting fires to things to blame it on you.
[1:42:54.400 --> 1:43:00.400]  You learn what they look like real quick.
[1:43:00.400 --> 1:43:12.400]  I've been doing this 17 years, really 19, but on air 17. I've been around. I've seen it. So let me just give everybody a newsflash. The New World Order is real and then some, okay?
[1:43:12.400 --> 1:43:20.400]  The whole thing's a devil run. Whether you believe the devil or not, it might as well be devil run because this is, it's something the devil would come up with and then some.
[1:43:20.400 --> 1:43:29.400]  And I'm done talking about it. I'm ranting. Let's go to Nick in Connecticut. Nick here on the air. Welcome.
[1:43:29.400 --> 1:43:34.400]  Okay, Nick, I'd want to talk. Shantel in Florida. You're on the air.
[1:43:34.400 --> 1:43:38.400]  Hi, how are you? I'm pretty good. Go ahead and speak up.
[1:43:38.400 --> 1:43:49.400]  So I'm a first time caller and a first time listener. My boyfriend introduced me to you, quite frankly. And you know what? You're right. A lot of people aren't informed. I'm 21 years old and I live in Miami.
[1:43:49.400 --> 1:43:59.400]  And a lot of people on here know what's going on. So my question to you. I've seen a couple of your documentaries already and I want to know what do you think is going to happen next?
[1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:11.400]  What do you think is going to, who's the next person to go down? Who do you think? I want to know. I mean, I love being informed and I want to get your opinion specifically because you've been around this for so long.
[1:44:11.400 --> 1:44:19.400]  And it's somewhat of a predictable behavior, but I would only ask this to somebody who knows. So what do you think is going to be the next step?
[1:44:19.400 --> 1:44:32.400]  The next step depends on good and evil, heaven and hell, right and wrong, justice and tyranny. It's what we do individually, praying, but also taking action in little ways and in big ways.
[1:44:32.400 --> 1:44:45.400]  Little things lead to big things. And if we can speak and shout and email and call and talk radio and get the word out enough that we know about false flag.
[1:44:45.400 --> 1:44:58.400]  We know about the new world order. We know about fast and furious. We may be able to back the globalist off, but even if they go ahead with a nuke going off and trying to arrest people and taking over the telecommunications or whatever the case is,
[1:44:58.400 --> 1:45:14.400]  or starting a real hot war with Russia. The fact that we at least got in a posture of being aware, warned as many as we could when this hits us and things go dark, there will be seeds of information left there.
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:32.400]  So we're going into the storm, batten down the hatches in a posture of being able to take it. And that is at least better. And taking it as a challenge and trying to live up to the mark that our ancestors set.
[1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:45.400]  That's what life is all about. And quite frankly, it's very not entertaining, but these people talk about life's boring. That's because they're watching television all day and into mainstream things that are meant to make you hollow and vapid.
[1:45:45.400 --> 1:45:57.400]  You start getting into the real world, folks. And people say they're depressed. They ought to go join a entry level boxing or kickboxing and get beat up a bunch, but get better at it.
[1:45:57.400 --> 1:46:09.400]  You're not going to be depressed anymore when you start getting endorphins flowing. You should start hiking mountains in your area. You should start, you know, whatever it is.
[1:46:09.400 --> 1:46:20.400]  You know, go out to Southern California and go pay if you got the money to go dive in a cage with great whites or something. Get outside of your comfort zone. Get out there and live.
[1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:28.400]  When somebody smarts off to you at a store or restaurant, not getting angry, but getting back in their face if you've always been a meek person.
[1:46:28.400 --> 1:46:38.400]  Living is what it's all about. Getting past fear. When you're depressed, your body is saying, I'm not happy with what you're eating, how you're sleeping, what you're doing.
[1:46:38.400 --> 1:46:48.400]  But most of the time it's not even physical. It's that you know you're not living the life with the potential you had. And it's a spiritual decision.
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:47:01.400]  You see what I'm saying? Yeah, no, I do. I totally agree. And because of that, because I started forming myself and I started doing my research, I actually ran into something that I thought of you actually when I ran into this.
[1:47:01.400 --> 1:47:13.400]  Have you heard of a movement called the deep green resistance movement? Say that again? Have you heard of a movement called the deep green resistance? Is that deep three resistance?
[1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:27.400]  This is a movement of people who believe that society should be taken down and civilizations should be shut down 100%. And it's because it should all go back into Mother Earth.
[1:47:27.400 --> 1:47:35.400]  I went into the convention and being informed about this and I was completely shocked by what I was hearing from these kids.
[1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:46.400]  They think that our systems corrupt and that the humans were the ones doing everything and we should all be taken down because of Mother Earth. What do you think about that?
[1:47:46.400 --> 1:48:06.400]  Yeah, for whatever reason, I'm half deaf in this here literally. And for whatever reason, I'm missing what? Oh, deep green resistance? Yeah. Let me type that in. Hold on a second. Well, I know about similar groups.
[1:48:06.400 --> 1:48:17.400]  Here's what happens for every reaction. There's an opposite reaction. So the system tries to create fake counter revolutions. They point out all the problems with the industrial society.
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:26.400]  It's a declaration from the Aboriginal Women's Action Network. Yeah, I know about that. It's basically Liberation Theology Communism. So yes, I am aware of this group.
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:35.400]  I just didn't know about the particular paper you were talking about that they put out. And they have a lot of well meaning people actually at the low level communist, socialist level.
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:46.400]  Because there are a lot of real things they're pointing out. But their solution is all foundation funded to say industrial society is the problem, not dirty industrial society.
[1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:55.400]  Or men are the problem, not the system destroying men and women. Or they say, we've got to go back to a post industrial world. Funny, that's what Goldman Sachs is funding.
[1:48:55.400 --> 1:49:05.400]  We're there in industrial command bases, reservations, and we are in a post industrial system. That is their entire model.
[1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:14.400]  And so they sell it from the top and below, like Cass Sunstein says at the White House, cognitive infiltration. They know stuff that's seen as establishment has no credibility.
[1:49:14.400 --> 1:49:26.400]  So they come in and make establishment stuff be packaged as anti-establishment. And yes, that's what they're doing. They're saying, oh, don't call a black person a name, which is wrong.
[1:49:26.400 --> 1:49:39.400]  And whites are inherently racist. But then they have fake white liberals walking around saying carbon taxes for Africa that will literally, literally kill hundreds of millions of people.
[1:49:39.400 --> 1:49:49.400]  And that's a conservative number. So, and same thing for Latin America. It's such a sick joke. See, why does the government get caught financing fake Nazi rallies?
[1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:57.400]  Because they want you to think that's the racist threat is a bunch of idiots, most of them feds, you know, marching around.
[1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:05.400]  Instead of the real people that want everybody dead for that matter, but they really want people that aren't white dead.
[1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:10.400]  They pose as liberals. They're in charge because they know how to camouflage.
[1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:19.400]  You know, a crocodile isn't bright purple hopping around wearing a tutu saying it wants to eat gazelle. It looks like a log floating along. It's under the water.
[1:50:19.400 --> 1:50:24.400]  And so the thing that pops out and goes, ah, I got big teeth. I'm going to get you. That's not the threat.
[1:50:24.400 --> 1:50:32.400]  The fact that they've got TSA and police and black uniforms acting like that means they're really getting to the point of wanting to put their hands on us.
[1:50:32.400 --> 1:50:39.400]  And so that tells you they're in in game mode. Thank you for the call. Great points. A great question. Brian and Canada, you're up next.
[1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:50.400]  Then Keith, Jim and others and I, I've not even gotten to the news yet. I covered some of it. It's all at infowars.com and streaming video at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:50:50.400 --> 1:50:58.400]  Here's what I'm going to do. Quick news blitz when we come back. Then a little portion of calls and then we've got our next guest joining us.
[1:50:58.400 --> 1:51:03.400]  We're taking about 10 calls.
[1:51:03.400 --> 1:51:07.400]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[1:51:07.400 --> 1:51:15.400]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[1:51:15.400 --> 1:51:22.400]  Here's why. Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[1:51:22.400 --> 1:51:27.400]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:33.400]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity from the sun.
[1:51:33.400 --> 1:51:40.400]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own, whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts.
[1:51:40.400 --> 1:51:43.400]  You'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[1:51:43.400 --> 1:51:49.400]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[1:51:49.400 --> 1:51:52.400]  Go to mysolarbackup.com for more information.
[1:51:52.400 --> 1:52:00.400]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[1:52:00.400 --> 1:52:05.400]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[1:52:05.400 --> 1:52:08.400]  I want you to know some very important information.
[1:52:08.400 --> 1:52:17.400]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[1:52:17.400 --> 1:52:22.400]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[1:52:41.400 --> 1:52:49.400]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.

[1:53:57.400 --> 1:54:16.400]  Life's getting bad.
[1:54:16.400 --> 1:54:33.400]  We've got some breaking news here in a moment. Patrick Dew has actually been a guest of ours because he's a statistician. Rob Dew's brother just saw a shitty bus going south on I-35 with a huge caravan of police motorcycles and stuff.
[1:54:33.400 --> 1:54:47.400]  Either they're escorting the Pope on the bus, which I don't think so, or there could be a drill, which they do more often than not, or it could be an Austin situation. We don't know what it is, but probably a drill or something.
[1:54:47.400 --> 1:55:00.400]  Then that's in Austin, Texas, where we're at, so we'll get his take on that briefly. All we gotta do is get the hotline and just call his number and get him on. I guess they're relaying it to the back or something.
[1:55:00.400 --> 1:55:15.400]  Briefly, if you visit infowarshop.com, you will see the high-quality water filters, other products with 10% discount, the product code water. You'll see the don't tread on me and victory or death t-shirts that are very popular.
[1:55:15.400 --> 1:55:23.400]  The come and take it t-shirts, the films, the books, and all of it gets the word out and supports this broadcast.
[1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:34.400]  We also have the best vitamins and minerals I found and put in one place, and that's at infowarsteam.com. If you want to get discounts on those, infowarsteam.com.
[1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:39.400]  Without further ado, let me get into some more of the news ahead of some of your calls.
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:54.400]  Wow, there's just so much to get into here, but I've got to say this is probably the top story. Russia sending warships on maneuvers near Syria.
[1:55:54.400 --> 1:56:05.400]  This is the third round of flotillas that have been doing maneuvers, and they've been dumping off undoubtedly weapons, and they admit spitsnats of the Navy Marine variety there.
[1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:13.400]  And so it is a pretty serious situation. Also, Kremlin Internet Bill signals growing repression of critics by Putin.
[1:56:13.400 --> 1:56:20.400]  They're doing similar things here. We're going to be getting more into that. Garbage collectors being trained to be spies there in the U.S. That's back in the news.
[1:56:20.400 --> 1:56:31.400]  I want to go to Patrick Dew, statistician and brother of Rob Dew, the head of infowarsightlynews. What did you just see minutes ago when you called your brother, Patrick?
[1:56:31.400 --> 1:56:44.400]  I was on interstate I-35 just south of slaughter trying to get onto the interstate, and I saw a wall of motorcycle cop bikes heading southbound, and they were blocking people from getting on the interstate.
[1:56:44.400 --> 1:56:55.400]  But there's a large cushion in between these eight, sixteen police officers on bikes in between them, and it looks like a city bus that had one uniformed cop driving it,
[1:56:55.400 --> 1:57:01.400]  and another gentleman standing in the front of the bus, kind of like where the doorway is facing forward.
[1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:07.400]  Okay, that's what I thought. It's a redo of one of those dirty Harry movies to grant. I bet it's a drill.
[1:57:07.400 --> 1:57:15.400]  Okay, because they just exited at Cabela's, and they were turning down the driveway. They wouldn't let people follow.
[1:57:15.400 --> 1:57:20.400]  Okay, now we know where they're at. Dew, get in the car, go over there right now. I'm talking to your brother.
[1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:29.400]  I was asking if you could, I know you're due too, but yeah, you guys go over there right now with their lordships and find out what they're up to.
[1:57:29.400 --> 1:57:38.400]  Probably a drill to create a subconscious atmosphere of fear. Again, they claim it, so they're ready when this happens, but the main danger is the state.
[1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:43.400]  If somebody sees a gun now, even a rural area, they shut down whole areas and run around hyperventilating.
[1:57:43.400 --> 1:57:50.400]  But it could be a real thing, but I doubt it. That's why they do these, is to create the illusion. It's a simulated attack.
[1:57:50.400 --> 1:57:58.400]  I mean, what do you think it is if it has a bunch of cops blocking traffic and a cop driving a bus with somebody in plain clothes standing beside them?
[1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:02.400]  Well, it's strange because they had a larger cushion in front of the bus than they did behind the bus.
[1:58:02.400 --> 1:58:12.400]  I would say it was maybe 100 feet behind the bus where they were allowing cars to be, but it was, you know, at least a quarter mile in front of the bus where they were stopping cars.
[1:58:12.400 --> 1:58:21.400]  Well, the Feds, 12 years ago, it's in my film, Road to Terraning, not Road to Terraning, Police 82000, which has shut down I-35 routinely and back traffic up 20 miles.
[1:58:21.400 --> 1:58:29.400]  And just search people. It's all fun to do that. But it's to keep you safe, of course. Thank you so much, Patrick, for that tip.
[1:58:29.400 --> 1:58:35.400]  We're going to send a team out there right now. They'll be able to call in later when we have our next guest on to give us an update on what's happening.
[1:58:35.400 --> 1:58:39.400]  More news straight ahead, a guest on Martial Law and more.
[1:58:39.400 --> 1:58:49.400]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:28.400]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[1:59:28.400 --> 1:59:38.400]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[1:59:38.400 --> 1:59:50.400]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[2:00:08.400 --> 2:00:26.400]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:26.400 --> 2:00:44.400]  We've got a guest, Dan Feier, who popped in for 20 minutes on Sunday. I want to have him for most of the hour, because he is constantly ferreting through declassified public but also hacked government documents that the government's been confirming are accurate.
[2:00:44.400 --> 2:00:57.400]  A lot of times, they just leave them on public servers like idiots. I mean, anybody can do that, but they'll have a declassified briefing, but then links to classified stuff in it, and we're able to get it. Re-education camps, Army confirms them.
[2:00:57.400 --> 2:01:08.400]  And not one mainstream media outlet would touch it. You'd think Army training to re-educate political dissidents. You'd think that'd be news, but no, no.
[2:01:08.400 --> 2:01:28.400]  You'd think the new ones for gun confiscation would be news, but something like that, the public doesn't even make that stuff go viral. The more real and hardcore something is sometimes I've noticed, like, won't go viral for a few months, and then later, a few months later, a year later, then it comes out.
[2:01:28.400 --> 2:01:38.400]  So, it's good. I mean, it's good to put it out, because it finally gets out, but it's very, very strange how that works.
[2:01:38.400 --> 2:01:49.400]  By the way, I haven't really covered this, and perhaps in the nightly news tonight we'll get into this more, but I've seen some of the videos. In fact, later we should show a clip of one of these. You guys were showing me this morning.
[2:01:49.400 --> 2:02:03.400]  They're reporting that as many as 15 million people are marching and rioting in Mexico, but Bloomberg spends it to say thousands protest a ledge fraud in Mexico presidential election.
[2:02:03.400 --> 2:02:13.400]  Tens of thousands of Mexicans march to the capital yesterday to protest a ledge fraud and vote buying in the country's July 1st presidential election. You notice there's almost none of this in our media.
[2:02:13.400 --> 2:02:33.400]  Beating drums and waving flags, protesters chanted out to Pina in reference to the new president whose victory restored the once dominant institutional revolutionary party or PRI to power at the 12 year hiatus.
[2:02:33.400 --> 2:02:40.400]  The runner up denying he was behind the marches, which he said was a citizen's movement.
[2:02:40.400 --> 2:02:45.400]  I don't know what the truth is, but there should be more news about what's happening down in Mexico.
[2:02:45.400 --> 2:02:57.400]  And they're now just trading out one corrupt party for another, but I don't know. They put in the latest party, and I tell you, absolute Hades broke out.
[2:02:57.400 --> 2:03:11.400]  The protest in Mexico seeks to overturn election results. Forbes is reporting on it. But who knows what the truth is? I mean, it's just a barrel of contradiction. It's kind of like here. There's so much fraud.
[2:03:11.400 --> 2:03:20.400]  Who knows what's really going on? Mexico's election fraud protest, deja vu, another article on that, but it's definitely not tens of thousands marching.
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:30.400]  It's like millions to me, and it's going on in every city of Mexico. So at least folks will protest down there.
[2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:38.400]  Here, people are intimidated to protest because they attack folks at the different protests. So it's a fear thing.
[2:03:38.400 --> 2:03:43.400]  It didn't work on civil rights activists, the fear, but it certainly works on people today.
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:52.400]  And of course, they'll also say, we're not issuing a permit for you to protest. We don't need a permit unless it's like the Macy's Day Parade, and you want to block certain roads.
[2:03:52.400 --> 2:04:02.400]  That's where the custom of permits has come from. I've had Austin police tell me when I've just got like 300, 400 people at a kind of an impromptu protest outside Rick Perry.
[2:04:02.400 --> 2:04:09.400]  Come up and say, we're going to arrest you if you don't leave, you're not allowed to protest, no permit. And I go, you know the city's lost a bunch of lawsuits.
[2:04:09.400 --> 2:04:16.400]  The cop goes, okay, the riot and SWAT team's getting ran out of guys and riot gear across the street. There's footage of this.
[2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:23.400]  And I said, you're going to get sued. And I said, don't, don't, don't commit a crime and violate the First Amendment. You know we're not blocking the street here.
[2:04:23.400 --> 2:04:34.400]  And he finally left me alone. But the fact that he would try to intimidate me through color of law just shows the culture of corruption.
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:40.400]  It's kind of like they say it's the law you'll be arrested if you don't vaccinate. There is no law. That's a big crime, folks.
[2:04:40.400 --> 2:04:48.400]  When they say you don't have a First Amendment, I'll arrest you. Or in knowing full well what the real law and lawsuits and rulings are.
[2:04:48.400 --> 2:04:54.400]  And he knew. And I said, listen, you might beat the rap pal, you're not going to beat the riot. I'm going to sue you.
[2:04:54.400 --> 2:05:00.400]  And I wasn't happy having to threaten him. I couldn't let him trample what's left of America.
[2:05:00.400 --> 2:05:06.400]  Let me ask you a question. What does freedom mean to you? The freedom to choose, the freedom to vote, the freedom to worship.
[2:05:06.400 --> 2:05:08.400]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?

[2:08:02.400 --> 2:08:08.400]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues.
[2:08:08.400 --> 2:08:20.400]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:25.400]  Alright for the balance of the hour we're going to be joined by Dan fight investigative journalist.
[2:08:25.400 --> 2:08:28.400]  He's worked for mainstream outlets there in Minnesota at the capital deep.
[2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:33.400]  He's also worked as a citizen journalist and broken a lot of national news stories.
[2:08:33.400 --> 2:08:38.400]  Remember a few months ago he came out with video and documents with his team showing the police
[2:08:38.400 --> 2:08:44.400]  taking people and putting them on drugs to turn them and make them informants against Occupy Wall Street.
[2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:50.400]  The state police everybody said it wasn't true. They do nothing about it turned out of course they knew they were running it.
[2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:55.400]  He's broken a lot of other news but what he's really good at and he's invited you to do this as well
[2:08:55.400 --> 2:09:00.400]  is ferret through all the hacks that have gone on with the big open intelligence websites
[2:09:00.400 --> 2:09:07.400]  but also a lot of these are leaked or Congress or the military accidentally declassifies them
[2:09:07.400 --> 2:09:13.400]  or they leave them on an army website. You know oh hey reeducation camps for people that don't agree with the corporate takeover.
[2:09:13.400 --> 2:09:16.400]  That's the army confirmed. Yeah that's our document shouldn't be public.
[2:09:16.400 --> 2:09:20.400]  I mean come on. Boom. Open and shut. Government's illegitimate.
[2:09:20.400 --> 2:09:25.400]  Pentagon reports admitting that they're now under NATO and UN control.
[2:09:25.400 --> 2:09:30.400]  And the point of they tell Congress when Congress asked about it. That was once a leak document two years ago.
[2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:35.400]  Army War College actually bragged before that they were under foreign control.
[2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:44.400]  So and I remember seeing the head of the Navy War College six, seven years ago say that oh we now work for foreign banks
[2:09:44.400 --> 2:09:49.400]  that have basically captured us. But it's good that foreign banks have captured us because they're free market.
[2:09:49.400 --> 2:09:55.400]  No they're not. They're monopoly combines. We're about to go to our guests but I want to play this from CNBC
[2:09:55.400 --> 2:10:02.400]  because I've got hundreds of articles, Financial Times of London, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Associated Press,
[2:10:02.400 --> 2:10:09.400]  Time Newsweek, Economist Magazine saying technocrats, unelected bankers are going to run things
[2:10:09.400 --> 2:10:13.400]  and that there are saviors and good. But no one seems to read those.
[2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:19.400]  So here but the video we like to play once a week at least from about a month ago. Here's a short clip from it
[2:10:19.400 --> 2:10:25.400]  where they tell us we're slaves of foreign bankers. And guess who works for them? The military.
[2:10:25.400 --> 2:10:32.400]  Now it's illegitimate. The military by and large are good men and women. But we need to understand who's over the military now.
[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:39.400]  Foreign narcotics trafficking controlled NATO. It's self run by private banking cartel.
[2:10:39.400 --> 2:10:45.400]  So that's who the commander-in-chief is now. The narcotics trafficking banking cartel. Here it is.
[2:10:45.400 --> 2:10:48.400]  So mostly what they do is hold summits?
[2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:55.400]  I think that right now the question is do we all work for central bankers? That's one I want to address to our guests tonight.
[2:10:55.400 --> 2:11:04.400]  Is this global governance at last? Is it one world? The central bankers in charge? Jim Miorio, you say we've got some downside here.
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:10.400]  We've got some reduction in the markets. Fine. But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:18.400]  Aren't we all just counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke putt and that we won't go any lower than say 5% down from here?
[2:11:18.400 --> 2:11:22.400]  Of course we are. Because if we look at the economic data there's nothing to get excited about.
[2:11:22.400 --> 2:11:27.400]  Then all the guests go on. There's four of them to say yes we're slaves but it's a good thing.
[2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:35.400]  One guy criticizes the private fellow reserve. It's all a fraud. Just like the fellow reserve is private. It has quasi-governmental power.
[2:11:35.400 --> 2:11:41.400]  It's a consortium. That's what the new world order is. Okay? They exempt themselves.
[2:11:41.400 --> 2:11:52.400]  Big pharma is out now admitting that they knew H1N1 was going to give people narcolepsy, all different types of brain problems,
[2:11:52.400 --> 2:11:59.400]  all sorts of seizures, death, and they're getting government liability protection.
[2:11:59.400 --> 2:12:06.400]  Just like GMO has got a writer in a bill I'm going to cover later briefly to give all their new crops where they can plant any crop
[2:12:06.400 --> 2:12:10.400]  they want without authorization of anybody, not even corrupt FDA anymore.
[2:12:10.400 --> 2:12:16.400]  And if you get sick from it, you can't sue them.
[2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:22.400]  That's what this is. This is diplomatic immunity for the criminal class.
[2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:27.400]  And now they've got the military gearing up for war with us and the public's calling in and sending emails.
[2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:32.400]  Well, I know I'm in the military, Alex. We are getting ready for martial law because things are going to collapse.
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:38.400]  We have to. Yeah, but it was premeditated. It's not like things are collapsing and now we have the military on the streets.
[2:12:38.400 --> 2:12:43.400]  The military is now doing jaws of life all over the country for PR, doing mosquito ratification.
[2:12:43.400 --> 2:12:49.400]  Look at this photo up at infowars.com, of them chemtrailing people over Florida.
[2:12:49.400 --> 2:12:55.400]  I mean, pretty soon the military is going to fill potholes. This is what a society looks like when it falls.
[2:12:55.400 --> 2:13:02.400]  And again, Dan Fite will give you his website. If you're watching on PrismPlanet.tv, you can go over these documents.
[2:13:02.400 --> 2:13:11.400]  If not, go to infowars.com or to his site, HongPong.com, where he's got these PDFs and government documents linked right there.
[2:13:11.400 --> 2:13:20.400]  Since we talked Sunday, Dan, you're back with us here. Break down in generality what you think's happening here,
[2:13:20.400 --> 2:13:26.400]  or if you disagree with anything I've said, before you get into some of these latest data dumps that are up on your site.
[2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:32.400]  Yeah, good to be with you, Alex. I just wanted to lead off with a little bit of positive news.
[2:13:32.400 --> 2:13:43.400]  Out in San Francisco, one of our colleagues, David, with Indy Bay or Bay Area, Indy Media, just won $160,000 lawsuit settlement from the authorities there
[2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:47.400]  because they seized his camera looking for evidence against protesters.
[2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:54.400]  And it is a federal law that you cannot seize a journalist's unpublished work product without a subpoena.
[2:13:54.400 --> 2:13:57.400]  You need something more than a warrant. You need a subpoena.
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:02.400]  And the film that we made about the 2008 Republican National Convention called Terrorizing Descent,
[2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:07.400]  at one point a SWAT team surrounded a group of journalists at a house of a guy named Mike Whalen.
[2:14:07.400 --> 2:14:12.400]  And again, they didn't come up with a subpoena to seize their journalist work product,
[2:14:12.400 --> 2:14:17.400]  but at least we have one settlement proving that even if you're an independent volunteer journalist, you have that right.
[2:14:17.400 --> 2:14:20.400]  And so I think that's a little bit of positive news.
[2:14:20.400 --> 2:14:25.400]  And actually, that house during the RNC, Mike Whalen's house, I just got to throw this in,
[2:14:25.400 --> 2:14:29.400]  he was a distributor of vegetarian, vegan literature.
[2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:34.400]  And so that's one of these cases where he won a lawsuit settlement as well.
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:37.400]  And it seems like they were using package tracking.
[2:14:37.400 --> 2:14:42.400]  They were inside the FedEx or UPS type system to sort of see he was receiving packages,
[2:14:42.400 --> 2:14:43.400]  and then they went after him.
[2:14:43.400 --> 2:14:45.400]  A small example of how these things work.
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:48.400]  But we have to make sure in the process of fighting for this stuff
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:51.400]  that we fight for our rights as independent journalists as well.
[2:14:51.400 --> 2:14:54.400]  I just wanted to throw that in quickly right away.
[2:14:54.400 --> 2:14:58.400]  But yeah, essentially, this sort of new discussion that we're having,
[2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:02.400]  a really excellent website called publicintelligence.net,
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:09.400]  posted a military police training handbook for something called civil disturbance operations,
[2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:14.400]  which is an area of sort of doctrine and tactics that seems to be expanding domestically.
[2:15:14.400 --> 2:15:20.400]  It's been used in the previous eras when the National Guard, for example, was deployed in Los Angeles.
[2:15:20.400 --> 2:15:27.400]  And so this new document shows how warrantless searches without talk of warrants
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:31.400]  are described and planned out looking for dissidents slash snipers.
[2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:36.400]  It talks about detention facilities operated domestically by these MPs.
[2:15:36.400 --> 2:15:40.400]  And those facilities are heavily guarded and armed,
[2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:43.400]  and they say there will be no warning shots fired if they think you're a threat.
[2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:48.400]  So this document sort of lays out at kind of the grunt level,
[2:15:48.400 --> 2:15:51.400]  the fact that unauthorized gatherings are forbidden.
[2:15:51.400 --> 2:15:55.400]  There's very few references to anything about constitutional rights in this,
[2:15:55.400 --> 2:15:58.400]  nothing about warrants, nothing about the Fourth Amendment, nothing about the First Amendment.
[2:15:58.400 --> 2:16:04.400]  It talks about seizing firearms, seizing liquor and private property and that kind of thing.
[2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:10.400]  So it was a troubling document, but it fit into a larger set of documents.
[2:16:10.400 --> 2:16:14.400]  And it's very handy, public intelligence has just published a bunch more
[2:16:14.400 --> 2:16:17.400]  about how this domestic military system works.
[2:16:17.400 --> 2:16:24.400]  And so what I found earlier was a file left out on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer Web Server in 2010
[2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:32.400]  about something called the National Level Exercise 2011 New Madrid Sizing Zone Earthquake Exercise
[2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:35.400]  that Homeland Security and FEMA and the military were running.
[2:16:35.400 --> 2:16:42.400]  And inside there there were notes about sort of a planning level called ConPlan 3502
[2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:46.400]  or U.S. Northern Command Concept of Operations Plan 3502.
[2:16:46.400 --> 2:16:48.400]  And that's called civil disturbance operations.
[2:16:48.400 --> 2:16:50.400]  And so that plan is classified secret.
[2:16:50.400 --> 2:16:57.400]  And I don't think it's appropriate in open and democratic society for there to be these secret classified plans.
[2:16:57.400 --> 2:17:05.400]  Also, public intelligence just posted the new 2011 version of a domestic operational law handbook.
[2:17:05.400 --> 2:17:11.400]  I had previously looked at the 2010 version and both of these have a ton of citations
[2:17:11.400 --> 2:17:17.400]  that show you exactly how in Chapter 5, which is called civil disturbance operations,
[2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:22.400]  they show you how ConPlan 3502 is in fact the major planning framework.
[2:17:22.400 --> 2:17:24.400]  And it is classified secret.
[2:17:24.400 --> 2:17:29.400]  And it is a replacement for the old plan from the 20th century called a garden plot,
[2:17:29.400 --> 2:17:35.400]  which was the basis of the Rex 84 exercise and the Reagan administration and Oliver North and so forth.
[2:17:35.400 --> 2:17:37.400]  So garden plot was the old plan.
[2:17:37.400 --> 2:17:43.400]  And then they created Northcom in 2002 as a military counterpart to Homeland Security.
[2:17:43.400 --> 2:17:47.400]  They came up with this, you know, this ConPlan 3502 plan.
[2:17:47.400 --> 2:17:53.400]  So when Northcom is activated, like say there's a big national disaster and earthquake,
[2:17:53.400 --> 2:18:01.400]  they use a broad plan called ConPlan 3501 defense support of civil authorities or DSCA.
[2:18:01.400 --> 2:18:02.400]  That's their number one plan.
[2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:06.400]  And then their number two plan is ConPlan 3502 civil disturbance operations.
[2:18:06.400 --> 2:18:11.400]  So with the new MP training document that we just got, we have a very good sense.
[2:18:11.400 --> 2:18:15.400]  That document dates from 2006, kind of the Hurricane Katrina era.
[2:18:15.400 --> 2:18:18.400]  We saw how in Hurricane Katrina when the military was deployed,
[2:18:18.400 --> 2:18:24.400]  they were taking people's firearms without warrants, searching without warrants, things of that nature.
[2:18:24.400 --> 2:18:28.400]  And so we see that when the military hits the streets of the United States,
[2:18:28.400 --> 2:18:33.400]  even if it's not a full martial law scenario or if it's a national special security event,
[2:18:33.400 --> 2:18:37.400]  which is a complex subject that we should really look at very carefully,
[2:18:37.400 --> 2:18:40.400]  it's very important to have kind of an idea of these documents.
[2:18:40.400 --> 2:18:42.400]  So you sort of know what to expect.
[2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:44.400]  You can kind of get pointed questions out there.
[2:18:44.400 --> 2:18:48.400]  And you can sort of plant the flag on concrete facts that we know about this system.
[2:18:48.400 --> 2:18:51.400]  And I think that's a much more useful way to proceed.
[2:18:51.400 --> 2:18:56.400]  It gives us a good foundation to move forward politically and start challenging this stuff.
[2:18:56.400 --> 2:19:02.400]  I don't think it's appropriate that secret plans like ConPlan 3502 exist.
[2:19:02.400 --> 2:19:10.400]  Also, the New Domestic Operational Law Handbook talks about another secret directive put down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[2:19:10.400 --> 2:19:17.400]  And that document is also classified secret and it specifies which sections of the military can use,
[2:19:17.400 --> 2:19:19.400]  which uses of force domestically.
[2:19:19.400 --> 2:19:23.400]  So that's secret, although some little annex of it isn't secret.
[2:19:23.400 --> 2:19:32.400]  Another example to check out that is available is the Northcom plan for influenza or other pandemics,
[2:19:32.400 --> 2:19:36.400]  which is called ConPlan 3591.
[2:19:36.400 --> 2:19:42.400]  And if you Google around for that, you can find a very large, partially declassified plan,
[2:19:42.400 --> 2:19:48.400]  which is hosted on Northcom.mil's Freedom of Information Act section.
[2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:56.400]  Tell you what, stay there, imagine the unclassified stuff, gun confiscation, they call it gun evacuation,
[2:19:56.400 --> 2:20:01.400]  everything else, reeducation camps, I mean this is a lot of fun.
[2:20:01.400 --> 2:20:04.400]  Let me ask you a question. What does freedom mean to you?
[2:20:04.400 --> 2:20:07.400]  The freedom to choose, the freedom to vote, the freedom to worship.
[2:20:07.400 --> 2:20:09.400]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[2:20:09.400 --> 2:20:14.400]  My friends at Eat Foods Direct are celebrating freedom this month while helping you take control of your greatest dependency food.

[2:24:15.400 --> 2:24:20.400]  I mean, here's an example. Here's what's come in in just the last ten minutes.
[2:24:20.400 --> 2:24:24.400]  LIPC Weapon combines lasers and whitening.
[2:24:24.400 --> 2:24:27.400]  The new military system they want to give to police.
[2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:30.400]  It's a plasma laser gun that blows your car up.
[2:24:30.400 --> 2:24:33.400]  I mean, it's Buck Rogers. It's not little wimpy lasers.
[2:24:33.400 --> 2:24:37.400]  It's stuff that will blow the engineer car instantly.
[2:24:37.400 --> 2:24:38.400]  Boom.
[2:24:38.400 --> 2:24:39.400]  Here's another one.
[2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:40.400]  CBS.
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:44.400]  New Homeland Security laser scanner reads people at molecular level.
[2:24:44.400 --> 2:24:47.400]  At 160 feet away, it's going to be in malls everywhere.
[2:24:47.400 --> 2:24:50.400]  Scanning everyone, shooting you.
[2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:53.400]  Believe me, you're getting hit with some radiation there.
[2:24:53.400 --> 2:24:57.400]  And bouncing back and it says if you're on drugs, adrenaline, everything about you.
[2:24:57.400 --> 2:25:03.400]  This is the Pandora's box with all these agencies and companies with the license plate.
[2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:09.400]  I saw a cop with a license plate reader in Westlake two days ago driving down the road,
[2:25:09.400 --> 2:25:14.400]  violently turn in front of me, almost hitting the car in front of me to chase somebody and pull them over
[2:25:14.400 --> 2:25:16.400]  because the license plate reader went off.
[2:25:16.400 --> 2:25:18.400]  He had license plate reading cameras on him.
[2:25:18.400 --> 2:25:22.400]  Hey, why don't you go scan international bankers?
[2:25:22.400 --> 2:25:24.400]  Why don't you go, I mean, look, there's crooks right there.
[2:25:24.400 --> 2:25:28.400]  How about you go arrest the folks with drones illegally attacking countries all over the world?
[2:25:28.400 --> 2:25:29.400]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[2:25:29.400 --> 2:25:32.400]  You're going to hin-peck us to death with all this.
[2:25:32.400 --> 2:25:35.400]  And I'm going to say it again and go back to our guest.
[2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:37.400]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[2:25:37.400 --> 2:25:42.400]  Investigative journalist day of fight.
[2:25:42.400 --> 2:25:43.400]  This is Pandora's box.
[2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:47.400]  We're going to rue the day with all of this because they're now gearing the military up
[2:25:47.400 --> 2:25:51.400]  and getting on a war fighting front and footing against us.
[2:25:51.400 --> 2:25:53.400]  And now going, well, it is needed for collapse.
[2:25:53.400 --> 2:25:57.400]  And the secretary of the army was out a month ago going, we need to be in every city.
[2:25:57.400 --> 2:26:03.400]  And, you know, and yeah, dealing law enforcement and calling airstrikes and they're just getting everybody ready.
[2:26:03.400 --> 2:26:04.400]  And for what?
[2:26:04.400 --> 2:26:12.400]  I want to get into the bio release or flu release and those documents that I know tie into the emergency centers.
[2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:16.400]  Establishment Act and the model states of the emergency powers act.
[2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:19.400]  Horse inoculation, all that's admitted in that document.
[2:26:19.400 --> 2:26:21.400]  I haven't looked at the one you're mentioning the new one.
[2:26:21.400 --> 2:26:22.400]  There's so many.
[2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:31.400]  But briefly, in the time we have Dan fight, what do you, why do you think, because you agreed Sunday, they're accelerating this times 50.
[2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:34.400]  Why do you think they're accelerating all this right now?
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:37.400]  And where do you think this is headed right now?
[2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:42.400]  Well, you know, I think, yeah, in some sense, you know, the war is coming home.
[2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:49.400]  These years of war are causing these military industrial corporations to kind of import their technology back into local governments.
[2:26:49.400 --> 2:26:52.400]  Local governments don't really have the revenue to buy these things.
[2:26:52.400 --> 2:27:11.400]  So they, you know, use freshly created Federal Reserve notes and federal grant programs such as the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the DOJ or the Department of Homeland Security, Urban Area Security Initiative that just got an enormous, you know, truck or, you know, battle wagon for UC Berkeley.
[2:27:11.400 --> 2:27:33.400]  So I think like there's there's a real erosion of public space. I think there's this notion that as the kind of corporate ideology moves forward, the space to be a citizen, the space to dissent to disagree to oppose the interests of powerful corporations that are getting themselves labeled as critical infrastructure and key resource sectors,
[2:27:33.400 --> 2:27:47.400]  which can include everything from banks to everybody else. They're kind of saying that it's CIKR that's in a lot of these plans to that essentially puts the Army on the hook to defend the people running CIKR businesses.
[2:27:47.400 --> 2:28:06.400]  And so overall, we see a displacement of the traditional, you know, liberal freedoms that we're used to thinking of. And I've also been involved with the Occupy Wall Stream movement since it started. I helped kind of work with the live stream media people as a, you know, remote producer to kind of help get things rolling.
[2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:21.400]  And so I saw at a really up close experience right in front of seeing how not only did a huge protest movement sweep across the United States, that was really, you know, opposing this, this corporatist aggressive ideology that's harming everybody's standard of living.
[2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:32.400]  But also we see that the same kind of policing that usually we only saw at things like national special security events and that kind of thing has now been spreading to cities across the country.
[2:28:32.400 --> 2:28:49.400]  And we just saw, I think yesterday in Seattle, there was a SWAT raid and the police announced that they were looking for anarchist literature. And so the kind of things which were supposed to reserve for extreme circumstances have become more and more normalized.
[2:28:49.400 --> 2:29:07.400]  And so I don't, I don't know if that, you know, leads outright to a situation of collapse or martial law necessarily. However, you can clearly see a gradient developing and you can clearly see that these kinds of things are set up and kind of tested and run along the gradient.
[2:29:07.400 --> 2:29:21.400]  And so if we get a good handle on these documents, if we understand things like conplan 3502, if we saw at the NATO summit, for example, in Chicago, the military setup was called a dual status task force.
[2:29:21.400 --> 2:29:30.400]  And so if we get a real good grip on these things, we can start kind of raising awareness and possibly being able to kind of intercept these things and break them up.
[2:29:30.400 --> 2:29:39.400]  Sure, exactly, exactly. And it's not just free federal money. They take our tax plane to local level and send it back or inflate the currency, as you said, hurting everybody.
[2:29:39.400 --> 2:30:02.400]  This is a very dangerous trend. We're going to break down the flu angle when we get back. And also, we're going to look at what happened at the G20. Stay with us.
[2:30:02.400 --> 2:30:10.400]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cow Ben soap company.

[2:31:00.400 --> 2:31:20.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:31:20.400 --> 2:31:32.400]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:31:32.400 --> 2:31:41.400]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:31:41.400 --> 2:31:52.400]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[2:32:00.400 --> 2:32:08.400]  Let me ask you a question. What does freedom mean to you? The freedom to choose, the freedom to vote, the freedom to worship. How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[2:32:08.400 --> 2:32:13.400]  My friends at Eat Foods Direct are celebrating freedom this month while helping you take control of your greatest dependency food.
[2:32:13.400 --> 2:32:21.400]  Right now, you receive one of their new Patriot Packs free with every $289 you spend on their highly nutritious and great-tasting food.

[2:33:00.400 --> 2:33:07.400]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide.
[2:33:07.400 --> 2:33:09.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:16.400 --> 2:33:24.400]  As a civilization, as a society, we've decided to just let people tread on us.
[2:33:24.400 --> 2:33:35.400]  And our countries have become more and more neo-futalistic farms where we have so-called freedom within very narrowly defined choices.
[2:33:35.400 --> 2:33:43.400]  And across the political spectrum, the ruling class in public documents has decided that freedom isn't a good idea.
[2:33:43.400 --> 2:33:50.400]  That they want to move more and more to a model of where they don't just take your basic liberties, but they try to make you poor.
[2:33:50.400 --> 2:33:56.400]  So that you can be bought much easier and controlled and made dependent.
[2:33:56.400 --> 2:34:03.400]  As the founder of the Rockefeller dynasty said, competition is a sin.
[2:34:03.400 --> 2:34:08.400]  Like that was his favorite motto. He said over and over again, he wrote it, they want monopoly.
[2:34:08.400 --> 2:34:15.400]  So it's megacorporations with government, with an apathetic public equals the perfect storm.
[2:34:15.400 --> 2:34:21.400]  Fascism is one of the better ways to describe it, but it's even beyond that.
[2:34:21.400 --> 2:34:27.400]  And the left is controlled by it because they think socialism will get them out of this.
[2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:31.400]  But the bankers want their own model of socialism, but only to keep you dependent.
[2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:33.400]  A chicken feeds socialism.
[2:34:33.400 --> 2:34:38.400]  And again, I'm getting off into political points here.
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:44.400]  No one can deny that Eisenhower warned us about this, the military industrial complex run by a technocratic elite.
[2:34:44.400 --> 2:34:45.400]  That was the part they always cut out.
[2:34:45.400 --> 2:34:46.400]  Look it up.
[2:34:46.400 --> 2:34:50.400]  The full addresses on YouTube of President Eisenhower's farewell address.
[2:34:50.400 --> 2:34:52.400]  We should play that whole thing sometime here.
[2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:55.400]  It's not like 10 minutes long or 12 minutes long.
[2:34:55.400 --> 2:34:58.400]  This is what we're dealing with here.
[2:34:58.400 --> 2:35:05.400]  And, you know, while Dan's talking, I'm sitting here having to just hold my mouth so I don't jump in with points backing up what he's saying.
[2:35:05.400 --> 2:35:15.400]  When I sent Rob do Jason Burma's, who was it Aaron Dykes went to, I know three of our crew went up to Pittsburgh for the G 20.
[2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:18.400]  They were going to have you military all over the streets.
[2:35:18.400 --> 2:35:20.400]  So when we got there, we called.
[2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:24.400]  They had regular army and National Guard police from all over the country there for this training.
[2:35:24.400 --> 2:35:25.400]  That's what it was.
[2:35:25.400 --> 2:35:26.400]  It was a laboratory.
[2:35:26.400 --> 2:35:30.400]  And they said, yeah, come by and talk to our public information officers.
[2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:35.400]  They pull up at the warehouses where they were staying and come up and there's troops at the, you know, stand at the front.
[2:35:35.400 --> 2:35:39.400]  They're like, hi, I'm Rob do the Alex Jones info wars of Austin.
[2:35:39.400 --> 2:35:41.400]  We're here to talk to a public information officer.
[2:35:41.400 --> 2:35:45.400]  The troops act all paranoid and come back and say, who are you again?
[2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:46.400]  And we said who we are.
[2:35:46.400 --> 2:35:50.400]  I mean, it's all in the police state for rise of FEMA film.
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:52.400]  We're real polite to him.
[2:35:52.400 --> 2:35:53.400]  We played it here.
[2:35:53.400 --> 2:35:57.400]  And they say, sorry, we can't talk to you.
[2:35:57.400 --> 2:36:02.400]  Now this isn't even on a military basis, just pulling up where they were at these warehouses.
[2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:06.400]  So they leave, go to their hotel, the police call and they say, we're coming to arrest you.
[2:36:06.400 --> 2:36:12.400]  We know your terrorists that wanted to blow up the, wanted to blow up the military.
[2:36:12.400 --> 2:36:15.400]  And Rob do is like, are you joking?
[2:36:15.400 --> 2:36:20.400]  And the guys know I've called the rent car place and I know who you are and we're coming to get you right now.
[2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:21.400]  And it was like a captain.
[2:36:21.400 --> 2:36:27.400]  So they do call them goes, yeah, here's this guy and I'd be working like that night.
[2:36:27.400 --> 2:36:29.400]  So I did an emergency internet, you know, stream video only show people saw it.
[2:36:29.400 --> 2:36:35.400]  And I called up this captain and I said, this Alex Jones talk radio host out to Texas.
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:37.400]  Yeah, I know you are.
[2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:40.400]  I said, is this a joke?
[2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:42.400]  My guys have all this on video.
[2:36:42.400 --> 2:36:43.400]  They politely called up now.
[2:36:43.400 --> 2:36:47.400]  Now you're saying the military says they wanted to blow them up.
[2:36:47.400 --> 2:36:50.400]  And he goes, yeah, that's what they said.
[2:36:50.400 --> 2:36:53.400]  And I, and I forget the whole story of it.
[2:36:53.400 --> 2:36:55.400]  It was like how we were terrorists all this.
[2:36:55.400 --> 2:36:59.400]  And I said, man, do you really want your kids growing up in a country like this?
[2:36:59.400 --> 2:37:01.400]  He's like, oh, now you're bringing my family into it.
[2:37:01.400 --> 2:37:02.400]  And I said, don't play games.
[2:37:02.400 --> 2:37:03.400]  You're the one that's in the wrong.
[2:37:03.400 --> 2:37:05.400]  I said, knock it off right now and don't act like a crook.
[2:37:05.400 --> 2:37:08.400]  Don't act like some authoritarian scumbag.
[2:37:08.400 --> 2:37:11.400]  All of a sudden he goes, well, we're just trying to keep everybody safe.
[2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:15.400]  I said, man, you're, you're nuts is what you are.
[2:37:15.400 --> 2:37:18.400]  What you are is nuts.
[2:37:18.400 --> 2:37:21.400]  You're dangerous and you're crazy.
[2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:25.400]  Now they left them alone, but the point is there's no real terrorist folks.
[2:37:25.400 --> 2:37:26.400]  That's all manufactured.
[2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:28.400]  Amar al-Aliqi at the Pentagon, all of it.
[2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:29.400]  That's all come out.
[2:37:29.400 --> 2:37:30.400]  They run al-Qaeda overseas.
[2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:31.400]  It's all manufactured.
[2:37:31.400 --> 2:37:35.400]  There's some small low intensity, angry Palestinians that do kill people and stuff,
[2:37:35.400 --> 2:37:37.400]  but that's asymmetrical warfare.
[2:37:37.400 --> 2:37:39.400]  It doesn't exist.
[2:37:39.400 --> 2:37:42.400]  The 72 Olympics in Munich were staged.
[2:37:42.400 --> 2:37:47.400]  They have an Academy Award winning movie where at the end they just add that as a footnote.
[2:37:47.400 --> 2:37:53.400]  But one day in September, you watch the whole movie and then at the end,
[2:37:53.400 --> 2:37:56.400]  they admit it was all staged and that they stage hijackings with the terrorists.
[2:37:56.400 --> 2:38:00.400]  I mean, you know, German and the former head of German intelligence is laughing.
[2:38:00.400 --> 2:38:02.400]  See, this is all psychological inoculation.
[2:38:02.400 --> 2:38:04.400]  It's funny to them.
[2:38:04.400 --> 2:38:07.400]  By the way, the cops shutting down the highway with the bus.
[2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:11.400]  It was diplomatic training, which my dad's been in the third world.
[2:38:11.400 --> 2:38:13.400]  Down there do charity work.
[2:38:13.400 --> 2:38:16.400]  They give them diplomatic, you know, trucks and helicopters.
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:19.400]  They talk about status in a third world collapsed country.
[2:38:19.400 --> 2:38:22.400]  So what Dan said is absolutely on target.
[2:38:22.400 --> 2:38:27.400]  They have these national security events like G20 and stuff where they do army snatch and grabs.
[2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:30.400]  And we showed guys in army uniforms grabbing protesters.
[2:38:30.400 --> 2:38:31.400]  And I said, you know what?
[2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:34.400]  I've seen that in Canada and in England and at G20.
[2:38:34.400 --> 2:38:35.400]  That's staged.
[2:38:35.400 --> 2:38:42.400]  That's a drill to acclimate the media to the image of people being grabbed and disappearing into black vans.
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:45.400]  Turned out later it was.
[2:38:45.400 --> 2:38:48.400]  G20 security contacted us and said, that is not the military.
[2:38:48.400 --> 2:38:50.400]  We've gotten some heat over it.
[2:38:50.400 --> 2:38:51.400]  That's us.
[2:38:51.400 --> 2:38:52.400]  And that was a drill.
[2:38:52.400 --> 2:39:02.400]  So they show you being arrested and disappeared to a camp in simulation to acclimate and test their enemy, the media and the general public.
[2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:06.400]  All of this is a probing of the enemy, us in this foreign banking takeover.
[2:39:06.400 --> 2:39:10.400]  And I'm going back to my guest, but I wanted to back up what he was saying right there.
[2:39:10.400 --> 2:39:20.400]  Because if the military was ready, when my guys are on tape, totally polite to say, arrest them, they're terrorists.
[2:39:20.400 --> 2:39:22.400]  They wanted to blow us up.
[2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:24.400]  Folks, they're ready to come arrest you at your house and take you away.
[2:39:24.400 --> 2:39:27.400]  And the average military person or cop, I've noticed, is not a bad person.
[2:39:27.400 --> 2:39:32.400]  But when they get in mob psychology, they're dressed up and nowhere to go.
[2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:33.400]  There's no real terrorists.
[2:39:33.400 --> 2:39:36.400]  So it's like sitting in a deer blind with their no deer.
[2:39:36.400 --> 2:39:38.400]  You're going to start imagining deer.
[2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:41.400]  Or you're going to go ahead and just shoot a 20 bird sitting in a tree for something to do.
[2:39:41.400 --> 2:39:44.400]  Believe me, I've done it.
[2:39:44.400 --> 2:39:45.400]  And so that's it.
[2:39:45.400 --> 2:39:46.400]  You just hype terrorists.
[2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:47.400]  They're in all the movies.
[2:39:47.400 --> 2:39:49.400]  It doesn't really even exist.
[2:39:49.400 --> 2:39:56.400]  But they're going to find them just like garbage collectors train in spot terrorists before RNC.
[2:39:56.400 --> 2:39:57.400]  That's only a special event.
[2:39:57.400 --> 2:39:58.400]  No, it's not nationwide.
[2:39:58.400 --> 2:40:02.400]  They're training the garbage collectors to do this.
[2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:03.400]  I've talked to the companies.
[2:40:03.400 --> 2:40:04.400]  It's on the news nationwide.
[2:40:04.400 --> 2:40:06.400]  They're training the cable person to spy on you.
[2:40:06.400 --> 2:40:07.400]  Think about it.
[2:40:07.400 --> 2:40:12.400]  You've got, you're paying for a service and they're in your house spying on you.
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:17.400]  And the head of the CIA says, yeah, all the new appliances have Trojan horse stuff you pay for.
[2:40:17.400 --> 2:40:20.400]  He laughed about it, spying on you.
[2:40:20.400 --> 2:40:23.400]  Homeland security just hacked itself and announced it.
[2:40:23.400 --> 2:40:26.400]  They used Stuxnet they launched to call for taking our rights.
[2:40:26.400 --> 2:40:28.400]  They're terrorists.
[2:40:28.400 --> 2:40:29.400]  They did 9-11.
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:32.400]  The information is incontrovertible.
[2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:36.400]  If you want to know how evil the folks are running things, they did 9-11.
[2:40:36.400 --> 2:40:40.400]  The foreign corporate crooks that run things did 9-11.
[2:40:40.400 --> 2:40:44.400]  They had NORAD stand down, ran drills of the exact targets being hit.
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:45.400]  I'm ranting, Dan.
[2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:49.400]  I wanted to just back up what you were saying about all that because these national level
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:53.400]  exercises, after they do them, they then it just stays in place.
[2:40:53.400 --> 2:40:56.400]  This is the training that, oh, it's only special.
[2:40:56.400 --> 2:40:57.400]  We're suspending your rights.
[2:40:57.400 --> 2:40:59.400]  And then it becomes permanent.
[2:40:59.400 --> 2:41:04.400]  Go ahead and continue with your research and the latest here on the stuff that you've got
[2:41:04.400 --> 2:41:07.400]  up on your site and the others about the flu.
[2:41:07.400 --> 2:41:13.400]  Because they said at the SPP in 2006 that leaked, we got sued and they got it, in 2007
[2:41:13.400 --> 2:41:19.400]  they would use the flu, terrorism, economic collapse to merge North America by stealth.
[2:41:19.400 --> 2:41:22.400]  And the number one agenda was keep it secret from the public.
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:23.400]  So that fits into it.
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:25.400]  Tell us about other research.
[2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:26.400]  Yeah.
[2:41:26.400 --> 2:41:31.400]  I just want to throw into my Skype connection stay smooth here that when we were at the
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:36.400]  G20 in Pittsburgh, we came very, very close to getting rated on the very first morning.
[2:41:36.400 --> 2:41:41.400]  It was only through basically a stroke of luck that we didn't get rated and all detained
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:42.400]  right off the bat.
[2:41:42.400 --> 2:41:48.400]  So, you know, we were, they definitely treat journalists as targeted individuals during
[2:41:48.400 --> 2:41:49.400]  these things.
[2:41:49.400 --> 2:41:53.400]  And once you kind of get used to that, it's a real strange environment and can be really
[2:41:53.400 --> 2:41:54.400]  disconcerting.
[2:41:54.400 --> 2:42:00.400]  I think one interesting aspect, again, so US Northern Command Northcom has these series
[2:42:00.400 --> 2:42:02.400]  of plans called con plans.
[2:42:02.400 --> 2:42:07.400]  And again, public intelligence.net is probably one of the best places to go look for this
[2:42:07.400 --> 2:42:08.400]  stuff.
[2:42:08.400 --> 2:42:14.400]  So one of these plans is called con plan 3591 pandemic influenza regional.
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:20.400]  And it is heavily redacted in the large file that they did release under FOIA.
[2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:24.400]  And it's very interesting that like, you know, things like public affairs structures, for
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:29.400]  example, are classified and you say, well, why does that need to be withheld from the
[2:42:29.400 --> 2:42:30.400]  American public?
[2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:32.400]  It's very strange.
[2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:37.400]  And obviously there's this, you know, creepy sort of bio defense industry that's like spreading
[2:42:37.400 --> 2:42:41.400]  out there, you know, reengineering every pathogen you can imagine.
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:42.400]  It's all very unregulated.
[2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:48.400]  It's a bio weapons program under the name of defense.
[2:42:48.400 --> 2:42:51.400]  And we've actually reverse engineered the domestic thing.
[2:42:51.400 --> 2:42:56.400]  They're going to take over cities, counties and state houses that don't submit.
[2:42:56.400 --> 2:42:58.400]  It's really in the John Warren Defense Authorization Act.
[2:42:58.400 --> 2:43:00.400]  That's why that's classified.
[2:43:00.400 --> 2:43:01.400]  Yeah, it's very concerning.
[2:43:01.400 --> 2:43:06.400]  And, you know, unfortunately, the reality is that, you know, it's just a little bit better,
[2:43:06.400 --> 2:43:07.400]  you know, work with public health.
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:12.400]  And people took a little more, you know, things like vitamin D, for example, a lot of the
[2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:15.400]  risk of these types of things would be really minimized.
[2:43:15.400 --> 2:43:19.400]  It's very cheap to just take vitamin D instead of like injecting people with untested vaccines
[2:43:19.400 --> 2:43:20.400]  all the time.
[2:43:20.400 --> 2:43:25.400]  And these are the kind, we could have all these different alternatives to this kind of thing
[2:43:25.400 --> 2:43:26.400]  going on.
[2:43:26.400 --> 2:43:30.400]  Another interesting too about national special security events is it's a good opportunity
[2:43:30.400 --> 2:43:35.400]  to observe different loopholes in the system at kind of the main area where they're all
[2:43:35.400 --> 2:43:36.400]  set up.
[2:43:36.400 --> 2:43:39.400]  All these trailers get brought in with all these different agencies that are involved.
[2:43:39.400 --> 2:43:44.400]  An important one to factor in is called the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency,
[2:43:44.400 --> 2:43:46.400]  which has many, many employees.
[2:43:46.400 --> 2:43:48.400]  And they actually set up at NSSEs.
[2:43:48.400 --> 2:43:53.400]  They set up a special domestic intelligence gathering waiver because they are a unit of
[2:43:53.400 --> 2:43:59.400]  their Pentagon Intelligence Agency, but they have a loophole that they set at NSSEs to do
[2:43:59.400 --> 2:44:00.400]  domestic intelligence gathering.
[2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:04.400]  That includes satellites breaking into everything that has backdoors.
[2:44:04.400 --> 2:44:06.400]  Absolute big brother criminality.
[2:44:06.400 --> 2:44:07.400]  Yeah.
[2:44:07.400 --> 2:44:08.400]  Yeah.
[2:44:08.400 --> 2:44:13.400]  And also too with NSSEs, there's kind of like a number of different riot control squads around
[2:44:13.400 --> 2:44:18.400]  the country that are paid by the federal government to get a bunch of equipment and come to these
[2:44:18.400 --> 2:44:19.400]  things.
[2:44:19.400 --> 2:44:22.400]  You know, Miami-Dade County is a major example.
[2:44:22.400 --> 2:44:26.400]  There's one from Illinois called the Illinois Law Enforcement Alert System.
[2:44:26.400 --> 2:44:30.400]  And so you can kind of go around and start documenting these things, looking at their
[2:44:30.400 --> 2:44:32.400]  different types of weaponry and stuff.
[2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:35.400]  And then you'll tend to see these guys popping up over and over again.
[2:44:35.400 --> 2:44:41.400]  I mentioned earlier that Homeland Security underneath ICE has created a new agency called
[2:44:41.400 --> 2:44:46.400]  Homeland Security Investigations, which has these giant kind of battle trucks and black
[2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:48.400]  helicopters, you name it, going on.
[2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:50.400]  And they're building out really fast too.
[2:44:50.400 --> 2:44:53.400]  And that's a snatch and grab operation.
[2:44:53.400 --> 2:44:54.400]  Yeah.
[2:44:54.400 --> 2:44:55.400]  Right.
[2:44:55.400 --> 2:44:56.400]  And yeah.
[2:44:56.400 --> 2:45:00.400]  And then one thing about them is that they're also kind of like the backup people underneath
[2:45:00.400 --> 2:45:02.400]  the secret service at NSSEs.
[2:45:02.400 --> 2:45:06.400]  So I would expect more of those guys to be showing up real soon.
[2:45:06.400 --> 2:45:11.400]  You know, so I think if you start looking carefully at national special security events, you start
[2:45:11.400 --> 2:45:16.400]  to see how they're sort of used to kind of run through the basis of these plans, kind of
[2:45:16.400 --> 2:45:17.400]  acclimate people to that.
[2:45:17.400 --> 2:45:24.400]  But then outside NSSEs, you know, for example, the National Guard here in Minnesota under
[2:45:24.400 --> 2:45:31.400]  a declaration from Governor Dayton and previously Governor Palenti, they delegate little National
[2:45:31.400 --> 2:45:34.400]  Guard officers into local police departments.
[2:45:34.400 --> 2:45:39.400]  And in one case, we went to like an award ceremony where I think her name was Nicole Hughes,
[2:45:39.400 --> 2:45:46.400]  was getting an award for doing network analysis that led to, you know, solving a murder investigation.
[2:45:46.400 --> 2:45:48.400]  But that's the example of the mission creep.
[2:45:48.400 --> 2:45:52.400]  It's like, well, we could just have the correct resources in police departments to do this
[2:45:52.400 --> 2:45:53.400]  thing.
[2:45:53.400 --> 2:45:56.400]  But instead, they're normalizing having the National Guard.
[2:45:56.400 --> 2:45:59.400]  It's the feds signed on to international treaties.
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:04.400]  Have you, I'm sure if you're looking at NLE documents, you notice all the foreign governments
[2:46:04.400 --> 2:46:09.400]  that come in and are involved in helping track the domestic uproar, they're training foreign
[2:46:09.400 --> 2:46:11.400]  troops for domestic operations.
[2:46:11.400 --> 2:46:13.400]  Because I mean, that's all in these documents.
[2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:14.400]  Have you seen that?
[2:46:14.400 --> 2:46:19.400]  Well, I mean, you know, and I think you guys did a really good job documenting the foreign
[2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:24.400]  troops that came into Chicago a while ago at that exercise that was there.
[2:46:24.400 --> 2:46:27.400]  I haven't seen too much in the way of foreign troops.
[2:46:27.400 --> 2:46:34.400]  But although there is a plan and Northcon released it that links with the U.S. with
[2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:35.400]  Canada, like there's definitely-
[2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:37.400]  Yeah, and the Mexican troops, yeah.
[2:46:37.400 --> 2:46:39.400]  And again, those are mainly tabletop.
[2:46:39.400 --> 2:46:43.400]  But the point is they're bringing them in and preparing to use troops from 15 different
[2:46:43.400 --> 2:46:46.400]  nations in all three countries.
[2:46:46.400 --> 2:46:47.400]  Yeah.
[2:46:47.400 --> 2:46:51.400]  I think, and then one with Canada, I think it was the acronym was CAP, like a civil
[2:46:51.400 --> 2:46:52.400]  assistance plan or something.
[2:46:52.400 --> 2:46:53.400]  Yeah.
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:54.400]  Yeah.
[2:46:54.400 --> 2:46:55.400]  A Northcon Canadian plan going on there.
[2:46:55.400 --> 2:46:56.400]  Well, the foreign troops are going to help us.
[2:46:56.400 --> 2:46:57.400]  I mean, that's a good thing.
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:46:58.400]  Yeah, right.
[2:46:58.400 --> 2:46:59.400]  Yeah.
[2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:02.400]  I mean, we live in a border state here in Minnesota and like Homeland Security wants
[2:47:02.400 --> 2:47:05.400]  to start, you know, flying all these drones around from North Dakota and stuff.
[2:47:05.400 --> 2:47:10.400]  And we had a recent exercise in Princeton, Minnesota of troops on the streets in much
[2:47:10.400 --> 2:47:13.400]  the same way as they were recently in St. Louis.
[2:47:13.400 --> 2:47:16.400]  So we got to, you know, keep an eye on these trends and then start asking the questions
[2:47:16.400 --> 2:47:19.400]  like, okay, are you guys running through this U.S.
[2:47:19.400 --> 2:47:22.400]  Northcon, Conplan 3501, Defense Support of Civil Authorities?
[2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:26.400]  Are you practicing for Conplan 3502, Civil Disturbance Operations?
[2:47:26.400 --> 2:47:30.400]  Getting a grip on that, getting a grip on these different frameworks.
[2:47:30.400 --> 2:47:31.400]  Yeah.
[2:47:31.400 --> 2:47:35.400]  Like the Domestic Operational Law Handbook lays out in Chapter 5, Civil Disturbance
[2:47:35.400 --> 2:47:40.400]  Operations, Title 10, Title 32, Dual Status Task Forces.
[2:47:40.400 --> 2:47:45.400]  We saw during the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the way that that was handled in a way
[2:47:45.400 --> 2:47:50.400]  that was incredibly friendly to BP and very corporatized in its setup.
[2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:57.400]  That was, I think, a pretty good example of how a Conplan 3501, DSCA, Defense Support
[2:47:57.400 --> 2:48:03.400]  of Civil Authorities Task Force, is organized and it matched pretty closely in its structure
[2:48:03.400 --> 2:48:09.400]  with the documents that I found from the NLE 2011 New Madrid exercise.
[2:48:09.400 --> 2:48:13.400]  So, you know, all of those things really fit together.
[2:48:13.400 --> 2:48:17.400]  And, you know, I just want to say, though, as things have escalated, we've seen, you know,
[2:48:17.400 --> 2:48:22.400]  the militarization of these tactics in so many different localities.
[2:48:22.400 --> 2:48:27.400]  And I would say that if nothing else, I think that the Occupy Movement sort of essentially
[2:48:27.400 --> 2:48:31.400]  kind of trolled the New World Order into, like, coming out in the open, sort of, like,
[2:48:31.400 --> 2:48:37.400]  sort of prompting a crackdown, because they just couldn't tolerate the image of all these
[2:48:37.400 --> 2:48:39.400]  people rising up and, you know...
[2:48:39.400 --> 2:48:40.400]  Exactly.
[2:48:40.400 --> 2:48:46.400]  We saw Homeland Security in, like, dozens of cities and 30-plus cities ordering the police
[2:48:46.400 --> 2:48:50.400]  to raid on certain nights, showing it's totally federalized.
[2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:54.400]  That should be the city, the county, the state, even if you are going to kick people off the
[2:48:54.400 --> 2:48:56.400]  street, which is bad enough.
[2:48:56.400 --> 2:48:57.400]  Yeah.
[2:48:57.400 --> 2:49:01.400]  So, there were definitely documents released about the federal protective service taking
[2:49:01.400 --> 2:49:03.400]  action in different places.
[2:49:03.400 --> 2:49:09.400]  And there was at least one pickup that happened to a friend of mine by Homeland Security here
[2:49:09.400 --> 2:49:13.400]  in Minneapolis, you know, right here in South Minneapolis.
[2:49:13.400 --> 2:49:17.400]  So, I think, you know, getting these things out in the open, I guess, so that, like, the
[2:49:17.400 --> 2:49:21.400]  whole country could see, like, you know, this is the trend that things are going on.
[2:49:21.400 --> 2:49:25.400]  This isn't just something that, you know, happens to, you know...
[2:49:25.400 --> 2:49:29.400]  For example, minority neighborhoods that get a lot of, like, state violence imposed on
[2:49:29.400 --> 2:49:30.400]  them.
[2:49:30.400 --> 2:49:32.400]  This isn't just something that happens at, like, Pittsburgh during the G20.
[2:49:32.400 --> 2:49:34.400]  This is going to happen in your city.
[2:49:34.400 --> 2:49:37.400]  They're going to break out, you know, the riot control instruments.
[2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:41.400]  They're going to take direction from the FBI to do everything at night when the media is
[2:49:41.400 --> 2:49:43.400]  not around and so forth.
[2:49:43.400 --> 2:49:48.400]  And, you know, here is one thing, a very interesting source, right?
[2:49:48.400 --> 2:49:50.400]  Kind of at the peak of the Occupy stuff.
[2:49:50.400 --> 2:49:56.400]  The first half of October when I was out in New York, a source told me that he had essentially
[2:49:56.400 --> 2:50:02.400]  been detained by an FBI office because they felt that he was starting to leak something
[2:50:02.400 --> 2:50:03.400]  out.
[2:50:03.400 --> 2:50:09.400]  And in his view, what he had been told by this insider was that the FBI had had four days
[2:50:09.400 --> 2:50:14.400]  of meetings and headquarters in Washington and that they were preparing for some kind
[2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:18.400]  of contingency aspect for mass detention domestically.
[2:50:18.400 --> 2:50:22.400]  And that this plan was being circulated only in writing, not really electronically.
[2:50:22.400 --> 2:50:24.400]  And it was called a 01.
[2:50:24.400 --> 2:50:27.400]  And so I thought that was fairly interesting.
[2:50:27.400 --> 2:50:30.400]  Obviously, it was very difficult to try to even confirm something like that.
[2:50:30.400 --> 2:50:34.400]  So we had to put it out there as being unconfirmed, but that there was a risk of this type of
[2:50:34.400 --> 2:50:36.400]  thing happening.
[2:50:36.400 --> 2:50:37.400]  Incredible.
[2:50:37.400 --> 2:50:38.400]  Stay there.
[2:50:38.400 --> 2:50:39.400]  One more segment on that.
[2:50:39.400 --> 2:50:40.400]  Yeah.
[2:50:40.400 --> 2:50:44.400]  And I'm aware of 01 Operation Black Star others.
[2:50:44.400 --> 2:50:48.400]  A little bit the NSA computer is going crazy.
[2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:50.400]  Operation Black Star.
[2:50:50.400 --> 2:50:53.400]  Anyways, a lot of this is admitted, though.
[2:50:53.400 --> 2:50:56.400]  I mean, they've got the reeducation camp document.
[2:50:56.400 --> 2:50:58.400]  And of course, they're planning to arrest people.
[2:50:58.400 --> 2:50:59.400]  They're criminals.
[2:50:59.400 --> 2:51:24.400]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[2:54:28.400 --> 2:54:30.400]  Our country was founded to try to block this,
[2:54:30.400 --> 2:54:32.400]  but it's happening here.
[2:54:32.400 --> 2:54:35.400]  Criminal special interests want to secure and expand
[2:54:35.400 --> 2:54:38.400]  their criminal illegitimate gains.
[2:54:38.400 --> 2:54:41.400]  And there's a fight for the heart and soul of the military
[2:54:41.400 --> 2:54:42.400]  and police.
[2:54:42.400 --> 2:54:43.400]  Instead of just talking about,
[2:54:43.400 --> 2:54:44.400]  oh, we're going to have a civil war.
[2:54:44.400 --> 2:54:48.400]  Let's buy some more guns and get ready for it.
[2:54:48.400 --> 2:54:50.400]  Why don't we reach out to police and military
[2:54:50.400 --> 2:54:53.400]  and journalists and the media and the city councils
[2:54:53.400 --> 2:54:57.400]  and go make an issue out of this now?
[2:54:57.400 --> 2:55:00.400]  Keep government and especially the uniform services
[2:55:00.400 --> 2:55:01.400]  on a very short leash,
[2:55:01.400 --> 2:55:05.400]  or you will get oppression every time.
[2:55:05.400 --> 2:55:11.400]  This is a historical fact, and I just beg.
[2:55:11.400 --> 2:55:14.400]  All of you in the military and police as well,
[2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:16.400]  I mean, you know things are changing.
[2:55:16.400 --> 2:55:18.400]  You know there's tyranny.
[2:55:18.400 --> 2:55:20.400]  I mean, I was sitting there in a restaurant
[2:55:20.400 --> 2:55:21.400]  next to four cops over there
[2:55:21.400 --> 2:55:24.400]  and was listening to them the entire time.
[2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:27.400]  And I was critical of some of the stuff they were doing.
[2:55:27.400 --> 2:55:29.400]  Other than that, I kept thinking they knew who I was,
[2:55:29.400 --> 2:55:31.400]  but they did, but they were talking about Obama
[2:55:31.400 --> 2:55:34.400]  and executive order to take over communications.
[2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:37.400]  And they were like, how do they do that?
[2:55:37.400 --> 2:55:40.400]  The point is people are realizing this is creepy.
[2:55:40.400 --> 2:55:45.400]  And our way of life is going to end if this goes through.
[2:55:45.400 --> 2:55:46.400]  They want to go to tyranny
[2:55:46.400 --> 2:55:48.400]  because they're going to get rid of the prosperity folks.
[2:55:48.400 --> 2:55:50.400]  They want that model.
[2:55:50.400 --> 2:55:51.400]  And I know I've been ranting.
[2:55:51.400 --> 2:55:52.400]  I've only got a couple minutes left.
[2:55:52.400 --> 2:55:56.400]  Dan fight specifically on the flu front though.
[2:55:56.400 --> 2:55:59.400]  I mean, you're raising the point about mass arrest.
[2:55:59.400 --> 2:56:02.400]  It's been admitted they plan to forcibly inoculate.
[2:56:02.400 --> 2:56:04.400]  It's been admitted like when they go pick up
[2:56:04.400 --> 2:56:07.400]  all the journalists or protesters before an event now
[2:56:07.400 --> 2:56:09.400]  and arrest them for no reason
[2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:12.400]  and always call beer making equipment bombs.
[2:56:12.400 --> 2:56:14.400]  I mean, people think, oh, they must be guilty.
[2:56:14.400 --> 2:56:16.400]  No folks, we've had the police say
[2:56:16.400 --> 2:56:19.400]  we're going to blow up the military
[2:56:19.400 --> 2:56:21.400]  for politely pulling up
[2:56:21.400 --> 2:56:24.400]  and saying, hi, we'd like to talk to your public information officer.
[2:56:24.400 --> 2:56:26.400]  We called here. They said, come over.
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:28.400]  And then an American scum
[2:56:28.400 --> 2:56:32.400]  would dare even try to talk to a military press person.
[2:56:32.400 --> 2:56:35.400]  I mean, we are the lowest filth on earth.
[2:56:35.400 --> 2:56:36.400]  You have to understand that
[2:56:36.400 --> 2:56:41.400]  from the Homeland Security perspective, Dan.
[2:56:41.400 --> 2:56:44.400]  In Chicago with the arrests of, you know,
[2:56:44.400 --> 2:56:46.400]  kind of Occupy related activists
[2:56:46.400 --> 2:56:48.400]  around the NATO summit there.
[2:56:48.400 --> 2:56:51.400]  There was also kind of a very similar setup
[2:56:51.400 --> 2:56:55.400]  with an informant kind of a very false flag scenario
[2:56:55.400 --> 2:56:59.400]  in a Cleveland sort of a staged like fake bombing thing going on.
[2:56:59.400 --> 2:57:01.400]  And then as we saw in Minneapolis,
[2:57:01.400 --> 2:57:04.400]  this DRE drug recognition evaluator program
[2:57:04.400 --> 2:57:07.400]  was trying to turn people informant into informants
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:09.400]  by exploiting drugs and chemical dependency
[2:57:09.400 --> 2:57:10.400]  and that kind of thing.
[2:57:10.400 --> 2:57:13.400]  So, you know, at the FBI level,
[2:57:13.400 --> 2:57:17.400]  there's a very certain tactic of trying to plant people
[2:57:17.400 --> 2:57:21.400]  in place as, you know, provocateurs, handlers, so forth.
[2:57:21.400 --> 2:57:24.400]  They try to kind of isolate, kind of spin off
[2:57:24.400 --> 2:57:26.400]  small groups of vulnerable people.
[2:57:26.400 --> 2:57:28.400]  That's pretty much how it happened in Cleveland.
[2:57:28.400 --> 2:57:31.400]  There's a really excellent film that was on PBS
[2:57:31.400 --> 2:57:32.400]  called Better This World,
[2:57:32.400 --> 2:57:35.400]  which covered the 2008 Republican National Convention.
[2:57:35.400 --> 2:57:36.400]  Totally set up.
[2:57:36.400 --> 2:57:38.400]  Molotov cocktail. Yeah, that's set up.
[2:57:38.400 --> 2:57:40.400]  And so that particular model
[2:57:40.400 --> 2:57:42.400]  is also the same kind of model
[2:57:42.400 --> 2:57:44.400]  that you're starting to see applied as the FBI.
[2:57:44.400 --> 2:57:47.400]  They tried to set me up
[2:57:47.400 --> 2:57:49.400]  and had cops coming around
[2:57:49.400 --> 2:57:50.400]  and people trying to set us up
[2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:53.400]  for the governor's mansion firebombing.
[2:57:53.400 --> 2:57:56.400]  And then the same guy connected to that
[2:57:56.400 --> 2:57:58.400]  ended up there in Minnesota.
[2:57:58.400 --> 2:57:59.400]  Yes, exactly.
[2:57:59.400 --> 2:58:00.400]  Those were definitely linked.
[2:58:00.400 --> 2:58:03.400]  And so it's the same kind of operational pattern.
[2:58:03.400 --> 2:58:07.400]  I got a batch of documents from earlier in the 2000s,
[2:58:07.400 --> 2:58:10.400]  FBI FOIA documents from Iowa
[2:58:10.400 --> 2:58:12.400]  and the extensive operations that they did there
[2:58:12.400 --> 2:58:14.400]  because it looked like they were trying to set up
[2:58:14.400 --> 2:58:15.400]  similar groups.
[2:58:15.400 --> 2:58:17.400]  They had confidential informants going on.
[2:58:17.400 --> 2:58:19.400]  So you can look up those stories.
[2:58:19.400 --> 2:58:21.400]  I call them co-intel pro-gothic.
[2:58:21.400 --> 2:58:22.400]  I tell you what, stay there.
[2:58:22.400 --> 2:58:24.400]  Let's do five more minutes into overdrive on this.
[2:58:24.400 --> 2:58:25.400]  I won't be able to finish that up.
[2:58:25.400 --> 2:58:27.400]  But yeah, folks, you don't understand
[2:58:27.400 --> 2:58:29.400]  how criminal the system is
[2:58:29.400 --> 2:58:31.400]  until your polite reporters pull up and go,
[2:58:31.400 --> 2:58:32.400]  hi, we're here to talk to people.
[2:58:32.400 --> 2:58:34.400]  They're like, you're bombers. Get them bombers.
[2:58:34.400 --> 2:58:37.400]  I mean, it's like they say we are,
[2:58:37.400 --> 2:58:42.400]  so we are off to the camp.
[2:58:42.400 --> 2:58:45.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[2:59:55.400 --> 2:59:59.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[2:59:59.400 --> 3:00:12.400]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:00:12.400 --> 3:00:14.400]  The Broadcasting Worldwide.
[3:00:14.400 --> 3:00:17.400]  Right now it is 7-Eleven.
[3:00:17.400 --> 3:00:22.400]  Wednesday the 11th day of July 2012.
[3:00:22.400 --> 3:00:26.400]  Dan Fite is a journalist and joins us right now.
[3:00:26.400 --> 3:00:29.400]  He was just getting into something
[3:00:29.400 --> 3:00:31.400]  that probably should have done the whole interview on.
[3:00:31.400 --> 3:00:33.400]  We only had about five minutes left here.
[3:00:33.400 --> 3:00:35.400]  Three or four minutes left, technically.
[3:00:35.400 --> 3:00:37.400]  And that's provocaturing.
[3:00:37.400 --> 3:00:39.400]  Again, I covered an urban warfare drill.
[3:00:39.400 --> 3:00:43.400]  Mike Hansen saw this, my camera guy, in Florida.
[3:00:43.400 --> 3:00:45.400]  And the military was really mad I was covering this.
[3:00:45.400 --> 3:00:49.400]  We found out because it was a roundup the town drill.
[3:00:49.400 --> 3:00:52.400]  And we'd go around the town, Brooksville, Florida,
[3:00:52.400 --> 3:00:54.400]  and they'd have military.
[3:00:54.400 --> 3:00:56.400]  People come out of their houses, this is on video,
[3:00:56.400 --> 3:01:01.400]  saying, your Alex Jones, the military told me not to talk to you.
[3:01:01.400 --> 3:01:05.400]  This was like 13 years ago when hardly anybody knew who I was.
[3:01:05.400 --> 3:01:08.400]  And then I'm there trying to film the military landing
[3:01:08.400 --> 3:01:11.400]  and practicing taking over the town at the local municipal airport.
[3:01:11.400 --> 3:01:13.400]  And like I said, they had this military guy
[3:01:13.400 --> 3:01:15.400]  who had been following us around in Austin,
[3:01:15.400 --> 3:01:17.400]  jump out of the bushes.
[3:01:17.400 --> 3:01:19.400]  We later learned, was assigned to him,
[3:01:19.400 --> 3:01:21.400]  and start setting fires going, you know,
[3:01:21.400 --> 3:01:23.400]  like the fires you're setting, Alex.
[3:01:23.400 --> 3:01:25.400]  He was like putting him out, he was like setting more.
[3:01:25.400 --> 3:01:27.400]  And I had to like, you know,
[3:01:27.400 --> 3:01:29.400]  I'm going to get into the whole story.
[3:01:29.400 --> 3:01:31.400]  The point is, stop the guy.
[3:01:31.400 --> 3:01:33.400]  And listen, you're nothing.
[3:01:33.400 --> 3:01:35.400]  They'll put you in prison in five seconds.
[3:01:35.400 --> 3:01:37.400]  That's what I'm telling you.
[3:01:37.400 --> 3:01:39.400]  Setting up Americans, we're the enemy.
[3:01:39.400 --> 3:01:41.400]  You have to understand, those running the country,
[3:01:41.400 --> 3:01:44.400]  tell you it's all about patriotism, but it's the opposite.
[3:01:44.400 --> 3:01:46.400]  They're here to bring this country down.
[3:01:46.400 --> 3:01:49.400]  And only being honest about how bad this is
[3:01:49.400 --> 3:01:51.400]  will ever get us out of this.
[3:01:51.400 --> 3:01:53.400]  But I've experienced it.
[3:01:53.400 --> 3:01:55.400]  I've experienced all sorts of stuff
[3:01:55.400 --> 3:01:57.400]  that until you witness it, it's hard to believe.
[3:01:57.400 --> 3:02:01.400]  Dan Fyte, finishing up your point on this front.
[3:02:01.400 --> 3:02:02.400]  Sure.
[3:02:02.400 --> 3:02:04.400]  I just wanted to sort of add that there's a real corrupt
[3:02:04.400 --> 3:02:07.400]  sort of incentive structure inside the FBI.
[3:02:07.400 --> 3:02:09.400]  It's called statistical accomplishments.
[3:02:09.400 --> 3:02:11.400]  And so whenever they can create an incident
[3:02:11.400 --> 3:02:13.400]  using informants, you know,
[3:02:13.400 --> 3:02:15.400]  trying to generate charges and stuff,
[3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:17.400]  they can get statistical accomplishments for their careers.
[3:02:17.400 --> 3:02:19.400]  And so the documents that I got were posted
[3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:23.400]  under Cointel Pro Gothic and Cointel Pro Gothic 2.
[3:02:23.400 --> 3:02:26.400]  And they show how statistical accomplishments
[3:02:26.400 --> 3:02:29.400]  are an integral part that motivates this entire process
[3:02:29.400 --> 3:02:31.400]  of interfering in domestic movements,
[3:02:31.400 --> 3:02:33.400]  declaring that, well, we think you're a terrorist.
[3:02:33.400 --> 3:02:36.400]  We're putting you on the watch list because of your political statements
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:38.400]  and things of that nature.
[3:02:38.400 --> 3:02:40.400]  I just want to say, though, on the positive side,
[3:02:40.400 --> 3:02:42.400]  there is a lot we can do in terms of research.
[3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:44.400]  I encourage everybody to do this.
[3:02:44.400 --> 3:02:46.400]  I've just been someone who's been plugging at it for a while,
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:49.400]  and I have a lot of friends who help me find the information
[3:02:49.400 --> 3:02:51.400]  and get the word out.
[3:02:51.400 --> 3:02:54.400]  There's a couple good wikis that are sort of collecting information
[3:02:54.400 --> 3:02:57.400]  aside from websites like publicintelligence.net,
[3:02:57.400 --> 3:02:59.400]  cryptome.org.
[3:02:59.400 --> 3:03:02.400]  There's also the Echelon 2 Project PM,
[3:03:02.400 --> 3:03:05.400]  which, wiki, which sort of collects information
[3:03:05.400 --> 3:03:07.400]  that anonymous type people have found.
[3:03:07.400 --> 3:03:12.400]  There's also another wiki called telecomics BSRE,
[3:03:12.400 --> 3:03:15.400]  which looks very specifically at the telecommunications
[3:03:15.400 --> 3:03:20.400]  vendors that sort of build these totalitarian turnkey states
[3:03:20.400 --> 3:03:22.400]  in different countries.
[3:03:22.400 --> 3:03:24.400]  So we can analyze those things very carefully.
[3:03:24.400 --> 3:03:27.400]  And then also, it's very important that we can all work together
[3:03:27.400 --> 3:03:30.400]  across really ideologically broad coalitions
[3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:34.400]  to raise these issues, bring them to our state legislatures.
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:37.400]  We've had very good luck raising awareness of the consequences
[3:03:37.400 --> 3:03:40.400]  of if the legislature in Minnesota were to expand
[3:03:40.400 --> 3:03:42.400]  and create something called criminal intelligence data,
[3:03:42.400 --> 3:03:45.400]  which lets them create open-ended dossiers on people.
[3:03:45.400 --> 3:03:48.400]  And so that's the kind of thing that you can organize against
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:50.400]  across the political spectrum.
[3:03:50.400 --> 3:03:52.400]  People are very skeptical of it.
[3:03:52.400 --> 3:03:54.400]  Local governments and local politicians don't necessarily
[3:03:54.400 --> 3:03:57.400]  want to spend the money, but they also, I know for a fact,
[3:03:57.400 --> 3:03:59.400]  they've told me, we can't go against the war on drugs
[3:03:59.400 --> 3:04:01.400]  because we don't have the leverage.
[3:04:01.400 --> 3:04:03.400]  It's hard to go up against the police.
[3:04:03.400 --> 3:04:06.400]  So you have to work on giving mainstream people
[3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:09.400]  some political cover if you want to try to at least block
[3:04:09.400 --> 3:04:11.400]  things from getting work.
[3:04:11.400 --> 3:04:13.400]  Thank you so much, Dan Fight.
[3:04:13.400 --> 3:04:15.400]  Plug your website real quick.
[3:04:15.400 --> 3:04:18.400]  Yeah, my main website is HongPong.com.
[3:04:18.400 --> 3:04:21.400]  I also work with Twin Cities Indy Media.
[3:04:21.400 --> 3:04:24.400]  I've been a member of the Global Revolution video collective
[3:04:24.400 --> 3:04:26.400]  with the Occupy Wall Street.
[3:04:26.400 --> 3:04:28.400]  So I've been involved in quite a few different things.
[3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:30.400]  Great job, Dan. We're going to talk to you soon.
[3:04:30.400 --> 3:04:32.400]  Thank you for all the time. Keep up the great work.
[3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:35.400]  Yeah, I mean, just ending here at this segment, I want to say this.
[3:04:35.400 --> 3:04:38.400]  The more of us that speak out, the more of us that get involved,
[3:04:38.400 --> 3:04:42.400]  the more of us that take action,
[3:04:42.400 --> 3:04:46.400]  the more of us that reach out.
[3:04:46.400 --> 3:04:48.400]  It gives other people cover.
[3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:51.400]  There's safety in numbers. So speak out.
[3:04:51.400 --> 3:04:53.400]  Say no. Point out the tyranny.
[3:04:53.400 --> 3:04:55.400]  Defend freedom. Do the right thing.
[3:04:55.400 --> 3:04:57.400]  Don't follow unlawful orders.
