[00:00:21.174 --> 00:00:21.694]  99 days.
[00:00:21.694 --> 00:00:28.579]  99 days until the historic election.
[00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:38.125]  The way Fox News counts it, they count the day of the election as well, so that'd be 100 days, but... Anyway, you slice it, we're getting close into this historic event.
[00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:42.628]  Okay, I have done a lot of preparation for this Sunday transmission.
[00:00:42.628 --> 00:00:47.831]  Also, Ted Nugent's gonna be calling in at the start of the second hour today with some really huge news.
[00:00:48.752 --> 00:00:56.135]  The Democrats banned a pro-police rally in New York.
[00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:59.837]  The governor just said you can't have it.
[00:00:59.837 --> 00:01:03.319]  And said any police that, you know, show up or give you support, they'll be fired.
[00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:04.519]  Any state police will be fired.
[00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.040]  He's God now.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.181]  He said because of COVID.
[00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:10.202]  But everybody else can demonstrate and have your protest.
[00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:15.765]  This is how the globalist, communist, Illuminati system operates.
[00:01:16.906 --> 00:01:18.728]  He'll be popping in.
[00:01:18.728 --> 00:01:20.671]  Okay, so it's now official.
[00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:25.718]  We've had Pelosi, we've had Biden, we've had Schiff, we've had...
[00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:47.826]  Eric Holder, the former Attorney General, we've had them all come out and say, Trump's a dictator already, he works for the Russians, and he's going to lose the election, and then if he challenges it in any way, he is a dictator, and the military is going to remove him, and if the military doesn't remove him, we'll have them arrested.
[00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:48.927]  And we'll burn down all the cities.
[00:01:52.415 --> 00:01:55.897]  Next, Atlantic Monthly, which is the mouth of the New World Order.
[00:01:55.897 --> 00:01:59.780]  Even more than the New York Times here in the U.S., it's the Financial Times of London.
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.401]  Over in England, that's the Rothschild mouthpiece.
[00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.730]  They're openly saying violence and riots will skyrocket if Trump wins election.
[00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.270]  You better not do it.
[00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:19.113]  And then Moody's and Barron's and all of the ratings agencies and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan all say this will be a contested election.
[00:02:19.113 --> 00:02:20.493]  It's going to be a disaster.
[00:02:20.493 --> 00:02:23.234]  The mail-in ballots, the fraud.
[00:02:23.234 --> 00:02:26.975]  And if Trump points any of that out or you do, you're a dictator.
[00:02:26.975 --> 00:02:32.416]  Even though the Democrats win and if they lose, I think right now there's anywhere near a fair election they're going to lose.
[00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:38.683]  The silent majority is really pissed, but they don't care.
[00:02:38.683 --> 00:02:58.952]  They will contest it, and when Trump says, you're there wrong, they're going to activate folks to burn the country down, and with 99 days out, this is all a beta test drill for that, and the censorship's in place, and the AI kill switch is in place, and Trump has not gotten control of the Obama kill switch, but the deep state still has, or the globalists that are installed at all those levels.
[00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:04.988]  What they call stay behind networks or embeds.
[00:03:04.988 --> 00:03:08.370]  So that is all coming up here tonight.
[00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.151]  We will break it down.
[00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:15.375]  The country and the entire world is in really unparalleled peril.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.101]  And I do not have words to describe to you how serious the situation is.
[00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:23.522]  They've done everything they can to try to take us off air at this time.
[00:03:23.522 --> 00:03:32.485]  We're still on hundreds of radio stations, over 100 cable and TV stations, and we have huge audiences at Band.Video and InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:03:32.485 --> 00:03:36.747]  But remember, you are critical in this fight.
[00:03:36.747 --> 00:03:45.510]  Without you taking action and getting excited and telling people via email, via text message and word of mouth about Band.Video, about InfoWars.com, Ford's last show,
[00:03:46.957 --> 00:03:59.101]  Without you telling them that all the doctors and scientists and whistleblowers that have been exposing the COVID-19 takeover hoax, without you getting that information out, we're going to lose this fight.
[00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:01.841]  And I've got some incredible examples of that.
[00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:04.082]  Eric Bolling is going to be back on the show soon.
[00:04:04.082 --> 00:04:05.803]  He, of course, left Fox.
[00:04:05.803 --> 00:04:09.364]  The left celebrated it when his son overdosed on an opiate.
[00:04:09.364 --> 00:04:10.064]  He's a good guy.
[00:04:11.775 --> 00:04:23.829]  He was doing a report for Sinclair, it's as big as Fox or bigger around the country, the broadcast stations, about gain of function and how Fauci was involved with the Wuhan lab, weaponizing all of it.
[00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:29.195]  You know, I personally have sent him and Tucker Carlson and a bunch of other people hundreds of articles.
[00:04:29.195 --> 00:04:30.237]  I'll show you some of them today.
[00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:33.467]  Hell, from the NIH website, how Fauci did this.
[00:04:33.467 --> 00:04:34.428]  It's not even hidden.
[00:04:34.428 --> 00:04:36.430]  But CNN's policing it.
[00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.213]  And they made some calls, and Sinclair's not gonna air it now.
[00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:42.935]  Because, you know, Fauci's God.
[00:04:42.935 --> 00:04:44.977]  Everything he says is a lie, a fraud.
[00:04:44.977 --> 00:04:49.621]  He threw in the first pitch at a baseball game, was like 30 feet off the mound, in left field.
[00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:52.744]  I mean, they all cheered for him.
[00:04:52.744 --> 00:04:55.767]  I mean, the guy is a frickin' criminal who needs to be indicted.
[00:04:59.244 --> 00:05:03.448]  Three reasons that the globalists launch this planetary lockdown.
[00:05:03.448 --> 00:05:07.632]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[00:05:07.632 --> 00:05:12.116]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[00:05:12.116 --> 00:05:18.182]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[00:05:18.182 --> 00:05:24.408]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential.
[00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:34.416]  As we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[00:05:34.416 --> 00:05:38.479]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.622]  It's been pre-planned, organized, globally.
[00:05:41.622 --> 00:05:43.863]  And it's extremely predatory.
[00:05:43.863 --> 00:05:55.051]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[00:05:55.635 --> 00:06:00.879]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:21.955]  Thank you so much for joining us on this July 26th Sunday live broadcast.
[00:06:21.955 --> 00:06:24.978]  99 days out from this historic election.
[00:06:26.192 --> 00:06:34.420]  Well, I have here in my hands, and I'm your host Alex Jones, thank you for joining us, CNN, the police dogs of thought crime.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:42.287]  Sinclair says it will postpone and rework segment featuring conspiracy theory about Fauci.
[00:06:42.287 --> 00:06:50.575]  And it says that without any proof, though they don't show the piece, they were going to look at Fauci at the NIH for 45 years.
[00:06:52.498 --> 00:07:02.641]  Involving gain-of-function transfers of weaponized coronavirus during the Obama administration.
[00:07:02.641 --> 00:07:04.801]  Now, Dr. McCamshaw, please.
[00:07:04.801 --> 00:07:08.422]  Look right here.
[00:07:08.422 --> 00:07:13.524]  NIH lifts funding pause on gain-of-function research.
[00:07:13.524 --> 00:07:15.805]  NIH.gov.
[00:07:15.805 --> 00:07:20.866]  And it gets into Fauci and the programs and Bill and Melinda Gates and the actual gain-of-function.
[00:07:22.196 --> 00:07:23.477]  Here's Newsweek.
[00:07:23.477 --> 00:07:26.178]  Dr. Fauci back controversial Wuhan lab with U.S.
[00:07:26.178 --> 00:07:34.523]  dollars for risky coronavirus research with spliced virus chimeras using weaponized bat viruses.
[00:07:34.523 --> 00:07:34.663]  Oh.
[00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:36.604]  Okay.
[00:07:36.604 --> 00:07:38.005]  Here's another one.
[00:07:38.005 --> 00:07:38.085]  2015.
[00:07:38.085 --> 00:07:40.667]  Lab-made coronavirus triggers debate.
[00:07:40.667 --> 00:07:47.210]  Gain-of-function weaponized SARS COVID-2 virus.
[00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.592]  And it goes into how deadly it is to transfer it.
[00:07:51.423 --> 00:07:54.684]  I'll be getting into that a little bit later.
[00:07:54.684 --> 00:07:56.925]  The Emperor has no clothes.
[00:07:56.925 --> 00:08:03.248]  Everything Fauci has told us has been a giant, galactic-sized lie.
[00:08:03.248 --> 00:08:07.469]  He told us 2.5 million would be dead in America, then 2.2 million.
[00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:11.631]  Then he told us all the hospitals would be full and we needed hundreds of thousands of ventilators.
[00:08:14.008 --> 00:08:20.674]  And now as they test everybody, the number of positives goes up, the number of deaths goes down, but they put up a set of headlines saying record deaths.
[00:08:20.674 --> 00:08:24.017]  Then they'll say, oh, because it's some little town had three deaths.
[00:08:24.017 --> 00:08:26.339]  They didn't have any before, so now it's record deaths.
[00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:30.883]  They're all playing semantical games.
[00:08:30.883 --> 00:08:38.990]  And Greg Reeves did an excellent report that we're going to air coming up at the bottom of the hour, where he shows the NIH website currently.
[00:08:40.231 --> 00:08:53.223]  Admitting that if you've ever had a bacterial infection, I didn't know that, they've added that, or a coronavirus, that's the common cold, or the flu, usually in about a decade, you will test positive for COVID-19.
[00:08:53.223 --> 00:09:01.250]  So when you see stories about there's 60% false positives, bull, you know what?
[00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.334]  Unbelievable fraud, because it was the Wuhan lab
[00:09:06.616 --> 00:09:18.302]  That had a Bill of Melinda Gates finance directive in it that created the test that was then approved seven months ago in China that we then adopted.
[00:09:18.302 --> 00:09:20.683]  Look it up.
[00:09:20.683 --> 00:09:23.164]  Unbelievable.
[00:09:23.164 --> 00:09:28.647]  And medical doctors are trying to write books and publish them and Amazon won't even let them sell them.
[00:09:28.647 --> 00:09:33.770]  But it's all NIH, it's all, that's what's crazy is none of this is even hidden.
[00:09:38.092 --> 00:09:40.393]  I just showed you New Scientist.
[00:09:40.393 --> 00:09:43.354]  I just showed you NIH.
[00:09:43.354 --> 00:10:06.685]  I just showed you Newsweek saying Fauci ran the programs with Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation grants from them to the NIH and then given to the Wuhan lab in the hundreds of millions of dollars illegal gain-of-function weaponized testing that they shipped to China to do it there.
[00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:13.698]  Just like the CIA has black torture sites in China under Obama.
[00:10:13.698 --> 00:10:30.068]  But then Sinclair, bigger than Fox, thousands of TV stations around the country, tried to air it, CNN tattled, and so now they're not gonna do it right.
[00:10:30.068 --> 00:10:31.989]  Now this is how crazy this is.
[00:10:33.737 --> 00:10:42.105]  It's like if Eric Bolling wanted to have a thing on Sinclair saying Santa Claus has a big white beard and Santa Claus wears a red and white outfit.
[00:10:42.105 --> 00:10:43.286]  He's a jolly old elf.
[00:10:43.286 --> 00:10:44.968]  They'd say, oh, you can't talk about that.
[00:10:44.968 --> 00:10:48.751]  Santa Claus wears a green outfit.
[00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:51.274]  It's unbelievable fraud.
[00:10:51.274 --> 00:10:53.696]  Let me just stop there.
[00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:54.437]  Let me just stop there.
[00:11:03.615 --> 00:11:28.533]  The very same criminal groups that have brought you the overblown hoax of COVID-19, the very same groups that are telling us that we can never reopen the country again, but China's wide open, are the same ones telling you that every day when Black Lives Matter
[00:11:29.904 --> 00:11:36.027]  And Antifa shoot up innocent people's cars, in many cases brain damaging them and killing them.
[00:11:36.027 --> 00:11:39.729]  A whole bunch of deaths in the last three days.
[00:11:39.729 --> 00:11:48.833]  That that's peaceful, while simultaneously saying, we're gonna burn the country down if Trump gets re-elected in Atlantic Monthly.
[00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:55.376]  Oh, and we're gonna use the military to take Trump out if we challenge the election and he doesn't bow to that.
[00:11:55.376 --> 00:11:56.817]  I've got a bunch of compilations
[00:11:57.961 --> 00:12:04.244]  of people being shot and shot at when we come back.
[00:12:04.244 --> 00:12:19.130]  And I'm going to go over for radio listeners and narrate it, but you have to understand that this is systematic, terroristic activity being done to bring this nation to its knees and intimidate Americans.
[00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.250]  And people say, well, Americans won't be intimidated.
[00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.051]  This will backfire.
[00:12:22.051 --> 00:12:22.271]  Really?
[00:12:25.336 --> 00:12:32.279]  Public schools and colleges all over the country, if you try to say man or woman on the entrance form, we'll throw you out!
[00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:34.479]  We live in a cult!
[00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:39.601]  Look at political correctness!
[00:12:39.601 --> 00:12:48.045]  On YouTube, they get strikes on famous chess channels if white knight takes black pawn, because that could be seen as racist.
[00:12:48.045 --> 00:12:49.925]  I was telling a lawyer that the other day, he didn't believe me.
[00:12:49.925 --> 00:12:51.606]  He pulled it up and his mouth fell open.
[00:12:54.161 --> 00:13:06.190]  That's the level of the cult and we've bowed to them so much for so long they think we're going to bow to them again and forever.
[00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.653]  But one young man last night in Austin thought that too.
[00:13:09.653 --> 00:13:11.334]  We'll play that when we come back.
[00:13:11.334 --> 00:13:13.476]  He's got his AK-47.
[00:13:13.476 --> 00:13:15.438]  He's too ignorant to know that it's actually like a Mac 90.
[00:13:15.438 --> 00:13:16.699]  It's semi-auto.
[00:13:18.325 --> 00:13:21.106]  And he says, you know, I'd like to kill some police.
[00:13:21.106 --> 00:13:22.706]  If I kill cops, they'll kill me.
[00:13:22.706 --> 00:13:24.287]  So we'll see.
[00:13:24.287 --> 00:13:30.009]  He goes, none of these people out here that we're going to be menacing or threatening have got any balls.
[00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:33.870]  And so he said, well, you'll see what he said when we come back.
[00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.531]  We'll play that first.
[00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:39.652]  And then he runs out into traffic and blocks people's cars.
[00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.293]  And the witnesses say he raised the gun.
[00:13:41.293 --> 00:13:43.454]  And there's video of him raising it up towards the window.
[00:13:43.454 --> 00:13:47.195]  And then you hear what sounds like rifle shots and then handgun shots.
[00:13:47.995 --> 00:13:50.636]  And some journalists are saying that that's why the news is being suppressive.
[00:13:50.636 --> 00:13:51.317]  What happened?
[00:13:51.317 --> 00:13:55.098]  Because it looks like it's like a Somali in Seattle drove through.
[00:13:55.098 --> 00:13:56.559]  They were running around on the road at night.
[00:13:56.559 --> 00:13:57.359]  He hit two women.
[00:13:57.359 --> 00:13:59.040]  They wanted to say it was a white supremacist.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.101]  For days they wouldn't say what color he was.
[00:14:01.101 --> 00:14:06.463]  It was a Somali guy that just got on the highway and people ran out in front of him at night.
[00:14:06.463 --> 00:14:09.224]  Then you saw that story go away.
[00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:10.465]  But the point is, is that
[00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:29.774]  You heard a white supremacist attack somebody for no reason in Austin last night, and then we've got all this footage of BLM, mainly white people, and Antifa all over the country running out in roads and just shooting at vehicles.
[00:14:29.774 --> 00:14:36.055]  But I kept saying, man, in a lot of areas of Texas, you run up and surround somebody's car and then point a rifle at them?
[00:14:37.654 --> 00:14:43.099]  It's not gonna go well, but that's why the orders from Soros have come down in places like St.
[00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:48.243]  Louis with the McCluskey family, where they broke down their gate, came on their yard, were threatening to kill them.
[00:14:48.243 --> 00:14:49.404]  It's on the video.
[00:14:49.404 --> 00:14:50.565]  They pointed guns at them.
[00:14:50.565 --> 00:14:52.006]  One of them was a prop.
[00:14:52.006 --> 00:14:53.168]  They were lawyers.
[00:14:53.168 --> 00:14:54.589]  It was a prop from a case they had.
[00:14:58.049 --> 00:15:09.073]  And they SWAT teamed them, now they've indicted them, because they want the message that when we come to burn your house, you bow down and don't fight back, so the riots can get steam and really burn down the country.
[00:15:09.073 --> 00:15:23.719]  Because they want the citizens to stand down, and the police to stand down, so they can take full control of all the government buildings, just like the Bolsheviks did in 1917, and refuse fascism, and all the Soros-funded groups admit that's their plan!
[00:15:23.719 --> 00:15:25.220]  And they just overthrew Ukraine!
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:31.883]  Five years ago, with the very same groups, and the very same tactics!
[00:15:31.883 --> 00:15:38.526]  And now, Atlantic Monthly and others are saying, and remember what Maxine Waters said, confront these people everywhere, attack them everywhere!
[00:15:38.526 --> 00:15:43.149]  And now they've gone to the head of DHS's house, and they're threatening him!
[00:15:43.149 --> 00:15:45.110]  Because that's what they do!
[00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.211]  They went to Mitch McConnell's house and said, we're gonna murder you!
[00:15:48.373 --> 00:15:53.456]  When Mitch said it was wrong, Twitter censored him and Mitch McConnell faint twittering on his knees.
[00:15:53.456 --> 00:15:56.838]  So you're capitulating as asking for this.
[00:15:56.838 --> 00:16:07.183]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[00:16:07.183 --> 00:16:11.886]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[00:16:12.566 --> 00:16:20.928]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[00:16:20.928 --> 00:16:40.794]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsite, summit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[00:16:41.454 --> 00:16:42.475]  Destinies.
[00:16:42.475 --> 00:16:49.421]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy.
[00:16:49.421 --> 00:16:53.926]  But being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it.
[00:16:53.926 --> 00:16:57.649]  So take action or be slaves.
[00:16:57.649 --> 00:17:05.757]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:11.841]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:14.183]  Super Male Vitality!
[00:17:14.183 --> 00:17:23.027]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[00:17:23.027 --> 00:17:33.893]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[00:17:34.193 --> 00:17:34.873]  Yes.
[00:17:34.873 --> 00:17:39.776]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[00:17:39.776 --> 00:17:46.599]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:47.760]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.620]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.422]  Never been a better time than right now.
[00:17:52.422 --> 00:18:00.506]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:00.506 --> 00:18:03.187]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:20.746 --> 00:18:33.535]  The social engineers, the globalists, and their bought-and-paid-for corporate media that's back on the chi-coms and every other America-hating institution are counting on sucker-punching the American people.
[00:18:34.329 --> 00:18:58.943]  But I've been reading the Council on Foreign Relations reports and tracking them since Trump got elected, and they talked about triggering nationwide riots, calling it racial, and then using that as the pretext to have a coup against the President, and then they think everybody will just sit down in fear and accept it, but they need a lockdown in place first, and that's what they're using the virus for, so you're used to being told, stay in your home, do what we say.
[00:18:58.943 --> 00:19:01.485]  We've already put you into that artificial martial law.
[00:19:02.247 --> 00:19:03.908]  So here's the headline of the live show today.
[00:19:03.908 --> 00:19:04.648]  I hope you'll share it.
[00:19:04.648 --> 00:19:05.629]  That's how we reach new people.
[00:19:05.629 --> 00:19:06.690]  And stop this!
[00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.210]  Red alert!
[00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:11.012]  Deep state Dems have already launched a violent plan to overthrow the U.S.
[00:19:11.012 --> 00:19:12.773]  government.
[00:19:12.773 --> 00:19:16.835]  Now let me show you some news articles and I'm going to play the clips proving it all.
[00:19:16.835 --> 00:19:17.656]  Schiff!
[00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:21.298]  Trump will refuse to accept election results and allow peaceful transition.
[00:19:21.298 --> 00:19:26.401]  Though they're the ones gearing up for total violence now with people being killed every couple hours.
[00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:27.962]  And the media in lockstep covering it up.
[00:19:28.706 --> 00:19:30.427]  Leftist mag issues threat.
[00:19:30.427 --> 00:19:33.488]  Violence and riots will skyrocket if Trump wins election.
[00:19:33.488 --> 00:19:35.109]  That's Atlantic Monthly.
[00:19:35.109 --> 00:19:39.431]  Black Trump supporter executed in broad daylight for holding up a Trump sign in Wisconsin.
[00:19:39.431 --> 00:19:40.371]  Leftist pledge.
[00:19:40.371 --> 00:19:43.853]  Anyone supporting Trump will be murdered.
[00:19:43.853 --> 00:19:46.133]  All they want to do is condemn law enforcement.
[00:19:46.133 --> 00:19:49.815]  DHS Secretary Chad Wolf blasts Democrats on Fox News.
[00:19:49.815 --> 00:19:52.576]  They come to his house, threaten to kill him.
[00:19:52.576 --> 00:19:53.497]  That's right, townhall.com.
[00:19:54.537 --> 00:20:01.240]  Meanwhile, Portland rioters occupy exterior federal courthouse, raise American flag upside down, because they're inverting it.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:01.860]  Actually, it's true.
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.101]  The country is in crisis.
[00:20:04.101 --> 00:20:06.122]  That's coming up.
[00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:11.984]  Radio host mocks Trump by claiming Seattle's peaceful, then rioters burn down his apartment building.
[00:20:11.984 --> 00:20:18.287]  Video Colorado BLM protester shoots fellow demonstrator while aiming at a car that sped through the crowd.
[00:20:18.287 --> 00:20:20.348]  They just ran on the highway trying to be hit.
[00:20:21.343 --> 00:20:24.184]  And the glass from a Somali hit him so they couldn't say white supremacist.
[00:20:24.184 --> 00:20:25.124]  The guy didn't know what was happening.
[00:20:25.124 --> 00:20:27.185]  He just ran out in front of him at night.
[00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:28.826]  Protests erupt across country.
[00:20:28.826 --> 00:20:31.807]  Black militia member accidentally shoots comrades in parts.
[00:20:31.807 --> 00:20:34.568]  Probably blames white supremacism.
[00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:40.610]  Black Lives Matter activists have their toddlers carry F the police signs and use them as human shields.
[00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.492]  Black conservatives stabbed by anti-med during Portland Black Lives Matter riots.
[00:20:44.492 --> 00:20:45.292]  Shocking video.
[00:20:45.292 --> 00:20:46.813]  We're going to play all this next segment.
[00:20:47.887 --> 00:20:49.628]  And the flag upside down.
[00:20:49.628 --> 00:20:51.268]  Austin Protester.
[00:20:51.268 --> 00:20:52.428]  Allegedly armed with AK-47.
[00:20:52.428 --> 00:20:54.129]  I don't know why it says allegedly.
[00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:55.889]  I mean, he said he had an AK-47.
[00:20:55.889 --> 00:20:58.130]  It was a semi-automatic version of that.
[00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:02.992]  Shot by a driver while blocking traffic and approaching vehicle.
[00:21:02.992 --> 00:21:06.553]  We're gonna get to that first, right now.
[00:21:06.553 --> 00:21:09.294]  Listen to what... By the way, look at this guy's background.
[00:21:09.294 --> 00:21:11.734]  You talk about a creep.
[00:21:11.734 --> 00:21:12.615]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:17.985]  You talk about bizarre and stupid.
[00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:20.807]  LARPing out at night, blocking traffic with a gun, pointing it at somebody.
[00:21:20.807 --> 00:21:22.068]  It's a threat.
[00:21:22.068 --> 00:21:24.010]  People have a right to defend themselves.
[00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:27.433]  But this individual, we've got his name, all the information is on InfoWars.com.
[00:21:27.433 --> 00:21:35.620]  Here's what he said about 10 minutes before he ran out with a mob to stop cars, pointed his gun reportedly at somebody and got shot.
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:35.920]  Here it is.
[00:21:37.762 --> 00:21:43.512]  They don't let us march in the streets anymore, so gotta practice some of our rights.
[00:21:50.788 --> 00:21:54.372]  Do you feel like you'll need to use it?
[00:21:54.372 --> 00:21:55.213]  No.
[00:21:55.213 --> 00:22:00.479]  I think the, uh... I mean, if I use it against the cops, I'm dead.
[00:22:00.479 --> 00:22:10.411]  And... I think all the people that hate us and, you know, want to say sh** to us are too big of pussies to stop and actually do anything about it, so...
[00:22:10.891 --> 00:22:13.093]  Why'd you start carrying?
[00:22:13.093 --> 00:22:18.496]  Well, our roommate got arrested and they stopped letting us march anywhere, so I started carrying.
[00:22:18.496 --> 00:22:18.636]  Thanks.
[00:22:32.045 --> 00:22:34.207]  The photos are on Infowars.com and the article about it.
[00:22:34.207 --> 00:22:35.628]  We have screenshots of it.
[00:22:35.628 --> 00:22:38.069]  And he's there with the rifle up pointing at somebody.
[00:22:38.069 --> 00:22:42.032]  Well, he pointed a gun at somebody there, son, for no reason.
[00:22:42.032 --> 00:22:44.953]  But you hear in the video, it sounds like he's shooting first.
[00:22:44.953 --> 00:22:48.576]  You hear a rifle shoot, then you hear three shots return that are muffled.
[00:22:49.468 --> 00:22:55.353]  And that's what experts are looking at the tape are saying, but of course it will be covered up by the leftist city of Austin, if that is indeed the case.
[00:22:55.353 --> 00:22:59.657]  But regardless, run out in traffic, block somebody, point a gun at them, this is what happens.
[00:22:59.657 --> 00:23:05.262]  We have all these videos that just happened of them shooting at cars and actually shooting people.
[00:23:05.262 --> 00:23:07.443]  And when it happens, it's hardly on the news.
[00:23:07.443 --> 00:23:13.048]  It's a little blip on the radar screen that, oh, peaceful protesters shot somebody else today.
[00:23:13.048 --> 00:23:14.509]  Here's one shot video.
[00:23:14.509 --> 00:23:17.052]  BLM Antifa rioter shoots driver
[00:23:18.615 --> 00:23:22.856]  Trying to pass protest across the country.
[00:23:22.856 --> 00:23:26.996]  Black militia member accidentally shoots comrades in a park.
[00:23:26.996 --> 00:23:36.598]  And we're showing all this for TV viewers.
[00:23:36.598 --> 00:23:37.098]  Let's do this.
[00:23:37.098 --> 00:23:38.218]  Let's let's do this.
[00:23:38.218 --> 00:23:39.719]  Let's start over.
[00:23:39.719 --> 00:23:45.840]  Let's start over to the beginning and let's roll compilation clip.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.300]  One place.
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:46.620]  Here it is.
[00:23:49.622 --> 00:23:52.885]  So the guy's driving down the road, and they just shoot at him.
[00:23:52.885 --> 00:23:55.468]  There's your peaceful Soros, folks.
[00:23:55.468 --> 00:23:58.731]  Now, here's Kentucky yesterday.
[00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:02.254]  And they just fire a shotgun at people.
[00:24:02.254 --> 00:24:09.241]  And they tell everybody to get down.
[00:24:09.241 --> 00:24:14.686]  And these folks are also a video, coming up to random cars and saying, I'll kill you, to white people.
[00:24:15.839 --> 00:24:20.085]  Here's some more BLM, mainly white trendies in Aurora, Colorado.
[00:24:20.085 --> 00:24:21.146]  There's chopper footage.
[00:24:21.146 --> 00:24:26.393]  They just run out on the highway and the car doesn't know what to do, so they shoot at it.
[00:24:26.393 --> 00:24:29.477]  Here's the Austin protester with his AK-47.
[00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:45.880]  Who runs out and again, we've got paused still shots on InfoWars.com from the video showing him with the rifle up to the window of the car with people beating on it, screaming, going, he's white, he's white, trying to pull the white person out.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.582]  And it's white people mainly saying and doing it.
[00:24:48.582 --> 00:24:50.903]  It's like when H. Skrillex famously yells it.
[00:24:50.903 --> 00:24:53.205]  Owen Schroeder says, you don't have a right to speak.
[00:24:53.205 --> 00:24:54.466]  You're an effing white male.
[00:24:56.343 --> 00:25:04.325]  That's the craziness of you're just downtown Austin driving, and there are people with guns and hatchets and hammers, and they've attacked us with hammers.
[00:25:04.325 --> 00:25:06.186]  And the media goes, well, Jones deserves it!
[00:25:06.186 --> 00:25:07.886]  This is peaceful!
[00:25:07.886 --> 00:25:20.170]  And all these armchair leftists, like the mayor of Portland, went out to support them, burning down the courthouse, and then they attack him because he's an old white dude.
[00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.911]  They go, look, he's white!
[00:25:21.911 --> 00:25:25.792]  They don't even know he's the mayor under Soros, commanding them!
[00:25:28.035 --> 00:25:35.620]  They don't even know he's their general come to praise them while they pull down the American flag and hoist it upside down.
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:42.564]  Not even knowing they put up the right symbol that America is in grave distress and is in grave crisis.
[00:25:42.564 --> 00:25:51.209]  We're going to go to break and I'm going to come back and go through more videos and individual videos of them shooting people in the head with pleasure.
[00:25:51.209 --> 00:25:54.251]  You're just driving your truck, they run out in front of you.
[00:25:54.251 --> 00:25:55.252]  Here's Utah right here.
[00:25:57.682 --> 00:26:01.524]  And boom, and we've got Colorado, another Colorado.
[00:26:01.524 --> 00:26:07.246]  Oh wait, there's more, not just yesterday's Colorado, we have another Colorado, where they shoot the man.
[00:26:07.246 --> 00:26:11.769]  Last time I heard, he's in critical condition, brain dead.
[00:26:11.769 --> 00:26:18.832]  And it was a liberal white lawyer, did it, and he, in his mugshot, he's so proud of what he did, he shot a Nazi.
[00:26:20.174 --> 00:26:24.455]  And oh, by the way, when they shot him in the head, he drove a few blocks and passed out.
[00:26:24.455 --> 00:26:28.597]  They went to the police and said, a white supremacist attacked us.
[00:26:28.597 --> 00:26:30.537]  Oh, yes, yes.
[00:26:30.537 --> 00:26:35.739]  That's what happens when they run and jump on your car right out on the highway in front of a Somali.
[00:26:35.739 --> 00:26:36.979]  Oh, look, there's a car going at you.
[00:26:36.979 --> 00:26:37.859]  Let me run after him.
[00:26:37.859 --> 00:26:38.300]  Bleh!
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:38.860]  Two people.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.520]  You know, one lady gets killed, another one almost does.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.861]  They're like, white supremacist!
[00:26:41.861 --> 00:26:43.081]  White supremacist!
[00:26:43.081 --> 00:26:44.041]  White supremacist!
[00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:45.202]  They're trying to drag him out of the car.
[00:26:45.202 --> 00:26:45.982]  They go, and he's black!
[00:26:46.582 --> 00:26:48.984]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[00:26:48.984 --> 00:26:50.205]  Where did it come from?
[00:26:50.205 --> 00:27:04.859]  Where did it come from?
[00:27:04.859 --> 00:27:07.501]  Where did it come from?
[00:27:07.501 --> 00:27:10.024]  Where did it come from?
[00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:19.361]  We can't survive without pure, clean drinking water.

[00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:11.283]  CNN, USA Today, and other mainstream media fake news outlets came out and said that a new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings standing on top of an American flag is Nazi!
[00:28:11.283 --> 00:28:18.765]  And they had the Soros-funded Snopes groups and others fact-check it and say, yes, now the American flag and yes, the American eagle are Nazi.
[00:28:19.165 --> 00:28:25.852]  No, George Soros that funds Snopes and Media Matters, and the rest of them, he's the real Nazi collaborator.
[00:28:25.852 --> 00:28:28.916]  But, this shirt, I think, is really the perfect campaign shirt.
[00:28:28.916 --> 00:28:31.699]  We've made one even better than what Trump's people came up with.
[00:28:31.699 --> 00:28:36.624]  Two different versions of it, with something even worse, the Betsy Ross flag, our first flag.
[00:28:36.844 --> 00:28:38.486]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:29:07.931 --> 00:29:10.592]  Another world.
[00:29:10.592 --> 00:29:13.434]  Another time.
[00:29:13.434 --> 00:29:14.615]  Another time.
[00:29:14.615 --> 00:29:17.777]  In the age of wonder.
[00:29:17.777 --> 00:29:20.118]  In the age of wonder.
[00:29:20.118 --> 00:29:24.121]  Another world.
[00:29:24.121 --> 00:29:25.261]  Another time.
[00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:27.563]  Another time.
[00:29:27.563 --> 00:29:29.624]  His life was green and good.
[00:29:30.866 --> 00:29:32.969]  Until the crystal cracked.
[00:29:32.969 --> 00:29:37.595]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:29:37.595 --> 00:29:45.885]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29:45.885 --> 00:29:49.270]  Power of our source is the truth, and it will prevail.
[00:29:52.282 --> 00:29:52.923]  All right.
[00:29:52.923 --> 00:29:55.064]  Anybody can just type into a search engine.
[00:29:55.064 --> 00:29:57.306]  Virginia gun rally ends peacefully.
[00:29:57.306 --> 00:29:58.827]  Mother Jones had to admit it.
[00:29:58.827 --> 00:30:00.648]  The Associated Press had to admit it.
[00:30:00.648 --> 00:30:01.809]  The state police estimated 28,000.
[00:30:01.809 --> 00:30:04.891]  I estimated about 40,000 people.
[00:30:04.891 --> 00:30:09.314]  White, black, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, all came out together.
[00:30:09.314 --> 00:30:18.060]  Even though they closed half the Capitol grounds so it wouldn't look like a big crowd, they filled five, six, seven, eight, nine streets in all directions.
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:18.701]  It was amazing.
[00:30:19.785 --> 00:30:24.567]  One arrest of somebody getting in a fist fight who was a leftist.
[00:30:24.567 --> 00:30:28.189]  And it totally freaked the globalists out.
[00:30:28.189 --> 00:30:37.332]  And now they gave you COVID-19, and they say conservatives aren't allowed to have demonstrations, but the left and the communists, they can go out and burn and attack and do what they want.
[00:30:37.332 --> 00:30:41.434]  So, no one hurt, incredibly safe, the left scared to death.
[00:30:41.434 --> 00:30:45.956]  Meanwhile, there are so many stabbings and shootings and murders every day.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:54.145]  Of white people at the hands of whites and blacks saying they deserve it because they're white.
[00:30:54.145 --> 00:30:56.487]  And there are black people that are Trump supporters being murdered.
[00:30:56.487 --> 00:31:02.091]  Another man shot multiple times for holding up a Trump sign in Milwaukee and trying to talk to crowds of people.
[00:31:02.091 --> 00:31:09.697]  And folks thought Trump was so bad, they went and they killed him and left us in the news saying, bring in the federal troops, we're ready to kill you!
[00:31:11.357 --> 00:31:21.100]  And there are people on Twitter saying, we're going to get Jones, bounties for Jones, publicly, who are real people, even though that's soliciting murder.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.360]  Murder for hire.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.920]  They're making their move.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:29.662]  And the Democrat Deep State is saying, you don't submit to us, we'll put you in prison.
[00:31:29.662 --> 00:31:38.084]  When we remove Trump by force, anybody stands with him, including cabinet members, and shows his side, you will be put in prison.
[00:31:39.522 --> 00:31:40.482]  Oh, I feel so safe.
[00:31:40.482 --> 00:31:43.523]  Let me submit to you and put your communist handcuffs on.
[00:31:43.523 --> 00:31:46.283]  I'm sure you'll be real nice once I let you take over.
[00:31:46.283 --> 00:31:50.744]  No, I think it'll be the other way around.
[00:31:50.744 --> 00:31:52.664]  People, oh, Jones, you better watch it.
[00:31:52.664 --> 00:31:53.824]  They could get you.
[00:31:53.824 --> 00:31:54.985]  That's the whole point.
[00:31:54.985 --> 00:31:57.525]  Bowing down to this evil goddess here.
[00:31:57.525 --> 00:32:00.726]  I know InfoWars is under attack.
[00:32:00.726 --> 00:32:02.526]  People say, what do you have your son on air?
[00:32:02.526 --> 00:32:06.047]  I mean, he's three inches taller than me.
[00:32:06.047 --> 00:32:07.087]  He's about to be 18.
[00:32:07.087 --> 00:32:08.027]  He wants to be on air.
[00:32:10.623 --> 00:32:15.127]  About a third of George Washington's troops were like 13, 14 years old.
[00:32:15.127 --> 00:32:19.590]  Since when do we domesticate our children?
[00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:21.292]  Well, you got your son out at these rallies.
[00:32:21.292 --> 00:32:22.473]  He's out at those rallies!
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.022]  And it's everybody thinking they're so smart.
[00:32:27.022 --> 00:32:29.263]  I see all these so-called conservative videos on YouTube.
[00:32:29.263 --> 00:32:32.266]  People send me going, Jones needs to watch himself.
[00:32:32.266 --> 00:32:35.088]  And you know, he shouldn't have his son out there.
[00:32:35.088 --> 00:32:36.249]  Something bad could happen.
[00:32:36.249 --> 00:32:37.810]  Yeah, like a New World Order takeover?
[00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:42.894]  Because we all just keep bending over and trying to keep safe and trying to keep our heads down.
[00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:46.176]  That's not what it is to be an American.
[00:32:46.176 --> 00:32:47.077]  I'm all in.
[00:32:47.077 --> 00:32:48.238]  My son's all in.
[00:32:48.238 --> 00:32:49.919]  I pray for my family every day.
[00:32:49.919 --> 00:32:51.000]  It's in God's hands now.
[00:32:53.365 --> 00:32:57.750]  At least he'll be dying on his feet and not on his knees!
[00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.233]  A thousand deaths!
[00:33:00.233 --> 00:33:08.523]  Do you understand this groveling to the system has conjured the communists and the devil worshippers and the child molesters and all the evil?
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.981]  They think going to everybody's house and death-threatening them.
[00:33:16.981 --> 00:33:19.843]  Tucker Carlson, myself, DHS, all of them.
[00:33:19.843 --> 00:33:23.065]  They think that that will intimidate everybody.
[00:33:23.065 --> 00:33:24.026]  And maybe they're right.
[00:33:24.026 --> 00:33:26.547]  Maybe we're not made of what we were before.
[00:33:26.547 --> 00:33:28.608]  Maybe people think laying down is the way to go.
[00:33:28.608 --> 00:33:32.370]  But I didn't bring that up to act like I'm Billy Badass.
[00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:33.071]  I'm not.
[00:33:33.071 --> 00:33:37.033]  I understand the threat so bad, I better stand up against it.
[00:33:37.033 --> 00:33:38.374]  Rather than wait.
[00:33:38.374 --> 00:33:41.436]  Guys, print me the Alexander Shultz and Edson quote, please.
[00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:42.516]  Oh, how we burned the camps.
[00:33:42.516 --> 00:33:43.517]  I'm going to read that next segment.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.882]  It's about two paragraphs long.
[00:33:46.882 --> 00:33:48.123]  I want the full quote, thank you.
[00:33:48.123 --> 00:33:50.125]  From Gulag Archipelago.
[00:33:50.125 --> 00:33:58.674]  Oh, later how we burned in the camps, wishing we could have done something at the beginning when they started coming for us.
[00:33:58.674 --> 00:34:05.281]  Well, I'm doing everything I can in the information war to shape the battle space, to fix this peacefully.
[00:34:05.281 --> 00:34:08.284]  But if it's war they've been looking for, it's war they're gonna get.
[00:34:09.724 --> 00:34:12.787]  And you make sure, folks, that you don't follow the media's programming.
[00:34:12.787 --> 00:34:16.870]  If a real civil war breaks out, which we're already in the early stages of now, they're igniting it.
[00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:22.375]  You don't go fight anti for trash and people in downtown with morons brainwashed.
[00:34:22.375 --> 00:34:24.477]  It's who sent them.
[00:34:24.477 --> 00:34:27.960]  And they want to come to our houses?
[00:34:33.254 --> 00:34:38.460]  That's why all the real establishment are on private islands hiding out right now, saying for COVID.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.502]  They're not hiding out from COVID.
[00:34:40.502 --> 00:34:44.507]  They're all in New Zealand because this is their communist overthrow.
[00:34:44.507 --> 00:34:45.968]  And they're not going to fight and die.
[00:34:45.968 --> 00:34:50.954]  Well, I assure you, in Kauai and in Tasmania,
[00:34:52.353 --> 00:34:59.698]  And in New Zealand, and in Switzerland, that you're being watched right now by the people that are cooking your food.
[00:34:59.698 --> 00:35:06.783]  And the first thing they're gonna do once it all kicks off is slit your throat ear to ear.
[00:35:06.783 --> 00:35:08.704]  Is bash your brains out.
[00:35:08.704 --> 00:35:14.628]  And they won't be like some uncoordinated leftist.
[00:35:14.628 --> 00:35:17.110]  You're all dead.
[00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:21.053]  So, I would advise you to stop now.
[00:35:23.848 --> 00:35:31.239]  Because the Russians are strong, good, smart people, but they were serfs for 500 years and hadn't had a real revolution yet.
[00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:34.123]  You won't go the way your little commie revolution went.
[00:35:35.546 --> 00:35:40.029]  In Russia, where you got to piss on Christians for 85 years and kill 50 million of them.
[00:35:40.029 --> 00:35:41.610]  It won't go that way.
[00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:49.096]  You dirty, Jacobin, Bolshevik trash and your billionaire owners are all gonna pay.
[00:35:49.096 --> 00:36:00.784]  And when we're done, it may not be me around to see it, we're gonna dig you out of your holes and we're gonna make sure you face trial before you get marched up there.
[00:36:02.506 --> 00:36:21.299]  On that platform, on that gantry, and before the man in that black face hood pulls that lever, and your neck snaps at the bottom of that rope, and you're transported to the dimension of your choosing.
[00:36:21.299 --> 00:36:23.861]  We know what you've chosen, of your father the devil.
[00:36:25.023 --> 00:36:29.307]  So you want your big bloody communist dream!
[00:36:29.307 --> 00:36:30.589]  And you think it's gonna be so great.
[00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:32.651]  You know, the Red Terror was senseless.
[00:36:32.651 --> 00:36:33.952]  They said, why are we killing random people?
[00:36:33.952 --> 00:36:35.594]  And Lenin said, I want terror!
[00:36:35.594 --> 00:36:36.555]  I want fear!
[00:36:36.555 --> 00:36:40.278]  I want total collapse!
[00:36:40.278 --> 00:36:42.581]  And so let's show you some video here.
[00:36:42.581 --> 00:36:43.982]  This is Aurora yesterday.
[00:36:43.982 --> 00:36:45.704]  There's chopper footage on InfoWars.com.
[00:36:45.704 --> 00:36:47.445]  You see the whole thing.
[00:36:47.445 --> 00:36:48.206]  This is from the ground.
[00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:48.727]  Let's play it with audio.
[00:36:51.806 --> 00:36:59.990]  And they just run out on the highway and a car doesn't know what's going on and they shoot the tire out and then shoot their own people!
[00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.531]  Yeah, is everybody okay over there?
[00:37:01.531 --> 00:37:05.712]  Because you're all such heroes fighting Nazis.
[00:37:05.712 --> 00:37:08.434]  They think they're Captain America and they're funded by George Soros.
[00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:12.636]  I mean, imagine, you pull into this...
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.720]  And the person panics.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.920]  Suddenly they're on the highway.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.561]  You see them in the Full Chopper video.
[00:37:17.561 --> 00:37:19.121]  They're beating one car.
[00:37:19.121 --> 00:37:20.581]  And the person goes, this is scary.
[00:37:20.581 --> 00:37:27.022]  I'm not going to stop with a couple thousand people attacking me.
[00:37:27.022 --> 00:37:28.163]  And so they drive on through.
[00:37:28.163 --> 00:37:36.604]  And then they start shooting at them.
[00:37:36.604 --> 00:37:38.124]  Let's go ahead and go to the next clip.
[00:37:38.124 --> 00:37:40.865]  Colorado driver shot in the head by protester.
[00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:45.101]  And he's a local liberal lawyer activist.
[00:37:45.101 --> 00:37:46.702]  Oh, those loving liberal.
[00:37:46.702 --> 00:37:47.943]  He's got this crazy look.
[00:37:47.943 --> 00:37:51.566]  He's being booked on capital murder.
[00:37:51.566 --> 00:37:53.847]  And he just looks like he just won the lottery.
[00:37:53.847 --> 00:37:56.549]  He's got this pride.
[00:37:56.549 --> 00:37:58.891]  He just ran up to a random car.
[00:37:58.891 --> 00:38:01.312]  It was a white guy and he shot him in the head.
[00:38:01.312 --> 00:38:01.753]  Here it is.
[00:38:02.858 --> 00:38:04.359]  He's in a Colorado Springs hospital.
[00:38:04.359 --> 00:38:10.663]  Police say he was shot in the head while passing near a George Floyd protest in Alamosa.
[00:38:10.663 --> 00:38:20.770]  Well, Heather, Alamosa police told me that a 27-year-old defense attorney shot a driver in the head during a protest right here on Main Street last night.
[00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:25.354]  Police say this man, 27-year-old James Marshall, was on the streets protesting.
[00:38:25.354 --> 00:38:27.835]  Look how satisfied he is!
[00:38:27.835 --> 00:38:31.318]  By the way, last time I heard that guy he shot was on live support.
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.141]  Is that person even alive?
[00:38:34.141 --> 00:38:45.646]  And you look at the guy, he's been given a mugshot for capital murder and he looks like he's having an orgasm because he believes he'll be released from prison after the communist overthrow and he'll be in a gulag over you and your family.
[00:38:45.646 --> 00:38:46.846]  Sneak again, boy!
[00:38:46.846 --> 00:38:49.847]  Ain't gonna happen!
[00:38:49.847 --> 00:38:51.108]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:38:54.617 --> 00:38:56.078]  It's Christmas in July.
[00:38:56.078 --> 00:38:57.299]  We ran the sale last year.
[00:38:57.299 --> 00:38:59.061]  It was very, very popular.
[00:38:59.061 --> 00:39:05.346]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election year.
[00:39:05.346 --> 00:39:10.870]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:16.494]  It's the American Eagle, boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross flag.
[00:39:16.494 --> 00:39:19.156]  And the shirts are on sale right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:39:20.277 --> 00:39:26.405]  I got the idea from the Trump campaign of having a similar sort of media called Nazi, which of course it isn't.
[00:39:26.405 --> 00:39:31.051]  And since it's so triggering to the leftists and the globalists, well, we're going to make sure there's even more of these on the streets.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.100]  I think so.
[00:39:54.551 --> 00:39:56.093]  The people are awakening.
[00:39:56.093 --> 00:39:58.816]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[00:39:58.816 --> 00:40:00.878]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[00:40:00.878 --> 00:40:03.241]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[00:40:03.241 --> 00:40:12.611]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai comms especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data.
[00:40:12.871 --> 00:40:21.436]  To be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[00:40:21.436 --> 00:40:28.180]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.600]  In their own words, they admit it.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.023]  Show, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[00:40:34.503 --> 00:40:36.424]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[00:40:36.424 --> 00:40:37.525]  They're Faraday cages.
[00:40:37.525 --> 00:40:39.186]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[00:40:39.186 --> 00:40:41.227]  They work absolutely great.
[00:40:41.227 --> 00:40:50.372]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.
[00:40:50.372 --> 00:40:52.774]  Get yours at InfoWareStore.com today.
[00:40:54.787 --> 00:41:05.597]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history, that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[00:41:05.597 --> 00:41:14.805]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[00:41:15.165 --> 00:41:29.336]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[00:41:29.336 --> 00:41:43.568]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be culled and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[00:41:44.008 --> 00:41:45.690]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:52.379]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[00:41:52.379 --> 00:41:54.141]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[00:42:00.419 --> 00:42:01.100]  Fair.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:01.600]  Wonderful.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:10.407]  Because an all-seeing, all-loving computer that doesn't discriminate is going to decide who gets what resources, who gets what jobs.
[00:42:10.407 --> 00:42:24.078]  But in reality, it's building a post-human world so that you can be made obsolete, domesticated, dumbed down, drugged, distracted, atomized, and then slowly killed.
[00:42:24.078 --> 00:42:26.160]  This is the brave new world.
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.501]  It's the post-human world.
[00:42:28.501 --> 00:42:35.545]  It's the dreaming of the post-human world that Wired Magazine and the Wall Street Journal all tell us about.
[00:42:35.545 --> 00:42:38.727]  Oh, now they tell us our smartphones don't just track our every move.
[00:42:38.727 --> 00:42:44.331]  They're monitoring our psychology and sending it back to a corporate database globally.
[00:42:44.331 --> 00:42:48.453]  You see, the bear trap closed on our lead now.
[00:42:48.453 --> 00:42:54.037]  And the vampire walked out of the bushes and is explaining to us how he's slowly gonna bleed us and destroy us.
[00:42:57.734 --> 00:43:12.943]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:43:12.943 --> 00:43:15.464]  The Civil War isn't coming!
[00:43:15.464 --> 00:43:18.146]  The Civil War's here!
[00:43:18.146 --> 00:43:23.889]  And it's run by the shycoms, the EU, the globalists, Hollywood, the Democratic Party, and all the big banks!
[00:43:25.367 --> 00:43:33.570]  And that's why all the corporations line up and beg, because they want that free fiat money the central banks give them, that's backed up by who?
[00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:37.292]  By you and I, the taxpayers!
[00:43:37.292 --> 00:43:39.513]  That's how it's all centralized.
[00:43:39.513 --> 00:43:41.354]  How the UN runs our medicine.
[00:43:41.354 --> 00:43:43.134]  How the UN runs our schools.
[00:43:43.134 --> 00:43:45.195]  How all its regulations control us.
[00:43:45.195 --> 00:43:46.176]  Who set up the UN?
[00:43:46.176 --> 00:43:52.538]  The Rockefellers, on record!
[00:43:52.538 --> 00:43:53.739]  A giant spider web.
[00:43:54.992 --> 00:43:57.173]  A new world order.
[00:43:57.173 --> 00:43:59.274]  A big idea.
[00:43:59.274 --> 00:44:01.094]  A post-human future.
[00:44:01.094 --> 00:44:07.257]  But to build that nightmare world, the Renaissance and the liberal West must be pulled down.
[00:44:07.257 --> 00:44:14.500]  No better way to destroy true liberalism than to bring in the left-hand path and destroy free, open societies.
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.221]  That's why Soros captains the open society.
[00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:19.002]  Everything with him is an inversion.
[00:44:19.002 --> 00:44:20.962]  It's the closed society.
[00:44:20.962 --> 00:44:22.143]  The poor society.
[00:44:23.083 --> 00:44:31.990]  The society under his and other globalist iron rule because they want to dominate your soul.
[00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:34.572]  They want you to beg for every crime.
[00:44:34.572 --> 00:44:40.917]  They want you to submit to them because they're fallen and ugly and want you to be beneath them.
[00:44:40.917 --> 00:44:42.939]  But you will never be beneath them.
[00:44:42.939 --> 00:44:43.439]  Remember that.
[00:44:43.439 --> 00:44:45.961]  Now let's get into it.
[00:44:46.992 --> 00:44:51.933]  I have countless more videos, but why don't we just show the video, the radio listeners, a few weeks ago.
[00:44:51.933 --> 00:44:58.535]  White supremacist runs over peaceful protester that had run out on the highway, blocked it in a dark area of the road.
[00:44:58.535 --> 00:45:02.476]  Two women, two white women, live streaming, get run over.
[00:45:02.476 --> 00:45:05.616]  They run to attack the guy, start beating his car.
[00:45:05.616 --> 00:45:10.318]  He drives off, they call it a hit and run, until they find out it's a black guy.
[00:45:10.318 --> 00:45:12.098]  And then the whole story got shut down.
[00:45:14.531 --> 00:45:22.157]  But that's what happens here, ladies and gentlemen, when you're out on the highway at 1.30 and somebody that's been out partying comes driving on the road.
[00:45:22.157 --> 00:45:23.538]  And boy, that'd have been a white guy.
[00:45:23.538 --> 00:45:26.040]  Woo!
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.142]  And we'd have pointed out, you know, that it was an accident.
[00:45:28.142 --> 00:45:38.750]  I'd have been sued by a university right there in Seattle, just like I was by Georgetown for pointing out that Soros collided all those people together a few years ago in Virginia.
[00:45:39.622 --> 00:45:42.124]  To create a crisis and one woman got killed.
[00:45:42.124 --> 00:45:46.086]  They're suing me saying I'm saying they actually killed the woman physically themselves.
[00:45:46.086 --> 00:45:47.647]  No, I said, look, a chemistry set.
[00:45:47.647 --> 00:45:52.570]  You set up the collision and then had the police push them together for the crisis.
[00:45:52.570 --> 00:46:00.715]  And the Democrats are now on record saying in the news, we're going to create explosions all over the US to drive Trump from power.
[00:46:00.715 --> 00:46:05.178]  And they bought full page ads in the New York Times.
[00:46:05.178 --> 00:46:07.820]  While they simultaneously have Frontline coming out.
[00:46:09.124 --> 00:46:13.406]  With a multi-series show of complete fiction.
[00:46:13.406 --> 00:46:16.487]  Because I've talked to people that have been involved in the production.
[00:46:16.487 --> 00:46:17.787]  Unbelievable.
[00:46:17.787 --> 00:46:23.390]  They're actually going to say, I'm told, that Russians fund InfoWars.
[00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:25.330]  Wonder how much they had to pay people to say that.
[00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:26.411]  Look at this headline.
[00:46:26.411 --> 00:46:36.015]  United States of Conspiracy examines how three men, Alex Jones, Roger Stone, and President Trump,
[00:46:36.943 --> 00:46:46.332]  Helped to lay the foundation for the conspiracy theories to take center stage in America's national conversation.
[00:46:46.332 --> 00:46:49.895]  And on the front page of their Twitter, front page of Frontline, it's me.
[00:46:49.895 --> 00:46:56.101]  At the evil Austin rallies against compulsory masks.
[00:46:56.101 --> 00:46:58.043]  How horrible we are.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:05.363]  Here, let's roll some footage of them a few weeks ago attacking our armored vehicle while making jokes.
[00:47:05.363 --> 00:47:06.383]  Why do you have an armored vehicle?
[00:47:06.383 --> 00:47:19.352]  Well, if we're going to go downtown and cover all this, and you're going to come up armed with clubs and hammers and guns and then try to bash the windows out, we need to be able to peacefully show how violent and evil you are.
[00:47:19.352 --> 00:47:24.315]  So the media spun this and said we attacked our own vehicle in a false flag.
[00:47:24.315 --> 00:47:26.856]  And then the media said we put fake bullet holes in the window.
[00:47:26.856 --> 00:47:27.997]  No, it was hammer holes.
[00:47:27.997 --> 00:47:28.518]  They did it.
[00:47:28.518 --> 00:47:28.898]  Antifa.
[00:47:30.396 --> 00:47:35.799]  And then they said that we burned down a homeless camp because Antifa isn't violent.
[00:47:35.799 --> 00:47:36.340]  That's right.
[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:41.002]  We burned a homeless camp because we shot the footage of them burning the homeless camp.
[00:47:41.002 --> 00:47:43.664]  Uh-huh.
[00:47:43.664 --> 00:47:47.986]  Talk about being conspiracy theorists, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:47.986 --> 00:47:51.769]  This is how they operate each and every time.
[00:47:51.769 --> 00:47:53.670]  So Schiff has now joined
[00:47:54.824 --> 00:47:59.067]  Pelosi and the former Attorney General Eric Holder and all the rest of them.
[00:47:59.067 --> 00:48:02.429]  Joe Biden saying Trump is a dictator.
[00:48:02.429 --> 00:48:07.492]  The federal police guarding courthouses are Nazis.
[00:48:07.492 --> 00:48:13.555]  Why, everybody's a Nazi now except the real Nazi collaborator, George Soros.
[00:48:13.555 --> 00:48:16.797]  Remember just six months ago they had articles going, Jones is insane.
[00:48:16.797 --> 00:48:18.658]  George Soros is a philanthropist.
[00:48:18.658 --> 00:48:20.900]  He doesn't fund Black Lives Matter or Antifa.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.161]  Now Soros is proud of this.
[00:48:22.161 --> 00:48:24.242]  He's like, I am doubling my funding.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:31.244]  Hundreds of millions of dollars a year to this.
[00:48:31.244 --> 00:48:38.811]  200 million this year so far to Black Lives Matter and Antifa that we know of.
[00:48:38.811 --> 00:48:41.013]  I'm being sued by a Soros-backed suit.
[00:48:41.013 --> 00:48:48.639]  And it says, Jones falsely claims that Soros funded Antifa in Charlottesville.
[00:48:48.639 --> 00:48:52.763]  And it's on the damn record, in his own family name, they gave the money.
[00:48:55.214 --> 00:48:59.355]  I mean, this is next level, ladies, but they don't care.
[00:48:59.355 --> 00:49:00.655]  They don't care.
[00:49:00.655 --> 00:49:14.458]  Because they've got systems that will rout us and they believe shut us down, as if I can't jack into our awesome, incredible supporters and listeners who are loyal to the truth and justice, who will always amplify, as long as they're alive, our message.
[00:49:14.458 --> 00:49:17.239]  And as they try to suppress our message, it only becomes stronger.
[00:49:18.223 --> 00:49:21.928]  Historically, the Streisand effect is active now.
[00:49:21.928 --> 00:49:22.990]  I'm going to give you some good news.
[00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:25.032]  I'm going to hit the Southern news.
[00:49:25.032 --> 00:49:26.414]  I took off six days.
[00:49:26.414 --> 00:49:28.757]  I went to the Florida Panhandle.
[00:49:28.757 --> 00:49:30.440]  Really Southern Alabama, Southern Georgia.
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:31.000]  Great people.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:31.621]  Best part of Florida.
[00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:38.793]  And I was mobbed by black people, mobbed by brown people, mobbed by white people, mobbed, mobbed, mobbed.
[00:49:38.793 --> 00:49:41.195]  Everybody in the South's getting along so good.
[00:49:41.195 --> 00:49:43.996]  Folks in the Northeast really ought to go see how it's done.
[00:49:43.996 --> 00:49:45.477]  And I was just mobbed.
[00:49:45.477 --> 00:49:50.841]  I mean, and people were just, I know people from Brazil I ran into, Mexico that I ran into.
[00:49:50.841 --> 00:49:52.522]  They had loving eyes.
[00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:55.003]  Everybody had loving eyes, was awake, was alive.
[00:49:55.003 --> 00:49:55.744]  I got so many hugs.
[00:49:57.794 --> 00:50:05.719]  And people are just so aware of the whole New World Order and the pedophile rings and the COVID hoax and just all of it.
[00:50:05.719 --> 00:50:10.562]  But still, many of them are nice and are complying because they don't want to ruffle feathers.
[00:50:10.562 --> 00:50:13.604]  No, we have to ruffle feathers and not submit to this tyranny.
[00:50:13.604 --> 00:50:16.766]  Ted Nugent is scheduled to come up.
[00:50:16.766 --> 00:50:18.727]  You know, folks, we are not funded.
[00:50:20.319 --> 00:50:21.840]  By the Russians.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.222]  I have no connections to the Russians.
[00:50:23.222 --> 00:50:25.104]  That's all been completely disproven.
[00:50:25.104 --> 00:50:27.226]  Roger Stone was not convicted for any connection to the Russians.
[00:50:27.226 --> 00:50:31.850]  He was convicted for trying to get Julian Assange on my show.
[00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:32.411]  Literally.
[00:50:32.411 --> 00:50:39.898]  I mean, I was here when Assange wouldn't give us the time of day and he was trying to talk to Randy Credico and I was mad at Assange calling him Hillary Clinton's butt plug.
[00:50:39.898 --> 00:50:41.179]  Remember all that?
[00:50:41.179 --> 00:50:41.640]  I was here.
[00:50:43.356 --> 00:50:52.658]  But imagine saying I am this evil Russian, but by doing that they make me an enemy and they could use CIA money and propaganda to try to shut us down and sue us and do all this.
[00:50:52.658 --> 00:51:04.041]  And Trump's never gotten full control of the COG system and maybe he'll wake up now with 99 days left because Pelosi's on TV saying, I met with COG last week and we've got a plan to forcibly remove him.
[00:51:04.041 --> 00:51:06.501]  The COG's under the President and Congress.
[00:51:06.501 --> 00:51:08.962]  What were you doing in a meeting without the President there, you monster?
[00:51:09.582 --> 00:51:16.544]  They're openly doing that, though, to look confident in front of everybody, so they'll carry out the damn coup!
[00:51:16.544 --> 00:51:23.605]  Well, The Washington Post says, front page, anyone that doesn't submit to us will serve prison time.
[00:51:23.605 --> 00:51:25.726]  Oh, with antifa jail guards?
[00:51:25.726 --> 00:51:30.307]  You know, I think I'll just go ahead and take my chances fighting.
[00:51:30.307 --> 00:51:32.807]  And that's all I'm going to say.
[00:51:32.807 --> 00:51:34.748]  I guess, oh, I said I'd read this.
[00:51:34.748 --> 00:51:38.989]  I've already lost my Alexander Solzhenitsyn quote.
[00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:42.980]  Let me just say this.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:44.782]  We're funded by you.
[00:51:44.782 --> 00:51:46.484]  If you need water filtration, we've got the best.
[00:51:46.484 --> 00:51:47.565]  The best price you're going to find.
[00:51:47.565 --> 00:51:49.267]  Air filtration, best you're going to find.
[00:51:49.267 --> 00:51:53.252]  At the price, you can pay five times more, get something better, but it's a four-stage ion filter.
[00:51:53.252 --> 00:51:54.213]  Loves the pure breeze.
[00:51:54.213 --> 00:51:55.875]  Loves the pure water filters as well.
[00:51:56.929 --> 00:51:58.470]  Everybody needs to be self-sufficient.
[00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:01.291]  Storable Food now is shipping within two to three weeks.
[00:52:01.291 --> 00:52:04.292]  I would get it during this low, if you can call it this, and get it in.
[00:52:04.292 --> 00:52:06.133]  Last 25 years, super high quality.
[00:52:06.133 --> 00:52:08.334]  We have the best at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:52:08.334 --> 00:52:09.595]  Partner with MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:09.595 --> 00:52:11.696]  You get it quickest ordering it from us.
[00:52:11.696 --> 00:52:13.476]  I would take action now on that.
[00:52:13.476 --> 00:52:19.879]  And we have Christmas Comes in July sale that will be ending sometime this week because so many of these items are about to sell out.

[00:52:27.594 --> 00:52:28.395]  I have to.
[00:52:28.395 --> 00:52:31.339]  The free shipping's killing us, and then also all these items are about to sell out.
[00:52:31.339 --> 00:52:34.222]  Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, selling out.
[00:52:34.222 --> 00:52:36.625]  Living Defense, 50% off, selling out.

[00:52:54.624 --> 00:52:56.385]  They're telling me, Alex, you've got to launch the new special.
[00:52:56.385 --> 00:52:57.966]  You've got to launch the new product.
[00:52:57.966 --> 00:53:00.649]  And I've just been too busy to do it, so we're just selling out of all this stuff.
[00:53:00.649 --> 00:53:03.371]  Survival Shield X2 Niacin Iodine Spray.

[00:53:24.889 --> 00:53:26.109]  And so much more.
[00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:27.751]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:53:27.751 --> 00:53:31.574]  Ted Nugent, the governor said, we'll arrest you if you come to New York.
[00:53:31.574 --> 00:53:32.754]  You don't have speech.
[00:53:32.754 --> 00:53:33.595]  He's coming up.
[00:53:33.595 --> 00:53:35.657]  I mean, the commies are making their move.
[00:53:35.657 --> 00:53:36.958]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:53:36.958 --> 00:53:37.958]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:53:37.958 --> 00:53:39.179]  You are the Paul Revere.
[00:53:39.179 --> 00:53:40.620]  Spread the word now.
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:41.061]  Do it!
[00:53:41.061 --> 00:53:42.422]  Tell folks to tune in now!
[00:53:44.332 --> 00:53:49.456]  A lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarestore.com.
[00:53:49.456 --> 00:53:51.077]  You can wear them out to political events.
[00:53:51.077 --> 00:53:52.658]  You can trigger lib darts.
[00:53:52.658 --> 00:53:59.943]  But one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[00:53:59.943 --> 00:54:06.188]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[00:54:06.188 --> 00:54:11.772]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and contact tracing of their openly
[00:54:12.133 --> 00:54:12.453]  I think so.
[00:54:23.351 --> 00:54:27.756]  It's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[00:54:27.756 --> 00:54:31.561]  And the M95 mask only controls what's coming in, not what's going out.
[00:54:31.561 --> 00:54:33.643]  So they quote, spread COVID-19.
[00:54:33.643 --> 00:54:35.125]  They don't protect from it.
[00:54:35.125 --> 00:54:38.089]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back in these control freak spaces.
[00:54:38.089 --> 00:54:40.752]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free.
[00:54:40.752 --> 00:54:41.733]  They're at cost.
[00:54:41.733 --> 00:54:43.155]  Infowarrestore.com.
[00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:47.171]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:15.990]  We're good.
[00:55:47.791 --> 00:55:58.862]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:55:58.862 --> 00:56:00.784]  Folks, we are back live.
[00:56:00.784 --> 00:56:01.925]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:04.148]  Ted Nugent's gonna be calling in in the next five minutes or so.
[00:56:05.401 --> 00:56:11.923]  And if you just heard me mention, oh, the governor said they'll arrest Ted Nugent and this congressman if they come to New York.
[00:56:11.923 --> 00:56:15.504]  It blocks the quarantine, but anti-fuckin'-riot and attack police.
[00:56:15.504 --> 00:56:19.506]  And so they canceled a pro-police rally.
[00:56:19.506 --> 00:56:22.387]  And again, you could go there and, you know, let them come after Ted Nugent.
[00:56:22.387 --> 00:56:26.448]  The point is, is that the organizers shut it down so Ted Nugent didn't go to it.
[00:56:26.448 --> 00:56:28.509]  That's how the communists have us paralyzed.
[00:56:29.735 --> 00:56:30.496]  And that's why the L.A.
[00:56:30.496 --> 00:56:36.620]  Mayor says, oh, it's good of you to protest the police, just no one else can, you know, protest, though, anything else.
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:38.621]  Only communists are allowed to protest.
[00:56:38.621 --> 00:56:41.263]  And they're all just teaching you these major contradictions.
[00:56:41.263 --> 00:56:43.304]  This is done in psych warfare.
[00:56:43.304 --> 00:56:46.246]  This is done to train you to accept garbage.
[00:56:46.246 --> 00:56:48.328]  You're not supposed to like it.
[00:56:48.328 --> 00:56:52.911]  You're supposed to learn to accept it, that it's peaceful to run up to you in a car and shoot you in the head.
[00:56:55.486 --> 00:57:05.101]  Now here's a very powerful report before we go to Ted Nugent since we get him that Gregory's put together called everyone will soon test positive for COVID and it shows all the CDC documents.
[00:57:05.101 --> 00:57:06.022]  Well, just see it for yourself.
[00:57:06.022 --> 00:57:07.425]  This is beyond critical Bandai video.
[00:57:09.955 --> 00:57:16.918]  We know that the prescribed PCR tests are not detecting the COVID-19 genome.
[00:57:16.918 --> 00:57:25.481]  According to the CDC's own literature, the tests do not rule out bacterial infection or other viruses.
[00:57:25.481 --> 00:57:32.723]  They are detecting all varieties of coronavirus, including the common cold, and counting it as COVID-19.
[00:57:34.264 --> 00:57:45.832]  And it has been pointed out for months that the geographical locations experiencing the most cases of COVID also seem to have active 5G technology.
[00:57:45.832 --> 00:57:58.642]  After a video went viral in which David Icke suggested that 5G is somehow responsible for positive cases of COVID-19, YouTube deleted it and began deleting all videos on the subject.
[00:57:59.222 --> 00:58:10.283]  Including a video we made that pointed out how on October 31st of 2019, Wuhan, China became the first major testbed of 5G technology.
[00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:23.219]  In late June, a new scientific research paper entitled, 5G Technology and Induction of Coronavirus in Skin Cells was published.
[00:58:23.219 --> 00:58:31.486]  This paper gives a scientific explanation of the relationship between 5G technology and the coronavirus.
[00:58:31.486 --> 00:58:39.432]  Unlike 4G or other radio waves, the 5G millimeter waves can penetrate the nucleus of a cell.
[00:58:40.433 --> 00:58:43.938]  The DNA then acts as an inductor.
[00:58:43.938 --> 00:58:49.185]  It reacts to the 5G waves by producing an electromagnetic field.
[00:58:49.185 --> 00:58:57.316]  Like a shadow, the shape of the electromagnetic field reflects the hexagonal and pentagonal shapes of the DNA base pairs.
[00:58:58.317 --> 00:59:03.181]  This electromagnetic field produces holes in the cellular liquid.
[00:59:03.181 --> 00:59:07.945]  Hexagonal, pentagonal voids are created in the nucleoplasm.
[00:59:07.945 --> 00:59:13.590]  And to remedy this disturbance, extra bases are created to fill the voids.
[00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:24.299]  These bases then join together to produce coronavirus-like structures within the cell, which the PCR test will read as a positive case of COVID-19.
[00:59:27.785 --> 00:59:29.128]  The exosome.
[00:59:29.128 --> 00:59:31.532]  The exosome was discovered in 1983.
[00:59:31.532 --> 00:59:38.224]  Exosomes are created naturally within the cell to clean and repair cellular damage.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:45.046]  Both exosomes and COVID-19 are the same size and shape.
[00:59:45.046 --> 00:59:51.272]  They both have the same ACE2 receptor and they both contain RNA.
[00:59:51.272 --> 00:59:55.116]  Exosomes behave and appear the same as a virus.
[00:59:55.116 --> 01:00:00.542]  Some scientists even claim that the so-called virus is in fact the exosome.
[01:00:01.972 --> 01:00:13.604]  Since the discovery of the exosome, over 200 microbiologists have been murdered, committed suicide, or died in a suspicious manner.
[01:00:13.604 --> 01:00:18.369]  If you question this mystery, you are undoubtedly labeled a conspiracy theorist.
[01:00:19.778 --> 01:00:26.542]  And if you question the current unproven virus theory, you are labeled a science denier.
[01:00:26.542 --> 01:00:42.390]  The only socially acceptable solution that you are allowed to accept is an experimental vaccine that will alter your DNA, which ultimately raises the question, who owns your body?
[01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:46.393]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:48.474]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[01:00:49.994 --> 01:00:53.395]  Coming up, Ted Nugent!
[01:00:53.395 --> 01:01:05.338]  Another part of the Great Awakening that's taking place is people that haven't even been religious or Christian now see how evil is out in the open, how hundreds of churches have been burned in Europe and the U.S.
[01:01:05.338 --> 01:01:09.039]  Hundreds of Christian icons have been burnt and destroyed.
[01:01:09.039 --> 01:01:13.400]  Jesuses have had their heads cut off all over the country, all over the Philippines, all over Europe.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.421]  Virgin Mary's are getting torn down.
[01:01:15.421 --> 01:01:17.343]  I mean, crosses are being torn down.
[01:01:17.343 --> 01:01:22.527]  It's absolutely out of control, but people now understand that evil was always real.
[01:01:22.527 --> 01:01:23.788]  It is spiritual.
[01:01:23.788 --> 01:01:28.932]  And it was just waiting to make its move, building beneath the surface, and now it's emerged.
[01:01:29.412 --> 01:01:32.213]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it.
[01:01:32.213 --> 01:01:33.294]  I'm praying for America.
[01:01:33.294 --> 01:01:34.174]  I'm praying for you.
[01:01:34.174 --> 01:01:37.315]  And I know the power of prayer is real and God hears it.
[01:01:37.315 --> 01:01:40.316]  We need to come together and pray for an even greater awakening.
[01:01:40.316 --> 01:01:42.717]  Pray for Donald Trump to be protected.
[01:01:42.717 --> 01:01:50.260]  Pray for him to win in a landslide and pray for the people under deception of the globalists to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom.
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:50.940]  God bless you all.
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:52.141]  Please pray for him for us as well.
[01:01:54.491 --> 01:01:59.313]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:01:59.313 --> 01:02:01.014]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:02:01.014 --> 01:02:02.655]  Well, so does he.
[01:02:02.655 --> 01:02:07.357]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:02:08.849 --> 01:02:14.598]  All right, I got a lot of questions for Ted Nugent at this critical time with nine days out from the election on this Sunday, July 26.
[01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:17.462]  Check it out on the live broadcast.
[01:02:17.462 --> 01:02:20.967]  I went to him just during the one minute break and I said, what do you want to hit first?
[01:02:20.967 --> 01:02:24.712]  He said, everything in our lifetimes has been building towards what is happening now.
[01:02:25.814 --> 01:02:27.435]  This is America fighting for its life.
[01:02:27.435 --> 01:02:33.019]  Ted Nugent joins us to talk about a story that I'm reading out of law enforcement today.
[01:02:33.019 --> 01:02:35.400]  And I went and looked at the local news.
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:40.824]  They are proudly announcing that the governor said in New York, you're not allowed to have a pro-police rally.
[01:02:40.824 --> 01:02:42.565]  The state police help, you're fired.
[01:02:42.565 --> 01:02:44.687]  If cops come out, you're fired.
[01:02:44.687 --> 01:02:47.569]  You don't have speech, but the communists, everybody else do.
[01:02:48.129 --> 01:02:54.453]  And you've seen de Blasio on TV saying, oh, communists have rights, but nobody else does, because they're so special.
[01:02:54.453 --> 01:02:56.254]  This is the death of America.
[01:02:56.254 --> 01:02:57.515]  And the headline says it all.
[01:02:57.515 --> 01:02:58.756]  Today we lost America.
[01:02:58.756 --> 01:03:01.238]  And it gets into the situation.
[01:03:01.238 --> 01:03:05.060]  I don't think we've lost America yet, but if we keep living on our laurels, it's over.
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:09.383]  So, the Motor City madman, Ted Nugent, joins us to cover the waterfront.
[01:03:09.383 --> 01:03:10.664]  Thanks for coming on on short notice.
[01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:12.482]  My pleasure, Alex.
[01:03:12.482 --> 01:03:16.224]  I'm here to celebrate the good, but it's not easy to find right now.
[01:03:16.224 --> 01:03:26.809]  There's an awful lot of bad and ugly, but I really get the unique and humbling experience to maximize the good with the best of the best hard-working American families every day of my life.
[01:03:28.542 --> 01:03:42.109]  Returning from New York, where another great family spent a fortune to get me and the good Congressman Clay Higgins to a pro-law enforcement rally, a pro-law and order rally, the biggest one.
[01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:44.450]  It was purported to be the biggest pro-law
[01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:45.451]  We're good to go.
[01:04:07.006 --> 01:04:13.630]  Have destroyed the morale of the law enforcement sheepdog heroes across this country.
[01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:19.312]  Most heartbreakingly, Alex, we witnessed the great heroes of the New York Police Department.
[01:04:19.312 --> 01:04:20.873]  So we were ready to go.
[01:04:20.873 --> 01:04:23.034]  Like I said, my buddy jetted us up there.
[01:04:23.034 --> 01:04:24.635]  I had the guitar and amp.
[01:04:24.635 --> 01:04:25.796]  We had the good congressmen.
[01:04:25.796 --> 01:04:29.898]  We had great, great law enforcement heroes and their families gathering.
[01:04:29.898 --> 01:04:33.660]  And I literally was threatened by Governor Cuomo.
[01:04:36.326 --> 01:05:01.572]  And his hand-picked Marxist Health Department Nazis, that if I set foot in New York to play the national anthem and thank the law enforcement heroes, if I dare enter his communist New York area, I would be put under house arrest and quarantine for 14 days, thereby destroying the only chance
[01:05:02.153 --> 01:05:10.999]  To have a morale boost by the heroes of the NYPD, and boy are they pissed!
[01:05:10.999 --> 01:05:22.467]  And I'm just speechless at this point that he literally says, Communists can march, you can attack the police, they beat up the police commissioner, and the news called it peaceful.
[01:05:22.467 --> 01:05:24.168]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:05:24.168 --> 01:05:30.652]  And then now, you'll be arrested, you'll be placed on house arrest, you'll be kidnapped, if you try to come play the national anthem.
[01:05:30.652 --> 01:05:31.353]  This is next level.
[01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:46.081]  You know, we've known each other a long time, Alex, and we've seen just indescribable, bizarre levels of criminal corruption and abuse of power by every alphabet soup, you know, government bureaucracy.
[01:05:46.081 --> 01:05:49.322]  I mean, who the hell trusts the CDC?
[01:05:49.322 --> 01:05:51.783]  Do you know anybody that trusts the CDC?
[01:05:51.783 --> 01:05:57.766]  How about the James Comey, J. Edgar Hoover, Al Capone FBI punks?
[01:05:58.987 --> 01:06:07.089]  That obeyed an order to have a commando, brown shirt, Gestapo attack on Roger Stone's house?
[01:06:07.089 --> 01:06:07.949]  Really?
[01:06:07.949 --> 01:06:12.530]  You gotta bring machine guns to arrest Roger Stone?
[01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:14.631]  And here's the horror of it.
[01:06:14.631 --> 01:06:24.573]  These soulless, dickless sheep of the FBI obeyed the immoral order.
[01:06:25.228 --> 01:06:26.951]  That's what's frightening.
[01:06:26.951 --> 01:06:28.614]  Now, I know a bunch of guys in the FBI.
[01:06:28.614 --> 01:06:33.022]  In fact, I went up there to New York with some good heroes of the FBI.
[01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:35.366]  And, God, are they pissed off!
[01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:42.555]  So any alphabet soup bureaucracy in the United States government right now, whether it's the IRS... It's just like America.
[01:06:42.555 --> 01:06:43.136]  It's divided.
[01:06:43.136 --> 01:06:46.818]  It's got the America-hating globalist in it that ran the ineptitude against Trump.
[01:06:46.818 --> 01:06:47.959]  Then it's got the good guys.
[01:06:47.959 --> 01:06:53.223]  But the bad guys are getting more and more control, and we've got to route them because they're not Americans.
[01:06:53.223 --> 01:06:56.706]  The Democrats openly now say they don't want the country to exist.
[01:06:56.706 --> 01:06:59.908]  And so law enforcement and everybody else has to decide, which side are you on?
[01:06:59.908 --> 01:07:00.829]  Are you crazy?
[01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:02.030]  They want to bring the country down.
[01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:02.751]  This is insane.
[01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:10.538]  Yeah, you know, there were six bureaucrats, soulless punks, traitors, yet glaringly guilty of treason.
[01:07:10.538 --> 01:07:21.209]  Their names are Kevin Abrahams, Sila Boyne, Kerry Salagas, Deborah Muell, Ellen Burnham, and Arne Drucker.
[01:07:21.209 --> 01:07:22.070]  They signed
[01:07:22.731 --> 01:07:23.572]  A lie.
[01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:26.033]  A hate-stinking lie.
[01:07:26.033 --> 01:07:27.454]  Dig this.
[01:07:27.454 --> 01:07:32.736]  That Ted Nugent is a racist, a homophobe, and an anti-Semite.
[01:07:32.736 --> 01:07:40.300]  You know, I was wondering, Alex, maybe they should have probably talked to some of my black, gay, or Jewish friends before they made those nasty accusations.
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.281]  They know it's all lies.
[01:07:41.281 --> 01:07:43.001]  They're the ones engaging in race-baiting.
[01:07:43.001 --> 01:07:45.083]  Sure, and here's the thing.
[01:07:45.083 --> 01:07:51.426]  What worse thing can a human do to another human than to falsely accuse
[01:07:52.199 --> 01:07:59.991]  And officially make a government document lying with that level of hate, and they're doing it?
[01:08:00.484 --> 01:08:01.945]  With impunity.
[01:08:01.945 --> 01:08:13.170]  And again, you know, Alex, I gotta tell you, my buddy flew me back home and I got out my bow and arrow and my fishing rod and I spent a wonderful couple days with my dogs on my miraculous paradise here in Texas.
[01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:16.252]  So they didn't hurt Ted Nugent at all.
[01:08:16.252 --> 01:08:17.193]  I mean, are you kidding me?
[01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:18.753]  What can they possibly do to me?
[01:08:18.753 --> 01:08:20.054]  And I'll tell you what, nothing.
[01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:21.775]  But you know what they hurt?
[01:08:21.775 --> 01:08:23.796]  They hurt the spirit
[01:08:24.466 --> 01:08:29.648]  And the morale of the New York Police Department heroes and their families.
[01:08:29.648 --> 01:08:31.969]  Well that's the next thing is, they're open season.
[01:08:31.969 --> 01:08:34.189]  The left wants to brutalize the police.
[01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:36.650]  Not to get rid of them, but to take them over.
[01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:40.632]  Can you imagine the left when the Antifa is now going to have the badges and the guns?
[01:08:40.632 --> 01:08:41.612]  Because that's the goal of this.
[01:08:42.227 --> 01:08:56.792]  You know, I gotta tell you, the leader of the Democrat Party has made it perfectly clear, I mean, in between her felonies, you know, you don't need to read this, you need to sign it, that Nancy Pelosi committed a felony on TV ripping up your and my State of the Union address, right there on TV!
[01:08:56.792 --> 01:08:59.112]  And she hasn't been tackled and handcuffed yet.
[01:08:59.112 --> 01:09:00.053]  Historic document, yeah.
[01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:09.356]  The point is, she leading the Democrat Party went into a tirade trying to find value and goodness in MS-13!
[01:09:11.212 --> 01:09:13.454]  She said all God's children.
[01:09:13.454 --> 01:09:26.988]  Alex, what planet are these Democrats and the, by the way, there's no difference between Democrats, Antifa, MS-13, the jihadists, and the Black Lives Matter.
[01:09:26.988 --> 01:09:30.051]  They're all, they're dedicated to destroying
[01:09:30.819 --> 01:09:35.361]  Well that's my next question for you, and we only got you one more segment here, and I appreciate the time on this Sunday.
[01:09:35.361 --> 01:09:51.286]  The Democrats are now saying, Schiff is now saying, Pelosi, all of them, that Trump's a dictator, and that when, if he challenges the election, they say they're going to challenge it regardless, if there's like a 2000 argument, that the Pentagon's going to remove Trump, and that anyone that stands with Trump will quote be put in prison.
[01:09:51.286 --> 01:09:52.767]  That's the Washington Post headline.
[01:09:52.767 --> 01:09:55.427]  So they're now planning a hot coup against the President.
[01:09:55.427 --> 01:09:56.668]  How do you think we counter this?
[01:09:57.489 --> 01:09:59.590]  Well, I hope everybody writes this down.
[01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:00.530]  I gotta come back out.
[01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:01.971]  We gotta repeat this.
[01:10:01.971 --> 01:10:03.471]  Everybody listen.
[01:10:03.471 --> 01:10:06.353]  HuntTheVote.org.
[01:10:06.353 --> 01:10:07.093]  I'll say it again.
[01:10:07.093 --> 01:10:09.854]  HuntTheVote.org.
[01:10:09.854 --> 01:10:11.335]  You don't have to pay any money.
[01:10:11.335 --> 01:10:13.316]  We already got the money behind it.
[01:10:13.316 --> 01:10:21.379]  You need to register and vote if you believe in God, family, country, Constitution, and freedom.
[01:10:21.379 --> 01:10:23.280]  HuntTheVote.org.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:26.301]  And you gotta get a bunch of other people off their butt to vote.
[01:10:27.659 --> 01:10:31.583]  This revolution will be won on November 3rd, 2020.
[01:10:31.583 --> 01:10:33.425]  HuntTheVote.org.
[01:10:33.425 --> 01:10:38.890]  I'm telling you, it sounds ridiculously simple because it is!
[01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:40.491]  HuntTheVote.org.
[01:10:40.491 --> 01:10:43.274]  Just register and get to the front lines!
[01:10:43.274 --> 01:10:44.976]  This is the Alamo!
[01:10:44.976 --> 01:10:47.038]  We need to shoot Santa Ana's men!
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.120]  Absolutely.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:50.800]  We've got to go to break.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:51.621]  We'll do one more segment.
[01:10:51.621 --> 01:10:55.361]  Again, please come back for longer in the week because things are so hot.
[01:10:55.361 --> 01:11:00.263]  With nine days left, we've got 40 seconds to break, but what happens if Trump gets re-elected?
[01:11:00.263 --> 01:11:03.463]  I think he will, but what are they going to do next?
[01:11:03.463 --> 01:11:09.885]  Well, we've seen where the Antifa operates with impunity and Trump is already
[01:11:10.663 --> 01:11:13.184]  Of mobilizing counter-forces.
[01:11:13.184 --> 01:11:26.331]  You know, how dare the President bring in troops and bring back law and order as the Democrat mayors and governors go, no, no, don't stop the arsonists, don't stop the rioters, don't stop the murderers and the assault.
[01:11:26.331 --> 01:11:31.593]  No, Mr. President, you must let them destroy my city.
[01:11:31.593 --> 01:11:34.615]  I don't know how to process that information.
[01:11:34.615 --> 01:11:39.217]  So what's going to happen is that when we once again prove that God, family, country
[01:11:39.978 --> 01:11:46.424]  wins the election on November 3rd, the savages are going to be corralled and put in cages where they belong.
[01:11:46.424 --> 01:11:47.424]  There's going to be a reckoning.
[01:11:47.424 --> 01:11:47.845]  I agree.
[01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:48.645]  Chad Nugent's our guest.
[01:11:48.645 --> 01:11:49.026]  Stay with us.
[01:11:51.178 --> 01:12:02.744]  Vicki Gibbs, 57-year-old lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated, and then died.
[01:12:02.744 --> 01:12:08.067]  And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch, it'll be intubation.
[01:12:08.067 --> 01:12:09.407]  We know what's gonna happen.
[01:12:09.407 --> 01:12:10.828]  It's a blue city.
[01:12:10.828 --> 01:12:12.009]  Same story yet again.
[01:12:12.009 --> 01:12:14.010]  And they say her heart gave out.
[01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:19.853]  If you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record.
[01:12:19.853 --> 01:12:22.575]  I want everyone you know before they go into the hospital and get killed.
[01:12:22.575 --> 01:12:26.177]  Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states?
[01:12:26.177 --> 01:12:33.121]  It's because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs, and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response.
[01:12:33.121 --> 01:12:37.244]  And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying it will kill you.
[01:12:37.904 --> 01:12:42.571]  But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[01:12:42.571 --> 01:12:46.617]  And the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading.
[01:12:46.617 --> 01:12:49.381]  Don't end up like Vicki Gibbs or everyone.
[01:12:51.283 --> 01:12:54.944]  It's time to take a new, healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[01:12:54.944 --> 01:13:02.006]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the Infowars crew use every day for the purest water possible.

[01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:23.471]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.

[01:13:53.027 --> 01:13:55.631]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:14:13.353 --> 01:14:13.713]  We're good.
[01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:34.457]  Well, there is Ted Nugent years ago on Fox News playing with Star Spangled Banner.
[01:14:34.457 --> 01:14:38.060]  Now the NFL's talking about getting rid of it entirely and the American flag's bad.
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:44.566]  Ted Nugent, this is an attempt to overthrow the country and you told me before we went on air that this is the moment of history.
[01:14:44.566 --> 01:14:46.428]  This is the attempt to take down the country.
[01:14:46.428 --> 01:14:47.449]  Can you elaborate on that?
[01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:50.132]  And then you were talking off-air to me about how angry you are about
[01:14:51.107 --> 01:14:51.167]  The
[01:15:22.608 --> 01:15:31.114]  Well, Alex, I think I have a reasonable and accurate overview of what we have here in the United States of America in 2020.
[01:15:31.114 --> 01:15:36.979]  I was born in Detroit in 1948 when it was universally known as the Arsenal of Democracy.
[01:15:36.979 --> 01:15:40.121]  A lot of people don't know that because they went to school in America.
[01:15:40.121 --> 01:15:43.964]  But Detroit was the Arsenal of Democracy!
[01:15:43.964 --> 01:15:48.908]  And the way the Nugent family conducts our life, we continue in our homes to be the Arsenal of Democracy.
[01:15:48.908 --> 01:15:49.628]  But I was there in 67.
[01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:56.558]  When all my buddies, all my black musician friends, we always jam together and collaborate.
[01:15:56.558 --> 01:15:58.340]  We always hung out together.
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:03.607]  And I had friends of every imaginable ethnicity and color and creed and walk of life.
[01:16:03.607 --> 01:16:04.008]  And then in 67,
[01:16:05.583 --> 01:16:07.264]  They burnt down the city.
[01:16:07.264 --> 01:16:12.606]  The rioters went berserk and burnt down their own city, this beautiful architecture.
[01:16:12.606 --> 01:16:19.789]  So I have a good perspective of the goodwill and the positive brotherhood that existed amongst all of us in Detroit.
[01:16:19.789 --> 01:16:25.491]  And then a lunatic fringe segment went nuts, much like precursors to Antipa Ven.
[01:16:25.491 --> 01:16:29.653]  I was in Los Angeles in 92 when the Rodney King verdict came in.
[01:16:29.653 --> 01:16:31.094]  And once again, the idiots
[01:16:31.710 --> 01:16:38.932]  Committed cultural suicide and destroyed their own neighborhoods and lives and viciously attacked and murdered people.
[01:16:38.932 --> 01:16:47.094]  So what I'm seeing today, it breaks my heart to admit, but it's bigger and worse and uglier and more evil.
[01:16:47.094 --> 01:16:54.256]  And it's best presented by the propaganda ministry of the network
[01:16:55.589 --> 01:17:00.193]  News, state, network, television stations, pretty much all of them except Fox.
[01:17:00.193 --> 01:17:04.697]  And Fox is no angel, believe me, but compared to the rest of them, they almost appear to be.
[01:17:04.697 --> 01:17:11.642]  But I watched CBS this morning where they showed, you know, with this harsh accusation against the troops going after rioters.
[01:17:11.642 --> 01:17:14.925]  You know, only they called them peaceful protesters.
[01:17:15.376 --> 01:17:25.323]  Peaceful protesters don't destroy buildings, they don't have Molotov cocktails, they don't kill retired cops, and they don't wear helmets and have weapons on them.
[01:17:25.323 --> 01:17:27.084]  That's not a peaceful protest.
[01:17:27.084 --> 01:17:30.266]  But the way the propaganda ministry twists it,
[01:17:30.706 --> 01:17:49.082]  If you're dumb enough, and if you're stoned or drunk enough, or just mentally deranged enough, I suppose you can buy into that Antifa might actually be anti-fascist when they actually are the fascists, and Black Lives Matter has absolutely nothing to do with black lives!
[01:17:50.714 --> 01:17:56.616]  And by the way, while you're talking, we're showing footage from just two days ago of them burning the outside of the courthouse.
[01:17:56.616 --> 01:17:58.437]  There's even more dramatic footage.
[01:17:58.437 --> 01:17:59.537]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:17:59.537 --> 01:18:06.239]  And I have video after video of them randomly running out on highways and shooting at random vehicles.
[01:18:06.239 --> 01:18:10.961]  I have footage of them jumping on an old lady's car, trying to pull her out of the car in Austin last night.
[01:18:11.181 --> 01:18:13.083]  And the media says this is good.
[01:18:13.083 --> 01:18:16.247]  A bunch of thugs attacking old ladies.
[01:18:16.247 --> 01:18:18.109]  What the hell has happened to the left?
[01:18:18.109 --> 01:18:19.791]  They have gone completely crazy.
[01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:21.113]  Or are they always this nuts?
[01:18:22.418 --> 01:18:33.808]  They've always been this much, but it's reached a new peak because of the tolerance to their escalating danger, their escalating insanity, their escalating corruption, their escalating criminality.
[01:18:33.808 --> 01:18:40.975]  And again, when you've got the Speaker of the House committing felonies on TV and trying to find worth and loving value in MS-13,
[01:18:42.376 --> 01:18:53.559]  That's a green light and an open door to go ahead and be as nasty and rotten and dangerous and evil as you want to be, because the Democrats, we got your back.
[01:18:53.559 --> 01:18:55.599]  Antifa, we're with you.
[01:18:55.599 --> 01:19:04.562]  And if that doggone President Trump tries to stop you from burning down the city, we're going to try to stop him, because we like it when you burn down the city.
[01:19:04.562 --> 01:19:10.383]  And again, what they said about me being a racist and a homophobe and an anti-Semite,
[01:19:11.053 --> 01:19:15.137]  Alex, I've been surrounded by blacks and Jews my entire life.
[01:19:15.137 --> 01:19:16.478]  They own every record company.
[01:19:16.478 --> 01:19:17.379]  They're my producers.
[01:19:17.379 --> 01:19:18.079]  They're my friends.
[01:19:18.079 --> 01:19:19.380]  They're my musicians.
[01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:20.822]  They're my promoters.
[01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:22.763]  They're my bandmates.
[01:19:22.763 --> 01:19:27.868]  It's unbelievable the depth of dishonesty and hate.
[01:19:27.868 --> 01:19:30.390]  And once again, I'm going to read their names up in New York.
[01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:31.231]  They are just
[01:19:31.844 --> 01:19:32.545]  Evil.
[01:19:32.545 --> 01:19:50.886]  Kevin Abrahams and Sila Boyne, Terry Sullivan, Deborah Muell, Ellen Burnham, and Arne Drucker lied and falsely accused me of those nasty conditions while they continue with their support for arson, murder, assault,
[01:19:51.606 --> 01:19:55.248]  Well, last time you were on your wife, she's absolutely right.
[01:20:10.731 --> 01:20:15.813]  In these times, we've got to stay focused and just appreciate God and family and not get too upset.
[01:20:15.813 --> 01:20:22.995]  I get too upset, and I know it upsets you, but at a certain point, those of us that have been upset have been holding back the total takeover.
[01:20:22.995 --> 01:20:29.877]  I think a lot of people that have been on the fence now know that this New World Order takeover, this Communist takeover is real, but they're wondering, what can they do?
[01:20:29.877 --> 01:20:31.178]  Well, go vote.
[01:20:31.178 --> 01:20:32.218]  Register others to vote.
[01:20:32.518 --> 01:20:33.419]  Speak out.
[01:20:33.419 --> 01:20:34.300]  Stand up.
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:35.821]  Run for office locally.
[01:20:35.821 --> 01:20:36.882]  Go to your city council.
[01:20:36.882 --> 01:20:39.024]  Speak out against Antifa and BLM.
[01:20:39.024 --> 01:20:41.286]  All of us have to have our voices heard.
[01:20:41.286 --> 01:20:42.587]  Call into talk radio.
[01:20:42.587 --> 01:20:43.728]  Call into C-SPAN.
[01:20:43.728 --> 01:20:47.611]  Call to your members of Congress and tell them that you support law and order.
[01:20:47.611 --> 01:20:50.994]  It's really just all of us, the silent majority, have to stop being silent.
[01:20:50.994 --> 01:20:52.115]  Is that accurate, Ted Nugent?
[01:20:52.475 --> 01:21:09.356]  That's 100% the dream of the Founding Fathers, that this is an experiment in self-government where every American has a moral and spiritual obligation to be engaged in the process of determining who will represent we the people CONSTITUTIONALLY!
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:24.543]  The pillars of God, family, country, individual freedoms from God, if you don't hammer that home to your elected employees, and if you don't vote for God, family, and country, then the Antifa thinks you're one of them!
[01:21:24.543 --> 01:21:25.783]  That's how nasty it is!
[01:21:25.783 --> 01:21:37.505]  I have a Monday and Thursday night Ted Nugent spirit campfire every week as I broadcast on my Facebook and all over social media, but my God, after this debacle by Cuomo and all the liberal
[01:21:38.667 --> 01:21:44.300]  Uh, Democrat Antifa, MS-13, Black Lives Matter terrorists in New York.
[01:21:45.003 --> 01:21:59.586]  The real heartbreak are those heroes of law enforcement and the NYPD and their families who feel spat upon, who feel bludgeoned by the people in charge because they're the Cuomos and the de Blasios and the Health Department.
[01:21:59.586 --> 01:22:06.867]  And even the upper echelon, the police commissioner and some of the Police Benevolent Association turncoats.
[01:22:06.867 --> 01:22:12.508]  They've turned on the men and women of the NYPD, and it's, Alex, it's in almost every
[01:22:13.939 --> 01:22:14.359]  That's right.
[01:22:14.359 --> 01:22:24.322]  They've sided with the globalist takeover because they think America's done and they've sided with the wrong side and good police officers have to stay in there because they want to run you out.
[01:22:24.322 --> 01:22:25.362]  They want to have a takeover.
[01:22:25.362 --> 01:22:28.623]  TedNugent.com is also a place to find everything Ted Nugent.
[01:22:28.623 --> 01:22:33.464]  Ted, join us soon in the next few weeks as all this develops because there's so much to talk about.
[01:22:33.464 --> 01:22:34.764]  I'm sure you can go on for another hour.
[01:22:34.764 --> 01:22:36.965]  Thank you so much and say hi to your family for me.
[01:22:36.965 --> 01:22:37.305]  Thanks.
[01:22:37.305 --> 01:22:39.146]  HuntTheVote.org everybody.
[01:22:39.146 --> 01:22:40.246]  God bless real America.
[01:22:40.615 --> 01:22:41.255]  God bless you.
[01:22:41.255 --> 01:22:42.535]  There goes Ted Nugent.
[01:22:42.535 --> 01:22:44.456]  Banned from New York by Cuomo.
[01:22:44.456 --> 01:22:48.577]  But Commies and Antifa, they can do whatever the hell they want.
[01:22:48.577 --> 01:23:03.940]  We are selling more privacy pockets a day than we were previously selling in a month because of the Clinton Foundation running the contact tracing, and admittedly with Google and Apple tracking all Americans on their phones, even if you hopped out of it or get rid of the apps.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:19.112]  People realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and selling your data and using it to control your life, sharing it with Antifa, sharing it with Black Lives Matter, sharing it with the deep state to oppress not just high-profile people, but the general public.
[01:23:19.112 --> 01:23:30.761]  That's why folks are taking back control of their lives with these little Faraday cages that you can put your cell phones in that knock out the ability of the cell towers to ping it every few seconds and track your location.
[01:23:31.021 --> 01:23:36.566]  This is the only way to have your privacy, and people are taking their privacy back, and it's very, very exciting.

[01:25:51.564 --> 01:25:54.168]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:26:06.266 --> 01:26:08.407]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:26:08.407 --> 01:26:14.970]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:26:14.970 --> 01:26:23.694]  Can you believe how we've been trained to not leave our houses when we're told, wear a mask even though it's all a fraud?
[01:26:23.694 --> 01:26:30.537]  And then I was watching a Joe Rogan clip yesterday, because it was all over the news, Joe Rogan's moving to Texas.
[01:26:30.537 --> 01:26:33.238]  You know, I told you that a couple months ago, remember?
[01:26:33.238 --> 01:26:35.579]  And of course, Joe won't say where he's moving in Texas.
[01:26:38.137 --> 01:26:42.738]  He's, I guess, lengthening out the announcement that he's already moved to Texas.
[01:26:42.738 --> 01:26:45.878]  But, oh wait, I'm just joking.
[01:26:45.878 --> 01:26:49.199]  And I wonder where he moved in Texas.
[01:26:49.199 --> 01:26:56.100]  But, uh, I don't know, Spotify went completely crazy when Joe told me I could say all that stuff.
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:27:02.741]  Then I kind of elaborated on it and kind of added some hyperbole, probably.
[01:27:02.741 --> 01:27:07.242]  Because, you know, I took what Joe said as, wow, he's standing up to YouTube, standing up to censors.
[01:27:08.746 --> 01:27:20.569]  You know, the stuff he told me, but I'm not going to pontificate on that right now, because it's part of a larger story that I want to hit at the start of the next segment.
[01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:28.971]  But I will play the clip of Joe talking about moving to Texas, because then he and his guests talk about, you know, is COVID really bad?
[01:27:28.971 --> 01:27:33.192]  And the New York Times guy's like, oh, Texas is now wearing masks because they figured out they were wrong.
[01:27:33.192 --> 01:27:34.392]  It's really bad.
[01:27:34.392 --> 01:27:38.033]  No, there are past laws with $2,000 fines in places like Austin, if you know.
[01:27:39.073 --> 01:27:49.400]  People are also online going, why does Jones sell a COVID mask with InfoWars on it if he doesn't think it's real?
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.901]  Well, A, I do believe it's real.
[01:27:50.901 --> 01:27:51.962]  We pioneered exposing it.
[01:27:51.962 --> 01:27:53.343]  It was man-made.
[01:27:53.343 --> 01:27:56.545]  It's meant to infect everyone so you can all be suspect.
[01:27:56.545 --> 01:27:59.868]  And so Bill Gates can patent a vaccine to bring you.
[01:27:59.868 --> 01:28:02.169]  And that's all being confirmed now.
[01:28:02.169 --> 01:28:05.672]  And if you've got to wear the mask, have an InfoWars.com on it.
[01:28:06.983 --> 01:28:13.985]  So you can educate people and use their own suppression they're using against you on them.
[01:28:13.985 --> 01:28:30.269]  But the reason I'm kicking this to the last segment is I forgot to tell the great crew that's been putting up with me tonight to find some clips of Sharia police in Saudi Arabia or in Iran, Shiite and Sunni.
[01:28:30.269 --> 01:28:33.330]  There's footage everywhere of Burqa police.
[01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:38.837]  Or hijab police arresting women that aren't wearing face coverings.
[01:28:38.837 --> 01:28:44.582]  And then we've got footage of people being arrested or ticketed for not wearing masks or not wearing it correctly.
[01:28:44.582 --> 01:28:49.265]  There's always more, more, more they want to get your submissions.
[01:28:49.265 --> 01:28:55.730]  So, literally, Fauci is the hijab burqa police.
[01:28:55.730 --> 01:29:02.215]  So we'll get some of those clips together and then I'll respond to what Joe Rogan's guest had to say coming up next segment.
[01:29:03.943 --> 01:29:05.204]  Joe is bucking the mask.
[01:29:05.204 --> 01:29:07.225]  He knows it's a bunch of bull.
[01:29:07.225 --> 01:29:11.387]  He knows the virus is way overblown.
[01:29:11.387 --> 01:29:15.690]  Had a long talk with him a few weeks ago, but I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:29:15.690 --> 01:29:19.632]  But Joe is very influential, and so I'd like to educate his listeners.
[01:29:19.632 --> 01:29:26.296]  And when we do respond to Joe, things on the show that goes viral, and so I can kind of piggyback on there and educate some people before it's too late.
[01:29:26.296 --> 01:29:28.077]  So that's coming up next segment.
[01:29:28.077 --> 01:29:30.298]  But let me hit this right now since I said I would do it.
[01:29:32.915 --> 01:29:41.462]  And maybe we'll take this little clip and put it at the end of the segment when we put out the last segment of the last hour where I was talking about this.
[01:29:41.462 --> 01:29:56.074]  Alexander Sholtson Easton was sent for many, many years to a frozen slave camp, what he called the Gulag Archipelago and the little islands all across the frozen tundra landscape.
[01:29:56.074 --> 01:30:01.198]  And he came out and wrote a best-selling book titled Gulag
[01:30:02.426 --> 01:30:05.968]  Archipelago.
[01:30:05.968 --> 01:30:15.351]  And here is a quote from the Google Archipelago 1918 to 1956.
[01:30:15.351 --> 01:30:19.073]  And how we burned in the camps later.
[01:30:19.073 --> 01:30:28.137]  Thinking what would things have been like if every security operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he would return alive.
[01:30:29.028 --> 01:30:29.228]  I think?
[01:30:38.752 --> 01:31:00.609]  People had not simply sat there in their lairs, pawling with terror at every bang on the downstairs door, at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else they had.
[01:31:00.609 --> 01:31:01.190]  The organs
[01:31:02.366 --> 01:31:14.358]  would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the curse machine would have ground to a halt.
[01:31:14.358 --> 01:31:25.830]  If, if we didn't love freedom enough, and even more, we had no awareness of the real situation, we purely and simply deserve everything that happened afterward.
[01:31:30.532 --> 01:31:34.715]  Now, that's when the commies came in and took over the government with rioters and burning.
[01:31:34.715 --> 01:31:37.197]  And then they got the government, the police, the military to capitulate.
[01:31:37.197 --> 01:31:39.959]  Okay, you're the boss!
[01:31:39.959 --> 01:31:41.199]  And then they took over Moscow.
[01:31:41.199 --> 01:31:44.202]  It took them two years to take over, really five years the rest of the country.
[01:31:44.202 --> 01:31:46.463]  And then they just started raping and killing and murdering.
[01:31:46.463 --> 01:31:50.346]  And they're modeling all of it off of this and what Mao did in China.
[01:31:53.058 --> 01:31:58.421]  And Kim Jong-un and his father and grandfather, they set up the same system.
[01:31:58.421 --> 01:32:01.302]  And Xi Jinping denounced his own father.
[01:32:01.302 --> 01:32:04.404]  His sister was beaten to death in front of him by a youth brigade.
[01:32:04.404 --> 01:32:06.605]  He praised it.
[01:32:06.605 --> 01:32:15.409]  And so now he runs the country because he literally sacrificed his family, who were good people, for nothing to worship communism.
[01:32:18.663 --> 01:32:21.545]  Because his father had been a communist and helped get them in power.
[01:32:21.545 --> 01:32:22.787]  He was like the number three in the government.
[01:32:22.787 --> 01:32:24.608]  But he said, let's not murder all the farmers.
[01:32:24.608 --> 01:32:26.350]  Let's not kill the family.
[01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:31.434]  And Mao Zedong said, I'm taking orders from the Rockefellers.
[01:32:31.434 --> 01:32:33.916]  We're going to kill a large portion of our people.
[01:32:33.916 --> 01:32:36.058]  That's the deal.
[01:32:36.058 --> 01:32:37.479]  And so you know the rest of the story.
[01:32:37.479 --> 01:32:37.980]  And now G.G.
[01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:40.582]  Pink sits on top of it because he's one evil monster.
[01:32:42.213 --> 01:32:48.374]  He took part multiple times in pilloring his father after he spent a decade in a forced labor camp.
[01:32:48.374 --> 01:32:51.835]  And they would do public humiliations when his father came back.
[01:32:51.835 --> 01:32:55.776]  And Xi Jinping would scream and yell and throw things at his father in front of everyone.
[01:32:55.776 --> 01:33:00.257]  And the little 12-year-old girls would run up and spit on him and throw rocks on him.
[01:33:00.257 --> 01:33:04.618]  And Xi Jinping would sit there and denounce his father.
[01:33:04.618 --> 01:33:08.458]  That's the type of trash.
[01:33:08.458 --> 01:33:09.439]  That's Xi Jinping.
[01:33:09.439 --> 01:33:11.179]  He lives on his knees to Satan.
[01:33:12.182 --> 01:33:20.608]  And so he's rewarded with being able to kill his own people en masse and spin up that virus with Fauci and all the rest of it.
[01:33:20.608 --> 01:33:30.395]  So when we come back, I'm going to respond to what's really going on with the mask and the hijab.
[01:33:30.395 --> 01:33:34.818]  Because that's all any of this is, is a burqa.
[01:33:34.818 --> 01:33:35.919]  And this is a submission.
[01:33:35.919 --> 01:33:36.779]  What does Islam mean?
[01:33:36.779 --> 01:33:37.220]  Submission.
[01:33:38.914 --> 01:33:41.776]  Separately, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a solution to tyranny.
[01:33:41.776 --> 01:33:45.619]  It's only one part of the overall solution, and it funds the InfoWarp.
[01:33:45.619 --> 01:33:50.442]  These privacy pockets I have are almost 100% effective.
[01:33:50.442 --> 01:33:51.142]  We've tested them out.
[01:33:51.142 --> 01:33:52.743]  They're one of the best units out there.
[01:33:52.743 --> 01:33:59.808]  Sometimes right up next to a cell tower, it'll still penetrate through and be able to ping your cell phone, track your location, and steal your data.
[01:33:59.808 --> 01:34:00.829]  Stop Bill Clinton.
[01:34:02.344 --> 01:34:14.189]  And Hillary Clinton and their global initiative with the NIH and the UNWHO running the contact tracers or beta testing in blue cities that are going to come with forced inoculations as early as next year.
[01:34:14.189 --> 01:34:15.310]  They've already got your data.
[01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:18.071]  The apps are already on your phone whether you take them off or not.
[01:34:18.071 --> 01:34:21.453]  Google and Apple admit they're doing it together four months ago.
[01:34:21.453 --> 01:34:22.913]  Everything is tracked.
[01:34:22.913 --> 01:34:26.635]  And so when you put your phone in this, it's a way to control it.
[01:34:26.635 --> 01:34:28.696]  It's a way to not let it run your life.
[01:34:30.069 --> 01:34:33.453]  It's a way to not let it dominate you, and it slips right in your pocket.
[01:34:33.453 --> 01:34:35.275]  It's a thin Faraday cage.
[01:34:35.275 --> 01:34:38.718]  They have units out there that are similar to this one or the same unit.
[01:34:38.718 --> 01:34:41.501]  They're selling for $35 online.
[01:34:41.501 --> 01:34:45.786]  Amazon sells them for like $22, and you know they always try to have the lowest price.
[01:34:45.786 --> 01:34:46.126]  $19.95.
[01:34:46.126 --> 01:34:47.488]  These cost us almost $12 a piece.
[01:34:48.956 --> 01:34:50.798]  So the eight bucks comes in to fund our operation.
[01:34:50.798 --> 01:34:55.443]  But I want you to get these and get in the habit to think about how evil these cell phones are.
[01:34:55.443 --> 01:34:59.066]  Now they're Trojan horses and how they literally spy on us and control us.
[01:34:59.066 --> 01:35:03.691]  And then start thinking about the features and the functions and how even when you turn off the tracking, it's still doing it.
[01:35:03.691 --> 01:35:04.612]  That's admitted.
[01:35:04.612 --> 01:35:09.837]  So you take control, except when you want to use the phone or take photos or do something, then it makes you think about
[01:35:10.692 --> 01:35:11.512]  I'm being tracked.
[01:35:11.512 --> 01:35:12.753]  I'm being controlled.
[01:35:12.753 --> 01:35:13.714]  They lied to me about that.
[01:35:13.714 --> 01:35:15.074]  They now admit it.
[01:35:15.074 --> 01:35:15.895]  Give it to your children.
[01:35:15.895 --> 01:35:16.855]  Give it to your wife, your husband.
[01:35:16.855 --> 01:35:17.936]  Give them people your work.
[01:35:17.936 --> 01:35:24.599]  And say, hey, when you want to be tracked and followed and when you want to have location services on, you go ahead and take it out of the bag.
[01:35:24.599 --> 01:35:29.122]  But when you want to take control of Big Brother and at least take some ground back from the enemy,
[01:35:30.854 --> 01:35:34.800]  You put the cell phone in the prison it needs to be in, in the Phantom Zone.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:39.106]  Infowarsstore.com, the best price, the highest quality units.
[01:35:39.106 --> 01:35:40.408]  $19.95 with your privacy pockets.
[01:35:40.408 --> 01:35:41.410]  We'll be right back.
[01:35:41.410 --> 01:35:41.850]  Stay with us.
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:36:03.806]  CNN, USA Today, and other mainstream media fake news outlets came out and said that a new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings standing on top of an American flag is Nazi!
[01:36:03.806 --> 01:36:11.669]  And they had the Soros-funded Snopes groups and others fact-check it and say, yes, now the American flag and yes, the American eagle are Nazis.
[01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:13.910]  No, George Soros that funds Snopes
[01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.330]  I think so.
[01:36:47.179 --> 01:36:50.802]  Ultra 12 is already our overall number one bestseller.
[01:36:50.802 --> 01:37:04.193]  Ultra 12 is twice as strong as Secret 12 for an even lower price because I signed a huge multi-year contract to guarantee to buy a ton of it and my bet ended up to be successful so far.
[01:37:04.773 --> 01:37:06.855]  Folks are ordering it in mass.
[01:37:06.855 --> 01:37:08.436]  They're getting great responses.
[01:37:08.436 --> 01:37:15.721]  They're giving us incredible reviews because we know what vitamin B12 of this type does, taken out of the tongue, where it's more absorbable.
[01:37:15.721 --> 01:37:21.646]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, help the body produce more energy.
[01:37:21.906 --> 01:37:26.909]  Help produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function and so much more.
[01:37:26.909 --> 01:37:33.753]  You can take all the energy drinks and they won't do anything if you don't have the basics already in your body, like vitamin B12.
[01:37:33.753 --> 01:37:42.077]  Whether you're old, whether you're young, whether you're black, whether you're white, whether you live in Japan or the United States, Ultra 12 is the best vitamin B12 you're going to find out there.
[01:37:42.077 --> 01:37:46.360]  It's uber absorbable and it's 50% off right now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:37:48.459 --> 01:37:56.649]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[01:37:57.935 --> 01:38:02.679]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[01:38:02.679 --> 01:38:05.021]  Super Male Vitality!

[01:38:25.018 --> 01:38:25.719]  Yes.

[01:38:30.622 --> 01:38:37.367]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[01:38:37.367 --> 01:38:38.608]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:38:38.608 --> 01:38:40.450]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[01:38:40.450 --> 01:38:43.272]  Never been a better time than right now.
[01:38:43.272 --> 01:38:46.775]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com
[01:38:50.061 --> 01:38:56.368]  About 24 years ago, I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors, producers, actors.
[01:38:56.368 --> 01:38:59.992]  They wanted to meet with me and they said, what is your formal education?
[01:38:59.992 --> 01:39:02.134]  And I said, well, really nothing but a few years of college.
[01:39:02.134 --> 01:39:08.000]  They said, well, how are you one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard?
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:12.541]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable.
[01:39:12.541 --> 01:39:13.521]  We'd like you to be in movies.
[01:39:13.521 --> 01:39:14.781]  We'd like you to write with us.
[01:39:14.781 --> 01:39:16.682]  We'd like you to do voiceovers.
[01:39:16.682 --> 01:39:17.862]  You're just a renaissance man.
[01:39:17.862 --> 01:39:21.543]  And folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer makes statements like that and a lot of others.
[01:39:21.543 --> 01:39:22.843]  I'm not bragging.
[01:39:22.843 --> 01:39:23.904]  And I kept explaining to them.
[01:39:23.904 --> 01:39:25.844]  I said, do you understand?
[01:39:25.844 --> 01:39:27.965]  I didn't come up with any of this.
[01:39:27.965 --> 01:39:32.286]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents.
[01:39:32.286 --> 01:39:35.226]  And they would just laugh at me and say, oh, no way.
[01:39:35.226 --> 01:39:37.007]  Then I would give them the documents.
[01:39:37.007 --> 01:39:38.247]  They would get very, very scared.
[01:39:38.592 --> 01:39:42.675]  You know, the next time I saw him in a few months, I'd say, man, you're right, this is dystopic.
[01:39:42.675 --> 01:39:45.397]  Folks, I didn't make any of this up, okay?
[01:39:45.397 --> 01:39:51.042]  It's real, it's real.
[01:39:51.042 --> 01:39:53.704]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:40:16.252 --> 01:40:16.993]  Welcome back!
[01:40:16.993 --> 01:40:22.116]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[01:40:22.116 --> 01:40:24.197]  Here's the Zero Hedge headline.
[01:40:24.197 --> 01:40:26.499]  The Exodus Begins!
[01:40:26.499 --> 01:40:28.200]  Well, it actually began a long time ago.
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:36.085]  Joe Rogan is leaving LA for Texas, and he's already here, because he wants a little bit more freedom.
[01:40:36.085 --> 01:40:40.388]  He had a New York Times writer on, and they discussed it, then they got into wearing masks.
[01:40:40.388 --> 01:40:41.729]  It all ties together.
[01:40:41.729 --> 01:40:44.751]  I'm gonna get into that right now.
[01:40:44.751 --> 01:40:44.871]  But
[01:40:45.816 --> 01:40:46.836]  Think about this.
[01:40:46.836 --> 01:40:57.779]  In Iran, in Saudi Arabia, in Sudan, in more than 20 countries, women have to fully cover their faces and wear burqas, full beekeeper suits.
[01:40:57.779 --> 01:41:04.141]  In the other countries, they have to partially cover themselves up because, you know, a woman showing herself as very evil if another man sees it.
[01:41:04.801 --> 01:41:12.964]  Now they have a movement in Iran where women take them off and they get arrested, they even get shot, they even get killed.
[01:41:12.964 --> 01:41:14.705]  But see, that's because a woman's dirty, she's bad.
[01:41:14.705 --> 01:41:16.365]  She deserves it, I guess, under Sharia law.
[01:41:16.365 --> 01:41:25.469]  The left thinks that's really fashionable and cool and all these big leftist stores, you show hijabs and the burkinis where women cover up their whole bodies to go swimming.
[01:41:25.469 --> 01:41:28.790]  But now, because we're all dirty and could have the evil COVID,
[01:41:30.615 --> 01:41:44.983]  We all have to cover ourselves because Fauci, who's been wrong about everything and totally lied to us, he says so, and because the head of the UN says it's only getting worse, it's never getting better.
[01:41:44.983 --> 01:41:56.009]  So that's where all this is going, and police are brutalizing people in New York and places like Miami, Florida, all leftist areas, if they don't wear their new little sign of submission.
[01:41:56.009 --> 01:41:58.070]  Islam means submission.
[01:41:59.855 --> 01:42:13.341]  Well, I'm not submitting to Islam or to the NIH or any of this, but you know the WHO head is a communist islamicist on top of it and they know this is a sign of total control and slavery.
[01:42:13.341 --> 01:42:13.842]  So, boy!
[01:42:14.741 --> 01:42:16.582]  Never thought it'd come here.
[01:42:16.582 --> 01:42:18.643]  Now they're saying the masks are basically permanent.
[01:42:18.643 --> 01:42:22.084]  I played that clip in a special Saturday show, but you can pull it up.
[01:42:22.084 --> 01:42:25.306]  WHO head says lockdown will never end.
[01:42:25.306 --> 01:42:28.207]  Props said Fauci'd have us shut down for years.
[01:42:28.207 --> 01:42:31.689]  He said 2.5 million would be dead.
[01:42:31.689 --> 01:42:32.649]  It's 150,000.
[01:42:32.649 --> 01:42:34.230]  Most of them died of other diseases.
[01:42:34.230 --> 01:42:36.131]  I heard a five-year-old died.
[01:42:36.131 --> 01:42:37.091]  My wife was sitting there.
[01:42:37.091 --> 01:42:38.011]  I said, let me guess.
[01:42:38.011 --> 01:42:39.232]  It says he had underlying conditions.
[01:42:39.232 --> 01:42:39.672]  Yeah.
[01:42:39.672 --> 01:42:41.193]  It says multiple underlying conditions.
[01:42:43.985 --> 01:42:45.706]  Then you test false positive.
[01:42:45.706 --> 01:42:47.807]  Most of them are false positive.
[01:42:47.807 --> 01:42:48.447]  It's incredible.
[01:42:48.447 --> 01:42:49.528]  So we have to challenge this.
[01:42:49.528 --> 01:42:51.348]  But here is the mask Nazi.
[01:42:51.348 --> 01:42:52.689]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:42:52.689 --> 01:43:00.193]  Woman, Macy's couple with their children not wearing masks while eating at a park.
[01:43:00.193 --> 01:43:05.635]  I've been in restaurants in Austin now where women come in in hijabs and they're eating spaghetti under it like this.
[01:43:05.635 --> 01:43:06.676]  What a clown show!
[01:43:06.676 --> 01:43:11.318]  But now there's a crazy woman at a park in San Diego, a good liberal, where they submit
[01:43:12.506 --> 01:43:14.824]  This is what she did to the family, daring to go outside.
[01:43:14.824 --> 01:43:15.106]  Here it is.
[01:43:20.448 --> 01:43:24.631]  What are you doing?
[01:43:24.631 --> 01:43:27.913]  You cannot be serious.
[01:43:27.913 --> 01:43:29.094]  You just mazed him.
[01:43:29.094 --> 01:43:32.217]  You just mazed him.
[01:43:32.217 --> 01:43:33.858]  You just mazed him.
[01:43:33.858 --> 01:43:37.020]  You just mazed him and their food because you disagree.
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:38.661]  Don't worry, I'm videotaping.
[01:43:38.661 --> 01:43:39.162]  Don't worry.
[01:43:39.162 --> 01:43:40.282]  I'm not going to videotape you.
[01:43:40.282 --> 01:43:41.163]  This is not fair.
[01:43:41.163 --> 01:43:41.443]  Not okay.
[01:43:46.787 --> 01:43:48.308]  What's wrong with you, lady?
[01:43:48.308 --> 01:43:50.128]  She makes my kids.
[01:43:50.128 --> 01:43:51.028]  You're getting your ass beat.
[01:43:51.028 --> 01:43:52.089]  I don't care who you are.
[01:43:52.089 --> 01:43:54.389]  It's okay, guys.
[01:43:54.389 --> 01:43:55.430]  They want that power.
[01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:56.350]  They want that control.
[01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:58.711]  Don't worry, I got it.
[01:43:58.711 --> 01:44:01.232]  You weren't defending yourself, lady, and I've got this.
[01:44:01.232 --> 01:44:03.192]  Did she hurt her?
[01:44:03.192 --> 01:44:03.993]  I didn't do anything.
[01:44:03.993 --> 01:44:10.455]  But see, they say you're bad, you're all suspect, and so they're going to come literally spray your food like the Wicked Witch.
[01:44:10.455 --> 01:44:11.455]  She's hiked her leg on you.
[01:44:12.810 --> 01:44:13.790]  Now, let's shift gears.
[01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:20.753]  Joe Rogan had Joe Decina of the New York Times on, and he's talking about, I'm coming to Texas.
[01:44:20.753 --> 01:44:24.394]  I heard Davy Crockett's coming to Texas sometime too.
[01:44:24.394 --> 01:44:26.795]  I think he already got there, sorry.
[01:44:26.795 --> 01:44:32.577]  And then they get into, oh, Texans are wearing their masks now.
[01:44:32.577 --> 01:44:34.918]  Well, yeah, in Austin, because it's basically LA.
[01:44:36.803 --> 01:44:39.666]  And there's $2,000 fines if a business doesn't have people do it.
[01:44:39.666 --> 01:44:40.607]  $500 for citizens.
[01:44:40.607 --> 01:44:41.909]  Totally unconstitutional.
[01:44:41.909 --> 01:44:46.734]  It's got medical waivers in there, but nobody tells you that if you say you have anxiety or whatever.
[01:44:46.734 --> 01:44:47.795]  It's totally ineffective.
[01:44:47.795 --> 01:44:49.096]  All the studies show it.
[01:44:49.096 --> 01:44:53.021]  But notice the New York Times guy goes, oh, Texas got reality.
[01:44:53.021 --> 01:44:54.342]  Texas figured it out.
[01:44:55.325 --> 01:44:57.727]  And they're wearing their masks now, because it's so serious.
[01:44:57.727 --> 01:45:00.050]  You mean they're doing 100 times the testing?
[01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:01.511]  And the tests are fraudulent on record?
[01:45:01.511 --> 01:45:05.035]  I played a report earlier where the CDC admits it's not COVID.
[01:45:05.035 --> 01:45:08.398]  It's any type of viral or bacterial infection, and now CNN picks it up?
[01:45:08.398 --> 01:45:09.700]  The test is a fraud!
[01:45:11.834 --> 01:45:13.495]  But we just barrel forward with it.
[01:45:13.495 --> 01:45:16.077]  They're counting people that died of other things in it.
[01:45:16.077 --> 01:45:18.659]  It's 20-something times less than what they said would die.
[01:45:18.659 --> 01:45:20.441]  But notice, it's never ending though.
[01:45:20.441 --> 01:45:21.742]  It's not the 15 days.
[01:45:21.742 --> 01:45:23.123]  The hospitals weren't filled.
[01:45:23.123 --> 01:45:24.123]  It's forever.
[01:45:24.123 --> 01:45:27.306]  Because once you let a group take over like this, they never turn loose.
[01:45:27.306 --> 01:45:29.107]  We have a medical global tyranny.
[01:45:29.107 --> 01:45:30.288]  This is the U.N.
[01:45:30.288 --> 01:45:31.429]  running this.
[01:45:31.429 --> 01:45:33.130]  Telling us we must follow what the U.N.
[01:45:33.130 --> 01:45:33.671]  says.
[01:45:33.671 --> 01:45:34.972]  Oh, that's not W.H.O.
[01:45:34.972 --> 01:45:37.474]  approved.
[01:45:37.474 --> 01:45:38.875]  A communist.
[01:45:38.875 --> 01:45:39.976]  The guy that heads up the W.H.O.
[01:45:39.976 --> 01:45:41.437]  is an admitted communist.
[01:45:43.629 --> 01:45:46.633]  Bill Gates is financing it all on record!
[01:45:46.633 --> 01:45:51.560]  I'll show you something after this Joe Rogan clip, but here, let's go ahead and roll the clip with Joe talking about he's coming to Texas.
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:52.461]  Here it is.
[01:45:52.461 --> 01:45:52.921]  And what's the story?
[01:45:52.921 --> 01:45:54.063]  Are you moving?
[01:45:54.063 --> 01:45:55.064]  I'm out of here.
[01:45:55.064 --> 01:45:55.745]  When do you leave?
[01:45:55.745 --> 01:45:56.847]  Soon.
[01:45:56.847 --> 01:45:57.287]  Texas?
[01:45:57.287 --> 01:45:58.409]  Yeah, I'm going to go to Texas.
[01:45:59.192 --> 01:46:00.313]  I got a farm in Vermont.
[01:46:00.313 --> 01:46:01.853]  It's a little cold.
[01:46:01.853 --> 01:46:03.974]  Vermont's cold.
[01:46:03.974 --> 01:46:11.098]  I just want to go somewhere in the center of the country, somewhere it's easier to travel to both places and somewhere we have a little bit more freedom.
[01:46:11.098 --> 01:46:15.961]  Also I think that where we live right here in Los Angeles is overcrowded and I think
[01:46:16.741 --> 01:46:18.523]  Most of the time, that's not a problem.
[01:46:18.523 --> 01:46:21.646]  But I think it's exposing the fact that it's a real issue.
[01:46:21.646 --> 01:46:37.821]  When you look at the number of people that are catching COVID because of this overpopulation issue, when you look at the traffic, when you look at the economic despair, when you look at the homelessness problem that's accelerated radically over the last 6, 7, 10 years,
[01:46:40.223 --> 01:46:41.604]  I think there's too many people here.
[01:46:41.604 --> 01:46:42.805]  I think it's not tenable.
[01:46:42.805 --> 01:46:44.147]  I don't think it's manageable.
[01:46:44.147 --> 01:46:49.031]  And I think every mayor does a shit job of doing it because I don't think anybody could do a great job of it.
[01:46:49.031 --> 01:46:55.016]  I think there's like certain things you're gonna have to deal with when you have a population of whatever the fuck LA is.
[01:46:55.016 --> 01:46:57.098]  It's like 20 million plus people.
[01:46:57.098 --> 01:46:57.698]  It's too many people.
[01:46:57.698 --> 01:46:58.599]  It's too many people.
[01:46:58.599 --> 01:47:00.140]  Yeah, that's what I think.
[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:02.042]  I think where you're living is probably the perfect way to do it.
[01:47:02.042 --> 01:47:02.362]  It's 500 people.
[01:47:03.643 --> 01:47:04.463]  That's nuts.
[01:47:04.463 --> 01:47:07.324]  But then you got those dudes yelling at you, where's the deer?
[01:47:07.324 --> 01:47:09.605]  I could go on.
[01:47:09.605 --> 01:47:14.547]  We could do hours of the negatives of a small town.
[01:47:14.547 --> 01:47:15.827]  Oh yeah, there's negatives.
[01:47:15.827 --> 01:47:18.048]  Everybody knows your business.
[01:47:18.048 --> 01:47:20.909]  Everybody knows what you're doing, where you're going.
[01:47:20.909 --> 01:47:22.629]  There's pros and cons to everything.
[01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:27.711]  But I think you have a better opportunity at more pros when there's less folks.
[01:47:28.151 --> 01:47:29.212]  I agree.
[01:47:29.212 --> 01:47:31.114]  So small town Texas or?
[01:47:31.114 --> 01:47:32.675]  Let's just leave it at that.
[01:47:32.675 --> 01:47:34.037]  I got ideas.
[01:47:34.037 --> 01:47:35.998]  Jamie's coming.
[01:47:35.998 --> 01:47:36.939]  He's all excited.
[01:47:36.939 --> 01:47:38.261]  It doesn't affect the business?
[01:47:38.261 --> 01:47:38.641]  No.
[01:47:38.641 --> 01:47:39.922]  We're just going to do it from there.
[01:47:39.922 --> 01:47:41.844]  That's the other thing is Texas has comedy.
[01:47:41.844 --> 01:47:42.705]  They have stand-up comedy.
[01:47:42.705 --> 01:47:47.890]  I've been doing, I did, well I haven't been doing, but I did one weekend in Texas while all this was going on.
[01:47:47.890 --> 01:47:49.891]  It was the first weekend I was able to do stand-up.
[01:47:50.872 --> 01:47:54.775]  But then my friends were in San Antonio and they got COVID down there.
[01:47:54.775 --> 01:47:59.719]  But those knuckleheads were out there talking to people and shaking hands and taking pictures and stuff.
[01:47:59.719 --> 01:48:04.582]  Texas would be the last stand place to ever wear a mask or not shake a hand.
[01:48:04.582 --> 01:48:05.783]  They wear masks though.
[01:48:05.783 --> 01:48:07.104]  People are wearing masks.
[01:48:07.104 --> 01:48:07.945]  Last time I was there.
[01:48:07.945 --> 01:48:09.666]  I think now they're woken up, right?
[01:48:09.666 --> 01:48:11.648]  Well, this is a weird disease, man.
[01:48:13.988 --> 01:48:19.512]  Alright, and I've talked to Joe about this, and he said, no, you're the first person to tell me it was man-made, so doesn't that make it deadly?
[01:48:19.512 --> 01:48:26.437]  No, it's man-made, so it's a chimera, so it's artificial, so these labs can own it and control it and own the testing for it, and it's all fraud.
[01:48:26.437 --> 01:48:27.438]  And we've detailed this.
[01:48:27.438 --> 01:48:29.339]  Here's an example right here.
[01:48:29.339 --> 01:48:38.746]  Sinclair, bigger than Fox News, thousands of stations across the country, says it will postpone and rework segment featuring conspiracy theory about Fauci with the Eric Bolling Show.
[01:48:39.767 --> 01:48:42.408]  I personally sent Bowling articles about this in the last few months.
[01:48:42.408 --> 01:48:44.189]  He knew all about it already!
[01:48:44.189 --> 01:48:45.830]  And what did he cover?
[01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:48.231]  NIH.gov!
[01:48:48.231 --> 01:48:52.453]  NIH lifts funding pause on gain-of-function research with coronaviruses.
[01:48:52.453 --> 01:48:55.214]  Dr. Fauci backed controversial Wuhan lab with U.S.
[01:48:55.214 --> 01:48:57.995]  dollars for risky coronavirus research at Wuhan lab.
[01:48:57.995 --> 01:48:59.016]  Newsweek!
[01:48:59.016 --> 01:48:59.616]  Newsweek!
[01:48:59.616 --> 01:49:00.937]  Look right there, that's Newsweek!
[01:49:03.785 --> 01:49:17.573]  This is the reality to Joe's guests at the New York Times.
[01:49:17.573 --> 01:49:21.916]  The cases are skyrocketing, the deaths are going way down.
[01:49:21.916 --> 01:49:32.182]  I predict they'll go spiking again when the numbers come in at the end of the month because July is when the new doctors and nurses come in for their residencies and they call it the July effect.
[01:49:32.782 --> 01:49:36.845]  I get into real statistics, real information, real research.
[01:49:36.845 --> 01:49:42.430]  It was a major scientific scandal that our government said, we've got to make it illegal.
[01:49:42.430 --> 01:49:46.053]  The scientists told Obama, you can't have these weaponized coronaviruses in our labs.
[01:49:46.053 --> 01:49:47.794]  So he just took it to China.
[01:49:47.794 --> 01:49:49.956]  And Fauci ran it with Bill Gates.
[01:49:49.956 --> 01:49:51.477]  Look up who funded Wuhan.
[01:49:51.477 --> 01:49:54.320]  And now Sinclair is under criticism for this.
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:56.702]  And they go, oh, we'll rework it or won't air it.
[01:49:58.629 --> 01:50:02.397]  And I just showed you Newsweek, NIH, New Scientist.
[01:50:02.397 --> 01:50:03.720]  I could show you a hundred more!
[01:50:05.165 --> 01:50:16.934]  Was a major, major controversy, but since when is Oliver Darcy, the guy that brags he helped get me banned off the internet, since when is that rat, that possum, the guy that goes around and decides what can be on air and what can't?
[01:50:16.934 --> 01:50:20.857]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, his full show will be posted to Banned.Video.
[01:50:20.857 --> 01:50:22.618]  Please promote all our local stations.
[01:50:22.618 --> 01:50:23.579]  Thank the local sponsors.
[01:50:23.579 --> 01:50:30.344]  Become a sponsor, but realize the globals are fighting to keep us from getting out, but thanks to you, the broadcast is actually exploding!
[01:50:30.344 --> 01:50:31.445]  God bless you all!
[01:50:31.445 --> 01:50:33.346]  Retransmission starts now!
[01:50:33.346 --> 01:50:34.407]  Spread those live links!
[01:50:37.551 --> 01:50:42.716]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:50:42.716 --> 01:50:44.337]  You can wear them out to political events.
[01:50:44.337 --> 01:50:46.039]  You can trigger lib darts.
[01:50:46.039 --> 01:50:53.185]  One of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[01:50:53.185 --> 01:50:54.186]  But on top of that,
[01:50:54.704 --> 01:50:59.426]  They admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[01:50:59.426 --> 01:51:06.028]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and contact tracing that they're openly announcing.
[01:51:06.028 --> 01:51:07.828]  It's an act of submission.
[01:51:07.828 --> 01:51:11.249]  It's an act of like putting a burka on your head and bowing down.
[01:51:11.249 --> 01:51:16.131]  But a big reason to wear these is then into stores when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween mask, say,
[01:51:16.590 --> 01:51:20.992]  It's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[01:51:20.992 --> 01:51:24.813]  And the M95 mask only controls what's coming in, not what's going out.
[01:51:24.813 --> 01:51:26.874]  So they quote, spread COVID-19.
[01:51:26.874 --> 01:51:28.375]  They don't protect from it.
[01:51:28.375 --> 01:51:31.336]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back at these control freaks' faces.
[01:51:31.336 --> 01:51:33.977]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free.
[01:51:33.977 --> 01:51:34.977]  They're at cost.
[01:51:34.977 --> 01:51:36.378]  Infowarrestore.com.
[01:51:37.921 --> 01:51:42.544]  There are a lot of signs that people are really waking up to the new world order and global government.
[01:51:42.544 --> 01:51:45.666]  But one of the biggest is privacy pouches.
[01:51:45.666 --> 01:51:48.568]  I've been selling these for more than 10 years.
[01:51:48.568 --> 01:51:50.650]  In the old days, they weren't 100% effective.
[01:51:50.650 --> 01:51:51.430]  Now they are.
[01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:57.935]  They're little bitty, lightweight Faraday cages that small phones and even large cell phones fit into very, very comfortably.
[01:51:58.295 --> 01:51:58.575]  I think so.
[01:52:17.566 --> 01:52:20.147]  Well, I gotta tell you, normally we probably sold a couple hundred a month.
[01:52:20.147 --> 01:52:23.688]  We're selling upwards of a thousand of these a day.
[01:52:23.688 --> 01:52:25.869]  Plus, we have a good unit and it's also a good price.
[01:52:25.869 --> 01:52:27.410]  We have it in four different colors.
[01:52:27.410 --> 01:52:30.571]  It's the Privacy Pockets at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:52:30.571 --> 01:52:31.851]  People are really waking up.
[01:52:31.851 --> 01:52:35.833]  I'm seeing it all over the news that folks are aware of this and are now using these.
[01:52:35.833 --> 01:52:41.035]  Get yours at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:52:41.035 --> 01:52:43.636]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:00.449 --> 01:53:06.232]  Alright, Patrick Howley is our guest.
[01:53:06.232 --> 01:53:07.673]  He's with nationalfile.com.
[01:53:07.673 --> 01:53:12.976]  I'm your host Alex Jones here and everybody should remember this.
[01:53:14.209 --> 01:53:22.637]  The globalists, their pedophile rings, their satanic networks, how they operate, how they control people, how they get people inducted into evil so they know they'll carry out whatever they're told.
[01:53:22.637 --> 01:53:23.739]  That's all falling apart.
[01:53:23.739 --> 01:53:30.806]  That's why they're throwing race war at us and masks and all the rest of it, trying to tear society apart, trying to bring in a depression.
[01:53:32.145 --> 01:53:36.388]  Where they can reset the global economy for all the fraud they've created and blame it on COVID.
[01:53:36.388 --> 01:53:39.711]  It's not COVID causing the worldwide starvation or the worldwide collapse.
[01:53:39.711 --> 01:53:42.393]  It's the hoax these criminals launched.
[01:53:42.393 --> 01:53:49.158]  And look, emblematically, all of their evil crones are rotting and dying, like Ginsburg and the rest of them.
[01:53:51.112 --> 01:53:53.995]  Nadler stumbling around gaslighting everybody.
[01:53:53.995 --> 01:53:55.757]  So don't think they're all powerful.
[01:53:55.757 --> 01:53:57.039]  Learn to say no to them.
[01:53:57.039 --> 01:53:58.821]  That's some good news coming up at the start of the next segment.
[01:53:58.821 --> 01:54:08.311]  But here is the head of the UN's Global Response Unit that then, right down to Texas, right down to California, we follow the orders of.
[01:54:08.311 --> 01:54:10.834]  And now that's why they're saying, you've got to wear a mask in your house.
[01:54:10.834 --> 01:54:12.035]  We've got to take your kids away.
[01:54:12.035 --> 01:54:12.416]  Here it is.
[01:54:13.595 --> 01:54:24.802]  And at the moment, in most parts of the world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household, at family level.
[01:54:24.802 --> 01:54:31.286]  In some senses, transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units.
[01:54:31.286 --> 01:54:40.772]  Now, we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[01:54:41.363 --> 01:54:46.788]  Right after he said that, Lightfoot of Chicago, Newsom of California, all of them came out and said the exact same thing.
[01:54:46.788 --> 01:54:48.409]  They admit, they follow the U.N.
[01:54:48.409 --> 01:54:49.550]  orders directly.
[01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:56.135]  That itself is revolutionary corruption.
[01:54:56.135 --> 01:54:59.038]  Patrick, what do you think, how should we respond to this level of tyranny?
[01:55:00.652 --> 01:55:09.496]  Well, you know what, Alex, if you study Alistair Crowley, Alistair Crowley was the most influential person of the 20th century, and Alistair Crowley's influence can be felt in everything.
[01:55:09.496 --> 01:55:20.860]  And his magic rituals, which now form, you know, so much of our government policy and our media and our institutions, because these people infiltrated and subverted everything, it all has to do with children.
[01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:22.761]  And that's what we're seeing with Child Protective Services.
[01:55:23.041 --> 01:55:28.906]  They want to use coronavirus as a pretext to take people's kids away and then do God knows what with them.
[01:55:28.906 --> 01:55:34.710]  And we know what they do with these children, with the ceremonies, and we know what was going on down in Epstein Island.
[01:55:34.710 --> 01:55:36.371]  Now, you were right.
[01:55:36.371 --> 01:55:38.013]  They are not invincible.
[01:55:38.013 --> 01:55:42.036]  This is a modern kind of takeover and subversion attempt.
[01:55:42.757 --> 01:55:44.078]  They're not the establishment.
[01:55:44.078 --> 01:55:46.901]  Calling them the establishment gives them too much credit.
[01:55:46.901 --> 01:55:47.602]  They're criminals.
[01:55:47.602 --> 01:55:51.626]  They're rogue, sicko criminals who have taken over in recent decades.
[01:55:51.626 --> 01:56:02.318]  Now, if you look at the nexus of power of this, which revolves around, frankly, some Mossad families, including Maxwell family, Bronfman family, they're good friends who they've partnered with.
[01:56:03.085 --> 01:56:17.373]  And these hanger-ons like Alan Dershowitz, who provides the legal expertise, and Jeffrey Epstein, who is running this blackmail operation down on Pedophile Island with the satanic temple there, and the owl statue, and all the videotaping.
[01:56:17.373 --> 01:56:20.795]  And, you know, Ghislaine Maxwell, she really is royalty in this world.
[01:56:20.795 --> 01:56:27.319]  So, you know, now that this kind of stuff is collapsing, we're beginning to see how fragile it is.
[01:56:27.319 --> 01:56:29.200]  If there's an economic reset
[01:56:29.975 --> 01:56:33.298]  If these people somehow lose their money, it's all over.
[01:56:33.298 --> 01:56:39.483]  I mean, they have been hoodwinking us with Hollywood and the media for a few decades, but they're not invincible.
[01:56:39.483 --> 01:56:52.174]  The willpower of the people is stronger than them, and the normie class that they have created, the hysterical, emotional people who watch Oprah and Ellen DeGeneres and think that they don't have to improve themselves because Oprah empowers them,
[01:56:52.654 --> 01:56:59.905]  Okay, those people are not going to have power anymore in our new society because real, smart, competent men are going to lead.
[01:57:02.247 --> 01:57:09.390]  Well, let me tell you, you're always powerful, but you're really fired up right now, and I'm loving it, and I'm seeing the great articles you're writing daily over at NationalFile.com.
[01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:11.191]  We're going to break here in about 30 seconds.
[01:57:11.191 --> 01:57:21.856]  I want to come back, and I want to get into the latest on Ghislaine Maxwell, but I want to hit what's happening with the mask rebellion as really a symbol of the slaves.
[01:57:21.856 --> 01:57:26.419]  It's like the hijab, or the burqa is, and where you see that fight going.
[01:57:27.139 --> 01:57:32.865]  And of course we'll play the clip of the lady attacking the family at a picnic table, not wearing their hijabs while they eat.
[01:57:32.865 --> 01:57:34.126]  She should move to Saudi Arabia.
[01:57:34.126 --> 01:57:35.267]  She'd love it.
[01:57:35.267 --> 01:57:36.128]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:36.128 --> 01:57:39.031]  I'm Alex Jones with Band.Video.
[01:57:39.031 --> 01:57:40.312]  Band.Video.
[01:57:40.312 --> 01:57:42.034]  See David Icke's new film there for free.
[01:57:46.041 --> 01:57:56.372]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[01:57:56.372 --> 01:58:01.077]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[01:58:01.758 --> 01:58:10.121]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[01:58:10.121 --> 01:58:30.009]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsitesummit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[01:58:30.669 --> 01:58:31.690]  Destinies.
[01:58:31.690 --> 01:58:38.616]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy.
[01:58:38.616 --> 01:58:43.120]  But being aware of it, and standing up to it, and speaking out against it, will defeat it.
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:45.222]  So take action, or be slaves!
[01:59:03.537 --> 01:59:12.322]  Right Bart, you name it, is here with us breaking down the big picture.
[01:59:12.322 --> 01:59:14.183]  Integrating this in
[01:59:30.407 --> 01:59:40.976]  With them activating the race riots through Soros, activating the COVID lockdown, saying that their communists are allowed to march and attack and be violent, but you're not allowed to have peaceful pro-police rallies.
[01:59:40.976 --> 01:59:47.761]  Clearly it's an overthrow of the country, but now we have Atlantic Monthly, the CFR, and others saying, we're doing this to overthrow Trump.
[01:59:47.761 --> 01:59:49.663]  You better leave office or we'll burn America down.
[01:59:49.663 --> 01:59:53.466]  They actually said that this weekend at Atlantic Monthly.
[01:59:53.466 --> 01:59:54.927]  It's worked in so many other countries.
[01:59:54.927 --> 01:59:56.829]  It just worked six years ago in Ukraine.
[01:59:56.829 --> 01:59:58.030]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[01:59:58.610 --> 02:00:03.235]  Then they go attack the courthouse, the media covers it up, and says they're peaceful.
[02:00:03.235 --> 02:00:05.297]  But I don't think it's working.
[02:00:05.297 --> 02:00:06.279]  What's the big picture?
[02:00:06.279 --> 02:00:08.481]  What do you expect them to pull next with 98 days out?
[02:00:10.663 --> 02:00:21.848]  Well, Alex, I know everybody likes to be politically correct, but you have to understand how racial Maoism and racial communism works, which is they are, in fact, targeting white people, demonizing white people.
[02:00:21.848 --> 02:00:23.428]  They're explicitly saying that.
[02:00:23.428 --> 02:00:34.353]  The Republican Party will not respond to this, even though the majority of the people who vote for the Republican Party, who elect them to office, are the white, Christian, evangelical middle class.
[02:00:34.353 --> 02:00:36.094]  And so those people are getting frustrated.
[02:00:36.454 --> 02:00:59.786]  Young people are getting frustrated when they see themselves demonized every day on ESPN by their sports stars, by these guys who are kneeling for the national anthem and they're being treated like heroes and meanwhile they're burdened with debt, they can't get a job because all the corporations are woke and this stupid scandemic has shut down the small business economy and now Fauci wants you to wear a disgusting face diaper on your face and breathe in your carbon dioxide.
[02:01:00.186 --> 02:01:02.088]  So people are beginning to lose hope.
[02:01:02.088 --> 02:01:09.433]  Millennials only own 3% of the wealth in this country, plus they have debt, and they have a very bleak future with globalist mass migration.
[02:01:09.433 --> 02:01:15.258]  And so there needs to be people, leaders, reaching out to them and making them feel like
[02:01:15.918 --> 02:01:17.058]  It's not hopeless.
[02:01:17.058 --> 02:01:19.619]  We're going to rally behind Western civilization.
[02:01:19.619 --> 02:01:22.280]  And it's not a racial thing with us, but you know what?
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:23.900]  It's a racial thing with the other side.
[02:01:23.900 --> 02:01:29.102]  They hate white people, but they're going to come for black people next because it's replacement migration.
[02:01:29.102 --> 02:01:31.563]  They're going to come for legal Hispanics next.
[02:01:31.563 --> 02:01:42.786]  They're going to keep continuously replacing people and genociding people because they want the entire slave class to be kind of this mongrel race.
[02:01:43.326 --> 02:01:46.950]  Uh, that doesn't compete with them and doesn't even live in the same universe as them.
[02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:47.491]  Well, that's right.
[02:01:47.491 --> 02:01:48.512]  That's their sick plan.
[02:01:48.512 --> 02:01:51.396]  A group that doesn't have any culture that's been overwritten.
[02:01:51.396 --> 02:01:56.061]  They use the third world, enslave them, break them down on record.
[02:01:56.061 --> 02:02:00.346]  Then they open the borders, flood us with the third world, filling them full of race-based hate.
[02:02:01.027 --> 02:02:10.891]  While they tell us to stand down because we're inherently bad, and the corporations conquer all of us, take all of our rights, and then carry out the extermination using super bio-weapons they've already got geared up.
[02:02:10.891 --> 02:02:14.452]  This is Gates said on national TV on Colbert.
[02:02:14.452 --> 02:02:16.433]  He said, oh this is just a drill.
[02:02:16.433 --> 02:02:17.673]  The real one's coming.
[02:02:17.673 --> 02:02:18.974]  Terrorists are going to release it.
[02:02:18.974 --> 02:02:21.515]  And he started smiling and laughing.
[02:02:21.515 --> 02:02:26.057]  When he was on national Japanese television, they said, are you depopulating?
[02:02:26.057 --> 02:02:26.597]  He said, listen.
[02:02:27.571 --> 02:02:30.393]  We got different vaccines for different countries and groups.
[02:02:30.393 --> 02:02:33.055]  Don't worry, the poor people really need this.
[02:02:33.055 --> 02:02:35.277]  We need to make sure there's not overpopulation.
[02:02:35.277 --> 02:02:36.158]  He says it!
[02:02:36.158 --> 02:02:37.799]  He doesn't even hide it!
[02:02:37.799 --> 02:02:38.719]  And it's crazy!
[02:02:38.719 --> 02:02:44.864]  I don't want to be flooded with a bunch of brainwashed people from, you know, Africa or wherever that want to kill me, okay?
[02:02:44.864 --> 02:02:46.866]  At the same time, I don't want to murder all of them!
[02:02:47.566 --> 02:02:56.911]  And then you study Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell and the Rockefellers, and they're all crazy, evil people, way worse than the most crazed African.
[02:02:56.911 --> 02:03:02.774]  So, I mean, what I'm saying is, it's like, it's a nightmare scenario with these people.
[02:03:02.774 --> 02:03:03.675]  Absolutely right.
[02:03:03.675 --> 02:03:05.396]  And this all ties in.
[02:03:05.396 --> 02:03:07.997]  I mean, everything is related over the last few decades.
[02:03:07.997 --> 02:03:16.582]  Ghislaine Maxwell's nephew was a top-ranking official in Hillary Clinton's State Department overseeing the Middle East, specifically overseeing Libya.
[02:03:17.952 --> 02:03:19.653]  During the time of Benghazi.
[02:03:19.653 --> 02:03:23.796]  Now, Sarah Bronfman, who was part of running the NXIVM cult.
[02:03:23.796 --> 02:03:29.240]  Okay, Bronfman's and Maxwell's have been partners traditionally over the years, both very closely linked to the Mossad.
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:37.726]  Sarah Bronfman was working on, you know, agitating on behalf of the rebels and using the rebels, which became ISIS, as their own personal fighting force.
[02:03:37.726 --> 02:03:39.427]  So they were destabilizing that region.
[02:03:39.807 --> 02:03:41.008]  Bush was in on it.
[02:03:41.008 --> 02:03:42.288]  Cheney was in on it.
[02:03:42.288 --> 02:03:48.510]  Both parties, Rove, Obama, McCain, these are sick people and there's no difference between any one of them.
[02:03:48.510 --> 02:03:57.494]  This is a sick agenda that has been put forth in recent decades and it's up to people like us to finally free people's minds and wake people up.
[02:03:57.494 --> 02:03:59.434]  And you know, you're one of my heroes, Alex.
[02:03:59.434 --> 02:04:01.195]  I've been listening to you since high school.
[02:04:01.195 --> 02:04:02.636]  People are waking up.
[02:04:02.636 --> 02:04:05.417]  I think probably even the majority of the people now get it.
[02:04:05.417 --> 02:04:06.077]  They really get it.
[02:04:08.311 --> 02:04:09.912]  What do you make of Trump?
[02:04:09.912 --> 02:04:11.433]  Because I did research on Trump.
[02:04:11.433 --> 02:04:15.536]  Obviously, I was covering Epstein 15 years ago, covering the pedophile stuff, you know, before that.
[02:04:15.536 --> 02:04:18.858]  You know, not just once he got indicted and all the rest.
[02:04:18.858 --> 02:04:19.999]  I was aware of these operations.
[02:04:19.999 --> 02:04:24.062]  I knew that he was there to corrupt scientists and was just an operative in it.
[02:04:24.842 --> 02:04:26.403]  Uh, so, so I wouldn't support Trump.
[02:04:26.403 --> 02:04:27.024]  He was really connected.
[02:04:27.024 --> 02:04:28.325]  He never got on the plane.
[02:04:28.325 --> 02:04:29.866]  He didn't, you know, he had his golf club.
[02:04:29.866 --> 02:04:30.866]  He came to that, came to events.
[02:04:30.866 --> 02:04:31.507]  They knew each other.
[02:04:31.507 --> 02:04:32.528]  He knew Ghislaine.
[02:04:32.528 --> 02:04:35.910]  Why would he say in that press conference, oh, I wish her well?
[02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:40.073]  I think he means he hopes she doesn't die in custody so we find out what's happening.
[02:04:40.073 --> 02:04:41.534]  Let's go ahead and play that clip and get what you think.
[02:04:42.697 --> 02:04:46.301]  And so a lot of people want to know if she's going to turn in powerful people.
[02:04:46.301 --> 02:04:48.543]  Do you feel that she's going to turn in powerful men?
[02:04:48.543 --> 02:04:50.445]  How do you see that working out?
[02:04:50.445 --> 02:04:50.925]  I don't know.
[02:04:50.925 --> 02:04:52.787]  I haven't really been following it too much.
[02:04:52.787 --> 02:04:55.029]  I just wish her well, frankly.
[02:04:55.029 --> 02:05:00.675]  I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach.
[02:05:01.235 --> 02:05:01.615]  I'll stop there.
[02:05:01.615 --> 02:05:02.235]  So why would Trump
[02:05:24.005 --> 02:05:32.209]  Who's called Epstein degenerate and a horrible person, who in 2015, you know, told Bloomberg that it was horrible, degenerate things happening at the aisle and they were horrible people.
[02:05:32.209 --> 02:05:37.811]  Why would he then make that statement, Patrick Howley?
[02:05:37.811 --> 02:05:39.112]  Because he wants her to talk.
[02:05:39.112 --> 02:05:41.533]  And you know, you've also got Keith Raniere out there.
[02:05:41.533 --> 02:05:42.914]  Here's another thing to keep in mind.
[02:05:42.914 --> 02:05:44.714]  Keith Raniere of the NXIVM called.
[02:05:44.714 --> 02:05:48.176]  Who, like Epstein, was another outsider brought into this evil nexus.
[02:05:49.022 --> 02:05:53.709]  Connected to the Bronfmans and his sentencing has been indefinitely postponed.
[02:05:53.709 --> 02:05:55.531]  So we want him to talk too.
[02:05:55.531 --> 02:05:56.473]  We want to keep him safe.
[02:05:56.473 --> 02:05:57.774]  We want to keep these people safe.
[02:05:57.774 --> 02:05:58.856]  Look, I've been an insider.
[02:05:58.856 --> 02:06:00.679]  That's exactly what I thought Trump was doing.
[02:06:00.679 --> 02:06:03.423]  He's letting her know, hey, we wish her well, you better tell us.
[02:06:04.735 --> 02:06:05.695]  Well that's right Alex.
[02:06:05.695 --> 02:06:08.257]  I worked for Steve Bannon 2015-2016.
[02:06:08.257 --> 02:06:10.358]  I've been an insider on a lot of this stuff.
[02:06:10.358 --> 02:06:11.618]  And here's what happened.
[02:06:11.618 --> 02:06:20.843]  Early 2015, I wrote an article with these documents talking about how Epstein pleaded the theft when he was asked about his friendship with Bill Clinton.
[02:06:20.843 --> 02:06:27.186]  Immediately after that, Donald Trump went to CPAC, did an interview with Sean Handy where he said, Bill Clinton's got an Epstein problem.
[02:06:27.566 --> 02:06:30.567]  He was fanning the flames of this Epstein stuff the entire time.
[02:06:30.567 --> 02:06:31.528]  And you know what?
[02:06:31.528 --> 02:06:35.790]  He was an informant the first time they busted Epstein for pedophilia.
[02:06:35.790 --> 02:06:44.253]  Epstein gets out of jail, he gets a little country club sentence, George Stephanopoulos is still hanging out with him, Katie Couric is hanging out with him, Woody Allen, all these big people, okay?
[02:06:44.253 --> 02:06:48.035]  But Trump was the informant who tried to bring him down, okay?
[02:06:48.035 --> 02:06:50.516]  So it's no coincidence that all this is happening during the Trump administration.
[02:06:50.516 --> 02:06:52.277]  And as soon as he got indicted, Trump threw him out of the club.
[02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:54.762]  Absolutely right.
[02:06:54.762 --> 02:06:56.004]  He's been on to Epstein for years.
[02:06:56.004 --> 02:06:57.105]  And we're not just defending Trump.
[02:06:57.105 --> 02:06:58.628]  We're defending the truth.
[02:06:58.628 --> 02:07:00.731]  Trump from day one has not been part of this.
[02:07:00.731 --> 02:07:02.714]  But he has big public parties in his club.
[02:07:02.714 --> 02:07:03.555]  Of course he's known Epstein.
[02:07:05.356 --> 02:07:11.198]  Trump's old money, and he's a patriot, and he is part of the industrial class that built this country.
[02:07:11.198 --> 02:07:13.439]  He doesn't want subversives.
[02:07:13.439 --> 02:07:22.162]  He doesn't want... And by the way, exactly, I want you to do one more segment to explain this, because you do know a lot of the inside baseball, and I concur with you, but Trump isn't going to a Russian hotel to get pissed on.
[02:07:22.162 --> 02:07:25.243]  He's actually a germaphobe and doesn't like that kind of stuff.
[02:07:25.243 --> 02:07:26.343]  He doesn't like little girls.
[02:07:26.343 --> 02:07:29.104]  He likes big bombshell women that are intimidating.
[02:07:29.344 --> 02:07:30.725]  That's what he's well known for.
[02:07:30.725 --> 02:07:31.645]  He's a powerful man.
[02:07:31.645 --> 02:07:34.187]  He's not... I mean, look at the women he's with.
[02:07:34.187 --> 02:07:35.888]  Big, big bombshells.
[02:07:35.888 --> 02:07:41.651]  The point is, is that these creepy globalist-like women that look like little kids, that's who they are.
[02:07:41.651 --> 02:07:46.254]  And they want little kids because they want power over them because they're creepy sickos.
[02:07:46.254 --> 02:07:47.975]  So it's not about defending Trump.
[02:07:47.975 --> 02:07:52.298]  The media's attempts to tie him to Epstein are a smokescreen from the Clintons and the rest of it.
[02:07:53.953 --> 02:07:55.174]  Yeah, that's absolutely right.
[02:07:55.174 --> 02:08:00.297]  And Trump is a religious man, and he's a Christian, and I think he's had a big awakening late in life.
[02:08:00.297 --> 02:08:01.578]  He wants to stop these people.
[02:08:01.578 --> 02:08:04.420]  He knows what Satanism is just as well as anybody else.
[02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:12.085]  He wants to stop these people, and it's going to be up to citizen journalists on the outside to help him, to give him the justification that he needs.
[02:08:12.085 --> 02:08:15.207]  We are going into a very, very tough election, but you know what?
[02:08:15.207 --> 02:08:17.569]  The chessboard is getting very complicated.
[02:08:17.569 --> 02:08:19.530]  Trump has a lot of cards.
[02:08:19.530 --> 02:08:20.651]  He's got a lot of cards.
[02:08:20.891 --> 02:08:22.993]  And he's playing those cards, I can tell you that for a fact.
[02:08:44.127 --> 02:08:45.648]  The people are awakening.
[02:08:45.648 --> 02:08:48.371]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[02:08:48.371 --> 02:08:50.433]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[02:08:50.433 --> 02:08:52.795]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[02:08:52.795 --> 02:09:02.144]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai comms especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data.
[02:09:02.424 --> 02:09:11.010]  To be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[02:09:11.010 --> 02:09:17.735]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[02:09:17.735 --> 02:09:19.156]  In their own words, they admit it.
[02:09:19.156 --> 02:09:23.579]  Show, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[02:09:24.059 --> 02:09:26.001]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[02:09:26.001 --> 02:09:27.082]  They're Faraday cages.
[02:09:27.082 --> 02:09:28.784]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[02:09:28.784 --> 02:09:30.786]  They work absolutely great.
[02:09:30.786 --> 02:09:39.914]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.

[02:11:33.762 --> 02:11:35.023]  My dad has launched a company.
[02:11:35.023 --> 02:11:36.725]  He's launched a website.
[02:11:36.725 --> 02:11:40.689]  It's got nine different products on it right now on so many fronts.
[02:11:40.689 --> 02:11:43.091]  Just go check out the website.

[02:11:55.462 --> 02:11:56.382]  Really, really proud of this.
[02:11:56.382 --> 02:12:03.108]  He did this all on his own with other folks and we're fully backing it and it helps support us and helps us diversify our support network.
[02:12:03.108 --> 02:12:09.453]  So I hope you check it out or find all the products at infowarstore.com and don't forget we have storewide free shipping, double patriot points, that is
[02:12:09.753 --> 02:12:11.354]  It's going to end on Friday.
[02:12:11.354 --> 02:12:12.594]  Biggest sell of the year so far.
[02:12:12.594 --> 02:12:18.097]  A lot of things are about to sell out, like Boddy's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, so be sure and take action on that.
[02:12:18.097 --> 02:12:30.143]  Alright, Patrick Howley, speaking of Trump's ammo, what he's got in this quiver of arrows here, and what you expect him to do, I think he should start firing almost everything now, early.
[02:12:30.143 --> 02:12:32.364]  The enemy's doing that, because they know they're behind it.
[02:12:32.364 --> 02:12:34.105]  I believe they know they're desperate.
[02:12:34.105 --> 02:12:34.985]  They know they're in trouble.
[02:12:36.266 --> 02:12:37.927]  They're trying to overthrow him.
[02:12:37.927 --> 02:12:38.828]  They're trying to kill him.
[02:12:38.828 --> 02:12:41.089]  They're saying they're going to use the military to take him out.
[02:12:41.089 --> 02:12:42.790]  I think waiting is not smart.
[02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:46.533]  I think he should decisively destroy them right now.
[02:12:46.533 --> 02:12:48.114]  Absolutely 100% correct.
[02:12:48.114 --> 02:12:50.975]  Look at the paradigm that we have now, which is pretty amazing.
[02:12:50.975 --> 02:12:53.757]  You've got Harvey Weinstein is in jail.
[02:12:53.757 --> 02:12:56.199]  You've got Keith Raniere, who is in jail.
[02:12:56.199 --> 02:12:59.140]  You've got Ghislaine Maxwell, who's in jail.
[02:12:59.140 --> 02:13:00.561]  We had Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:13:00.561 --> 02:13:02.803]  We didn't see it coming that they were going to kill him.
[02:13:03.363 --> 02:13:03.663]  I think?
[02:13:18.357 --> 02:13:19.878]  Where who's going to flip on who?
[02:13:19.878 --> 02:13:21.179]  These people all know each other.
[02:13:21.179 --> 02:13:22.700]  They all know what they've been up to.
[02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:24.501]  We all know what they've been up to.
[02:13:24.501 --> 02:13:33.046]  And so it's an amazing opportunity right now to really shift the balance of power in the whole world because these people haven't been in power for very long.
[02:13:33.046 --> 02:13:35.328]  As I said before, Trump is old money.
[02:13:35.328 --> 02:13:36.668]  He's an industrialist.
[02:13:36.668 --> 02:13:43.833]  He doesn't like seeing his country get ruined and subverted by these criminals who just went on a criminal spree.
[02:13:44.213 --> 02:13:48.424]  Everything Trump does is about service economy, which is a human economy.
[02:13:48.424 --> 02:13:49.085]  He's pro-human.
[02:13:50.643 --> 02:13:51.083]  That's right.
[02:13:51.083 --> 02:13:51.943]  He's a humanist.
[02:13:51.943 --> 02:13:52.744]  Absolutely right.
[02:13:52.744 --> 02:13:59.665]  And we're going into a very sinister technocracy if these evil people, if these Satanists are allowed to stay in control.
[02:13:59.665 --> 02:14:00.846]  We don't want that.
[02:14:00.846 --> 02:14:08.027]  And so, you know, we're in a great situation right now where we have these people where we want them and we don't want them to get killed.
[02:14:08.027 --> 02:14:11.508]  We want Ghislaine Maxwell to be alive.
[02:14:11.508 --> 02:14:13.209]  We want Keith Raniere to be alive.
[02:14:13.209 --> 02:14:14.769]  There's a reason why Keith Raniere is
[02:14:15.329 --> 02:14:17.632]  Sentencing has been indefinitely postponed.
[02:14:17.632 --> 02:14:18.733]  There's a reason why.
[02:14:18.733 --> 02:14:20.915]  They're pressuring Claire Bronfman, Sarah Bronfman.
[02:14:20.915 --> 02:14:24.479]  And notice how they criticized Trump when he went to that church and said it was the worst thing ever.
[02:14:24.479 --> 02:14:30.264]  No, he needs to fully embrace Christ and God and he will absolutely win and the country will save itself.
[02:14:30.264 --> 02:14:33.327]  So they always attack what is most effective.
[02:14:33.327 --> 02:14:35.550]  Trump needs to, whatever they're attacking, he needs to do that.
[02:14:37.338 --> 02:14:38.620]  Yes, absolutely right.
[02:14:38.620 --> 02:14:42.165]  Now, you mentioned the mask being similar to the burqa.
[02:14:42.165 --> 02:14:45.290]  And you have to understand that these globalists use Islam.
[02:14:45.290 --> 02:14:46.551]  They manipulate Islam.
[02:14:46.551 --> 02:14:51.438]  They went over there and they had our troops, our heroes, who we admire and we respect.
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:15:10.125]  They turned them against our own interests and they had them funding and arming and training the jihadist groups and building the ISIS network that now threatens us all over the globe because they wanted ISIS to be their private fighting force and they gave ISIS management of the Syrian oil wells.
[02:15:10.485 --> 02:15:10.685]  Okay.
[02:15:31.194 --> 02:15:33.375]  Some of our jihadist friends got them.
[02:15:33.375 --> 02:15:37.237]  I guess, you know, it was a spontaneous reaction to a YouTube video.
[02:15:37.237 --> 02:15:40.218]  Well, who was overseeing Libya at the time?
[02:15:40.218 --> 02:15:46.021]  Ghislaine Maxwell's nephew within Hillary Clinton's State Department and Sarah Bronfman and the Bronfman family.
[02:15:46.021 --> 02:15:47.581]  All of these people are connected.
[02:15:47.581 --> 02:15:53.224]  Everything horrible that has happened in the last 20 years or so is all connected to these people.
[02:15:53.224 --> 02:15:55.145]  And now a lot of them are in jail.
[02:15:55.145 --> 02:15:57.666]  And there's also civil war inside Israel.
[02:15:58.246 --> 02:16:06.707]  And I'm not saying Netanyahu is perfect, but clearly the Rothschilds own and run, the economists, they hate Netanyahu worse than they hate Trump.
[02:16:06.707 --> 02:16:07.589]  What's the split there?
[02:16:09.605 --> 02:16:22.335]  Well, you know, Netanyahu supports Trump and, you know, it's, again, it's, you know, there will be people who say, if you point out the Mossad connections to these people, that's somehow anti-Semitic and we have to get out of that.
[02:16:22.335 --> 02:16:23.596]  It's not anti-Semitic.
[02:16:23.596 --> 02:16:24.697]  I'm an Irish guy.
[02:16:24.697 --> 02:16:29.241]  You think I'm going around saying I'm offended if people criticize John Brennan or James Comey?
[02:16:29.241 --> 02:16:33.324]  The intel agencies don't even represent the countries that they're affiliated with anymore.
[02:16:33.744 --> 02:16:37.326]  That's why I was asking the question, not even to defend Israel.
[02:16:37.326 --> 02:16:40.107]  Israel's just a group like the U.S., a bunch of factions.
[02:16:40.107 --> 02:16:47.070]  What I'm saying is it was Omer and other Israeli prime ministers that were there secretly visiting Epstein, obviously running him.
[02:16:47.070 --> 02:16:52.272]  So I was just pointing out there's different factions over there and I wanted to get your take on this particular faction.
[02:16:52.272 --> 02:17:02.877]  Because Bill Gates, we know, is in this faction and was using these networks and he was, you know, controlling Epstein to a great extent to blackmail people and get the scientific elites corrupted.
[02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:06.952]  Well, you know, it's not about ethnicity.
[02:17:06.952 --> 02:17:09.675]  It really is a group of people who... About power?
[02:17:09.675 --> 02:17:14.581]  Yeah, but it's a group of people who believe they're descended from the Nephilim bloodlines, from the fallen angels.
[02:17:14.581 --> 02:17:18.305]  Regardless of whether or not there's any truth to this, this is the network that's been built.
[02:17:18.305 --> 02:17:20.227]  And you have all kinds of different people... Now you're getting at it.
[02:17:20.227 --> 02:17:23.571]  This is a Merovingian cult that they are the god creatures.
[02:17:23.571 --> 02:17:24.012]  Explain this.
[02:17:25.256 --> 02:17:25.316]  And
[02:17:41.273 --> 02:17:44.217]  But it all operates sort of together.
[02:17:44.217 --> 02:17:51.005]  There are different covens, there are different orders of this, but they work... And by the way, that's in all of the WikiLeaks.
[02:17:51.005 --> 02:17:55.972]  This is real stuff about, oh, we need to do a ritual, an Alistair Crowley ritual right now.
[02:17:55.972 --> 02:17:56.893]  I'm sick.
[02:17:56.893 --> 02:17:58.455]  I mean, these people are really a joke.
[02:17:59.966 --> 02:18:03.707]  Yep, and you see the black and white Masonic tiles in every single music video.
[02:18:03.707 --> 02:18:04.768]  This is real stuff.
[02:18:04.768 --> 02:18:10.369]  Now, regardless of whether or not you believe in the supernatural aspect of Lucifer himself, and you know what?
[02:18:10.369 --> 02:18:14.871]  It would make a lot of sense if there was an archangel manipulating all of the minds of these people.
[02:18:14.871 --> 02:18:17.051]  Regardless, they believe that they're serving him.
[02:18:17.051 --> 02:18:18.632]  That's what the child sacrifice is about.
[02:18:18.892 --> 02:18:22.613]  That's what all their symbology is about, and it's all about subverting the Bible.
[02:18:22.613 --> 02:18:23.754]  They're not atheists.
[02:18:23.754 --> 02:18:26.014]  If they were atheists, they wouldn't care about the Bible.
[02:18:26.014 --> 02:18:30.656]  They spend their whole lives like Madonna, mocking the Bible, mocking Christian symbology.
[02:18:30.656 --> 02:18:32.736]  It's all classic black magic rituals.
[02:18:32.736 --> 02:18:34.937]  In closing, you've been a journalist for a long time.
[02:18:34.937 --> 02:18:38.298]  When in your research did you get to the bottom of the rabbit hole at being good versus evil?
[02:18:39.679 --> 02:18:43.140]  Well, I probably started figuring this out about five years ago.
[02:18:43.140 --> 02:18:43.840]  And you know what?
[02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:48.042]  Donald Trump, uh, was instrumental in helping me get there.
[02:18:48.042 --> 02:18:54.184]  I don't want to pretend like I'm really good friends with him, but he, as I said, he was an informant against Epstein.
[02:18:54.184 --> 02:18:58.765]  He's somebody who knows what the power structure is and he wants to take this stuff down.
[02:18:58.765 --> 02:19:06.848]  And there are a lot of good people who want to take this stuff down, but ultimately it's up to citizen journalists, truth tellers, uh, on the outside to use as much power as we can.
[02:19:07.253 --> 02:19:11.415]  In order to get these people, because there's still a ton of corruption inside the government.
[02:19:11.415 --> 02:19:14.057]  That's right, and it's good to see that Trump's getting control of Q again.
[02:19:14.057 --> 02:19:16.038]  For a while it was taken away by the bad guys.
[02:19:16.038 --> 02:19:18.259]  Someday I'll expose the whole thing in a good way.
[02:19:18.259 --> 02:19:20.661]  Patrick Howley, Howley Reporter on Twitter.
[02:19:20.661 --> 02:19:22.021]  Great job, amazing.
[02:19:22.021 --> 02:19:24.243]  Over there at National Falls, say hi to Tom Papert for me.
[02:19:24.243 --> 02:19:25.964]  I'm gonna get you back very, very soon.
[02:19:25.964 --> 02:19:27.244]  Coming up, the Google whistleblower.
[02:19:27.244 --> 02:19:29.086]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:19:29.086 --> 02:19:29.526]  Thank you, Alex.

[02:20:44.891 --> 02:21:02.983]  A consortium of the UNWHO, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and of course the Clinton Global Initiative, headed up by Chelsea Clinton on the board, are in control with Apple and Google with a hidden app on all phones that you cannot turn off.
[02:21:03.383 --> 02:21:10.665]  The track and trace everywhere you go, they claim for COVID, but of course it's really the Chinese communist social score rollout.
[02:21:10.665 --> 02:21:18.587]  These people are sick, filthy criminals, and they want total control over society with the official global ID system.
[02:21:18.587 --> 02:21:21.248]  That's why it's called the Clinton Global Initiative.
[02:21:21.248 --> 02:21:22.288]  But you can fight back.
[02:21:22.668 --> 02:21:25.792]  With the Privacy Pockets at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:21:37.467 --> 02:21:41.431]  Tell the rapist Clintons go to hell and get your Privacy Pockets at InfoWarsTore.
[02:21:42.350 --> 02:21:46.214]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[02:21:46.214 --> 02:21:50.920]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:55.865]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[02:21:55.865 --> 02:21:56.385]  I feel fine.
[02:21:58.311 --> 02:22:02.936]  It's the end of the world as we know it, and I don't feel fine.
[02:22:02.936 --> 02:22:13.968]  This entire takeover has been battle-planned, blueprinted, war-gamed, field-martialed by the psychological war chiefs at the United Nations and the Fortune 100.
[02:22:13.968 --> 02:22:16.050]  This is the post-human takeover.
[02:22:16.050 --> 02:22:19.754]  The noose gets tighter when you comply, not looser.
[02:22:20.535 --> 02:22:23.538]  The entire COVID-19 operation is a hoax.
[02:22:23.538 --> 02:22:28.822]  Now they admit that, quote, death numbers are dropping because those are fake, where they count people that died of something else.
[02:22:28.822 --> 02:22:30.624]  But it's all about how many cases there are.
[02:22:30.624 --> 02:22:34.447]  And now they're saying most of the population will get it.
[02:22:34.447 --> 02:22:36.969]  And then no one can go outside ever again.
[02:22:36.969 --> 02:22:39.111]  It's totally insane.
[02:22:39.111 --> 02:22:40.252]  It's a fraud.
[02:22:40.252 --> 02:22:44.955]  It's all a lie.
[02:22:44.955 --> 02:22:47.618]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:15.168 --> 02:23:19.451]  Well, Greg Coppola is one of the biggest Google whistleblowers so far to go public.
[02:23:19.451 --> 02:23:23.593]  He committed horrible thought crime when he said that they had a political bias.
[02:23:23.593 --> 02:23:26.935]  He said the sky again was blue and that fish swim in the ocean.
[02:23:26.935 --> 02:23:41.424]  Thinkdifferentagain.art and revelations.live and he's launched a new social network, Deep Revelations is the first independent social network to use the advanced machine learning to compete on even technology terms with the big players.
[02:23:42.404 --> 02:23:45.005]  So a lot of exciting things going on out there.
[02:23:45.005 --> 02:23:57.590]  And there were supposedly today going to have the big tech leaders, the guys that run our lives, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg.
[02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:59.791]  They were going to be meeting in DC.
[02:23:59.791 --> 02:24:02.872]  And I told my crew, I said, yeah, we're not going.
[02:24:02.872 --> 02:24:07.034]  They're going to cancel it a couple of times to throw off anybody trying to go cover it.
[02:24:07.034 --> 02:24:08.835]  And then I said, I bet one of them shows up.
[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:13.581]  But they all coordinate.
[02:24:13.581 --> 02:24:17.121]  But I bet that the others are all virtual.
[02:24:17.121 --> 02:24:20.142]  Because they hate it when I go up there and confront them and others do.
[02:24:20.142 --> 02:24:23.642]  That's why they also want this whole virtual system so you're locked down and can't even leave your house.
[02:24:23.642 --> 02:24:28.863]  So they can be up on their Mount Olympus or Elysium fields and we're just down here little slaves.
[02:24:28.863 --> 02:24:29.843]  And they're all globalists.
[02:24:29.843 --> 02:24:32.284]  They all help have Chinese slave labor.
[02:24:32.284 --> 02:24:34.704]  They all help the Chinese death camps.
[02:24:34.704 --> 02:24:38.465]  But the two worst ones are Sundar Pichai, who's a puppet of
[02:24:39.915 --> 02:24:43.097]  The former head of Alphabet, Schmidt.
[02:24:43.097 --> 02:24:47.120]  And then, of course, you've got Tim Cook up there, who's just an absolute monster.
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:55.066]  But these individuals, again, have set up Monopoly Trust, they're working in coordination, and they're helping China run death camps.
[02:24:55.066 --> 02:24:57.468]  So never wonder what they'll do to you if they have their way.
[02:24:57.468 --> 02:24:58.989]  Anything!
[02:24:58.989 --> 02:25:02.872]  These people are completely selfish, completely out of control.
[02:25:02.872 --> 02:25:04.853]  So Greg joins us.
[02:25:04.853 --> 02:25:07.956]  He is an experienced software engineer and founder of Think Different Again, a dramatic
[02:25:09.406 --> 02:25:12.029]  Start up the social media space.
[02:25:12.029 --> 02:25:22.218]  Greg has made headlines again in 2019 with a senior software engineer at Google who had been placed on administrative leave for 24 hours after publicly suggesting the company is politically biased.
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:24.862]  This is not even allowed to have speech.
[02:25:24.862 --> 02:25:38.999]  Greg Coppola went on to expose Google's dishonest methods and practices among them, which are political bias, boosting and de-boosting search results from civic websites, perjury of Google CEO Sundar Pichai to Congress, and other questionable company processes.
[02:25:38.999 --> 02:25:40.461]  So he joins us now.
[02:25:40.461 --> 02:25:41.322]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:25:41.322 --> 02:25:42.544]  What do you want to tackle first?
[02:25:45.039 --> 02:25:58.665]  Hey Alex, yeah, so basically, yeah, I've been working on a startup for almost a year now, so that's really what I'm focused on, I guess, is the future and, well, yeah, I've thought very deeply about the problem.
[02:25:58.665 --> 02:26:04.888]  I mean, I think there's, I think it's important to have an ensemble of approaches, you know, public and private.
[02:26:04.888 --> 02:26:14.072]  I think we need a fair environment to compete, similar to how, say, basketball teams are provided a fair environment to compete by the NBA, but they're not told how to play by the NBA.
[02:26:15.138 --> 02:26:28.202]  For example, Michael Jordan is someone that Joe Rogan holds up as this, you know, real intense genius who was able to transcend what was previously possible, you know, and play basketball better than anyone really had.
[02:26:28.202 --> 02:26:30.202]  And that comes from his own internal passion.
[02:26:30.202 --> 02:26:31.282]  That can't be regulated.
[02:26:31.282 --> 02:26:36.564]  But what they do need to do, you know, like in basketball, is make sure nobody's showing up with a bat and just breaking kneecaps before the game.
[02:26:36.564 --> 02:26:40.525]  That's destructive competitiveness rather than constructive competitiveness.
[02:26:41.383 --> 02:26:44.467]  But I think, you know, so I've really been focusing on what can we do from the private sector?
[02:26:44.467 --> 02:26:46.229]  What can we do from a technological perspective?
[02:26:46.229 --> 02:26:48.732]  Because that's the most thing that's under my control.
[02:26:48.732 --> 02:26:50.114]  And I think there's a lot of optimism.
[02:26:50.114 --> 02:26:54.279]  Like I said, I just launched my my first social network.
[02:26:54.279 --> 02:26:56.442]  It's kind of like an advanced version of Reddit.
[02:26:56.442 --> 02:26:58.264]  It's like Reddit driven by deep learning.
[02:26:58.264 --> 02:26:59.565]  There's no one really on it yet, but it's
[02:27:00.725 --> 02:27:04.050]  You know, it's all set up and ready to go, these deep learning algorithms.
[02:27:04.050 --> 02:27:06.874]  It's like, once you start putting the data in there, that's when they start to go.
[02:27:06.874 --> 02:27:07.195]  Got it.
[02:27:07.195 --> 02:27:08.597]  So, it's a field of dreams.
[02:27:08.597 --> 02:27:10.901]  People come, it'll be there, it'll manifest.
[02:27:10.901 --> 02:27:11.542]  People should do that.
[02:27:11.542 --> 02:27:15.247]  I know I'm going to try to get involved, but pulling back since you were here with us last year.
[02:27:17.003 --> 02:27:19.864]  Obviously Google now, everybody knows is controlling things.
[02:27:19.864 --> 02:27:21.305]  Big Tech is openly doing it.
[02:27:21.305 --> 02:27:22.606]  Twitter is openly doing it.
[02:27:22.606 --> 02:27:24.167]  They're openly meddling in the election.
[02:27:24.167 --> 02:27:26.148]  What do you think Congress should do?
[02:27:26.148 --> 02:27:28.449]  What do you think the President should do?
[02:27:28.449 --> 02:27:36.873]  Should they just sit back and let Big Tech become bigger and more powerful than the government and the country and then take over the planet and merge with the Chai-coms?
[02:27:36.873 --> 02:27:38.954]  Well, it certainly does take time to produce software.
[02:27:38.954 --> 02:27:40.435]  That's one thing that has to be recognized.
[02:27:40.435 --> 02:27:42.876]  It's the so-called minimum irreducible number of errors.
[02:27:43.997 --> 02:27:44.157]  I don't
[02:28:00.985 --> 02:28:07.489]  Um, Sundar Pichai's testimony to Congress and it did sort of strike me as though it's not clear when they ask him, are you guys politically biased?
[02:28:07.489 --> 02:28:11.551]  Are they asking him to define what bias is or does the government know what bias is?
[02:28:11.551 --> 02:28:18.935]  I mean, I know how I would define bias in terms of like, um, uh, the same conditions that would, you would run a t-test for in, uh, in undergrad psychology.
[02:28:18.935 --> 02:28:26.160]  Exactly, what you said is it's all lawyering and it's all subjective and it's all how they define things and that's how they tell these whopper of lies.
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:28.121]  And so we need to have real definitions.
[02:28:29.346 --> 02:28:34.690]  Yeah, well normally that's, you know, when someone's on trial, they're not being asked the meaning of the words and whether or not they've done something.
[02:28:34.690 --> 02:28:38.993]  They're just being asked whether or not they've done something according to fixed meanings of the words.
[02:28:38.993 --> 02:28:43.757]  And maybe that's one of the things right now, is there's not clarity on what bias is.
[02:28:43.757 --> 02:28:48.020]  And if government is having a hard time defining statistical bias, then that's one more argument of why
[02:28:48.413 --> 02:28:55.454]  They shouldn't be doing too much other than creating a level playing field because, you know, people are just thinking a lot faster in the private sector than in the public.
[02:28:55.454 --> 02:29:06.096]  Well, that's the big one, is you've got the big banks behind all this, blocking startups, trying to take down Gab, trying to take us down, giving us a hate rating when I have perfect credit, so we lose merchant accounts.
[02:29:06.096 --> 02:29:12.657]  I mean, this is stuff like the Nazis did to the Jews, taking their bank accounts away or their right to, you know, have a shop or a storefront.
[02:29:12.657 --> 02:29:14.198]  Is that big tech and
[02:29:15.578 --> 02:29:20.642]  Twitter buying up all the digital currency and all the online banking systems.
[02:29:20.642 --> 02:29:26.987]  They're creating monopolies and with their cancel culture now in the third dimension even trying to stop people's speech.
[02:29:26.987 --> 02:29:38.677]  I mean this is an authoritarian combine leveraging its power and you've got the aged lawyers who all are delusional up there on Capitol Hill who have no idea what they've just been hit by.
[02:29:38.677 --> 02:29:40.758]  I mean the separation between
[02:29:41.579 --> 02:29:52.967]  Montezuma and the Aztecs and the Conguistadors was very close compared to this giant gulf of these old stupid lawyers that have no idea that A.I.
[02:29:52.967 --> 02:29:56.850]  has taken over the whole planet and merged with the Chicoms.
[02:29:58.854 --> 02:30:07.800]  Yeah, I mean, I think one of the most concrete things they could do positive actions would be to make sure we all have access to the same supply chains, the same computational resources that we all know.
[02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:09.081]  We're not losing our dot com.
[02:30:09.081 --> 02:30:10.982]  We're not being banned off the App Store.
[02:30:10.982 --> 02:30:14.144]  We're not being having any of these things removed.
[02:30:14.144 --> 02:30:19.788]  I think we can't get into the game of, you know, like if they take our electricity away, then we have to build the electricity company.
[02:30:19.788 --> 02:30:21.009]  And then when it comes down to banks,
[02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:23.021]  You know, banking is regulated in and of itself.
[02:30:23.021 --> 02:30:25.842]  Like, we weren't allowed to start crypto banks because that's regulated.
[02:30:25.842 --> 02:30:29.803]  So then, for people to get kicked off of banking systems, you know, that shouldn't be allowed, I think.
[02:30:29.803 --> 02:30:38.066]  But GAAB is a great example because, you know, it's like GAAB has an information retrieval product, Google has an information retrieval product, but Google also has the App Store.
[02:30:38.066 --> 02:30:42.068]  And then, one day, Google told GAAB, well, you're not allowed to be on the App Store.
[02:30:42.068 --> 02:30:46.230]  And at that time, the App Store was required for being considered professional.
[02:30:46.230 --> 02:30:49.991]  You know, and I think at that time, GAAB was not the most advanced software, but same thing with
[02:30:50.421 --> 02:30:54.004]  You know, when Larry Page started, like, he didn't write the best software himself.
[02:30:54.004 --> 02:30:55.365]  He just proved the concept.
[02:30:55.365 --> 02:30:58.307]  And then he had some of these classic all-star engineers join the team.
[02:30:58.307 --> 02:30:59.128]  Well, that's it.
[02:30:59.128 --> 02:31:02.090]  Look, Big Tech doesn't just buy up thousands of competiting companies.
[02:31:02.090 --> 02:31:07.394]  They shut them down and block them off of their monopolies, which is un-American, dangerous, and criminal.
[02:31:10.137 --> 02:31:21.053]  Yeah, and also with respect to Gab, I'm also releasing the source code of my social network, and my main thing is I want to teach based on this social network.
[02:31:21.053 --> 02:31:23.737]  I recently took Ryan Rose's Business Accelerator class.
[02:31:24.073 --> 02:31:31.758]  And I saw people selling all these different kind of digital products and Kevin O'Leary says he also sees this digital America emerging.
[02:31:31.758 --> 02:31:36.721]  I think this is the beginning of Web 3.0 if we can push it through and it's going to be more.
[02:31:36.721 --> 02:31:46.888]  My vision is more horizontal integration, smaller companies with less hierarchical depth competing and cooperating within an ecosystem of platforms that are
[02:31:48.010 --> 02:31:49.671]  More fair and more distributed.
[02:31:49.671 --> 02:31:59.543]  So instead of vertical integration, horizontal integration which will create real diversity in Web 3.0, so you believe their attempt at censorship is going to force the new renaissance?
[02:32:00.933 --> 02:32:08.839]  Well, I think there are three technological disruptive forces that are pushing things towards smaller companies, and maybe this is one reason why there's so much anti-competitive.
[02:32:08.839 --> 02:32:14.303]  Maybe they acknowledge, maybe they see the writing on the wall that, like when, you know, the mainframe... Hold on!
[02:32:14.303 --> 02:32:16.305]  You're on... This is so key what you're saying.
[02:32:16.305 --> 02:32:16.805]  Exactly.
[02:32:16.805 --> 02:32:24.270]  Their old order, their old system is coming down, and all of this is an attempt to scare us and put us back into a dark age, but nothing...
[02:32:25.131 --> 02:32:27.473]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[02:32:53.402 --> 02:32:58.785]  Where did it come from?

[02:33:41.647 --> 02:33:57.220]  CNN, USA Today, and other mainstream media fake news outlets came out and said that a new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings standing on top of an American flag is Nazi!
[02:33:57.220 --> 02:34:05.107]  And they had the Soros-funded Snopes groups and others fact-check it and say, yes, now the American flag and yes, the American eagle are Nazis.
[02:34:05.107 --> 02:34:06.168]  No, George Soros,
[02:34:06.448 --> 02:34:07.209]  We're good to go.
[02:34:27.109 --> 02:34:29.392]  These shirts are at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:29.392 --> 02:34:32.115]  They're the American Eagle Betsy Ross flags.
[02:34:32.115 --> 02:34:36.701]  Two different designs, guaranteed to spread the word, and of course, trigger lip tarts everywhere.

[02:34:42.270 --> 02:34:44.852]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[02:34:44.852 --> 02:34:57.663]  And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict,
[02:34:58.183 --> 02:34:58.603]  I think?
[02:35:18.234 --> 02:35:22.197]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[02:35:22.197 --> 02:35:27.442]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate-level blueprint documents.
[02:35:27.442 --> 02:35:35.308]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[02:35:35.308 --> 02:35:39.131]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[02:35:39.131 --> 02:35:41.193]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[02:35:43.697 --> 02:35:46.278]  Available for shipping within three to four weeks.

[02:35:50.379 --> 02:35:54.281]  Some items are shipping in a week some in four weeks So they're saying three to four weeks.
[02:35:54.281 --> 02:35:55.321]  It's my Patriot.
[02:35:55.321 --> 02:35:56.381]  We have their full catalog.

[02:36:09.486 --> 02:36:17.450]  Whether Trump wins or loses, the globalists have already created a worldwide depression, lockdowns on a planetary scale, and it's only intensifying.
[02:36:17.450 --> 02:36:20.631]  This is one of the big boxes you've got to get checked off.
[02:36:20.631 --> 02:36:22.092]  It's high-quality, affordable food.

[02:36:32.436 --> 02:36:38.799]  And then, the money that comes in that's extra helps us fund the information warfare operation that fights the globalists toe-to-toe.
[02:36:39.339 --> 02:37:00.554]  When I grow up, I want to see humanity go interplanetary, interdimensional.
[02:37:00.554 --> 02:37:02.635]  I want to see us build a pro-human universe.
[02:37:02.635 --> 02:37:05.357]  But we're going to have to fight for it.
[02:37:06.837 --> 02:37:21.501]  We now take you live to the front lines of the information war with Greg Coppola of ThinkDifferentAgain.org and Revelations.Live.
[02:37:21.501 --> 02:37:27.923]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:37:27.923 --> 02:37:30.264]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:37:36.533 --> 02:37:41.455]  All right, Greg, really exciting that you've launched revelations.live and we're excited you're here talking about it.
[02:37:41.455 --> 02:37:56.623]  I want you to get some into that, but get back into this, not vertical integration, but horizontal integration and the chance if people start supporting other platforms to really take the power away from big tech, just like our ancestors, you know, left countries that weren't as free.
[02:37:57.483 --> 02:38:00.464]  Or places that weren't as free to try to build something that was freer.
[02:38:00.464 --> 02:38:06.045]  Doesn't mean we didn't bring the problems with us, didn't mean that we created a utopia, but it did create something better.
[02:38:06.045 --> 02:38:08.286]  And so that process is happening now.
[02:38:08.286 --> 02:38:11.827]  Let's talk about it.
[02:38:11.827 --> 02:38:21.649]  Well, I've been like studying a variety of different topics, and I think, you know, one interesting thing is that the Amazon assistant has a lot more
[02:38:22.978 --> 02:38:23.358]  Thank you.
[02:38:46.625 --> 02:38:52.687]  Um, internally, the reasons for this are they've actually been known since really the 1970s.
[02:38:52.687 --> 02:39:00.329]  I think there was a book called The Mythical Man-Month, which is called the Bible of Software Engineering, and it was written in 1975 by Frederick Brooks.
[02:39:00.329 --> 02:39:03.991]  And I've been reviewing Brooks books back till then to kind of understand what's going on.
[02:39:03.991 --> 02:39:04.051]  And
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:12.167]  It starts with the assumption that I've noticed that Google Assistant language understanding isn't really any better in 2020 than it was in 2012.
[02:39:12.167 --> 02:39:15.992]  So I would contend there's been eight years of stagnation there.
[02:39:15.992 --> 02:39:21.418]  And as I reflected on the experience, I started to look back in history for what might be known about
[02:39:22.125 --> 02:39:32.549]  Software teams and we find that like software teams have a difficulty in growing because of the communication costs are so high and cost a lot to onboard somebody and then it costs a lot to keep them in the loop.
[02:39:32.549 --> 02:39:39.771]  So the original way this manifested was that they noticed that when you add new engineers to a late project that we usually just make it later.
[02:39:41.310 --> 02:39:44.032]  And that's because it costs so much communication to bring them on board.
[02:39:44.032 --> 02:39:48.413]  If they can't contribute, you've actually just, you've lost rather than gained by having more people.
[02:39:48.413 --> 02:39:56.997]  And, you know, a corollary for this is that companies can really only grow to a certain size before, like, there's just too much time wasted on communication.
[02:39:56.997 --> 02:39:59.418]  And this is something Steve Jobs really understood.
[02:39:59.418 --> 02:40:01.319]  He's an engineering hero of mine.
[02:40:01.319 --> 02:40:06.221]  I mean, obviously we all have many sides to us, but he's an engineering hero of mine.
[02:40:07.256 --> 02:40:10.498]  For sure, and he would always cite this book called The Mythical Man-Month.
[02:40:10.498 --> 02:40:16.402]  Now, I have this quip in my mind that maybe Google threw out all their copies because it had the word man in it.
[02:40:16.402 --> 02:40:19.364]  And then they forgot the last one.
[02:40:19.364 --> 02:40:22.266]  Yeah, that's the whole attack on humanity itself.
[02:40:22.266 --> 02:40:23.487]  Please continue.
[02:40:23.487 --> 02:40:29.851]  Well, it is interesting to think though, once upon a time they had the word manpower because if you really, let's say you had lumberjacks chopping down the forest, that was
[02:40:30.370 --> 02:40:34.953]  The Lumberjacks really were the manpower, whereas now the engineers are programming the computers.
[02:40:34.953 --> 02:40:45.481]  So it's almost like even an entry level, even a child who's just learned to use a computer is almost like a manager of people chopping wood.
[02:40:45.481 --> 02:40:52.806]  Or if you think about a construction site, no one ever walks off the ground floor of a construction site and then starts their own construction site.
[02:40:52.806 --> 02:40:53.826]  But tech is very different.
[02:40:53.826 --> 02:40:55.107]  So there's a number of reasons for that.
[02:40:55.107 --> 02:40:57.329]  But tech really does favor, I think,
[02:40:58.151 --> 02:41:05.423]  I wouldn't say single people in their garage, but there's, you know, even in 1975, they were already asking, well, if all the new products really start in garages...
[02:41:06.258 --> 02:41:07.499]  Like Hewlett-Packard did in 1939.
[02:41:07.499 --> 02:41:10.281]  That was the first garage that started the whole thing.
[02:41:10.281 --> 02:41:11.622]  And you really hit on something here.
[02:41:11.622 --> 02:41:17.546]  They want AI to take over because these big centralized things like Yahoo or others start declining.
[02:41:17.546 --> 02:41:22.930]  So they keep imagining some mythic AI that they program that will consolidate it and run it all for them.
[02:41:22.930 --> 02:41:28.094]  But then it goes back to social control wanting us to behave a certain way so the AI can control us.
[02:41:28.094 --> 02:41:29.535]  So it's really kind of an oxymoron.
[02:41:31.135 --> 02:41:39.300]  Yeah, I don't think there's been much technological advancement in the last decade, and this is something Peter Thiel, who's one of my favorite software philosophers, he brings up.
[02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:48.145]  He distinguishes two axes of development, what he calls technology on the vertical axis, and he says globalization on the x-axis.
[02:41:48.145 --> 02:41:53.329]  Technology means that you learn to do something that you've never been able to do before, and globalization means you just take that and you port it somewhere else.
[02:41:53.329 --> 02:41:56.010]  So like the first time the television was invented, that's technology.
[02:41:56.010 --> 02:41:58.592]  The first time it was made in Japan, that's globalization.
[02:41:58.592 --> 02:42:00.073]  I would generalize that to say there's
[02:42:00.553 --> 02:42:14.525]  Sure, and I don't think we want global adoption of centralized AI systems.
[02:42:14.525 --> 02:42:15.145]  That's the goal.
[02:42:15.145 --> 02:42:17.427]  That will kill innovation from the beginning.
[02:42:17.427 --> 02:42:29.137]  I mean, it's one thing if people want to adopt something and adopt something better later, but this globalist system wants to make global adoption forced and then make it basically be a separated civilization.
[02:42:32.223 --> 02:42:33.484]  I mean, yeah, I don't know what to say about that.
[02:42:33.484 --> 02:42:44.311]  But I do think that there's a certain level at which vertical integration doesn't work because, like, imagine, like, what most people would say about the Google Assistant is that they have very good speech recognition, but they don't have very good language understanding.
[02:42:44.311 --> 02:42:47.633]  And so there's no way, like, for the speech recognition to sort of be reused if...
[02:42:48.348 --> 02:42:52.311]  You know, if you have 10 different projects and one is failing, that could lead to the failure of all of them.
[02:42:52.311 --> 02:42:58.337]  Sure, what I'm talking about is with a global social score, forced adoption of certain systems over others.
[02:42:58.337 --> 02:43:07.605]  Fundamentally, the modern globalist system actually doesn't want to have classical globalization or adoption because something works and is superior.
[02:43:07.605 --> 02:43:13.790]  They want to force tyranny through the very architecture of it, is what I'm saying.
[02:43:13.790 --> 02:43:15.972]  Well, I think I see it as, yeah, I mean, just
[02:43:16.578 --> 02:43:20.410]  I see it mostly manifesting as just attacks on the supply chain, including the rule of law.
[02:43:20.410 --> 02:43:23.199]  I mean, that's part of the supply chain normally of starting a new business.
[02:43:24.389 --> 02:43:26.590]  You know, being able to go to a city like L.A.
[02:43:26.590 --> 02:43:32.473]  or New York or San Francisco, you know, and travel around safely.
[02:43:32.473 --> 02:43:35.735]  We have so much of the normal supply chain is not there.
[02:43:35.735 --> 02:43:45.180]  If we had the full supply chain, we could easily start... That's what I'm saying is, and big tech, the way it's set up, is dissolving the regular supply chains and consolidating power.
[02:43:45.180 --> 02:43:49.382]  And if we have everybody working from home, then that's not going to build the infrastructure anymore.
[02:43:49.382 --> 02:43:51.723]  Complex infrastructures build complex infrastructures.
[02:43:51.983 --> 02:44:01.929]  You quote simplify infrastructures and say you're trying to cut the carbon of a carbon-based planet, you're actually destroying the infrastructure and creating a new dark age, which is the Club of Rome plan.
[02:44:01.929 --> 02:44:08.853]  So I'm projecting the political desires of the establishment rulers onto what you mathematically are looking at as an equation.
[02:44:08.853 --> 02:44:10.274]  And I'm saying the two things are different.
[02:44:10.274 --> 02:44:11.655]  Does that make sense?
[02:44:11.655 --> 02:44:12.555]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:44:12.555 --> 02:44:17.338]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not really here to ascribe motivations, but I do think that there's a limit to how much vertical integration can work.
[02:44:17.338 --> 02:44:18.339]  I mean, otherwise, like,
[02:44:19.036 --> 02:44:22.380]  You know, like, in 2012, you know, on the Google Assistant, you could set an alarm.
[02:44:22.380 --> 02:44:23.381]  And today, you can set an alarm.
[02:44:23.381 --> 02:44:25.924]  And that's, you know, not what's happened in the meantime.
[02:44:25.924 --> 02:44:28.627]  Like, in eight years, you know, and like, how long are we going to go without any?
[02:44:28.627 --> 02:44:31.090]  The real innovation is social control with the tracking.
[02:44:31.090 --> 02:44:38.079]  I mean, all the real innovation is we've got the Trojan horse, but the soldiers they're loading into it to enslave us are getting more powerful.
[02:44:39.505 --> 02:44:47.876]  Well, but that's not even really new technology, that's old technology just used in another way, so that's... No, but I'm saying they're rolling out the predatory angles of it now.
[02:44:47.876 --> 02:44:54.304]  We're accepting the bad, oppressive, classical tyrannies that these things deliver to us.
[02:44:56.943 --> 02:44:58.123]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:44:58.123 --> 02:45:02.024]  There's very little interest in, like, freedom.
[02:45:02.024 --> 02:45:02.944]  I mean, I'm in Canada.
[02:45:02.944 --> 02:45:08.926]  You know, there's been a big change in the culture from when I was young when we were sort of in charge to, like, now it's more like the government's in charge.
[02:45:08.926 --> 02:45:11.446]  There's just a different culture of, like... A technocracy!
[02:45:11.446 --> 02:45:12.246]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:45:12.246 --> 02:45:19.228]  So how do you deal with a technocracy that doesn't want innovation, that doesn't want freedom, that wants stagnation, and wants a public taught to just go play video games?
[02:45:20.939 --> 02:45:22.460]  I think, yeah, we are at a decision point.
[02:45:22.460 --> 02:45:30.003]  I mean, if we could choose stagnation, it might not, you know, like, people have forgotten the classic lessons of software engineering, I think, in my generation.
[02:45:30.003 --> 02:45:38.307]  And, like, if they're not remembered, you know, I'm not even sure who's going to build, I'm not sure really what the end game is.
[02:45:38.307 --> 02:45:42.488]  Like, my thesis is, like, okay, so Mark Zuckerberg made Facebook at, like, 18 or whatever.
[02:45:42.488 --> 02:45:47.931]  Shouldn't we have many 18-year-olds who are ready to just bursting out and making their own companies, even just trying?
[02:45:47.931 --> 02:45:48.991]  I mean, they must be at home, right?
[02:45:48.991 --> 02:45:49.912]  Or they must be in the dorm room.
[02:45:51.101 --> 02:45:59.443]  What's really stopping them unless there's just something like, you know, we're lowering our capabilities just overall at the adult level and at the child level.
[02:45:59.443 --> 02:46:02.484]  And that's why we, you know, where are the 18 year olds that are making their own products?
[02:46:02.484 --> 02:46:03.104]  Well, that's it.
[02:46:03.104 --> 02:46:04.824]  You're using technology to build things.
[02:46:04.824 --> 02:46:09.505]  They're using it to beat themselves over the head where we do all these micro decisions all day that don't matter.
[02:46:09.505 --> 02:46:16.927]  And the technology is designed, as Sean Parker said, to exploit our weaknesses and take over our lives and make us miserable.
[02:46:18.993 --> 02:46:25.520]  Yeah, we should really, you know, I mean, I often say we don't want to stagnate and people might be thinking like, well, I mean, everything's moving so fast right now.
[02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:26.261]  I kind of want to break.
[02:46:26.261 --> 02:46:29.044]  But stagnation doesn't mean like that you're hanging out at the lake.
[02:46:29.044 --> 02:46:33.368]  Stagnation can manifest itself as just a lot of churn.
[02:46:33.368 --> 02:46:39.595]  And and for kids, I mean, like we grew up in a I'm more or less the same age as Mark Zuckerberg and we grew up in a great age because we had like
[02:46:40.578 --> 02:46:43.579]  You know, in the 90s, let's say, like, I was on DOS computers.
[02:46:43.579 --> 02:46:44.299]  They were very simple.
[02:46:44.299 --> 02:46:46.480]  I could understand what the program was doing.
[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:47.601]  I could write those programs myself.
[02:46:47.601 --> 02:46:48.061]  I used to do that.
[02:46:48.061 --> 02:46:52.663]  You had the old world and the new world, but you got to see behind the curtain.
[02:46:52.663 --> 02:47:06.488]  Yeah, it's very interesting, and I think, like, with the kids today, like, their phones can do so much, and then the control, like, interface they have on their phone is so weak that there's, like, it must seem like just complete magic what's happening, and, you know, maybe we're not going to get
[02:47:07.805 --> 02:47:09.666]  Engineers like... Exactly!
[02:47:09.666 --> 02:47:14.010]  They're accepting it just as something that's there, like a lake they're gonna go swimming in.
[02:47:14.010 --> 02:47:15.752]  They're not thinking about what goes into the lake.
[02:47:15.752 --> 02:47:20.977]  And so they're becoming cogs of the machine itself, not users of the machine.
[02:47:20.977 --> 02:47:27.402]  Let's talk about the launch of this new social network, Revelations.Live, and I've got big breaking news.
[02:47:27.402 --> 02:47:27.823]  Stay with us.
[02:47:31.016 --> 02:47:41.826]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history, that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[02:47:41.826 --> 02:47:51.034]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[02:47:51.394 --> 02:48:05.565]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[02:48:05.565 --> 02:48:19.776]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the Earth and we need to be culled and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[02:48:20.236 --> 02:48:21.917]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[02:48:21.917 --> 02:48:28.601]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[02:48:28.601 --> 02:48:30.362]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[02:48:32.498 --> 02:48:35.279]  We close and lock our doors and windows at night.
[02:48:35.279 --> 02:48:38.680]  Not because we're doing anything wrong, but because it's about privacy.
[02:48:38.680 --> 02:48:40.680]  And it's about security.
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:43.401]  And it's something that we do to protect ourselves.
[02:48:43.401 --> 02:48:50.503]  Going back thousands of years, when we would post a dog or a sentry at the entrance of the village, so we would know if predators or criminals were coming.
[02:48:50.503 --> 02:48:58.145]  Well, big tech, along with the federal government and other globalist organizations, have been tracking everybody illegally for years with their cell phones.
[02:48:58.505 --> 02:48:59.726]  We're good to go.
[02:49:18.814 --> 02:49:19.914]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:49:48.297 --> 02:49:50.398]  Greg Coppola is our guest.
[02:49:50.398 --> 02:49:59.023]  Got a lot of courage, left Google, exposed their corruption, and he's fighting back with Think Different, again, .art and revelations.live.
[02:49:59.023 --> 02:50:00.484]  And how do people get involved?
[02:50:00.484 --> 02:50:01.605]  How does it work?
[02:50:01.605 --> 02:50:02.505]  Looks pretty exciting.
[02:50:02.505 --> 02:50:07.268]  How do I get signed up at revelations.live?
[02:50:07.268 --> 02:50:15.353]  Well, it looks to be, yeah, the website seems to be standing up, and if you go to revelations.live, you can put your email in there, and then I will
[02:50:18.835 --> 02:50:24.438]  I will be inviting people to join the first version of the network, and then we'll get a few people in there, and then eventually I'll let other people invite.
[02:50:24.438 --> 02:50:28.200]  So you're in beta right now, and you're kind of launching it right now?
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:28.860]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:50:28.860 --> 02:50:32.282]  Basically, we're kind of just starting up.
[02:50:32.282 --> 02:50:34.984]  So there's a bunch of things on this website.
[02:50:34.984 --> 02:50:36.344]  So first of all, there's the website itself.
[02:50:36.344 --> 02:50:37.005]  It's going to be great.
[02:50:37.005 --> 02:50:39.086]  It's going to be like an advanced version of Reddit.
[02:50:39.086 --> 02:50:41.267]  It's not going to suffer from the brigading problem.
[02:50:41.267 --> 02:50:42.508]  We can get into that another time.
[02:50:42.508 --> 02:50:44.709]  You're not going to take $300 million from the Chinese government?
[02:50:46.428 --> 02:51:02.303]  That's right and it's also it's gonna be managed like in the West rather than in China and it's but it's gonna be like they just like reddit is just adding ones and zeros I mean and ones and minus one you know that's like antiquated stuff is gonna be blowed away it's using neural nets we're gonna have a we're gonna represent you as a number in a multi-dimensional space
[02:51:03.070 --> 02:51:06.091]  If you don't know about neural nets, then this is going to be a good way for you to learn about them.
[02:51:06.091 --> 02:51:10.933]  And then on top of that, what I'm doing is I'm giving away the code, and I want to sell courses on the back of that.
[02:51:10.933 --> 02:51:14.875]  There's this whole zoomification, online-ification going on of education.
[02:51:14.875 --> 02:51:17.516]  A lot of people are saying they want more capacity.
[02:51:17.516 --> 02:51:21.218]  Even Eric Schmidt is building a parallel university to Stanford and MIT.
[02:51:21.218 --> 02:51:31.902]  I think a lot of people see that if you go through all the way up to high school, and then you go through undergrad, if you're on an antiquated program, you know, then you're still going to have to learn machine learning at the end, so you'll have to do another program at the end of that to learn the modern technologies.
[02:51:32.282 --> 02:51:41.911]  I think we can just start with kids, teaching them straight in the line, like, look how to maintain this social network, and then you'll learn about databases, you'll learn about networks, you'll learn about user interface.
[02:51:41.911 --> 02:51:43.613]  At the final point, you'll learn about deep learning.
[02:51:43.613 --> 02:51:44.814]  And that's the modern stack.
[02:51:44.814 --> 02:51:50.959]  Software engineering really has changed so much.
[02:51:50.959 --> 02:51:53.682]  And I've just spent the past year really modernizing my skills.
[02:51:53.682 --> 02:51:56.805]  So my model is really I want to teach people.
[02:51:57.885 --> 02:51:59.285]  So you can use this network.
[02:51:59.285 --> 02:51:59.846]  It's going to be cool.
[02:51:59.846 --> 02:52:00.726]  You can download the network.
[02:52:00.726 --> 02:52:02.946]  You can try it.
[02:52:02.946 --> 02:52:07.067]  So there's all these different related enterprises that are going on.
[02:52:07.067 --> 02:52:10.788]  But to start with, go to revelations.live and put your email in.
[02:52:10.788 --> 02:52:14.970]  It asks for your name and some interests just so that we can tell the bots from the non-bots.
[02:52:17.051 --> 02:52:21.656]  And then, you know, we'll get those emails, like, from there we can go with the email list.
[02:52:21.656 --> 02:52:23.478]  Even email, incidentally, can be blocked.
[02:52:23.478 --> 02:52:27.182]  You know, email is another point of failure because of the spam detection.
[02:52:27.182 --> 02:52:31.688]  But if we create an email list, we should be able to go from there.
[02:52:32.526 --> 02:52:34.807]  All right, well, I'm going to try to get my guys to sign up with you.
[02:52:34.807 --> 02:52:44.449]  Maybe you can help us along, because we like to be one of the first groups when you actually launch the platform, because we really need to understand that it's been social engineering.
[02:52:44.449 --> 02:52:49.491]  So many people two years ago, when we got totally banned, said, hey, we really like you, but we're not going to have you on our interview.
[02:52:49.491 --> 02:52:50.471]  We don't want to get banned next.
[02:52:50.471 --> 02:52:51.791]  And I'd say, you'll be banned within six months.
[02:52:51.791 --> 02:52:52.131]  They called.
[02:52:52.131 --> 02:52:53.352]  Did you talk to an insider?
[02:52:53.352 --> 02:52:54.432]  I said, no, they want to get you, too.
[02:52:54.952 --> 02:52:55.972]  And they're going to get everybody.
[02:52:55.972 --> 02:53:01.134]  So they do it incrementally so that the crowd of sheep still don't stand up.
[02:53:01.134 --> 02:53:04.354]  And so by the time they get them, the next group doesn't stand up, the next group.
[02:53:04.354 --> 02:53:11.696]  And so first it's the nationalists, and the conservatives, and the Christians, then the patriots, then the populists, and then the, you know, the classical liberals.
[02:53:11.696 --> 02:53:19.398]  And now it's just a total takeover, and people need to stand up against it in general and stop living on their knees.
[02:53:22.840 --> 02:53:24.695]  Yeah, I mean, um, like...
[02:53:25.498 --> 02:53:31.282]  You know, I sort of spoke, oh, last year, because I did kind of feel like if I waited till this year, I would just be lost in the noise, which is true.
[02:53:31.282 --> 02:53:36.685]  And then the good side effect from that, which seemed like a principled stand at the time, was like, I found a new way of life now.
[02:53:36.685 --> 02:53:41.048]  Otherwise, I would have still been in midtown Manhattan dealing with the crime there.
[02:53:41.048 --> 02:53:43.609]  And, you know, I would have been trapped in my small apartment.
[02:53:43.609 --> 02:53:49.213]  And now I've got to say, I mean, you look really nervous and unhappy and unhealthy when you were on this last year.
[02:53:49.213 --> 02:53:50.574]  I'm like, is this a new guy?
[02:53:50.574 --> 02:53:52.335]  You look like you look healthy.
[02:53:52.335 --> 02:53:52.835]  You look happy.
[02:53:52.835 --> 02:53:53.576]  You look like a new person.
[02:53:54.775 --> 02:53:55.695]  Yeah, I'm a lot happier.
[02:53:55.695 --> 02:53:57.056]  I was really depressed.
[02:53:57.056 --> 02:54:00.438]  Well, that's why I had to shake things up last year.
[02:54:00.438 --> 02:54:01.698]  But yeah, I'm much happier.
[02:54:01.698 --> 02:54:04.440]  I'm like living on the west coast of Canada now.
[02:54:04.440 --> 02:54:05.320]  That's the crazy thing.
[02:54:05.320 --> 02:54:09.122]  Every time I make the right decision against the enemy, my life just gets better too.
[02:54:09.122 --> 02:54:11.963]  But people that serve it are just so committed to it.
[02:54:11.963 --> 02:54:13.504]  They get more and more unhappy.
[02:54:13.504 --> 02:54:14.444]  They want to pull us down.
[02:54:14.444 --> 02:54:15.385]  It's not going to happen.
[02:54:15.385 --> 02:54:17.626]  I'm very excited about revelations.live.
[02:54:17.626 --> 02:54:18.546]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:54:18.546 --> 02:54:19.267]  Thank you so much.
[02:54:20.390 --> 02:54:20.990]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[02:54:20.990 --> 02:54:24.032]  All right, wait till you hear this latest COVID-19 news.
[02:54:24.032 --> 02:54:25.013]  I've been holding back on this.
[02:54:25.013 --> 02:54:26.774]  It just went on Infowars.com.
[02:54:26.774 --> 02:54:27.975]  We'll tell you about it when we come back.
[02:54:27.975 --> 02:54:29.516]  Wait till you hear this.
[02:54:29.516 --> 02:54:31.517]  It is unbelievable.
[02:54:31.517 --> 02:54:33.939]  You think they're creating fake COVID numbers?
[02:54:33.939 --> 02:54:40.203]  Wait till you hear this one.
[02:54:40.203 --> 02:54:41.544]  It's Christmas in July.
[02:54:41.544 --> 02:54:42.865]  We ran the sale last year.
[02:54:42.865 --> 02:54:43.926]  It was very, very popular.
[02:54:44.631 --> 02:54:50.896]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election year.
[02:54:50.896 --> 02:54:56.099]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[02:54:56.099 --> 02:55:02.044]  It's the American Eagle, boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross flag.
[02:55:02.044 --> 02:55:04.685]  And the shirts are on sale right now at infowarestore.com.
[02:55:05.846 --> 02:55:11.949]  I got the idea for the Trump campaign having a similar sort of media called Nazi, which of course it isn't.
[02:55:11.949 --> 02:55:16.611]  And since it's so triggering to the leftists and the globalists, well, we're gonna make sure there's even more of these on the streets.
[02:55:17.369 --> 02:55:17.990]  We're good to go.
[02:55:52.462 --> 02:55:56.204]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:55:56.204 --> 02:55:58.886]  And you tend to live a lot better life if you resist them as well.
[02:55:58.886 --> 02:56:00.727]  So why not do the right thing?
[02:56:00.727 --> 02:56:01.628]  Haha!
[02:56:01.628 --> 02:56:03.469]  God just wants us to win.
[02:56:03.469 --> 02:56:05.110]  But you gotta have courage.
[02:56:05.110 --> 02:56:06.791]  It's all God wants.
[02:56:06.791 --> 02:56:09.933]  God hates cowards.
[02:56:09.933 --> 02:56:16.997]  Never forget that and never forget what the ancient Greeks said and I think Zapata put it in a quick quote, but it's true.
[02:56:21.112 --> 02:56:25.813]  It's better to die on your feet than live on your knees as a slave.
[02:56:25.813 --> 02:56:30.614]  Because the coward does, really, die a thousand deaths.
[02:56:30.614 --> 02:56:35.756]  But those that aren't cowards only taste of death once.
[02:56:35.756 --> 02:56:37.716]  All right, my friends.
[02:56:37.716 --> 02:56:40.717]  Here is the good news, the bad news, the crazy news.
[02:56:40.717 --> 02:56:44.518]  This is from gates.house.gov.
[02:56:44.518 --> 02:56:45.458]  They're having the hearings.
[02:56:45.458 --> 02:56:49.959]  Congressman Matt Gaetz files criminal referral against Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
[02:56:52.247 --> 02:56:56.029]  To the Justice Department.
[02:56:56.029 --> 02:57:06.855]  And he goes on to say that Zuckerberg testified that they do not blacklist anybody, they do not penalize conservatives, despite they've got all the undercover footage Project Veritas got.
[02:57:06.855 --> 02:57:11.798]  And then you have the leaked emails where they were banning me and where they talk about how to set me up.
[02:57:12.691 --> 02:57:15.033]  And how they're going after conservatives and pro-Trump people.
[02:57:15.033 --> 02:57:16.834]  I mean, they lie to Congress.
[02:57:16.834 --> 02:57:20.697]  Roger Stone got charged with that, convicted of that, and he didn't even do that.
[02:57:20.697 --> 02:57:24.500]  He said, no, I've not spoken to Julian Assange.
[02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:26.401]  Later he's like, yes, I've got intermediaries.
[02:57:26.401 --> 02:57:27.422]  The Hillary dump will be big.
[02:57:27.422 --> 02:57:28.863]  He had a guy talking to them.
[02:57:28.863 --> 02:57:30.284]  They're going, yeah, it's about Hillary.
[02:57:30.284 --> 02:57:31.485]  Assange had already said that.
[02:57:31.485 --> 02:57:36.569]  You could watch Hannity and know that when Assange was on with it.
[02:57:36.569 --> 02:57:39.331]  The only thing Roger's guilty of is hype.
[02:57:39.331 --> 02:57:40.712]  And boy, were we hyping up those WikiLeaks.
[02:57:40.712 --> 02:57:41.793]  And they were dynamite, weren't they?
[02:57:42.873 --> 02:57:45.695]  I know I did be devil worshiping pedophilia in there.
[02:57:45.695 --> 02:57:50.099]  I knew they were into that, but you need to go read it.
[02:57:50.099 --> 02:57:52.661]  It's going up at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:57:52.661 --> 02:58:00.007]  I'll also post it at NewsWars.com, but he lays it all out and how they lied and what they did.
[02:58:00.007 --> 02:58:03.310]  And here's the letter to the Attorney General.
[02:58:06.263 --> 02:58:07.784]  And I've already sent letters to the President.
[02:58:07.784 --> 02:58:11.806]  I've had law firms write up how they're lying to Congress, how they're all doing it.
[02:58:11.806 --> 02:58:12.567]  I've done it again.
[02:58:12.567 --> 02:58:15.609]  And again, I don't do that because I'm the smartest.
[02:58:15.609 --> 02:58:16.449]  I have all the answers.
[02:58:16.449 --> 02:58:23.654]  I'm not going to sit here while these globalists take over and run death camps in China and set those up for us and watch them lie to everybody.
[02:58:23.654 --> 02:58:24.894]  I went and confronted Sundar.
[02:58:24.894 --> 02:58:29.317]  I went and confronted Jack Dorsey, who then banned me on Twitter that same day.
[02:58:29.317 --> 02:58:32.899]  And I went and confronted them over and over again because I'm going to do it.
[02:58:32.899 --> 02:58:34.760]  And it's not because I'm a hero.
[02:58:34.760 --> 02:58:35.681]  They're enslaving me.
[02:58:37.128 --> 02:58:45.192]  They are metaphysically pissing on me, punching me, stabbing me, and you, and I will not lay down and I will not take it.
[02:58:45.192 --> 02:58:51.876]  And if Bill Gates comes out with his vaccines, and they start pressuring people to take them, people die from it.
[02:58:51.876 --> 02:58:57.298]  There comes a point that we have to start discussing what we're going to do when we're being physically attacked.
[02:58:57.298 --> 02:59:00.180]  And I say that because that's what you're supposed to do when you're a man.
[02:59:02.022 --> 02:59:03.803]  They're already launched violence against us everywhere.
[02:59:03.803 --> 02:59:09.767]  They're already shooting people every day at random communist checkpoints and the media is calling it wonderful.
[02:59:09.767 --> 02:59:13.329]  Well, I don't want to go kill stupid meth-head communists in the street.
[02:59:13.329 --> 02:59:14.490]  They always call Antifa meth-head.
[02:59:14.490 --> 02:59:18.173]  You look at the guy that got killed in Austin, his eyes were total pupils.
[02:59:18.173 --> 02:59:20.694]  I've been around them, that's who they are.
[02:59:20.694 --> 02:59:23.236]  They're usually about 22 a meth-head into devil worship.
[02:59:25.782 --> 02:59:30.908]  Some and I don't I mean dog feces is lower than these people.
[02:59:30.908 --> 02:59:31.989]  I don't want to kill them.
[02:59:31.989 --> 02:59:34.772]  I don't want a physical war.
[02:59:34.772 --> 02:59:41.179]  That's why I tell everybody they kick off a real war and start killing our leaders.
[02:59:41.179 --> 02:59:44.362]  And the FBI sits there while they burn down courthouses and all this stuff.
[02:59:44.362 --> 02:59:47.646]  Don't go during a civil war downtown and fight commies.
[02:59:50.287 --> 02:59:57.695]  Remember who the generals are, and I don't mean military generals, I mean remember who captains these operations.
[02:59:57.695 --> 03:00:02.119]  Because when they make their move, this is just the cover to make it look grassroots.
[03:00:02.119 --> 03:00:04.261]  There they are shooting their high-powered lasers.
[03:00:04.261 --> 03:00:06.884]  You can buy a laser for like 200 bucks, it'll burn somebody's eye out.
[03:00:06.884 --> 03:00:08.846]  I bought a few of these just to test them years ago, I didn't believe it.
[03:00:08.846 --> 03:00:13.671]  If you bought a $100 laser, you can shoot at a matchstick and it ignites in like two seconds.
[03:00:15.162 --> 03:00:21.364]  We've got blue and green lasers and there they are just shooting them in the face for thirty minutes or so and of course these guys are blind now.
[03:00:21.364 --> 03:00:25.765]  They open their eyes up and everything's blurred because it burned out the rods and the cones in their eye.
[03:00:25.765 --> 03:00:27.306]  But oh, they're peaceful.
[03:00:27.306 --> 03:00:31.587]  So all I'm saying is I'm not going to sit here and take crap like this.
[03:00:31.587 --> 03:00:40.250]  You know that woman attacked that family with their children at a picnic table for pulling their mask off in San Diego and I'm sorry.
[03:00:40.250 --> 03:00:41.490]  I'd body slam that lady.
[03:00:41.490 --> 03:00:42.130]  I don't care.
[03:00:42.130 --> 03:00:44.191]  I'm not putting up with being assaulted.
[03:00:45.828 --> 03:00:48.693]  That's disgusting.
[03:00:48.693 --> 03:00:55.385]  These people are out of control and they're activating all their liberal death lovers to come out and attack us.
[03:00:55.385 --> 03:00:57.549]  Now here's the big whopper, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:59.915 --> 03:01:05.977]  Tricare wrongly tells more than 600,000 military members they had coronavirus.
[03:01:05.977 --> 03:01:07.077]  And I read through this.
[03:01:07.077 --> 03:01:08.657]  It's linking back to a database.
[03:01:08.657 --> 03:01:10.098]  They're claiming it's a glitch.
[03:01:10.098 --> 03:01:13.359]  No, this is how they're putting record numbers and spiking.
[03:01:13.359 --> 03:01:14.219]  It's all fraud.
[03:01:14.219 --> 03:01:15.379]  They admit it's all fraud.
[03:01:15.379 --> 03:01:18.800]  They told 600,000 people in the military that they had it.
[03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:24.241]  And that's how they announced last week a doubling in the military and a total pandemic and all this crap.
[03:01:24.241 --> 03:01:26.122]  It's all fake statistics, that story.
[03:01:27.569 --> 03:01:28.571]  He's up on Infowars.com.
[03:01:28.571 --> 03:01:30.834]  You know, you talk about disgusting video.
[03:01:30.834 --> 03:01:33.739]  Police raid New Jersey gym.
[03:01:33.739 --> 03:01:38.486]  Arrest owners for violating Governor Murphy's shutdown order so Walmart can be open.
[03:01:39.474 --> 03:01:44.336]  And Antifa can riot, and Black Lives Matter can attack people, but you can't open your little gym.
[03:01:44.336 --> 03:01:47.697]  You've got to go bankrupt, even though you can't get the stimulus money.
[03:01:47.697 --> 03:01:50.178]  And here come the goon police.
[03:01:50.178 --> 03:01:54.759]  They'll roll over and piss themselves to Antifa, but they can sure arrest a gym owner.
[03:01:54.759 --> 03:01:56.720]  Disgusting!
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:01:58.700]  And there's the gym owner wearing his stupid mask.
[03:01:58.700 --> 03:02:00.541]  I mean, this is all tyranny.
[03:02:00.541 --> 03:02:05.143]  These are shameful police, and that governor is a shameful sack of garbage.
[03:02:05.143 --> 03:02:06.063]  Go ahead and roll the video.
[03:02:10.166 --> 03:02:11.087]  Atlas Gym.
[03:02:11.087 --> 03:02:13.748]  Little bitty private gym.
[03:02:13.748 --> 03:02:14.389]  And here they are.
[03:02:14.389 --> 03:02:15.409]  Oh, you're opening up the morning.
[03:02:15.409 --> 03:02:17.911]  Hear the birds tweeting?
[03:02:17.911 --> 03:02:20.152]  Nobody's allowed to come work out here in the morning.
[03:02:20.152 --> 03:02:21.032]  We're your boss.
[03:02:21.032 --> 03:02:21.893]  We're your king.
[03:02:21.893 --> 03:02:22.753]  We're your god.
[03:02:22.753 --> 03:02:25.655]  1.4 million died of tuberculosis last year.
[03:02:25.655 --> 03:02:27.236]  They bring in the illegal aliens with it.
[03:02:27.236 --> 03:02:28.477]  Put them in school with your kids.
[03:02:28.477 --> 03:02:29.457]  Don't even test them.
[03:02:29.457 --> 03:02:30.198]  And they die.
[03:02:30.198 --> 03:02:31.298]  They die for real.
[03:02:31.298 --> 03:02:37.242]  But this is the virtue signaling cops who they put in charge that will stand down while America burns.
[03:02:39.790 --> 03:02:41.431]  Disgusting!
[03:02:41.431 --> 03:02:46.672]  Meanwhile, on Infowars.com, Walmart, Home Depot and others, reverse policy.
[03:02:46.672 --> 03:02:50.093]  We'll allow unmasked shoppers.
[03:02:50.093 --> 03:02:57.856]  That's because the federal and state laws have to have loopholes for people that have anxiety issues or who have oxygen problems or asthma.
[03:02:59.045 --> 03:03:01.148]  Because they know about the lawsuits now.
[03:03:01.148 --> 03:03:04.533]  And so that's why you tell people, I don't need to wear a mask.
[03:03:04.533 --> 03:03:06.216]  I have anxiety.
[03:03:06.216 --> 03:03:07.538]  And then you can explain it's a fraud to them.
[03:03:07.538 --> 03:03:11.243]  And when somebody comes up and threatens you, that's their problem.
[03:03:11.243 --> 03:03:13.006]  But see, they're getting sued now.
[03:03:13.006 --> 03:03:13.908]  And so they understand.
[03:03:13.908 --> 03:03:14.709]  Push back!
[03:03:15.854 --> 03:03:16.494]  I was in Florida.
[03:03:16.494 --> 03:03:18.416]  I went to grocery stores twice.
[03:03:18.416 --> 03:03:19.816]  People would come up and say, wear your mask.
[03:03:19.816 --> 03:03:23.779]  And I'd say, you know, they said 2.5 million would die and only 150,000.
[03:03:23.779 --> 03:03:25.860]  Oh, you watch Fox News!
[03:03:25.860 --> 03:03:28.421]  Another guy said, walked up to me and said, you better wear your mask.
[03:03:28.421 --> 03:03:30.443]  And I said, you better get statistics.
[03:03:30.443 --> 03:03:32.124]  He goes, huh?
[03:03:32.124 --> 03:03:37.347]  And then I'm walking outside at a gas station in Florida.
[03:03:37.347 --> 03:03:37.967]  I'm going to tell this story.
[03:03:37.967 --> 03:03:39.848]  I haven't told this story yet.
[03:03:39.848 --> 03:03:40.648]  And I'm sitting there.
[03:03:40.648 --> 03:03:43.410]  This is last week.
[03:03:43.410 --> 03:03:44.571]  And this woman walks over.
[03:03:45.822 --> 03:03:50.163]  And she says, wear your mask.
[03:03:50.163 --> 03:03:56.405]  And I looked at her and she said, why aren't you wearing your mask?
[03:03:56.405 --> 03:03:59.165]  And I said, nothing.
[03:03:59.165 --> 03:04:03.066]  And she looked at me and she said, oh, you have nothing to say.
[03:04:03.066 --> 03:04:04.426]  You can't defend yourself.
[03:04:04.426 --> 03:04:07.727]  And I said, no, I don't believe in cruelty to animals.
[03:04:07.727 --> 03:04:11.868]  Just came to me and she said, oh, you think I'm a bitch?
[03:04:11.868 --> 03:04:14.889]  And I said, no, you're a sheep.
[03:04:17.351 --> 03:04:20.992]  I don't think up this stuff, it just comes to me sometimes, you know?
[03:04:20.992 --> 03:04:33.476]  Because usually I'd shoot my mouth off instantly, but I was sitting there in the morning, I was gassing the car up, we were going to drive up to the Everglades to some of these natural pools, and I was drinking a coffee, and I just was kind of like, what is this woman yelling at me for?
[03:04:33.476 --> 03:04:41.418]  And I just kind of looked at her, and I just said, I don't believe in cruelty to animals.
[03:04:41.418 --> 03:04:42.839]  And she said, what?
[03:04:42.839 --> 03:04:43.519]  I'm a bitch?
[03:04:45.602 --> 03:04:46.844]  I said no!
[03:04:46.844 --> 03:04:47.745]  You're a sheep!
[03:04:47.745 --> 03:04:51.969]  And she went, and just walked off.
[03:04:51.969 --> 03:04:55.533]  Because they want that authority to be, they're the good guy, you're the bad guy.
[03:04:55.533 --> 03:04:55.673]  Hey!
[03:04:56.496 --> 03:04:57.236]  Everybody loves him.
[03:04:57.236 --> 03:04:58.496]  He's coming up right now.
[03:04:58.496 --> 03:05:00.937]  The one, the only, Trends Forecaster, Gerald Celente.
[03:05:00.937 --> 03:05:02.697]  Don't forget, the free shipping ends this Friday.
[03:05:02.697 --> 03:05:03.678]  It will end.
[03:05:03.678 --> 03:05:04.778]  And the store-wide, 50% off.
[03:05:04.778 --> 03:05:08.979]  A lot of stuff's selling out, like bodies and X3 and all the rest of it.
[03:05:08.979 --> 03:05:10.899]  So get yours at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:10.899 --> 03:05:12.520]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:05:12.520 --> 03:05:18.041]  And we have the new activated charcoal with no additives and all these great essential oils.
[03:05:18.041 --> 03:05:21.922]  Toothpaste and mouthwash at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:21.922 --> 03:05:22.682]  We're really proud of it.
[03:05:23.542 --> 03:05:24.362]  I've been on air 26 years.
[03:05:24.362 --> 03:05:27.564]  Starting about 24 years ago, I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors, producers, actors.
[03:05:27.564 --> 03:05:28.384]  They wanted to meet with me.
[03:05:28.384 --> 03:05:30.025]  And they said, what is your formal education?
[03:05:30.025 --> 03:05:32.205]  And I said, well, really, nothing but a few years of college.
[03:05:53.160 --> 03:05:58.902]  How are you one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard?
[03:05:58.902 --> 03:06:02.683]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable.
[03:06:02.683 --> 03:06:06.884]  We'd like you to be in movies, we'd like you to write with us, we'd like you to do voiceovers.
[03:06:06.884 --> 03:06:08.024]  You're just a renaissance man.
[03:06:08.024 --> 03:06:13.085]  If folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer makes statements like that and a lot of others, I'm not bragging.
[03:06:13.085 --> 03:06:18.107]  I kept explaining to him, I said, do you understand I didn't come up with any of this?
[03:06:18.107 --> 03:06:22.408]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents.
[03:06:23.080 --> 03:06:28.964]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[03:06:28.964 --> 03:06:34.328]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast, and I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[03:06:34.328 --> 03:06:36.070]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[03:06:52.782 --> 03:06:55.425]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[03:06:55.425 --> 03:06:58.949]  I went in a VA hospital out here in Boise, and I was in there until June.
[03:06:58.949 --> 03:07:08.220]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to InfoWars three hours a day, and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[03:07:08.220 --> 03:07:09.101]  Let me tell you something, man.
[03:07:09.221 --> 03:07:16.062]  I had an internal digestive problem, and I suffered with it for about five or six years, and the doctors, they tried every test.
[03:07:16.062 --> 03:07:17.543]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[03:07:17.543 --> 03:07:21.544]  And then every day, when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[03:07:21.544 --> 03:07:23.724]  I'm gonna get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[03:07:23.724 --> 03:07:26.745]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals, because they don't want you to have that stuff.
[03:07:26.745 --> 03:07:28.605]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[03:07:28.605 --> 03:07:29.145]  I got it.
[03:07:29.145 --> 03:07:30.386]  I hid it from the nurses.
[03:07:30.386 --> 03:07:31.406]  I started taking it.
[03:07:31.406 --> 03:07:33.466]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[03:07:33.466 --> 03:07:34.406]  It saved my life.
[03:07:34.406 --> 03:07:37.107]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[03:07:40.882 --> 03:07:43.486]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:08:00.399 --> 03:08:02.339]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:08:02.339 --> 03:08:13.962]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:08:13.962 --> 03:08:15.263]  Hello, hello, hello.
[03:08:15.263 --> 03:08:18.663]  You're watching The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:18.663 --> 03:08:20.344]  I don't have a jacket on today.
[03:08:20.344 --> 03:08:22.104]  It's hot up here in Kingstown.
[03:08:22.104 --> 03:08:25.205]  And I don't like air conditioning.
[03:08:25.205 --> 03:08:27.285]  I can't stand this stuff.
[03:08:27.285 --> 03:08:29.606]  So anyway, thanks for having me on.
[03:08:30.673 --> 03:08:36.996]  And it's a big day today, but not for people who listen to InfoWars.
[03:08:36.996 --> 03:08:38.076]  It's old news.
[03:08:38.076 --> 03:08:40.277]  Hey, you see gold?
[03:08:40.277 --> 03:08:40.937]  Woof!
[03:08:40.937 --> 03:08:41.517]  Wham!
[03:08:41.517 --> 03:08:42.138]  Boom!
[03:08:42.138 --> 03:08:43.838]  Bop, bada, bop, bop.
[03:08:43.838 --> 03:08:45.659]  New highs.
[03:08:45.659 --> 03:08:46.339]  That's right.
[03:08:46.339 --> 03:08:49.260]  Hey, how about that silver spiking?
[03:08:49.260 --> 03:08:52.442]  No surprise, no surprise.
[03:08:52.442 --> 03:08:53.342]  We called it.
[03:08:53.342 --> 03:08:56.463]  We called it perfectly.
[03:08:56.463 --> 03:08:58.244]  You go back to your trends journal.
[03:08:59.631 --> 03:09:03.194]  Trendalor, Trendalor, June, what was it?
[03:09:03.194 --> 03:09:04.035]  6th, 2019.
[03:09:04.035 --> 03:09:07.178]  The Gold Bull Run has begun.
[03:09:07.178 --> 03:09:09.039]  Gold was $1,332 an ounce.
[03:09:09.039 --> 03:09:13.943]  And now it's headed to a $2,000 an ounce.
[03:09:13.943 --> 03:09:14.083]  Silver.
[03:09:26.164 --> 03:09:30.827]  Go back to your Trends Journal, mid-June of this year.
[03:09:30.827 --> 03:09:32.548]  Gold was floating around $17.50.
[03:09:32.548 --> 03:09:40.534]  And now it's shooting up into those high 20s.
[03:09:40.534 --> 03:09:48.119]  We said silver was going to take off an increase at a more rapid rate than gold.
[03:09:48.119 --> 03:09:51.862]  It's going to particularly spike, we wrote,
[03:09:53.194 --> 03:10:00.357]  When gold goes over $2,000 an ounce.
[03:10:00.357 --> 03:10:07.220]  The reason it's going up is very simple.
[03:10:07.220 --> 03:10:12.663]  The global economy has crashed.
[03:10:12.663 --> 03:10:21.267]  The only people that don't know it are the people that
[03:10:22.518 --> 03:10:29.143]  Listen to prostitutes on the mainstream media.
[03:10:29.143 --> 03:10:34.226]  Go back to when they started locking down everywhere.
[03:10:34.226 --> 03:10:39.070]  This is what all those little low-life liberals said.
[03:10:39.070 --> 03:10:42.112]  Oh, it'll come back.
[03:10:42.112 --> 03:10:46.935]  Oh, it'll come back.
[03:10:46.935 --> 03:10:49.857]  It's not coming back.
[03:10:49.857 --> 03:10:51.459]  It's gone.
[03:10:51.459 --> 03:10:52.079]  It's over.
[03:10:53.323 --> 03:10:56.364]  Oh, wait till we get a vaccination, then I'll come back.
[03:10:56.364 --> 03:11:00.225]  That's the line they're putting out now.
[03:11:00.225 --> 03:11:03.306]  The global economy has crashed.
[03:11:03.306 --> 03:11:20.551]  Gold and silver are spiking because of all the digital trash, backed by nothing and printed on nothing, that the central banksters are pumping into the system to artificially prop it up.
[03:11:22.777 --> 03:11:28.903]  End of story.
[03:11:28.903 --> 03:11:34.088]  One central bank after another, and then the governments.
[03:11:34.088 --> 03:11:36.330]  Oh, they were talking at the beginning of this year, right?
[03:11:36.330 --> 03:11:40.534]  You know, we may see a deficit of a trillion dollars this year.
[03:11:40.534 --> 03:11:41.935]  How much is it going to go up now?
[03:11:41.935 --> 03:11:45.298]  Oh, maybe four trillion.
[03:11:45.298 --> 03:11:46.399]  This is all fake money.
[03:11:50.046 --> 03:11:53.729]  And as we've been saying, they're going to come out with a new currency.
[03:11:53.729 --> 03:12:03.297]  And now even in a new Trends Journal that will be coming out tomorrow, it's a weekly, Greg Manarino, Gregory Manarino, is writing about it.
[03:12:03.297 --> 03:12:05.379]  The Fed's going to do it as well.
[03:12:05.379 --> 03:12:07.020]  They're crashing currencies.
[03:12:07.020 --> 03:12:15.587]  So between the fiscal, which means governments pumping fake money in and building up debt, the fiscal money being pumped in,
[03:12:17.703 --> 03:12:27.745]  And the Zuckerberg digital trash backed by nothing and printed on nothing being printed.
[03:12:27.745 --> 03:12:31.746]  Gold and silver are going to spike, is my forecast.
[03:12:31.746 --> 03:12:34.087]  And I do not give financial advice.
[03:12:34.087 --> 03:12:40.588]  The motto of the Trends Journal is, think for yourself.
[03:12:40.588 --> 03:12:45.090]  I will put my track record up against calling this against anybody in the business.
[03:12:45.090 --> 03:12:47.010]  Yeah, a lot of people have been saying it was going to go up.
[03:12:48.917 --> 03:12:51.339]  We gave the precise dates.
[03:12:51.339 --> 03:12:54.361]  The precise dates.
[03:12:54.361 --> 03:13:01.946]  Silver is up some 35% since I called it in June.
[03:13:01.946 --> 03:13:06.709]  Gold, forget about it.
[03:13:06.709 --> 03:13:07.810]  Again, $1,332 an ounce when I said it.
[03:13:07.810 --> 03:13:09.111]  Today we're floating in the mid-1900s.
[03:13:20.666 --> 03:13:22.207]  Get ready.
[03:13:22.207 --> 03:13:23.908]  We are living in it.
[03:13:23.908 --> 03:13:29.072]  The greatest depression.
[03:13:29.072 --> 03:13:31.594]  Look at all the violence going on around the world.
[03:13:31.594 --> 03:13:37.918]  Beyond the protests in Portland and in Seattle and in D.C.
[03:13:37.918 --> 03:13:42.121]  It's all over the world.
[03:13:42.121 --> 03:13:45.343]  This thing is unfolding.
[03:13:45.343 --> 03:13:47.485]  People are losing everything.
[03:13:48.487 --> 03:13:54.249]  And you know what I say, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[03:13:54.249 --> 03:14:12.236]  Which is why we also have Bradley Steiner, one of America's top close combat and survivalist experts, now writing each week in the Trends Journal, Survivalism.
[03:14:12.236 --> 03:14:13.477]  And you're on InfoWars.
[03:14:15.515 --> 03:14:20.539]  You're getting the products that you need to prepare for this.
[03:14:20.539 --> 03:14:24.361]  Remember when they used to make fun of us?
[03:14:24.361 --> 03:14:29.305]  Us people that prepared for the worst?
[03:14:29.305 --> 03:14:36.010]  Look at what the little sadomasochists do.
[03:14:36.010 --> 03:14:39.472]  The masochists.
[03:14:39.472 --> 03:14:44.956]  When things got bad, what did they do back in February and early March?
[03:14:47.267 --> 03:14:49.929]  You know how they prepared?
[03:14:49.929 --> 03:14:53.311]  I'm not making this up.
[03:14:53.311 --> 03:14:56.834]  They ran out and bought toilet paper.
[03:14:56.834 --> 03:14:59.796]  Or as we'd say in the Bronx, toilet paper.
[03:14:59.796 --> 03:15:04.219]  And by the way, Brad Stein is a Bronx cat too.
[03:15:04.219 --> 03:15:07.721]  We got a different attitude than a lot of people around.
[03:15:07.721 --> 03:15:09.643]  Yes, yes, yes.
[03:15:09.643 --> 03:15:16.828]  Because if you don't fight for your freedom, you just could be nothing but a little boy or girl in Slavelandia.
[03:15:17.952 --> 03:15:23.596]  And that's what most of America's become.
[03:15:23.596 --> 03:15:38.805]  When I held the rally to unite for peace and restore freedom, the Daily Freeman, the paper here, oh, the people take out after me.
[03:15:38.805 --> 03:15:45.069]  Oh, they were waiting for a big spike in virus cases.
[03:15:46.795 --> 03:15:51.456]  You know what they came out with yesterday, the paper?
[03:15:51.456 --> 03:15:55.277]  The virus cases are down.
[03:15:55.277 --> 03:16:04.159]  All these little gutless boys and girls, these imbecilic liberals, and they're not liberals.
[03:16:04.159 --> 03:16:05.599]  They're Bolsheviks.
[03:16:05.599 --> 03:16:08.019]  They're Soviets!
[03:16:08.019 --> 03:16:10.220]  You don't want to do what we tell you to do?
[03:16:11.266 --> 03:16:12.286]  Then you're no good!
[03:16:12.286 --> 03:16:14.707]  You don't have a right to think for yourself!
[03:16:14.707 --> 03:16:27.889]  All these little cowards that called me out for having a rally for peace and freedom, now they got locked you up.
[03:16:27.889 --> 03:16:30.370]  Time to fight for your freedom.
[03:16:30.370 --> 03:16:34.231]  Time to support InfoWars.
[03:16:34.231 --> 03:16:36.411]  Time for you to become you.
[03:16:36.411 --> 03:16:40.132]  We are selling more privacy pockets a day.
[03:16:40.882 --> 03:16:52.297]  We were previously selling in a month because of the Clinton Foundation running the contact tracing and admittedly with Google and Apple tracking all Americans on their phones even if you opt out of it or get rid of the apps.
[03:16:52.297 --> 03:16:58.645]  People realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and selling your data and using it to control your life.
[03:16:59.185 --> 03:17:06.953]  Sharing it with Antifa, sharing it with Black Lives Matter, sharing it with the deep state to oppress not just high-profile people, but the general public.
[03:17:06.953 --> 03:17:18.625]  That's why folks are taking back control of their lives with these little Faraday cages that you can put your cell phones in that knock out the ability of the cell towers to ping it every few seconds and track your location.
[03:17:18.865 --> 03:17:24.433]  This is the only way to have your privacy, and people are taking their privacy back, and it's very, very exciting.
[03:17:24.433 --> 03:17:28.198]  They're at $19.95 apiece at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:17:28.198 --> 03:17:29.299]  We forward even more.

[03:19:11.727 --> 03:19:14.510]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it.
[03:19:14.510 --> 03:19:15.591]  I'm praying for America.
[03:19:15.591 --> 03:19:16.472]  I'm praying for you.
[03:19:16.472 --> 03:19:19.054]  And I know the power of prayer is real and God hears it.
[03:19:19.054 --> 03:19:22.618]  We need to come together and pray for an even greater awakening.
[03:19:22.618 --> 03:19:25.020]  Pray for Donald Trump to be protected.
[03:19:25.020 --> 03:19:32.568]  Pray for him to win in a landslide and pray for the people under deception of the globalists to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom.
[03:19:32.568 --> 03:19:33.269]  God bless you all.
[03:19:33.269 --> 03:19:34.390]  Please pray for him for us as well.
[03:19:38.914 --> 03:19:58.126]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:19:58.126 --> 03:20:01.508]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:01.508 --> 03:20:05.251]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente!
[03:20:08.723 --> 03:20:10.144]  Hello, hello.
[03:20:10.144 --> 03:20:13.186]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.186 --> 03:20:19.029]  And remember, you got to take care of their Christmas in July sale.
[03:20:19.029 --> 03:20:21.390]  It's extending throughout the end of the month.
[03:20:21.390 --> 03:20:28.594]  Five days remaining, free shipping and double Patriot points, 50 to 60 percent off.
[03:20:28.594 --> 03:20:32.317]  And this is again, it's being extended through the end of the month.
[03:20:32.317 --> 03:20:38.140]  But remember, many of these products are selling out fast and they're not going to be available much longer.
[03:20:38.834 --> 03:20:42.135]  You got BODY, 50% off, it's selling out.

[03:21:17.978 --> 03:21:19.059]  Wait, wait a minute.
[03:21:19.059 --> 03:21:21.341]  I don't want to get in trouble for saying that.
[03:21:21.341 --> 03:21:23.423]  I'm in Super Male Vitality.
[03:21:23.423 --> 03:21:27.145]  So they got Super Male Vitality and I'd like to meet her as well.
[03:21:27.145 --> 03:21:34.391]  And we got BioTrue Selenium, ExtenderWise, 50% off, Alexa Pure Breeze available.
[03:21:34.909 --> 03:21:38.011]  For just one hundred and forty nine dollars.
[03:21:38.011 --> 03:21:39.652]  And this is really important.
[03:21:39.652 --> 03:21:41.474]  Really, really important.
[03:21:41.474 --> 03:21:47.058]  Storeable food back in stock and it's on short order.
[03:21:47.058 --> 03:21:56.224]  Again, storeable food back in stock on short order.
[03:21:56.224 --> 03:22:01.168]  Again, this is what we're writing about in the Trends Journal.
[03:22:01.168 --> 03:22:02.969]  Survivalism.
[03:22:02.969 --> 03:22:03.850]  You got it.
[03:22:04.890 --> 03:22:10.294]  Look at gun sales going up through the roof.
[03:22:10.294 --> 03:22:13.217]  Smart people know what's happening here.
[03:22:13.217 --> 03:22:16.739]  This thing's going down hard and fast.
[03:22:16.739 --> 03:22:18.361]  Oh, it'll come back.
[03:22:18.361 --> 03:22:19.422]  Oh, it'll come back.
[03:22:19.422 --> 03:22:20.582]  Hey, it got sown.
[03:22:20.582 --> 03:22:23.905]  It was going down before it's going to come back.
[03:22:23.905 --> 03:22:29.229]  You look at the GDP numbers coming out of Japan, out of Germany, out of Mexico in 2019.
[03:22:33.624 --> 03:22:34.905]  They're in recession.
[03:22:34.905 --> 03:22:36.405]  They're in negative GDP.
[03:22:36.405 --> 03:22:38.146]  It was going down before this.
[03:22:38.146 --> 03:22:43.688]  It was only being artificially propped up by the central banksters.
[03:22:43.688 --> 03:22:45.409]  You better prepare for the worst.
[03:22:45.409 --> 03:22:50.931]  That's why we're writing about survivalism in every issue of the Trends Journal.
[03:22:50.931 --> 03:22:54.792]  And giving you all the facts that are going on as well.
[03:22:54.792 --> 03:22:55.512]  Here.
[03:22:55.512 --> 03:22:58.834]  This is from today's Wall Street Journal.
[03:22:58.834 --> 03:22:59.374]  Front page.
[03:23:02.105 --> 03:23:11.548]  Developing nation debt threatens to tip into crisis.
[03:23:11.548 --> 03:23:14.229]  All right?
[03:23:14.229 --> 03:23:16.789]  It's one country after another.
[03:23:16.789 --> 03:23:28.093]  The reason gold and silver prices are going up so sharply is because everything is going down so fast.
[03:23:31.684 --> 03:23:43.213]  The debt levels... Back before this happened, they were estimated at $250 trillion.
[03:23:43.213 --> 03:23:51.660]  China alone has about a $45 trillion debt level.
[03:23:51.660 --> 03:23:54.662]  They're going to come out with new currencies.
[03:23:54.662 --> 03:23:59.726]  People ask me, they say, Mr. Sollenti, you know, one time,
[03:24:01.570 --> 03:24:04.692]  The government confiscated our gold.
[03:24:04.692 --> 03:24:05.593]  Will they do it again?
[03:24:05.593 --> 03:24:12.378]  To which I say, a junior, grow up.
[03:24:12.378 --> 03:24:14.980]  They did it back then, they'll do it again.
[03:24:14.980 --> 03:24:20.544]  If we did it before, we could do it again, yeah.
[03:24:20.544 --> 03:24:21.425]  1933.
[03:24:21.425 --> 03:24:29.851]  My father, may his soul rest in peace, said to me, when I was a kid one time, he said, you know, he said, back during the Depression,
[03:24:30.526 --> 03:24:34.088]  Called in all the gold.
[03:24:34.088 --> 03:24:36.829]  You said your grandfather had a lot of gold.
[03:24:36.829 --> 03:24:38.650]  My grandfather was very patriotic.
[03:24:38.650 --> 03:24:40.351]  May they all rest in peace.
[03:24:40.351 --> 03:24:42.792]  You know, immigrant from Italy.
[03:24:42.792 --> 03:24:45.513]  He was so proud of being an American.
[03:24:45.513 --> 03:24:48.575]  I wrote about it in my book when Zizi gave Honey Boy.
[03:24:48.575 --> 03:24:55.298]  He was the first online to go voting when the polls opened up during election day.
[03:24:55.298 --> 03:24:56.959]  So he said, your grandfather, he said, you know,
[03:24:57.998 --> 03:24:58.678]  He turned it all in.
[03:24:58.678 --> 03:24:59.999]  They turned it all in for about $26 an ounce.
[03:24:59.999 --> 03:25:00.879]  After they got it all back,
[03:25:28.089 --> 03:25:31.470]  Or they thought they did, the government.
[03:25:31.470 --> 03:25:37.153]  They raised the price to $33 an ounce.
[03:25:37.153 --> 03:25:43.535]  So they screw the people that they stole the money from.
[03:25:43.535 --> 03:25:52.599]  So people ask me, should I keep it in a safe deposit box?
[03:25:52.599 --> 03:25:56.481]  And I say to them, do what you want.
[03:25:56.481 --> 03:25:56.841]  For me,
[03:25:57.859 --> 03:26:07.005]  I would keep it far, far away, so they can't get their hands on it, because that's what they're going to do.
[03:26:07.005 --> 03:26:22.575]  Don't call me a conspiracy theorist, little Zucker, or little Googlets, or little Twitter nothings of that arrogant Dorsey boy, the little boy that folded the fastest.
[03:26:23.283 --> 03:26:33.446]  Calling in all his little slaves under him to stay at home when the virus broke out.
[03:26:33.446 --> 03:26:37.006]  Don't tell me I'm a conspiracy theorist!
[03:26:37.006 --> 03:26:39.987]  Low-life little geeksters!
[03:26:39.987 --> 03:26:41.928]  All you little freaksters!
[03:26:41.928 --> 03:26:48.169]  It was FDR that called it all in.
[03:26:48.169 --> 03:26:51.230]  Franklin Delano, let's go to war, Roosevelt!
[03:26:53.439 --> 03:26:55.441]  Yep.
[03:26:55.441 --> 03:26:56.802]  Not a conspiracy.
[03:26:56.802 --> 03:26:59.144]  It's a fact.
[03:26:59.144 --> 03:27:05.650]  Just as they robbed us of our rights right now.
[03:27:05.650 --> 03:27:10.935]  They will rob us again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again.
[03:27:15.566 --> 03:27:17.368]  You can't go out.
[03:27:17.368 --> 03:27:18.749]  Don't you know who I am?
[03:27:18.749 --> 03:27:24.093]  I'm Andy Cuomo, the little arrogant boy born on Third Base and thought he had a home run.
[03:27:24.093 --> 03:27:28.216]  You gotta stay in your house, you're getting locked down.
[03:27:28.216 --> 03:27:30.298]  I'm that witless Whitmere.
[03:27:30.298 --> 03:27:35.142]  I'm that Abbott of Abbott and Costello over there in, uh, Texas.
[03:27:35.142 --> 03:27:39.065]  I'm Newsome Gruesome over there in California.
[03:27:39.065 --> 03:27:43.429]  I'll tell you what to do, you little pieces of garbage crap!
[03:27:44.139 --> 03:27:51.801]  Workers of Slavelandia?
[03:27:51.801 --> 03:27:54.822]  And you do what they tell you.
[03:27:54.822 --> 03:27:59.083]  They will rob us of everything they can.
[03:27:59.083 --> 03:28:01.724]  And they're doing it now.
[03:28:01.724 --> 03:28:04.845]  Will they rob you of your gold and silver?
[03:28:04.845 --> 03:28:08.846]  Of course they will.
[03:28:08.846 --> 03:28:12.027]  Because the currency is worth nothing.
[03:28:13.875 --> 03:28:17.039]  Nothing.
[03:28:17.039 --> 03:28:21.203]  Nothing.
[03:28:21.203 --> 03:28:27.991]  Hey, how come you don't have that picture of Cuomo over there with his mask below his chin?
[03:28:27.991 --> 03:28:31.875]  And you could take that mask and you could shove it up your you-know-what.
[03:28:31.875 --> 03:28:33.036]  Oh, there you go.
[03:28:33.036 --> 03:28:34.558]  There's the other little lowlife.
[03:28:35.231 --> 03:28:37.433]  Fauci the fraud!
[03:28:37.433 --> 03:28:37.973]  Jaw!
[03:28:37.973 --> 03:28:40.715]  That's what Fauci means in Italian.
[03:28:40.715 --> 03:28:46.540]  Fauci the low-life, disgusting fraud, as with all of them.
[03:28:46.540 --> 03:28:47.680]  Oh.
[03:28:47.680 --> 03:28:53.505]  And then you want to read your Trends Journal about the ineffectiveness of masks.
[03:28:53.505 --> 03:29:03.452]  And how the World Trade Organization, not World Trade, World Health Organization, WHO, TOO, whatever, CDC, Fauci the fraud,
[03:29:05.249 --> 03:29:08.631]  One after another, telling us not to wear the masks.
[03:29:08.631 --> 03:29:12.612]  Also pointing out the dangers of them.
[03:29:12.612 --> 03:29:15.454]  But now you gotta do it.
[03:29:15.454 --> 03:29:19.055]  Gold and silver is the future as I see it.
[03:29:19.055 --> 03:29:23.877]  And the motto of the Trends Journal is, think for yourself.
[03:29:23.877 --> 03:29:30.900]  The numbers of deaths, hey, highest in New York, thanks to Killer Cuomo.
[03:29:30.900 --> 03:29:33.321]  And all the liberals love him.
[03:29:33.321 --> 03:29:34.062]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:35.359 --> 03:29:46.906]  Vicki Gibbs, 57-year-old lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated, and then died.
[03:29:46.906 --> 03:29:52.250]  And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch, it'll be intubation.
[03:29:52.250 --> 03:29:53.591]  We know what's gonna happen.
[03:29:53.591 --> 03:29:54.972]  It's a blue city.
[03:29:54.972 --> 03:29:56.192]  Same story yet again.
[03:29:56.192 --> 03:29:58.174]  And they say her heart gave out.
[03:29:59.154 --> 03:30:04.017]  If you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record.
[03:30:04.017 --> 03:30:06.739]  Warn everyone you know before they go into the hospital and get killed.
[03:30:06.739 --> 03:30:10.341]  Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states?
[03:30:10.341 --> 03:30:17.285]  It's because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs, and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response.
[03:30:17.285 --> 03:30:21.408]  And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying it will kill you.
[03:30:22.068 --> 03:30:26.734]  But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[03:30:26.734 --> 03:30:30.798]  And the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading.
[03:30:30.798 --> 03:30:33.542]  Don't end up like Vicki Gibbs or everyone.
[03:30:35.523 --> 03:30:37.545]  You can't make this stuff up.
[03:30:37.545 --> 03:30:58.481]  A consortium of the UNWHO, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and of course, the Clinton Global Initiative, headed up by Chelsea Clinton on the board, are in control of Apple and Google with a hidden app on all phones that you cannot turn off to track and trace everywhere you go.
[03:30:58.481 --> 03:31:02.965]  They claim for COVID, but of course, it's really the Chinese communist social score rollout.
[03:31:03.345 --> 03:31:11.252]  These people are sick, filthy criminals, and they want total control over society with the official global ID system.
[03:31:11.252 --> 03:31:13.915]  That's why it's called the Clinton Global Initiative.
[03:31:13.915 --> 03:31:18.319]  But you can fight back with the privacy pockets at implowarestore.com.
[03:31:18.459 --> 03:31:29.173]  Little Faraday cages, little envelopes, put your phone in it, and these dirty, scumbag, fascist pieces of garbage can't get all that data and rape you with that data.
[03:31:29.173 --> 03:31:30.134]  Rape your privacy.
[03:31:30.134 --> 03:31:34.100]  Tell the rapist Clintons go to hell and get your privacy pockets in a Fort Worth store.
[03:31:36.129 --> 03:31:40.971]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[03:31:40.971 --> 03:31:50.434]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[03:31:50.434 --> 03:31:55.215]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[03:31:55.215 --> 03:32:05.859]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs to support your body.
[03:32:05.999 --> 03:32:07.200]  Yes, it's a great idea.
[03:32:36.035 --> 03:32:41.139]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at Infowarstore.com.
[03:32:41.139 --> 03:32:42.760]  You can wear them out to political events.
[03:32:42.760 --> 03:32:44.341]  You can trigger lib darts.
[03:32:44.341 --> 03:32:51.626]  But one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[03:32:51.626 --> 03:32:57.871]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[03:32:57.871 --> 03:33:04.475]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and contact tracing that they're openly announcing.
[03:33:04.475 --> 03:33:05.136]  It's an active
[03:33:05.598 --> 03:33:06.258]  Submission.
[03:33:06.258 --> 03:33:09.699]  It's an act of like putting a burka on your head and bowing down.
[03:33:09.699 --> 03:33:19.422]  But a big reason to wear these is then into stores when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween mask, say, it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[03:33:19.422 --> 03:33:23.243]  And the M95 mask only control what's coming in, not what's going out.
[03:33:23.243 --> 03:33:25.324]  So they quote, spread COVID-19.
[03:33:25.324 --> 03:33:26.804]  They don't protect from it.
[03:33:26.804 --> 03:33:29.765]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back at these control freaks faces.
[03:33:29.765 --> 03:33:32.406]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free.
[03:33:32.406 --> 03:33:33.406]  They're at cost.
[03:33:33.406 --> 03:33:34.807]  Infowarestore.com.
[03:33:38.849 --> 03:33:41.551]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:34:02.647 --> 03:34:09.250]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:34:09.250 --> 03:34:16.154]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:34:16.154 --> 03:34:17.054]  Hello, hello!
[03:34:17.054 --> 03:34:27.340]  It's great being on the Alex Jones Show, and as I said, you better prepare to survive, because this thing's going down fast and hard.
[03:34:28.272 --> 03:34:28.972]  Look at gold.
[03:34:28.972 --> 03:34:32.794]  I was just talking about what happened back in 1933.
[03:34:32.794 --> 03:34:36.095]  Hey, what's gold selling out now?
[03:34:36.095 --> 03:34:38.456]  Oh, 1933.
[03:34:38.456 --> 03:34:41.777]  So again, 1933.
[03:34:41.777 --> 03:34:49.540]  And when I said gold was going to spike, it was one thousand three hundred and about thirty three dollars an ounce.
[03:34:49.540 --> 03:34:51.421]  So I said, so what is that?
[03:34:51.421 --> 03:34:57.403]  It's six hundred dollars an ounce higher than when I said to buy it.
[03:34:59.824 --> 03:35:01.944]  I didn't say to buy it, I said it would go up.
[03:35:01.944 --> 03:35:04.045]  Again, I don't give financial advice.
[03:35:04.045 --> 03:35:08.526]  So, going back to some other trends.
[03:35:08.526 --> 03:35:10.866]  Wear no mask, you're under attack.
[03:35:10.866 --> 03:35:13.867]  This is from the new Trends Journal going out tomorrow.
[03:35:13.867 --> 03:35:22.649]  Forget the scientific facts, as we have continually reported in the Trends Journal regarding the ineffectiveness and dangers of face mask wearing.
[03:35:22.649 --> 03:35:29.550]  If you don't wear one because you believe the data, and think for yourself, you'll be attacked by politicians, the public, and the media.
[03:35:30.575 --> 03:35:42.239]  This was the 22nd July headline in Newsweek, or as I would say more appropriately, call it last week's because it's last week's news next week.
[03:35:42.239 --> 03:35:44.159]  But here's the headline.
[03:35:44.159 --> 03:35:54.083]  Narcissists and psychopaths are more likely to refuse to wear masks.
[03:35:54.083 --> 03:35:57.224]  Isn't that something?
[03:35:57.224 --> 03:35:57.884]  There you got it.
[03:36:01.610 --> 03:36:03.432]  That's what they do.
[03:36:03.432 --> 03:36:04.613]  That's the fear.
[03:36:04.613 --> 03:36:09.036]  Forget what the New England Journal of Medicine said.
[03:36:09.036 --> 03:36:13.480]  Forget what the World Health Organization said.
[03:36:13.480 --> 03:36:17.403]  Forget what the Centers for Disease Control said.
[03:36:17.403 --> 03:36:21.386]  Forget what all these other researchers have found.
[03:36:21.386 --> 03:36:26.030]  We're going to sell our crap, which is fear.
[03:36:26.030 --> 03:36:30.234]  And you're going to buy it.
[03:36:30.234 --> 03:36:30.394]  Then
[03:36:31.906 --> 03:36:35.728]  There's another one.
[03:36:35.728 --> 03:36:41.330]  This is from Alt-Net.
[03:36:41.330 --> 03:36:46.733]  Put in Alt-Net, and what they say about Alt-Net is, where do I have it here?
[03:36:46.733 --> 03:36:48.633]  I don't want to lose it.
[03:36:48.633 --> 03:36:53.135]  Ah, here they are.
[03:36:53.135 --> 03:36:56.777]  Alt-Net is a politically left-wing leaning website
[03:36:57.509 --> 03:37:07.091]  That was launched in 1998 by the non-profit now known as Independent Media Institute.
[03:37:07.091 --> 03:37:11.311]  Either they're very stupid or they think everybody else is.
[03:37:11.311 --> 03:37:19.713]  How could you have an Independent Media Institute and admit that you're politically left-leaning website?
[03:37:19.713 --> 03:37:26.174]  How could anybody that could think for themselves lean either politically left
[03:37:26.906 --> 03:37:28.788]  Or politically right?
[03:37:28.788 --> 03:37:32.210]  How about... Oh, you gotta be politically correct!
[03:37:32.210 --> 03:37:35.793]  How about no politics at all?
[03:37:35.793 --> 03:37:39.256]  How about keeping politics out of this?
[03:37:39.256 --> 03:37:41.758]  And thinking for yourself?
[03:37:41.758 --> 03:37:54.829]  They wrote an article a few days ago that is one of the most disgusting pieces of crap that I have read
[03:37:55.609 --> 03:37:58.390]  In a long time.
[03:37:58.390 --> 03:38:00.691]  The headline is.
[03:38:00.691 --> 03:38:02.792]  Here's your field guide.
[03:38:02.792 --> 03:38:09.175]  The five main types of pandemic deniers.
[03:38:09.175 --> 03:38:16.799]  So, in other words, if you could think for yourself and you're not a low life piece of slimy crap.
[03:38:16.799 --> 03:38:18.880]  Oh, this came from Salon.
[03:38:18.880 --> 03:38:19.500]  Yeah.
[03:38:19.500 --> 03:38:22.601]  Salon, S-H-I, you know what?
[03:38:22.601 --> 03:38:23.682]  Then you're a denier.
[03:38:25.231 --> 03:38:30.194]  You can't think for yourself!
[03:38:30.194 --> 03:38:51.466]  So, they went on to say, the article written with total bias, as I write it, and demanding us to subjugate to a higher authorities is void of any scientific data, yet it begins with, begins with, quote, every day
[03:38:52.324 --> 03:38:56.945]  There is more data to prove the dangers of the coronavirus.
[03:38:56.945 --> 03:39:08.969]  Yet, bizarrely, the more proof we have of the damage of the pandemic, the more vicious and hysterical its deniers.
[03:39:13.658 --> 03:39:16.980]  They don't show one shred of proof.
[03:39:16.980 --> 03:39:17.641]  Why?
[03:39:17.641 --> 03:39:19.983]  Because it's salon!
[03:39:19.983 --> 03:39:22.404]  Because they're left leaning.
[03:39:22.404 --> 03:39:24.205]  We don't have to show you proof.
[03:39:24.205 --> 03:39:25.867]  I could show you proof.
[03:39:25.867 --> 03:39:29.889]  How about this proof that you could shove up you know what?
[03:39:29.889 --> 03:39:36.174]  The toilet paper record, the New York Times, reported
[03:39:37.915 --> 03:39:47.862]  Quote, the disturbingly large numbers of coronavirus cases reported each day since the pandemic exploded may in fact be low by a lot.
[03:39:47.862 --> 03:39:58.570]  A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, found that the number of infected people, quote, far exceeds the number of reported cases, end quote.
[03:39:58.570 --> 03:40:05.495]  The study said that actual infection rates were up to 13 times higher.
[03:40:05.495 --> 03:40:07.577]  This they buried in one little article.
[03:40:10.171 --> 03:40:12.733]  I've mentioned this before.
[03:40:12.733 --> 03:40:15.335]  So now let's put this together.
[03:40:15.335 --> 03:40:23.402]  John Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center says some 4 million Americans have been infected with the virus.
[03:40:23.402 --> 03:40:31.589]  However, we write if the CDC estimate of up to 13 times higher, that would bring it to, you ready?
[03:40:31.589 --> 03:40:38.255]  52 million people infected by the virus.
[03:40:38.255 --> 03:40:38.395]  So,
[03:40:39.158 --> 03:40:46.343]  With 149,200 deaths, again we wrote this yesterday, in the US, the virus as of Sunday, 99.77% of the people will recover from the virus.
[03:40:46.343 --> 03:40:49.525]  But yet, they write
[03:41:11.641 --> 03:41:24.525]  This crap in Alt-Net and Ceylon that we are deniers.
[03:41:24.525 --> 03:41:29.586]  They call us cove idiots.
[03:41:29.586 --> 03:41:38.489]  That derives from this nation's long resistance to expertise.
[03:41:38.489 --> 03:41:39.149]  End quote.
[03:41:41.286 --> 03:41:42.627]  You got it.
[03:41:42.627 --> 03:41:48.111]  Fear is the real virus, and that's what they've been selling.
[03:41:48.111 --> 03:42:09.428]  We quoted that guy, Jeff Zucker, and you could put any letter you want in front of that Zucker, you could call it an S or anything else, of CNN, telling his staff to keep promoting the coronavirus because more people were tuning in as their ratings were going into the toilet.
[03:42:10.120 --> 03:42:11.741]  Where prostitutes hang out.
[03:42:11.741 --> 03:42:18.184]  That's all they sell is the crap in the toilet.
[03:42:18.184 --> 03:42:23.407]  Just like they were selling that storm that's hitting Hawaii.
[03:42:23.407 --> 03:42:27.049]  You know what it was last week?
[03:42:27.049 --> 03:42:30.311]  Worst storm on the planet!
[03:42:30.311 --> 03:42:33.152]  Oh wow, way maroon.
[03:42:33.152 --> 03:42:35.493]  Worst storm on the planet.
[03:42:35.493 --> 03:42:36.794]  There he is, there's that sucker.
[03:42:39.511 --> 03:42:43.894]  Yep, let's just stay very focused on this.
[03:42:43.894 --> 03:42:44.474]  Look at this!
[03:42:44.474 --> 03:42:45.975]  Look at these people!
[03:42:45.975 --> 03:42:48.377]  Look at them!
[03:42:48.377 --> 03:42:56.022]  A freak show in front of everybody's eyes.
[03:42:56.022 --> 03:42:59.364]  So that's what they're doing.
[03:42:59.364 --> 03:43:02.026]  They're selling fear and hysteria.
[03:43:02.026 --> 03:43:06.208]  And they've destroyed the economy.
[03:43:06.208 --> 03:43:07.189]  It's not coming back.
[03:43:08.286 --> 03:43:10.887]  It's only going to get much worse.
[03:43:10.887 --> 03:43:12.368]  Airline travel is dead.
[03:43:12.368 --> 03:43:13.789]  Tourism is dead.
[03:43:13.789 --> 03:43:16.130]  All the summer spots that depended on people.
[03:43:16.130 --> 03:43:20.412]  From the Jersey Shore to anywhere else around the world.
[03:43:20.412 --> 03:43:21.952]  Tourism.
[03:43:21.952 --> 03:43:26.575]  Americans banned in Europe to go to Europe.
[03:43:26.575 --> 03:43:31.217]  26% of American tourism.
[03:43:31.217 --> 03:43:35.339]  26% of the tourism, excuse me, comes from Americans.
[03:43:35.339 --> 03:43:35.739]  In Europe.
[03:43:36.920 --> 03:43:38.461]  Restaurants are empty.
[03:43:38.461 --> 03:43:41.023]  Hotels are empty.
[03:43:41.023 --> 03:43:44.506]  People are freaking out everywhere.
[03:43:44.506 --> 03:43:46.668]  This is going down hard.
[03:43:46.668 --> 03:43:48.289]  It's going down big.
[03:43:48.289 --> 03:43:49.870]  New York City is empty.
[03:43:49.870 --> 03:43:54.494]  A lot of places still boarded up.
[03:43:54.494 --> 03:43:57.717]  Kingston is dead.
[03:43:57.717 --> 03:43:59.158]  Gone.
[03:43:59.158 --> 03:44:01.180]  It used to be packed.
[03:44:01.180 --> 03:44:04.442]  One of the hippest places around.
[03:44:04.442 --> 03:44:05.383]  All over the country.
[03:44:06.582 --> 03:44:10.344]  So, the motto of the Trends Journal is, think for yourself.
[03:44:10.344 --> 03:44:15.767]  You better think for yourself, and I'm just saying, you better prepare for the worst.
[03:44:15.767 --> 03:44:18.169]  If the worst doesn't happen, you've lost nothing.
[03:44:18.169 --> 03:44:21.610]  If the worst happens and you don't prepare, you lose everything.
[03:44:21.610 --> 03:44:22.331]  See you next week.
