[00:00.000 --> 00:29.680]  99 days, 99 days until the historic election, the way Fox News counts it,
[00:29.680 --> 00:34.480]  they count the day of the election as well, so that'd be 100 days, but anyway you slice it,
[00:34.480 --> 00:40.480]  we're getting close into this historic event. Okay, I have done a lot of preparation for this
[00:40.480 --> 00:46.080]  Sunday transmission. Also Ted Nugent is going to be calling in at the start of the second hour
[00:46.080 --> 00:56.560]  today with some really huge news. The Democrats banned a pro-police rally in New York. The governor
[00:56.560 --> 01:02.080]  just said you can't have it and said any police that, you know, show up or give me support,
[01:02.080 --> 01:07.040]  they'll be fired, any state police will be fired, he's God now. He said because of COVID,
[01:07.040 --> 01:12.800]  but everybody else can demonstrate and have your protest. This is how the globalist communist
[01:12.800 --> 01:21.680]  Illuminati system operates. They'll be popping in. Okay, so it's now official. We've had Pelosi,
[01:21.680 --> 01:29.840]  we've had Biden, we've had Schiff, we've had Eric Holder, the former attorney general, we've had
[01:29.840 --> 01:37.040]  them all come out and say Trump's a dictator already, he works for the Russians and he's
[01:37.040 --> 01:43.360]  going to lose the election and then if he challenges it in any way, he is a dictator and the military
[01:43.360 --> 01:46.880]  is going to remove him and if the military doesn't remove him, we'll have them arrested
[01:46.880 --> 01:54.880]  and we'll burn down all the cities. Next, Atlantic Monthly, which is the mouth of the
[01:54.880 --> 01:58.800]  New World Order, even more than New York Times here in the U.S., the Financial Times of London
[01:59.600 --> 02:01.440]  over in England, that's the Rothschild mouthpiece.
[02:04.080 --> 02:08.640]  They're openly saying violence and riots will skyrocket if Trump wins election,
[02:08.640 --> 02:14.240]  you better not do it. And then Moody's and Barons and all of the ratings agencies
[02:14.240 --> 02:19.520]  and Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan all say this will be a contestant election, it's going to be a
[02:19.520 --> 02:26.080]  disaster, the mail-in ballots, the fraud and if Trump points any of that out or you do,
[02:26.080 --> 02:30.720]  you're a dictator, even though the Democrats win and if they lose, I think right now there's
[02:30.720 --> 02:35.440]  anywhere near a fair election they're going to lose. The asylum majority is really pissed,
[02:36.960 --> 02:42.080]  but they don't care. They will contest it and when Trump says you're there wrong,
[02:42.080 --> 02:46.640]  they're going to activate folks to burn the country down and with 99 days out, this is all
[02:46.640 --> 02:52.240]  a beta test drill for that and the censorship's in place and the AI kill switch is in place
[02:52.240 --> 02:56.480]  and Trump has not gotten control of the Obama kill switch, but the deep state still has,
[02:56.480 --> 02:58.880]  or the globalists that are installed at all those levels,
[03:00.720 --> 03:08.240]  what they call stay-behind networks or embeds. So that is all coming up here tonight,
[03:08.240 --> 03:13.520]  we will break it down. The country and the entire world is in really unparalleled
[03:14.960 --> 03:19.920]  peril and I do not have words to describe to you how serious the situation is.
[03:19.920 --> 03:23.360]  They've done everything they can to try to take us off air at this time,
[03:23.360 --> 03:28.160]  we're still on hundreds of radio stations, over 100 cable and TV stations and we have
[03:28.160 --> 03:35.120]  huge audiences at man.video and then FullWars.com and NewsWars.com, but remember you are critical
[03:35.120 --> 03:39.920]  in this fight without you taking action and getting excited and telling people via email,
[03:39.920 --> 03:44.720]  via text message and word of mouth about man.video, about in FullWars.com,
[03:46.720 --> 03:50.880]  without you telling them that all the doctors and scientists and whistleblowers that have
[03:50.880 --> 03:56.800]  been exposing the COVID-19 takeover hoax, without you getting that information out,
[03:57.520 --> 04:00.880]  we're going to lose this fight and I've got some incredible examples of that.
[04:00.880 --> 04:05.600]  Eric Boling is going to be back on the show soon, he of course left Fox,
[04:05.600 --> 04:10.000]  the left celebrated it when his son overdosed on an opiate, he's a good guy.
[04:11.600 --> 04:15.920]  He was doing a report for Sinclair, it's as big as Fox or bigger around the country with broadcast
[04:15.920 --> 04:21.600]  stations about gain of function and how Fauci was involved with the Wuhan lab weaponizing all of it.
[04:23.600 --> 04:28.160]  You know, I personally have sent him and Tucker Carlson and a bunch of other people,
[04:28.160 --> 04:33.200]  hundreds of articles, I'll show you some of them today, hell from the NIH website how Fauci did
[04:33.200 --> 04:38.800]  this, it's not even hidden, but CNN's policing it and they made some calls and Sinclair's not
[04:38.800 --> 04:44.800]  going to air it now because you know, Fauci's God, everything he says is a lie, a fraud,
[04:44.800 --> 04:49.520]  he threw in the first pitch at a baseball game, was like 30 feet off the mound in left field,
[04:49.520 --> 04:57.040]  I mean, they all cheered for him, I mean the guy is a freaking criminal who needs to be indicted.
[05:19.600 --> 05:27.920]  It teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation
[05:27.920 --> 05:35.040]  computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design. This isn't like it's
[05:35.040 --> 05:41.760]  some advancement that we just fell into, it's been pre-planned, organized globally and it's
[05:41.760 --> 05:48.400]  extremely predatory and through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations,
[05:48.400 --> 05:54.640]  the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate
[05:54.640 --> 06:06.320]  power. This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[06:06.320 --> 06:24.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this July 26 Sunday Live broadcast, 99 days out from this
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.880]  historic election. Well, I have here in my hands, again I'm your host Alex Jones, thank you for
[06:28.880 --> 06:38.160]  joining us, CNN, the police dogs of thought crime, Sinclair says it will postpone and rework segment
[06:38.160 --> 06:45.600]  featuring conspiracy theory about Fauci and it says that without any proof, though they don't show
[06:45.600 --> 06:54.080]  the piece, they were going to look at Fauci at the NIH for 45 years involved in gain of function
[06:54.080 --> 07:03.920]  transfers of weaponized coronavirus during the Obama administration. Now, Dr. McCamshaw, please,
[07:04.640 --> 07:14.720]  look right here. NIH lifts funding pause on gain of function research, NIH.gov,
[07:15.600 --> 07:20.400]  that's and it gets into Fauci and the programs and bill them on the gates and the actual gain
[07:20.400 --> 07:26.800]  of function. Here's Newsweek, Dr. Fauci back controversial Wuhan lab with US dollars for
[07:26.800 --> 07:35.440]  risky coronavirus research with spliced virus chimeras using weaponized bat viruses. Oh, okay.
[07:36.400 --> 07:42.160]  Here's another one, 2015 lab made coronavirus triggers debate, gain of function weaponized
[07:42.160 --> 07:52.320]  SARS COVID-2 virus and it goes into how deadly it is to transfer it. I'll be getting into that a
[07:52.320 --> 08:01.040]  little bit later. The emperor has no clothes, everything Fauci has told us has been a giant
[08:01.040 --> 08:07.360]  galactic size line. He told us 2.5 million would be dead in America, then 2.2 million,
[08:07.360 --> 08:11.600]  then he told us all the hospitals would be full and we needed hundreds of thousands of ventilators.
[08:13.840 --> 08:17.840]  And now as they test everybody, the number of positives goes up, the number of deaths goes
[08:17.840 --> 08:21.520]  down, but they put out the set of headlines saying record deaths. Then they'll say, oh,
[08:21.520 --> 08:25.760]  because it's some little town had three deaths, they didn't have any before. So now it's record
[08:25.760 --> 08:33.120]  deaths. They're all playing semantical games. And Gregory stood an excellent report that we're
[08:33.120 --> 08:38.880]  going to air coming up at the bottom of the hour where he shows the NIH website currently
[08:40.080 --> 08:44.880]  admitting that if you've ever had a bacterial infection, I didn't know that they've added that
[08:44.880 --> 08:50.640]  or a coronavirus, that's the common cold, or the flu, usually in about a decade,
[08:51.440 --> 08:56.080]  you will test positive for COVID-19. So when you see stories about their 60%
[08:56.080 --> 09:05.200]  false positives, bull, you know what? Unbelievable fraud because it was the Wuhan lab
[09:06.400 --> 09:12.960]  that had a billable undergates finance directive in it that created the test that was then approved
[09:12.960 --> 09:24.000]  seven months ago in China that we then adopted. Look it up. Unbelievable. And medical doctors
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.920]  are trying to write books and publish them and Amazon won't even let them sell them.
[09:28.480 --> 09:33.680]  But it's all NIH. It's all admit. That's what's crazy is none of this is even in.
[09:37.920 --> 09:45.840]  I just showed you new scientists. I just showed you NIH. I just showed you Newsweek saying
[09:45.840 --> 09:52.960]  Fauci ran the programs with Billable undergates foundation grants from them to the NIH and then
[09:52.960 --> 10:03.280]  given to the Wuhan lab in the hundreds of millions of dollars illegal gain of function weaponized
[10:03.280 --> 10:10.320]  testing that they shipped to China to do it there. Just like the CIA has black torture sites in China
[10:10.320 --> 10:18.880]  under Obama. But then Sinclair, bigger than Fox, thousands of TV stations around the country,
[10:18.880 --> 10:31.520]  tried to air it CNN-tattled. And so now they're not going to do it right now. This is how crazy
[10:31.520 --> 10:37.200]  this is. It's like a Eric Bowling wanted to have a thing on Sinclair saying Santa Claus has a big
[10:37.200 --> 10:43.440]  white beard and Santa Claus wears a red and white outfit. He's a jolly old elf. They said,
[10:43.440 --> 10:51.360]  oh, you can't talk about that Santa Claus wears a green outfit. It's unbelievable fraud. Let me
[10:51.360 --> 11:08.880]  just stop there. Let me just stop there. The very same criminal groups that have brought you the
[11:08.880 --> 11:15.680]  overblown hoax of COVID-19, the very same groups that are telling us that we can never reopen the
[11:15.680 --> 11:28.160]  country again, but China's wide open are the same ones telling you that every day when black lives
[11:28.160 --> 11:35.200]  matter and anti for shoot up innocent people's cars, in many cases, brain damaging them and killing
[11:35.200 --> 11:43.360]  them, a whole bunch of deaths last three days, that that's peaceful while simultaneously saying
[11:43.360 --> 11:49.040]  we're going to burn the country down if Trump gets reelected in Atlantic monthly. Oh, and we're
[11:49.040 --> 11:53.680]  going to use the military to take Trump out if we challenge the election and he doesn't bow to that.
[11:55.200 --> 12:03.200]  I've got a bunch of compilations of people being shot and shot at when we come back.
[12:03.200 --> 12:07.920]  And I'm going to go over for radio listeners and narrate it, but you have to understand
[12:09.600 --> 12:18.000]  that this is systematic, terroristic activity being done to bring this nation to its knees
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.920]  and intimidate Americans. And people say, well, Americans won't be intimidated. This will backfire,
[12:21.920 --> 12:29.520]  really? Public schools and colleges all over the country, if you try to say man or woman on the
[12:29.520 --> 12:35.600]  entrance form will throw you out. We live in a cult. Look at political correctness.
[12:39.360 --> 12:45.280]  On YouTube, they get strikes on famous chess channels if white knight takes black pawn
[12:45.280 --> 12:49.760]  because that could be seen as racist. I was telling the lawyer that he didn't believe me.
[12:49.760 --> 12:58.000]  He pulled it up and his mouth fell open. That's the level of the cult and we've bowed to them
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.440]  so much for so long, they think we're going to bow to them again and forever.
[13:06.080 --> 13:11.120]  But one young man last night in Austin thought that too. And we'll play that when we come back.
[13:11.120 --> 13:16.720]  He's got his AK-47. He's too ignorant to know that it's actually like a Mac 90. It's a semi-auto.
[13:18.160 --> 13:22.000]  And he says, you know, I'd like to kill some police or, you know, have I killed cops,
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.080]  they'll kill me. So we'll see. He goes, none of these people out here that we're going to be
[13:26.080 --> 13:33.040]  menacing or threatening have got any balls. And so he said, well, you'll see what he said when
[13:33.040 --> 13:38.800]  we come back to play that first. And then he runs out into traffic and blocks people's cars.
[13:39.440 --> 13:42.960]  And the witness to say he raised the gun and there's video of him raising it up towards the
[13:42.960 --> 13:48.640]  window. And then you hear what sounds like rifle shots and then handgun shots. And some journalists
[13:48.640 --> 13:51.760]  are saying that that's why the news is being suppressed. What happened because it looks
[13:51.760 --> 13:56.400]  like just like a Somali in Seattle drove through. They were running around on the road at night.
[13:56.400 --> 13:59.840]  He hit two women. They wanted to say it was a white supremacist for days. They wouldn't say
[13:59.840 --> 14:04.000]  what color he was. There was a Somali guy that just got on the highway and people ran out in front
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.400]  of him at night. And you saw that story go away. But the point is, is that
[14:12.640 --> 14:16.880]  you heard, oh, white supremacist attacked somebody for no reason in Austin last night.
[14:16.880 --> 14:25.600]  And then we've got all this footage of BLM, mainly white people, and Antifa all over the country
[14:25.600 --> 14:31.360]  running out in roads and just shooting at vehicles or running up. But I kept saying, man,
[14:31.360 --> 14:36.000]  in a lot of areas of Texas, you run up and surround somebody's car and then point a rifle at them.
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.720]  It's not going to go well. But that's why the orders from Soros have come down in places like
[14:42.720 --> 14:46.960]  St. Louis with the McCluskey family, where they broke down their gate, came on their yard,
[14:46.960 --> 14:51.840]  were threatening to kill them. It's on the video. They pointed guns at them. One of them was a prop.
[14:51.840 --> 14:54.560]  They were lawyers. It was a prop from a case they had.
[14:57.840 --> 15:02.000]  And they swat teamed them. Now they've indicted them because they want the message that when we
[15:02.000 --> 15:07.920]  come to burn your house, you bow down and don't fight back so the riots can get steam and really
[15:07.920 --> 15:12.480]  burn down the country because they want the citizens to stand down and the police to stand down
[15:12.480 --> 15:18.320]  so they can take full control of all the government buildings just like the Bolsheviks did in 1917
[15:18.320 --> 15:24.080]  and refuse fascism and all the Soros funded groups admit that's their plan. And they just
[15:24.080 --> 15:29.120]  overthrew Ukraine five years ago with the very same groups and the very same tactics.
[15:31.680 --> 15:35.440]  And now Atlantic Monthly and others are saying, and remember what Maxine Water said,
[15:35.440 --> 15:39.360]  confront these people everywhere, attack them everywhere. And now they've gone to the head
[15:39.360 --> 15:45.280]  of DHS's house and they're threatening him because that's what they do. They went to
[15:45.280 --> 15:49.280]  Mitch McConnell's house and said, we're going to murder you. When Mitch said it was wrong,
[15:49.280 --> 15:54.640]  Twitter censored him. And Mitch McConnell thanked Twittering on his knees. So your capitulating
[15:54.640 --> 16:00.720]  is asking for this. The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational
[16:00.720 --> 16:08.240]  big tech bring in communist, shiny style, total net surveillance censorship with AI. The good news is
[16:08.240 --> 16:13.600]  they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover. This planetary
[16:13.600 --> 16:19.440]  corporate reset that COVID covers for because the truth is powerful and will defeat them
[16:19.440 --> 16:26.480]  and will smash them. And the good news is there are still sites like band.video, news wars.com,
[16:26.480 --> 16:32.080]  info wars.com, Paul Watson site summit.news and a lot of other great sites that are getting
[16:32.080 --> 16:39.520]  massive traffic. Thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the
[16:39.520 --> 16:46.160]  master of our own destinies. Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization,
[16:46.160 --> 16:51.520]  a war on our health, a war on our economy. But being aware of it and standing up to it and
[16:51.520 --> 16:59.360]  speaking out against it will defeat it. So take action or be slaves. As men age, they often
[16:59.360 --> 17:08.720]  experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness. And that's why we made one of

[18:00.400 --> 18:08.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:08.240 --> 18:25.760]  The social engineers, the globalists and their bought and paid for corporate media,
[18:25.760 --> 18:29.600]  it's back on the chai comms and every other America hating institution
[18:30.960 --> 18:35.680]  are counting on sucker punching the American people. But I've been reading the council on
[18:35.680 --> 18:40.560]  fine relations reports and tracking them since Trump got elected and they talked about triggering
[18:40.560 --> 18:46.400]  nationwide riots, calling it racial and then using that as the pretext to have a coup against the
[18:46.400 --> 18:51.440]  president. And then they think everybody will just sit down and fear and accept it, but they need a
[18:51.440 --> 18:56.160]  lockdown in place first. And that's what they're using the virus for. So you're used to being told
[18:56.160 --> 19:02.480]  stay in your home, do what we say. We've already put you into that artificial martial law. So here's
[19:02.480 --> 19:06.000]  the headline of the live show today. I hope you'll share it. That's how we reach new people and stop
[19:06.000 --> 19:11.360]  this red alert deep state dims have already launched a violent plan to overthrow the US government.
[19:12.640 --> 19:16.160]  Now let me show you some news articles that I'm going to play the clips proving it all
[19:16.800 --> 19:21.360]  shift. Trump will refuse to accept election results and allow peaceful transition, though
[19:21.360 --> 19:26.160]  they're the ones gearing up for total violence. Now with people being killed every couple hours
[19:26.160 --> 19:31.120]  and the media and lockstep covering it up. Leftist MAG issues threat violence and rise
[19:31.120 --> 19:36.880]  skyrocketed Trump wins election. That's Atlantic monthly black Trump supporter executed in broad
[19:36.880 --> 19:41.600]  daylight for holding up a Trump sign in Wisconsin. Leftist pledge anyone supporting Trump will be
[19:41.600 --> 19:48.160]  murdered. All they want to do is condemn law enforcement DHS secretary Chad Wolf blast
[19:48.160 --> 19:53.200]  Democrats on Fox News. They come to his house threatened to kill him. That's right. Tell him all
[19:53.200 --> 19:59.120]  dot com. Meanwhile, Portland rioters occupy exterior federal courthouse, raise American flag upside
[19:59.120 --> 20:04.720]  down because they're inverting it. That's he's true. The country is in crisis. That's coming up.
[20:05.920 --> 20:10.000]  Radio host mocks Trump by claiming Seattle's peaceful than rioters burned down his apartment
[20:10.000 --> 20:17.200]  building. Video Colorado BLM protesters shoots fellow demonstrator while aiming at a car that
[20:17.200 --> 20:22.320]  sped through the crowd. They just run on the highway trying to be hit and then glass them a Somali
[20:22.320 --> 20:25.200]  hit them so they couldn't say why it's the premise. The guy didn't know what was happening. He just
[20:25.200 --> 20:30.000]  ran out in front of midnight. Protests are rough across country. Black militia member accidentally
[20:30.000 --> 20:35.760]  shoots comrades in parts. Properly blames white supremacism. Black Lives Matter activists have
[20:35.760 --> 20:41.600]  their toddlers carry F the police signs and use them as human shields. Black conservatives stabbed
[20:41.600 --> 20:45.840]  by intimate during Portland Black Lives Matter riots. Shocking video. We're going to play all
[20:45.840 --> 20:53.040]  this next segment and the flag upside down. Austin protester allegedly armed with a key 47. I don't
[20:53.040 --> 20:57.520]  know why it says allegedly. He said he had a negative 47. It was a semi-automatic version of
[20:57.520 --> 21:03.840]  that shot by a driver while blocking traffic and approaching vehicle. We're going to get to that
[21:04.800 --> 21:09.920]  first right now. Listen to what by the way, it looks like this guy's background. You talk about
[21:09.920 --> 21:18.720]  a creep. I'm just going to leave it at that. You talk about bizarre and stupid larping out at
[21:18.720 --> 21:22.800]  night blocking traffic with a gunpoint and it's somebody's a threat. People have a right to defend
[21:22.800 --> 21:27.280]  themselves. But this individual, we've got his name, all the information's on him, full wars.com.
[21:27.280 --> 21:33.280]  Here's what he said about 10 minutes before he ran out with a mob to stop cars, pointed his gun
[21:33.280 --> 21:44.880]  reportedly at somebody and got shot. Here it is. A K 47. Where'd you got it out tonight? They don't
[21:44.880 --> 21:55.840]  let us march in the streets anymore so gotta practice some some of all right. Now I think the uh
[21:57.280 --> 22:03.840]  I mean if I use it up against the cops I'm dead and I think all the people that hate us and you
[22:03.840 --> 22:10.160]  know I want to say to us are too big of a pussies to stop and actually do anything about it.
[22:10.160 --> 22:16.160]  So why'd you start carrying? Well our roommate got arrested and they stopped letting us march
[22:16.160 --> 22:26.160]  anywhere so started carrying. You're a great virtue to say one or two. Talk about killing cops and
[22:26.160 --> 22:32.320]  what happens just a few minutes later because everybody's whips. So you run up and the photos
[22:32.320 --> 22:36.480]  are on info wars.com in the article about it. We have screenshots of it and he's there with the
[22:36.480 --> 22:40.800]  rifle up pointing at somebody and well you pointed a gun at somebody their son for no reason
[22:41.840 --> 22:46.400]  but you hear in the video it sounds like he's shooting first you hear a rifle shoot then you
[22:46.400 --> 22:51.280]  hear three shots return that are muffled and that's what experts are looking at the tape are saying
[22:51.280 --> 22:55.360]  but of course it'll be covered up by the leftist city of Austin if that is indeed the case but
[22:55.360 --> 22:59.920]  regardless run out in traffic block somebody point a gun at them this is what happens we have all
[22:59.920 --> 23:05.520]  these videos that just happened of them shooting at cars and actually shooting people and when it

[34:01.120 --> 34:07.520]  war to shape the battle space to fix this peacefully but if it's war they've been looking for it's
[34:07.520 --> 34:13.040]  war they're gonna get and you make sure folks you don't follow the medias programming if there
[34:13.040 --> 34:16.880]  is a real civil war breaks out which we're already in the early stages of now they're igniting it you
[34:16.880 --> 34:24.880]  don't go fight anti-fatrash and people in downtown with morons brainwashed it's who sent them and they
[34:26.640 --> 34:27.920]  want to come to our houses
[34:33.040 --> 34:37.680]  that's why all the real establishment are on private islands hiding out right now saying for
[34:37.680 --> 34:43.680]  covid they're not hiding out from covid they're all in new zealand because this is their communist
[34:43.680 --> 34:50.160]  overthrow and they're not gonna do the fighting and dying well i assure you in kawaii and in

[35:40.560 --> 35:48.880]  that way you dirty jackabin bolshevik trash and your billionaire owners are all gonna pay
[35:49.520 --> 35:54.400]  and when we're done it may not be me around to see it we're gonna dig you out of your holes
[35:54.400 --> 36:00.720]  and we're gonna make sure you face trial before you get marched up there
[36:02.320 --> 36:13.440]  on that platform on that gantry and before the man in that black face could pulls that lever
[36:14.000 --> 36:20.000]  and your neck snaps at the bottom of that rope and you're transported to the dimension of your
[36:20.000 --> 36:26.800]  children we know what you've chosen of your father the devil so you want your big bloody
[36:26.800 --> 36:32.480]  communist dream and you think it's gonna be so great you know the red terror was senseless
[36:32.480 --> 36:37.600]  they said why are we killing random people and linen said i want terror i want fear i want total

[36:56.640 --> 37:03.760]  and then shoot their own people yeah is everybody okay over there because you're all such heroes
[37:03.760 --> 37:08.400]  fighting nazis they think they're captain america and they're funded by george soros
[37:08.400 --> 37:16.080]  i mean imagine you pull into this and the person panics suddenly they're on the highway you see
[37:16.080 --> 37:21.280]  them in the full chopper video they're beating one car and the person goes this is scary i mean
[37:21.280 --> 37:24.800]  i'm not gonna stop with a couple thousand people attacking me
[37:26.800 --> 37:31.120]  and so they drive on through and then they start shooting at them
[37:31.120 --> 37:40.880]  let's go ahead and go to the next clip colorado drivers shot in the head by protester
[37:41.920 --> 37:47.760]  and he's a local liberal lawyer activist oh those loving liberal he's got this crazed look

[44:04.480 --> 44:10.160]  liberal west must be pulled down no better way to destroy true liberalism than to bring in the
[44:10.160 --> 44:17.360]  left hand path and destroy free open societies that's why soros captains the open society everything
[44:17.360 --> 44:25.440]  with him is an inversion it's the closed society the poor society the society under his and other
[44:25.440 --> 44:33.680]  globalist iron rule because they want to dominate your soul they want you to beg for every crime

[44:47.920 --> 44:53.120]  but why don't we just show the video the radio listeners a few weeks ago white supremac runs
[44:53.120 --> 44:58.400]  over peaceful protesters that had run out on the highway blocked it in a dark area of the road
[44:58.400 --> 45:04.640]  two women two white women live streaming get run over they run to attack the guys for beating
[45:04.640 --> 45:10.560]  his car he drives off they call it a hit and run until they find out it's a black guy and then the
[45:10.560 --> 45:18.000]  whole story got shut down but that's what happens here ladies and gentlemen when you're out on the
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.560]  highway at 130 and somebody that's been out partying comes driving on the road and boy that
[45:22.560 --> 45:28.960]  had been a white guy and we'd have pointed out you know that it was an accident i'd have been sued
[45:29.520 --> 45:35.520]  by university right there in seattle just like i was by georgetown for pointing out that soros
[45:35.520 --> 45:41.120]  collided all the people together a few years ago in virginia to create a crisis and one woman got
[45:41.120 --> 45:45.920]  killed they're suing me saying i'm saying they actually killed the woman physically themselves
[45:45.920 --> 45:50.560]  no i said like a chemistry set you set up the collision and then had the police push them
[45:50.560 --> 45:56.160]  together for the crisis and the democrats are now on record saying in the news we're going to create
[45:56.160 --> 46:02.480]  explosions all over the u.s to drive trump from power and they've bought full page ads in the new
[46:02.480 --> 46:12.080]  york times while they simultaneously have front line coming out with a multi-series show of complete
[46:12.080 --> 46:17.680]  fiction because i've talked to people that have been involved in the production unbelievable
[46:17.680 --> 46:23.760]  they're actually going to say i'm told that russians fund info wars wondering how much they
[46:23.760 --> 46:29.680]  had to pay people to say that look at this headline united states of conspiracy examines how three men
[46:29.680 --> 46:39.760]  alex jones roger stone and president trump helped to lay the foundation for the conspiracy theories
[46:39.760 --> 46:43.120]  to take center stage in america's national conversation
[46:43.120 --> 46:50.480]  and on the front page of their twitter front page of front line it's me at the evil
[46:52.320 --> 46:58.000]  austin rallies against compulsory mask how horrible we are
[47:01.120 --> 47:05.200]  here let's roll some footage of them a few weeks ago attacking armored vehicle while making jokes
[47:05.200 --> 47:08.960]  why do you have an armored vehicle well if we're going to go downtown and cover all this
[47:08.960 --> 47:15.760]  and you're going to come up armed with clubs and hammers and guns and then try to bash the windows
[47:15.760 --> 47:21.040]  out we need to be able to peacefully show how violent people you are so the media spun this
[47:21.040 --> 47:26.320]  and said we attacked our own vehicle in a false flag and then the media said we put fake bullet holes
[47:26.320 --> 47:33.200]  in the window nose hammer holes they did it antifa and then they said that we burned down a homeless
[47:33.200 --> 47:38.960]  camp because antifa isn't violent that's right we burned a homeless camp because we shot the footage
[47:38.960 --> 47:47.920]  of them burning the homeless camp uh-huh talk about being conspiracy theorist ladies and gentlemen
[47:47.920 --> 47:56.320]  this is how they operate each and every time so shiff has now joined polosi and the former
[47:56.320 --> 48:01.600]  attorney general eric holder and all the rest of them joe biden saying trump is a dictator
[48:01.600 --> 48:08.560]  that these the the federal police guarding courthouses are nazis why everybody's a nazi now
[48:08.560 --> 48:14.880]  except the real nazi collaborator george soros i remember just six months ago they had articles
[48:14.880 --> 48:20.800]  going jones is insane george soros is a philanthropist he doesn't fund black lives matter or antifa
[48:20.800 --> 48:28.400]  now soros is proud of this he's like i am doubling my funding hundreds of millions of dollars a year
[48:28.400 --> 48:35.280]  to this 200 million this year so far the black lives matter and antifa that we know of
[48:38.560 --> 48:43.120]  i'm being sued by a soros back suit and it says jones falsely claims
[48:44.400 --> 48:51.840]  that soros funded antifa in charlottesville and it's on the damn record in his own family name
[48:51.840 --> 48:59.840]  they gave the money i mean this is next level ladies but they don't care they don't care
[49:00.480 --> 49:04.320]  because they've got systems that all route us and they believe shut us down as if
[49:05.600 --> 49:10.000]  i can't jack into our awesome incredible supporters and listeners who are loyal to the truth of
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.440]  justice who will always amplify as long as they're alive our message and as they try to suppress our

[50:46.960 --> 50:52.160]  make me an enemy and they could use cia money and propaganda to try to shut us down and sue us and do
[50:52.160 --> 50:57.040]  all this and trump's never gotten full control of the c o g system and maybe he'll wake up now with
[50:57.040 --> 51:02.400]  99 days left because polosi's on tv saying i met with c o g last week and we've got a plan to

[53:51.600 --> 53:58.000]  live darts but one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party
[53:58.000 --> 54:03.840]  or at halloween but on top of that they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing
[54:03.840 --> 54:08.320]  to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else it's total virtues signaling to show that you're
[54:08.320 --> 54:13.760]  prepared for the force inoculations of contact tracing of their openly announcing it's an active
[54:13.760 --> 54:18.880]  submission it's an act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down but a big reason to wear
[54:18.880 --> 54:23.920]  these is then into stores when people ask you why you're wearing a halloween mask say it's just as

[56:20.400 --> 56:24.400]  and you know let let them come out for ted new jen the point is is that the organizer shut it down
[56:24.400 --> 56:30.080]  so ted new jen didn't go to it that's how the communists have us paralyzed and that's why the
[56:30.080 --> 56:34.880]  la mayor says oh it's good if you protest the police just no one else can you know protest though
[56:34.880 --> 56:39.840]  so anything else only communists are allowed to protest and they're all just teaching you these

[57:06.800 --> 57:16.080]  band on video we know that the prescribed pcr tests are not detecting the covet 19 genome
[57:16.800 --> 57:23.440]  according to the cdc's own literature the tests do not rule out bacterial infection
[57:23.440 --> 57:31.200]  or other viruses they are detecting all varieties of coronavirus including the common cold and
[57:31.200 --> 57:38.480]  counting it as covet 19 and it has been pointed out for months that the geographical locations
[57:38.480 --> 57:47.360]  experiencing the most cases of covet also seem to have active 5g technology after a video went viral
[57:47.360 --> 57:53.600]  in which david icke suggested that 5g is somehow responsible for positive cases of covet 19
[57:54.320 --> 58:00.400]  youtube deleted it and began deleting all videos on the subject including a video we
[58:00.400 --> 58:09.520]  made that pointed out how on october 31st of 2019 wuhan china became the first major test bed of 5g
[58:09.520 --> 58:19.520]  technology in late june a new scientific research paper entitled 5g technology and induction of
[58:19.520 --> 58:26.240]  coronavirus in skin cells was published this paper gives a scientific explanation of the
[58:26.240 --> 58:34.560]  relationship between 5g technology and the coronavirus unlike 4g or other radio waves
[58:34.560 --> 58:44.400]  the 5g millimeter waves can penetrate the nucleus of a cell the dna then acts as an inductor it reacts
[58:44.400 --> 58:52.000]  to the 5g waves by producing an electromagnetic field like a shadow the shape of the electromagnetic
[58:52.000 --> 59:00.080]  field reflects the hexagonal and pentagonal shapes of the dna base pairs this electromagnetic field
[59:00.080 --> 59:07.760]  produces holes in the cellular liquid hexagonal pentagonal voids are created in the nucleoplasm
[59:07.760 --> 59:14.960]  and to remedy this disturbance extra bases are created to fill the voids these bases then joined
[59:14.960 --> 59:22.640]  together to produce coronavirus like structures within the cell which the pcr test will read as a
[59:22.640 --> 59:34.320]  positive case of covet 19 the exosome the exosome was discovered in 1983 exosomes are created
[59:34.320 --> 59:42.320]  naturally within the cell to clean and repair cellular damage both exosomes and covet 19 are
[59:42.320 --> 59:51.920]  the same size and shape they both have the same ace to receptor and they both contain RNA exosomes
[59:51.920 --> 59:59.680]  behave and appear the same as a virus some scientists even claim that the so-called virus is in fact
[59:59.680 --> 1:00:08.000]  the exosome since the discovery of the exosome over 200 microbiologists have been murdered
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:16.480]  committed suicide or died in a suspicious manner if you question this mystery you are undoubtedly
[1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:24.160]  labeled a conspiracy theorist and if you question the current unproven virus theory you are labeled
[1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:31.440]  a science denier the only socially acceptable solution that you are allowed to accept is an
[1:00:31.440 --> 1:00:40.240]  experimental vaccine that will alter your dna which ultimately raises the question who owns your body
[1:00:42.240 --> 1:00:51.040]  for info wars dot com this is greg rees info wars tomorrow's news today coming up ted newton
[1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:58.160]  another part of the great awakening is taking place is people that haven't even been religious or
[1:00:58.160 --> 1:01:04.080]  christian now see how evil is out in the open how hundreds of churches have been burned in europe
[1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:10.480]  and the us hundreds of christian icons have been burned destroyed jesus's have had their heads cut
[1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:14.960]  off all over the country all over the philippines all over europe virgin marries are getting torn
[1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:20.560]  down i mean crosses are being torn down it's absolutely out of control but people now understand
[1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:26.720]  that evil was always real it is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:30.480]  building beneath the surface and now it's emerged that's why when i ask listeners and
[1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:34.880]  viewers for your prayer i mean it i'm praying for america i'm praying for you and i know the
[1:01:34.880 --> 1:01:39.280]  power of prayer is real and god hears it we need to come together and pray for an even greater
[1:01:39.280 --> 1:01:45.440]  awakening pray for donald trump to be protected pray for him to win a landslide and pray for the
[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:50.640]  people under deception of the globalist to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom god bless you
[1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:59.760]  all please pray for info wars as well big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to
[1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:09.120]  stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones all right i
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:13.120]  got a lot of questions for ted newton at this critical time with nine nine days out from the
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:18.400]  election on the sunday july 26 second hour the live broadcast i went to him just during the one
[1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:22.720]  minute break and i said what do you want to hit first we said everything in our lifetimes has
[1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:28.240]  been building towards what is happening now this is america fighting for its life ted newton joins
[1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:34.560]  us to talk about a story that i'm reading out of law enforcement today and i went and looked at the
[1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:39.280]  local news they are proudly announcing that the governor said in new york you're not allowed to
[1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:44.880]  have a pro police rally the state police help you're fired if cops come out you're fired you don't
[1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:51.040]  have speech but the communists everybody else do and you've seen de Blasio on tv saying oh
[1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:56.160]  communists have rights but nobody else does because they're so special this is the death of america
[1:02:56.160 --> 1:03:01.520]  and the headline says it all today we lost america and it gets into the situation i don't think we
[1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:07.040]  lost america yet but if we keep living on our laurels it's over so the motor city madman ted
[1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:12.400]  newton joins us to cover the waterfront thanks for coming on on short notice my pleasure alex
[1:03:12.400 --> 1:03:16.880]  i'm here to celebrate the good but it's not it's not easy to find right now there's an awful lot
[1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:23.680]  of bad and ugly but i really get the unique and humbling experience to maximize the good with the
[1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:29.120]  best of the best hardworking american families every day of my life but i was just uh returning
[1:03:29.120 --> 1:03:35.040]  from new york where another great family spent a fortune to get me and the good senator a good
[1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:42.000]  congressman clay higgins to a pro law enforcement rally a pro law and order rally the biggest one
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:47.440]  it was purported to be the biggest pro law enforcement law and order rally in the history
[1:03:47.440 --> 1:03:53.280]  of america they were expecting over 10 000 people because uh uncle ted was going to bring my six
[1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:58.640]  string weapon of mass construction to perform a fire breathing star spangled banner for the troops
[1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:06.240]  and boost their morale at a time where the marxist democrat antifa ms 13 black lives matter monsters
[1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:14.400]  have destroyed the morale of the law enforcement sheepdog heroes across this country most heart
[1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:20.160]  breakingly now as we witness the great heroes of the new york police department so we were ready
[1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:25.680]  to go like i said my buddy jenna's up there i had the guitar and amp we had the good congressman
[1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:31.200]  we had great great law enforcement heroes and their families gathering and i literally was
[1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:40.240]  threatened by mary by governor koalmo and his handpicked marxist health department nazis
[1:04:41.040 --> 1:04:48.640]  that if i set foot in new york to play the national anthem and thank the law enforcement heroes if i
[1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:58.080]  dare enter his communist new york area i would be put under house arrest and quarantine for 14 days
[1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:07.040]  thereby destroying the only chance to have a morale boost by the heroes of the nypd and boy
[1:05:07.040 --> 1:05:14.640]  are they pissed and i'm just speechless at this point that he literally says
[1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:20.320]  communists can march you can attack the police they beat up the police commissioner and the news
[1:05:20.320 --> 1:05:26.400]  called it peaceful i mean this is crazy and and then now you'll be arrested you'll be placed on
[1:05:26.400 --> 1:05:31.360]  house arrest you'll be kidnapped if you try to come play the national anthem this is next level
[1:05:32.160 --> 1:05:37.840]  you know we've known each other a long time alex and we've seen just indescribable but
[1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:45.120]  bizarre levels of criminal corruption and abuse of power by every alphabet soup you know government
[1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:52.480]  bureaucracy i mean who the hell trusts the cdc do you know anybody that trusts the cdc how about
[1:05:52.480 --> 1:06:02.640]  that james comey j edgar hoover al capone fbi punks that that obeyed an order to have a commando
[1:06:02.640 --> 1:06:10.560]  brown shirt gestapo attack on roger stone's house really you gotta you gotta bring machine guns
[1:06:10.560 --> 1:06:20.240]  to arrest roger stone and here's the horror of it these soulless dickless sheep of the fbi
[1:06:20.240 --> 1:06:28.960]  obeyed the immoral order that's what's frightening now i know a bunch of guys in the fbi in fact i
[1:06:28.960 --> 1:06:36.720]  went up there to new york with some good heroes of the fbi and god are they pissed off so any
[1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:41.440]  alphabet soup bureaucracy in the united states government right now whether it's the ira it's
[1:06:41.440 --> 1:06:45.600]  just like america it's divided it's got the america hating globalists in it that ran the
[1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:49.280]  hip and kool against trump and it's got the good guys but the bad guys are getting more and more
[1:06:49.280 --> 1:06:55.040]  control and we've got to route them because they're not americans the democrats openly now say they
[1:06:55.040 --> 1:06:59.040]  don't want the country to exist and so law enforcement everybody else has to decide which
[1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:04.080]  side are you on are you crazy they want to bring the country down this is insane yeah you know there
[1:07:04.080 --> 1:07:11.680]  were uh six bureaucrats soulless punks traders get glaringly guilty of treason their names are
[1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:22.000]  kevin abrahams syla boine carrie salagas debora mule ellen bernard and arnie trucker they signed
[1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:31.520]  a lie a hate stinking lie that dig this that dead new jen is a racist a homophobe and an
[1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:36.160]  anti-semite you know i was wondering at least maybe they should have probably talked to some of my
[1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:41.520]  black gay or jewish friends before they made those nats they know it's all lies they're the
[1:07:41.520 --> 1:07:47.440]  ones engaged in race baiting sure and here's the thing what worst thing can a human do to
[1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:57.200]  another human than to falsely accuse and and officially make a government document lying
[1:07:57.200 --> 1:08:04.320]  with that level of hate and they're doing it with impunity and again you know alex i gotta tell you
[1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:09.040]  my buddy flew me back home and i got out my bow and arrow and my fishing rod and i spent a wonderful
[1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:14.640]  couple days with my dogs on my my miraculous paradise here in texas so they they didn't hurt
[1:08:14.640 --> 1:08:19.440]  ted new jen at all i mean are you kidding me what can they possibly do to me and i'll tell you what
[1:08:19.440 --> 1:08:27.200]  nothing but you know what they hurt they hurt the spirit and the morale of the new york police
[1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:32.640]  department heroes and their families well that's the next thing is their open season the left wants
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:37.840]  to brutalize the police not to get rid of them but to take them over can you imagine the left
[1:08:37.840 --> 1:08:42.080]  when the antifa is now going to have the badges and the guns because that's the goal of this
[1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:46.640]  you know i can tell you the leader of the democrat party has made it perfectly clear i mean
[1:08:46.640 --> 1:08:50.160]  in between her felonies you know you don't need to read this you need to sign it the
[1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:55.200]  Nancy Pelosi committed a felony on tv ripping up your and my state of the union address right
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:09:01.040]  there on tv and she hasn't been tackled in handcuffed historic document yeah the point is
[1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:09.520]  she's leading the democrat party went into a tirade trying to find value and goodness in ms
[1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:18.960]  13 she said all god's children alex at what planet are these democrats and the by the way
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:26.880]  there's no difference between democrats antifa ms 13 the jihadists and the black lives matter
[1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:32.160]  they're all they're dedicated to destroy the very well that's my next question for you know
[1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:35.920]  we only got you one more segment here and i appreciate the time on this sunday the democrats
[1:09:35.920 --> 1:09:40.720]  are now saying shift is now saying Pelosi all of them that trumps a dictator and that when
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:44.400]  if he challenges the election that they say they're going to challenge it regardless if there's a
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:49.520]  like a 2000 argument that the pentagon's going to remove trump and then anyone that stands with
[1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:53.600]  trump will quote be put in prison that's the washington post headline so they're now planning
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:59.040]  a hot cool against the president how do you think we counter this well i i hope everybody writes
[1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:06.160]  this down i gotta come back out we gotta repeat this everybody listen hunt the vote dot org
[1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:12.320]  i'll say it again hunt the vote dot org you don't have to pay any money we already got the money
[1:10:12.320 --> 1:10:20.480]  behind it you need to register and vote if you believe in god family country constitution and
[1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:26.240]  freedom hunt the vote dot and you got to get a bunch of other people off there but to vote
[1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:34.160]  this revolution will be won in nove on november third 2020 hunt the vote dot org i'm telling you
[1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:42.480]  it sounds ridiculously simple because it is hunt the vote dot org just register and get to the
[1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:50.000]  front lines this is the alamo we need to shoot santa anna's men hunt the vote dot org absolutely
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:53.360]  we've got to go to break we'll do one more segment again please come back for you know
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:58.240]  longer in the week because things are so hot with nine nine days left we got 40 seconds to break but
[1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:02.400]  what happens if trump gets reelected i think he will but what are they going to do next
[1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:09.840]  well we've seen where uh the the antifa operates with impunity and trump is already
[1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:16.480]  uh mobilizing counterforces you know how dare the president bring in troops to bring back law and
[1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:22.640]  order as the democrat mayors and governors go no no don't stop the don't stop the arsonist
[1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:28.080]  don't stop the rioters don't stop the murderers and the assault don't mr president you must let
[1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:35.840]  them destroy my city i think i i don't know how to process that information so what's going to happen
[1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:42.480]  is that when we once again prove that god family country wins the election on november third the
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:47.280]  savages are going to be corralled and put in cages where they belong there's going to be a reckoning
[1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:57.840]  i agree chat do just our guests stay with us vicky gibbs 57 year old lesbian preacher in houston went
[1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:05.760]  in with a cough got intubated and then died and as soon as i saw her face as soon as i saw the report
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:11.600]  i said watch it'll be innovation we know what's gonna happen it's a blue city the same story yet
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:18.240]  again and they say her heart gave out if you put somebody on a breathing tube of covet 19 is a death
[1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:22.640]  sentence it's on record when everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed why
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:27.600]  are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities in blue states it's because they intubate them
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:33.760]  putting a tube in their lungs and covet 19 is causing an autoimmune response and if you do that
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:39.760]  with oxygen the doctors are on records saying it will kill you but all these doctors in blue
[1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:45.520]  cities in blue states follow their orders and the minute i saw this report today i knew what i would
[1:12:45.520 --> 1:12:53.040]  be reading don't end up like vicky gibbs or everyone it's time to take a new healthier approach to

[1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:34.240]  well there is ted newton years ago on fox news playing with star spangled banner
[1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:37.920]  now the nfl is talking about getting rid of it entirely in the american flags bad
[1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:41.760]  ted newton this is an attempt to overthrow the country and and and you told me before he went
[1:14:41.760 --> 1:14:46.240]  on air that this this is the moment of history this is the attempt to take down the country
[1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:50.000]  can you elaborate on that and then you were talking off air to me about how angry you are about
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:55.840]  the footage of them burning the outside with all the fire and all the smoke and all the things
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:15:02.160]  flying around and coordinated with shields attacking the federal officers and trying to break in
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:07.280]  with hatchets and then hitting them in the face with hatchets and clubs and this is all called
[1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:11.680]  peaceful and the mainstream media covers it up and as you were saying you were watching cbs this
[1:15:11.680 --> 1:15:16.560]  morning and you saw the editing for yourself a footage you've seen online that shows them attacking
[1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:21.840]  this is premeditated evil from the establishment trying to break down law and order ted newton
[1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:28.960]  well alice i think i have a a reasonable and an accurate overview of what we have here in
[1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:34.880]  the united states of america in 2020 i was born in detroit 1948 when it was universally known
[1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:40.000]  as the arsenal of democracy a lot of people don't know that because they went to school in america
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:45.920]  but detroit was the arsenal of democracy and the way the newton family conducts our life
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:52.320]  we continue in our homes to be the arsenal of democracy but i was there in 67 when all my
[1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:57.360]  buddies all my black musician friends we always jam together and collaborate we always hung out
[1:15:57.360 --> 1:16:03.440]  together and i had friends of every imaginable ethnicity and color and creed and walk of life
[1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:10.880]  and then in 67 they burnt down the city the the riders went berserk and burnt down their own
[1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:16.560]  city this beautiful architecture so i have a good perspective of the the goodwill and the positive
[1:16:16.560 --> 1:16:22.000]  brotherhood that existed amongst all of us in detroit and then a a lunatic friend's segment
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:28.240]  went nuts much like precursors to antipa then i was in los angeles in 92 when the rodney king
[1:16:28.240 --> 1:16:35.280]  burda came in and once again the idiots committed cultural suicide and destroyed their own neighborhoods
[1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:41.440]  and lives and viciously attacked and murdered people so what i'm seeing today it breaks my
[1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:48.880]  heart to admit but it's it's bigger and worse and uglier and more evil and it's best presented
[1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:57.920]  by the by the the propaganda ministry of the network uh news state network television stations
[1:16:57.920 --> 1:17:02.480]  and all pretty much all of them except fox and fox is no angel i believe me but compared to the
[1:17:02.480 --> 1:17:07.120]  rest of them they almost appear to be but i watched cbs this morning where they showed
[1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:12.720]  you know with this harsh accusation against the troops going after riders you know people they
[1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:19.200]  called them peaceful protesters peaceful protesters don't destroy buildings they don't have maltoff
[1:17:19.200 --> 1:17:25.440]  cocktails they don't kill retired cops and they don't wear helmets and have weapons on them that's
[1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:32.160]  not a peaceful protest but the way the propaganda ministry twists it if you're dumb enough and
[1:17:32.160 --> 1:17:39.600]  if you're stoned or drunk enough or just mentally deranged enough i suppose you can buy into that
[1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:45.360]  antifa might actually be anti-fascist when they actually are the fascist and black lives matter
[1:17:45.360 --> 1:17:52.720]  has absolutely nothing to do with black lives and by the way while you're talking we're showing
[1:17:52.720 --> 1:17:57.040]  footage from just two days ago of them burning the outside of the courthouse there's even more
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:03.360]  dramatic footage i mean this is crazy and i have video after video of them randomly running out on
[1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:08.560]  highways and shooting at random vehicles i have footage of them jumping on an old lady's car
[1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:14.000]  trying to pull her out of the car in austin last night and the media says this is good a bunch of
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:19.840]  thugs attacking old ladies what the hell has happened to the left they have gone completely crazy
[1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:25.040]  were they always this nuts they've always been this nuts but it's reached a new peak because
[1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:31.680]  of the tolerance to their their escalating danger their escalating insanity their escalating corruption
[1:18:31.680 --> 1:18:36.960]  their escalating criminality and again when you got the speaker of the house committing felonies on
[1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:44.560]  tv and trying to find worth and loving value in ms-13 that's a green light and an open door
[1:18:44.560 --> 1:18:50.800]  to go ahead and be as nasty and rotten and dangerous and evil as you want to be because the
[1:18:50.800 --> 1:18:58.480]  democrats we got your back antifa were with you and if that dog gone president trump tries to stop
[1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:03.280]  you from burning down the city we're going to try to stop him because we like it when you burn
[1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:09.200]  down the city so and again what they said about me being a racist and a homophobe and a and an
[1:19:09.200 --> 1:19:15.920]  anti-semite alex i've been surrounded by blacks and jews my entire life they own every record
[1:19:15.920 --> 1:19:20.880]  company they're my producers they're my friends they're my musicians they're my promoters they're
[1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:28.400]  my bandmates it's it's unbelievable the left the depth of dishonesty and hate and once again
[1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:34.960]  i'm going to read their names up in new york they are just evil kevin abraham's and syla boine
[1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:42.400]  carry soler just debora mule ellen bernum and arnie drucker lied and falsely accused me of those
[1:19:42.400 --> 1:19:53.200]  nasty conditions while they continue with their support for arson murder assault rape and total
[1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:59.360]  terrorism so this really is the planet of the cuckoo's nest and i couldn't be more proud to have
[1:19:59.360 --> 1:20:06.160]  that level of evil people hate me it proves i might even be better than i think i am well last
[1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:12.320]  time you were on your wife she's absolutely right especially in these times we've got to stay focused
[1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:17.920]  and and just appreciate god and family and not get too upset i get too upset uh and i know it
[1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:22.160]  upsets you but at at a certain point those of us that have been upset have been holding back the
[1:20:22.160 --> 1:20:26.160]  total takeover i think a lot of people that have been on the fence now know that this new world
[1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:31.040]  order takeover this commies takeovers real but they're wondering what can they do well go vote

[1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:42.880]  out against anti-fund BLM all of us have to have our voices heard calling to talk radio calling to

[1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:58.320]  percent the dream of the founding fathers that this is an experiment self-government where every
[1:20:58.320 --> 1:21:05.680]  american has a moral and spiritual obligation to be engaged in the process of determining who will
[1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:13.440]  represent we the people constitutionally the pillars of god family country individual freedoms

[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:19.120]  because there is a war on for your mind can you believe how we've been trained to not leave
[1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:24.800]  our houses when we're told we're masking them it's all a fraud and then i was watching a joe
[1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:30.880]  rogan clip yesterday because it was all over the news joe rogan's moving to texas you know i told
[1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:35.600]  you that a couple months ago remember and of course joe won't say where he's moving in texas
[1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:43.760]  he's like that's lengthening out the announcement that he's already moved to texas but oh wait i'm
[1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:54.080]  just joking and i wonder where he moved in texas but um i don't know spotify one completely crazy
[1:26:54.080 --> 1:27:01.760]  when joe told me i could say all that stuff then i kind of elaborated on it and kind of added some
[1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:06.320]  hyperbole probably because you know i took what joe said as well he's staring up the youtube
[1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:13.840]  staring up the sensors you know the stuff he told me but uh i'm not going to pontificate on that right
[1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:20.560]  now because it's part of a larger story that i want to hit at the start of the next segment but
[1:27:20.560 --> 1:27:26.080]  i will play the clip of joe talking about moving to texas because then he and his guests talk about
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:32.000]  you know is covid really bad and the new york times guy's like oh texas is now wearing masks because
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:36.320]  they figured out they were wrong it's really bad uh no they're passed laws with two thousand
[1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:41.600]  dollar fines in places like austin if you don't people are also online going why does joe sell
[1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:50.720]  a covid mask with info wars on it if he doesn't think it's real well a i do believe it's real
[1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:56.480]  we pioneered exposing it was man-made it's meant to infect everyone so you can all be suspect and
[1:27:56.480 --> 1:28:02.480]  so bill gates can patent a vaccine to bring you and that's all being confirmed now and if you've
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:09.200]  got to wear the mask have an info wars dot com on it so you can educate people and use their own
[1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:15.920]  suppression they're using against you on them but the reason i'm kicking this to the last segment
[1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:23.920]  is i forgot to tell the great crew that's been put up with me tonight to find some clips of sharia
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:33.280]  police in saudi arabia or in iran shia and anzuni there's footage everywhere of of burka police
[1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:39.920]  or hijab police arresting women that aren't wearing face coverings and then we've got footage of
[1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:44.400]  people being arrested or ticketed for not wearing masks or not wearing it correctly
[1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:52.720]  there's always more more more they want to get your submission so literally foushee is the hijab
[1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:58.320]  burka police so we'll get some of those clips together and then i'll respond to what
[1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:05.920]  joe rogan's guest had to say coming up next segment joe is bucking the mask he knows it's a bunch of
[1:29:05.920 --> 1:29:12.880]  bull he knows the virus is way overblown had a long talk with him a few weeks ago but i'm
[1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:19.120]  going to leave it at that but joe is very influential and and and and so i'd like to educate his
[1:29:19.120 --> 1:29:23.520]  listeners and when we do respond to joe things want to show that goes viral and so i can kind of
[1:29:23.520 --> 1:29:27.280]  piggyback on there and educate some people before it's too late so that's coming up next segment
[1:29:27.840 --> 1:29:30.240]  but let me hit this right now since i said i would do it
[1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:37.280]  and maybe we'll take this little clip and put at the end of the segment when we put out the
[1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:43.440]  last second to the last hour where i was talking about this alexander schultz and eason uh was
[1:29:43.440 --> 1:29:50.400]  sent for many many years to a frozen slave camp what he called the gulag archipelago and little
[1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:57.920]  islands all across the frozen tundra landscape and he came out and wrote a best-selling book
[1:30:00.080 --> 1:30:03.040]  titled gulag archipelago
[1:30:03.040 --> 1:30:14.000]  and here is a quote from the gulag archipelago 1918 to 1956
[1:30:15.120 --> 1:30:22.000]  and how we burned in the camps later thinking what would things have been like if every security
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:27.520]  operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he would return
[1:30:27.520 --> 1:30:34.400]  alive and had to say goodbye to his family or if during periods of the mass arrest as for example
[1:30:34.400 --> 1:30:40.560]  in leningrad when they arrested a quarter of the entire city people had not simply sat there in
[1:30:40.560 --> 1:30:46.800]  their layers pawling with terror at every bang on the downstairs door at every step on the staircase
[1:30:46.800 --> 1:30:53.600]  but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly shut up in the downstairs hall
[1:30:53.600 --> 1:31:01.120]  an ambush of half a dozen people with axes hammers pokers or whatever else they had the organs
[1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:08.080]  would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and notwithstanding
[1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:16.960]  all of stallence first the curse machine would have ground to a halt if if we didn't love freedom
[1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:23.760]  enough and even more we had no awareness of the real situation we purely and simply deserved
[1:31:23.760 --> 1:31:33.040]  everything that happened afterward now that's when the commies came in and took over the government
[1:31:33.040 --> 1:31:37.040]  with rioters and burning and then they got the government the police military to capitulate
[1:31:37.040 --> 1:31:42.800]  okay you're the boss and then they took over moscow took them two years to take over really
[1:31:42.800 --> 1:31:46.320]  five years the rest of the country and then they just started raping and killing and murdering
[1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:50.320]  and they're modeling all of it off of this and what mal did in china
[1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:58.400]  and kim jung un and you know his father and grandfather they set up the same system and
[1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:04.240]  gg ping denounced his own father his sister was beaten to death in front of him by a youth brigade
[1:32:04.240 --> 1:32:10.800]  he praised it and so now he runs the country because he literally sacrificed his family who
[1:32:10.800 --> 1:32:20.320]  were good people for nothing to worship communism because his father had been a communist and helped
[1:32:20.320 --> 1:32:23.920]  get them in power he was like the number three in the government but he said let's not murder all
[1:32:23.920 --> 1:32:28.320]  the farmers let's not kill the family and and and malsey tongue said i'm taking orders from
[1:32:29.200 --> 1:32:34.400]  the rockefellers we're we're gonna kill a large portion of our people that's the deal
[1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:40.080]  and so you know the rest of the story you know gg ping sits on top of it because he's one evil
[1:32:40.080 --> 1:32:47.440]  monster he took part multiple times in pilloring his father after he sent a decade into forced
[1:32:47.440 --> 1:32:52.880]  labor camp and they would do public communications when his father came back and gg ping would scream
[1:32:52.880 --> 1:32:57.120]  and yell and throw things at his father in front of everyone in the little youth and then little
[1:32:57.120 --> 1:33:01.440]  12 year old girls would run up and spit on him and throw rocks on him and and gg ping would sit
[1:33:01.440 --> 1:33:11.120]  there and denounce his father that's the type of trash that's gg ping he lives on his knees to satan

[1:38:57.520 --> 1:39:02.160]  they said what is your formal education i said well really nothing but a few years of college they
[1:39:02.160 --> 1:39:08.000]  said well how are you one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:14.000]  the stuff you come up with is just unbelievable we'd like you to be in movies we'd like you to
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:18.560]  write with us we'd like you to do voiceovers you're just a renaissance man and folks know i was in

[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:28.960]  explaining to him i said do you understand i didn't come up with any of this i'm reading globalist
[1:39:28.960 --> 1:39:35.040]  mit white papers and futurist documents and they would just laugh me and say oh no way
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:39.360]  then i would give them the documents they would get very very scared you know the next time i saw
[1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:44.800]  them in a few months and say man you're right this is dystopic folks i didn't make any of this up
[1:39:44.800 --> 1:40:00.720]  okay it's real it's real you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:21.360]  welcome back i'm your host alex jones coming to you from deep in the heart of texas austin
[1:40:21.920 --> 1:40:28.080]  here's the zero hedge headline the exodus begins well it actually began a long time ago
[1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:34.880]  joe rogan is leaving la for texas maybe he's already here because he wants a little bit more
[1:40:35.520 --> 1:40:39.440]  freedom he had a new york times writer on and they discussed it then they got into wearing
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:47.600]  mask it all ties together i'm going to get into that right now but think about this in iran
[1:40:48.480 --> 1:40:54.400]  in saudi arabia in sudan in more than 20 countries women have to fully cover their
[1:40:54.400 --> 1:40:59.600]  faces and where burk is full be keeper suits and the other countries they have to partially cover
[1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:04.080]  themselves up because you know a woman showing herself is very evil of another man sees it
[1:41:04.080 --> 1:41:11.200]  it now they have a movement in iran where women take them off and they get arrested they even
[1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:15.040]  get shot they even get killed but see that's because the woman's dirty she's bad she deserves
[1:41:15.040 --> 1:41:19.520]  that i guess under sharia law the left thinks that's really fashionable and cool and all these big
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:24.080]  leftist stores you show the jibs and the burkinis where women cover up their whole bodies to go
[1:41:24.080 --> 1:41:34.480]  swimming but now because we're all dirty and can have the evil covid we all have to cover ourselves
[1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:39.280]  because fouchy who's been wrong about everything and totally lied to us he says so and because the
[1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:46.000]  head of the un says it's only getting worse it's never getting better so that's where all this is
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:51.200]  going and police are brutalizing people in new york and places like miami florida all left
[1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:59.920]  hysteria is if they don't wear their new little sign of submission islam means submission well
[1:41:59.920 --> 1:42:07.680]  i'm not submitting to islam or to the nih or any of this but you know the who head is a communist
[1:42:07.680 --> 1:42:13.760]  islamist on top of it and and they know this is a sign of total control and slavery so boy
[1:42:14.560 --> 1:42:19.120]  ever thought it'd come here now they're saying the master basically permanent i played that clip
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:25.360]  in a special saturday show but you can pull it up who head says lockdown will never end prop
[1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:32.480]  said fouchy'd have us shut down three years he said 2.5 million would be dead it's 150,000
[1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:37.440]  most of them died of other diseases i heard a five-year-old died my wife was sitting there i said
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:41.200]  let me guess it says he had underlying conditions yeah it says multiple underlying conditions
[1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:46.640]  then you test false positive most of them are false positive
[1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:51.760]  it's incredible so we have to challenge this but here is the mask not see it's up on info
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:57.840]  works dot com woman maces couple with their children not wearing masks while eating at a park
[1:42:59.680 --> 1:43:04.080]  that's i've been in restaurants in austin our women come in at jibs and they're eating spaghetti
[1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:09.520]  under it like this what a clown show but now there's a crazy woman at a park in san diego
[1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:19.040]  a good liberal where they submit this is what she did to the family daring to go outside here it is
[1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:32.560]  what are you doing you cannot be serious you just you just made him you just made him you just
[1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:39.120]  made him you just made him and their food because you disagree don't worry i'm videotaping don't worry
[1:43:40.880 --> 1:43:46.640]  i'm not going that's not okay this is not for that is not okay not okay two people like that
[1:43:46.640 --> 1:43:51.680]  what's wrong with you lady that is wrong you're getting your ass beat i don't care who you are
[1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:58.960]  it's okay guys they want that power they want that control don't worry i got it you weren't
[1:43:58.960 --> 1:44:04.560]  offending yourself lady and i've got this did she hurt her i didn't do anything but see they say
[1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:09.280]  you're bad you're all suspect and so they're going to come literally spray your food like the wicked
[1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:16.880]  witch she's hiked her leg on you now let's shift gears joe rogan had joe desina of the new york
[1:44:16.880 --> 1:44:23.760]  times on and he's talking about i'm coming to texas i heard debbie crock is coming to texas
[1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:31.280]  sometime too i already got there sorry and then they get into oh texas are wearing their mask now
[1:44:32.400 --> 1:44:38.320]  well yeah in austin because it's basically la and there's two thousand dollar fines of a business
[1:44:38.320 --> 1:44:42.160]  doesn't have people do it five hundred for citizens totally unconstitutional it's got
[1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:46.560]  medical waivers in there but nobody tells you that if you say you have anxiety or whatever
[1:44:46.560 --> 1:44:51.280]  it's totally ineffective all the studies show it but notice the new york times guy goes oh texas
[1:44:51.280 --> 1:44:57.600]  got reality texas figured it out and they're wearing their mask now because that's so serious
[1:44:57.600 --> 1:45:01.680]  you mean they're doing a hundred times the testing and the tests are fraudulent on record i played
[1:45:01.680 --> 1:45:07.120]  a report earlier where the cdc admits it's not covet it's any type of viral or bacterial infection
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:13.600]  they're now sitting picks it up the test is a fraud but we just barrel forward with it they're
[1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:17.840]  counting people that died of other things in it it's 20 sometimes less than what they said would
[1:45:17.840 --> 1:45:22.960]  die and but notice it's never ending though it's not the 15 days the hospitals weren't filled
[1:45:22.960 --> 1:45:27.520]  it's forever because once you let a group take over like this they never turn loose we have a
[1:45:27.520 --> 1:45:33.680]  medical global tyranny this is the un running this telling us we must follow what the un says oh
[1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:41.440]  that's not who approved a communist the guy the heads of the who is an admitted communist
[1:45:41.440 --> 1:45:48.320]  bill gates is financing it all on record i'll show you something after this joe rogan clippet
[1:45:48.320 --> 1:45:52.240]  here let's go ahead and roll the clip uh with joe talking about he's coming to texas here it is
[1:45:52.240 --> 1:45:58.000]  and what's the story moving i'm out of here when do you leave soon texas are yeah i'm gonna go to
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:05.600]  texas i got a farm in vermont yeah it's a little cold it's cold i i i just want to go somewhere in
[1:46:05.600 --> 1:46:09.440]  the center of the country yeah somewhere it's easier to travel to both places and somewhere
[1:46:09.440 --> 1:46:14.400]  we have a little bit more freedom also i think that um where we live right here in los angeles
[1:46:14.400 --> 1:46:20.000]  is overcrowded and i think most of the time that's not a problem but i think it's exposing the fact
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:25.680]  that it's a real issue when you look at the number of pieces people that uh uh are catching
[1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:31.360]  covid because of this overpopulation issue um when you look at the traffic when you look at
[1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:36.640]  the economic despair when you look at the homelessness problem that's accelerated radically
[1:46:36.640 --> 1:46:42.160]  over the last uh six seven ten years i think there's too many people here i think it's not
[1:46:42.160 --> 1:46:46.720]  tenable i don't i don't think it's manageable and i think every mayor does a shit job of doing it
[1:46:46.720 --> 1:46:50.480]  because i don't think anybody could do a great job of it i think there's like certain things
[1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:55.440]  you're gonna have to deal with when you have a population of whatever the fuck la is it's like
[1:46:55.440 --> 1:47:00.240]  20 million plus people too many people it's too many people yeah that's what i think i think
[1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:04.640]  where you're living is probably the perfect way to do it it's 500 people that's nuts but then you
[1:47:04.640 --> 1:47:09.680]  got those uh dudes yelling at you where's the deer you understand the language i could go on we could
[1:47:09.680 --> 1:47:16.400]  do it hours of the negatives of a small town oh yeah there's negatives everybody knows your
[1:47:16.400 --> 1:47:21.520]  business yeah everybody knows what you're doing where you're going you know there's pros and cons
[1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:27.280]  to everything but i think uh i think you have a better opportunity at more pros when there's less
[1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:35.520]  folks agree so so small town texas or let's just leave it at that yeah i got ideas james
[1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:39.600]  we got him he's all excited it doesn't affect the business no we're just gonna do it from there
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:43.600]  but that's the other thing is texas has comedy they have stand-up comedy i've been doing i did
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:48.240]  well i haven't been doing but i did one weekend in texas while all this was going on it was the
[1:47:48.240 --> 1:47:53.680]  first weekend i was able to stand up but then my friends were in uh san Antonio and they got
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:58.000]  covid down there but those knuckleheads were out there talking to people and shaking hands and taking
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:04.320]  pictures and stuff and texas would be the last stand place to ever wear a mask or not shake a hand
[1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:08.960]  they wear masks though people are wearing masks last time i was there i think now they're woken up
[1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:16.000]  right well this is a weird disease man all right and you know i've talked to joe about this and he
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:19.680]  said no you're the first person telling it was man-made so doesn't that make it deadly no it's
[1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:24.320]  man-made so it's a chimera so it's artificial so these labs can own it and control it and
[1:48:24.320 --> 1:48:29.200]  own the testing for it and it's all fraud and we've detailed this here's an example right here
[1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:35.200]  sinclair bigger than fox news thousands stations across the country says it will postpone and rework
[1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:40.560]  segment featuring conspiracy theory about fauci with the eric bowling show i personally sent
[1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:45.040]  bowling articles about this in the last few months he knew all about it already and what did he cover
[1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:52.320]  nyh.gov nyh lifts funding pause on gain of function research with coronaviruses
[1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:57.360]  dr fauci back controversial wuhan lab with us dollars for risky coronavirus research at wuhan

[1:53:09.440 --> 1:53:16.960]  and everybody should remember this the globalist their pedophile rings their satanic networks how
[1:53:16.960 --> 1:53:20.960]  they operate how they control people how they get people inducted into evil so they know they'll
[1:53:20.960 --> 1:53:25.520]  carry out whatever they're told that's all falling apart that's why they're throwing race war at us
[1:53:25.520 --> 1:53:30.720]  and mask and all the rest of it trying to tear society apart trying to bring in a depression
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:36.240]  where they can reset the global economy for all the fraud they've created and blaming on covid
[1:53:36.240 --> 1:53:40.960]  it's not covid causing the worldwide starvation or the worldwide collapse it's the hoax these
[1:53:40.960 --> 1:53:47.040]  criminals launched and look emblematically all of their evil crones are rotting and dying like
[1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:54.640]  ginsburg and the rest of them and and and nadler stumbling around gaslighting everybody so don't
[1:53:54.640 --> 1:53:58.400]  think they're all powerful learn to say no to them that's some good news coming up start the next
[1:53:58.400 --> 1:54:04.880]  segment but here is the head of the un's global response unit that then right down to texas right
[1:54:04.880 --> 1:54:10.240]  down to california we follow the orders of and now that's why they're saying you gotta wear a mask
[1:54:10.240 --> 1:54:16.160]  in your house we gotta take your kids away here it is and at the moment in most parts of the world
[1:54:16.160 --> 1:54:21.360]  due to lockdown most of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:27.680]  happening in the household at family level in some senses transmission has been taken off the streets
[1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:35.520]  and pushed back into family units now we need to go and look in families to find those people who
[1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:41.760]  may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a in a safe and dignified manner right after he
[1:54:41.760 --> 1:54:45.920]  said that light foot of chicago nuisance in california all of them came out and said the
[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:51.680]  exact same thing they admit they follow the un orders directly that itself is revolutionary corruption
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:59.120]  patrick what do you think how should we respond to to this level of tyranny
[1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:05.200]  well you know what alex if you study allister crowley allister crowley was the most influential
[1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:10.400]  person of the 20th century and allister crowley's influence can be felt in everything and his magic
[1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:16.080]  rituals which now form you know so much of our government policy and and our media and our
[1:55:16.080 --> 1:55:20.400]  institutions because these people infiltrated and subverted everything it all has to do with
[1:55:20.400 --> 1:55:24.320]  children and that's what we're seeing with child protective services they want to use coronavirus
[1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:29.520]  as a pretext to take people's kids away and then do god knows what with them and we know what they
[1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:34.560]  do with these children with the with the ceremonies and we know what was going on down in epstein island
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:41.680]  now you are you are right they are not invincible this is a modern kind of takeover and subversion
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:46.240]  attempt they're not the establishment giving calling them the establishment gives them too much
[1:55:46.240 --> 1:55:51.440]  credit they're criminals they're rogue sicko criminals who have taken over in recent decades
[1:55:51.440 --> 1:55:57.200]  now if you look at the nexus of power of this which revolves around frankly some massad families
[1:55:57.200 --> 1:56:03.040]  including maxwell family ronfman family they're good friends who they've partnered with um and
[1:56:03.040 --> 1:56:08.960]  these hanger-ons like alan dershowitz who provides the the legal expertise and jeffrey
[1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:14.240]  epstein who is running this blackmail operation down on pedophile island with the satanic temple
[1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:20.000]  there and the owl statue and all the videotaping and you know elaine maxwell she really is royalty
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:25.040]  in this world so you know now that this kind of stuff is collapsing we're beginning to see
[1:56:25.040 --> 1:56:31.920]  how fragile it is if they if there's an economic reset if these people somehow lose their money
[1:56:31.920 --> 1:56:37.520]  it's all over i mean they have been hoodwinking us with hollywood and the media for a few decades
[1:56:37.520 --> 1:56:43.440]  but they're not invincible the willpower of the people is stronger than them and the normie class
[1:56:43.440 --> 1:56:48.640]  that they have created the hysterical emotional people who watch oprah and elin de generis and
[1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:53.600]  think that they don't have to improve themselves because oprah empowers them okay those people
[1:56:53.600 --> 1:56:59.600]  are not going to have power anymore in our new society because real smart competent men are going to
[1:56:59.600 --> 1:57:05.680]  lead well let me tell you're always powerful but you're really fired up right now and i'm loving
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:09.440]  it and i'm seeing the great articles you're writing daily over at national file dot com we're

[1:57:15.920 --> 1:57:20.800]  gislaine maxwell but i want to hit what's happening with the mask rebellion there's really a symbol
[1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:27.280]  of the slaves it's like the hijab uh or the burqa is and where you see that fight going and of course
[1:57:27.280 --> 1:57:31.200]  we'll play the club of the lady attacking the family at a picnic table not wearing their
[1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:36.160]  hijabs while they eat she should move to saudi arabia she'd love it they'll be right back i'm

[1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:51.520]  the bad news is western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in
[1:57:51.520 --> 1:57:57.920]  communist chinese style total net surveillance censorship with ai the good news is they had to
[1:57:57.920 --> 1:58:04.080]  do that to carry out this world government covet takeover this planetary corporate reset
[1:58:04.080 --> 1:58:10.160]  the covet covers for because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them and the
[1:58:10.160 --> 1:58:17.280]  good news is there are still sites like band dot video news wars dot com info wars dot com
[1:58:17.280 --> 1:58:22.560]  paul watson sites summit dot news and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic

[1:58:30.560 --> 1:58:36.480]  destinies ladies and gentlemen there is a war on reality a war on civilization a war on our health
[1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:42.000]  a war on our economy but being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:57.920]  will defeat it so take action or be slaves
[1:59:12.240 --> 1:59:14.800]  she played in the street the town of chicago
[1:59:16.560 --> 1:59:18.880]  she played on the rise and followed with me
[1:59:19.600 --> 1:59:26.800]  best to get a journalist right marty you name it is here with us breaking down the big picture
[1:59:27.840 --> 1:59:33.600]  integrating this in with them activating the race riots through soros activating the covid
[1:59:34.400 --> 1:59:38.320]  lockdown saying that their communists are allowed to march and attack and be violent but
[1:59:38.320 --> 1:59:42.240]  you're not allowed to have peaceful probe police rallies clearly it's an overthrow of the country
[1:59:42.240 --> 1:59:46.960]  but now we have it landing monthly the cfr and others saying we're doing this to overthrow
[1:59:46.960 --> 1:59:51.440]  trump you better leave officer will burn america down they're actually said that this weekend
[1:59:51.440 --> 1:59:55.840]  that it landed monthly it's worked in so many other countries just worked six years ago in
[1:59:55.840 --> 2:00:00.880]  ukraine that's why they're so arrogant then they go attack the courthouse the media covers it up
[2:00:01.760 --> 2:00:06.800]  and says they're peaceful but i don't think it's working what's the big picture what do you expect
[2:00:06.800 --> 2:00:13.600]  them to pull next with 98 days out well alex i know everybody likes to be politically correct
[2:00:13.600 --> 2:00:19.040]  but you have to understand how racial Maoism and racial communism works which is they are in fact
[2:00:19.040 --> 2:00:24.000]  targeting white people demonizing white people they're explicitly saying that the republican
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:29.920]  party will not respond to this even though the majority of the people who vote for the republican
[2:00:29.920 --> 2:00:34.800]  party who elect them to office are the white christian evangelical middle class and so those
[2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:39.520]  people are getting frustrated young people are getting frustrated when they see themselves demonized
[2:00:39.520 --> 2:00:45.440]  every day on espn by their sport stars by by these guys who are kneeling for the national anthem and
[2:00:45.440 --> 2:00:49.600]  they're being treated like heroes and meanwhile they're burdened with that they can't get a job
[2:00:49.600 --> 2:00:54.480]  because all the corporations are woke and this stupid scam demic has shut down the small business
[2:00:54.480 --> 2:00:58.960]  economy and now fouchi wants you to wear a disgusting face diaper on your face breathe in your carbon
[2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:04.000]  dioxide so people are beginning to lose hope millennials only own three percent of the wealth
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:09.280]  in this country plus they have debt and they have a very bleak future with globalist mass migration
[2:01:09.280 --> 2:01:16.000]  and so there needs to be people leaders reaching out to them and and making them feel like it's
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:21.040]  not hopeless we're going to rally behind western civilization and it's it's not a racial thing with
[2:01:21.040 --> 2:01:25.200]  us but you know what it's a racial thing with the other side they hate white people but they're
[2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:29.680]  going to come for black people next because it's replacement migration they're going to come for
[2:01:29.680 --> 2:01:36.320]  legal hispanics next they're going to keep continuously replacing people and genociding
[2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:43.840]  people because they want the entire slave class to be kind of this mongrel race that doesn't
[2:01:43.840 --> 2:01:48.640]  compete with them and doesn't even live in the same universe as them well that's right a group
[2:01:48.640 --> 2:01:53.440]  that doesn't have any culture that's been overwritten they they they use the third world
[2:01:53.440 --> 2:01:58.160]  enslave them break them down on record then they open the borders flood us with the third world
[2:01:58.160 --> 2:02:03.040]  filling them full of race-based hate while they tell us to stand down because we're inherently
[2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:08.000]  bad and the corporations conquer all of us take all of our rights and then carry out the extermination
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:13.920]  using super bio weapons they've already got geared up this is gate said on national tv on
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:18.880]  coberry said oh this is just a drill the real one's coming terrorists are going to release it
[2:02:18.880 --> 2:02:25.200]  and he started smiling and laughing when he was on national japanese television they said are you
[2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:29.680]  depopulating he said listen we got different vaccines for different countries and groups
[2:02:30.240 --> 2:02:35.120]  don't worry the poor people really need this we need to make sure there's not overpopulation
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:40.640]  he says it he doesn't even hide it and it's crazy i don't want to be flooded with a bunch of brain
[2:02:40.640 --> 2:02:45.760]  wash people from you know africa or wherever that want to kill me i okay the same time i don't want
[2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:51.840]  to murder all of them i mean that's what and then you study epstein and gisling maxwell and the
[2:02:51.840 --> 2:02:57.120]  rockelfellers and they're all crazy evil people way worse than the most crazed african so i mean
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:03:03.760]  what i'm saying is it's like it's a nightmare scenario with these people absolutely right and
[2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:10.160]  this all ties in i mean everything is related over the last few decades gilin maxwell's nephew
[2:03:10.160 --> 2:03:14.800]  was a top ranking official in hillary clinton's state department overseeing the middle east
[2:03:14.800 --> 2:03:21.520]  specifically overseeing libya libya during the time of of benghazi now sarah bruntman who was
[2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:26.640]  part of running the nexium cult okay bruntman's and maxwell's have been partners traditionally
[2:03:26.640 --> 2:03:31.360]  over the years both very closely linked to the massage sarah bruntman was working on you know
[2:03:31.360 --> 2:03:36.880]  agitating on behalf of the rebels and using the rebels which became isis as their own personal
[2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:42.160]  fighting force so they were destabilizing that region bush was in on it chainy was in on it
[2:03:42.160 --> 2:03:47.840]  both parties rove obama mccain these are sick people and there's no difference between any one of
[2:03:47.840 --> 2:03:53.600]  them this is a sick agenda that has been put forth in recent decades and it's up to people like us
[2:03:53.600 --> 2:03:59.040]  to finally free people's minds and uh and wake people up and uh you know you're one of my heroes
[2:03:59.040 --> 2:04:03.520]  alex i've been listening to you since high school people are waking up i think probably even the
[2:04:03.520 --> 2:04:10.320]  majority of the people now get it they really get it what do you make of trump because i did
[2:04:10.320 --> 2:04:14.640]  research on trump obviously i was covering epstein 15 years ago covering the pedophile stuff
[2:04:14.640 --> 2:04:19.440]  you know before that and you know not just once he got indicted no the rest i was aware of these
[2:04:19.440 --> 2:04:24.880]  operations i knew that he was there to corrupt scientists and was just an operative in it uh
[2:04:24.880 --> 2:04:28.480]  so so i wouldn't support him he was really connected he never got on the plane he didn't
[2:04:28.480 --> 2:04:32.400]  you know he had his golf club he came to that came to events they knew each other he knew gisling
[2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:36.960]  why would he say in that press conference oh i wish her well i think he means he hopes she
[2:04:36.960 --> 2:04:40.960]  doesn't die in custody so we find out what's happening let's go ahead and play that clip and
[2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:46.320]  get what you think and so a lot of people want to know if she's going to turn in powerful people
[2:04:46.320 --> 2:04:50.800]  do you feel that she's going to turn in powerful men how do you see that working out i don't know
[2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:55.920]  i haven't really been following it too much i just wish her well frankly uh i've met her numerous
[2:04:55.920 --> 2:05:01.120]  times over the years especially since i lived in palm beach and i guess they lived in palm beach
[2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:06.960]  galane maxwell is accused of sex trafficking underage girls for the late convicted sex offender
[2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:14.160]  jeffrey epstein charges she denies and intends to fight the president is among several well-known
[2:05:14.160 --> 2:05:20.400]  people linked to the pair the intent of this briefing was to provide an update on what donald
[2:05:20.400 --> 2:05:27.680]  stop there so why would trump who's called epstein degenerate the horrible person who in 2015
[2:05:27.680 --> 2:05:30.960]  you know told bloomberg that it was a horrible degenerate things happening at the island they
[2:05:30.960 --> 2:05:38.480]  were horrible people why would he then make that statement uh patrick howie because he wants her
[2:05:38.480 --> 2:05:42.720]  to talk and you know you've also got keith reniere out there here's another thing to keep in mind
[2:05:42.720 --> 2:05:47.360]  keith reniere of the nexium called who like epstein was another outsider connected to the
[2:05:47.360 --> 2:05:53.520]  bronson access connected to the bronze men's and his uh sentencing has been indefinitely postponed
[2:05:53.520 --> 2:05:58.240]  so we want him to talk to we want to keep him safe we want to keep these people safe look i've been
[2:05:58.240 --> 2:06:02.320]  an insider that's exactly what i thought trump was doing he's he's letting her know hey we wish her
[2:06:02.320 --> 2:06:08.640]  well you better tell us well that's right alex i i worked for steve bannon 2015 2016 i've been an
[2:06:08.640 --> 2:06:14.080]  insider on a lot of this stuff and here's what happened all right early 2015 i i wrote an article
[2:06:14.080 --> 2:06:18.640]  of these documents uh talking about how epstein pleaded the fifth when he was asked about his
[2:06:18.640 --> 2:06:23.760]  friendship with bill clinton immediately after that donald trump went to cpec did an interview
[2:06:23.760 --> 2:06:29.120]  with sean hendry where he said bill clinton's got an epstein problem he was fanning the flames of this
[2:06:29.120 --> 2:06:34.160]  epstein stuff the entire time and you know what he was an informant the first time they busted
[2:06:34.160 --> 2:06:38.160]  epstein for pedophilia epstein gets out of jail he gets a little country club sentence
[2:06:38.160 --> 2:06:42.400]  george stefanopoulos is still hanging out with him katie kark is hanging out with him woody
[2:06:42.400 --> 2:06:48.240]  alan all these big people okay but trump was the informant who tried to bring him down okay so it's
[2:06:48.240 --> 2:06:54.320]  no coincidence that all this and as soon as he got indicted trump threw him out of the club absolutely
[2:06:54.320 --> 2:06:58.480]  right he's been on to epstein and we're not just defending trump we're defending the truth
[2:06:58.480 --> 2:07:02.880]  trump from day one has not been part of this but he's has big public parties in his club of course
[2:07:02.880 --> 2:07:09.520]  he's known epstein trump's old money and he's a patriot and he is part of the industrial class
[2:07:09.520 --> 2:07:15.680]  that built this country he doesn't want subversives he doesn't want exactly i'm gonna do one more
[2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:18.720]  segment explain this because you because you didn't know all the inside baseball and i concur with you
[2:07:18.720 --> 2:07:24.320]  but trump isn't going to a russian hotel to get pissed on he's actually a germaphobe and doesn't
[2:07:24.320 --> 2:07:28.400]  like that kind of stuff he doesn't like little girls he likes big bombshell women that are
[2:07:28.400 --> 2:07:32.880]  intimidating that's his what he's well known for he's a powerful man he's not i mean i mean look at
[2:07:32.880 --> 2:07:38.560]  the women he's with big big bombshells the point is is that these creepy globalists like women that
[2:07:38.560 --> 2:07:44.240]  look like little kids that's who they are and they want little kids because they want power over them
[2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:49.200]  because they're creepy sickos so it's not about defending trump the media's attempts to tie him
[2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:54.720]  to epstein are a smokescreen from the clinton's and the rest of it patrick yeah that's absolutely
[2:07:54.720 --> 2:07:59.200]  right and trump is a religious man and he's a christian and i think he's had a big awakening
[2:07:59.200 --> 2:08:04.240]  late in life he wants to stop these people he knows what satanism is just as well as anybody else
[2:08:04.240 --> 2:08:08.800]  he wants to stop these people and uh it's going to be up to citizen journalists on the outside
[2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:13.760]  to help him to give him the justification that he needs we are going into a very very tough
[2:08:13.760 --> 2:08:19.360]  election but you know what the chess board is getting very complicated trump has a lot of cards
[2:08:19.360 --> 2:08:23.760]  he's got a lot of cards and he's playing those cards i can tell you that that was my next question
[2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:27.440]  one more segment before the google whistleblower with all his breaking news a lot of pieces are
[2:08:27.440 --> 2:08:31.520]  moving on the board right now what are our aces in the holes what do we expect to happen with 98
[2:08:31.520 --> 2:08:37.600]  days i hope trump doesn't hold his powder too long he needs to start i think unloading those cards
[2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:45.760]  now he needs to hit them now stay with us with the right back the people are awakening they're
[2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:50.800]  taking control of their own environment cell phones are an amazing tool really they're a
[2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:56.240]  super computer that's handheld but big tech large corporations hackers governments foreign
[2:08:56.240 --> 2:09:02.480]  governments the chai comms especially are using this to steal your data to share your data to be
[2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:07.120]  able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data they can actually
[2:09:07.120 --> 2:09:14.400]  predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements cutting them out of that data stream
[2:09:14.400 --> 2:09:20.240]  absolutely devastates their ai takeover in their own words they admit it show i've been selling

[2:12:15.360 --> 2:12:20.160]  turmeric formula so be sure and take action on that all right patrick howley speaking of
[2:12:20.960 --> 2:12:26.560]  trumps ammo what he's gotten this quiver of arrows here and and and what you expect him to do
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:31.520]  i think he should start firing almost everything now early the enemy's doing that because they
[2:12:31.520 --> 2:12:35.360]  know they're behind it i believe they know they're desperate they know they're in trouble and so
[2:12:36.160 --> 2:12:39.760]  they're trying to overthrow and they're trying to killing but they're saying they're going to use
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:44.560]  the military to take them out i think waiting is not smart i think he should decisively destroy them
[2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:50.880]  right now absolutely 100 correct look at the the paradigm that we have now which is pretty amazing
[2:12:50.880 --> 2:12:57.200]  you've got harvey weinstein is in jail you've got keith renare who is in jail you've got geelyne
[2:12:57.200 --> 2:13:02.720]  maxwell who's in jail we had jeffrey epstein we didn't see it coming that they were gonna kill him
[2:13:03.280 --> 2:13:08.000]  he didn't kill himself that's for sure and you know what we've got these nexium people
[2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:13.040]  who are still out there we've got tons of nexium witnesses we have a lot of different people who
[2:13:13.040 --> 2:13:18.240]  can talk and we're unraveling this network and so it's basically an agatha christy novel right now
[2:13:18.240 --> 2:13:22.560]  where who's gonna flip on who these people all know each other they all know what they've been up to
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:28.320]  we all know what they've been up to and so it's it's an amazing opportunity right now to really
[2:13:28.320 --> 2:13:32.080]  shift the balance of power in the whole world because these people haven't been in power for
[2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:38.080]  very long as i said before trump is old money he's an industrialist he doesn't like seeing
[2:13:38.080 --> 2:13:44.080]  his country get ruined and subverted by these criminals who just went on a criminal sprain
[2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:49.040]  everything trump does is about service economy which is a human economy he's pro-human
[2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:55.120]  that's right he's a humanist absolutely right and we're going into a very sinister technocracy
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:14:00.720]  if these uh evil people if these satanists are allowed to stay in control uh we don't want that
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:06.320]  and so you know we're in a great situation right now where we have these people where we want them
[2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:11.760]  and we don't want them to get killed we we want guillain maxwell to be alive we want
[2:14:11.760 --> 2:14:16.080]  keith raniere to be alive there's a reason why keith raniere's uh sentencing has been
[2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:20.880]  indefinitely postponed there's a reason why they're pressuring clear broncman sarah broncman
[2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:24.320]  notice how they criticized trump when he went to that church and said it was the worst thing ever
[2:14:24.320 --> 2:14:29.200]  no he needs to fully embrace christ and god and and he will absolutely win and the country will
[2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:34.160]  save itself so they always attack what is most effective they trump needs to whatever they're
[2:14:34.160 --> 2:14:40.960]  attacking he needs to do that yes absolutely right now you mentioned the mask being similar
[2:14:40.960 --> 2:14:46.560]  to the burqa and you have to understand that these globalists use islam they manipulate islam they
[2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:51.760]  went over there and they had our troops our heroes who we admire and we and we respect
[2:14:51.760 --> 2:14:58.240]  and they turned them against our own interests and they had them funding and arming and training
[2:14:58.240 --> 2:15:04.000]  the jihadist groups and building the isis network that now threatens us all over the globe because
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:09.440]  they wanted isis to be their private fighting force and they gave isis management of the syrian
[2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:14.080]  oil wells okay there was never any nationalization of the oil wells during bush and cheney in that
[2:15:14.080 --> 2:15:19.360]  region so isis got the oil wells they were making a tremendous amount of money they kept it all off
[2:15:19.360 --> 2:15:23.520]  the books when ambassador stevens you know was going to blow the whistle on what was going on
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:28.720]  with the gun running all of a sudden hillary clinton posts his itinerary on her non-secure
[2:15:28.720 --> 2:15:34.080]  private server and then oh well uh some of our uh jihadist friends got them i guess uh
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:40.080]  you know it was spontaneous reaction to a youtube video well who was overseeing libya at the time
[2:15:40.080 --> 2:15:44.640]  geely maxwell's nephew within hillary clinton state department and sarah bruntman and the
[2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:49.840]  bruntman family all of these people are connected everything horrible that has happened in the
[2:15:49.840 --> 2:15:55.200]  last 20 years or so is all connected to these people and now a lot of them are in jail and
[2:15:55.200 --> 2:16:00.160]  there's also a civil war inside israel and i'm not saying netanyahu is perfect but clearly the
[2:16:00.160 --> 2:16:06.800]  rothschild's uh the own and run the economist they hate netanyahu worse than they hate trump what's
[2:16:06.800 --> 2:16:15.280]  the split there well um you know netanyahu supports trump and uh you know it's it's again it's you
[2:16:15.280 --> 2:16:19.840]  know there will be people who say if you point out the massad connections to these people that's
[2:16:19.840 --> 2:16:24.640]  somehow anti-semitic and we have to get out of that it's not anti-semitic i'm an irish guy you
[2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:29.120]  think i'm going around saying i'm offended if people criticize john brennan or james comey
[2:16:29.120 --> 2:16:33.360]  the intel agencies don't even represent the countries that they're affiliated with anymore
[2:16:33.360 --> 2:16:36.960]  yeah so their own models well that's why i was asking the question not even to defend israel
[2:16:36.960 --> 2:16:41.760]  at israel's system just a group like the us a bunch of factions what i'm saying is it was omert
[2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:47.040]  and other israeli prime ministers that were there secretly visiting epstein obviously running him so
[2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:51.120]  i was just pointing out there's different factions over there and i wanted to get your take on this
[2:16:51.120 --> 2:16:56.560]  particular faction because bill gates we know is in this faction and was using these networks
[2:16:56.560 --> 2:17:01.600]  uh and he was you know controlling epstein to a great extent to blackmail people and and get the
[2:17:01.600 --> 2:17:08.480]  scientific elites corrupted well you know it's not about ethnicity it's it really is a group of
[2:17:08.480 --> 2:17:12.560]  people who yeah but it's a group of people who believe they're descended from the nephaline
[2:17:12.560 --> 2:17:16.800]  bloodlines from the the fallen angels regardless whether or not there's any truth to this this
[2:17:16.800 --> 2:17:20.240]  is the network that's been built and you have all kinds of different now you're getting at it this
[2:17:20.240 --> 2:17:26.880]  is merovingian cult that they are the god creatures explain this and they some of them actually think
[2:17:26.880 --> 2:17:32.480]  that they are reincarnated egyptian gods you see all this egyptian symbology um if you look at what
[2:17:32.480 --> 2:17:38.560]  gz uh beyonce is now doing this new video black is king all of this is a cultism um it's tied to
[2:17:38.560 --> 2:17:44.400]  freemasonry it's tied to the illuminati um but it it all operates sort of uh together there are
[2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:50.320]  different uh covens uh there are different orders of this but they were by the way that's in all of the
[2:17:50.320 --> 2:17:55.840]  wiki leaks this is real stuff about oh we need to do a ritual an alice or cally ritual right now
[2:17:55.840 --> 2:18:01.840]  i'm sick i mean these people are really a joke yep and you see the black and white masonic
[2:18:01.840 --> 2:18:06.320]  tiles in every single music video this is real stuff now regardless of whether or not you believe
[2:18:06.320 --> 2:18:11.520]  in the supernatural aspect of lucifer himself and you know what um it would make a lot of sense if
[2:18:11.520 --> 2:18:16.000]  there was an archangel manipulating all of the minds of these people regardless they believe
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:20.240]  that they're serving him that's what the child sacrifice is about that's what all their symbology
[2:18:20.240 --> 2:18:24.560]  is about and it's all about subverting the bible they're not atheists if they were atheists they
[2:18:24.560 --> 2:18:30.000]  wouldn't care about the bible they spend their whole lives like madonna mocking the bible mocking
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:34.800]  christian it's all classic black magic rituals in closing you've been a journalist for a long time
[2:18:34.800 --> 2:18:38.320]  when in your research did you get to the bottom of the rabbit hole at being good versus evil
[2:18:38.320 --> 2:18:44.560]  well i probably started figuring this out about five years ago and you know what donald trump
[2:18:45.120 --> 2:18:50.880]  was instrumental in helping me get there i don't want to pretend like i'm really good friends with
[2:18:50.880 --> 2:18:56.160]  him but he as i said he was an informant against epstein he's somebody who knows what the power
[2:18:56.160 --> 2:18:59.840]  structure is and he wants to take this stuff down and there are a lot of good people who
[2:18:59.840 --> 2:19:04.240]  want to take this stuff down but ultimately it's up to citizen journalists truth tellers
[2:19:04.240 --> 2:19:08.800]  on the outside to use as much power as we can in order to get these people because there's
[2:19:08.800 --> 2:19:12.720]  still a ton of corruption inside the government that's right and it's good to see that trump's
[2:19:12.720 --> 2:19:16.640]  getting control of q again for a while it was taken away by the bad guys somebody i'll expose
[2:19:16.640 --> 2:19:21.760]  the whole thing in a good way patrick howley howley reporter on twitter great job amazing

[2:21:35.120 --> 2:21:40.480]  with that data rape your privacy tell the rapist clinton's go to hell and get your privacy pockets
[2:21:40.480 --> 2:21:50.720]  and info or store it's the end of the world as we know it it's the end of the world as we know it
[2:21:50.720 --> 2:22:00.480]  it's the end of the world as we know it and i feel fine it's the end of the world as we know it
[2:22:00.480 --> 2:22:08.000]  and i don't feel fine this entire takeover has been battle planned blueprinted war-gamed
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:14.320]  field marshaled by the psychological war chiefs at the united nations and the fortune 100 this is
[2:22:14.320 --> 2:22:21.680]  the post-human takeover the new skits tighter when you comply not looser the entire coven 19
[2:22:21.680 --> 2:22:26.640]  operation as a hoax now they admit the quote death numbers are dropping because those are fake
[2:22:26.640 --> 2:22:30.800]  where they count people that died of something else but it's all about how many cases there are
[2:22:30.800 --> 2:22:36.800]  and now they're saying most the population will get it and then no one can go outside ever again
[2:22:36.800 --> 2:22:52.720]  it's totally insane it's a fraud it's all a lie you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:07.520 --> 2:23:19.200]  well greg coppola is one of the biggest google whistleblowers so far to go public
[2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:23.920]  he committed horrible thought crime when he said that they were had a political bias he said the
[2:23:23.920 --> 2:23:30.000]  sky again was blue and the fish went in the ocean think different again dot art and revelations dot
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:35.440]  live and he's launched a new social network deep revelations is the first independent social network
[2:23:35.440 --> 2:23:41.360]  to use the advanced machine learning to compete on even technology terms with the big players
[2:23:42.240 --> 2:23:47.280]  so a lot of exciting things going on out there and there was supposedly today going to have the
[2:23:47.280 --> 2:23:55.680]  big tech leaders the guys that run our lives sundar pachai tim cook jeff bezos mark zuckerberg
[2:23:57.440 --> 2:24:02.720]  they were going to be meeting in dc and i told my crew i said yeah we're not going
[2:24:02.720 --> 2:24:06.160]  they're going to cancel it a couple times to throw off anybody trying to go cover it
[2:24:06.880 --> 2:24:14.000]  and then i said i bet one of them shows up but because they all coordinate but but i bet
[2:24:14.960 --> 2:24:19.040]  that it the others are all virtual because they hate it when i go up there and confront them and
[2:24:19.040 --> 2:24:22.400]  others do that's why they also want this whole virtual system so you're locked down and came
[2:24:22.400 --> 2:24:27.280]  and leave your house so they can be up on their mount you know mount olympus their elysium fields
[2:24:27.280 --> 2:24:31.920]  and we're just down to little slaves and they're all globalists they all help have chinese slave
[2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:38.480]  labor they all help the chinese death camps but the two worst ones are sundar pachai who's a puppet of
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:45.200]  the former head of alphabet schmitt and then of course you've got tim cook up there who's just
[2:24:45.200 --> 2:24:52.160]  an absolute monster but these individuals again have set up monopoly trust the working
[2:24:52.160 --> 2:24:56.400]  coordination and they're helping china run death camps so if you ever wonder what they'll do to you
[2:24:56.400 --> 2:25:02.640]  if they have their way anything these people are completely selfish completely out of control
[2:25:02.640 --> 2:25:07.360]  so greg joins us he is an experienced software engineer and founder of think different again
[2:25:07.360 --> 2:25:14.880]  a dramatic new startup the social media space greg has made headlines again in 2019 with a
[2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:19.200]  senior software engineer at google who had been placed on administrative leave for 24 hours
[2:25:19.200 --> 2:25:24.640]  after publicly suggesting the company is politically biased this is not even allowed to have speech
[2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:29.120]  greg coppola went on to expose google's dishonest methods and practices among them which are political
[2:25:29.120 --> 2:25:34.960]  bias boosting and de-boosting search results from civic websites perjury of google ceo sundar
[2:25:34.960 --> 2:25:40.960]  pachai to congress and other questionable company processes so he joins us now thanks for coming
[2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:48.400]  on what do you want to tackle first uh hey actually so uh basically um yeah i've been uh
[2:25:48.400 --> 2:25:52.400]  working on a startup for almost a year now so that's really what i'm focused on i guess it's
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:26:00.080]  the future and um well um yeah i thought very deeply about the problem i mean i think there's
[2:26:00.080 --> 2:26:05.040]  i think it's important to have an ensemble of approaches you know public and uh private i think
[2:26:05.040 --> 2:26:10.560]  we need a fair environment to compete similar to how say basketball teams are provided a fair
[2:26:10.560 --> 2:26:15.920]  environment to compete by the mba but they're not told how to play by the mba uh for example uh
[2:26:16.880 --> 2:26:21.520]  michael jordan is someone that joe rogan holds up as this you know real intense genius who uh
[2:26:21.520 --> 2:26:27.040]  uh who's able to transcend what was previously possible uh you know and and play basketball
[2:26:27.040 --> 2:26:30.720]  better than anyone really had and that comes from his own internal passion that can't be
[2:26:30.720 --> 2:26:34.400]  regulated but what they do need to do you know like in basketball is make sure nobody's showing
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:38.800]  up with a bat and just breaking kneecaps before the game that's destructive uh competitiveness
[2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:43.040]  rather than constructive competitiveness but i think you know so i've really been focusing on
[2:26:43.040 --> 2:26:46.320]  what can we do from the private sector what can we do from a technological perspective because
[2:26:46.320 --> 2:26:50.480]  that's the most thing that's under my control and i think there's a lot of optimism like i said i
[2:26:50.480 --> 2:26:56.320]  just launched my um my first uh social network it's kind of like uh an advanced version of reddit
[2:26:56.320 --> 2:27:00.880]  it's like reddit driven by deep learning there's no one really on it yet but it's uh you know it's
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:04.880]  all set up and ready to go this uh these these deep learning algorithms it's like once you start
[2:27:04.880 --> 2:27:09.600]  putting the data in there that's when they start to go it's field of dreams people come it'll be
[2:27:09.600 --> 2:27:13.840]  there it'll manifest people should do that i know i'm gonna try to get involved but pulling back
[2:27:13.840 --> 2:27:19.200]  since you were here with us last year obviously google now everybody knows this controlling
[2:27:19.200 --> 2:27:23.680]  things big tech is openly doing it twitter is openly doing it they're openly meddling in the
[2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:28.240]  election what do you think congress should do what do you think the president should do uh
[2:27:28.240 --> 2:27:31.760]  should they just sit back and let big tech become bigger and more powerful than the government
[2:27:31.760 --> 2:27:35.600]  and the country and then take over the planet and and merge with the chikoms
[2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:39.920]  well it certainly does take time to produce software that's one thing that has to be
[2:27:39.920 --> 2:27:44.560]  recognized it's a so-called minimum irreducible number of errors you can't um you can't speed
[2:27:44.560 --> 2:27:47.840]  things up beyond a certain point there's a certain amount of error that goes into tinkering so it
[2:27:47.840 --> 2:27:54.240]  does take time to stand up new services and you know uh you know for a near-term uh emergency
[2:27:54.240 --> 2:27:57.520]  measures i'm not sure you you know if there's a government will to do that maybe that would be
[2:27:57.520 --> 2:28:02.320]  necessary the one thing that was struck me i was recently reviewing um sundar pichai's testimony
[2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:06.640]  to congress and it did sort of strike me as though it's not clear when they ask him are you guys
[2:28:06.640 --> 2:28:11.360]  politically biased are they asking him to define what biases or does the government know what biases
[2:28:11.360 --> 2:28:16.560]  i mean i know how i would define bias in terms of like um uh the same conditions that would you
[2:28:16.560 --> 2:28:22.000]  would run a t-test for in uh in undergrad what you said is it's all lawyering and it's all subjective
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:26.720]  and it's all how they define things and that's how they tell these whopper of lies and and so we
[2:28:26.720 --> 2:28:31.200]  need to have real definitions yeah well normally that's you know when someone's on trial they're
[2:28:31.200 --> 2:28:34.640]  not being asked in the meaning of the words and whether or not they've done something they're
[2:28:34.640 --> 2:28:38.640]  just being asked whether or not they've done something according to uh fixed meetings of the
[2:28:38.640 --> 2:28:42.800]  words and maybe that's one of the things right now is there's not there's not clarity um on what
[2:28:42.800 --> 2:28:47.360]  bias is and if government is having a hard time defining statistical bias then that's one more
[2:28:47.360 --> 2:28:52.080]  argument of why they shouldn't be doing too much other than creating a level playing field because
[2:28:52.080 --> 2:28:55.840]  you know people are just thinking a lot faster in the private sector than well that's the big
[2:28:55.840 --> 2:29:01.360]  one is you've got the big banks behind all this blocking startups trying to take down gab trying
[2:29:01.360 --> 2:29:06.000]  to take us down giving us a hate rating when i have perfect credit so we lose merchant accounts
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:09.520]  i mean this is stuff like the nazis did to the jews taking their bank accounts away are they're
[2:29:09.520 --> 2:29:16.160]  right to you know have a have a shop or a storefront is that is that big tech and and twitter buying
[2:29:16.160 --> 2:29:21.280]  up all the digital currency and and all the uh you know online banking systems they're creating
[2:29:21.280 --> 2:29:26.560]  monopolies and with their cancel culture now in the third dimension even trying to stop people's
[2:29:26.560 --> 2:29:32.000]  speech i mean this is an authoritarian combine leveraging its power and you've got the aged
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:37.760]  lawyers who all are delusional up there on capitol hill uh who have no idea what they've
[2:29:37.760 --> 2:29:45.120]  just been hit by i mean the separation between monazuma and and the aztecs and the conquistadors
[2:29:45.120 --> 2:29:53.120]  was very close compared to this giant gulf of these old stupid lawyers that have no idea that ai's
[2:29:53.120 --> 2:29:59.440]  taken over the whole planet and and merged with with with the chai comms yeah i mean i think one
[2:29:59.440 --> 2:30:02.960]  of the most concrete things they could do positive actions would be to make sure we all have access
[2:30:02.960 --> 2:30:08.240]  to the same supply chains the same computational resources that we all know we're not losing
[2:30:08.240 --> 2:30:12.800]  our dot com we're not being banned off the app store we're not being having any of these things
[2:30:12.800 --> 2:30:17.840]  removed i think we can't get into the game of you know like if they take our electricity away
[2:30:17.840 --> 2:30:21.760]  then we have to build the electricity company and then when it comes down to banks you know banking
[2:30:21.760 --> 2:30:24.960]  is regulated in and of itself like we weren't allowed to start crypto banks because that's
[2:30:24.960 --> 2:30:29.200]  regulated so then for people to get kicked off of banking systems you know that shouldn't be allowed
[2:30:29.200 --> 2:30:34.000]  i think but gab is a great example um because you know it's like gab has an information retrieval
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:37.920]  product google has an information retrieval product but google also has the app store
[2:30:37.920 --> 2:30:42.560]  and then one day google told gab well you're not allowed to be on the app store and at that time
[2:30:42.560 --> 2:30:46.880]  the app store was required for being considered professional um you know and i think at that
[2:30:46.880 --> 2:30:51.520]  time gab was not the most advanced software but same thing with you know when larry page started
[2:30:51.520 --> 2:30:55.840]  like he didn't write the best software himself he just proved the concept and then he had some
[2:30:55.840 --> 2:31:00.400]  of these classic all-star engineers join the team well that's it look big tech doesn't just buy up
[2:31:00.400 --> 2:31:05.520]  thousands of competitive companies they shut them down and block them off of their monopolies which
[2:31:05.520 --> 2:31:13.040]  is un-american dangerous and criminal yeah and um also with respect to gab like i'm also
[2:31:13.040 --> 2:31:18.960]  releasing the um open the the the source code of my um a social network and my main thing is i
[2:31:18.960 --> 2:31:23.440]  want to teach based on this social network i recently took ryan rose's uh business accelerator
[2:31:23.440 --> 2:31:29.120]  class and i saw people selling all these different kind of um digital products and kevin oliri says
[2:31:29.120 --> 2:31:34.160]  he also sees this digital america emerging i think this is the beginning of web 3.0 if we
[2:31:34.160 --> 2:31:39.360]  can push it through and it's going to be more my vision is more horizontal integration smaller
[2:31:39.360 --> 2:31:44.960]  companies with um less hierarchical depth competing and and and cooperating within an
[2:31:44.960 --> 2:31:51.840]  ecosystem of platforms that are um more fair and more distributed um instead of vertical integration
[2:31:51.840 --> 2:31:57.440]  horizontal integration which will create real diversity and web 3.0 so you believe their attempted
[2:31:57.440 --> 2:32:02.800]  censorship is going to force the new renaissance well i think there are three technological
[2:32:02.800 --> 2:32:07.600]  disruptive forces that are pushing things towards smaller companies and maybe this is one reason why
[2:32:07.600 --> 2:32:10.720]  there's so much anti-competitive maybe they acknowledge maybe they're they see the writing
[2:32:10.720 --> 2:32:15.680]  on the wall that like when uh you know the mainframe hold on you're on this is so key what
[2:32:15.680 --> 2:32:21.280]  you're saying exactly their old order their old system is coming down and all of this is an attempt
[2:32:21.280 --> 2:32:28.000]  to scare us and put us back into a dark age but nothing brings in the renaissance lack an attempt
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:32.800]  to suppress it so we're on the verge of some really incredible things if people take action i agree
[2:32:32.800 --> 2:32:47.200]  with greg coppola think different again dot art stay with us
[2:32:47.200 --> 2:32:51.760]  where the hell did this water come from
[2:32:53.280 --> 2:32:56.640]  where did it come from where did it come from where did it come from where did it come from
[2:32:58.640 --> 2:33:06.320]  info or store dot com we can't survive without pure clean drinking water so make sure that it's

[2:33:36.560 --> 2:33:46.720]  other systems just don't compare cnn usa today and other mainstream media fake news outlets came
[2:33:46.720 --> 2:33:53.280]  out and said that the new trump campaign t-shirt that has an american eagle spreading its wings
[2:33:53.280 --> 2:34:00.080]  standing on top of an american flag is nazi and they had the soros funded snopes groups and others
[2:34:00.080 --> 2:34:05.680]  fact check it to say yes now the american flag and yes the american eagle are nazis no torches
[2:34:05.680 --> 2:34:12.320]  soros and funds and snopes and media matters the rest of them these the real nazi elaborator but
[2:34:12.320 --> 2:34:16.480]  this shirt i think is really the perfect campaign shirts we make one even better than what trump
[2:34:16.480 --> 2:34:21.840]  people came up with two different versions of it with something even worse the vetsy ross flag
[2:34:21.840 --> 2:34:27.200]  our first flag that they also say is racist even though she was a famous abolitionist so these
[2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:33.040]  shirts are at info wars dot com they're the american eagle vetsy ross flags two different designs
[2:34:33.040 --> 2:34:37.360]  guaranteed to spread the word and of course trigger lift hearts everywhere exercise your first
[2:34:37.360 --> 2:34:44.640]  amendment or loosen info war store dot com a lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years
[2:34:44.640 --> 2:34:50.480]  and if you go back to those shows we laid out the ai takeover plan the tracking of cell phones
[2:34:51.120 --> 2:34:57.120]  how programmed master computers would manipulate control society how they'd be able to not just
[2:34:57.120 --> 2:35:02.320]  predict large groups of human movements and activities but even predict what individuals
[2:35:02.320 --> 2:35:06.560]  would do and then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing you could add
[2:35:06.560 --> 2:35:12.480]  stimuli through the ai systems through the computers through digital billboards through
[2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:17.440]  face scanning through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you wanted
[2:35:17.440 --> 2:35:22.880]  to but when we cover that the media would attack us and say we were making it up it was a conspiracy
[2:35:22.880 --> 2:35:28.240]  theory even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents well the next level of
[2:35:28.240 --> 2:35:33.200]  the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans
[2:35:33.200 --> 2:35:38.960]  obsolete and phase us out and it's something about a thousand times crazier than what hitler planned
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:44.960]  so we might want to dismantle the system now historical food is again available for shipping
[2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:49.440]  within three to four weeks we have it it's high quality but it's got to be packaged and shipped
[2:35:49.440 --> 2:35:53.840]  out to you some items are shipping in a week some in four weeks so they're saying three to four
[2:35:53.840 --> 2:35:59.200]  weeks it's my patriot we have their full catalog they're in our back end at info wars store.com

[2:36:06.640 --> 2:36:12.000]  tells me that really really serious times are ahead whether trump wins or loses the globalists
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:16.480]  have already created a world by depression lockdowns on the planetary scale and it's only
[2:36:16.480 --> 2:36:21.360]  intensifying this is one of the big boxes you've got to get checked off it's high quality storeable

[2:36:37.440 --> 2:36:40.960]  fights the globalist toe-to-toe get your storeable food now infowarstore.com
[2:36:40.960 --> 2:36:50.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:00.320]  when i grow up i want to see humanity go interplanetary interdimensional
[2:37:00.320 --> 2:37:07.600]  i want to see us build a pro-human universe but we're gonna have to fight for it we now take
[2:37:07.600 --> 2:37:14.480]  you live to the front lines of the information war with greg gokula of think different again
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:19.680]  dot art and revelations dot lives i'm gonna serve the liner it's pretty good right here
[2:37:21.360 --> 2:37:27.760]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance
[2:37:27.760 --> 2:37:33.600]  you're listening to alex jones
[2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:40.560]  all right greg really exciting that you've launched revelations dot live and we're excited
[2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:45.040]  you're here talking about it want you to get some into that but get back into this not vertical
[2:37:45.040 --> 2:37:50.640]  integration but horizontal integration and the chance if people start supporting other platforms
[2:37:50.640 --> 2:37:55.920]  to really take the power away from big tech just like our ancestors you know left countries that
[2:37:55.920 --> 2:38:00.480]  weren't as free or places that weren't as free to try to build something that was freer doesn't
[2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:05.040]  mean we didn't bring the problems with us didn't mean that we created utopia but it did create
[2:38:05.040 --> 2:38:08.960]  something better and and so that process is happening now let's talk about it
[2:38:11.600 --> 2:38:18.400]  well i've been like a studying a variety of different topics and i think you know one interesting
[2:38:18.400 --> 2:38:24.640]  thing is that the amazon assistant has a lot more market share than the google assistant and it's
[2:38:24.640 --> 2:38:28.560]  interesting because amazon even tried to do less of a vertically integrated product than google
[2:38:28.560 --> 2:38:33.120]  which is to say that they tried to have more of a platform that farms out the work to other people
[2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:39.120]  than google's i think approach was more like we're very smart we have a lot of expertise in house
[2:38:39.120 --> 2:38:45.680]  let's try to do most of the stuff in house and i would say that amazon has worked better and i think
[2:38:47.200 --> 2:38:53.200]  internally the reasons for this are they've actually been known since really the 1970s i think
[2:38:53.200 --> 2:38:57.360]  there was a book called the mythical man month which is called the bible of software engineering
[2:38:57.360 --> 2:39:02.400]  and it was written in 1975 by frederick brooks and i've been reviewing brooks books back till
[2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:06.960]  then to kind of understand what's going on and it starts with the assumption that i've noticed
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:12.160]  that google assistant language understanding isn't really any better in 2020 than it was in 2012 so
[2:39:12.160 --> 2:39:17.520]  i would contend there's been eight years of stagnation there and as i reflected on the experience
[2:39:17.520 --> 2:39:23.360]  i started to look back in in history for what might be known about software teams and we find that
[2:39:23.360 --> 2:39:28.400]  that like software teams have a difficulty in growing because of the communication costs are so
[2:39:28.400 --> 2:39:33.680]  high it costs a lot to onboard somebody and then it costs a lot to keep them in the loop so the
[2:39:33.680 --> 2:39:38.480]  original way this manifested was that they noticed that when you add new engineers to a late project
[2:39:38.480 --> 2:39:43.200]  it would usually just make it later and and that's because you it costs so much communication to
[2:39:43.200 --> 2:39:47.120]  bring them on board if they can't contribute you've actually just you've lost rather than gain by
[2:39:47.120 --> 2:39:51.840]  having more people and you know a corollary for this is that companies can really only grow to a
[2:39:51.840 --> 2:39:57.520]  certain size before like there's just too much time wasted on communication and this is something
[2:39:57.520 --> 2:40:03.840]  steve jobs really understood he's an engineering hero of mine i mean i obviously we all have many
[2:40:03.840 --> 2:40:09.360]  sides to us but he's an engineering hero of mine for sure and he would always cite this this book
[2:40:09.360 --> 2:40:14.000]  called the mythical man month now i'm i have this like quip in my mind that maybe google threw out
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:19.680]  all their copies because it had the word man in it and then they forgot the lessons yeah that's the
[2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:24.880]  whole attack on humanity itself but please continue well it is interesting to think though once upon
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:28.240]  a time they had the word manpower because if you really let's say you were like had lumberjacks
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:32.960]  chopping down the forest like that was the lumberjacks really were the the manpower whereas now
[2:40:32.960 --> 2:40:37.440]  the engineers are programming the computers so it's almost like even yeah there it is that
[2:40:37.440 --> 2:40:42.480]  you know even an entry level even a child who's just learned to use a computer is almost like a
[2:40:42.480 --> 2:40:48.880]  manager of people chopping wood or like if you think about a construction site you know no one
[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:52.480]  ever walks off the ground floor of a construction site and then starts their own construction
[2:40:52.480 --> 2:40:56.560]  site but tech is very different so there's a number of reasons for that but tech really does
[2:40:56.560 --> 2:41:01.760]  favor i think i wouldn't say single people in their garage but there's you know even in 1975
[2:41:01.760 --> 2:41:05.280]  they were already asking well if all the if all the new products really starting garages
[2:41:06.080 --> 2:41:10.320]  like hula packard did 1939 that was the first garage that started the whole thing and you
[2:41:10.320 --> 2:41:15.760]  really hit on something here they want ai to take over because these big centralized things like yahu
[2:41:15.760 --> 2:41:21.280]  or others start declining so they keep imagining some mythic ai that they program that will consolidate
[2:41:21.280 --> 2:41:26.160]  and run it all for them but then it goes back to social control wanting us to behave a certain way
[2:41:26.160 --> 2:41:32.080]  so the ai can control us so it's really kind of an oxymoron yeah i don't think there's been much
[2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:35.840]  technological advancement in the last decade and this is something peter teal who's one of my favorite
[2:41:36.720 --> 2:41:44.000]  software philosophers he brings up he distinguishes two axes of development what he calls technology
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:49.280]  on the on the vertical axis and he says globalization on the x-axis technology means that you learn to
[2:41:49.280 --> 2:41:52.320]  do something that you've never been able to do before and globalization means you just take
[2:41:52.320 --> 2:41:55.120]  that and you port it somewhere else so like the first time the television was invented that's
[2:41:55.120 --> 2:41:59.760]  technology the first time it was made in japan that's globalization i would generalize that to say
[2:41:59.760 --> 2:42:04.320]  there's two axes in general there's technology and then there's kind of like business operations
[2:42:04.320 --> 2:42:08.000]  and i think what we've seen mostly for the past decade is is business operations based on the
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:12.320]  technology that was in the in the decade before that sure and i don't think we want global adoption
[2:42:12.320 --> 2:42:17.440]  of centralized ai systems that's the goal that will kill innovation from the beginning i mean
[2:42:17.440 --> 2:42:21.040]  it's one thing if people want to adopt something and adopt something better later but this global
[2:42:21.040 --> 2:42:27.680]  system wants to make global adoption forced and then make it basically be a separated uh
[2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:34.720]  civilization i mean yeah i don't know what to say about that but i do think that there's a
[2:42:34.720 --> 2:42:38.720]  certain level at which vertical vertical integration does doesn't work because like imagine
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:41.840]  like what most people would say about the google assistant is that they have very good speech
[2:42:41.840 --> 2:42:45.520]  recognition but they don't have very good language understanding and so there's no way like for the
[2:42:45.520 --> 2:42:50.000]  speech recognition to sort of be reused if you know if you if you have 10 different projects
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:53.440]  and one is failing that could lead to the failure of all of them sure what i'm talking about is with
[2:42:53.440 --> 2:42:59.600]  a global social score forced adoption of certain systems over others fundamentally the modern
[2:42:59.600 --> 2:43:05.920]  globalist system actually doesn't want to have classical globalization or adoption because
[2:43:05.920 --> 2:43:10.640]  something works in a superior they want to force tyranny through the very architecture of it is
[2:43:10.640 --> 2:43:18.160]  what i'm saying well i i think i see it as yeah i mean um just i i see it mostly manifesting as
[2:43:18.160 --> 2:43:21.360]  just attacks on the supply chain including the rule of law i mean that's part of the supply
[2:43:21.360 --> 2:43:26.560]  chain normally of starting a new business or you know being able to go to like a city like la or
[2:43:26.560 --> 2:43:32.320]  new york or san francisco you know i mean um it's you know and travel around safely you know just
[2:43:32.320 --> 2:43:36.800]  we have so much of the normal supply chain is not is not there if we had the full supply chain we
[2:43:36.800 --> 2:43:42.320]  could easily start that's what i'm saying is and big tech the way it's set up is dissolving the regular
[2:43:42.320 --> 2:43:47.200]  supply chains and consolidating power and if we don't we have everybody working from home then
[2:43:47.200 --> 2:43:51.040]  that's not going to build the infrastructure anymore complex infrastructures build complex
[2:43:51.040 --> 2:43:56.000]  infrastructures you quote simplify infrastructures and say you're trying to cut the carbon of a
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:44:00.560]  carbon-based planet you're actually destroying the infrastructure creating a new dark age which
[2:44:00.560 --> 2:44:05.600]  is a club of our own plan so i'm projecting the political desires of the establishment rulers
[2:44:05.600 --> 2:44:10.480]  onto what you mathematically are looking at as an equation and i'm saying the two things are different
[2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:14.400]  does that make sense yeah i i don't know yeah i mean i'm not really here to describe motivations
[2:44:14.400 --> 2:44:18.080]  but i do think that there's a limit to how much vertical integration can work i mean otherwise
[2:44:18.080 --> 2:44:22.560]  like you know like in in 2012 you know on the google assistant you could set an alarm and today
[2:44:22.560 --> 2:44:26.640]  you can set an alarm and that's you know not what's happened in the meantime like in eight years you
[2:44:26.640 --> 2:44:30.480]  know and like how long are we going to go without any the real innovation is social control with the
[2:44:30.480 --> 2:44:35.200]  tracking that i mean everything all the real innovation is we've got the trojan horse but the
[2:44:35.200 --> 2:44:40.160]  soldiers they're loading into it to enslave us are getting more powerful well but that's not even
[2:44:40.160 --> 2:44:44.320]  really new technology that's old technology just used in another way so that's gone but i'm saying
[2:44:44.320 --> 2:44:50.800]  they're they're rolling out the predatory angles of it now we're accepting the the the the the bad
[2:44:50.800 --> 2:44:58.240]  oppressive classical tyrannies that these things delivered us yeah i don't know it's one there's
[2:44:58.240 --> 2:45:03.600]  been uh there's uh very little interest in like uh freedom i mean i'm in canada you know there's
[2:45:03.600 --> 2:45:06.880]  been a big change in the culture from when i was young when we were sort of in charge to you like
[2:45:06.880 --> 2:45:10.560]  now it's more like the government's in charge there's just a different culture of like a
[2:45:10.560 --> 2:45:14.160]  technocracy that's what i'm talking about so how do you deal with the technocracy that doesn't
[2:45:14.160 --> 2:45:18.160]  want innovation that doesn't want freedom that wants stagnation and wants a public taught to
[2:45:18.160 --> 2:45:24.000]  just go play video games i think yeah we are at a decision point i mean if we we could choose stagnation
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:27.920]  it might not you know like people have forgotten the classic lessons that of software engineering
[2:45:27.920 --> 2:45:33.200]  i think in my in my generation and like if they're not remembered you know it's how uh i'm not even
[2:45:33.200 --> 2:45:40.000]  sure who's gonna build i'm not sure really what the end game is like my my thesis is like okay so
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:44.400]  mark zuckerberg made facebook at like 18 or whatever shouldn't we have many 18 year olds who are ready
[2:45:44.400 --> 2:45:48.800]  to just bursting out and making their own companies even just trying i mean they must be at home right
[2:45:48.800 --> 2:45:53.760]  or they must be in the dorm room like what's really stopping them unless there's just something like
[2:45:53.760 --> 2:45:58.720]  you know we're lowering our low our capabilities just overall at the at the adult level and at
[2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:02.000]  the child level and that's why we you know where the 18 year olds that are making their own products
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  like well that's it you're using technology to build things they're using it to beat themselves
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:10.240]  over the head where we do all these micro decisions all day that don't matter and and the
[2:46:10.240 --> 2:46:15.920]  technology is designed as shan parker said to exploit our weaknesses and take over our lives
[2:46:15.920 --> 2:46:21.840]  and make us miserable yeah we should really you know i mean i i often say we we don't want to
[2:46:21.840 --> 2:46:25.600]  stagnate and people might be thinking like well i mean everything's moving so fast right now i kind
[2:46:25.600 --> 2:46:30.080]  of want to break but stagnation doesn't mean like that you're hanging out at the lake stagnation
[2:46:30.080 --> 2:46:36.240]  can manifest itself is just a lot of churn and um and for kids i mean like we grew up in a i'm
[2:46:36.240 --> 2:46:39.520]  more or less the same age as mark zuckerberg and we grew up in a great age because we had like
[2:46:40.400 --> 2:46:44.720]  you know in the 90s let's say like i was on dos computers they were very simple i could understand
[2:46:44.720 --> 2:46:48.560]  what the program was doing um i could write those programs myself i used to do you have the old
[2:46:48.560 --> 2:46:54.000]  world and the new world but you got to see behind the curtain yeah it's it's very it's very interesting
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:58.800]  and i think like with the kids today like their phones can do so much and then the the control
[2:46:58.800 --> 2:47:02.720]  like interface they have on their phone is so weak that there's like it must seem like just
[2:47:02.720 --> 2:47:08.960]  complete magic what's happening and you know maybe we're not going to get uh engineers like um
[2:47:08.960 --> 2:47:13.520]  exactly they're accepting it just as something that's there like a lake they're going to go swimming
[2:47:13.520 --> 2:47:17.280]  in they're not thinking about what goes into the lake and and and and so they're becoming
[2:47:17.280 --> 2:47:23.360]  cogs of the machine itself not users of the machine let's talk about uh the launch of this new
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:27.760]  social network revelations dot live and i've got big breaking news stay with us
[2:47:30.800 --> 2:47:36.640]  americans have had freedom for so long and most americans were born into such
[2:47:36.640 --> 2:47:41.600]  docile times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny
[2:47:41.600 --> 2:47:46.880]  we don't appreciate the american way truth justice due process the right to self defense
[2:47:46.880 --> 2:47:51.200]  private property because we've had it so long we just think that's how the rest of the world is
[2:47:51.200 --> 2:47:56.640]  ladies and gentlemen the renaissance the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build
[2:47:56.640 --> 2:48:01.760]  up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong
[2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:06.640]  is something the west invented and that's what made our modern world that's now been hijacked
[2:48:06.640 --> 2:48:11.120]  by the technocrats by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we
[2:48:11.120 --> 2:48:17.200]  need to be cold and dumb down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate manipulate
[2:48:17.200 --> 2:48:22.640]  and command you're even lucky enough to stay alive and that's what covet 19 is a global
[2:48:22.640 --> 2:48:28.640]  un revolution against free humanity against your family against prosperity and against your future
[2:48:28.640 --> 2:48:34.640]  if you don't stand up and fight you deserve what you get we close and lock our doors and windows
[2:48:34.640 --> 2:48:39.600]  at night not because we're doing anything wrong but because it's about privacy and it's about
[2:48:39.600 --> 2:48:45.040]  security and it's something that we do to protect ourselves going back thousands of years when we
[2:48:45.040 --> 2:48:49.200]  would post a dog or a century at the entrance of the village so we would know if predators
[2:48:49.200 --> 2:48:53.920]  or criminals were coming well big tech along with the federal government and other global
[2:48:53.920 --> 2:48:58.640]  historic organizations have been tracking everybody illegally for years with their cell phones but
[2:48:58.640 --> 2:49:03.360]  now the public is finally waking up because the enemy has openly announced it's the fact
[2:49:03.360 --> 2:49:07.840]  and the clinton foundation global initiative with chelsea is running the private system
[2:49:07.840 --> 2:49:12.000]  to spy on you and your family that's right the democrats the globalists the chai comms
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:17.200]  they've all got our number they're tracking us in lifetime but with privacy pockets the best system

[2:49:53.440 --> 2:50:00.320]  back with think different again dot art and revelations got live and how do people get involved
[2:50:00.320 --> 2:50:05.120]  how does it work looks pretty exciting how do i get signed up at revelations dot live
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:11.840]  well it looks to be yeah the website website seems to be standing up and if you go to revelations
[2:50:11.840 --> 2:50:19.920]  out live you can put your email in there and then i will i will be inviting people to join
[2:50:19.920 --> 2:50:23.040]  the first version of the network and then we'll get a few people in there and then eventually
[2:50:23.040 --> 2:50:26.720]  i'll let other people invite so you're in beta right now and you're kind of launching it right now
[2:50:26.720 --> 2:50:33.520]  yeah exactly basically we kind of just uh just starting up and um so there's a few there's there's
[2:50:33.520 --> 2:50:36.400]  there's a bunch of things on this website so first of all there's the website itself it's
[2:50:36.400 --> 2:50:39.920]  going to be great it's going to be like an advanced version of reddit it's not going to suffer from
[2:50:39.920 --> 2:50:43.840]  the brigading problem we can get into that another time but you're not going to take 300 million from
[2:50:43.840 --> 2:50:48.720]  the chinese government that's right and it's also it's going to be managed like in in the west
[2:50:49.360 --> 2:50:53.920]  rather than in china and um but it's it's going to be like they just like reddit is just adding
[2:50:53.920 --> 2:50:57.200]  ones and zeros i mean and ones and minus when you know that's like antiquated stuff this is going to
[2:50:57.200 --> 2:51:00.880]  be blowed away it's using neural nets we're going to have a we're going to represent you as a number
[2:51:00.880 --> 2:51:04.720]  in a multi-dimensional space um if you don't know about neural nets then this is going to be a good
[2:51:04.720 --> 2:51:08.080]  way for you to learn about them and then on top of that what i'm doing is i'm giving away the code
[2:51:08.080 --> 2:51:13.200]  and i want to sell courses on on the back of that there's this whole zoomification uh online
[2:51:13.200 --> 2:51:18.000] ification going on of education a lot of people are saying they want more capacity even eric schmidt
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:22.720]  is very building a parallel university to stanford and mit i think a lot of people see that if you
[2:51:22.720 --> 2:51:25.920]  go through all the way up to high school and then you go through undergrad if you're on an
[2:51:25.920 --> 2:51:28.960]  antiquated program you know then you're still going to have to learn machine learning at
[2:51:28.960 --> 2:51:32.080]  the end it's not to do another program at the end of that to learn the modern technologies
[2:51:32.080 --> 2:51:36.080]  i think we can just start with kids teaching them like straight in the line like look how to maintain
[2:51:36.080 --> 2:51:40.480]  this social network and then you'll learn you'll learn about databases you'll learn about networks
[2:51:40.480 --> 2:51:43.760]  you'll learn about user interface at the final point you'll learn about deep learning and that's
[2:51:43.760 --> 2:51:48.480]  the modern stack and social i mean uh software engineering i'm excited for you to look there
[2:51:48.480 --> 2:51:53.040]  software engineering really has changed so much and i've just spent the past year really modernizing
[2:51:53.040 --> 2:51:59.120]  my skills so my profit uh my model is really i want to teach people so you can use this network
[2:51:59.120 --> 2:52:04.240]  is going to be cool you can download the network you can try you could uh so you know there's there's
[2:52:04.240 --> 2:52:08.320]  all these different um related enterprises that are going on but to start with go to revelations
[2:52:08.320 --> 2:52:13.360]  all live and put your email in and uh it asks for your name and some interest just so that uh
[2:52:13.360 --> 2:52:18.800]  we could tell the bots from the non-bots and then um and then you know we'll get those emails like
[2:52:18.800 --> 2:52:24.160]  from there we can go with the email list uh even email incidentally can be blocked you know email
[2:52:24.160 --> 2:52:28.560]  is another is another point of failure because of the spam detection but if we create an email
[2:52:28.560 --> 2:52:33.360]  list um we should be able to uh we should be able to go from there all right well i'm going to try
[2:52:33.360 --> 2:52:37.200]  to get my guys to sign up with you maybe you can help us along and i guess we'd like to be one of
[2:52:37.200 --> 2:52:41.040]  the first you know groups when you actually launch the platform because we really need to
[2:52:41.040 --> 2:52:46.960]  to understand that it's been social engineering so many people two years ago and we got totally banned
[2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:49.760]  said hey we really like you but we're not going to have you on our interview you we don't want to
[2:52:49.760 --> 2:52:53.280]  get banned next and i'd say you'll be banned within six months they called did you talk to an insider
[2:52:53.280 --> 2:52:57.440]  i said no they want to get you too and they're going to get everybody so they do it incrementally
[2:52:57.440 --> 2:53:02.480]  so that the crowd of sheet still don't stand up and so at the time they get them the next
[2:53:02.480 --> 2:53:06.720]  group doesn't stand up the next group and so first it's the nationalists and the conservatives and
[2:53:06.720 --> 2:53:11.680]  the christians then the patriots then the populace and then the you know the classical liberals and
[2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:18.880]  now and it's just a total takeover and people need to stand up against it in general and stop living
[2:53:18.880 --> 2:53:27.760]  on their knees yeah i mean um like you know i sort of spoke last year because i did kind of feel
[2:53:27.760 --> 2:53:31.760]  like if i waited till this year it would just be lost in the noise which is true and then the
[2:53:31.760 --> 2:53:35.600]  good side effect from that which seemed like a principle to stand at the time was like i found
[2:53:35.600 --> 2:53:39.840]  a new way of life now otherwise i would have still been in midtown Manhattan dealing with um
[2:53:39.840 --> 2:53:44.000]  the crime there and you know i would have trapped in my small apartment and now i've
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:48.960]  got to say i mean you looked really nervous and unhappy and unhealthy when you were on this last
[2:53:48.960 --> 2:53:52.880]  year i'm like is this a new guy you look like you know you're look healthy you look happy you look
[2:53:52.880 --> 2:53:58.400]  like a new person yeah i'm a lot happier i was really depressed um well that's why i had to shake
[2:53:58.400 --> 2:54:03.040]  things up um last year but i'm yeah i'm much happier i'm like living in on the west coast of
[2:54:03.040 --> 2:54:07.920]  canada now that's the crazy thing every time i make the right decision against the enemy my life
[2:54:07.920 --> 2:54:12.560]  just gets better too but people that serve it are just so committed to it they get more and more
[2:54:12.560 --> 2:54:17.440]  unhappy they want to pull us down it's not going to happen i'm very excited about revelations.live

[2:56:09.760 --> 2:56:14.400]  never forget that and never forget what the ancient greeks said and i think sapata
[2:56:15.040 --> 2:56:17.040]  put in a quick quote that's true
[2:56:20.960 --> 2:56:24.000]  it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees as a slave
[2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:33.120]  because the coward does really die a thousand deaths but those that aren't cowards only taste
[2:56:33.120 --> 2:56:41.520]  of death once all right my friends here is the good news the bad news the crazy news this is from
[2:56:41.520 --> 2:56:47.760]  gates.house.gov they're having the hearings congressman matt gates files criminal referral
[2:56:47.760 --> 2:56:58.000]  against facebook ceo mark zuckerberg to the justice department and he goes on to say that zuckerberg
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:02.480]  testified that they do not blacklist anybody they do not penalize conservatives despite they've
[2:57:02.480 --> 2:57:08.720]  got all the undercover footage project veritas got and then you have the leaked emails where they
[2:57:08.720 --> 2:57:14.080]  were banning me and where they talk about how to set me up and how they're going after conservatives
[2:57:14.080 --> 2:57:18.800]  and pro-trump people i mean they lied to congress roger stone got charged with that convicted of
[2:57:18.800 --> 2:57:25.120]  that and he didn't even do that he said no i'm not spoken to julien assange later he's like yes
[2:57:25.120 --> 2:57:28.960]  i've got intermediaries the hillary dump will be big he had a guy talking to them they're going
[2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:32.960]  yeah it's about hillary assange had already said that you could watch hanity and know that when
[2:57:32.960 --> 2:57:40.000]  assange was on with him the only thing roger's guilty of is hype and boy were we hyping up
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:44.080]  those wiki leaks and they were dynamite weren't they i had no idea it'd be devil worship and
[2:57:44.080 --> 2:57:50.400]  pedophilia in there i knew they were into that but you know but you need to go read it it's going
[2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:58.080]  up at info wars dot com right now we'll also post it at news wars dot com but he lays it all out
[2:57:58.080 --> 2:58:03.280]  and how they lied and what they did and here's the letter to the attorney general
[2:58:06.080 --> 2:58:09.520]  and i've already sent letters to the president i've had law firms write up how they're lying
[2:58:09.520 --> 2:58:15.040]  to congress how they're all doing it i've done it again and again i don't do that because i'm the
[2:58:15.040 --> 2:58:19.760]  smartest eyeballing answers i'm not gonna sit here while these globalists take over and run
[2:58:19.760 --> 2:58:23.840]  death camps in china and set those up for us and and watch them lie to everybody i went and
[2:58:23.840 --> 2:58:28.480]  confronted sundar and i went and confronted uh jack dorsi who then banned me off twitter that same
[2:58:28.480 --> 2:58:33.600]  day and i went and confronted them over and over again because i'm going to do it and it's not because
[2:58:33.600 --> 2:58:40.400]  i'm a hero i they're enslaving me they are metaphysically pissing on me punching me stabbing
[2:58:40.400 --> 2:58:46.240]  me and you and i will not lay down and i will not take it and the bill gates comes out with his
[2:58:46.240 --> 2:58:52.800]  vaccines and they start pressure people to take them people die from it there comes a point that
[2:58:52.800 --> 2:58:55.760]  we have to start discussing what we're going to do when we're being physically attacked
[2:58:57.120 --> 2:59:00.160]  and i say that because that's what you're supposed to do when you're a man
[2:59:00.160 --> 2:59:04.800]  they're already launched violence against us everywhere they're already shooting people every
[2:59:04.800 --> 2:59:10.320]  day at random communist checkpoints and the media is calling it wonderful well i don't want to go
[2:59:10.320 --> 2:59:14.800]  kill stupid method communists in the street you always call antifa method you look at the guy
[2:59:14.800 --> 2:59:19.200]  that got killed in awesomeness eyes were total pupils i've been around them that's who they are
[2:59:20.560 --> 2:59:23.200]  they're usually about 22 a method into devil worship
[2:59:23.200 --> 2:59:32.080]  some and i don't i mean dog feces is lower than these people i don't want to kill them i don't
[2:59:32.080 --> 2:59:38.720]  want a physical war that's why i tell everybody they kick off a real war and start killing our
[2:59:38.720 --> 2:59:44.800]  leaders and the FBI sits there while they burn down courthouses and all this stuff don't go
[2:59:44.800 --> 2:59:52.480]  during a civil war downtown and fight komish remember who the generals are and i don't mean
[2:59:52.480 --> 2:59:58.960]  military generals i mean remember who captains these operations because when they make their move
[2:59:58.960 --> 3:00:04.080]  this is just the cover to make it look grass roots there they are shooting their high powered lasers
[3:00:04.080 --> 3:00:07.840]  you can buy a laser for like 200 bucks it'll burn somebody's eye i bought a few of these just to test
[3:00:07.840 --> 3:00:11.600]  them years ago i didn't believe it we bought a hundred dollar laser you can shoot at a matchstick
[3:00:11.600 --> 3:00:17.120]  and it ignites in like two seconds we've got blue and green lasers and there they are just shooting
[3:00:17.120 --> 3:00:21.840]  them in the face for for 30 minutes or so and of course these guys are blind now they open their eyes
[3:00:21.840 --> 3:00:26.400]  up everything's blurred because it burned out the rods and the cones in their eye but oh they're
[3:00:26.400 --> 3:00:32.240]  peaceful so all i'm saying is i'm not going to sit here and take crap like this you know that woman
[3:00:32.240 --> 3:00:37.840]  attacked that family with their children at a picnic table for pulling their mask off in san
[3:00:37.840 --> 3:00:44.160]  diego and i'm sorry i body slam that lady i don't care i'm not putting up with being assaulted
[3:00:44.160 --> 3:00:52.240]  it's disgusting as people are out of control and they're activating all their liberal death
[3:00:52.240 --> 3:00:57.520]  lovers to come out and attack us now here's the big whopper ladies and gentlemen
[3:00:59.840 --> 3:01:06.560]  try care wrongly tells more than 600 000 military members they had coronavirus and i read through
[3:01:06.560 --> 3:01:10.960]  this it's linking back to a database they're claiming it's a glitch no this is how they're
[3:01:10.960 --> 3:01:16.000]  putting record numbers and spiking it's all fraud they admit it's all fraud they told 600
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:21.200]  000 people in the military that they had it and that's how they announced last week a doubling
[3:01:21.200 --> 3:01:26.080]  in the military and a total pandemic and all this crap it's all fake statistics that story
[3:01:27.440 --> 3:01:32.400]  is up on info wars dot com you know you talk about disgusting video police raid new jersey gym
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:38.400]  arrest owners for violating governor murphy's shutdown order so walmart can be open
[3:01:38.400 --> 3:01:44.400]  and antifa can riot black lives matter can attack people but you can't open your little gym you've
[3:01:44.400 --> 3:01:49.520]  got to go bankrupt even though you can't get the stimulus money and here come the goon police
[3:01:49.520 --> 3:01:54.640]  that'll they'll roll over and piss themselves to antifa but they can sure arrest a gym owner
[3:01:54.640 --> 3:02:00.640]  disgusting and there's the gym owner wearing a stupid mask i mean this is all tyranny these
[3:02:00.640 --> 3:02:10.480]  are shameful police and that governor is a shameful sack of garbage go ahead and roll the video atlas

[3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:45.280]  disgusting meanwhile on info wars dot com walmart home depot and others reverse policy
[3:02:46.480 --> 3:02:52.640]  will allow unmasked shoppers that's because the federal and state laws have to have loopholes
[3:02:52.640 --> 3:02:59.680]  for people that have anxiety issues or who have oxygen problems or asthma because they know about
[3:02:59.680 --> 3:03:06.240]  the lawsuits now and so that's why you tell people i don't need to wear a mask i have anxiety and then
[3:03:06.240 --> 3:03:10.720]  you can explain it's a fraud to them and when somebody comes up and threatens you that's their
[3:03:10.720 --> 3:03:16.560]  problem but see they're getting sued now and so they understand push back i was in florida i went

[3:06:41.440 --> 3:06:45.440]  four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic we've got a limited

[3:06:59.120 --> 3:07:04.560]  of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day and

[3:07:09.040 --> 3:07:14.720]  i had an internal digestive problem and i suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors
[3:07:14.720 --> 3:07:19.280]  they tried every time nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when i kept hearing you
[3:07:19.280 --> 3:07:22.960]  and dr group and those commercials i said you know what i'm gonna get me some of that freaking
[3:07:22.960 --> 3:07:26.320]  living defense now i wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have

[3:07:37.040 --> 3:07:53.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:07:53.440 --> 3:08:11.280]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show with jerald solente
[3:08:11.280 --> 3:08:25.120]  and i don't have a jacket on today it's hot up here in kingstown and i don't like air conditioning
[3:08:25.120 --> 3:08:34.000]  i can't stand this stuff so anyway thanks for having me on and it's a big day today but not for
[3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:46.800]  people who listen to info wars it's old news hey you see gold new highs that's right hey how about
[3:08:46.800 --> 3:08:56.880]  that silver spiking no surprise no surprise we called it we called it perfectly you go back
[3:08:56.880 --> 3:09:06.000]  to your trends journal trend alert trend alert june what was it six two thousand and nineteen
[3:09:06.880 --> 3:09:18.000]  the gold bull run has begun gold was one thousand three hundred and thirty two dollars an ounce
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:28.240]  and now it's headed to a two thousand an ounce silver go back to your trends journal mid-jun
[3:09:28.800 --> 3:09:38.480]  of this year and gold was floating around 1750 and now it's shooting up into as high 20s
[3:09:38.480 --> 3:09:46.400]  we said silver was going to take off an increase at a more rapid rate than gold
[3:09:47.920 --> 3:09:55.920]  it's going to particularly spike we wrote when gold goes over two thousand dollars an ounce
[3:10:00.160 --> 3:10:03.360]  the reason it's going up is very simple
[3:10:03.360 --> 3:10:14.560]  the global economy has crashed the only people that don't know it
[3:10:16.960 --> 3:10:17.760]  are the people
[3:10:20.880 --> 3:10:26.240]  that listen to prostitutes on the mainstream media
[3:10:26.240 --> 3:10:36.240]  go back to when they started locking down everywhere this is what all those little low
[3:10:36.240 --> 3:10:43.280]  life liberals said oh it'll come back oh it'll come back
[3:10:46.720 --> 3:10:52.000]  it's not coming back it's gone it's over
[3:10:52.000 --> 3:10:57.920]  oh wait till we get a vaccination that'll come back that's the line they're putting out now
[3:11:00.080 --> 3:11:09.440]  the global economy is crashed gold and silver are spiking because of all the digital trash
[3:11:10.560 --> 3:11:17.920]  backed by nothing and printed on nothing that the central banksters are pumping into the system
[3:11:17.920 --> 3:11:24.320]  to artificially prop it up end of story
[3:11:28.720 --> 3:11:32.560]  one central bank after another and then the governments
[3:11:33.840 --> 3:11:37.840]  oh they were talking at the beginning of this year right you know we may see a deficit of a
[3:11:37.840 --> 3:11:43.120]  trillion dollars this year or how much is it going to go up now or maybe four trillion
[3:11:43.120 --> 3:11:46.400]  this is all fake money
[3:11:49.840 --> 3:11:52.560]  and as we've been saying they're going to come out with a new currency
[3:11:53.520 --> 3:11:57.200]  and now even in a new trends journal they'll be coming out tomorrow it's a weekly
[3:11:57.840 --> 3:12:04.480]  Greg Manorino Gregory Manorino is writing about it the feds are going to do it as well
[3:12:05.200 --> 3:12:10.880]  they're crashing currencies so between the fiscal which means governments pumping fake
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:20.640]  money in and building up debt the fiscal money being pumped in and the suckerberg digital trash
[3:12:20.640 --> 3:12:24.960]  backed by nothing and printed on nothing being printed
[3:12:27.600 --> 3:12:34.000]  gold and silver are going to spike is my forecast and I do not give financial advice
[3:12:35.120 --> 3:12:38.240]  a motto of the trends journal is think for yourself
[3:12:38.240 --> 3:12:45.520]  I will put my track record up against calling this against anybody in the business yeah a lot of
[3:12:45.520 --> 3:12:52.480]  people have been saying was going to go up we gave the precise dates the precise dates
[3:12:54.240 --> 3:13:02.960]  silver is up some 35 percent since I called it in June gold forget about it
[3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:12.560]  again one thousand three hundred and thirty two dollars an ounce when I said it today we're floating
[3:13:12.560 --> 3:13:25.520]  in the hit in the mid nineteen hundreds get ready we are living in it the greatest depression
[3:13:25.520 --> 3:13:33.520]  at the issue look at all the violence going on around the world beyond what's beyond the
[3:13:33.520 --> 3:13:39.600]  protests in portland and in seattle and in these feet it's all over the world
[3:13:41.920 --> 3:13:50.480]  this thing is unfolding people are losing everything and you know what I say when people
[3:13:50.480 --> 3:13:55.920]  lose everything and have nothing left to lose they lose it which is why we also have Bradley
[3:13:55.920 --> 3:14:07.440]  Steiner one of america's top close combat and survivalist experts now writing each week in the
[3:14:07.440 --> 3:14:17.280]  trends journal survivalism and you're on info wards you're getting the products that you need
[3:14:17.280 --> 3:14:26.560]  to prepare for this remember when they used to make fun of us as people that prepared for the worst
[3:14:29.200 --> 3:14:30.480]  look at what the little
[3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:44.160]  say no masochists do in the masochists when things got bad what did they do back in February and
[3:14:44.160 --> 3:14:55.120]  early March you know how they prepared I'm not making this up they ran out and bought toilet paper
[3:14:56.560 --> 3:15:04.480]  wars would stay in a Bronx toilet paper and by the way Brad steiner's a Bronx cat too we got a
[3:15:04.480 --> 3:15:11.520]  different attitude than a lot of people around yes yes yes because if you don't fight for your freedom
[3:15:11.520 --> 3:15:19.440]  you just could be nothing but a little boy a girl in slave landia and that's what most of america's
[3:15:19.440 --> 3:15:33.360]  become when I held the rally to unite for peace and restore freedom the daily freeman the paper here
[3:15:33.360 --> 3:15:42.640]  oh the people take out after me oh they were waiting for a big spike in virus
[3:15:44.480 --> 3:15:55.680]  cases you know that they came out with yesterday the paper the virus cases are down all these
[3:15:55.680 --> 3:16:05.520]  little gutless boys and girls these imbecilic liberals and they're not liberals they're bolsheviks
[3:16:05.520 --> 3:16:12.480]  they're soviets you don't want to do what we tell you to do then you are no good you don't
[3:16:12.480 --> 3:16:19.280]  have a right to think for yourself all these little cowards that call me out for having a

[3:30:08.240 --> 3:30:13.760]  happening in blue cities in blue states it's because they intubate them putting a tube in their lungs
[3:30:13.760 --> 3:30:19.520]  and covet 19 is causing an autoimmune response and if you do that with oxygen the doctors are on
[3:30:19.520 --> 3:30:25.760]  records saying it will kill you but all these doctors in blue cities in blue states follow their

[3:32:39.120 --> 3:32:44.160]  at infowarstore.com you can wear them out to political events you can trigger live darts
[3:32:44.160 --> 3:32:49.760]  but one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or
[3:32:50.400 --> 3:32:55.600]  at halloween but on top of that they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to
[3:32:55.600 --> 3:33:00.320]  protect you from COVID-19 or anything else it's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared
[3:33:00.320 --> 3:33:06.080]  for the force inoculations and contact tracing of their openly announcing it's an active submission
[3:33:06.080 --> 3:33:11.040]  it's an act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down but a big reason to wear these is
[3:33:11.040 --> 3:33:16.320]  then into stores when people ask you why you're wearing a halloween mask say it's just as useless
[3:33:16.320 --> 3:33:22.240]  that's the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing and the m95 mask only control what's coming in
[3:33:22.240 --> 3:33:27.360]  not what's going out so they quote spread COVID-19 they don't protect from it so again it's a great
[3:33:27.360 --> 3:33:32.240]  way to throw it back in these control freak spaces you buy one for 9.95 you get four more free
[3:33:32.240 --> 3:33:48.160]  they're at cost info or store.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:02.560 --> 3:34:11.520]  leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order it's alex jones and now your host
[3:34:11.520 --> 3:34:22.480]  gerald salente hello hello and it's great being on the alex jones show and as i said you better
[3:34:22.480 --> 3:34:29.200]  prepare to survive because this thing's going down fast and hard yeah look at gold i was just
[3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:40.800]  talking about what happened back in 1933 hey and what's gold selling at now oh 1933 so again 1933
[3:34:41.600 --> 3:34:50.800]  and when i said gold was going to spike it was $1,300 and about $33 an ounce so i said so what is
[3:34:50.800 --> 3:35:01.440]  that it's $600 an ounce higher than when i said to buy it i didn't say to buy it i said it would go
[3:35:01.440 --> 3:35:10.160]  up again i'll give finance advice so going back to some other trends wear no mask you're under
[3:35:10.160 --> 3:35:16.400]  attack this is from the new trends journal going on tomorrow forget the scientific facts as we have
[3:35:16.400 --> 3:35:21.200]  continually reported in the trends journal regarding the ineffectiveness and dangers of face mask
[3:35:21.200 --> 3:35:27.360]  wearing if you don't wear one because you believe the data and think for yourself you'll be attacked
[3:35:27.360 --> 3:35:35.760]  by politicians the public and the media this was the 22nd july headline in newsweek or as i would
[3:35:35.760 --> 3:35:42.560]  say more appropriately call it last weeks because it's last week's news next week but here's the
[3:35:42.560 --> 3:35:55.360]  headline narcissists and psychopaths are more likely to refuse to wear masks isn't that something
[3:35:57.040 --> 3:35:57.840]  there you got it
[3:36:01.440 --> 3:36:08.320]  that's what they do that's the fear forget what the new england journal and medicine said
[3:36:08.320 --> 3:36:16.400]  forget what the world health organization said forget what the census of disease control said
[3:36:17.280 --> 3:36:24.960]  forget what all these other researchers have found we're going to sell our crap which is fear
[3:36:25.840 --> 3:36:26.880]  and you're going to buy it
[3:36:30.080 --> 3:36:32.640]  then there's another one
[3:36:32.640 --> 3:36:46.640]  one this is from alt net put an alt net and what they say about alt net is where do i have it here
[3:36:46.640 --> 3:36:56.640]  and i'm gonna lose it um here they are alt net is a politically left-wing leaning website
[3:36:56.640 --> 3:37:03.600]  that was launched in 1998 by the nonprofit now known as independent media institute
[3:37:06.880 --> 3:37:13.680]  either they're very stupid or they think everybody else is how can you have an independent media
[3:37:13.680 --> 3:37:21.120]  institute and admit that your politically left leaning website how could anybody
[3:37:21.120 --> 3:37:28.880]  that could think for themselves lean either politically left or politically right how
[3:37:28.880 --> 3:37:36.560]  about oh you got to be politically correct how about no politics at all how about keeping
[3:37:36.560 --> 3:37:43.200]  politics out of this and thinking for yourself they wrote an article
[3:37:43.200 --> 3:37:52.160]  a few days ago that is one of the most disgusting pieces of crap
[3:37:53.600 --> 3:38:04.560]  that i have read in a long time the headline is here's your field guide the five main types
[3:38:04.560 --> 3:38:13.840]  of pandemic deniers so in other words if you could think for yourself and you're not a low
[3:38:13.840 --> 3:38:23.040]  life piece of slimy crap oh this came from salon yeah salon shi you know a lot then you're a
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:40.160]  denier you can't think for yourself so they went on to say the article written with total bias as
[3:38:40.160 --> 3:38:46.400]  i write it and demanding us to subjugate to a higher authorities is void of any scientific data
[3:38:46.400 --> 3:38:54.720]  yet it begins with begins with quote every day there is more data to prove the dangers of the
[3:38:54.720 --> 3:39:03.600]  coronavirus yet bizarrely the more proof we have of the damage of the pandemic
[3:39:05.120 --> 3:39:08.960]  the more vicious and hysterical its deniers
[3:39:08.960 --> 3:39:21.040]  they don't show one shred of proof why because it's salon because they're left
[3:39:21.040 --> 3:39:27.120]  leaning we don't have to show you proof i could show you proof how about this proof that you
[3:39:27.120 --> 3:39:38.080]  could shove up you know what the toilet paper or record the new york times reported quote
[3:39:38.080 --> 3:39:42.960]  the disturbingly large numbers of coronavirus cases reported each day since the pandemic
[3:39:42.960 --> 3:39:50.880]  exploded may in fact be low by a lot a study from the census disease control and prevention cdc
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:57.760]  found that the number of infected people quote far exceeds the number of reported cases and quote
[3:39:58.320 --> 3:40:07.040]  the study said that actual infection rates were up to 13 times higher this they buried in one little
[3:40:07.040 --> 3:40:16.480]  article i've mentioned this before so now let's put this together john hopkins university
[3:40:16.480 --> 3:40:22.400]  coronaviruses resource center says some four million americans have been infected with the virus
[3:40:23.200 --> 3:40:29.760]  however we write if the cdc estimate of up to 13 times higher that would bring it to
[3:40:29.760 --> 3:40:43.680]  you're ready 52 million people infected by the virus so with 149 200 deaths again we wrote this
[3:40:43.680 --> 3:41:01.920]  yesterday in the u.s the virus as of sunday 99.77 percent of the people will recover from the virus
[3:41:01.920 --> 3:41:17.520]  but yet they write this crap in alt net and salon that we are deniers
[3:41:17.520 --> 3:41:26.720]  they call us cove idiots
[3:41:29.520 --> 3:41:39.040]  that derives from this nation's long resistance to expertise and quote
[3:41:39.040 --> 3:41:49.600]  you got it fear is the real virus and that's what they've been selling we quoted that guy
[3:41:49.600 --> 3:41:54.800]  jeff zucker and you could put any letter you want in front of that zucker you could call
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:42:04.880]  it an s or anything else of cnn telling his staff to keep promoting the coronavirus because
[3:42:04.880 --> 3:42:11.600]  more people were tuning in as their ratings were going into the toilet where prostitutes hang out
[3:42:13.600 --> 3:42:19.680]  that's all they sell is the crap in the toilet just like they were selling that
[3:42:21.280 --> 3:42:24.640]  storm that's hitting hawaii you know what it was last week
[3:42:24.640 --> 3:42:36.720]  we're storm on the planet oh wow way my own we're storm on the planet there he is that's a zucker
[3:42:39.360 --> 3:42:46.480]  yep let's just stay very focused on this look at this look at these people look at them
[3:42:46.480 --> 3:42:53.600]  a freak show in front of everybody's eyes
[3:42:55.760 --> 3:42:56.880]  so that's what they're doing
[3:42:59.200 --> 3:43:03.520]  they're selling fear and hysteria and they've destroyed the economy
[3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:13.600]  it's not coming back it's only going to get much worse airline travel is dead tourism is dead
[3:43:13.600 --> 3:43:19.920]  all the summer spots that depended on people from the jersey sure to anywhere else around the
[3:43:19.920 --> 3:43:27.680]  world tourism americans banned in europe to go to europe 26 percent of american tourism
[3:43:30.000 --> 3:43:38.320]  but 26 percent of the tourism but excuse me comes from americans in europe restaurants are empty
[3:43:38.320 --> 3:43:45.760]  hotels are empty people are freaking out everywhere this is going down hard
[3:43:46.480 --> 3:43:52.240]  it's going down big new york city is empty a lot of places still boarded up
[3:43:54.320 --> 3:44:05.360]  kingston is dead god he used to be packed one of the hippest places around all over the country
[3:44:05.360 --> 3:44:11.440]  so the motto of the trends journal is think for yourself you better think for yourself
[3:44:12.000 --> 3:44:17.600]  and i'm just saying you better prepare for the worst if the worst doesn't happen you've lost
[3:44:17.600 --> 3:44:36.080]  nothing if the worst happens you need to prepare you lose everything see you next week
