[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[00:26.000 --> 00:32.000]  Well, President Obama has told Politico that he's energized. He's not depressed.
[00:32.000 --> 00:42.000]  And he should be energized. No one has ever destroyed the sovereignty of the United States of America like President Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:42.000 --> 00:53.000]  And you've got all his different foils going on. Oh, the open border advocates are mad at him. They're demonstrating. They're filing lawsuits.
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.000]  He didn't open the borders up enough. He didn't legalize enough people. He didn't do an executive order legalizing everybody.
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  That's because he's already done it outside of an executive order. And within that is the whole shill.
[01:06.000 --> 01:30.000]  So the people go, oh, immigration reform didn't happen yet as if it's immigration reform to get rid of our borders, rid of our sovereignty and give the political class and unlimited third world population to be a political army who will vote as they're told to vote because they're given welfare and other goodies.
[01:30.000 --> 01:41.000]  And Senator Sessions has come out and basically said the Democrats are all part of this executive takeover and are complicit.
[01:41.000 --> 01:49.000]  And that the executive takeover has already happened. Thank God for Senator Sessions three times with George W. Bush.
[01:49.000 --> 02:02.000]  Remember covering it right here on air, right here on this Sunday broadcast. He would leak the quote secret bill because you're not supposed to have a bill. Just trust us. It's not amnesty.
[02:02.000 --> 02:11.000]  And the Republican leadership wanted it. And now he says Senate Dems are willing accomplices and Obama's lawless executive amnesty.
[02:11.000 --> 02:24.000]  Yeah, he's doing it outside of an executive order and then saying I'm not going to act yet when in January they ordered the Border Patrol to basically stop apprehending anybody.
[02:24.000 --> 02:34.000]  I mean, come on, folks, you pay taxes for the welfare system and then you're going to say that unlimited people can come here and get everything for free.
[02:34.000 --> 02:43.000]  And I'm not on some jihad on some crusade against people from Latin America.
[02:43.000 --> 02:56.000]  It's just that the political class in this country is a bunch of lawyers and bankers that want to bankrupt the country as fast as they can to bring it into receivership and then reside over that collapse.
[02:56.000 --> 03:11.000]  And then use the unlimited Third World hordes as the global meltdown accelerates as the political mercenaries or Hessians to come in and take over the nation.
[03:11.000 --> 03:22.000]  You know, I'm German. I'm Al station. I got a lot of German on both sides of my family. My mom's pretty much German.
[03:22.000 --> 03:38.000]  I'm not against Germans, but I was against tens of thousands of German troops, Hessian troops, rebellion troops brought here in 1776 to fight the colonies.
[03:38.000 --> 03:45.000]  Just like I'm not against the German people. I'm against Hitler. I'm against a political plan.
[03:45.000 --> 03:54.000]  I'm against Latin Americans. I wish they were free and rich and I wish there was places nicer than us down there. I'd be living down there. I'm not afraid of brown people.
[03:54.000 --> 04:03.000]  I'm afraid of what's going on inside their heads. I'm afraid of the globalist wanting to bring them here to carry out their political plan.
[04:03.000 --> 04:12.000]  See, I've said this a thousand times. I'll say it again. The new world orders for gun control. I'm against it. I have a lot of intellectual reasons, but the globalist are bad people.
[04:12.000 --> 04:21.000]  They have bad will. They're enslavers. I'm default against anything they're for. They're for banker bailouts. I'm against it. They're for devaluing the dollar. I'm against it.
[04:21.000 --> 04:32.000]  They're for launching all these new wars and funding Al Qaeda. I'm against it. They are for satellite tracker boxes and all the cars attached by the mile. I'm against it.
[04:32.000 --> 04:42.000]  Basically, anything, therefore, I'm against it. But I watched these little tricks about it. Yeah, Obama's getting protested by the illegals.
[04:42.000 --> 04:49.000]  He went by LaRaza and met you and everybody because he didn't legalize everybody. He did. He already did.
[04:49.000 --> 04:58.000]  By Fiat. See how they play these mind games? I'm sick of it. Another Harvard lawyer running a scam. I see through it.
[04:58.000 --> 05:05.000]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[05:05.000 --> 05:14.000]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[05:14.000 --> 05:23.000]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[05:23.000 --> 05:30.000]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[05:30.000 --> 05:39.000]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:39.000 --> 05:48.000]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[05:48.000 --> 05:58.000]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2. Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at infowarslife.com.
[06:04.000 --> 06:08.000]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak. Let me think.
[06:08.000 --> 06:13.000]  Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[06:13.000 --> 06:14.000]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[06:14.000 --> 06:22.000]  Damn it. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[06:22.000 --> 06:28.000]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[06:28.000 --> 06:33.000]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[06:33.000 --> 06:37.000]  You designed it, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You told me every television in London.
[06:37.000 --> 06:41.000]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[06:41.000 --> 06:45.000]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit,
[06:45.000 --> 06:51.000]  you now have sensors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and submitting your submachine.
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.000]  We need cameras. How did this happen? Who's to blame?
[06:55.000 --> 07:00.000]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others. They will be held accountable.
[07:00.000 --> 07:06.000]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[07:06.000 --> 07:14.000]  I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease?
[07:14.000 --> 07:20.000]  There were a myriad of problems which inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[07:20.000 --> 07:27.000]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[07:27.000 --> 07:40.000]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[07:40.000 --> 07:48.000]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come.
[07:48.000 --> 07:56.000]  We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[07:56.000 --> 08:02.000]  My friends, it is already September 7th, 2014.
[08:02.000 --> 08:12.000]  We are live right now at 408 and 7 seconds Central Standard Time Broadcasting worldwide
[08:12.000 --> 08:22.000]  on AM and FM affiliates across the United States, Global Shortwave Satellite the Internet at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[08:22.000 --> 08:28.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[08:28.000 --> 08:37.000]  How does the tale of two cities begin? That classic novel. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.
[08:37.000 --> 08:44.000]  I've probably begun over the last 20 years of being on air. It's now 20 years, 20 years next month.
[08:44.000 --> 08:56.000]  In the last 20 years that I've been on air since October, so long ago.
[08:56.000 --> 09:02.000]  I've said many times it was the best of times. It was the worst of times.
[09:02.000 --> 09:10.000]  So when I talk about all these terrible things that are happening, it's so that we can have a debate about it
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  and try to change what's bad and promote what's good.
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.000]  Any culture that sweeps things under the rug will rot from the head down very, very quickly.
[09:22.000 --> 09:30.000]  I have a lot of geopolitical news on the economy, on ISIS, on what's happening to the Second Amendment.
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  There's just a lot of important news. Immigration, it's all coming up today.
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.000]  That's why I broadcast six days a week because so much is happening on the weekend.
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.000]  I like to get a jump on the news Sunday evenings.
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  Then we're back weekdays 11am to 2pm central.
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  When I talk about the best of times, worst of times, there is so much incredible goodness in this world.
[09:57.000 --> 10:05.000]  So many positive things, so many good people in the private sector, and government, and in universities,
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.000]  and in the whole culture, farmers, ranchers, auto mechanics, school teachers, it doesn't matter.
[10:10.000 --> 10:17.000]  Individually, there's a lot of beautiful people.
[10:17.000 --> 10:24.000]  But when we look at so many of the special interests that reside at the top of the pyramid,
[10:24.000 --> 10:32.000]  they want to secure their gains, much of which was gotten through government contracts and insider crony capitalist deals,
[10:32.000 --> 10:40.000]  that they want to bring in socialism for the grassroots to suppress us in a domesticated quagmire,
[10:40.000 --> 10:46.000]  where we're dependent on them like fishing a tank to be fed and to be taken care of.
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.000]  Well, I don't want to live like an animal.
[10:49.000 --> 11:02.000]  I want to control my own destiny. I want my children to be able to be free thinkers and worship what gods or not they will.
[11:02.000 --> 11:08.000]  The so-called atheists, those that promote the state, they want to be God. They want to be in charge.
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.000]  And I'm here to tell you, I am for separation of church and state.
[11:13.000 --> 11:21.000]  In this deceived world, we're taught by the authoritarians that call themselves liberals.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  The separation of church and state means the government runs the churches,
[11:25.000 --> 11:33.000]  and you can't tell people about Jesus Christ at a public school at lunch if you're a student,
[11:33.000 --> 11:42.000]  but they can tell you all day long about any other God or culture or Harry Potter that they see fit.
[11:42.000 --> 11:48.000]  When in truth, separation of church and state means Congress shall make no law,
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.000]  respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[11:53.000 --> 12:00.000]  It means government centrally has no jurisdiction. It's as if they're blind.
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  It's not their world. It's not their sector.
[12:03.000 --> 12:09.000]  It's not their prerogative to even have an opinion or to open their mouths.
[12:09.000 --> 12:16.000]  Instead, we have state-run religion under 501c3 in this country.
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.000]  And when I try to go to Baptist churches in town, they'll have little handouts of, show them on air,
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  where they say, even when you go to this picnic, don't discuss politics personally.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  There is no law. There is no regulation.
[12:29.000 --> 12:32.000]  There is only the intimidation of the central government,
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  and the fact that we now, to a great extent, have a state-run church in this country
[12:37.000 --> 12:44.000]  and state-run media.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  But our money that's supposed to be run by Congress is run by a private bank
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.000]  that calls itself the Federal Reserve. What a joke!
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  And they teach in public schools 2 plus 2 equals 5 under Common Core.
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.000]  We're living in a Twilight Zone episode.
[13:05.000 --> 13:13.000]  So there's a lot I'm going to cover today, but I'm going to break down coming up in the second hour today
[13:13.000 --> 13:23.000]  something of such massive import that if the public ever knew what I knew,
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  if the public ever knew what Dr. Andrew Wakefield knew,
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.000]  if the public ever knew and ever saw the documents that we're going to present
[13:33.000 --> 13:41.000]  and ever care, it would cause a chain reaction that would bring this whole system down.
[13:41.000 --> 13:50.000]  Do you care that from 1946 until the late 1970s,
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  there was a secret program to inject black people with syphilis?
[13:55.000 --> 14:03.000]  Do you care there was a program from the 1950s to 1990s to nerve gas U.S. troops until they died,
[14:03.000 --> 14:12.000]  until their families, they died of the flu? It's called Project Shad?
[14:12.000 --> 14:20.000]  See, because if the technocracy that runs things did that in thousands of different studies and tests
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.000]  that the general public's not aware of, the general public's only aware of a few of the more famous ones,
[14:25.000 --> 14:33.000]  what does it say about the people behind the curtain where presidents come and go, bureaucracies stay?
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  What makes this world tick? What is the governing philosophy of the ruling class?
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  I know what it is. I've read their books. I've read their writings.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  They think you're so stupid, they publish it all.
[14:44.000 --> 14:55.000]  In Ecoscience and a thousand other tomes, about their dream that makes Hitler look like a simpleton choir boy.
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  See, that's the world I live in, the real world.
[14:59.000 --> 15:06.000]  So we're going to tell you about the secrets of vaccines, not just from the whistleblowers of 2004,
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  but the whistleblowers of 2014, ten years later.
[15:10.000 --> 15:17.000]  Another top scientist who co-authored the study in 2004 has gone public saying it was all a fraud.
[15:17.000 --> 15:24.000]  They knew the vaccines were causing autoimmune disorders and inflammation on the brain and in the intestines and stomach
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  and was brain damaging millions of children every year.
[15:29.000 --> 15:35.000]  And it came out two weeks ago and there's been no mainstream media coverage of it
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.000]  as they try to silence the whistleblower. Of course the study said, Mercury's good for your child's brain.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  I don't need to read a study to know that was pure bull.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  Mercury's one of the most destructive heavy metals in the body.
[15:46.000 --> 15:52.000]  But we're going to break down the truth behind vaccines coming up as well today
[15:52.000 --> 16:07.000]  and let you know what the system doesn't want you to know and what could bring them down.
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  Then about a year ago he said, listen, if you think this is powerful,
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.000]  I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.000]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[16:35.000 --> 16:40.000]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[16:40.000 --> 16:46.000]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show,

[17:13.000 --> 17:18.000]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  Prime directed discredit Alex Jones.
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.000]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  These people are assaulting us.
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[17:33.000 --> 17:39.000]  They are never going to stop. They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[17:54.000 --> 18:20.000]  Collectually it's for God you can fail it.
[18:20.000 --> 18:26.000]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[18:26.000 --> 18:32.000]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe clean water.

[19:34.000 --> 19:38.000]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  Talk about the effects.
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning. I have drive to go to the gym.
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  I feel like I look better. I feel better. I feel sexier. I love it.

[20:09.000 --> 20:15.000]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[20:15.000 --> 20:20.000]  Government is the problem.
[20:20.000 --> 20:28.000]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[20:28.000 --> 20:36.000]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by and of the people.
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.000]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[20:42.000 --> 20:52.000]  That was Ronald Reagan bringing us in from 1984.
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  And whether Ronald Reagan actually carried out all the things he claimed he stood for,
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  what he stood for, at least verbally, was very good, very Americana.
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  Now we have Obama saying you didn't build your business.
[21:03.000 --> 21:07.000]  Raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit on and on and on.
[21:07.000 --> 21:11.000]  MSNBC says and promos your kids belong to the state.
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.000]  They are throwing it in our face.
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  And we know collectivism doesn't work for the average person.
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  It only works for the elites at the top that control the collectivism.
[21:24.000 --> 21:29.000]  Just during the break, I went back in the coffee room to get a glass of iced tea.
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  And we had Fox News and CNN as well on back there.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  But I was watching Fox News and they were debating about,
[21:35.000 --> 21:41.000]  oh, Obama is trying to spin this that he didn't get defeated on immigration reform.
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  But I'll tell you, he did.
[21:44.000 --> 21:47.000]  And then they went to Juan Williams who was saying,
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  well, the Republicans are very obstructionist, blah, blah, blah.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  The Republican leadership wrote the amnesty plan.
[21:53.000 --> 21:57.000]  They tried to pass it three times under George W. Bush.
[21:57.000 --> 22:02.000]  The big banks, the big multinationals want to drive wages down.
[22:02.000 --> 22:05.000]  They want to politically be able to control the population.
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  They want to make this country a third world nation.
[22:08.000 --> 22:09.000]  Let's get that straight.
[22:09.000 --> 22:18.000]  The Republican leadership wrote with Ezekiel Emanuel from the Democrats, Obamacare.
[22:18.000 --> 22:22.000]  Our problem is the Republican leadership.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  Our problem is the rhinos.
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  Our problem is that we don't have two political parties in this country.
[22:28.000 --> 22:33.000]  We have one elitist globalist party and you've got both the Democrats and Republicans together
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.000]  as two wings of the same bird trying to destroy the Tea Party
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  and anybody who doesn't want to sell this country down the river.
[22:40.000 --> 22:46.000]  They want to butcher this nation like a Christmas hog.
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  They want to render us down like a corporate takeover of a healthy company.
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  They want to subdivide and sell off the assets and take a windfall profit up front
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.000]  when it's one-one-millionth of what we could do as a nation based on liberty and freedom.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  They are a bunch of pirates.
[23:03.000 --> 23:08.000]  But even the politically savvy only read The New York Times Wall Street Journal
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  and watch Fox News.
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  People that think they're savvy tune in and go,
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.000]  Yo, Obama, man, he sure got it on immigration.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  Oh, he sure got it.
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.000]  The borders are wide open since the beginning of this year.
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  We proved it, but it's since been in the precious New York Times.
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  So it exists now.
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.000]  The tree falling the far as Megasown only the New York Times reports on it
[23:31.000 --> 23:36.000]  that they bring the illegals in unlimited of any age, load them on buses,
[23:36.000 --> 23:41.000]  give them federal vouchers to bus them anywhere they want to go.
[23:41.000 --> 23:47.000]  And there's just a flood of hundreds of thousands of people 17 years older, younger,
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.000]  but they're only a small percentage of the overall flood.
[23:51.000 --> 23:56.000]  And again, we got checkpoints on highways, TSA checkpoints, all this garbage.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  The illegals can fly without ID.
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  I'm just pointing out the whole war on terror is a hoax.
[24:01.000 --> 24:07.000]  The whole security state in the name of keeping us safe is a fraud while the borders wide open.
[24:07.000 --> 24:13.000]  You better not try to put me in a naked body scanner or fondle.
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  Fondle me, okay, or my family.
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.000]  I'm sick of it. I've had enough of the NSA spying on me to stop Al Qaeda,
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.000]  who they've renamed ISIS, who our government gave Stinger missiles to in Benghazi.
[24:23.000 --> 24:28.000]  I told you that back when it happened three days after with top sources all confirmed.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  We broke everything on Benghazi first.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  I got to enjoy the death threats over it.
[24:35.000 --> 24:41.000]  I got to have the colonel calling me up saying, oh my God, I got to backtrack this on your show.
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.000]  Oh, yeah. Oh, that's the kind of stuff I have to deal with.
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  CIA whistleblowers talk plumbly.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  I'm not even bragging.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  Is it pearls before swine here, though?
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  Do you realize what you're being given on this show?
[24:55.000 --> 25:02.000]  Do you have any idea how we're light years ahead of anything you're going to get on television anywhere else or radio?
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  And it's not because these other shows don't know.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  They're all scared.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  Let me tell you, I don't want higher ratings.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  I don't want to get any bigger than I am.
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  How fast this show is exploding.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  Do you know how big on every platform we're getting?
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  We used to on our platforms have four or five million views on YouTube a week.
[25:21.000 --> 25:24.000]  Now we're getting like 10 million views on YouTube a week.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  And that's just on our channels.
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  We're getting AM and FM affiliates just everywhere.
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  You know how scary that is?
[25:32.000 --> 25:37.000]  The fact that the public is so awake that we're now seen as mainstream and it doesn't matter.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  The establishment doesn't even care.
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.000]  It doesn't even care.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  It's crazy. It's creepy.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  It's creepy.
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  I don't want to be the only one that knows this.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  I don't want to be the only one that understands this.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  I know I'm not the only one.
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  I know you know.
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  So get out there and warn people and expose it.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  Now, Obama says he's energized, not exhausted.
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  President Obama may seem fatigued after nearly six years in office,
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  but he said in an interview airing Sunday,
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  interviewing a former White House official, that's who interviews him.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  He considers himself energized.
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  Yeah, I just saw the clip by what he hopes to accomplish before leaving the White House.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  Obama's hair has grayed and he's spending less time worried about optics
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  and more time about the golf course.
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  But that doesn't mean he's exhausted, he told NBC's Chuck Todd.
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  He said some of the suggestions the president might be.
[26:29.000 --> 26:34.000]  He wanted to say that I know I've actually feel energized about the opportunities we've got.
[26:34.000 --> 26:40.000]  Is Obama defeated not getting amnesty with an executive order that's unconstitutional?
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  See, when an executive order is treason to just get rid of the border
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  and legalize anybody they feel like,
[26:47.000 --> 26:51.000]  when that can't be done, because the public's awake to it,
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.000]  you just do it without even an order, just with a secret order,
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  and then you have the Republicans come out and announce Obama's defeated,
[26:58.000 --> 27:03.000]  the border's secure, and all the Republicans go back in their holes
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.000]  and go back to the golf course and go to sleep.
[27:08.000 --> 27:15.000]  That's how the fake Republican-oid Fox News people control their only opposition
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  that the globalists see as the conservative libertarian movement in this country.
[27:18.000 --> 27:27.000]  They play you like a fiddle over and over and over and over again.
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  I've seen some criticism, it's a small amount of criticism,
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  in the aggregate, but it's substantial when you have millions of listeners every day,
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  saying, Alex, I've been listening to you for 15 years,
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  and I've never heard you endorse a war.
[27:40.000 --> 27:47.000]  I hate your guts now that you support Rand Paul saying that we should target and bomb ISIS.
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  Let me explain something.
[27:49.000 --> 27:55.000]  When Saudi Arabia supposedly is involved in the very suspicious attacks of 9-11,
[27:55.000 --> 27:59.000]  and then we attack Iraq with no proof, I was against that.
[27:59.000 --> 28:04.000]  When we attack Syria, who's fighting al-Qaeda,
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  when Syria didn't do anything to anybody,
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  I'm against it just like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and others were.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  I'm a moral person.
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  I try to judge and go with my gut and go with intellectual analysis.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  ISIS is real, folks.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  There's hundreds of thousands of them.
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.000]  At least 100,000 in Iraq, over 200,000 jihadis in Syria.
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  Blowing up every mosque is not radical.
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  Blowing up every church, cutting Christians' heads off,
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  blowing up ancient Jewish shrines, engaging in true war crimes.
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  And I am for taking them out.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  In fact, not just stopping them, destroying them.
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.000]  The problem is our government helped create them.
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  So when we come back, I'm going to break down the latest on ISIS.
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  The imminent threat homeland security says will happen.
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  They believe by September 11th.
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  I don't know if that's true.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  We're going to look at our reporters who are on the border.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  That's all coming up straight ahead.
[28:56.000 --> 29:25.000]  I'm going to explain why I'm for striking ISIS.
[29:27.000 --> 29:32.000]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.000]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years.
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  And I'm still fighting.
[29:38.000 --> 29:41.000]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're going to lose everything.
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  The Info War is worldwide.
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  Tell your friends about Info Wars and let them know that Info Wars doesn't print bull.

[31:00.000 --> 31:02.000]  Open your eyes.
[31:02.000 --> 31:05.000]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[31:05.000 --> 31:08.000]  Sight is the primary input to the brain.
[31:08.000 --> 31:12.000]  Arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[31:12.000 --> 31:15.000]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies,
[31:15.000 --> 31:20.000]  our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  Open your eyes.
[31:22.000 --> 31:28.000]  The ingredients like vitamin A, zinc, lutein, proprietary saffron bulb extracts and more.
[31:28.000 --> 31:37.000]  Occupower by Info Wars Life is the new formulation specifically designed to nutritionally assist the natural function of healthy eyes.

[32:24.000 --> 32:31.000]  About a year ago he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth and deep earth crystals.
[32:31.000 --> 32:35.000]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[32:35.000 --> 32:40.000]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[32:40.000 --> 32:47.000]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation,
[32:47.000 --> 32:49.000]  promoting true libertarian ideas.
[32:49.000 --> 33:01.000]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2. Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off Super Detox Special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[33:01.000 --> 33:10.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:10.000 --> 33:28.000]  You want to stop tyranny?
[33:28.000 --> 33:38.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:38.000 --> 33:48.000]  George Washington once said that government is a dangerous, dangerous servant like fire.
[33:48.000 --> 33:54.000]  It's a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[33:54.000 --> 34:02.000]  Power tends to corrupt, Lord Acton said, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[34:02.000 --> 34:12.000]  Power tends to explain the situation our world is in right now.
[34:12.000 --> 34:17.000]  Now, I've talked a lot about this and anybody can search in the terms I'm going to put out right now,
[34:17.000 --> 34:24.000]  or you can read articles at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com to prove this to yourself.
[34:24.000 --> 34:32.000]  But Saudi Arabia is the center of Islam. Mecca is based there.
[34:32.000 --> 34:39.000]  Muhammad came from that region that is now Saudi Arabia since 1931.
[34:39.000 --> 35:01.000]  And 79% of Islam is Sunni. And 15% or so of that, 10%, 15% of that is Wahhabist and those are the folks that basically behave like a group of gremlins on PCP.
[35:01.000 --> 35:09.000]  They're the ones that like to saw little kids' heads off and things for no reason at all and eat hearts on television and the rest of it.
[35:09.000 --> 35:19.000]  The craziest tend to rule and lead this group. They make the bad guys in the road warrior look like Cub Scout leaders.
[35:19.000 --> 35:24.000]  Let's just say they're scum of the earth.
[35:24.000 --> 35:31.000]  British intelligence over 100 years ago basically financed them to take over the Middle East.
[35:31.000 --> 35:38.000]  You can look that up, Lawrence of Arabia, the whole nine yards, because no one can deny they're vicious.
[35:38.000 --> 35:46.000]  They wanted to counter the Ottoman Empire and collapse it and they did what was left of it, some of the vestigial parts of it.
[35:46.000 --> 35:53.000]  But the issue I want to raise now is that if you don't know history, you are doomed to repeat it.
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  Well, another British statesman.
[35:57.000 --> 36:02.000]  And I remember it was in the Associated Press, other publications, London Telegraph about a month ago.
[36:02.000 --> 36:08.000]  Don't kick ISIS off the Internet. Let them be on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Let them recruit.
[36:08.000 --> 36:15.000]  Because then we could track them better. No, they were given 15,000 heat seeking missiles.
[36:15.000 --> 36:23.000]  They were allowed to operate because they work for the globalist to destabilize the world.
[36:23.000 --> 36:33.000]  And if ISIS becomes stronger and there's real attacks in the West, they can take American and European liberties in the name of fighting an enemy they created.
[36:33.000 --> 36:40.000]  It doesn't mean they get daily orders from the Pentagon or from Tel Aviv or from Turkey, the Istanbul.
[36:40.000 --> 36:46.000]  It means the door's been opened, they've been armed, they've been protected to just run around crazy.
[36:46.000 --> 36:53.000]  They try to take over Kurdistan, take over oil fields, okay, bomb them, paint by the numbers, stay where you're supposed to go, ISIS.
[36:53.000 --> 37:03.000]  They've used these groups against our allies in Egypt. You name it. They've taken over Tripoli and Libya and are murdering everybody that isn't a Wahhabist right now.
[37:03.000 --> 37:12.000]  This is the globalist secret army for worldwide destabilization. And then I get up this morning and I go to infowars.com.
[37:12.000 --> 37:22.000]  And there is mainstream British newspapers with the government saying let the jihadis, because a bunch of them come from England, come back to England.
[37:22.000 --> 37:33.000]  Then we can understand Al Qaeda, its new name, ISIS. Just like the leader of the 7-7 bombings, it came out on Fox News and even CNN.
[37:33.000 --> 37:44.000]  We interviewed the former Justice Department counterterrorism director, John Loftus, here on the radio about it after he was on those shows.
[37:44.000 --> 37:53.000]  They said, no, that's British intelligence. No, they run Al Qaeda right now.
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.000]  They're in the news today saying let tens of thousands of jihadis come back to England, don't block their flight.
[37:59.000 --> 38:06.000]  Senator Ted Cruz introduced a bill to not let you come back if you fight for Al Qaeda, now named ISIS.
[38:06.000 --> 38:16.000]  And I totally agree. The point is, we all have to lose our liberties and have the NSA spy on us, supposedly because of Al Qaeda, now known as ISIS or IS, Islamic State,
[38:16.000 --> 38:24.000]  when they're saying, oh, don't shut down their Twitter and Facebook, let them fly around all they want, because they work for the West.
[38:24.000 --> 38:33.000]  And Obama's bombing an old Jeep or bombing some artillery, they're not bombing ISIS. They've been funding them for four years to bring down Syria.
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  And when they couldn't, they spilt back into Iraq, across the border.
[38:37.000 --> 38:48.000]  And they're now supposed to set up their new Islamic State, taking part of Syria, if they get outside of it, they get bombed.
[38:48.000 --> 38:55.000]  They have a treatment they do for burns, other infections. They'll actually put maggot eggs inside your body, where you have gangrene or whatever.
[38:55.000 --> 39:03.000]  The maggots, the fly larva, will eat the rotten meat. And if they get outside that area, you just burn them with a laser.
[39:03.000 --> 39:09.000]  That's kind of what this is. They planted a bunch of fly eggs in the Middle East, and they're only allowed to eat the areas that they're supposed to be in.
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.000]  It's like Al Qaeda's like globalist nanotech or something.
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  And that's what's happening. I mean, here are the headlines.
[39:16.000 --> 39:25.000]  U.S. military launches airstrikes near Iraq's Haditha Dam, where Al Qaeda has taken over for months, known as ISIS.
[39:25.000 --> 39:30.000]  ISIS fighters must be allowed back into the U.K., says ex-MI6 chief.
[39:30.000 --> 39:37.000]  Counterterrorism expert Richard Barrett says, repentant jihadists.
[39:37.000 --> 39:44.000]  Oh, I'm repentant. Remember, the head of the 7-7 bombings, it turned out, was MI6.
[39:44.000 --> 39:49.000]  Oh, I mean, the people blowing themselves up were real, but they were working for MI6.
[39:49.000 --> 39:57.000]  I'm going to say this again. MI6 literally went out and found nutballs, had them go carry out the attack bare minimum,
[39:57.000 --> 40:05.000]  and then protected their leader was his name, Rashida Swat, who's still allowed to live in a mansion and fly around and be free.
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.000]  No, don't let these people in to blow stuff up so you can take my freedom.
[40:09.000 --> 40:16.000]  No, no, no, no, no.
[40:16.000 --> 40:22.000]  Do you understand this? Our governments are funding these crazy people, letting them in to do this.
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  I get censored on Facebook and Twitter all the time.
[40:25.000 --> 40:31.000]  Navy Seals that exposed Obama on Benghazi had their Facebook shut down and became national news last year.
[40:31.000 --> 40:36.000]  Do you understand? We have some viral meme that's reaching tens of millions. They just kill it.
[40:36.000 --> 40:47.000]  But ISIS is allowed to operate. I am not allowed to operate to try to expose all this or expose vaccine damage or GMO dangerous killing rats.
[40:47.000 --> 40:56.000]  I just want public good. I just want to help society. I'm no angel, but I have an instinct to want to do good, do no harm.
[40:56.000 --> 41:01.000]  I'm not a doctor. I've not taken a Hippocratic oath, but I get it.
[41:01.000 --> 41:08.000]  Look at this. And then we've got links in this article here from the London Observer where they go through it all.
[41:08.000 --> 41:15.000]  They're announcing, oh, let the jihadis that are eating hearts, sawing off heads, blowing up churches, blowing up non-radical Muslim mosques.
[41:15.000 --> 41:22.000]  I mean, they've killed over 400,000 people, 300,000 lands at Journal in Syria, 100,000 Iraq.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  That's a conservative number. Let's let them back in.
[41:25.000 --> 41:33.000]  Okay. But when I flew back in from Grand Cayman a few months ago, I'd been put on a terror watch list and had to get interrogated.
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.000]  And when the customs officials came out, they said, we're listeners. We can't believe this. We're so ashamed.
[41:38.000 --> 41:46.000]  And she said, you can go. But they said, soon, Mr. Jones will be a robot, a computer in control. We won't be able to let you back in. We're sorry.
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.000]  Okay. So you understand, I won't be able to leave the country or come back soon.
[41:51.000 --> 41:58.000]  But ISIS can, because this is going on here in the U.S. It turns out ISIS is going back and forth between the Middle East and the U.S.
[41:58.000 --> 42:06.000]  That was in ABC News a few days ago, and they earned the news going, well, we need to let them in, blah, blah, blah. We can track them.
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.000]  What you can track, the spiders you put in our bed.
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.000]  And then when they bite us, you're there selling us anti-spider venom, which is tyranny.
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  Look at this article. Don't bomb ISIS Syria, Iraq, Iran, or anyplace else from Blue Rockwell.
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.000]  I want to get Blue Rockwell on about this this week. But look, I get not being for war. I've never supported one military action.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  And quite frankly, they won't really target ISIS here, so they'll all be fake.
[42:33.000 --> 42:40.000]  But in spirit, I agree with Rand Paul saying, don't stop ISIS, destroy ISIS. This is al-Qaida.
[42:40.000 --> 42:47.000]  Again, the war on terror is fake, but it doesn't mean there isn't real terrorist.
[42:47.000 --> 42:51.000]  The war on terror helps create these pieces of crap they have to be dealt with.
[42:51.000 --> 43:10.000]  Now, we've got one of the biggest medical stories ever. This is huge whistleblower level, confirmed documented info coming up.
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.000]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  Can you put two and two together?
[43:39.000 --> 43:47.000]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced and fully legal.
[43:47.000 --> 43:55.000]  But for how long? Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.
[43:55.000 --> 44:20.000]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[44:33.000 --> 44:40.000]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients,
[44:40.000 --> 44:45.000]  and completely vegan weave and pre-screen our survival shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the earth,
[44:48.000 --> 44:59.000]  X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or call 1-888-253-3139.
[44:59.000 --> 45:06.000]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.000]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[45:10.000 --> 45:18.000]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[45:18.000 --> 45:23.000]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[45:23.000 --> 45:31.000]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.000]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.000]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[45:40.000 --> 45:47.000]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation,
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.000]  promoting true libertarian ideas.
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.000]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.
[45:53.000 --> 45:59.000]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at infowarslife.com.
[45:59.000 --> 46:06.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[46:08.000 --> 46:14.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[46:14.000 --> 46:19.000]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[46:19.000 --> 46:22.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[46:22.000 --> 46:30.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions. And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[46:30.000 --> 46:39.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape
[46:39.000 --> 46:45.000]  but that we can fight back against, made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[46:45.000 --> 46:51.000]  The new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[46:51.000 --> 46:58.000]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[47:25.000 --> 47:30.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[47:30.000 --> 47:37.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:37.000 --> 47:47.000]  Friday we had William Benny who was the director of the National Security Agency Technology Division.
[47:47.000 --> 47:53.000]  Basically number three or number four in the whole agency. So they've tried to put in prison for exposing the illegal spying.
[47:53.000 --> 48:01.000]  The highest level NSA whistleblower ever. The guy is a complete hero. They've tried to destroy him. It's like a Hollywood movie what they've done to him.
[48:01.000 --> 48:12.000]  We have another hero with us this hour into the next hour and that's Dr. Andrew Wakefield who is a medical doctor MD, MB and England lives here in Austin.
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.000]  And he's an academic gastro-ologist. I'm pronouncing that wrong.
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.000]  Receiving his medical degree from St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, University of London and other degrees.
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.000]  Royal College of Pathologist. I'm not going to go over his whole background.
[48:27.000 --> 48:32.000]  AutismmediaChannel.com is a good website to check.
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.000]  We'll also give you his YouTube channel as well. Autism Media Channel.
[48:37.000 --> 48:46.000]  I got a call from about two weeks ago a few days before it broke saying a major CDC scientist.
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.000]  Centers for Disease Control is going to go public in the next week.
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.000]  And we'd like to work with you on this. They were part of a study in 2004.
[48:56.000 --> 49:02.000]  A study we've ridiculed where they say mercury is good for children's brains. It's like saying bullets are good for your head.
[49:02.000 --> 49:10.000]  So scientists, I know mercury's deadly for the brain. I know electrochemically we've shown electron microscope clips on television from universities.
[49:10.000 --> 49:16.000]  There's nothing more destructive in the brain from my research except cyanide.
[49:16.000 --> 49:21.000]  And it's debated whether it's worse than cyanide in brain tissue. It may be worse.
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.000]  So he's saying mercury's bad. He's the kook. He's the weirdo. He's saying 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[49:26.000 --> 49:34.000]  I'm going to throw some tomatoes at him here. That's what mainstream media did. So they came out with this article a few years ago saying a hoax.
[49:34.000 --> 49:41.000]  He's been discredited with his study. There's no links to autism for his valiant study in England with children.
[49:41.000 --> 49:46.000]  It turned out the British government years before he already knew it had done a similar study.
[49:46.000 --> 49:54.000]  We had whistleblowers on Tamarissol from the CDC. The director of its own memo came out in 2004 from 2000 that they knew it was causing autism
[49:54.000 --> 49:59.000]  and said don't give it to your kids. That was in the meetings. There it is, CDC.
[49:59.000 --> 50:08.000]  Natural, neutral on Tamarissol and flu vaccine for toddlers. So they try all sorts of spin out there.
[50:08.000 --> 50:19.000]  He'll be with us throughout the next hour, but no media covered one of the top scientists, a co-author of the pro vaccine story.
[50:19.000 --> 50:30.000]  This scientist has now gone public saying in one area it tripled autism in black male boys.
[50:30.000 --> 50:38.000]  We'll explain why it targets boys more than girls with Dr. Wakefield, but we've got seven minutes till break, sir.
[50:38.000 --> 50:48.000]  I want to give you the floor here, but you are such a hero just like William Benny of the NSA, the director of their technology division.
[50:48.000 --> 50:56.000]  Going public, you hit the bar bar first. You charged the machine gun nest. You were absolutely attacked, lied about.
[50:56.000 --> 51:03.000]  You're suing in court. It's gone to the appellate about the definition that you believe is clearly there.
[51:03.000 --> 51:08.000]  I agree with you, but this is the type of stuff that they engage in.
[51:08.000 --> 51:15.000]  It's a hoax. Wakefield's wrong. Water is not wet. The sky is not blue. Two plus two equals a billion, not four.
[51:15.000 --> 51:19.000]  But this is such a huge victory, and you told me as you came in, beaming.
[51:19.000 --> 51:25.000]  I know you've lived in Austin for four, five, six years. I've gotten to know you well. You've been a little bit depressed.
[51:25.000 --> 51:31.000]  Now you seem to be beaming another victory with more whistleblowers on vaccines coming out.
[51:31.000 --> 51:38.000]  We're really seeing humanity find its soul again, and I've just got to congratulate you on what you've done for humanity.
[51:38.000 --> 51:46.000]  You said, don't congratulate me during the break in a tear in your eye. How many children have been put against the wall lined up in a vaccine firing squad?
[51:46.000 --> 51:51.000]  And it's not that we're against the science of inoculation. I know there's some truth to that. You have said that yourself.
[51:51.000 --> 51:59.000]  It's that what they're putting in it, what they're doing is so dangerous. So you're the expert. Tell us what's coming up in the next hour,
[51:59.000 --> 52:05.000]  and how big this new whistleblower is, and why they're blacking it out, Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[52:05.000 --> 52:10.000]  Alex, it's great to be back. Thank you very much. This has been a momentous couple of weeks.
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.000]  I don't remember anything quite like it in the last 20 years, but just to back up a little bit.
[52:14.000 --> 52:23.000]  The first study we did was on the MMR vaccine back in 1998, and that was a vaccine, a live viral vaccine that parents had linked to autism.
[52:23.000 --> 52:31.000]  It did not have thimerosal in, but many of the other vaccines, particularly those in use in this country, did have thimerosal, the mercury preservative.
[52:31.000 --> 52:40.000]  That had been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders over here, and we think, as you pointed out, that these things are interacting with each other to potentiate the risk.
[52:40.000 --> 52:47.000]  But just in the last two weeks, and great thanks, great credit to Brian Hooker, Dr. Brian Hooker, who bought this whistleblower out.
[52:47.000 --> 53:00.000]  Dr. William Thompson, a senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has come forward and admitted to 13 years of fraud and cover-up of the link between MMR vaccine and autism.
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  Because of a tortured conscience?
[53:02.000 --> 53:03.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  I mean, this is epic.
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[53:06.000 --> 53:11.000]  No, he did that, and he raised these concerns way back in 2001, 2002.
[53:11.000 --> 53:19.000]  He went right to the top of the CDC to Julie Gerberding, who, as you well know, went straight from the CDC to become head of vaccines at Merck.
[53:19.000 --> 53:23.000]  So he's been a tortured soul for 14 years, worried about this?
[53:23.000 --> 53:29.000]  Yes, he has, and he finally came forward to Dr. Hooker, and he really spilled his heart out.
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.000]  And told him the truth about what had happened.
[53:32.000 --> 53:40.000]  They had tested the hypothesis, the idea that the younger age of exposure that you got the MMR, the greater the risk of autism, that makes sense.
[53:40.000 --> 53:46.000]  Because when you get natural measles, if you get it under one, then the outcome is likely to be worse than if you get it over one.
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  So we see this with natural infection.
[53:48.000 --> 53:53.000]  In fact, we put that idea forward to the CDC back in 2000, 2001.
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  So they tested that idea, and they showed that it was correct.
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  They spent the next three years working out how to get rid of that effect.
[54:00.000 --> 54:08.000]  So they didn't have to admit to the fact that MMR vaccine was, in fact, for some children not safe.
[54:08.000 --> 54:14.000]  And he's come out with his lawyer for two weeks, and I've seen almost no mainstream media coverage of this.
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.000]  Do these reporters not care about their children?
[54:17.000 --> 54:22.000]  Do we know how they're – because even if it wasn't true, even he was crazy, which no one's saying,
[54:22.000 --> 54:29.000]  this is a big issue to have one of the main authors in a multi-hundred million dollar facility system
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  saying, we covered this up.
[54:31.000 --> 54:35.000]  This is definitely causing autism in boys threefold.
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.000]  I mean, this is just giant news.
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  And so there's a whole other story here.
[54:40.000 --> 54:48.000]  How is the media so controlled that this vindicating information that could save tens of millions of children's brains
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.000]  with autism going from one in 30,000 to one in 68 now?
[54:52.000 --> 54:53.000]  Just epidemic.
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.000]  How could this not be national news?
[54:56.000 --> 54:57.000]  It is extraordinary, isn't it?
[54:57.000 --> 55:03.000]  How much the media is controlled, is owned by, I believe, their sponsors and influence from the government.
[55:03.000 --> 55:04.000]  It is incredible.
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.000]  I mean, what Dr. Thompson described – let me just give you the context here.
[55:08.000 --> 55:13.000]  If this were a money laundering ring, Dr. Thompson would be the accountant.
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  He is the man with the numbers.
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.000]  He did the analysis.
[55:16.000 --> 55:17.000]  He knows.
[55:17.000 --> 55:18.000]  So he is the key guy.
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.000]  And when he comes forward and says this, then you better take it very –
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  He's the comptroller, the kingpin.
[55:23.000 --> 55:24.000]  Absolutely.
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  This isn't some low level.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  This is like the guy that saw the BS.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  Absolutely.
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.000]  He saw it.
[55:29.000 --> 55:30.000]  He pointed it out.
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  He pointed it out to the highest level in the CDC.
[55:32.000 --> 55:36.000]  And instead of being acted upon, he was disciplined instead.
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.000]  So that is –
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  As you were.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  Exactly.
[55:39.000 --> 55:44.000]  That seems to be the modus operandi if you come forward with concerns about vaccine safety.
[55:44.000 --> 55:49.000]  How dare you not want to have millions of brain damaged children on your hands?
[55:49.000 --> 55:55.000]  And it's even more insidious than that, Alex, because what he found, as the alternative
[55:55.000 --> 56:02.000]  media have reported, is that the effect was driven by a very high risk in black boys.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  Why that was, we don't know.
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.000]  Why particularly black boys, is that a genetic component to the risk we don't know.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  But I said to him, what do these data say?
[56:11.000 --> 56:16.000]  Do they – are they telling us that actually, MMR vaccine is a risk for autism per se,
[56:16.000 --> 56:23.000]  and that younger age of exposure is a particular risk in the African American male population?
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  He said, absolutely.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  Well, I've seen the studies on fluoride.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  It hits black males more.
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  What's the difference between boys and girls?
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.000]  I mean, medical doctors always tell me girls are tougher than boys.
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  Not physically in a fist fight, but just blood, brain barrier.
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  Yeah, they're tougher in many ways.
[56:39.000 --> 56:44.000]  I mean, the infant mortality in girls, historically, from infectious disease, was lower than boys.
[56:44.000 --> 56:47.000]  Boys, maybe their immune system developed later.
[56:47.000 --> 56:50.000]  There is clearly an effect of hormones.
[56:50.000 --> 56:55.000]  If you look at the work of Boyd Haley, and you put neurons in culture and add thimerosal,
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  then it kills them.
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.000]  If you add thimerosal and testosterone, it kills them at a much higher rate.
[57:00.000 --> 57:06.000]  So there's some kind of chemical interaction between these things that may enhance the risk to boys.
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.000]  Even when I've read males of the supercharged version of Homo sapien,
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.000]  almost a derivative of females, if you get into the deeper science,
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  that's why we can't handle these insults.
[57:16.000 --> 57:20.000]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  This is concerning everyone.
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  Our children are in trouble.
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  Millions of children are diagnosed in the U.S. alone every year with autism.
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  It's a crisis.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  We have the answers.
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.000]  We know, from whistleblowers, 360 degrees there's a cover-up.
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.000]  And now a key man at a comptroller level,
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  witnessing the statistics being manipulated has gone public,
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  and you've heard nothing about it.
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  Tell your friends and family to tune in right now.
[57:45.000 --> 58:11.000]  The answer on vaccine safety straight ahead.

[58:20.000 --> 58:22.000]  Tell folks how you got introduced to supermale,
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  and then when superfemale came out, tell us what happened.
[58:24.000 --> 58:29.000]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[58:29.000 --> 58:30.000]  Talk about the effects.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[58:34.000 --> 58:35.000]  I feel like I look better.
[58:35.000 --> 58:36.000]  I feel better.
[58:36.000 --> 58:37.000]  I feel sexier.
[58:37.000 --> 58:38.000]  I love it.
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  Even if you don't believe in supplements,

[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  This is Life Changing.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  This is Life Changing.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  Historically, things seem to come in cascades.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Moral happened in a month that happens in five years.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  I think we're reaching a tipping point right now
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  with the public, with everybody, about vaccines.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  I think the problem is that it's self-fulfilling.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  There are so many damaged children out there with parents saying the same things.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  They weren't anti-vaccine.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  They took their children to be vaccinated along to the doctor,
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  and they tell the same story, regression after immunization,
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  asthma after immunization, allergies after immunization,
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  insulin-dependent...
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  Every fit I know says don't give dogs all the shots.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  It causes their allergies.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  The events have been on to this for much, much longer
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  than mainstream medicine has.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  They stopped giving thimerosol in vaccines many, many years
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  before it was taken out of the majority of childhood immunizations.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  It's still in the influenza vaccine.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  It's still in the vaccine given to pregnant women and to infants of...
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  I'm not a medical doctor.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  I know Mercury's not good.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  And you eject it right in the blood, it goes in the brain?
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  That's right.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  It is a highly toxic substance.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  It had never had any right being in there.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  It's never been tested for safety.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  It was grandfathered in, and it is extremely dangerous.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  How can my water supply not have one part per 5 million of arsenic or mercury,
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  but they can put it in the shot?
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  It is quite alarming.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  And I think one of the concerns is that if you took it out of all of them
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  and you suddenly saw a pacifist fall in autism rates,
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  then you'd have your answer.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  And I think it's very cynical to suggest it, but over the years,
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  I cannot understand any other reason why you would take it out of the other vaccines
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  and then put it straight back in the influenza vaccine.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  I remember in 2004 reading the ABC news articles and others
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  about where they had that meeting, that conference with the CDC leaders
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  saying, we know what's doing and we've got to cover it up.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  Why wouldn't you just say, we didn't know, expose it, and then it would be not one-tenth the problem of covering it up.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  Once you actively cover it up, you become an accomplice.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  I mean, if I was told this is brain damage in kids, I'd go public even if it destroyed me.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  I just don't get how they think they're going to cover it up,
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  because as you said, the damage just continues.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  It's going to be like Nuremberg trials.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  These people are in deep crap.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  You're right.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  There's a pattern of recidivism in the CDC when they find a signal that they don't like.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  They get into a room and they make that signal go away.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  And that's exactly what they did at the Simpson Wood meeting with Thimerosol.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  They had a very high risk which they whittled down and whittled down and whittled down
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  until they came out of that room and said, there's no risk at all.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  Yes, there was a risk.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  So we see this same pattern of behavior.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  And Dr. Thompson said this to Brian Hooker in a telephone conversation.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  They go into a room and they get rid of the effect.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  They cannot go out there and publicly say vaccines aren't safe.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  They are putting kids in front of a firing squad.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  How do they rationalize that?
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  I just, I just, I mean, I get sad.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  Do you get sad when you see little kids period or a pregnant woman and want to warn them?
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  Because I just do it everywhere.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  It's my family sick of it.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  Yeah, I say go and get informed.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  Read all the information.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  If you're going to read the CDC's website, go and read the NBIC website as well.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  And you'll get the counterpoint.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  You'll get the information.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  But there is no excuse nowadays not to be fully informed.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  All I know is I take my children to movies.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  And I mean, it's like 10%, 20% is autistic kids.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  You see them when you come in.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  They're yelling to the movie.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  That wasn't the movies 20 years ago.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  I mean, it's like, I go to restaurants.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  I see kids that are just obviously totally brain damaged.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  I mean, it's just, I can just see like, it's like, it's like we had a huge war.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  And there's all these wounded men with their arms and legs blown off.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  It's kids, Dr. Wakefield.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  It's like, I can just see the damage everywhere.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sown American made jeans.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  David Hall, Diamond Gusset jean company.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  Just won't quit.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  Hitler took the guns.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  Stalin took the guns.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  Mal took the guns.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  But El Castro took the guns.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  You know Chavez took the guns.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  We're into the second hour on this live Sunday, September 7th worldwide transmission.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  I cannot think of a more epic.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  I mean, I'm using that word four or five times today.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  Show them what's happening right now.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  We have from 2004, the CDC documents.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  We've shown them on screen for TV viewers where the director of it said in meetings,
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  I wouldn't give my grandson this.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  It's horrible.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  We've got to cover it up.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  Autism from the mercury, the femorisol.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  We've got all these scientists coming out.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  We've got a new whistleblower who was basically the head of the study saying the CDC covered
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  up data showing vaccine autism link.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  That's time.com.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  Time magazine.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  We have another ruling Friday saying lawsuits go ahead by whistleblowers exposing that they
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  were there and told to shut up about it causing brain damage and problems.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  I want to be clear.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  Dr. Wakefield was earlier, one of the first major whistleblowers himself in a study.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  He was attacked over it, now been vindicated.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  That we're not against the science of this learned immunity.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  Clearly, this is real.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  They've been doing vaccinations for smallpox for 500 years.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  Benjamin Franklin talked about it.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  It's that these companies are out of control.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  They have liability protection.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  We've gone from autism, 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 68.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  That's CDC's own numbers.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  There's brain damage kids everywhere.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  It's getting worse.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  They want more vaccines pushed from the public.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  Gardasil, killing all these people on the trials.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  India and Japan have banned it.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  We haven't.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  This is a scandal.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  These corporations want to mandate we take this stuff and not have to have it safe or
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  even partially safe.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  They say safe and effective.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  Wakefield, I want to play a clip here before you recap what's happened and get into how big this is.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  From 2004, when this study came out, that this top level CDC doctor is exposing.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  We're naming and go through the articles.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  Even Time Magazine is covering this now.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  Again, this is a big victory, folks.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  I'm getting goosebumps right now.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  This is so exciting because I personalize all these kids and pregnant women.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  I worry about this.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  None of my three children have been vaccinated.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  And as you said, they're as healthy as a butcher shop dog.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  I mean, they are doing well.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  I want to warn people I have good will.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  So this is a big victory.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  But here they are saying Mercury's good for a child's brain.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  When thousands of other studies say it electrochemically literally rots holes in your brain.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  Here are CBS News promoting this very study.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal, Pediatrics.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  Mercury is associated with better learning and mental performance.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  Dr. Wakefield, folks can go to your YouTube channel, Austin Media, autismmedia channel on YouTube or autismmediachannel.com.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  Break it down, recap for folks how big this is.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  A super high level whistleblower saying they knew and were ordered to cover it up.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  Thank you, Alex here.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  Let me just recap.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  So in the last two weeks, Dr. William Thompson, a senior scientist and epidemiologist statistician from the CDC has come forward under the guidance of Dr. Brian Hooker,
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  father of an autistic child and a vaccine safety researcher and disclosed 13 years of cover-up of the fact that MMR vaccine is strongly associated with autism,
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  particularly in African American boys and I should say children who have no pre-existing disorders irrespective of race.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  So this could be children without, with what's called isolated autism.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  They don't have mental retardation as judged by IQ.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  They don't have a genetic basis for it and they don't have cerebral palsy.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  And he said in the words of Dr. Thompson, this is exactly the group that you would expect to see an effect in.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  So they've been covering it up for 13 years, they knew there was a risk and one wonders how many children have been permanently neurologically injured.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  In the meantime, well, they knew that this effect was real.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  But now they're going to double down because as more whistleblowers come out, it's just happened this week with another.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  They're all going to prison if this ever comes out.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  I mean, just like five years ago, they would say, don't give a pregnant woman any vaccines.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  Now they say pregnant women need more. It's well known it causes problems with the fetus.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  So their answer is just saying, no, it's like pumpkin pie.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  There just seems to be a hitlerian commitment to this.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  There is. It's almost like a religion.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  The first thing that happens is if you question vaccine safety, then you're put in a corner and said, people say you're anti-vaccine,
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  that you clearly can't be listened to because you're not talking science.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  That's just a convenient way of dismissing.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  I wish there was a vaccine for all this different stuff.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  I want to be healthy. I want my kids to be protected from tetanus and stuff.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  I mean, just the problem is they have a huge history of tetanus shots full of problems.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  It raises another issue, Alex, and that is, is the problem, for example, with MMR because it's three viruses in one vaccine.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  If you gave them separately, would you have less of a problem?
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  And we didn't see this issue when we had the single measles vaccine.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  That's something I've always advocated, give parents the choice of single vaccines.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  And you know what happened in the UK when I suggested that.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  Six months later, they took away the choice of single vaccines.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  They got upset because it showed you were right.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  Well, they said we need to protect the vaccine policy rather than the children.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  That was the net effect of what they said.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  So we'll take away the choice of single vaccines.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  Our emphasis is not necessarily to protect children from infectious disease, but to protect our vaccine policy.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  This is a story that came from a senior member of the Department of Health.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  It's like having one glass of wine or 20.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  If you're going to do it in a cost-benefit analysis or in a risk-benefit analysis, do what's safest.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  Give one at a time. Watch it. Study it.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  No, no, no. Just give total protection. Do whatever we want.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  Now, here's the problem, Alex, is once this story comes out,
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  once public confidence in the vaccine policy makers is eroded, as it will be,
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  because Dr. William Thompson has come forward and told the story,
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  clearly mitigating everything that we've been told over the last 20 years.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  Validating everything you've said.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  Then parents are going to say, we don't trust you anymore.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  And they will vote with their feet.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  They will stop vaccinating across the board.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  And it will be the vaccine policy makers themselves and those who have indulged in what is in effect,
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  a crime, this cover-up, who will be responsible for falling vaccine uptake rates
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  and the return of infectious disease.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  But you know what?
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  It will be blamed upon Jenny McCarthy, or it will be blamed upon me,
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  or it will be blamed upon Rob Snider or someone else who has come forward
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  and said we have genuine concerns.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  Well, when you're Jenny McCarthy or somebody and you take your child in for the third round of shots,
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  they have a convulsion and can't talk anymore.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  I mean, it's clear this did it.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  It's like saying if a Mack truck runs you over, it didn't do it.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  It's just, they're so committed though.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  But how can the system defeat hundreds of millions of parents worldwide,
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  tens of millions in the U.S., millions in the U.K., millions in Germany, millions.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  How can they defeat parents who have a child that was happy and healthy after vaccines,
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  that's brain damage?
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  How do they ever think they're going to get away with this?
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  As the damage mounts, they're only going to create more opposition.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  Don't they get it's a losing battle?
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  They don't.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  I think they're beginning to now because they are losing so badly.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  They spent billions of dollars, billions of pounds on expensive public relations campaigns
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  and they are losing.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  They are losing the hearts and minds of the public.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  Why? Because it is true.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  Not because I say so, not because Jenny McCarthy says so,
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  but because they see it in their own streets.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  Their own top scientists said they were ordered to cover it up.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  That's exactly right.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  So now the whole house of cards is going to fall.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  And the other thing that came out recently on Friday,
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  I was mentioning it, that Steve Krallin, a scientist working in the MMR vaccine lab of Merck,
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  reported fraud in that laboratory overestimating the safety,
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  sorry, the effectiveness of the Mumps vaccine.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  We were seeing Mumps outbreaks all around the world in children who've had two, three doses of Mumps.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  They were being connected to the shot, right?
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  That's right.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  And what they were saying is the vaccine is not working
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  because these children are getting Mumps when they've had two or three doses.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  Stay there.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  Tell us about it in the next segment.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  Incredible.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  Let's tune in.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  This is the new form that is specifically designed to
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  nutritionally assist the natural function of healthy eyes.

[1:16:54.000 --> 1:17:03.880]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:06.780]  much get healthy and detoxify.
[1:17:06.780 --> 1:17:11.560]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:15.920]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:19.100]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[1:17:19.100 --> 1:17:24.520]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[1:17:24.520 --> 1:17:28.120]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to
[1:17:28.120 --> 1:17:34.200]  come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals, and the results that I personally have had
[1:17:34.200 --> 1:17:36.040]  have been life changing.
[1:17:36.040 --> 1:17:41.240]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:46.120]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the
[1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:49.800]  TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.

[1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:04.840]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a
[1:18:04.840 --> 1:18:05.840]  potential court situation?
[1:18:05.840 --> 1:18:09.480]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:10.480]  Here we go, folks.
[1:18:10.480 --> 1:18:11.480]  I'm being a sergeant.
[1:18:11.480 --> 1:18:15.720]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, info
[1:18:15.720 --> 1:18:17.440]  wars is the tip of the spear.
[1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:21.200]  Is this another false flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeland
[1:18:21.200 --> 1:18:23.800]  security by sticking the hands down on the pants on the streets?
[1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:28.080]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere, and that's what
[1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:30.800]  prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:37.240]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against
[1:18:37.240 --> 1:18:39.120]  the so-called rebels.
[1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:42.560]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth.
[1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:48.200]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv

[1:19:29.680 --> 1:19:33.360]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:37.720]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[1:19:37.720 --> 1:19:39.720]  Can you put two and two together?
[1:19:39.720 --> 1:19:45.320]  Infidel body armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[1:19:45.320 --> 1:19:47.320]  priced and fully legal.

[1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:28.800]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:35.760]  Now investigative journalist John Rappaport, who's been all over this for decades, is going
[1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:39.280]  to be joining us coming up in the next two segments, but I've got all this world news
[1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:40.280]  to cover.
[1:20:40.280 --> 1:20:46.200]  It's all incredibly important and interesting, but we know that the vaccines are causing
[1:20:46.200 --> 1:20:51.040]  autoimmune disorders, causing problems in the guts of children.
[1:20:51.040 --> 1:20:57.560]  We know the sock vaccine was declassified, had an SV-40 cancer virus in it, and these
[1:20:57.560 --> 1:21:00.280]  companies have liability protection.
[1:21:00.280 --> 1:21:02.960]  Vaccines are extremely dangerous.
[1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:03.960]  They're extremely complex.
[1:21:03.960 --> 1:21:05.840]  It's not like a drug.
[1:21:05.840 --> 1:21:09.560]  We're going to get some heart medicine or Rogaine for your hair falling out.
[1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:11.520]  This is DNA, RNA.
[1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:17.680]  This is very complex manipulations, and they grow this stuff in these big tanks and don't
[1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:19.240]  clean them out properly.
[1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:21.960]  There's all sorts of issues.
[1:21:21.960 --> 1:21:25.960]  You know I've documented, a lot of this is on purpose, but Dr. Andrew Wegfield's our
[1:21:25.960 --> 1:21:26.960]  guest.
[1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:30.520]  Sir, we've got the investigative journalist joining us to bring up some questions and
[1:21:30.520 --> 1:21:35.720]  comments with you, but continuing with the new info, more whistleblowers coming out,
[1:21:35.720 --> 1:21:38.680]  not just this top scientist, but more.
[1:21:38.680 --> 1:21:42.560]  Where do you expect the establishment to go from here, as their whole house of cards
[1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:43.560]  collapses?
[1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:44.560]  Well, it's very interesting.
[1:21:44.560 --> 1:21:46.680]  Steve Kriling came forward from Merck nine years ago.
[1:21:46.680 --> 1:21:51.640]  I think he approached me at a meeting in Chicago back then with some extraordinary information
[1:21:51.640 --> 1:21:58.320]  about manipulation of data in Merck's vaccine lab to falsely elevate the protective efficacy
[1:21:58.320 --> 1:21:59.320]  of their vaccine.
[1:21:59.320 --> 1:22:03.440]  And these are people that lose their jobs, risk their jobs, their lives because they're
[1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:05.480]  not psychotic killers.
[1:22:05.480 --> 1:22:07.400]  They understand, hey, we're hurting people.
[1:22:07.400 --> 1:22:08.880]  We better talk about it.
[1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:10.960]  These are heroes for doing the right thing.
[1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:11.960]  That's right.
[1:22:11.960 --> 1:22:13.480]  So their mom's vaccine was not working.
[1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:17.800]  We were seeing outbreaks of mumps in highly vaccinated populations around the world.
[1:22:17.800 --> 1:22:22.040]  And so they were told by the FDA, either you prove what it says on your product insert,
[1:22:22.040 --> 1:22:24.760]  96% protection, or you lose your license.
[1:22:24.760 --> 1:22:27.200]  Now you lose a license for mumps.
[1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:30.880]  You lose the license for MMR and Merck have got a monopoly in this country and that's
[1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:31.880]  a lot of money.
[1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:36.720]  So they set about trying to fix the test, not the vaccine.
[1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:37.720]  They had two options.
[1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:40.760]  They could act in the children's interests or they could act in Merck's interests.
[1:22:40.760 --> 1:22:45.640]  And what they did apparently is to act in Merck's interests and fix the test.
[1:22:45.640 --> 1:22:48.720]  So what they did to the test is to add rabbit's blood to it.
[1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:49.720]  Unbelievable.
[1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:50.720]  Rabbit's blood.
[1:22:50.720 --> 1:22:54.720]  Absolutely nothing to do with the ability of the mumps vaccine to protect children,
[1:22:54.720 --> 1:22:55.720]  but add rabbit's blood.
[1:22:55.720 --> 1:22:57.360]  Is that because the rabbits have an immunity?
[1:22:57.360 --> 1:23:03.400]  No, it's because it falsely elevates the protection of the apparent protection of the
[1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:04.400]  vaccine.
[1:23:04.400 --> 1:23:05.400]  They're doing it at all.
[1:23:05.400 --> 1:23:06.400]  It's an artifact.
[1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:07.400]  It's a lab effect.
[1:23:07.400 --> 1:23:09.240]  It's nothing to do with immunity at all.
[1:23:09.240 --> 1:23:11.960]  So when they did that, it worked.
[1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:12.960]  But what they did...
[1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:13.960]  So they engaged in fraud?
[1:23:13.960 --> 1:23:14.960]  They engaged in fraud.
[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:16.600]  They asked him to fix his data.
[1:23:16.600 --> 1:23:20.720]  They asked him to cross out what he written before, write some new numbers which convinced
[1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:23.120]  the FDA that the vaccine was right.
[1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:24.640]  He took them to a whistleblower court.
[1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:29.840]  He filed a case, took it to court and the good news is that Merck, having tried to have
[1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:34.920]  it thrown out of court, have just on Friday lost that case and it will proceed to trial.
[1:23:34.920 --> 1:23:40.480]  And so for everybody that is very, very good news because what it will eventually do is
[1:23:40.480 --> 1:23:46.320]  bring out the truth about the efficacy and safety of that vaccine and I believe lead
[1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:50.080]  to the demise of the MMR vaccine as it currently is.
[1:23:50.080 --> 1:23:53.600]  That is not that it will get rid of single vaccine.
[1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:57.440]  Maybe we should go back to single vaccines because they're protective, but mumps vaccine
[1:23:57.440 --> 1:23:58.440]  was never needed.
[1:23:58.440 --> 1:23:59.440]  And this is the important point.
[1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:03.760]  This comes not from me, but from Donald Henderson, who was head of the smallpox eradication
[1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:05.840]  program at the CDC.
[1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:06.840]  He said it wasn't needed.
[1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:08.480]  They did a study when it first was introduced.
[1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:13.200]  They said we don't need this vaccine and it solely appeared on down here's the fascinating.
[1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:16.160]  I'll tell you a story about this.
[1:24:16.160 --> 1:24:17.160]  They did a study.
[1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:18.160]  The vaccine wasn't needed.
[1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:21.280]  They said to Morris Hillerman of Merck, we don't need this.
[1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:26.080]  So he went state by state by state persuading health officials to introduce it.
[1:24:26.080 --> 1:24:32.000]  In the end, so many states were using it that the CDC said in Donald Henderson's words,
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.560]  oh, to hell with it.
[1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:36.560]  We might as well put it on the schedule.
[1:24:36.560 --> 1:24:41.920]  That's the scientific basis for the use of mandatory mumps vaccination in this country.
[1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:46.200]  From the man himself, Dr. Donald Henderson, oh, to hell with it.
[1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:53.160]  But I even see mainstream articles in the Sacramento B where they admit that they have
[1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:56.320]  outbreaks in California caused by the vaccines.
[1:24:56.320 --> 1:24:59.000]  I mean, more and more, they can't cover this stuff up.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  And I just wonder what's going on in this industry because I know you can get immunity
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  from vaccines.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:06.520]  I know there's a real science there.
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:07.880]  Why is it so screwed up?
[1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:09.440]  Why is it so bad?
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:11.760]  Why is it causing so many problems?
[1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:14.120]  Is it just the arrogance of the industry?
[1:25:14.120 --> 1:25:17.000]  Just that there's nothing there, no checks and balances?
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:21.120]  There are very few checks and balances and there is a great deal of profit to be made
[1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:24.040]  as you point out without any liability at all.
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:28.960]  There is a very interesting phenomenon rather like the antibiotic resistant bacteria is
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:35.200]  we're seeing this now emerging vaccine technology that we're getting bacteria, potassium, for
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:38.360]  example, that is resistant to the current vaccine in use.
[1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:43.680]  Now, what that means is that we see these escape mutants, these mutants that are then
[1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:45.920]  resistant to the current vaccine.
[1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:50.280]  So they will introduce a new vaccine that deals at least temporarily with that escape
[1:25:50.280 --> 1:25:51.280]  mutant.
[1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:52.280]  It causes another super mutant.
[1:25:52.280 --> 1:25:57.680]  Well, this is the problem is that it's a, you're on a treadmill for the rest of time
[1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:03.680]  because not only will children have to have the existing potassium vaccine, but they will
[1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:05.160]  also have to have the new one.
[1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:06.520]  So it's Pandora's box.
[1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:07.520]  Yes.
[1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:10.000]  I think people didn't think through this and they didn't think through it with antibiotics
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:14.080]  and they didn't think through it with vaccines, but we're starting to see the emergence of
[1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:17.520]  these super strains now and we need to be very, very careful.
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:18.520]  We need to think very carefully.
[1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:23.920]  Unless you want to just medicalize life itself without Merck and without, you know, all these
[1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:30.520]  other companies, you just Pfizer, you just can't live, you got to have any daily shots.
[1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:36.760]  I mean, what about the connections I've seen in studies to all the incredible problems
[1:26:36.760 --> 1:26:40.040]  we're seeing with allergies connected to vaccines?
[1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:45.760]  Well, I, there's no doubt that there has been an explosion of immune mediated diseases
[1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:47.080]  in children in particular.
[1:26:47.080 --> 1:26:54.080]  So there is chronic morbidity in this country from immune diseases such as asthma, eczema,
[1:26:54.080 --> 1:26:59.640]  hay fever, Crohn's disease, you know, inflammatory bowel disease, directly linked to insulin
[1:26:59.640 --> 1:27:03.200]  dependent diabetes, this kind of thing, unprecedented levels.
[1:27:03.200 --> 1:27:06.200]  Now, these are immune mediated diseases.
[1:27:06.200 --> 1:27:11.120]  So if you're looking for the cause of these issues, you need to look at the things that
[1:27:11.120 --> 1:27:13.920]  educate the immune system very, very early on.
[1:27:13.920 --> 1:27:16.800]  Now, historically, that was infection.
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:19.120]  Now that's been superseded by vaccination.
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:21.320]  So it makes a great deal of sense.
[1:27:21.320 --> 1:27:26.000]  There is biological plausibility to looking at vaccines as a possible course and there's
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:28.800]  an abundance of literature which supports that.
[1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:29.800]  Well, we talk privately.
[1:27:29.800 --> 1:27:33.640]  I work for a small animal vet and a large animal vet in high school and to college.
[1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:36.080]  I work overall four years total.
[1:27:36.080 --> 1:27:40.520]  They knew then, tell people, don't give your kids, you know, vaccines.
[1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:42.920]  We don't give them to the dogs or they get sick.
[1:27:42.920 --> 1:27:45.520]  It's the vets you were saying earlier that are really aware of this.
[1:27:45.520 --> 1:27:47.400]  Yeah, the vets have been on to it for a long time.
[1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:52.880]  No multiple vaccines, spread them out, get them out of vaccines and don't vaccinate if
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:53.880]  it's unnecessary.
[1:27:53.880 --> 1:27:54.880]  This isn't just some-
[1:27:54.880 --> 1:27:58.680]  Because they could see it in something with a shorter life cycle.
[1:27:58.680 --> 1:28:00.400]  They could see it in a dog or a cat.
[1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:01.400]  Yeah.
[1:28:01.400 --> 1:28:07.280]  And because there's less of a pressure on them from public health officials and the pharmaceutical
[1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:12.360]  industry reps who visit and bribe, that there's less pressure on them to keep giving these
[1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:13.360]  vaccines.
[1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:17.920]  And it's become so much of an industry now in pediatrics and mainstream medicine that
[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:24.400]  it's all, it's insidious and it is pervasive and it's something we've got to stand back
[1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:27.320]  from and take very, very seriously.
[1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:32.720]  Austin Media Channel, I keep saying Austin as we're in Austin, Autism Media Channel on
[1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:41.560]  YouTube, AutismMediaChannel.com is the website, but the best place is YouTube, Autism Media
[1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:46.720]  Channel on YouTube, Dr. Andrew Wakefield is our guest, investigative journalist is joining
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:53.200]  us, John Rappaport, straight ahead, but we'll also talk about the persecution of whistleblowers
[1:28:53.200 --> 1:28:57.640]  that try to tell the truth, but what happens when more more whistleblowers come out?
[1:28:57.640 --> 1:29:00.480]  The system collapses.
[1:29:00.480 --> 1:29:04.040]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:06.920]  much get healthy and detoxified.
[1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:11.040]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[1:29:11.040 --> 1:29:16.040]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:19.240]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[1:29:19.240 --> 1:29:24.600]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:28.480]  Then about a year ago he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come
[1:29:28.480 --> 1:29:34.520]  out with rare earth, deep earth crystals and the results that I personally have had have
[1:29:34.520 --> 1:29:36.520]  been life changing.
[1:29:36.520 --> 1:29:42.360]  What else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen, this is innovating
[1:29:42.360 --> 1:29:47.320]  and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media

[1:30:00.080 --> 1:30:05.440]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[1:30:05.440 --> 1:30:09.520]  toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[1:30:09.520 --> 1:30:13.560]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[1:30:13.560 --> 1:30:18.960]  than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:19.960]  within their homes.
[1:30:19.960 --> 1:30:24.480]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States, well over a thousand types
[1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:29.520]  of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans
[1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:31.480]  live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[1:30:31.480 --> 1:30:36.000]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:41.040]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight

[1:34:30.280 --> 1:34:36.480]  did a study you showed the gut brain connection they came after you they put a hoax out saying
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:41.200]  you were a liar you sued them that's in court right now I mean they may sue me saying the
[1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:46.560]  sky and blue tomorrow at high noon I mean it's just incredible how many whistleblowers
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:51.360]  like I said the NSA is not spying on you now it's all admitted or we don't fund al-qaeda
[1:34:51.360 --> 1:34:56.640]  now it's all admitted or the border is not wide open now it's all admitted they teach
[1:34:56.640 --> 1:35:02.080]  in public school in this country two plus two equal equals five well no it equals four
[1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:09.640]  I agree with you there's a major reckoning coming other points about the political response
[1:35:09.640 --> 1:35:15.680]  to this what we do now as more whistleblowers in the CDC go public saying we were ordered
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:20.480]  to cover up this is causing autism I think that's going to happen Alex I think that
[1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:26.160]  as now Dr. Thompson's come out now he's admitted in a release from his lawyer that they did
[1:35:26.160 --> 1:35:30.920]  in fact hide significant findings and change their protocol to effectively get rid of those
[1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:35.240]  findings that we're going to see more and more people coming forward and saying I was
[1:35:35.240 --> 1:35:39.880]  told to do this as part of that corporate infrastructure you know it's not my fault
[1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:43.440]  it's his fault it's their fault they told me what to do we're going to see more and
[1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:48.680]  more of that so they can't put any more fingers in the dam and stop it leaking it is really
[1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:54.440]  coming apart so what needs to happen hit the several things that used to happen pediatrics
[1:35:54.440 --> 1:36:00.200]  the journal that published this fraudulent paper in 2004 need to retract that paper normally
[1:36:00.200 --> 1:36:04.760]  they would respond immediately because I watch the news every day right this would normally
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:11.040]  be a huge scandal they would respond deny defend nothing yeah the silence tells a lot
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:14.360]  yeah and they were caught with their pants down basically they did not see this coming
[1:36:14.360 --> 1:36:20.240]  and now they're scrambling and they're contradicting themselves they're furthering the lies and
[1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:25.960]  Cheryl Atkinson of CBS reporter ex-CBS reporter Emmy winning investigative journalist absolutely
[1:36:25.960 --> 1:36:31.040]  outstanding job amazing on this picking it apart and finding out where the weak points
[1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:36.360]  are and that's the great news all these serious journalists from the mainstream are leaving
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:40.280]  so they can tell the truth yeah where she was restricted from doing that in her own
[1:36:40.280 --> 1:36:44.920]  words while working at CBS she can now get out there and tell the story that needs to
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:49.760]  be told so what needs to happen that paper needs to be retracted from pediatrics the
[1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:54.440]  journal the editor at this at the moment is resisting that he says that he's been in
[1:36:54.440 --> 1:36:59.000]  touch with the authors and they said oh no it's okay so she said to him have you been
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:06.320]  in touch with dr. Thompson silence she repeated in writing so the fact that you're satisfied
[1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:10.920]  with this means that you've been in touch with dr. Thompson and he's okayed it silence
[1:37:10.920 --> 1:37:15.560]  no they have not been in touch with dr. Thompson and in fact haven't been in the last 10 years
[1:37:15.560 --> 1:37:19.000]  they have not gone to the heart of the matter they've not talked to the man who had his finger
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:24.680]  on the numbers the CDC statistician just just ignore that yeah they so they've ignored him
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:29.960]  what we need to do now is to have dr. Thompson himself retract his name from that paper and
[1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:36.280]  then it cannot stand we need a political response we need people to help but is not the silence
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:41.200]  they're not even attacking show how weak they are yeah I think they're scrambling for you
[1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:45.760]  know for all kinds of excuses for what he meant what he said what actually it means
[1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:49.960]  but for me mainly it's silence as you say there's a radio silence on this because they
[1:37:49.960 --> 1:37:53.640]  don't know quite how to deal with it but as you said the truth is there's an army of
[1:37:53.640 --> 1:37:59.480]  brain damaged children and parents that are angry out there there's a law of numbers and
[1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:04.200]  just of everything shows they will end up being brought to justice yeah I think there
[1:38:04.200 --> 1:38:08.960]  was a University of Chicago study that asked the question of parents do you believe that
[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:13.960]  doctors know that vaccines cause autism and are involved in a cover-up 20% just said right
[1:38:13.960 --> 1:38:20.120]  out of the gate yes they do the important number Alex is 36% said don't know in other
[1:38:20.120 --> 1:38:25.080]  words they haven't bought in to the propaganda they haven't bought in to what's being put
[1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:29.880]  out there by mainstream media they don't know and these are the thinking reading talking
[1:38:29.880 --> 1:38:37.040]  parents the educated parents who are questioning this and what will happen now I believe is
[1:38:37.040 --> 1:38:44.120]  that 36% or a major part of it will say wow these guys were right all along there's a
[1:38:44.120 --> 1:38:48.920]  problem and so we're going to see a huge shift yeah in people's belief systems I want to
[1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:52.360]  John Rabaport and get his questions and comments in your take on the doctor Wakefield but I'm
[1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:57.440]  going to say this again people think a quarterback that throws a touchdowns a hero or some guy
[1:38:57.440 --> 1:39:02.240]  that paints a beautiful painting whatever people that tell the truth put their careers
[1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:09.040]  on the line and stand up for human justice and liberty are my heroes you are a hero thank
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:13.160]  you so much for you've done to humanity I just am almost speechless even be here with
[1:39:13.160 --> 1:39:17.160]  you and to see you vindicated like this it just gives me faith in humanity we're going
[1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:20.960]  to turn the corner on this and hopefully save these children out there that are being lined
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:26.040]  up and given this this this concoction that these companies come up with so thank you
[1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:30.320]  Dr. Wakefield actually very kind I'm just a guy doing a job and no I know you're keeping
[1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:34.880]  your soul doing the right thing but it's just that in a world of universal deceit telling
[1:39:34.880 --> 1:39:39.560]  the truth is a revolutionary act to quote George Arwell well I put my faith in the parents
[1:39:39.560 --> 1:39:43.960]  story they know what happened to their child they weren't anti-vaccine they saw it happen
[1:39:43.960 --> 1:39:48.680]  and I trust their instincts they yeah like the rattlesnake bit me and I got sick it just
[1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:53.120]  I took the shot I got sick you get that five thousand times something's going on something's
[1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:59.560]  the truck ran over me and I had broken bones I jumped off the cliff and broke my legs I
[1:39:59.560 --> 1:40:03.640]  I smoked cigarettes and got lung cancer I mean at a certain point there's a causal connection
[1:40:03.640 --> 1:40:07.760]  here yeah we're going to break in about three four minutes but I want to bring John Revaport
[1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:12.960]  in and for the next segment John this has been an incredible broadcast tonight I'm getting
[1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:17.240]  all these tweets and comments people calling me this is really touching people's soul thank
[1:40:17.240 --> 1:40:21.520]  God what do you think as an investigative journalist who for two decades has been trying
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:29.080]  to expose this well we got an opportunity here Alex this is a big time opportunity we've
[1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:36.760]  got a whistleblower from the inside who's gone on the record written statement defrauding
[1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:45.120]  the public concealing the truth hiding the connection between the MMR vaccine and autism
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:51.160]  right out there in the open we broke the protocol we omitted vital data so now this guy Thompson
[1:40:51.160 --> 1:40:57.960]  has opened the door to other whistleblowers who could come forward and the it's really
[1:40:57.960 --> 1:41:03.720]  going to be the online journalists that who are going to provide cover and protection
[1:41:03.720 --> 1:41:08.560]  for these people it's not to major media because we're looking at a blackout there completely
[1:41:08.560 --> 1:41:12.800]  they're hoping the whole thing goes away I mean they're talking major media people are
[1:41:12.800 --> 1:41:17.440]  talking with the CDC they've been talking with the CDC what do we do what do you want
[1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:22.240]  us to do how should we respond well we'll just stay stay silent don't say anything because
[1:41:22.240 --> 1:41:27.280]  hopefully this whole thing will blow over Thompson will not talk to reporters as he said he was
[1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:33.440]  not going to and eventually you know we'll have 16 new scandals and stories and other
[1:41:33.440 --> 1:41:39.600]  areas and people forget all about this well that's not going to happen so it's up to us
[1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:45.040]  people who write online to keep this story alive and to provide protection and cover
[1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:50.720]  for future whistleblowers who are thinking now well maybe it's time I come out to and
[1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:57.080]  say mercury causes autism you know we've all known it for the last 20 years and I'm stepping
[1:41:57.080 --> 1:42:02.200]  forward to say that all those studies were frauds too you know which they were that's
[1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:06.560]  right I pointed this out in writing I mean this is no secret you don't even have to find
[1:42:06.560 --> 1:42:11.320]  omitted date all you have to do is look at the way these studies were constructed like
[1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:16.200]  those famous for Stratton study that was you know published three different ways before
[1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:22.040]  they finally completely scrubbed out any connection between mercury and autism it's like the aspartame
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:25.880]  study it was killing the monkeys they gave it to us so they just took the ones that lived
[1:42:25.880 --> 1:42:30.280]  and excised the ones that died I mean it's a total joke here's the deal we got brain
[1:42:30.280 --> 1:42:35.840]  damaged kids coming out of our ears here we better face this and deal with it so more
[1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:42.920]  kids don't get hurt we all of us have a responsibility that the truth is if they can't abort a kid
[1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:46.240]  before they're born they want to abort them after they're born that's the eugenics angle
[1:42:46.240 --> 1:42:50.160]  that's the big sick end of this and that's why this is happening we'll be back with
[1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:57.520]  John Bradford and Dr. Andrew Wakefield check out the YouTube channel autism media channel

[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:12.360]  gonna fix them dr andrew wakefield is here with me final segment john right before investigative
[1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:17.680]  journals no more fake news dot com info wars dot com and prison planet dot com are the
[1:48:17.680 --> 1:48:24.400]  big mothership websites we'll be back tomorrow lord willing 11am central live they've given
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:29.240]  anthrax shots the troops that killed a bunch of them mainstream news they stopped those
[1:48:29.240 --> 1:48:36.240]  smallpox shots uh cancer viruses and polio vaccines i mean this is all part of the medical
[1:48:36.240 --> 1:48:43.000]  history so we don't have to just sit here passively and go along with this when the
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:48.320]  media says every year it's the law take shots to go to school it's not that we're even against
[1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:53.880]  the vaccines it's that the way it's being done is a nightmare the answer is why is it
[1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:59.120]  being covered up dr wakefield you had one other point to make before john rapaport continued
[1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:03.680]  with how big an issue this is that more and more whistleblowers that are senior coming
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:08.600]  out saying we were ordered to cover this up this is huge you had a point about the federal
[1:49:08.600 --> 1:49:13.080]  response what that should be i think the first thing to say is that the problem is not the
[1:49:13.080 --> 1:49:17.200]  vaccines as you point out it's the vaccine policy makers and it's that that's what this
[1:49:17.200 --> 1:49:21.520]  whistleblower episode has taught us it's the policy makers who are causing the problems
[1:49:21.520 --> 1:49:26.920]  what we have to have now is oversight and we'll be releasing a video next week where
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:32.160]  the whistleblower himself urges congress to take action he demands that congress take
[1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:37.600]  this by the horns and sort it out they can have a congressional hearing of the oversight
[1:49:37.600 --> 1:49:43.840]  committee within a week of finding a few vials of old smallpox in a cupboard at the fda why
[1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:49.960]  can't they this is so so much more important so much more serious has so many more implications
[1:49:49.960 --> 1:49:54.000]  how many people out there gonna have a grandson or granddaughter that ends up getting brain
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:57.880]  damage they're at your house one week here and a half old happy next week they're in
[1:49:57.880 --> 1:50:03.520]  diapers for us their life don't ignore this this is the big issue this is the scourge
[1:50:03.520 --> 1:50:08.720]  john rapaport investigative journalist what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole why is the
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:14.000]  system covering this up can they get away with it or do they know that once this comes
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:20.720]  out their whole house of cards will fall oh they know alex i mean this is the cornerstone
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:28.440]  this is the fall back position vaccines this is the great you know cure all this is where
[1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:34.680]  doctors can point to oh well we you know we ended so much disease through vaccines and
[1:50:34.680 --> 1:50:39.280]  so forth and the evidence is there that vaccines had nothing to do with that what had to do
[1:50:39.280 --> 1:50:44.760]  with that is better nutrition better sanitation the rise of the middle class exactly i've
[1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:48.800]  seen those graphs from australia to the us until the thirties and forties it's going
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:54.000]  down infectious disease because of better hygiene then vaccines come come in it actually
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:51:00.400]  goes up a little but not compared to what it was yeah i mean it's ridiculous so their
[1:51:00.400 --> 1:51:09.520]  entire operation across the board as the medical cartel is wobbling on this issue of vaccines
[1:51:09.520 --> 1:51:15.720]  and if they admit more than just a temporary you know lack of attention to something in
[1:51:15.720 --> 1:51:20.040]  a particular study i mean if they were to come out and tell the whole story the whole
[1:51:20.040 --> 1:51:25.720]  house of cards would collapse so they have to do everything in their power to protect
[1:51:25.720 --> 1:51:32.560]  against that happening and now we have a window of opportunity which we must not let pass
[1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:39.160]  to expose the entire show to expose all of it the chemicals in the vaccines the live
[1:51:39.160 --> 1:51:44.880]  germs in the vaccines the germs that were put into the vaccines that didn't belong
[1:51:44.880 --> 1:51:51.280]  there the fungus the viral simulants the i mean just it's a nightmare you know it's
[1:51:51.280 --> 1:51:56.840]  like a doctor is saying to a mother okay so your your child is going to be born and then
[1:51:56.840 --> 1:52:00.760]  in the first day of birth here's what we're going to do we're going to inject your baby
[1:52:00.760 --> 1:52:06.720]  with toxic chemicals including mercury or possibly aluminum and then we're also going
[1:52:06.720 --> 1:52:10.600]  to put germs in there and then there will be other germs that got in there you know
[1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:16.760]  somehow and then dad hepatitis as if your your child's not having sex or using drugs
[1:52:16.760 --> 1:52:21.600]  why does it need a hepatitis shot all right so they say and so expectant mother this is
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:27.080]  what we're going to do is this okay with you i mean any same mother if it were put that
[1:52:27.080 --> 1:52:32.240]  way to her would say you're not going to do that by any stretch of the imagination you're
[1:52:32.240 --> 1:52:37.320]  not even going to get close to my kid but it's all couched in this very academic sort
[1:52:37.320 --> 1:52:42.360]  of language we know through thousands of studies that not only are these things safe
[1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:47.440]  but they they're marvels and wonders of the world that prevent disease this is all complete
[1:52:47.440 --> 1:52:54.920]  bologna and the mothers of autistic children know this they know there is no way to contradict
[1:52:54.920 --> 1:52:59.680]  them they were there they and i want something so my kids don't get sick but when it has
[1:52:59.680 --> 1:53:04.680]  such a horrible track record like garter cell that killed all the people in the trials and
[1:53:04.680 --> 1:53:09.200]  cause autoimmune disorders and is banned in japan and india and then now they want to
[1:53:09.200 --> 1:53:14.560]  give it to boys there just seems to be such an arrogance doctor wakefield where does your
[1:53:14.560 --> 1:53:20.240]  gut tell you all of this ends as the as the vaccine damage mounts as the autism numbers
[1:53:20.240 --> 1:53:25.200]  climb is there going to be nuremberg trials for these people down the road although we
[1:53:25.200 --> 1:53:29.360]  have two options now we've reached a major crossroads and dr. thompson has given us
[1:53:29.360 --> 1:53:33.520]  an opportunity but if we do nothing if you carry on and you look at the cdc's numbers
[1:53:33.520 --> 1:53:37.360]  it's one in sixty eight now then for a child born today it's going to be one in twenty
[1:53:37.360 --> 1:53:41.520]  five and in twenty twenty five it's going to be one in two children good god a serious
[1:53:41.520 --> 1:53:46.200]  neurological problem those are the cdc's own numbers so half the public basically with
[1:53:46.200 --> 1:53:51.400]  neurological disorders sacrificed on the altar of mds and the vaccines and here's the problem
[1:53:51.400 --> 1:53:56.080]  alex natured medicine gives us the thin end of the wedge to begin with the leading edges
[1:53:56.080 --> 1:54:01.120]  autism it's so overt it's so obvious that we pick it up first if you are just shaving
[1:54:01.120 --> 1:54:05.680]  nine points off a boy's iq how long will it take you to pick that up twenty years in the
[1:54:05.680 --> 1:54:10.680]  case of lead poisoning so are we seeing a much more pervasive problem with boys failing
[1:54:10.680 --> 1:54:14.960]  in school boys failing in university they're dropping out there on richard's their blood
[1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:18.960]  brain barrier is not as strong as a woman's yeah well for many many reasons that we don't
[1:54:18.960 --> 1:54:24.800]  understand but the point is this is likely to be for sound biological reasons are much
[1:54:24.800 --> 1:54:30.280]  more pervasive a lobotomy of men this is the bullet it's on purpose it's just clear this
[1:54:30.280 --> 1:54:34.920]  is all trendy liberals that's one alternative the other alternative to take this extremely
[1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:39.760]  seriously we stand back and we say rationally let us look at the science of this or the
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:45.000]  lack of science and let us pick this apart and do the safest thing for children if we
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:50.800]  are going to protect them in for it from infectious disease sure and preserve their brains and
[1:54:50.800 --> 1:54:56.160]  they'll I mean as more whistleblowers senior come out how can they prop it up dr wakefield
[1:54:56.160 --> 1:55:00.600]  I guess they just hope no one talks about it they hope this audience doesn't spread the
[1:55:00.600 --> 1:55:05.320]  word about this podcast or this live show or this YouTube I guess it's up to you folks
[1:55:05.320 --> 1:55:09.440]  you're going to save the kids out there it is up to the public and this is not going to
[1:55:09.440 --> 1:55:12.560]  happen from the top down it's going to happen from the bottom up and what people have got
[1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:16.240]  to do is get on to their politicians this is not a political issue this crosses all
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:20.920]  the public humanity this is getting on to your politician and demanding that you support
[1:55:20.920 --> 1:55:27.040]  congressman posi in his advocacy for a congressional oversight committee well there's the answer
[1:55:27.040 --> 1:55:31.960]  how many congress people and senators have gone public as their grandson can't talk anymore
[1:55:31.960 --> 1:55:35.760]  they're at their house one week running around having fun the next week they can't talk I
[1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:39.920]  mean this is not rocket science I mean this something's going on here yeah so congress
[1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:46.320]  has got time here Alex and that is look I've interviewed a number of people a number of
[1:55:46.320 --> 1:55:52.160]  people back starting in 1987 when I was writing my first book people who had never been vaccinated
[1:55:52.160 --> 1:55:57.120]  but they had been brought up on good diets good nutrition good environment good family
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:56:01.640]  etc etc and they weren't eating all kinds of junk food and so forth and they weren't taking
[1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:07.360]  all kinds of medical drugs for non-existent conditions that were just there to sell pharmaceuticals
[1:56:07.360 --> 1:56:12.560]  and these people came through fine they were not only came through fine they were exceedingly
[1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:20.120]  healthy so the whole house of cards is a sham you want to protect people from getting sick
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:25.880]  you raise them correctly you have a you know a world in which people can grow up healthy
[1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:31.480]  naturally the body knows what to do you're going to inject all these poisons in tiny
[1:56:31.480 --> 1:56:36.800]  babies whose immune systems are not even developed yet and say that it's going to stimulate their
[1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:41.640]  immune system to protect them from future disease when they virtually have no immune
[1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:46.880]  system yet I mean this is completely insane no what you do is you do the very thing that
[1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:51.720]  eliminated contagious diseases in the west in the first place better sanitation better
[1:56:51.720 --> 1:56:57.520]  nutrition less overcrowding and so forth and so on this is what you do I mean this is this
[1:56:57.520 --> 1:57:03.920]  is a really fresh air and sunshine incredibly epic no more fake news dot com John report
[1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:09.720]  thank you so much for being part of this special broadcast tonight thank you Alex always a pleasure
[1:57:09.720 --> 1:57:15.960]  Dr. Wakefield autism media channel on YouTube will tweet it out to everybody at real life
[1:57:15.960 --> 1:57:21.680]  shows I want to have you back up in the next week or two for a two hour interview with listeners
[1:57:21.680 --> 1:57:26.720]  calling him with their stories thank you so much but I know you do this because you care
[1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:31.720]  about the kids but it's got to be fulfilling to now be vindicated it'll be fulfilling
[1:57:31.720 --> 1:57:36.720]  Alex if we achieve what we need to achieve and that is it's up to the people to prevail
[1:57:36.720 --> 1:57:40.800]  it's up to them to exert the due democratic process get on to your politicians that's
[1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:45.360]  right demand a congressional hearing the answers look in the mirror great job of the crew see
