[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:31.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones welcome to
[00:31.040 --> 00:35.280]  the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'll be your host today but Alex is going to be joining us in
[00:35.280 --> 00:41.240]  the second hour he's going to be on the line we also have joining us in the third hour representative
[00:41.240 --> 00:49.800]  Matt Shea from Washington State about the video that's become controversial the the person who
[00:49.800 --> 00:53.960]  was explaining the sheriff's deputy who was explaining his MRAP and all of its capabilities
[00:53.960 --> 00:59.440]  and was asked a very simple question why do you need that here in this small town and he
[00:59.440 --> 01:05.120]  immediately replied well we have constitutionalists we have people who have guns and lots of ammunition
[01:05.120 --> 01:10.600]  so we're going to be talking to him about that comment because that comment is not taken out
[01:10.600 --> 01:16.280]  context it's taken in the context of why do you have this militarized vehicle here why is the
[01:16.280 --> 01:22.120]  federal government pushing this on local police departments why are they pushing this narrative
[01:22.120 --> 01:26.920]  that their enemies people they need to be afraid of are people called constitutionalist we've seen
[01:26.920 --> 01:32.360]  this over and over again of course there's a lot of news that is breaking on crony capitalism and
[01:32.360 --> 01:37.480]  we're going to talk a little bit about Elizabeth Warren's speech she really nailed it about city
[01:37.480 --> 01:41.800]  group disagree with her on a little bit of the issues but we're not going to really pick nits
[01:41.800 --> 01:48.200]  on this because we need to stand with people when they're right on issues take them a single issue
[01:48.200 --> 01:51.640]  at a time there's probably nothing else I would agree with Elizabeth Warren on and you know there's
[01:51.640 --> 01:56.200]  a lot of people who probably wouldn't find anything they would agree with Rand Paul on in the democrat
[01:56.200 --> 02:01.880]  party except for the fact that he's against the surveillance state the police state stand with him
[02:01.880 --> 02:07.320]  on those issues stand with Elizabeth Warren when she attacks the bankers and calls out what is really
[02:07.320 --> 02:11.960]  happening there of course we're going to talk about what real crony capitalism is the essential
[02:11.960 --> 02:18.680]  ingredient of crony capitalism is that you need cronies you need cronies in washington and so I
[02:18.680 --> 02:24.840]  think it's one of those issues kind of like campaign finance reform if you want to get to the solution
[02:24.840 --> 02:30.600]  you've got to stop this black hole of money and power that we call washington that's got to be
[02:30.600 --> 02:36.360]  restrained that's the real draw the real magnet to we're also going to talk about obama's derivatives
[02:36.360 --> 02:41.320]  not just the bank's derivatives but obama's derivatives he's trying to leverage his power
[02:41.320 --> 02:46.360]  not just with executive orders but now we see that he's playing these kind of prevaricating
[02:47.080 --> 02:54.600]  games calling them memoranda and if you look at that as we had Jerome Corsi on a couple of weeks
[02:54.600 --> 03:00.760]  ago talking about the fact that this executive amnesty that obama was saying he was going to do via
[03:00.760 --> 03:05.960]  executive order was not anything that was ever written up it was nothing that was ever signed
[03:05.960 --> 03:10.840]  it was nothing that was ever filed it just came out of his mouth and of course he is
[03:11.480 --> 03:16.360]  putting out a lot of memoranda all the time as well there's a story on usa today linked on the
[03:16.360 --> 03:20.600]  drudge report about that we're going to talk about what's really behind that and how they play
[03:20.600 --> 03:27.400]  games with the numbers there but of course the banks are partying like it's 1929 or 2007 they're
[03:27.400 --> 03:33.640]  loosening up their credit standards we're going to talk about uh dc coming on a collision course
[03:33.640 --> 03:38.760]  with the federal government over the marijuana legalization issue what's going to happen with
[03:38.760 --> 03:44.440]  that is that going to become a kind of nullification trying to push back against washington's
[03:45.160 --> 03:51.000]  trying to just trying to control everything about everybody's lives and so we see that's
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.640]  that's coming to a head in washington could that set a bad precedent could that be something that
[03:55.640 --> 04:00.520]  would actually harm state nullification because dc is not really a state so it's not really going to
[04:00.520 --> 04:06.840]  be a good test case of that but we also see some trouble building up next year at the on the 31st
[04:06.840 --> 04:14.120]  utah is going to demand that feds surrender their lands by december 31st something that should have
[04:14.120 --> 04:18.920]  happened when utah and nevada and some of these western territories became states we've pointed
[04:18.920 --> 04:23.480]  that out this is something that has been building for several years and at the same time we see
[04:23.480 --> 04:32.440]  that happening of course just as the crony capitalist harry reid got involved with people in nevada
[04:32.440 --> 04:37.640]  handing off property rights that belong to cowboys we now see in this latest budget bill
[04:37.640 --> 04:43.320]  that john mccain is doing the same thing in arizona except to the indians it's a crony
[04:43.320 --> 04:47.160]  capitalist versus the cowboys and the indians who's going to get the land that's the fight
[04:47.160 --> 04:57.160]  that's coming up we'll talk about that when we come back stay with us
[04:59.720 --> 05:05.240]  as the year is coming to a close we all pause to reflect on what's happened in the past year
[05:05.240 --> 05:11.000]  we take a step back and thank god for what we have i'm david hall founder of diamond gusset

[08:45.400 --> 08:49.960]  today i'm david night we're going to have alex jones joining us in the second hour he's going to be
[08:49.960 --> 08:56.200]  with us the entire second hour we have also a washington state representative matt shea who's
[08:56.200 --> 09:01.800]  going to join us in the third hour talking about what's going on in washington state around the
[09:01.800 --> 09:08.840]  spokane area the spokane county sheriff's office specifically yet another example of what we're
[09:08.840 --> 09:14.040]  seeing across the country it's not just one police department if it were that would be one issue
[09:14.040 --> 09:18.120]  but this is something that we're seeing happening in new hampshire we're seeing it happen
[09:18.120 --> 09:22.440]  in washington state we're seeing it happen everywhere in between this is something that's
[09:22.440 --> 09:26.760]  being driven by the federal government militarization of the police changing the way they interact
[09:26.760 --> 09:30.760]  with the public the way they think of the public so matter of fact it was just yesterday that
[09:30.760 --> 09:37.560]  paul joseph was on talking about the beware program this is a program that for 36 000
[09:37.560 --> 09:42.120]  dollars a year and that of course is paid by the federal government who is pushing this on local
[09:42.120 --> 09:48.520]  enforcement for 36 000 dollars a year they will troll social media looking for comments they will
[09:48.520 --> 09:53.560]  look at your purchasing records and they will start assigning threat levels to you that they
[09:53.560 --> 10:00.360]  can then give to the police rating you from a green yellow or red send that to the police as
[10:00.360 --> 10:05.560]  they have engagements with you so not only are you a threat if you're in the general public to
[10:05.560 --> 10:10.040]  the police that's the rules of engagement they're being told but they're going to actually rate you
[10:10.040 --> 10:16.040]  as to how much of a threat you are now we see in the city of pitsburg they've actually banned
[10:16.040 --> 10:20.680]  negative comments and i'm going to get to uh what's going on with the banks today as well but
[10:20.680 --> 10:25.000]  just before i get that i want to do this little aside here because as we see this over and over
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.600]  again this is a developing pattern of behavior not only monitoring everything people do but
[10:30.600 --> 10:35.800]  assigning this kind of threat level to them in pitsburg in the city of pitsburg south pitsburg
[10:35.800 --> 10:41.400]  they have banned negative comments on social media for people who work for the city they say it seems
[10:41.400 --> 10:45.640]  like every few meetings we're having to address something that's been on facebook and it has
[10:45.640 --> 10:51.720]  created negative publicity for so every city employee is now going to have to sign an acknowledgement
[10:51.720 --> 10:56.200]  of this policy and some of them are pushing back and they said but what they're trying to say is
[10:56.200 --> 11:01.160]  if i'm a city employee you're telling me that what i can say at night is not freedom of speech and
[11:01.160 --> 11:06.600]  they say well you can say pretty much all you want just not anything that sheds a negative light on
[11:06.600 --> 11:13.560]  any person entity board or things of that nature go ahead and post all you want just don't criticize
[11:13.560 --> 11:19.960]  us does that look kind of like what happened in mexico recently remember those 49 college
[11:19.960 --> 11:26.360]  students who were killed remember why they were killed they heckled a politician's wife at a speech
[11:26.360 --> 11:30.920]  and for that a couple of mayors in a couple of different cities as well as a couple of police
[11:30.920 --> 11:36.520]  departments in a couple of cities got together and put a hit out on these 49 students using
[11:36.520 --> 11:43.960]  the drug gangs how far are we from that when we have a government that is increasingly insular
[11:43.960 --> 11:49.320]  and sensitive about everything will not let us know anything everything is on a need to know and
[11:49.320 --> 11:58.040]  of course you as just a citizen don't have a need to know anything now obama has been issuing
[11:58.040 --> 12:04.360]  executive orders by another name this is a story that's up on usa today says that he's been issuing
[12:04.360 --> 12:10.440]  things that he calls memoranda they're not technically executive orders they say you know if
[12:10.440 --> 12:15.560]  it looks like it it walks like it it smells like it that's what it is but he's saying that no they're
[12:15.560 --> 12:20.520]  no they're really just executive they're they're memoranda not executive orders now of course we
[12:20.520 --> 12:27.240]  just had a couple of weeks ago we had Dr. Jerome Corsi from WND doing some research and he found
[12:27.240 --> 12:32.120]  that this executive order that's going to grant amnesty they say to five million people but we
[12:32.120 --> 12:36.920]  had an article up on info wars dot com yesterday sheriff analyzed this and said this is an open
[12:36.920 --> 12:42.280]  amnesty this is way bigger than five million people of course they don't know that five million is
[12:42.280 --> 12:46.360]  based on their census reports i mean if you're here illegally you're going to fill out a census
[12:46.360 --> 12:52.600]  report this is an entitlement program it's an inducement for further illegal immigration
[12:52.600 --> 12:57.800]  whether it's used or not and yet of course the republicans didn't do anything to try to stop it
[12:58.760 --> 13:04.680]  but as dr. Jerome Corsi pointed out obama never wrote up an executive order he never signed an
[13:04.680 --> 13:11.720]  executive order he never filed an executive order on amnesty he just spoke it or maybe he wrote a
[13:11.720 --> 13:16.680]  memoranda this is what he's been doing is writing these memoranda now they point out that he's already
[13:16.680 --> 13:21.480]  signed 33 percent more presidential memoranda in the last six years and bush did an eight
[13:21.480 --> 13:27.400]  he's done 45 percent more than bill clinton did and they've got a graph here at one point they say
[13:27.400 --> 13:34.520]  well he's doing more than um any president since harry truman battled the do nothing congress seven
[13:34.520 --> 13:41.000]  decades ago well this doesn't even come close to what truman did seven decades ago with the quote
[13:41.000 --> 13:48.520]  unquote do nothing congress it is not an excuse for him to go around congress if they don't pass
[13:48.520 --> 13:53.000]  the legislation that he would like to see that's why we have a division of power but if you look
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.920]  at their chart you can see essentially an exponential curve going up starting with carter
[13:58.920 --> 14:03.000]  and going all the way up through obama you see an exponential curve in terms of the memoranda
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.440]  that they're doing there you can see it right there you see there's one little drop right there
[14:06.440 --> 14:11.320]  under bush i guess the question is maybe you know bush 41 didn't want to even go on paper
[14:11.320 --> 14:17.080]  with memoranda maybe as a cia guy he just kept everything secret so nobody would know but then
[14:17.080 --> 14:23.160]  you have this pushback from harry reid saying earlier when people were accusing obama of
[14:23.160 --> 14:27.640]  executive overreach he said well they accuse him of that but they neglect the fact that he's
[14:27.640 --> 14:33.880]  issued far fewer executive orders than any two term president in the last 50 years i don't think
[14:33.880 --> 14:39.320]  that's true even if it were that's not taking into account the memoranda it's not taking into account
[14:39.320 --> 14:45.160]  executive orders that he says he's made but not signed or filed but here's the big deal it's not
[14:45.160 --> 14:50.680]  even about the quantity it's about the quality as they point out memoranda can be anything or
[14:50.680 --> 14:55.720]  executive orders can be anything from saying that we're going to have a particular holiday that is
[14:55.720 --> 15:04.600]  going to be off for employees or it can be massive amnesty and open borders do you see the qualitative
[15:04.600 --> 15:09.080]  difference between saying this is when we're going to take the christmas holiday versus
[15:09.080 --> 15:15.560]  we're going to allow unlimited immigration to take down this welfare state that we've set up
[15:15.560 --> 15:21.640]  that's the real issue but it's not just obama there's another article up on info wars dot com
[15:21.640 --> 15:29.560]  today from denis kasinich former democrat congressman absolutely amazed that three members of congress
[15:29.560 --> 15:35.080]  he says just reignited the cold war while no one was looking well i don't think they reignited it i
[15:35.080 --> 15:38.840]  think they're throwing fuel on the fire in a major way this is what he describes he said
[15:39.800 --> 15:45.000]  late thursday night the house of representatives unanimously passed a far-reaching russia sanctions
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.680]  bill a hydraheaded incubator of poisonous conflict the second provocative anti russian legislation
[15:50.680 --> 15:57.240]  in just a week it further polarizes our relations with russia helping to cement a russia china alliance
[15:57.240 --> 16:04.520]  against western hegemony and undermines long-term american financial and physical security by handing
[16:04.520 --> 16:11.480]  the national treasury over to war profiteers now this is something that passed unanimously but
[16:11.480 --> 16:18.440]  according to the rules unanimous in this case meant just three guys there late at night everybody
[16:18.440 --> 16:24.680]  else had gone home after they had passed this continuing resolution slash omnibus bill everyone
[16:24.680 --> 16:31.080]  else had gone home three guys on the floor they pulled this bill up and they have the power to say
[16:31.080 --> 16:37.000]  we're going to do this unanimously and since neither the three of them says no it passes late at night
[16:37.800 --> 16:42.840]  does that sound familiar to anybody who knows the history of the federal reserve remember how we
[16:42.840 --> 16:48.840]  got the federal reserve act in 1913 they did it around the christmas holidays after everybody
[16:48.840 --> 16:54.040]  had gone home we've seen this pattern happen over and over again well what did these three guys get
[16:54.040 --> 16:59.160]  passed unanimously just on a voice vote between the three of them what did they get passed well
[16:59.160 --> 17:04.520]  here's what they got passed sanctions of russia's energy industry sanctions of russia's defense
[17:04.520 --> 17:10.600]  industry sanctions of russia's banking and investments privatization of ukrainian infrastructure
[17:10.600 --> 17:16.280]  here how is the american government privatizing ukrainian infrastructure are we in control of
[17:16.280 --> 17:22.760]  ukraine well yeah through the world bank and usa id then money 50 million dollars for a corporate
[17:22.760 --> 17:28.440]  takeover ukrain's oil and gas sectors 350 million dollars for military assistance to the ukraine
[17:28.440 --> 17:34.200]  30 million dollars for an intensive radio tv and internet propaganda campaign for former countries
[17:34.200 --> 17:39.560]  of the soviet union 20 million dollars for democratic organizing in the ukraine 60 million
[17:39.560 --> 17:45.160]  dollars for the national endowment for democracy to improve democratic governance they say an
[17:45.160 --> 17:50.760]  unverified declaration that russia has violated the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty
[17:50.760 --> 17:57.960]  a path for the us withdrawal from the iron meth treaty a demand that russia verifiably dismantle
[17:57.960 --> 18:04.280]  quote any ground launch cruise missiles etc etc now if you total this up what they spent
[18:04.280 --> 18:12.440]  is 510 million dollars three guys on the house floor do you get the idea that washington is out
[18:12.440 --> 18:18.280]  of control do you think that we're being controlled by just a minority of people who are gaming the
[18:18.280 --> 18:25.240]  rules like obama did and it is not just obama it's a pervasive problem if the republicans if
[18:25.240 --> 18:31.960]  the democrats wanted to stop any of this they had ample opportunity to do it they had ample warning

[18:49.400 --> 18:55.320]  florida talk to republicans republicans say they don't like bailouts either so i asked them to vote
[18:55.320 --> 19:01.560]  the way they talk if they don't like bailouts then they could take out this provision that puts
[19:01.560 --> 19:09.880]  tax payers right back on the hook for bailing out big banks today i'm coming to the floor not to talk
[19:09.880 --> 19:18.520]  about democrats or republicans but to talk about a third group that also wields tremendous power

[24:25.720 --> 24:30.760]  we just left off with elizabeth warn and warn talking about this banker bail out the
[24:31.720 --> 24:36.120]  insurance of the derivatives and how city bank is really at the bottom of that
[24:36.680 --> 24:41.480]  but before we do i want to tell you about our special we have a yesterday and today we had

[25:25.000 --> 25:29.880]  special that today is the last day of that now going back to these comments that elizabeth warn
[25:29.880 --> 25:36.120]  had she said to just recap what we heard her say she said i came one day and i talked to the democrats
[25:36.120 --> 25:42.040]  about how we don't want to go back and ensure these bailouts again then i came the next day and i
[25:42.040 --> 25:48.680]  talked to the gop now today i'm coming back to talk to city bank we have an article up on info
[25:48.680 --> 25:55.800]  wars dot com meet your newest legislator city group this is from wall street on parade they point out
[25:55.800 --> 26:01.160]  that the city that city group is the wall street mega bank that forced the repeal of glass deagle
[26:01.160 --> 26:08.280]  back in 1999 then blew itself up as a result of the pump and dump that happened uh and culminated
[26:08.280 --> 26:13.640]  in 2008 then was propped back up in the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world
[26:13.640 --> 26:18.280]  even though it was insolvent and didn't even qualify for the bailout it's now written its own
[26:18.280 --> 26:22.600]  legislation to deregulate itself it's got the president to lobby for its passage and it's
[26:22.600 --> 26:26.840]  received an upvote from both houses of congress in less than a week and they say and here's one
[26:26.840 --> 26:32.040]  more thing about city bank that you don't know or city group it didn't just have a hand in bringing
[26:32.040 --> 26:38.920]  the country to its knees in 2008 it was a key participant in the 1929 collapse under the moniker
[26:38.920 --> 26:46.440]  national city bank same thing is true of jp morgan of course the actual man now the group
[26:46.440 --> 26:52.840]  bears his name it was interesting about a year ago on the anniversary of the 100th anniversary
[26:52.840 --> 26:59.000]  of the federal reserve act being passed surreptitiously uh around christmas vacation just
[26:59.000 --> 27:06.440]  as we saw this massive 510 million dollar bill and essentially throwing down the gauntlet to
[27:06.440 --> 27:11.480]  russia with sanctions on essentially everything that getting passed on the house floor with just
[27:11.480 --> 27:17.320]  three members present and doing a voice vote there was shenanigans like that and passing
[27:17.320 --> 27:23.080]  the federal reserve act 100 years ago and i kind of pointed out how the bankers would manufacture
[27:23.080 --> 27:29.080]  banking crises and then use that to push for their own solutions such as the federal reserve
[27:29.640 --> 27:36.280]  i drew parallels in a video that we did at the time to it's a wonderful life and that went up
[27:36.280 --> 27:43.080]  on youtube and when it got to about 12 000 views youtube took that down they said it was a violation
[27:43.080 --> 27:50.760]  of copyright it wasn't a violation of copyright it was fair use it was commentary comparison
[27:51.320 --> 27:58.920]  between it's a wonderful life and what jp morgan did furthermore they had the entire movie it's a
[27:58.920 --> 28:04.520]  wonderful life available in the united states for people to watch and has been up there for years
[28:04.520 --> 28:09.000]  at the time i think it was uh 700 000 people had viewed it it had been up for two years
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.840]  years they didn't have a problem with that but if we used a few excerpts and commented on the
[28:14.840 --> 28:21.560]  similarity between uh what the banker uh who tried to put the savings and loan out of business
[28:21.560 --> 28:26.120]  in bedford falls and that story it's a wonderful life if we drew a parallel between that and the
[28:26.120 --> 28:31.640]  creation of the federal reserve between the banker who did that and jp morgan that was
[28:31.640 --> 28:35.560]  going to be a violation of copyright they said they took it down they took it down for about
[28:35.560 --> 28:40.040]  seven months and we had other people post it up put it up they would take theirs down as well same
[28:40.040 --> 28:46.920]  thing this is a violation of copyright then they took the copyright violation off this summer i
[28:46.920 --> 28:51.400]  guess they figured nobody was going to be looking for it's a wonderful lie uh but that we're going
[28:51.400 --> 28:55.720]  to put that video back up we need to do that but that's exactly what they're doing congress is using
[28:55.720 --> 29:03.720]  its power as a banker derivative uses their power the difference is that they're not deriving their
[29:03.720 --> 29:11.800]  just power from the consent of the govern they're leveraging their power by accepting contributions
[29:11.800 --> 29:18.440]  and giving away your taxpayer dollars giving away our economy not just your mortgages they're going
[29:18.440 --> 29:23.800]  for the whole enchilada they have this is all the derivatives and they're pulling this back in
[29:23.800 --> 29:28.920]  to have it covered under fdic insurance we're going to be right back after the break we're
[29:28.920 --> 29:34.520]  going to talk specifically about what elizabeth warren said we're going to talk about what really
[29:34.520 --> 29:39.640]  needs to be done with this and we're going to look at what's going on with russia a massive economic
[29:39.640 --> 29:46.120]  warfare there and the rt time says russia may go nuclear talking at this moment economically but
[29:46.120 --> 29:53.080]  it could happen physically if this keeps up we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and

[34:13.000 --> 34:19.320]  and family and that's really the task before us at this point we need if we're going to have effective
[34:19.320 --> 34:26.040]  change we need a much broader base of people who are really aware as to what's going on right now
[34:26.040 --> 34:32.520]  as we just saw they're pulling the wool over our eyes we've got obama issuing executive orders
[34:32.520 --> 34:39.160]  calling them memoranda essentially going against the will of congress saying i'm not getting what
[34:39.160 --> 34:43.880]  i want from you guys i'm just going to go around it and of course playing games with it saying that
[34:43.880 --> 34:48.920]  well he's not issuing any more than other presidents have when other presidents memoranda
[34:48.920 --> 34:56.440]  about vacation holidays count as a memoranda he is going around and offering open borders massive
[34:56.440 --> 35:03.320]  amnesty access to the welfare state for tens of millions of people it's an entitlement program
[35:03.320 --> 35:09.880]  for people that aren't even citizens in america it's a cloward and piven strategy and he's joined
[35:09.880 --> 35:16.040]  in that by john bainer and republican leadership but where we're going to really see the economy
[35:16.040 --> 35:23.640]  collapse is a replay of 2008 a replay of 1929 we talked about that in the last segment of course
[35:23.640 --> 35:29.080]  the key player one of the key players there is city group and elizabeth warren called them out on the
[35:29.080 --> 35:35.160]  floor of the senate trying to convince republicans and democrats to stand by their rhetoric and say
[35:35.160 --> 35:41.320]  they're not for bailouts we know they're for bailouts they voted for bailouts we know that
[35:41.320 --> 35:46.840]  they don't want to stop amnesty they voted to fund amnesty we know they don't want to stop obama
[35:46.840 --> 35:52.040]  care they voted to fund obama care can we get over this i mean i saw something on the dredge
[35:52.040 --> 35:56.680]  report the other day mark levin said i'm this close from leaving the republican party what does it
[35:56.680 --> 36:03.240]  take how many times do they have to lie to you before you leave i left them decades ago miles
[36:03.240 --> 36:09.160]  behind i figured out that game a long time ago haven't you gop people haven't you democrats
[36:09.160 --> 36:14.520]  haven't you democrats now seen the bankers get everything they want from the democrats you
[36:14.520 --> 36:19.320]  can't wake up about that you can't wake up about the torture about the endless wars about the
[36:19.320 --> 36:25.480]  surveillance state look at this from city group this is back in 2011 from info wars dot com
[36:25.480 --> 36:31.320]  headline city group ordered to pay 285 million in derivatives fraud complaint they say that
[36:32.440 --> 36:38.360]  they sold a portfolio with risky mortgage related investments to unsuspecting customers
[36:38.360 --> 36:42.440]  and then bet against it they bet against the thing they were selling their customers
[36:42.440 --> 36:48.280]  so they paid 285 million but they had sold a billion dollar portfolio of mortgage related
[36:48.280 --> 36:55.560]  investments see crime pays crime pays in washington and it's paying off again now what do we see
[36:55.560 --> 37:02.120]  in the immediate aftermath of the bipartisan support for putting the bankers back on taxpayer
[37:02.120 --> 37:08.920]  insurance again only six years after they did this to us that's how stupid we are they say the banks
[37:08.920 --> 37:13.000]  are loosening lending standards this is a report from the la times they said the largest us banks
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.400]  have lowered their standards for some of the riskiest lending and a sign that weak underwriting
[37:17.400 --> 37:23.640]  is returning to levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis according to a regulator's report
[37:23.640 --> 37:28.360]  well why not they've got nothing to lose but your money they're not going to lose their money
[37:28.360 --> 37:32.440]  the profits will they'll keep but they'll lose your money they say the banks have continued to
[37:32.440 --> 37:39.560]  road standards especially with large corporate loans consumer loans and leveraged lending
[37:39.560 --> 37:45.160]  leveraged lending risky financing used to fund corporate takeovers and a lot of other things
[37:45.160 --> 37:50.120]  too they bet everything in the world on these leverage bios now they have a quote from jennifer
[37:50.120 --> 37:56.360]  kelly the chief national bank examiner with some bureaucracy called the office of comptroller of
[37:56.360 --> 38:03.240]  the currency she said the trends are quote very similar to those from 2004 to 2006 and they said
[38:03.240 --> 38:10.120]  in their report that they think the credit risk will continue to increase in 2015 yeah no doubt
[38:10.120 --> 38:15.480]  remember when ronald reagan said if you want more of something yes subsidize it what are they
[38:15.480 --> 38:21.320]  subsidizing they're subsidizing the bankers taking inordinate risk so of course you're
[38:21.320 --> 38:26.120]  going to get more of that now what did elizabeth warren say on the floor of the senate we played
[38:26.120 --> 38:30.440]  that quote where she said she talked to democrat she talked to republicans now she's going to talk
[38:30.440 --> 38:36.120]  directly to city bank and talk about city bank she pointed out the vast influence that they have
[38:36.120 --> 38:42.280]  at city bank and of course uh city bank goldman sacks the usual suspects these guys essentially
[38:42.280 --> 38:47.480]  fill most of the financial related positions in washington she said three of the last four
[38:47.480 --> 38:52.760]  treasury secretaries under democrat presidents have had close city group ties the fourth was
[38:52.760 --> 38:56.680]  offered the ceo position at city core but turned it down she points out the vice chair of the
[38:56.680 --> 39:01.560]  federal reserve system is an alumnus of city group she says the undersecretary for international
[39:01.560 --> 39:07.480]  affairs is a city group alumni the u.s trade representative and the person nominated to be
[39:07.480 --> 39:11.480]  his decade uh his deputy who's currently an assistant secretary treasury their city group
[39:11.480 --> 39:19.560]  alumni what is the u.s trade representative doing right now he is fast tracking the trans-pacific
[39:19.560 --> 39:28.680]  partnership the transatlantic partnership these are massive sovereignty attacking trade agreements
[39:28.680 --> 39:33.640]  that go after our financial go after the internet go after privacy go after control
[39:33.640 --> 39:39.000]  of the internet many different issues beyond free trade beyond finances but these are being
[39:39.000 --> 39:45.880]  negotiated in secret in secret as part of this fast-track trade negotiation our elected
[39:45.880 --> 39:52.520]  representatives are not allowed to see what these banker lobbyists are doing along with our trade
[39:52.520 --> 39:57.480]  representatives from the u.s government we're not allowed to know what's going on with that
[39:57.480 --> 40:02.040]  we'll have to let them pass it until we can see what they're going to do to us but we've
[40:02.040 --> 40:07.880]  had some leaks from wiki leaks and others and of course this is something that they're going to
[40:07.880 --> 40:13.000]  we know that they're going to give themselves power elevated to the level of sovereign states
[40:13.640 --> 40:21.000]  they will have a tribunal kind of a trial if they think that regulation or something is costing
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.600]  them too much money they will have the same level only multinational corporations this is not your
[40:26.600 --> 40:33.480]  mom-and-pop business down the street that decides to organize for tax purposes as a sub chapter s
[40:33.480 --> 40:38.760]  corporation or as a c corporation no these are the multinational corporations not even the big
[40:38.760 --> 40:44.760]  corporations that are entirely subsumed within one country no these are the multinational
[40:44.760 --> 40:50.840]  corporations that will be given these special government-like powers she points out that
[40:50.840 --> 40:55.880]  wall streeters on wall street and wall streeters who had powerful government jobs teamed up
[40:55.880 --> 41:01.560]  and blocked the move to break up the banks and she said now city bank is bigger than ever and she
[41:01.560 --> 41:06.680]  pointed out that new york magazine quoted an official from the treasury and she said uh i'm
[41:06.680 --> 41:12.200]  quoting this if we'd been for it talking about uh the treasure probably would have happened but we
[41:12.200 --> 41:18.600]  weren't so it didn't she said that's the kind of power that they have there that's a very scary
[41:18.600 --> 41:24.600]  thing she said you should have been broken into pieces she said uh i agree that dod frank isn't
[41:24.600 --> 41:30.600]  perfect if it was you would have been broken into pieces now that's where i disagree i i don't want
[41:30.600 --> 41:36.040]  to nitpick what she had to say i think she did a very great impassioned speech pointing out the
[41:36.040 --> 41:41.560]  corruption in washington pointing out the crony capitalism we have an article up on info wars
[41:41.560 --> 41:47.080]  dot com that talks about uh what elizabeth warren missed in her big bank tirade i don't think we
[41:47.080 --> 41:51.960]  need to throw rocks at elizabeth warren i just disagree with the fact that it can be fixed by
[41:51.960 --> 41:59.640]  breaking up city bank the problem is not the consolidation that that is a symptom of the
[41:59.640 --> 42:05.000]  problem the root problem is that there's too much power and money that's been consolidated into
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.360]  washington so it's the consolidation in the government that creates this kind of consolidation
[42:10.360 --> 42:15.880]  as a matter of fact it was under bill clinton that the massive consolidations of banks began
[42:16.520 --> 42:21.560]  when they approved the nation bank and bank of america merger that was the largest merger
[42:21.560 --> 42:25.720]  anybody had ever seen at the time nobody really believed the government was going to approve it
[42:25.720 --> 42:30.440]  because they underestimated the influence of the big banks in the white house in the clinton
[42:30.440 --> 42:35.800]  white house and of course hillary clinton is joined at the hip with goldman sacks but they
[42:35.800 --> 42:41.800]  approved that merger that set a precedent that allowed these banks to become quote too big to
[42:41.800 --> 42:47.400]  fail and too big to jail it all started in the clinton white house and it was in the clinton
[42:47.400 --> 42:53.640]  uh regime that they took out last steagle which was set up to separate the risky
[42:54.360 --> 43:00.920]  ventures into margin calls into options that had fueled the speculative bubble that that
[43:00.920 --> 43:07.080]  burst in the uh in the great depression they had set that apart and said we're going to enact
[43:07.880 --> 43:13.160]  certain restrictions on banks because we're going to give them certain protections like fdic
[43:13.160 --> 43:18.840]  insurance along with that fdic insurance they were going to have certain regulatory restrictions
[43:18.840 --> 43:24.680]  as to what they could do that was removed under bill clinton the consolidation of the banks happened
[43:24.680 --> 43:30.920]  under the clinton's so yes you can break up the banks and that was something that uh that that
[43:30.920 --> 43:35.480]  foreshadowed all of this but it was only a symptom of the fact that they can get whatever they want
[43:35.480 --> 43:41.720]  in washington when washington has access to so much power and can print money at will
[43:41.720 --> 43:46.440]  that's the real problem it's just like campaign finance reform if you go in and try to artificially
[43:47.080 --> 43:52.360]  influence elections by putting all kinds of rules nobody's going to get hurt by that but
[43:52.360 --> 43:59.560]  certain uh people who are small individuals people who are outside of the political insiders people
[43:59.560 --> 44:05.160]  like dinesh desuza will go to jail but the big guys are going to continue to bundle the contributions
[44:05.160 --> 44:10.840]  the problem is that everybody is going to washington it's a magnet for corruption
[44:10.840 --> 44:15.480]  to have that much power consolidated that's why the founders of this country talk so much about
[44:15.480 --> 44:21.000]  consolidation about division of power that's why they put it in the constitution that we now ignore
[44:21.880 --> 44:27.640]  to divulge power away from a center they knew that power would want to become centralized
[44:27.640 --> 44:33.640]  and that it would breed this kind of corruption so you can't have crony capitalism if you don't
[44:33.640 --> 44:39.880]  have the cronies in washington and to make it clear that it's its city bank writing the legislation
[44:39.880 --> 44:46.120]  uh we've put up on info wars dot com this uh legislation that was put out and and you can
[44:46.120 --> 44:52.600]  see the city bank draft from the lobbyist side by side with the final bill and you can see that
[44:52.600 --> 44:57.480]  it was and it was this case it was another democrat jim heins from connecticut who basically put
[44:57.480 --> 45:01.880]  this up they didn't get what they wanted on some of these things but they keep coming back until
[45:01.880 --> 45:07.160]  they get exactly what they want this time of course he's got help from republicans we've got
[45:07.160 --> 45:12.360]  kevin yoder who is now missing in action a republican after tucking the wall street bail
[45:12.360 --> 45:19.800]  out into government spending bill so in 2013 they use a democrat uh jim heins from connecticut then
[45:19.800 --> 45:26.760]  in 2014 they use a republican see they own both of them it's the banks at the heart of this it's
[45:26.760 --> 45:32.680]  the banks who are pumping up this reckless uh war that they're trying to restart the colder war that
[45:32.680 --> 45:38.680]  we talked to uh uh the author yesterday about that book that's where that is coming from but
[45:38.680 --> 45:45.560]  as we look at as they're moving in this crony capitalism one of the ways that they're doing
[45:45.560 --> 45:51.160]  the crony capitalism of course we saw in nevada member harry reid and how he was passing out
[45:51.160 --> 45:57.320]  favors on federal lands to large multinational corporations some of the deals went through
[45:57.320 --> 46:01.640]  some of the deals were falling through nevertheless they were going in with the
[46:01.640 --> 46:06.360]  bureau of land management the federal government keeping all of this land that should have been
[46:06.360 --> 46:12.200]  turned over and sold out divided up amongst the people of the western states as they became states
[46:12.200 --> 46:16.760]  they didn't do that rather they kept control of that and now they're using that in a kind
[46:16.760 --> 46:21.560]  of crony capitalism we saw that in nevada with harry reid now we see it in this latest budget
[46:21.560 --> 46:27.800]  deal we see that john mccain is doing the same thing this time with a copper mine in nevada
[46:27.800 --> 46:35.080]  it was against the cowboys and arizona is against the indians specifically the apaches but it's the
[46:35.080 --> 46:42.440]  same process each time now we've got utah saying that they're going to fight the feds and tell them
[46:42.440 --> 46:47.240]  they want the lands surrendered to them by december 31st they're going to have a proclamation this is
[46:47.240 --> 46:54.040]  a uh uh new american article they said that coming up on december 31st the state of utah
[46:54.040 --> 47:01.880]  is going to formally demand that washington dc relinquish control of more than 30 million acres
[47:01.880 --> 47:07.720]  of valuable land currently controlled by various federal bureaucracies they say utah lawmakers
[47:07.720 --> 47:13.400]  citizens and experts say the time has come for the state to manage and to profit from its own
[47:13.400 --> 47:18.360]  resources and constitutionally speaking they say experts say the land should have gone to state
[47:18.360 --> 47:25.080]  control generations ago as the federal government promised when utah became a state see that was
[47:25.080 --> 47:31.560]  the underlying argument there at the bundy ranch and we went out there to cover the police brutality
[47:31.560 --> 47:36.760]  but this is the issue and this is something that got underway in utah back in 2013 before the
[47:36.760 --> 47:42.280]  bundy standoff this is a republican governor gary herbert who is putting this through but you can
[47:42.280 --> 47:48.280]  see the pattern of crony capitalism when they control this kind of land they're going to hand
[47:48.280 --> 47:53.480]  it off to their corporate buddies whether it's harry reid doing it in nevada or whether it's
[47:53.480 --> 47:59.640]  john mccain doing it and we need to start stop fighting amongst ourselves we need the cowboys
[47:59.640 --> 48:06.120]  and the indians need to unite against these crony capitalists who are robbing us blind
[48:06.120 --> 48:12.440]  using things that should rightfully belong to us and it's all because of the concentration
[48:12.440 --> 48:17.560]  of power and capital in our nation's capital now there's another fight that's going to be coming
[48:17.560 --> 48:22.360]  up in washington dc that's also come out of this budget deal and that of course some of us talked
[48:22.360 --> 48:28.600]  about how the republicans have said that they're going to stand against this referendum that passed
[48:28.600 --> 48:35.000]  to legalize marijuana in washington dc uh now that was a referendum that passed by 70 percent of
[48:35.000 --> 48:41.400]  the voters in this last election they wanted to legalize marijuana and now the congressional
[48:41.400 --> 48:48.040]  republicans put a provision in this omnibus spending bill saying that they're going to
[48:48.040 --> 48:52.200]  not allow that to happen the provision says that's going to prohibit the city from spending
[48:52.200 --> 48:59.560]  taxpayer dollars in order to enact the initiative see they always bribe us with our money or with
[48:59.560 --> 49:04.840]  the paper money that the federal reserve is doing now the interesting thing i think about this is
[49:04.840 --> 49:09.640]  that i think the only way that we're going to get control of washington certainly the republican
[49:09.640 --> 49:14.440]  party is hopelessly as corrupt as the democrats are the only way that we're going to do it is to
[49:14.440 --> 49:20.520]  get outside of that system one way you can get outside of it is to go to third party politics or
[49:20.520 --> 49:25.000]  create a new party if you're only going to have two parties whatever we need to break that partisan
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.720]  monopoly the founders always understood that was going to be a problem and you know what if you're
[49:29.720 --> 49:34.920]  still a republican and a democrat given these guys a pass you're the biggest part of the problem
[49:34.920 --> 49:39.320]  because you really don't get it so we need to go outside of that party system we need to go
[49:39.320 --> 49:45.000]  outside the mainstream parties but mainly we need to fight it i think at the state and local level
[49:45.000 --> 49:51.720]  with nullification now this brings up an interesting point with dc if they're going to talk about this
[49:51.720 --> 49:57.320]  from a nullification standpoint if they're going to take them to court if they're going to say as
[49:57.320 --> 50:02.840]  he said if the dc government doesn't stand up against the federal government then i will sue the dc
[50:02.840 --> 50:10.440]  government that's going to bring up a very interesting case because the problem i see is that they
[50:10.440 --> 50:17.400]  could very well use this suit and strike it down and then pretend that this is striking down state
[50:17.400 --> 50:23.800]  nullification the district of columbia is not a state they don't have the same powers as the
[50:23.800 --> 50:29.560]  states do the states are sovereign entities who created the federal government in the first place
[50:29.560 --> 50:34.680]  they retained those powers under the ninth and tenth amendment there's not a legal basis for the
[50:34.680 --> 50:39.800]  for washington dc to do that unfortunately for those people maybe they should move to a state
[50:39.800 --> 50:45.800]  but uh that's where i see this as being a problem taking it to court and possibly weakening the
[50:45.800 --> 50:50.360]  idea of using it to weaken the idea of state nullification stay with us we'll be right back

[54:59.320 --> 55:05.400]  stay with us in this segment i wanted to just go over a few short stories because i want to talk
[55:05.400 --> 55:10.360]  more in depth about what's going on in this economic warfare that's developing as well as the
[55:11.000 --> 55:15.960]  derivatives that we've signed on to with the banks and as well as the we've got some torture
[55:15.960 --> 55:20.840]  stories here that have come into play we've got cia medical professionals are now being
[55:21.400 --> 55:24.520]  accused of committing war crimes we're going to talk about that later in the show
[55:25.320 --> 55:30.440]  but it was interesting i thought the day after we saw this siege going on for such a long time
[55:30.440 --> 55:38.200]  in australia and many people have pointed out the the fact of australia's massive gun control how
[55:38.200 --> 55:46.440]  that didn't stop this fellow who had a rap sheet longer than your arm very serious crimes that he
[55:46.440 --> 55:52.280]  had been involved in and accused of yet he was still able to get a hold of a gun in australia
[55:53.000 --> 55:59.320]  and do this so the government didn't protect anybody and from that happening the gun control
[55:59.320 --> 56:04.280]  laws didn't protect anybody from that happening and then i saw this story out of charlotte north
[56:04.280 --> 56:11.560]  carolina a second suspect has been charged in southeast mecklenburg county deadly home invasion
[56:11.560 --> 56:15.480]  they say a teen is dead and his brother is charged after breaking into a home police say
[56:15.480 --> 56:22.280]  these two brothers reportedly trying to break into a home when a 14 year old who was visiting his
[56:22.280 --> 56:27.720]  grandmother shot one of them dead who was later pronounced dead at the scene the other one ran
[56:27.720 --> 56:33.880]  away they caught him he had a pistol he shot them with now here's the other thing about this particular
[56:33.880 --> 56:40.200]  shooting it's not just a 14 year old defending his family with a gun against home invasion
[56:40.200 --> 56:48.680]  from two guys they say that he has seen this kind of violence before he lost his father
[56:48.680 --> 56:58.040]  during a robbery homicide in 2008 his father greg hernandez was shot to death at his business
[56:58.040 --> 57:03.400]  it was greg's automotive he had the hood open on the car he was a mechanic it was his garage
[57:03.400 --> 57:10.360]  somebody came in and shot him they said this boy was eight years old at the time and what he realized
[57:10.360 --> 57:17.960]  i think was that nobody is going to be there to protect you you have to be able to protect yourself
[57:17.960 --> 57:23.480]  that's what good law enforcement is telling people now that's what sheriff dave clark tells people
[57:23.480 --> 57:30.200]  in his jurisdiction he says we'll catch the criminals but we can't be there at the beginning
[57:30.200 --> 57:35.320]  you need to get a gun you need to take a class and learn how to use it safely because you
[57:35.320 --> 57:40.120]  have to be able to protect yourself to fight these guys off and we'll eventually catch them
[57:40.120 --> 57:44.840]  that's what happened in charlotte he shot one of them the other one ran away and then the police
[57:44.840 --> 57:53.080]  caught that guy but he would have been the victim just like his father if he wasn't armed the sad
[57:53.080 --> 57:58.840]  story said that his father died but at least uh he's learned that lesson to protect himself and
[57:58.840 --> 58:06.040]  to protect others now of course we also have more evidence of the burgeoning militarization
[58:06.040 --> 58:12.680]  of the police we have urban training exercises going on around dallas we also have them happening
[58:12.680 --> 58:18.600]  in la and this was an interesting story i'll just mention this before we go to break medical marijuana
[58:18.600 --> 58:25.240]  patients are being identified on the new canadian drivers licenses there you go talk about profiling
[58:25.240 --> 58:31.160]  people for particular activities for crimes for opposition to the state right there on the driver's

[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:29.880]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today on this wednesday
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:35.320]  december 17th 2014 alex jones is going to be joining us in the next segment he's going to be with us
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:41.960]  most of the hour we also have a washington state representative matt shea we talked to him last night
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:49.160]  on the nightly news and he's going to be joining us in the third hour to talk about the video that
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:55.080]  now has become kind of controversial we received that video from some people in washington state
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:00.840]  we put it up with comments and actually it was self-explanatory i think they were showing an
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:05.880]  m-rap vehicle and they had a lady filming it asking the deputy about it and he's talking about all
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:10.440]  the different capabilities and then play this video guys go ahead and put the audio up on it while
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:16.920]  we're watching this they can hear that well this nice thing about this is that if somebody here is
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:22.280]  directing part toward the team is trying to get in they can they're safely can they can pull right
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:28.520]  up to a fight i don't think enemy fire is still trying to address the threat without being afraid
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.840]  of getting shot so i'm thinking that it's totally appropriate in iraq but we're what kind of a
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:37.160]  situation in the us would you see that happening i mean we've got a lot of constitution lists a lot
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:43.640]  of people that stockpile weapons a lot of a lot of ammunition i mean we've got a lot of constitution
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:48.920]  lists a lot of people that stockpile weapons a lot of a lot of ammunition they have they have
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:56.360]  no weapons here locally there you go so that's what we put up we got that clip from somebody
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.720]  now the sheriff's office there said that conment was taken out of context no the context was
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:06.760]  she asked him why would you need that in america we've seen this happen before remember when that
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:14.040]  happened in new hampshire it was a large over-the-top militarized equipment i would call them white
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:20.840]  elephants that was given to the small town police departments and there's a marine colonel saying
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:26.840]  you're better equipped than we were abroad i think it was felucia where he was it was why do you need
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:33.240]  this kind of equipment here he was very concerned about what that was telling us and of course when
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.720]  she asked him you know what do you need he was talking about this is going to protect us from
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:42.040]  fire you know we can get into this thing and not worry about being shot and then he goes
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:47.000]  well why do you need it here well we've got a lot of constitutionalists and people that stockpile
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.760]  weapons lots of ammunition they have weapons here locally what is that about they're concerned
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:57.000]  about citizens having weapons they're concerned about people who are constitutionalists we know
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.760]  very well where that's coming from that's coming from the documents that we've shown over and over
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:06.920]  again where the federal government is creating these scenarios creating fear amongst the police
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:13.640]  departments propagandizing the police departments to be afraid of the citizenry telling them that
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:18.600]  their life is in danger every time they go out that there are people who want to kill them that
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:23.880]  they're not going to go home to their families so they need to shoot first and that's what we're
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:29.000]  seeing here the change in the way the police are interacting with each other so we're going to talk
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:36.280]  to a washington state representative matt shea he doesn't think that the comment is out of context
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:40.600]  and he's going to give us a broader context of some other comments that have been made in that
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:47.480]  particular area now of course the sheriff of the of the spokane county had said that he
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:53.880]  did not agree with the recent gun control legislation that was passed in washington state by referendum
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:04:01.480]  something making it illegal to pass uh firearms from one private individual to another without
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.720]  some kind of a background check he pointed out he didn't even know how he's going to enforce that
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:10.280]  it's really totally unenforceable but that's not even the issue it's not even the issue it's
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:17.560]  whether or not it's a a good law or whether or not it is enforceable the issue is does it impinge
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:24.280]  on our constitutional rights and matt shea had a very good comment when we got a touch with him
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:31.560]  last week he said nobody is proposing that you have to take licensing or get permits to exercise
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:37.640]  your first amendment rights why should we have to do that with our second amendment rights well
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.760]  of course we also see that people in washington are hinting in that direction about the first
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:54.120]  amendment as well stay with us we're going to be right back with alex jones
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:05.240]  as the year is coming to a close we all pause to reflect on what's happened in the past year

[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:16.680]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this december 17th 2014 i'm here in
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:23.080]  the studio joining us live on the road is alex jones alex david you've been doing a fabulous
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:28.200]  job thank you so much for sitting in uh one day last week while i was out and one day the week
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.920]  before and of course much of this week before i get into a lot of really important news and analysis
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:37.960]  over this landline i'm on uh every time i even take a vacation for four or five days which i
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.960]  i'm on here probably more than any other radio talk show host out there doing the sunday show
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:46.680]  taking part of the nightly news most talk show hosts take off about a month a year because it is
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:51.240]  exhausting i take off on average about two and a half weeks and it's because when i do take off
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:55.320]  people really complain and becomes a whole conspiracy theory about where is alex jones
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:09:01.320]  i mean i'll just tell folks that last christmas i had three family members uh die over the course
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:06.280]  of december into january remember folks had to take off uh off and on a record amount of time
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:12.440]  but a week and a half well those nightmares were unfolding uh and then this year it just seems to
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:17.960]  when it rains it pours i've got family health stuff dealing with and then i've also got other
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:23.080]  things i'm just having to take care of but a lot of it's actually very good news very exciting
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:28.280]  and i'll be able to talk about it in the new year but the info war has never been stronger it has
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:33.480]  never been expanding at this level that's all i could tell people is that we're doing some things
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:38.840]  right now they're going to be major game changers the enemy is pulling out all the stops it's like
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:43.720]  a spy movie i'm not going to get into it uh but it's it's it's extremely exciting i mean
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:48.600]  well i got into this fight 22 years ago i had no idea that would become like a james bond movie
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:53.960]  and before i get into the news here today and talk about some issues with david night and
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:59.400]  we have the state rep coming on who's standing up uh to the sheriff most sheriffs are pretty good on
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:04.120]  average uh the sheriffs of federalized minion saying you know he mainly trains for war with
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:08.280]  the american people and he's pretty much standing by those disgusting statements
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.520]  because we told you the unwrapped for the people we told you it was for the tea party and the
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:17.640]  veterans and the christians and the conservatives not because i have a crystal ball i was given this
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:23.720]  intel 20 years ago by people in the military in the fbi when it was just by word of mouth then i
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:28.840]  was given by the fbi and this was actually on video they gave us this an army checkpoint on
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:34.920]  i-35 secret documents that are in the takeover that it was for preparations to condition the public
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:40.440]  for martial law and now it's all been declassified it's in forbs it's in roiders it's in the washington
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:46.680]  post and i got prepared for its main enemy the tea party so let's just get this straight there is a
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:52.760]  world government it is tyrannical it's anti free market it's overthrowing all the checks and balances
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:59.000]  of common law magnacarta constitution declaration of independence bill bill of rights should be
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.440]  declaration of independence constitution bill of rights and again in that sequential time order
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:10.680]  so i correct that the reason i don't like people calling in and thanking me constantly
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:15.880]  and the reason i raise this is because when i take a few days off i get a lot more reflective
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:21.080]  and i want to be on air so bad that burning passion that i always have to be on air becomes
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:27.000]  an explosive passion to be on air when i'm still reading the news tracking information talking to
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.080]  the crew and that's why i want to come back for vacation i'm so charged up but the epicness of
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:40.840]  this battle i see all these other more well-spoken men than i smarter men than i smarter women than
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:47.160]  i am as a man and i see them in business and life being successful but i don't see them in the
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:54.440]  animating contest for liberty and so i'm humbled as a guy who you know quote didn't finish college
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:59.400]  because i've started the media operation successfully when all these great people look
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.800]  up to me when i know that a lot of members of congress on and off record listen to the show
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.800]  when i know that all these people in hollywood listen to the show when i know that tens of millions
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.880]  of you listen to the show when we have the number three guy in the japanese government on who listens
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:17.960]  to the show or andres von bulow the former head of the defense department in germany their former
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:22.600]  cia head comes on and says he's a listener and helped base his book on some of my research the
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:27.800]  cia carried out by 11 translated from german and i'm not bragging about alex cowns here
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:34.200]  it just hit me again not before i went on air that i cannot believe i'm in this position and i
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:40.040]  would imagine david after i leave could speak to this how he got in the position he's in now
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:43.640]  talking to tens of millions of people on the nightly news when he fills in on the radio
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:50.360]  but the reason i mentioned my personal experience and why i'm so humbled is that i already feel
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:54.280]  like i'm not doing enough i already feel like i should be doing more i'm already frustrated
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.920]  that my mind and my intellect and everything is just strong enough to defeat these people
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:04.280]  i'm here trying to move you who are the answer who are the solution who are the resistance to
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:10.520]  realize you have the power david knightson engineer worked in some research think tanks to promote
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:16.600]  liberty did some research in exposing illegal fda testing on people to create fake numbers
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:22.760]  he entered a contest didn't win the contest but here he is talking to tens of millions of people
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:29.000]  every day you folks are the leaders and i don't care if you're not a lawyer or a doctor or an
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:36.280]  fbi agent or a corporate owner if you're just a school teacher or an auto mechanic you can affect
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:42.360]  people you can speak out you can see no you can expose this takeover that's happening you have
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.960]  the power that's why the whole system is about teaching you you don't have the power as an
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:50.840]  individual you only have a power through globalist institutions and that's how they get the best and
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:57.320]  brightest to join this whole collective compartmentalized anti-human system that things are converting
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:02.280]  to there's still a lot of the older better parts of the system left but as we convert to this tyranny
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.640]  they don't want you to ever think about the big picture and that's all i'm doing i'm nobody i am
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:15.080]  like todo the little black dog nothing special about me except i'm so little i can look under
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:20.360]  the curtain and see there's feet there running something and it looks fake to me and i pulled
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:25.880]  the curtain back and there it is i'm not telling you what to see i'm not telling you what's even
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:32.120]  going on i am telling you as a little dog what i see through my eyes when i pulled it back you
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:39.080]  can see what you see there but it's there and now it's out me open and so i am humbled to be here
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:44.200]  and i just thought about the audience today how wonderful you are how good you are and how you've
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:50.760]  put up with me and all of my annoying ticks and and and and warts uh you know that i engage in
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:55.240]  and that's why we're trying to build info wars with other great journalists and researchers so
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:00.600]  that there's different perspectives and different angles and different views on what's happening
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:05.320]  because this thing is so big and it's moving so fast that's why i want you to become citizen
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:10.680]  journalists that's why i want you to start your own websites and start your own investigative
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:17.320]  reportage and never stop because in that action we will find the leaders that will take down the
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:22.680]  new world order but not just find the leaders doing little things overall many hands make
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:28.360]  like work and i know i'm stating the obvious here it's just from the bottom of my heart
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.520]  in this christmas season where we think about family we think about christ we think about all
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:37.320]  the sacrifices of those that came before us for human liberty and dignity and goodness and as we
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:42.920]  see evil exponentially growing and and fraud growing and taking over we also see that equal
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:49.000]  and opposite reaction and do tony and physics of for every action there's an equal and opposite
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:57.720]  reaction and we are that reaction and to be that reaction is to then be in the presence of god's
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:03.960]  spirit and that's why i feel so humbled because we're all fallen we all have that flesh nature
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:09.960]  and that's normal to to then feel when you're actually fighting tyranny and everything to
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:16.120]  actually feel humbled because it's such an epic huge task that we're all involved in and that's
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:22.600]  why i want everybody to realize that i commit in the new year and this christmas to to to to be
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:28.920]  even more of a man to be more focused to be stronger and to commit everything to tell you the truth
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:35.240]  the whole truth and nothing but the truth no matter how horrible it is because it is in that
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.600]  admission of what's horrible that we can then recognize what's good and preserve and expand
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:46.440]  and be good stewards of this planet and create a world where our future progeny can do things
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:51.800]  that we haven't dreamed of just as our ancestors went through hell so that we could have so much
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:58.360]  liberty and so much wealth and be spoiled brats today i want to transcend what this world's trying
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:03.160]  to do to us i want people to break out of the trance i want to break out of the trance because
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:09.800]  we're all in in a certain level in a trance of this modern world caught up looking into you know
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:15.880]  the sirens eye of this whole media system and and so we don't have all the answers like billy
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:21.240]  corrigan said last week we don't have to always even be right our hearts right our guts right
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:28.040]  we want freedom we know when we read the headlines not just at info wars dot com but just all over
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:32.520]  the world and what we see in our everyday life report us ground troops clash with islamic state
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:37.480]  fighters pentagon announces increased military activity on russia's border state reps slam

[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:24.280]  countries seven years ago i made the obama deception or six and a half years ago we predicted
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:30.200]  the african invasion under humanitarian claims because it was in pentagon reports we predicted
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:37.640]  the attack uh on uh areas like ukraine they're now cutting off russia's gas pipelines they're
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.960]  routinely getting blown up it doesn't matter that russia has its own corrupt issues they're not

[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:32.040]  they've taken a economy that was growing and people that were upwardly mobile and embracing
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:38.280]  capitalism and freedom and promoting families and family values and they've turned it back into
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:43.960]  a polar bureau soviet-style system because it's the only way they can survive just like the globalist
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:49.720]  attack this is their radical islamic system 9 11 so that they could then take our freedoms in a
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:56.840]  response to that attack this is the master plan just like army trips we'll be right back we're

[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:23.320]  the next day david night sitting in doing a fabulous job i get so excited when i've been
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:27.640]  gone just a few days and i think the one reason our broadcast has been so successful
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:35.240]  out of many but the biggest is i am excited i am passionate i'm not in this normal c bias mass
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:41.720]  dot com syndrome i'm going to take it attitude and i thought about who we resonate with you know
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:46.120]  they call us a niche audience well everything's about the media today well i don't think of freedom
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:51.880]  and private property and and due process and family and the rights of self-defense and men
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:56.680]  being brought up to defend themselves and women being brought up to defend themselves and police
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:02.520]  working for the locals and following the constitution and not starting fights and wars with russia
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:09.880]  so so we can turn them into a bigger tyranny than we are i don't call that a niche issues i don't
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:16.600]  call devaluation of the dollar a niche issue but the liberty movement has been a niche that's all
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:21.000]  these cynical corporate people see it they're always good job i go to radio conferences and stuff
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.200]  you really know how to work that niche audience what i'm here to do is to work this audience into
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:32.440]  waking up other people to defeat the new world order takeover that's happening because i don't
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:38.440]  want to be a slave what is it that all the cynical corporate people out there cannot get
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:45.080]  there's real things in this world the globalist are enslaving us the globalist are messing with
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:51.800]  the food supply they are they are biologically and chemically engineering us all the major
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:59.000]  bt crops kill 90 plus percent of the rodents by the third generation i'm going to say that again
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:04.920]  the ones that live have tumors all over them and are mentally retarded i'm going to say that again
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:12.360]  why do they test drugs and foods on rodents and pigs because biologically rodents and pigs
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:18.760]  pig hearts transplant better than baboon hearts and humans they test on pigs and rodents because
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:25.560]  biologically they're the most similar to us what a poison does to a rat it does to us what
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:33.880]  a poison does to a pig it does to us and the gmo food that they are feeding all of us kill the
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:42.520]  lab animals look it up kill the lab animals now again bill gates has said he wants death panels
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:48.600]  he said at ted tv talk that he wants to reduce human population down to zero we can play that
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:54.840]  clip everybody laughs because they're in the in group so call me a maniac call me crazy you're
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:02.760]  right you're right bt corn from monsanto in german u.s and canadian studies has been found to explode
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:08.520]  the little guts of little honey bees and is the main contributor that with frequency pollution to
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:15.560]  them being almost 80 dead in areas of north america okay on average is over 60 in fact the numbers
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:21.080]  are higher than that they're always changing look it up is that alarmist you bet because it is
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:26.440]  alarmist it is a crisis and that's all i'm trying to get at here folks is that i do this every day
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:31.560]  so i get very familiar and comfortable sitting next to this data that is so devilish and i take
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:36.360]  a few forced days off to take care of other corporate issues family issues you name it that
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:41.800]  have got to be dealt with because we're going to the next level and it makes me realize that i am
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:47.160]  becoming comfortable with it and i think that's what this personal rant is about today before i
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:52.680]  go to some news the next segment with david night is that the news is even the best of us start getting
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:58.280]  comfortable with this and i'm not going to get comfortable with my incremental soft kill that's
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:03.240]  why the globalists do all this stuff is a creeping corporate death but the good news is a lot of
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:07.400]  corporate people and a lot of folks in the actual strata of the system are waking up and i'll tell
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:13.160]  you who's really waking up our military and our police i'm not kissing their butts when i'm the
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:18.840]  guy that wrote the book quite literally on the police state and how it was coming we lost that
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:26.120]  battle it came but but because we warned everybody along with jack mclamon so many others that it
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:31.400]  was coming now they listen to us when it came and who do you think really listens they go my god
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:37.320]  i was shown saw this 20 years ago jack mclamon saw this 30 years ago oh my god all these general
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:43.160]  partners saw this 20 years ago all these other people saw this warned us now it's coming true
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:47.640]  and everything they keep telling us keeps happening yes not because we're that smart we
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:53.560]  have the documents we publish them we show you this is a plan so now i've converted over as i've
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:58.840]  got more sophisticated before i was like how dare you be part of this to now saying hey you better
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:04.280]  wake up this will destroy your freedom as well and they're listening but meanwhile they're trying
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:09.800]  to hire as many bad cops as they can just like they you know try to promote radical islamists
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:13.240]  so they didn't have an excuse to go under the middle east and they're trying to train cops in
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:18.680]  some departments the tasers 76 year old people that argue with them over an inspection sticker
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:26.280]  so that the public then hates the police and so that we then get in a culture war with them
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:32.280]  and the globalists have just divided and conquered again so i know we can win this fight we come back
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:36.600]  i want to get david night's personal experience because i didn't plan this today i'm gonna get

[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:29.400]  jones alex thank you david i've settled down a little bit it's just that sometimes it hits me
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:37.880]  just how epic this is while we're all busy watching college and and nfl football the west that is the
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:42.920]  criminal bankers not the red white blue the red white blues been captured overall by the enemy
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:47.560]  they're not trying to capture us individually capture our towns our police our our our states
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:53.720]  but the globalists in their their methodology their their their corporate system of anti-free
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:34:00.360]  market consolidation is starting war with russia they've driven down to world prices not to help
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:05.720]  start western economies but to bankrupt russia that was trying to keep world prices down by
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:12.920]  undercutting opec so there's a price war going on just like walmart will move into a town for five
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:17.960]  years and sell stuff at a loss and then after all those stuffs bankrupted they have computer
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:22.760]  actuaries this is this is public it's been books written on it and then they jack up the prices
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:28.600]  they do it to suppliers too they come into an area and they say uh yeah we want you regionally you
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:33.320]  know say 10 different outfits there's been lawsuits over this to produce eggs sign a contract for five
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:40.120]  years and the contract hasn't out for walmart within two years there's a lot of eggs the people
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:44.600]  didn't know it was a manipulation most of them go out of business and then they'll have one or two
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:54.040]  suppliers that will sell them eggs just to not go bankrupt at cost or below see this isn't free
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:35:00.200]  market this isn't capitalism this is vulture capitalism but disqualifying most people so
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:06.600]  they won't be against it by making them dependent and i know you know that as an audience we've
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:11.560]  got to get these basic truths out to everybody else and the good news is you didn't hear these
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:17.080]  topics talked about five years ago on mainline talk radio now you do you didn't hear this stuff
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:22.920]  talked about on cnbc five years ago now you do don't international bankers secretly rule the
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:27.960]  world aren't they in full control panel doesn't the economy not matter now they control all the
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:32.600]  currency and credit and keep it for themselves and we now are just their slaves and they go through
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:37.400]  all five people on the panel and they go absolutely we are slaves to international world bankers
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:44.200]  who've taken over by fraud oh but alex jones is a cook and ron paul's a cook oh and ellen
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:49.400]  greensman published essays and books i've got some of you know look those up and into a whole
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:54.920]  report on them i forget the names his essays them two or three books well that's right he co-authored
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:36:01.480]  one with ron paul i forgot he was he was a group of essays in a book put out by the who was the
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:05.960]  founder of the libertarian party we used to have him on he died a few years ago the point is he put
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:10.440]  a book out with ellen greenspan and ron paul see oh see ellen greenspan is kind of like
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:16.200]  darth vader see he joined the dark side this is what i'm getting at this is not my opinion well i'm
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:21.640]  never joining the dark side ladies and gentlemen and if you don't fight this and speak out against
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:27.880]  it as new listeners you have already joined it your silence equals consent folks this is a planned
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:35.080]  total screw job total evil takeover and everyone knows it or you're living on the moon
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:39.720]  so all i can say is there are efforts out there to shut down freedom on the internet
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:45.960]  zuckerberg publicly met with the internet censor czar from china the whyhouse met with him
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:51.880]  they're moving on us right now because they know you're waking up that means we've got to fight
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:56.600]  that much harder we have a chance to really turn the corner on this does it mean we're gonna win
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:03.640]  look it's a process yes we'll win by them not getting their full world government in place
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:08.680]  so we can start reversing their gains and they're going to keep fighting because they know how to
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:15.640]  make money and have power out of fraud the leopard doesn't change its spot the reason evil's taking
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:22.280]  over is that good people have gone to sleep we don't change our spots either but if we could be
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:28.280]  mesmerized and put under a mind control spell that's what the globalists call it they call it a
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:33.880]  high tech in their marketing manuals i've seen a spell they put a spell on the public they get
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:39.160]  your kids with a certain beat in music when they're 10 years old to then be brought into their culture
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:44.920]  so they can be corrupted so that they never attain higher awareness again it's all being
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:51.240]  scientifically done and the very people doing it will admit they're doing it but saying hey i want
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:55.640]  to make a million dollars a year and work for the system but boy i feel terrible about what i'm doing
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:00.520]  and then their kids end up being screwed up their kids end up committing suicide ladies and gentlemen
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:07.800]  the wages of this system is collapsed the wages of this system is evil and and none of us are
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:15.400]  perfect but the point is we've been right we're right today we're on target and we need everybody
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:20.600]  to take this information to get it out to everyone they know 20 years ago as i've said a thousand
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:27.240]  times maybe one out of 50 people knew that the fellow reserve was set up in 1913 a foreign owned
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:34.280]  subsidiary of ross child and uh dutch royalty and british royalty was some rockefeller ownership
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:42.680]  some uh aster ownership some uh you know of those blue blood family ownership you can look it up
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:48.360]  now almost everyone once it audited in national polls over 90 percent or wanted abolished and
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:53.640]  though it's really private again it went from no one knowing it's this giant private fraud
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:39:01.560]  to almost everyone knowing it went from ron paul 20 years ago couldn't get one cosponsor to repeal it
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:07.720]  but now it's passed the house two times and they've killed it the senate but this time the
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:12.360]  republicans have enough people to pass it they probably politically won't because they're being
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:17.800]  blackmailed so we'll just put more tea party people in there the point is we've gone from no cosponsors
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:24.440]  to it passing the house you see nothing can stop an idea no army can stop an idea whose time has come
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:30.600]  that's why they don't want to have an idea fight before we fully win the idea revolution they want
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:36.280]  to kick off a civil war that i continually warn about because they've got a chance to win that one
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:40.680]  because they'll play us off against each other and i just got chills and that's not a bad effect
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:45.560]  when i say that i mean i get chills when i talk about this because i'm giving you the enemy
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:51.320]  battle plan to enslave us and bring us down we have the enemy plans we have the death star
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:56.200]  plans ladies and gentlemen and we've got a lot better chance than the fictitious x wings and an
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:02.840]  imaginary universe to take it out we can bring them down every one of you is a little x wing out
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:08.280]  there exposing the new world order exposing the globalist exposing their program exposing their
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:14.760]  plan exposing eugenics exposing abortion exposing plant parenthood exposing i wouldn't
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:23.160]  saw a movie last night with my children i'll do a review later it was uh the hobbit the five armies
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:26.520]  i just thought it was a two and a half hour video game i mean it was entertaining but just
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:30.520]  it's not as good as the others because it's just so cartoonish now it was just a two and a half hour
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:35.560]  battle scene basically certainly entertaining but i felt like i've been brainwashed at the end of it
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:41.480]  they had an ad at the beginning of it about martin lucer king the movie looked interesting
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:47.240]  but but notice how it's all perfectly timed it's all about rising up and stuff and it's gonna make
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:53.720]  people get really angry and re invoke bad stuff that went on you know 40 some years ago notice
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:41:00.920]  right on time when all the race war stuff is being promoted this is all it's been declassified
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:06.360]  that the cia and the justice department give initiatives in hollywood we've played the clips
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:10.920]  of the attorney general saying we need to brainwash the public about guns we said literally
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:17.160]  brainwash them well let's go back it's the same thing on race once you know all their programs
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:21.080]  you can see them trying to start a war with the police and have the cops start a war on us
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:26.120]  you can see them bringing in the racial component you can see them dividing us along straight gay
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:31.160]  not that there aren't issues from different perspectives out there that are going on the
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:37.960]  point is is a distraction from the larger takeover that's happening the battle against world government
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:44.680]  is raging we're going into secret trans specific partnership treaties where they've leaked pieces
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:49.880]  of it and it's it's it's total end of internet freedom corporations ruling congress beyond
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:56.280]  fast track it's all happening they just don't tell you about it it's buried in the back of
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:04.040]  congressional statements and legislation this show is about bringing out these topics and
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:09.880]  presenting them and then it turbocharges the broadcast that i happen to be totally freaking
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:15.560]  out about it because that's a normal reaction and then that gets people who who are who are in an
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:20.680]  unconscious state to kind of go away this sounds like a guy running about football see see they
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:25.320]  make football all interesting on espan with all these guys in suits and they're talking about every
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:30.600]  angle of it but like it's a military operation to take up the areas in the male brain that are for
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:37.000]  strategic planning warfare business you name it so that we're all busy playing fantasy football
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.680]  and and fantasy video games living in a false reality i mean i see all these sony playstation
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:47.560]  ads about you know be somebody dare to be great you know all these slogans they've got about
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:53.480]  you can do great things you can do epic things ladies and gentlemen you can do epic things
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:43:01.480]  right now against a worldwide elite that is creating robots to replace us putting total real time
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:11.320]  internet systems into everything so there's an internet of things not to empower us but to
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:17.960]  control and predict reality and then steer reality you can already order on amazon it orders it before
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:23.320]  you order it and sends it to you you go into pizza places now it face scans and retina scans
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:29.640]  you and tells you what pizza you wanted to order by what your eyes looked at i told you 15 years ago
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:34.040]  that i was in a dharma facility at the university of texas has shown this stuff when it was secret
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:39.960]  i'm record i mean films about it it's coming the total takeover the takeover of your psyche the take
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:46.440]  over of your children's souls the takeover of your free will my god whenever i see that 1950s
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:52.600]  body snatcher movie where i mean it was body snatchers it'd be easier because they're not human
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:58.040]  this is our own people doing this to us he's gotten out of the small town he's running up to the
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:02.360]  interstate he climbs up the back of an army truck he's warning everybody they shove him out the back
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:07.720]  he climbs back in and there's pods in the back and he jumps he goes oh my god they're everywhere
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:14.360]  you've got to warn everybody they're calm that's how i feel because it's all on record what they're
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:22.840]  doing it's so diabolical there's no good will in it it's all done savagely and coldly and viciously
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:28.040]  like humanity deserves to be overwritten by this whole thing and i'm just sitting here desperately
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:33.880]  trying to warn people not because i'm a hero but because i'm i'm a deer in the headlights saying
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:38.440]  my god we better get out of the road here we're going to get run over now i know i'm ranting
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:42.440]  this is what happens when i'm gone a couple days i want to get your take on this while i settle down
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:47.400]  a little bit and your view on what i was asking you earlier uh david night and i'm going to hit a
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:50.520]  few new stories and get out of here because i know you have that state rep coming up we're
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:59.000]  going to send our reporters out there to the sheriff's department where the state rep is slamming
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:04.200]  them because there's a big protest coming up and a lot of people would say you know what's the point
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:12.040]  of sending people out to one sheriff in washington state well when we first started interviewing
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:17.080]  the sheriff of milwaukee saying armed people that's what makes you safe then the head of
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:22.120]  interpol came out and said it and then all these other sheriffs and police chiefs came out who
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:26.280]  didn't know they had the political support and who would have been targeted and were being targeted
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:32.360]  by bloomberg we came out and made them made them celebrities like they should be we came out and
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:37.320]  held them up that's a real celebrity a man that does the right thing and stands up against bullies
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:44.360]  like bloomberg and others not not some basketball player the sheriff up in milwaukee county is a
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:49.800]  hero he's been on our show before not somebody like michael's word i'm sorry it's just that that
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:55.320]  sheriff's a hero putting his job on the line to do the right thing in the face of the globalist
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:46:00.920]  conversely you get a sheriff like this saying i need this to take on the constitutionalist
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:05.880]  and we're gonna try to get him here on the show well then that's somebody who we need to point out
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:12.680]  it has it wrong and we need to protest it to let people know as veterans or gun owners or christians
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:17.320]  or libertarians or conservatives we're not going to let you list us like hitler listed the jews
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:21.240]  or other people as an enemy to be rounded up we're not going to sit there while you prepare
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:26.280]  for full out war with us hoping we start something with you putting provocateurs into our ranks to
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:31.640]  do it i've had it done to me more than a hundred times more than a hundred times i mean i put up
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:36.200]  with this and i'm sick of it that's why we don't want police getting hurt we don't want to have a
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:40.600]  war with the military but we don't want you like Katrina to come take our guns we don't want you
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:44.680]  to follow orders that are unconstitutional they're going to start a civil war that's why we're
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:48.520]  protesting the first amendment with the first amendment that's why we're going to congress
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:52.120]  that's why we're taking over the states that's why we're taking over the congress we're going
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:57.560]  to try to have a peaceful restoration of the republic david night yeah alex we're going to
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:02.360]  have that representative on in the next hour from washington state one of the things that he said
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:06.920]  that i thought was troubling in the interview last night he talked about this sheriff having the
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:13.960]  southern poverty law center and to work with his deputies the things that he said in terms of trying
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:23.080]  to tie the bundy ranch to these guys who shot police officers in nevada that's coming straight
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:28.600]  off of the script from the federal government from homeland security we already knew when you hear
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:33.480]  that sheriff open his mouth it's adl southern poverty law center well who are the adl they got caught
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:37.800]  breaking into police stations getting all the data they've been convicted of it they've lost
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:43.080]  libel suits they'll defend george for us and give them awards but you know call me stuff
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:49.080]  in particular southern poverty law center they came out in federal court repeatedly that they ran
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:54.440]  in hella him city the nest where mcvay prepared everything and that's on record and when the
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:48:00.600]  real federal informants wouldn't lie and said yeah no we trained them they indicted them federal
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:05.640]  informants with no criminal record okay and i've interviewed the police officers everybody involved
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:10.920]  who knew about it so just remember folks the southern poverty law center means business they're
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:15.480]  not a bunch of little liberal dope smokers that care about black people up there they're a hardcore
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:21.400]  intelligence operation who is on our butt sorry go ahead yeah absolutely anybody can be a victim
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:26.600]  of this kind of propaganda i mean this is obviously southern poverty law center is a part of the
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:31.400]  federal propaganda and there's a lot of law officers out there who are victims of that kind
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:35.800]  of propaganda this sheriff's deputy who who mentioned constitutionalist that was something
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:39.720]  that he had been taught that was something that they had fed him they didn't just come up with
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:44.760]  that word out of nowhere so these guys so the question is are they victims of propaganda
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:50.440]  or are they propagating the propaganda let's be clear the feds just like the globalist fund
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:55.480]  al-qaeda and and and isis and now and our army has to fight him you know what i'm about ten years
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:49:00.040]  ago an army soldier go you're saying 9-11 isn't real and i've been i've been i've got part of
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:05.320]  my leg blown off fighting al-qaeda in afghanistan and i said no i said that's not what i said if
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:08.680]  you ever heard me he goes no i just heard about you on national television saying you said that i
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:13.240]  said no i said our government funds and protects these people sets them loose and then you've got
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:18.920]  to go fight them for real i know they're real i had a guy calling once when i was on a another show
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:24.440]  and say man i got shot in iraq are you saying 9-11 didn't happen i said i didn't say that i said our
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:29.960]  government stood down and funded them and now look how they openly fund isis look at how they're
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:35.160]  openly turning them loose in syria and other areas and then our army has got to go fight them
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:41.560]  when they then blow back that's a real war that's a real fight going on over there and that's how
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:47.000]  the globalists do it they stir it up they create the big crisis they offer the solution same thing
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.160]  with the police that's where i'm going with this and now they're stirring the pot really big with
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:56.440]  russia with these derivatives and we see everything falling into place as they've ensured their
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:01.640]  derivatives again we see them increasing the risky loans that they're doing we see them
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:05.960]  pushing with just three people on the house of the floor three congressmen on the house of the
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:13.560]  floor passing unanimously with a voice vote this 500 million dollar bill to essentially go to war
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:19.160]  with russia and impose sanctions on them it's just absolutely amazing to see them push them
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:23.160]  u.s troops in against the border when they did nothing but they get it back to police because
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:27.960]  i was just using the al-qaeda example how we create the enemy the police they federalize them
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:32.760]  they give them the armored vehicles they give them the training then when they use it against the
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:39.000]  groups oh my gosh the feds come in to save the day the same thing the same justice department that
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:46.680]  has its hand up the you know you know puppet area of the southern barbie law center is the same one
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:51.240]  then demonizing the police everywhere i mean i hope the cops are smart enough to figure this out
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:55.560]  oh yeah i think so we got to go to break alex we're going to be right back with alex jones

[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:41.480]  red and blue team basically to kill each other and just following the orders like a bunch of morons
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:47.960]  all the global social engineers as you said are getting all the laws passed bigger than 2008
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:53.080]  to implode the next derivatives bubble bring in the next big global recession
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:58.760]  that'll totally bankrupt russia hurt us bad and then they will pose as the saviors when it's on
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:05.000]  record they engineered the 1929 collapse it's on a record that these very same financial interests
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:11.800]  they control all the money so they want to create bubbles that finally pop folks to get your property
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:17.320]  to make you a renter so they can then social engineer you and if they can't get you in a ghetto
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:22.120]  housing project if they can't get you on these government reservations or plantations they're
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:28.280]  going to put in a corporate one this is all about managing humanity not to manage us to empower us
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:33.880]  that'd be bad enough because it attacks free will god doesn't do that we certainly can't do it right

[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:27.560]  texas alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night here in studio we were just
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:35.000]  joined in the last hour by alex jones uh on the road and he was talking about how humbling it is
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:40.840]  to be here as part of this operation and i gotta say for me it's a very different experience i
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:47.080]  didn't build it alex built it and i know this represents something that he has worked at a labor
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:52.920]  of passion that he's worked at for over 20 years i've seen the documentaries before i came here i'd
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:59.080]  seen the internet talk radio all of these things are such powerful tools to wake people up that
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:06.120]  really hadn't been used together in a way like alex use them and the synthesis of all that together
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:11.400]  i think was a very powerful thing a very honest presentation of the problems that were faced with
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:16.760]  i've looked for a long time before i came here i was tried to get active in politics i could never
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:22.680]  get any traction as a third party politics no matter what aspect i worked at it could not wake
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:28.120]  people up it really was an educational issue we were trying to run campaigns as a third party
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:33.480]  trying to educate people and yet it wasn't getting through because it didn't have the kind of power
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:38.600]  that we have now with the internet with documentaries it's very humbling to come here i can't believe
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:43.560]  that i'm here it was bizarre for me to come in here because i had been watching it like many of
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:48.360]  you have from distance and to actually come in here see alex the part of the operation it is a
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:53.640]  very humbling situation and i just hope that uh i don't do anything personally to damage it it's
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:02:01.960]  also amazing to me that alex does not control what we have to say and we all here are pretty much
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:06.120]  on the same page sometimes we'll have different takes on different issues on things and there's
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:11.800]  not a control about that we're allowed to have that freedom that honesty and that's what i really
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:16.200]  appreciate here before we go do you guys have that clip of the sheriff because i want to give a little
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:21.240]  bit of a clip of the sheriff's response which didn't come for like three days after we put the
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:26.440]  article up of course we reached out to him to try to get comment that's not something we have to do
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:30.360]  something we tried to do as a courtesy they didn't respond to that but they criticized us for
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.840]  not getting back to them until late on a friday night and yet they didn't put anything up i believe
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:39.080]  until a following monday nevertheless in the next segment we're going to have the
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:45.000]  representative from washington state matt shea and he's going to talk about his perspective on
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.320]  things there let's get the sheriff's perspective here briefly before to go to break emperor wars
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:59.080]  and alex jones in my opinion this is standard operation procedure they only give you what
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:04.440]  fits their agenda if they you take a look at their site right now
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:12.840]  you will find death threats towards this deputy that remain on that website
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:23.240]  in my opinion that is unconscionable especially when this deputy has 20 years of law enforcement
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:28.360]  service hold that right there i gotta respond to that about the death threats i'm not aware of
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:33.800]  any death threats there they did not contact us about any death threats i gotta say that when
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:39.400]  people put death threats up on our site we take that down if that doesn't get taken down or even
[02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:42.840]  availed death threat one of the first experiences talking about coming here to info wars one of
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:48.680]  the first experiences i had uh was answering the door to the secret service because somebody had
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:55.800]  made a veiled threat to the bush family and it was really very very obscure this it wasn't like
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:04:00.680]  i'm going to find these guys and shoot them it was very obscure uh came here demanding to know
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:05.240]  who had posted that don't put that on the internet that's stupid people who put that on the internet
[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:11.560]  or either idiots or their feds so i don't know if he saw some death threats on there i'd like to
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:16.120]  get him on we'd like to talk to him uh we're open to talking to the sheriff would like for him to
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:21.240]  make his case he wants to say that what we have is standard operating procedure that we have a
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:27.000]  biased presentation of what's going on how about the southern poverty law center that he invited in
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.680]  to talk to his deputies maybe he ought to compare notes to see who's right are we right
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:36.040]  is the southern poverty law center right i don't know we're going to talk to
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:40.200]  matt shea a representative for washington say who lives in the area he's going to talk to us

[02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:34.040]  having the m wraps when asked why do you need that in a small town he said well we need it for
[02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:37.800]  the constitutionals we have people who have lots of weapons and ammunition around here
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:43.480]  and then of course after we put that up a couple of days later the sheriff in that area posted
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:53.000]  this video and comment to that info wars and alex jones in my opinion this is standard operation

[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:12.120]  you will find death threats towards his deputy that remain on that website in my opinion
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:20.680]  that is unconscionable especially when this deputy has 20 years of law enforcement service
[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:28.040]  has a medal of valor and has served his nation in the united states military okay let's get alex
[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:32.920]  jones's comment has he heard this in the uh segment five after and it got his blood pressure up
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:36.200]  like it got my blood pressure up alex you want to tell me it's funny i was talking to the guys
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:40.520]  earlier and i said hey i haven't seen the sheriff's response yet but we should play it i know we're
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:46.440]  trying to get him on since you know since this broke over the weekend and then i heard you play it i
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:49.560]  hadn't even seen it i just said well i want to hear what he has to say so then i heard you play
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:56.040]  that so we just played it again but that is a total southern parvy law center 100 percent justice
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:10:01.240]  department obama written style deal i mean you know now they admit they're being run by the southern
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:08.360]  parvy law center that's a justice department spinoff and it is just insane listen ladies and
[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:13.560]  gentlemen you go to cnn's website you go to youtube there's every threat every mindless garbage we
[02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:21.160]  use third party discus that's one of the biggest third party commenting systems that almost you
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:27.160]  know behalf the other people use literally it's just huge and that has the moderators everything
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:33.160]  by them we got this out of house a few years ago because we learned in many cases the feds
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:39.240]  were going in and posting threats to then put it on msnbc and things and as soon as we did that they
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:44.600]  quit because we realized it was a vulnerability that we had our own commenting system through word
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:50.520]  press that was on our own servers goodbye to the fbi goodbye to the secret service you know coming
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:56.360]  by was subpoenas wanting this and that and i'm telling you folks they've caught the army doing
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:00.840]  this before it's been in the news you know just like they catch people in their own dormitories
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:04.760]  putting swastikas on the wall or putting the cross in their front yard most of the black
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:09.320]  churches get burned down it was you know it's to get sympathy usually when you some woman a white
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:13.640]  woman you know carved stuff in her face and says black guys do it the cops really know she did it
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:19.800]  or vice versa i mean these cases happen constantly there are probably a lot of hotheads shooting
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:24.520]  their mouths off that's just part of the internet but but also we've got to look at them they're the
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:29.080]  ones saying we're all violent they're preparing for a war with conservatives and libertarians
[02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:34.520]  and constitutionalists when they swear an oath to the constitution we know that demonization is
[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:39.080]  going on so instead of answering why they're getting armored vehicles why they're training for war
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:45.560]  a shooting war in their words with us instead we have a middle of valor well that's not in the
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:49.560]  marines is it his congressional medal honor no i don't think so sure it's some department
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:54.760]  medal of valor for swat team right the point is just like they give you a drone pilots awards
[02:11:54.760 --> 02:12:02.040]  he's sitting there sitting there crafting this for local tv in the community listen for war he's
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:07.160]  the most respectable fan i've ever seen my service they won our office
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:16.680]  i mean they they just put that out to demonize us just like he demonized us with his deputy
[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:20.040]  saying it's for the american people when anybody who actually listens to this show
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:24.920]  those we show both sides but that there isn't two sides to the federal government arming
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:28.920]  to the teeth against the american people and putting out tens of thousands of armored vehicles
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:33.720]  5000 m reps the last three years and and all the rest of it and it's not even the equipment
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:39.320]  there's the problem overall it's that it's they're preparing them for a war and they go back to this
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:45.720]  quote now i don't see they're violent i've never seen nothing like it it's just despicable they want
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:52.760]  a war with us they that alex jones that info wars you know all we're doing is getting them wrapped
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:58.600]  prepared to fight the constitution and they all like you know i never heard no one like that my
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:04.360]  love you know he's he's probably been putting that accent on it sounds so fake i'm here and i'm real
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:09.560]  deliberative and i'm talking to you and i'm telling you right now partner you're not about the
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:15.400]  scalp our men women and children we're under attack from info wars you save us out there
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:20.440]  of them no no no all over the country they're trying to brainwash police most police are seeing
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:25.960]  through it and it's backfiring we're here trying to defend local police from the justice department
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:30.600]  in an attempt to start a war between the people and the police everybody knows that our message
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:35.160]  is non-violence but every time the southern barbie law center has a sock puppet they just say we're
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:40.600]  violent violent violent violent and when he said that i want you to go to the the representative
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:45.480]  of the state rep you have there uh to give us his take i'm i'm just so sick of this and you
[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:49.960]  can play more of his clip but but i was told that the sheriff's been calling you know asking
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:55.640]  we're going to play the full quote of the quote officer absolutely i mean the point is is that
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:00.600]  this is a tactic they use it's like art a saveta the awesome police chief who i think overall is
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:04.440]  a good guy i don't think he's a bad guy he's got a lot of good things from the department but he's
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:08.760]  done a lot of bad stuff under federalization his blood draw program has been overturned by the supreme
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:15.640]  court all sorts of stuff and and i told him years ago i said i said that is unconstitutional period
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:21.000]  he said no no it's not it is constitutional well guess what it's been overturned that's the exact
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:26.200]  type of stuff and we had the the mayor proteam say when we register your guns we will then confiscate
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:32.360]  them and then one of his supporters started cussing we had the video and the police chief said no that
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:38.920]  was your guy cussing well no art no art we weren't cussing we have the video so so this is a tactic
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:43.720]  to change the subject and i would tell police something you'll get more respect instead of
[02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:49.320]  running tactics and lying about people or misrepresenting you'll get more respect even when
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:55.320]  you're wrong by telling the truth than playing games of tactics so so that is a scripted tactic
[02:14:55.320 --> 02:15:01.080]  to make them look like the victims and see we told you the constitution's bad or we told you we
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:07.880]  need to take say they want to kill us now if lord had it on he didn't say in the comments
[02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:13.080]  they could be making i'm not saying that but obviously anybody could be doing it anonymously
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.680]  no no no no no they're not saying that they're not saying that they're saying it's on the side
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:25.960]  they want to kill us oh boy we need an allergy kind of a terrorist all right i'm gonna stop ranting
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:30.360]  you can finish up david go to the state rep god bless you all info wars.com
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:35.320]  thank you alex yeah we're going to go to state representative matt shea right now and of course
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:41.400]  we reached out to the sheriff we asked for his comment i think that video was first
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:46.680]  put up on the nightly news on friday then of course it was posted the next day on youtube
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:53.160]  that was when michael did the article on saturday they didn't put up that video until the following
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:59.320]  monday they didn't respond to us they posted on facebook we put his responses in we put his video
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:04.760]  and we will have him on to talk to us if he's willing to come on and talk to us but we wanted to
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:09.880]  get representative shea's comments on this because the sheriff said that this was taken
[02:16:09.880 --> 02:16:14.840]  out of context uh representative shea do you believe that this is out of context give us
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:20.840]  a context of what's going on there in spokane county well first of all in spokane valley
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:25.080]  washington we're one of the most conservative constitutionally minded areas in this part of
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:30.920]  the state of washington number one number two the fact that they said this was taken out of
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:37.320]  context there is no situation there is no context where this statement would be justified she asked
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:42.760]  him an open-ended question this deputy and the deputy responded immediately with constitutionalists
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:48.840]  and that people that were hoarding guns and weapons and thank god the people here in spokane
[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:55.640]  valley washington do hoard guns and weapons obviously there's a good reason for them to do so now
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:17:02.280]  and the fact that this guy said this and it is now that i think the smoking gun of what we've
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:07.800]  all kind of believed that there was an agenda especially by the southern poverty law center
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:13.880]  to demonize constitutionalists and that it was bleeding over into some areas of law enforcement
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:18.280]  this is the smoking gun in my opinion and i think we've seen that over and over again we've had the
[02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:22.920]  scenarios from them we've had the literature from the southern poverty law center they're the ones
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:28.440]  going in and propaganda and propagandizing the sheriffs the sheriff's deputies the police chiefs
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:33.560]  the police officers they're the ones who are the front for the federal government but they're also
[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:37.080]  getting these talking points talking about constitutionalists are also getting that from
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:42.360]  the federal government his response he was talking about how his m-wrap was going to protect them
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:47.640]  from gunfire she said why do you need that here in this small town and he said well we've got
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:51.000]  constitutionalists and people with guns and weapons in other words that's the context there
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:57.320]  isn't any other context as you point out why would there ever be any context that would make it okay
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:01.480]  for the police to come after people because they're bitter clingers to the constitution
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:07.000]  is that a is that a crime now in the united states apparently based on on some of these
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.800]  statements but i want to be really clear about this particular sheriff this is not the first time
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:17.000]  that people have had problems in in this area with this sheriff he did have the southern poverty
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:22.360]  law center in a few years ago to train his officers there was a huge outcry in our community and he
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:29.000]  backpedaled very quickly on this but very clearly their training has taken root with
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:34.520]  some officers and some deputies what i do want to point out though is that a lot of the deputies
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:39.560]  the rank and file deputies in the spokane county sheriff's department do not agree with the direction
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:44.120]  that the sheriff is going they didn't agree with the statements paid by that deputy and in fact in
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:50.920]  this last campaign season the deputies association did not endorse this sheriff they went against him
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:56.200]  and part of the reason is because they they don't like this direction where they're you know he's
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:19:00.680]  taking this attitude against law-abiding citizens that he's taking and fostering this attitude
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:04.840]  among his department we're seeing that happen in a lot of different places i mean we saw that
[02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:09.560]  when we had that shooting out in albuquerque new mexico where they shot that homeless man on the
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:14.040]  hill and everybody saw the video footage of that then it came to light that albuquerque
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:18.920]  had one of the highest per capita shootings of any police department across the country
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:25.080]  yet they had a new curriculum that they put into their state police academy and one of the long
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:31.160]  time instructors that said i am not going to teach that new curriculum because that's a shoot
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:38.280]  first curriculum so there's a lot of people from veterans on down who are not going along with this
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:42.600]  new script with these new rules of engagement if you will i want to talk to you right after the
[02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:46.520]  break we've got to go to a break but i want to talk to you also about these comments that were
[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:51.800]  made uh this this came up in the interview last night that we have up on info wars.com at a central
[02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:56.440]  valley high school that the sheriff made where he says with a strike of a pen i can affect your

[02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:22.840]  wednesday december 17 2014 i have on the line with me representative max shea at a washington
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:27.880]  state we're talking to him because of the comments a sheriff's deputy made last week
[02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:33.720]  about his m-wrap saying that he needed the m-wrap to protect him from constitutionalist people
[02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:38.920]  you know with lots of weapons and ammunition these are straight out of the talking points
[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:45.240]  the southern poverty law center and as representative shea has told us to no surprise this sheriff has
[02:24:45.240 --> 02:24:50.360]  a history of bringing in the southern poverty law center but representative shea you said that there
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:55.640]  were uh people there in the sheriff's department rank and file deputies that had a problem as well
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:25:00.120]  as the public with him bringing in the southern poverty law center tell us a little bit about
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:05.720]  that how did they blow the whistle on that to the public they absolutely did and actually i attended
[02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:11.160]  the training personally because i am on the southern poverty law centers dirty dozen of the
[02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:15.400]  dirty dozen of the most dangerous state legislators in the country and i take that as a congratulations
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:21.800]  that's good yeah so i attended the training i wanted to see from my own my own with my own eyes
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:27.400]  and for myself what they were actually training and a lot of their training was calling the
[02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:34.200]  constitution party we the people tea partyers terrorists and actually this sheriff had his
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:38.920]  picture on the bottom corner of the slide presentation and then later tried to say he
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:43.160]  didn't know what was in the training and tried to backpedal which just didn't seem correct and
[02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:48.360]  one of the more frightening parts of the training was when they put the picture up of the leader
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:52.440]  of the we the people movement out of pulmon and called him a domestic terrorist when he'd never
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:58.520]  been charged with a crime at all ever and put his picture on the screen we've shown a video
[02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:02.840]  that was taken at one of these presentations a long long time ago alex has put it in the
[02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:07.720]  documentaries he's shown over and over again on the news on the radio where their training officers
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:14.040]  and telling them that the founding fathers of america were terrorists so you know we don't need
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:18.200]  to go any further than that if they're calling them terrorists and there's the article right up
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:24.920]  there uh dod training manual extremists founding fathers would not be welcome in today's military
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:29.400]  that's where it's coming from it's coming from washington so don't feel bad that they single
[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:34.520]  you out you're in good company you're right there with thomas jefferson well i and i i like
[02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:41.080]  i like i said i take it as a badge of honor i'm a combat veteran i'm pro life i'm pro ron paul and
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:46.920]  pro constitution i'm a gun owner and i'm also a constitutional attorney as well so i think i hit
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:51.560]  everything on their list so i you know we should be proud of that because that's what made america
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:56.600]  great was being a god fearing self-reliant freedom loving person and believing that the constitution
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:01.480]  means what it says i think we have to ask this sheriff and anybody that tries to support him
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:07.000]  and his policies why aren't you a constitutionalist why don't you believe that the constitution
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.560]  means what it says why don't you believe in the rule of law because that's what constitutionalism
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:17.000]  is it's people that support the constitution of the united states the the idea that we have
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:24.280]  inalienable rights given to us by god and also that we are a culture that that believes strongly
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:28.680]  in the rule of law why don't you believe that i think the sheriff has to answer that his entire
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:33.640]  video was nothing but a deflection and trying to lay the blame on other people and really
[02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:38.680]  very candidly trying to bully and intimidate which this sheriff has a past history of doing with a
[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:44.120]  lot of citizens in our community i want to go to your comments about his appearance at central
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:50.200]  valley high school on october 20th was that october 20th of this year yeah october 20th 2014 there
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:55.800]  was a debate at central valley high school government club put on and he said the following
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:28:01.720]  this is a quote this is a transcript from a video of the debate and it said he said quote at the
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:07.000]  end of this debate as his closing statement i with the strike of a pen can affect your freedom
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:14.520]  i can also take your life in certain circumstances well now you you even if that's true why would
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:19.000]  you say it i mean it's and why would you say it to a group of high school students well you're
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:24.520]  intimidating people i mean that's been a lot of what's going on with the new types of attitudes
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:30.200]  that we've seen coming out of law enforcement and in your face intimidation to say i can affect
[02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:37.480]  your freedom and i can take your life in certain circumstances that's really chilling it is chilling
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:43.560]  especially in light of this comment by this deputy in regards to the mrap but it was interesting a
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:50.280]  year prior at the same debate so this is a year before this this same sheriff called out to
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:55.080]  spokane valley city council members as being constitutionalists and therefore dangerous
[02:28:55.080 --> 02:28:59.560]  people and that we should vote against them because they're they're constitutionally minded
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:04.920]  and he actually said that in front of those those kids and those two particular city council people
[02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:10.440]  won but challenged him afterwards on why he felt the need to say that and call them dangerous
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:16.360]  he really is not only drinking the kool-aid but passing it on to other people there when he's
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:21.720]  talking about this constitutionalist as being the enemy now of course in that very long video he says
[02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:27.880]  we we took an oath to the constitution i'm a constitutionalist really when you say that when
[02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:31.560]  you call people out and say they need to be opposed because they're constitutionalists say that
[02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:35.880]  people who identify themselves as being for the constitution are going to shoot you with their
[02:29:35.880 --> 02:29:39.800]  weapons and ammunition that they've stockpiled we're going to be right back with representative

[02:33:22.040 --> 02:33:28.600]  show i'm david night here in austin on this wednesday december 17th we have joining us on
[02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:34.120]  the line representative matt shea from washington state he is in the area where we had the uh
[02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:38.680]  story that went up this last weekend about the sheriff's deputy talking about how he needed his
[02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:44.680]  in rap to defend himself from constitutionalists the sheriff subsequently came on and said those
[02:33:44.680 --> 02:33:49.320]  remarks were taken out of context we have both those videos up at info wars dot com you can see
[02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:54.040]  for yourself whether it was taken out of context we're getting the broader context of what's been
[02:33:54.040 --> 02:33:59.720]  going on there in washington state from matthew shea it's a very chilling story indeed of the
[02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:07.320]  southern poverty law center coming in and uh giving training seminars to this sheriff's uh
[02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:14.280]  department uh sheriff subsequently claiming after other uh deputies and law enforcement
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:18.760]  officers they're complained to the public about this that hey wait a minute we're being taught some
[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:23.000]  really uh bad stuff here about a southern poverty law center because we know where
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:26.760]  the script is coming from we've heard this before we know when somebody comes out and says i'm
[02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:30.120]  i'm training against the constitutionalists we know that's coming from the southern poverty law
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:36.040]  center and of course uh this sheriff himself tried to disavow any knowledge of this he hadn't
[02:34:36.040 --> 02:34:41.160]  looked at the materials before he called them in for training really he also though had as
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:47.880]  representative shea said his picture at the bottom of the slides and i i guess the question is uh
[02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:54.760]  when he himself has called people out in opposition deriding them as constitutionalists who ran for
[02:34:54.760 --> 02:34:59.400]  local government as as representative shea told us it has to call into question really
[02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:04.680]  what they have against the constitution of course we have extended an invitation to him
[02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:09.400]  to come on and talk about this we have put his video up so you can see his rebuttal
[02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:14.440]  and uh we're going to be talking about the the larger context of things before i go back to
[02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:18.840]  representative shea and i want to put in a plug here we have an essential holiday pack which is
[02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:23.480]  uh a special that is running uh actually it was yesterday and today it was a two-day special
[02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:27.400]  alex earlier said uh today and tomorrow so maybe that's going to be extended for one day i'm not
[02:35:27.400 --> 02:35:33.720]  sure but nevertheless it's secret 12 the b12 formula x2 nascent iodine and silver bullet all three
[02:35:33.720 --> 02:35:41.560]  all three for only 59.99 that's 57 off uh three of the most crucial nutraceutical formulas you
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:47.560]  can get that secret 12 survival shield x2 iodine and silver bullet and of course if you order by
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:53.400]  today you can get it guaranteed delivery by christmas and that's how we support our operation we
[02:35:53.400 --> 02:35:59.000]  don't take funding from big pharmaceutical companies or other large corporations so we can
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:03.880]  basically say what we want to without them shutting us down that's the way we fund it uh
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:08.120]  independently and it's a win-win situation for us and for you bringing you high quality
[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:13.640]  nutraceuticals and supplements uh let's go back to representative shea and washington
[02:36:14.520 --> 02:36:20.520]  representative shea i wanted to talk a little bit more about this um uh this law that was
[02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:26.840]  passed as part referendum in washington uh this last election prohibiting amongst other things
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:32.520]  transfer of weapons from one individual to another in terms of a private sale i think it restricts
[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:38.600]  that unless there's a background check is that correct that is correct actually is i 594 and i
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:44.200]  helped leave the charge actually in the legislature to defeat the the bill that was eventually used
[02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:48.760]  is the template for the initiative in in we were in a six-vote minority we were able to defeat it
[02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:56.600]  because it was so bad uh it we call the universal transfer check and taxation because literally
[02:36:56.600 --> 02:37:01.320]  the use tax would apply to every single transfer generating an enormous amount of revenue for the
[02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:07.720]  government on one hand as a tax increase and on the second literally every transfer transfer with
[02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:13.960]  very very few exceptions would be implicated by this initiative and really this initiative was
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:19.640]  bought and paid for by the anti gunners including bill gates who put in a million dollars as i
[02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:25.320]  understand it of his money to help get to this initiative passed a lot of people didn't know
[02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:29.960]  what was actually in the initiative and voted for it because they were ignorant of what was in
[02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:35.960]  the actual uh uh written law it was 18 pages uh long and a lot of people didn't take the time to
[02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:40.680]  read it so it's a really bad precedent for the rest of the country and the anti gunners are
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:45.560]  going to take it from washington and try and export it throughout the rest of the united states but
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:52.440]  literally a veteran going on deployment in the national guard before you cross the threshold
[02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:56.440]  of a base you have to but when you go on a deployment you have to give your firearm to
[02:37:56.440 --> 02:38:02.600]  somebody to hold while you're on deployment and literally that transfer based on how vaguely this
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:07.640]  law is written would be banned and you would have to do that background check for these
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:12.440]  deploying veterans that's just that's just reprehensible that this thing got passed but we're
[02:38:12.440 --> 02:38:17.000]  continuing to fight it i'm introducing the bill to repeal that this session and we're going to be
[02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:22.840]  fighting this tooth and nail at every step now there was a rally that we reported on
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:27.640]  yesterday or on monday uh there was a rally of people saying they will not comply and again
[02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:33.000]  filming themselves doing a transfer here's the gun taking the money uh that sort of thing and
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:37.080]  and even the sheriff if i'm pronouncing his name correct is it nezavich is that his how you
[02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:43.080]  pronounce it yes yes okay he said that he he saw he he was not in favor of this law that
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:48.680]  he opposed it he said it was unenforceable but i i guess beyond whether or not it's enforceable
[02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:54.440]  or not it is certainly an infringement that is that makes it unconstitutional on gun ownership
[02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:58.200]  as well as something that even if they don't go around and enforce it because they're not going
[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:05.240]  to know if there's a private uh transaction a private sale uh once they arrest somebody on a
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:11.320]  charge or no matter how serious or how minor they could always bring this in to trump those charges
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:19.080]  up at a later date that's that's the issue i think really it is the issue that you're not
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:22.920]  going to see anything happen until you know one other crime is committed i think you're absolutely
[02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:27.640]  correct in this and this particular sheriff was on the right side of this issue but you know by
[02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:32.280]  the same token this is the same sheriff who walked out on sheriff richard mac who's the head of the
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:37.080]  constitutional sheriff and peace officer association during our republican lincoln day dinner here in
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:42.280]  spokane county literally walked out on him just before sheriff mac was going to speak and i think
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:47.480]  that the actions here speak louder than the words and yes it is unenforceable but more importantly
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:52.680]  it's unconstitutional and not just in violation of our national constitution but also in violation
[02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:57.640]  of our state constitution article one section 24 which is even more protective of our second
[02:39:57.640 --> 02:40:04.360]  amendment rights so in our right to bear arms so i this this to me is is an issue that we have to
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:09.560]  draw a line in the sand on i know a lot of the people that attended the rally on the other side
[02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:14.040]  of the state they're very good people including representative elizabeth scott who has been
[02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:20.840]  helping lead the fight especially on the west side of the state to get this bill i get this
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:27.000]  initiative repealed now you said he walked out on sheriff mac who is the head of constitutional
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:31.400]  sheriffs and peace officers association tell us a little bit about that i mean why did he
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:37.400]  why did he walk out on on sheriff mac well he felt that that sheriff mac was dangerous at least
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:45.080]  this is what he said was dangerous because uh the sheriff uh can't just unilaterally defend
[02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:50.280]  and uphold the constitution to which many of us responded isn't that what you take an exact oath
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:55.880]  to do absolutely that's why you're elected is to defend the constitution and to go against the
[02:40:55.880 --> 02:40:59.800]  federal government if the federal government's doing something unconstitutional the united
[02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:06.600]  state supreme court in several cases has recognized this vertical check and balance between the sovereignty
[02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:11.560]  of local elected officials the sovereignty of state governments and the sovereignty of the
[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:17.080]  of the national governments and that there's this inherent vertical check so it really fell flat
[02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:21.640]  for a lot of people and a lot of people started questioning his true motives when they heard that
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:25.800]  and that was a couple of years ago that that happened well it seems like anybody that aligns
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:29.960]  himself or labels himself as supporting the constitution this sheriff seems to have a problem
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:36.360]  with whether it's sheriff mac or whether it is uh somebody who's running for a local office uh
[02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:41.400]  labeling them as constitutionalists therefore don't vote for them or if it's some imaginary boogeyman
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:46.200]  that the southern poverty law center has put up on their slides if they like the constitution this
[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:51.000]  this sheriff seems to have a problem with it um let's talk a little bit about the uh the rally
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:56.760]  that's going to happen uh this weekend there's going to be uh one protest down at the spokane
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:42:02.840]  county courthouse at 12 o'clock and that is going to be to protest the implementation of i-594 it's
[02:42:02.840 --> 02:42:06.440]  it's our version on this side of the state of the do not comply rally that happened
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:11.000]  in olympia here in this last week and then after that at two o'clock there's going to be another
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:18.200]  protest out at the sheriff's office in spokane valley against this uh sheriff's defense of the
[02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:23.240]  comments that the m-rap would be used for constitutionalists who stockpiled guns and
[02:42:23.240 --> 02:42:28.440]  ammunition so it's going to happen this weekend both and uh there's a lot of response already
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:32.840]  among the community and i think there's going to be a pretty good turnout i've said many times
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:37.480]  before that i think our best chance to try to restrain the federal government is not going to
[02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:42.600]  be within the federal government itself because it seems to be so uh so corrupt so much power
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:47.400]  concentrated there but a check and balance from outside of the federal government at the state
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:52.840]  and local level and i'm glad to see that there are state reps like you standing at the uh state level
[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:57.320]  who understand the constitution are going to stand against that let me ask you what can we do
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:02.840]  to stop this militarization of the police well i think there's a there's a couple things that
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:08.440]  can be done first of all we have to hold these folks accountable uh and and also ask the question
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:13.480]  do you really need an m-rapper as senator rand paul recently asked do you really need to give
[02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:17.960]  bayonets to local law enforcement what do you need bayonets for we need to ask those questions
[02:43:17.960 --> 02:43:22.680]  and i think that the city councils the the county commissioners at the very local level
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:28.440]  need to not endorse m-raps and bayonets being used and given to law enforcement by the federal
[02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:32.600]  government grant program and stop it that way i think that's one of the ways that we stop the
[02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:38.040]  militarization of police i think the second way we do that is at the state level and we have an entire
[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:42.600]  thing that we call the freedom agenda you can go to freedom agenda washington on facebook and
[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:48.520]  and look at that and the freedom agenda deals with all of these issues everything from the use of
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:53.800]  m-raps at the local level to the use of stingrays and and the use of uh what happened in washington
[02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:59.240]  state where the ncis naval criminal investigative service hacked into a million and a half computers
[02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:06.920]  that was actually broke by info wars uh and in combating the the whole uh issue and not just one
[02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:11.560]  segment of it because it is a lot bigger than m-raps it's basically the attitude that's out there
[02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:16.040]  that there is no privacy anymore the fourth amendment is obsolete and we don't have to comply
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:21.880]  with the idea that people should be secure in their personal effects so and of course we just had
[02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:30.920]  to underscore uh how how dangerous this all is and and i think how futile it is to think that uh
[02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:35.480]  the congressmen are only going to stand against it they just passed a law saying that uh that they
[02:44:35.480 --> 02:44:40.760]  can essentially legalizing this kind of spying they just did that as they came back uh now again
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:45.480]  that uh facebook page was freedom agenda washington we had that up as you were talking about it
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:51.240]  you're talking about limiting their access to military vehicles as as you mentioned uh ram
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:55.800]  paul saying do we really need to give bayonets to our police i would ask do we really need to
[02:44:55.800 --> 02:45:03.080]  give them some of these um nasty quote unquote non-lethal crowd control weapons that the military
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:08.760]  industrial complex is starting to get very ingenious about cranking out this is a huge huge
[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:13.480]  profit center uh the military industrial complex has been funding the war machine that has has
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:18.680]  gotten so out of hand here in the united states now they're turning inward to the united states
[02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:24.200]  and they are coming up with all kinds of new and very nasty weapons for local police departments
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:29.320]  is there some way and i that we can prohibit that at the local level that we can essentially
[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:35.800]  enact maybe a gun control law for these types of uh crowd control efforts at the at the local level
[02:45:35.800 --> 02:45:41.800]  well like elrads or sound cannons were deployed in three separate cities during the whole furguson
[02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:47.000]  issue and in the situation there and i think it's like it's the right question to ask and i think
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:52.840]  the overarching principle or issue is they want us to self-censor and that's the worst kind of tyranny
[02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:59.800]  they want us to be so afraid to speak out or protest or go to a rally that we will censor
[02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:04.920]  ourselves and again that is the worst kind of tyranny so at the local level some of the things
[02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:12.040]  that we can do uh is is literally have our local elected officials not comply with the federal
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:17.000]  government the federal government relies on local law enforcement local elected officials
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:21.640]  state elected officials to just go along with all these federal programs and sign these agreements
[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:26.280]  we don't have to do that we can not sign those agreements we can actually get rid of those
[02:46:26.280 --> 02:46:31.800]  agreements we can put in place a bit a bulwark against what the federal government is trying
[02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:38.840]  to do to take away people's rights and that is how we do it one city at a time one county at a time
[02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:44.120]  one state at a time by intentionally not going along and complying with the federal government
[02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:49.720]  and being their enforcement arm that's what they have to use to enforce this stuff because they
[02:46:49.720 --> 02:46:54.200]  aren't big enough to do it on their own so if local governments fight back county governments
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:59.560]  fight back state governments fight back federal the federal government literally will not be able
[02:46:59.560 --> 02:47:05.160]  to enforce all of these unconstitutional programs and actions that's what we saw in nevada as the
[02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:12.440]  bundy ranch standoff was going on the day that we arrived they had a first amendment area marked off
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:18.040]  and the absurdity of that here you've got this large area that you just drive for hours and not
[02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:23.240]  see anything because it's all federally owned and uh there's there's nothing built out there and in
[02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:27.960]  this little corner of the wilderness as you get off of the exit there's this little area that's
[02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:35.560]  got a orange uh you know utility uh construction stuff marked off it says free speech area and
[02:47:35.560 --> 02:47:40.440]  somebody had put up a handwritten sign said the free speech that that free speech is not an area
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:46.680]  and so these were the actions of the blm the bureau of land management the federal so who'd come in
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:53.240]  and bundy and others were asking them asking the sheriff to exercise his lawful authority there's
[02:47:53.240 --> 02:47:57.800]  a picture of it we got it up there right now absolutely amazing free speech area but you know
[02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:04.120]  representative shea we've seen that at political conventions the last several uh presidential
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:08.840]  conventions on both sides republicans and democrats they have limited free speech to
[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:15.080]  remote areas in the city putting people even in cages so they could come there and stand there
[02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:20.200]  and address each other in this little cage but not address their grievances peacefully in front
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:24.760]  of the convention that's the types of things that we're seeing but in nevada they were asking the
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:30.120]  sheriff to exercise his lawful authority they said the blm doesn't have any authority to come in here
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:35.800]  and rope off an area and say that's a free speech area the governor said so as well so why wouldn't
[02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:41.800]  the sheriff stop that why wouldn't the sheriff stop them attacking protesters tasering protesters
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:45.720]  taking them down to the ground attacking a woman from behind and throwing her to the ground that's
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:51.160]  why they were asking for a sheriff to exercise his lawful authority to protect the people in
[02:48:51.160 --> 02:48:56.280]  his jurisdiction you're very right this is a jurisdictional separation of powers and we have
[02:48:56.280 --> 02:49:01.560]  the sheriff is the highest law enforcement official in the area that's why he's elected
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:06.680]  that's been recognized by the supreme court correctly time and time again that he's the
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:12.520]  chief law enforcement officer in a county and for most counties in this country the federal
[02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:18.520]  government cannot operate in a law enforcement capacity in that county unless they have the
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:24.920]  county sheriff's explicit permission to do so and if the county sheriff just stands in the way and
[02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:28.760]  there are countless examples of county sheriffs doing this just stand the way and say no you're
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:33.560]  not going to do that in my county the federal government has to acquiesce and i want to mention
[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:38.200]  something about the first amendment zone i was there at the bundy ranch proudly and i came back
[02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:43.800]  home and i was giving some presentations on it and one of the questions i would always ask was
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:50.280]  hey is there any reporters in the audience right now and a couple hands would go up and i say
[02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:53.720]  well could you please go outside of the first amendment zone that we have and you could see
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:58.520]  them get physically angry right yeah and then i asked the question no you don't like it do you
[02:49:58.520 --> 02:50:03.800]  then why didn't you report on that uh why didn't the mainstream media pick that up because that is
[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:10.040]  you know that's a blatant violation of the constitution and by a blm and forest service by
[02:50:10.040 --> 02:50:17.640]  the way that had been found by a federal district court judge robert c jones in usv h to be and he
[02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:26.200]  referred him for charges of extortion mail fraud and this this is an agency of the government
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:32.040]  you don't and you don't hear that happening but the last charge was more shocking racketeering
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:37.800]  yes this judge literally referred him for that and this is the same outfit these two agencies that
[02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:43.160]  we're down there at the bundy ranch again just ignoring people's constitutional rights absolutely
[02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:47.000]  we've got to go to break right now we're going to come back with representative matt shea out of

[02:54:06.600 --> 02:54:10.440]  welcome back to The Alex Jones Show on David Knight in Austin and joining us from Washington
[02:54:10.440 --> 02:54:16.840]  state as representative matt shea now he's on because of the video that we received last week
[02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:21.880]  from washington where a sheriff's deputy said he needed his m-wrap to protect against constitutionalists
[02:54:22.520 --> 02:54:28.840]  subsequently the sheriff's department sheriff uh nesovich put up a video on the following monday
[02:54:28.840 --> 02:54:34.040]  saying that uh we were just a conspiracy theory site and using essentially the southern poverty
[02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:39.080]  law center talking points he said a lot of things in that nine minute video we put that up to give
[02:54:39.080 --> 02:54:44.200]  his side of the story but we'd very much like to talk to uh sheriff nesovich he said he would be
[02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:48.120]  willing to come on and talk to us we'll be willing to talk to him would like for him to come on and
[02:54:48.120 --> 02:54:53.320]  make that case and we will uh we'll talk to him about that right now we have representative matt
[02:54:53.320 --> 02:54:59.720]  shea and he's uh been talking about the broader context there of these uh of these comments
[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:04.200]  and we've been talking about how we can get the police under control i think it's a very good idea
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:09.320]  for us to put some kind of a limit on the kinds of equipment that the police need i mean do they
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:15.640]  need tactical nukes do they need uh uh bayonets do they need these m-wrap vehicles i don't think
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:22.120]  they do and i don't think they need a lot of the crowd control methods uh equipment that we've seen
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:27.480]  already as well as stuff that is in the pipeline from the military industrial complex it's a huge
[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:30.920]  profit center that they're coming up with and we're going to see some pretty hideous stuff if we
[02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:37.960]  don't get ahead of this i think our best bet our our our the best way we have to to blockade this is
[02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:44.360]  with representatives like matt shea out of washington who really understand and appreciate the constitution
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:50.280]  don't see constitutionalists as the enemy as the bad guy i wanted to ask you uh representative shea
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:55.880]  in terms of um in terms of excessive use of police force that we've seen over and over again
[02:55:55.880 --> 02:56:01.800]  because this is something else is being driven by the federals uh what do we do about that the
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:07.480]  we've had we've had lawyers on who've talked about this do we do we skip a grand jury for a
[02:56:07.480 --> 02:56:12.200]  police officer and and say maybe if there's a shooting we go straight to an open trials everybody
[02:56:12.200 --> 02:56:16.280]  can see what's going on maybe have an outside prosecutor a lot of people have have talked
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:21.720]  about these types of solutions we need to have some confidence in the system and it looks like the
[02:56:21.720 --> 02:56:26.120]  system is trying to investigate itself how do we how do we get control of that with uh citizen
[02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:30.680]  oversight committees what would you suggest you have any ideas on that i i think it is a combination
[02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:36.440]  of both actually i think an outside prosecutor is is not negotiable in those situations it has
[02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:42.040]  to be used i do think that the citizen rights review board should be a part of this and not
[02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:47.160]  just talking about when there's an officer involved shooting but also uh where we're talking about this
[02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:52.440]  issue of the attitude you know the constitutionalists are the bad guy that citizen rights review board
[02:56:52.440 --> 02:56:57.640]  could also review training curriculum uh and and ask questions if the training curriculum goes down
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:03.000]  the road to the southern poverty law center that citizen rights review board could review all of the
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:08.200]  times that that m-wrap has been deployed uh during a year uh so those those are some things that i
[02:57:08.200 --> 02:57:13.720]  think need to happen but i also think that constitutional rights training by a bona fide
[02:57:13.720 --> 02:57:20.600]  constitutional scholar needs to be implemented obviously in spokane valley uh and that has to
[02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:25.000]  happen as well because without that the attitude just isn't going to change i mean this is a matter
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:28.680]  of right and wrong it's right to uphold the constitution right to uphold your oath and it's

[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:46.920]  to point this out getting in there and having an oversight from citizens as to what the curriculum
[02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:53.240]  is i think that is really vital because that really is the core at where this is going south i think
[02:57:53.240 --> 02:57:58.200]  this is where the federal government is coming in and they're propagandizing police officers
[02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:03.560]  getting them afraid inordinately afraid of the population telling them that people are their
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:08.360]  enemy who are not their enemy is that kind of divide and conquer that is very dangerous i think
[02:58:08.360 --> 02:58:12.680]  it's very very important to have that kind of oversight just before we go tell us one more time
