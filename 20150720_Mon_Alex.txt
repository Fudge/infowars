[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:24.060]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones strap yourselves in and the
[00:24.060 --> 00:29.640]  globalists are trying to orchestrate social upheaval worldwide to bring in their planetary
[00:29.640 --> 00:34.760]  government William Benny former top NSA whistleblower is going to be joining us Wayne Madsen also
[00:34.760 --> 00:39.600]  formerly the NSA to break down the real history of McCain and more and a ton of breaking news
[00:39.600 --> 00:45.880]  today but first John Bounds report on the fact that revolution is imminent in Greece with great
[00:45.880 --> 00:52.080]  reluctance the German parliament has voted in favor of beginning negotiations on the 86 billion
[00:52.080 --> 00:58.320]  euro Greek bailout deal 49% of Germans didn't want to enter talks over the burden of relieving
[00:58.320 --> 01:04.480]  Greece of its 320 billion euro debt the credit control limits on the restriction to withdraw
[01:04.480 --> 01:12.320]  only 60 euros per day will only be eased gradually while the value added tax will rise from 13%
[01:12.320 --> 01:20.160]  to 23% in the next few days raising prices on everything in a country struggling with a broken
[01:20.160 --> 01:28.680]  infrastructure basically the European people paid off the debts of the Greek debts held by these
[01:28.680 --> 01:33.520]  big banks which were charging monster fees and now they're saying okay they're telling Greek
[01:33.520 --> 01:41.480]  people now you have to bail out our bailout and it's coming down to a massive per family interest
[01:41.480 --> 01:47.320]  charges of 10 to $15,000 a year and under Greek salaries it's impossible and they're they're
[01:47.320 --> 01:51.280]  basically going to be taking all these assets in the case of Greece by the way one of the big
[01:51.280 --> 01:57.800]  assets that they were trying to grab is Greece has tremendous offshore gas resources and at the
[01:57.800 --> 02:04.680]  moment obviously the natural gas market has collapsed but believe me they're going to be
[02:04.680 --> 02:10.640]  going after those resources and you know we see in Ireland Ireland actually has gold they're
[02:10.640 --> 02:15.560]  they're going to be going after those resources Spain has resources so basically they're they're
[02:15.560 --> 02:22.440]  draining these nations. Economist John Perkins suggested Greece turn to China's banks rather
[02:22.440 --> 02:29.120]  than kneel to the sovereign sucking IMF and EU monstrosity. I recently met with a minister
[02:29.120 --> 02:34.560]  of state of Ecuador who's very savvy on these things and he said of course we'd rather borrow
[02:34.560 --> 02:37.960]  money from China and I said well don't you think that China's going to turn around and do the same
[02:37.960 --> 02:42.360]  thing he said well we have no idea ultimately what China will do of course but what we do know
[02:42.360 --> 02:48.280]  is that the World Bank the IMF the Europeans in the US have screwed us over and we also know that
[02:48.280 --> 02:52.440]  they've they've overthrown our governments and coups that's throughout Latin America they've
[02:52.440 --> 02:57.400]  assassinated presidents down here including in Ecuador. The Greek people are furious right wing
[02:57.400 --> 03:04.360]  Golden Dawn party member Ilias Cassadarius tore up the bailout deal reflecting the rising anger
[03:04.360 --> 03:11.080]  amongst the people of Greece who voted by 61 percent to reject austerity their wishes were
[03:11.080 --> 03:17.080]  ignored the terms imposed by the euro leaders in the all-night tug-of-war negotiations resulted
[03:17.080 --> 03:23.320]  in Greece surrendering much of its sovereignty to outside supervision legislation must be passed
[03:23.320 --> 03:28.600]  to cut pensions a chokehold on collective bargaining agreements and a continuation of
[03:28.600 --> 03:34.520]  spending constraints basically hell on earth for the lifestyle of an average Greek citizen
[03:34.520 --> 03:40.760]  prime minister Cyprus is now facing nothing short of a revolution think about it how do you sell
[03:40.760 --> 03:50.120]  the death of democracy to the birthplace of democracy the wreckage of the ship of tyranny
[03:50.120 --> 03:59.560]  the ship of death the ship of corruption the ship of fraud the ship that is willing
[04:02.120 --> 04:10.120]  to overturn our world and everything good in it because everything good in it is diametrically
[04:10.120 --> 04:19.400]  opposed to the hellish vision of the controllers with cotton in their ears to the lowly voices
[04:19.400 --> 04:25.400]  all around them the globalists are hastily playing their cards as the eurozone the demon child
[04:25.400 --> 04:32.040]  conceived in the back rooms of the 1955 Bilderberg meetings spirals out of control
[04:32.040 --> 04:39.560]  john bount for info wars dot com as it was designed to do and we return the top story they're calling
[04:39.560 --> 04:46.520]  to end all national sovereignty that's left in the EU as the answer to the EU crisis then the EU
[04:46.520 --> 04:52.440]  itself will collapse and enter the open the planetary government but only after a five to
[04:52.440 --> 05:01.240]  ten year worldwide depression and orchestrated civil unrest i'm alex jones there's no doubt
[05:01.240 --> 05:08.040]  that our country is in serious trouble right now and if you're wondering how on earth we ever got
[05:08.040 --> 05:14.520]  in this situation well i'll tell you how when the democrats showed their true colors you got angry
[05:14.520 --> 05:20.120]  and you elected republicans and then when the republicans showed their true colors you got
[05:20.120 --> 05:26.680]  angry and elected democrats and when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt
[05:26.680 --> 05:32.520]  and that neither side were looking out for your best interest you acted like they were crazy
[05:33.160 --> 05:40.040]  but the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting
[05:40.040 --> 05:46.600]  different results that's why it is vitally important that you wake up america and break
[05:46.600 --> 05:54.680]  the matrix info wars dot com prison planet dot tv and the alex jones show because there's a war on

[06:06.600 --> 06:12.360]  com because the companies i've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't
[06:12.360 --> 06:17.960]  as affordable as they should be so i refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over the

[08:13.800 --> 08:26.280]  alex jones the internet designed by darpa is a real world real time interface meant to track
[08:26.280 --> 08:34.440]  every activity of every human on the planet in real time to be able to predict the future and
[08:34.440 --> 08:44.760]  also manipulate the outcomes of future events it is designed to blackmail and control and suppress
[08:44.760 --> 08:53.000]  the population the last 20 years as we've seen the internet go from being something that only
[08:53.000 --> 09:01.000]  techies were involved in since the 70s to being ubiquitous in every home and every appliance
[09:01.000 --> 09:08.520]  well simply the rollout of the trojan horse glistening and beautiful coming through the gates
[09:08.520 --> 09:18.040]  with rose petals being thrown before its wheels but now in the dead of night as the world hurtles
[09:18.760 --> 09:26.360]  into a new dark age a trap door in the belly is opening and out is pouring the true payload of the
[09:26.360 --> 09:33.400]  the true payload of the internet i want to be clear technology is a double edged sword technology
[09:33.400 --> 09:43.480]  in the hands of good people is a good thing i'm the opposite of a troglodyte but the way it's been
[09:43.480 --> 09:52.440]  designed and and the way the system's been set up is dehumanizing and there's a lot of examples of
[09:52.440 --> 10:04.760]  this today that i'm going to be going over at the bottom of the hour like this one oops cheating
[10:04.760 --> 10:11.880]  website actually madison hacked hackers are threatening to out millions of users 30 plus
[10:11.880 --> 10:16.600]  million of actually madison the dating site for married cheaters
[10:16.600 --> 10:21.320]  37 million clients
[10:29.720 --> 10:37.160]  i read the news every day intensely constantly basically and you know you can also go to the
[10:37.160 --> 10:43.480]  statistics almost all data breaches are by the big banks the government and megasites
[10:43.480 --> 10:48.200]  and then they're the very groups always calling
[10:51.080 --> 10:57.640]  for the casual society and to be a hundred percent dependent on technology what happens when
[10:57.640 --> 11:01.560]  there's a giant x flare that hits the satellites what happens when there's a kerington event
[11:02.600 --> 11:09.000]  and we're totally dependent on gps and robot cars and automation already you see the jobs
[11:09.000 --> 11:15.320]  disappearing because of it as if it's a foregone conclusion we could have built a global architecture
[11:15.320 --> 11:23.160]  and a design model to put humans at the center of technology to empower and enlighten us
[11:23.160 --> 11:28.120]  and instead the globalist openly admit it's being set up to make us obsolete
[11:30.760 --> 11:33.320]  planned obsolescence for humanity
[11:33.320 --> 11:44.600]  and that's the big governing system of our world governed by the Hungarian German royal family
[11:48.920 --> 11:51.400]  slash Romanian royal family
[11:54.440 --> 11:57.480]  that married in with the Rothschilds in the last 200 years
[11:57.480 --> 12:05.880]  and controls much of the planet's wealth a good two-thirds of it and is tax exempt wearing
[12:05.880 --> 12:12.280]  crowns in front of us and being worshipped by every tabloid on the surface of the planet
[12:14.360 --> 12:19.400]  and then it comes out her uncle and her dad and her and all of them Highling Hitler and
[12:21.240 --> 12:25.560]  as if it's news that Edward the eighth was going to be set up as the Nazi king of the
[12:25.560 --> 12:31.800]  EU a German princeling and they're talking about arresting whoever released the film footage
[12:35.240 --> 12:37.640]  of her and her Nazi salute
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.680]  well I mean this was a program so that her uncle could take over
[12:48.360 --> 12:52.040]  Hitler planned to put Edward the eighth first on the throne of England
[12:52.040 --> 12:57.400]  and then on the throne of the EU and then the throne of the world
[13:00.440 --> 13:03.800]  and they have a whole laid out plan how they'd put fluoride in your water
[13:04.600 --> 13:10.600]  how they develop biometrics in 1860 and you gotta hand it to them I mean they're smart
[13:11.240 --> 13:12.360]  devilishly cunning
[13:15.400 --> 13:18.600]  and how do you get a public who doesn't even
[13:18.600 --> 13:27.560]  understand the basics of history or the branches of government to understand what they're facing
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.520]  right next to Hitler in the gray trench coat Edward the eighth
[13:34.760 --> 13:38.600]  on screen with Adolf Hitler at the eagles nest
[13:38.600 --> 13:48.360]  I mean it's even the BBC the EU was a Nazi project and let's be clear
[13:50.840 --> 13:56.120]  the Nazis were one vehicle to establish planetary government
[13:58.040 --> 14:01.160]  who were then set up by the even more cunning elites
[14:01.160 --> 14:09.080]  and used to bring in the United States and the UK elites as the savers of the world and
[14:09.080 --> 14:14.840]  Bretton Woods with the control of the new global currency the dollar and now we come
[14:14.840 --> 14:21.560]  to the beginning the beginning of the end of the dollar and the new global SDR and I've told
[14:21.560 --> 14:27.880]  you for about 18 years of my 20 that the plan of the trilateral commission would be to create
[14:27.880 --> 14:38.120]  three super regions merged them through crises and now the EU
[14:41.800 --> 14:46.920]  is saying get rid of all sovereignty that's left end all sovereignty in the local countries
[14:46.920 --> 14:51.480]  transfer it all into the super state and that will fix the problems that's what the French
[14:51.480 --> 14:58.600]  president and others are saying then the EU itself will be completely imploded and the
[14:58.600 --> 15:03.800]  great planetary regime will be brought in on the back of it but first they're going to engineer
[15:03.800 --> 15:10.040]  world social unrest and divide and conquer infighting the likes of which this rock has never seen
[15:10.760 --> 15:17.080]  but let's go to the latest mark dice video on info wars.com liberal signed petition to support
[15:17.080 --> 15:24.040]  white privilege tax and that ties into Obama and his secret race initiative database
[15:24.680 --> 15:31.400]  that ties into the announcement if you're disabled on social security you will have your

[17:53.160 --> 17:57.880]  reference or anything it really helped out quite a bit. So in other words tax a white man. Yeah it's
[17:57.880 --> 18:03.720]  the white privilege tax to sort of offset the inequality that we experience as white people
[18:03.720 --> 18:09.480]  being born into white privilege. It's you know just a one percent income tax on white people
[18:10.120 --> 18:13.960]  to be redistributed to some of the minority communities and programs so really appreciate

[18:33.000 --> 18:37.640]  it man. You guys deserve that. Aren't you white? Yeah but you know what I've enjoyed the white
[18:37.640 --> 18:40.920]  privilege myself so I'm trying to give back to the African-American community with the white
[18:40.920 --> 18:45.720]  privilege tax. Thanks man. Appreciate that. Appreciate that. All right. It's a new white
[18:45.720 --> 18:55.720]  privilege tax on the Caucasians income. It's just an extra one percent. That's terrible. That's awful.
[18:55.720 --> 19:02.040]  Thank you. I appreciate that bro. Implement the white privilege tax just to help make everybody
[19:02.040 --> 19:07.640]  more equal so the Caucasians will just have a one percent tax added to their income which will
[19:07.640 --> 19:14.920]  help fund programs in the minorities and in the inner cities. Just a quick birth date or print
[19:14.920 --> 19:20.520]  your name. Birth date and a signature. You know when white people are born in America they're
[19:20.520 --> 19:25.560]  born into this white privilege. This program is going to implement the white privilege tax. It's
[19:25.560 --> 19:31.960]  just the one percent on to Caucasian income which will be redistributed into the minority
[19:31.960 --> 19:37.720]  communities so I appreciate you supporting that for equality. Thank you so much. All right man.
[19:37.720 --> 19:44.120]  Appreciate it. I'll get it. So apparently these mentally enslaved morons think that
[19:44.120 --> 19:51.000]  that in order to fight racism they're going to implement a racist policy by taxing white people.
[19:52.760 --> 19:57.240]  You have benefited from white privilege from being in America so we're trying to give back
[19:57.240 --> 20:03.320]  to the minority communities to implement. It's a white privilege tax. Just a one percent. Hold
[20:03.320 --> 20:09.640]  on. It's just a one percent tax with a lot of Caucasians experience white privilege being
[20:09.640 --> 20:15.160]  born in America white. So we're trying to thank you. I appreciate you trying to kind of why do
[20:15.160 --> 20:21.800]  I like that. Thank you. I'm on your side. I'm white. I'm white. Yeah. We're trying to promote
[20:21.800 --> 20:27.960]  this. I'm German. Of the white. We're trying to give back to its offset things so we're
[20:27.960 --> 20:33.960]  implementing a new white privilege tax basically to help kind of bring down and offset the white
[20:33.960 --> 20:41.080]  privilege. We're implementing extra one percent tax on the Caucasians which will be redistributed
[20:41.080 --> 20:48.120]  to help minority community programs. So just print their print birthday and a signature.
[20:50.120 --> 20:58.040]  Well the white people are beneficiaries of the white privilege institutional racism in this country.
[20:58.040 --> 21:05.400]  He knows. And so the white privilege tax. It's just a small one percent tax. Yeah. On the Caucasians.
[21:05.400 --> 21:09.160]  So I appreciate you supporting that. Honestly that's cool that you're you're promoting you're aware
[21:09.160 --> 21:13.960]  of that kind of stuff. Yeah dude. It's just a small one percent. White privilege tax. They can
[21:13.960 --> 21:19.000]  deal with that. You know what white privilege Americans white Caucasians have benefited from
[21:19.000 --> 21:24.600]  the institutional racism in America. And we're trying to implement a new white privilege tax.
[21:24.600 --> 21:29.480]  It's just one percent. I don't want to tax you guys. Just a one percent tax on the Caucasians.
[21:29.480 --> 21:34.600]  What's about you guys. You guys we wouldn't have all this. Well it's time to give back.
[21:34.600 --> 21:39.320]  What are you talking about. It's just a one percent tax on the Caucasians to help you.
[21:39.320 --> 21:42.600]  You're joking. We are joking. You're saying that are.
[21:46.600 --> 21:51.160]  Thank you for not being so stupid and being. Thank you for not being racist.
[21:51.160 --> 21:54.920]  Yeah. We're trying. We're trying to fight racism by being racist.
[21:54.920 --> 21:58.840]  To tax those white. Oh yeah. Oh they want to just tax the white man.
[21:58.840 --> 22:04.680]  And you know. You know. We're going to fight racism by being racist.
[22:04.680 --> 22:09.320]  All right. The full video is up on info wars dot com and mark dice dot com as well.
[22:10.440 --> 22:13.080]  There's a little bit more there. I skipped the network break.
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.720]  Imagine Martin Luther King who said we should be colorblind and judgeable by the content
[22:19.720 --> 22:23.400]  of their character and their deeds which is common sense.
[22:25.880 --> 22:29.640]  Imagine Martin Luther King watching a spectacle like that.
[22:29.640 --> 22:32.360]  But that's what modern political correctness is.
[22:34.280 --> 22:37.880]  And the truth is the West has a very long wicked history.
[22:39.160 --> 22:44.760]  But even the big liberal Jim Morrison said the West is the best in one of his songs.
[22:44.760 --> 22:48.840]  And I don't even know. I'd say the West is the best.
[22:48.840 --> 22:56.280]  I mean maybe the best at limited freedom because other societies and cultures even
[22:56.280 --> 23:00.040]  if they had an elite that was cultured and that had science
[23:02.520 --> 23:09.480]  didn't really want to progress whether it was China or Japan or Mesoamerica or Africa
[23:09.480 --> 23:17.240]  or the Middle East because the ruling elite had set up feudalism and they didn't want
[23:17.240 --> 23:23.400]  an upwardly mobile middle class. And by the way it was the same thing for
[23:24.360 --> 23:28.920]  almost a thousand years during what they call the dark ages in Europe
[23:30.520 --> 23:34.200]  where the elite did not want progress and would basically kill anybody
[23:34.200 --> 23:42.840]  that engaged in mathematics, research, herbology, anything. So the truth is people act the same
[23:42.840 --> 23:49.480]  all over the world. And it's very easy for historians to point at problems in Western culture
[23:51.160 --> 23:55.320]  and then not go study other cultures that did the exact same stuff.
[23:55.320 --> 23:59.640]  Every culture human sacrificed. Every culture sacrificed their children.
[23:59.640 --> 24:02.360]  Every culture started wars with their neighbors and robbed them.
[24:02.360 --> 24:08.200]  Every culture played off tribal differences where it was one African tribe killing another
[24:09.080 --> 24:15.000]  or one Mesoamerican tribe killing the other or one Germanic and Gallic tribe killing each other
[24:15.000 --> 24:20.760]  in Europe. It's been the same story over and over again and I'm not for war.
[24:22.680 --> 24:30.920]  But it was necessity. Inventions basically created out of necessity.
[24:30.920 --> 24:36.440]  They say necessity is the mother of invention. And so Europe had all these endless wars complex
[24:36.440 --> 24:43.160]  wars and a lot of technology did get developed up until the Renaissance. The only technology
[24:43.160 --> 24:51.720]  that was allowed was basically military. If you study people like Leonardo da Vinci
[24:52.440 --> 24:57.240]  and others they couldn't make money painting or sculpting like they could coming up with war
[24:57.240 --> 25:03.640]  machines. And then the middle class started to form. A lot of factors went into that.
[25:04.840 --> 25:09.400]  There was a black plague that wiped out most of the elites in the cities.
[25:11.400 --> 25:18.440]  For the first time in a thousand years labor was valued. And so people were valued again.
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.080]  And so an attitude that humans weren't ugly and bad was embraced. And we saw the greatest
[25:25.080 --> 25:35.480]  period over the next 450 years of innovation invention and light coming into the world that
[25:35.480 --> 25:42.120]  this planet's ever seen. And now if you read the Club of Rome, Council on Foreign Relations, UN,
[25:43.720 --> 25:52.200]  Ecoscience, or turn on television it's the world without people. How much better we'd be without
[25:52.200 --> 26:03.640]  humans? To destroy our life force, to destroy the idea that humans have any value,
[26:06.760 --> 26:15.880]  to destroy that innate upward mobility, master builder, designer, creator,
[26:15.880 --> 26:22.680]  spark that humans have in their heart and in their minds. So that we'll just abdicate
[26:23.400 --> 26:29.960]  our responsibility and our birthright and hand it over to the technological technocrats and say,
[26:29.960 --> 26:34.200]  you know what? We are ugly and bad. We'll just fight with each other here in the dirt
[26:34.200 --> 26:40.680]  and watch civilization unravel and collapse and not rise to the challenge and see humanity go to
[26:40.680 --> 26:45.960]  the stars. We agree with you that we're an ugly brokeback species that isn't even worth moving
[26:45.960 --> 26:52.520]  into the next millennia or even to the next century. And so we're going to let you run the show.
[26:59.640 --> 27:06.040]  How did the British Empire, ruled by European royalty,
[27:06.040 --> 27:17.320]  come about in the 1850s with the current plan we live under today? I made a film about it
[27:17.320 --> 27:21.960]  end game, blueprint for global enslavement. I've talked a lot about Francis Galton and George
[27:21.960 --> 27:34.440]  Bernard Shaw later and all these different type characters, Charles Darwin and the limited pop
[27:37.320 --> 27:41.640]  representation of the public's given, even the so-called intelligentsia.
[27:43.800 --> 27:49.560]  But what really happened is European elites were challenged by the giant middle class
[27:49.560 --> 27:53.480]  and the fast growth of innovation and technological development.
[27:55.960 --> 28:01.160]  And the open dissemination of information and a public that within 200 years of the
[28:01.160 --> 28:08.840]  invention of the printing press was voraciously accelerating their understanding of the world.
[28:09.560 --> 28:16.120]  The rock stars of the age were trailblazers, inventors, men of honor, women of honor,
[28:16.120 --> 28:22.280]  and it was just too much for the establishment to handle. And so they openly went to scientists and
[28:22.280 --> 28:28.360]  said, we're going to buy you all off, develop mind technologies of mind war, as it was called
[28:28.360 --> 28:37.160]  in the 1880s, to bring people back into enslavement, back into an agrarian society,
[28:37.160 --> 28:45.640]  back into feudalism. And that's what Agenda 21 and the UN and UNESCO and all of this is.
[28:45.640 --> 28:54.200]  And they admit it is a new dark age for all of us with our numbers massively reduced with the elite
[28:56.600 --> 29:03.160]  living in high tech, breakaway civilization, technological reservations above the law,
[29:03.160 --> 29:10.040]  tax exempt with diplomatic immunity in their castles, in their techno castles feeding on us
[29:10.040 --> 29:16.520]  outside the gates. And I know that I make that announcement and basically break that down about
[29:16.520 --> 29:23.640]  once a week. But that's because no one else is saying it but them. They're saying what I'm saying,
[29:23.640 --> 29:28.680]  but from their perspective. And so the public needs to understand the great challenge we face
[29:28.680 --> 29:33.720]  and why we're being divided and conquered right now. Now, when we return, I'll get into the big
[29:33.720 --> 29:41.480]  news. The EU dictatorship goes into overdrive. Then the latest on the situation in Chattanooga
[29:41.480 --> 29:47.000]  with protesters on the street saying how dare you cover up that it was radical Islamic attack.
[29:47.000 --> 29:54.760]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:58.840 --> 30:04.680]  Let's talk about the real war on women. First wave feminism was a noble cause,
[30:04.680 --> 30:10.600]  but modern feminists, huh? Well, instead of fighting for, say, paid and protected maternity leave,
[30:10.600 --> 30:18.120]  they want to ban words, shirts and man spreading. Come on. That's cultural Marxism,
[30:18.120 --> 30:23.080]  which asserts that culture and language is responsible for oppressing women and not the
[30:23.080 --> 30:29.320]  state. The truth is the state encourages gender wars. It's a divide and conquer tactic designed
[30:29.320 --> 30:34.760]  to keep us fighting amongst ourselves. In fact, the feminist movement was hijacked by the political
[30:34.760 --> 30:41.080]  class to exploit women. As the late Aaron Russo revealed, the Rockefellers bankrolled feminism
[30:41.080 --> 30:46.200]  and not because they had any interest in women's rights, but because women in the workforce was
[30:46.200 --> 30:51.480]  the ultimate trifecta. The state collects more tax dollars, children are indoctrinated at an
[30:51.480 --> 30:57.160]  earlier age, and the traditional family structure destroyed. Leigh Ann McAdoo reporting for info

[33:19.640 --> 33:28.120]  Well, he's the highest level NSA whistleblower ever, the technical director of the National
[33:28.120 --> 33:34.760]  Security Agency. Formerly, William Benning will be joining us in the second hour to cover
[33:34.760 --> 33:39.560]  the Big Brother rollout, the admission of total surveillance, not just by governments,
[33:41.080 --> 33:43.160]  but by corporations. We'll get into the
[33:43.160 --> 33:51.080]  Ashley Madison hack here in a moment as well, but we'll be talking about that with him.
[33:51.960 --> 33:56.600]  I'm going to get into the latest on the Chattanooga shooting, the hunt for the source of the leaked
[33:56.600 --> 34:00.440]  Royal Nazi salute film footage. They're talking about arresting him.
[34:02.840 --> 34:06.840]  See, because the public doesn't care if it's on record, the King of England was the top Nazi,
[34:06.840 --> 34:13.560]  or that Prince Philip the Queen's husband's a Nazi who says, kill all the minorities.
[34:15.160 --> 34:21.160]  No one dare criticize the actual hardcore demons dressed up in clown suits with crowns on their
[34:21.160 --> 34:26.120]  heads, taxpayer paid for. I mean, these people are bigger joke than Kim Jong-un.
[34:28.280 --> 34:31.480]  Went in, wiped out all the real nobility of England.
[34:31.480 --> 34:36.760]  They're like cow birds that get in a nest and kick out the eggs,
[34:37.560 --> 34:41.800]  then lay their own eggs and then the other, the blue bird or whatever comes back and raises it,
[34:42.680 --> 34:48.680]  but because they were giant monkey suits and in fact, pull up photos of Prince Philip, Queen
[34:48.680 --> 34:55.960]  Elizabeth's husband, Prince Charles's father, the grandfather of these new miscreant children.
[34:55.960 --> 35:00.920]  We're all supposed to worship and fawn over and look at their ugly looking dad with his
[35:01.560 --> 35:08.760]  clown face and they'll be wearing like red uniforms from the 16th century or the 17th century.
[35:12.200 --> 35:15.240]  And then we're just supposed to bow down to it. It's just a complete joke.
[35:16.440 --> 35:21.240]  While this guy and his foundations fund the anti-gun movements, the open borders,
[35:21.240 --> 35:26.280]  all the anti-white initiatives, because if you're an elitist, you hate everybody, not just other
[35:26.280 --> 35:32.360]  white people. You want to dominate anyone who could ever unseat you. You have a predatory attitude
[35:32.360 --> 35:40.920]  to poison everyone but yourself. His cousin, the consort of the Queen of the Netherlands,
[35:40.920 --> 35:45.080]  who died a few years ago, Prince Bernhard, one of the founders of Bilderberg group,
[35:45.080 --> 35:50.520]  was a Nazi as well. And of course, he ran and founded the World Wildlife Fund,
[35:50.520 --> 35:54.360]  that it came out was a front for poaching and selling animal parts.
[35:58.200 --> 36:01.800]  There's nothing the public won't buy. And then look at all their stupid little
[36:01.800 --> 36:05.000]  princelings behind them in their own little military outfits.
[36:07.720 --> 36:08.920]  I mean, this is a joke.
[36:08.920 --> 36:20.920]  Oh, it's been a long time since royalty led the troops in battle.
[36:23.080 --> 36:27.320]  And this isn't even a product of the British Isles.
[36:30.120 --> 36:32.120]  That's what's even more disgusting about it.
[36:32.120 --> 36:37.880]  But the globalists are like the John Carpenter movie The Thing,
[36:37.880 --> 36:40.440]  the remake of the 50s movie that came out in the 80s.
[36:43.720 --> 36:50.920]  They look and act like they're part of the culture of freedom, and they are the opposite.
[36:50.920 --> 37:03.640]  They are the anti-freedom. So we'll get into that as well. You know, we have some of the very
[37:03.640 --> 37:08.520]  best nutraceuticals out there that are really the missing link. Some of them are very complex,
[37:08.520 --> 37:16.760]  patented compounds like the ingredients that are in DNA force. Others are just super clean,
[37:16.760 --> 37:23.400]  super strong, basic staples that are such staples, nobody talks about them or promotes them.
[37:23.960 --> 37:29.640]  Things like X2, Nationia 9, Deep Earth Source, Purist Form blocks the bad halogens, fills
[37:29.640 --> 37:34.680]  up the glands with the good halogens, weight loss, energy, stamina, healthier skin. For me,
[37:34.680 --> 37:39.640]  personally, it's been a complete game changer, a life changer. Everybody can see the difference.
[37:40.520 --> 37:45.160]  I mean, I've lost 60, almost 70 pounds. I've got another 20 to lose, and it's coming off me.
[37:45.160 --> 37:49.000]  In fact, before I leave town, I am going to be going to Europe to cover the meltdown in the
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.880]  next few weeks. I need to take my shirt off again and do a side-by-side from the last photos a few
[37:53.880 --> 38:01.080]  months ago. It is dramatic. Now, standing up straight, I actually have a six-pack. It is
[38:01.080 --> 38:08.840]  unbelievable. I maybe have three pounds of fat left on my back and stomach. Just a tiny little
[38:08.840 --> 38:13.720]  punch right at the front. There's the six-pack right here on the sides, and now you can start to
[38:13.720 --> 38:18.680]  see the six-pack under it. And that's doing the exact same exercise. In fact, less. The same
[38:18.680 --> 38:24.920]  exercise I've been doing for two years, but less than I was doing five years ago. Five years ago,
[38:24.920 --> 38:31.560]  I lived on Lake Travis, and I would get up at 5.30, drink coffee in the spring and summer and fall
[38:32.280 --> 38:39.480]  until the lake got down to about 65. I couldn't swim in the winter, and I would swim from one
[38:39.480 --> 38:46.600]  end of the lake to the other and back. Only once I have the cops go, you need to have a
[38:46.600 --> 38:49.960]  flag with you while you're doing it, and the lake is completely smooth.
[38:51.720 --> 38:57.480]  Nobody out there but fishermen. You might see two boats go by at 6 a.m., and I'd swim over a mile,
[38:57.480 --> 39:05.320]  only take me, I don't know, 25 minutes, maybe 20, and then swim back. I'd get out all pumped red,
[39:05.320 --> 39:13.080]  but fat on my back, fat on my stomach, big arms, big legs, healthy. My heart was healthy,
[39:13.880 --> 39:19.400]  but could not shed the fat. I mean, I shed like 30 pounds doing that. Let me tell you,
[39:20.520 --> 39:25.640]  I'd go hiking maybe once or twice a week, maybe two miles, three miles with the kids.
[39:25.640 --> 39:35.000]  I lift weights five days a week, aerobic style, and I've lost almost 70 pounds.
[39:38.920 --> 39:43.720]  So, it is dramatic, and I could say it's the iodine,
[39:43.720 --> 39:48.600]  supermal vitality when I forget to take it, all these compacted, concentrated herbs,
[39:50.360 --> 39:55.320]  cold-pressed. When I forget to take it, I just don't have the stamina and the energy. It's
[39:55.320 --> 40:00.360]  amazing. Those two products together with things like Beyond Tangentangerine from ForWarsHealth.com,
[40:00.360 --> 40:04.040]  that's the longevity product, but getting all the minerals and trace elements,
[40:05.000 --> 40:11.560]  it all works together. So, infowarslife.com, infowarshealth.com, infowarslife.com to find
[40:11.560 --> 40:16.840]  all of our proprietary products, and I said we'd sell out by Monday. We will sell out today of
[40:16.840 --> 40:22.200]  supermal. Quite frankly, superfemale just has one other ingredient, and it works just as fine on
[40:22.200 --> 40:26.440]  men, but it'll sell out by next week, and X2 will sell out in the next couple days.
[40:28.680 --> 40:33.080]  But you'll be able to get on a wedding list, and it should just be a few weeks till we get more of
[40:33.080 --> 40:37.800]  it in. I want to thank you all for your financial support. We couldn't fund any of this operation
[40:37.800 --> 40:43.720]  without you, and we have free shipping in the month of July on top of all of that. But in the
[40:43.720 --> 40:48.840]  next couple hours, supermal will sell out, but you can get on the wedding list, you'll get an email
[40:48.840 --> 40:53.080]  right when it comes back in, and then you can place your order. That will sell out in the next
[40:53.080 --> 41:00.360]  few hours, and X2 in the next day to two. It was about to sell out Friday, and then it didn't sell
[41:00.360 --> 41:05.400]  really this weekend, so there's a few days left of X2, and I think it'll be gone within about two
[41:05.400 --> 41:13.640]  days. So infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-2533139, and the great part about us being
[41:13.640 --> 41:18.520]  self-funded with products, non-GMO seeds, high-quality sort of radios, Patriot apparel,
[41:20.120 --> 41:24.440]  Pro Second Amendment apparel, is you help spread the word and you fund a hardcore operation
[41:24.440 --> 41:31.800]  while you get high-quality products. So thank you for your support. You can also call to order 888-2533139.
[41:33.320 --> 41:36.840]  We have a lot of other products that are back in. Prostaguard sold out for two and a half months,
[41:36.840 --> 41:43.400]  is back in. The strongest, lowest cost as well, just super high quality, a Prostaguard product.
[41:44.520 --> 41:49.960]  Real game changer there as well. We've got the oxy powder in for flushing out your intestines.
[41:49.960 --> 41:55.080]  We've got the super female vitality. We'll still be in for a few weeks, and we've got
[41:55.080 --> 41:58.760]  brain force to be back in in about two, three weeks. This has been sold out for over a month.
[41:59.560 --> 42:02.760]  We're getting more of the liver cleanse that was so popular in in the next few weeks,
[42:02.760 --> 42:09.080]  so a lot of that stuff is going to be back in infowarstore.com or 888-2533139.
[42:09.640 --> 42:11.880]  Okay, enough on that front.
[42:21.480 --> 42:25.480]  Neighbors would see me. I'm not bragging. It's not that big a deal to swim two miles. There are
[42:25.480 --> 42:29.880]  people that swim 30 miles in a day. In the English channel, when it's like 60 degrees,
[42:29.880 --> 42:35.880]  I couldn't do that. But neighbors would see me or walk over me and say,
[42:35.880 --> 42:41.240]  you swim to one side of the lake and back. It's a little over a mile each way at that point,
[42:41.240 --> 42:46.120]  because the lake wasn't down like it is now. Now it's back up. But they're like,
[42:46.120 --> 42:50.280]  aren't you worried about alligator gar? They're like 10 foot ones in that lake.
[42:50.920 --> 42:57.000]  They've never even been known to attack humans. But still it's scary. Aren't you scared of boats
[42:57.000 --> 43:02.360]  running you over? No, that's why I'd wear an obnoxious red swim cap.
[43:06.120 --> 43:09.880]  Wouldn't dare get out in the lake when people are out there. But it just shows how
[43:11.160 --> 43:17.560]  I'm not governed by paralyzing fear. In high school, we'd go to the beach.
[43:20.280 --> 43:24.440]  And I think it's what separated the boys from the men. Almost all the guys would be scared to go
[43:24.440 --> 43:29.000]  skinny dipping with the cheerleaders. I'm such a deli stories. I feel like I'm ready to go.
[43:29.720 --> 43:33.000]  And of course, the only thing you really had to worry about out out of the Gulf of Mexico at night
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.160]  was not so much sharks. They're out there, but you got a better chance by being run over by an
[43:37.160 --> 43:44.440]  elephant and bitten by a shark is the jellyfish. But I mean, you just can't live in a total
[43:44.440 --> 43:50.440]  culture of fear like being called racist. Oh, you don't support Obamacare. You must be a racist.
[43:50.440 --> 43:54.840]  People have to get through the fear in their lives to really be able to live.
[43:57.640 --> 44:01.160]  Now, I'm a father of three now and have an important mission to carry out.
[44:01.160 --> 44:04.680]  That's why I've never gone skydiving. I really want to go skydiving,
[44:04.680 --> 44:11.320]  but I won't put myself in a risky situation for no reason. I will put myself in risky
[44:11.320 --> 44:18.040]  situations to fight for freedom, to stand up for human liberty. And we need people out there to get
[44:18.040 --> 44:28.600]  outside of their comfort zones and to start getting involved. And I know I'm stating the obvious here,
[44:28.600 --> 44:42.280]  but now is the time. Now, I personally was deeply outraged Saturday. And I really had one of those
[44:42.280 --> 44:53.880]  moments where you're basically hit by a thunderbolt of dismay that the shooter, Muhammad Yuzuf Abdul
[44:53.880 --> 45:03.560]  Aziz, who died and shoot out with police last Thursday. And now a fifth person has died, a Navy
[45:03.560 --> 45:11.160]  member, four Marines, one Navy sailor and three others wounded. And he goes to Kuwait back and
[45:11.160 --> 45:18.280]  forth. His dad's under investigation. He's connected into these radical groups. Yeah,
[45:18.280 --> 45:23.160]  things go bad in his life. He has nothing to lose. So he goes out and carries out a holy war, a jihad.
[45:24.360 --> 45:29.400]  And they get on the news and say, this is not because he's Islamic. This is not connected to
[45:29.400 --> 45:34.760]  terrorism when it was clearly terrorism. I mean, we said the little white degenerate drughead
[45:34.760 --> 45:41.160]  had shooting up the nine black people was a terrorist and was out of control. But see,
[45:41.160 --> 45:48.360]  it's political correctness. He put out tweets that he was going to get the American dogs.
[45:48.920 --> 45:53.400]  ISIS put out tweets taking credit before it was even announced he was Islamic.
[45:53.400 --> 46:04.040]  He tweeted that he was going to carry out an attack 30 minutes before he did it.
[46:05.720 --> 46:10.600]  And then they invert reality and say no connection to Islam. I'm not here trying
[46:10.600 --> 46:13.560]  to demonize Islam. Anybody who's been listening a long time knows that.
[46:15.080 --> 46:19.560]  But when our government and the globalist fund radical Islam to take over the rest of the Middle
[46:19.560 --> 46:25.480]  East and radicalize the rest of that region, bring in record numbers of Islamic immigrants
[46:26.360 --> 46:32.440]  who from Detroit to London, from New York City to Miami are on the news coming out,
[46:33.400 --> 46:37.880]  telling women to wear hoods on their heads and overturning
[46:40.360 --> 46:47.240]  you know, people's tables and getting aggressive and saying you will live as we want you to live.
[46:47.240 --> 46:52.120]  This is not compatible with free laissez-faire western civilization.
[46:54.520 --> 46:58.280]  They even had MSNBC come out and say oh, it's because Tennessee is full of a bunch of gun
[46:58.280 --> 47:05.880]  nuts. He's probably a gun nut. Days after it was known. And so now US investigators probe
[47:05.880 --> 47:11.560]  shooters alleged war text message. He sent a text saying I'm now declaring war. So even
[47:11.560 --> 47:17.320]  self identified as a quote, the definition of an enemy combatant, but now under political
[47:17.320 --> 47:24.440]  correctness, they can't do that. And so the Washington Post should have the headline here.
[47:27.080 --> 47:33.160]  Americans protest angry over cover up of Islamic terror. But no, the headline is
[47:33.160 --> 47:36.760]  angry protesters in Chattanooga. When's the government going to do something?
[47:36.760 --> 47:44.360]  Paulina Proximire was surrounded by screaming street preachers,
[47:44.360 --> 47:49.320]  angry protesters and unsettled mourners who had just arrived Sunday church. Her son,
[47:49.320 --> 47:54.040]  petty officer, second class Randall Smith, when he six had died Saturday from wounds
[47:54.040 --> 47:59.880]  suffered in a shooting rampage here. The attacker was an aimless depressed 24 year old Muslim man
[47:59.880 --> 48:04.200]  whose online postings suggest he may have been motivated by radical Islamist movements.
[48:04.200 --> 48:08.920]  Yeah. And do you think grizzly bears take a crap in the woods? I mean, I'm sorry folks.
[48:08.920 --> 48:15.160]  It's just this is getting old. Proximire stood across from the bullet riddled armed forces
[48:15.160 --> 48:21.400]  recruiting center. One of two military sites attacked by the gunman last week. She brushed
[48:21.400 --> 48:26.520]  back a strand of sweat soaked hair and sobbed her son had been dead for barely one day around
[48:26.520 --> 48:32.360]  her people were screaming. I can't believe these people even come here to this country.
[48:32.360 --> 48:37.720]  One woman yelled. Why do they come here? Exactly. Why'd you bring your family from Kuwait?
[48:38.440 --> 48:44.200]  We let women drive. We don't sexually mutilate them. We got a bow down to everybody and just
[48:44.200 --> 48:49.160]  say we're sorry that freedom came from the West. We're sorry spaceships came. We're sorry classical
[48:49.160 --> 48:54.120]  music. We're sorry medicine. We're sorry. Yeah, a lot of bad stuff too. But look at all the other
[48:54.120 --> 49:01.640]  cultures. We're sick of it. We're sorry you feel inferior or bad and don't feel like you're accepted
[49:01.640 --> 49:07.880]  by Western culture. You came here because though we're so accepting, we pay for everybody to come
[49:07.880 --> 49:13.960]  here and have their babies. What more can we do? We're a pathetic joke. We're totally conquered
[49:13.960 --> 49:21.080]  by criminals and foreign banks. And you're not going to be able to cover up the racial attacks
[49:21.080 --> 49:28.760]  and the clashes and all these disparate different subsects here in America because the melting
[49:28.760 --> 49:34.200]  pot is broken. It's not come here and adopt Americana culture and then keep your culture
[49:34.200 --> 49:42.120]  and it becomes part of the American culture because you could take in the past a culture
[49:42.120 --> 49:47.080]  from Mexico that was European Spanish predominantly or you could take Italians into the U.S. which
[49:47.080 --> 49:52.120]  were European which was Western. You could take Russians. You could take Japanese because their
[49:52.120 --> 49:58.520]  culture was about working together. But now they're bringing in people from all over who are the most
[49:58.520 --> 50:06.200]  radical groups who will chop your head off if you get caught looking at porn. And you got the left
[50:06.200 --> 50:11.240]  over here who wants to teach your kids how to watch porn but then they want to bring people in
[50:11.240 --> 50:18.280]  that'll chop their heads off. It's an oxymoron. It doesn't fit together. So yeah this guy brought
[50:18.280 --> 50:27.160]  his son in here and his son got whacked out and couldn't handle it. We're going to go to break but
[50:29.480 --> 50:32.600]  people are mad and this is how they're starting the class of civilizations.
[50:33.800 --> 50:39.800]  Look at this one exploding Muslim immigration overwhelms FBI. I'm going to dovetail that with
[50:39.800 --> 50:45.160]  this London Telegraph article life for young Greek men is completely in limbo how this is
[50:45.160 --> 50:53.480]  spreading all over the world. How the shooter was declaring bankruptcy was on drugs or into his
[50:53.480 --> 50:57.640]  diary. Well that ties into what's happened to every other group of young men. It's bigger than
[50:57.640 --> 51:02.760]  just religion. So I asked my buddy Mark where does the name ghost gun come from? You know the ghost
[51:02.760 --> 51:08.680]  AR 15 80 percent rifle gets ghost what's a ghost gun? He says duh they killed ghosts. I said really
[51:08.680 --> 51:14.360]  ghosts he's yeah. As a matter of fact they're guaranteed to kill ghosts Sasquatch space aliens
[51:14.360 --> 51:19.320]  and any other paranormal force that might come your way. So they just appropriately named them
[51:19.320 --> 51:23.560]  ghost guns and I said okay that's a big problem in my neighborhood so where do I get one? He said
[51:23.560 --> 51:29.560]  guns80.com. I said where guns80.com. Okay then I'm headed to guns80.com. Serious investors and

[54:05.800 --> 54:09.160]  We are being conquered by the globalists with their synthetic mind control.
[54:10.680 --> 54:14.440]  But in the endgame they're going to play every culture, every society, every religion off against
[54:14.440 --> 54:20.120]  each other with the new world order and its global peacekeeping forces as the referees
[54:20.120 --> 54:26.920]  who come in and arbitrate the disputes, of course consolidating power amongst themselves,
[54:26.920 --> 54:30.280]  further dividing the people, bringing in a new dark age.
[54:32.840 --> 54:39.640]  Now I'm not an apologist for Islam's failings, Islam's radicalization. That said, the West
[54:39.640 --> 54:44.840]  has done the Middle East wrong. If you want to know why radical Islam is spreading, look in the
[54:44.840 --> 54:51.080]  mirror, NATO openly funding the Free Syrian Army and others, it is a destabilization program.
[54:51.800 --> 54:55.720]  But it's not new. The State Department for more than 50 years, this has been in the Washington Post,
[54:57.080 --> 55:03.400]  has funded madrasas with radical Islamic rhetoric. Now the argument was it was to be a
[55:03.400 --> 55:07.960]  bulwark against communism. The truth is, is to keep the Middle East in a stone age
[55:07.960 --> 55:17.240]  position because previous to the rise of Islam, much of what we call the Middle East today were
[55:17.240 --> 55:26.440]  capitals of science, engineering and commerce. And then they got taken over basically and became
[55:26.440 --> 55:32.440]  a warlike culture. There'd always been war going on in the areas and became more of a conquest type
[55:32.440 --> 55:39.560]  culture and began clashing with Western civilization with the rise of the Prophet Muhammad. And so
[55:39.560 --> 55:46.200]  yes, Islam has been about conquest since day one. Let's not be liars about that. And that's why it's
[55:46.200 --> 55:53.000]  as far east as, you know, China and the Philippines. Islam's all over the world.
[55:53.800 --> 55:58.280]  There was Islamic pirates, you know, off the coast of Australia 180 years ago.
[55:58.280 --> 56:06.840]  But the public is ignorant to all of this. But a lot of Muslim countries were very cultured,
[56:06.840 --> 56:10.360]  pro-western. They're the ones that get targeted and overthrown.
[56:13.560 --> 56:19.640]  Because who wants those people building rocket ships? Who wants them having nuclear power plants
[56:19.640 --> 56:23.880]  that are peaceful? Who wants them having colleges and their young women going to school and being
[56:23.880 --> 56:30.200]  doctors? They want them with bags over their heads. And when the Saudi prince comes or the
[56:30.200 --> 56:33.880]  Saudi king comes to the south of France, they shut down miles of beach in the middle of the
[56:33.880 --> 56:39.000]  hotel district so he doesn't have to look at people. That was in the news yesterday.
[56:40.680 --> 56:45.400]  As God would have it as a cruel joke, I guess, and no one knows the way the Lord works mysterious
[56:45.400 --> 56:53.240]  ways, the most radical group out there has given all the oil and merges as it would with the British
[56:53.240 --> 56:59.000]  intelligence, which is the eugenics cult. But meanwhile, life for young Greek men is completely
[56:59.000 --> 57:04.760]  in limbo, broken, beset by stigma of unemployment. Young Greek men are putting off serious relationships
[57:04.760 --> 57:10.600]  and extending their childhood indefinitely. That's the breakdown of demographics out of Greece and
[57:10.600 --> 57:15.720]  the London Telegraph. And that ties in to investigators on Sunday where probing the
[57:15.720 --> 57:21.560]  communications of the shooter killed US troops in Chattanooga to determine his possible motive.
[57:21.560 --> 57:28.440]  Four Marines were killed in a sailor. They're not calling it an act of terrorism.
[57:28.440 --> 57:35.240]  And they go into how he was depressed, losing his job, getting going bankrupt on illegal drugs.
[57:39.640 --> 57:43.000]  I mean, how do you blame somebody coming out of Kuwait as a young kid and thrown into a
[57:43.000 --> 57:48.440]  gangster Mac Daddy culture that's weaponized by MTV to destroy everybody? And then you get
[57:48.440 --> 57:53.880]  this weird mutation that I've seen radical Islamists merging with the whole Mac Daddy pimp game.
[57:55.240 --> 57:55.640]  It's a
[57:58.120 --> 58:05.320]  idiocracy perspective that makes me want to throw up, though it is a fascinating world, to quote
[58:05.960 --> 58:11.720]  idiocracy. And so across the world from Spain

[59:46.840 --> 59:57.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:11.960]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:20.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:41.480]  There are different philosophies to govern populations of humans. That's undisputable.
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:48.760]  And we've seen the last century communism sold as the rebellion against capitalism.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:52.520]  When we should see a rebellion of capitalism
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:03.720]  against insider mafia rule known as crony capitalism. But if you look at a country like Mexico
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:13.080]  that has, depending on which resource you look at, about three times the natural resource on average
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:21.640]  that the United States does, but why can't Mexico ever seem to become wealthy or free?
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:27.560]  Well, they never got out from under colonialism. You can argue we never did 100% either.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:38.040]  And folks in Mexico are really smart and innovative. But using Mexico as an allegory
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:45.080]  or an analogy or a parallel, I went and saw a movie Saturday night that everyone should go see
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:52.360]  that I want to get the director of on, and it was cartel-ing it. And it shot about 80%
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:02:00.760]  of it inside Mexico, about 20% on the Arizona border. And it shows the Mexican militias that
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:10.680]  have taken part, taken back large parts of the country, but then only themselves to become a mafia
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:21.160]  again. And they all say, well, if we don't do it, somebody else will do it. And then they lock up
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:26.680]  the founder of the movement and put him, I'm giving the movie away here, put him in federal prison at
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:34.040]  the end, because he won't go along with it. It was the winner of Best Documentary Sundance
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:40.440]  Film Festival. It's that good. And what's crazy is it's actually fair. It just shows the humanity
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:49.240]  of both sides. It actually puts the Minutemen, it's not the Minutemen group itself, a similar
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:57.560]  vigilante group on the same level as the Mexican vigilantes. It doesn't say they're perfect,
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:03.320]  they're just human. But it shows the police cooking the methamphetamine. It shows all the
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:10.520]  different gangs, and that's all it is, is rival gangs in the Mexican economy. They have different
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:16.120]  rival gangs bidding with each other to try to get other people to join the other gang.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:20.360]  They have an economy based on the Dark Ages. Mexico is back in the Dark Ages now,
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:28.040]  because everything becomes how big is your gang? And you've got the central government,
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:34.840]  the army, the Marines, with the Marines billed as the non-corrupt group, that's not true,
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:42.600]  though they're not as bad as the army, who basically go and shut down the militias,
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:48.360]  then reconstitute them with their operatives inside who are actually narcotics traffickers.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:54.040]  And they don't say it in the movie, but it's clear the government of Mexico and the United States
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:59.080]  are the ones organizing all this, and it's come out in court. So I don't know why they didn't put
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:07.880]  it in the movie. That El Chapo and his number two guy and all of them when they're in court
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:15.160]  with his number two guy, this is even in the El Paso Times, Chicago Tribune, three years ago,
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:21.480]  were working for the CIA, DEA and FBI running all the major drug operations and had been armed
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:30.280]  to take out the specific cartels not controlled by the Federal Reserve. And I had a former DEA
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:37.400]  agent on Celica Steel, they went and set up and raided his house, put in jail after he came on.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:44.920]  When he said they tried to hire him, he was a Vietnam vet to train Los Zetas
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:54.360]  and other cartels working for the CIA for El Chapo before this was ever in the news,
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.760]  before the war in Mexico started eight years ago.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:02.920]  Here is an update on the Chattanooga shooting. Over the weekend, one of the victims died of
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:07.560]  his injuries, and now the death toll is six, including the shooter. And the FBI is telling
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:11.640]  people not to jump to conclusions, and that the shooter may not have had terrorist ties,
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.400]  but may have suffered from depression. So here we have another potential mass murder,
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:20.200]  suicide pill incident. Thanks, big pharma. Of course, Mr. Abdul-Z's father was initially
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:25.320]  on a terror watch list, and Mr. Abdul-Z himself made some interesting trips to the Middle East
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:29.560]  over the last few years. But don't look at any of that. It's not a terrorist attack.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:34.440]  This can only be considered an isolated incident. But that didn't stop General Wesley Clark calling
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:39.800]  for internment camps for disloyal Americans. Over the weekend, the retired general told MSNBC,
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:43.560]  in World War II, if someone supported Nazi Germany at the expense of the United States,
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:47.640]  we didn't say that was freedom of speech. We put him in a camp. They were prisoners of war.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:51.480]  Clark's remarks reveal the mindset of the upper echelon of government. Those who disagree with
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:55.880]  our so-called leaders are now to be rounded up and shut up indefinitely in political internment
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:06:03.560]  camps. Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com. Infowarslife.com. Check it out today. I have set out

[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:19.800]  from the Infowars Life Line because they are not of the very highest quality or because they're not

[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:08.040]  what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet. For more than a
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:12.840]  decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:18.200]  farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans. We have now managed to secure the sought-after
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:25.720]  beans in a highly customized blend. Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:31.960]  at Infowarslife.com. This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:36.440]  and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally. Hands down, this is my favorite coffee
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:41.880]  and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers. Dropped
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.040]  by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:50.840]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:56.360]  press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee. Available
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:05.560]  at Infowarslife.com. From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines,
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:13.720]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. The intro you're hearing
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:20.360]  has aired for 18 years. I've been syndicated for 18 years. On air for 20. Soon to be 21,
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:30.040]  in about four or five months. Hard to believe 21 years on air soon. And I meant it tongue and
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:35.240]  cheek then, you know, broadcasting from deep behind enemy lines because originally there was
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:41.400]  another little intro before that that was clips from Red Dawn. Where the chair is against the wall,
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:47.640]  chair is against the wall. John has a long mustache, you know, coded messages from unoccupied U.S.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:53.160]  into the occupied U.S. And for all of you on or behind enemy lines, this song's for you.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:09:01.880]  And then it would cut from that into that intro. But now 18 years later, almost 19 years later,
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:09.720]  we're under FEMA. The NSA does whatever it wants. The CIA spies on Congress. Obama rules by executive
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:15.080]  fiat. We're going under TPP that no one's even allowed to read. The three subsections that have
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:22.680]  been leaked by WikiLeaks are just so draconian across the board. And they've got the Ford Foundation
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:27.400]  hyping racial division. So we're all fighting with each other over race instead of about how
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.840]  all of us collectively are losing our basic freedoms. We're going to be talking to William
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:37.320]  Benny, former technical director of the National Security Agency, huge whistleblower about some
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:43.400]  of the big developments concerning the NSA that have come out. And we'll take some phone calls
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:50.440]  if he's up for it with your specific questions. And you can tweet at real Alex Jones with your
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:59.480]  questions as well. But our video is up on drudgereport.com up at the very top of one of the major
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:06.680]  columns. And you can just link through and watch the video. So on the left hand side,
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:11.880]  video liberal sign petition to support white privilege tax.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:22.520]  And I'd say about what it's the same paradigm out in LA eight out of 10 people.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:31.000]  Hispanic, it looks like Arab and black sign a petition to make white people pay 1% tax.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.960]  Doesn't matter if you just came here from Russia, doesn't matter if you're Polish,
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:39.160]  doesn't matter if you're an Italian immigrant or Romanian. And you know, of course, the Hispanics
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:45.400]  that are out there are part Spanish or Portuguese. A lot of Germans settled in Mexico and Latin America
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:51.640]  as well. So you're European as well. I mean, it's just so crazy that all the reparations
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:57.000]  talk being so mainline, you could have this going on. And meanwhile, I wanted to ask William
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:04.120]  Benny about this. It's now come out that Obama has a secret database data mining into everything
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:08.360]  you do data mining in the local government, Google, you name it, to create a database of
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:17.000]  your racial connections to start federal fines and fees to quote, show white bias. You can't
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.840]  make this up. So this is what the data mining is all about. Then another article dealing with
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:26.600]  data mining Obama pushes to extend gun control background checks to social security.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.440]  That if you have a social security disability,
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:38.360]  so you're getting disability, you will not be able to own a gun and we'll have to turn your guns in,
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:42.760]  not a felon, not a criminal, done nothing wrong. Your handicapped in a wheelchair need a firearm
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:47.480]  in a bad area. The police are coming to take your gun. We reported on this on Saturday,
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:52.680]  and I saw comments on info wars.com saying this can't be true. This is in the LA times today.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:12:01.240]  They're going to use a department of veterans affairs program that they've been using for
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:06.040]  a decade on veterans to manage who has their firearms taken.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:12.600]  It says that right here. So see the don't treat list in the military
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:18.680]  that have been out for a year, been around for four or five years where you just cannot
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:23.320]  get treatment for operable cancer, operable heart problems. You're just giving pills.
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:27.880]  Oh, your knees bad. Here's a cane. What did Dr. Blalock say over and over again on this show
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:32.840]  about Obamacare? They'll be the model of the VA. And once we get it, they'll say no knee surgery.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:38.200]  Here's a cane. No cornea surgery. Here's glasses. They got more doctors than anybody else in the
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:44.840]  world per capita in Cuba. You just can't get any service. And it's now here and it's all managed by
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:49.960]  computers and databases. William Benny is going to be breaking this down. I wanted to get his take
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:13:00.200]  on this first CNBC, Wesley Clark, former top US general, former top NATO general, former supreme
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:08.520]  allied commander of Europe for NATO, advocates rounding up radicalized and disloyal Americans.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:13.720]  Oh, like this guy already being watched by the FBI who's shot and killed five people
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:18.840]  in Chattanooga and his dad connected to networks that are under scrutiny.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:26.040]  Just like Major Assan, the NSA had him with overseas communicates and the CIA blocked for
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.760]  two years an investigation of Assan who was being handled by Anwar Alalaki.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:36.440]  And they didn't call that terror either. Why are they doing this? Because they use it to get more
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:40.200]  domestic funding. But now he wants to lock people up. But when you read deeper, they've
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:43.880]  SWAT teamed William Benny. They tried to put him in jail. They've put record numbers of journalists
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:48.440]  in jail. They admit at the homeland security level. It was first leaked to us seven years ago. It's
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:54.520]  now declassified. I had state police, federal marshal and others leak at me multiple documents on
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.720]  record where they said veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, constitutionalist
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.880]  and then anti-war activist are listed as the real terror threat.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:11.240]  And here's Wesley Clark. Just setting the table for how this stuff is going to affect everybody.
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:17.800]  Data mining. That you went in when you had a divorce or you went in when you had a car wreck
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.800]  and they recommended, hey, go see a psychologist about your broken back or whatever. And then
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:28.520]  they said, oh, we say you have PTSD. They just hand out diagnoses like they hand out candy
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.040]  at a barber shop to kids and then you're told you can't own a gun anymore.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:39.000]  I told you it was common. What they do to the vets, they do to us. What they do to the least of us,
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.480]  they do to me, Christ said. What they'll do to unborn babies, what they'll do to old people,
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.320]  what they'll do to vets, they'll do to everybody.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:53.640]  I want to play this Wesley Clark clip and just get William Benny's take on the general world
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:57.880]  itself. He's been to Europe. He's been speaking around the planet. He can tell us about that
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.040]  and update. We're so honored to have him. But here is the, it'll be with us 15 minutes to the next
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:07.160]  hour and we're going to be joined by Wayne Madsen, formerly the NSA as well with breaking news.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.800]  But I wanted a full hour with him. So with us 15 minutes to the next hour, he's able to do that.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:19.240]  But here's the clip of Wesley Clark on Friday's MSNBC. Well, we've got to identify the people
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:25.960]  who are most likely to be radicalized. We've got to cut this off at the beginning. There are always
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:30.280]  a certain number of young people who are alienated. They don't get a job. They lost a girlfriend.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:35.240]  Their family doesn't feel happy here. And we can watch the signs of that. And there are members
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:39.320]  of the community who will reach out to those people and bring them back in and encourage them
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:44.360]  to look at their blessings here. But I do think on a national policy level, we need to look at
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:52.840]  what self radicalization means because we are at war with this group of terrorists. They do
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:58.840]  have an ideology. In World War II, if someone supported Nazi Germany at the expense of the
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:05.640]  United States, we didn't say that was freedom of speech. We put him in a camp. They were prisoners
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:11.960]  of war. So if these people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:16.840]  disloyal to the United States as a matter of principle, fine, that's their right. It's our
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:22.200]  right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:25.720]  conflict. And I think we're going to have to increasingly get tough on this.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:30.280]  Okay. And so will Europe, he goes on to say. Here's the problem. They're bringing in record
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:38.360]  numbers of Muslims from radical countries, from radical sex. I mean, they can look into a database,
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:44.760]  find out if somebody is a hobbyist like these folks were connected to.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:54.440]  They can see his comments online on Facebook. I mean, the FBI was already watching them and
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:59.960]  was told to stand down. And William Benny talked about the NSA had the power to stop 9-11.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:05.000]  Weren't allowed to use those tools. Instead, everybody gets spied on because the political
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.400]  class wants these threats to be there, wants to keep them going, as William Benny has said,
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:14.120]  to take more of our liberties so they can dominate the general political mass of the people who are
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:22.760]  not criminals. Joining us is William Benny, former technical director of the National Security Agency.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:29.000]  I don't know where you want to start, sir. We could get into the latest hacking situation
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:35.320]  with Ashley Madison. We could get into corporation spine. We could get into exposed facts,
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:40.520]  the site that has your info posted, the tour you just came off of speaking around the world.
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:44.520]  We could get into this call for interning Islamists that are radicalized.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.920]  What do you want to tackle first, sir?
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:53.080]  Well, it's good to be with you again, Alex, but could we start with the OPM
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:59.400]  issue and the data hacking and... Absolutely. Let's talk about the data
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:04.600]  hacking and more time in the spotlight for NSL 2014 and review this big court ruling.
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:14.440]  Yeah. First of all, with the OPM, when they lose all of that data, that includes things like,
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.200]  when you go for a clearance with the government to work for the government,
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:28.120]  you fill out a form that's an SF86, a standard form 86, and that goes through your entire history,
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:35.560]  work history, health issues, your family, all your family members, all their names, addresses,
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:41.880]  phone numbers, and references, all the people you have done as references. Plus, it also
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:50.440]  authorizes them to... You have to authorize them to be able to acquire any kind of information
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:57.400]  health-wise, financially, or anything else that the FBI wishes to get. It's like a universal NSL
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:02.440]  on every individual that applied. So, all of that goes into the files in the OPM.
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:07.880]  And so, in layman's terms, the reported Chinese hack that Obama's covering up
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:14.200]  is basically the secret files on federal employees, operatives, and others,
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:17.720]  an unprecedented breach. Who do you think's behind it? They're saying it's China.
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:22.120]  Mr. Benny, I mean, you're the expert on this. Who do you think's really behind it?
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:28.280]  Well, I think they're probably right that it is China. I think that's probably what it is, yeah.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:34.680]  But there's something other than that. There's something even more threatening here,
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:39.880]  that is, I'm not sure what OPM had exactly in their files, but if they had all of the...
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:44.520]  They're supposed to compile all the data of your experience while you're working with the
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:47.880]  government. So, it's like your central personnel file.
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:51.640]  Which will have a lot of intel on who's been investigated. This is a devastating breach.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:59.400]  Yeah. And it would also list, for example, letters of appreciation or commendation
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:05.880]  or awards and things like that, which for your work history, that is, if you achieve things in
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:12.760]  work, then they would write them up and you would get a letter or some kind of achievement award or
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:17.880]  something like that, which would go into describing what you did. So, it would be classified. So,
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:22.920]  now if that classified data is in there, also that means the Chinese have all of that too.
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:26.360]  Well, Mr. Benny, this is so bombshell and I knew it was in the notes to go over.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:31.720]  I'd like you to start over without me interrupting, explain the data breach that happened,
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:36.040]  the clear hacks that have been going on, the glitches all over the place, the war between
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:41.320]  the U.S. and China. And then I want to go back into the last time you were in studio with us,
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:44.360]  and we're going to put this together with that on the nightly news tonight,
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:50.520]  where you explained by putting everything on digital databases and by putting back doors and
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:57.080]  everything, it made our country wide open to foreign hacking and is the ultimate tool, Trojan
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:05.160]  Horse, to make us absolutely Swiss cheese penetrable. That has now, within a month or two of you
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:12.200]  predicting it, has now happened. So, explain it to us like we're just the lay public and not 200 IQ
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:21.800]  super geniuses in a top code record like yourself. Okay, let me see if I can put it simply.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:27.640]  If, for example, you have a bunch of protected information that you want to, that you have
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:32.280]  classified or information about the people who are working for you, you're assembling it in a
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:38.600]  database so you can help manage your business, okay? The industry would do this too. So, but if
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:45.320]  you put it in a database, you have to try to ensure that that database is secure. Well, if NSA
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:51.320]  is going along and other intelligence agencies around the world are going along trying to find
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:58.280]  weaknesses in operating systems or firewalls or other kinds of encryption or things like that,
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:02.760]  and when they find them, they don't tell anybody so that what they can do, it gives them a window
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:08.680]  into everything that they are doing. Well, that simply says they're allowing a flaw in the system
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:14.120]  to exist and continue, which can be discovered by anybody in the world. I mean, they have no,
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:18.040]  they have no monopoly on smart people. There's lots of smart people all around the world. So,
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:23.480]  that means that they eventually have a chance to get in and see that too, which means that that
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:30.040]  then makes everybody with that system vulnerable. So, they leave the holes, they don't patch them,
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:35.480]  please continue. Yeah, they leave them that way because they want to be able to look into what
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:39.880]  you're doing. So, they know they have a window in, but other people can discover that too.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:45.880]  And when the other people do it, like the Chinese, for example, that means that they can come across
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:53.560]  and take everything that's in those files also. So, and when... So, now let's say the entire
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:23:02.200]  21 million huge government database of operatives and spies and hackers, you name it, has now been
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:08.840]  grabbed by the Communist Chinese. Plus, potentially some of the awards that they've all achieved over
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:13.640]  their work history, which means it may outline some of the programs that are existing and some
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:18.520]  of the techniques that were used to achieve the success. But almost no coverage of this. We've
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:23.000]  heard Snowden's the biggest demon in the world for exposing illegal spying on the people,
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.600]  but not actually releasing the intel. And now we have the system itself built so government
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:33.720]  agencies should go in and out of there and not have their track scene to use this for power.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:38.840]  Now, because of their traitorous activity, we've seen a devastating blow to national security.
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:45.160]  Right. And it also outlines all the contractors that are involved with the NSA or CIA or anybody
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:52.520]  else. And it gives them, like for example, that's how the Chinese came up with the design of the F-35,
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:57.960]  you know, that's the same design as ours, but they got it from us. They didn't get it from,
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:01.480]  you know, from having to do the development themselves.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.600]  They don't have to spend 400 million now. They can just take it for free.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:10.120]  Yeah, they take it from the contractors. Yeah, who are, you know, the weaknesses then are system-wide.
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:14.280]  All the contractors that are involved also have to be protected in the same level and they're not.
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.560]  And that's why they're being able to get into these systems.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:23.960]  So, I mean, it makes everybody vulnerable. Why are we seeing prosecution of journalists that
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:29.480]  expose the crime, but then they let the communist Chinese operatives also work in these secret
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:35.800]  facilities as well, who are then physically, as a brain trust, taking the plans out of the building?
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:42.920]  You know, it's beyond me. I can't understand this myself. I really can't. I mean, it's absolutely
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:47.720]  astounding. How can people do this? I just don't understand it. I mean, if whistleblowers come
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:53.160]  out and show that there's a problem or an issue or something illegal or something, you know,
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:58.120]  criminal or some fraud or waste, why? I mean, it would be in the vested interest of the
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:02.920]  organization, the government or the industry to address that issue. If they want to improve
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.800]  as a corporation or a government, they should address it to fix the problem
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:13.560]  instead of letting the problem fester and continue, because it only allows, you know, all of these
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:20.760]  follow on things to happen. So, you know, it's in almost infallible, infallible to me as to how
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:27.160]  they would, you know, just let this continue like that. It shows a really decadent attitude
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:33.080]  and a laissez-faire attitude by these people. This smells like an empire on the verge of collapse
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:38.280]  to me. Just all of this craziness going on really, really stinks to high heaven.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:42.520]  Yeah, it certainly does. Yeah. I absolutely agree to that.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:47.480]  Well, I've asked some of the questions here. You brought up these huge data breaches.
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:53.800]  Then that ties into, as you said, commercial outfits, everything from Amazon to Bank of America
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:59.560]  to Ashley Madison with 37 million cheaters on it. Now they're saying they're going to publish that
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:03.640]  in a database so men and women can find out of their husband or wife cheated on them.
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:09.560]  I mean, it just seems like all this open source, open code, backdoor open stuff is going to bring
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:16.600]  down the world. It certainly makes the world vulnerable to all kinds of manipulation and
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:22.280]  monitoring and all kinds of blackmail or things like that happening anywhere in the world for
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:28.600]  anybody. It's not just the average citizen, but it's also members of parliaments around the world,
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:35.080]  government, officials, everybody. What about planted info? I don't have seen a lot of cases
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:39.480]  or different agencies in this government and others plant stuff on people's computers.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:43.000]  Isn't it easy for them to go in and plant stuff with these backdoors?
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:48.360]  Yeah, you see, that's part of the problem. That makes that all possible too.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:55.720]  And that means that it gets back to a question of trust. How can you trust a government that
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:27:00.680]  has the capability to do that? And if they do everything in secret, you never know what they're
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.240]  doing. And so it's very difficult to prove one way or another that they did or didn't do that.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:11.320]  The way we did it, of course, was to have duplicate copies of everything we ever did
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:15.080]  in multiple places. So you're backed up so that if they manipulate anything,
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:19.800]  then we could show it from a record copy from another source that we had.
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:25.800]  Weren't you able to do that yourself to try to set you up, but somebody inside warns you?
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:30.360]  Well, we didn't have any. It was basically, we understood how these people operated.
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:36.840]  So we did the backups, like I just said, and so that when they took data and tried to accuse us
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:40.520]  of something, we already had retrieved all the data from our backup sources.
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:46.520]  And so they couldn't claim things that didn't exist in our backup sources. So we could show,
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:53.480]  in court, record copy emails, things like that, that would demonstrate that what they were saying
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:59.080]  was untrue. I'm going from memory last time you were physically here. There was some other facet
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:04.040]  to it, though, where someone inside basically stopped them from being able to set you up.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:09.320]  You don't know who they are, though. Oh, that was the, in the Department of Justice, there was
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:14.920]  the, somebody felt really bad about, you know, excuse me, what they were doing to us. So they
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:22.680]  sent us a copy of their draft indictment, which showed all of the, all the falsehoods that they
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:28.920]  were attempting to claim against us. So there was somebody in the DOJ who actually felt bad about
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:35.000]  it. So I, you know, not everybody there is bad, is what I'm trying to say. Sure. Being in government
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:42.520]  for decades, being admittedly one of the top code breakers ever moving up from the, you know,
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:47.320]  mailroom to the very top of the organization, basically, to use that allegory or that analogy.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:50.680]  And we're going to break here in a moment, just a quick question.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:56.360]  What percentage, as a guesstimation of government, would you say are good guys versus bad guys?
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:04.680]  I think that the, the corruption of people and the conversion to the dark side starts around
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:13.080]  grade 15, which is probably, which is the government service grade, which is like a, a lieutenant or
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:19.320]  a bird colonel in the military. At that level on up is where the corruption really starts. And so at
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:26.840]  that point, I'd say you're talking maybe about 15% of the people. And it runs basically on a military
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:31.320]  system. You're just in plain clothes. In fact, you were a, what level were you of a general?
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:37.480]  Well, I was like, it's not quite equivalent to military, but it's like a 1.5 general. Yeah,
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:41.800]  star general. Yeah. We'll be right back. Stay there. William Benny, former technical
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:46.760]  director of the NSA is our guest. I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:54.760]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:30:03.800]  Economic upheaval has enveloped the European Union this year as a result of bailout practices that
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:07.800]  have done nothing but make these countries more insolvent. Well, French president Francois
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:12.200]  Hollande has proposed a solution. He recently suggested that every member of the eurozone
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.640]  transfer all their sovereignty to a newly created federal government. In other words,
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:19.320]  it would essentially be a United States of Europe. The government would have a prime minister,
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:22.920]  a parliament, a federal budget and a federal treasury. That's a pretty good suggestion.
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:27.080]  Since your original eurozone bureaucracy and parliament didn't do anything to help these
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:31.320]  financial crises, except make the banks richer, let's create another big bureaucracy that we
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:35.480]  can feed money into. Therefore, kicking the can down the road just a little bit farther. Michael
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:39.400]  Schneider notes that during times of emergency, the elites are often able to push through things
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:43.640]  that they would never be able to accomplish under normal circumstances. And for those of you
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:49.720]  keeping score a year ago, the euro to dollar ratio was 1.35. Today it's come down to 1.08.
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:55.000]  Clearly, the European Union is faltering. Rob Dew reporting for info wars nightly news and info

[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:45.560]  at the nsa is our guest if folks just joined us former technical leader for the intelligence
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:51.800]  with the nsa before becoming a whistleblower in 2001 to congress he did it the proper way until
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:55.800]  he got swat teamed after one of the 30 years of the agency benny has been described as one of the
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:01.000]  big best analysts and co-breakers in nsa history benny continues to speak out on the nsa's data
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:07.800]  collection expose facts dot org i've got a lot of questions to answer to try to get you to answer
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:15.640]  but i also want to hear what you think is important front and center so go ahead mr benny what else
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:22.600]  should the public know about from your expert perspective well relevant to relative to the
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:28.520]  opm loss of data i mean they could have easily encrypted that data it doesn't matter whether
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:34.680]  you have data stored on an old set of equipment or a new set it's still stored in database in a
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:40.360]  database you can encrypt the database no matter where it is so they could have done that all along
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:45.640]  but they didn't so they even made them even more vulnerable you know so that would have been a
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:50.600]  simple solution for them to do and to and to help protect that information and they didn't even do
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:55.640]  that so i mean they're not making good decisions here period i mean these are not people who are
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:39:00.920]  competent at securing anything i mean the same is true with nsa i mean they're doing this bulk
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:07.320]  acquisition of information and burying themselves and i keep i use the case of the garland shooting
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:12.520]  garland texas shooting down there where you know a member of anonymous tipped off the local police
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:16.760]  down there that they were going to be attacked two days before the attack occurred and yet our
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:22.120]  intelligence community for which we pay over a hundred billion dollars a year said absolutely
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:27.080]  nothing why because they're buried in so much information they can't find it whereas anonymous
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:32.680]  was very focused at a focused attack a focused look at the people who were involved in terrorism
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:37.720]  or were showing signs of being radicalized and and they found the information whereas our
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:43.640]  intelligence community didn't and so they have the incompetence at the top levels of all these
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:50.760]  agencies are adopting the incorrect process for the entire agencies of the of the uh intelligence
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:56.360]  community that means they're they're making us all more vulnerable than we've ever been before
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:01.720]  so i mean that's so important that people don't seem to realize well they keep saying they're
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:07.000]  doing this for our protection well sort of the nazis in 1933 when they you know took power
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  to do anything with anybody with the ndaa section 1021 which is special order 48 for the nazis the
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.880]  same kind of thing has occurred down through history over and over again and if their objective
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:23.640]  is to protect us then they ought to do do things smartly professionally and in with discipline
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:31.720]  and that's what they're not doing so what is the end game i mean obviously hundreds of
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:36.280]  billions of dollars are being made a year by private contractors and big companies so they're
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:41.400]  always lobbying for more and more of this but then you have giant sprawling facilities in
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:48.040]  utah texas maryland all over the place not to mention 800 000 people that are outside government
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:57.640]  with security clearances building the ultimate hackable uh open door nightmare system how do
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:02.040]  they think they're going to get away with this i mean it's it's going to create more and more
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:08.920]  disasters now the chinese have stolen 21 million background dossiers on federal employees and
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:14.200]  operatives i mean this is just unprecedented and nobody's getting in trouble for it
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:22.520]  yeah i think uh i think they feel that the the this is what the president is now really warned
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:29.480]  us about back in the 1961 was the power of the evolving at the time military industrial complex
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:34.040]  is the way he called it but it's really the military industrial intelligence complex
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:39.800]  which includes government uh the the supposed intelligence committees that were supposed to
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:46.440]  prevent spying on us citizens as a result of the fieze laws back in 1978 in fact are now advocates
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:51.960]  for spying on us citizens so that's the kind of that's the kind of reversal that's gone on i mean
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:56.760]  our entire government in the intelligence related field national security if you will
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:01.880]  has now felt that they're above the law they're above the constitution they can do anything they
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:07.720]  feel is necessary and nobody's going to stop them and everybody's afraid to do anything because they'll
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:13.400]  feel they'll feel that if political people started doing they would they would fear fear being labeled
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:20.040]  you know weak on terror weak on national security and and they don't want that label and so therefore
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:26.040]  they go along to get along we'll take ran poll he said four years ago don't fund the free syrian
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:32.840]  army they're really will hobbyist out of Saudi Arabia and then now they go on the news and say
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:38.200]  because you're not for the patriot act extension or illegal nsa spying it's going to be your fault
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:43.640]  when we get hit by terrorists when they have this giant nsa system and it didn't stop anything
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:48.920]  that's exactly right and that's because they're not doing a professional disciplined approach
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:54.040]  the management is directing something that is focused on getting more money and more money
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:43:00.280]  and building a bigger bureaucracy and not actually solving problems that's that's what the that's what
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:05.240]  they that's the way they've approached this entire problem from the beginning even before 9 11
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:11.720]  i mean it was basically they allowed things to happen uh without actually trying to stop sure
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:15.880]  and doing smart things that is to make that happen make that possible you know they just
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:20.920]  to they just uh we're looking for money as the main objective well we know what's
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:28.040]  going to happen the chinese are going to use that database to make connections between the people
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:32.200]  that are on the list and operatives inside their country and they're undoubtedly going
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:38.600]  to end up imprisoning or killing us operatives inside china and rolling up the entire western
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:45.480]  operation and it only seems like it's a matter of time before this confrontation with china escalates
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:50.040]  but so many of our leaders are heavily invested in china they're basically already double agents
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:56.040]  to china i mean this just seems like a recipe for disaster uh i couldn't agree more i mean we're not
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:03.160]  doing anything smart in most international arenas i mean it's just not uh it's just not smart to do
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:08.120]  the taking the and doing the procedures that we're doing even like with the uh i don't understand why
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:12.760]  we didn't put more right and pressure on the iranians to get a better deal i mean why didn't we
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:17.160]  ask for a better deal it seemed like we caved on every point that they were asking on i didn't
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:22.920]  you know it doesn't make a lot of sense to me to do that you know usually i could figure out what's
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:29.160]  going on i can't figure out what's going on with iran uh because the west is clearly funding iran's
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:36.920]  archenemy saudi arabia and allowing them to run a a a sunni takeover and then meanwhile we've been
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:42.200]  fighting a proxy war against iran in syria but then on the other hand we make a one-sided deal
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:49.560]  that is for iran and then they make fun of us uh i mean i i can't figure out what's going on
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:57.560]  yes it's hard to follow the bouncing ball in that arena that's that's for sure i really don't i
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:02.040]  really don't know what to say myself i don't know how to i don't know how to uh you know characterize
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:09.640]  that meanwhile for those that just joined us you got swat teamed uh for going and whistle
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:14.520]  blowing to congress and they tried to put you and others in prison so that's who this government's
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:20.760]  focused on uh is people like you that built so much of what they're misusing today so i guess
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:26.360]  honorable service to the republic this legal and lawful is punished being an absolute whore trader
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:35.240]  is is rewarded yeah i i think i refer to that as population control which is the
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:41.800]  objective of mass acquisition of data uh on everybody in your country we're on the planet
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:47.400]  it's really population control so that's really what they're after i think
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:52.520]  that way they get to manipulate anybody they want to do anything they want them to do
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:59.320]  and then they just hope that other governments and corporations are too incompetent
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:03.560]  to know how to use the data that they can get as well that just sounds arrogant
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:09.320]  well so far it's been pretty much true uh except that that there's like some of the
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:15.160]  thing cases when they have these uh break-ins and theft of information why that shows that others
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:23.240]  are starting to wise up too so i mean it means that that it simply means that they can't they
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:27.880]  can't guarantee that they will be the only ones to be able to leverage this information
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:35.800]  well take ashley madison from the time i heard that being promoted on talk radio by
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:41.240]  howard sternum people i just immediately thought that sounds like a recipe for blackmail and then
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:47.160]  now 37 million people that have reportedly cheated on their spouses that database has now been stolen
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:52.120]  why would anyone if they were going to cheat on their spouse go do it on a mass database
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:47:00.920]  yeah that's really kind of uh it's really people don't realize what's what's possible today and
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:04.280]  you know with the with the insist information systems we have
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:11.720]  they just don't realize that this information is out there forever for just about anybody to get
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:13.240]  to it if they know how to do that
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:21.240]  William many former technical director of the national security agency uh is our guest
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:26.840]  and we're here going over some of the latest developments what do you make of a whole bunch
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:32.840]  of financial websites the wall street journal airlines going down two weeks ago the new york
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:39.240]  stock exchange going down and they said it was not connected to a hack um do you have any info
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:45.240]  on that mr benning i don't have any first-hand knowledge of that but but it sure sounds suspicious
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:51.480]  even by simply a time coincidence that uh that those things are happening without some central
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:56.920]  or coordinated action uh the what's the effort to try to figure the random probability of that
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:02.920]  actually being that that way and it gets pretty the random probability is pretty pretty low
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:11.640]  in my view anyway since you were last on clapper um of course for folks that don't know who headed
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:19.800]  up the nsa uh his lawyer came out and said that uh he was forgetful he didn't mean to lie saying
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:25.880]  the nsa does no domestic spying he was just forgetful what do you make of that i think
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:32.760]  that's just a bunch of hard wash i mean he was given those questions you know uh two days in advance
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:37.000]  so how can you be forgetful when you're given the questions you're going to be
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:42.920]  asked asked asked in in the in committee and you go over them how can you forget that you
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:47.480]  went over them i mean that's just a bunch of malarkey well we see how the supreme court's
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:51.960]  acting we see how congress is acting doing whatever foreign corporations want we've been
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:56.200]  conquered with blackmail i think it's clear it's come out that the british parliament's
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:01.720]  being blackmailed with their mi6 spying it's come out the cia is spying on the senate
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:07.160]  intelligence committee i mean i think it's pretty clear we've been hoisted on our own
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:12.840]  patard we've been hung in our own rope uh and that this technology has been used to overthrow the
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:22.920]  country uh i don't have a i can't argue with that that sounds very much on the mark to me in your
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:29.640]  gut do you think we're going to be able to reverse this or get it under control yeah i really do
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:35.080]  because the one of the one of the basic the the fundamental thing that they're most afraid of
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:41.960]  is being exposed i mean that's that's why i think there's a lot of uh there's a lot of uh people who
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:49.320]  talk directly about issues uh create a real firestorm and are opposed by any number of people
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:56.040]  that's because nobody wants to address the real hard problems uh and uh when it comes to it they
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:01.800]  try to cover up things that they're doing so so they're very sensitive to having sunlight put on
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:07.640]  the events or the things that they've actually done and and some of that is coming out and even
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:12.840]  even being more discussed in in europe now for example the bundistog is finding out that the bnd
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:17.960]  had agreements with certain limited numbers of members of the higher level members of their
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:23.160]  government to do certain things with nsa that the rest of the bundistog didn't know about well the
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:31.160]  same was true in our congress you see we exported that technique of how to co-opt in uh uh legislative
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:36.280]  areas around the world how to give data to select people and then make them even more prominent
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:41.480]  because they're operatives it's it's it's espionage let's come back and talk about that when merkel
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:46.280]  claimed a year ago she didn't know about nsa spying and of course she did william benney's been over

[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:59.960]  in the next hour we're talking steve chris eugenia and others quick questions or comments for our
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:09.560]  guest one of the top nsa experts out there 800 259 9231 but yeah you've been out of the country
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:15.080]  and and traveling the last few months mr benny tell us about the progress you're making alerting
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:19.640]  the world to what's happening because whether it's here in the u.s. or germany or anywhere
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:26.200]  there are laws against this this is not legal by any stretch of the imagination so how are they
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:33.480]  getting away with it well that's what i've been suggesting when i go to uh like for example germany
[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:39.480]  or europe europe europe anywhere in europe i mean european union and has the laws against the data
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:45.160]  that transfer without the permission of the individuals involved i mean they do information
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:51.960]  even if it's held by telecoms or any kind of service provider that it's still that information is
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:57.320]  the property of the individual and so if they want to transfer it somewhere give it to somebody
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:02.040]  else or share it then they have to get the permission of that individual to do that otherwise
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:07.800]  it's against their laws so so what that really means to me and then what i keep suggesting over
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:12.680]  there is that they should file lawsuits and criminal prosecution against all these people
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:17.640]  for sharing the information all of the companies at least uh if they don't want to do it against
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:22.280]  the u.s. government then they should do it against the companies that are participating in this data
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:29.640]  sharing uh specifically with the prism program or or any other of the tapping programs even
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:36.520]  even the the the bundistog is found out i believe that just recently that the the bnd was cooperating
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:43.400]  with nsa and sharing data about german citizens and other european citizens as well with the nsa so
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:49.240]  i mean that's also against their laws so i mean they have ample opportunity if they want to to
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:56.680]  charge these organizations with criminal prosecution i mean they just need to start doing it
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:06.040]  or what comes next i mean if we don't reverse this big brother on steroids move
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:10.520]  where does it end i mean you know samsung six months ago with all its new customers that
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:16.520]  buy their new tv's tells you we watch and listen to you and sell the data i mean i mean not just
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:25.480]  watch your patterns of what you view to sell a algorithm profile but they're actually listening
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:32.440]  and watching you i mean how crazy is that i know it's insane i mean why would anybody want to buy
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:38.520]  a product like that i mean i certainly wouldn't i mean it's it's like it's like that uh that the
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:45.720]  case uh when uh a school gave uh laptop computers to the kids pennsylvania yeah and they started
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:50.280]  spying on them when they were at home i mean that's that's certainly a violation of their
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:56.120]  privacy rights well and then why exactly and it was the school themselves that announced it like it
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:58:01.560]  was a good thing you know mr benny it's almost like a revolution of these crazy control freaks
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:06.280]  against the rest of us they're just doing it like it's their religion no matter how crazy sorry go
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:11.560]  ahead no no that's absolutely right no i i agree totally with that i mean it's a it's a matter of
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:16.840]  standing up for your rights i mean i've never i have never known americans not to stand up for
[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:22.200]  their rights until this this current cycle with the terrorism i mean and what they've done is they
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:27.560]  fearmongered us into thinking that oh we're all in so much danger we better just forget about our
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:32.040]  rights and let them do anything they want to try to protect it well they aren't really trying to
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:37.160]  protect us if they were they wouldn't be doing this bulk acquisition they'd be doing the target
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:40.840]  exactly stay there and explain that in 70 seconds when we come back and we'll take phone calls
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:45.400]  two more seconds with william benny stay with us communications radio network

[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:26.440]  money there sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:32.040]  or maximum potency they want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:37.400]  for a while but then burn you out in my experience whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going

[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:29.000]  texas alex jones william benney is our guest former technical leader for intelligence with the nsa
[02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:33.720]  he was number even number number three number two depending on how you look at it of the national
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:40.440]  security agency blew the whistle back in 2001 about illegal spying also pointing out that was
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:47.240]  so much of it it would like blind us to real stuff and they didn't do anything they swat teamed
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:55.320]  years later and tried to set him up he's a real hero for doing his job and as he said most people
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:01:00.040]  low level in government are not bad it's as you get higher level they won't compromise individuals
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:06.680]  next segment we're going to steve chris eugene scott jeremy and others with your questions or
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:13.720]  comments for william benney and he posts his information at expose facts dot org major
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:20.920]  whistleblower website but we were talking back before the break about pennsylvania and other
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:25.240]  areas where and i mean that was like eight years ago where the school gives out all these quote
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:29.320]  free laptops they're not free their taxpayer paid for and then they were watching kids in their
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:33.320]  showers they call the police because a girl was eating skittles they said they were pills
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:40.440]  and the school themselves was bragging about it is how they learned and so there's a revolution
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:48.040]  going on by government corporations is just spy on us and nobody's getting prosecuted nobody's
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:54.680]  getting in trouble and this stuff is opening us up these back doors to private hackers and other
[02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:59.400]  groups to steal our data but it is coming to a head mr benney in the three minutes before
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:04.840]  break this is short segment you say you do see things getting better uh how do you see that
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:11.640]  worm turning what needs to be done well i need i think uh fundamentally they need to have uh
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:19.800]  a restructuring of how nsa is permitted to do business and it requires some very simple laws
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:25.240]  would handle it like for example if they simply said to nsa or any other intelligence agency or
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:29.400]  any agency of the government of the united states if they were trying if they were if they were
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:34.040]  holding data about a u.s citizen that they must have a warrant otherwise they must purchase their
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:40.840]  database of that data that would be pretty simple so that would that would eliminate any possible
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:45.000]  way of them uh you know having secret uh interpretations of anything and so they can
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:50.440]  scoop it scan it but then purge it right exactly they'd have to purge it and they'd have to
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:56.520]  require they require a time limit of at least no more than you know say you have 24 hours to
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:01.240]  recognize this if you don't recognize that you have a u.s citizen there without a warrant
[02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:07.400]  and you delete it then you are now in violation of the law so that would put them right on the spot
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:14.440]  and uh that would make it almost impossible for them not to not to fall follow the law
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:19.880]  because then then you need to prosecute them once you once you find something like that you
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:23.800]  have to follow through if you don't follow through then there's no teeth behind the law
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:28.760]  just like right now when it comes to whistleblowers they follow through the in the law and they
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:34.120]  prosecute people but when it comes to administration people like general portray us or anybody else
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:38.520]  that does things they get slaps on the hand and never get really get prosecuted or anything or
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:43.560]  threatened so that's an inconsistent application of the law and they need to be consistent in
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:49.960]  what they do and they need to follow through with everybody what are some of the other solutions
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:55.400]  william benning uh well i mean they're a very simple i mean if you take a technical approach i mean
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:04:01.000]  we already developed a technical approach that would allow them to a focused attack on on terrorism
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:06.920]  or dope smuggling or international crime and we left it with them and they basically ignored it
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:11.880]  because it didn't get this bulk information acquisition system which was the thing that
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:17.960]  really requires lots of money uh and builds an empire and so that's fundamentally uh why they
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:24.600]  went that way uh so so uh they should implement that but they aren't and that's all come that by
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:33.880]  the way is all a part of the dodi g report um uh uh it it was it's titled trailblazer and thin thread
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:43.000]  requirements that was all documented in that and and the and tell the nsa and also uh dod and everybody
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:46.840]  tried to suppress that as much as they could because they didn't want that knowledge out of
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:52.680]  course well i mean that that's how you suppress any any reasonably good development that would
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:57.640]  make it uh lawful in what you're doing sure stay stay there sir we're gonna take calls
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:03.560]  economic upheaval has enveloped the european union this year as a result of bailout practices
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:07.480]  that have done nothing but make these countries more insolvent well french president france
[02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:12.120]  while haland has proposed a solution he recently suggested that every member of the eurozone
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:15.800]  transfer all their sovereignty to a newly created federal government in other words it would
[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:19.800]  essentially be a united states of europe the government would have a prime minister a parliament
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:23.640]  a federal budget and a federal treasury that's a pretty good suggestion since your original
[02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:28.120]  eurozone bureaucracy and parliament didn't do anything to help these financial crises except
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:32.360]  make the banks richer let's create another big bureaucracy that we can feed money into
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:36.200]  therefore kicking the can down the road just a little bit farther michael schneider notes that
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:39.960]  during times of emergency the elites are often able to push through things that they would never
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:45.080]  be able to accomplish under normal circumstances and for those of you keeping score a year ago the
[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:51.720]  euro to dollar ratio was 1.35 today it's come down to 1.08 clearly the european union is faltering

[02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:39.640]  alex jones when you study legislation when you study the news you really marvel at the
[02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:47.480]  revolution of criminality in major corporations and government where they get together in
[02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:54.920]  these big corporate lobbying boards and just basically decide to buy off the politicians
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:05.320]  and then en masse they just violate the law not just countrywide but worldwide and they do it with
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:11.320]  the same playbooks it really is organized crime that's what i'd call it organized crime same
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:16.600]  stuff that brought down mexico that i've seen bring down third world countries is bringing us down i
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:24.840]  mean we've got a video that's up on info wars dot com out of mbc atlanta channel 11 called the back
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:34.280]  room where georgia bills are made and then it just says here sign your name here legislatures
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:43.320]  supporting this bill and we'll pay an x number of money and it just shows how the country's up for
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:47.880]  sale and it's one thing of lobbyist lobbied for stuff that's legal but a lot of times the lobby
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:53.960]  for stuff that's illegal then they'll just change the law later to get in line with what they've
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:58.920]  just done it's simply amazing and then there's how the nsa and i want to go to your phone calls
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:05.400]  william benning there's how the nsa is constantly getting caught along with other major corporations
[02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:13.160]  it works with stealing data from economic groups for economic warfare but not even giving it to
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:21.160]  u.s companies farming it out to international groups i mean it is such an unlevel playing field
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:27.000]  and with this amount of inside knowledge they can corner any market they want mr benning
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:32.360]  that's my greatest concern after foreign countries being able to go through all these back doors and
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:38.280]  our systems as we just saw with the 21 million people working for the government having their
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:45.720]  data stolen by the chinese government is that it allows select crony groups to corner global
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:52.520]  markets with the inside knowledge yeah that basically gives them the power to be able to do
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:59.640]  that yeah that's right that's that's a major a major issue i mean even within the country
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:07.240]  they can do that like they can leverage companies inside any country also how do they do that well
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:11.640]  it's just a matter of seeing the data that they're doing if you're if you're bidding for a contract
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:18.680]  for example whether it's internationally or or within the country uh then any conversation or
[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:24.520]  any data you're you're pricing you're trying to price your your bid uh that information would
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:28.760]  be flowing around your your company and that could be acquired and then they would know everybody's
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:34.600]  bidding position and then they could position themselves to win the contract and that's just
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:41.320]  the tip of the iceberg that's right yeah i mean it's a question of whether you can trust them
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:46.200]  how how can you trust people who don't tell you the truth i mean that's the how can the public
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:49.640]  trust anybody in the government because they've never been i mean they have a consistent track
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:58.280]  record of lying to us there seems to be a over-the-top arrogance a bravada a hootspa in government
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:04.440]  and i'm not a republican or democrat but it seems like under obama that has really intensified
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:09.320]  is it just the corruption's growing and so it's going to get worse no matter who's in
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:16.040]  or is there something different about the obama administration uh i think it's pretty standard
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:20.840]  i mean i think it was there with the bush administration it just uh it just got worse
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:27.480]  with obama i mean i think he's basically doubled down on what bush was doing so that now there's
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:33.560]  twice as much capability as existed before so it's a matter of uh if you have the power
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:38.760]  i you know how much power do you have and how much can you exercise a bit and i think that as that
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:45.560]  knowledge grows that power grows and so therefore they have greater capabilities of of doing more
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:50.520]  and more things so i think it's only a matter of whatever administration is in they're going to use
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:56.120]  that power that's available and that means that that means that all of this information is being
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:13:01.480]  collected on this grand scale and the accelerating scale is only going to make it more possible for
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:06.760]  them to do what they want to do and now it's come out that not just the dea but the fbi all of them
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:12.840]  are doing parallel construction with fake court cases setting people up i mean it's it's it's it's
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:19.080]  like i thought if we exposed the evil it would dissipate instead the the the devil just sits
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:25.880]  right next to you and says yeah i'm here and then yeah and in fact uh we we had we had talked to the
[02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:31.800]  president's uh civil liberties oversight board about this about the parallel construction and the
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:37.880]  and the corruption and and uh uh uh subversion of our entire judicial process and they had they
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:43.320]  told us that the administration assured them that if any of this information ever was used again
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:48.200]  against someone in a court of law that that defendant would be told well i have yet to
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:54.760]  hear of a case where that's happened and the feds have a 97 conviction right uh let's talk to
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:59.080]  steven virginia you're on the air with an american hero william benny go ahead steve
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:06.120]  yeah steve i think with this opm reach i think that a lot of people don't realize that not only
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:13.560]  are they guilty but so is the fbi and agencies like cia well they invest a lot of money in their
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:20.200]  employees they're burned why would the cia have any confidence in the fbi to do background
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:29.000]  investigations in which their employees get burned basically the sf 86 is useless and the american
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:36.440]  people they don't trust our government anymore and quite frankly as a consumer i cannot buy a
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:45.640]  flexible spread spectrum audioizer where i can secure my phone conversation using spread spectrum
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:52.200]  audio in which i have the flexibility of buying crystals and hardware to make my system clear
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:59.320]  so that the nsa can't have my phone how come there ain't any hardware manufacturers
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:07.240]  coming out there and doing it absolutely that's a great question uh why why aren't people making a
[02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:14.280]  billion dollars uh off of uh encryption systems i mean is the big problem feasibility or is the
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:20.760]  government coming after you mr benny uh what if you've noticed uh there's this discussion about
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:28.680]  nist and nist approval of encryption system for commercial use so uh the point is that nist and
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:33.960]  nsa are together so that when an encryption system goes to nist for testing and approval for commercial
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:39.160]  application nsa knows about it and they see the algorithm and they they are the ones who actually
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:44.040]  approve it behind so nist and the patent office and all of them give the keys of the kingdom
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:49.320]  to any new right system that's correct right and if it doesn't if it doesn't get approved by nist it
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:56.360]  doesn't get it commercially accepted is there any over-the-counter uh online software for skype
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:16:02.040]  or for google or for any other communication system that encrypts it good enough where they're not
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:08.360]  going to be able to mess with it well with the bull run program uh it makes all of that uncertain
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:14.840]  anyway so it's really hard to say that there is anyone that is in fact secure including the government
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:20.600]  including the government yeah total insanity absolute insanity you know i know i mean it's
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:25.160]  even more insane than that though alex if you look if you look at one part of nsa is the information
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:29.880]  assurance directorate that's supposed to secure the communications of the united states right
[02:16:30.440 --> 02:16:34.360]  and the other parts of operations they're supposed to break into these communications well
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:39.720]  if you look at this this is now dealing with the worldwide standard of the internet so on the one
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:43.240]  side that they're trying to protect it on the other side they're trying to break into it and when
[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:48.200]  they break into it they don't tell the defense side that they've done that so they can't defend
[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:54.840]  against that you see so they're actually working against one another and that's even just within
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:17:00.280]  in a sense that should be illegal yeah it should be it's actually stupid isn't it
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:09.320]  you know i don't know if atlantis was real or not mr benny but the analogy the parable is
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:13.880]  certainly useful but they got a super technology and blew themselves up i don't know if we're
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:18.760]  going to make it as a species acting this stupid when our own leadership behaves like this i mean
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:24.760]  they have to know all these backdoors and all this ubiquitous tech and everything these trojan
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:30.840]  horses and all the appliances is going to backfire on them i mean why would anyone want to do something
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:36.680]  like this yeah i i totally agree i mean they certainly should uh if they're going to have
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:41.160]  an effort they should coordinate it and they should make it uh they should make it where it
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:46.680]  actually does protect people and and their communications for privacy and what have you
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:51.560]  well lane nazis coming up at the bottom of the hour he was in nsa security but i've talked to a
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:56.440]  lot of their folks high level like you middle level like him and they all said look we didn't
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:01.800]  spy on anybody domestically until a few years before 9 11 you would get you know in deep trouble
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:09.480]  for that everybody knew this is america 1984 we don't do that and then just suddenly somewhere
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:15.960]  it all just changed where it's a free-for-all where was that point well it the actually the
[02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:21.960]  9 11 event was the uh was the leverage that they used to do this in secret you know it that was
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:26.440]  the ultimate threat that they could use to intimidate people to buy into the programs
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:30.600]  that's what they did with the four members of congress the house and senate intelligence
[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:35.080]  committee chair and ranking member and that's that's what they also did with the the senior
[02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:39.720]  judge on the fiza court so once they co-opted them in and had it running for a couple of years
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:44.040]  then they co-opted more people in on the court and more people in on the in the congress the
[02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:49.240]  leadership once they got that leadership in you see and at the same time they had the department
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:54.600]  of justice the attorney generals and so also co-opted in it was all based on this false premise
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:19:01.160]  that if we don't do this kind of thing we're going to be exposed to a lot of uh more terrorism
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:05.720]  when in fact the cia did a very good and effective job taking care of terrorism world
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:13.000]  william your phone just caught up start back over you said the cia did an effective job and it
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:19.160]  caught up uh well they probably didn't want you to hear it but they did a really professional
[02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:24.520]  effective job at getting rid of the worldwide network of terrorism when they went into afghanistan
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:29.880]  that really that really wiped out their capacity to do an international attack that was really a
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:36.280]  very competent professional job and they did they deserve our appreciation for that but then now
[02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:43.320]  they've reconstituted it with the free syrian army funded by nato and now it's bigger than ever yes
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:48.600]  well when you when you don't follow up success with the smart programs you you allow things to
[02:19:48.600 --> 02:19:54.760]  reconstitute themselves that's their problem they won't even call this guy and chat into a
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:20:00.120]  terrorist can you believe that i know i can't because obviously i mean that's obviously what it was
[02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:06.840]  it's just insane political correctness to the point of mental illness
[02:20:07.800 --> 02:20:12.520]  that's right they have to delude themselves into thinking that uh what their thought process
[02:20:12.520 --> 02:20:17.560]  is is correct and that's basically what they've done let's jam in some more calls sorry go ahead
[02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:24.040]  no i was just saying they're mentally uh corrupting their thinking that's it they're
[02:20:24.040 --> 02:20:27.640]  smoking their own dope as they say i skipped this break we're going to go 10 minutes and
[02:20:27.640 --> 02:20:32.040]  let our guests go and then Wayne Madsen joins us with some breaking news christ in new york
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:38.600]  you're on the air thanks for holding thank you alex thank you mr benny um i want to know
[02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:46.360]  william's take since we now live in the uh process of understanding the human domain
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:55.880]  how can this be connected with the washam ibm computer that may be connected in the future
[02:20:55.880 --> 02:21:01.800]  with obama care and deciding the health care of our citizen oh it is actually that's a great
[02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:07.080]  question that ties into obama's secret race database data mining everything that ties
[02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:12.200]  into his new gun control database where they're going to use a program used by the va i mentioned
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:17.480]  that earlier to just throw people on a list saying that because you get disability funding you
[02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:23.720]  can't have a gun uh can you speak to computers being programmed to make the decisions for humans sir
[02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:30.200]  oh yeah sure that's in fact that's one of the that's really one of the main driving factors
[02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:36.280]  for the white house big data initiative that they issued in early 2012 the whole idea there was to
[02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:41.880]  have uh industry come up with algorithms that could uh go through massive amounts of data which
[02:21:41.880 --> 02:21:46.600]  they're collecting on everybody in the country and the planet and figure out the things that are
[02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:52.600]  important for them to do and uh to our actions they should take basically it's minority report on a
[02:21:52.600 --> 02:21:58.360]  supermassive scale that's how to figure out what people are intending to do or what they're all about
[02:21:59.320 --> 02:22:04.600]  from the data that you've acquired on them in every domain and it's all done automatically
[02:22:04.600 --> 02:22:09.720]  with software then presented to people to make decisions and take actions that's that's part
[02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:13.640]  of what i think you're getting at alex and also i guess what the caller is getting at
[02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:21.160]  and if that is quite i mean that's basically artificial intelligence being used and applied
[02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:27.240]  uh on under a rule-based system that's being developed by analysts in many many departments
[02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:32.840]  of government none of whom are using things in a necessarily a disciplined or professional way
[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:37.080]  so they're going to make a lot of mistakes well it's like you said six months ago in a london
[02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:43.800]  guardian when you testify before the parliament uh or the EU parliament the NSA is about total
[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:50.200]  population control close quote this is social engineering uh so they can manipulate markets
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:56.760]  know what we're going to buy before we buy it uh i mean a microcosm is the old customer loyalty cards
[02:22:56.760 --> 02:23:02.600]  that it's been proven in court are to decide what you'll pay more for so they can rip you off
[02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:07.880]  not so you get a loyalty card you just think you're you're you're getting something for nothing but
[02:23:07.880 --> 02:23:15.080]  really you're being gamed and now they want to just feed all data federally through this system
[02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:21.640]  and get industry to do it i guess kind of legalizing it yeah well that's uh that's basically
[02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:26.200]  the whole idea behind all this big data white house big data initiative too that's the same
[02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:31.960]  it's the same issue it's getting back to the being able to do uh what what the the movie the
[02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:36.840]  minority report depicted mentally people were reading their minds and projecting into the future
[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:41.480]  well they're they're they're doing that and wanting to do that with data collected on everybody
[02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:47.640]  in the in all domains of the activity of people including their health finance and everything
[02:23:47.640 --> 02:23:54.760]  else and and then do that kind of projection uh with that with software running against that
[02:23:54.760 --> 02:24:00.760]  data chilling simply chilling thank you chris uh great question and let's go to you gene
[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:06.440]  in missouri you're on the air william benning good afternoon guys um i'm thinking about writing
[02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:12.040]  an article on this and you guys have touched on all of the important points with this uh the spying
[02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:17.720]  of government leaders the spying of all populations the merging of countries in the lemakala per
[02:24:17.720 --> 02:24:25.720]  country um i would say that this is in an era of race dating the ultimate form of racism against
[02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:33.960]  the human race all of this spying it is it's a tiny elite using ai systems to surveil everyone
[02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:41.640]  to rig everything for a totalitarian takeover yeah so in an age of race dating this really is
[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:47.400]  just racism for the whole human race if you're not above the fray well that's what i've been
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:52.200]  saying they're getting us to end fight while they set up the end game of basically artificial
[02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:59.400]  intelligent systems to just set up a hellish system i appreciate your call mr benning if we
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:04.760]  don't turn this around the way this is being used this commitment to authoritarianism we're seeing
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:12.840]  where do you see it ending sir if things don't go well well i see us uh basically uh i see it
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:20.600]  ending up in the in basically destroying the essence of humanity i mean that fundamentally
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:29.720]  we won't be able to be human anymore that's the way i look at it i agree that's what i mean that's
[02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:35.080]  why i mean that's why you know we fought a revolution right well the essence of humanity
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:40.200]  is free association is privacy so many historians and philosophers have pointed out if you don't
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:47.960]  have privacy you don't have humanity that's right that's the way i look at it too but then notice
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:53.880]  the elites they want to be secret spying on them's illegal and it should be but when they spy on us
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:59.000]  it's no big deal so it is the ultimate form of discrimination isn't it yes it is it's a
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:07.800]  discrimination against humanity my gosh the rise of the machines with a tiny technocracy
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:13.240]  controlling it above the law it's not a science fiction book it's 2015 and we're talking to the
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:19.000]  whistleblower william benney jeremy in kansas you're on the air this is the infall war go ahead
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:27.560]  yes i completely agree with uh mr benny's uh solution of the sunlight of truth to be our
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:34.200]  main remedy here um i'd like for his take on the evidence for september 11 treason
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:39.560]  which one strain of this is the cover up here in kansas we have congress people like uh
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:45.960]  representative pompeo and senator roberts senator roberts uh stood down ns a whistleblower
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:53.160]  russel teiss coup while he was um in i think air force intelligence saw the papers for the
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:27:00.200]  wiretapping of supreme court justices and then senator obama so we have an obvious evidence
[02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:06.600]  strain of um blackmail for why there's a cover up of this treasonous event and then the direct
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:12.440]  evidence the fact of of all the videos that we can see of a high energetic technology
[02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:19.640]  being used to destroy the buildings and the people in um manhattan that day there was no
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:26.120]  coincidence that the uh saudi pasties were um in a hotel across the street from s a headquarters
[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:31.000]  and michael hayden and also we they were running well let me speak to this because we only had a
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:35.800]  few minutes left and i'll get to a few more calls but what about the 28 pages now we've had
[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:41.000]  congressman jones on senator grammis said what's in it that saudi arabia ran 9 11 and that there
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:47.320]  was basically some type of stand down ordered and it came out that the nsa indeed did have the
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:52.760]  intercepts but was stopped from doing its job you were there when all this was happening uh
[02:27:52.760 --> 02:28:01.400]  what's your take on that the nsa management has actually stopped uh stopped using the program
[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:08.120]  thin thread that we wanted which is documented in the dodi g uh report in 2005 which would have
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:11.640]  found all this material that they had in the database that they didn't know they had but
[02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:17.160]  was there prior to 9 11 that would have would have actually given him the foundation to prevent 9 11
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:22.680]  but it also saw and tom drake was able to run this program uh after he took over the pro the
[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:28.920]  thin thread program after we left in in october 2001 he ran it in early 2002 march or april i
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:35.560]  believe it was and in as a part of the fallout of that process against the entire database at nsa
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:40.680]  they found material that showed the dispersal pattern of people who didn't succeeded hijacking
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:48.600]  other planes and and all the information necessary to stop them even before 9 11 um in in august
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:54.680]  starting in there and even going back they found all of the phone calls that uh alexander said
[02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:59.960]  went from the um a yemen facility back to san diego the two agents in san diego the terrorists
[02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:04.680]  there they said they couldn't tell it was in san diego well the program found that very clearly
[02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:10.360]  they were there in san diego the numbers were available and in the database wow so all of that
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:14.600]  data was there and none of it was addressed and it's probably probably some of it might be in
[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:21.560]  the 28 pages you know well it's amazing sir we appreciate your time expose facts dot o r g
[02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:26.120]  they just put a roiders headline on screen that says it all uh where the federal government
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:31.400]  ordered agents to cover up illegal spying against the american people roiders exclusive us directs
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:36.840]  agents to cover up program used to investigate americans i mean this just shows the organized crime
[02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:42.360]  mentality that's taking over mr benny thank you for so much time sir and thanks for your courage
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:49.320]  well thank you alexander and thank everybody there at your show thank you so much we're on the march
[02:29:49.320 --> 02:29:54.680]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.600 --> 02:30:03.160]  here's an update on the chattanooga shooting over the weekend one of the victims died of his
[02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:08.200]  injuries and now the death toll is six including the shooter and the fbi is telling people not to
[02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:12.760]  jump to conclusions and that the shooter may not have had terrorist ties but may have suffered from
[02:30:12.760 --> 02:30:17.880]  depression so here we have another potential mass murder suicide pill incident thanks big pharma
[02:30:17.880 --> 02:30:23.320]  of course mr obdlesy's father was initially on a terror watch list and mr obdlesy's himself
[02:30:23.320 --> 02:30:28.040]  made some interesting trips to the middle east over the last few years but don't look at any of that
[02:30:28.040 --> 02:30:32.840]  it's not a terrorist attack this can only be considered an isolated incident but that didn't
[02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:38.040]  stop general westley clark calling for internment camps for disloyal americans over the weekend the
[02:30:38.040 --> 02:30:42.760]  retired general told msnbc in world war two if someone supported nazi germany at the expense of
[02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:47.160]  the united states we didn't say that was freedom of speech we put him in a camp they were prisoners
[02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:50.920]  of war clark's remarks reveal the mindset of the upper echelon of government those who
[02:30:50.920 --> 02:30:55.400]  disagree with our so-called leaders are now to be rounded up and shut up indefinitely and political

[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:50.120]  ironed out and ready when we already have a whole bunch of stations picking it up at that point i'm
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:54.200]  going to announce it and that's pretty much already kind of happening right now but i'm not
[02:34:54.200 --> 02:34:57.960]  going to make the announcements yet i have a tendency to say this is coming up and then go
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:03.160]  ahead and make the announcement i don't like to say coming up and then keep you waiting but for
[02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:09.960]  reasons of technical issues i don't want to get into the expenses of it but uh it's another big
[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:16.920]  nut for us to crack but the lord's always provided through people like you we need the finances and
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:20.840]  the funds to do this safely and to do this robustly i don't want to be spending all my
[02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:25.560]  time scrounging around trying to make ends meet instead of fighting the globalist toe to toe
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:29.480]  i'll get in the ring with these people i've been in the ring with them i'll go up against their
[02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:35.080]  emplacements tip of the spear so that it's safer for other people to tell the truth i'll be the
[02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:41.080]  canary in the coal mine but i need your support spread the word about the broadcast tell your

[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:16.600]  spectrum a iron curtain of censorship is descending spain just banned criticizing the
[02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:26.280]  government period hard jail time major cities like roamer on the verge of collapse uh we're
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:30.760]  going into a depression and the reason they're getting ready to start censoring people more
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:37.720]  and they're openly admitting it is because they know in this ruling class that people are going
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:43.080]  to wake up and get really upset and really pay attention to what we have to say as things get
[02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:51.400]  more hardcore that's why i want to be on the field as strong as we can be reaching the most people we

[02:37:36.920 --> 02:37:40.760]  this is really going to get the enemy's attention it's why they've already been doubling down their
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:46.360]  attacks against us and i'm not whining quite frankly they could arrest me tomorrow or blow

[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:29.800]  i feel special it is scary and it's scary to also to know that when we fight back we have success
[02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:33.480]  and to realize that the public could take their chains off any minute they wanted to
[02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:37.720]  but their brain dead necoma basically

[02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:53.320]  and if you will continue to spread the word that's the most important thing about info wars dot
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:57.560]  com and prison planet dot com if you'll get a prison planet dot tv membership and share it

[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:08.600]  do you have to lose you are you are putting fuel in this information warfare bomber that will go
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:14.760]  over the enemy targets politically and will drop huge heavy loads directly on the enemy i mean i'm
[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:19.800]  willing to go in every day and so is my crew up against these people to use the bomber analogy
[02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:23.880]  we are not going to back down we're going to never stop the missions until the enemy's defeated
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:28.760]  we don't care how dangerous it is we want to get bigger we want to get stronger we want to force
[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:35.160]  a confrontation we're committed we're ready we are not intending to just slither off at the
[02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:41.720]  opportune time if i completely ever shut down off the air uh and have no way of communicating i will
[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:47.240]  try to go to another country to communicate but not to run but to be able to communicate i will
[02:40:47.240 --> 02:40:52.280]  not be silenced and if they kill me or set me up that won't silence me either and i meant to give
[02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:57.320]  this speech earlier but ran out of time wane madson joins us from wane madson report dot com
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:01.800]  he's been very busy we've been very busy but we're finalizing the fact that he'll do multiple stories
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:07.240]  a month on the ground traveling the world for us uh here in the u.s and abroad he'll also accompany
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:15.400]  myself other reporters uh to add his uh gravitas to what they're doing so it is now happening
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:22.680]  wane madson joins the info wars team and that again is thanks to your support uh and and the fact
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:27.880]  that he's also accommodated us uh and basically is just doing it for the expenses because he
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:32.840]  didn't really want to be paid he just wanted his expenses paid that's he that's how much he realizes
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:40.040]  how serious this is and how committed this is i mean don't don't think later oh my gosh i wish i
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:46.840]  would have realized how real this was this is hard core folks tyranny is now naked now wane i just
[02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:52.600]  ran in for five six minutes so don't don't pause or i'll start interrupting you you've got the floor
[02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:59.640]  you're investigating this dead chef with the clinton's uh you're you're an expert on mccain uh
[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:03.960]  you know trump about him defending trump he's saying he's no hero boy he didn't know how true
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:12.760]  that is uh and of course you've got new nsa info uh so much intel but the word is the missing
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:20.840]  chef that was then found dead on his body he had a letter saying contact larry nickles of
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:26.440]  i'm found dead whatever that means uh so wane madson thank you so much for joining us good to
[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:33.800]  be with you alex uh well and you know every once in a while there's a dead body turns up and you
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:38.680]  know dead bodies are always turning up sometimes there's not no story there but i believe there may
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:46.360]  be a story with uh the former white house executive chef walter schybe and the reason i
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:53.160]  feel so is uh yes he was hired by hillary clinton in 1994 he had been the executive chef at the
[02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:59.880]  greenbrier and anyone who knows about uh how the government would react in the new the event of a
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:05.720]  nuclear war during the cold war knows that the greenbrier resort and hotel on the west virginia
[02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:12.120]  virginia line uh also happened to have housed behind it where congress would go in the event of a
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:19.560]  nuclear attack and uh chef schybe was the executive chef at that resort he was hired from that resort
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:25.080]  so he knew a little bit about the government continuity of government continuity of operations
[02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:30.600]  planning because he of course would have had to have been providing the food for a transfer of
[02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:36.520]  the congress to the underground mountain complex and why i'm saying this is this all has a bearing
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:46.200]  on 9 11 because uh when george w bush took over uh that administration kept the welter schybe on
[02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:54.440]  as the executive chef uh he was on until the bush reelection in 04 and then in january of 05 he was
[02:43:54.440 --> 02:44:02.200]  given his walking papers uh it would have been nice to have uh heard just one of the mainstream
[02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:11.720]  media reporters to have actually read um uh welter schybe's book called white house chef which i
[02:44:11.720 --> 02:44:17.720]  decided i didn't have it i ordered it uh thinking well i wonder what he may have written that may
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:26.360]  have put a a target on his back and now before i read the book um i went back because i distinctly
[02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:31.880]  remembered from the 9 11 footage you remember all the people were running out of the white house it
[02:44:31.880 --> 02:44:37.080]  was a very it was uncontrolled it looked like one of these hollywood disaster movies sort of like
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:43.320]  independence day and i recall one of the people running away from the white house that day had a
[02:44:43.320 --> 02:44:50.200]  big tall chef's hat on and i said well that's obviously somebody that works in the white house
[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:57.320]  kitchen and it turned out it was welter schybe who then gave an interview to rebecca cooper of abc
[02:44:57.320 --> 02:45:03.800]  news who recounted her conversation you can find this clip on the internet on youtube uh with
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:10.600]  she recounted her conversation with peter jennings and she said i i ran into the white house chef
[02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:18.120]  and uh he was very very upset he was too upset to talk on the air all he said is uh he and his
[02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:23.880]  staff understood what happened to the country that day now that's a very strange thing to say
[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:30.120]  because nobody else really knew what was going on i was in dc i was two miles from the pentagon
[02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:36.440]  when it happened nobody really understood what was going on but in reading uh welter schybe
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:43.320]  spoke here it's very interesting what happened because he had a very tortuous relationship
[02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:49.720]  with the bush administration uh not so much w who decided he didn't want to use the talents
[02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:55.800]  of a graduate of the cia i don't mean the central intelligence agency i mean the culinary institute
[02:45:55.800 --> 02:46:04.840]  of america but uh i wonder what secrets of the cia the other cia uh chief chef schybe may have
[02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:14.840]  possessed because um on 9 11 he first he left the white house and then he realized how bad the
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:20.680]  situation was and there was no organized evacuation of the white house and then he heard crackling
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:28.200]  over the secret service walkie talkies incoming aircraft and he went back to rescue his own
[02:46:28.200 --> 02:46:34.680]  staff from the white house kitchen he left again and then someone said uh he said uh what about the
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:39.640]  cafeteria well that that's the navy mess in the white house and they don't report to the white
[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:45.160]  house chef uh that their navy personnel but he went back in a second time to make sure that the
[02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:51.400]  uh the the cooks at the mess were uh got the word to get out and what he was what he was
[02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:57.320]  struck about uh was there was no organized evacuation of the white house no one gave the
[02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:03.160]  order to evacuate now who was in charge that day bush was off in florida dick cheney was
[02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:10.760]  effectively the person in charge at the white house and he did nothing to to organize or order
[02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:17.080]  a an evacuation of the white house staff wasn't he in the bunker yeah he was in the bunker at this
[02:47:17.080 --> 02:47:22.120]  time the president's emergency operations center which is below the white house several stories
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:30.040]  below the white house and um so uh what happened was when when when when uh schybe first realized
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:35.480]  what was going on with 9 11 he said he walked into the uh the chief usher's office now the chief
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:40.280]  usher was a guy named gary walters he had been secret service uniform secret service under
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:47.480]  nixon and then he became the uh an usher under jerald ford and uh assistant usher under jerald
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:52.120]  ford and then the reagan administration made him the chief usher so he had served under like seven
[02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:59.000]  presidents and he noticed that the ushers were watching the television a small television and
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:04.040]  he said what's going on and he saw flames or smoke coming out of one of the world trade center
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:11.240]  towers and and um and then he said uh he saw the the second plane hit and and the chief usher gary
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:18.680]  walters at that point said that's two and he said uh the chef said that echoed in his mind what in
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:24.040]  the world what you know that's two that's a very strange thing to say like what was what was so
[02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:30.520]  important about the number two uh and then later of course he told rebecca cooper uh we understand
[02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:37.240]  what's happening to the country today now let's fast forward uh june 15 jeb bush announces he's
[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:44.600]  running for president in miami on june 16th uh shybe who had since been divorced was with his
[02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:52.840]  girlfriend in teos new mexico he decided to go hiking on a a trail outside of teos on the 16th
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:59.720]  his girlfriend reported him missing and on the 22nd of june a new mexico state police found his body
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:06.840]  in a uh in a ravine that had been uh he was in water of course anybody knows that if a body's
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:13.320]  found in water you can pretty much rule out the toxicology results because they're corrupted by
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:20.280]  the simple process of osmosis and uh so here we have jeb uh announcing and the chef who had it
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:26.920]  like i say did not have a very good uh relationship with the bush family um uh turns up dead in new
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:32.680]  mexico and is this just another uh person who may have known too much about 9 11 may have
[02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:39.160]  known too much about the inner workings of the bush crime family uh and was he eliminated
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:45.480]  because of his knowledge especially at this critical juncture of jeb announcing he's going to run
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:48.760]  for the white house to be the third president bush
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:50:00.520]  please continue so anyway i i i my my my uh my suspicions are uh are heightened about the the
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:06.760]  cause of death uh again it was one of these where the uh new mexico state police immediately
[02:50:06.760 --> 02:50:11.960]  said it was an accident i mean before the autopsy results are in how many times have we seen this
[02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:18.200]  we saw so i you know when i investigated the phil marshal uh a death out in california again
[02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:24.760]  we had these preconceived uh notions by law enforcement that it was suicide uh before you
[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:31.640]  know uh they knew any of the real facts on the you know from the crime scene and um i'm um i i
[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:39.560]  just looking at all the the long long trail of bodies associated with the bush family um and
[02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:45.240]  i've been investigating these tests for several decades i have to come to conclusion that chef
[02:50:45.240 --> 02:50:50.200]  shide was well i mean how many cleaning ladies and maids and cooks end up dying at their houses
[02:50:50.200 --> 02:50:57.720]  yeah marvin bush's maid was run over by her own car i shouldn't laugh it's just ridiculous stay with

[02:54:27.400 --> 02:54:30.520]  and the new york times is so intellectual they had a big spread about women with different
[02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:37.000]  colored arm hair pink blue green i mean this is just the mindlessness all the raw bioshore
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:42.280]  mancs they have us all fighting with each other black sheriffs come out and said obama downplayed
[02:54:42.280 --> 02:54:46.760]  chattanooga because victims didn't look like trayvon look here's where i stand i want when
[02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:54.120]  madsen's take on this than an overdrive we'll get into john mccain i expose that al qaeda was
[02:54:54.120 --> 02:54:59.720]  synthetic pretty much fake a cut out to take our liberties but now funding the free syrian army
[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:05.400]  letting them recruit it's a Saudi arabia proxy army and it's going to have some blowback that
[02:55:05.400 --> 02:55:09.960]  are going to be real shootings in the west now does the government go out sometimes and wind up
[02:55:09.960 --> 02:55:15.400]  mentally ill people to go around attacks absolutely but after we have the shooter in charleston we hear
[02:55:15.400 --> 02:55:21.080]  that whites are to collectively blame well that are muslims collectively blamed and i satirically
[02:55:21.080 --> 02:55:25.320]  said let's ban all mosques and muslims if we're going to ban all rebel flags i don't actually
[02:55:25.320 --> 02:55:30.600]  want to ban the mosques or muslims it was a point that if somebody uses a bush master gun we then
[02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:37.480]  sue bush master well you know it's it's totalitarianism is what it is but Wayne madsen what is your view
[02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:43.320]  on the chattanooga situation and where all that's going because they're now setting up a domestic
[02:55:43.320 --> 02:55:49.160]  homeland security bureau to look for lone wolf extremist but i don't expect they're actually
[02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:54.600]  going to go out and uh you know stop any of these acts it looks more like a domestic police state
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:56:01.320]  well of course i think that this attack in chattanooga let's look to look what what kind
[02:56:01.320 --> 02:56:08.440]  of individual did we have here we had a guy who uh was uh had been a national of kuwait
[02:56:10.200 --> 02:56:15.800]  had apparently grown up in jordan at one point time and visited jordan had also visited yemen
[02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:22.680]  so we hear a lot about profiling people i get i get the third degree when i travel especially
[02:56:22.680 --> 02:56:29.080]  overseas or coming back from overseas by tsa it sounds like this guy was just traveling willy nilly
[02:56:29.080 --> 02:56:36.120]  without anyone asking any questions and uh yeah i agree that he's a terrorist but i have to then
[02:56:36.120 --> 02:56:44.040]  look at why was this particular attack conducted when it was we do know that saudi arabia along
[02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:51.960]  with israel is totally opposed to this uh nuclear deal uh by the p5 plus one countries with iran
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:58.920]  and and and and the time and now i hear on the fox news is all these neocons saying you see you see
[02:56:58.920 --> 02:57:05.160]  by helping uh by having this pact with iran it it's enabling the somehow enabling these
[02:57:05.160 --> 02:57:11.400]  terrorists these sleepers in the united states well this guy is a follower of obviously of the
[02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:19.560]  wahabist uh salafist sect of islam iran happens to be diametrically she is she is and uh there is
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:24.840]  much a target as anyone else are by these salty fanatics well that shows how dumb they think the
[02:57:24.840 --> 02:57:31.080]  public is is that they're always blaming iran for wahabist activities when the two are arch enemies
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:35.960]  yeah i remember george w bush when he was president said he didn't know there was a difference
[02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:43.400]  between sunnis and she is okay so uh i mean that's what we were dealing with then and uh and but i
[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:48.680]  think obama certainly knows the difference so i have to think that this failure by him to basically
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:53.560]  state that this was an act of terrorism in the same manner now that doesn't mean that it was not
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:59.400]  known about in advance by uh certain people especially say the salty government we've been
[02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:05.400]  i heard uh the previous segment with uh philip bennie talking about the 28 pages but the salties
[02:58:05.400 --> 02:58:11.800]  are over there in over their heads on supporting these acts of terror and uh and packing a recruiting
[02:58:11.800 --> 02:58:18.840]  center in chattanooga would be just uh down their alley and then now the king of salty arabia had an
[02:58:18.840 --> 02:58:23.720]  entire giant beach in the south of france cleared of beachgoers in front of their hotels because he
[02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:29.720]  didn't want to look at them i mean this is just it's just a total joke this this this fraud that
[02:58:29.720 --> 02:58:35.000]  is royalty that we have to bow down to back in 70 seconds and overdrive with wane madson i'm alex

[03:00:21.640 --> 03:00:25.080]  we are back live final segment we're with wane madson wane
[03:00:26.120 --> 03:00:32.200]  john mccain i mean you you've talked about him i could go over his history has passed the keating
[03:00:32.200 --> 03:00:39.000]  five all of it the fact that he's just a globalist all the way but trump comes out and says because
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:44.680]  he got captured that's not a hero well i mean it's heroic to fly off the decks of boats and
[03:00:44.680 --> 03:00:48.920]  have that courage and i think that was a stupid comment but boy what if trump really knew about
[03:00:48.920 --> 03:00:54.280]  mccain i mean all the stuff he did being a trustee at the handaway hilton can you give us the data
[03:00:54.280 --> 03:01:03.080]  dump on mccain yeah quickly yesterday july 19th was the anniversary of the worst fire in the history
[03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:12.920]  of the us navy in 1960 july 19th 1967 the uss forestall had a terrible fire on the on its
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:19.320]  flight deck 100 well over 100 sailors were killed many others were burned horribly
[03:01:19.320 --> 03:01:26.840]  uh back in the 2008 campaign i met with some of the people who were on the forestall and they
[03:01:27.480 --> 03:01:34.840]  conveyed a story that was uh incredible that mccain who they said was uh of course
[03:01:35.480 --> 03:01:40.280]  injured what because he was in his aircraft on the flight deck when the fire broke out
[03:01:40.280 --> 03:01:47.160]  that he was his nickname was called johnny wet start and a wet start is where a guy on the flight
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:53.080]  deck would basically rev his engines and then you know how you shake a lighter and then you flick
[03:01:53.080 --> 03:01:58.520]  flick it and you get like a big flame shoots out well that apparently it was possible to do that
[03:01:58.520 --> 03:02:08.040]  with his uh his aircraft his a4 aircraft and and and and so um uh that there was an issue
[03:02:08.040 --> 03:02:15.320]  that mccain and the co of the forestall captain belling were using 1935 bombs thousand-pound
[03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:21.000]  bombs because you get more bang for your buck when you drop these things over hanoi or high fong
[03:02:21.880 --> 03:02:29.960]  other people said look they're unstable it's 1935 munitions use a safer 500 pound bomb
[03:02:29.960 --> 03:02:38.200]  and uh and mccain who wore his daddy's rank his dad was a commander of the pacific fleet
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:45.000]  uh he decided uh no no i want to use a thousand pound bombs and uh and so he and the co
[03:02:45.560 --> 03:02:54.280]  basically conspired uh to keep using these so when mccain uh did this johnny wet start maneuver
[03:02:54.280 --> 03:03:01.560]  apparently cooked it cooked off a zuni rocket that was in the plane behind his now the navy
[03:03:01.560 --> 03:03:07.560]  court of inquiry shows footage of though that's impossible mccain's plane was uh the the uh
[03:03:07.560 --> 03:03:13.000]  back of it was parked out to the sea so nothing could have he couldn't have done anything uh like
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:17.800]  that well look the navy handled the board of inquiry and one thing i know about the united
[03:03:17.800 --> 03:03:23.640]  states navy having served in the navy ten years of active duty in four years in the reserves
[03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:28.760]  is that the one thing they excel at is cover-ups i've seen more acts of cover-ups in the navy
[03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:35.000]  than acts of heroism and uh and what the navy court of inquiry did in that case of the forestall
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:41.400]  fire was to exonerate mccain uh make sure that nothing stuck to him as a matter of fact he was
[03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:49.720]  the first uh sailor uh taken off of the um forestall and and helicoptered over to the iriskeny
[03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:55.160]  because people on the forestall i was told by crewman knew what he had done and wanted uh
[03:03:55.160 --> 03:04:01.720]  basically wanted to um have a piece of johnny wet start uh after they saw their friends blown off
[03:04:01.720 --> 03:04:09.320]  the flight deck and horribly burned uh so uh i i just wonder whether donald trump uh uh uh knew
[03:04:09.320 --> 03:04:14.200]  about the uh the the significance of yeah and by the way this has even been in mainstream news
[03:04:14.200 --> 03:04:19.640]  a decade ago this is known and then i've had the people on it's come out about how he was a trustee
[03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:25.960]  at the hannoy hilton who got women good food everything yeah and that he uh i was told by
[03:04:25.960 --> 03:04:32.680]  people uh in during the oa campaign some of them were p o w's in vietnam north vietnam said
[03:04:32.680 --> 03:04:38.040]  he was singing like a canary that he gave six months worth of navy operational flights you
[03:04:38.040 --> 03:04:42.760]  know planning schedules to the north vietnamese uh for better treatment so it's worse than trump
[03:04:42.760 --> 03:04:50.040]  said it's not the city's not a hero he's a traitor yeah it's worse we know this he's a piece of work
[03:04:50.040 --> 03:04:57.800]  wane madson thank you so much for your time nightly news is tonight seven o'clock central
