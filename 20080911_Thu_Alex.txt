[01:18.320 --> 01:27.160]  majority of the planet knows that 9-eleven is an inside job the people
[01:27.160 --> 01:32.480]  everywhere are accepting this fact they are looking at the evidence and then
[01:32.480 --> 01:39.560]  they are questioning so many other quote facts the establishment had bluff them
[01:39.560 --> 01:47.600]  into hoax them into in the past and so today we're going to have lucard dalski

[02:37.600 --> 02:42.280]  for a new 9-eleven investigation and goes further saying that the government
[02:42.280 --> 02:46.040]  wanted to stage terror attacks against Iran
[02:48.560 --> 02:54.360]  because Senate says seeks the truth not fake political unity and the speech
[02:54.360 --> 02:58.440]  yesterday and says that there needs to be a truth and reconciliation commission
[02:58.440 --> 03:01.920]  to examine what really went on within the Bush White House in the aftermath of
[03:01.920 --> 03:09.720]  9-eleven and they are going to look at 9-eleven being an inside job I will tell

[04:05.600 --> 04:08.720]  public buying the hoax buying the official story put out within minutes of
[04:08.720 --> 04:16.400]  the attacks initiation but instead people have calmly and coldly gone back and
[04:16.400 --> 04:19.880]  looked at the facts of history before 9-eleven all the government sponsored
[04:19.880 --> 04:24.120]  terrorism and they are now studying the events of 9-eleven and events that have
[04:24.120 --> 04:31.640]  come since then and the entire new-old orders facade is collapsing later calls

[06:04.440 --> 06:07.400]  grandmother at some length here recently and she was talking about the Great
[06:07.400 --> 06:11.280]  Depression we were talking about the gas prices the food prices this economic
[06:11.280 --> 06:14.400]  uncertainty we're in these you know really kind of perilous times no one
[06:14.400 --> 06:17.320]  knows where we're headed or where we might end up and she was reminded of the
[06:17.320 --> 06:20.840]  Great Depression and how in those days folks who lived in the country did okay
[06:20.840 --> 06:23.560]  because they had chicken and eggs and they could grow gardens and can their
[06:23.560 --> 06:26.800]  food but how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the
[06:26.800 --> 06:29.920]  cities because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how
[06:29.920 --> 06:32.720]  and they didn't have the chickens in the livestock so it's a lot different for
[06:32.720 --> 06:35.960]  them well we know one thing's certain right now we're headed into much higher
[06:35.960 --> 06:39.680]  prices on food and there is a global food shortage now what can you do to

[08:31.120 --> 08:38.160]  we really should be celebrating the New World Order launch the 9-11 attacks
[08:38.160 --> 08:43.240]  seven years ago today to try to bully and intimidate and terrorize the
[08:43.240 --> 08:48.000]  population of the planet into accepting national security states over every
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.160]  country those national security dictatorships those shadow government
[08:52.160 --> 08:58.120]  systems those imperial regional governments then to plug into the larger
[08:58.120 --> 09:04.160]  international banking cartel and think tank brain system that politically gives
[09:04.160 --> 09:09.240]  them the command and control orders to carry out their operations their
[09:09.240 --> 09:13.960]  operations are to bankrupt economies destroy the middle class dumb the
[09:13.960 --> 09:21.280]  population down and then simultaneously intensify eugenics operations eugenics
[09:21.280 --> 09:28.240]  operations are always expanding and ongoing against every single one of us
[09:28.240 --> 09:32.800]  doesn't matter if you're the Austin police chief or an FBI agent in Chicago
[09:32.800 --> 09:37.080]  or a school teacher in Houston Texas it doesn't matter if you're a nuclear
[09:37.080 --> 09:44.400]  physicist in New Mexico you are under New World Order attack this is the the
[09:44.400 --> 09:50.560]  incredible dark majesty of the New World Order system but it's all in the fine
[09:50.560 --> 09:56.880]  print it's all admitted the enemy operation is public people always say
[09:56.880 --> 10:00.240]  well something like 9-11 is too big it would come out people would find out
[10:00.240 --> 10:06.080]  there there would be whistleblowers there have been but even within the attack
[10:06.080 --> 10:12.520]  itself only a few hundred people knew the full scope of the operation maximum
[10:12.520 --> 10:20.640]  it was a beautifully executed intelligence operation but it failed it was
[10:20.640 --> 10:27.000]  beautifully executed but it still had a few defects that we have exposed
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.240]  namely despite the fact that they ran drills and try to cover it up in the
[10:32.240 --> 10:36.280]  months previous to that they ordered the heads of two different US embassies to
[10:36.280 --> 10:40.240]  let al-qaeda back in the country saying no their al-qaeda designation is CIA
[10:40.240 --> 10:45.720]  cover they work for us they trained them at military bases Pensacola news
[10:45.720 --> 10:49.000]  journal reported that they train at Pensacola the defense language school
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.160]  in Monterey California that was reported by Associated Press the head of the
[10:52.160 --> 10:57.960]  school said what is this these guys are showing on TV were in my class and many
[10:57.960 --> 11:03.160]  other pieces of evidence along those lines and then the drills that day to run
[11:03.160 --> 11:06.400]  a smoke screen so the rest of the government wouldn't realize what was
[11:06.400 --> 11:10.560]  happening so that when different departments of the NSA and defense
[11:10.560 --> 11:15.680]  intelligence and naval intelligence saw the attack profile or the picked up the
[11:15.680 --> 11:19.640]  chatter of the attacks being launched and run and coordinated out of north
[11:19.640 --> 11:26.400]  com out of Colorado Springs and out of Sydar it could be chalked up to stand
[11:26.400 --> 11:33.240]  down major stand down colonel you got confused by the intelligence that's
[11:33.240 --> 11:37.760]  just part of the drill go play golf with your buddies you asked too many
[11:37.760 --> 11:40.800]  questions you're gonna end up in the river and your children are gonna get
[11:40.800 --> 11:51.200]  killed shot up you didn't see that move along collateral damage very sick very
[11:51.200 --> 11:56.440]  dark very twisted but it's a pawn they're just sacrificing a pawn it's a
[11:56.440 --> 12:01.720]  military move in their mind and we're just weak minded because we're not cold
[12:01.720 --> 12:07.680]  blooded to make the moves that secure America but you're not securing America
[12:07.680 --> 12:14.000]  it would be evil and wicked to do these horrible things in the name of the
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.640]  country even if it did help the people there been wicked emperors and kings and
[12:18.640 --> 12:22.680]  elites that have done horrible things in the name of their people who were
[12:22.680 --> 12:30.600]  tribal who did actually love their race or their group there are really store
[12:30.600 --> 12:34.960]  historical examples of that they're very very rare but it always leads into
[12:34.960 --> 12:39.120]  destruction because once the corruption is practiced others get into the
[12:39.120 --> 12:45.560]  imperial power seats into the technocracies control system into the
[12:45.560 --> 12:51.800]  military regime that dominates and you always get a power mad lunatic within
[12:51.800 --> 12:57.480]  just a few decades and you get the very centralized system starts killing its
[12:57.480 --> 13:02.720]  own leaders in power struggles and then falls in on itself so it's a bad model
[13:02.720 --> 13:08.640]  even on how the former special forces operatives in the Israelis and British
[13:08.640 --> 13:12.320]  and US forces that planted the bombs in the buildings the contractors that were
[13:12.320 --> 13:16.840]  involved you know they were sold on this is part of the greater good our greater
[13:16.840 --> 13:23.600]  order you know to defeat the evil Muslims but that itself was a lie and a
[13:23.600 --> 13:31.880]  fraud so that is the mindset of the people that carried out the attacks
[13:31.880 --> 13:37.120]  that's why they did it it is in armies field manuals that have been
[13:37.120 --> 13:42.320]  declassified to stage terror attacks it is part of the command structures
[13:42.320 --> 13:51.680]  arsenal just as a radar relay is or a radio system just as an m16 and 80 pound
[13:51.680 --> 13:58.200]  packed canteen and mesh kit are for an infantry soldier and they've taught the
[13:58.200 --> 14:02.560]  public to act like children and say oh governments don't do wicked evil things
[14:02.560 --> 14:11.400]  elites don't do bad things we read a history book lately and the argument is
[14:11.400 --> 14:15.520]  the Russians are staging terror attacks in Eastern Europe and blaming it on our
[14:15.520 --> 14:20.840]  people we got a fight fire with fire and America's got to do it bigger than
[14:20.840 --> 14:26.360]  better than they ever did we have the stay behind networks as Eastern Europe
[14:26.360 --> 14:35.080]  fell after World War two activate them operation gladio and other operations
[14:35.080 --> 14:41.760]  the NATO option and so they staged hundreds and hundreds of attacks and if
[14:41.760 --> 14:46.000]  you're gonna stage an attack if it's for the children of Italy that they not live
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.800]  under communism we'll sacrifice a few of the children of Italy and blow up
[14:50.800 --> 14:58.920]  school buses little arms and legs blown everywhere the local police arrive and
[14:58.920 --> 15:07.720]  they find out that the leftists did it but the leftists didn't do it so the
[15:07.720 --> 15:12.440]  argument is but the leftist above them stage attacks and blaming on the right
[15:12.440 --> 15:18.440]  wing see and then once you decide it's okay to do this well cook the bomb train
[15:18.440 --> 15:22.680]  the driver give them detonators order FBI agents below you to stand down order
[15:22.680 --> 15:26.920]  your informants who are throwing fits to stand down let the bombing go forward in
[15:26.920 --> 15:42.760]  93 World Trade Center let the bombing go forward with Oklahoma City plant the
[15:42.760 --> 15:47.600]  bombs inside oh but 168 that didn't upset people enough we weren't able to
[15:47.600 --> 15:50.640]  set up our national security dictatorship and bring it from out of the
[15:50.640 --> 15:57.320]  shadows into the public and absorb what's left of the Republic for everyone's
[15:57.320 --> 16:04.520]  security so there will be peace so now you stage a 9-11 and that gets you two
[16:04.520 --> 16:09.080]  wars and trillions of dollars into your bank accounts because that's really what
[16:09.080 --> 16:13.680]  it's all about the very people you know even if we had gung-ho pro-america
[16:13.680 --> 16:17.200]  individuals and that's how it all started staging terror attacks it would be
[16:17.200 --> 16:24.200]  wrong because it leads to expansion of that tool it leads to more corruption it
[16:24.200 --> 16:33.480]  leads to legitimizing those forms of warfare and then your elite totally
[16:33.480 --> 16:38.320]  sells out to the foreign corporations and the moneymen and they're handing over
[16:38.320 --> 16:43.640]  whole city governments to private corporations to loot the public to tax
[16:43.640 --> 16:50.800]  the public forget fascism this is corporations becoming the government and
[16:50.800 --> 16:56.480]  they hand over the roads and the water and the schools and everything and then
[16:56.480 --> 17:00.760]  they own the private defense training compounds and the private prisons and the
[17:00.760 --> 17:04.800]  red light camera companies and the face scanning companies and the defense
[17:04.800 --> 17:09.480]  structure just takes over the whole economy and makes the people the enemy
[17:09.480 --> 17:13.800]  you are not American patriots you out there listening that we're involved in
[17:13.800 --> 17:20.640]  the attacks I know a lot of you are shocked like no one out here doesn't
[17:20.640 --> 17:24.440]  understand history or your mindset of your plan or what you were told or how
[17:24.440 --> 17:29.760]  you were led into this darkness you think we can't handle the truth you don't
[17:29.760 --> 17:34.320]  think we don't understand how you were corrupted how you were twisted you think
[17:34.320 --> 17:40.280]  you're strong because you could kill those 3000 people for our betterment look
[17:40.280 --> 17:43.640]  at you live in a five million dollar house look at you with all your Swiss
[17:43.640 --> 17:50.240]  bank account funding and all you are is some retired special forces colonel you
[17:50.240 --> 17:55.080]  did it for wealth and power you like killing people but because you have a
[17:55.080 --> 17:58.720]  little bit of a soul left and because you're not a true psychopath but you
[17:58.720 --> 18:03.600]  were someone who was twisted you have rationalized what you did because you've
[18:03.600 --> 18:07.320]  seen so much death in your life look at how you were trained look at how you were
[18:07.320 --> 18:11.480]  led into darkness look at how at each point you were tested and each time you
[18:11.480 --> 18:15.600]  were twisted just a little bit more look at how you were turned into evil
[18:15.600 --> 18:19.920]  until you're blowing up daycare centers in Oklahoma City and in the world trade
[18:19.920 --> 18:25.600]  centers until you're killing children and you say well what did we do when we
[18:25.600 --> 18:30.320]  bombed resident we killed 500,000 people most of them children in one night what
[18:30.320 --> 18:36.720]  did we do in Hiroshima and not the sake it's just war Jones yeah it's just war
[18:36.720 --> 18:42.960]  on your own people so so you could loot the pension funds so nobody would look
[18:42.960 --> 18:46.760]  at how you stole trillions out of the Pentagon so you could turn our whole
[18:46.760 --> 18:51.160]  country upside down and take our bill of rights and Constitution get it out of
[18:51.160 --> 18:54.760]  your head that you're patriots because I know a lot of you even though you're
[18:54.760 --> 18:59.560]  evil still have this idea it was the doorway you entered into that you did

[19:22.720 --> 19:26.320]  up buildings after you stage terror attacks after you ship heroin and cocaine

[19:30.360 --> 19:35.440]  Barton kidnap children and make snuff films with them why not just go all the
[19:35.440 --> 19:41.560]  way you know after all why not just do anything that's what you've done and it's

[20:04.520 --> 20:08.400]  and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and
[20:08.400 --> 20:12.320]  parasitic infection you may be one of millions of people suffering from one

[21:03.920 --> 21:08.560]  terrorist act of war against this country the enemy struck America on
[21:08.560 --> 21:14.080]  September 11th but who is the enemy bin Laden this is his ammo we have to look
[21:14.080 --> 21:17.720]  to the Middle East we have to look to Osama bin Laden. Fabled enemies is the
[21:17.720 --> 21:21.560]  first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[21:21.560 --> 21:25.760]  networks inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there are
[21:25.760 --> 21:31.480]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that
[21:31.480 --> 21:36.480]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. In Laden's connections to the CIA the
[21:36.480 --> 21:40.360]  hijackers ties to the FBI the Saudi Arabian connection the Israeli
[21:40.360 --> 21:44.240]  intelligence network warnings and war games the shadow government and much much
[21:44.240 --> 21:49.520]  more. Fabled enemies get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high
[21:49.520 --> 22:01.320]  quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv. Have you ever
[22:01.320 --> 22:04.280]  felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial
[22:04.280 --> 22:08.680]  affairs I continue to hear stories about property seizures frozen bank accounts
[22:08.680 --> 22:12.640]  confiscation of stocks and bonds it makes me wonder if the US citizen will
[22:12.640 --> 22:16.240]  ever again have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
[22:16.240 --> 22:20.400]  unfortunately with the drug and money laundering act the IRS revenue ruling

[24:31.480 --> 24:49.480]  it's a class thing to kill your fellow countrymen they have a greater understanding of the elite that some of us have to be killed for our own good to train us to go out and attack their enemies but it's not for our own good
[24:49.480 --> 25:04.480]  remember they'll bomb Dresden and kill 500,000 in one night you say yeah they're not human killing but they'll also radiate 4,000 plus US foster children in radiation chambers to death
[25:04.480 --> 25:16.480]  and then well we're the good guys we're fighting evils so we'll just control the white slavery trade too you know because somebody else will control that trade if we don't so we'll make it big and industrialized
[25:16.480 --> 25:26.480]  now now now that's the mid-level minions a lot of them just like raping killing people so they're just pure evil there's also a lot of them who are doing all this for Jesus
[25:26.480 --> 25:34.480]  so Israel's got to be safe because if we don't save Israel we'll go to hell it says that you've got to do whatever Israel says you go to hell
[25:34.480 --> 25:46.480]  I guess all the prophets were bad then for rebuking Israel when it was being bad you see it's totally twisted and so we've got to protect the good by staging terrorists of the Lord
[25:46.480 --> 25:51.480]  of course the controllers laugh at those guys who go out and do all their dirty work for them
[25:51.480 --> 26:05.480]  we got Rob Jacobson my video editor and camera guy he's on the ground down at ground zero right now with Jason Burmus who's nearby as well and I want to go ahead and go to both of them let's introduce Rob Jacobson
[26:05.480 --> 26:12.480]  Rob give me a quick report on what's happening there at ground zero site of the black off government attack seven years ago
[26:12.480 --> 26:24.480]  Rob you there okay he's doing something else let's bring Burmus up let's go ahead and bring Jason Burmus up Jason you there
[26:24.480 --> 26:29.480]  yes I am I'm sorry they dropped Rob as soon as they picked me up just to let you know
[26:29.480 --> 26:31.480]  I don't know what that means but
[26:31.480 --> 26:34.480]  well I mean he just got disconnected from the phone line
[26:34.480 --> 26:39.480]  we'll call him back okay give me a report Jason on what's going on
[26:39.480 --> 26:48.480]  sure um there's about two to three hundred of us out by Broadway right on the side obviously the front is very restricted this time
[26:48.480 --> 26:54.480]  much more restricted than even last time they've actually started building on the construction site so
[26:54.480 --> 27:03.480]  you can really see what they're trying to build for 2012 is their goal and there isn't a lot going on outside of the pit for the family members
[27:03.480 --> 27:10.480]  I mean you're not seeing the masses you're not seeing people ring the bells you're only seeing people on those side streets
[27:10.480 --> 27:16.480]  over by the path train station and that's that's where we are and you know I was up there very early this morning I got there
[27:16.480 --> 27:23.480]  around 830 it literally took me around ten minutes while a camera was on me to hand out a hundred copies of loose change final cut
[27:23.480 --> 27:29.480]  and as you know Alex I just didn't have any DVDs of fabled enemies but luckily one of your list
[27:29.480 --> 27:35.480]  hundred copies of that as well and I handed them out so you know I'm just trying to bring more people into the fold
[27:35.480 --> 27:43.480]  and you know we're doing the right thing out here there's a lot of great info war sign 9-11 truth signs and you know it's starting to pick up
[27:43.480 --> 27:52.480]  well they're doing everything they can to keep the 9-11 truthers away from it so that McCain can sup on the blood of the dead
[27:52.480 --> 28:00.480]  working for the system that committed the murders and so Barack Obama can have his first blood meal as a full fledged
[28:00.480 --> 28:08.480]  New World Order Wraith and so they can because they love feeding on those they've murdered they love this being part of the system
[28:08.480 --> 28:13.480]  and going up there and grandstanding and having the fireman stand around them and get the reflected glory
[28:13.480 --> 28:17.480]  they love having war heroes around them to get that reflected glory
[28:17.480 --> 28:24.480]  so that they can train the suckers to go along with with further abuse and ritualized murder
[28:24.480 --> 28:35.480]  speaking of ritualized murder they kicked off the big heavy reactor over in Switzerland yesterday
[28:35.480 --> 28:43.480]  and notice that they want to have the new tower that has this occultic height being completed in 2012
[28:43.480 --> 28:50.480]  all of these different esoteric and numerological signs
[28:50.480 --> 28:57.480]  absolutely and it's very frightening to me and you know on the note of McCain and Obama grandstanding
[28:57.480 --> 29:03.480]  you know I was reporting that when I was subbing in for you and just to see it happening is just nauseating to me
[29:03.480 --> 29:10.480]  I mean these guys are not good for either side I had one gentleman who was listening to me speak on the corner
[29:10.480 --> 29:15.480]  he was a crowd gathered one of the debunkers had their camera in my face and I was setting him straight
[29:15.480 --> 29:19.480]  and this guy was digging what I was saying but then I noticed he was wearing a Barack Obama shirt
[29:19.480 --> 29:25.480]  and I just turned to him and I said look man that guy ain't gonna save you you know I'm not trying to make this about race
[29:25.480 --> 29:28.480]  I'm actually voting for a black woman I'm voting for the McKinney
[29:28.480 --> 29:34.480]  he's a much better candidate than Barack Obama and he's like alright man I'll definitely check it out
[29:34.480 --> 29:39.480]  you definitely just spoke some wisdom right there so you know we have so much work to do Alex
[29:39.480 --> 29:43.480]  we've got to wake people up to 9-11 truth we have to wake people up to the false left right paradigm

[32:00.480 --> 32:12.480]  David J Smith for News Watch Magazine did you know the syndicated columnist Charlie Reese once wrote a stinging indictment against the internationalist who have captured our federal government for their own purposes
[32:12.480 --> 32:18.480]  he reported that the present government of the United States is systematically undoing our independence
[32:18.480 --> 32:26.480]  he said that agreeing to belong to the World Trade Organization and taking orders from it was a deliberate sacrifice of our national sovereignty
[32:26.480 --> 32:31.480]  he said the United Nations represents the same threat to our sovereignty

[33:28.480 --> 33:42.480]  we don't have a government that's a nice guy they are absolutely bankrupt spiritually
[33:42.480 --> 34:01.480]  they are completely delusional so it's time for us to not be nice anymore
[34:01.480 --> 34:12.480]  we're not going to blow up men women and children and blame it on our enemies we're not going to put sodium fluoride in the water to jump the public down
[34:12.480 --> 34:23.480]  we're going to aggressively go out and wake the people up just a quick program note for a full hour I was on international Iranian TV their equivalent of Al Jazeera
[34:23.480 --> 34:33.480]  I mean it's on satellites all over the world cable systems everywhere and I had never watched a lot of press TV so I went on there to talk about Russia and other issues
[34:33.480 --> 34:41.480]  global economic issues Iran and on Iranian TV they were basically bashing Russia and Iran
[34:41.480 --> 34:54.480]  see everyone's buffaloed by this the West the corrupt people that run our government and the British government have got everybody buffaloed they go around intimidating lying invading countries they want Afghanistan Iraq
[34:54.480 --> 35:09.480]  and then saying Russia can't defend itself on its own border and then they're even count on Iranian TV trying to act objective objective isn't if you see a red flag say it's green because everybody else says it's green
[35:09.480 --> 35:17.480]  look I'm just going to tell it like I see it I'm going to tell it like the facts show and that's it that's where my allegiance lies is with the truth
[35:17.480 --> 35:33.480]  and I'm sick of the people running our government wrapping themselves in the American flag while they dismantle our republic dismantle our liberties destroy our currency destroy our name I've had enough I've had enough of it I'm sick of it
[35:33.480 --> 35:45.480]  and I certainly don't think the Iranian government's wonderful I know the moolahs run that place with an iron fist and seventy some percent of the people there are pro America and and they're very worldly people
[35:45.480 --> 35:55.480]  they're not stupid they're Iranians are really smart as smart as Westerners and more intelligent now because they're not slurping fluoride for fifty years
[35:55.480 --> 36:11.480]  and they want freedom over there but our government wouldn't give them that they'd go over there and blow stuff up to kick out secular governments to put the moolahs in and they flew in and put the moolahs in we posted mainline government documents yesterday proving that I don't want to hear anymore
[36:11.480 --> 36:31.480]  that I'm for the Muslim extremists the radical Shiites were installed by the CIA in nineteen seventy nine that was all stage that's been declassified you didn't know it and the radical Wahhabis were put into Afghanistan and Serbia and Chechnya
[36:31.480 --> 36:46.480]  and I have had enough of it and they do that so they can bring down secular governments mainline governments that want to be tourist mechas that want to be popular that want to sell oil they want to have free societies
[36:46.480 --> 36:54.480]  and the globalists don't want that because that's an engine of freedom and economic success that will threaten their IMF World Bank takeover
[36:54.480 --> 37:07.480]  and so they put in muslim wind up toys radical muslims to take over and then they spook the west and say oh look the guy in the turban is going to get you that guy in the turban is a finger puppet of the new world order
[37:07.480 --> 37:14.480]  alright finish up what you were saying jason bermus there on the ground at ground zero and then I want to get rob's take on what's happening
[37:14.480 --> 37:29.480]  yeah I was just discussing how you know McCain and Obama are down here to grandstand on both sides of the spectrum and it's time not only to wake people up to nine eleven truth but this false left right paradigm it's time for us to become the government again Alex to
[37:29.480 --> 37:38.480]  the people to get involved in our constitutional process before the rest of our constitutional bill of rights is completely eviscerated
[37:38.480 --> 37:45.480]  absolutely absolutely my friend jason bermus any other points you want to add
[37:45.480 --> 37:56.480]  you know I just want to you know give a big shout out to everybody out there that's doing things outside of new york everybody who showed up to new york I mean I've had a couple of family members last night that I didn't know
[37:56.480 --> 38:10.480]  Ellen Mariani showed up many videos showed up the wife of Deborah Wilson who was lost on flight ninety three I'm sorry the husband of Deborah Wilson who was lost on flight ninety three showed up last night and he's only been awake for about a year and
[38:10.480 --> 38:23.480]  you know when family members come up to me and they pat me on the back and they give me a hug and they tell me you know I was asleep for so long and you know you help wake me up and now I just want to know what I can do to help you get this word out
[38:23.480 --> 38:30.480]  nothing means more to me Alex you know I know we can reach more and more people and I just need more people out there
[38:30.480 --> 38:38.480]  to have the will to do something to tap into their special talent they don't necessarily have to host a radio show or make documentaries there are other ways
[38:38.480 --> 38:45.480]  for instance you know my friend all the way out in Portland Oregon gave me a great deal on a bunch of nine eleven truth signs you know he helped out today
[38:45.480 --> 38:59.480]  somebody you know I think in North Carolina has helped us out with t-shirts before so everybody in every career field can find a way to help this cause to help this movement to bring true patriotism back to this country Alex
[38:59.480 --> 39:16.480]  absolutely Jason you know I watch clips of truth rising I see clips of fabled enemies and I'm just so honored to be involved in projects like this or I watch in game and say my god I made this film or I see loose change
[39:16.480 --> 39:34.480]  final cut I say wow I produced this film you know you directed fabled enemies at a great job these are films that need to be seen I get so busy covering news and having guests on I don't even really plug that these DVDs are available right now at info wars dot com and these films won't be seen and won't have the effect they need to have
[39:34.480 --> 39:53.480]  if people don't get the DVDs at info wars dot com or if they don't download the high quality versions and share those burn them to disk or pass them around on file sharing systems I mean that's how we do everything is you the listeners taking action that's why we've been able to do so much so please get fabled enemies at info wars dot com
[39:53.480 --> 39:56.480]  Jason anything else you want to add
[39:56.480 --> 40:13.480]  no I just want to point out that what you just said is how I got my start literally getting the information burning the info bombs to disk and handing them out to all my friends families strangers acquaintances other human beings Alex I decided to reach out with information that might be troubling
[40:13.480 --> 40:26.480]  that might not make me the most popular because it's the right thing to do and you're right people do need to get these videos they need to make copies they need to sit their friends and families down and make them watch this stuff because we need to change this country and hurry
[40:26.480 --> 40:33.480]  absolutely Jason I know there are provocateurs out there don't mention them by name really stirring stuff up
[40:33.480 --> 40:43.480]  just if anything develops today Ralph Nader scheduled to be popping in we got some other big guess schedule to pop in call in if anything happens you've got the hotline okay
[40:43.480 --> 40:55.480]  one thing for you Alex Michael has who was in the building with Barry Jennings just recently got interviewed by that BBC hitmeister Michael Rudin
[40:55.480 --> 41:10.480]  he's down here we're kind of in contact with him about another matter and he mentioned us that he got an interview with Hess so don't be surprised when Hess recamped everything he said on Fox news that we present in both loose change final cut and
[41:10.480 --> 41:28.480]  fabled enemies absolutely thank you Jason Berners you got it before we go to Rob for a quick report from his perspective at ground zero my main editor he edited Marshall law 911 rise the police state order of death and re edited for the double combo
[41:28.480 --> 41:51.480]  that's dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove he also did expanding from there he did terror storm one and two and in game and now truth rising and he worked as first editor I don't know who first editor is they really did about
[41:51.480 --> 42:07.480]  Aaron on fabled enemies so what a workhorse out there with camera but yes imagine to have Hess imagine to have Barry Jennings both on two different national TV networks that day saying there were he was blowing up dead bodies all this stuff in the building
[42:07.480 --> 42:23.480]  you know deputy head of emergency management and then we interview him but then he gets scared and getting threats so we don't release the interview we should have and then they go on TV and don't say it but then the voiceovers on the BBC say we lied and made it up he never said it
[42:23.480 --> 42:41.480]  and then we produce the video where he did say I mean you know that's just unbelievable unbelievable the debunkers are so dishonest they run around the web on their website saying that no one reported bombs in the buildings no one said get back from the building
[42:41.480 --> 42:55.480]  you know a cop saying get back or then they say oh you're saying cops blew it up no the cops are going I don't know what's going on but they say they're bringing it down they're going to blow it up get back get back get back
[42:55.480 --> 43:13.480]  but I don't just have the videos of the cops on CNN and Fox I've interviewed the police I've interviewed the emergency workers the guys on the videos we went and tracked them down they weren't lying that day they're not lying now
[43:13.480 --> 43:28.480]  and you know we say well we've interviewed police people say you're lying that's a you got to give the source you got to list their name and then they could get courage and go public and then get fired or get in trouble and then it's that cop just a liar that cop's evil get that cop
[43:28.480 --> 43:43.480]  they blew it up okay you got that through your head terrorists are in control it didn't fun fighting them folks it's life and death you know why I go take over MSNBC and let people punch me and hit me and come in with knives all on video
[43:43.480 --> 43:56.480]  because I passed the point of return a long time ago you understand that there's no turning back there's no turning back on this road you got that this is life and death Rob Jacobson what are you seeing down there
[43:56.480 --> 44:16.480]  I got here about a couple of hours ago and there were a few hundred nine eleven truth are standing on the side streets because like Jason reported the main street that crosses in front of the path station where we usually do demonstrations
[44:16.480 --> 44:33.480]  has been totally shut down there's no walkway you have to walk around it so a few hundred demonstrators are on that side street where the federal building is near the church where they're having a memorial inside and one of the things I've noticed is it's not really you know
[44:33.480 --> 44:51.480]  most of the demonstrators out there are from different cities a lot of people traveled in I met people from Northern Virginia I've met people here from Colorado I've met people here from I think Florida as well as other places other cities last night at the
[44:51.480 --> 45:06.480]  Burmese's event more than three quarters of the room when he said he asked the crowd how many people are from out of town it was more than three quarters of the room or from out of town so people are definitely traveling in there you know they're going out of their way
[45:06.480 --> 45:22.480]  I'll tell you one of the interesting things that one of the demonstrators said was and you know they're talking about other members of their groups that couldn't make it in each person there represents you know as many as five ten or a hundred other people that
[45:22.480 --> 45:38.480]  could not travel in you know they're talking about the northern Virginia we are change you're talking about the southern Virginia we are change and how many people are in that group and what kind of activities they're doing around their local community today
[45:38.480 --> 45:53.480]  and I have to know that there are people there are people in New Jersey there are people in California in Texas and Dallas there are folks everywhere in the Netherlands and England and Japan in Ireland and Dublin all over the world people are out exposing
[45:53.480 --> 46:10.480]  a small flag terror go ahead and I also noticed that usually at these nine eleven events you get a little bit of resistance when handing out the DVDs and the pamphlets but really not anymore people are actually walking up and just asking for a
[46:10.480 --> 46:25.480]  question it doesn't seem like the general public everybody knows that the nine eleven truth movement is alive and well and they're very curious I believe that they're more curious because of the media blackout that's
[46:25.480 --> 46:41.480]  occurring people are craving to hear our side of the story already like what are these people talking about people are walking up they're getting the DVDs people almost in crowds I've seen people in fatigue walk talking with some of the nine eleven activists
[46:41.480 --> 46:56.480]  on the street a lot of guys in a marine full uniforms are standing there with nine eleven truth signs out there so the crowd is definitely way more diverse and a lot more the general public is a lot more receptive
[46:56.480 --> 47:11.480]  very curious people out there want to know the facts you know they want to hear the truth already everybody knows that the media is a fraud and you know they sound like a fraud especially Chris Matthews misreporting us
[47:11.480 --> 47:21.480]  don't even you know he's putting words in our mouth saying that our theory is that there's a plunger you know we say that George Bush is in the basement somewhere pushing a plunger
[47:21.480 --> 47:32.480]  that's very transparent hey hey scores of newspapers said that I believe that I'm a Jedi wizard and that I was going to levitate the meant and I failed
[47:32.480 --> 47:45.480]  and the Denver Post was there they said are you part of this protest to levitate the meant I said no but they didn't care all over the news everywhere it's now believed that I believe that I can lift buildings off the ground
[47:45.480 --> 47:54.480]  you see that it's deception but every time they lie they lose more credibility and it's the exact same thing Chris Matthews said we believe he told K. Belly Hutchins in the senator
[47:54.480 --> 48:03.480]  we believe Bush was in the basement of the White House with a plunger like Wiley Kaia blowing it up you see that ain't going to work anymore you pack of liars
[48:03.480 --> 48:17.480]  exactly I mean these stories are becoming more and more ridiculous now you know the public just isn't buying it it's not there's no question anymore because you could see it right here on the street everybody wants to know they're not buying the plunger story
[48:17.480 --> 48:28.480]  you know Chris Matthews is only discrediting himself by making up such a ridiculous far-fetched story I mean the meant supposed to be an investigative journalist at least report on what we're saying
[48:28.480 --> 48:44.480]  but then Limbaugh's fill in host lies and says that MSNBC agreed and said it was an inside job so you have another false paradigm in the controlled media where they try to act like you know the quote liberal mainline media is with us and controlled
[48:44.480 --> 49:00.480]  I mean just absolutely deceptive or maybe that host reported a little secret that Oberman is a 9-11 truth and that's why he's been fired so they are getting and here's the other deal people in the CIA enable intelligence in the FBI they know it's an inside job they're not evil
[49:00.480 --> 49:15.480]  and they're supporting us they're giving us information I mean folks folks it's happening we are winning and people say alive and well this hoax keeps getting put out that 9-11 truth is dead 9-11 truth is dead 9-11 truth
[49:15.480 --> 49:30.480]  I mean Ralph Nader coming out Dennis Kucinich coming out the biggest personal friends he travels with Sarkozy the number one comedian in France one of the biggest in Europe comes out and says it's a total inside job and then he would not recant it
[49:30.480 --> 49:49.480]  he said you know I'm sorry that the facts hurt you but that's what I believe I mean it's every day defense ministers going public I mean it's over it's over people are looking into false flag terror they're finding out there's all these declassified examples where it's not debated and it's over for you terrorists go ahead
[49:49.480 --> 50:02.480]  exactly I mean the proof is right out there if you want to see it's not like three years ago or two years ago where we go out there and everybody would give us crazy looks and who are these guys oh no way
[50:02.480 --> 50:24.480]  nah everybody's coming up everybody's there I mean everybody every single person on the street knows who we are we're they're aware of our message and they want to know more you know there's no secret anymore 9-11 truth is out there and I you know just based on what I witnessed this morning everybody it's mainstream everybody knows
[50:24.480 --> 50:44.480]  every single person I mean everybody's curious everybody's there's no these people are fringe lunatics no we are the movement right now we are the truth movement you know everybody's aware that we're taking place and I believe that even though a lot of people are not wearing the 9-11 truth
[50:44.480 --> 50:57.480]  shirts they themselves are truthers themselves because they want to know the truth they're curious they're putting up the DVDs they're grabbing those flyers by a lot as Burmese reported he gave away 100 DVDs in 10 minutes
[50:57.480 --> 50:59.480]  stay there stay there
[50:59.480 --> 51:14.480]  a day unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this country the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy bin Laden this is his M.O.
[51:14.480 --> 51:24.480]  we have to look to the Middle East we have to look to Osama bin Laden tabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[51:24.480 --> 51:30.480]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[51:30.480 --> 51:34.480]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[51:34.480 --> 52:00.480]  and Laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI the Saudi Arabian connection the Israeli intelligence network warnings and war games the shadow government and much much more fabled enemies get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv either you are with us or you are with the terrorists

[54:19.480 --> 54:48.480]  I get called by different rock stars movie stars that were too afraid to go public like Governor Ventura, Willie Nelson, German Defense Minister Andres from Guido, Italian President, C.I. Sexton Chief Bill Christensen
[54:48.480 --> 54:57.480]  inside job inside job inside job

[55:10.480 --> 55:25.480]  I've got to commit to it I already jumped out of the helicopter I already jumped out of the back of that C-130 I don't know if my parachute's opening
[55:25.480 --> 55:41.480]  and I'm not even worried about it
[55:41.480 --> 55:57.480]  just to close out people are talking about all the events that people are doing outside of New York you know I was just thinking about it I can't wait to see what's going on in other cities around the country today
[55:57.480 --> 56:19.480]  but people are doing you know putting up flyers doing demonstrations making people aware and another thing you know on top of that I hope people remember that it's the persistence today tomorrow every day if they could just do something to keep the word alive to keep it getting stronger because we're definitely at that critical mass right now there's no doubt about it everybody knows
[56:19.480 --> 56:27.480]  and all we've got to do is just keep persisting keep persisting keep getting the message out there and it's too late
[56:27.480 --> 56:48.480]  yeah we've got the enemy on the ropes in the info war and so that's why the enemy's saying your movement's dead your movement's dead no one's listening no one's waking up I mean we've got Keith Oberman talking about Cheney staging terror attacks against our own ships we've got New Yorker magazine it's happening ladies and gentlemen I go on shows all the time that would disagree with me a year ago
[56:48.480 --> 57:04.480]  now they agree they say what do we do we continue to expose that the attack on Russia was a false flag so they would over respond so we could start a new Cold War with them and by we I mean the elite that controls our nation everything is false flags that's what they do
[57:04.480 --> 57:24.480]  exactly and if we just keep their information out there we persistently keep it coming for people who are curious people who do want to read this stuff because trust me everybody is sick of hearing the same old stuff on the main street media people want to hear real information they crave the truth
[57:24.480 --> 57:38.480]  and here's another thing here's another thing and I'm gonna hold you over one more segment Rob to talk about that but I want to bring this up now before the shower ends the police would normally let the provocateurs beat us up attack us now they are removing the provocateurs
[57:38.480 --> 57:53.480]  exactly the provocateurs came by he started a little bit of trouble and police you know they came up to them they asked them hold on I want to hear this after you know why the police did that because everybody knows we'll be right back
[57:53.480 --> 58:21.480]  with their fingers crossed everybody knows the war is over everybody knows the good guys lost everybody knows the fire is fixed the poor stay poor the rich get rich that's how it goes everybody knows

[58:57.480 --> 59:00.480]  do you like being a puppet sir do you like being a puppet for the New World Order
[59:00.480 --> 59:07.480]  how do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage it was engineered by you David Rockefeller that's for a lateral commission to see for
[59:07.480 --> 59:16.480]  the day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door
[59:16.480 --> 59:21.480]  seven years after the attacks of September 11 a global awakening has taken place
[59:21.480 --> 59:26.480]  an inside job how dare you
[59:26.480 --> 59:32.480]  if you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for treason yourself
[59:32.480 --> 59:35.480]  all hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue
[59:35.480 --> 59:41.480]  and if the government has not told the truth in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9th

[59:47.480 --> 59:50.480]  it's now time to take the revolution at the next level
[59:53.480 --> 59:59.480]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[59:59.480 --> 1:00:16.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:37.480]  and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:42.480]  Ralph Nader is confirmed to be on later in this hour
[1:00:42.480 --> 1:00:53.480]  he's gone public for 9-11 truth saying he supports 9-11 truth and wants a new investigation so is Dennis Kasinich he's saying the same thing
[1:00:53.480 --> 1:01:02.480]  they both have giant mainline followings and the fact that I mean Nader's gotten 4 million votes before
[1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:09.480]  and the fact that see that breaks with Noam Chomsky and all those people who's saying you know the MIT guy
[1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:12.480]  no don't look at that no no no the UN will save us
[1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:17.480]  you know no no there's no false flag terror don't know no 9-11 doesn't matter
[1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:21.480]  you know so what if it's an inside job that's a quote so what if the government did it so what does that mean
[1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:28.480]  oh it just means they're totally criminal totally ruthless totally out of their minds with maglemania
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:37.480]  totally bankrupt psychologically skies the limit folks if they'll pull off crazy stunts like that
[1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:45.480]  I mean that is out of control come on government FBI CIA the rest of you you're not all evil
[1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:53.480]  most of your compartmentalized stop playing games we can't let these people continue to operate
[1:01:53.480 --> 1:02:03.480]  the COG is going to take over completely if you don't get your butt in gear now
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:07.480]  Rob Jacobson finish up the point you were making
[1:02:07.480 --> 1:02:15.480]  oh the point I was making was about these provocateurs down obviously they came down there just to cause trouble
[1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:23.480]  that was their mission and they were basically getting people on edge there at the scene
[1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:31.480]  and the cops just came by and they asked them hey these people don't want you around by the noise that's being created
[1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:37.480]  this and that just move across the street the cops you know usher them across the street defuse the situation
[1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:43.480]  and that was the end of that I mean it's easy to spot these guys they come down they're not angry people
[1:02:43.480 --> 1:02:50.480]  they're not confused or just you know ignorant whatever these are people who come down just to cause trouble
[1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:58.480]  you know it was refreshing to see the cops not detain them or beat them up or anything just defuse the situation
[1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:06.480]  and why don't you move across the street stay away from here and it is because the cops in this town know
[1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:12.480]  everybody knows the firefighters know you know you can just see by the looks in people's eyes
[1:03:12.480 --> 1:03:17.480]  that there's no mystery anymore about 9-11
[1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:23.480]  Are you kidding? I mean last year when we got video this we did dig that out and put it on the web
[1:03:23.480 --> 1:03:28.480]  I mean we had like cops giving us thumbs up five feet away captains going hey Alex keep up the good work
[1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:33.480]  black ones white ones and then of course you'd still have I'd say 30% of the cops didn't like us
[1:03:33.480 --> 1:03:37.480]  they'd stick their feet out to trip us and another cop would go what are you doing
[1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:42.480]  and all the firemen wouldn't leave us alone we couldn't get our job done they were saying thank you thank you
[1:03:42.480 --> 1:03:49.480]  but then you'd have people from outside town or some old marine with a horse you know out there showing off and flip us off
[1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:54.480]  but you know they're not even bad people they're weak minded they've fallen to enemy propaganda
[1:03:54.480 --> 1:04:00.480]  exactly they're just ignorant you know people are people these guys come they you know
[1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:06.480]  they experience 9-11 tragedy and they're they're gonna be into the truth too
[1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:12.480]  the truth is the truth it is what it is and as long as people open their eyes and discover it
[1:04:12.480 --> 1:04:20.480]  there's no turning back there's no turning back what's been going on and you can see it on the street
[1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:26.480]  it's just very apparent I can't wait to get these videos up so you can see you know for yourself
[1:04:26.480 --> 1:04:33.480]  exactly what's going on how people are reacting to us this year as contrast to the last previous year that we were there
[1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:40.480]  it's very encouraging and I would just like to say one last thing that you know through the couple of years I've been working with Alex
[1:04:40.480 --> 1:04:46.480]  it's been a total honor to help him make these videos that get out to people and really affect change
[1:04:46.480 --> 1:04:51.480]  and I can see the change that's being affected right now right before my very eyes
[1:04:51.480 --> 1:04:56.480]  it's a total rush and if you could produce your own video as well at home
[1:04:56.480 --> 1:04:58.480]  you'll experience the same world
[1:04:58.480 --> 1:05:00.480]  we'll be right back we'll be right back
[1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:07.480]  a day unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this country
[1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:11.480]  the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy?
[1:05:11.480 --> 1:05:12.480]  bin Laden
[1:05:12.480 --> 1:05:13.480]  this is his MO
[1:05:13.480 --> 1:05:16.480]  we have to look to the Middle East we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[1:05:16.480 --> 1:05:23.480]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[1:05:23.480 --> 1:05:30.480]  some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[1:05:30.480 --> 1:05:34.480]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[1:05:34.480 --> 1:05:41.480]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI the Saudi Arabian connection the Israeli intelligence network
[1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:45.480]  warnings and war games the shadow government and much much more fabled enemies

[1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:38.480]  we are waging war on corruption
[1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:43.480]  few are standing against many and the few are converting the many to the truth
[1:08:43.480 --> 1:08:48.480]  converting them to look at the reality around them and as that happens as more people investigate
[1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:58.480]  our awareness our organic and private individualistic decentralized intelligence network is laying waste to the new world order
[1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:03.480]  we are absolutely decimating them
[1:09:03.480 --> 1:09:09.480]  we are crushing their info war because their info war is made of weak metal
[1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:16.480]  a million of their swords to our swords to our say 500
[1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:21.480]  our 500 swords is greater than their million swords because theirs is like rotten chalk
[1:09:21.480 --> 1:09:25.480]  and ours are the strongest steel the truth
[1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:31.480]  the truth the truth can you handle the truth I think you can
[1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:35.480]  does that mean I have a monopoly on it or you do know
[1:09:35.480 --> 1:09:41.480]  but history those that know history know governments are wicked vicious stinking power tripping criminals
[1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:46.480]  murdering and enslaving and poisoning and every form of debauchery and degeneracy
[1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:50.480]  our society is becoming evil we're all becoming evil
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:54.480]  evil is running rampant deception is running rampant
[1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:57.480]  but that only makes the truth that much stronger
[1:09:57.480 --> 1:10:02.480]  though she'll be so alive when you actually fight evil so alive when you stop being worldly
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:07.480]  does it mean you'll be perfect no but that journey towards liberty and freedom is so purifying
[1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:12.480]  I can't believe the person I was a year ago 5 years ago 10 years ago
[1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:17.480]  and I was more moral than most then I didn't know it though
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:22.480]  I thought everybody wanted the good guys to win and wanted decency and honor and wanted to be informed
[1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:29.480]  and wanted to stand up against corruption I didn't know most people were cowardly and scared and evil themselves
[1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:36.480]  but a lot of that is a mindset a idea you know
[1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:40.480]  being a crowd or at work and said that place had a bad vibe
[1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:45.480]  that place had a great vibe it's like a bad vibe it's a spell people are under
[1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:49.480]  with God's help we're breaking that evil spell ladies and gentlemen
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:55.480]  the truth has gotten right through it like a hot knife through butter
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:11:00.480]  we can do it together they can kill us individually and no doubt they have and they will
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:08.480]  but no in your heart that we can win that good can succeed there can be a dawn after the darkness
[1:11:08.480 --> 1:11:14.480]  it's always coldest at about 5 a.m. you're you know you march to your dear stand climb up in a tree
[1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:21.480]  it's freezing cold the wind picks up but then the dawn comes and it heats up
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:27.480]  even if it's still cold right when the dawn comes there's something about the light that warms your soul
[1:11:27.480 --> 1:11:33.480]  watch little birds hopping around happily in the trees
[1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:36.480]  alright let's go back to Rob Rob I will let you go I know you're in the middle of bedlam there
[1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:42.480]  finishing up what you were saying about being energized being involved in something real
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:50.480]  exactly being involved in this you know it's been such an honor to make these films in the first place
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:57.480]  but coming out here and witnessing the actual change in effect that is caused by the truth
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:12:01.480]  is extremely empowering you know being on the side of the truth and putting out real material
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:08.480]  that actually changes the climate that we live in is extremely empowering it's a rush
[1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:15.480]  every time I come out every time I see people and they recognize the film or they don't you know they're passing it out
[1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:21.480]  and I would just share that feeling with others by saying if you produce get your videos out there
[1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:28.480]  pass out the palm cards do something being on the side of the truth you'll feel a whole new energy
[1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:37.480]  a whole new sort of enlightenment come to you and if you're the guy who secretly listens to Alex
[1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:44.480]  or you hear somebody else who is into 9-11 truth and you agree with him yourself and you're not brave enough yet
[1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:50.480]  to speak out and you just keep it in the room I encourage you to speak out speak out in that room
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:55.480]  because you'll find you'll be surprised that everybody else in that room is probably on your side too
[1:12:55.480 --> 1:12:59.480]  and you're going to be empowered and those who are in denial are going to fall short
[1:12:59.480 --> 1:13:05.480]  and they're going to actually listen to the truth and it is the critical mass point that we're at right now
[1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:11.480]  and encourage everybody that's participating in this critical mass by listening to this and knowing the truth
[1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:16.480]  but not yet speaking out I encourage you at this point to take that first step forward
[1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:22.480]  so you can share in the truth and experience what it really feels like to be alive
[1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:29.480]  you can share in the history and by that we don't care about being part of history
[1:13:29.480 --> 1:13:33.480]  quote later people carrying what we did except that it's an example to others
[1:13:33.480 --> 1:13:37.480]  but it's literally making history it's changing destinies
[1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:41.480]  it is living our destiny to fight evil we're here to be tested
[1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:47.480]  and some of you in the FBI CIA defense intelligence one of the other you know 14 intelligence agencies
[1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:52.480]  I didn't mention some of the private agencies you can covertly wake people up
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:59.480]  you can do little things in your communities you can help get information out
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:05.480]  so some of you don't need to go public but the point is you've seen enough to know that this is true
[1:14:05.480 --> 1:14:10.480]  a lot of you that have been compartmentalized in government who are intelligent but never
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:15.480]  never never saw it from the right angle and I've had so many people special forces generals
[1:14:15.480 --> 1:14:19.480]  colonels you know the head of the army so many have come on this show
[1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:24.480]  former head of the army and said yeah they never saw it till they pulled back and saw the big picture
[1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:28.480]  and then everything made sense before it didn't make sense
[1:14:28.480 --> 1:14:33.480]  there is a mass directive running this and it isn't just our opinion we have those white papers
[1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:38.480]  we have those master blueprints and it is absolute evil
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:42.480]  and so just join this brotherhood this sisterhood of liberty and freedom
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:48.480]  come in for the big win be part of history once you're dead you're past the reach of history
[1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:53.480]  you're past the reach of destiny you've squandered your destiny you've squandered what you could and should
[1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:59.480]  and would have been don't live this life blinded don't live this life living a lie
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:04.480]  when you believe lies it blinds you when you believe lies and commit because your mind
[1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:09.480]  your soul knows the truth and every time you buy into a lie every time you rationalize
[1:15:09.480 --> 1:15:16.480]  every time you make excuses then the eye of your soul never is able to basically see again
[1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:22.480]  and so you blacken your heart you blacken your soul you blacken that third eye
[1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:28.480]  it's the only way to describe it and you wall yourself off you close that window to the soul
[1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:33.480]  just like gouging your own eyeballs out so many of you have have covered your eyes
[1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:37.480]  and the Bible says there's a point when you will lose your eyes your spiritual eyes
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:43.480]  you will lose them if you don't take the blinders off okay when you first take the blinders off
[1:15:43.480 --> 1:15:47.480]  you're not going to really see clearly it's going to be blurred it's going to be scary
[1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:51.480]  but more and more sight will come you will be able to research more to know more
[1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:57.480]  and you will become edified and you will grow and you will grow into something that you were meant to be by your creator
[1:15:57.480 --> 1:16:02.480]  all right close it out watch close it out to Jacobson then I want to get the Watson's on later
[1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:03.480]  is what I meant to say go ahead
[1:16:03.480 --> 1:16:04.480]  there it is
[1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:08.480]  that's it the truth will set you free and that means living the truth
[1:16:08.480 --> 1:16:13.480]  I mean here's to the FBI guys who follow orders but they know they're doing something wrong
[1:16:13.480 --> 1:16:18.480]  they're not really comfortable imagine what it would feel like if instead of just blindly following orders
[1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:23.480]  to maintain your job you actually took action and changed the whole world that you live in
[1:16:23.480 --> 1:16:30.480]  you suddenly feel like you count you're somebody you're a part of this world your life has meaning
[1:16:30.480 --> 1:16:35.480]  instead of just some guy that follows orders to make the paycheck
[1:16:35.480 --> 1:16:39.480]  and you know that is the difference between living the lie and living in the truth
[1:16:39.480 --> 1:16:44.480]  and it will set you free and you do feel for the first time if you've never experienced it before
[1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:49.480]  you feel for the first time like you're living life and you're in control of your destiny
[1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:55.480]  and you are a member of this planet and that's just you know that's basically absolutely like to leave it
[1:16:55.480 --> 1:16:59.480]  all right thanks for having me on Alex I'll see you when I get back
[1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:03.480]  you bet well if anything develops give us a report I want to get a report from you Sunday
[1:17:03.480 --> 1:17:06.480]  because you're also going to be going to DC there's some work there
[1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:10.480]  there goes Rob Jacobson great video editor and camera guy
[1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:17.480]  again Ralph Nader scheduled to be popping in later in this hour
[1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:23.480]  William Engel the incredible economist researcher
[1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:29.480]  journalist academic to get into full spectrum dominance and GMO foods
[1:17:29.480 --> 1:17:35.480]  we're doing a multi-part series with him and then Bob Chapman popping in with the Freddie Mac
[1:17:35.480 --> 1:17:40.480]  Fannie Mae Freddie Mac situation
[1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:45.480]  so that is coming up and I do want to open the phones up
[1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:51.480]  about 9-11 about this movement false flag terror being exposed other things that are happening
[1:17:51.480 --> 1:17:59.480]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231
[1:17:59.480 --> 1:18:04.480]  I'd like to hear briefly from all of you about what you're doing but I will be brief with each caller
[1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:06.480]  and everybody on please don't try
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:09.480]  Nader calls for new 9-11 investigation
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:12.480]  independent presidential candidate says he supports 9-11 truth movement
[1:18:12.480 --> 1:18:15.480]  Senate seek the truth not fake political unity
[1:18:15.480 --> 1:18:18.480]  calls for a national independent investigation of 9-11
[1:18:18.480 --> 1:18:22.480]  Sarkozy's top comic Francis top comic
[1:18:22.480 --> 1:18:26.480]  headlines Sarkozy's comic friend says sorry for 9-11 comments
[1:18:26.480 --> 1:18:30.480]  they always wanted to see every time you read those headlines
[1:18:30.480 --> 1:18:34.480]  they put out false headlines saying Charlie Sheen recrants on inside job
[1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:37.480]  Charlie had to put an email out on my website saying it's not true it's made up
[1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:39.480]  he didn't say that
[1:18:39.480 --> 1:18:43.480]  and then you read down here it says he will not
[1:18:43.480 --> 1:18:47.480]  Mr. Bigrad said he would not
[1:18:47.480 --> 1:18:50.480]  Jean-Marie Bigrad said he will not recant
[1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:55.480]  he thinks it's an inside job but he won't say it in public anymore because it upsets Sarkozy
[1:18:55.480 --> 1:18:59.480]  Francis' favorite stand-up comedian has been forced to apologize for claiming
[1:18:59.480 --> 1:19:02.480]  the 9-11 was a terrorist attack on the US 7 years ago
[1:19:02.480 --> 1:19:04.480]  tomorrow
[1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:08.480]  were an enormous lie orchestrated by the American government
[1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:12.480]  said it caused consternation in France because the comedian who specializes
[1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:17.480]  in humor is a close friend of President Nicholas Sarkozy and travels with him
[1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:19.480]  yeah
[1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:23.480]  so there you go
[1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:29.480]  continuing Woodward Bin Laden capture could be October surprise remember I had that big former CIA
[1:19:29.480 --> 1:19:32.480]  CFR co-chairman on
[1:19:32.480 --> 1:19:35.480]  he thought I was Alex Jones the MPR reporter
[1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:39.480]  well a lot of them we don't even lie and tell them we're that person they just think we aren't come on
[1:19:39.480 --> 1:19:43.480]  and he came on right up for 9-11 and was saying yeah the government's
[1:19:43.480 --> 1:19:46.480]  got Bin Laden frozen he died of kidney failure

[1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:34.480]  and interest with the stroke of a pen Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business
[1:20:34.480 --> 1:20:38.480]  the November assassination quieted the production of the new currency however
[1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:43.480]  the executive order still stands unrepealed Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document

[1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:45.480]  I can feel their strength
[1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:47.480]  tells me that he's coming
[1:24:47.480 --> 1:24:48.480]  but the clouds are coming
[1:24:48.480 --> 1:24:50.480]  in my bones
[1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:51.480]  he ain't my friend
[1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:54.480]  in my gut
[1:24:54.480 --> 1:24:56.480]  and I'll rise again
[1:24:56.480 --> 1:25:00.480]  deep in my soul

[1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:08.480]  it's a long road
[1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:12.480]  filled with hardship and pain
[1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:16.480]  but I know in my gut
[1:25:16.480 --> 1:25:17.480]  but good
[1:25:17.480 --> 1:25:22.480]  will overtake and defeat the evil
[1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:25.480]  we will defeat the new world order
[1:25:25.480 --> 1:25:27.480]  it was destined to fall
[1:25:27.480 --> 1:25:29.480]  from the foundations of the earth
[1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:33.480]  they'll never win
[1:25:33.480 --> 1:25:35.480]  I'll rise again
[1:25:35.480 --> 1:25:38.480]  for all their raw power
[1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:40.480]  for all their war machines
[1:25:40.480 --> 1:25:42.480]  their juggernauts
[1:25:42.480 --> 1:25:45.480]  their war mocks
[1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:49.480]  their blasphemous tools of terror
[1:25:49.480 --> 1:25:51.480]  they are destined to fail and fall
[1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:56.480]  they are blind to what it is to be truly alive
[1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:05.480]  they will fall
[1:26:05.480 --> 1:26:10.480]  motto in Michigan you're on the air
[1:26:10.480 --> 1:26:12.480]  hey Alec thanks for taking my call
[1:26:12.480 --> 1:26:15.480]  on a tragic anniversary
[1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:17.480]  I want to tell you briefly
[1:26:17.480 --> 1:26:19.480]  what I'm doing trying to get the word out
[1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:21.480]  of your films and Jason's films
[1:26:21.480 --> 1:26:24.480]  they're on the Ann Arbor news online
[1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:26.480]  they have a town talk form
[1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:29.480]  it's mlivealloneword.com
[1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:32.480]  I like all the truthers that have some time
[1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:34.480]  to go there get a username
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:36.480]  because as usual when I post something on there
[1:26:36.480 --> 1:26:38.480]  you get the usual trolls
[1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:40.480]  or the paid people that come in there
[1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:42.480]  insults and try to derail the talk
[1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:44.480]  I need people to go in there
[1:26:44.480 --> 1:26:47.480]  and put in threads that say either they agree
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:49.480]  or other information
[1:26:49.480 --> 1:26:51.480]  and don't let it just be me
[1:26:51.480 --> 1:26:53.480]  mlive.com slash Ann Arbor
[1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:56.480]  and one other thing I thought was a contradiction
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:26:58.480]  and obviously I support you but I want to point out
[1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:01.480]  you have the thing on your website about Shiva
[1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:03.480]  the goddess or whatever destroyer
[1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:05.480]  and you were just talking about spiritual
[1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:07.480]  I being a third eye
[1:27:07.480 --> 1:27:09.480]  I think that's a bit of a contradiction
[1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:11.480]  for my Christian brother Alec
[1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:13.480]  so maybe you want to sort of clarify that
[1:27:13.480 --> 1:27:15.480]  I appreciate your call
[1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:17.480]  I mean people in the Hindu
[1:27:17.480 --> 1:27:20.480]  or the Buddhist thing can talk specifically about that
[1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:22.480]  okay if you don't know
[1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:25.480]  that you have spiritual sight
[1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:27.480]  see this is how all this works
[1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:31.480]  symbols are expropriated by the New World Order
[1:27:31.480 --> 1:27:34.480]  ideas are expropriated by that
[1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:38.480]  okay and so what I'm saying is as you
[1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:41.480]  your spiritual sight
[1:27:41.480 --> 1:27:43.480]  or your sixth sense
[1:27:43.480 --> 1:27:45.480]  or whatever you want to call it
[1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:47.480]  are blinded when they are dulled
[1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:49.480]  when you lie to yourself
[1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:51.480]  when you lie to the facts
[1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:53.480]  when you disregard them
[1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:55.480]  you become spiritually blind is what I'm saying
[1:27:55.480 --> 1:27:57.480]  okay
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:01.480]  and they got Shiva the god of death
[1:28:01.480 --> 1:28:03.480]  you could say it was Kali but Shiva is also death
[1:28:03.480 --> 1:28:06.480]  shitting over the Hadron heavy collider
[1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:09.480]  which none of us said it was going to blow the earth up when they turned it on
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:12.480]  we said as they speeded up over the next five years
[1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:14.480]  and as they crossed those streams
[1:28:14.480 --> 1:28:16.480]  at thousands of times whatever's been done
[1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:18.480]  they admit the builders of it
[1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:20.480]  have done interviews saying
[1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:22.480]  it could create a particle
[1:28:22.480 --> 1:28:24.480]  that sinks to the center of the earth
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:26.480]  and then causes the earth to implode
[1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:28.480]  or creates a strange or a black hole
[1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:30.480]  they admit it's going to make little black holes
[1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:32.480]  they've already made artificial suns
[1:28:32.480 --> 1:28:34.480]  and black holes and laboratories for at least a decade
[1:28:34.480 --> 1:28:36.480]  every time I say that
[1:28:36.480 --> 1:28:38.480]  I get emails going you're crazy
[1:28:38.480 --> 1:28:41.480]  Google University constructs black hole
[1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:43.480]  in Tokyo
[1:28:43.480 --> 1:28:45.480]  at MIT in Massachusetts
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:47.480]  in Los Alamos
[1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:50.480]  I mean they were making artificial suns 25 years ago
[1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:53.480]  they were making new artificial elements
[1:28:53.480 --> 1:28:55.480]  40 years ago
[1:28:55.480 --> 1:28:57.480]  they had cyclotrons
[1:28:57.480 --> 1:28:59.480]  and they had other names for them before that
[1:28:59.480 --> 1:29:01.480]  last night
[1:29:01.480 --> 1:29:03.480]  I told you my wife bought these
[1:29:05.480 --> 1:29:09.480]  pitcher color encyclopedias off eBay
[1:29:09.480 --> 1:29:11.480]  they were at some family member's house
[1:29:11.480 --> 1:29:13.480]  they had some old ones and my kids were loving them
[1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:15.480]  so we read those to them
[1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:17.480]  we just got them like a week ago
[1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:19.480]  I just opened one up last night
[1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:21.480]  it was laying by the bed
[1:29:21.480 --> 1:29:23.480]  and it's got the old name from the 50's for a cyclotron
[1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:25.480]  I forget what they called it
[1:29:25.480 --> 1:29:27.480]  but they were colliding uranium in it
[1:29:27.480 --> 1:29:29.480]  I mean just firing a uranium bullet
[1:29:29.480 --> 1:29:31.480]  into plutonium
[1:29:31.480 --> 1:29:33.480]  causes an a-bomb
[1:29:33.480 --> 1:29:35.480]  I mean they're dealing with that type of stuff
[1:29:35.480 --> 1:29:37.480]  so we say there's a danger
[1:29:37.480 --> 1:29:39.480]  shut up there's no danger
[1:29:39.480 --> 1:29:41.480]  see the earth wasn't destroyed yesterday
[1:29:41.480 --> 1:29:43.480]  but then these lunatics
[1:29:43.480 --> 1:29:45.480]  put Shiva the god of death above it
[1:29:45.480 --> 1:29:47.480]  you see they know what they're doing
[1:29:47.480 --> 1:29:49.480]  they got a death wish
[1:29:49.480 --> 1:29:51.480]  they're out of control
[1:29:51.480 --> 1:29:53.480]  we're on the march
[1:29:53.480 --> 1:29:55.480]  the empires on the run
[1:29:55.480 --> 1:29:57.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:30:01.480 --> 1:30:03.480]  a day unlike any other in the long course of American history

[1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:03.480]  domestic United States of terror
[1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:05.480]  where everybody seems to be
[1:35:05.480 --> 1:35:07.480]  at risk of being taken away
[1:35:07.480 --> 1:35:09.480]  without judge or
[1:35:09.480 --> 1:35:11.480]  jury and

[1:35:25.480 --> 1:35:27.480]  you got a couple of
[1:35:27.480 --> 1:35:29.480]  no-fingers here and there
[1:35:29.480 --> 1:35:31.480]  but mostly the vast majority
[1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:33.480]  is supporting you
[1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:35.480]  I'm hearing the honks so you're over
[1:35:35.480 --> 1:35:37.480]  and overpass where in California Joe

[1:35:39.480 --> 1:35:41.480]  which is making a lot of news at the trees
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:43.480]  but reminding the people
[1:35:43.480 --> 1:35:45.480]  that this is a real peace movement

[1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:49.480]  absolutely
[1:35:49.480 --> 1:35:51.480]  so I just wanted to keep it short
[1:35:51.480 --> 1:35:53.480]  but thank you again
[1:35:53.480 --> 1:35:55.480]  and remind everybody
[1:35:55.480 --> 1:35:57.480]  to take action against the new
[1:35:57.480 --> 1:35:59.480]  world order through We Are Change
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:01.480]  take action on the 11th of every month
[1:36:01.480 --> 1:36:03.480]  and listen to the Alex Jones show
[1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:05.480]  are you part of an organization you want to plug a local
[1:36:05.480 --> 1:36:07.480]  website for folks to coordinate with
[1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:09.480]  we do TruthAction.org
[1:36:09.480 --> 1:36:11.480]  we're going to change San Francisco
[1:36:11.480 --> 1:36:13.480]  we've got a meet up page that does well
[1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:15.480]  so it's not really easy to plug that
[1:36:15.480 --> 1:36:17.480]  but just check out meetup.com
[1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:19.480]  go to the San Francisco transaction group
[1:36:19.480 --> 1:36:21.480]  I've got my man Manny right here
[1:36:21.480 --> 1:36:23.480]  I want to say hi real quick
[1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:25.480]  I'm a longtime listener man
[1:36:25.480 --> 1:36:27.480]  I just wanted to put this out over the air

[1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:31.480]  we also encourage
[1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:33.480]  that any other We Are Change groups
[1:36:33.480 --> 1:36:35.480]  TruthAction.org members
[1:36:35.480 --> 1:36:37.480]  do the same
[1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:39.480]  we're calling for a massive massive
[1:36:39.480 --> 1:36:41.480]  demonstration everywhere
[1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:43.480]  we need as many people on the highways as possible
[1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:45.480]  this is a maximum exposure
[1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:47.480]  and I think that will do it
[1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:49.480]  absolutely and it ends up getting a local TV
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:51.480]  local newspapers once you're out there
[1:36:51.480 --> 1:36:53.480]  call the local paper
[1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:55.480]  say hey you know 9-11 Truths out here on the highway
[1:36:55.480 --> 1:36:57.480]  and then you reach thousands more
[1:36:57.480 --> 1:36:59.480]  through that total attack
[1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:01.480]  on the enemy operation good job Manny
[1:37:01.480 --> 1:37:03.480]  good to hear from you

[1:37:11.480 --> 1:37:13.480]  thanks for taking my call
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:15.480]  I love your show
[1:37:15.480 --> 1:37:17.480]  I just wanted to let you know
[1:37:17.480 --> 1:37:19.480]  I was driving down 95 south
[1:37:19.480 --> 1:37:21.480]  towards Orlando Florida
[1:37:21.480 --> 1:37:23.480]  and I saw
[1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:25.480]  five homeland security vans
[1:37:25.480 --> 1:37:27.480]  driving down
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:29.480]  oh yeah they're everywhere federal police
[1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:31.480]  they were going about
[1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:33.480]  100 miles per hour
[1:37:33.480 --> 1:37:35.480]  they scared me a little bit
[1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:37.480]  I hope they don't have explosives like the vans with 9-11
[1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:39.480]  to blow up some buildings
[1:37:39.480 --> 1:37:41.480]  so they can then save us
[1:37:41.480 --> 1:37:43.480]  see that's their business folks
[1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:45.480]  is terror so they can exist
[1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:47.480]  well just wanted to inform you Alex
[1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:49.480]  thank you very much
[1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:51.480]  thank you I appreciate that call
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:53.480]  I'm a lot of bad things have happened
[1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:55.480]  we've lost a lot of freedoms but the good news is
[1:37:55.480 --> 1:37:57.480]  humanity is responding
[1:37:57.480 --> 1:37:59.480]  humanity is saying no
[1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:01.480]  and the globalists have gone from having 50% approval
[1:38:01.480 --> 1:38:03.480]  down to about 9
[1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:05.480]  oh you destroyed yourselves when you killed those
[1:38:05.480 --> 1:38:07.480]  3,000 people
[1:38:07.480 --> 1:38:09.480]  you went too far
[1:38:09.480 --> 1:38:11.480]  like tyrants always do
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:13.480]  Roman in California
[1:38:13.480 --> 1:38:15.480]  you're on the air
[1:38:15.480 --> 1:38:17.480]  good morning Alex
[1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:19.480]  I called in on this patriot day
[1:38:19.480 --> 1:38:21.480]  to
[1:38:21.480 --> 1:38:23.480]  illustrate the fact that
[1:38:23.480 --> 1:38:25.480]  the clandestine free masonic
[1:38:25.480 --> 1:38:27.480]  is actually the oldest
[1:38:27.480 --> 1:38:29.480]  terrorist network in the world
[1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:31.480]  can you speak to that
[1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:33.480]  and real quick I'd just like to
[1:38:33.480 --> 1:38:35.480]  tell everyone to buy your books
[1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:37.480]  and movies because
[1:38:37.480 --> 1:38:39.480]  without that you can't do this show
[1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:41.480]  well I appreciate your call
[1:38:43.480 --> 1:38:45.480]  I was talking to a mason just the other day
[1:38:45.480 --> 1:38:47.480]  I saw his mason ring
[1:38:47.480 --> 1:38:49.480]  and he's a low level mason
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:51.480]  he doesn't know that it's a cultic at the top
[1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:53.480]  but I was
[1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:55.480]  directing him in a
[1:38:55.480 --> 1:38:57.480]  way that he could discover more
[1:38:57.480 --> 1:38:59.480]  about that
[1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:01.480]  most masons are
[1:39:01.480 --> 1:39:03.480]  they join to be fraternal, they join it to help people
[1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:05.480]  they join it because they're told the founding fathers
[1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:07.480]  and the founders of Texas and this and that
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:09.480]  were part of it
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:11.480]  but that's how they find out at the higher levels
[1:39:11.480 --> 1:39:13.480]  they didn't have you write essays on yourself and what you believe
[1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:15.480]  if you're a moral person you get put in one group
[1:39:15.480 --> 1:39:17.480]  working for them and if you're immoral
[1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:19.480]  they can compartmentalize you in the bad side
[1:39:19.480 --> 1:39:21.480]  and then they tell you at the higher levels
[1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:23.480]  oh we're the good and the bad
[1:39:23.480 --> 1:39:25.480]  you know we're the yin yang
[1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:27.480]  we're not a system
[1:39:27.480 --> 1:39:29.480]  but then see a mason
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:31.480]  will say oh terrorist organization
[1:39:31.480 --> 1:39:33.480]  you mean like the founding fathers fighting British tyranny
[1:39:33.480 --> 1:39:35.480]  well but they don't want you to know
[1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:37.480]  that George Washington then wrote about how
[1:39:37.480 --> 1:39:39.480]  the masonic organizations were being taken over
[1:39:39.480 --> 1:39:41.480]  later
[1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:43.480]  um
[1:39:43.480 --> 1:39:45.480]  and George Washington wrote about that
[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:47.480]  so anything secret of anything powerful
[1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:49.480]  is going to have evil people trying to get control of it
[1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:51.480]  and it predates Christianity
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:53.480]  so it's going to have the occult in it
[1:39:53.480 --> 1:39:55.480]  and it's esoteric
[1:39:55.480 --> 1:39:57.480]  and anything quote esoteric means hidden
[1:39:57.480 --> 1:39:59.480]  and you're always going to find
[1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:01.480]  the occult there the occult just means
[1:40:01.480 --> 1:40:03.480]  hidden
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:05.480]  and what's hidden
[1:40:05.480 --> 1:40:07.480]  what would get you burned at the stake being anything but Christian
[1:40:07.480 --> 1:40:09.480]  and so that's what you're going to find there
[1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:13.480]  the secular or not
[1:40:13.480 --> 1:40:15.480]  of Christ
[1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:17.480]  you are going to find there
[1:40:17.480 --> 1:40:19.480]  so that's just the facts and I'm not
[1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:21.480]  judging people or hating people
[1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:23.480]  I'm on some high horse folks I'm not perfect
[1:40:23.480 --> 1:40:25.480]  I am a Christian and I don't mean the establishment
[1:40:25.480 --> 1:40:27.480]  mainline Christian I am a Christian
[1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:29.480]  and uh you know that's the end of it
[1:40:29.480 --> 1:40:31.480]  but it's not a religious show
[1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:35.480]  we intellectually
[1:40:35.480 --> 1:40:37.480]  cover what the elites of the world are into
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:41.480]  we intellectually cover the fact that Tony Blair
[1:40:41.480 --> 1:40:43.480]  every decision is directed by some spirit guy
[1:40:43.480 --> 1:40:45.480]  or that Ronald Reagan's every decision
[1:40:45.480 --> 1:40:47.480]  was directed by two different astrologers
[1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:49.480]  well that's only the tip of the iceberg
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:51.480]  the first coat of paint
[1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:53.480]  the first layer of the onion
[1:40:53.480 --> 1:40:55.480]  so on and so forth
[1:40:55.480 --> 1:40:57.480]  we're scheduled right around now to have Ralph
[1:40:57.480 --> 1:40:59.480]  Nader call in
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:01.480]  he's very busy today but
[1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:03.480]  he wanted to be able to chime in about his campaign
[1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:05.480]  and about
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:07.480]  different congressmen and people that are
[1:41:07.480 --> 1:41:09.480]  discussing the fact that Marshall Lobb
[1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:11.480]  is being geared up for
[1:41:11.480 --> 1:41:13.480]  it doesn't matter if George Bush leaves office folks
[1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:15.480]  people are going to go back to sleep probably
[1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:17.480]  to a great extent some of them because they still think
[1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:19.480]  oh the McCain gets in
[1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:21.480]  or Barack Obama everything stops no
[1:41:21.480 --> 1:41:23.480]  they have sworn allegiance they are bought
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:25.480]  and paid for years ago
[1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:27.480]  before they were put into positions of power
[1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:29.480]  by the establishment that they are for this
[1:41:29.480 --> 1:41:31.480]  that they support it
[1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:33.480]  but I saw a video last night
[1:41:33.480 --> 1:41:35.480]  it was up on info wars.com
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:37.480]  of Ralph Nader you know at a speech
[1:41:37.480 --> 1:41:39.480]  about this particular congressman
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:41.480]  they were saying why don't you impeach Bush
[1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:43.480]  because he'll declare Marshall Lobb
[1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:45.480]  he'll launch a distractionary war against Iran
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:47.480]  so Nader is talking about the real issues
[1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:49.480]  continuity of government
[1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:51.480]  stage sponsored terror
[1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:53.480]  false flag terror
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:55.480]  I mean he's really got to be commended
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:41:57.480]  he has come a long way
[1:41:57.480 --> 1:41:59.480]  and I'm not here sitting in judgment
[1:41:59.480 --> 1:42:01.480]  but I mean he's got more hardcore
[1:42:01.480 --> 1:42:03.480]  but more and more facts
[1:42:03.480 --> 1:42:05.480]  have come out demonstrating that
[1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:09.480]  more and more evidence
[1:42:11.480 --> 1:42:13.480]  has come out
[1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:15.480]  John he's got so many people in his press
[1:42:15.480 --> 1:42:17.480]  core I know first he was going to be on it
[1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:19.480]  45 after then 40 after
[1:42:19.480 --> 1:42:21.480]  have you called him yourself
[1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:23.480]  they got John Holt getting him good
[1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:25.480]  it's good
[1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:27.480]  okay
[1:42:27.480 --> 1:42:29.480]  the problem is he stacks up media
[1:42:29.480 --> 1:42:31.480]  these media events and then it goes over
[1:42:31.480 --> 1:42:33.480]  and then we're late getting him on
[1:42:33.480 --> 1:42:35.480]  and then he's late for another interview
[1:42:35.480 --> 1:42:37.480]  and so on and so forth but
[1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:39.480]  we should be talking around Nader
[1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:43.480]  momentarily
[1:42:43.480 --> 1:42:45.480]  Bob Woodward bin Laden capture
[1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:47.480]  could be October surprise we're getting into that
[1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:49.480]  story here
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:51.480]  out of Reuters no
[1:42:51.480 --> 1:42:53.480]  consensus on who was
[1:42:53.480 --> 1:42:55.480]  behind September 11th
[1:42:55.480 --> 1:42:57.480]  global poll
[1:42:57.480 --> 1:42:59.480]  and then you learn that a majority of people
[1:42:59.480 --> 1:43:01.480]  worldwide don't believe the official story
[1:43:01.480 --> 1:43:03.480]  out of that global poll
[1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:05.480]  911 truth film to be broadcast on
[1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:07.480]  prime time Russian TV
[1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:09.480]  shows the film decent film
[1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:11.480]  particularly like the distributor of it
[1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:13.480]  I'll tell you that right now I've had some dealings
[1:43:13.480 --> 1:43:15.480]  skeptics to make 911 events
[1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:19.480]  daily text in the days
[1:43:19.480 --> 1:43:21.480]  of UT student newspaper but it's big
[1:43:21.480 --> 1:43:23.480]  it's on newsstands free all over
[1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:25.480]  Austin and it's read by
[1:43:25.480 --> 1:43:27.480]  tens of thousands of UT students and interviewed
[1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:29.480]  myself and folks at brave new books
[1:43:29.480 --> 1:43:31.480]  and it's just somewhat of a fair article
[1:43:31.480 --> 1:43:33.480]  they kind of stuck to the few things
[1:43:33.480 --> 1:43:35.480]  I said that were nebulous
[1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:37.480]  but it's not a hit piece so
[1:43:37.480 --> 1:43:39.480]  and to make it past the editor I guess
[1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:41.480]  so a lot of news
[1:43:41.480 --> 1:43:43.480]  dealing with that
[1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:45.480]  we are now joined by
[1:43:45.480 --> 1:43:47.480]  presidential candidate
[1:43:47.480 --> 1:43:49.480]  Ralph Nader running
[1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:51.480]  as an independent and we've only
[1:43:51.480 --> 1:43:53.480]  got him till the end of the hour
[1:43:53.480 --> 1:43:55.480]  correct John
[1:43:57.480 --> 1:43:59.480]  so we've only got about seven minutes for the
[1:43:59.480 --> 1:44:01.480]  before he goes to the Washington Post
[1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:03.480]  Ralph Nader thanks for
[1:44:03.480 --> 1:44:05.480]  letting us cram you in
[1:44:05.480 --> 1:44:07.480]  the Washington Post is waiting two points
[1:44:07.480 --> 1:44:09.480]  you've now spoken out about the congressman
[1:44:09.480 --> 1:44:11.480]  on the record saying if they were to impeach
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:13.480]  George Bush he would launch some type of
[1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:15.480]  attack on Iran and then declare martial law
[1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:17.480]  we know that's in PDD-51
[1:44:17.480 --> 1:44:19.480]  we know that's in the John Warner Defense
[1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:21.480]  Authorization Act A
[1:44:21.480 --> 1:44:23.480]  and then B I'd like you to speak to
[1:44:23.480 --> 1:44:25.480]  Bush wanting, Cheney wanting
[1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:27.480]  to stage attacks according to Cy Hurch
[1:44:27.480 --> 1:44:29.480]  and New Yorker magazine
[1:44:29.480 --> 1:44:31.480]  against our own ships
[1:44:31.480 --> 1:44:33.480]  in the Strait of Hormuz to start a war
[1:44:33.480 --> 1:44:35.480]  and you're now calling for a new
[1:44:35.480 --> 1:44:37.480]  9-11 investigation please answer
[1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:39.480]  those two questions sir first of all
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:41.480]  clarification on Iran
[1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:43.480]  I didn't say I believed that would be the case
[1:44:43.480 --> 1:44:45.480]  I said that
[1:44:45.480 --> 1:44:47.480]  it's important for people to be
[1:44:47.480 --> 1:44:49.480]  wary of an October surprise
[1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:51.480]  to fact the election
[1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:53.480]  by Bush and Cheney October
[1:44:53.480 --> 1:44:55.480]  surprise could be directed toward Iran
[1:44:55.480 --> 1:44:57.480]  well no I mean I'm saying
[1:44:57.480 --> 1:44:59.480]  you were saying you thought that was an interesting article
[1:44:59.480 --> 1:45:01.480]  you bumped into Carl Rove
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:03.480]  when you were at the Democratic National Convention
[1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:05.480]  Alex
[1:45:05.480 --> 1:45:07.480]  I bumped into Carl Rove
[1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:09.480]  who was waiting in front of me to be interviewed
[1:45:09.480 --> 1:45:11.480]  at Fox News
[1:45:11.480 --> 1:45:13.480]  and I asked him about this
[1:45:13.480 --> 1:45:15.480]  he said absolutely not I said give me reasons
[1:45:15.480 --> 1:45:17.480]  why there's got to be an attack on Iran
[1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:19.480]  he said one majority
[1:45:19.480 --> 1:45:21.480]  people are against the Iranian regime
[1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:23.480]  and their favorite program is
[1:45:23.480 --> 1:45:25.480]  a cable show out of LA and California
[1:45:25.480 --> 1:45:27.480]  by Iranian Americans
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:29.480]  and second, that it would completely
[1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:31.480]  devastate our feelers
[1:45:31.480 --> 1:45:33.480]  and diplomatic efforts in that direction
[1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:35.480]  so he was very adamant
[1:45:35.480 --> 1:45:37.480]  you can take that with a grain of salt
[1:45:37.480 --> 1:45:39.480]  but I'm just telling you that's what he said
[1:45:39.480 --> 1:45:41.480]  on the 9-11 investigation
[1:45:41.480 --> 1:45:43.480]  I'm always asked about that
[1:45:43.480 --> 1:45:45.480]  and what I say
[1:45:45.480 --> 1:45:47.480]  and what I've just said today
[1:45:47.480 --> 1:45:49.480]  in a press release going out
[1:45:49.480 --> 1:45:51.480]  is that this is a woefully
[1:45:51.480 --> 1:45:53.480]  inadequate and incomplete
[1:45:53.480 --> 1:45:55.480]  investigation
[1:45:55.480 --> 1:45:57.480]  it's really underfunded to begin with
[1:45:57.480 --> 1:45:59.480]  Bush and Cheney even wanted
[1:45:59.480 --> 1:46:01.480]  an independent investigation
[1:46:01.480 --> 1:46:03.480]  it wasn't for the bereaved family members
[1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:05.480]  of the attack
[1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:07.480]  who pressed and demanded it
[1:46:07.480 --> 1:46:09.480]  we wouldn't even had it
[1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:11.480]  and then there was a question about its independence
[1:46:11.480 --> 1:46:13.480]  remember they wanted Henry Kissinger to head it
[1:46:13.480 --> 1:46:15.480]  and he had to drop out because he had a conflict of interest
[1:46:15.480 --> 1:46:17.480]  with his corporate clients
[1:46:17.480 --> 1:46:19.480]  and third, they started out
[1:46:19.480 --> 1:46:21.480]  saying they weren't going to name names
[1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:23.480]  or hold anybody responsible
[1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:25.480]  for the investigation
[1:46:25.480 --> 1:46:27.480]  processes that
[1:46:27.480 --> 1:46:29.480]  and that is ridiculous
[1:46:29.480 --> 1:46:31.480]  finally, there are just a lot of questions
[1:46:31.480 --> 1:46:33.480]  that have been raised
[1:46:33.480 --> 1:46:35.480]  some of them appear to be sound
[1:46:35.480 --> 1:46:37.480]  some of them appear to be plausible
[1:46:37.480 --> 1:46:39.480]  some of them appear to be outlandish
[1:46:39.480 --> 1:46:41.480]  and more and more of the American people
[1:46:41.480 --> 1:46:43.480]  are generating skepticism
[1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:45.480]  about what happened before
[1:46:45.480 --> 1:46:47.480]  during and after the 9-11 attack
[1:46:47.480 --> 1:46:49.480]  so I think we need
[1:46:49.480 --> 1:46:51.480]  another independent
[1:46:51.480 --> 1:46:53.480]  friend of the New York City
[1:46:53.480 --> 1:46:55.480]  which is underway
[1:46:55.480 --> 1:46:57.480]  or by some other independent
[1:46:57.480 --> 1:46:59.480]  authoritative force that can have
[1:46:59.480 --> 1:47:01.480]  subpoena power and
[1:47:01.480 --> 1:47:03.480]  inadequate funding
[1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:05.480]  the interesting thing about this
[1:47:05.480 --> 1:47:07.480]  is what I've been pressing for
[1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:09.480]  I want a four hour debate
[1:47:09.480 --> 1:47:11.480]  at the National Press Club
[1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:13.480]  Alex
[1:47:13.480 --> 1:47:15.480]  with an intermission
[1:47:15.480 --> 1:47:17.480]  between a leading proponent
[1:47:17.480 --> 1:47:19.480]  supporting the 9-11 investigation
[1:47:19.480 --> 1:47:21.480]  and report
[1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:23.480]  and a leading opponent
[1:47:23.480 --> 1:47:25.480]  with all the press there
[1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:27.480]  because it's like ships passing in the night
[1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:29.480]  you've got the proponents
[1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:31.480]  coming forth
[1:47:31.480 --> 1:47:33.480]  you've got the critics coming forth
[1:47:33.480 --> 1:47:35.480]  and they shoot bollies at each other
[1:47:35.480 --> 1:47:37.480]  that's something that can be done
[1:47:37.480 --> 1:47:39.480]  and it can be done fast
[1:47:39.480 --> 1:47:41.480]  before the election
[1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:43.480]  and it would be
[1:47:43.480 --> 1:47:45.480]  sensational because
[1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:47.480]  as someone who's skilled in polemics
[1:47:47.480 --> 1:47:49.480]  if A makes a charge
[1:47:49.480 --> 1:47:51.480]  against B's position
[1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:53.480]  and B makes a charge against A's position
[1:47:53.480 --> 1:47:55.480]  and then they go at it
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:57.480]  on one issue after another
[1:47:57.480 --> 1:47:59.480]  five, six exchanges
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:01.480]  someone's going to be left on the floor after that
[1:48:01.480 --> 1:48:03.480]  and we know who that's going to be
[1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:05.480]  well in closing we've only got about two minutes left for you
[1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:07.480]  in closing to be specific about my statement
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:09.480]  what you said in Denver
[1:48:09.480 --> 1:48:11.480]  you're saying there has been false flag
[1:48:11.480 --> 1:48:13.480]  or provocations or Gulf of Tonkin
[1:48:13.480 --> 1:48:15.480]  events before and you were saying
[1:48:15.480 --> 1:48:17.480]  when I heard story needed to be looked at
[1:48:17.480 --> 1:48:19.480]  I'm not saying you were saying
[1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:21.480]  it was going to happen but
[1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:23.480]  is government sponsored terror
[1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:25.480]  throughout history with other governments
[1:48:25.480 --> 1:48:27.480]  our government is that real
[1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:29.480]  of course I mean the greatest civilian casualties
[1:48:29.480 --> 1:48:31.480]  whether in World War II
[1:48:31.480 --> 1:48:33.480]  World War I and all the way to today
[1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:35.480]  are state sponsored
[1:48:35.480 --> 1:48:37.480]  I mean you know
[1:48:37.480 --> 1:48:39.480]  a million civilians in Iraq have lost their lives
[1:48:39.480 --> 1:48:41.480]  but I mean government states
[1:48:41.480 --> 1:48:43.480]  the more Palestinian civilians have lost their lives
[1:48:43.480 --> 1:48:45.480]  it is really
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:47.480]  but what I'm saying is governments do stage events
[1:48:47.480 --> 1:48:49.480]  and blame it on their enemies
[1:48:49.480 --> 1:48:51.480]  well sure I mean look at a Tonkin Gulf resolution
[1:48:51.480 --> 1:48:53.480]  right by Lyndon Johnson during
[1:48:53.480 --> 1:48:55.480]  the war and
[1:48:55.480 --> 1:48:57.480]  you know I mean yeah provocations
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:48:59.480]  in order to enter into
[1:48:59.480 --> 1:49:01.480]  hostilities
[1:49:01.480 --> 1:49:03.480]  I mean we did it in 1898
[1:49:03.480 --> 1:49:05.480]  you know with Cuba and
[1:49:05.480 --> 1:49:07.480]  it's
[1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:09.480]  something that should
[1:49:09.480 --> 1:49:11.480]  be inquired into I think most Americans want that
[1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:13.480]  okay in closing I want to give out
[1:49:13.480 --> 1:49:15.480]  your website tell folks about it I'm really supporting
[1:49:15.480 --> 1:49:17.480]  you now you're getting hardcore
[1:49:17.480 --> 1:49:19.480]  you've always been hardcore but more and more you're really hitting
[1:49:19.480 --> 1:49:21.480]  on all cylinders and on you know on my
[1:49:21.480 --> 1:49:23.480]  opinion you know from my perspective but in closing
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:25.480]  one minute you were two days ago
[1:49:25.480 --> 1:49:27.480]  big press conference with Ron Paul
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:29.480]  he's saying support independence now
[1:49:29.480 --> 1:49:31.480]  more than ever we need some type of fusion party
[1:49:31.480 --> 1:49:33.480]  for this election for the next
[1:49:33.480 --> 1:49:35.480]  there's more support than ever can you
[1:49:35.480 --> 1:49:37.480]  speak to that yeah never in American
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:39.480]  history of libertarians and
[1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:41.480]  conservative parties got together
[1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:43.480]  with progressive and green parties
[1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:45.480]  and they did yesterday as you said at the
[1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:47.480]  national press club at a press conference
[1:49:47.480 --> 1:49:49.480]  and they got together on four issues foreign
[1:49:49.480 --> 1:49:51.480]  policy we've got to get out of Iraq
[1:49:51.480 --> 1:49:53.480]  stop policing the world
[1:49:53.480 --> 1:49:55.480]  etc take the threat of a nuclear
[1:49:55.480 --> 1:49:57.480]  first strike off against all nations
[1:49:57.480 --> 1:49:59.480]  second privacy you know patriot act
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:01.480]  military commission act vice of legislation
[1:50:01.480 --> 1:50:03.480]  snooping we've got to reject
[1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:05.480]  the practice of torture elimination of
[1:50:05.480 --> 1:50:07.480]  habeas corpus secret tribunal secret
[1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:09.480]  prisons got to get rid of immunity for
[1:50:09.480 --> 1:50:11.480]  corporations like the telephone companies
[1:50:11.480 --> 1:50:13.480]  that spy on the American people and
[1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:15.480]  reject the unitary presidency which is
[1:50:15.480 --> 1:50:17.480]  a undermining US constitution 3
[1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:19.480]  the national debate that
[1:50:19.480 --> 1:50:21.480]  we're putting taxes on our kids and grand
[1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:23.480]  kids financing war and a lack
[1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:25.480]  for deficit financing finally a

[1:50:29.480 --> 1:50:31.480]  it's funded by the banks it needs to be
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:33.480]  thoroughly investigated and finally
[1:50:33.480 --> 1:50:35.480]  there should be a crackdown aggressively

[1:56:37.480 --> 1:56:39.480]  I'm risking my life here
[1:56:39.480 --> 1:56:41.480]  to be the tip of the spear
[1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:43.480]  because I know you're supporting me
[1:56:43.480 --> 1:56:45.480]  and you're in this fight with me
[1:56:45.480 --> 1:56:47.480]  and I know we're affecting change
[1:56:47.480 --> 1:56:49.480]  and I know we don't have a choice
[1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:51.480]  but I'm committed and we're doing this for all the right reasons

[1:56:59.480 --> 1:57:01.480]  I don't care
[1:57:01.480 --> 1:57:03.480]  we're all human beings with the same history
[1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:05.480]  the same past, the same blood, the same honor
[1:57:05.480 --> 1:57:07.480]  we're going to defeat this new old order together
[1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:09.480]  Steven Canada, you're on the air
[1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:11.480]  Hey Art, how are you doing?
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:13.480]  Good sir
[1:57:13.480 --> 1:57:15.480]  I just wanted to let everybody know
[1:57:15.480 --> 1:57:17.480]  these neocons
[1:57:17.480 --> 1:57:19.480]  we got to keep rubbing this in their faces
[1:57:19.480 --> 1:57:21.480]  all this garbage that they're stealing out at us
[1:57:21.480 --> 1:57:23.480]  every time they do something
[1:57:23.480 --> 1:57:25.480]  we got to keep letting them know
[1:57:25.480 --> 1:57:27.480]  throw it back on
[1:57:27.480 --> 1:57:29.480]  they have their cremation of hair
[1:57:29.480 --> 1:57:31.480]  I think we should have a resurrection of hair
[1:57:31.480 --> 1:57:33.480]  bring back all those little hairs
[1:57:33.480 --> 1:57:35.480]  that they don't want to worry about
[1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:37.480]  and ram it down their neocons
[1:57:37.480 --> 1:57:39.480]  no, that's it
[1:57:39.480 --> 1:57:41.480]  I think we're doing a good job
[1:57:41.480 --> 1:57:43.480]  you know what the biggest proof is
[1:57:43.480 --> 1:57:45.480]  we've taken the 9-11 murders away from them
[1:57:45.480 --> 1:57:47.480]  they were using those murders
[1:57:47.480 --> 1:57:49.480]  as fuel in their engine
[1:57:49.480 --> 1:57:51.480]  as coal in their furnace to drive their devil train
[1:57:51.480 --> 1:57:53.480]  the fact that they say
[1:57:53.480 --> 1:57:55.480]  forget about 9-11 now
[1:57:55.480 --> 1:57:57.480]  9-11's not an issue, forget about it
[1:57:57.480 --> 1:57:59.480]  they don't have as much coverage of it now
[1:57:59.480 --> 1:58:01.480]  because they know we've taken it away from them
[1:58:01.480 --> 1:58:03.480]  go ahead
[1:58:03.480 --> 1:58:05.480]  but everybody I talk to
[1:58:05.480 --> 1:58:07.480]  I do get a little frustrated
[1:58:07.480 --> 1:58:09.480]  I do hit that brick wall
[1:58:09.480 --> 1:58:11.480]  I kind of hit with friends and family
[1:58:11.480 --> 1:58:13.480]  and I try not to come across
[1:58:13.480 --> 1:58:15.480]  well sir, stay there
[1:58:15.480 --> 1:58:17.480]  I'll hold you over, one minute break
[1:58:17.480 --> 1:58:19.480]  you can't sell your family a vacuum cleaner
[1:58:19.480 --> 1:58:21.480]  any salesman will tell you
[1:58:21.480 --> 1:58:23.480]  who knows how to sell
[1:58:23.480 --> 1:58:25.480]  this is just sales 101
[1:58:25.480 --> 1:58:27.480]  you can't sell your family
[1:58:27.480 --> 1:58:29.480]  your family disrespects you
[1:58:29.480 --> 1:58:31.480]  they think you're trying to boss them
[1:58:31.480 --> 1:58:33.480]  it's easy to sell a stranger
[1:58:33.480 --> 1:58:35.480]  so your family wants to get going
[1:58:35.480 --> 1:58:37.480]  snicker and suck their thumbs like monkeys
[1:58:37.480 --> 1:58:39.480]  don't do it, move on, stay there
[1:59:13.480 --> 1:59:15.480]  some US investigators believe
[1:59:15.480 --> 1:59:17.480]  that there are Israelis again
[1:59:17.480 --> 1:59:19.480]  very much engaged in spying
[1:59:19.480 --> 1:59:21.480]  in and on the US
[1:59:21.480 --> 1:59:23.480]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[1:59:23.480 --> 1:59:49.480]  have been detained
[1:59:53.480 --> 1:59:55.480]  Waging war on corruption
[1:59:55.480 --> 1:59:59.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[2:00:05.480 --> 2:00:06.480]  Big Brother
[2:00:06.480 --> 2:00:08.480]  mainstream media
[2:00:08.480 --> 2:00:10.480]  government cover-ups
[2:00:10.480 --> 2:00:11.480]  you want answers?
[2:00:11.480 --> 2:00:13.480]  well so does he
[2:00:13.480 --> 2:00:15.480]  he's Alex Jones
[2:00:15.480 --> 2:00:17.480]  on the GCN Radio Network
[2:00:17.480 --> 2:00:20.480]  and now, live from Austin, Texas
[2:00:20.480 --> 2:00:22.480]  Alex Jones
[2:00:22.480 --> 2:00:25.480]  we stand for truth and liberty and justice
[2:00:25.480 --> 2:00:27.480]  and our enemies have taken
[2:00:27.480 --> 2:00:29.480]  that sacred duty
[2:00:29.480 --> 2:00:31.480]  and claimed that they are the knights of shining armor
[2:00:31.480 --> 2:00:34.480]  when they are murdering degenerate
[2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:36.480]  culls
[2:00:36.480 --> 2:00:38.480]  it is time for good men and women
[2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:40.480]  to stand up and take the field
[2:00:40.480 --> 2:00:41.480]  against the enemy
[2:00:41.480 --> 2:00:43.480]  Steve and Canada the Ingrid
[2:00:43.480 --> 2:00:45.480]  Steve, Steve, Jesse and others
[2:00:45.480 --> 2:00:46.480]  go ahead Steve
[2:00:46.480 --> 2:00:48.480]  yeah Alex, the only other thing
[2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:50.480]  I wanted to have a quick statement
[2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:52.480]  these guys who are taking money
[2:00:52.480 --> 2:00:54.480]  you know, as brides to go on
[2:00:54.480 --> 2:00:56.480]  with the big power struggle
[2:00:56.480 --> 2:00:58.480]  and they're living life high on the hog
[2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:00.480]  I don't think they realize
[2:01:00.480 --> 2:01:02.480]  that they're actually fueling
[2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:04.480]  the death of the economy
[2:01:04.480 --> 2:01:05.480]  and all the rest of it
[2:01:05.480 --> 2:01:07.480]  and before long
[2:01:07.480 --> 2:01:08.480]  the money that they're getting
[2:01:08.480 --> 2:01:10.480]  is not going to be worth
[2:01:10.480 --> 2:01:11.480]  the paper it's written on
[2:01:11.480 --> 2:01:12.480]  oh no, they realize that
[2:01:12.480 --> 2:01:13.480]  they want to implode it
[2:01:13.480 --> 2:01:15.480]  to get all the real assets
[2:01:15.480 --> 2:01:16.480]  now some of their minions don't
[2:01:16.480 --> 2:01:18.480]  but they want to hurt the economy
[2:01:18.480 --> 2:01:20.480]  that's in thousands of white papers
[2:01:20.480 --> 2:01:22.480]  exactly, I agree with that
[2:01:22.480 --> 2:01:24.480]  the New World Order wants to do that
[2:01:24.480 --> 2:01:26.480]  but I'm talking about the little robots
[2:01:26.480 --> 2:01:27.480]  who are paying off
[2:01:27.480 --> 2:01:29.480]  you know, these guys in Congress
[2:01:29.480 --> 2:01:30.480]  these guys in the Senate
[2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:31.480]  all the other little robots
[2:01:31.480 --> 2:01:33.480]  who are paying off
[2:01:33.480 --> 2:01:34.480]  and by the way, the US government
[2:01:34.480 --> 2:01:35.480]  is so corrupt
[2:01:35.480 --> 2:01:36.480]  it's not even the US government
[2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:38.480]  they do, they just pay off foreign leaders
[2:01:38.480 --> 2:01:39.480]  I mean with cash, illegally
[2:01:39.480 --> 2:01:41.480]  our troops, it's just all criminal
[2:01:42.480 --> 2:01:43.480]  of course everybody
[2:01:43.480 --> 2:01:45.480]  and you're right, they're paying them back
[2:01:45.480 --> 2:01:47.480]  with money that's basically already on fire
[2:01:47.480 --> 2:01:48.480]  it's burning
[2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:50.480]  so they're actually, you know
[2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:51.480]  they're hurting this stuff
[2:01:51.480 --> 2:01:52.480]  for their kids
[2:01:52.480 --> 2:01:53.480]  and their grandkids
[2:01:53.480 --> 2:01:55.480]  it's like they're giving them a goblet of wine
[2:01:55.480 --> 2:01:56.480]  with a hole in the bottle
[2:01:56.480 --> 2:01:57.480]  with a wine running out
[2:01:59.480 --> 2:02:00.480]  yeah, I totally agree
[2:02:00.480 --> 2:02:01.480]  I mean these guys
[2:02:01.480 --> 2:02:03.480]  they don't have a clue
[2:02:03.480 --> 2:02:04.480]  on what they're doing
[2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:06.480]  but they all get these dollar signs
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:07.480]  and they don't realize that
[2:02:07.480 --> 2:02:08.480]  their kids and grandchildren
[2:02:08.480 --> 2:02:09.480]  are not going to have a future
[2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:10.480]  if they keep doing what they're doing
[2:02:10.480 --> 2:02:11.480]  so they're going to
[2:02:11.480 --> 2:02:12.480]  their grandkids are drinking
[2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:14.480]  sodium fluoride right now
[2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:15.480]  they take your soul, folks
[2:02:15.480 --> 2:02:17.480]  I appreciate your call
[2:02:17.480 --> 2:02:18.480]  absolutely disgusting
[2:02:18.480 --> 2:02:20.480]  but we suffer the little children, folks
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:23.480]  most people are like brain damaged children
[2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:24.480]  but we must take care of them
[2:02:24.480 --> 2:02:25.480]  the enemy does that
[2:02:25.480 --> 2:02:26.480]  so they can feed on them
[2:02:26.480 --> 2:02:29.480]  Ingrid in Vegas, you're on the air, Ingrid
[2:02:29.480 --> 2:02:30.480]  Hello, Alex
[2:02:30.480 --> 2:02:31.480]  Hi
[2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:33.480]  I educated my friend
[2:02:33.480 --> 2:02:35.480]  on the 9-11 truth
[2:02:35.480 --> 2:02:37.480]  and last night at 11 o'clock
[2:02:37.480 --> 2:02:39.480]  we were in a casino near his house
[2:02:39.480 --> 2:02:41.480]  and he said he had to go home for a minute
[2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:42.480]  and he'll be back
[2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:44.480]  and he came back at exactly mid-night
[2:02:44.480 --> 2:02:47.480]  the anniversary of the 9-11
[2:02:47.480 --> 2:02:49.480]  and I noticed that some people
[2:02:49.480 --> 2:02:50.480]  were looking at us strange
[2:02:50.480 --> 2:02:52.480]  and I didn't know why
[2:02:52.480 --> 2:02:54.480]  then he turned around
[2:02:54.480 --> 2:02:56.480]  and he had a white t-shirt on
[2:02:56.480 --> 2:02:57.480]  and in the back
[2:02:57.480 --> 2:02:59.480]  he had in big red letters
[2:02:59.480 --> 2:03:01.480]  9-11 was an inside job
[2:03:01.480 --> 2:03:02.480]  Yes
[2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:04.480]  and he's going to make me a t-shirt
[2:03:04.480 --> 2:03:05.480]  right now
[2:03:05.480 --> 2:03:06.480]  and then we're going to go out
[2:03:06.480 --> 2:03:08.480]  and give out some of your videos
[2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:10.480]  You know, I saw a video on YouTube
[2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:12.480]  Are you the lady that got harassed
[2:03:12.480 --> 2:03:14.480]  for 9-11 stickers?
[2:03:14.480 --> 2:03:15.480]  Yes
[2:03:15.480 --> 2:03:18.480]  No, in the car, yeah
[2:03:18.480 --> 2:03:20.480]  Yeah, yeah, by the police
[2:03:20.480 --> 2:03:21.480]  for 9-11 stickers
[2:03:21.480 --> 2:03:22.480]  Yes
[2:03:22.480 --> 2:03:24.480]  That was us
[2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:26.480]  Amazing, amazing
[2:03:26.480 --> 2:03:27.480]  Small world
[2:03:27.480 --> 2:03:31.480]  Well, anything else you want to add?
[2:03:31.480 --> 2:03:33.480]  I am, no
[2:03:33.480 --> 2:03:35.480]  I just want to tell you, Dad
[2:03:35.480 --> 2:03:37.480]  what we're doing here in Las Vegas
[2:03:37.480 --> 2:03:39.480]  Super job, very exciting Ingrid
[2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:41.480]  Let's cram in Steve in Arizona
[2:03:41.480 --> 2:03:43.480]  Steve in Arizona, thank you
[2:03:43.480 --> 2:03:45.480]  Steve, go ahead
[2:03:45.480 --> 2:03:47.480]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[2:03:47.480 --> 2:03:49.480]  Listen, keep up the great work, man
[2:03:49.480 --> 2:03:51.480]  I hope you don't stop your radio show
[2:03:51.480 --> 2:03:53.480]  because me and my family listen to every day
[2:03:53.480 --> 2:03:55.480]  and we need it
[2:03:55.480 --> 2:03:57.480]  Listen, I just wanted to ask you about
[2:03:57.480 --> 2:03:59.480]  why you think Bush did
[2:03:59.480 --> 2:04:01.480]  as an inauguration
[2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:03.480]  the three minutes or five minutes earlier this last time
[2:04:03.480 --> 2:04:05.480]  and if that's going to play into the
[2:04:05.480 --> 2:04:06.480]  next inauguration time
[2:04:06.480 --> 2:04:08.480]  with martial law or anything like that
[2:04:08.480 --> 2:04:10.480]  I just think they got behind
[2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:11.480]  and wanted to
[2:04:11.480 --> 2:04:13.480]  They're all about changing the way things have been
[2:04:13.480 --> 2:04:15.480]  and bringing in the new
[2:04:15.480 --> 2:04:17.480]  Like Congress used to basically
[2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:19.480]  be above the White House, above the executive
[2:04:19.480 --> 2:04:21.480]  then the executive argued
[2:04:21.480 --> 2:04:24.480]  that no, it was a unitary
[2:04:24.480 --> 2:04:27.480]  executive that was above Congress
[2:04:27.480 --> 2:04:29.480]  See, well first, you know, Congress
[2:04:29.480 --> 2:04:31.480]  threw out the common law
[2:04:31.480 --> 2:04:34.480]  it was supposed to be, you know, equal
[2:04:34.480 --> 2:04:36.480]  co-equal, but Congress was really made to laws
[2:04:36.480 --> 2:04:38.480]  had the money, so they were with the president
[2:04:38.480 --> 2:04:40.480]  and the judicial was kind of below that
[2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:42.480]  in the order of things, but then it became
[2:04:42.480 --> 2:04:44.480]  equal and now the president just says
[2:04:44.480 --> 2:04:46.480]  shut up, you don't get to see anything
[2:04:46.480 --> 2:04:47.480]  I rule
[2:04:47.480 --> 2:04:49.480]  and so that's what we're talking about
[2:04:49.480 --> 2:04:50.480]  Anything else?
[2:04:50.480 --> 2:04:51.480]  No, that's it, Alex
[2:04:51.480 --> 2:04:52.480]  Just keep up the great work
[2:04:52.480 --> 2:04:53.480]  God bless you and your family
[2:04:53.480 --> 2:04:54.480]  and thank you so much
[2:04:54.480 --> 2:04:55.480]  God bless you, my friend
[2:04:55.480 --> 2:04:56.480]  Thanks for all the prayers
[2:04:56.480 --> 2:04:58.480]  We'll be right back
[2:05:01.480 --> 2:05:03.480]  Did you know that pH balance
[2:05:03.480 --> 2:05:05.480]  is one of the most important factors
[2:05:05.480 --> 2:05:07.480]  in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[2:05:07.480 --> 2:05:09.480]  Most experts agree that the water you drink
[2:05:09.480 --> 2:05:12.480]  should be at a pH level of 9 or higher
[2:05:12.480 --> 2:05:14.480]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula
[2:05:14.480 --> 2:05:17.480]  of the most alkaline minerals and elements
[2:05:17.480 --> 2:05:19.480]  This product is a one of a kind in its
[2:05:19.480 --> 2:05:21.480]  strength and effectiveness
[2:05:21.480 --> 2:05:23.480]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the
[2:05:23.480 --> 2:05:25.480]  best ways to make your water alkaline
[2:05:25.480 --> 2:05:27.480]  while helping you get rid of acid
[2:05:27.480 --> 2:05:29.480]  and regaining your health and energy
[2:05:29.480 --> 2:05:31.480]  With just 10 drops, you can raise
[2:05:31.480 --> 2:05:33.480]  the pH level of the water you drink
[2:05:33.480 --> 2:05:35.480]  up to the pH of 10
[2:05:35.480 --> 2:05:37.480]  Alkalizing water helps the body
[2:05:37.480 --> 2:05:38.480]  rid itself of acidic waste
[2:05:38.480 --> 2:05:40.480]  and increases the oxygen content
[2:05:40.480 --> 2:05:41.480]  of your body
[2:05:41.480 --> 2:05:43.480]  Disease organisms like bacteria
[2:05:43.480 --> 2:05:45.480]  and cancer cannot survive
[2:05:45.480 --> 2:05:46.480]  in an alkaline environment

[2:06:05.480 --> 2:06:07.480]  in the near future
[2:06:07.480 --> 2:06:09.480]  Earth is dominated by a powerful
[2:06:09.480 --> 2:06:10.480]  world government
[2:06:10.480 --> 2:06:12.480]  It's known as the Builder Bird
[2:06:12.480 --> 2:06:14.480]  Doesn't their objective be
[2:06:14.480 --> 2:06:15.480]  world domination?
[2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:17.480]  For thousands of years
[2:06:17.480 --> 2:06:19.480]  their dark order grew
[2:06:19.480 --> 2:06:21.480]  Now as they hail the birth
[2:06:21.480 --> 2:06:22.480]  of the new world order
[2:06:22.480 --> 2:06:23.480]  their great dream
[2:06:23.480 --> 2:06:25.480]  of exterminating 80%
[2:06:25.480 --> 2:06:27.480]  of humanity is at hand

[2:06:40.480 --> 2:06:41.480]  toward a world government
[2:06:41.480 --> 2:06:42.480]  Most people have no idea
[2:06:42.480 --> 2:06:43.480]  they're not after money
[2:06:43.480 --> 2:06:44.480]  They have all the money they need
[2:06:44.480 --> 2:06:45.480]  They're after power

[2:07:06.480 --> 2:07:07.480]  These heavy metal toxins
[2:07:07.480 --> 2:07:09.480]  are difficult or even impossible
[2:07:09.480 --> 2:07:10.480]  to avoid
[2:07:10.480 --> 2:07:11.480]  Even trace amounts
[2:07:11.480 --> 2:07:12.480]  of these heavy metals
[2:07:12.480 --> 2:07:14.480]  over time can impact your health
[2:07:14.480 --> 2:07:15.480]  Many health problems
[2:07:15.480 --> 2:07:16.480]  have been suggested
[2:07:16.480 --> 2:07:17.480]  as being related
[2:07:17.480 --> 2:07:18.480]  to this heavy metal exposure
[2:07:18.480 --> 2:07:19.480]  including memory loss
[2:07:19.480 --> 2:07:20.480]  high blood pressure

[2:07:26.480 --> 2:07:27.480]  and more
[2:07:27.480 --> 2:07:28.480]  Unfortunately traditional detoxifying
[2:07:28.480 --> 2:07:29.480]  isn't able to clear
[2:07:29.480 --> 2:07:30.480]  harmful and potentially
[2:07:30.480 --> 2:07:31.480]  deadly toxins
[2:07:31.480 --> 2:07:33.480]  That's why there's PuraClear

[2:08:32.480 --> 2:08:33.480]  that we're going to do
[2:08:33.480 --> 2:08:34.480]  in a few weeks
[2:08:34.480 --> 2:08:35.480]  a two hour interview
[2:08:35.480 --> 2:08:36.480]  with him
[2:08:36.480 --> 2:08:37.480]  on his new book

[2:08:40.480 --> 2:08:41.480]  how they're setting it up
[2:08:41.480 --> 2:08:42.480]  worldwide to be controlled
[2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:43.480]  you'll still have nations
[2:08:43.480 --> 2:08:44.480]  they're just dominated
[2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:45.480]  by a global government
[2:08:45.480 --> 2:08:46.480]  that sits above
[2:08:46.480 --> 2:08:47.480]  through the national
[2:08:47.480 --> 2:08:48.480]  security states
[2:08:48.480 --> 2:08:49.480]  that bypass the capitals
[2:08:49.480 --> 2:08:50.480]  and the parliaments
[2:08:50.480 --> 2:08:52.480]  and the legislatures
[2:08:52.480 --> 2:08:54.480]  and then they just
[2:08:54.480 --> 2:08:55.480]  basically are foot soldiers
[2:08:55.480 --> 2:08:56.480]  who implement
[2:08:56.480 --> 2:08:58.480]  what the COG tells them
[2:08:58.480 --> 2:08:59.480]  that's coming up
[2:08:59.480 --> 2:09:00.480]  in a few weeks
[2:09:00.480 --> 2:09:01.480]  when his book comes out
[2:09:01.480 --> 2:09:02.480]  I want to hold him
[2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:03.480]  a little bit
[2:09:03.480 --> 2:09:04.480]  five minutes to the next hour
[2:09:04.480 --> 2:09:05.480]  so he gets a full hour
[2:09:05.480 --> 2:09:06.480]  then Bob Chapman's joining us
[2:09:06.480 --> 2:09:07.480]  we'll take calls

[2:09:13.480 --> 2:09:14.480]  in New York

[2:09:15.480 --> 2:09:17.480]  but
[2:09:17.480 --> 2:09:18.480]  briefly for listeners
[2:09:18.480 --> 2:09:19.480]  who don't know who you are

[2:09:20.480 --> 2:09:21.480]  tell us who you are
[2:09:21.480 --> 2:09:22.480]  in a nutshell
[2:09:22.480 --> 2:09:23.480]  what parts of the bio
[2:09:23.480 --> 2:09:24.480]  you think are most important
[2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:25.480]  and then you've got
[2:09:25.480 --> 2:09:26.480]  the floor
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:27.480]  what you discovered
[2:09:27.480 --> 2:09:28.480]  in your in-depth research
[2:09:28.480 --> 2:09:30.480]  on what GMO is all about
[2:09:30.480 --> 2:09:31.480]  dominating a market
[2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:33.480]  controlling the larger
[2:09:33.480 --> 2:09:34.480]  eugenics operation
[2:09:34.480 --> 2:09:36.480]  because we need to understand
[2:09:36.480 --> 2:09:38.480]  how these master architects
[2:09:38.480 --> 2:09:39.480]  are designing
[2:09:39.480 --> 2:09:40.480]  and controlling
[2:09:40.480 --> 2:09:41.480]  our society
[2:09:41.480 --> 2:09:43.480]  it's just amazing
[2:09:43.480 --> 2:09:44.480]  so you've got the floor sir
[2:09:44.480 --> 2:09:45.480]  introduce yourself
[2:09:45.480 --> 2:09:47.480]  tell us the most important info
[2:09:47.480 --> 2:09:49.480]  and then lay it out
[2:09:49.480 --> 2:09:50.480]  okay Alex
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:51.480]  thank you
[2:09:51.480 --> 2:09:53.480]  well just very briefly
[2:09:53.480 --> 2:09:55.480]  I've been at this for
[2:09:55.480 --> 2:09:57.480]  some 36 years now
[2:09:57.480 --> 2:09:59.480]  and it started during the
[2:09:59.480 --> 2:10:00.480]  70s
[2:10:00.480 --> 2:10:01.480]  when I was working as a
[2:10:01.480 --> 2:10:02.480]  journalist in New York City
[2:10:02.480 --> 2:10:04.480]  during the first oil shock
[2:10:04.480 --> 2:10:06.480]  and I became
[2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:08.480]  not intrigued
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:10.480]  but simply
[2:10:10.480 --> 2:10:12.480]  drawn to understand
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:13.480]  what was behind that
[2:10:13.480 --> 2:10:14.480]  that whole oil shock
[2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:16.480]  and the manipulation of prices
[2:10:16.480 --> 2:10:17.480]  by 400% the role
[2:10:17.480 --> 2:10:19.480]  of people like Henry Kissinger
[2:10:19.480 --> 2:10:20.480]  and that began
[2:10:20.480 --> 2:10:22.480]  a decades long research
[2:10:22.480 --> 2:10:24.480]  into the structures of power
[2:10:24.480 --> 2:10:25.480]  I guess you will
[2:10:25.480 --> 2:10:27.480]  which led me into a
[2:10:27.480 --> 2:10:29.480]  much more refined field
[2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:32.480]  that was established
[2:10:32.480 --> 2:10:34.480]  first by a British
[2:10:34.480 --> 2:10:36.480]  geographer named Halford
[2:10:36.480 --> 2:10:38.480]  McKinder in the beginning
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:40.480]  of the last century 1904
[2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:42.480]  called geopolitics
[2:10:42.480 --> 2:10:43.480]  the relation between
[2:10:43.480 --> 2:10:45.480]  geography and political power
[2:10:45.480 --> 2:10:48.480]  Henry Kissinger is a
[2:10:48.480 --> 2:10:50.480]  student of McKinder geopolitics
[2:10:50.480 --> 2:10:53.480]  as is Obama's foreign policy advisor
[2:10:53.480 --> 2:10:55.480]  Zbigniew Brzezinski
[2:10:55.480 --> 2:10:56.480]  both Kissinger
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:10:58.480]  Kissinger is backing of course
[2:10:58.480 --> 2:11:00.480]  John McCain
[2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:02.480]  in the coming election
[2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:06.480]  so I've been looking at
[2:11:06.480 --> 2:11:07.480]  aspects of power
[2:11:07.480 --> 2:11:08.480]  and how power is exercised
[2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:10.480]  from the rise and decline
[2:11:10.480 --> 2:11:11.480]  of the British Empire
[2:11:11.480 --> 2:11:13.480]  three centuries ago
[2:11:13.480 --> 2:11:15.480]  down to the first world war
[2:11:15.480 --> 2:11:16.480]  second world war
[2:11:16.480 --> 2:11:18.480]  and the emergence of the
[2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:20.480]  American century
[2:11:20.480 --> 2:11:22.480]  after the 1940s
[2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:24.480]  and that
[2:11:24.480 --> 2:11:26.480]  led me into a quote
[2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:28.480]  that Kissinger gave
[2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:30.480]  sometime during the 1970s
[2:11:30.480 --> 2:11:32.480]  where he said
[2:11:32.480 --> 2:11:34.480]  if you control oil
[2:11:34.480 --> 2:11:36.480]  you control entire nations
[2:11:36.480 --> 2:11:38.480]  or groups of nations
[2:11:38.480 --> 2:11:39.480]  if you control food
[2:11:39.480 --> 2:11:41.480]  Kissinger said
[2:11:41.480 --> 2:11:43.480]  you control people
[2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:46.480]  and the volume
[2:11:46.480 --> 2:11:48.480]  seeds of destruction
[2:11:48.480 --> 2:11:50.480]  the hidden agenda of genetic manipulation
[2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:52.480]  I've been working since the 1980s
[2:11:52.480 --> 2:11:54.480]  on the whole question of
[2:11:54.480 --> 2:11:55.480]  agribusiness
[2:11:55.480 --> 2:11:57.480]  the grain cartel
[2:11:57.480 --> 2:11:59.480]  the control of the food chain
[2:11:59.480 --> 2:12:01.480]  through three or four
[2:12:01.480 --> 2:12:03.480]  highly private companies
[2:12:03.480 --> 2:12:05.480]  such as Cargill, Archer Daniels,
[2:12:05.480 --> 2:12:06.480]  Midland, Bungie
[2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:08.480]  that used to be continental grain
[2:12:08.480 --> 2:12:09.480]  no longer
[2:12:09.480 --> 2:12:11.480]  and the industrialization
[2:12:11.480 --> 2:12:13.480]  of agriculture
[2:12:13.480 --> 2:12:15.480]  and that led me to
[2:12:15.480 --> 2:12:17.480]  oh, some years ago
[2:12:17.480 --> 2:12:19.480]  began research on a phenomenon
[2:12:19.480 --> 2:12:21.480]  called genetic engineering
[2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:23.480]  of plants
[2:12:23.480 --> 2:12:25.480]  and at first I thought
[2:12:25.480 --> 2:12:27.480]  well perhaps this is a case where
[2:12:27.480 --> 2:12:29.480]  science is doing mankind some good
[2:12:29.480 --> 2:12:31.480]  they've come up with a more efficient way
[2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:33.480]  higher yields, less pesticides
[2:12:33.480 --> 2:12:35.480]  less chemicals
[2:12:35.480 --> 2:12:37.480]  the hype sounded pretty good
[2:12:37.480 --> 2:12:39.480]  as I dug deeper
[2:12:39.480 --> 2:12:41.480]  I not only became
[2:12:41.480 --> 2:12:43.480]  quite alarmed at the
[2:12:43.480 --> 2:12:45.480]  case studies of farmers across the United States
[2:12:45.480 --> 2:12:47.480]  in Argentina
[2:12:47.480 --> 2:12:49.480]  and also in limited
[2:12:49.480 --> 2:12:51.480]  cases here in Germany
[2:12:51.480 --> 2:12:53.480]  I came to know many of these
[2:12:53.480 --> 2:12:55.480]  farmers personally and
[2:12:55.480 --> 2:12:57.480]  the stories they have to tell about
[2:12:57.480 --> 2:12:59.480]  GMO plants would make your hair stand on end
[2:12:59.480 --> 2:13:01.480]  in any case
[2:13:01.480 --> 2:13:03.480]  that wasn't the reason I
[2:13:03.480 --> 2:13:05.480]  wrote the seeds of destruction book
[2:13:05.480 --> 2:13:07.480]  the reason I wrote it is because
[2:13:07.480 --> 2:13:09.480]  as I dug deeper I found out that
[2:13:09.480 --> 2:13:11.480]  the entire project
[2:13:11.480 --> 2:13:13.480]  of GMO
[2:13:13.480 --> 2:13:15.480]  was financed from the get-go
[2:13:15.480 --> 2:13:17.480]  by the same family foundation
[2:13:17.480 --> 2:13:19.480]  which financed
[2:13:19.480 --> 2:13:21.480]  the Nazi race science eugenics
[2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:23.480]  during the 1920's
[2:13:23.480 --> 2:13:25.480]  and 1930's and when I say Nazi
[2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:27.480]  race science I mean the Kaiser Wilhelm
[2:13:27.480 --> 2:13:29.480]  Institute in Berlin
[2:13:29.480 --> 2:13:31.480]  and in Munich where they did
[2:13:31.480 --> 2:13:33.480]  brain research
[2:13:33.480 --> 2:13:35.480]  they did forced sterilization
[2:13:35.480 --> 2:13:37.480]  experiments and so forth
[2:13:37.480 --> 2:13:39.480]  and that predates Hitler and
[2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:41.480]  of course it was a Rockefeller family
[2:13:41.480 --> 2:13:43.480]  I haven't read your book but I know that
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:45.480]  from the research and again
[2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:47.480]  this is for my study
[2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:49.480]  it's an absolute fact not my opinion
[2:13:49.480 --> 2:13:51.480]  or your opinion the foundation
[2:13:51.480 --> 2:13:53.480]  of all the modern social planning
[2:13:53.480 --> 2:13:55.480]  and the direction of all the sciences
[2:13:55.480 --> 2:13:57.480]  is to carry out
[2:13:57.480 --> 2:13:59.480]  aggressive negative eugenics
[2:13:59.480 --> 2:14:01.480]  against the population
[2:14:01.480 --> 2:14:03.480]  go ahead
[2:14:03.480 --> 2:14:05.480]  the Nazis called it creating the master race
[2:14:05.480 --> 2:14:07.480]  and eliminating the inferior races
[2:14:07.480 --> 2:14:09.480]  Auschwitz and places like that
[2:14:09.480 --> 2:14:11.480]  were connected
[2:14:11.480 --> 2:14:13.480]  with that whole enterprise
[2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:15.480]  Joseph Mengele the doctor of death
[2:14:15.480 --> 2:14:17.480]  he was a part of this
[2:14:17.480 --> 2:14:19.480]  Nazi eugenics and
[2:14:19.480 --> 2:14:21.480]  many of these scientists interesting enough
[2:14:21.480 --> 2:14:23.480]  were brought back
[2:14:23.480 --> 2:14:25.480]  on the quiet by the
[2:14:25.480 --> 2:14:27.480]  Rockefeller Foundation and their networks
[2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:29.480]  to do research
[2:14:29.480 --> 2:14:31.480]  they were sheep dipped and
[2:14:31.480 --> 2:14:33.480]  laundered into respectable
[2:14:33.480 --> 2:14:35.480]  German scientists or whatever
[2:14:35.480 --> 2:14:37.480]  and continued their work
[2:14:37.480 --> 2:14:39.480]  in various institutions in New York State
[2:14:39.480 --> 2:14:41.480]  and elsewhere and here's a microcosm
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:43.480]  with the Cold Springs Harbor
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:45.480]  you have Dr. Watson
[2:14:45.480 --> 2:14:47.480]  not the IBM eugenicist who funded
[2:14:47.480 --> 2:14:49.480]  a lot of it and the machines that were used
[2:14:49.480 --> 2:14:51.480]  for listeners but the other Watson
[2:14:51.480 --> 2:14:53.480]  who just said a few months ago blacks aren't human
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:55.480]  basically and they got in trouble
[2:14:55.480 --> 2:14:57.480]  and lost his job at the
[2:14:57.480 --> 2:14:59.480]  human genome project
[2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:01.480]  at Cold Springs Harbor
[2:15:01.480 --> 2:15:03.480]  well he was there as a graduate student
[2:15:03.480 --> 2:15:05.480]  when it was the eugenics facility
[2:15:05.480 --> 2:15:07.480]  running the genome project
[2:15:07.480 --> 2:15:09.480]  so the names have changed
[2:15:09.480 --> 2:15:11.480]  but it's never stopped
[2:15:11.480 --> 2:15:13.480]  well they got into an embarrassment
[2:15:13.480 --> 2:15:15.480]  right after the war when all the
[2:15:15.480 --> 2:15:17.480]  Auschwitz and
[2:15:17.480 --> 2:15:19.480]  Bergen-Belsen the various gas ovens
[2:15:19.480 --> 2:15:21.480]  came out in the Nuremberg trials
[2:15:21.480 --> 2:15:23.480]  and they said well
[2:15:23.480 --> 2:15:25.480]  the new name of eugenics
[2:15:25.480 --> 2:15:27.480]  is genetics
[2:15:27.480 --> 2:15:29.480]  and then John D. Rockefeller III
[2:15:29.480 --> 2:15:31.480]  who was a passionate
[2:15:31.480 --> 2:15:33.480]  eugenicist
[2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:35.480]  race reducer if you will
[2:15:35.480 --> 2:15:37.480]  he
[2:15:37.480 --> 2:15:39.480]  founded something called the Population Council
[2:15:39.480 --> 2:15:41.480]  with the
[2:15:41.480 --> 2:15:43.480]  Frederick Osborne
[2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:45.480]  the former president of the American Eugenics Society
[2:15:45.480 --> 2:15:47.480]  and Osborne
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:49.480]  if you go to Princeton one of the
[2:15:49.480 --> 2:15:51.480]  elite
[2:15:51.480 --> 2:15:53.480]  American universities
[2:15:53.480 --> 2:15:55.480]  and go to the Osborne Field House
[2:15:55.480 --> 2:15:57.480]  it's named after Frederick Osborne
[2:15:57.480 --> 2:15:59.480]  he was a graduate of Princeton
[2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:01.480]  at one point I remember
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:03.480]  the Board of Trustees these are
[2:16:03.480 --> 2:16:05.480]  the highly respectable
[2:16:05.480 --> 2:16:07.480]  the president of Stanford University
[2:16:07.480 --> 2:16:09.480]  wrote a book on the master race
[2:16:09.480 --> 2:16:11.480]  at this time this was Salon Faye
[2:16:11.480 --> 2:16:13.480]  this whole eugenics agenda
[2:16:13.480 --> 2:16:15.480]  in the 30s
[2:16:15.480 --> 2:16:17.480]  and Rockefeller Foundation
[2:16:17.480 --> 2:16:19.480]  the same people who
[2:16:19.480 --> 2:16:21.480]  backed that agenda Margaret Sanger
[2:16:21.480 --> 2:16:23.480]  her family planning
[2:16:23.480 --> 2:16:25.480]  business and so forth
[2:16:25.480 --> 2:16:27.480]  she was an intimate friend
[2:16:27.480 --> 2:16:29.480]  it won't speculate on how intimate
[2:16:29.480 --> 2:16:31.480]  of the Rockefeller family until her death
[2:16:31.480 --> 2:16:33.480]  as well as
[2:16:33.480 --> 2:16:35.480]  a reputed
[2:16:35.480 --> 2:16:37.480]  intimate friend of H.G. Wells
[2:16:37.480 --> 2:16:39.480]  and other members of the elite
[2:16:39.480 --> 2:16:41.480]  so this group
[2:16:41.480 --> 2:16:43.480]  developed
[2:16:43.480 --> 2:16:45.480]  a project after
[2:16:45.480 --> 2:16:47.480]  the 1950s which they called
[2:16:47.480 --> 2:16:49.480]  the Population Council
[2:16:49.480 --> 2:16:51.480]  John D. Rockefeller and Osborne
[2:16:51.480 --> 2:16:53.480]  founded this thing with Rockefeller money
[2:16:53.480 --> 2:16:55.480]  and that started research on
[2:16:55.480 --> 2:16:57.480]  all sorts of things including
[2:16:57.480 --> 2:16:59.480]  creation of
[2:16:59.480 --> 2:17:01.480]  intrauterine devices
[2:17:01.480 --> 2:17:03.480]  they were desperately trying to come up
[2:17:03.480 --> 2:17:05.480]  with something called a birth control pill
[2:17:05.480 --> 2:17:07.480]  someone else got to it
[2:17:07.480 --> 2:17:09.480]  before their research
[2:17:09.480 --> 2:17:11.480]  and then all their IUDs
[2:17:11.480 --> 2:17:13.480]  would eat women's uteruses
[2:17:13.480 --> 2:17:15.480]  it was always a mistake but it turned out
[2:17:15.480 --> 2:17:17.480]  that was all by design
[2:17:17.480 --> 2:17:19.480]  well it's been alleged
[2:17:19.480 --> 2:17:21.480]  I won't go into the details of that
[2:17:21.480 --> 2:17:23.480]  for legal reasons
[2:17:23.480 --> 2:17:25.480]  but it was a catastrophe
[2:17:25.480 --> 2:17:27.480]  and one thing after another
[2:17:27.480 --> 2:17:29.480]  their agenda has been
[2:17:29.480 --> 2:17:31.480]  well take what the Rockefellers
[2:17:31.480 --> 2:17:33.480]  what John D. Rockefeller did in Puerto Rico
[2:17:33.480 --> 2:17:35.480]  which the Rockefeller family
[2:17:35.480 --> 2:17:37.480]  treated as a private island
[2:17:37.480 --> 2:17:39.480]  plantation
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:41.480]  they went in there in the 50s and used
[2:17:41.480 --> 2:17:43.480]  Puerto Rican women of child bearing age
[2:17:43.480 --> 2:17:45.480]  as literally and I use
[2:17:45.480 --> 2:17:47.480]  the term as the Rockefellers would see it
[2:17:47.480 --> 2:17:49.480]  as human guinea pigs
[2:17:49.480 --> 2:17:51.480]  and when women would go into
[2:17:51.480 --> 2:17:53.480]  they started a whole series of
[2:17:53.480 --> 2:17:55.480]  rural clinics
[2:17:55.480 --> 2:17:57.480]  and said here the hygiene is better
[2:17:57.480 --> 2:17:59.480]  than having a midwife give birth to your child
[2:17:59.480 --> 2:18:01.480]  come into our local clinic
[2:18:01.480 --> 2:18:03.480]  and
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:05.480]  and have birth for your baby
[2:18:05.480 --> 2:18:07.480]  and the doctors in the clinics
[2:18:07.480 --> 2:18:09.480]  would sew up the
[2:18:09.480 --> 2:18:11.480]  the ovaries of the woman so that she couldn't have
[2:18:11.480 --> 2:18:13.480]  further children
[2:18:13.480 --> 2:18:15.480]  and at a certain point by the end of the 50s
[2:18:15.480 --> 2:18:17.480]  it was estimated that something like
[2:18:17.480 --> 2:18:19.480]  38% of the child bearing women
[2:18:19.480 --> 2:18:21.480]  in Puerto Rico had been
[2:18:21.480 --> 2:18:23.480]  forced sterilized by the Rockefeller project
[2:18:23.480 --> 2:18:25.480]  well it's confirmed that during the 70s
[2:18:25.480 --> 2:18:27.480]  George Bush Sr. before he went to China
[2:18:27.480 --> 2:18:29.480]  and struck the one child policy deal
[2:18:29.480 --> 2:18:31.480]  they implemented in a few years later in 1980
[2:18:31.480 --> 2:18:33.480]  that they sterilized on some reservations
[2:18:33.480 --> 2:18:35.480]  more than 40% of the women
[2:18:35.480 --> 2:18:37.480]  same deal you go in to have the baby
[2:18:37.480 --> 2:18:39.480]  and they sew you up there on the spot
[2:18:39.480 --> 2:18:41.480]  yeah
[2:18:41.480 --> 2:18:43.480]  so this is what we're dealing with
[2:18:43.480 --> 2:18:45.480]  when we're dealing with GMO
[2:18:45.480 --> 2:18:47.480]  why do I say that that's
[2:18:47.480 --> 2:18:49.480]  some listeners that might be in extreme position
[2:18:49.480 --> 2:18:51.480]  but
[2:18:51.480 --> 2:18:53.480]  Rockefeller Foundation
[2:18:53.480 --> 2:18:55.480]  initiated a whole field
[2:18:55.480 --> 2:18:57.480]  called microbiology back in the late 1930s
[2:18:57.480 --> 2:18:59.480]  when they were doing the eugenics
[2:18:59.480 --> 2:19:01.480]  in order they were
[2:19:01.480 --> 2:19:03.480]  if you will
[2:19:03.480 --> 2:19:05.480]  in a mad pursuit
[2:19:05.480 --> 2:19:07.480]  of a method
[2:19:07.480 --> 2:19:09.480]  for reducing life down to a little
[2:19:09.480 --> 2:19:11.480]  tiny little atom called
[2:19:11.480 --> 2:19:13.480]  DNA or gene
[2:19:13.480 --> 2:19:15.480]  and
[2:19:15.480 --> 2:19:17.480]  manipulating that gene so that they could
[2:19:17.480 --> 2:19:19.480]  literally play God and control life
[2:19:19.480 --> 2:19:21.480]  and what shape life would take
[2:19:21.480 --> 2:19:23.480]  or wouldn't take at all
[2:19:23.480 --> 2:19:25.480]  and so they funded to the tune of
[2:19:25.480 --> 2:19:27.480]  more than 100 million dollars in the Philippines
[2:19:27.480 --> 2:19:29.480]  at the Rice Research Institute
[2:19:29.480 --> 2:19:31.480]  the so-called Golden Rice Project
[2:19:31.480 --> 2:19:33.480]  which is a total sham
[2:19:33.480 --> 2:19:35.480]  they funded this GMO
[2:19:35.480 --> 2:19:37.480]  development
[2:19:37.480 --> 2:19:39.480]  again
[2:19:39.480 --> 2:19:41.480]  as my film in-game states
[2:19:41.480 --> 2:19:43.480]  every major modern science
[2:19:43.480 --> 2:19:45.480]  Carnegie, Rockefeller
[2:19:45.480 --> 2:19:47.480]  and it's all
[2:19:47.480 --> 2:19:49.480]  funded to sterilize you
[2:19:49.480 --> 2:19:51.480]  to soft kill you
[2:19:51.480 --> 2:19:53.480]  to keep you from passing
[2:19:53.480 --> 2:19:55.480]  on your genetics
[2:19:55.480 --> 2:19:57.480]  and it's all during the DNA
[2:19:57.480 --> 2:19:59.480]  from generation to generation
[2:19:59.480 --> 2:20:25.480]  my blood pressure
[2:20:25.480 --> 2:20:29.480]  has normalized my diabetes has totally improved
[2:20:29.480 --> 2:20:31.480]  everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look
[2:20:31.480 --> 2:20:33.480]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel
[2:20:33.480 --> 2:20:35.480]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone
[2:20:35.480 --> 2:20:37.480]  anybody over 40 in the North American continent
[2:20:37.480 --> 2:20:39.480]  should be using this product
[2:20:39.480 --> 2:20:41.480]  as a preventative to keep their
[2:20:41.480 --> 2:20:59.480]  cardiovascular system healthy
[2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:13.480]  the day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[2:21:13.480 --> 2:21:15.480]  we have to look to the Middle East
[2:21:15.480 --> 2:21:17.480]  we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[2:21:17.480 --> 2:21:19.480]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film
[2:21:19.480 --> 2:21:21.480]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[2:21:21.480 --> 2:21:23.480]  to intelligence networks inside the United States
[2:21:23.480 --> 2:21:25.480]  some US investigators believe
[2:21:25.480 --> 2:21:27.480]  that there are Israelis again
[2:21:27.480 --> 2:21:31.480]  very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[2:21:31.480 --> 2:21:33.480]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[2:21:33.480 --> 2:21:35.480]  have been detained
[2:21:35.480 --> 2:21:37.480]  Laden's connections to the CIA
[2:21:37.480 --> 2:21:39.480]  the hijackers ties to the FBI
[2:21:39.480 --> 2:21:41.480]  the Saudi Arabian connection
[2:21:41.480 --> 2:21:43.480]  the Israeli intelligence network
[2:21:43.480 --> 2:21:45.480]  warnings and war games
[2:21:45.480 --> 2:21:47.480]  the shadow government and much much more

[2:21:59.480 --> 2:22:01.480]  on the average Americans
[2:22:01.480 --> 2:22:03.480]  work between 45 to 50 years
[2:22:03.480 --> 2:22:05.480]  hoping to build up enough wealth
[2:22:05.480 --> 2:22:07.480]  to retire and live out their golden years
[2:22:07.480 --> 2:22:09.480]  unfortunately with taxation
[2:22:09.480 --> 2:22:11.480]  the rising cost of food, energy, housing
[2:22:11.480 --> 2:22:13.480]  and medical many retirees
[2:22:13.480 --> 2:22:15.480]  are forced to live below the poverty line
[2:22:15.480 --> 2:22:17.480]  is this a flaw for the enterprise
[2:22:17.480 --> 2:22:19.480]  or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note
[2:22:19.480 --> 2:22:21.480]  forcing us into perpetual debt
[2:22:21.480 --> 2:22:23.480]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes
[2:22:23.480 --> 2:22:25.480]  these questions and more can be answered
[2:22:25.480 --> 2:22:27.480]  by reading G. Edward Griffin's book

[2:23:57.480 --> 2:24:19.480]  let's not waste any time in this short segment
[2:24:19.480 --> 2:24:21.480]  William Engold
[2:24:21.480 --> 2:24:23.480]  continue with the Rockefeller foundation
[2:24:23.480 --> 2:24:25.480]  the cold springs harbor
[2:24:25.480 --> 2:24:27.480]  really founding what we know of now
[2:24:27.480 --> 2:24:29.480]  as the whole genetic
[2:24:29.480 --> 2:24:31.480]  modification
[2:24:31.480 --> 2:24:33.480]  science
[2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:35.480]  I call this the project
[2:24:35.480 --> 2:24:37.480]  with the capital T
[2:24:37.480 --> 2:24:39.480]  the idea
[2:24:39.480 --> 2:24:41.480]  of patenting
[2:24:41.480 --> 2:24:43.480]  and genetically modifying
[2:24:43.480 --> 2:24:45.480]  seeds of the basic
[2:24:45.480 --> 2:24:47.480]  food stock
[2:24:47.480 --> 2:24:49.480]  of the human food chain
[2:24:49.480 --> 2:24:51.480]  rice, wheat
[2:24:51.480 --> 2:24:53.480]  soybeans, corn
[2:24:53.480 --> 2:24:55.480]  this is what they've targeted
[2:24:55.480 --> 2:24:57.480]  and
[2:24:57.480 --> 2:24:59.480]  more than 100 million dollars of Rockefeller research money
[2:24:59.480 --> 2:25:01.480]  has gone into this
[2:25:01.480 --> 2:25:03.480]  since the late 1960s
[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:05.480]  early 1970s
[2:25:05.480 --> 2:25:07.480]  then the other thing that
[2:25:07.480 --> 2:25:09.480]  makes this a geopolitical question
[2:25:09.480 --> 2:25:11.480]  not simply a question of biology
[2:25:11.480 --> 2:25:13.480]  is the fact that
[2:25:13.480 --> 2:25:15.480]  the patents are in the hands
[2:25:15.480 --> 2:25:17.480]  of four giant
[2:25:17.480 --> 2:25:19.480]  agribusiness companies
[2:25:19.480 --> 2:25:21.480]  seed companies that actually started out
[2:25:21.480 --> 2:25:23.480]  as chemical companies and remain chemical companies
[2:25:23.480 --> 2:25:25.480]  and that's why the seeds
[2:25:25.480 --> 2:25:27.480]  most of them have to have that special chemical
[2:25:27.480 --> 2:25:29.480]  plot
[2:25:29.480 --> 2:25:31.480]  I'll go through this in a minute Alex
[2:25:31.480 --> 2:25:33.480]  if you bear with me
[2:25:33.480 --> 2:25:35.480]  the three of the four
[2:25:35.480 --> 2:25:37.480]  horsemen of the apocalypse I call them
[2:25:37.480 --> 2:25:39.480]  Monsanto, Dupont
[2:25:39.480 --> 2:25:41.480]  and Dow Chemical
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:43.480]  three of the four have intimate connections
[2:25:43.480 --> 2:25:45.480]  with top secret Pentagon
[2:25:45.480 --> 2:25:47.480]  bio weapons research programs
[2:25:47.480 --> 2:25:49.480]  including during the Vietnam war
[2:25:49.480 --> 2:25:51.480]  and Orange
[2:25:51.480 --> 2:25:53.480]  PCBs, dioxins
[2:25:53.480 --> 2:25:55.480]  they have lied repeatedly to the public
[2:25:55.480 --> 2:25:57.480]  about the danger
[2:25:57.480 --> 2:25:59.480]  and the contamination of those chemicals
[2:25:59.480 --> 2:26:01.480]  in the streams of their factories
[2:26:01.480 --> 2:26:03.480]  across New York State and across America
[2:26:03.480 --> 2:26:05.480]  and
[2:26:05.480 --> 2:26:07.480]  we are told that we should trust
[2:26:07.480 --> 2:26:09.480]  these corporations
[2:26:09.480 --> 2:26:11.480]  these agribusiness giants
[2:26:11.480 --> 2:26:13.480]  to have the world's seed
[2:26:13.480 --> 2:26:15.480]  stock in their hands in those private hands
[2:26:15.480 --> 2:26:17.480]  well add to that
[2:26:17.480 --> 2:26:19.480]  question of Terminator
[2:26:19.480 --> 2:26:21.480]  I'll come back to your point in just a minute
[2:26:21.480 --> 2:26:23.480]  but the Terminator
[2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:25.480]  is a popular name for something
[2:26:25.480 --> 2:26:27.480]  called GURTS
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:29.480]  in the trade they call it
[2:26:29.480 --> 2:26:31.480]  genetic use restriction technology
[2:26:31.480 --> 2:26:33.480]  very nice sounding scientific neutral name
[2:26:33.480 --> 2:26:35.480]  but what it means
[2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:37.480]  Terminator is far more appropriate
[2:26:37.480 --> 2:26:39.480]  as Arnold Schwarzenegger's
[2:26:39.480 --> 2:26:41.480]  films portray it
[2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:43.480]  it's a sterilizer
[2:26:43.480 --> 2:26:45.480]  it's their variations of it
[2:26:45.480 --> 2:26:47.480]  so it's not the terminator seeds
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:49.480]  that are activated by certain chemicals
[2:26:49.480 --> 2:26:51.480]  or in the Terminator simple case
[2:26:51.480 --> 2:26:53.480]  they simply
[2:26:53.480 --> 2:26:55.480]  give one harvest yield and then
[2:26:55.480 --> 2:26:57.480]  commit suicide so
[2:26:57.480 --> 2:26:59.480]  the farmer has to go back to Monsanto
[2:26:59.480 --> 2:27:01.480]  or Dupont or Singenta
[2:27:01.480 --> 2:27:03.480]  each harvest year and get new seeds
[2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:05.480]  well imagine if farmers in China
[2:27:05.480 --> 2:27:07.480]  farmers in
[2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:09.480]  Africa, farmers in
[2:27:09.480 --> 2:27:11.480]  certainly in the United States
[2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:13.480]  and Canada which is already the case
[2:27:13.480 --> 2:27:15.480]  they become serfs
[2:27:15.480 --> 2:27:17.480]  they become modern day
[2:27:17.480 --> 2:27:19.480]  medieval serfs
[2:27:19.480 --> 2:27:21.480]  enslaved to the seed giants
[2:27:21.480 --> 2:27:23.480]  now you're probably going to get to this
[2:27:23.480 --> 2:27:25.480]  I haven't read your book, I've read one of your other books
[2:27:25.480 --> 2:27:27.480]  and your articles which are excellent
[2:27:27.480 --> 2:27:29.480]  but let me just interrupt and throw this in
[2:27:29.480 --> 2:27:31.480]  I'm sure you're going to get to it, I want you educated
[2:27:31.480 --> 2:27:33.480]  expert opinion, I've had a lot of other folks
[2:27:33.480 --> 2:27:35.480]  about this subject in the last 12 years
[2:27:35.480 --> 2:27:37.480]  is why I'm informed 13 years
[2:27:37.480 --> 2:27:39.480]  but I've confirmed that, I didn't just believe them
[2:27:39.480 --> 2:27:41.480]  that's why I know how real you're saying this is
[2:27:41.480 --> 2:27:43.480]  but we have also caught
[2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:45.480]  these companies
[2:27:45.480 --> 2:27:47.480]  while we know it's a covert government operation
[2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:49.480]  planting
[2:27:49.480 --> 2:27:51.480]  their terminator seeds and others
[2:27:51.480 --> 2:27:53.480]  next to other major growth
[2:27:53.480 --> 2:27:55.480]  belts even in areas where it's
[2:27:55.480 --> 2:27:57.480]  banned to artificially
[2:27:57.480 --> 2:27:59.480]  infect say the soybeans
[2:27:59.480 --> 2:28:01.480]  or the canola or the corn
[2:28:01.480 --> 2:28:03.480]  or the wheat with their genetics
[2:28:03.480 --> 2:28:05.480]  and it's designed to infect
[2:28:05.480 --> 2:28:07.480]  and take over and in replications
[2:28:07.480 --> 2:28:09.480]  basically infest
[2:28:09.480 --> 2:28:11.480]  similar
[2:28:11.480 --> 2:28:13.480]  plant families
[2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:15.480]  to where this is now
[2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:17.480]  spreading into the biosphere
[2:28:17.480 --> 2:28:19.480]  meanwhile the Rockefellers and others
[2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:21.480]  have built giant underground bunkers
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:23.480]  with all the original seeds
[2:28:23.480 --> 2:28:25.480]  this is diabolical
[2:28:25.480 --> 2:28:27.480]  you're talking about the doomsday seed vault
[2:28:27.480 --> 2:28:29.480]  up in Svalbard near the north pole
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:31.480]  that just opened up in
[2:28:31.480 --> 2:28:33.480]  June of this year
[2:28:33.480 --> 2:28:35.480]  with money from the Rockefeller Foundation
[2:28:35.480 --> 2:28:37.480]  the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[2:28:37.480 --> 2:28:39.480]  Singenta, Monsanto
[2:28:39.480 --> 2:28:41.480]  and a few other of these charming
[2:28:41.480 --> 2:28:43.480]  companies and they are the prime movers
[2:28:43.480 --> 2:28:45.480]  whatever the Gates Foundation
[2:28:45.480 --> 2:28:47.480]  Microsoft is just a money collection port
[2:28:47.480 --> 2:28:49.480]  for Planned Parenthood, that's been proven
[2:28:49.480 --> 2:28:51.480]  he's up front, his dad runs it
[2:28:51.480 --> 2:28:53.480]  whatever they're doing
[2:28:53.480 --> 2:28:55.480]  you know that's key, that's the key, go ahead
[2:28:55.480 --> 2:28:57.480]  yeah, follow the money
[2:28:57.480 --> 2:28:59.480]  the Gates Foundation started something
[2:28:59.480 --> 2:29:01.480]  a couple years ago
[2:29:01.480 --> 2:29:03.480]  Kofi Annan was unemployed
[2:29:03.480 --> 2:29:05.480]  as the former secretary general of the UN
[2:29:05.480 --> 2:29:07.480]  he gave him a nice cushy job
[2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:09.480]  as chairman of something called
[2:29:09.480 --> 2:29:11.480]  the African Green Revolution
[2:29:11.480 --> 2:29:13.480]  the African Green Revolution
[2:29:13.480 --> 2:29:15.480]  is nothing less
[2:29:15.480 --> 2:29:17.480]  than an attempt with a lot of Bill Gates money
[2:29:17.480 --> 2:29:19.480]  to convince the governments
[2:29:19.480 --> 2:29:21.480]  of Africa who are highly skeptical
[2:29:21.480 --> 2:29:23.480]  of genetic manipulated seeds
[2:29:23.480 --> 2:29:25.480]  to swallow these seeds
[2:29:25.480 --> 2:29:27.480]  and lock themselves into this seed
[2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:29.480]  slavery of Monsanto
[2:29:29.480 --> 2:29:31.480]  stay there, stay there, but I mean
[2:29:31.480 --> 2:29:33.480]  I know you're going to get into it, but
[2:29:33.480 --> 2:29:35.480]  if you're a slave and you have to keep buying it
[2:29:35.480 --> 2:29:37.480]  and have to use their chemicals
[2:29:37.480 --> 2:29:39.480]  that's just the surface
[2:29:39.480 --> 2:29:41.480]  no, almost every
[2:29:41.480 --> 2:29:43.480]  variant of corn in the world
[2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:45.480]  has now been infected with one Monsanto variant
[2:29:45.480 --> 2:29:47.480]  we'll be right back, stay with
[2:29:47.480 --> 2:29:49.480]  this is vital information
[2:29:49.480 --> 2:29:51.480]  we're on the march
[2:29:51.480 --> 2:29:53.480]  the empires on the run
[2:29:53.480 --> 2:29:55.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:29:59.480 --> 2:30:01.480]  may I have everybody's attention please
[2:30:01.480 --> 2:30:03.480]  I've come with a message of information
[2:30:03.480 --> 2:30:05.480]  9-11 was an inside job
[2:30:05.480 --> 2:30:07.480]  do you like being a puppet sir
[2:30:07.480 --> 2:30:09.480]  do you like being a puppet for the new world order
[2:30:09.480 --> 2:30:11.480]  how do the American people know
[2:30:11.480 --> 2:30:13.480]  that 9-11 was a stage
[2:30:13.480 --> 2:30:15.480]  was engineered by you
[2:30:15.480 --> 2:30:17.480]  David Rockefeller, the fallout or commission
[2:30:17.480 --> 2:30:19.480]  to see far
[2:30:27.480 --> 2:30:29.480]  seven years after the attacks
[2:30:29.480 --> 2:30:31.480]  of September 11, a global awakening
[2:30:31.480 --> 2:30:33.480]  has taken place
[2:30:33.480 --> 2:30:35.480]  an inside job
[2:30:35.480 --> 2:30:37.480]  how dare you
[2:30:39.480 --> 2:30:41.480]  if you know that there's treason going on
[2:30:41.480 --> 2:30:43.480]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself
[2:30:43.480 --> 2:30:45.480]  all hell is breaking loose on
[2:30:45.480 --> 2:30:47.480]  6th avenue
[2:31:01.480 --> 2:31:03.480]  you ever have one of those days where everything
[2:31:03.480 --> 2:31:05.480]  goes right? first I get the best parking
[2:31:05.480 --> 2:31:07.480]  space at work, tonight I
[2:31:07.480 --> 2:31:09.480]  have a date with a very lovely Rachel
[2:31:09.480 --> 2:31:11.480]  and today I gave a killer
[2:31:11.480 --> 2:31:13.480]  presentation in Sydney, finalized
[2:31:13.480 --> 2:31:15.480]  the contract in London
[2:31:15.480 --> 2:31:17.480]  and demoed our new product in Boston
[2:31:17.480 --> 2:31:19.480]  online from my desk with WebEx
[2:31:19.480 --> 2:31:21.480]  WebEx lets me take meetings
[2:31:21.480 --> 2:31:23.480]  and give presentations from my desk
[2:31:23.480 --> 2:31:25.480]  I just talked to clients on the phone
[2:31:25.480 --> 2:31:27.480]  and they watch what's happening on my desktop
[2:31:27.480 --> 2:31:29.480]  from their desktop so I can travel the world
[2:31:29.480 --> 2:31:45.480]  I'll be here for my date tonight with Rachel
[2:32:01.480 --> 2:32:03.480]  cameras are everywhere
[2:32:03.480 --> 2:32:05.480]  above stop lights on toll booths
[2:32:05.480 --> 2:32:07.480]  and scanning the freeways just waiting
[2:32:07.480 --> 2:32:09.480]  to snap a photo of your license plate
[2:32:09.480 --> 2:32:11.480]  only to slam you with ridiculous fines
[2:32:11.480 --> 2:32:13.480]  in California red light tickets are as high
[2:32:13.480 --> 2:32:15.480]  as $400
[2:32:15.480 --> 2:32:17.480]  spray your plate is a spray on photo blocker
[2:32:17.480 --> 2:32:19.480]  that protects against all types of cameras
[2:32:19.480 --> 2:32:21.480]  spray your plate photo blocker spray
[2:32:21.480 --> 2:32:23.480]  reflects and protects against flash photo
[2:32:23.480 --> 2:32:25.480]  images making your plate unreadable
[2:32:25.480 --> 2:32:27.480]  one can of photo blocker will
[2:32:27.480 --> 2:32:29.480]  pay for itself many times over
[2:32:29.480 --> 2:32:31.480]  last forever and is completely undetectable
[2:32:31.480 --> 2:32:33.480]  you cannot afford
[2:32:33.480 --> 2:32:35.480]  to not be protected with spray your plate
[2:32:35.480 --> 2:32:37.480]  photo blocker call 1-800-276-9601

[2:32:59.480 --> 2:33:01.480]  today
[2:33:01.480 --> 2:33:03.480]  well we're already
[2:33:03.480 --> 2:33:05.480]  about 25 minutes into our interview
[2:33:05.480 --> 2:33:07.480]  with William Engdahl
[2:33:07.480 --> 2:33:09.480]  investigative journalist
[2:33:09.480 --> 2:33:11.480]  author, academic researcher
[2:33:11.480 --> 2:33:13.480]  amazing individual
[2:33:15.480 --> 2:33:17.480]  I want to make this clear
[2:33:17.480 --> 2:33:19.480]  GMO was created by the eugenicist
[2:33:19.480 --> 2:33:21.480]  they understand that breeding
[2:33:21.480 --> 2:33:23.480]  needs and animals is key
[2:33:23.480 --> 2:33:25.480]  and they've just conditioned us to announce
[2:33:25.480 --> 2:33:27.480]  hey clone beef on store shelves now
[2:33:27.480 --> 2:33:29.480]  without labels, clone chickens,
[2:33:29.480 --> 2:33:31.480]  clone cows, it's all out there now
[2:33:31.480 --> 2:33:33.480]  it's all been announced
[2:33:33.480 --> 2:33:35.480]  oh we're doing cross species human hybrids
[2:33:35.480 --> 2:33:37.480]  for organ harvesting
[2:33:37.480 --> 2:33:39.480]  but we're keeping them small down at the little
[2:33:39.480 --> 2:33:41.480]  embryo level and then you read deeper in the research
[2:33:41.480 --> 2:33:43.480]  they're not, that's the stuff they admit
[2:33:43.480 --> 2:33:45.480]  splicing humans with pigs
[2:33:45.480 --> 2:33:47.480]  insects
[2:33:47.480 --> 2:33:49.480]  going back 20 years ago they admit
[2:33:49.480 --> 2:33:51.480]  spiders with goats for body armor
[2:33:53.480 --> 2:33:55.480]  it is completely out of control
[2:33:55.480 --> 2:33:57.480]  and I've had all these top genetic engineers
[2:33:57.480 --> 2:33:59.480]  people that were running major companies
[2:33:59.480 --> 2:34:01.480]  making millions a year and they would feed a new potato
[2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:03.480]  with one gene changed
[2:34:03.480 --> 2:34:05.480]  to
[2:34:05.480 --> 2:34:07.480]  the rats and half the rats
[2:34:07.480 --> 2:34:09.480]  would die and then if you kept feeding it
[2:34:09.480 --> 2:34:11.480]  they'd all die
[2:34:11.480 --> 2:34:13.480]  and they'd say we got to tell the public
[2:34:13.480 --> 2:34:15.480]  and they'd say no and then magically
[2:34:15.480 --> 2:34:17.480]  see this is a perfect crime
[2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:19.480]  get this and study this and then do the
[2:34:19.480 --> 2:34:21.480]  multi-million dollar test to see what it does
[2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:23.480]  but when they find out they know what the studies are doing
[2:34:23.480 --> 2:34:25.480]  when other groups
[2:34:25.480 --> 2:34:27.480]  and other institutions study it
[2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:29.480]  they find it sterilizing mammals
[2:34:29.480 --> 2:34:31.480]  it's toxifying them, increasing cancer
[2:34:31.480 --> 2:34:33.480]  they're finding mutations
[2:34:33.480 --> 2:34:35.480]  after gestation
[2:34:35.480 --> 2:34:37.480]  which they'd always thought you got deformities
[2:34:37.480 --> 2:34:39.480]  you know during early embryonic development
[2:34:39.480 --> 2:34:41.480]  but they're finding rats
[2:34:41.480 --> 2:34:43.480]  and guinea pigs and things
[2:34:43.480 --> 2:34:45.480]  are getting
[2:34:45.480 --> 2:34:47.480]  deformed
[2:34:47.480 --> 2:34:49.480]  and having deformities with organs
[2:34:49.480 --> 2:34:51.480]  and things after they're born
[2:34:51.480 --> 2:34:53.480]  I mean this is mega
[2:34:53.480 --> 2:34:55.480]  massive ladies and gentlemen
[2:34:55.480 --> 2:34:57.480]  that's some of the things I wanted to throw out there
[2:34:57.480 --> 2:34:59.480]  because this is so diabolical
[2:34:59.480 --> 2:35:01.480]  I know he says it gets into all that
[2:35:01.480 --> 2:35:03.480]  but I want to get your take on that
[2:35:03.480 --> 2:35:05.480]  so continue walking us through this story
[2:35:05.480 --> 2:35:07.480]  that you cover in your amazing investigative book
[2:35:07.480 --> 2:35:09.480]  sir please continue
[2:35:09.480 --> 2:35:11.480]  let's take the geopolitics a step further in time
[2:35:11.480 --> 2:35:13.480]  and go to the year 1992
[2:35:13.480 --> 2:35:15.480]  some time after this whole
[2:35:15.480 --> 2:35:17.480]  GMO project was started
[2:35:17.480 --> 2:35:19.480]  by the Rockefeller Foundation
[2:35:19.480 --> 2:35:21.480]  and we have a meeting
[2:35:21.480 --> 2:35:23.480]  a closed door White House meeting
[2:35:23.480 --> 2:35:25.480]  unpublicized between
[2:35:25.480 --> 2:35:27.480]  George Herbert Walker Bush
[2:35:27.480 --> 2:35:29.480]  the president at the time
[2:35:29.480 --> 2:35:31.480]  and the chairman, president of Monsanto
[2:35:31.480 --> 2:35:33.480]  in St. Louis
[2:35:33.480 --> 2:35:35.480]  the leading patenter of
[2:35:35.480 --> 2:35:37.480]  genetically modified seeds
[2:35:37.480 --> 2:35:39.480]  and also the chemical herbicides
[2:35:39.480 --> 2:35:41.480]  that are uniquely suited
[2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:43.480]  to those GMO seeds
[2:35:43.480 --> 2:35:45.480]  like round up ready
[2:35:45.480 --> 2:35:47.480]  soybean seeds and round up
[2:35:47.480 --> 2:35:49.480]  herbicide
[2:35:49.480 --> 2:35:51.480]  by Monsanto you have to have both
[2:35:51.480 --> 2:35:53.480]  so anyway Monsanto
[2:35:53.480 --> 2:35:55.480]  sat down with
[2:35:55.480 --> 2:35:57.480]  Papa Bush in 1992
[2:35:57.480 --> 2:35:59.480]  and said look
[2:35:59.480 --> 2:36:01.480]  this can be a huge
[2:36:01.480 --> 2:36:03.480]  this was the public version of what they said
[2:36:03.480 --> 2:36:05.480]  imagine what they said in private
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:07.480]  this can be a huge boon
[2:36:07.480 --> 2:36:09.480]  a new growth area for the US economy
[2:36:09.480 --> 2:36:11.480]  biotechnology
[2:36:11.480 --> 2:36:13.480]  genetically modified seeds and so forth
[2:36:13.480 --> 2:36:15.480]  but in order for the private sector
[2:36:15.480 --> 2:36:17.480]  to really do its stuff
[2:36:17.480 --> 2:36:19.480]  we need to be free
[2:36:19.480 --> 2:36:21.480]  to be creative
[2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:23.480]  free from government to meddling
[2:36:23.480 --> 2:36:25.480]  so Papa Bush
[2:36:25.480 --> 2:36:27.480]  signed an executive order
[2:36:27.480 --> 2:36:29.480]  that is called the substantial
[2:36:29.480 --> 2:36:31.480]  equivalence order
[2:36:31.480 --> 2:36:33.480]  now listeners should write that down
[2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:35.480]  and study that word and look it up under google
[2:36:35.480 --> 2:36:37.480]  because it's worth looking
[2:36:37.480 --> 2:36:39.480]  at the substantial equivalent
[2:36:39.480 --> 2:36:41.480]  means according to Bush
[2:36:41.480 --> 2:36:43.480]  according to this executive department order in 1992
[2:36:43.480 --> 2:36:45.480]  that GMO corn
[2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:47.480]  or GMO soybean
[2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:49.480]  is to henceforth be treated
[2:36:49.480 --> 2:36:51.480]  as substantially equivalent
[2:36:51.480 --> 2:36:53.480]  to a normal ear of corn
[2:36:53.480 --> 2:36:55.480]  or a normal
[2:36:55.480 --> 2:36:57.480]  sprout of soybean
[2:36:57.480 --> 2:36:59.480]  so they wave a magic wand
[2:36:59.480 --> 2:37:01.480]  no more testing, no more nothing
[2:37:01.480 --> 2:37:03.480]  put whatever you want on their plates
[2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:05.480]  and other animal, insect, plant
[2:37:05.480 --> 2:37:07.480]  I'm the judge jury
[2:37:07.480 --> 2:37:09.480]  I'm now the EPA and the FDA
[2:37:09.480 --> 2:37:11.480]  I wave a wand
[2:37:11.480 --> 2:37:13.480]  the EPA and the FDA then was
[2:37:13.480 --> 2:37:15.480]  staffed by Monsanto people
[2:37:15.480 --> 2:37:17.480]  or people from Dupont and Dow
[2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:19.480]  in a revolving door system
[2:37:19.480 --> 2:37:21.480]  and they would write the rules for the EPA
[2:37:21.480 --> 2:37:23.480]  the EPA would accept
[2:37:23.480 --> 2:37:25.480]  the tests of Monsanto as
[2:37:25.480 --> 2:37:27.480]  Bible truth
[2:37:27.480 --> 2:37:29.480]  and never second-guess them
[2:37:29.480 --> 2:37:31.480]  I mean the criminal conflict
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:33.480]  of interest here is just staggering
[2:37:33.480 --> 2:37:35.480]  well we have a food and drug
[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:37.480]  administration that is mandated
[2:37:37.480 --> 2:37:39.480]  to protect the food
[2:37:39.480 --> 2:37:41.480]  and health of the American people
[2:37:41.480 --> 2:37:43.480]  well guess again ladies and gentlemen
[2:37:43.480 --> 2:37:45.480]  they aren't doing that in Washington since
[2:37:45.480 --> 2:37:47.480]  at least 1992
[2:37:47.480 --> 2:37:49.480]  briefly I just want to add this and I'm going to try to let you guys
[2:37:49.480 --> 2:37:51.480]  just so much I want to back up
[2:37:51.480 --> 2:37:53.480]  remember the different university studies
[2:37:53.480 --> 2:37:55.480]  they did in the US and Europe
[2:37:55.480 --> 2:37:57.480]  where they found that if an authority figure
[2:37:57.480 --> 2:37:59.480]  said kill one in a
[2:37:59.480 --> 2:38:01.480]  test they thought
[2:38:01.480 --> 2:38:03.480]  they were really killing people
[2:38:03.480 --> 2:38:05.480]  90 plus percent of the time they would commit the murder
[2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:07.480]  just because an authority figure
[2:38:07.480 --> 2:38:09.480]  told them it was okay to do
[2:38:09.480 --> 2:38:11.480]  in a university study remember the
[2:38:11.480 --> 2:38:13.480]  electroshocks it's the same thing
[2:38:13.480 --> 2:38:15.480]  the president says no more
[2:38:15.480 --> 2:38:17.480]  restrictions no more testing
[2:38:17.480 --> 2:38:19.480]  they would then follow the orders even though
[2:38:19.480 --> 2:38:21.480]  whistleblowers came out and said this is deadly
[2:38:21.480 --> 2:38:23.480]  this is going to kill people they just said
[2:38:23.480 --> 2:38:25.480]  nope the president says it's good
[2:38:25.480 --> 2:38:27.480]  well one of the most
[2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:29.480]  famous cases of whistleblowers
[2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:31.480]  is a
[2:38:31.480 --> 2:38:33.480]  dear friend of mine
[2:38:33.480 --> 2:38:35.480]  Dr. Arpad Pusta
[2:38:35.480 --> 2:38:37.480]  he was interviewed in Scotland
[2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:39.480]  and he was fired from
[2:38:39.480 --> 2:38:41.480]  Rowett Research Institute at the time
[2:38:41.480 --> 2:38:43.480]  1997 he was the world's leading
[2:38:43.480 --> 2:38:45.480]  GMO researcher and thought
[2:38:45.480 --> 2:38:47.480]  it was a positive boon for mankind
[2:38:47.480 --> 2:38:49.480]  a solution to world hunger
[2:38:49.480 --> 2:38:51.480]  and he did exactly the kind of research
[2:38:51.480 --> 2:38:53.480]  you're talking about with laboratory rats
[2:38:53.480 --> 2:38:55.480]  and potatoes
[2:38:55.480 --> 2:38:57.480]  and this man is no amateur
[2:38:57.480 --> 2:38:59.480]  and highly highly
[2:38:59.480 --> 2:39:01.480]  informed
[2:39:01.480 --> 2:39:03.480]  and careful scientist
[2:39:03.480 --> 2:39:05.480]  and he found that the brains
[2:39:05.480 --> 2:39:07.480]  the inner organs of the rats
[2:39:07.480 --> 2:39:09.480]  fed on GMO potatoes
[2:39:09.480 --> 2:39:11.480]  diet for more than three months
[2:39:11.480 --> 2:39:13.480]  were dramatically shrunken
[2:39:13.480 --> 2:39:15.480]  and he told his boss
[2:39:15.480 --> 2:39:17.480]  and said we have to
[2:39:17.480 --> 2:39:19.480]  sound the alarm on this they went on channel 4
[2:39:19.480 --> 2:39:21.480]  prominent British television channel
[2:39:21.480 --> 2:39:23.480]  it was picked up all around the world for 72 hours
[2:39:23.480 --> 2:39:25.480]  and then suddenly
[2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:27.480]  dead in the water you never heard another word about
[2:39:27.480 --> 2:39:29.480]  and they fired him
[2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:31.480]  thank god for him blowing the whistle
[2:39:31.480 --> 2:39:33.480]  I interviewed him several times
[2:39:33.480 --> 2:39:35.480]  I dropped out of touch with him
[2:39:35.480 --> 2:39:37.480]  I need to get his number again
[2:39:37.480 --> 2:39:39.480]  we had a computer fail I need to get him back on
[2:39:39.480 --> 2:39:41.480]  but go ahead
[2:39:41.480 --> 2:39:43.480]  yeah definitely he's more than willing to
[2:39:43.480 --> 2:39:45.480]  to talk about these dangers
[2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:47.480]  but as he puts it basically the British government
[2:39:47.480 --> 2:39:49.480]  was willing to make
[2:39:49.480 --> 2:39:51.480]  the population human guinea pigs
[2:39:51.480 --> 2:39:53.480]  and something that should be
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:39:55.480]  minimum 20
[2:39:55.480 --> 2:39:57.480]  or more years of long term
[2:39:57.480 --> 2:39:59.480]  totally controlled animal studies
[2:39:59.480 --> 2:40:01.480]  before the genie is released
[2:40:01.480 --> 2:40:03.480]  and set forth on the human guinea pig
[2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:05.480]  and by the way you just glazed over that it did a lot more of the rats
[2:40:05.480 --> 2:40:07.480]  it caused the bizarre after birth
[2:40:07.480 --> 2:40:09.480]  deformity it caused them to have
[2:40:09.480 --> 2:40:11.480]  intestinal tumors all sorts of medical problems
[2:40:11.480 --> 2:40:13.480]  these were some other experiments
[2:40:13.480 --> 2:40:15.480]  so far as I know but
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:17.480]  yeah well on my show he was covering the other experiments
[2:40:17.480 --> 2:40:19.480]  that I learned yeah yeah
[2:40:19.480 --> 2:40:21.480]  yeah
[2:40:21.480 --> 2:40:23.480]  in other words
[2:40:23.480 --> 2:40:25.480]  it's highly unstable
[2:40:25.480 --> 2:40:27.480]  as Dr. Bustai repeatedly points out
[2:40:27.480 --> 2:40:29.480]  this is not some
[2:40:29.480 --> 2:40:31.480]  stable alteration it's not like
[2:40:31.480 --> 2:40:33.480]  hybrid corn where you breed
[2:40:33.480 --> 2:40:35.480]  two strains of corn
[2:40:35.480 --> 2:40:37.480]  for weather resistance
[2:40:37.480 --> 2:40:39.480]  this is introducing
[2:40:39.480 --> 2:40:41.480]  foreign genetic material this is
[2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:43.480]  unnatural alteration of the DNA
[2:40:43.480 --> 2:40:45.480]  but that's what Rush Limbaugh does
[2:40:45.480 --> 2:40:47.480]  and he goes on and he says
[2:40:47.480 --> 2:40:49.480]  when you breed two dogs
[2:40:49.480 --> 2:40:51.480]  that's genetic engineering
[2:40:51.480 --> 2:40:53.480]  when you cross the corn like
[2:40:53.480 --> 2:40:55.480]  George Washington Carver
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:40:57.480]  but that's natural breeding
[2:40:57.480 --> 2:40:59.480]  that's how things naturally mixed
[2:40:59.480 --> 2:41:01.480]  in the wild it's the same species
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:03.480]  it's not with a gene gun
[2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:05.480]  firing reptile genetics
[2:41:05.480 --> 2:41:07.480]  into a salmon gene
[2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:09.480]  and then putting that in corn
[2:41:09.480 --> 2:41:11.480]  yeah yeah
[2:41:11.480 --> 2:41:13.480]  well let me give another example
[2:41:13.480 --> 2:41:15.480]  which is I think one of the
[2:41:15.480 --> 2:41:17.480]  emblematic examples
[2:41:17.480 --> 2:41:19.480]  in 2001
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:21.480]  a small San Diego biotech company
[2:41:21.480 --> 2:41:23.480]  called Epicit maybe you've heard of it
[2:41:23.480 --> 2:41:25.480]  a few people have Epicit
[2:41:25.480 --> 2:41:27.480]  the president of Epicit
[2:41:27.480 --> 2:41:29.480]  gave a press conference he was just as
[2:41:29.480 --> 2:41:31.480]  pleased as punched to announces to the world
[2:41:31.480 --> 2:41:33.480]  and he said
[2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:35.480]  back behind me we have a greenhouse
[2:41:35.480 --> 2:41:37.480]  full of
[2:41:37.480 --> 2:41:39.480]  spermacidal corn
[2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:41.480]  that is corn genetically modified
[2:41:41.480 --> 2:41:43.480]  so that men this is not animals
[2:41:43.480 --> 2:41:45.480]  men who eat this corn
[2:41:45.480 --> 2:41:47.480]  will become sterile
[2:41:47.480 --> 2:41:49.480]  and it's a spermicide it kills
[2:41:49.480 --> 2:41:51.480]  sperm and
[2:41:51.480 --> 2:41:53.480]  he said this is a solution to the world
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:55.480]  population problem
[2:41:55.480 --> 2:41:57.480]  now if you live
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:41:59.480]  in Mexico you know how
[2:41:59.480 --> 2:42:01.480]  or if you even travel through Mexico
[2:42:01.480 --> 2:42:03.480]  and Central America so you know that corn
[2:42:03.480 --> 2:42:05.480]  is a staple of the present diet
[2:42:05.480 --> 2:42:07.480]  and that's going to jump
[2:42:07.480 --> 2:42:09.480]  into other corn open air
[2:42:09.480 --> 2:42:11.480]  planted just like prote gene
[2:42:11.480 --> 2:42:13.480]  with the AIDS virus
[2:42:13.480 --> 2:42:15.480]  so that's going to go
[2:42:15.480 --> 2:42:17.480]  back in the corn
[2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:19.480]  and then that happened eight years ago
[2:42:19.480 --> 2:42:21.480]  and was quietly covered up
[2:42:21.480 --> 2:42:23.480]  unbelievable
[2:42:23.480 --> 2:42:25.480]  well
[2:42:25.480 --> 2:42:27.480]  as one
[2:42:27.480 --> 2:42:29.480]  scientist from Stanford
[2:42:29.480 --> 2:42:31.480]  universities put it
[2:42:31.480 --> 2:42:33.480]  you would think that
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:35.480]  no one in their right mind would do something like this
[2:42:35.480 --> 2:42:37.480]  but as he put it and he worked on the Jason project
[2:42:37.480 --> 2:42:39.480]  with the Pentagon as a biologist and so forth
[2:42:39.480 --> 2:42:41.480]  so he knew a little bit the inside story
[2:42:41.480 --> 2:42:43.480]  not everybody is in their right mind
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:45.480]  and that I think
[2:42:45.480 --> 2:42:47.480]  sums it up there are people
[2:42:47.480 --> 2:42:49.480]  in a power elite they
[2:42:49.480 --> 2:42:51.480]  for them power is a
[2:42:51.480 --> 2:42:53.480]  self-feeding aphrodisiac of some
[2:42:53.480 --> 2:42:55.480]  perverse sort that I don't fully understand but
[2:42:55.480 --> 2:42:57.480]  they are different from ordinary
[2:42:57.480 --> 2:42:59.480]  human beings and they just
[2:42:59.480 --> 2:43:01.480]  human life is for them
[2:43:01.480 --> 2:43:03.480]  simply an externality as long as they and
[2:43:03.480 --> 2:43:05.480]  their
[2:43:05.480 --> 2:43:07.480]  their friends are provided for as they
[2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:09.480]  see fit than the rest of the human
[2:43:09.480 --> 2:43:11.480]  species well I agree
[2:43:11.480 --> 2:43:13.480]  I agree but it's worse than that a lot of
[2:43:13.480 --> 2:43:15.480]  top futures top globalists have written
[2:43:15.480 --> 2:43:17.480]  and history shows it with Nero
[2:43:17.480 --> 2:43:19.480]  and you know the craziness
[2:43:19.480 --> 2:43:21.480]  Vlad the Impaler
[2:43:21.480 --> 2:43:23.480]  they go crazy and
[2:43:23.480 --> 2:43:25.480]  they become nihilistic
[2:43:25.480 --> 2:43:27.480]  and self-destructive
[2:43:27.480 --> 2:43:29.480]  and so you hear them writing about it
[2:43:29.480 --> 2:43:31.480]  even the people at Hadron
[2:43:31.480 --> 2:43:33.480]  are saying well there's a small chance of
[2:43:33.480 --> 2:43:35.480]  destroy the earth but we don't care and they put
[2:43:35.480 --> 2:43:37.480]  the death god Shiva above it
[2:43:37.480 --> 2:43:39.480]  or you talk to these geneticists and they go
[2:43:39.480 --> 2:43:41.480]  so what so if we make something
[2:43:41.480 --> 2:43:43.480]  that takes over the planet that's regular evolution
[2:43:43.480 --> 2:43:45.480]  because we evolved and did it
[2:43:45.480 --> 2:43:47.480]  and it's so what if it kills us all we need to be
[2:43:47.480 --> 2:43:49.480]  killed I mean these are maniacs
[2:43:49.480 --> 2:43:51.480]  and they get off on like
[2:43:51.480 --> 2:43:53.480]  driving a car at 100 miles an hour
[2:43:53.480 --> 2:43:55.480]  around jagged turns
[2:43:55.480 --> 2:43:57.480]  a lot of Hollywood folks do stuff like that and get killed
[2:43:57.480 --> 2:43:59.480]  like James Dean it is
[2:43:59.480 --> 2:44:01.480]  just a complete mania
[2:44:01.480 --> 2:44:03.480]  yep yep
[2:44:03.480 --> 2:44:05.480]  and
[2:44:05.480 --> 2:44:07.480]  now go back a little bit to the
[2:44:07.480 --> 2:44:09.480]  1950s because
[2:44:09.480 --> 2:44:11.480]  the Rockefeller Foundation
[2:44:11.480 --> 2:44:13.480]  again was behind this project
[2:44:13.480 --> 2:44:15.480]  called the agribusiness project
[2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:17.480]  of the Harvard Business School
[2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:19.480]  John W. Davis who was a former assistant
[2:44:19.480 --> 2:44:21.480]  agriculture secretary under Eisenhower
[2:44:21.480 --> 2:44:23.480]  Ray Goldberg who
[2:44:23.480 --> 2:44:25.480]  still kicking at age 91 and sits on the
[2:44:25.480 --> 2:44:27.480]  board of several GMO companies
[2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:29.480]  Goldberg and Davis
[2:44:29.480 --> 2:44:31.480]  created something called agribusiness
[2:44:31.480 --> 2:44:33.480]  they invented the term
[2:44:33.480 --> 2:44:35.480]  and what their goal was
[2:44:35.480 --> 2:44:37.480]  was to vertically integrate
[2:44:37.480 --> 2:44:39.480]  the entire food production
[2:44:39.480 --> 2:44:41.480]  distribution processing
[2:44:41.480 --> 2:44:43.480]  and distribution into
[2:44:43.480 --> 2:44:45.480]  a mega industry
[2:44:45.480 --> 2:44:47.480]  globalized first in the United States
[2:44:47.480 --> 2:44:49.480]  and then globalized in the last 15-20 years
[2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:51.480]  and
[2:44:51.480 --> 2:44:53.480]  in doing so and then adding as
[2:44:53.480 --> 2:44:55.480]  the icing on the cake
[2:44:55.480 --> 2:44:57.480]  patented seeds GMO
[2:44:57.480 --> 2:44:59.480]  seeds and in a few years
[2:44:59.480 --> 2:45:01.480]  there'll be seeds secretly filled with
[2:45:01.480 --> 2:45:03.480]  a terminator
[2:45:03.480 --> 2:45:05.480]  ostensibly to protect patent rights
[2:45:05.480 --> 2:45:07.480]  of Monsanto et al
[2:45:07.480 --> 2:45:09.480]  they will have control
[2:45:09.480 --> 2:45:11.480]  and they will be able in a military
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:13.480]  sense to exercise strategic denial
[2:45:13.480 --> 2:45:15.480]  if a country like
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:17.480]  Iraq or Iran
[2:45:17.480 --> 2:45:19.480]  or Zimbabwe
[2:45:19.480 --> 2:45:21.480]  or any other
[2:45:21.480 --> 2:45:23.480]  priority hate object
[2:45:23.480 --> 2:45:25.480]  of a particular Washington government
[2:45:25.480 --> 2:45:27.480]  God forbid that we would ever have a
[2:45:27.480 --> 2:45:29.480]  government which doesn't exercise
[2:45:29.480 --> 2:45:31.480]  justice in Washington
[2:45:31.480 --> 2:45:33.480]  but in case that were to happen
[2:45:33.480 --> 2:45:35.480]  and they would simply
[2:45:35.480 --> 2:45:37.480]  say okay Monsanto cut off
[2:45:37.480 --> 2:45:39.480]  the seed supply of Zimbabwe
[2:45:39.480 --> 2:45:41.480]  cut off the seed supply of China
[2:45:41.480 --> 2:45:43.480]  cut off the seed supply of Azerbaijan
[2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:45.480]  and they've been running around
[2:45:45.480 --> 2:45:47.480]  grabbing up paying 10 times what it's worth
[2:45:47.480 --> 2:45:49.480]  in one case I saw for heirloom seed
[2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:51.480]  companies they've bought up almost all of them
[2:45:51.480 --> 2:45:53.480]  and they hoard the seeds, shut them
[2:45:53.480 --> 2:45:55.480]  off, no longer sell them
[2:45:55.480 --> 2:45:57.480]  let those seed lines die in the public
[2:45:57.480 --> 2:45:59.480]  domain and then in places like
[2:45:59.480 --> 2:46:01.480]  Iraq where they have captured clients
[2:46:01.480 --> 2:46:03.480]  they're forcing total conversion
[2:46:03.480 --> 2:46:05.480]  over to the GMO
[2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:07.480]  and then it's jumping
[2:46:07.480 --> 2:46:09.480]  in to all of
[2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:11.480]  its natural
[2:46:11.480 --> 2:46:13.480]  naturally occurring variance
[2:46:13.480 --> 2:46:15.480]  well Iraq is
[2:46:15.480 --> 2:46:17.480]  a particularly strategic
[2:46:17.480 --> 2:46:19.480]  area because
[2:46:19.480 --> 2:46:21.480]  Iraq is the
[2:46:21.480 --> 2:46:23.480]  ancient biblical Mesopotamia the cradle of
[2:46:23.480 --> 2:46:25.480]  civilization the
[2:46:25.480 --> 2:46:27.480]  between the Tigris and Euphrates was
[2:46:27.480 --> 2:46:29.480]  the first cultivation
[2:46:29.480 --> 2:46:31.480]  of wheat
[2:46:31.480 --> 2:46:33.480]  and they have more
[2:46:33.480 --> 2:46:35.480]  wheat varieties
[2:46:35.480 --> 2:46:37.480]  in a seed bank in Iraq
[2:46:37.480 --> 2:46:39.480]  before the last war
[2:46:39.480 --> 2:46:41.480]  not for long
[2:46:41.480 --> 2:46:43.480]  the seed bank disappeared
[2:46:43.480 --> 2:46:45.480]  it happened to be in a place called Abu Ghraib
[2:46:45.480 --> 2:46:47.480]  some of your listeners
[2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:49.480]  might have heard of that
[2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:51.480]  and it utterly disappeared off the face of Iraq
[2:46:51.480 --> 2:46:53.480]  now a death dungeon
[2:46:53.480 --> 2:46:55.480]  so
[2:46:55.480 --> 2:46:57.480]  that's the kind of thing
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:46:59.480]  and then you have Bill Gates foundation
[2:46:59.480 --> 2:47:01.480]  and
[2:47:01.480 --> 2:47:03.480]  Rockefeller and Monsanto building
[2:47:03.480 --> 2:47:05.480]  the doomsday seed vault
[2:47:05.480 --> 2:47:07.480]  impermeable to nuclear attack
[2:47:07.480 --> 2:47:09.480]  or any other kind of
[2:47:09.480 --> 2:47:11.480]  natural or man-made disaster
[2:47:11.480 --> 2:47:13.480]  up there in the North Sea
[2:47:13.480 --> 2:47:15.480]  in the North Pole
[2:47:15.480 --> 2:47:17.480]  they know what they're doing and in fact a Monsanto
[2:47:17.480 --> 2:47:19.480]  executive what nine years ago was actually
[2:47:19.480 --> 2:47:21.480]  even in the big eugenics publication
[2:47:21.480 --> 2:47:23.480]  on the front national geographic
[2:47:23.480 --> 2:47:25.480]  but they even admitted there they had the quote
[2:47:25.480 --> 2:47:27.480]  to paraphrase well we're just going to infect
[2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:29.480]  everything with our genetics
[2:47:29.480 --> 2:47:31.480]  and then use courts to basically take over
[2:47:31.480 --> 2:47:33.480]  those companies and that's what they do
[2:47:33.480 --> 2:47:35.480]  they infect you and then charge you
[2:47:35.480 --> 2:47:37.480]  for having their genetics
[2:47:37.480 --> 2:47:39.480]  yeah
[2:47:39.480 --> 2:47:41.480]  yeah
[2:47:41.480 --> 2:47:43.480]  this is
[2:47:43.480 --> 2:47:45.480]  it's control it's about
[2:47:45.480 --> 2:47:47.480]  total control full spectrum dominance
[2:47:47.480 --> 2:47:49.480]  is the military side of it
[2:47:49.480 --> 2:47:51.480]  the next book that I'm publishing
[2:47:51.480 --> 2:47:53.480]  but the control over
[2:47:53.480 --> 2:47:55.480]  the food you control the people
[2:47:55.480 --> 2:47:57.480]  is just said well I want you to hit the key
[2:47:57.480 --> 2:47:59.480]  points but right now global research
[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:01.480]  great folks Michelle Chassadowski they
[2:48:01.480 --> 2:48:03.480]  published your book by the way I want to
[2:48:03.480 --> 2:48:05.480]  carry it I just got so busy I haven't bought it
[2:48:05.480 --> 2:48:07.480]  and bolt from them I haven't read it yet but
[2:48:07.480 --> 2:48:09.480]  I'm sure it's excellent I carry some other
[2:48:09.480 --> 2:48:11.480]  well I think I think your readers would find
[2:48:11.480 --> 2:48:13.480]  it more than worthwhile and I
[2:48:13.480 --> 2:48:15.480]  would be very happy to have you well we do
[2:48:15.480 --> 2:48:17.480]  carry some books on GMO
[2:48:17.480 --> 2:48:19.480]  by some other great scholars but this guy's dead
[2:48:19.480 --> 2:48:21.480]  on great researcher but he's good on
[2:48:21.480 --> 2:48:23.480]  the full spectrum speaking of that term
[2:48:23.480 --> 2:48:25.480]  other guys we have on seem to be specialists you seem to be
[2:48:25.480 --> 2:48:27.480]  somewhat of a generalist but also with a lot
[2:48:27.480 --> 2:48:29.480]  of detailed knowledge in each area that's what I
[2:48:29.480 --> 2:48:31.480]  do but yeah give out the
[2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:33.480]  phone number give out the website tell folks about the book
[2:48:33.480 --> 2:48:35.480]  okay the book is available
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:37.480]  through global research
[2:48:37.480 --> 2:48:39.480]  www.globalresearch.ca
[2:48:39.480 --> 2:48:41.480]  for Canada
[2:48:41.480 --> 2:48:43.480]  the book is called seeds of destruction
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:45.480]  the hidden
[2:48:45.480 --> 2:48:47.480]  agenda of genetic manipulation
[2:48:47.480 --> 2:48:49.480]  F William Engdahl
[2:48:49.480 --> 2:48:51.480]  and it's available
[2:48:51.480 --> 2:48:53.480]  I don't have the current price
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:48:55.480]  in mind but if you go direct
[2:48:55.480 --> 2:48:57.480]  to the publisher the
[2:48:57.480 --> 2:48:59.480]  published USA prices 2495
[2:48:59.480 --> 2:49:01.480]  and
[2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:03.480]  if you go direct to the publisher you get this
[2:49:03.480 --> 2:49:05.480]  as I believe a discount on that
[2:49:05.480 --> 2:49:07.480]  now do you have a personal side or you just
[2:49:07.480 --> 2:49:09.480]  write for them I know no no no
[2:49:09.480 --> 2:49:11.480]  I have a personal side I write
[2:49:11.480 --> 2:49:13.480]  worldwide my writings
[2:49:13.480 --> 2:49:15.480]  are picked up in give out the site because I see
[2:49:15.480 --> 2:49:17.480]  so many sites with you on it I'm not sure
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:19.480]  which one you plug my personal
[2:49:19.480 --> 2:49:21.480]  site which is
[2:49:21.480 --> 2:49:23.480]  a compilation of all languages
[2:49:23.480 --> 2:49:25.480]  of my
[2:49:25.480 --> 2:49:27.480]  writings and so forth is

[2:49:35.480 --> 2:49:37.480] .net that's right we plugged
[2:49:37.480 --> 2:49:39.480]  that last week and we'll put that up
[2:49:39.480 --> 2:49:41.480]  on a screen for folks give that out one
[2:49:41.480 --> 2:49:43.480]  more time okay
[2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:45.480]  www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics

[2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:51.480]  www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics
[2:49:51.480 --> 2:49:53.480]  I'm gonna skip
[2:49:53.480 --> 2:49:55.480]  this break for the
[2:49:55.480 --> 2:49:57.480]  infowarres.com stream
[2:49:57.480 --> 2:49:59.480]  listeners
[2:49:59.480 --> 2:50:01.480]  and prisonplanet.TV viewers
[2:50:01.480 --> 2:50:03.480]  everybody else we back in three minutes
[2:50:03.480 --> 2:50:05.480]  but I can't waste any time on this subject it's so
[2:50:05.480 --> 2:50:07.480]  important when we come back
[2:50:07.480 --> 2:50:09.480]  though we're gonna talk about
[2:50:09.480 --> 2:50:12.520]  We want a major victory.
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:15.200]  We can defeat these people.
[2:50:15.200 --> 2:50:17.760]  But then they came in with a counter-strike.
[2:50:17.760 --> 2:50:19.000]  So that's the moral of the story.
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:20.480]  The fight goes on.
[2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:22.120]  It's the long march.
[2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:24.760]  It's the going the distance that matters.
[2:50:24.760 --> 2:50:26.760]  Stay with us.
[2:50:26.760 --> 2:50:29.240]  Okay, William.
[2:50:29.240 --> 2:50:31.240]  A day unlike any other in the long run.
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:33.560]  I'm going to go back to him, John.
[2:50:33.560 --> 2:50:34.560]  I'm going to go back to him.
[2:50:34.560 --> 2:50:35.720]  I'm going to skip this break.
[2:50:35.720 --> 2:50:38.080]  William, this is so important.
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:39.720]  If you can't do it, it's fine.
[2:50:39.720 --> 2:50:44.560]  I want to move Bob Chapman when he calls in 10 minutes back about 15, because I want
[2:50:44.560 --> 2:50:48.120]  to finish this up, and I've been adding a lot, but I know he's got more he wants to
[2:50:48.120 --> 2:50:49.120]  add.
[2:50:49.120 --> 2:50:54.000]  Okay, we can go to a few minutes after the hour if that's okay.
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:57.920]  I know your back gets to you.
[2:50:57.920 --> 2:50:59.440]  How far do you want to go?
[2:50:59.440 --> 2:51:01.760]  Five minutes after the hour would be fine.
[2:51:01.760 --> 2:51:05.760]  Okay, and then we'll do in a few weeks when your book comes out the full spectrum dominance
[2:51:05.760 --> 2:51:06.760]  discussion.
[2:51:06.760 --> 2:51:07.760]  That'd be excellent.
[2:51:07.760 --> 2:51:10.480]  Okay, well, when Chapman calls, just tell him to stay on hold then.
[2:51:10.480 --> 2:51:15.040]  Okay, that's fantastic, and I really want to, I appreciate your scholarly work and your
[2:51:15.040 --> 2:51:16.040]  research.
[2:51:16.040 --> 2:51:17.680]  I look forward to that.
[2:51:17.680 --> 2:51:20.680]  Do you ever come to the United States?
[2:51:20.680 --> 2:51:21.680]  Sell them.
[2:51:21.680 --> 2:51:25.840]  It's a physically exhausting trip, and I sell them to get there.
[2:51:25.840 --> 2:51:26.840]  I understand.
[2:51:26.840 --> 2:51:30.720]  I would like to, maybe we'll pay for a satellite uplink and do it.
[2:51:30.720 --> 2:51:34.760]  I would like to interview you for another, I'm going to make a, you haven't seen my film
[2:51:34.760 --> 2:51:35.760]  Endgame.
[2:51:35.760 --> 2:51:39.360]  I'm going to make a similar film, it won't be Endgame, about all this, and it'll reach
[2:51:39.360 --> 2:51:40.480]  millions of people.
[2:51:40.480 --> 2:51:47.120]  I would like to interview you and others for that film coming up in the next year.
[2:51:47.120 --> 2:51:48.120]  Okay.
[2:51:48.120 --> 2:51:55.840]  I'm sure we can find some electronic, I do it with the Russian TV, with Chinese media,
[2:51:55.840 --> 2:52:00.040]  all sorts of places all over the world, so I'm sure we can figure out something.
[2:52:00.040 --> 2:52:01.040]  Absolutely.
[2:52:01.040 --> 2:52:04.920]  I'll get you in the chair over there, and we'll do that interview that way.
[2:52:04.920 --> 2:52:05.920]  That's absolutely fabulous.
[2:52:05.920 --> 2:52:08.880]  Yeah, I've got a couple of satellite uplink places right down the street.
[2:52:08.880 --> 2:52:14.840]  I was just in one for press TV for an hour yesterday, and I've done, I do Russia today
[2:52:14.840 --> 2:52:16.760]  as well.
[2:52:16.760 --> 2:52:18.480]  And in fact, that's where we learned about you.
[2:52:18.480 --> 2:52:21.120]  I'd seen your articles, but hadn't put two of them together.
[2:52:21.120 --> 2:52:24.280]  When I saw you on Russia today, that was good.
[2:52:24.280 --> 2:52:25.280]  Russia today.
[2:52:25.280 --> 2:52:26.760]  Oh, Johnson's?
[2:52:26.760 --> 2:52:31.040]  Well, you may not have, it was a phone interview, but you were on Russia today.
[2:52:31.040 --> 2:52:32.040]  I saw one.
[2:52:32.040 --> 2:52:33.040]  Okay.
[2:52:33.040 --> 2:52:37.320]  It was a phone interview with Real News, I think it was, on Georgia about three, four
[2:52:37.320 --> 2:52:38.320]  weeks ago.
[2:52:38.320 --> 2:52:41.240]  Yeah, well, they must have picked a clip up of it and put it on Russia today.
[2:52:41.240 --> 2:52:42.560]  Okay, that can be.
[2:52:42.560 --> 2:52:44.800]  Yeah, they tend to do that.
[2:52:44.800 --> 2:52:47.200]  Okay, well, that's fantastic.
[2:52:47.200 --> 2:52:50.160]  We're going to go live right now, and I want to talk about some of the victories we've
[2:52:50.160 --> 2:52:54.320]  had, and then I'm just going to give you the floor the last five minutes, other, you know,
[2:52:54.320 --> 2:52:57.440]  hitting key points here for the listeners.
[2:52:57.440 --> 2:52:58.840]  Are you enjoying the radio interview?
[2:52:58.840 --> 2:52:59.840]  Oh, very much.
[2:52:59.840 --> 2:53:00.840]  Very much.
[2:53:00.840 --> 2:53:01.840]  Well, we really appreciate you.
[2:53:01.840 --> 2:53:07.360]  It's so hard to grasp how, just how big and evil this is, just how real it is.
[2:53:07.360 --> 2:53:08.360]  It's so diabolical.
[2:53:08.360 --> 2:53:12.720]  It's like, it's like a, it's like a comic book or something with what the evil mastermind
[2:53:12.720 --> 2:53:13.720]  comes up with.
[2:53:13.720 --> 2:53:14.720]  Okay, here we go.
[2:53:14.720 --> 2:53:18.600]  I hope that you'll join me in this new sense of American security.
[2:53:18.600 --> 2:53:27.040]  Call eFoodsDirect.com, that's eFoodsDirect.com, or 1-800-409-5633, that's 800-409-5633.
[2:53:27.040 --> 2:53:31.240]  Call them today, you'll be glad you did.
[2:53:31.240 --> 2:53:33.640]  The American people are the guinea pigs.
[2:53:33.640 --> 2:53:34.640]  It's all tested here.
[2:53:34.640 --> 2:53:41.080]  There's the fluoridation of water, the mercury in vaccines, the sterilization.
[2:53:41.080 --> 2:53:46.560]  The Rockefellers really got their power, 30-plus states had four sterilization laws.
[2:53:46.560 --> 2:53:50.660]  They carry out their eugenics operations, they founded the human genome project, their
[2:53:50.660 --> 2:53:56.480]  head scientist saying blacks weren't human a few months ago, had to step down Dr. Watson.
[2:53:56.480 --> 2:54:01.040]  This is what they're up to, and they're playing God, and they are intelligent.
[2:54:01.040 --> 2:54:05.280]  They do have a lot of foresight, but when the people said no to human growth hormone
[2:54:05.280 --> 2:54:09.320]  in the milk, they just passed laws where you basically can't label it.
[2:54:09.320 --> 2:54:13.600]  Or when the people said we want organic food and started buying it, they just passed a
[2:54:13.600 --> 2:54:20.880]  law saying it can be 75% inorganic, genetically spliced, and they'll call it organic.
[2:54:20.880 --> 2:54:25.600]  So they're hitting us at every level, and they'll go in and pay $100 million payments
[2:54:25.600 --> 2:54:29.440]  to African countries just to get this food in.
[2:54:29.440 --> 2:54:34.640]  And folks all over the world are saying no, so companies have been caught illegally planting
[2:54:34.640 --> 2:54:35.640]  in places like Brazil.
[2:54:35.640 --> 2:54:37.360]  I mean, they want to get it in.
[2:54:37.360 --> 2:54:38.880]  They want to infest.
[2:54:38.880 --> 2:54:43.680]  They come in and plant their seeds, and they've caught retired royal-mounted police literally
[2:54:43.680 --> 2:54:49.480]  throwing GMO seeds into the gutters by fields.
[2:54:49.480 --> 2:54:53.800]  I mean, this is bio warfare.
[2:54:53.800 --> 2:54:56.720]  Three minutes left in this segment, then five in the next, you've got to leave us Bob Chapman
[2:54:56.720 --> 2:54:57.720]  coming up.
[2:54:57.720 --> 2:54:58.720]  You've got the floor.
[2:54:58.720 --> 2:54:59.720]  I've got it up.
[2:54:59.720 --> 2:55:00.720]  I've brought in my points.
[2:55:00.720 --> 2:55:02.280]  Other key areas we haven't covered.
[2:55:02.280 --> 2:55:09.280]  Well, to go back to this project from the 1950s to give readers an idea that this project
[2:55:09.280 --> 2:55:15.000]  is very concrete, you know, if you think of some vast abstract conspiracy, then you feel
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  hopeless and overwhelmed.
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:18.680]  But it's very concrete, and I think that's important.
[2:55:18.680 --> 2:55:24.520]  That's what I try to do in all of my books, to give people a sense of the actual concrete
[2:55:24.520 --> 2:55:30.000]  individuals who are doing this, the actual concrete institutions, and so forth.
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:34.740]  And this agribusiness project, I think, is absolutely essential to understand.
[2:55:34.740 --> 2:55:40.240]  You go into a supermarket today because of modern advertising, most American shoppers
[2:55:40.240 --> 2:55:46.920]  think food has grown in a supermarket at the giant or Walmart or what will you.
[2:55:46.920 --> 2:55:50.320]  And this is a product of something called agribusiness.
[2:55:50.320 --> 2:55:55.960]  You no longer have the possibility to go to a farmer's market in most parts of the country.
[2:55:55.960 --> 2:56:00.200]  Same similar thing in Europe, although you do still have institutions in France, Germany
[2:56:00.200 --> 2:56:05.520]  and elsewhere of these weekly farmer's markets, thank goodness, but more and more of those
[2:56:05.520 --> 2:56:12.560]  are getting agribusiness tomatoes from Holland or South Africa or whatever.
[2:56:12.560 --> 2:56:20.300]  But the vertical integration of the food chain in the hands of three or four giant multinational
[2:56:20.300 --> 2:56:21.480]  companies.
[2:56:21.480 --> 2:56:26.040]  The grain trade is in the hands of essentially three giant corporations.
[2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:31.840]  One of them, Cargill Corporation, is a private family-held corporation.
[2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:37.440]  The former chairman of it, Whitney McMillan, was a Skull and Bones member along with the
[2:56:37.440 --> 2:56:41.520]  Bush father and son at Yale University.
[2:56:41.520 --> 2:56:44.800]  And they have more power than most governments.
[2:56:44.800 --> 2:56:51.720]  They determine the power, and this I documented in on-the-spot research talking to principles
[2:56:51.720 --> 2:56:57.440]  involved at the European Commission in Brussels and Belgium back in the 1980s.
[2:56:57.440 --> 2:57:01.960]  They determine European Union grain policies.
[2:57:01.960 --> 2:57:07.000]  They were the ones who determined that the grain mountains would be eliminated in Europe
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:16.280]  and also in the United States just in time for their policy of biofuels, burning corn,
[2:57:16.280 --> 2:57:24.040]  burning different crops like canola or rapeseed as automobile fuel instead of using it for
[2:57:24.040 --> 2:57:26.880]  the human food chain or the animal food chain.
[2:57:26.880 --> 2:57:31.440]  And what has that done in the last three years, since 2005, and the Bush administration
[2:57:31.440 --> 2:57:36.440]  provided these huge incentives for biofuels to farmers, half of the corn crop that the
[2:57:36.440 --> 2:57:41.800]  United States of America is burned for transport fuels.
[2:57:41.800 --> 2:57:43.480]  It's absolutely criminal.
[2:57:43.480 --> 2:57:48.120]  So this is the kind of thing that they're playing around with this agribusiness, this
[2:57:48.120 --> 2:57:53.560]  cartilization, monopolization of the food chain, and that is a highly unhealthy process
[2:57:53.560 --> 2:57:54.560]  for the human species.
[2:57:54.560 --> 2:57:55.560]  All right.
[2:57:55.560 --> 2:57:56.560]  Got a break.
[2:57:56.560 --> 2:57:57.560]  One minute break.
[2:57:57.560 --> 2:58:04.200]  Final segment with F. William, our guest, just an amazing researcher, F. William Engdahl.
[2:58:04.200 --> 2:58:06.640]  I'm Alex Jones, stay with us.
[2:58:06.640 --> 2:58:07.640]  This is Warfare.
[2:58:07.640 --> 2:58:08.640]  Thank you for listening.
[2:58:08.640 --> 2:58:13.720]  I'm going to skip this one minute break, too.
[2:58:13.720 --> 2:58:20.680]  Yeah, for the Internet listeners, William, we're skipping this little break right now.
[2:58:20.680 --> 2:58:22.520]  This thing goes up on PrismPlanet.tv.
[2:58:22.520 --> 2:58:23.760]  They're watching live.
[2:58:23.760 --> 2:58:27.600]  They're listening live and it's magnified as it spills out onto all the web channels.
[2:58:27.600 --> 2:58:31.560]  It's important viewers to not just put this up on YouTube and Google, but other tracks
[2:58:31.560 --> 2:58:34.840]  because we've got YouTube and Google are racing a lot of our stuff.
[2:58:34.840 --> 2:58:35.840]  Hit them there.
[2:58:35.840 --> 2:58:36.840]  That's where it goes viral.
[2:58:36.840 --> 2:58:39.800]  But hit the enemy at every other point.
[2:58:39.800 --> 2:58:45.680]  Let's come back and wrap this up for folks, the fact that this really is a military operation.
[2:58:45.680 --> 2:58:52.960]  As you said, and kind of go back to the beginning, back to the start, so we can recap the fact
[2:58:52.960 --> 2:58:58.280]  that the eugenesis, as you document your book and your research, started all of this.
[2:58:58.280 --> 2:59:02.520]  And then any other points you want to make in the final five minutes we have, okay?
[2:59:02.520 --> 2:59:06.680]  Well, Alex, I'd like to make one very crucial point.
[2:59:06.680 --> 2:59:13.680]  A lot of people are of the impression that this is all a question of corporate greed.
[2:59:13.680 --> 2:59:19.280]  Monsanto has corporate greed, Sincanta, Dow, Dupont, and so forth.
[2:59:19.280 --> 2:59:21.400]  It's not corporate greed.
[2:59:21.400 --> 2:59:23.560]  They wouldn't have taken such a high risk path.
[2:59:23.560 --> 2:59:24.560]  It's eugenics.
[2:59:24.560 --> 2:59:25.560]  It's their religion.
[2:59:25.560 --> 2:59:26.560]  They want to kill everybody.
[2:59:26.560 --> 2:59:27.560]  Stay there.
[2:59:27.560 --> 2:59:28.560]  Don't let them up.
[2:59:28.560 --> 2:59:30.560]  See, I've never read your book, but I know the answer, because they say they're going
[2:59:30.560 --> 2:59:31.560]  to kill us.
[2:59:31.560 --> 2:59:32.560]  Here we go.
[2:59:32.560 --> 2:59:41.680]  Now, into the fourth and final hour, we've got Bob Chapman, an actual forecaster coming
[2:59:41.680 --> 2:59:44.360]  with Economic News 9-11 Info.
[2:59:44.360 --> 2:59:51.480]  Last five minutes with F. William Engdahl, researcher, author.
[2:59:51.480 --> 2:59:56.520]  In the final equation, as you talk about in your book, this is not being done for greed.
[2:59:56.520 --> 2:59:58.240]  It's not being done for even power.
[2:59:58.240 --> 2:59:59.880]  It is their religion.
[2:59:59.880 --> 3:00:03.360]  They believe exterminating the vast majority of the population is the goal.
[3:00:03.360 --> 3:00:08.020]  So give us, lay it out, and it's in their own words.
[3:00:08.020 --> 3:00:09.560]  What is this really all about?
[3:00:09.560 --> 3:00:14.800]  Well, it's about supremacy, and the ultimate form of supremacy is genocide.
[3:00:14.800 --> 3:00:17.080]  Sir, you've got four minutes.
[3:00:17.080 --> 3:00:25.280]  Well, I went through four years of university with some of the scions of these families,
[3:00:25.280 --> 3:00:31.000]  the Rockefellers, the Firestones, the Duponts, and so forth, and they are not charming people
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:33.560]  on a one-on-one basis.
[3:00:33.560 --> 3:00:40.360]  And I would maintain that they are in a clinical, classical, psychoanalytical sense.
[3:00:40.360 --> 3:00:42.120]  These are highly paranoid people.
[3:00:42.120 --> 3:00:49.280]  They are terrified that the masses, as they see it, the hordes out there, are going to
[3:00:49.280 --> 3:00:54.720]  steal everything they've grabbed and accumulated over the decades.
[3:00:54.720 --> 3:00:59.600]  And therefore, I think they've gone to these lengths, and it's a perversion that's taken
[3:00:59.600 --> 3:01:00.760]  on a life of its own.
[3:01:00.760 --> 3:01:09.200]  But it's literally, at this point, to the point where if we don't roll this back in
[3:01:09.200 --> 3:01:13.640]  somewhere or another, it may already be too late in terms of GMO, the genie may be out
[3:01:13.640 --> 3:01:14.640]  of the bottle.
[3:01:14.640 --> 3:01:18.160]  Some serious scientists think that that may be the case.
[3:01:18.160 --> 3:01:24.320]  I think not so long as in Western Europe there is massive resistance on the grassroots
[3:01:24.320 --> 3:01:25.320]  level against GMO.
[3:01:25.320 --> 3:01:32.960]  The governments have not been able to satisfy Monsanto and the other gene giants in terms
[3:01:32.960 --> 3:01:37.960]  of promoting this in Europe, because there's too much backlash against it.
[3:01:37.960 --> 3:01:45.360]  They have had extreme difficulties in Asia, in China, in Africa, and so forth.
[3:01:45.360 --> 3:01:51.760]  And so they haven't gotten, they tried to pull something off at the Rome Food Summit
[3:01:51.760 --> 3:01:53.080]  in June.
[3:01:53.080 --> 3:02:01.880]  They made an extra effort to play up the world hunger emergency with the tripling of the
[3:02:01.880 --> 3:02:06.720]  price of rice, the basic food staple of more than one and a half billion people, or two
[3:02:06.720 --> 3:02:08.960]  billion people across Asia.
[3:02:08.960 --> 3:02:14.600]  And they invited Pope Benedict as a personal distinguished guest to the conference in the
[3:02:14.600 --> 3:02:21.800]  hopes that he would give a papal blessing to GMO as a solution to the world hunger crisis.
[3:02:21.800 --> 3:02:23.120]  And he didn't, did he?
[3:02:23.120 --> 3:02:24.120]  He didn't do it.
[3:02:24.120 --> 3:02:29.120]  I won't go through all the details as it was told to me by people in Rome who are highly
[3:02:29.120 --> 3:02:30.120]  informed.
[3:02:30.120 --> 3:02:36.240]  But thank the Lord that he didn't do it, but that just shows you that this, and suddenly
[3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:41.640]  the theme of world hunger disappeared from the agenda, the operation didn't succeed.
[3:02:41.640 --> 3:02:45.760]  Let's point out that even within the eugenicists, some of them don't like it, like Prince Philip
[3:02:45.760 --> 3:02:46.760]  and Prince Charles.
[3:02:46.760 --> 3:02:47.760]  They're evil.
[3:02:47.760 --> 3:02:50.120]  They want to exterminate people and we have their names on those documents.
[3:02:50.120 --> 3:02:53.800]  I mean, they've stated it, but they're like, don't do it this way, and they're right.
[3:02:53.800 --> 3:02:56.280]  I mean, this endangers everything.
[3:02:56.280 --> 3:02:58.760]  And I also want to add, it's not just the elites.
[3:02:58.760 --> 3:03:04.040]  You've got, like in Blade Runner, little shops in Hong Kong and in South Korea, as you know,
[3:03:04.040 --> 3:03:09.120]  where they're privately little, little families, little companies, are splicing Reese's monkeys
[3:03:09.120 --> 3:03:11.200]  with jellyfish that glow in the dark.
[3:03:11.200 --> 3:03:15.720]  And that causes all sorts of viral releases from DNA, bacterial mutations.
[3:03:15.720 --> 3:03:17.820]  We've had a lot of scientists on about that.
[3:03:17.820 --> 3:03:23.240]  So there's also all these other crazy rogues out, literally playing with Shiva.
[3:03:23.240 --> 3:03:25.200]  I mean, literally playing with Kali.
[3:03:25.200 --> 3:03:28.040]  I mean, this is opening the gates of hell.
[3:03:28.040 --> 3:03:30.040]  Yep, yep.
[3:03:30.040 --> 3:03:34.160]  Well, maybe the human race isn't fit to survive.
[3:03:34.160 --> 3:03:35.160]  I'm an optimist.
[3:03:35.160 --> 3:03:36.160]  I think we are.
[3:03:36.160 --> 3:03:37.160]  No, I agree with you.
[3:03:37.160 --> 3:03:38.160]  I wrote the book.
[3:03:38.160 --> 3:03:40.800]  Well, I mean, I'm not calling for crises, but there have already been a lot of crises
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:44.600]  with this stuff and a lot of big problems, and we know it's hurting humans.
[3:03:44.600 --> 3:03:49.520]  But the faster that can come out, the better, so we can really get control of this and then
[3:03:49.520 --> 3:03:57.040]  have heavily transparent research and maybe even have some GMO, but it's got to be done
[3:03:57.040 --> 3:03:58.840]  very, very slowly, very, very carefully.
[3:03:58.840 --> 3:04:01.840]  Do you agree that some of it's okay if it's controlled properly?
[3:04:01.840 --> 3:04:09.520]  No, I think the methodology of GMO is reductivist in a scientific sense and utterly flawed.
[3:04:09.520 --> 3:04:10.520]  So you believe the...
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:14.120]  The canon approach is that there's no way that this could be stable.
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:17.320]  There may be in the universe of possibilities some way that it can be.
[3:04:17.320 --> 3:04:18.320]  I won't rule that out.
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:19.320]  Yeah.
[3:04:19.320 --> 3:04:20.320]  I'm not a biologist.
[3:04:20.320 --> 3:04:21.720]  It's just too dangerous.
[3:04:21.720 --> 3:04:24.280]  Even if you meant to do good with it, it's too dangerous.
[3:04:24.280 --> 3:04:25.280]  Stay there.
[3:04:25.280 --> 3:04:28.240]  I want to say bye to you right now for infowars.com viewers.
[3:04:28.240 --> 3:04:32.400]  Okay, sir, I'm going to have Trey call you.
[3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:37.720]  That professor, Arapaid, I interviewed him twice, then the computer we hadn't transferred,
[3:04:37.720 --> 3:04:40.560]  the number got lost, I'm never got him back on.
[3:04:40.560 --> 3:04:44.080]  Let me have Trey call you in about 10 minutes, let's you have a break, and can you give me
[3:04:44.080 --> 3:04:47.320]  his email or his phone.
[3:04:47.320 --> 3:04:48.320]  He's been on several times.
[3:04:48.320 --> 3:04:51.360]  You can just Google that so I can get him back on.
[3:04:51.360 --> 3:04:55.320]  And then I want to have you on about two weeks when the book comes out.
[3:04:55.320 --> 3:04:56.320]  I want to carry it.
[3:04:56.320 --> 3:04:58.480]  I've read some of the synopsis of full-spectrum dominance.
[3:04:58.480 --> 3:05:00.200]  I have a big bookstore online, big.
[3:05:00.200 --> 3:05:01.360]  It's bigger than global research.
[3:05:01.360 --> 3:05:02.360]  They're great folks.
[3:05:02.360 --> 3:05:03.360]  I want to...
[3:05:03.360 --> 3:05:06.000]  Or is global research publishing your new full-spectrum dominance?
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:08.440]  I'm self-publishing.
[3:05:08.440 --> 3:05:09.440]  Are you using a self-publisher?
[3:05:09.440 --> 3:05:11.280]  Are you having a bunch of them printed up?
[3:05:11.280 --> 3:05:13.320]  No, I'm using a self-publisher.
[3:05:13.320 --> 3:05:14.320]  Okay.
[3:05:14.320 --> 3:05:15.320]  Well, would you like...
[3:05:15.320 --> 3:05:17.520]  Maybe, all fair, I'll talk to you about carrying some of your stuff.
[3:05:17.520 --> 3:05:19.320]  Well, we can talk about it.
[3:05:19.320 --> 3:05:23.040]  I'm open, but it's got to be at least as good terms as I can do by...
[3:05:23.040 --> 3:05:24.640]  I'm not even worried about all that, man.
[3:05:24.640 --> 3:05:25.640]  That's why I got you on, plugging it.
[3:05:25.640 --> 3:05:26.640]  Somebody to buy it.
[3:05:26.640 --> 3:05:27.640]  Okay.
[3:05:27.640 --> 3:05:28.640]  Very good.
[3:05:28.640 --> 3:05:31.600]  It's just if I sell it on my website, I'll sell 20 times as much as you ever will with
[3:05:31.600 --> 3:05:33.400]  me plugging global research.
[3:05:33.400 --> 3:05:36.720]  Because what happens is, and that's what I do every day, I have guests on and I plug
[3:05:36.720 --> 3:05:37.720]  their things.
[3:05:37.720 --> 3:05:38.720]  It's not even about the money.
[3:05:38.720 --> 3:05:42.600]  I do advertising everything here just to pay for making my films.
[3:05:42.600 --> 3:05:45.320]  They lose money, but tens of millions watch them on the web.
[3:05:45.320 --> 3:05:46.720]  It's all mission-oriented.
[3:05:46.720 --> 3:05:47.720]  Okay.
[3:05:47.720 --> 3:05:51.080]  Because my children have no future if we don't do that.
[3:05:51.080 --> 3:05:53.680]  So, I'm just saying, yeah, no, I mean, I would...
[3:05:53.680 --> 3:05:57.800]  But I'm saying, if you self-publish like on some on-demand thing, or are you printing
[3:05:57.800 --> 3:05:58.800]  up a bunch yourself?
[3:05:58.800 --> 3:06:02.120]  No, it's books on demand, lightning source.
[3:06:02.120 --> 3:06:03.120]  Yeah.
[3:06:03.120 --> 3:06:09.040]  Then I know that's cost-prohibitive for you to even be able to sell them to me in bulk.
[3:06:09.040 --> 3:06:10.720]  Because they charge you so much.
[3:06:10.720 --> 3:06:12.840]  You want to look at your...
[3:06:12.840 --> 3:06:17.280]  Have your guy get to me on some of the terms and maybe we can work something out.
[3:06:17.280 --> 3:06:18.280]  I'm totally open.
[3:06:18.280 --> 3:06:19.280]  I just want to...
[3:06:19.280 --> 3:06:20.280]  Yeah.
[3:06:20.280 --> 3:06:23.760]  I'm fed up with publishers who cheat and leave me with nothing at the end of the day and
[3:06:23.760 --> 3:06:24.760]  don't promote the books.
[3:06:24.760 --> 3:06:25.760]  Oh, no, no, no.
[3:06:25.760 --> 3:06:31.280]  You do much better to say have 3,000 or 4,000 printed yourself and then sell them to wholesalers
[3:06:31.280 --> 3:06:33.440]  like myself, like global research.
[3:06:33.440 --> 3:06:36.680]  And with 10 contacts like that, I just want your book to get out.
[3:06:36.680 --> 3:06:39.080]  I just want what you're doing to get out.
[3:06:39.080 --> 3:06:41.680]  So, and again, this show has total transparency.
[3:06:41.680 --> 3:06:44.680]  We're even on air right now, just for the internet.
[3:06:44.680 --> 3:06:47.680]  Before we leave, give out your website one more time.
[3:06:47.680 --> 3:06:48.680]  Okay.
[3:06:48.680 --> 3:06:53.680]  It's www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net.
[3:06:53.680 --> 3:07:03.560]  Okay, well, listen, we'll get you up for a couple hours on full spectrum dominance in
[3:07:03.560 --> 3:07:04.560]  a few weeks.
[3:07:04.560 --> 3:07:08.640]  And I want to have you back on for maybe an hour or some time in a few months about those
[3:07:08.640 --> 3:07:12.040]  elitists you went to school with, we've had other people on academics who've been in school
[3:07:12.040 --> 3:07:15.440]  with them to describe the evil I've had their roommates on and thanks.
[3:07:15.440 --> 3:07:16.440]  Thank you so much, sir.
[3:07:16.440 --> 3:07:18.040]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[3:07:18.040 --> 3:07:19.040]  I enjoyed it very much.
[3:07:19.040 --> 3:07:20.040]  The thing I enjoyed you.
[3:07:20.040 --> 3:07:21.040]  God bless you.
[3:07:21.040 --> 3:07:22.040]  Okay.
[3:07:22.040 --> 3:07:23.040]  Do we have Bob Chapman?
[3:07:23.040 --> 3:07:24.040]  Yes, we do.
[3:07:24.040 --> 3:07:25.320]  I just have to transfer him over.
[3:07:25.320 --> 3:07:26.320]  He is ready.
[3:07:26.320 --> 3:07:27.320]  Well done.
[3:07:27.320 --> 3:07:28.320]  Thank you.
[3:07:28.320 --> 3:07:29.320]  Oh, and for all of you who are out there, all my films are free online.
[3:07:29.320 --> 3:07:33.720]  That's what it's all about, defeating the globalists and only you can stop them.
[3:07:33.720 --> 3:07:38.200]  You can put the films out in masks to everybody on your email list and we can defeat them.
[3:07:38.200 --> 3:07:39.200]  All of us.
[3:07:39.200 --> 3:07:40.200]  It's that attitude of victory.
[3:07:40.200 --> 3:07:53.200]  Knowing we're going to have it, let's go live.
[3:07:53.200 --> 3:07:58.880]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, for the next 51 minutes, we are joined by Bob
[3:07:58.880 --> 3:07:59.880]  Chapman.
[3:07:59.880 --> 3:08:02.600]  Now, coming up at the bottom of the hour in 20 minutes, we'll open the phones up for
[3:08:02.600 --> 3:08:08.160]  9-11 Truth, Economic Questions, anything you want to discuss, but so much has been happening
[3:08:08.160 --> 3:08:14.560]  – unbelievable discussion we just had with F. William Endall in the last hour.
[3:08:14.560 --> 3:08:19.760]  But Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, all the things that are developing.
[3:08:19.760 --> 3:08:21.120]  What does this mean?
[3:08:21.120 --> 3:08:28.280]  Having the Treasury taken over, bailing out the Federal Reserve, again, a massive consolidation
[3:08:28.280 --> 3:08:29.280]  happening.
[3:08:29.280 --> 3:08:34.320]  You're going to pay taxes on all of this, with all these foreigners buying our debt.
[3:08:34.320 --> 3:08:39.880]  I mean, but talking to an economist, a former military intelligence, has had the biggest
[3:08:39.880 --> 3:08:43.920]  newsletter in the world until he retired, now it's one of the biggest again.
[3:08:43.920 --> 3:08:49.160]  The International Forecaster.com also, he and Gary Allen were partners.
[3:08:49.160 --> 3:08:52.760]  That woke me up when I was a teenager reading Nundercall Conspiracy.
[3:08:52.760 --> 3:08:55.760]  I don't really heard it all in history and read it, but it really brought it home, the
[3:08:55.760 --> 3:09:00.160]  big picture, how they control the left and right, the Communist and the Fascist.
[3:09:00.160 --> 3:09:04.640]  So he's just an amazing person and we're glad we can have him on to pop in this week
[3:09:04.640 --> 3:09:06.000]  and spend time with us.
[3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:11.240]  Bob Chapman, it is good to have you here, but since it's 9-11, first give us your
[3:09:11.240 --> 3:09:14.160]  take on the 9-11 cover-up.
[3:09:14.160 --> 3:09:19.440]  It seems it's collapsing with all these big names coming out and saying an investigation
[3:09:19.440 --> 3:09:21.800]  isn't inside job, could be an inside job.
[3:09:21.800 --> 3:09:26.760]  The biggest comedian in France, friends with Sarkozy, congressman, more congressmen coming
[3:09:26.760 --> 3:09:32.080]  out, a guy with millions and millions of followers, of course Ralph Nader on earlier
[3:09:32.080 --> 3:09:36.600]  saying yes, our government stages terror attacks, our people are in New York and all over the
[3:09:36.600 --> 3:09:41.840]  country right now handing out free DVDs and pamphlets, they're saying everybody's coming
[3:09:41.840 --> 3:09:46.600]  up taking the stuff, almost everyone believes it's an inside job, it's exponential, your
[3:09:46.600 --> 3:09:48.800]  take on that and then the economy.
[3:09:48.800 --> 3:09:58.120]  Well, my take on that is it's about time and people are so slow to react as far as 9-11
[3:09:58.120 --> 3:10:04.680]  is concerned, they like to put it in the back of their mind, nobody I knew, so to speak,
[3:10:04.680 --> 3:10:10.080]  get killed there or get injured there and so let the government sort it out.
[3:10:10.080 --> 3:10:20.240]  Now, I believe anybody who saw what happened that day and the professionally collapsed
[3:10:20.240 --> 3:10:27.120]  building knew right away that something was dramatically wrong and so people are finding
[3:10:27.120 --> 3:10:34.400]  out and they're becoming more outspoken about it and I think in time there will be finally
[3:10:34.400 --> 3:10:41.480]  a real investigation to find out who did what to us and that's coming and it's because
[3:10:41.480 --> 3:10:47.280]  of people like yourself and others who have gone out and gotten tremendous amounts of
[3:10:47.280 --> 3:10:53.680]  information on the subject and disseminated it to the public like you are right now and
[3:10:53.680 --> 3:10:58.240]  maybe after the next election maybe we can get something done about it.
[3:10:58.240 --> 3:11:03.760]  Well, you just brought up a point there, it was meant, everything the globalists do is
[3:11:03.760 --> 3:11:08.160]  gauge for different strata, what will intelligentsia think, what will controllers think, what
[3:11:08.160 --> 3:11:13.360]  will our opposition that's in the know think, what will kind of the somewhat informed white
[3:11:13.360 --> 3:11:18.120]  collar folks think, what will the dumb down, you know, beer, slurping, football watching,
[3:11:18.120 --> 3:11:21.400]  I'm not saying you're bad folks, we all love it, point is that's your God, that's all you
[3:11:21.400 --> 3:11:26.960]  know, you're not versatile, what will they think and clearly 9-11 was meant to governments
[3:11:26.960 --> 3:11:32.400]  to be a threat, look how bold we are, it was also meant to be a threat to us and the fact
[3:11:32.400 --> 3:11:37.320]  that it was so obvious, I mean, you know, they gauge that, what was the message they
[3:11:37.320 --> 3:11:40.040]  were sending there to the different strata?
[3:11:40.040 --> 3:11:47.480]  You better watch out, you're going to have a problem and that is, you keep your mouth
[3:11:47.480 --> 3:11:52.400]  shut and go along with the program and we won't bother you, if you don't you're going
[3:11:52.400 --> 3:11:59.200]  to have problems and that is through the Patriot acts and other legislation that's been passed
[3:11:59.200 --> 3:12:05.920]  and for those people who are really outspoken, many of them seem to suicide themselves and
[3:12:05.920 --> 3:12:11.960]  so I think that was the, the threat and I think they did it in Oklahoma City as well.
[3:12:11.960 --> 3:12:15.280]  So it's an open and then cops spoke out and said the Feds did it and they'd murder them
[3:12:15.280 --> 3:12:19.800]  and torture them to death and then laugh and say it was suicide, cut them all open, a cop
[3:12:19.800 --> 3:12:23.320]  of the year turned shaky and others, oh you saw Feds there, well you're just dead, cop
[3:12:23.320 --> 3:12:26.200]  of the year, saved all those people, how about we torture you and find out who else knows
[3:12:26.200 --> 3:12:30.200]  what's going on and their fellow cops shut their mouths and said absolutely murderers
[3:12:30.200 --> 3:12:35.160]  whenever you want, we love it basically but some police have exposed, it's just so pathetic
[3:12:35.160 --> 3:12:43.240]  to see this going on but you're absolutely right, it is an open threat to everyone and
[3:12:43.240 --> 3:12:47.840]  it is meant to be a threat to those of us that are in the know but I think the elites
[3:12:47.840 --> 3:12:53.480]  were going according to an old paradigm, an old attack paradigm, an old attack profile
[3:12:53.480 --> 3:13:00.960]  when they had media dominance, now they don't and I really think that they are on the run
[3:13:00.960 --> 3:13:06.760]  on many fronts and are not very happy how 9-11 ended up for them.
[3:13:06.760 --> 3:13:14.480]  I think you're absolutely right and that has spread as you say into other areas, their
[3:13:14.480 --> 3:13:23.000]  program for the Middle East has been disastrous, their economic and financial program is entrapped,
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:27.640]  I mean they can't get out, there's going to be a day of reckoning and they know that
[3:13:27.640 --> 3:13:33.920]  and that's why they're frantically running around as Mr Engel said, they're afraid they're
[3:13:33.920 --> 3:13:39.960]  going to lose their wealth and power and Alex is people like you and I who are going to
[3:13:39.960 --> 3:13:45.640]  take their wealth and power away from them through our court system by exposing what
[3:13:45.640 --> 3:13:46.640]  they're doing.
[3:13:46.640 --> 3:13:50.400]  Well, I mean they realize that, that's why they're so dangerous is they've gone to
[3:13:50.400 --> 3:13:55.160]  the point of no return, they've gone for broke and they know that and they say that, their
[3:13:55.160 --> 3:13:59.400]  crimes are so huge that if they don't bring in full spectrum dominance, if they don't
[3:13:59.400 --> 3:14:05.080]  activate COG and totally dominate everybody then they're openly saying they're cooked
[3:14:05.080 --> 3:14:11.280]  so that's why it's the immovable object, you know going up against an immovable object,
[3:14:11.280 --> 3:14:16.360]  it is a collision and if we just don't blink and just say you know what ramming speed and
[3:14:16.360 --> 3:14:20.560]  put it in high gear and just pedal to the metal, I mean there's no way we're going to
[3:14:20.560 --> 3:14:22.320]  lose Bob.
[3:14:22.320 --> 3:14:28.560]  I agree with that, it's just waiting a mountain keeping the information coming and I never
[3:14:28.560 --> 3:14:36.800]  thought that I would be projected into the spot that I am at my late age being able to
[3:14:36.800 --> 3:14:42.960]  transport information and primarily information in the financial world, there are others who
[3:14:42.960 --> 3:14:51.240]  specialize in other areas just like Mr. Engdahl said earlier that I'm not an expert in science
[3:14:51.240 --> 3:14:59.360]  and neither am I but we do what we can do and it's great that we have someone to work
[3:14:59.360 --> 3:15:05.960]  with like yourself who is able to grasp many subjects and tell the people the real innards
[3:15:05.960 --> 3:15:07.960]  of what's going on in them.
[3:15:07.960 --> 3:15:12.800]  Well Bob, it's just really an honor to have you on as well, okay let's get into the economy
[3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:16.560]  and I'm going to skip this next break coming up for info wars.com listeners because again
[3:15:16.560 --> 3:15:17.880]  the information is so important.
[3:15:17.880 --> 3:15:22.000]  Break down, were you expecting this because you and others have been saying you expected
[3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:24.400]  them to take it over but when were you expecting it?
[3:15:24.400 --> 3:15:28.880]  By that, were you expecting it now because someone said it was coming later, I don't
[3:15:28.880 --> 3:15:31.160]  remember what you said on the show but you said they were going to take over Freddie
[3:15:31.160 --> 3:15:37.160]  Mac and Fannie Mae and then what does this mean, where is it going in the future?
[3:15:37.160 --> 3:15:47.360]  Bob, the first announcement by the international forecaster was just four years ago and I said
[3:15:47.360 --> 3:15:55.440]  that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were technically bankrupt and everybody on Wall Street and
[3:15:55.440 --> 3:16:05.120]  in the Beltway knew that and they needed Fannie and Freddie to execute the real estate bubble
[3:16:05.120 --> 3:16:11.360]  which was going to keep the economy from collapsing for the next five or six or seven years and
[3:16:11.360 --> 3:16:19.480]  so they continue to have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac take on mortgages and as time went on
[3:16:19.480 --> 3:16:25.440]  over this past four year period they took on more speculative mortgages which made this
[3:16:25.440 --> 3:16:34.640]  situation even worse, the figures, the numbers that the balance sheet in Fannie Mae and Freddie
[3:16:34.640 --> 3:16:42.000]  Mac both were bogus, the derivative position, Bob stop, go to derivatives in a minute but
[3:16:42.000 --> 3:16:47.400]  they needed to loosen up on loans to keep the bubble going correct and now is this the
[3:16:47.400 --> 3:16:52.240]  final bubble bringing the big Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac bubble within the Treasury which
[3:16:52.240 --> 3:16:58.080]  internationalizes it or is the final bubble the green carbon tax which they're saying
[3:16:58.080 --> 3:17:01.160]  will pay to the banks?
[3:17:01.160 --> 3:17:05.760]  It's hard to say at this time, I just know with what they've got already they're in
[3:17:05.760 --> 3:17:10.280]  serious trouble and you got to derivatives, go ahead.
[3:17:10.280 --> 3:17:16.920]  Yeah and the derivatives, they just made terrible mistakes in purchasing and writing
[3:17:16.920 --> 3:17:27.600]  them and Reigns who was the head of Fannie Mae who was dismissed, he executed the first
[3:17:27.600 --> 3:17:36.400]  part of it, they were balancing or harmonizing earnings as well and I knew what they were
[3:17:36.400 --> 3:17:41.800]  into as far as the mortgages were concerned and I knew their position was financially
[3:17:41.800 --> 3:17:43.480]  irretrievable.
[3:17:43.480 --> 3:17:51.580]  I never really thought it would get as bad as it has now and they have 5.2 trillion dollars
[3:17:51.580 --> 3:17:59.640]  with the mortgages, they will probably have, I would say a conservative estimate would be
[3:17:59.640 --> 3:18:12.920]  about 35% will turn out to be bad so we're looking at 2 trillion dollars and on top of
[3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:21.720]  that they have allowed the shareholders to lose almost all their money, they have allowed
[3:18:21.720 --> 3:18:27.480]  the preferred holders to probably lose all their money and a lot of them are banks.
[3:18:27.480 --> 3:18:32.240]  Well I'm sorry for interrupting but is it 2 or 3 trillion because my math would be 2.5
[3:18:32.240 --> 3:18:33.240]  trillion?
[3:18:33.240 --> 3:18:40.160]  Yeah 2.5 and that's a good figure, it could go as high as 4 but I baseline it at 2 and
[3:18:40.160 --> 3:18:44.840]  say it'll be 2 or more and that'll take 5, 6, 7 years.
[3:18:44.840 --> 3:18:47.920]  But how much does that affect, I mean that's only 2 trillion on the mortgages, then they
[3:18:47.920 --> 3:18:54.280]  sold bonds, they sold those packages and I've seen some reports say it's 50 trillion, some
[3:18:54.280 --> 3:18:59.960]  say it's 25 trillion, I mean how big is the domino effect?
[3:18:59.960 --> 3:19:04.680]  The domino effect could be as large as those figures that you've mentioned, I'm just going
[3:19:04.680 --> 3:19:09.880]  for the base facts, I mean that's enough to compel anybody to have a spinning headache.
[3:19:09.880 --> 3:19:11.800]  I actually have one right now.
[3:19:11.800 --> 3:19:18.320]  The preferred holders are 36 billion, I don't see any way that government can't come in,
[3:19:18.320 --> 3:19:22.320]  they've got to come in and bail those people out because if they don't hold a bunch of
[3:19:22.320 --> 3:19:24.120]  banks they're going to go under, they wouldn't go under.
[3:19:24.120 --> 3:19:29.480]  Alright let's keep talking about it right now, here we go with Bob Chapman.
[3:19:29.480 --> 3:19:32.520]  Keep rolling Bob, keep rolling, just keep going.
[3:19:32.520 --> 3:19:44.240]  And also of 1.3 trillion dollars around figures of bonds, those bonds, over 800 billion dollars
[3:19:44.240 --> 3:19:50.920]  worth of held by foreigners, and I think that's what brought this thing to a crescendo, I
[3:19:50.920 --> 3:19:52.400]  mean it's been going on for a long time.
[3:19:52.400 --> 3:19:53.400]  So you're saying they had to?
[3:19:53.400 --> 3:19:59.920]  I need to get to the look, you better guarantee those bonds that you've got a serious problem.
[3:19:59.920 --> 3:20:06.000]  Here's the $64 million question, then we'll go back Bob and I'll let you roll.
[3:20:06.000 --> 3:20:09.360]  Here's the $64 million question, and I want to answer this when we come back from break,
[3:20:09.360 --> 3:20:12.280]  but right now you can keep going over the Chinese and what we're saying, but before
[3:20:12.280 --> 3:20:18.400]  I forget, because I write notes here and then forget, when we come back, when or if, how
[3:20:18.400 --> 3:20:25.080]  long till this eats through, this time bomb, until they see the Treasury is insolvent with
[3:20:25.080 --> 3:20:30.280]  all the crap they're dumping on it, or will it just go on forever, and then because it's
[3:20:30.280 --> 3:20:34.840]  the government backing it, it won't matter if it's all fraud, and then we enter a la-la
[3:20:34.840 --> 3:20:41.160]  land where any investment, including birdcage liner, use birdcage liner is as good as gold.
[3:20:41.160 --> 3:20:44.520]  So I mean you see my question, let's answer that in three minutes, but continue answering
[3:20:44.520 --> 3:20:48.800]  with the Chinese saying look, we're holding this, go ahead.
[3:20:48.800 --> 3:20:52.680]  And I think they pushed them into it, and I don't think that they wanted to do that
[3:20:52.680 --> 3:20:58.120]  two months before an election, and so I don't think they had any other choice, and I think
[3:20:58.120 --> 3:21:01.520]  that was probably the compelling factor.
[3:21:01.520 --> 3:21:08.200]  Another thing is that the Chinese have been, again, buying dollars with Yan in order to
[3:21:08.200 --> 3:21:14.680]  suppress the value of Yan, Yan, Yuan, I should say, and the reason they're doing that is
[3:21:14.680 --> 3:21:21.160]  to continue to be competitive, because they're starting to run into some pretty stiff competition
[3:21:21.160 --> 3:21:26.320]  offshore, and of course too, their banking systems, their problems, I won't even go into
[3:21:26.320 --> 3:21:33.320]  here, which is bad as the Japanese had in 1992, and that's because Communist Party members
[3:21:33.320 --> 3:21:36.280]  get loans and never pay them back.
[3:21:36.280 --> 3:21:43.160]  And so China was saying look, you got to honor these bonds, and on the other hand, we're
[3:21:43.160 --> 3:21:47.400]  going to buy dollars because we want to keep our currency down, and by doing so, we'll
[3:21:47.400 --> 3:21:55.760]  buy treasuries with that money, and so they were a support mechanism on one side by buying
[3:21:55.760 --> 3:22:01.200]  the treasuries, but on the other, they wanted protection on their Fannie Mae and Freddie
[3:22:01.200 --> 3:22:10.000]  Mac bonds, and so I think that's what compelled the Treasury to go forward and meet the challenge
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:11.960]  finally.
[3:22:11.960 --> 3:22:17.680]  They didn't want to do it, and how long will this take?
[3:22:17.680 --> 3:22:24.280]  It'll take an absolute minimum of probably three years, and it could go out many years,
[3:22:24.280 --> 3:22:30.880]  and what they're going to try to do is extend the real estate and the mortgage, and the
[3:22:30.880 --> 3:22:36.360]  securitization of mortgage's problem as far out into the futures they can, so they can
[3:22:36.360 --> 3:22:43.640]  deal with other problems that they've got now where about 50% of brokerage houses and
[3:22:43.640 --> 3:22:50.600]  banks are insolvent, and this is a monstrous problem, and so by doing what they've done,
[3:22:50.600 --> 3:22:53.120]  they are able to throw some of it into the future.
[3:22:53.120 --> 3:23:02.200]  Example, right now, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and you didn't see this anymore because
[3:23:02.200 --> 3:23:11.440]  they didn't publish it, they changed the role of default on mortgages from 90 days to two
[3:23:11.440 --> 3:23:12.440]  years.
[3:23:12.440 --> 3:23:13.440]  Wow.
[3:23:13.440 --> 3:23:18.680]  Now, that means that everybody who's in their house can't make their mortgage payment
[3:23:18.680 --> 3:23:19.960]  stay there for a couple of years.
[3:23:19.960 --> 3:23:20.960]  Stay there.
[3:23:20.960 --> 3:23:21.960]  That's a huge announcement.
[3:23:21.960 --> 3:23:23.960]  I want the full audience to hear that, Bob.
[3:23:23.960 --> 3:23:25.560]  I want the full audience to hear that.
[3:23:25.560 --> 3:23:27.760]  We're going live right now.
[3:23:27.760 --> 3:23:31.560]  I guarantee.
[3:23:31.560 --> 3:23:38.400]  Theinternationalforecaster.com, that's his website, my websites are infowars.com, infowars.net,
[3:23:38.400 --> 3:23:43.240]  prisonplanet.tv, prisonplanet.com, take some calls coming up in the last 15, 20 minutes
[3:23:43.240 --> 3:23:44.240]  of the hour.
[3:23:44.240 --> 3:23:53.800]  For Bob Chapman, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, Jesse in the Netherlands, Paula in Canada,
[3:23:53.800 --> 3:23:55.800]  Helen in Florida, Steven Colorado, Chris in Florida.
[3:23:55.800 --> 3:23:59.600]  We're going to get to all of you, and we'll tell you later before he leaves how to get
[3:23:59.600 --> 3:24:01.560]  a free copy of his newsletter.
[3:24:01.560 --> 3:24:06.280]  This isn't the pap you see on TV, the stuff he talks about comes true, nine times out
[3:24:06.280 --> 3:24:07.280]  of ten or more.
[3:24:07.280 --> 3:24:08.880]  I remember him four or five years ago.
[3:24:08.880 --> 3:24:13.160]  I'll be interviewing Bob for about eight and nine, actually, talking about Fannie Mae
[3:24:13.160 --> 3:24:19.560]  Freddie Mac going under, Catherine Austin-Fitz, who worked in the HUD for Clinton High-Level.
[3:24:19.560 --> 3:24:22.640]  She was the head of it, saying this like seven years ago on our show.
[3:24:22.640 --> 3:24:25.560]  So they've known what's going on.
[3:24:25.560 --> 3:24:31.440]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was on with this a few days ago, and this had just happened.
[3:24:31.440 --> 3:24:33.040]  This was Monday.
[3:24:33.040 --> 3:24:35.720]  And so he wasn't sure yet.
[3:24:35.720 --> 3:24:36.720]  Now I've looked at the news.
[3:24:36.720 --> 3:24:42.360]  It is clear that they didn't just guarantee the mortgages, but also the bonds that were
[3:24:42.360 --> 3:24:44.280]  sold on those is the way I see it.
[3:24:44.280 --> 3:24:49.000]  I want to ask Bob Chapman about that, but I want him to elaborate on what this will
[3:24:49.000 --> 3:24:57.240]  extrapolate out to in the next few years because they can prop up the big investments, the
[3:24:57.240 --> 3:25:01.880]  big companies, the big bondholders, the foreign governments, the institutions, and they can
[3:25:01.880 --> 3:25:04.760]  keep printing dollars to fill that void.
[3:25:04.760 --> 3:25:06.560]  But the economy is breaking down.
[3:25:06.560 --> 3:25:07.680]  There's no credit.
[3:25:07.680 --> 3:25:12.640]  Things are degenerating fast, and he's saying three years, maybe longer, like Japan's been
[3:25:12.640 --> 3:25:14.600]  in a 15-year hardcore recession.
[3:25:14.600 --> 3:25:16.880]  So that's a bunch of questions.
[3:25:16.880 --> 3:25:23.520]  But A, are they securing everything tied to the Fannie Mae Freddie Mac?
[3:25:23.520 --> 3:25:31.920]  Are they securing all the bonds and junk that was sold, AAA-rated crap, and then you mentioned
[3:25:31.920 --> 3:25:37.560]  the part so much here about they're guaranteeing mortgage defaults after two years, not just
[3:25:37.560 --> 3:25:38.560]  a few months.
[3:25:38.560 --> 3:25:39.560]  So that's a big deal.
[3:25:39.560 --> 3:25:46.800]  Well, again, it's to extend and extrapolate, as you said, and I think that what they're
[3:25:46.800 --> 3:25:53.120]  going to do, and I don't know if Paul Craig Roberts addressed this, is, yes, they are
[3:25:53.120 --> 3:26:00.040]  going to take on their balance sheet at the Treasury the bad paper that's out there, which
[3:26:00.040 --> 3:26:05.080]  is the CDOs, the FIFVs, and the ABSs.
[3:26:05.080 --> 3:26:11.240]  And those are bonds that contain, for those who don't know out there, mortgages which
[3:26:11.240 --> 3:26:14.320]  were securitized and made into bonds.
[3:26:14.320 --> 3:26:22.120]  The last one, ABSs, asset-backed securities, and they are packaged with vehicle loans,
[3:26:22.120 --> 3:26:28.480]  swimming pools, mobile homes, motorcycles, those kind of things.
[3:26:28.480 --> 3:26:34.480]  And all of that stuff, on average, right now, if you can find a market, is selling somewhere
[3:26:34.480 --> 3:26:40.240]  in the vicinity of a 50 to 60 cents on the dollar, of a sum of the 10 cents and some
[3:26:40.240 --> 3:26:41.640]  of it's at 80.
[3:26:41.640 --> 3:26:44.440]  It all depends on what paper you have.
[3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:52.080]  And so at 50%, the Treasury, eventually, and they're going to be very, very quiet about
[3:26:52.080 --> 3:26:58.120]  doing this, is going to take this on, these securities on, and they're going to loan
[3:26:58.120 --> 3:26:59.640]  against it.
[3:26:59.640 --> 3:27:03.560]  And they won't loan 100% of the value of the security.
[3:27:03.560 --> 3:27:08.200]  They will probably own, loan something near the market.
[3:27:08.200 --> 3:27:15.800]  And so the American taxpayer is going to end up paying for all of that rotten paper that
[3:27:15.800 --> 3:27:19.640]  was issued by the banks in the United States.
[3:27:19.640 --> 3:27:26.240]  The banks are being let off the hook, and that would include the rating companies, S&P,
[3:27:26.240 --> 3:27:31.360]  Moody's, Fitch, who lied about the ratings and said they would AAA when they would triple
[3:27:31.360 --> 3:27:34.760]  B, which is the difference between a 10 and a 4.
[3:27:34.760 --> 3:27:40.880]  They're going to let the mortgage originators, the appraises, the salespeople, and the 85%
[3:27:40.880 --> 3:27:44.360]  of the people who lied on their applications off the hook.
[3:27:44.360 --> 3:27:45.360]  Now, now...
[3:27:45.360 --> 3:27:47.080]  The Treasury is going to eat it.
[3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:48.560]  The Treasury is you and I.
[3:27:48.560 --> 3:27:50.720]  Yeah, the Treasury is you and I.
[3:27:50.720 --> 3:27:55.160]  Now what does it mean, the huge announcement, as you said, that got almost no attention?
[3:27:55.160 --> 3:27:56.160]  I'm ashamed.
[3:27:56.160 --> 3:27:57.160]  I haven't mentioned it here.
[3:27:57.160 --> 3:28:02.760]  I don't see it, that they've moved from a few months on default on mortgages for individuals,
[3:28:02.760 --> 3:28:05.440]  civilians, as we're called, to two years.
[3:28:05.440 --> 3:28:10.120]  That is a big break in this whole area of burning the people.
[3:28:10.120 --> 3:28:13.240]  That's a place where the people actually get something, though we'll pay for it in
[3:28:13.240 --> 3:28:15.760]  dollar devaluation down the road.
[3:28:15.760 --> 3:28:20.720]  So basically, if you are somebody who's insolvent, you cheated, too.
[3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:22.680]  You lied on the piece of paper.
[3:28:22.680 --> 3:28:26.200]  So the only people getting punished here are people that saved and people that did a good
[3:28:26.200 --> 3:28:27.200]  job.
[3:28:27.200 --> 3:28:29.280]  Exactly.
[3:28:29.280 --> 3:28:34.160]  And you know, this is the only way that they can do it.
[3:28:34.160 --> 3:28:40.200]  What the institutions have been doing already is they've been moving them off balance sheet.
[3:28:40.200 --> 3:28:47.280]  And they do that, they take a package, let's say it's worth $5 billion, and the person that
[3:28:47.280 --> 3:28:53.480]  they sell it to, but it's not really sold because it's a conditional contract.
[3:28:53.480 --> 3:29:01.080]  They sell it to another party, and the other party pays 20 percent, and the entity loans
[3:29:01.080 --> 3:29:04.560]  them 80 percent to buy the bad paper.
[3:29:04.560 --> 3:29:08.040]  I mean, you talk about Mickey Mouse bookkeeping.
[3:29:08.040 --> 3:29:09.480]  Tell you what, stay there.
[3:29:09.480 --> 3:29:14.120]  For people that may have passed over their heads, they weren't paying attention.
[3:29:14.120 --> 3:29:17.760]  Explain that in detail right now for the infowars.com stream listeners.
[3:29:17.760 --> 3:29:19.680]  You've got to go there.
[3:29:19.680 --> 3:29:20.960]  We're on the march.
[3:29:20.960 --> 3:29:22.720]  The empire's on the run.
[3:29:22.720 --> 3:29:25.720]  Yep, it's Alex Jones, the GCN radio network.
[3:29:25.720 --> 3:29:29.960]  Okay, Bob, please continue.
[3:29:29.960 --> 3:29:39.720]  It's Alex and Bob, and Bob owns XYZ securities, and Alex is an equity expert that has lots
[3:29:39.720 --> 3:29:41.320]  of money.
[3:29:41.320 --> 3:29:47.400]  And I go to Alex and I say, Alex, I've got this $5 billion worth of bonds, which are
[3:29:47.400 --> 3:29:48.900]  CDOs.
[3:29:48.900 --> 3:29:51.560]  I want to move them off my balance sheet.
[3:29:51.560 --> 3:29:54.600]  I want to sell them to you on a conditional basis.
[3:29:54.600 --> 3:30:01.280]  You put 20 percent of the money out, which would be $1 billion in this case, and we'll
[3:30:01.280 --> 3:30:07.400]  loan you the other $4 billion for you to take this off our hands.
[3:30:07.400 --> 3:30:11.520]  All you have to do is pay us back, and if everything works out well, you'll end up with
[3:30:11.520 --> 3:30:15.920]  a nice profit, and we will have had these off the books because we rock our book.
[3:30:15.920 --> 3:30:19.640]  So that's just fractional reserve banking again.
[3:30:19.640 --> 3:30:22.640]  Well, it isn't even that.
[3:30:22.640 --> 3:30:33.360]  It is so illegal under FASB rules, it's unbelievable, and they expect people to stand by and look
[3:30:33.360 --> 3:30:38.440]  at them robust and us to stand still for it.
[3:30:38.440 --> 3:30:39.440]  It's incredible.
[3:30:39.440 --> 3:30:44.000]  I mean, nothing like this has ever happened, and everybody in corporate American Wall
[3:30:44.000 --> 3:30:49.240]  Street and government doesn't say a word that the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[3:30:49.240 --> 3:30:50.240]  No, Bob.
[3:30:50.240 --> 3:30:54.240]  Instead, the ones that made the big bucks and all these new billionaires, they're all literally
[3:30:54.240 --> 3:31:00.560]  buying armored compounds in the Caribbean with private security forces, and I've talked
[3:31:00.560 --> 3:31:01.560]  to them.
[3:31:01.560 --> 3:31:05.560]  They said they're here in Austin, and they'll just, they're basically saying it's going
[3:31:05.560 --> 3:31:06.720]  to be war on the streets.
[3:31:06.720 --> 3:31:08.280]  They have road warrior dust.
[3:31:08.280 --> 3:31:15.000]  They have robbed us so bad, and they are just bastards, and then they've got these brainwashed
[3:31:15.000 --> 3:31:19.920]  bloodthirsty macho-royd head cops that'll do whatever they're told and are convinced
[3:31:19.920 --> 3:31:23.960]  that anybody that loves America or freedom is evil, and they're ready to eat our guts
[3:31:23.960 --> 3:31:25.200]  and ask for seconds.
[3:31:25.200 --> 3:31:30.760]  God, it's so sick, they're going to leave us with a bunch of steroid cops while they
[3:31:30.760 --> 3:31:33.560]  fly off with all the money.
[3:31:33.560 --> 3:31:39.080]  And they're all going to die, and they know it, and a lot of us are too, but we're going
[3:31:39.080 --> 3:31:40.880]  after them.
[3:31:40.880 --> 3:31:44.980]  There is going to be redemption in this, and they know it, and they're not going to get
[3:31:44.980 --> 3:31:50.400]  to keep their power and money this time, and this is going to make the fall of the Hansianic
[3:31:50.400 --> 3:31:54.800]  League and the Lombard system look like child's play.
[3:31:54.800 --> 3:31:55.800]  You think so?
[3:31:55.800 --> 3:32:01.760]  They'll just tell the cops that babies are al-Qaeda, and they'll throw them off clips,
[3:32:01.760 --> 3:32:06.960]  cut their heads off, suck their blood, just, ah, where the government, ah, we rape you.
[3:32:06.960 --> 3:32:07.960]  We're criminals.
[3:32:07.960 --> 3:32:08.960]  Here we go.
[3:32:08.960 --> 3:32:09.960]  We're going to go back live right now.
[3:32:09.960 --> 3:32:10.960]  I'm just so sick of them.
[3:32:10.960 --> 3:32:16.440]  This is me off, just filth, scum, dumb idiots everywhere, believing whatever the government
[3:32:16.440 --> 3:32:17.440]  says.
[3:32:17.440 --> 3:32:21.120]  You idiots have no idea, all you people saying, we're making this up, you're going to find
[3:32:21.120 --> 3:32:25.440]  out because of your ignorance, and you letting them do this, we're screwed.
[3:32:25.440 --> 3:32:27.440]  Here we go.
[3:32:27.440 --> 3:32:41.780]  Number 7-1.
[3:32:41.780 --> 3:32:55.920]  Bob, in layman's terms, explain, as you were saying behind the scenes for the M4 listeners.
[3:32:55.920 --> 3:33:02.120]  They listen to those key streams.
[3:33:02.120 --> 3:33:05.960]  What they've done financially here in the past, the banks could loan out 10 times for
[3:33:05.960 --> 3:33:06.960]  every dollar they had.
[3:33:06.960 --> 3:33:07.960]  That was fiat.
[3:33:07.960 --> 3:33:09.720]  They could buy up the world, dominate with that.
[3:33:09.720 --> 3:33:14.280]  But they decided in the early 90s, go through that for people to just take all restrictions
[3:33:14.280 --> 3:33:19.320]  off and just start making up fake money, fake assets.
[3:33:19.320 --> 3:33:25.320]  They bought up all the key assets with us and they're leaving us the junk and then
[3:33:25.320 --> 3:33:30.800]  militarizing the police as a vanguard to protect them if they're going to call resisting them
[3:33:30.800 --> 3:33:34.360]  or not letting them take your farm or house or kids a crime.
[3:33:34.360 --> 3:33:37.320]  But how do you see this unfolding?
[3:33:37.320 --> 3:33:40.520]  Because they've preemptively tried to bring in a police state to block us.
[3:33:40.520 --> 3:33:45.880]  They've staged terror attacks to get the cowardly mass to huddle around them and give them support
[3:33:45.880 --> 3:33:46.880]  in their evil.
[3:33:46.880 --> 3:33:47.880]  I mean, where is this going?
[3:33:47.880 --> 3:33:50.880]  Well, I think you've described it.
[3:33:50.880 --> 3:33:56.360]  It's going into the streets and it can't help but get there.
[3:33:56.360 --> 3:34:01.360]  And how they've done it financially is via the route of derivatives.
[3:34:01.360 --> 3:34:05.640]  A derivative is like a piece of insurance.
[3:34:05.640 --> 3:34:10.640]  And if you own a bond and you're only interested in the yield and the bond and it's 5%, but
[3:34:10.640 --> 3:34:15.840]  you don't want to take any risk on the bond itself, whether it'll go up or down, you sell
[3:34:15.840 --> 3:34:17.960]  that risk to somebody else.
[3:34:17.960 --> 3:34:22.840]  And there's somebody out there in the derivative market who will take on that risk to protect
[3:34:22.840 --> 3:34:24.240]  you for a price.
[3:34:24.240 --> 3:34:29.960]  And then they pass the Ponzi on to somebody else and even sell that insuring of the instrument.
[3:34:29.960 --> 3:34:30.960]  Exactly.
[3:34:30.960 --> 3:34:33.600]  And it might end up 20 hands later.
[3:34:33.600 --> 3:34:37.280]  So that's just like multi-level marketing, a Ponzi scheme, where you start it and get
[3:34:37.280 --> 3:34:42.400]  20 people, they get 100 people, they get 1,000 people, and the upper end screws everybody
[3:34:42.400 --> 3:34:46.960]  and leaves, but then leaves all the lower 90% holding the bag.
[3:34:46.960 --> 3:34:47.960]  Exactly.
[3:34:47.960 --> 3:34:50.960]  And that's really how it works.
[3:34:50.960 --> 3:34:52.600]  It is a Ponzi scheme.
[3:34:52.600 --> 3:34:58.400]  And that's how they've been holding this whole system together really since 1992.
[3:34:58.400 --> 3:35:01.160]  And of course, it's become bigger and bigger and bigger.
[3:35:01.160 --> 3:35:10.200]  And we have derivatives out in the form of $650 or $700 trillion mind-boggling figures.
[3:35:10.200 --> 3:35:15.960]  And so, yes, they will leave the ship, they'll all go and hide out.
[3:35:15.960 --> 3:35:20.000]  And they think that that's going to save them, and I've got news for them.
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:23.560]  We will find them, and there will be trials for them.
[3:35:23.560 --> 3:35:31.440]  And I think the American people, generally speaking, don't understand anything that's
[3:35:31.440 --> 3:35:33.440]  being done to them.
[3:35:33.440 --> 3:35:38.200]  They're confused, they know something's going on, but they just can't understand it.
[3:35:38.200 --> 3:35:44.040]  And everybody doesn't listen to a program like Alex Jones.
[3:35:44.040 --> 3:35:48.720]  There's a lot of people who just don't know, and it's going to be a revelation to them,
[3:35:48.720 --> 3:35:53.840]  because when this all comes down, and it's in the process of doing so presently, you
[3:35:53.840 --> 3:36:02.360]  look at the unemployment figures, 14.7% long-term, these are government figures, 10.7% intermediate
[3:36:02.360 --> 3:36:05.560]  term unemployment, and short-term unemployment, 6.1%.
[3:36:05.560 --> 3:36:07.560]  Well, here's the problem.
[3:36:07.560 --> 3:36:11.880]  They'll just stage a terror attack right as it fully implodes and claim the Easter Bunny
[3:36:11.880 --> 3:36:16.040]  did it, and these cowards will run up and circle around the government and just sit
[3:36:16.040 --> 3:36:17.040]  there shaking.
[3:36:17.040 --> 3:36:19.880]  Now, I don't see that working, but you know they'll try that.
[3:36:19.880 --> 3:36:23.920]  They do anything to get the cowards to come up and cuddle up under the black wings.
[3:36:23.920 --> 3:36:28.160]  But these people insult us, write us letters, say we're lying, you know, you predicted
[3:36:28.160 --> 3:36:32.920]  Freddie and the whole fanny thing, we predicted everything that's happened, we've laid out
[3:36:32.920 --> 3:36:38.040]  what they were going to do, we've broken it down, they're total criminals, and they're
[3:36:38.040 --> 3:36:44.160]  still about 30% of the public that will buy anything they're told, and I know that they
[3:36:44.160 --> 3:36:48.320]  don't matter in history, except they're going to be the enforcers.
[3:36:48.320 --> 3:36:54.640]  They'll do anything they're told by the establishment, including handing their children over as long
[3:36:54.640 --> 3:36:56.080]  as they get to act cool.
[3:36:56.080 --> 3:37:03.840]  And that's why you have to be very careful who you speak to this about, and also very
[3:37:03.840 --> 3:37:10.440]  careful about venting your feelings about what's going on, because if that happens,
[3:37:10.440 --> 3:37:15.600]  and we have a situation like what the Stasi had in the old East Germany, where everybody
[3:37:15.600 --> 3:37:22.400]  was spying on everybody else, then people will come and pick you up because they'll
[3:37:22.400 --> 3:37:26.920]  tell on you, and of course there will be a reward for that as well.
[3:37:26.920 --> 3:37:31.920]  I mean, the IRS uses the system in the United States now, exactly the same way.
[3:37:31.920 --> 3:37:36.760]  Oh, listen, listen, they're training children, they're training children in every major public
[3:37:36.760 --> 3:37:41.280]  school in the country that we look at, with text messages to turn their parents in, and
[3:37:41.280 --> 3:37:43.520]  neighbors in, and they're running around getting money.
[3:37:43.520 --> 3:37:48.520]  They want to artificially have a bad economy, so they can force this conversion over to
[3:37:48.520 --> 3:37:50.280]  the military industrial complex.
[3:37:50.280 --> 3:37:55.080]  I say speak out like your lives depend on it, to block them, even if they're cowed and
[3:37:55.080 --> 3:37:57.520]  are quiet, they may win.
[3:37:57.520 --> 3:38:01.400]  Do you agree with that, Bob?
[3:38:01.400 --> 3:38:02.400]  Mm-hmm.
[3:38:02.400 --> 3:38:05.800]  My daughter's a teacher, so I know what you're talking about.
[3:38:05.800 --> 3:38:06.800]  It's disgusting.
[3:38:06.800 --> 3:38:10.320]  And, of course, she deviates from the subject.
[3:38:10.320 --> 3:38:13.320]  No, I'm not saying she's disgusting, I'm saying how to cops listening...
[3:38:13.320 --> 3:38:14.800]  No, no, no, no, no, no, I know that.
[3:38:14.800 --> 3:38:19.200]  No, no, but I'm saying how to cops listening think freedom is face scanning cameras and
[3:38:19.200 --> 3:38:21.040]  children spying on their parents.
[3:38:21.040 --> 3:38:22.040]  It isn't, okay?
[3:38:22.040 --> 3:38:23.040]  Go ahead, Bob.
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:29.440]  Yeah, that is not something that should happen in America, but it is happening, and it's
[3:38:29.440 --> 3:38:32.000]  going to be worse in the future.
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:37.800]  If I remember correctly, the United States government hired two or three individuals
[3:38:37.800 --> 3:38:40.440]  who are high up in the government in East Germany...
[3:38:40.440 --> 3:38:41.440]  Yeah, Marcus Wolfe.
[3:38:41.440 --> 3:38:42.440] ...as advisors.
[3:38:42.440 --> 3:38:44.800]  Marcus Wolfe, head of the Stasi, was hired by the...
[3:38:44.800 --> 3:38:47.960]  He just died last year, but he helped set up Homeland Security.
[3:38:47.960 --> 3:38:51.200]  Exactly, but there were two other people.
[3:38:51.200 --> 3:38:52.200]  One of them was from Moscow.
[3:38:52.200 --> 3:38:53.200]  Primikov.
[3:38:53.200 --> 3:38:55.400]  Right, that's right.
[3:38:55.400 --> 3:39:02.160]  And that's where they got the ideas and how to make them work as far as people spying
[3:39:02.160 --> 3:39:08.360]  on one another and putting systems together where people couldn't do much of anything
[3:39:08.360 --> 3:39:10.360]  without government knowing.
[3:39:10.360 --> 3:39:15.400]  I mean, these laws for money laundering is an example.
[3:39:15.400 --> 3:39:21.240]  They want to know where everything is going and how you're doing it.
[3:39:21.240 --> 3:39:25.840]  Something I know the other day went in to buy some money orders, and I think they were
[3:39:25.840 --> 3:39:33.360]  for like $4,700, and the man said, well, we can't do that without you signing and giving
[3:39:33.360 --> 3:39:36.360]  us a copy of your driver's license and all this.
[3:39:36.360 --> 3:39:38.920]  And the man said to him, look, I know you.
[3:39:38.920 --> 3:39:42.120]  You're going to do it my way, and we don't do it at all.
[3:39:42.120 --> 3:39:45.320]  And so the guy said, okay, we'll do it your way.
[3:39:45.320 --> 3:39:48.680]  But if you don't know the guy that's selling the money orders, you've got a problem.
[3:39:48.680 --> 3:39:52.440]  Well, I mean, it's total surveillance, that's a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[3:39:52.440 --> 3:39:57.320]  I see 80-year-old no-exaggeration men buying beer being carted, and they're swiping it.
[3:39:57.320 --> 3:39:58.600]  That's a database.
[3:39:58.600 --> 3:40:00.440]  It's already in place.
[3:40:00.440 --> 3:40:01.440]  Bastards.
[3:40:01.440 --> 3:40:02.440]  That's right.
[3:40:02.440 --> 3:40:06.120]  It's interesting that they're doing that.
[3:40:06.120 --> 3:40:09.440]  I didn't know that.
[3:40:09.440 --> 3:40:14.680]  You know, I don't have credit cards, and I haven't had them for years, but they've become very
[3:40:14.680 --> 3:40:15.680]  dangerous things.
[3:40:15.680 --> 3:40:19.880]  Oh, listen, I go in, people thought it was just zip codes to figure out where to put
[3:40:19.880 --> 3:40:21.960]  stores at a best buy or wherever.
[3:40:21.960 --> 3:40:28.200]  Now you go to pay for, say, $100 worth of videotapes or whatever, or memory sticks.
[3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:31.520]  And they go address a name, same thing at Radio Shack, everywhere else.
[3:40:31.520 --> 3:40:33.160]  That's all for a database.
[3:40:33.160 --> 3:40:36.480]  And I've read the corporate documents going back six, seven years ago where they would
[3:40:36.480 --> 3:40:41.600]  meet for these big conventions where they say we're being given federal mandates and
[3:40:41.600 --> 3:40:42.680]  insurance breaks.
[3:40:42.680 --> 3:40:44.240]  That's how they control them.
[3:40:44.240 --> 3:40:50.120]  That's how it's all standardized to get everyone habitualized to showing ID for all purchases.
[3:40:50.120 --> 3:40:53.920]  It starts with coal medicine, then it's beer, cigarettes, now it's everything.
[3:40:53.920 --> 3:40:58.520]  Now Major Gas Chains wants you to register with your driver's license before you can
[3:40:58.520 --> 3:41:01.120]  use a credit card.
[3:41:01.120 --> 3:41:05.800]  It's a tough place to live nowadays, isn't it, Alex?
[3:41:05.800 --> 3:41:07.360]  Oh, it's freedom.
[3:41:07.360 --> 3:41:08.360]  So much of it.
[3:41:08.360 --> 3:41:10.480]  But the illegal aliens, you know, the poet...
[3:41:10.480 --> 3:41:12.400]  What kind of democracy is that?
[3:41:12.400 --> 3:41:17.120]  Well, the Catholic bishops are saying, don't track, don't trace, don't arrest illegal aliens.
[3:41:17.120 --> 3:41:18.120]  It's of the devil.
[3:41:18.120 --> 3:41:22.440]  But there's been a thousand deaths on one town across the Texas border, hundreds on
[3:41:22.440 --> 3:41:26.920]  this side, bedlam and war, and the cops don't arrest illegals for almost anything.
[3:41:26.920 --> 3:41:28.420]  They admit it.
[3:41:28.420 --> 3:41:33.160]  But the citizens, the book is just thrown at you and you have no bill of rights and
[3:41:33.160 --> 3:41:36.120]  you're more surveilled than East Germany.
[3:41:36.120 --> 3:41:44.360]  And that's absolutely true, and that's why a lot of people are saying, gee, I'm 65 years
[3:41:44.360 --> 3:41:47.200]  old, I'm not going to put up with this, and they leave the country.
[3:41:47.200 --> 3:41:54.120]  I talked to somebody today who said, you know, I'm thinking of going back to the Ukraine.
[3:41:54.120 --> 3:41:58.960]  Oh, I know Greeks, Ukrainians, Poles, Arabs, they're all leaving.
[3:41:58.960 --> 3:42:00.680]  They've been leaving for years.
[3:42:00.680 --> 3:42:04.880]  A lot of Russians said, man, I've seen this before, I'm an anti-communist, I'm getting
[3:42:04.880 --> 3:42:06.440]  the hell out of here.
[3:42:06.440 --> 3:42:11.600]  Well, you know, another thing I've run into, also, I was told yesterday there's a mass
[3:42:11.600 --> 3:42:15.080]  exodus of Russians from Israel going back home.
[3:42:15.080 --> 3:42:16.080]  Yeah.
[3:42:16.080 --> 3:42:17.080]  No, it's everywhere.
[3:42:17.080 --> 3:42:21.480]  I mean, they don't want to be incinerated if they get the Zionist start of war.
[3:42:21.480 --> 3:42:24.240]  The top, there have been several articles.
[3:42:24.240 --> 3:42:29.320]  First one was in the Jerusalem Post, the richest man in Israel moves, leaves, the top richest
[3:42:29.320 --> 3:42:33.400]  10 Jews in Israel in the last six months have left.
[3:42:33.400 --> 3:42:36.760]  Their houses and moved to London and to Switzerland.
[3:42:36.760 --> 3:42:38.760]  I moved to England and Switzerland.
[3:42:38.760 --> 3:42:39.760]  What does that mean?
[3:42:39.760 --> 3:42:42.240]  It means they want to be out of harm's way.
[3:42:42.240 --> 3:42:45.560]  It may not be caused by EMF radiation alone.
[3:42:45.560 --> 3:42:49.520]  Computers and TVs release chemicals into the air, which are inhaled and accumulate in
[3:42:49.520 --> 3:42:50.520]  household.
[3:42:50.520 --> 3:42:51.520]  And they probably are.
[3:42:51.520 --> 3:42:57.040]  I mean, you know, they're part and parcel of what our government does, so there's not
[3:42:57.040 --> 3:42:59.040]  much difference.
[3:42:59.040 --> 3:43:03.240]  I don't think no matter who's elected, there'll be much difference in the future as far as
[3:43:03.240 --> 3:43:04.640]  the Oval Office is concerned.
[3:43:04.640 --> 3:43:08.280]  Hey, Bob, did you just hear that noise over the line?
[3:43:08.280 --> 3:43:09.280]  No.
[3:43:09.280 --> 3:43:11.400]  If I turn this up, I get a broadcast.
[3:43:11.400 --> 3:43:12.400]  Family.
[3:43:12.400 --> 3:43:13.400]  Check out rawair.com.
[3:43:13.400 --> 3:43:14.400]  I don't.
[3:43:14.400 --> 3:43:15.400]  Call.
[3:43:15.400 --> 3:43:16.400]  Yeah.
[3:43:16.400 --> 3:43:17.400]  They're running ads for raw air.
[3:43:17.400 --> 3:43:19.160]  Can you guys turn that off for me, please?
[3:43:19.160 --> 3:43:20.800]  I'd really appreciate that.
[3:43:20.800 --> 3:43:21.800]  6-6-996-7189.
[3:43:21.800 --> 3:43:29.040]  If they don't get it off the air, we'll send somebody next to them.
[3:43:29.040 --> 3:43:30.040]  That's right.
[3:43:30.040 --> 3:43:31.040]  Whatever.
[3:43:31.040 --> 3:43:34.760]  One of those off-duty cops with the special uniforms.
[3:43:34.760 --> 3:43:36.240]  Oh, God, help us.
[3:43:36.240 --> 3:43:40.040]  You know, there's a lot of cops and a lot of government people and a lot of bureaucrats
[3:43:40.040 --> 3:43:43.640]  who think this is all funny and cute, and they send me emails and they say, yeah, we're
[3:43:43.640 --> 3:43:44.640]  going to get you.
[3:43:44.640 --> 3:43:45.640]  We're going to kill you.
[3:43:45.640 --> 3:43:46.640]  We're taking over.
[3:43:46.640 --> 3:43:49.640]  And you'll go to their MySpace, and they're a cop or they're a military, and they're
[3:43:49.640 --> 3:43:50.640]  proud of it.
[3:43:50.640 --> 3:43:52.640]  I mean, a lot of them think this is fun.
[3:43:52.640 --> 3:43:53.880]  They don't know history, do they?
[3:43:53.880 --> 3:43:57.840]  They don't know what they're slated for, both fighting us but also working for this
[3:43:57.840 --> 3:43:58.840]  evil system.
[3:43:58.840 --> 3:44:00.880]  They think it's real cute what they're part of.
[3:44:00.880 --> 3:44:02.760]  It's like a little petty power trip.
[3:44:02.760 --> 3:44:04.360]  We're going to get to do whatever we want.
[3:44:04.360 --> 3:44:05.760]  What do you say to them, Bob?
[3:44:05.760 --> 3:44:10.600]  Well, there's 450 million weapons in the United States.
[3:44:10.600 --> 3:44:19.480]  If we cut the population in half, we probably have about 100 million, perhaps adult males,
[3:44:19.480 --> 3:44:22.440]  over, say, 16 years old.
[3:44:22.440 --> 3:44:26.080]  Probably 70% of them have shot weapons before.
[3:44:26.080 --> 3:44:32.640]  And with 150 million weapons and feeling 50 million people, or even 25 million, or even
[3:44:32.640 --> 3:44:36.920]  5 million, there's going to be no contest.
[3:44:36.920 --> 3:44:40.640]  The kill factor will be very large, perhaps, in the hands of the professionals.
[3:44:40.640 --> 3:44:42.640]  But we're going to win.
[3:44:42.640 --> 3:44:43.640]  Well, the other big...
[3:44:43.640 --> 3:44:44.640]  They cannot win.
[3:44:44.640 --> 3:44:45.640]  It is impossible.
[3:44:45.640 --> 3:44:48.680]  Well, the other big problem is, that's why they have the face scanning cameras and the
[3:44:48.680 --> 3:44:52.560]  tracking grids and the smart dust, and they admit that's Northcom dominance.
[3:44:52.560 --> 3:44:56.080]  You know, it's so incredible to read John Warner, the Defense Authorization Act, or read
[3:44:56.080 --> 3:44:57.240]  Northcom plans.
[3:44:57.240 --> 3:44:58.920]  They say we're the enemy.
[3:44:58.920 --> 3:45:01.160]  They say they work for Wall Street.
[3:45:01.160 --> 3:45:07.080]  They say the military brass lists the American people as enemies.
[3:45:07.080 --> 3:45:12.360]  And I don't think the listeners fully grasp, I mean, they're not even debating it, Bob.
[3:45:12.360 --> 3:45:15.240]  No, they're not.
[3:45:15.240 --> 3:45:18.520]  And they think they're going to do what they want to do, and it's not going to happen that
[3:45:18.520 --> 3:45:19.520]  way.
[3:45:19.520 --> 3:45:27.240]  You know, America is still a sleeping tiger, as far as the populace is concerned.
[3:45:27.240 --> 3:45:31.960]  And again, I think they've underestimated them.
[3:45:31.960 --> 3:45:34.760]  And I think they're going to have serious problems, terminal ones.
[3:45:34.760 --> 3:45:35.760]  All right.
[3:45:35.760 --> 3:45:37.240]  I'm going to skip the final break.
[3:45:37.240 --> 3:45:40.640]  Ted Anderson wants to talk to you off air, so I'll let you talk to him on the show,
[3:45:40.640 --> 3:45:41.640]  Ian's Bob.
[3:45:41.640 --> 3:45:43.800]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[3:45:43.800 --> 3:45:46.360]  Again, cops are going to take your grandma's pension.
[3:45:46.360 --> 3:45:48.240]  They're going to take stuff from your family.
[3:45:48.240 --> 3:45:51.520]  You know, I know you'll strut around at family dinners and kind of go, I don't want to hear
[3:45:51.520 --> 3:45:54.520]  about it, but you're going to be hurt by your system.
[3:45:54.520 --> 3:45:57.360]  You're going to wish to God you'd have fought with the people.
[3:45:57.360 --> 3:45:59.200]  I know a lot of you are planning to.
[3:45:59.200 --> 3:46:06.120]  Jesse in the Netherlands, where the Queen of Orange sits firmly ensconced, getting the
[3:46:06.120 --> 3:46:10.520]  monopoly on Iraqi oil last week, you're on the air, Jesse.
[3:46:10.520 --> 3:46:15.600]  Hey, Alex, everything you've done so far is awesome, and people around the world are
[3:46:15.600 --> 3:46:17.440]  waking up.
[3:46:17.440 --> 3:46:23.360]  When I'm too far away from the United States or any crowded places where I could go and
[3:46:23.360 --> 3:46:28.920]  tell people about what's going on and getting them to tune into your show, I went online
[3:46:28.920 --> 3:46:37.040]  and actually today there's an event in Second Life, which is a virtual world.
[3:46:37.040 --> 3:46:43.400]  And I visited a digital memoriam, 9-11 memoriam, and I had a t-shirt on.
[3:46:43.400 --> 3:46:48.680]  The text on it was, investigate 9-11, 100, fallen by relentless pursuit of truth.
[3:46:48.680 --> 3:46:49.680]  Oh, good.
[3:46:49.680 --> 3:46:52.440]  So you went to this virtual thing that tens of millions are involved in.
[3:46:52.440 --> 3:46:54.840]  How many people were at the memorial?
[3:46:54.840 --> 3:47:02.720]  Well, I've been here all day, and I've seen thousands of avatars passed by.
[3:47:02.720 --> 3:47:07.480]  And well, what then happened was the admin banned me from the land because I was wearing
[3:47:07.480 --> 3:47:09.240]  that t-shirt and giving those t-shirts.
[3:47:09.240 --> 3:47:11.360]  See, I want to write an article about this, Bob.
[3:47:11.360 --> 3:47:15.160]  I'm sure you know about this, there's several virtual realities that tens of millions play
[3:47:15.160 --> 3:47:16.160]  in these games.
[3:47:16.160 --> 3:47:17.160]  It's like they're real.
[3:47:17.160 --> 3:47:21.360]  This is how Matrix Insertion, the Pentagon plans to put us in the pods with this because
[3:47:21.360 --> 3:47:23.680]  the wirehead, that's a new function coming up.
[3:47:23.680 --> 3:47:24.680]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[3:47:24.680 --> 3:47:25.680]  It's all real.
[3:47:25.680 --> 3:47:30.040]  The point is, yes, so you're there, thousands come by and see your t-shirt at the virtual
[3:47:30.040 --> 3:47:31.040]  memorial.
[3:47:31.040 --> 3:47:35.240]  They wanted to run an op inside there, and then the admin banned you because you had
[3:47:35.240 --> 3:47:37.480]  that shirt, outrageous.
[3:47:37.480 --> 3:47:44.200]  We need to invade with the members of that with more shirts right now.
[3:47:44.200 --> 3:47:50.200]  Where is that area where your First Amendment's being violated in virtual reality?
[3:47:50.200 --> 3:47:56.000]  It's named Second Life, and the area name that it's in is actually named World Trade
[3:47:56.000 --> 3:47:57.000]  Center.
[3:47:57.000 --> 3:48:02.280]  Okay, so not only is 9-Eleven Truth banned right around the real World Trade Center,
[3:48:02.280 --> 3:48:04.400]  but in Second Life, they're right now.
[3:48:04.400 --> 3:48:09.240]  Now what did this degenerate admin say when they banned you in virtual reality?
[3:48:09.240 --> 3:48:12.400]  Well, I'll translate it to English for you.
[3:48:12.400 --> 3:48:13.920]  I have it right here in front of me.
[3:48:13.920 --> 3:48:15.360]  My God, this is science fiction.
[3:48:15.360 --> 3:48:18.120]  I mean, we're talking about protesting in virtual reality.
[3:48:18.120 --> 3:48:19.120]  I'm sorry.
[3:48:19.120 --> 3:48:20.120]  Go ahead.
[3:48:20.120 --> 3:48:23.440]  He says you're really looking for it, huh?
[3:48:23.440 --> 3:48:29.320]  I think it's very nasty of you to act so innocent and then walk around here annoying the people
[3:48:29.320 --> 3:48:31.680]  with your conspiracy theories.
[3:48:31.680 --> 3:48:37.560]  I'm going to report you to Lyndon Labs who runs Second Life, of course, who banned you
[3:48:37.560 --> 3:48:41.400]  from my sin, and now you're muted, goodbye.
[3:48:41.400 --> 3:48:47.480]  So just like in the real world, oh, can't wear your 9-Eleven Inside Job shirt.
[3:48:47.480 --> 3:48:50.480]  You could have a pierced nose or a devil tat.
[3:48:50.480 --> 3:48:54.200]  That's okay, but don't actually really be the individualistic.
[3:48:54.200 --> 3:48:56.360]  Bob Chapman, what do you think of this?
[3:48:56.360 --> 3:49:02.960]  It's something that I didn't expect, and it will progressively get worse, and they will
[3:49:02.960 --> 3:49:08.920]  pick up more and more people and impound them and get all their information and warn them
[3:49:08.920 --> 3:49:12.600]  if they picked up again, they won't be heard from again.
[3:49:12.600 --> 3:49:16.920]  And that's what they're going to go about, particularly with young people, because young
[3:49:16.920 --> 3:49:23.040]  people are generally in better physical condition than adults, and young people become combatants
[3:49:23.040 --> 3:49:24.040]  much more easily.
[3:49:24.040 --> 3:49:29.520]  What about the Alexander Shultz and Itza quote about when the Gestapo or the GRU, you know,
[3:49:29.520 --> 3:49:32.680]  oh, how we burned in the camps wishing that when the secret police came out to grab us,
[3:49:32.680 --> 3:49:35.440]  we would have met them with hatchets in the doorways.
[3:49:35.440 --> 3:49:39.200]  Well, maybe that will come to that in our country.
[3:49:39.200 --> 3:49:41.560]  Does that ever happen in the virtual reality, Sims?
[3:49:41.560 --> 3:49:44.960]  Do people ever go wild there?
[3:49:44.960 --> 3:49:45.960]  Jesse?
[3:49:45.960 --> 3:49:55.600]  Well, yeah, it certainly happens, and my idea to basically get the people informed was to
[3:49:55.600 --> 3:50:01.520]  get more listeners who listen to your show to get on Second Life, and if I'm allowed
[3:50:01.520 --> 3:50:07.400]  to give out my avatar name so that people can talk to me, it's 9-Eleven Truth, and the
[3:50:07.400 --> 3:50:09.960]  last name of the avatar is Sky Tower.
[3:50:09.960 --> 3:50:14.200]  9-Eleven Truth, Sky Power, everybody who's in Second Life, and I know you're out there
[3:50:14.200 --> 3:50:16.680]  saying Attack, Pattern, Delta, go now.
[3:50:16.680 --> 3:50:22.920]  Let's get all the 9-Eleven information we can in there and take over right now in that
[3:50:22.920 --> 3:50:25.240]  virtual reality area immediately.
[3:50:25.240 --> 3:50:28.800]  We're going to skip this break, final segment, better get over to infowars.com, folks, to
[3:50:28.800 --> 3:50:29.800]  listen.
[3:50:29.800 --> 3:50:30.800]  Every...
[3:50:30.800 --> 3:50:31.800]  All right, thank you.
[3:50:31.800 --> 3:50:36.080]  I want to move through these calls quick, but Jesse in the Netherlands, this is science
[3:50:36.080 --> 3:50:37.080]  fiction.
[3:50:37.080 --> 3:50:38.080]  We're in the future.
[3:50:38.080 --> 3:50:42.080]  I mean, we're virtual reality on the web, and I am an FM, both Old World, New World,
[3:50:42.080 --> 3:50:46.080]  and where people are being banned in virtual reality with tens of millions.
[3:50:46.080 --> 3:50:47.080]  How many...
[3:50:47.080 --> 3:50:51.320]  I know it's tens of millions now that are in Second Life.
[3:50:51.320 --> 3:50:54.280]  How many are part of Second Life, Jesse?
[3:50:54.280 --> 3:50:56.600]  Let's see.
[3:50:56.600 --> 3:51:04.560]  Logged on in the last 60 days are 1,132,474 avatars, and at this moment, there are 60,000
[3:51:04.560 --> 3:51:05.560]  online.
[3:51:05.560 --> 3:51:07.360]  Okay, there's another one that's bigger then.
[3:51:07.360 --> 3:51:09.360]  What's the other one?
[3:51:09.360 --> 3:51:11.360]  Excuse me?
[3:51:11.360 --> 3:51:14.360]  There's a bunch of other games, aren't there?
[3:51:14.360 --> 3:51:15.360]  There...
[3:51:15.360 --> 3:51:17.880]  I didn't quite get that, Alex.
[3:51:17.880 --> 3:51:18.880]  Well, okay, I appreciate your call.
[3:51:18.880 --> 3:51:22.000]  My point is, there's some other ones that are bigger, some other virtual reality games.
[3:51:22.000 --> 3:51:23.000]  I've seen their numbers.
[3:51:23.000 --> 3:51:26.400]  Okay, let's take another call here.
[3:51:26.400 --> 3:51:28.240]  Let's talk to Paula in Canada.
[3:51:28.240 --> 3:51:29.320]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[3:51:29.320 --> 3:51:30.320]  Go ahead.
[3:51:30.320 --> 3:51:31.320]  Hi, Alex.
[3:51:31.320 --> 3:51:32.320]  I'm calling from Canada.
[3:51:32.320 --> 3:51:34.960]  I'm seeing my three children listen to you with my husband as well.
[3:51:34.960 --> 3:51:35.960]  Welcome.
[3:51:35.960 --> 3:51:40.160]  We followed you for about 11 years now, and for the Truth 911 movement, my husband and
[3:51:40.160 --> 3:51:43.240]  I did two websites, and I'm printing t-shirts.
[3:51:43.240 --> 3:51:49.200]  We've given out about 500 DVDs to expose the government, basically, because I want to deprogram
[3:51:49.200 --> 3:51:54.360]  my family, my friends, my parents, everybody that I've been around in my life.
[3:51:54.360 --> 3:51:58.600]  I've dropped my feminist career, turned my back as a Canadian athlete, I've turned my
[3:51:58.600 --> 3:52:04.840]  back as a police officer, I've turned my back as a model, I've turned my back on everything.
[3:52:04.840 --> 3:52:05.840]  Wow.
[3:52:05.840 --> 3:52:06.840]  Basically.
[3:52:06.840 --> 3:52:08.120]  I can't do it anymore, Alex.
[3:52:08.120 --> 3:52:09.520]  I've done it for years.
[3:52:09.520 --> 3:52:12.160]  I'd rather be a mother and a motivational speaker.
[3:52:12.160 --> 3:52:18.520]  I did my first movie in 1998, Reluctant Angel in Toronto, and as I did that about three
[3:52:18.520 --> 3:52:22.520]  years ago or four years ago, approximately, I had a fallout.
[3:52:22.520 --> 3:52:25.880]  I had to contact a lady named Janet Hall in the States.
[3:52:25.880 --> 3:52:28.280]  She's best friends with Jeff Rents.
[3:52:28.280 --> 3:52:32.760]  She's a microbiologist who had to do a study on me, because I had a massive lesion exploding
[3:52:32.760 --> 3:52:34.520]  in my spinal cord.
[3:52:34.520 --> 3:52:36.600]  She told me that was from Chemtrails.
[3:52:36.600 --> 3:52:37.600]  More gallons.
[3:52:37.600 --> 3:52:42.080]  Oh, yeah, it was more gallons, basically, it was up the line of more gallons.
[3:52:42.080 --> 3:52:46.640]  I've survived quadriplegia, thank God, for my background and my training, and I've gone
[3:52:46.640 --> 3:52:47.920]  through a detox.
[3:52:47.920 --> 3:52:52.640]  I've basically survived to live through a criminal trial, and I've been at doctors and
[3:52:52.640 --> 3:52:57.160]  lawyers, and I've been confronting judges and crowns and telling them what kind of
[3:52:57.160 --> 3:52:59.120]  mason system that we've been living under.
[3:52:59.120 --> 3:53:02.600]  I mean, I've basically been allowed to say everything I need to say, even on a stand
[3:53:02.600 --> 3:53:06.560]  in a trial, confront people, let them know that I'm not happy with this.
[3:53:06.560 --> 3:53:07.560]  Good.
[3:53:07.560 --> 3:53:08.560]  Good job.
[3:53:08.560 --> 3:53:09.560]  Good job.
[3:53:09.560 --> 3:53:10.560]  Anything else?
[3:53:10.560 --> 3:53:11.560]  Yes, Alex.
[3:53:11.560 --> 3:53:12.560]  For six years, I've homeschooled my kids.
[3:53:12.560 --> 3:53:13.560]  Good.
[3:53:13.560 --> 3:53:14.560]  I will not vaccinate them.
[3:53:14.560 --> 3:53:15.560]  Good.
[3:53:15.560 --> 3:53:16.560]  I'll not let women tell me what to do.
[3:53:16.560 --> 3:53:20.200]  And basically, to all the women today, I want you to stand up today.
[3:53:20.200 --> 3:53:22.640]  I want you to say something and back your husband.
[3:53:22.640 --> 3:53:24.320]  I want you to back your families.
[3:53:24.320 --> 3:53:27.840]  I want you to stand behind Alex Jones, because we have for many years.
[3:53:27.840 --> 3:53:28.840]  Now, that's what they want.
[3:53:28.840 --> 3:53:32.760]  They want to break up the families, and they get the men to act bad, the women to act
[3:53:32.760 --> 3:53:33.760]  bad.
[3:53:33.760 --> 3:53:34.760]  Folks, you're all under attack.
[3:53:34.760 --> 3:53:35.760]  Stick together.
[3:53:35.760 --> 3:53:36.760]  You've got your family.
[3:53:36.760 --> 3:53:37.760]  It's us against them.
[3:53:37.760 --> 3:53:38.760]  Thank you for the call.
[3:53:38.760 --> 3:53:40.760]  Let's go back live to the full transmission.
[3:53:40.760 --> 3:53:48.120]  Bob, you know, the establishment goes after our families, but if you just explain to your
[3:53:48.120 --> 3:53:50.760]  family, don't you know the family's under attack?
[3:53:50.760 --> 3:53:52.720]  It's only us we can trust.
[3:53:52.720 --> 3:53:57.640]  That's what keeps families together, and that is so important, Bob.
[3:53:57.640 --> 3:54:00.560]  How important is the family?
[3:54:00.560 --> 3:54:04.360]  It is the reason for existence.
[3:54:04.360 --> 3:54:05.360]  Absolutely.
[3:54:05.360 --> 3:54:09.880]  So stop fighting with your husband and wife if your wife's being mean to you and arrogant.
[3:54:09.880 --> 3:54:10.880]  Stop fighting with her.
[3:54:10.880 --> 3:54:12.800]  Get to the level of explaining to her the big picture.
[3:54:12.800 --> 3:54:15.440]  If your husband's doing it, you know, stop it.
[3:54:15.440 --> 3:54:16.840]  Stop fighting with each other.
[3:54:16.840 --> 3:54:17.840]  Stop it.
[3:54:17.840 --> 3:54:18.840]  Don't use drugs.
[3:54:18.840 --> 3:54:20.720]  Don't get in their debt system.
[3:54:20.720 --> 3:54:21.720]  Beat them.
[3:54:21.720 --> 3:54:24.320]  You beat them by living well, as the French say.
[3:54:24.320 --> 3:54:25.800]  The best revenge is living well.
[3:54:25.800 --> 3:54:27.200]  Paula, thanks for the call.
[3:54:27.200 --> 3:54:28.200]  Helen in Florida.
[3:54:28.200 --> 3:54:29.200]  I've got to move quick here.
[3:54:29.200 --> 3:54:31.200]  Helen, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[3:54:31.200 --> 3:54:36.400]  Yes, three quick statements and one question, first, Jesus did not appear to let us become
[3:54:36.400 --> 3:54:37.400]  extinct.
[3:54:37.400 --> 3:54:42.400]  The second one is, Rabbi Israel, wife of Israel, now is not the Israel that's predicted in
[3:54:42.400 --> 3:54:43.400]  the Bible.
[3:54:43.400 --> 3:54:45.240]  The Orthodox Jews say that.
[3:54:45.240 --> 3:54:47.680]  And then I wish there were more Jack McLams.
[3:54:47.680 --> 3:54:53.080]  And then my question is, do you anticipate when the precious metals will go up or down?
[3:54:53.080 --> 3:54:55.240]  Okay, thank you.
[3:54:55.240 --> 3:54:59.160]  Obviously they're trying to suppress them, but long term it's only going to go up if
[3:54:59.160 --> 3:55:01.760]  they're devaluing the dollar, bailing all this out.
[3:55:01.760 --> 3:55:02.760]  That's the reality.
[3:55:02.760 --> 3:55:05.080]  Bob, how long can they suspend reality?
[3:55:05.080 --> 3:55:07.840]  I mean, how long can they suppress metals?
[3:55:07.840 --> 3:55:11.360]  Well, I think it goes with a number of other things.
[3:55:11.360 --> 3:55:12.640]  They're trying to hold the market up.
[3:55:12.640 --> 3:55:15.960]  They're trying to make the dollar go higher.
[3:55:15.960 --> 3:55:21.760]  And the reason for that is to portend strength, because I think that they're going to lower
[3:55:21.760 --> 3:55:24.120]  interest rates here very shortly.
[3:55:24.120 --> 3:55:26.440]  Most people don't, but I do.
[3:55:26.440 --> 3:55:32.000]  And gold is going through a correction, which has been caused by government in part.
[3:55:32.000 --> 3:55:35.320]  They get the ball rolling and they stoke it all the time.
[3:55:35.320 --> 3:55:39.800]  And I think that we're nearing probably the bottom in the gold market.
[3:55:39.800 --> 3:55:42.240]  There's a good chance of that.
[3:55:42.240 --> 3:55:47.360]  Corrections are normal, although gold and silver were not overpriced, like commodities
[3:55:47.360 --> 3:55:48.600]  were.
[3:55:48.600 --> 3:55:55.200]  And so I think in the long term, if you want gold and silver-related assets, you keep them.
[3:55:55.200 --> 3:56:00.720]  This would be a very good opportunity when gold and silver have come down substantially,
[3:56:00.720 --> 3:56:03.880]  along with the shears, to pick them up.
[3:56:03.880 --> 3:56:10.400]  Now, bottom line, they can have paper money artificially worth something, but they can
[3:56:10.400 --> 3:56:13.520]  artificially devalue metal.
[3:56:13.520 --> 3:56:16.160]  But in reality, metal has the real value.
[3:56:16.160 --> 3:56:21.520]  And historically, if you look at it on a graph, it always only goes up with inflation.
[3:56:21.520 --> 3:56:24.400]  And so you've got something that's an emergency backup.
[3:56:24.400 --> 3:56:25.840]  I've bought gold at 300.
[3:56:25.840 --> 3:56:27.120]  I've bought gold at 1,000.
[3:56:27.120 --> 3:56:29.840]  I've just kept it all, the little bit I've gotten in silver.
[3:56:29.840 --> 3:56:34.600]  It doesn't matter to me because I know it's real and it's an insurance policy.
[3:56:34.600 --> 3:56:36.200]  And that's what it's all about.
[3:56:36.200 --> 3:56:37.840]  Do I feel good about the $300 gold?
[3:56:37.840 --> 3:56:38.840]  Yes.
[3:56:38.840 --> 3:56:40.120]  Do I feel bad about the $1,000 gold?
[3:56:40.120 --> 3:56:42.360]  No, because it's all real.
[3:56:42.360 --> 3:56:43.680]  It's based on reality.
[3:56:43.680 --> 3:56:47.200]  Theinternationalforecaster.com or two.
[3:56:47.200 --> 3:56:48.200]  Okay.
[3:56:48.200 --> 3:56:56.800]  Before I end this transmission, I just want to remind the listeners that A, retransmission
[3:56:56.800 --> 3:57:06.600]  starts with Ralph Nader and some of the other guests we had on were amazing today.
[3:57:06.600 --> 3:57:09.200]  At the end of the show, in about one minute, we just come right back.
[3:57:09.200 --> 3:57:12.600]  But you've got to be on the infowars.com audio streams.
[3:57:12.600 --> 3:57:13.600]  The only place.
[3:57:13.600 --> 3:57:18.360]  And this will be another thing, infowars.com, if you want to hear any of that key info
[3:57:18.360 --> 3:57:20.880]  and reports from Ground Zero right at the first of the show.
[3:57:20.880 --> 3:57:23.360]  Really important info at the streams at infowars.com.
[3:57:23.360 --> 3:57:24.600]  Don't forget the free podcast.
[3:57:24.600 --> 3:57:30.520]  If you're listening to us on the AM and FM dial, be sure and tell folks about how they
[3:57:30.520 --> 3:57:32.240]  can listen on the local station.
[3:57:32.240 --> 3:57:36.280]  And don't forget I'm a filmmaker and our new film is out.
[3:57:36.280 --> 3:57:37.280]  Fabled enemies.
[3:57:37.280 --> 3:57:38.280]  Get it.
[3:57:38.280 --> 3:57:39.280]  God bless you all.
[3:57:39.280 --> 3:57:43.560]  I'm Ralph Nader, infowars.com.
