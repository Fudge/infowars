[01:57.960 --> 02:03.560]  David Schmecker coming up in the second hour for 30 minutes and then I've got
[02:03.560 --> 02:07.880]  something that's a little bit fun but it's also painful and I don't normally
[02:07.880 --> 02:14.680]  cover goofy things unless it's educates people and I heard last week hey Alex
[02:14.680 --> 02:20.400]  cover the reptoid secret service agent and I didn't even go look it up I'm
[02:20.400 --> 02:25.320]  like no I have serious things to do I was just talking to a senior secret
[02:25.320 --> 02:35.700]  service person the other day amazing anyway side issue and so people kept
[02:35.700 --> 02:41.400]  sending me the video so I happen to watch it yesterday afternoon we're gonna
[02:41.400 --> 02:47.240]  be playing it coming up and I went I've seen that guy before the one they're
[02:47.240 --> 02:53.240]  saying is a reptoid he says extremely male features and I've seen that guy
[02:53.240 --> 03:00.480]  before that's a secret service agents that's spoken out and ladies and gentlemen
[03:00.480 --> 03:07.320]  I snap my fingers for about 20 minutes doing a search on YouTube and guess what
[03:07.320 --> 03:11.800]  ladies and gentlemen I found him and we've got his name and he is a guy that
[03:11.800 --> 03:19.040]  quit and spoke out for the second amendment and it's probably a Psyop
[03:19.040 --> 03:24.160]  against him or something the point is is that then Glenn Beck gets in on the
[03:24.160 --> 03:27.960]  game and I'm trying to not attack Glenn Beck okay even though he's done dirty
[03:27.960 --> 03:33.280]  tricks to me behind the scenes and stuff obviously sees me as competition man I
[03:33.280 --> 03:35.960]  wish there were 50 Glenn Becks that were actually fighting the New World Order
[03:35.960 --> 03:39.600]  I mean I get other talk show hosts on like Michael Savage and George Norrie to
[03:39.600 --> 03:44.480]  promote them because they'll talk about real issues I don't sit here attacking
[03:44.480 --> 03:50.080]  Rush Limbaugh I don't sit here attacking bellow Riley and people just not what I
[03:50.080 --> 03:52.360]  do
[03:55.040 --> 04:04.760]  but every time there's my mouse every time I watch something he's doing I mean I
[04:04.760 --> 04:10.600]  could see the scripting there you know Alex Joan you piece of garbage I don't
[04:10.600 --> 04:18.160]  know what your deal is I really don't know and I don't care you don't know
[04:18.160 --> 04:23.680]  what my deal is you jackass when you have been trying to hold me down for at
[04:23.680 --> 04:29.600]  least six years I mean I've talked to your confidants famous people every time
[04:29.600 --> 04:33.600]  you get around some famous person you start running me down and saying people
[04:33.600 --> 04:36.960]  shouldn't come on my show and you blocked me from going on Fox as a guess
[04:36.960 --> 04:40.920]  one time when I was there for that you jerk but that's not the issue he goes
[04:40.920 --> 04:45.280]  oh they believe in reptoids and the Bilderberg group and the Illuminati and
[04:45.280 --> 04:50.200]  the New World Order I mean he's basically the ADL that's why they've
[04:50.200 --> 04:55.000]  given him so much attention as the opposition I mean you know you're
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.560]  probably like a Hal Turner he probably got a high-level national security

[08:30.480 --> 08:37.400]  2013 global broadcast I am your host Alex Jones a David Schmecker a
[08:37.400 --> 08:42.480]  honorably discharged businessman with no criminal record and no psychiatric
[08:42.480 --> 08:47.280]  record was kidnapped by the government and his guns taken after a
[08:47.280 --> 08:52.360]  psychiatric evaluation every veteran in the US is getting two different letters
[08:52.360 --> 08:56.280]  they're getting one or the other or both in some cases and we've opened the phones
[08:56.280 --> 08:59.280]  up you've heard the callers call in the veterans they've all gotten the letters
[08:59.280 --> 09:05.520]  every veteran I know has gotten the letter Jakari Jackson's dad who's a
[09:05.520 --> 09:11.640]  military veteran has gotten the letter and they are telling them come in for
[09:11.640 --> 09:16.600]  your well-check and you're gonna get a psychological evaluation and if you say
[09:16.600 --> 09:22.080]  that you've been down in any way your guns are gone and in fact some people
[09:22.080 --> 09:28.480]  don't even say that they're taking your guns so incredible Nazi like Soviet
[09:28.480 --> 09:33.360]  like authoritarian like purge of the veterans because the globalist
[09:33.360 --> 09:37.440]  absolutely hate your guts because they know your patriotic even though you've
[09:37.440 --> 09:40.640]  been misguided in some of these wars and things no one can doubt your patriotism
[09:40.640 --> 09:44.720]  and the fact that your men and women and that you're willing to fight and the
[09:44.720 --> 09:50.960]  criminals are scared of that and in every authoritarian takeover there is a
[09:50.960 --> 10:00.800]  purge there is a purge of the last generation of veterans and police it
[10:00.800 --> 10:07.760]  always happens fascist socialist communist you can in kleptocracies like
[10:07.760 --> 10:15.920]  Mexico this is what goes on and we're gonna be breaking that down here today
[10:15.920 --> 10:21.360]  now let's go ahead and let me just give you some of the headlines some of the
[10:21.360 --> 10:26.520]  stacks here we're gonna be covering here in the broadcast today poll almost one
[10:26.520 --> 10:31.520]  third of Americans believe in New World Order and that's out of the pro Obama
[10:31.520 --> 10:36.720]  outfit the public policy polling a group that actually refused even let us
[10:36.720 --> 10:42.000]  survey a poll with them with that we were gonna do as a test and the questions
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.560]  will it will go over some of later are completely sniveling and designed to
[10:46.560 --> 10:51.360]  make you answer no but it says that around a third believe in a world
[10:51.360 --> 10:55.840]  government conspiracy and a New World Order folks I have every world leader
[10:55.840 --> 10:59.840]  out there basically calling for a world government and saying that's a New World
[10:59.840 --> 11:06.680]  Order I have Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan bragging that they have established
[11:06.680 --> 11:11.600]  that and so really out on the street it's more like 80% of people I talked to
[11:11.600 --> 11:15.200]  know about the global government now I mean you know that even if somebody is
[11:15.200 --> 11:18.680]  in a wake they know that global corporations are running the show and
[11:18.680 --> 11:23.840]  globalism and they've heard the call for global government when I say 80% around
[11:23.840 --> 11:28.960]  50% know what's going on from my own on the street surveys and think it's bad the
[11:28.960 --> 11:38.720]  other 30% or so of the 80% to 90% they say of course world government's coming
[11:38.720 --> 11:43.440]  collectivism is a good thing and the natural system is to have a world
[11:43.440 --> 11:48.280]  government and then I'll argue with them about the fact okay so we go from
[11:48.280 --> 11:54.040]  agrarian to city-states to nations to empires to global government this is an
[11:54.040 --> 11:57.960]  unelected on accountable global bureaucracy run by six megabanks that
[11:57.960 --> 12:01.960]  control the issuance of currency and credit we don't need to go there this
[12:01.960 --> 12:07.680]  is a really bad situation nations are like firewalls or bulkheads in a ship
[12:07.680 --> 12:12.000]  so that fire or water can't flood the whole thing if there's a breach and
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.200]  without an exception they they usually say oh don't try to show off with big
[12:19.200 --> 12:25.920]  words fancy pants you're just mad the Republicans lost and I go listen both
[12:25.920 --> 12:29.840]  major parties in every country that are controlled by globalist are controlled
[12:29.840 --> 12:35.560]  and that's how they control us I want liberty collectivism brings nightmare
[12:35.560 --> 12:40.400]  societies where even if you get nice collectivism at first bad guys then
[12:40.400 --> 12:44.720]  take over and it creates a living hell that's the cycle you can have a
[12:44.720 --> 12:48.880]  philosopher king that redistributes and sometimes you have a golden age for a
[12:48.880 --> 12:54.440]  few decades I'll be honest that has happened but it always degenerates into
[12:54.440 --> 13:00.200]  hell on earth shortly after because criminals get the idea they can get
[13:00.200 --> 13:04.640]  control and they do take over and the paramilitary force that the egalitarian
[13:04.640 --> 13:08.640]  uses to dominate and bring in their system you know to break a few eggs to
[13:08.640 --> 13:13.640]  make the omelet people are always penalized and enslaved to build this
[13:13.640 --> 13:18.320]  so-called utopia the enforcers then take over that's why third world
[13:18.320 --> 13:21.000]  countries can never get their act together even though they have incredible
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.200]  resources and interesting cultures and they literally smile at you and say
[13:26.200 --> 13:32.480]  oh you're mad we're taking over you lost you lost because they really
[13:32.480 --> 13:36.680]  associate their personal power with the power structure and I'm gonna shoot a
[13:36.680 --> 13:41.240]  special report after the show tonight we're gonna show clips of the globalist
[13:41.240 --> 13:45.920]  calling for world government calling for I mean there's hundreds of these a
[13:45.920 --> 13:50.040]  describing corporate tyranny the Davos Switzerland group calling for it
[13:50.040 --> 13:54.440]  Bilderberg internal minutes that we've gotten out of the National Archives from
[13:54.440 --> 14:00.600]  our boffins all of this and I'm gonna show the media saying it doesn't exist
[14:00.600 --> 14:05.640]  and then show the media saying world government run by private banks is what's
[14:05.640 --> 14:09.920]  happening but it's a good thing and we've played these clips before but I
[14:09.920 --> 14:12.960]  want to do an actual report with like I don't know we'll be conservative maybe
[14:12.960 --> 14:17.960]  15 clips of calling for new world order global government calling for world
[14:17.960 --> 14:22.720]  government and defining it defining world order as a world government
[14:22.720 --> 14:27.800]  global governance and admitting the banking crisis of 08 is to usher in the
[14:27.800 --> 14:32.400]  world government implosion of all nation states with a new global XM Bank
[14:32.400 --> 14:36.720]  based out of the euro with the IMF World Bank and Private Federal Reserve I
[14:36.720 --> 14:42.040]  mean it's all in policy reports Dave and we're gonna show you I mean Paul
[14:42.040 --> 14:48.320]  Watson's article breaks a bunch of this down where bankers declared that they
[14:48.320 --> 14:57.120]  have conquered the United States and Europe we're going to be you basically
[14:57.120 --> 15:00.560]  showing those clips that are in that article in this piece I'm gonna put
[15:00.560 --> 15:04.840]  together this afternoon with Rob do and Darren McBreen and then we're gonna
[15:04.840 --> 15:09.160]  premiere it on the nightly news tonight or they may stay up late doing it
[15:09.160 --> 15:14.020]  either way we're gonna air it on the radio tomorrow here on the radio Mike
[15:14.020 --> 15:17.120]  Adams is coming in with a bunch of breaking news and real ways to fight
[15:17.120 --> 15:21.400]  back against the tyrants and then he will play the ten minute reporter so
[15:21.400 --> 15:25.360]  we'll try to keep it down to about ten minutes here on the broadcast tomorrow so
[15:25.360 --> 15:28.360]  it may premiere tonight but regardless it'll air tomorrow for the full radio
[15:28.360 --> 15:34.560]  audience but I'm gonna shoot for tonight to make it short and sweet in fact I had
[15:34.560 --> 15:39.400]  my whole stack here and I was back there did I give that to the crew now here it
[15:39.400 --> 15:43.520]  is here's just some of the stack that I printed off this morning that I wanted
[15:43.520 --> 15:50.720]  them to add to their article document cam police the Vatican calls for world
[15:50.720 --> 15:55.480]  government Forbes and then it's got the text calling for global government
[15:55.480 --> 16:03.840]  based on the Europe bankers declare US Europe conquered this has more than 18
[16:03.840 --> 16:09.880]  video links and text links with world leaders admitting their plan for a
[16:09.880 --> 16:13.320]  private corporate world government bankers declare US and Europe conquered
[16:13.320 --> 16:16.880]  world government now an open secret I'm gonna call Paul Watson up I think I'm
[16:16.880 --> 16:24.480]  gonna have him add to the article he did today where they're coming out and
[16:24.480 --> 16:28.200]  saying oh a third of Americans you know believe in a new world order oh how
[16:28.200 --> 16:32.040]  terrible they're such cooks I mean I guess a third of Americans that responded
[16:32.040 --> 16:37.080]  to your jilted survey which was made to make people look stupid that are aware
[16:37.080 --> 16:42.640]  of the governing system of the planet that happens to be authoritarian those
[16:42.640 --> 16:46.600]  are people that happen to have been actually well-informed but you have to
[16:46.600 --> 16:50.480]  be hiding under a rock to not know what's happening I mean here it is
[16:50.480 --> 16:58.200]  Goldman Sachs rules the world Bank of England next and then it's got links to
[16:58.200 --> 17:01.560]  all the mainstream news articles where they declare that private banks have
[17:01.560 --> 17:07.400]  conquered us through fraud hope calls for global authority on the economy that
[17:07.400 --> 17:12.640]  is Reuters but it doesn't exist World Bank president admits agenda for global

[17:38.760 --> 17:41.640]  dismantle middle-class build world government with actual links to them
[17:41.640 --> 17:49.960]  saying in Fox News Danish text of the treaty report third of US West Coast hit
[17:49.960 --> 17:55.240]  with thyroid problems that's another one of our top stories we're gonna be getting
[17:55.240 --> 18:02.200]  here today but but see this is about what did Jim Carrey do a few weeks ago
[18:02.200 --> 18:05.440]  and he's now threatening to sue the media Fox News and others have you
[18:05.440 --> 18:08.360]  criticizing doesn't believe in the first minute either he's an authoritarian
[18:08.360 --> 18:13.800]  mental patient I mean it's on record the guy locks himself in dark rooms for days
[18:13.800 --> 18:18.280]  he I mean he's completely out of his mind Buzz Bissinger who says he wants me
[18:18.280 --> 18:22.920]  killed and the host of the show and CNN agreed yeah let's kill Alex Jones I
[18:22.920 --> 18:28.280]  would be arrested if I said that spent six hundred thousand dollars a year he
[18:28.280 --> 18:35.320]  admits on women's clothing and again Buzz I'm not even judging you for like
[18:35.320 --> 18:39.040]  you dress up in women's clothing I understand that's trendy it's just the
[18:39.040 --> 18:42.160]  six hundred thousand dollars well that's some conspicuous consumption and then
[18:42.160 --> 18:45.720]  you're bragging about your options I mean the point is these are a bunch of
[18:45.720 --> 18:49.920]  lunatics and what did he do in the piece where they demonize Charlton
[18:49.920 --> 18:54.000]  Heston they have the crowd for five minutes laugh at Charlton Heston that
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.560]  Jim Carrey's playing and people watch them go I don't want to get laughed at
[18:57.560 --> 19:02.400]  I better turn my gun in and that's what the media does in all these sitcoms
[19:02.400 --> 19:06.720]  dramas cop shows but new shows as well they make fun of people and demonize
[19:06.720 --> 19:11.280]  people who believe in a global corporate governance I mean exactly what the
[19:11.280 --> 19:16.480]  old-timers 50 years ago at the John Birch Society said was coming has now
[19:16.480 --> 19:26.400]  come and it's now here and the media then just laughs at us and says it doesn't
[19:26.400 --> 19:29.840]  exist and that's the same thing here I have a clip of Glenn Beck covering this
[19:29.840 --> 19:33.680]  laughing at people that believe in the Bilderberg group in a limonade and he
[19:33.680 --> 19:41.240]  laughs and says it doesn't exist this is days ago last week and I'm not
[19:41.240 --> 19:44.920]  here to bash Glenn Beck but I mean that's pure gatekeeping bull
[19:44.920 --> 19:51.240]  Glenn Beck wants you to believe the world government is only George Soros when
[19:51.240 --> 19:57.920]  it's Bill Gates it's all of them okay and that's why he's attacking me we'll

[24:50.240 --> 25:06.720]  get to the news here in a moment crank up Ted for a minute I don't want to call
[25:06.720 --> 25:11.680]  the new old orders bluff because they've got contingencies for that and it's
[25:11.680 --> 25:18.960]  gonna kill a lot of people but if they try to have a hard hot takeover of this
[25:18.960 --> 25:30.920]  country following a bunch of staged false flags that is the better course it
[25:30.920 --> 25:37.080]  is the lesser of two evils and I don't believe in the lesser of two evils
[25:37.080 --> 25:43.560]  unless you're only presented with that and you have no other choice and that's
[25:43.560 --> 25:49.840]  why in just the last few years there have been 70 plus million background
[25:49.840 --> 25:56.280]  checks when people buying firearms out there they know who the enemy is they
[25:56.280 --> 26:00.880]  know there's been a takeover they turn on any sitcom or drama or cop show and
[26:00.880 --> 26:05.200]  see the founding fathers and Liberty and families and men and gun ownership
[26:05.200 --> 26:09.600]  demonized people aren't stupid the over-the-topness of the globalist
[26:09.600 --> 26:15.840]  propaganda has been and will be there undoing all right let me just again I
[26:15.840 --> 26:19.680]  just looked at one headline and went off a rabbit trail for 12 minutes on that
[26:19.680 --> 26:29.400]  let me just try to give you the headlines again here let me just try try as
[26:29.400 --> 26:35.520]  best I can the magnitude of these headlines I spent an hour this morning
[26:35.520 --> 26:40.320]  reading this one article and following the links wishing it wasn't true this
[26:40.320 --> 26:45.280]  news is so incredible that there should be a anyone who loves their children I've
[26:45.280 --> 26:48.760]  got to just give me the public service announcement there needs to be a well
[26:48.760 --> 26:55.080]  it's too late now an evacuation from the west coast and it shows you how humans
[26:55.080 --> 27:00.360]  will just sit there and kill themselves to live and I knew the numbers when I
[27:00.360 --> 27:07.320]  had top radiologist and nuclear experts on at the time I knew the numbers a year
[27:07.320 --> 27:11.000]  and a half two years ago how long ago was Fukushima and I knew that there would
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.360]  be quite a bit of radiation coming down over Texas actually but nothing
[27:14.360 --> 27:17.520]  compared to the west coast and of course it turned out that the federal
[27:17.520 --> 27:23.520]  government knew within three months and it didn't come out for over a year that
[27:23.520 --> 27:29.560]  all of the tuna coming from the Pacific the bluefin the yellowfin that migrates
[27:29.560 --> 27:34.560]  back and forth between Japan and the west coast of the United States had off
[27:34.560 --> 27:40.840]  the charts levels of different radioactive isotopes in it in some cases
[27:40.840 --> 27:46.080]  hundreds of times what they said was safe so they just raise the level in fish
[27:46.080 --> 27:54.200]  for what they say is safe radiation wise and there have been mass deaths all
[27:54.200 --> 27:58.520]  over Japan it's come out even in their media but they just keep it quiet the
[27:58.520 --> 28:03.280]  butterflies are heavily mutated most the fish are mutated now the frogs are
[28:03.280 --> 28:11.000]  mutated all over the country of Japan conservatively conservatively the six
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.480]  reactors five of them being heavily damaged four of them completely melting
[28:14.480 --> 28:21.080]  down and exploding in one case shooting fuel rods two miles I went looked up the
[28:21.080 --> 28:26.080]  mox3 reactor looked up its diagrams blew up the video said within 12 hours of
[28:26.080 --> 28:29.880]  it happening that is not just the containment rods stored on top the
[28:29.880 --> 28:36.880]  spent fuel rods over 500,000 stored at the facility 200,000 on top the mox3
[28:36.880 --> 28:42.080]  those number three reactor mox reactor plutonium uranium reactor as bad as it
[28:42.080 --> 28:46.800]  gets it exploded in a mushroom cloud and then they picked up the isotopes that
[28:46.800 --> 28:51.160]  meant that it had gone critical and actually had a chain reaction and I had
[28:51.160 --> 28:55.760]  top European Union and British experts like let's get Dr. Busby back on about
[28:55.760 --> 29:01.440]  this immediately by the way and I mean they picked up the isotopes there it
[29:01.440 --> 29:05.720]  was picked up in the radiology journals the journals of you know the breakdown
[29:05.720 --> 29:10.800]  the radiation that they picked up that fission had happened chain reaction had
[29:10.800 --> 29:15.260]  happened and children all over the country are just dropping dead on the
[29:15.260 --> 29:20.360]  playground their teeth are falling out they're having bleeding out of their
[29:20.360 --> 29:24.160]  intestines all the signs all the fast-growing cells are dying and the
[29:24.160 --> 29:27.160]  children just have cardiac arrest and fall dead and then they're just mopped
[29:27.160 --> 29:34.240]  up quietly in the Japanese soldier through it well here's the new report
[29:34.240 --> 29:40.360]  third of US West Coast children hit with thyroid problems following Fukushima and
[29:40.360 --> 29:45.000]  all I said was please protect your thyroid and I was called a conspiracy
[29:45.000 --> 29:50.880]  theorist and now these children many of them will die we're on the march the
[29:50.880 --> 29:57.960]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:59.160 --> 30:04.140]  in the last two years alone the US has seen huge losses to our food supply in
[30:04.140 --> 30:09.320]  2011 storms and floods raged across the US costing us 20 billion and lost crops

[33:05.960 --> 33:10.640]  government we must guard against the acquisition of unwanted influence
[33:10.640 --> 33:16.120]  whether sought or unsought by the military industrial commemoration. In
[33:16.120 --> 33:20.380]  Dallas Texas three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in
[33:20.380 --> 33:24.720]  downtown Dallas. The first reports say that President Kennedy has been
[33:24.720 --> 33:36.800]  seriously wounded by this shooting. It is a big idea. A new order. It was almost as if it were a planned
[33:36.800 --> 33:47.880]  impulse. It just pancakes. Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[33:58.360 --> 34:03.400]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of
[34:03.400 --> 34:14.840]  soldiers not the hands of criminals. For many of the police and guard troops it is
[34:14.840 --> 34:19.000]  an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city. Global governance at last
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.720]  is it one world the central bank is in charge but aren't we all just living and
[34:23.720 --> 34:34.400]  dying from what the central banks do. And for me give me liberty or give me death.
[34:34.400 --> 34:38.360]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios it's Alex Jones.
[34:40.040 --> 34:46.200]  Ladies and gentlemen I will get back into this incredible report that again I
[34:46.200 --> 34:50.880]  spent an hour this morning pouring over fact-checking I already knew these
[34:50.880 --> 34:57.520]  numbers. We're coming out about six months ago in a preliminary research but
[34:57.520 --> 35:05.760]  again the Fukushima reactor meltdown happened in 2011 in March of 2011. Wow
[35:05.760 --> 35:12.840]  hard to believe it's already been two years and they milk levels all over the
[35:12.840 --> 35:17.480]  country spiked in some cases hundreds of times the safe radiation level in
[35:17.480 --> 35:20.520]  places like Connecticut. It all depends where the trade winds come back down in
[35:20.520 --> 35:25.280]  the lower atmosphere but all universities all over California from
[35:25.280 --> 35:33.800]  Berkeley to San Jose College to the colleges up in Alaska that's where the
[35:33.800 --> 35:40.360]  within weeks the currents from Japan Japan's a lot closer to Alaska than it
[35:40.360 --> 35:45.520]  is to the west coast of Canada and the west coast of the US. The seals dying
[35:45.520 --> 35:52.400]  people's hair falling out the air traffic controllers hair falling out the
[35:52.400 --> 35:56.240]  people that work on the aircraft their hair falling out radiation poisoning.
[35:56.240 --> 36:00.640]  And so what did the Environmental Protection Agency do and I'm gonna do a
[36:00.640 --> 36:04.640]  report on this tonight showing all these documents they're in there putting it
[36:04.640 --> 36:07.320]  together I'm gonna be on the nightly news as a guest tonight breaking this down
[36:07.320 --> 36:11.040]  seven o'clock central and we'll cover it more tomorrow with Mike Adams when he
[36:11.040 --> 36:16.720]  sets in. It's just this is such a big deal report third of US West Coast
[36:16.720 --> 36:22.040]  children hit with thyroid problems following Fukushima and that's in the
[36:22.040 --> 36:30.440]  Journal of Pediatrics Radiation and Public Health Project and also information
[36:30.440 --> 36:37.560]  out of UC Berkeley and it's got all the recordings of what happened and it is
[36:37.560 --> 36:48.640]  just absolutely devastating. Again with children the thyroid particularly absorbs
[36:48.640 --> 36:53.080]  the radioactive isotopes and they should have been saying everybody's got to go
[36:53.080 --> 36:57.440]  on Ferris safe I know Homeland Security on the west coast ordered it
[36:57.440 --> 37:01.640]  immediately and went on it. I mean within days of Fukushima happening
[37:01.640 --> 37:05.440]  Homeland Security ordered it and ordered its people on the west coast to go on
[37:05.440 --> 37:09.200]  it and that came out but they weren't going to give you the memo just like
[37:09.200 --> 37:14.760]  when the dust is full of asbestos concrete powder pulverized glass there's
[37:14.760 --> 37:19.080]  six seven eight ten feet of it most of lower Manhattan had at least a foot of
[37:19.080 --> 37:24.760]  it and you've got all the tsunami wreckage that took about a year to get
[37:24.760 --> 37:29.760]  across there they didn't warn anybody. I mean that had a lot of plutonium on it
[37:29.760 --> 37:34.480]  that takes billions of years to retrograde and to go into its half-life
[37:34.480 --> 37:41.880]  and it all came right across the Pacific the northern Pacific right into the
[37:41.880 --> 37:49.840]  west coast. Some of it also hit northern Mexico but not as much as I mean northern
[37:49.840 --> 37:58.320]  California up is just off the charts and people are delusional they they just
[37:58.320 --> 38:02.440]  think oh we can make an excuse for it kind of like vaccine damage I mean if
[38:02.440 --> 38:05.760]  you've got tens of millions of American kids hundreds of millions of kids
[38:05.760 --> 38:10.320]  worldwide damage from vaccines on record and the insert says it can give you
[38:10.320 --> 38:14.160]  neurological disorders narcolepsy Guillain-Barre but then when it happens to
[38:14.160 --> 38:20.000]  you they say oh it's a conspiracy theory I mean I can play a clip of 10 world
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.800]  leaders right now I'm calling for a world government and they'll just say
[38:23.800 --> 38:28.560]  doesn't exist conspiracy theory and and that becomes the magic you know oh I can
[38:28.560 --> 38:31.960]  drink a bottle of vodka every night not get let look liver failure that's a
[38:31.960 --> 38:39.360]  conspiracy theory and you know what you will end up getting liver failure just
[38:39.360 --> 38:46.360]  fact but but this is the age of the hoax that's why the new magazine the new
[38:46.360 --> 38:52.440]  info wars magazine the April issue is welcome to planet hoax because that's
[38:52.440 --> 38:56.240]  what we've become I mean look at this still think that Fukushima nuclear
[38:56.240 --> 39:00.160]  meltdown of 2011 never affected the United States public young children
[39:00.160 --> 39:04.200]  born in the United States West Coast this is up on info wars.com right in the
[39:04.200 --> 39:09.200]  line of fire for radioactive isotopes have been found to be 28 percent more
[39:09.200 --> 39:15.120]  likely to develop congenital hyperthyroidism that infants born the
[39:15.120 --> 39:20.000]  years before the incident and that's just one indicator folks same thing now
[39:20.000 --> 39:28.520]  again I said you earlier I said do you know how much worse Fukushima is than
[39:28.520 --> 39:31.840]  Chernobyl and I never gave the answer because I was scanning my brain for it
[39:31.840 --> 39:35.360]  and thinking of what Dr. Busby broke down and what the other nuclear private
[39:35.360 --> 39:42.320]  commissions broke down anywhere between seven and a hundred times depending on
[39:42.320 --> 39:45.560]  how you break it down with computer models because it's still belching the
[39:45.560 --> 39:49.920]  stuff out and there's more of it coming across the ocean and more of it the
[39:49.920 --> 39:53.840]  really heavy stuff that fell quicker on to all the rubble and on to all the
[39:53.840 --> 39:57.240]  garbage and on to all the tsunami wreckage that is just goes in a big
[39:57.240 --> 40:04.560]  circular vacuum cleaner around and around and around and around and around
[40:04.560 --> 40:12.480]  and around and around and around the West Coast of North America I mean it's
[40:12.480 --> 40:17.920]  horrible and this is in the journal of pediatrics radiation and public health
[40:17.920 --> 40:28.200]  project UC Berkeley and I can just keep going over all this for you and again
[40:28.200 --> 40:34.640]  this comes out it was first published in natural society report third of US
[40:34.640 --> 40:40.040]  West Coast children hit with thyroid problems following Fukushima now here's
[40:40.040 --> 40:46.640]  the deal 92% that show that to folks there's 420 something operating
[40:46.640 --> 40:51.040]  reactors that are for energy there's a couple hundred other smaller ones that
[40:51.040 --> 40:55.040]  we know of two of them are in Austin that nobody seems to know about people
[40:55.040 --> 40:58.800]  call me a conspiracy theory for that I've had people in restaurants twice walk up
[40:58.800 --> 41:01.480]  once on the street once in a restaurant and say you said there's a nuclear
[41:01.480 --> 41:05.480]  reactor I asked my cousin that's a professor he says you're a liar okay
[41:05.480 --> 41:10.080]  fine there's no reactors I had a guy told the story come up and poke me in the
[41:10.080 --> 41:13.440]  shoulder and go you're a liar there's no goats that are part spider I don't
[41:13.440 --> 41:23.080]  appreciate you lying I said get out of my face oh there's the US NRC the nuclear
[41:23.080 --> 41:27.080]  regulatory Commission and I guess that's why they call me a liar click on that
[41:27.080 --> 41:30.560]  show that to do they even show the reactors in Austin on that I don't think
[41:30.560 --> 41:39.760]  they do I guess I got the South Texas project unit to see they're only
[41:39.760 --> 41:44.160]  listening power generators there just show them anybody can Google it type in
[41:44.160 --> 41:49.600]  University of Texas nuclear reactors it'll show the JJ Pickle and then they
[41:49.600 --> 41:55.480]  don't want to talk about the one under UT because it scares all the yuppies and
[41:55.480 --> 41:59.480]  culture you know she says the Japanese ought to be thankful for the radiation
[41:59.480 --> 42:03.520]  over there because it's quote good for you yeah I guess if they shoot targeted
[42:03.520 --> 42:08.000]  radiation it's some cancer it's been shown to slow it down the problem is
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.680]  my family that's been cooked with the targeted radiation it starts leaking so
[42:11.680 --> 42:15.400]  bad in their brain or in their pancreas that that kills them because you know it
[42:15.400 --> 42:22.760]  you know you fry a bunch of meat in there and it starts leaking you know what
[42:22.760 --> 42:25.960]  it's a conspiracy theory radiation is good for you I agree with Ann Coulter
[42:25.960 --> 42:31.160]  report third of West Coast children hit with thyroid problems following Fukushima
[42:31.160 --> 42:38.680]  and you know what I shouldn't be concerned about that the study followed
[42:38.680 --> 42:45.120]  children born in California Alaska Washington Hawaii Oregon between the
[42:45.120 --> 42:49.520]  first and 16 weeks after horrific meltdown at Fukushima back in 2011
[42:49.520 --> 42:52.600]  published in the open journal of pediatrics by researchers affiliated
[42:52.600 --> 42:57.000]  with the radiation and public health project the information further lends
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.000]  credence to previous documentation regarding the way in which radioactive
[43:01.000 --> 43:09.240]  fallout ended up on US soil well yeah we've got the environmental protection
[43:09.240 --> 43:15.200]  agency raised radioactive isotopes between 25 and 2500 times depending on
[43:15.200 --> 43:18.600]  what isotope it was oh you're worried about radiation that they're finding in
[43:18.600 --> 43:22.240]  the milk and the produce all the stuff that hits the ground cows eat grass
[43:22.240 --> 43:26.280]  bioaccumulates in them it's excreted in their mammary glands they're others I
[43:26.280 --> 43:29.400]  know that's a conspiracy theory but that's where the milk comes from is
[43:29.400 --> 43:38.080]  cows udders they eat grass and then you drink that and it bioaccumulates same
[43:38.080 --> 43:42.800]  thing with cabbage lettuce root vegetables in a rutabagas things like
[43:42.800 --> 43:50.360]  that onions show you know I mean my wife was in Europe when Chernobyl happened
[43:50.360 --> 43:56.280]  and for a year she was in Italy then her dad was a diplomat with the
[43:56.280 --> 44:02.680]  Agriculture Department they they had only frozen vegetables flown in from the
[44:02.680 --> 44:08.960]  United States and other areas in Asia and only powdered milk which said it was
[44:08.960 --> 44:14.480]  the old girl school they went to at the time and all over Europe you the
[44:14.480 --> 44:22.120]  children did not drink milk and you know the adults said well we don't care it
[44:22.120 --> 44:26.200]  doesn't affect us our tissue was in this fast-growing see fast-growing cells are
[44:26.200 --> 44:32.200]  really jacked by radiation that's why when Japan got a bombed most adults
[44:32.200 --> 44:36.040]  didn't die from radiation poisoning was little kids because they got fast-growing
[44:36.040 --> 44:44.120]  cells folks and it fries fast-growing cells and and so she told me about that
[44:44.120 --> 44:49.560]  I went and looked it up sure enough found TV shows from the time you know 60
[44:49.560 --> 44:53.360]  minutes and stuff reporting on Chernobyl a year later about Europeans have taken
[44:53.360 --> 44:56.920]  the precautions and it showed them the plume that went into northern Europe and
[44:56.920 --> 45:00.800]  southern Europe and Western Europe and Eastern Europe and you know it showed it
[45:00.800 --> 45:09.040]  you know there in Ukraine and it showed what it did and they estimate a million
[45:09.040 --> 45:13.920]  people have died from complications and they've got the Chernobyl necklace
[45:13.920 --> 45:18.360]  and they've got hundreds of square miles around Chernobyl that nobody can even
[45:18.360 --> 45:22.160]  go into and the plants all grow weird from it and
[45:22.160 --> 45:30.160]  conservatively the lowest estimates are that Fukushima was seven times Chernobyl
[45:30.160 --> 45:35.360]  people like Alex below you know what about the Rangers what about you know
[45:35.360 --> 45:42.800]  how are the Rangers gonna do this year okay fine the Rangers you know what
[45:42.800 --> 45:46.600]  about the NFL I mean what do you think can happen with the NFL draft I mean
[45:46.600 --> 45:49.520]  look I could care less ladies and gentlemen and it's not because I don't
[45:49.520 --> 45:55.480]  like football I get the fun about your buddy's 20 bucks sitting around drinking
[45:55.480 --> 45:59.200]  beer and you know eating fried chicken and watching a football game I get it
[45:59.200 --> 46:04.960]  okay I've done it the point is there's radiation raining down on us Japan has
[46:04.960 --> 46:09.840]  had it has having massive problems and it's all just swept under the rug and so
[46:09.840 --> 46:14.640]  is everything else the tyranny the drones the oppression the sodium fluoride in
[46:14.640 --> 46:22.680]  the water all of this is just swept under the rug and the establishment
[46:22.680 --> 46:34.080]  itself has become completely completely delusional and the guys have pulled up
[46:34.080 --> 46:37.400]  some statistics here on peer-reviewed national organization local state and
[46:37.400 --> 46:41.760]  federal employees has access to internal EPA emails claims that the new
[46:41.760 --> 46:45.800]  standards of results are nearly 1,000 fold increases for exposure amounts
[46:45.800 --> 46:53.120]  900 to 3,000 to 100,000 fold hike of exposure of iodine 131 and almost 25,000
[46:53.120 --> 47:03.440]  rise for exposure radioactive nickel 63 in drinking water see I love how I love
[47:03.440 --> 47:07.320]  how everything becomes a rumor I saw a Washington blogs article the other day
[47:07.320 --> 47:12.160]  that'll link to a video FEMA video from my film road to tyranny that said it is
[47:12.160 --> 47:16.080]  claimed that FEMA teaches that the founding fathers were terrorists when
[47:16.080 --> 47:20.600]  it's real-footed shot by a firefighter at a law enforcement event with FEMA
[47:20.600 --> 47:24.720]  demonizing it and I show the training manuals and it's on record but it becomes
[47:24.720 --> 47:30.520]  a rumor and then see I told the guys I said go find the the the the the
[47:30.520 --> 47:34.600]  environmental protection agency and the food and drug administration they were
[47:34.600 --> 47:39.280]  involved it's on their website I know this is a year and a half old but this
[47:39.280 --> 47:43.400]  is on we wrote articles about it just type it info wars calm after it see see
[47:43.400 --> 47:46.800]  that's some site I told the guys I find they're doing a great job but they find
[47:46.800 --> 47:50.760]  something where someone says internal emails people claim show this it's not a
[47:50.760 --> 47:54.800]  rumor it's not a rumor the Gulf of Tonkin was staged it was in the San
[47:54.800 --> 47:59.040]  Diego Herald Tribune six months after it happened when the commanding officers
[47:59.040 --> 48:03.440]  of the ships got off and said it was all why we weren't attacked but no one ever
[48:03.440 --> 48:11.480]  had the newspaper article so it became a rumor until they declassified it in 2004
[48:14.760 --> 48:18.760]  that it was all staged
[48:21.840 --> 48:26.720]  so good job finding that guys but but let me give you the exact headline hold
[48:26.720 --> 48:30.800]  them just had an info wars calm behind it and click web because it'll be old
[48:30.800 --> 48:40.640]  type in government raises radiation safe radiation levels after Fukushima info
[48:40.640 --> 48:45.680]  wars calm and then it will go to our articles by Paul Watson Curtin MO and
[48:45.680 --> 48:52.760]  others linking directly to the environmental protection agency and
[48:52.760 --> 48:57.080]  the food and drug administration but but the first one was the environmental
[48:57.080 --> 49:02.040]  protection agency but see this is how knowledge works it just becomes a rumor
[49:02.040 --> 49:06.320]  like it's a rumor their FEMA camps and Glenn Beck can get up there and say
[49:06.320 --> 49:10.320]  there are no FEMA camps Alex Jones is a dangerous liar when I have the Model
[49:10.320 --> 49:16.960]  States Health Emergency Powers Act the civilian labor camp program type this in
[49:16.960 --> 49:23.320]  you'll be at army dot mill and FEMA dot gov army manual on gun confiscation army
[49:23.320 --> 49:32.080]  manual on reeducation camps in America you'll be at army dot mill civilian inmate
[49:32.080 --> 49:36.040]  labor camp program you'll be an army dot mill the program was secret from the
[49:36.040 --> 49:41.680]  70s to 1998 when Clinton declassified it to hide it in plain view that's an
[49:41.680 --> 49:45.640]  ongoing program with slaves on military bases secretly right now but it's
[49:45.640 --> 49:51.000]  now declassified the the emergency centers establishment act you mean to
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.520]  keep going with some executive orders here I mean I'm just laying on you fact
[49:54.520 --> 50:04.560]  fact fact fact fact fact and then I get attacked by neocondom the neo kingdom the
[50:04.560 --> 50:08.160]  gatekeepers who sit up there and say Alex Jones is nuts you know I was reminded
[50:08.160 --> 50:11.360]  of Glenn Beck this morning with the clipper he said there there isn't 1.5
[50:11.360 --> 50:16.920]  million bullets Alex Jones is a liar we're gonna play that coming up about
[50:16.920 --> 50:20.840]  and I'm not here to tackle and back except he is attacking me I've learned
[50:20.840 --> 50:28.800]  now every week telling his listeners you can't trust Alex Jones no you can't
[50:28.800 --> 50:33.920]  trust Glenn Beck and I'm on a lot of the same stations with him for program
[50:33.920 --> 50:39.480]  directors you know what you hear it I didn't start this okay the bullets are
[50:39.480 --> 50:48.080]  real the FEMA camps are real Fukushima's real I'm real buddy I know
[50:48.080 --> 50:53.880]  effeminate men don't like real men I get it you trawler get out of my way I'm
[50:53.880 --> 50:58.440]  trying to save this Republic all right well they're right back with more news
[50:58.440 --> 51:03.640]  stay with me in the last two years alone the US has seen huge losses to our
[51:03.640 --> 51:08.720]  food supply in 2011 storms and floods raged across the US costing us 20
[51:08.720 --> 51:12.720]  billion and lost crops alone in 2012 he saw the largest drought in the country
[51:12.720 --> 51:16.960]  in more than 50 years you may think out of sight out of mind and so you don't
[51:16.960 --> 51:21.600]  think you will be affected the fact is you are we all are food shortages drive
[51:21.600 --> 51:25.560]  prices up for everyone you might not be able to control mother nature but you
[51:25.560 --> 51:29.920]  can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food

[55:20.640 --> 55:25.400]  good for and then the next article I have here robots to take over jobs and
[55:25.400 --> 55:30.120]  human service industry increasing the percentage of unemployed americans yeah
[55:30.120 --> 55:33.800]  this is the phase out of humanity but first they're gonna bankrupt us and make
[55:33.800 --> 55:39.760]  us dependent but getting back to why I'm so upset about the Fukushima radiation
[55:39.760 --> 55:43.680]  that's so bad on the west coast and all the radiation meters that went off and
[55:43.680 --> 55:47.400]  the rest of it is that they said there's no problem from the start kept its
[55:47.400 --> 55:54.400]  secret how high it was in the seafood and lied to everybody while the government
[55:54.400 --> 56:01.480]  went on thyroid protectors themselves just like the dust on 9-11 which it now
[56:01.480 --> 56:05.760]  came out they knew was killing people and was going to fill people's lungs and
[56:05.760 --> 56:09.480]  they told the firefighters and police and rescue workers don't worry you don't
[56:09.480 --> 56:14.280]  need masks it's not bad and people went okay
[56:14.280 --> 56:19.520]  yeah there it is Fukushima fish with two thousand five hundred times the
[56:19.520 --> 56:25.960]  radiation limit found two years after the nuclear disaster and there is from
[56:25.960 --> 56:32.480]  NOAA the radiation meter pickups from the buoys that's directly from the
[56:32.480 --> 56:37.520]  federal government the radiation look at it just hitting everywhere
[56:37.520 --> 56:48.120]  absolutely devastating to have this type of stuff going on and then meanwhile the
[56:48.120 --> 56:53.640]  government's now got 2 billion 200 million plus rounds they bought if
[56:53.640 --> 56:57.600]  finally the White House has responded and said okay well we bought them to get
[56:57.600 --> 57:00.800]  a better deal even though it actually more than double the price when they
[57:00.800 --> 57:07.120]  caused the run on the ammo it doesn't matter Glenbeck says I'm a liar because
[57:07.120 --> 57:12.160]  we broke this story here it is amazing because he runs info wars when really
[57:12.160 --> 57:15.840]  smart people have come up to me and said you know I just saw this on something
[57:15.840 --> 57:21.080]  from info wars do you know anything about them like yes yeah stay away from it
[57:21.080 --> 57:27.000]  immediately somebody came up to me just two days ago and said we just bought
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.160]  like 1.5 billion rounds of Homeland Security and I said I don't know might
[57:32.160 --> 57:38.480]  be well I got it from info wars and I'm okay okay well then I can tell you
[57:38.480 --> 57:46.040]  right now it's most likely not true there you go and I have a new clip we're
[57:46.040 --> 57:52.320]  gonna play in about 45 minutes where he says that there's no Builderburg group
[57:52.320 --> 57:56.960]  or Illuminati and every year we go to Builderburg and cover it
[57:56.960 --> 58:00.360]  Glenbeck it's freaked out because you know just on Justin TV we'll get three
[58:00.360 --> 58:03.840]  and a half million viewers I mean just in a day or two just with a video stream
[58:03.840 --> 58:09.320]  Glenbeck goes on air and says it doesn't exist because I guess Peter Thiel the
[58:09.320 --> 58:13.880]  big libertarian Builderburg group member has got his thumb all over the
[58:13.880 --> 58:21.040]  Liberty Movement I mean I just don't even know what to say anymore okay all
[58:21.040 --> 58:23.680]  right there's no bullets there's no Builderburg group and there's no global
[58:23.680 --> 58:30.400]  government either Glenn oh but you're not gatekeeping Glenn sure I'm the liar oh
[58:30.400 --> 58:35.920]  by the way he calls me a fascist and a piece of garbage because folks the

[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:37.400]  caesar as a tyrant because that's a tyrant of another age people always
[1:09:37.400 --> 1:09:43.040]  always are resistant to recognizing the tear the the tyranny of their time
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:46.800]  because the tyrant of their time will come after them if they get in their
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:51.720]  face the tyrant of the time is always demonizing anybody that says they're a
[1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:59.280]  tyrant like king george the third and what happened in 1776 it was the exact
[1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:03.200]  same demonization in the spy networks that we now see homeland security putting
[1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:07.800]  out saying if you're a gun owner if you're a returning veteran if you are a
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:13.320]  constitutionalist or a patriot or a right-winger or a libertarian you are
[1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:18.160]  the new terror threat and they say number one amongst that paramount you know
[1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:24.920]  range is the returning veteran and they must be disarmed now that sounds
[1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:30.840]  crazy except if you know history every tyranny for thousands of years when it
[1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:36.880]  takes over if there was an old guard that had been taught old tricks you know
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:41.040]  you don't teach a new dog you know new tricks you don't teach an old dog new
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:47.400]  tricks you you you you teach the new guys they bring in the new tyranny they
[1:10:47.400 --> 1:10:51.800]  can't what we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns
[1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:55.280]  especially young people one thing that I think is clear with young people and
[1:10:55.280 --> 1:10:59.080]  with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this it's not
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:03.400]  enough to simply have a catchy ad on a monday and then only do it every monday
[1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:07.680]  we need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into
[1:11:07.680 --> 1:11:12.720]  thinking about guns in a vastly different way and that's the former deputy
[1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:16.400]  attorney general now the attorney general he was saying that as deputy
[1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:20.720]  attorney general under clinton and he said also use Oklahoma City to blame
[1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:24.600]  conservatives libertarians for the terror attack just like they staged fast
[1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:28.200]  and furious we're going to our guest here in a moment my point is they know
[1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:33.280]  they can't teach old dogs new tricks so they bring in new dogs and whether it
[1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:42.840]  was Stalin Hitler Mao Julius Caesar Fidel Castro there is not a case where the
[1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:52.040]  old guard that was less authoritarian was not hunted down and exterminated
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:12:00.720]  okay so when we broke four years ago when I was sent by a federal marshal a
[1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:05.760]  federal document and then sent by state police the state version of it the
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:09.880]  mag report for about five six days Ron Paul's office called they said is this
[1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:13.200]  really real have you called how do you know what's wrong I said I called the
[1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:17.720]  phone number on it and the FBI agent started threatening me and saying I
[1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:21.760]  where did you get that you shouldn't have that and admitted it was real and I
[1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:24.400]  said I've read these before this was written by the ADL or Southern Barber
[1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:28.840]  Law Center I mean I've gotten probably a hundred of these over the years for
[1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:33.600]  some reason it finally got people's attention and then and then Homeland
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:38.360]  Security responded in the associated presence said we back this up we agree
[1:12:38.360 --> 1:12:42.920]  with this the number one terror threat is veterans then conservatives
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:47.120]  libertarians born again Christians constitutionalist in the fetters there's
[1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:53.960]  more than 20 people groups on that list so even Ron Paul had people call me and
[1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:57.520]  say Alex is this really real because Ron Paul's name was on the list as a
[1:12:57.520 --> 1:13:03.120]  terrorist yeah Air Force veterans with no criminal records not even speeding
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:10.880]  tickets that volunteered at charity hospitals for no pay who stand up for
[1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:14.720]  the Constitution yeah he's a terrorist ladies and gentlemen when you see
[1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:19.600]  terrorist remove that and say patriot good guy real man head screwed on
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:23.280]  straight a threat to the foreign globalists that are taking us over I
[1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:28.080]  mean who do you expect a foreign takeover army to want to purge when
[1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:32.360]  when Hitler took over France with collaborators who'd he go after the
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:36.520]  people that weren't collaborators and then he purged the collaborators that
[1:13:36.520 --> 1:13:41.960]  open the door for him you don't want traders that open the drawbridge you are
[1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:45.680]  disdain you traders out there by the globalists as well they're scared of
[1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:49.440]  you they know the type of scum you are you're the first people they're gonna
[1:13:49.440 --> 1:13:53.600]  go after so those of you that persecute retired police and military and people
[1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:57.120]  you're gonna be persecuted as well you're at the top of the list not by Alex
[1:13:57.120 --> 1:14:04.160]  Jones by your own system now I'm gonna go to our guest who's holding the point
[1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:08.760]  is is that I have an article here Dallas adds security for county officials
[1:14:08.760 --> 1:14:11.960]  because they don't know who they're saying white supremacist and I know the
[1:14:11.960 --> 1:14:16.160]  MO white supremacist you have a history of shooting cops and prosecutors no
[1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:21.000]  nothing like the Mexican mafia's history I'd say 70% chance it's a Mexican gang a
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:28.520]  real cartel 20 20 to 30% chance it is something like a white supremacist
[1:14:28.520 --> 1:14:33.160]  group but they you know they've killed a bunch of the different prosecutors
[1:14:33.160 --> 1:14:38.280]  wardens you name it out in Colorado and here's NBC intruder killed while
[1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:43.520]  breaking into Colorado prosecutors home and guess what the prosecutor used a
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:47.360]  semi-auto to take them out and you notice they don't want you to know it was a
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:49.200]  white supremacist they'd already be saying it was a white supremacist
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:55.200]  probably Mexican mafia folks probably a worshiper of the grim reaper that's
[1:14:55.200 --> 1:14:58.440]  that's what all those groups worship five six different versions of the grim
[1:14:58.440 --> 1:15:01.920]  reaper it's a death cult you know it's like the ninja they're they're into
[1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:07.200]  being killed they don't care we weren't really a death cult in 1776 but it was
[1:15:07.200 --> 1:15:09.920]  kind of the same deal people just get tired and they say I'll kill whoever I'm
[1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:14.600]  told to kill and that's what happens when the veneer of civilization boils off I
[1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:19.480]  mean cops when the Civil War starts are going to be an armored fortresses guarding
[1:15:19.480 --> 1:15:23.440]  themselves while everybody starves on the outside just I've always said
[1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:27.400]  fortress mentality that's what it's going to now before all this happens they
[1:15:27.400 --> 1:15:30.520]  want to get a list of gun owners thinking that's going to help them before
[1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:33.720]  they start snatching your pension funds and bank accounts because they think
[1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:37.360]  veterans are going to try to organize as they always do to take back the states
[1:15:37.360 --> 1:15:42.560]  peacefully and you're going to be targeted you try to run for city council
[1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:45.280]  they're going to take your guns and say your mental patient so they're worried
[1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:48.640]  about veterans because they're worried you may take action peacefully so they're
[1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:53.040]  going to demonize you and then try to start a hot war with you now going to
[1:15:53.040 --> 1:15:56.680]  our guest here he'll be with us till about 45 after David Schmecker
[1:15:56.680 --> 1:16:00.560]  honorably discharged disabled US Navy veteran from Connecticut with no criminal
[1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:04.640]  record and no psychiatric history and I said to him during the break I said let
[1:16:04.640 --> 1:16:09.080]  me guess you went in for a medical checkup for a physical issue and your
[1:16:09.080 --> 1:16:13.440]  guns were taken and he goes yep so everybody who's a veteran here's the
[1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:16.520]  article federal government moves with disarm veterans they're all getting a
[1:16:16.520 --> 1:16:20.880]  letter saying that we will order you to relinquish your guns or we'll send
[1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:26.440]  police to take your guns no judge or jury and physical reasons they're now
[1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:32.360]  taking veterans kids if your legs blown off okay and there's the letter notice
[1:16:32.360 --> 1:16:36.400]  if you're watching us on info wars news at prison planet dot TV going to mr.
[1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:39.840]  Schmecker here's the headline veterans guns confiscated after forced
[1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:45.760]  psychiatric evaluation purge against arms ex-servicemen accelerates and so
[1:16:45.760 --> 1:16:50.040]  just briefly tell us the story of what happened to you what precipitated it and
[1:16:50.040 --> 1:16:55.880]  where your guns are now and how they're charging you for the days you were held
[1:16:55.880 --> 1:17:00.840]  at the hospital David Schmecker thank you for joining us
[1:17:00.840 --> 1:17:07.280]  problem yes they I got requested to see a pain management specialist and they
[1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:11.400]  came back to me the veterans administration came back to me and said
[1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:15.000]  that you have to see a half hour of a psychiatrist and a half hour of a
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:20.440]  psychologist for a spine injury and I refuse to do that because I have a
[1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:23.240]  spine injury I don't really you know I don't want to see especially not a
[1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:28.000]  veterans hospital psychiatrist no they've always used psychiatrists in the
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:31.600]  military and authoritarian systems to demonize there were famous cases in
[1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:35.800]  world war two a fuel tanks breaking on a particular bomber and and all the
[1:17:35.800 --> 1:17:42.000]  captains that were the pilots were were were issued rulings that they were had
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:47.840]  psychosis saying that the fuel tanks were dumping the fuel on their own and it
[1:17:47.840 --> 1:17:51.360]  came out in Congress that they were ordered to give them that designation go
[1:17:51.360 --> 1:17:59.040]  ahead yeah so I refused and six months later basically the hospital but my
[1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:04.080]  primary care physician called to have a wellness check placed on me and the
[1:18:04.080 --> 1:18:09.720]  local police perform a wellness check well the local police came up and there
[1:18:09.720 --> 1:18:14.520]  was nothing wrong with me I had no you know there was no anxiety I wasn't
[1:18:14.520 --> 1:18:19.960]  combative I basically but I wasn't I wasn't with anybody so I had no
[1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:24.120]  witnesses and they didn't have a warrant and they
[1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:30.840]  went through intimidation forcefully commandeered my vehicle and entered my
[1:18:30.840 --> 1:18:39.120]  home searched and seized my weapons and then you know part of me way in an
[1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:45.280]  ambulance to psychiatric evaluation which I was held for 72 hours yeah no
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:51.160]  judge no jury no nothing no history no probable cause the police come with no
[1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:57.720]  warrant and drag you off and describe what happened there in the facility
[1:18:57.720 --> 1:19:02.880]  well the facility it was really tough because you had to be very careful what
[1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:07.600]  you said I was under constant fear I was gonna get out of there and they were
[1:19:07.600 --> 1:19:11.920]  basically letting me know that if I oh yeah all the veterans that have told me
[1:19:11.920 --> 1:19:15.260]  if they can't make you mad they'll come in at the last moment and go I'm now
[1:19:15.260 --> 1:19:18.720]  having you committed for life yeah there's nothing you can do to stop me and
[1:19:18.720 --> 1:19:23.560]  they laugh at you trying to get you to respond and it's a final deal in psych
[1:19:23.560 --> 1:19:26.560]  warfare I haven't talked to you yet except for a minute before you went on
[1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:41.800]  air I haven't asked you this did they do that to you oh my god oh my god that's
[1:19:41.800 --> 1:19:45.460]  not even in our article they're now drugging you oh my gosh what did they
[1:19:45.460 --> 1:19:48.080]  give you what did they do I don't even know what they caught what it is called
[1:19:48.080 --> 1:19:52.480]  I didn't want to I was watching the first time I was watching the toilet until I
[1:19:52.480 --> 1:19:57.000]  realized if I didn't start taking it they would know you know what did it do to
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:06.960]  you what did do nothing you know nothing to me it probably gave you Halcyon
[1:20:06.960 --> 1:20:10.440]  which is basically a so-called truth ceremony it'll make you you can say say
[1:20:10.440 --> 1:20:14.000]  you're a murderer yes I'm a murderer it's not really true serum it just makes
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:16.920]  you listen my dad gives it to patients they don't remember getting their wisdom
[1:20:16.920 --> 1:20:20.880]  people down I mean you could walk in dressed up in an Easter Bunny outfit
[1:20:20.880 --> 1:20:23.680]  they wouldn't remember it and you could tell you and you can tell them you know
[1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:28.720]  say you're a murderer and they'll say I'm a murderer I mean it's what color
[1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:34.080]  were the pills other white like I'm born type of pills
[1:20:34.080 --> 1:20:44.920]  well you're hearing is mega massive ultra off the all veterans should be
[1:20:44.920 --> 1:20:47.340]  banding together by the way this is happening everywhere and everyone's
[1:20:47.340 --> 1:20:51.000]  getting the wellness check and all these veterans with own businesses you know
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:55.240]  kids totally successful the cops now are having this happen who are veterans
[1:20:55.240 --> 1:20:58.800]  you're going in to see the psychiatrist and if you don't have a use for them
[1:20:58.800 --> 1:21:07.560]  they're disbanding you keep going well I just basically was walking on eggshells
[1:21:07.560 --> 1:21:13.720]  all the time there and I just wanted to get out really quick and so I just did
[1:21:13.720 --> 1:21:18.240]  whatever they wanted me to do say whatever they wanted me to say and 72
[1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:22.480]  hours you know keep my last 72 hours oh wait a minute wait a minute so under
[1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:26.800]  duress and under drugging like you were shot down over North Korea or North
[1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:32.200]  Vietnam you told them what they wanted to hear so they quit drugging you I mean
[1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:35.960]  that's like when they said they were going to drug the so-called Colorado
[1:21:35.960 --> 1:21:40.240]  shooter so he'd tell the truth sir you were actually in a prisoner of war
[1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:45.040]  Soviet style brainwashing camp I didn't know man this country is so far gone
[1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:48.000]  start from the beginning start from the beginning describe what happened when
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:52.440]  you got there what did they say you had to say to get out I mean describe it all
[1:21:52.440 --> 1:22:00.600]  you got the floor David you know people that were my roommate you know in that
[1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:07.760]  room which was they were telling me you know this person here is good you know
[1:22:07.760 --> 1:22:12.560]  this person here watch out for this person and you know watch out what you
[1:22:12.560 --> 1:22:17.600]  say because if you don't if you don't you know play their game you're not getting
[1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:23.880]  out of here and you're gonna oh my god room and there were guys there that didn't
[1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:28.400]  get out there they were there were guys there that were there for years you know
[1:22:28.400 --> 1:22:34.400]  they took Ernest Hemingway who won a Nobel Prize they took him because he said
[1:22:34.400 --> 1:22:37.520]  the FBI was tapping his phone harassing him it was literally classified they were
[1:22:37.520 --> 1:22:43.080]  and they electro shocked his beautiful mind into nothingness and my god these
[1:22:43.080 --> 1:22:49.920]  people are evil keep going I just got out there and I lived to fight another
[1:22:49.920 --> 1:22:53.800]  day basically I you know I didn't I didn't resist against the police like I
[1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:59.520]  maybe should have honest to God had I resisted I would have been beat up I
[1:22:59.520 --> 1:23:04.200]  would have been put in the you know the emergency room first and then possibly
[1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:09.720]  even the morgue so I didn't resist they had no warrant I had no witnesses I saw
[1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:15.280]  what was coming down on me so I you know I had to think I thought I had like a
[1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:20.160]  chess player and I realized I could you know get out of this a little bit less
[1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:25.280]  you know even though it was horrible I could get out of it without getting hurt
[1:23:25.280 --> 1:23:28.920]  and maybe even sure I mean it's like under the Spanish Inquisition or
[1:23:28.920 --> 1:23:31.960]  something or the French Inquisition they take you down a dungeon and they show
[1:23:31.960 --> 1:23:36.560]  you a guy hanging up by his you know by his ankles with burns all over him
[1:23:36.560 --> 1:23:40.360]  mumbling and they say listen we're gonna start torturing and they're gonna cut
[1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:45.440]  your fingers off say that you are consorting with the devil and it was
[1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:49.440]  always somebody who had land or that somebody wanted your wife and then they
[1:23:49.440 --> 1:23:52.000]  take your wife in there and start raping her in front of you they're really the
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:56.480]  devil worshipers that's what later came out and that's just how it works and
[1:23:56.480 --> 1:24:00.040]  this is the new America they take in their facility I've talked to so many
[1:24:00.040 --> 1:24:05.640]  veterans come out well I mean I talked to a Rob who would happen to be the the
[1:24:05.640 --> 1:24:09.320]  Marine Corps guy that criticized Obama mildly so the police SWAT team rated him
[1:24:09.320 --> 1:24:12.360]  and they walked in the last day and said well this is it you're not getting out
[1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:17.120]  I'm having you committed and he didn't get mad he was smart and they got so
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:21.920]  angry it was all being videotaped messing with you and again they're the
[1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:26.920]  same type of dungeon keepers that are CPS they love dominating and abusing
[1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:32.160]  people these are the type that engage in real dungeon keeping and listen have you
[1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:36.080]  talked to other veterans because they're all getting the wellness check letter and
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:38.800]  when you get there they don't tell you they're about to take your guns and they
[1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:41.560]  go oh just see the psychiatrist for 30 minutes and it's like well you ever
[1:24:41.560 --> 1:24:45.960]  feeling down yeah doc I've got cancer I'm been pretty depressed oh your guns
[1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:52.400]  are gone or oh you know my back's hurt I've also talked to vets and I've seen
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:56.240]  the news articles where they're depressed over their leg being blown off I mean
[1:24:56.240 --> 1:24:59.400]  you and it's a figure of speech yeah I'm bummed out about it oh your kids are
[1:24:59.400 --> 1:25:04.240]  gone we say you and your wife aren't up to doing this I mean why do you think
[1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:08.640]  they're targeting veterans yeah you know I haven't got I didn't get the letter
[1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:13.320]  they use the loophole because I wouldn't play along with them I saw this
[1:25:13.320 --> 1:25:18.760]  coming ahead of time so I wasn't I wasn't gonna play their game so they used
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:25.160]  a loophole they used they they they were to get their way and they did and I've
[1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:30.120]  since you know since I was let you know went out of there under my own
[1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:37.000]  reconnaissance 72 hours after the fact you know I I've been battling this in
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:43.440]  the in the court of law and even the they made a decision the court made a
[1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:49.960]  decision those that my weapons should be returned to another person who has a
[1:25:49.960 --> 1:25:54.000]  just because they confiscated my permit too I so I I no longer have a pistol
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:00.840]  permit I had it for six years anyway so the law was handed down that the guns
[1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:05.880]  had to be returned to another person who had pistol permit and they should be
[1:26:05.880 --> 1:26:12.120]  done you know within ten days paper work was signed by the judge and the
[1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:16.840]  police department will not even go along of course they you know they I mean they
[1:26:16.840 --> 1:26:20.080]  sell it out the back door they always get caught doing it but but listen the
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:22.680]  larger issue now they come people around say I'm gonna take your guns and sell
[1:26:22.680 --> 1:26:26.440]  them they do it on on the on Discovery Channel a veteran's died he's been dead
[1:26:26.440 --> 1:26:29.960]  four days of a heart attack they make fun of his dead body on inside the LAPD
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:33.960]  and then steal his guns in front of everyone to break our will it's like
[1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:36.920]  they burn down Dorner's Cabin in front of everyone and said we burned it down and
[1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:41.040]  then said we didn't burn it down but but but but expanding on that so they've
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:45.120]  totally railroaded you into signing your rights away that's how they got you
[1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:48.080]  similar they railroad folks into giving their kids up people say well how do they
[1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:51.040]  take your kid for not taking vaccines they railroad and say you'll get your
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:54.840]  kid back sign this and you've actually signed an agreement saying you've abused
[1:26:54.840 --> 1:26:58.720]  your children so they can take them it's all fraud these are criminal these are
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:02.640]  criminal networks I mean these are real words I'm saying here and so now they
[1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:05.880]  won't give you your guns back even though there's a judge's order of course I
[1:27:05.880 --> 1:27:09.800]  mean it's already involved in a criminal action why not be more criminal how many
[1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:17.120]  guns do they have well they have three of my guns but well I was at that
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:21.600]  hospital I never signed the paper all right you know I knew that this was all
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:25.360]  wrong and they were complicit okay so you didn't sign the paper why don't you
[1:27:25.360 --> 1:27:29.080]  come to Texas what why did everybody just leave New York and Connecticut and
[1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:32.600]  all these places I mean I'm just this seems to be like an exodus ladies and
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:38.520]  gentlemen I am right there believe me I'm telling you get out of California get
[1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:42.000]  out of and I'm on the radio in California it's gorgeous it's beautiful I
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:46.360]  mean I would live somewhere like Santa Cruz where we're on the radio if it if
[1:27:46.360 --> 1:27:51.600]  they didn't arrest surfers who could get too close to Wales that talk to locals I
[1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:55.640]  mean it's just all about getting us in the system man what is wrong with the
[1:27:55.640 --> 1:28:00.440]  Connecticut police up there it's not every Connecticut police matter though
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:04.960]  they still follow it wasn't every Nazi officer either right but this town I've
[1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:08.160]  heard there's got a lot of corruption in this town I talked to other people that
[1:28:08.160 --> 1:28:12.880]  this similar thing has happened to so you know by going public here it reached a
[1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:17.160]  lot of people that I would not necessarily have reached before you know
[1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:22.000]  well here's the deal anybody that wants the Bill of Rights and Constitution you
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:25.600]  know is welcome here Dave Mustaine was asking am I welcome to come to Texas that
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:28.720]  other people don't like Californians around here it's not that we don't like
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:32.920]  Californians they come here and walk up in the grocery store and say you
[1:28:32.920 --> 1:28:37.240]  shouldn't have three kids and they're not Californians they're Soviet globalist
[1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:40.880]  eugenicist cult members and I'm like you've already wrecked your other
[1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:45.880]  beautiful state now you're here telling me my truck's too big I mean you know
[1:28:45.880 --> 1:28:51.640]  leave me alone so there it is in Madison Connecticut a sprawling exercise in
[1:28:51.640 --> 1:28:56.000]  police corruption even the New York Times says you're incredibly corrupt
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:00.040]  where you live no good talk Connecticut no I know but this is a nearby area yeah
[1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:04.960]  so what's going on there what's going on where with what I mean why is it so
[1:29:04.960 --> 1:29:08.920]  corrupt I guess they the mafia like Snoop Dogg once everybody's guns he's
[1:29:08.920 --> 1:29:13.600]  an admitted you know I guess criminals of every type and that makes sense want
[1:29:13.600 --> 1:29:18.480]  one good people's guns of course they do yeah I think this is a campaign going
[1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:23.000]  across the country I've heard from a lot of veterans and they are telling me
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:27.560]  horror stories you know very similar to mine including Brandon Robb I haven't
[1:29:27.560 --> 1:29:32.880]  heard from him but you know that was a shocking story so you know he was held
[1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:35.960]  for much longer than I was and that must have been terrifying because that was
[1:29:35.960 --> 1:29:42.120]  the most terrifying aspect of the whole thing all right bud let's come back in
[1:29:42.120 --> 1:29:45.080]  and talk about any other points you want to make and I can open the phones up
[1:29:45.080 --> 1:29:49.920]  right now folks unlimited veterans will call in having their guns jerked we're

[1:33:46.800 --> 1:33:51.080]  open and provable and verifiable and mix it in with things that can't be proven
[1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:56.880]  one way or the other that's basically sci-fi to discredit the whole thing so

[1:37:48.080 --> 1:37:52.800]  patriots and Ron Paul lights and Alex Jones listeners and I knew it was coming

[1:37:56.400 --> 1:38:01.680]  know has gotten a letter saying come in and we may take your guns when you're
[1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:06.040]  here and if you don't show up they take your guns and when you get there it's an
[1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:10.920]  adversarial criminal outside of law extra judicially because usually used to
[1:38:10.920 --> 1:38:15.640]  have to have a judge with psychiatrists show their proof and then publicly try
[1:38:15.640 --> 1:38:19.960]  to commit you and they have to have a lot of evidence now it's Soviet Union
[1:38:19.960 --> 1:38:26.320]  where every veteran in America that's 10 million people plus living in fact give
[1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:28.640]  me a document cam shot right over here I want to show people this and we're
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:33.200]  going back to our one back to our guest I actually have the article by Curt
[1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:38.320]  Nemo federal government moves to disarm veterans and I've got the letter right
[1:38:38.320 --> 1:38:41.880]  here it says a determination of incompetency will prohibit you from
[1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:45.640]  purchasing possession receiving or transporting firearms ammunition if you
[1:38:45.640 --> 1:38:49.320]  knowingly violate any of these prohibitions you may be fired in prison
[1:38:49.320 --> 1:38:53.320]  or both are fined in prison or both pursuant to the Brady handgun violence
[1:38:53.320 --> 1:38:59.920]  prevention act publication L number 103-159 as implemented at 18 US code
[1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:04.800]  924A2 which they can just implement any way they want and they're claiming now
[1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:11.520]  under law a psychiatrist says you didn't come into this meeting you're like a
[1:39:11.520 --> 1:39:16.920]  slave this isn't in law it's in law that you've been adjudicated mentally ill by
[1:39:16.920 --> 1:39:22.200]  a court which is still fraudulent now they're just saying they will say and
[1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:29.040]  your gun is gone and and I know veterans who who I talked to and they go it is
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:32.080]  it really true and then they go to the meeting they go oh my god they said the
[1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:35.400]  determination will come down to the next week don't get rid of my guns there
[1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:40.040]  may be a police visit and the people laugh at them they try to make you mad I
[1:39:40.040 --> 1:39:44.360]  mean this is just this is twilight zone level folks they're trying to start a
[1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:48.280]  civil war they're trying to push veterans into a shooting war that is just
[1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:52.960]  going to chew the police up the globalist will sit offshore laughing they
[1:39:52.960 --> 1:39:56.920]  want to cover the implosion of the economy with a civil war they engineer
[1:39:56.920 --> 1:40:01.200]  now I want to go back to our guest and then give him a floor for about 10
[1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:04.120]  minutes to make his points about how the cops treated him what happened the
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:07.120]  fact that he didn't agree to this he wanted to be clear when I was talking
[1:40:07.120 --> 1:40:10.960]  to him during the break the what's happening to other veterans he knows I
[1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:15.520]  mean and then we've got every nutcase like Jim Carrey and criminals like
[1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:20.400]  Snoop Dogg saying turn our guns in I mean this is so hellish to go into
[1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:25.720]  bondage ladies and gentlemen it's so sad and and I know history I know this is
[1:40:25.720 --> 1:40:30.280]  red alert level and it's happening with a whimper not a bang it's just like well
[1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:34.280]  I hear him on talk radio well I know veterans that are like well I'll turn my
[1:40:34.280 --> 1:40:38.440]  guns in if they say I'm like you have no criminal record you own a business

[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:05.520]  double triple charge you for power and they're gonna have Glenn Beck get up
[1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:08.400]  there and say I'm a dangerous fascist because I say they're buying billions
[1:41:08.400 --> 1:41:13.840]  of bullets and armored vehicles when it's even in the news confirmed he's back
[1:41:13.840 --> 1:41:17.720]  at it saying there's no new world order in billerberg group and I'm not I'm just
[1:41:17.720 --> 1:41:24.480]  heaven help us if we can't even get Glenn back to talk about this stuff and by

[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:57.200]  pushes it pushes when it's incremental people make excuses people are in denial
[1:41:57.200 --> 1:42:01.960]  and then as it gets really bad they make bigger and bigger denials bigger and
[1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:07.520]  bigger compromises until you get to the point where the government says homeland
[1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:11.800]  security is for conservatives libertarians and veterans and a bunch of
[1:42:11.800 --> 1:42:14.720]  conservatives and libertarians are now getting so scared you hear them
[1:42:14.720 --> 1:42:18.360]  everywhere going I guess we'll turn our guns in I guess we'll have open borders
[1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:22.560]  I guess we'll I guess we'll raise taxes okay okay I'll go along with it you're
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:26.160]  seeing people you never thought who would fight back standing up and telling
[1:42:26.160 --> 1:42:30.600]  the truth and you're seeing people who you thought were good showing their
[1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:36.360]  operatives right now and I mean this is it okay so let's go to the victim who
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:41.280]  had his guns taken David Schmecker no judge no jury no nothing and they're
[1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:45.880]  telling him if he ever has guns again it's a felony and and again this is all
[1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:50.280]  happening to veterans right now with no media coverage no well you see it in
[1:42:50.280 --> 1:42:54.560]  Bloomberg about you know police confiscating guns in California it's

[1:44:53.880 --> 1:44:57.680]  gonna do regardless unless baby maybe if I had to wait this is around me it might
[1:44:57.680 --> 1:45:03.160]  have gone a little different but I was a soft target and they knew that this was
[1:45:03.160 --> 1:45:06.920]  all pre-prime no it's all criminal it's all it's a criminal conspiracy hiding
[1:45:06.920 --> 1:45:10.800]  in plain view it has a name it's called tyrannous California seizes guns of

[1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:43.440]  everything like that looking for some kind of contraband there could get me on
[1:45:43.440 --> 1:45:49.560]  then they told me that I needed to hand over the guns I had in my house I told
[1:45:49.560 --> 1:45:53.920]  them they were in my state they said well let us in your safe are we're gonna

[1:46:08.640 --> 1:46:15.120]  way there every every second of the way I was you know not going along with it
[1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:18.560]  willingly I was telling them this is this is all totally against the law you're
[1:46:18.560 --> 1:46:22.480]  not you don't have a warrant to do this there's no due process you I mean I don't
[1:46:22.480 --> 1:46:25.760]  even know where you're coming from how can you possibly imagine you could get
[1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:30.280]  away with this and they didn't they weren't even they weren't even afraid and
[1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:34.440]  again notice they worship veterans on TV everywhere while they're attacking you
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:38.240]  see that's how psyops work veterans are God veterans of the King join the
[1:46:38.240 --> 1:46:43.280]  military so we can get any pig you and put DU on you and then take your rights
[1:46:43.280 --> 1:46:47.120]  away after you've been in the military and again it's not military doing the
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:51.520]  mass shootings either they're literally saying a group of people is bad but it's
[1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:57.080]  not the Jews like Nazi Germany it's the veterans and the cops love going at your
[1:46:57.080 --> 1:47:10.320]  veterans now unbelievable keep going yeah that's a shot that's like you know
[1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:14.120]  thinking somebody putting a ditch in Nazi Germany thank you for oh yeah I saw
[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:19.040]  the Nazi Germany film reels the people would nod and bow politely to the Nazis
[1:47:19.040 --> 1:47:21.920]  and they would politely thank you get there with your kids I'm gonna mow you
[1:47:21.920 --> 1:47:39.800]  down thanks for being such a sport about this keep going oh that's already
[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:43.680]  started oh they've already announced in congressional hearings they're taking
[1:47:43.680 --> 1:47:52.080]  the pension funds for safekeeping though safekeeping David I love how it goes
[1:47:52.080 --> 1:47:56.400]  like mega banker gangsters private people are getting the Europeans money
[1:47:56.400 --> 1:48:02.880]  they're looting how's that sound yeah well I'm fighting this and I have a
[1:48:02.880 --> 1:48:08.480]  great attorney team a private investigator and an attorney team and they
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:14.320]  are gun rights champions tell us about them tell us about them well they're
[1:48:14.320 --> 1:48:18.760]  probably the best attorneys I could possibly found one of them is an NRA
[1:48:18.760 --> 1:48:23.960]  instructor and he's a gun rights attorney yeah you need to sue the cops
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:28.120]  personally for official oppression they violated all sorts of I don't care if
[1:48:28.120 --> 1:48:31.720]  they were given orders you need to savage them with civil rights lawsuits
[1:48:31.720 --> 1:48:37.080]  everything that's gonna happen I'm not stopping until I see everyone needs to
[1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:40.520]  sue them we need I mean that's what the we need to get aggressive they are
[1:48:40.520 --> 1:48:44.880]  kidnapping veterans outside of law I don't care if they're a criminal gang
[1:48:44.880 --> 1:48:48.200]  and they're and their mob boss told him to do it it doesn't make it okay because
[1:48:48.200 --> 1:48:53.720]  Don Carleone told you so just as he's wearing a blue uniform right first of
[1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:59.400]  what I have to do is I have to pursue getting my guns back at my pistol permit
[1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:04.280]  reinstated once that's it's gonna happen because they didn't have a warrant
[1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:08.920]  everything was wrong everything's gonna be you know non-void you have to have
[1:49:08.920 --> 1:49:12.400]  them refuse to do that first right and then they're gonna refuse to do that
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:17.520]  they're gonna violate more of the law right right I mean I could possibly
[1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:22.560]  never get my weapons back oh there's the headline US taps pension funds to avoid
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:27.080]  passing debt limit folks your pensions are already gone that's a good part all
[1:49:27.080 --> 1:49:30.400]  these cops your whole future is destroyed and you did it we don't have to do

[1:53:10.840 --> 1:53:15.120]  arrived in about 20 minutes but they were long gone with our TV jewelry and
[1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:20.160]  my guns I kept thinking what if my family had been home the police officer
[1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:25.040]  said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door and that dead bolts alone
[1:53:25.040 --> 1:53:30.160]  don't stop intruders the officer told me to go to easy armor net if we wanted

[1:54:08.600 --> 1:54:13.320]  radio network by the way when the Mexican drug cartel started killing cops
[1:54:13.320 --> 1:54:17.320]  they all just hid and the Mexico completely collapsed they were already
[1:54:17.320 --> 1:54:23.160]  mafia and it's the same thing here in the US clearly I think the evidence
[1:54:23.160 --> 1:54:27.880]  point starts Mexican mafia going around killing prosecutors assistant
[1:54:27.880 --> 1:54:32.880]  prosecutors in Colorado Texas one prosecutor in Denver just took out
[1:54:32.880 --> 1:54:36.400]  somebody trying to kill him in his house and they won't say who's that means
[1:54:36.400 --> 1:54:41.120]  it's politically correct probably they want to keep the implosion going but
[1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:44.880]  we'll see what comes out on that front the issue is in Dallas in surrounding
[1:54:44.880 --> 1:54:49.360]  areas they're in a fortress mentality like the mob bosses with police all
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:53.360]  around them that's not going to protect you and it just shows once the civil
[1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:57.400]  war starts I mean the police are just going to be just absolutely smashed and
[1:54:57.400 --> 1:55:04.000]  crushed but all these fake tough guys you know their giant potbellies and the
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:09.080]  rest of it I got a tiny one myself I'm just saying all you guys that are Mr.
[1:55:09.080 --> 1:55:12.040]  tough guy looking for trouble who don't like veterans and conservatives
[1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:15.280]  libertarians I know most of you aren't bad I get that that's why most
[1:55:15.280 --> 1:55:19.000]  departments won't be part of this but all these departments that do enjoy it I
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:25.400]  mean you might as well just go jump off you know a cliff you're crazy because the
[1:55:25.400 --> 1:55:28.840]  globalist in all their scripting want to start a civil war you heard it here
[1:55:28.840 --> 1:55:34.080]  first now it's mainstream news they want to push a fight between police and
[1:55:34.080 --> 1:55:40.360]  military and veterans and I mean when you really get real veterans to start
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:45.320]  pulling guns out I'm whoa I mean it's gonna make the Mexican mafia look like
[1:55:45.320 --> 1:55:50.040]  child's play and I mean you're gonna dead cops are gonna be stacked like
[1:55:50.040 --> 1:55:54.680]  cordwood and a couple cops and prosecutors get killed they run the ground
[1:55:54.680 --> 1:55:59.360]  okay the entire US military couldn't hold bagged at you're not gonna hold the
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:03.000]  United States but that's part of the plan they're gonna let the US just
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:08.800]  break down fall into anarchy shut down for a while then people beg for the
[1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:13.460]  feds to come back in and they're gonna stage atrocities and blaming on
[1:56:13.460 --> 1:56:18.000]  veterans I know their game plan okay that's the whole game plan that's what
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  the conditionings for right now to try to get the people on their side when
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:25.720]  they bring in the multinational force which includes Russians Chinese you
[1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:29.960]  name it and this all sounds crazy except it's in the Denver Post it's in the
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:34.520]  Associated Press there's the headline gun rights advocates fear UN treaty will
[1:56:34.520 --> 1:56:38.680]  lead to US registry this is the real globalist takeover plan that the
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:43.160]  weatherman planned bring America down get a communist president in arrest all
[1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:47.000]  libertarians and conservatives put 50 million of us in reeducation camps
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:51.080]  during a civil war they plan on controlling the cities and then they
[1:56:51.080 --> 1:56:55.520]  may take a decade to go out into the rural areas and hunt us all down that's
[1:56:55.520 --> 1:57:01.080]  what happens in World War Z in the book the UN hunts down American gun owners
[1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:05.600]  and kills us all and the zombies are their friends I'm not making that up
[1:57:05.600 --> 1:57:09.280]  that's actually the book I did a review of it and they say thank God the zombies
[1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:14.080]  took out American gun owners and the UN takes us down I mean that this is real
[1:57:14.080 --> 1:57:19.560]  folks I mean this is every movie every sitcom every drama and I want to open

[2:00:21.240 --> 2:00:25.840]  I just had a total epiphany during that one minute break I'm gonna talk about it
[2:00:25.840 --> 2:00:28.880]  when we come back from break and take veterans phone calls who have had their
[2:00:28.880 --> 2:00:33.120]  guns taken for no reason or they're trying to take your guns you're getting
[2:00:33.120 --> 2:00:39.720]  this wellness check they have a footnote of this can be about your guns and I
[2:00:39.720 --> 2:00:44.640]  mean they're taking the famous people's guns I know that are veterans who don't
[2:00:44.640 --> 2:00:49.280]  want to come on air or you going to try to buy a gun and you can't buy a gun
[2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:56.400]  now and it's a criminal takeover I mean the epiphany is we're in a civil war
[2:00:56.400 --> 2:01:00.760]  well I just had this total epiphany I've been so close to the problem the
[2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:06.840]  globalists are already in a foreign takeover Schmecker had to go to the
[2:01:06.840 --> 2:01:10.560]  bathroom he's coming back David Schmecker honorably discharged disabled
[2:01:10.560 --> 2:01:15.080]  US Navy veteran from Connecticut he had a back problem so they took his guns no
[2:01:15.080 --> 2:01:21.840]  criminal record and no psychiatric history and it's not like you think

[2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:30.600]  people you're clearly schizophrenic and then there could be a
[2:01:30.600 --> 2:01:35.160]  judification you're put in the mental hospital the problem is they'll use that
[2:01:35.160 --> 2:01:37.640]  against everybody's what's better to have nuts out there with guns cuz you're
[2:01:37.640 --> 2:01:41.120]  gonna take everybody's guns it's like hey I say get rid of the 68 gun control

[2:02:56.640 --> 2:03:03.080]  against people forced to force psyche valves without any due process to take

[2:03:54.960 --> 2:04:00.440]  so I need people support as well I mean this is serious and I just had a huge
[2:04:00.440 --> 2:04:04.720]  epiphany that we're already in a civil war we've got authoritarians that have
[2:04:04.720 --> 2:04:10.360]  hijacked Washington waging war against the bill of rights the people veterans
[2:04:10.360 --> 2:04:15.440]  in the states and demonizing us everywhere ahead of a big offensive do
[2:04:15.440 --> 2:04:20.000]  you agree with that statement absolutely David when you were in the Navy for five
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:23.240]  years did you ever imagine this would happen in America with Soviet style
[2:04:23.240 --> 2:04:27.760]  secret police psych ward police coming after you never never never I thought I

[2:08:56.760 --> 2:09:02.640]  over because make no mistake the tyranny and the lawlessness of government
[2:09:02.640 --> 2:09:09.360]  called tyranny is now taking place right now and obviously this broadcast is
[2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:15.280]  going to explode and spread as everything we've talked about unfortunately
[2:09:15.280 --> 2:09:26.120]  comes true and as our credibility rises like a rocket the danger increases and
[2:09:26.120 --> 2:09:30.920]  you've noticed I've doubled and tripled down with the rhetoric to match the
[2:09:30.920 --> 2:09:35.800]  reality I'm not gonna hold back here as we enter the dangerous zone here at
[2:09:35.800 --> 2:09:40.400]  info wars.com I am doubling and redoubling efforts I am pedal to the
[2:09:40.400 --> 2:09:47.080]  metal committed and I put my life in the hands of God commit my soul and you
[2:09:47.080 --> 2:09:50.480]  should commit your soul as well because rolling over to the tyranny that's
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:55.520]  taking place is going to destroy us strange days have found us my friends
[2:09:55.520 --> 2:10:01.200]  and if we don't stand up and speak out we're going to lose now I had a mega
[2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:08.840]  massive epiphany during the last break and at first I want to give you the
[2:10:08.840 --> 2:10:15.280]  definition of tyranny oppressive power every form of tyranny over the mind of
[2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:20.080]  man Thomas Jefferson the tyranny of a police state a government in which
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:25.360]  absolute power is vested in a single ruler especially one charismatic or
[2:10:25.360 --> 2:10:32.520]  an ancient Greek city-state absolutely a government in which absolute power is
[2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:38.640]  vested in a single ruler especially one charismatic one characteristic of an
[2:10:38.640 --> 2:10:42.240]  ancient Greek city-state the office authority and administration of a
[2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:48.440]  tyrant the rigorous condition imposed by some outside agency our force living
[2:10:48.440 --> 2:10:54.520]  under the tyranny of the clock an oppressive harsher unjust act is a
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:11:02.560]  tyrannical act and it goes on from there the refugees were fleeing tyranny he
[2:11:02.560 --> 2:11:09.000]  was dedicated to ending the tyranny of slavery a nation ruled by tyranny she
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:13.960]  felt lost in the bureaucratic tyrannies of the university system the king sought
[2:11:13.960 --> 2:11:22.400]  an absolute tyranny over the colonies cars freed Americans already infamous
[2:11:22.400 --> 2:11:27.200]  for their mobility from the tyranny of trained schedules tyranny tyranny
[2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:35.120]  tyranny autocratic centralized but I just had a total epiphany a mega massive
[2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:42.080]  epiphany during the break if you just joined us I had a veteran on no criminal
[2:11:42.080 --> 2:11:47.080]  record the police came with no warrant no judicial order no nothing because the
[2:11:47.080 --> 2:11:51.040]  VA said he wouldn't come in for a psychiatric evaluation when he's never
[2:11:51.040 --> 2:11:56.960]  had a psychiatric determination in the VA I mean this is totally outside a law
[2:11:56.960 --> 2:12:01.280]  they take his gun David Schmecker in Connecticut this is happening all over
[2:12:01.280 --> 2:12:04.800]  the country they're mailing these out I've got veterans loaded up on the phones
[2:12:04.800 --> 2:12:09.520]  right now this is the purge you hear about the communists going after people
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:13.160]  that weren't communists in China or Russia you hear about the Nazis going
[2:12:13.160 --> 2:12:17.240]  after Jews people put up with that group which was unpopular then it was
[2:12:17.240 --> 2:12:22.320]  everybody the group that Homeland Security says is number one is veterans
[2:12:22.320 --> 2:12:28.680]  then libertarians conservatives this is outrageous and it hit me like a mega
[2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:35.960]  ton of bricks it hit me so hard during the break but they're not trying to
[2:12:35.960 --> 2:12:45.600]  start a civil war we're in a civil war we're in a civil war where the federal
[2:12:45.600 --> 2:12:48.840]  government's been taken over by foreign banks they're signing us on to $85
[2:12:48.840 --> 2:12:54.040]  billion of debt a month giving it to foreign known mobster get Peters I mean
[2:12:54.040 --> 2:13:01.080]  actual gangsters the ones sucking the bank accounts dry in Europe they now
[2:13:01.080 --> 2:13:06.360]  admit it was a test and that they're gonna take everybody's bank accounts
[2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:09.600]  they're now saying they're gonna take our bank accounts and our pensions
[2:13:09.600 --> 2:13:14.960]  Congress is having hearings on it they're going to do it why shouldn't they
[2:13:14.960 --> 2:13:19.840]  because people are so afraid and they know that when they go and start
[2:13:19.840 --> 2:13:26.120]  confiscating the guns they're doing it a test right now every veteran I know has
[2:13:26.120 --> 2:13:28.880]  gotten the letter and they're going and they're being told so do you ever feel
[2:13:28.880 --> 2:13:32.320]  down do you ever get upset and the people are smart and go no I don't and
[2:13:32.320 --> 2:13:36.000]  they go I don't believe you I'm ordering your guns taken no judge no jury
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:39.760]  there's no way to win if you say well of course I get upset sometimes oh you're
[2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:44.640]  mentally ill there's AP US taps pension fund to avoid passing debt
[2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:53.160]  limit I mean it's all going to happen they're going to destroy us I can hardly
[2:13:53.160 --> 2:13:57.000]  breathe right now this is so incredible I mean I mean I never have anxiety and
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:13:59.640]  I'm having it right now maybe my gun should be taken ladies and gentlemen
[2:13:59.640 --> 2:14:04.360]  this is so real and it just hit me I've been so close to the problem that we're
[2:14:04.360 --> 2:14:10.760]  in the Civil War now every TV show drama nonfiction fiction sitcoms
[2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:19.760]  top movies you name it every single show that is out there every single
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:24.480]  broadcast that is out there says the gun owners or terrorists about to kill you
[2:14:24.480 --> 2:14:28.480]  it's not real but it doesn't matter the globalists are going to stage events and
[2:14:28.480 --> 2:14:33.040]  push people into events and then call us the terrorist reality has been
[2:14:33.040 --> 2:14:45.720]  suspended and this is cultural takeover a crusade a jihad an offensive a blitz
[2:14:45.720 --> 2:14:52.600]  creed call it what you will if they can go after veterans and say oh by the way
[2:14:52.600 --> 2:14:55.840]  homeless curries for veterans not for al-qaeda now by the way al-qaeda are the
[2:14:55.840 --> 2:15:02.440]  good guys that's in the news again today the rebranding they can do anything we

[2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:21.520]  globalist civil war where they are destroying the final vestiges of the
[2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:28.840]  Bill of Rights and Constitution right now and this is a war people are saying
[2:15:28.840 --> 2:15:32.400]  this is crazy how are they doing this it's a takeover they've already taken
[2:15:32.400 --> 2:15:39.440]  Europe over and and listen police departments everybody I know you've
[2:15:39.440 --> 2:15:42.960]  been given the word join the new world order be destroyed I know the awesome

[2:15:47.400 --> 2:15:52.080]  federal minion since California days I mean you're really watching that a real
[2:15:52.080 --> 2:15:58.920]  takeover with collaborators of America I mean this is real and the fact that I
[2:15:58.920 --> 2:16:02.880]  can't even get how bad it is and I'm saying they want to start a civil war
[2:16:02.880 --> 2:16:07.800]  we're in a civil cultural war and now it's a physical war where they're
[2:16:07.800 --> 2:16:12.960]  coming and grabbing veterans everywhere criminally outside of due process and
[2:16:12.960 --> 2:16:19.160]  taking their guns I mean my goodness gracious now I said I talked to veterans
[2:16:19.160 --> 2:16:24.920]  who were having their guns taken or have news on it and I want to go over this
[2:16:24.920 --> 2:16:27.840]  but but you've got to realize the magnitude you've got to really let this
[2:16:27.840 --> 2:16:33.120]  hit you and let it really sink in ladies and gentlemen that we're already in a

[2:19:03.880 --> 2:19:09.840]  got out I went to go get a pistol permit and I was I was the press for a
[2:19:09.840 --> 2:19:12.640]  little bit me and my wife we was going through some problems so I had went and
[2:19:12.640 --> 2:19:15.680]  saw a doctor about that and then subsequently you know we worked everything
[2:19:15.680 --> 2:19:20.560]  out however when I went to go get pistol permit the officer that was vetting me
[2:19:20.560 --> 2:19:25.960]  apparently because I wasn't adjudicated defective that is the only way by law
[2:19:25.960 --> 2:19:30.520]  that they can seize your firearms as if you're adjudicated defective by a judge
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:34.880]  in a court of law that's right well since he couldn't see that he kept asking me
[2:19:34.880 --> 2:19:38.600]  what happened here what happened there and I refused to tell him and ultimately
[2:19:38.600 --> 2:19:44.320]  he had to go ahead and sign off on my mom exactly and that was still color law
[2:19:44.320 --> 2:19:47.920]  and fraudulent but not completely criminal what they're doing with veterans

[2:24:55.160 --> 2:24:59.480]  background pressure pushing the American people the secret police the
[2:24:59.480 --> 2:25:03.600]  demonization the gun grabbing with turning off our power plants the
[2:25:03.600 --> 2:25:08.600]  regulations it's on and then when we break they study that and demonize it
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:13.800]  and then start the war this is a planned rollout of a war so if somebody
[2:25:13.800 --> 2:25:17.480]  didn't tell you America is now to state a war with North com run by foreign
[2:25:17.480 --> 2:25:22.000]  banks over it engage in a treasonous takeover in slow motion and now the
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:25.400]  heat's being turned up so yeah Chris called in and when I'm saying it's
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:31.120]  law is being legal he's giving details you have to be adjudicated as as as
[2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:35.360]  mentally defective that's actually the term in the brady act but they don't do
[2:25:35.360 --> 2:25:39.680]  that and and they tell you oh you're depressed you're having fight with your
[2:25:39.680 --> 2:25:43.320]  wife how about you just stop fighting with her and laugh at her that'll end
[2:25:43.320 --> 2:25:46.680]  all the arguments right there I'm here to tell you you know just act like I'm
[2:25:46.680 --> 2:25:51.160]  not saying that just act like a man like Don Corleone says act like a man the
[2:25:51.160 --> 2:25:55.120]  point is is it just don't fight the point is they tell you go to some shrink
[2:25:55.120 --> 2:26:00.120]  who's there spying on you nine times out of ten your enemy putting you in a
[2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:04.240]  record database when you go to the doctor it's the same thing so be aware
[2:26:04.240 --> 2:26:09.520]  folks the public schools the hospitals all of it they're eugenics groups since
[2:26:09.520 --> 2:26:15.360]  1910 okay they're all under race hygiene designation they never got rid of it
[2:26:15.360 --> 2:26:19.560]  they used to have a doctor say sterilize that whole family they sterilize you no
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:24.840]  law okay that's how they're doing this they're using the old illegal powers of
[2:26:24.840 --> 2:26:29.400]  the race hygiene office of the health department and health department state
[2:26:29.400 --> 2:26:33.480]  and federal law which is really regulatory to do it now that's the big
[2:26:33.480 --> 2:26:36.880]  enchilada that's how they're doing this and there are a bunch of criminals now
[2:26:36.880 --> 2:26:39.920]  I'm going back to you I'm ranting here Chris make your point I'm gonna get to
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:43.480]  then to Jesse and Sergeant freedom and the rest of them go ahead and so so so
[2:26:43.480 --> 2:26:47.320]  who was doing this number one why do you need a gun permit in North Carolina
[2:26:47.320 --> 2:26:51.640]  they've got me I guess you can go get a permit if you want one to concealed carry
[2:26:51.640 --> 2:26:55.000]  but everybody now thinks you got to have a permit to own a gun see how it's all
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:27:01.320]  psyops well what it is is it's a permit to purchase so I hear you get the permit
[2:27:01.320 --> 2:27:04.800]  to purchase the handgun and ultimately when you receive it it gives you the
[2:27:04.800 --> 2:27:08.680]  right to open carry which goes into my next point is that I call on all
[2:27:08.680 --> 2:27:13.840]  veterans all info warriors anywhere that open carry is allowed I really highly
[2:27:13.840 --> 2:27:17.720]  suggest that you do it because it has opened up many doors for me to get out
[2:27:17.720 --> 2:27:23.280]  the information about the 1.6 2 billion bullets have been sold by the Department
[2:27:23.280 --> 2:27:29.000]  of Homeland Security every time I open carry and different establishments that
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:34.880]  that sell off firearms and sell ammunition it enables you to bring it to
[2:27:34.880 --> 2:27:39.040]  conversation hey look there's no bullets right now because these guys are buying
[2:27:39.040 --> 2:27:44.360]  one point hey look there's a war going on America's been exactly if we can get
[2:27:44.360 --> 2:27:48.040]  the word out that this is a war they lose that's why they go there's no
[2:27:48.040 --> 2:27:51.960]  bullets there's no armored vehicles there's no gun control because it's a
[2:27:51.960 --> 2:27:56.360]  psyop God bless you sir who was telling you that the local police chief he knew
[2:27:56.360 --> 2:28:01.480]  you'd seen a psychologist for your marriage unbelievable he knew that he
[2:28:01.480 --> 2:28:06.520]  knew that and tried to not let you have a gun that's correct and actually they
[2:28:06.520 --> 2:28:09.520]  could see it but they was what they were trying to do they were trying to dig in
[2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:13.320]  because they couldn't see the like the notes in the system I guess that's why
[2:28:13.320 --> 2:28:17.120]  they're digitizing that was like ten billion dollars right now again folks you
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:21.160]  go to the dentist you go to the doctor you go to have a baby you go to this I
[2:28:21.160 --> 2:28:25.680]  mean now they say oh you had a car right once you go see the counselor school

[2:29:22.280 --> 2:29:25.360]  tricks them to fill it out come back and then later it asked are you ever
[2:29:25.360 --> 2:29:29.280]  depressed are you having any family problems and then they use that to take

[2:34:00.960 --> 2:34:07.360]  it'll buy you time folks this is a hard takeover okay I am a major military
[2:34:07.360 --> 2:34:12.280]  historian I know so much I scramble it all the time I don't have all the answers
[2:34:12.280 --> 2:34:17.440]  you could study one period of Greek or Roman or Babylonian history or or
[2:34:17.440 --> 2:34:21.280]  European history or Mesoamerican military history and I know it all but
[2:34:21.280 --> 2:34:26.840]  I'm a major student of the whole history of it and let me tell you something the
[2:34:26.840 --> 2:34:32.920]  entire architecture of this and what the system is setting up the entire
[2:34:32.920 --> 2:34:35.960]  architecture of this and what they're setting up what they admit they're
[2:34:35.960 --> 2:34:40.480]  doing and I told you 12 years out I said it's gonna be a for domestic total
[2:34:40.480 --> 2:34:44.720]  takeover targeting conservatives libertarians gun owners and veterans and
[2:34:44.720 --> 2:34:51.440]  people later said how did you know that because they always do man I tell you
[2:34:51.440 --> 2:34:57.040]  when you know history it's like watching a rerun of a TV show except we're in
[2:34:57.040 --> 2:35:04.320]  this thing and they plan to fully shut this country down except for a few model
[2:35:04.320 --> 2:35:10.160]  UN cities like Austin Texas by the grace of God this is where I was put for my
[2:35:10.160 --> 2:35:15.080]  family's from on my mom's side and it's a model of example where they're gonna
[2:35:15.080 --> 2:35:19.720]  turn off all the regulations for only insiders to where Austin can operate
[2:35:19.720 --> 2:35:23.080]  everybody else will be shut down too I mean it's just lawless they don't
[2:35:23.080 --> 2:35:25.280]  gonna just take money on your bank account they're not gonna let you
[2:35:25.280 --> 2:35:30.840]  operate and they and they're just smiley-faced crooks I mean they know
[2:35:30.840 --> 2:35:36.120]  they're criminal and this is their time and and all of you that decided to join
[2:35:36.120 --> 2:35:41.120]  it just remember you were warned because that's how God works in every case in
[2:35:41.120 --> 2:35:44.360]  history people come and tell you what's coming so that you have a chance to
[2:35:44.360 --> 2:35:49.520]  change and sometimes you do change none of us a great example a lot of times
[2:35:49.520 --> 2:35:54.400]  you don't and so just remember evil doers remember out there if you're not

[2:37:26.880 --> 2:37:33.320]  more detail and the questions that they're asking are I mean very very
[2:37:33.320 --> 2:37:37.400]  pointed you know where where are they where your ancestors from what color

[2:39:17.600 --> 2:39:21.960]  fronts they use to get new blood but yes I have had veterans call me in
[2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:26.120]  letters saying they're demanding my blood now in letters I mean this is
[2:39:26.120 --> 2:39:32.280]  imagine this is Nazi Germany this is for total persecution and they'll do

[2:39:55.120 --> 2:39:59.520]  ago when it was declassified so and I was told everything by a department of
[2:39:59.520 --> 2:40:06.320]  defense nurse who gave me the documents and anyways it's all a side issue what
[2:40:06.320 --> 2:40:09.920]  else do they ask you what's the name of the questionnaire and chances are it's
[2:40:09.920 --> 2:40:14.400]  already been scanned online what's the name of the questionnaire the question
[2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:21.760]  there is um gosh you know what you they can get it if they go to va.gov or they

[2:41:52.160 --> 2:41:56.280]  so they've said she's mentally ill they mean you go to these spies at the VA they
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:41:59.040]  say you're mentally ill because your legs blown off and you're bummed out your
[2:41:59.040 --> 2:42:02.960]  wife's depressed over how bad her life is everybody's going bankrupt and then
[2:42:02.960 --> 2:42:06.920]  they come and take your little kids and then they're five times to seven times
[2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:10.120]  more likely to abuse them and I and this is why I don't like doing this because
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:14.440]  it gets me very angry to know that they're that's the thing they're not
[2:42:14.440 --> 2:42:18.120]  just taking the guns from the vets they're harvesting your kids Jesse
[2:42:18.120 --> 2:42:23.960]  briefly tell folks what happened to you well they put me on the suicide pills
[2:42:23.960 --> 2:42:28.760]  and of course you know after taking those my mom calls up says look I don't
[2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:32.720]  know what to do the pills aren't working and you know you know you came back
[2:42:32.720 --> 2:42:37.360]  from heavy combat of course you he's gone crazy now so they send a slot team
[2:42:37.360 --> 2:42:41.800]  you know dishonor me in front of my family you know and you know everybody
[2:42:41.800 --> 2:42:47.440]  thinks I'm crazy now and I every time I go to VA if I've been locked up several
[2:42:47.440 --> 2:42:51.160]  times at the VA if I disagree with the doctor they'll send the VA police I have
[2:42:51.160 --> 2:42:55.800]  to be wanted to go into VA I'm not even allowed to go into my own veterans
[2:42:55.800 --> 2:43:00.800]  hospital without being wanted first and and you're saying they took your
[2:43:00.800 --> 2:43:07.000]  children on top of it they took my kid after my mom had called the you know the
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:11.200]  VA and then they call the swat team well yeah I mean I'm reading about vets in
[2:43:11.200 --> 2:43:15.960]  the news where if you now argue family all knows it and they watch the dramas
[2:43:15.960 --> 2:43:19.520]  and sitcoms so it's fun to bring down men in their home instead of praying for
[2:43:19.520 --> 2:43:23.960]  them loving them getting on healthy food going to church God can heal you and
[2:43:23.960 --> 2:43:28.080]  absolutely a hundred percent instead all the women jump up and down and go
[2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:32.400]  you're mentally ill now I'm of course then the kids get taken they freak out
[2:43:32.400 --> 2:43:36.240]  and don't like it so they call their friend the government and and they sit
[2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:41.400]  there and use it as a weapon ooh ooh he raised his voice he's a veteran I mean
[2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:46.440]  what a what a stinking system man is that how it happened me in court they
[2:43:46.440 --> 2:43:50.160]  lasted me in court they lasted me in the hospital when they didn't force
[2:43:50.160 --> 2:43:54.960]  injected me strapped down against my will didn't even tell me the drugs they
[2:43:54.960 --> 2:43:59.400]  were giving me and it was it was shameful I didn't even treat Iraq he's like
[2:43:59.400 --> 2:44:03.240]  that in Iraq well there's nothing worse than a veteran in America you didn't know
[2:44:03.240 --> 2:44:08.120]  that well well sir next they're gonna put you in forced labor camps that's the
[2:44:08.120 --> 2:44:13.600]  plans right now I don't I think they took my money I have I have to go to my
[2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:18.360]  mommy now to get money because she's my fiduciary you know they can come any
[2:44:18.360 --> 2:44:23.160]  time they want to in my house there's not having a right
[2:44:25.520 --> 2:44:31.520]  well God bless you sir I'm glad you at least got your child back but there you
[2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:35.760]  go make people serve five six seven tours and put them on drugs that I call
[2:44:35.760 --> 2:44:41.160]  suicide pills that say they make you go crazy they got about a third of the
[2:44:41.160 --> 2:44:46.960]  combat troops right now in those drugs and then when they come back they're
[2:44:46.960 --> 2:44:53.400]  going to take your guns and your children and and by the way I've seen it in
[2:44:53.400 --> 2:44:57.320]  the news you got a leg or an arm blown off and you tell them yeah I'm depressed
[2:44:57.320 --> 2:45:02.040]  about missing my legs your kids are gone and a fat pedophile is gonna have them
[2:45:02.040 --> 2:45:06.080]  raping them tonight they're gonna shoot your kid up with a vaccine you see them
[2:45:06.080 --> 2:45:10.840]  six months later your kids gonna have venereal diseases your three-year-old
[2:45:10.840 --> 2:45:15.000]  their body's gonna be torn open and they're gonna have their teeth fallen
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:20.360]  out oh I've had the parents send me the photos and the dossiers pedophiles are
[2:45:20.360 --> 2:45:23.200]  gonna rape your children morning noon and night and they're gonna shoot them
[2:45:23.200 --> 2:45:26.120]  up with vaccines until they have giant black circles around their eyes and
[2:45:26.120 --> 2:45:29.880]  crust all over their faces and their teeth fall out and then they're gonna
[2:45:29.880 --> 2:45:33.760]  start having seizures and then they're gonna put them on other drugs until your
[2:45:33.760 --> 2:45:40.920]  child dies that's a W.O.A.I. investigation they did that state legislature
[2:45:40.920 --> 2:45:44.920]  then did an investigation on because the doctor said we're some of the one-head
[2:45:44.920 --> 2:45:48.200]  doctors said I we take kids in that are healthy and a year later they're dead
[2:45:48.200 --> 2:45:53.940]  we're killing them but don't worry that doctor was relieved from command thank
[2:45:53.940 --> 2:46:00.480]  goodness human sacrifice alive and well in
[2:46:00.480 --> 2:46:05.120]  America let's go ahead and talk to Ron in New York has been calling me for about
[2:46:05.120 --> 2:46:10.200]  14 years he called me back when he was a cop he's retired now Ron tell us about
[2:46:10.200 --> 2:46:14.600]  this isn't this great no this isn't great Alex and it's something I in fact
[2:46:14.600 --> 2:46:18.360]  have been fighting against and you would find in police departments they've been
[2:46:18.360 --> 2:46:22.640]  using this this they they beta tested in police departments and then later was
[2:46:22.640 --> 2:46:28.840]  expanded out to the military and this is going on for about 20 years in fact this
[2:46:28.840 --> 2:46:33.520]  is a slow-motion process that they've been beta testing and now it's just come
[2:46:33.520 --> 2:46:37.120]  to the fore to where it's crystallized and it's being used against a very large
[2:46:37.120 --> 2:46:40.600]  group of people the veterans at this point and so it's a little bit more
[2:46:40.600 --> 2:46:45.280]  visible in fact I fought against this to the point that I actually formed an
[2:46:45.280 --> 2:46:49.960]  organization and challenged the NYPD back in the 1990s over just this issue and
[2:46:49.960 --> 2:46:56.160]  if you ever really want to get the inside on what's going on here you give me a
[2:46:56.160 --> 2:47:00.040]  phone number where I could speak to you off the air privately and I'll be glad
[2:47:00.040 --> 2:47:04.280]  to inform you when you have time to sit down and hear about it and you will be
[2:47:04.280 --> 2:47:08.760]  even twice as shocked as you are now at the things that I discovered and learned
[2:47:08.760 --> 2:47:12.920]  or when they were first trying to put these systems into effect they started
[2:47:12.920 --> 2:47:16.800]  with police departments NYPD by the way was probably one of the leaders in
[2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:21.320]  using this and by the way we believe to even all the way back in the 90s that
[2:47:21.320 --> 2:47:24.760]  they started to swap notes with the military which now I'm even more
[2:47:24.760 --> 2:47:29.160]  convinced of oh no no it's on record that actually the LAPD was the first then
[2:47:29.160 --> 2:47:35.640]  New York it's completely CIA run as a laboratory Ron you say you believe it
[2:47:35.640 --> 2:47:38.600]  just like you know stuff I don't know and I know stuff you don't know that's
[2:47:38.600 --> 2:47:44.160]  open intelligence that the CIA runs the NYPD they've since admitted it they have
[2:47:44.160 --> 2:47:49.640]  database for the NSA databases they have everything and you are the model for
[2:47:49.640 --> 2:47:55.040]  the rest of America you are the model there with the NYPD people think this
[2:47:55.040 --> 2:47:59.720]  just started last week this goes back about 20 years by the fact you could
[2:47:59.720 --> 2:48:04.760]  literally tack this on to the board starting about the time of Clinton and
[2:48:04.760 --> 2:48:08.280]  going forward from there oh no no Clinton tried this it is right
[2:48:08.280 --> 2:48:12.920]  remember Clinton tried to disarm 89,000 veterans remember that yes he was a
[2:48:12.920 --> 2:48:15.920]  beginning of it not the end of it but the beginning of it and that is about
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:22.040]  20 years and this thing is run by eugenicists in fact anyone who had what
[2:48:22.040 --> 2:48:26.840]  I refer to as the old morality meaning a true morality who was involved in this
[2:48:26.840 --> 2:48:32.640]  system was flooded out of this system I had people who in fact as I said I'll
[2:48:32.640 --> 2:48:35.840]  talk to you off the air if you have time and you've got a number we could speak
[2:48:35.840 --> 2:48:39.280]  privately and I'll inform you of things you do not know about and I know you
[2:48:39.280 --> 2:48:45.760]  don't know the father of that program to help offices in the NYPD who is
[2:48:45.760 --> 2:48:51.400]  genuinely a man who was well-intended at heart was actually flushed out he told
[2:48:51.400 --> 2:48:56.680]  me that they'll make decisions about you know decisions will be made about your
[2:48:56.680 --> 2:49:02.320]  psychiatric acumen based on whether you have hair coming out of your nose or
[2:49:02.320 --> 2:49:07.040]  your ear things like that you know some people may grow on here because in
[2:49:07.040 --> 2:49:11.600]  their mind that's associated with somebody who comes from in a racial group
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:17.800]  or maybe some biological background that to them is a mental inferior you know I
[2:49:17.800 --> 2:49:21.120]  actually knew this but I didn't know I don't have witnessed police to it I get
[2:49:21.120 --> 2:49:26.200]  everything is the 1910 eugenics board Margaret Sanger the Rockefeller Brothers
[2:49:26.200 --> 2:49:30.680]  Foundation in New York so that did start in New York and it was just a kook
[2:49:30.680 --> 2:49:33.680]  thing like I have a little bit of hair on my ear and they actually taught that
[2:49:33.680 --> 2:49:38.000]  you're a throwback a man whether black or white that has a lot of hair they
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:41.920]  call that a low IQ has nothing to do with it folks and I have hair on me it
[2:49:41.920 --> 2:49:48.600]  means high testosterone level they're listing men as as a bad thing and no no
[2:49:48.600 --> 2:49:52.640]  no I actually know about that well they did that up until the 70s and 80s in
[2:49:52.640 --> 2:49:58.440]  Oregon they would sterilize 14-year-olds that had a lot of hair and you say well
[2:49:58.440 --> 2:50:02.000]  that just sounds crazy at the state board when they were talking about how
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:06.720]  they put the average Texas kid in foster care on seven drugs and how they're
[2:50:06.720 --> 2:50:11.000]  dying from the drugs the it's in my film in game I have the clip the head of the
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:14.720]  psychiatry board says well she goes well you do task-free put them on drugs

[3:01:25.480 --> 3:01:29.640]  Republic so they can have their way with us well guess what criminals where this
[3:01:29.640 --> 3:01:36.280]  is not happening in a vacuum I see you you see me I'm glad you see me
[3:01:36.280 --> 3:01:41.960]  Tom in New York you're a vet what do you think of the purge of veterans that's
[3:01:41.960 --> 3:01:50.800]  not even being reported on hello yes sir yeah I'd like to address some of the
[3:01:50.800 --> 3:01:56.040]  concerns of you guessed David there we had a similar situation here in New
[3:01:56.040 --> 3:02:03.680]  York while we're not vets in any way I was doing some long-term litigation
[3:02:03.680 --> 3:02:07.840]  these are pro se cases in the federal courts yeah no they're not coming out
[3:02:07.840 --> 3:02:11.960]  people that sue them I know they're just a mafia of scum the answer is get back
[3:02:11.960 --> 3:02:15.320]  on the mafia's face and if all of us start getting in their face they'll
[3:02:15.320 --> 3:02:18.400]  turn their tail and run they think we've rolled over so now they're getting
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:22.680]  ready to take the bank accounts well we were nailing them pretty good in federal
[3:02:22.680 --> 3:02:27.920]  court we were taking some corrupt law enforcement agencies into the federal
[3:02:27.920 --> 3:02:34.360]  courts and not during the course of that I have a elderly mother who's 80 years
[3:02:34.360 --> 3:02:38.160]  old she's doing a lot of the secretarial work in the cases they came
[3:02:38.160 --> 3:02:43.040]  after her double the lawsuits go ahead right well she ended up being
[3:02:43.040 --> 3:02:48.480]  involuntarily confined almost in exactly oh yeah they're really targeting old
[3:02:48.480 --> 3:02:51.560]  people in the state taking all their money oh yeah that's their favorite yeah
[3:02:51.560 --> 3:02:56.360]  mm-hmm yeah you know you know to make matters worse there was a it was just a
[3:02:56.360 --> 3:03:04.280]  couple hours visit to the hospital they nailed her with a $15,000 bill you know
[3:03:04.280 --> 3:03:08.600]  no no this guy they took his guns that they did the same thing so now you sue
[3:03:08.600 --> 3:03:13.840]  them and put the bill back on them right well anyway yeah we ended up taking
[3:03:13.840 --> 3:03:20.680]  that issue into federal courts yeah and we recently got a ruling down from the
[3:03:20.680 --> 3:03:25.880]  district court in northern New York and the ruling is you know the blatantly
[3:03:25.880 --> 3:03:30.280]  unconstitutional type of yeah they're saying they're gonna come on they're
[3:03:30.280 --> 3:03:34.880]  gonna send you for a mental evaluation and make you pay for it right but you
[3:03:34.880 --> 3:03:39.960]  know the ruling we got was that it was completely unconstitutional in our case
[3:03:39.960 --> 3:03:44.560]  now it's that's heading to trial you know we have a right to trial in the issue
[3:03:44.560 --> 3:03:48.080]  oh well that's great wait are you saying the court ruled against you or for you
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:52.760]  no no for us well great job you ought to write an article about it cite your

[3:08:45.560 --> 3:08:49.360]  I'll have time to get to all this and have it all prepared and ready we're
[3:08:49.360 --> 3:08:53.600]  here taking your phone calls today first clip we're gonna play is Obama's
[3:08:53.600 --> 3:08:58.400]  alien secret service spotted at 2012 APAC conference because I want to
[3:08:58.400 --> 3:09:02.360]  illustrate how the media uses kooky stuff like this and then discredit real
[3:09:02.360 --> 3:09:05.920]  issues and the second clip we're gonna play is Obama's ex-secret service
[3:09:05.920 --> 3:09:10.280]  agent is it's it's not gun control it's people control because that's the actual
[3:09:10.280 --> 3:09:14.280]  secret service agent that's clearly they're saying is a reptoid and then I
[3:09:14.280 --> 3:09:21.680]  want to play Obama you know basically you people saying he's a shapeshifter and
[3:09:21.680 --> 3:09:25.320]  then I've got a bunch of other clips I'm gonna give to here and how the system
[3:09:25.320 --> 3:09:32.120]  uses this to try to basically discredit all the serious issues and things that
[3:09:32.120 --> 3:09:38.520]  are going on okay so we're gonna be going to that here in just a moment but
[3:09:38.520 --> 3:09:44.000]  right now let's go to Scott in Idaho Scott you're on the air welcome
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:52.760]  hello yeah go ahead hey hi Alex I wanted to talk something about the court
[3:09:52.760 --> 3:09:57.760]  system in this country because that seems to be a place where a lot of us are
[3:09:57.760 --> 3:10:04.120]  ending up at the civil lawsuits that need to be filed are under title 42
[3:10:04.120 --> 3:10:12.160]  subsection 1983 and title 18 subsection 242 I mean it's just like they can't
[3:10:12.160 --> 3:10:18.440]  do me for a radio now it's just like they can't take people's bank accounts
[3:10:18.440 --> 3:10:22.080]  without a judge or jury or finding that they did something wrong they just do
[3:10:22.080 --> 3:10:25.560]  it here now and they're doing it overseas they already take money out of
[3:10:25.560 --> 3:10:29.040]  people's accounts the IRS will seize your entire business account as part of
[3:10:29.040 --> 3:10:33.640]  an investigation never give it back it's lawless tyranny and so now they're
[3:10:33.640 --> 3:10:37.800]  going to take everything because we rolled over and follow the orders because
[3:10:37.800 --> 3:10:43.120]  we didn't have spinal cords and yes it's official oppression it is civil
[3:10:43.120 --> 3:10:48.520]  rights violations on so many fronts it is it is just Soviet-style tyranny go
[3:10:48.520 --> 3:10:53.960]  ahead in this country the only people that have rights in the courts and
[3:10:53.960 --> 3:10:58.880]  outside the courts are people that demand the rights in the face of
[3:10:58.880 --> 3:11:03.240]  opposition if you don't know what your rights are then you don't have any
[3:11:03.240 --> 3:11:06.640]  that's that then that's 101 the first thing they teach you to any law school
[3:11:06.640 --> 3:11:11.360]  is what you just said but they tell people grovel and you get your rights
[3:11:11.360 --> 3:11:15.480]  and then now turn your guns in that's because they're gonna get rid of all
[3:11:15.480 --> 3:11:20.880]  the rights folks and the general public so cowardly that even as they lose
[3:11:20.880 --> 3:11:24.600]  everything they will worship the government because they think worshiping
[3:11:24.600 --> 3:11:32.720]  tyranny is powerful that's right Alex and it's not it's not no mystery to go
[3:11:32.720 --> 3:11:37.520]  into the courts and demand your rights I've been very successful at helping
[3:11:37.520 --> 3:11:42.240]  other people do it I teach people how to do it and to date I want help people
[3:11:42.240 --> 3:11:49.740]  win 115 out of 127 criminal cases and 51 out of 63 civil cases including a
[3:11:49.740 --> 3:11:53.760]  lawsuit against the Northern Idaho Login Company that was being sued by the
[3:11:53.760 --> 3:11:59.200]  state of Montana because someone got injured on the job beautiful beautiful
[3:11:59.200 --> 3:12:02.840]  send me your info and God bless you now I'll go to more calls here but I wanted
[3:12:02.840 --> 3:12:07.640]  to get to this now and I meant to cover it earlier in the broadcast and it had
[3:12:07.640 --> 3:12:14.320]  it has to do with Glenback and several other issues and it's just this I played
[3:12:14.320 --> 3:12:17.560]  a clip earlier today at Glenback saying there are no billions of bullets I'm a
[3:12:17.560 --> 3:12:23.800]  liar and I'm a fascist for saying it and then I'm a piece of garbage and there
[3:12:23.800 --> 3:12:27.080]  are no FEMA camps even though you can look at civilian inmate labor camp
[3:12:27.080 --> 3:12:34.400]  program army dot mill going on since the 70s and 80s you can type in emergency
[3:12:34.400 --> 3:12:40.360]  centers establishment act you can you can type in the army field manuals that
[3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:47.160]  deal with reeducation camps actually call them that it's like saying you know
[3:12:47.160 --> 3:12:50.640]  devil camps they even use that usually that you know they could they call
[3:12:50.640 --> 3:12:56.440]  tyranny something nice like come in for a well check when we take your guns and
[3:12:56.440 --> 3:13:01.440]  go to gov track dot US HR 645 national emergency establishment act and it
[3:13:01.440 --> 3:13:05.360]  points out the FEMA camp program that are already there it just wants to expand
[3:13:05.360 --> 3:13:10.200]  it and make a national office for it and just as I predicted that you know
[3:13:10.200 --> 3:13:14.520]  they'll have rock and roll music or country music on Friday night it's all
[3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:20.400]  how great the reeducation camps are like like Hogan's heroes you don't think the
[3:13:20.400 --> 3:13:24.080]  Nazis came out and said we have horrible death camps do you the Nazis came
[3:13:24.080 --> 3:13:28.360]  out and said oh people are beating up the Jews and people which the Nazis had
[3:13:28.360 --> 3:13:31.520]  ordered and you can't pay for yourselves because we shut down your businesses
[3:13:31.520 --> 3:13:38.760]  years ago and been harassing you like the veterans now we're just going to go
[3:13:38.760 --> 3:13:44.160]  and put you in a place for your own safety it actually says it in the
[3:13:44.160 --> 3:13:50.400]  congressional bill too but it doesn't exist and to try to discredit us on
[3:13:50.400 --> 3:13:55.480]  this front Becky Poo and again you folks you know I don't attack the other talk
[3:13:55.480 --> 3:14:00.320]  show host very very rarely because you know if I can agree with more of what
[3:14:00.320 --> 3:14:05.040]  they're doing than bad and they're not flaming tyrants like Rush Limbaugh or
[3:14:05.040 --> 3:14:09.200]  Michael Savage or whatever if I can agree with them on some issues then I I
[3:14:09.200 --> 3:14:11.960]  mean I'll have them on I've had Michael Savage on I want to get him by the way
[3:14:11.960 --> 3:14:15.960]  back on I mean I'm here to try to influence them not getting a fight with
[3:14:15.960 --> 3:14:20.640]  them but Glenn Beck people are asking to watch this for like a week and I said
[3:14:20.640 --> 3:14:24.400]  I'm not gonna watch it you know Secret Service turns into reptoid I mean there
[3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:27.960]  are literally hundreds of videos let's let's be conservative thousands of
[3:14:27.960 --> 3:14:33.880]  videos on YouTube where I'm supposedly a reptoid we're gonna play that video here
[3:14:33.880 --> 3:14:40.880]  in just a moment now the point here is that you know they'll take digital
[3:14:40.880 --> 3:14:46.360]  distortion when a video feed breaks up and say that's Alex the reptoid you
[3:14:46.360 --> 3:14:51.160]  know turning into one and then that's wildly popular instead of real stuff
[3:14:51.160 --> 3:14:56.600]  like civilian inmate labor camp program or army manual for reeducation camps I
[3:14:56.600 --> 3:15:00.800]  mean you type that in you're an army dot mill I mean this is big breaking news
[3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:06.120]  no one will cover but they'll talk about it my Bill Hicks all day now I would get
[3:15:06.120 --> 3:15:09.160]  it if Glenn Beck was covering this to make fun of people and said look at
[3:15:09.160 --> 3:15:14.280]  these nuts making us look bad saying you know the Secret Service guy is an
[3:15:14.280 --> 3:15:20.640]  alien I would I would you know say well that's interesting good job Glenn Beck
[3:15:20.640 --> 3:15:26.520]  I want I've said to Glenn Beck please stop attacking me please stop saying I'm
[3:15:26.520 --> 3:15:31.320]  a fascist please stop saying your listeners I can't be trusted please stop
[3:15:31.320 --> 3:15:34.760]  saying I'm lying about the bullets we're gonna play those clips coming up please
[3:15:34.760 --> 3:15:37.600]  stop it in fact for radio listeners let me give them the army manual free
[3:15:37.600 --> 3:15:42.000]  education camps how to process your family social security numbers all of it
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  yes scroll down it's FM 3-39.40 FM 3-39.40 internment resettlement
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:56.600]  operations February 2010 okay so the point is Glenn Beck will not cover this he
[3:15:56.600 --> 3:15:59.560]  built it up for a month that he was gonna expose the FEMA camps and then said
[3:15:59.560 --> 3:16:03.080]  they didn't exist and I predicted he would use a straw man fake camp that I
[3:16:03.080 --> 3:16:07.560]  identified 15 years ago so I'm trying to keep Glenn Beck honest here I don't
[3:16:07.560 --> 3:16:11.440]  want to hurt Glenn Beck okay I think overall he does some good I don't know
[3:16:11.440 --> 3:16:16.000]  whether he's an operative the attacks me or he's a gatekeeper or both but the
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:19.560]  point is is that he knows full well the FEMA camps are real he knows full well
[3:16:19.560 --> 3:16:22.800]  the bullets are real and you know he's acting like the ADL the Southern
[3:16:22.800 --> 3:16:27.920]  Private Law Center now this video we're gonna play is viral millions of years of
[3:16:27.920 --> 3:16:32.560]  saying a secret service agent is an alien and I was like where have I seen
[3:16:32.560 --> 3:16:37.520]  that guy before because he looks striking and he's a Sicilian
[3:16:37.520 --> 3:16:45.000]  Bajino is his name and Cecily was invaded by Africans so you know he's got
[3:16:45.000 --> 3:16:50.520]  striking African and Italian handsome features but in digitized blown-up
[3:16:50.520 --> 3:16:56.000]  video you could see some of the pixels and they say he's an alien now I had
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:16:59.400]  remembered seeing him when he came out for the Second Amendment I went I've
[3:16:59.400 --> 3:17:04.620]  seen that striking chiseled jaw looks like the thing or something from the
[3:17:04.620 --> 3:17:10.280]  Fantastic Four I've seen that superhero look and face sure enough I pulled it up
[3:17:10.280 --> 3:17:14.640]  I found the evil alien and let me tell you if he's the shape-shifting alien we
[3:17:14.640 --> 3:17:23.120]  need more of him because because the guy is you know left the secret service
[3:17:23.120 --> 3:17:27.680]  over what's happening now now I know it's Bajino or it's his brother because
[3:17:27.680 --> 3:17:34.840]  he is a striking looking guy okay and he was like a pit bull or something but
[3:17:34.840 --> 3:17:39.280]  the point is is that he's not from planet Pop-Tart now what does Glenn Beck do
[3:17:39.280 --> 3:17:44.240]  where does he enter the story he plays the video last week I finally saw this
[3:17:44.240 --> 3:17:47.320]  last night research researching it people kept singing okay I'll watch the
[3:17:47.320 --> 3:17:51.160]  alien I'm like I've seen that guy before now he's a secret service agent this
[3:17:51.160 --> 3:17:54.840]  pro-second amendment he's not an alien from you know boobalbop or whatever it
[3:17:54.840 --> 3:17:59.760]  is Glenn Beck comes in and goes oh the Bilderberg group oh the New World Order
[3:17:59.760 --> 3:18:04.320]  oh the Jews oh and he's the guy always saying there's no Illuminati
[3:18:04.320 --> 3:18:09.240]  congressional history George Washington wrote letters about it mainline
[3:18:09.240 --> 3:18:14.480]  history there's no bullets there's there's no Bilderberg every year he says
[3:18:14.480 --> 3:18:18.520]  we're bad to cover Bilderberg 125 mafia meeting to decide the future of the
[3:18:18.520 --> 3:18:26.800]  world so he at key points he comes and defends the establishment I mean I mean
[3:18:26.800 --> 3:18:32.080]  it's just amazing that he does this type of stuff and then says I can't be
[3:18:32.080 --> 3:18:37.160]  trusted what I can't be trusted to be a coward I can't be trusted to be a scam
[3:18:37.160 --> 3:18:41.320]  artist I I can't be trusted to charge people three times what Goldsworth you
[3:18:41.320 --> 3:18:49.240]  know I mean Glenn Beck leave me alone okay leave me alone because I can't help

[3:19:29.520 --> 3:19:34.680]  comical piece where it's talking about at the APAC conference that they're
[3:19:34.680 --> 3:19:40.760]  lizard people and then they show the Secret Service guy here it is during
[3:19:40.760 --> 3:19:46.280]  Barack Obama's speech at 2012 APAC policy conference at the Washington
[3:19:46.280 --> 3:19:51.080]  Convention Center the camera spotted a very odd individual who may be either
[3:19:51.080 --> 3:19:56.560]  with the US Secret Service or with the Israel's and could be a strong evidence
[3:19:56.560 --> 3:20:01.500]  of a shapeshifter alien humanoid working for the powers that be caught in a high
[3:20:01.500 --> 3:20:06.440]  definition video during an event of the Zionist cabal
[3:20:06.440 --> 3:20:11.400]  the Zionist cabal
[3:20:11.400 --> 3:20:16.400]  four years ago I stood before you and said that Israel security is sacrosanct
[3:20:16.400 --> 3:20:24.200]  it is non-negotiable that belief has guided my actions as president even
[3:20:24.200 --> 3:20:28.680]  though at first sight he looks just like the average Secret Service spook a
[3:20:28.680 --> 3:20:34.080]  series of odd features on his head face plus a very strange behavior and
[3:20:34.080 --> 3:20:40.680]  creepy movements suggest something else but due to the low lighting in half the
[3:20:40.680 --> 3:20:45.680]  amphitheater he would pass unnoticed or regarded as a normal human being by the
[3:20:45.680 --> 3:20:50.680]  crowd and everybody who watched this video if it was not by the camera of
[3:20:50.680 --> 3:20:55.240]  the Jewish news one which caught him from another angle camera of the Jewish
[3:20:55.240 --> 3:21:00.040]  watch some sort of reptilian non-human form
[3:21:06.520 --> 3:21:11.000]  now they blow up digital footage
[3:21:16.800 --> 3:21:21.800]  and they say digital disregard all the distortions and image artifacts caused
[3:21:21.800 --> 3:21:26.400]  by post-edition zooming and pay close attention to how his head features
[3:21:26.400 --> 3:21:32.800]  suddenly change his ears his nose his chin cheekbone
[3:21:32.800 --> 3:21:37.640]  joran man let's stop right there I mean anybody that blows up video that level
[3:21:37.640 --> 3:21:40.920]  knows that's what it does so they say never mind I don't think Limbeck says
[3:21:40.920 --> 3:21:45.600]  it's true he goes look notice how they say never mind the video distortion but
[3:21:45.600 --> 3:21:51.360]  look at the distortion and and and so there's that clip now here is the actual
[3:21:51.360 --> 3:21:56.680]  secret service agent and it's him I mean I bet money you look it up that he was at
[3:21:56.680 --> 3:22:01.080]  that event of not it's his cousin Obama's former secret service agent it was
[3:22:01.080 --> 3:22:07.080]  Obama's agent one of his head agents so that's him gun control on Fox and
[3:22:07.080 --> 3:22:10.120]  Friends this is a fascinating conversation between Tucker Carlson and
[3:22:10.120 --> 3:22:15.480]  the originator of the statement former secret service agent Dan Bongino am I
[3:22:15.480 --> 3:22:21.800]  pronouncing that right all right now here he is all the way 14 trillion year
[3:22:21.800 --> 3:22:28.160]  old reptoid all the way from Sicily here ladies and gentlemen to tell us that we
[3:22:28.160 --> 3:22:32.240]  shouldn't turn our guns in so are the aliens our friends people actually think
[3:22:32.240 --> 3:22:36.000]  I make serious saying that now now they see this is all funny but luckily we
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:40.160]  found out who he is my memory did so that's some breaking news we now know
[3:22:40.160 --> 3:22:44.200]  who the reptoid is I'm joking that the thing is then Beck mixes it with
[3:22:44.200 --> 3:22:48.760]  Bilderberg Illuminati which is all real to discredit it just like he always does
[3:22:48.760 --> 3:22:54.360]  playing that classic straw man mixing things together tactic and every time I
[3:22:54.360 --> 3:22:58.480]  watch Becker seem it's it's pure manipulation I'm going to his listeners
[3:22:58.480 --> 3:23:04.760]  you can only trust me no one else I mean it is like creepy but a crew member
[3:23:04.760 --> 3:23:08.440]  going you can trust me and no one else I mean how about your fired you creep I
[3:23:08.440 --> 3:23:12.200]  mean I mean it's just where are people's instincts of course the creep
[3:23:12.200 --> 3:23:16.320]  doesn't like me I don't know what Glenn Beck's deal is when I say I can bring
[3:23:16.320 --> 3:23:19.680]  him down I mean I could start really going after him on all the frauds he's
[3:23:19.680 --> 3:23:23.840]  involved in lying to people and how he knows full well about bullets and other
[3:23:23.840 --> 3:23:27.800]  stuff and his sponsors and everything else but I'm just I don't I got bigger
[3:23:27.800 --> 3:23:31.960]  fish to fry but I mean I am tempted to really let Beck have it I mean really a
[3:23:31.960 --> 3:23:36.800]  planned prosecuted war against him just to show him what I can do so he'll leave
[3:23:36.800 --> 3:23:42.000]  me alone but but I'd rather just would make me a good guy and leave me alone you
[3:23:42.000 --> 3:23:45.640]  know but side issue doesn't matter Becky poo I know your people are watching
[3:23:45.640 --> 3:23:49.560]  right now want to say hi to him know what you're so worried about buddy it's a
[3:23:49.560 --> 3:23:53.320]  growing pie we're not collectivist here I want a future for my kids don't you
[3:23:53.320 --> 3:23:58.960]  then leave me alone stop calling me a socialist and a fascist all this crap
[3:23:58.960 --> 3:24:07.400]  all right again stop lying to your listeners okay don't start fights you
[3:24:07.400 --> 3:24:11.960]  know that you don't write checks you can't cash bud all right now let's go back
[3:24:11.960 --> 3:24:19.200]  here let's go back now to the next clip of the secret service agent Lord of the
[3:24:19.200 --> 3:24:24.440]  pop tarpians here it is that flag represents something men and women have
[3:24:24.440 --> 3:24:30.160]  died a horrible deaths horrible deaths my uncle being one of them shot in the
[3:24:30.160 --> 3:24:35.080]  back in Vietnam to protect your very right we live in a society the mannerisms
[3:24:35.080 --> 3:24:41.480]  the same guy do not fight back by creating more sheep our next guest says
[3:24:41.480 --> 3:24:46.120]  there is no such thing as gun control only people control you just saw him
[3:24:46.120 --> 3:24:49.480]  giving a passionate speech in a rally in Maryland joining us now is former
[3:24:49.480 --> 3:24:53.320]  secret service agent Dan Bunjino Dan thanks a lot for joining that's him what
[3:24:53.320 --> 3:24:57.640]  you mean there's no threat to it only people control tell me what that means
[3:24:57.640 --> 3:25:02.440]  Tucker this is part your ideological ploy by this administration they're not
[3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:06.400]  being authentic with America whether it's the sequesterer health care or the
[3:25:06.400 --> 3:25:10.200]  gun control issue what they do is they manipulate an emotional crisis a
[3:25:10.200 --> 3:25:14.920]  national emotional crisis to further an ideological agenda which involves
[3:25:14.920 --> 3:25:19.760]  involves the evaporation I want him on slow disintegration of your civil rights
[3:25:19.760 --> 3:25:23.720]  500 bucks whoever gets you money to live and let live and it's a disturbing
[3:25:23.720 --> 3:25:28.760]  pattern I think 5,000 for the Obama lady it under my skin I once read where you
[3:25:28.760 --> 3:25:32.240]  said that when you were in the business of protecting public figures when you
[3:25:32.240 --> 3:25:36.800]  went to a place with gun control you didn't feel safer right I mean we have
[3:25:36.800 --> 3:25:41.600]  this downtown abbey class of politicians and bureaucrats who they
[3:25:41.600 --> 3:25:46.720]  understand as clear as day that gun control has absolute which by the way
[3:25:46.720 --> 3:25:50.800]  is a myth that they're manipulating the language gun control with air quotes has
[3:25:50.800 --> 3:25:55.440]  no effect whatsoever on violence or the ability of a of wolves in our society to
[3:25:55.440 --> 3:25:59.400]  impart violence on you being a two-tier system where privileged people mayor
[3:25:59.400 --> 3:26:04.640]  Bloomberg for example are surrounded by bodyguards and there's even bad video
[3:26:04.640 --> 3:26:08.200]  edits in that from online and digital artifacts there people say that sees a
[3:26:08.200 --> 3:26:11.920]  reptoid well if he's a reptoid these are good aliens I mean they're there they're
[3:26:11.920 --> 3:26:17.160]  here to help us here so we can protect ourselves okay so so that's it on that
[3:26:17.160 --> 3:26:23.560]  front here's Glenn back talking about this video and then we'll go to Glenn
[3:26:23.560 --> 3:26:28.320]  Beck attacking me but here's Glenn back mixing people calling this guy a space
[3:26:28.320 --> 3:26:32.520]  alien when you see him giving his speech he's got the same mannerism of a guy's
[3:26:32.520 --> 3:26:35.560]  got a lot of energy like Jesse Ventura has that was the kind of guys you don't
[3:26:35.560 --> 3:26:37.760]  want to start a fight with they're just got so much energy they're all over the
[3:26:37.760 --> 3:26:39.920]  place that's what secret service does they're looking for somebody with a
[3:26:39.920 --> 3:26:43.920]  weapon they're like oh look he's moving strange he's an alien in like bad lighting
[3:26:43.920 --> 3:26:48.960]  digital artifact oh my gosh you know oh my gosh he's an alien and then Glenn
[3:26:48.960 --> 3:26:53.120]  Beck uses this to attach it to Bilderberg and to attach it to the
[3:26:53.120 --> 3:26:57.520]  Illuminati and to anybody that criticizes him so he's implying if you believe in
[3:26:57.520 --> 3:27:01.320]  Bilderberg and Illuminati you think this guy's a space alien see how that works
[3:27:01.320 --> 3:27:05.680]  see how you're being treated out there let's go to this clip I can finally spill
[3:27:05.680 --> 3:27:10.920]  it because I have been surrounded by Illuminati
[3:27:10.920 --> 3:27:15.360]  you can finally spill it to Illuminati and what a burgers at bacon cheeseburgers
[3:27:15.360 --> 3:27:21.560]  lizard people mm-hmm and and Zionist well I mean Zionist goes without saying
[3:27:21.560 --> 3:27:25.280]  when you talk a lot of burgers Bilderberg is lizard people you know Zionists own
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:30.160]  all those okay and things most of the chain the blaze the blaze is reporting
[3:27:30.160 --> 3:27:37.000]  on a story that was on last night and I tell you it's incontrovertible proof is
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:41.960]  and we just have to play this for you now the blaze is spinning us this is you
[3:27:41.960 --> 3:27:47.720]  know some conspiracy theory so typical so typical of the blaze so obviously
[3:27:47.720 --> 3:27:51.440]  when you have proof there's no longer conspiracy right and they don't approve
[3:27:51.440 --> 3:27:55.480]  right and so they're there of course this is what the media does all right
[3:27:55.480 --> 3:27:59.120]  that's enough turn it off so see everybody's a conspiracy theorist but
[3:27:59.120 --> 3:28:03.200]  him Bilderberg done every year he criticizes when we cover it and Glenn
[3:28:03.200 --> 3:28:07.840]  again if you will just send to the great vomit message notice you post some of
[3:28:07.840 --> 3:28:11.200]  articles the blaze and maybe that's your people and not you that you're gonna
[3:28:11.200 --> 3:28:15.080]  stop lying about me and stop doing stuff like this I'll leave you alone plus I
[3:28:15.080 --> 3:28:18.160]  don't really talk about you anyways you don't care whatever the point is stop
[3:28:18.160 --> 3:28:22.160]  saying I'm making up the bullets and stuff we need to save this country you're
[3:28:22.160 --> 3:28:26.440]  discredit yourself though your audience knows the bullet stories real I mean I
[3:28:26.440 --> 3:28:31.120]  just can't believe you get away with this I mean I'd expect Chuckie Schumer to
[3:28:31.120 --> 3:28:35.240]  say something like that now here is a few clips of Glenn Beck talking about me
[3:28:35.240 --> 3:28:38.840]  in the last few months the things he's been saying I just just just go to some
[3:28:38.840 --> 3:28:43.680]  of the clips here you know Alex Joan you piece of garbage I don't know what
[3:28:43.680 --> 3:28:48.800]  your deal is I really don't know and I don't care but if you if if you actually
[3:28:48.800 --> 3:28:52.440]  cared about the things you were talking about mm-hmm you would you would
[3:28:52.440 --> 3:28:58.080]  actually use your brain and start to find different ways than just going to
[3:28:58.080 --> 3:29:02.720]  your kook friends in your basement what you would do is you would actually say
[3:29:02.720 --> 3:29:08.400]  with some credibility this is true and these are the ways that we thought that's
[3:29:08.400 --> 3:29:11.520]  enough I mean you didn't even say what I'm lying about it's just that I'm in a
[3:29:11.520 --> 3:29:15.960]  there are no basements in Texas bud let's go to the next clip let's go out to
[3:29:15.960 --> 3:29:21.440]  break with us on a really a guy that we don't talk about very often because he's
[3:29:21.440 --> 3:29:27.840]  so insignificant and we don't really care but he is he is also psycho yeah he's
[3:29:27.840 --> 3:29:33.440]  can we just say what it is I think he is psycho he can see a lot of things that
[3:29:33.440 --> 3:29:38.560]  other people like a conspiracy around like a couple of Nellie sitting on TV
[3:29:38.560 --> 3:29:42.040]  we're gonna kind of see that hey we're gonna go to break and we're gonna come

[3:33:11.400 --> 3:33:16.560]  waiting 245 kind of road at the shoulder and there at the hip and everybody knew
[3:33:16.560 --> 3:33:32.680]  you didn't give no lift to big John big John big John big bad John big John nobody
[3:33:32.680 --> 3:33:37.160]  seemed to know where John called home he just drifted into town and stayed all
[3:33:37.160 --> 3:33:42.760]  alone didn't say much kind of quiet and shy but if he spoke at all he just said
[3:33:42.760 --> 3:33:49.600]  hi to big John all right let's go back you know I wish Glenn Beck would talk
[3:33:49.600 --> 3:33:54.800]  about the purge of veterans outside of law having their guns taken I wish you
[3:33:54.800 --> 3:33:57.400]  talk about Bilderberg group imagine if he would have talked about Bilderberg
[3:33:57.400 --> 3:34:02.880]  group and they were meeting last year in Chantilly, Virginia but it doesn't
[3:34:02.880 --> 3:34:09.480]  exist over and over again he said people are nuts that cover it
[3:34:09.480 --> 3:34:17.720]  125 world leaders royalty meeting in secret with US government officials and
[3:34:17.720 --> 3:34:23.280]  it doesn't exist and the only conspiracy that exists is what he exposes
[3:34:23.280 --> 3:34:27.840]  that's the only one that exists is is that if he says it and it's all George
[3:34:27.840 --> 3:34:35.160]  Soros the Nazi collaborator which is a super bad guy and again I've seen Beck
[3:34:35.160 --> 3:34:37.600]  get a little bit better over the years now that he's independent I've tried to
[3:34:37.600 --> 3:34:42.360]  leave Malone I'm just tired there's a bunch of other clips having played where
[3:34:42.360 --> 3:34:51.320]  I'm a fascist I'm an evil I'm bad I'm a liar and I mean I just can't believe
[3:34:51.320 --> 3:34:55.880]  some nitty up there who starts stuff and does stuff to me behind the scenes and
[3:34:55.880 --> 3:35:00.240]  on air then acting like in these clips so I was watching some of this morning
[3:35:00.240 --> 3:35:07.560]  refreshing my memory like I'm starting something with him all right let's go
[3:35:07.560 --> 3:35:11.400]  ahead and go back to that club we were playing here's the incident club he has
[3:35:11.400 --> 3:35:16.520]  on a really a guy that we don't talk about very often because he's so
[3:35:16.520 --> 3:35:23.360]  insignificant and we don't really care but he is he is also psycho can we
[3:35:23.360 --> 3:35:28.480]  just say what it is I think he is psycho he can see a lot of things that other
[3:35:28.480 --> 3:35:35.160]  people like a conspiracy around every corner and in everyone's eyes and if
[3:35:35.160 --> 3:35:39.440]  you don't agree with him you don't just you don't just disagree you're in on it
[3:35:39.440 --> 3:35:45.320]  you're in on it always always him and his minions I am and crazy as many as I
[3:35:45.320 --> 3:35:50.200]  said to make voices runs info war is millions really smart people have come
[3:35:50.200 --> 3:35:55.160]  up to me and said you know I just saw this on something from info wars do you
[3:35:55.160 --> 3:35:59.320]  know anything about him like yes yeah stay away from it immediately somebody
[3:35:59.320 --> 3:36:07.200]  came up to me days ago and said we just bought like 1.5 billion rounds homeland
[3:36:07.200 --> 3:36:12.520]  security and I said I don't know might be well I got it from info wars and I'm
[3:36:12.520 --> 3:36:20.080]  okay okay well then I can tell you right now it's most likely not true he's not a
[3:36:20.080 --> 3:36:28.800]  conservative he's not a conservative I don't know what he is except a
[3:36:28.800 --> 3:36:34.880]  conspiracy theorist everything that anyone would ever say about me on the
[3:36:34.880 --> 3:36:40.160]  conspiracy theory it's alex jones and when they try to when they try to make
[3:36:40.160 --> 3:36:46.160]  me look like a conspiracy theorist they always use his arguments and assign them
[3:36:46.160 --> 3:36:54.120]  to me I'm not the femacamp guy I'm not the birther guy I'm not the world trade
[3:36:54.120 --> 3:37:00.920]  center guy that's not me that's him and they use his arguments and assign them
[3:37:00.920 --> 3:37:05.600]  to me which you've never I've never a spouse I don't believe in them in fact I
[3:37:05.600 --> 3:37:11.240]  wholly reject them yeah in fact you're the one who if I'm not mistaken debunked
[3:37:11.240 --> 3:37:20.560]  the femacamp so it's what's amazing to me is here is two really dishonest
[3:37:20.560 --> 3:37:27.400]  people mm-hmm that sounds like the ravings of a fascist that's what that
[3:37:27.400 --> 3:37:35.560]  sounds like and quite honestly I believe that's what that guy is I think that
[3:37:35.560 --> 3:37:39.760]  right now the question is do we all work for central bankers that's what I
[3:37:39.760 --> 3:37:44.480]  want to address to our guests tonight is this global governance at last is it
[3:37:44.480 --> 3:37:49.360]  one world the central bankers in charge Jim Jim Yorio you say we've got some
[3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:53.920]  downside here a correction in the markets fine but aren't we all just living
[3:37:53.920 --> 3:37:58.040]  and dying for what the central banks do aren't we all just counting on the fact
[3:37:58.040 --> 3:38:03.160]  that there's a Bernanke pot put and that we won't go any lower than say five
[3:38:03.160 --> 3:38:06.800]  percent down from here of course we are because if we look at the economic data
[3:38:06.800 --> 3:38:10.680]  there's nothing to get excited about in that so we you know yesterday we saw
[3:38:10.680 --> 3:38:17.000]  some reluctance for the Bernanke Fed so I'm the guy that's been saying for 15
[3:38:17.000 --> 3:38:21.280]  years you're gonna take your bank accounts and your pension funds so again
[3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:26.720]  Glenn Beck says I'm making up global government I'm dishonest he said that
[3:38:26.720 --> 3:38:30.400]  you know I'm working with Pierce Morgan to be dishonest yeah that was a real
[3:38:30.400 --> 3:38:34.120]  black eye for gun owners no the only hope we've got is getting up on our
[3:38:34.120 --> 3:38:38.800]  hind legs and saying you crooks want our guns back off not over gonna
[3:38:38.800 --> 3:38:42.680]  compromise okay take some of our guns and register the rest when it's the exact
[3:38:42.680 --> 3:38:50.480]  blueprint but again it just made me mad because I don't ever watch going back I
[3:38:50.480 --> 3:38:55.480]  mean I literally might seem like once a month I try to stay away from it because
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:38:58.640]  I try to be a nice guy and not go after people I got bigger fish to fry and I'm
[3:38:58.640 --> 3:39:02.640]  like people want me to cover this alien thing okay I've seen that secret service
[3:39:02.640 --> 3:39:06.760]  guy where have I seen that face a few months ago he was the guy that came out
[3:39:06.760 --> 3:39:11.800]  for the second amendment okay this alien things like a year old from 2012 middle
[3:39:11.800 --> 3:39:16.800]  2012 so I but but but I just seen it you know last night so I went and found it
[3:39:16.800 --> 3:39:20.960]  and then I see a Glenn Beck clip and I go let me see what he says about it and I
[3:39:20.960 --> 3:39:24.600]  click on it he's like the people that believe in Bilderberg group and the
[3:39:24.600 --> 3:39:28.880]  Illuminati believe that aliens are everywhere and you know Bilderberg group
[3:39:28.880 --> 3:39:35.680]  doesn't exist that's what he's saying and that is an ADL southern poverty loss
[3:39:35.680 --> 3:39:41.720]  center tactic is to say oh Alex Jones thinks the borders are open he also
[3:39:41.720 --> 3:39:46.240]  believes in blood drinking lizards I don't believe in that I mean there's
[3:39:46.240 --> 3:39:49.920]  Forbes 1.6 billion rounds of ammo for Homeland Security it's time for a
[3:39:49.920 --> 3:39:53.640]  national conversation well not of Glenn Beck has this way because you're not
[3:39:53.640 --> 3:39:56.440]  supposed to have a conversation about that you're not supposed to discuss that
[3:39:56.440 --> 3:40:03.080]  you're supposed to just shut up listen I know what I'm talking about okay Glenn
[3:40:03.080 --> 3:40:08.440]  when you were making jokes about other talk show host wives that had miscarriages
[3:40:08.440 --> 3:40:16.240]  on zoo radio making fart noises trying to be Howard Stern I was confronting
[3:40:16.240 --> 3:40:20.080]  federal judges for keeping the branch Davidians in prison when they've been
[3:40:20.080 --> 3:40:23.560]  found not guilty of murder how was he keeping him in jail then for committing
[3:40:23.560 --> 3:40:31.320]  murder with firearms the weapons charge I went and bullhorn the judge and I was
[3:40:31.320 --> 3:40:35.480]  told we're gonna kill you if you don't shut up and I told the people go to hell
[3:40:35.480 --> 3:40:39.080]  and then they called me at the studio one night and said we're waiting outside I
[3:40:39.080 --> 3:40:42.560]  said oh I bet you are and I walked outside and they had four boxers out
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:47.000]  there to try to beat me into the ground like something out of Cape Fear and it
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:52.120]  ended like Cape Fear 2 except I'm not a serial killer like Robert like what's
[3:40:52.120 --> 3:40:57.480]  his name who's the actor that plays in the new Cape Fear Robert De Niro you know
[3:40:57.480 --> 3:41:03.080]  the whole point is is that I live in the real world buddy I was never a zoom
[3:41:03.080 --> 3:41:11.720]  warning guy I never spun records okay I got into this one I was 20 years old 20
[3:41:11.720 --> 3:41:16.800]  years ago and it took me two years to get on the air and I did everything I
[3:41:16.800 --> 3:41:20.320]  could to get on the air not because I wanted to be a big shot and have 200
[3:41:20.320 --> 3:41:26.960]  million dollars and all the rest of it I did it because I believe in the second
[3:41:26.960 --> 3:41:30.880]  amendment because it flows in my veins because my family's been revolutionary
[3:41:30.880 --> 3:41:37.280]  from the start okay that's who I am who are you I'm not the reason you come from
[3:41:37.280 --> 3:41:42.440]  a broken home I'm not the reason you know mommy or daddy or whatever it was
[3:41:42.440 --> 3:41:48.680]  committed suicide I'm not the reason okay you understand that I don't come
[3:41:48.680 --> 3:41:51.880]  from where you come and I'm sorry you went through that pain but you're not
[3:41:51.880 --> 3:41:57.640]  gonna place it on me yeah so your miscarriage jokes so they don't mean
[3:41:57.640 --> 3:42:04.040]  anything to me you understand that and and and you and the you know the guys
[3:42:04.040 --> 3:42:09.160]  that came from zoo radio with you or whatever our jokes and I see it for what
[3:42:09.160 --> 3:42:14.880]  you are my goal is to go 110% not back off and not compromise your goal is to
[3:42:14.880 --> 3:42:19.640]  run around and act like our grand leader and our religious cult leader alright
[3:42:19.640 --> 3:42:23.600]  that's what you really want to be and charge people I looked up what once he
[3:42:23.600 --> 3:42:27.600]  was charging $500 for a ticket and you know what he got people
[3:42:27.600 --> 3:42:32.640]  to actually buy him so that he could buy private jets and stuff and look I'm not
[3:42:32.640 --> 3:42:35.400]  against people having private jets if he wrote a best-selling book or had a
[3:42:35.400 --> 3:42:40.920]  bunch of money or you know found an oil well or whatever but the issue is I
[3:42:40.920 --> 3:42:45.800]  could go and maybe I should some people pay attention to I could go and book a
[3:42:45.800 --> 3:42:50.760]  hotel and charge people $500 a piece a thousand dollars a piece to have a
[3:42:50.760 --> 3:42:54.840]  meet and greet with me and to sit in the in the front three rows and charge
[3:42:54.840 --> 3:42:58.320]  everybody else a hundred bucks and they pay for it to really be in a nice
[3:42:58.320 --> 3:43:01.680]  hotel and do a couple day conversation about 50 to 100 bucks quite frankly they
[3:43:01.680 --> 3:43:06.160]  cost so much this guy would do 500 bucks a ticket at or 400 bucks a ticket at six
[3:43:06.160 --> 3:43:11.280]  flags where there's no overhead and he rents it for almost nothing and then to
[3:43:11.280 --> 3:43:16.560]  have these people that don't have the money come pay $500 to him so that he
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:21.680]  can fly around in private jets I mean that's just obscene to me but you know
[3:43:21.680 --> 3:43:25.040]  maybe I don't think big enough you know what I mean I stood up here and I think
[3:43:25.040 --> 3:43:28.200]  small I just want to get the word out I count on you to fight these people I'm
[3:43:28.200 --> 3:43:32.120]  sitting there doing this and maybe I do need to charge $500 to come see me and
[3:43:32.120 --> 3:43:36.320]  buy a jet and fly around and you know and I'll play ball with the new world
[3:43:36.320 --> 3:43:40.520]  order and all you know say only George Soros is bad there's nobody else to
[3:43:40.520 --> 3:43:45.680]  worry about and all this crap I don't even know why I'm going off on a
[3:43:45.680 --> 3:43:50.480]  Glenn Beck rant today I just always do whatever comes up in me in the spirit
[3:43:50.480 --> 3:43:53.160]  the gut whatever you want to call it so that's what it is it's just that and
[3:43:53.160 --> 3:43:56.480]  people like oh you envy the fact he charge you by the way he can't do that
[3:43:56.480 --> 3:44:02.840]  now I've gone and look before you know the tickets are now a hundred bucks how
[3:44:02.840 --> 3:44:08.880]  much are they are 350 oh they're not 500 anymore and this is a guy that takes
[3:44:08.880 --> 3:44:13.080]  acting lessons you see him on YouTube prancing around like a fairy I mean it's
[3:44:13.080 --> 3:44:16.160]  just there's no end to it and look that's fine I'm nothing against fairies
[3:44:16.160 --> 3:44:26.840]  just don't sit here and try to piss on me that's where I come from here I mean
[3:44:26.840 --> 3:44:29.080]  you know I mean you're sitting there and they're like I'm sorry you can't come on
[3:44:29.080 --> 3:44:32.800]  the Fox shows Glenn Beck is climbing the walls over there saying people will you
[3:44:32.800 --> 3:44:36.040]  know pay for it and then the feel the fourth or fifth time you're told that
[3:44:36.040 --> 3:44:40.440]  by other people you know oh my god Glenn Beck told me I I shouldn't go on
[3:44:40.440 --> 3:44:44.040]  your show you know when you're talking to so I mean it's just like on and on and
[3:44:44.040 --> 3:44:50.080]  on and on and on notice he never attacks me on that and calls me a liar because
[3:44:50.080 --> 3:44:56.840]  you know I'll name names the point is is that why does he have a problem with
[3:44:56.840 --> 3:45:03.520]  me because folks I sent him registered mail but had my listeners do it so they
[3:45:03.520 --> 3:45:06.960]  be needed deep in it the civilian and mate labor camp program documents and
[3:45:06.960 --> 3:45:12.040]  all the admitted programs and the and the congressional past laws and the Rex
[3:45:12.040 --> 3:45:19.120]  84 and the Miami Herald clippings I sent Glenn Beck everything for a month he was
[3:45:19.120 --> 3:45:23.920]  saying I'm gonna expose the FEMA camps and it looks like they're real and it's
[3:45:23.920 --> 3:45:28.480]  and people on his TV show would go oh really it was all a big joke and I went
[3:45:28.480 --> 3:45:31.480]  I don't know how I know this stuff I didn't want to say it because I want to
[3:45:31.480 --> 3:45:35.320]  influence what he did until the morning of it and I said he will bring on the
[3:45:35.320 --> 3:45:41.920]  popular mechanics debunkers and he will show a defunct train station in
[3:45:41.920 --> 3:45:46.400]  Illinois that I exposed in the late 90s as a fake FEMA camp I don't know how I
[3:45:46.400 --> 3:45:51.760]  know this stuff I just know how people operate and then that's what he did he
[3:45:51.760 --> 3:45:56.560]  like oh my god Glenn Beck can do the right thing I'm like yeah right and
[3:45:56.560 --> 3:46:02.680]  that's why I don't like him ladies and gentlemen because I sent him heartfelt
[3:46:02.680 --> 3:46:05.600]  stuff when I knew he was listening to the show every day and had a bunch of his
[3:46:05.600 --> 3:46:09.400]  team listening that guy's got a huge staff like a hundred people last time I
[3:46:09.400 --> 3:46:16.240]  heard and they're watching right now and I said I said I'd like to support you I
[3:46:16.240 --> 3:46:20.200]  hope you're a good person here's a big file and I've also had people send you
[3:46:20.200 --> 3:46:25.200]  this stuff so I know your knee deep in this please don't do a straw man I
[3:46:25.200 --> 3:46:30.600]  already knew what he was gonna do I just hoped he had some humanity and then I
[3:46:30.600 --> 3:46:34.360]  shot videos saying do the right thing be on the right side of history and
[3:46:34.360 --> 3:46:40.320]  reportedly I talked to two insiders that said he got really upset I said why is
[3:46:40.320 --> 3:46:43.520]  he climbing the walls over there and they said Glenn Beck be on the right
[3:46:43.520 --> 3:46:53.520]  side of history a message to Glenn Beck I mean it was a nice message and you
[3:46:53.520 --> 3:46:57.720]  know he just didn't want any part of it well here's here's a little newsflash
[3:46:57.720 --> 3:47:02.800]  Glenn boy they could kill me today they could set me up tomorrow or I could live
[3:47:02.800 --> 3:47:06.960]  100 more years the point is I am real and you'll never take that away you'll
[3:47:06.960 --> 3:47:12.080]  never take it away and you know it and that's what you hate okay there's
[3:47:12.080 --> 3:47:18.320]  nothing wrong with doing zoo radio but you've got a creepy factor where you get
[3:47:18.320 --> 3:47:22.960]  on what was it 60 minutes or something and say I became a Mormon to have sex
[3:47:22.960 --> 3:47:28.000]  with my wife I wanted to get her in bed he and he knows demographically he's
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:31.520]  going for kind of weak metrosexual conservatives that I just want to kind
[3:47:31.520 --> 3:47:35.320]  of shuffle around and laugh at everything kind of the you know in their
[3:47:35.320 --> 3:47:38.280]  marketing because I actually know he's not really like that I kind of just joke
[3:47:38.280 --> 3:47:42.680]  at the Nellie persona that's all an act when Becks like a demon from what I've
[3:47:42.680 --> 3:47:48.160]  heard a raging demon he does that because he thinks that's who you aren't
[3:47:48.160 --> 3:47:53.200]  well little white loafers and little little sweater and hi I've got a plaid
[3:47:53.200 --> 3:48:02.680]  tie on yeah you know yeah yeah I mean it's all actuaried out with all the top
[3:48:02.680 --> 3:48:08.440]  guys formerly with clear channel and the whole thing all the top people all of
[3:48:08.440 --> 3:48:14.680]  them all over there at his operation the former top Fox people the former top
[3:48:14.680 --> 3:48:19.600]  CNN people all riding the gravy train sucking hundreds of millions a year out
[3:48:19.600 --> 3:48:27.280]  of the Liberty Patriot movement and making sure it goes nowhere and they
[3:48:27.280 --> 3:48:31.440]  said well we're gonna target a feminine metrosexual conservatives and we're
[3:48:31.440 --> 3:48:36.560]  gonna and that's the whole act is for men that are comfortable with little
[3:48:36.560 --> 3:48:43.880]  soft tempering I mean they're targeting men that didn't have fathers or absent
[3:48:43.880 --> 3:48:46.680]  fathers that's what they're going and that's that's what America is now
[3:48:46.680 --> 3:48:51.560]  everybody goes look at this crazy guy he's yelling and screaming what type of
