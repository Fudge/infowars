[00:00.000 --> 00:13.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.520 --> 00:32.600]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.600 --> 00:38.920]  syndicated radio host three-time Emmy award-winning newsman and filmmaker
[00:38.920 --> 00:43.720]  George Norrie better known for his giant radio show arguably the second most
[00:43.720 --> 00:48.720]  listened to in the United States coast-to-coast AM he'll be joining us
[00:48.720 --> 00:54.440]  coming up in the third hour to talk of Bola election 2014 as Matt Drudge said
[00:54.440 --> 00:59.720]  two years ago in a tweet 2014 is everything I agree with that we're
[00:59.720 --> 01:05.400]  gonna be breaking it all down in detail today but getting into all these new
[01:05.400 --> 01:12.000]  studies mainline studies coming out about humans pigs honey bees you name it
[01:12.000 --> 01:18.280]  what GMO corn particularly BT corn is doing I've been harping on this since
[01:18.280 --> 01:24.360]  Monday when a new study came out in a prestigious journal showing a 65% increase
[01:24.360 --> 01:29.160]  in children just in 10 years with irritable bowel which just means bleeding
[01:29.160 --> 01:33.840]  destroyed intestines and guess what they linked it to in a double-blind study
[01:33.840 --> 01:41.400]  BT corn it kills bugs that eat it but it's supposedly okay for us
[01:41.400 --> 01:47.720]  Bill Gates we love you you know he's involved in it thank you for all you do
[01:47.720 --> 01:53.400]  and financing the private research before it became White House science are
[01:53.400 --> 02:06.160]  of John P. Holdren and people like that you are so nice for all the little
[02:06.160 --> 02:09.960]  little gifts you give us and you think that we're too stupid and you're too
[02:09.960 --> 02:13.920]  smart that we'll never we'll never figure it out well guess what we have
[02:13.920 --> 02:18.120]  figured it out and the numbers show the population is figuring it out and what
[02:18.120 --> 02:22.800]  do you think's gonna happen to you guys once we reach critical mass and all
[02:22.800 --> 02:28.520]  these foreign microbiologists and geneticists are now looking deeply into
[02:28.520 --> 02:34.880]  what you've been trojan horsing into all this so-called food that you want to
[02:34.880 --> 02:39.840]  give the Africans and give American school children and give the Asians and
[02:39.840 --> 02:43.920]  give the Europeans and give the Russians and give the Latin Americans
[02:43.920 --> 02:51.480]  Latin Americans for 20 years have said no hell no Asia's been saying no Africa's
[02:51.480 --> 02:55.640]  been saying no even when they're starving the only place that says yes is
[02:55.640 --> 02:59.280]  the United States Europe tried some of it their pigs and sheep died when they
[02:59.280 --> 03:03.520]  ate it they said you know I'm not a microbiologist or anything or a
[03:03.520 --> 03:12.520]  geneticist but that might not be a good idea for my oinkers and the same thing
[03:12.520 --> 03:16.520]  happened in Latin America Brazil tried some of it in the last 15 years and had
[03:16.520 --> 03:20.080]  devastating effects they said you know some things in that the Russians went
[03:20.080 --> 03:23.640]  actually looked at the GMO we ship over there and they said in the Russian news
[03:23.640 --> 03:29.480]  it's a bio weapon did you know our meat is banned in Russia because it's so full
[03:29.480 --> 03:38.000]  of toxins and poisons and GMO it's not that the Russians are angels or anything
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.480]  but they know weapons when they see them they understand they can look at our
[03:42.480 --> 03:46.720]  cancer numbers they understand they could see our neurological disorders off
[03:46.720 --> 03:51.520]  the chart they understand and all over the world the only place Mickey D's
[03:51.520 --> 03:56.480]  was had a growing market was in Japan Russia China but the words gotten out
[03:56.480 --> 03:59.920]  there so the bottoms dropped out on McDonald's and every other Western
[03:59.920 --> 04:06.400]  so-called fast food weaponized food is in freefall right now and that's another
[04:06.400 --> 04:12.040]  great indicator because it's going to happen on every front now I'm gonna
[04:12.040 --> 04:18.280]  reset go to break and come back and hold on to your hat because I'm going over

[08:53.880 --> 09:00.280]  and quite frankly horrifyingly sensational how many instances of
[09:00.280 --> 09:05.160]  democratic party corruption and fraud that we have we're going to be going over
[09:05.160 --> 09:12.760]  we also the latest on Ebola meanwhile lows is testing robots as customer
[09:12.760 --> 09:19.480]  helpers replacing more humans the times dispatch reports that ties into the time
[09:19.480 --> 09:25.240]  magazine article last week let's end human driving within 10 years you have
[09:25.240 --> 09:31.920]  to understand I ended the broadcast yesterday with an NBC news story saying
[09:31.920 --> 09:36.880]  guess what your cars got one of these and the good news is it'll tax you by the
[09:36.880 --> 09:42.120]  mile and save you money good news if you chop your hand off with a hatchet your
[09:42.120 --> 09:48.920]  hand will work better good news two plus two equals five no it doesn't the
[09:48.920 --> 09:55.880]  government premeditatedly globally the globalist corporate governance through
[09:55.880 --> 10:00.880]  regulatory agencies that governments then rubber stamp has had everybody from
[10:00.880 --> 10:09.880]  Ford to Toyota from Chevy to Nissan Mercedes Saab Ferrari Lamborghini you
[10:09.880 --> 10:14.280]  name it they all have a box in them that you pay for as part of the sticker
[10:14.280 --> 10:18.960]  price that tracks you by the mile that is wireless that has a whole record of
[10:18.960 --> 10:22.480]  where you've gone and what you've done and that will then transmit whenever it
[10:22.480 --> 10:27.680]  gets near a transmitter how far you've driven from the last reader and will
[10:27.680 --> 10:33.880]  charge and debit you and they're gonna keep the gas tax boys and girls state
[10:33.880 --> 10:39.800]  and federal but they push it like oh it's a wonder just in this machine just
[10:39.800 --> 10:46.800]  happened to fall into your vehicle this is what's so frustrating we knew in
[10:46.800 --> 10:50.880]  96 about the $10 million that was publicly spent to put NSA snub pubs
[10:50.880 --> 10:54.880]  into everything lifetime they were already listening to most of it but this
[10:54.880 --> 10:59.520]  was public it was funded it was illegal engineers I knew that worked at telecoms
[10:59.520 --> 11:03.600]  freaked out gave me the intel and their response was to say you're a crazy
[11:03.600 --> 11:09.760]  conspiracy theorist no it was not my opinion it was 100% documented fact and
[11:09.760 --> 11:12.840]  for the next 18 years I laid out what was really going on and now it's all
[11:12.840 --> 11:18.240]  admitted exactly as I said because I interviewed all the NSA whistleblowers
[11:18.240 --> 11:23.840]  on and off air James Bamford and countless others Wayne Madsen the list
[11:23.840 --> 11:30.480]  goes on and on we've had the former director of NSA operations on what five
[11:30.480 --> 11:35.320]  times now on this show and and in the nightly news saying exactly what I'm
[11:35.320 --> 11:42.240]  saying there's no debating it's going on premeditatively worldwide tracker boxes
[11:42.240 --> 11:47.520]  in all the cars to track you to tax you and to control everything you do and
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.200]  then gather data claiming you're dangerous so you can have your insurance
[11:51.200 --> 11:56.400]  taken away and then forced to accept a computer box that you'll pay for that is
[11:56.400 --> 12:00.840]  a robot that will now drive you they they've admitted all this I read stuff
[12:00.840 --> 12:06.800]  out of MIT ten years ago admitting all this everything I was already told by
[12:06.800 --> 12:11.160]  engineers this is a plan there won't be humans going to space there won't be
[12:11.160 --> 12:15.400]  humans undersea there won't be humans in combat will be all drones there won't
[12:15.400 --> 12:19.440]  be humans at the grocery store there won't be humans picking the strawberries
[12:19.440 --> 12:23.480]  there won't be humans doing jack squat jacquard Jackson last year when
[12:23.480 --> 12:28.680]  Obamacare came in it's a powerful report we should go back into another one so
[12:28.680 --> 12:32.400]  he did it with a hidden camera and he goes in and tries to get Obamacare
[12:32.400 --> 12:36.800]  from the robot and it tells him he's obese when he looks like he has two
[12:36.800 --> 12:39.640]  percent body fat
[12:40.680 --> 12:45.960]  looks like a Calvin Klein model okay and it told him he was obese and had
[12:45.960 --> 12:56.360]  diabetes talk about misdiagnosis directly out of the movie Elysium where
[12:56.360 --> 13:00.920]  Matt Damon goes up to the robot and it tells him he gets two more years of
[13:00.920 --> 13:05.240]  probation and he and his heart rate gets elevated and he says you're getting
[13:05.240 --> 13:09.920]  you know angry would you like a pill you're not gonna have to wait 50 60
[13:09.920 --> 13:17.640]  hundred years for that it's coming now near future you're already living it I've
[13:17.640 --> 13:23.480]  got all this news to cover but I see a story of the times dispatch Lowe's test
[13:23.480 --> 13:30.720]  robots as customer helpers do not use these robots do not go in line do not
[13:30.720 --> 13:40.320]  use them it's not that I'm against technology I'm not against gold rings
[13:40.320 --> 13:48.120]  but if I lived in the fictitious fantasy world of Lord of the Rings of J. R. R.
[13:48.120 --> 13:55.040]  Tolkien I would not want that ring see because the ring has a Trojan horse
[13:55.040 --> 14:01.520]  built into it it's actually the spirit and the consciousness of Surin now let's
[14:01.520 --> 14:06.000]  use that analogy and understand the drones are now already and I knew this
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.880]  ten years ago I was told by high-level engineers that Alex they're already
[14:08.880 --> 14:12.920]  autonomous we've got ground robots undersea robots hundred killer robots
[14:12.920 --> 14:16.360]  we've got cruise missiles that open up and release hundreds of little killer
[14:16.360 --> 14:22.080]  robots I was told by Marine Corps Colonel about all this actually
[14:23.440 --> 14:29.560]  15 years ago and then now DARPA comes out last year and shows the exact cruise
[14:29.560 --> 14:35.000]  missile I was told about opening up and releasing the killbots they actually
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.480]  have that
[14:40.560 --> 14:45.840]  and I go tell the public about it and they look at me and they go I still get
[14:45.840 --> 14:50.240]  emails saying there's no such thing as spider goats to create body armor and
[14:50.240 --> 14:54.680]  there's no such thing as glowing dogs and cats you can buy for 15 16 17 years in
[14:54.680 --> 14:59.720]  Hong Kong or South Korea or China you can buy them here in the US part jellyfish
[14:59.720 --> 15:04.560]  dogs that glow blue in the dark listen I'm not the one that did all this I'm
[15:04.560 --> 15:08.640]  not making any of it up there's a public plan to set up world government put in a
[15:08.640 --> 15:14.760]  robot grid and then release bio weapons to kill everybody and Obama thinks
[15:14.760 --> 15:24.160]  you're so dumb he gets up there and says that this is a dry run a test run for a
[15:24.160 --> 15:27.560]  more deadlier airborne in the future
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.960]  we've done a bunch of reports on it and Watson wrote a story about it last year
[15:34.960 --> 15:39.040]  it's the we've got video of it it shows it's released by DARPA in the Pentagon
[15:39.040 --> 15:43.360]  shows the cruise missile flyover it releases little robots that have the
[15:43.360 --> 15:49.240]  rifle scope on them and they just kill you they're about six inches long when
[15:49.240 --> 15:53.800]  Homeland Security last year released its drone footage for internal usage it
[15:53.800 --> 15:57.840]  showed it tracking gun owners selling each other good old boys selling each
[15:57.840 --> 16:04.200]  other rifles in a field this is what the whole architecture of the next big war
[16:04.200 --> 16:08.920]  is against individuals against families against the Amish against
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.520]  self-sufficiency against the farmers markets against the lemonade stands against
[16:13.520 --> 16:23.560]  gun ownership against being human it is a complete and total takeover and that's
[16:23.560 --> 16:31.680]  the announcement that I'm trying to get at here for everybody
[16:31.680 --> 16:39.960]  and I want to just say the team gets frustrated they do an incredible job as
[16:39.960 --> 16:43.240]  I just mentioned things here on air and within a minute or two they'll actually
[16:43.240 --> 16:47.000]  find them and put them on screen for TV viewers because I know if you're a
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.840]  radio listener a lot of this sounds fantastical you have to understand that
[16:49.840 --> 16:54.040]  if you're watching at prisonplanet.tv or on the free feed at infowars.com
[16:54.040 --> 16:59.040]  forward slash show that for people that aren't awake and think we're making this
[16:59.040 --> 17:03.600]  up this is so essential so that you understand we're not making this up
[17:03.600 --> 17:07.920]  they can real-time type in what I'm saying and pull up mainstream news
[17:07.920 --> 17:14.480]  government documents to back up everything we're claiming here the
[17:14.480 --> 17:18.840]  White House Ebola czar says the number one problem is too many black people in
[17:18.840 --> 17:24.480]  Africa he played the video last week he's a eugenicist that works with Al Gore on
[17:24.480 --> 17:30.760]  population reduction do I think this Ebola is the big one probably not but we
[17:30.760 --> 17:40.440]  won't find out until the election is over but unless this is a fake Ebola
[17:40.440 --> 17:45.840]  simulant a real bio weapon but not really Ebola like Steve quail and CIA
[17:45.840 --> 17:52.240]  people are saying then undoubtedly it is spreading in the US I don't know how
[17:52.240 --> 17:56.560]  virally I don't know how airborne it is but it is airborne in cold temperatures
[17:56.560 --> 18:01.120]  that's the Army's own manuals and look they can have the New York Times or CBS
[18:01.120 --> 18:06.000]  news attack me for saying that but it's the truth it's the Army's own public
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.160]  documents the CDC and the World Health Organization and when we show those
[18:10.160 --> 18:15.480]  articles we have links to it and that's why you're losing credibility in the
[18:15.480 --> 18:20.200]  system is because people know you deceive they know we at least try to tell
[18:20.200 --> 18:26.440]  the truth and are accurate 95 plus percent of the time we come back huge
[18:26.440 --> 18:30.640]  Ebola news and then after I've gone through the Ebola news huge election news
[18:30.640 --> 18:36.560]  there is a lot of it we have a clip of Obama saying on early voting you can
[18:36.560 --> 18:42.520]  only vote once this isn't Chicago that is a clear implication to introduce the
[18:42.520 --> 18:46.040]  idea to go vote repeatedly and how many Democrats do we have on record saying go
[18:46.040 --> 18:50.960]  vote in Texas that's being sued by the Attorney General the outgoing master
[18:50.960 --> 18:54.080]  criminal in my view all things he's been involved in fast and furious you name

[24:21.200 --> 24:26.840]  as the army quarantined troops coming out of Africa in Italy on a base state
[24:26.840 --> 24:30.280]  department is confirmed does plan to bring foreign Ebola patients into the
[24:30.280 --> 24:34.640]  US it'd be downright racist not to do it African countries have sealed their
[24:34.640 --> 24:38.400]  borders for months most other nations like Australia are now issuing a
[24:38.400 --> 24:41.600]  different types of restrictions including blocking all visas from West
[24:41.600 --> 24:51.200]  Africa Jeb said that Obama has been incompetent on Ebola here's the deal no
[24:51.200 --> 24:56.960]  more bushes no more Clintons time for some new blood you guys that work
[24:56.960 --> 24:59.800]  together behind the scenes the Clintons in the bushes have got this big
[24:59.800 --> 25:03.240]  foundation together I'm gonna get into that in election coverage but I'm
[25:03.240 --> 25:06.400]  really getting tired of it but coming up an election coverage we're gonna focus
[25:06.400 --> 25:10.680]  on this first I'm about to go to Ebola Obama says on early voting you could
[25:10.680 --> 25:15.680]  only vote once this isn't Chicago and because early voting runs through this
[25:15.680 --> 25:22.200]  Friday you don't have to wait till election day you can vote all week I
[25:22.200 --> 25:29.600]  mean you can only vote once it's in Chicago now
[25:29.600 --> 25:44.640]  that's like when Gary Webb got told by the CIA just out of the blue no one's
[25:44.640 --> 25:51.920]  gonna hurt your children so same thing that you can vote all week long I mean
[25:51.920 --> 25:58.440]  I don't mean like over and over again this in Chicago and people started
[25:58.440 --> 26:03.200]  walking out when he did that not the cult members all on the dole basically or
[26:03.200 --> 26:10.000]  who have government jobs behind him or consultants behind him part of the
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.000]  campaign schmiling and the few idiots up front chanting at that very rally
[26:15.000 --> 26:19.160]  people began to leave in mass as he spoke they didn't want to hear go vote
[26:19.160 --> 26:26.120]  twice most of them aren't criminals like the Democratic Party leadership you
[26:26.120 --> 26:29.360]  know what I'm gonna get into election right now I'll get into Ebola in the
[26:29.360 --> 26:37.200]  next segment but speaking of Ebola here is another quote from Ebola and you know
[26:37.200 --> 26:41.680]  what that is a Freudian slip I'm not trying to call Ebola Ebola I'm just
[26:41.680 --> 26:49.880]  doing it on my own Ebola Ebola it's happening so let's go to this clip of
[26:49.880 --> 27:01.280]  Obama on Ebola here it is we don't just react based on our fears oh we react
[27:01.280 --> 27:09.040]  based on facts and judgment and making smart decisions that's how we have built
[27:09.040 --> 27:14.240]  this country and sustained this country and protected this country that's why
[27:14.240 --> 27:18.080]  America has defined progress because we're not afraid because it was about
[27:18.080 --> 27:21.560]  businesses and small businesses individuals thanks to our military our
[27:21.560 --> 27:25.400]  dedicated medical and health care professionals the men and women who I
[27:25.400 --> 27:29.920]  spoke to today in West Africa that leadership and progress continues that's
[27:29.920 --> 27:34.160]  enough well if this is progress I don't want any more of it you didn't build
[27:34.160 --> 27:40.560]  your business Hillary says it's a big lie that businesses give people jobs
[27:41.760 --> 27:46.000]  Hillary Clinton had trouble even saying and herself reading off her notes
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.600]  because it's so patently ridiculous next you'll get up there and say humans do
[27:50.600 --> 27:58.560]  not need oxygen to live plants are not green fish do not live in the ocean have
[27:58.560 --> 28:04.720]  gills and extract oxygen out of the water plants do not live off carbon dioxide
[28:04.720 --> 28:13.760]  the Easter Bunny is real Santa Claus is real unicorns are real this is getting
[28:13.760 --> 28:20.560]  over the top insane it's more than just psyops these people are completely out
[28:20.560 --> 28:24.720]  of their minds at this point believing their own statement that they control
[28:24.720 --> 28:30.760]  reality as Carl Rove said no Carl Rove and the neocon rhinos don't control
[28:30.760 --> 28:36.760]  reality and the criminal sickening out of control bizarre self-destructive
[28:36.760 --> 28:41.760]  mafioso Democratic Party that just wrecks everything they come in contact with
[28:41.760 --> 28:50.400]  you don't control reality and reality is this reality is you're losing the info
[28:50.400 --> 28:55.720]  war because you use lies we use truth you use fraud we use common sense we're
[28:55.720 --> 29:00.440]  sincere I want to have a future I want people to do good poor people shouldn't
[29:00.440 --> 29:06.480]  even be paying taxes no culture taxes poor people unless it wants to collapse
[29:06.480 --> 29:12.960]  middle class should have low taxes on it corporations that get government
[29:12.960 --> 29:17.600]  bailouts should have high taxes on them instead their tax exempt they run the
[29:17.600 --> 29:23.800]  rules and if I see one more slack-jawed bug-eyed video a Warren Buffett calling
[29:23.800 --> 29:32.000]  to raise taxes I'm gonna throw up oh he makes me angry oh we're gonna come back
[29:32.000 --> 29:35.760]  I'm gonna get into the election news there is so much of it I'm gonna try to

[34:22.920 --> 34:32.920]  bring non-citizen illegals to us for Ebola treatment no longer Ebola it's
[34:32.920 --> 34:41.200]  obola officially in my mind I now only say obola it's happened I'll be talking
[34:41.200 --> 34:44.080]  to people in the street and they're like hey Alex what do you think of the
[34:44.080 --> 34:49.480]  obola and I'll go you mean Ebola they went oh yeah it's now happened Obama is
[34:49.480 --> 34:55.440]  now officially branded with a killer disease couldn't be better because
[34:55.440 --> 35:01.360]  collectivism progressivism is a disease this is very very exciting let's go over
[35:01.360 --> 35:06.280]  the latest election news but let's play that clip one more time where he clearly
[35:06.280 --> 35:11.280]  says you can be voting all week long and everybody starts laughing and he goes
[35:11.280 --> 35:17.080]  now only once this isn't Chicago and everybody laughs he's basically telling
[35:17.080 --> 35:21.280]  him you get out there and you vote as many times as you can with dead people's
[35:21.280 --> 35:28.360]  IDs you name it illegals with your five or six IDs you get the job done and
[35:28.360 --> 35:33.360]  because early voting runs through this Friday you don't have to wait till
[35:33.360 --> 35:41.880]  election day you can vote all week I mean you can only vote once it's in
[35:41.880 --> 35:51.320]  Chicago now you get up I'm teasing Chicago I'm messing with you that was a
[35:51.320 --> 35:57.560]  long time ago oh yeah never goes on now but you can vote anytime this week
[35:57.560 --> 36:04.520]  remember you could walk into an Akron office office after office and say I
[36:04.520 --> 36:12.560]  want to bring child sex slaves in to run them on the streets for prostitution
[36:12.560 --> 36:15.560]  they're like absolutely got the forms everything and we'll tell you how to cover
[36:15.560 --> 36:18.360]  it up with the schools just make sure they're in school all they once they're
[36:18.360 --> 36:22.400]  cut you ready to run operations you bet
[36:22.400 --> 36:29.440]  it's a mafia and that's why they will not allow illegals particularly from
[36:29.440 --> 36:35.560]  Latin America who have felonies rape arson you name it to be picked up by
[36:35.560 --> 36:39.440]  ice and if a sheriff reports it and says they're here to be picked up in the
[36:39.440 --> 36:43.760]  database the Democrats double down Laraza and match ahead of them and had
[36:43.760 --> 36:50.040]  them hard in my view they are aiding and abetting organized crime and that's all
[36:50.040 --> 36:55.040]  it is more organized in the Klan more sophisticated more focused more vicious
[36:55.040 --> 36:59.960]  more powerful than the Klan could have ever imagined with a bunch of yuppie
[36:59.960 --> 37:04.600]  politically correct Hispanics blacks whites Asians in America having no
[37:04.600 --> 37:09.280]  idea the Democrats are right back to their old Klan days the Democratic
[37:09.280 --> 37:16.280]  Party Albert Pike Confederate head general founded the Ku Klux Klan on
[37:16.280 --> 37:23.240]  record and up until the early 60s they were losing elections because blacks
[37:23.240 --> 37:26.920]  were voting about 90% like to do Democrats today for Republicans not the
[37:26.920 --> 37:29.520]  Republicans were perfect but they were the ones of Lincoln and they were the
[37:29.520 --> 37:33.360]  ones that found the NRA to arm blacks as part of its mission and to fight the
[37:33.360 --> 37:37.960]  Klan and they passed a civil rights act and it was Eisenhower sent the troops
[37:37.960 --> 37:42.080]  into Little Rock to bring the black kids in and the Democrats looked at the
[37:42.080 --> 37:47.600]  demographic and said that's it we've been running Klan ops on poor whites we're
[37:47.600 --> 37:51.280]  gonna run Klan ops on blacks and Mexicans and they've done a great job
[37:51.280 --> 37:57.560]  it's been a 40-plus year program and they got it and blacks would line up at
[37:57.560 --> 38:02.480]  the funeral of Robert Byrd the Grand Dragon who'd called for all blacks to
[38:02.480 --> 38:06.440]  be sterilized back in the 50s you know it's kind of like if you're George
[38:06.440 --> 38:11.920]  Soros and you worked for the Nazis for four years and rounded up thousands of
[38:11.920 --> 38:16.720]  people you go on 60 minutes and say I'm not sorry for doing it and you get ADL
[38:16.720 --> 38:20.880]  awards but if your grandfather's both fought against the Nazis and you fought
[38:20.880 --> 38:24.240]  against the Klan and Nazis and I'm one of the most hated people by Nazis
[38:24.240 --> 38:27.680]  because they're much of Fedron groups online it's not Benjamin yet and Yahoo
[38:27.680 --> 38:31.440]  they hate it's Alex Jones I challenge you to go to any white supremacist site I
[38:31.440 --> 38:36.160]  am more hated than anybody I don't even support a lot of what Israel does and
[38:36.160 --> 38:41.080]  they call me the Jew because they're feds they're globalist and they hate my
[38:41.080 --> 38:43.680]  guts because I'm bringing people together and if we ever do that around the
[38:43.680 --> 38:47.920]  Bill of Rights and Constitution as a unifying system of blood now what color
[38:47.920 --> 38:51.800]  you are it's game over people learn how to be prosperous we'll be so rich and
[38:51.800 --> 38:57.200]  so successful our kids will be built in space bases and then that's it for them
[38:57.200 --> 39:04.280]  and their little game and I'm so sick of them and if we could only unseat people
[39:04.280 --> 39:08.120]  like Boehner and other pieces of trash that are working with the Democrats
[39:08.120 --> 39:12.160]  working with the globalist the exact same policies Republicans that helped
[39:12.160 --> 39:16.120]  right Obamacare Romney care
[39:18.320 --> 39:21.720]  Romney care was part of it and then Ezekiel Emanuel got it out of the
[39:21.720 --> 39:26.320]  death panels and what Romney wrote was bad for the insurance companies and did
[39:26.320 --> 39:29.920]  increase premiums and make everybody buy it and increase taxes a huge royal
[39:29.920 --> 39:34.520]  screw job in fairness to Romney because I've read most of his thing they passed
[39:34.520 --> 39:38.160]  some Massachusetts 20 years ago or whatever it was you didn't have death
[39:38.160 --> 39:42.800]  panels and a bunch of the stuff in it the new one does and that's another thing
[39:42.800 --> 39:50.000]  I was watching Fox News on the elliptical this morning it's a cold morning
[39:50.000 --> 39:56.280]  rundown or whatever is on it like seven and they had this Democrat talk show

[42:15.840 --> 42:19.800]  thing saying it's going up 20 30% most people that's how they're doing it is
[42:19.800 --> 42:25.400]  they just they don't put it up 500% at once they just do it over and over and
[42:25.400 --> 42:29.120]  over again and it doesn't matter they got a slack job liar they're the liberal
[42:29.120 --> 42:33.160]  they got the moral high ground they're the party of the Ku Klux Klan the party
[42:33.160 --> 42:37.400]  of communism the party of total tyranny the party of taking over the party of
[42:37.400 --> 42:41.640]  having unions vote for NAFTA and GATT the party of bringing in Ebola patients
[42:41.640 --> 42:46.560]  the party of funding Isis and al-Qaeda it doesn't matter there's slack job look
[42:46.560 --> 42:51.240]  at Rachel Maddow she's got an arrogant look in her eye and short hair anybody
[42:51.240 --> 42:56.080]  knows a woman with short hairs God folks you're not allowed to have an opinion
[42:56.080 --> 43:01.720]  she'll have it for you she wears the pants got it man shut up shut up and do
[43:01.720 --> 43:06.880]  what she says shut up and do what Hillary says businesses don't hire people

[43:13.640 --> 43:19.600]  she's God Jamie Fox said Obama's God Lord and Savior think I'm joking let's
[43:19.600 --> 43:27.280]  find that I haven't even gotten in the stack yet I'm already so upset this is
[43:27.280 --> 43:30.920]  why I don't like reading the news but I do it every morning every night I just I
[43:30.920 --> 43:34.240]  came into a meeting this morning about election coverage and started yelling and
[43:34.240 --> 43:40.960]  I wasn't yelling at the crew it's hard I know what people tune out of this stuff
[43:40.960 --> 43:43.720]  because but you know if we don't if we don't face it we're gonna lose
[43:43.720 --> 43:47.680]  everything it's the tuning out of it that has gotten us where we are but take a
[43:47.680 --> 43:53.520]  deep breath it's just such an insult to have all these control freak con men and
[43:53.520 --> 43:59.720]  con women and slimy scum involved in so many crimes and scams on record that
[43:59.720 --> 44:04.800]  they are just arched super criminals but then I'll read about the secret service
[44:04.800 --> 44:10.000]  and they want to arrest a bunch of them because they might have had hookers
[44:10.000 --> 44:15.160]  that's just a way to keep fear in the government over petty stuff while John
[44:15.160 --> 44:21.200]  Corzine stole billions of private bank accounts to invest it and then never
[44:21.200 --> 44:24.480]  gotten trouble because well he's a former governor and a former head of
[44:24.480 --> 44:28.320]  Goldman Sachs he's allowed to but the secret service might have got some
[44:28.320 --> 44:32.600]  hookers oh my gosh let's arrest all of them the this is this is how the whole
[44:32.600 --> 44:38.680]  system operates oh the IRS comes to your little restaurant you have no criminal
[44:38.680 --> 44:42.000]  record you had it 40 plus years you deposit less than a thousand dollars a
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.960]  day cash because that's what you deposit and they say well we're just gonna take
[44:45.960 --> 44:49.160]  all your money even though you can prove it's all yours and you've paid taxes
[44:49.160 --> 44:53.600]  because we say the regulation state that you should make ten thousand dollar or
[44:53.600 --> 44:57.800]  bigger deposits and then they sit there in the New York Times and go is this the
[44:57.800 --> 45:02.920]  right thing to do and then they they say at the end no maybe the IRS should ease
[45:02.920 --> 45:07.720]  off a little no how about we have due process again in this country this is
[45:07.720 --> 45:11.760]  over the top Freakville
[45:13.520 --> 45:19.120]  I'm just starting to get really angry let me just settle down for a minute
[45:20.400 --> 45:25.200]  okay good I'm alright now I mean people are tuning in on this this guy this is an
[45:25.200 --> 45:29.640]  act or whatever look I wish it was an act okay I get high blood pressure from
[45:29.640 --> 45:35.160]  this stuff I really take offense on tens of thousands of people with no criminal
[45:35.160 --> 45:40.360]  records being robbed no jury no judge no indictment no proof no discovery no
[45:40.360 --> 45:47.960]  nothing your money's gone that threatens everyone my grandfather had a heart
[45:47.960 --> 45:52.960]  attack and then off the heart surgery had a stroke after the city tried
[45:52.960 --> 45:58.320]  sending him $2,000 a day fines this is like 15 years ago took about five years
[45:58.320 --> 46:04.680]  to kill him and they said it's up to like $40,000 mr. Hammond you have to go
[46:04.680 --> 46:07.800]  clean out the creek behind your house and he went and looked at the map of his
[46:07.800 --> 46:12.800]  property and it was a city gutter not a creek and it was concrete and they said
[46:12.800 --> 46:16.720]  no you will clean out the obstruction back there or we're gonna continue the
[46:16.720 --> 46:23.640]  fines so I had to go fight that forum he and then the IRS comes and says you
[46:23.640 --> 46:26.640]  always saw this money even though he'd been paying the taxes forever so he had
[46:26.640 --> 46:33.240]  a heart attack and some people I know you'll have that heart attack and I'm
[46:33.240 --> 46:37.080]  sick of living like a slave they wrote the tax code where nobody can follow it
[46:37.080 --> 46:40.400]  so they can grab whoever they want don't you know that they bring the drugs in
[46:40.400 --> 46:43.480]  hoping your kids use them so they can throw them into the prison system I'm
[46:43.480 --> 46:47.520]  done with all of it and I'm angry about it because that's normal when you hear
[46:47.520 --> 46:52.360]  about a criminal group arresting preachers and saying you you you can't
[46:52.360 --> 46:56.280]  demonstrate and sitting the IRS people a lot of folks cower and fear and think
[46:56.280 --> 47:02.200]  we better go along with these people they might come after us no we're going
[47:02.200 --> 47:12.720]  to lose everything if we don't stand up to these pieces of trash what we have is
[47:12.720 --> 47:17.240]  criminals and control freaks and psychopaths and sociopaths and just
[47:17.240 --> 47:24.280]  weirdo demons running wild in free reign every day I see articles where police
[47:24.280 --> 47:29.200]  officers or federal police will walk into a 7-11 and just start aiming guns
[47:29.200 --> 47:33.240]  at the clerk for no reason threatening to kill them or putting a gun to their
[47:33.240 --> 47:38.600]  head of a taxi driver and saying I'll kill you I'm a federal agent they're
[47:38.600 --> 47:41.840]  letting mentally ill people that think they're Jack Bauer and who are
[47:41.840 --> 47:47.640]  completely looking for trouble get into law enforcement on purpose just like the
[47:47.640 --> 47:53.040]  Soviets and the Nazis did I have those articles here in my stack today one just
[47:53.040 --> 47:57.760]  happened in Salt Lake here it is we even have a local newscast fed using uber
[47:57.760 --> 48:03.280]  service points gun at drivers head it was all caught on video at the hotel for
[48:03.280 --> 48:09.680]  no reason just for their power back let's let's play that clip here it is
[48:09.680 --> 48:14.560]  initially he brought it up over towards my head and then he lowered it and stuck
[48:14.560 --> 48:19.280]  it under his arm Uber driver James Brothers calls the frightening moments
[48:19.280 --> 48:23.760]  in his car last Monday when passenger Byron Keith McDonald put a gun to his
[48:23.760 --> 48:28.400]  head and asked him whether he wanted to live or die I look over him I said I
[48:28.400 --> 48:33.320]  asked him what what do you mean and he pulls a gun out from back of his pants
[48:33.320 --> 48:39.080]  and he holds it to me it happened as James tried to drop off McDonald at his
[48:39.080 --> 48:43.440]  downtown hotel at about 1 a.m. last Monday the experience was shocking
[48:43.440 --> 48:48.680]  enough for James but now it turns out Byron Keith McDonald is a federal police
[48:48.680 --> 48:52.760]  officer a lieutenant with a Bureau of Indian Affairs the Department of the
[48:52.760 --> 48:57.320]  Interior in Washington DC which oversees the Bureau of Indian Affairs said in a
[48:57.320 --> 49:01.800]  statement quote Mr. McDonald was on official travel during the time of the
[49:01.800 --> 49:05.560]  incident the incident is being investigated by our internal affairs
[49:05.560 --> 49:09.240]  division which will make use of the investigation being conducted by the
[49:09.240 --> 49:14.840]  Salt Lake Police Department Byron McDonald spent five days in jail before he
[49:14.840 --> 49:18.600]  bailed out we know that his superiors are aware of what's going on Salt Lake
[49:18.600 --> 49:23.320]  County DA Simgill charged him with aggravated assault we don't care whether
[49:23.320 --> 49:29.560]  you are a police officer where whether you are let's stop right there this isn't
[49:29.560 --> 49:33.120]  just about police it's not about demonizing police there are too many
[49:33.120 --> 49:36.480]  federal police it's unconstitutional they're federalizing local police and
[49:36.480 --> 49:40.600]  more and more they're trying to hire people like this who are out there in
[49:40.600 --> 49:44.400]  the private sector I knew somebody in business who one time for no reason at a
[49:44.400 --> 49:47.640]  meeting pulled out a gun and aimed it at me and said are you scared and they
[49:47.640 --> 49:50.560]  wanted to get off of me being scared I said no I got some about to physically
[49:50.560 --> 49:55.080]  attack you better put that away man and then I left never really talked to him
[49:55.080 --> 49:59.120]  again and I learned that person had done that to basically a bunch of other
[49:59.120 --> 50:04.040]  people I knew would just pull it out put it on the table or aim it at you and
[50:04.040 --> 50:10.120]  where I come from that's how you get your neck broken but see most people that
[50:10.120 --> 50:13.520]  guy did that too would just cower in fear they wouldn't even go call the
[50:13.520 --> 50:19.800]  police do you stop that type of behavior going after criminals like that or do
[50:19.800 --> 50:26.360]  you let them do it if you let them do it they do it more and then it gets worse
[50:26.360 --> 50:30.160]  and this is the mass mental illness that we have where they're hiring
[50:30.160 --> 50:35.920]  sycophantic mentally ill people who want to menace innocent people to be
[50:35.920 --> 50:40.440]  police officers remember the cop that threatened to shoot Joe Biggs he runs
[50:40.440 --> 50:43.280]  up and he says I will effing shoot all of you right now as they stand there

[50:51.320 --> 50:56.880]  people they're hiring that that are so cowardly that they shouldn't be allowed

[54:17.720 --> 54:22.320]  I'm gonna get to some election news coming up but first nurse in Maine on
[54:22.320 --> 54:26.440]  collision course over quarantine I saw her on television news today saying I
[54:26.440 --> 54:30.040]  feel fine doesn't matter if I've been around people with Ebola I'm not gonna
[54:30.040 --> 54:33.160]  be quarantined at a government facility and I'm not gonna stay in my house
[54:33.160 --> 54:37.960]  either and Obama has come out and said yeah do whatever you want other
[54:37.960 --> 54:41.320]  countries quarantine Africa quarantines anybody doesn't want to get this stuff
[54:41.320 --> 54:45.760]  with quarantine but not us no no it's just all part of these people doing
[54:45.760 --> 54:51.280]  whatever they want Ebola vaccine trial to start in Switzerland this week oh they
[54:51.280 --> 54:56.880]  got the vaccine almost ready for you isn't that just special CDC expands
[54:56.880 --> 55:01.040]  Ebola risk factors for forced quarantine you're gonna wait till it spreads real
[55:01.040 --> 55:04.480]  bad though and then then lock you up if you show any signs of being sick period
[55:04.480 --> 55:09.720]  see do nothing up front hope it spreads out of control then take over but not
[55:09.720 --> 55:14.480]  until after the election then he's got a couple years as a lame duck insurance
[55:14.480 --> 55:18.960]  companies begin writing Ebola exclusions into policies to not cover people with
[55:18.960 --> 55:25.960]  Ebola that means they're concerned and think it might spread so that's some of
[55:25.960 --> 55:30.800]  the news on that front coming up on election news isn't this just precious
[55:30.800 --> 55:36.080]  low raza which means the race as you started a white or black group called
[55:36.080 --> 55:41.720]  the race promotes Washington Post guide on where people can vote without an
[55:41.720 --> 55:47.920]  ID gee I wonder who's gonna be voting Maryland Board of Elections probe
[55:47.920 --> 55:54.400]  Republican to Democrat ballot switch same thing in Illinois with Obama
[55:54.400 --> 55:58.280]  saying you know you can vote whenever you want vote for Republicans which
[55:58.280 --> 56:02.720]  Democrats in Illinois and that cute shocking Harvard poll millennial voters
[56:02.720 --> 56:06.480]  want GOP in charge well here's the issue that shows they are rejecting Obama and
[56:06.480 --> 56:11.880]  collectivism the problem is the Republican leadership is the same group so
[56:11.880 --> 56:16.320]  if they don't endorse the Tea Party and libertarian ideas it will then be put on
[56:16.320 --> 56:21.200]  conservatism and constitutionalism and libertarianism blame for all this we
[56:21.200 --> 56:25.560]  don't want that we need to really have a revolution of freedom being peacefully
[56:25.560 --> 56:28.760]  restored or we want to let the globalists run in the ground so they get
[56:28.760 --> 56:33.000]  to blame don't hand it over to the quasi Republicans right as the train wreck
[56:33.000 --> 56:37.840]  happens and then they blame it on us we've got to get rid of Boehner we've
[56:37.840 --> 56:41.040]  got to put constitutionalist in there that's why Bill Gates is targeting
[56:41.040 --> 56:46.080]  Democrats at the county city federal state level who are more reasonable and
[56:46.080 --> 56:49.640]  don't want to take all the guns and don't want totally open borders and know

[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:19.680]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.960]  it needs to be recognized by the president and by you and others in
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:28.080]  the administration that when the president says that he's going to set
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:32.560]  a time limit and then consider taking actions himself which many of us read
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:36.320]  to me the president again repeating i have a pen
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:39.360]  and a cell phone and if you don't act i will
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:43.600]  that that makes doing immigration reform harder not easier
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:49.360]  because those who may like what the president decides to administratively
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:54.320]  have less reason to negotiate the hard decisions to be made about how to
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.640]  enforce our immigration laws in the future
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.120]  and those who do not agree with the president's position on immigration
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:04.880]  reform say why should we negotiate if we can't trust the president
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.600]  to enforce the laws as they exist house representative bob goodlot has
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:13.280]  received information from inside president barack obama's administration
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:17.600]  detailing plans to ship non-us citizens with ebola into the united states to
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.320]  receive treatment if you are concerned about this
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.760]  problem spreading and this is a deadly disease that we're even concerned about
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.960]  the great health care workers when they come back not spreading it
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.840]  we certainly shouldn't be bringing in the patients
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.440]  goodlatt the chairman of the house judiciary committee wrote a letter to
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.080]  homeland security secretary jade johnson i love this country
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:42.960]  i care about the safety of our people i believe in public service
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.640]  and i remain loyal to you mr president and the secretary of state
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.760]  john carrey requesting any information on the plans
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:54.160]  but those requests have gone unanswered the white house also denied goodlatt's
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:58.480]  request to impose a temporary ban on non-us citizens traveling to the united
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.680]  states from the three african countries hardest hit by ebola don't panic
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:07.760]  the news hit this morning a texas nurse who treated an infected patient tested
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.640]  positive for ebola and in california a sick
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.120]  pason drawn a flight from jfk to los angeles triggered an ebola scare
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:19.040]  in boston a man is in isolation at the hospital after complaining of ebola
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.440]  like symptoms that common sense request was not only denied
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:26.800]  president obama claims it won't make a difference
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:33.120]  if we institute a travel ban instead of the protocols that we put in place now
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:38.000]  history shows that there is a likelihood of increased
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.320]  avoidance and as a consequence we could end up having more cases rather than
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.600]  less the obama administration has already illustrated their
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.680]  preference to dangerously instigate an unyielding socialist position
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:55.520]  over the safety of american citizens in 2013 immigration and customs enforcement
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:00.800]  released into the united states 2200 illegals 629 of which that have
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.240]  criminal records ranging from repeated drunk driving offenses to
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:08.720]  aggravated felony drug sexual abuse and homicide charges
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:13.200]  no one on that list was charged or convicted with murder rape or sexual
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.080]  abuse of a minor were they they were not was anyone charged or convicted of
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.760]  illicit trafficking in a controlled substance
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.640]  there were some with drug offenses the individual i mentioned earlier who is
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.680]  68 in a law firm resident were any of involved in
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:35.040]  child pornography not of the ones that i am aware of the release no
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.880]  so of the 2200 28 you can testify that none of them were involved in child
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:43.200]  pornography uh to the best of my knowledge i can testify the
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.160]  answer is is not well to the best of your knowledge just means that you don't
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.720]  have any knowledge of that information was leaked to the public
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.640]  only after usa today made a freedom of information act
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:58.640]  request although 418 charges of child sexual molestation and rape
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:02.400]  in north carolina in one month alone went heavily
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:06.320]  unreported as obama waits until after the midterm elections
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.200]  to open the floodgates what is driving the obama administration's recklessness
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:15.680]  look no further than senior advisor to president barack obama
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:20.400]  john p holdren holdren is the author of ecoscience
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.320]  the textbook that advocates putting drugs in the water supply to sterilize
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:28.160]  people mandatory forced abortions and a tyrannical
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:32.480]  eco fascist dictatorship run by a planetary regime
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.960]  holdren's radical solutions to overpopulation are routinely discussed
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.800]  in the halls of the national academy of sciences the national academy of
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.560]  sciences has published a shocking report which envisages
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:49.360]  a chinese style global one child policy is the only means of
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:53.600]  reversing climate change and reducing global population to a sustainable
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:57.920]  number of one to two billion people the white paper entitled human
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:02.320]  population reduction is not a quick fix for environmental problems
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:06.560]  authored by the university of adelaide's cori bratshaw and barry brook
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:11.200]  even entertains the impact of world wars and global pandemics that wipe out six
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.280]  billion people as potential methods of combating the threat posed to the
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:20.640]  environment by overpopulation under one scenario a global pandemic wipes out
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.160]  six billion people from the year 2041 onwards
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:29.440]  resulting in the planet's population being reduced to 5.1 billion by the year
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:33.920]  2100 however this reduction of two billion people compared to current
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.920]  figures is not sufficient to accomplish the level of human culling
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:43.280]  desired by the authors who note that even future events that rival or plausibly
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:47.680]  exceed past societal cataclysms cannot guarantee small future
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:52.720]  population sizes without additional measures such as fertility control the
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.920]  paper is edited by stanford university's paul
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:00.720]  our air lick a perennial advocate of population reduction whose dire
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.680]  proclamations about environmental catastrophes
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:08.320]  as a result of overpopulation have been proven wildly inaccurate
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:13.360]  time and time again this will confuse you because
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.960]  how can then the total population grow like this
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:21.360]  if the children doesn't increase where we roll these adults come from

[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:55.280]  central as well and i wanted to get him on about the latest on abola
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:00.240]  that he thinks like steel of the cia
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:05.520]  and like um steve quail who's on tomorrow a lot of others
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:08.640]  could be a hoax at one level there's real abola in africa it's clearly
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.520]  mutating they're coming out with a vaccine something's going on but
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:15.760]  why aren't they quarantining people here why is this nurse refusing to quarantine
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:19.200]  why are only black people dying from it is it race specific
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:23.760]  we don't pretend to know exactly what's going on but something doesn't fit
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.360]  are they covering up that it's spreading until after the election
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.920]  is over we'll find out next week won't we but i have never been more concerned
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:35.360]  in my gut and my gut's never been wrong and i think putting
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:42.640]  attention on this may force the system to change course because a lot of people
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.600]  in the system are not bad i was we're talking about that we're going to get
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.480]  into a report i've been talking about since monday
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:51.760]  this is up on info wars dot com but it links in
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:55.280]  to the different uh journal of investigative medicine and others this
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.200]  is a big prestigious major multi hospital study
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:04.400]  gmo's may be to blame yeah like kennedy may have died from being shot in the
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:09.680]  head no he did gmo's may be to blame for spike in
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.800]  kids suffering from inflammatory bowel disease
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.040]  scores of new disorders huge bowel problems undiagnosed but also diagnosed
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.760]  a doubling in hospital visits the last 10 years
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:23.520]  this is an epidemic we're going to skip this network break this is so important
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:28.720]  to get into obola get into this but also halloween candy
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.920]  my children when i've let them not so much participate in trick-or-treating
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.640]  and stuff because it's dangerous it's kind of a cultic the whole nine yards
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.360]  but they like to dress up you know and have a party at home or with some of
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.360]  their friends you know and run around and have fun
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.840]  that when i do let them go to these parties you know what candy they get
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:47.840]  sick the next week so i give them very limited amounts of candy or
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:52.400]  brands of candy that are organic and if we force a movement like we've done
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:56.800]  destroying mcdonald's and pushing you know organic foods and the rest of it
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:00.720]  we can displace things to get healthier candies for kids we don't need michelle
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.880]  obama to do it or mayor bloomberg who didn't want she
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:08.560]  they want you to have gmo and aspartame they just want to control the calories
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:12.000]  because it's all about controlling on vitamins what the intake is where they
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.840]  tell you what to eat it's not even about telling you what good foods are and
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:18.880]  educating you it's about feeding you a bunch of gmo
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.400]  crud lunchables and stuff so we're gonna talk about all this with
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.920]  doctor group and more but mcdonald's is in freefall 30 plus
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:29.440]  percent drop in profit this year alone huge profit loss the year before that
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.280]  the year before that monsanto is involved
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:37.600]  on the board bill gates is is a huge shareholder
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:42.480]  and i'm not just singling out mcdonald's but they're the leader of the pack
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:46.240]  i mean i eat mcdonald's i get sick there's no it's got silicone in the

[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:31.840]  these are things that i feel great on because it doesn't mimic testosterone
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:36.160]  it gets my glands to release what was already there being blocked by estrogen
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:39.040]  mimicers and let me tell you it's worked for me

[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.440]  happens with it believe me this similar products that aren't even
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:50.640]  as good or a hundred and fifty dollars this is fifty nine dollars
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:55.440]  and it's so expensive to make because it's so concentrated take
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:01.120]  lung cleanse it's super thick oil after you use it for a week you gotta wash
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:04.400]  out the spray cap because it gets clogged it's so thick other stuff's a
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:07.920]  one or two herbs and some menthol and you spray it maybe helps so

[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.640]  it helped me i know that the system for whatever reason doesn't want you to
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:02.720]  know what's going on with this i know the elites are obsessed with true

[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:17.120]  other things um but but but doctor you've been sitting
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.960]  for 15 minutes while i've been ranting you heard john balance report earlier
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:25.680]  abola up front obviously they're covering something up
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.200]  this nurse is refusing to quarantine even in her house
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:33.200]  uh people are dying in african mass it's mutated
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.160]  but then it's only black people it seems that are dying
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:40.000]  a lot of experts say it's race specific what do you really think's going on
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.360]  dr grip because you you also have your special forces background
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:46.400]  you're a really smart guy have a lot of big connections what do you think's
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:50.400]  going on well i i think a lot of people are
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:54.000]  confused right now and a lot of people don't really know what's going on the
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.720]  media is you know not really reporting the truth
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:00.960]  and even in the underground uh are the scientists that i've been talking to
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.920]  you know i was out in vegas talking to some people out there
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:07.920]  uh just a lot of strange things are happening you know you would think by
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.200]  now there would be more cases if it was really being spread
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:15.440]  the inconsistencies with the cdc changing their reports
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:19.600]  uh you know the girl that lived in the building with the new york doctor that
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.160]  was infected that's when they showed him the picture
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:25.280]  showed her the picture of the guy she said who's that
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:28.960]  uh you know there's just more and more evidence coming out that there's
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:32.960]  something strange happening it's either all totally fake here real in africa
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:35.920]  and they're covering it up or it's secretly spreading and they're covering
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.800]  it up but as you said i have that youtube video we should cue that up i
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:42.160]  forgot to give it to the guys and show it where she's like that's not who i
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:46.480]  lived with so they may be grabbing real people and putting actors out
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:49.280]  something the cia has been caught doing over and over again is what you're
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:52.160]  getting at i'm getting at there might be a certain section
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:57.280]  of this that could be uh that they're using actors that's what i said last
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:00.800]  week they whisk away the real victims because they can't control the narrative
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:05.440]  and then put out fake people as their spokesman almost like the boston bombing
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:09.280]  and stuff like that yeah and there's and actually i was doing some research on
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.960]  it because some people were sending me some videos and there's some pretty
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.800]  you know heavy hitting videos of evidence behind it
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:20.640]  another thing that's strange is all this neon green that they're using everywhere
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:24.960]  it seems like all of the the shirts they're giving out of the neon green
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:28.960]  there was a simpson's episode that came out a long time ago that talked about
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.160]  a bullet where marge is wearing a neon green dress i mean there's just some
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:36.480]  strange things i mean the the good news is people are actually out there putting
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:41.120]  this all together and it's not and by the way i've been
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.560]  approached by the folks at x files they were approached and told to do the
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:47.920]  episode where the government flies in the world trade center with a drill
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:50.720]  so we saw that and said that's them throwing it in our face well we know
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:53.520]  they were well yeah there was a simpson's episode
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:57.200]  where they were holding a newspaper with a nine and there was the two
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:00.480]  trade centers in the two world trade centers in the back too
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:03.920]  let me ask you this question obviously it's they call it lesser magic the
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:07.200]  globalist or an vehicle they believe if they manifest it first
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.000]  that gives it good luck when they actually do it and then if it actually
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.520]  happens it doubles their power it's like they're playing pocky mon in the real
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.240]  world it's almost like the matrix they tell you
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:19.760]  what they're gonna do and that's the the illuminati has all those illuminati
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:23.760]  cards you know and and what they want to do is put it out there they
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:26.800]  they want to put it in front of your face and show you what they're gonna do
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.240]  you know like obama said the other day this is just a test you know we're
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:33.760]  we're seeing how all this works more and more they throw it in our face if it
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.440]  was a major pandemic right now don't you think
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:41.120]  that you would be seeing exponential spreading and spreading and spreading
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:45.040]  you know i'm not sitting here saying abola doesn't exist by all means no we
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.200]  have plenty no i agree but it's either secretly
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:51.120]  spreading and they're covering it up or something's fake
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:54.720]  and we know they're acting super shady and things don't add up so
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:57.840]  we'll find out soon enough yeah the government has patents on abola with
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.680]  rabies they've done the zombie apocalypse stuff i mean everything has
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:05.760]  been there the cdc post stuff on their website about what to do in case of a
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:09.920]  zombie apocalypse you know everything is there and it's just a matter of time
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:13.360]  you know what do me a favor do me a favor i want you with anzine gucciardi
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:17.440]  to cover the basics on abola tonight he's in a host of special after the news
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:21.040]  so like it's 7 30 i take 30 minutes take an hour whatever you need
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:26.000]  get the clips cover all this in detail so i can also air some of it tomorrow and
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.960]  give the guys the clips because i've seen them too and let's just look at it
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:30.960]  let's just look at what the web is saying
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:35.760]  because we have high level cia high level state department high level fbi
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:39.920]  high level state police saying yes sandy hook's totally fake
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:43.360]  yes aurora's fake and then it all adds up on time to go into it
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.360]  yes uh a boston bombing we know it was fake
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:50.240]  i ran into a craft international guy i'm not saying they were involved but they
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:54.800]  were guys in craft outfits were there with black backpacks i guess to create
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:58.320]  a distraction they thought they were part of a driller security but they don't
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:01.600]  know that they were there as decoys and then and then the other simulant bomb
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:06.160]  goes off but this craft guy he saw me in a public and got up from the table
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:09.360]  and so that's alice jones i got to go and ran out of the restaurant basically
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:12.960]  he's wearing a craft shirt and what's he doing doing that uh but
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:16.240]  i don't have time to get into it it's just it's so overwhelming that they are
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.760]  faking more stuff because they can't control the narrative on real false
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:23.040]  flags when they blow up a real building because cops show up and see the
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:26.320]  unexploded bombs and they got to kill cops like an oakland city and stuff and
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:29.680]  doctors so they do stage things on a whole cloth now
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:33.520]  because it's so over the top no one would ever believe that i think
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:37.120]  no i i agree i think that partially this thing is a test
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:41.040]  and they're preparing to see how we react number one they're also
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:46.240]  psychologically preparing us for an actual outbreak or a pandemic
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:50.960]  uh obviously this one isn't as severe as something that could be in the future
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:54.160]  such as a rabies a bowl of vaccine which could be airborne
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:58.640]  they've already started preparing us for the fact that it could be airborne
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:03.360]  all of this though if you look at the preparations of if you want to look at
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:06.800]  the population control and reducing the population
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:11.440]  the general schema thing and the plan all starts with
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:15.680]  lowering your mental ability to make decisions and lowering your overall
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.880]  health i mean you can always trace it back that's where they make all their
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:23.120]  money if you're sick all the time you're taking pharmaceuticals they knew a lot
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:26.000]  of people were getting off pharmaceutical drugs actually and
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.360]  turning to natural medicine so they only had one other option really was to
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:33.280]  introduce more genetically modified foods into the standard american diet
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:37.360]  because even if you're not on pharmaceuticals and you're on genetically
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:40.800]  modified foods it's going to reduce your immune system let's talk about that
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.480]  when we come back that's a perfect segue into corn that's in almost every
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:49.520]  processed food you eat and 80 something percent of it's vt
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:53.360]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:58.160]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:04.960]  using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:09.520]  based around the key concepts of super oxygenation the next level in cleansing
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:13.760]  is here with key ingredients backed by real clinical studies the new oxy
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:17.040]  powder available through info wars life was invented during
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:20.000]  doctor group's research on the toxification of our bodies
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.160]  many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:27.760]  potentially dangerous ingredients oftentimes full of synthetic
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:31.120]  fillers gmo's additives or worse gently start
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:34.960]  cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:38.960]  oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:42.400]  and concoctions instead oxy powder slowly releases
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:45.680]  monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body

[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:04.000]  aging starts at the cellular level when cells become toxic
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:10.080]  they die early and aging sets in in the past decade we have witnessed unparalleled
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:14.160]  scientific discoveries during that period key patented compounds have
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:18.640]  focused on mitochondrial growth nerve growth and rejuvenation
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:23.520]  but no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health

[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:05.280]  let's put this thing out let's turn the corner and i don't agree if i've been
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.760]  ranting so i want to give you the floor as you're
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:13.280]  saying some really important things but just this week a major study came out
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:17.440]  and showed that different types of gmo corn are causing
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:21.200]  massive bleeding and death and deformity in pigs
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:25.120]  another big lawsuit got filed against another big gmo

[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:37.520]  the world won't take this stuff i remember 15 years ago family i have
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:42.240]  who are pig farmers saying look we feed them
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:46.320]  bt corn they start having to form piglets their piglets start dying they
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:49.360]  start losing weight all i know is i don't feed them that
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:52.960]  corn but it's hard to get corn 80 plus percent of it's bt
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.720]  now in the us mexico has thousands of varieties of
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:01.200]  corn where corn was first developed and used by humans
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:05.360]  99 percent national geographic reports of their ancient corn strains
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.600]  are infected with bt alone so it's taking over its genetics
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:13.520]  plants aren't one daddy one mommy you can have
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:17.280]  one percent of a plant being from another
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:22.480]  genetic strain there's a chicago tribune we'll put it back on screen pigs fed
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:25.920]  gm grains suffer health problems study says
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:30.000]  boom 2013 there's a new one out this week
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.680]  let me give you sources gmo's may be to blame
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:36.320]  again that's like saying smoking cigarettes may be to blame if you get
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.160]  lung cancer gmo's may be to blame for spike in
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:42.960]  kids suffering from inflammatory bowel disease
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:46.400]  study finds 65 increase in i bd hospitals
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:51.040]  in the last 10 years in children alone they believe as little as one percent
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:55.440]  are being reported so one percent out of a hundred and
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:59.440]  you've got 19 000 with this everybody i know has screwed up bowels now
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:02.400]  okay if you eat gmo and this is out of the journal of
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:07.040]  investigative medicine i have had the former top
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:10.000]  bio weapons people on i've had people are making five million dollars a year
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.960]  that were top scientists in england and they said sir
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:15.760]  need to get that guy back on he's pakistani speaks great english i forget
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:17.440]  his name is doctor something's real famous
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:22.160]  had him on like 10 years ago they come out with the
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:25.680]  it was called a long leaf potato and they genetically engineered it to last
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.800]  longer grow faster and he said actually we have to stop this is
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.080]  killing all the rats it's killing them we can't feed the humans and they said
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:35.360]  you're fired and i've had so many of these
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:38.240]  eyewitnesses to it that are top genetic engineers
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:41.840]  this is not debatable bill gates has invested billions
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:45.440]  in gut disorders because they're off the chart in the treatments for it not the
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:49.040]  cure while he owns the largest piece of monsanto
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:54.080]  and the other company shoveling this out and he trailblazes forced inoculation
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:59.360]  taking your guns gun control and he is the number one in funding the Ebola
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.360]  vaccine in monsanto and number one in weather
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:06.720]  modification he holds the patents on that has invested four billion
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:12.400]  this guy is like satan he is behind almost everything with that monster
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:16.960]  Warren Buffett that works with him and Ted Turner and and Oprah Winfrey and the
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:20.080]  queen of england and prince philip they all get caught
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:24.880]  meeting secretly constantly abc news this is diabolical you're living in a
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:27.760]  science fiction movie do you understand they're
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:33.440]  going to fry your guts on record while treating you for
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:37.200]  life however short it may be sucking all the money out of you with the treatment
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:41.520]  now i said you got the floor but all i do is study this doctor group like you do
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:46.160]  it's just constantly every week there's new it's just it's unbelievable
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.200]  i'm so angry that it's so hard to get around all this
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:53.840]  for my kids health i shouldn't have to live in a minefield
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:57.920]  in the global dumping center but the good news is people are rejecting gmo
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:01.840]  they're rejecting fast food they're rejecting additives
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:04.800]  and the system is just coming down on us that much harder
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:08.480]  doctor group i'm going to settle down please tell folks what you think about
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:11.920]  this i've been yelling screaming that for 20
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:15.280]  years actually it's a when i initially did the research and
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.280]  looked and made the connection you can't just be a doctor out there
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:23.440]  without looking at the world in general and looking at all the chemicals and
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:26.320]  looking at every single thing and how it affects the body
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:30.800]  the way the medical profession wants the doctors to believe and trains the
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:34.240]  doctors is let's give you a pharmaceutical for any
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:37.840]  condition that you have they don't look at the root cause of
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:42.960]  disease after 20 years of research my conclusion was
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:46.880]  everything is designed to damage your gut they're going to poison you three
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:49.120]  ways they're going to poison you through the air
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:53.520]  the food and the water the water goes into the gut
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:57.600]  the food goes into the gut and most of the toxins you breathe in the air go
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:00.640]  through the gut because it gets caught into your mucous membranes that's why
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.520]  you secrete mucous and that's why you have all those little tiny hairs when
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:07.440]  you breathe in it ultimately drains down into your gut
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:11.200]  so the three ways that they try to poison you through the air food and water
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:15.360]  ultimately end up in your stomach and then down into your gut so
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:19.840]  the gut is the most important defense that anybody has
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:23.520]  against the tyranny that's out there and against
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:28.160]  becoming ill and dependent upon pharmaceuticals and dependent upon the
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:30.960]  government and everything else and how do they do that they do that with
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:34.240]  genetically modified foods they do that with artificial flavors they do that
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:38.080]  with soy corn everything that you touch and what's
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:41.520]  happening is and this has been proven like you said with the pigs
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:45.520]  the bt toxin which is the bacillus thuringiensis toxin
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:49.920]  literally burns holes through your gut they genetically engineered it as a
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:53.440]  as an insecticide because when the insects would eat it it would blow up
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:57.760]  their stomach and they would die oh and that's why all the bees are dying that's
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:00.320]  why all the butterflies are dying you know they're you can pull up the
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:04.640]  washington post headline uh where farmers caught
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:09.360]  not planting gmo crops correctly and the sub headline from washington post
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:12.560]  four or five years ago was not planting
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.560]  refuge crops they're supposed to plant crops that they don't even harvest
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:19.760]  right next to it just so all the bees don't die
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:23.920]  but but then we're supposed to eat it what do people think it kills bees
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:28.400]  but we wonder why our kids are so sick and bill gates is laughing
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:32.320]  because they can create the disease and make money on the other side of the
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:36.800]  disease and use these things to to to transport if you have
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:40.480]  holes burned through your gut lining everything goes directly into the
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:43.600]  bloodstream your digestive system doesn't work properly
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:47.520]  you have a massive amount of everybody like you said out there
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:51.280]  kids included that have mental disorders where do you think those mental
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:54.480]  disorders that adhd adhd is coming from all the time
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:58.080]  it's coming because of all these chemicals and toxins that you're feeding
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:02.080]  your kid going through the gut lining directly into the bloodstream
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:05.120]  you read dickens books you read history books but you also read
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:08.240]  classic literature about the times whenever somebody who's normally
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:12.080]  real nice was mean or acted weird or did something bad or had nightmares
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:15.360]  or was doing weird stuff they'd say he must have gotten bad meter cheese
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:19.040]  everybody knew that bad food would make you behave bad
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.920]  and that it was all in the gut 70 percent of the immune system has been
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:25.760]  proven to be there look at that makers of genetically modified seeds say
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:31.120]  more farmers evading epa rules monsanto co and other seed makers reported a
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:34.880]  three-fold increase last year and u.s farmers caught violating
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:39.440]  in intended to stop insects from developing resistance to genetically
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:43.360]  modified corn the rules affect farmers planting seeds modified to
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:46.960]  produce a toxin derived from bacillus
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:51.280]  throngensis or bt a natural insecticide the environmental protection
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:55.680]  agency requires those growers to also plant an adjunct area a so-called
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:00.560]  refuge of bt corn so that bugs feed on both types of
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:04.720]  corn and don't become immune to the toxin no it's so they don't all die
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:11.120]  can you believe the magnitude of that this kills bees now eat it
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:14.560]  originally they said it was not going to do any harm to humans of course but
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:17.440]  if you look at the studies that they did on pigs and everything else all the
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.120]  animals that eat this corn then you can see the damage that it
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:25.760]  creates and it's shocking that we actually allow these
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:29.440]  things to take place in this country but is it normal i get mad no i shouldn't
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:33.120]  get mad at a giant criminal operation admitting it's to reduce us in
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:36.880]  domistown and the fluoride should i get mad with the mayor we have doctors and
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:40.000]  scientists come in medical doctors and scientists you know the heads of major
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.240]  university toxicology departments like dr connet
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:48.160]  and he says here's the harvard study that it causes brain damage and cancer
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:51.520]  take the fluoride out and the mayor flipped him off
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:55.600]  and flipped the camera off i shouldn't get mad by that
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:59.680]  it's i mean for your own sake you shouldn't get mad just because it stresses
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:02.320]  you out on your immune system gets dropped but i mean
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:06.880]  ultimately it's when you understand the whole process and you open your eyes to
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:10.160]  why would the mayor flip us off and we're being nice i guess it's like his
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:14.240]  pleasure to do that to us he's just that's sick
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:18.560]  i guess so i mean you know what happens when he's probably eating a bunch of gmo
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:22.000]  foods and he's it's like the mad hatter you know the mad hatter they found out
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.960]  that there was mercury in the hats that caused mental disease and anger
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:29.280]  there's 50 per there's there's up to you know this extreme levels of mercury
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:32.400]  found in high fructose corn syrup talking about halloween all the candy
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:36.400]  that all the kids are going to be taking in high fructose corn syrup gmo's
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:40.240]  artificial colors sweeteners that's right they have loopholes where high
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:44.000]  fructose corn syrup is allowed to have 10 times the safe level of lead
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.680]  mercury why is there so much lead mercury in corn syrup
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:50.880]  because of the processing and because of all the pesticides and insecticides
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:53.600]  that are sprayed on all the corn and then it gets processed
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:57.360]  and they use the chemicals that they use to process the corn so basically your
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:01.280]  child is drinking bt and round up and a bunch of other chemicals
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:06.240]  yes yes and now two four d which the which the government just passed to use
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.120]  so it's basically roach poison you're feeding your child
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:12.320]  pretty much everything that you get that's not organic
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:15.840]  is some form of poison for you and your children
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:18.880]  especially if you drink tap water humans are incredible creatures that we can
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:20.960]  take all this right now there's we're limited to
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:24.560]  pretty much drinking nothing but distilled water or purified water with
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:27.120]  organic apple cider vinegar or something like that so you get your
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:30.240]  pure minerals any other thing out there besides
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:33.120]  breast milk even breast milk is contaminated they've
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:36.160]  done studies on women across the nation and tested their
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:39.680]  breast milk and like 90 percent of them had DDT residue in there this
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:43.520]  sounds like something that evil space aliens would come up with
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:47.200]  well I mean our government is designed to reduce
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:51.360]  your health I mean the the thing is what makes us strong
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:55.280]  our health and our mental ability we're under attack
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:59.760]  depression everywhere you see anxiety everywhere you see suicidal thoughts
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:03.200]  everywhere prescription medications that they give you
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:07.200]  contain toxic elements in themselves that dumb you down and make you not want
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:10.560]  to open your eyes fluoride's the main ingredient most of them
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:14.880]  fluoride heavy metals magnesium stirrate I mean fatty acids the silicon
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:18.720]  dioxide titanium dioxide titanium dioxide which makes
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:22.320]  things white the pills white they're now linking that to the major
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:25.600]  cause of fibromyalgia say they haven't fit you know think of how
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:29.920]  many people have my algae fibromyalgia out there and it's just it
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:34.080]  can be just one chemical that's allowed in foods so you really have to look at
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:37.760]  every single thing that you put in your body and the air that you breathe and
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:42.400]  everything that you're exposed to and realize that if you want to be
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:45.920]  healthy and you want to survive whether it's a biological attack or whether
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:49.840]  it's just living longer or just being a human we don't even have
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:52.960]  humans anymore because all these chemicals alter the way
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:56.080]  you think the way you feel the way you well they came out with studies of years
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:00.080]  ago admitting that these GMO crops go through the barrier into the cell and
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:04.960]  are changing its DNA they are mutating us it's like they're mutating us into
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:08.720]  controllable robots and that's not even counting the
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:14.000]  psychological uh games why would monsanto with dioxin
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.000]  and agent orange and everything they do is evil
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.120]  we just have to come to grips that this is their mission and these other
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:25.200]  companies and bill gates are premeditatedly evil
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:29.520]  they know they knew 20 years ago bt corn and remember starling
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:32.960]  got out and they had to recall it because it was so bad it would just kill you
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:36.560]  right there but they don't want that they want you to go off and you know
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:41.280]  die over 20 years and then bill gates has all the patented treatments for you
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:46.240]  that's a diabolical guy right there that's also why they did the seed bank
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:49.280]  over there too to preserve all the seeds because they also know that there's
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:52.640]  cross-contamination with genetically modified organisms
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:59.200]  and it's not only is it harming us but it's harming the earth at the same time
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:03.440]  you're the earth is dying the earth is sick the water is contaminated and then
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:06.400]  they're the ones saying give all your liberties up we'll save the earth
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:09.520]  by cutting carbon dioxide that they admit is at the lowest level in
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:12.320]  planetary history i mean this is like they're trying to kill the
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:15.360]  planet right and when you look at all the
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:18.480]  chemicals especially the nanoparticles of aluminum that they're spraying
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:22.880]  everywhere with the chemtrails all of that is creating a damage
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:27.120]  in sick soil everywhere as well because you know there's a slew of
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:29.760]  chem maybe they are space aliens and david ike's right
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:33.120]  i mean i don't really mean that but it's so they just hate humans so much
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:38.720]  they're so evil and so scientific i guess it's the bible it's like an evil
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:41.520]  fourth dimensional creatures manipulating them or something i mean what
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:46.400]  group this is just it's just so heavy it's so scientific so premeditated
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:49.280]  and it's all admitted too it's just over the top
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:52.720]  yeah everything is out there in the mainstream if you just well i shouldn't
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:56.160]  say mainstream but the alternative media well it's in the government documents
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:58.800]  it's in the studies right but most people don't
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:02.800]  don't read those regularly i mean everybody watches cnn and you know cnn
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:06.160]  is a government controlled news organization and they're
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:09.360]  part of the whole i mean it's sandy hook they've got the same kids going in
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:12.320]  rings in and out of the building no helicopter's
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:16.000]  called they turn and it's a blue screen
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.440]  with it's it's insane right right and the and when you calcify somebody's
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:25.360]  pineal gland with fluoride and they believe in the government you
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:28.720]  know this this whole Ebola thing they're just
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:32.560]  psychologically convincing everybody that they're going to need to go run and
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:37.040]  and when the vaccine becomes available in 2015 they've created all the fear
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:40.080]  they've shown the pictures of the dead people they so this is just the pre-hype
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.720]  and they'll have another outbreak next year that's worse and then that's what
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:45.760]  this is really for
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:49.600]  you know usually if you look at the pattern of things if this was really
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:52.720]  super super bad and i'm saying this now i wouldn't have said this probably a
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:55.920]  month ago because you would have expected exponential spread
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:59.520]  already if this was something serious but this year i had three family members
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:02.320]  die and and the doctors all said it was an incredible mystery illness
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:05.600]  but the media kept it quiet they they could be disappearing all the people
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:09.040]  which is what we're getting from the doctors yeah you you never know
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:12.800]  there's always a diversion usually in most cases so
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:16.400]  what's really going on i mean and i've heard a lot about this mystery illness
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:19.600]  too we've had people calling our office saying you know
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:22.640]  i don't know what's going on with this Ebola but these other people are dying
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:26.000]  we've talked to get drawn respirators everywhere talk to all the hospitals are
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.880]  full we've talked to doctors that they're saying patients are disappearing
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:32.240]  you know we've talked to border patrol agents you met with senior ones yes
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:36.080]  that that you know people are disappearing from the border so
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:39.920]  who knows what's really going on but the thing that you need to look at it is
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:43.600]  don't believe everything that you're hearing on on the mainstream
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:47.600]  tv channels and really start looking into what are some of the other things
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:53.200]  that can be happening and most of all prepare your family and your body
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:57.040]  because if your body and your immune system is healthy and you have a strong
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:00.080]  self-healing mechanism which is what i've been talking about for years
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:03.200]  everybody has a self-healing mechanism it's right here
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:07.440]  that's the strongest medicine you'll ever have but your self-healing mechanism
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:11.120]  if it's not working a hundred percent because you're eating genetically
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:14.640]  modified foods because you're on antibiotics because you're on
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:19.200]  other prescription medications all of the other toxic chemicals that you're
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:22.640]  exposed to that is when you're going to be
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:26.960]  susceptible to any of these mystery illnesses or Ebola or any other bio
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:31.280]  warfare weapons that might come out there and the most important thing
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:34.560]  again they know the gut is important for making you sick

[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:41.600]  focus on the gut seven that's why the UN said of the 96 food conference food is

[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:48.640]  and get into more of what's in the halloween candy
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:52.000]  and how to avoid that and if there's any healthy stuff out there
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.440]  you can't even find bubblegum or regular gum that doesn't have aspartame

[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:47.440]  can we use iodine is there any scientific evidence that iodine
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:53.040]  is good as a my antimicrobial um what i was able to pull up i do
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:57.440]  have a lot of research on iodine been doing research on iodine for years
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:02.000]  i've made a list of some of the things that are really relevant i think to any
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.840]  type of airborne viruses one of them was from 1945 there
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:11.200]  was a breakthrough that occurred when jd stone and sir
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:16.560]  mcfarland bernett and bernett later went on to win the nobel prize for
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:21.600]  clonal selection theory but basically that study was in 1945 what
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:26.480]  they did was they sprayed iodine and iodine mist on the snouts of mice
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:29.600]  and then exposed them to airborne virus influenza
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:34.000]  and none of the mice were ever came down with it so
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.760]  one of many studies out there that i'll go over that
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:45.760]  are documented evidence that iodine does in fact help with control or actually
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:50.160]  prevention of certain viruses out there one of the reasons i put iodine in the
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:53.920]  lung cleanse was for that same purpose now i'm not saying
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:56.640]  yeah that that will work a hundred percent of the time or anything what i
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:58.480]  wanted to do was just share some of these
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:03.120]  is scientific studies with people because if you were to use the lung cleanse
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:06.800]  properly spray it in that's why i have everybody breathe because it coats the
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:09.760]  mucous membranes all the way down into the lungs
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:13.280]  let's just say i would feel much more comfortable
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:19.760]  going into any type of area that might be contaminated whether it's flu season
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:23.840]  anything if i have a bottle of that with me and i can just spray it in my mouth
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:26.400]  and inhale it or for that matter if i'm in a public
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:29.520]  place you know for schools i give it to my kids when they go to school around
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:34.000]  flu season but dr group it's also what being on iodine real iodine because i
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.360]  tried other iodine had some effect but this real nascent iodine from the
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:42.400]  crystal sorts especially has just supercharged my skin my hair my
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:48.000]  weight loss stamina energy is that because the FDA has such a low
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.840]  allowance of what they say you need under codex elementarius
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:55.200]  and that a larger dose and of course consult your physician first
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:58.720]  it's just done wonders for me right yeah the the
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:02.720]  dose the rda is a joke i mean that's basically doesn't even give you enough
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:05.920]  to barely survive the recommended daily allowance
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:09.440]  and one of the reasons the rda is so low for iodine is just because they don't
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:13.440]  want you to understand and know the effects of iodine iodine is used for
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:17.360]  every single cell in the body it's one of the things that i will die without it
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:20.800]  you will die without it for sure i mean you will definitely get
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:26.320]  massive thyroid issues you can survive on tiny tiny amounts of iodine but
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:29.920]  that's the thing you just survive the way that it's
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:34.000]  the globalists and everything is set up right now with the poisons everywhere
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.400]  is that you barely survive and you have to lean on government lean on
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:42.960]  government health care they they can decide
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:46.720]  how to run your life what prescription medications you need to be on
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:52.480]  and all medications do is they cover up the main problems in the body anyway
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:56.560]  it's not ever designed to fix anything but to keep you
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:59.920]  ill and breast cancer is up several thousand percentage points in the us
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:02.640]  in england other parts of the world it's not
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:05.840]  brazil started adopting our practices suddenly there are things going up
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:10.000]  every country that takes in gmo you name it or starts planting glyphosates using
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.440]  roundup no one ever says why don't we find
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:17.840]  why it's increasing it's always find a cure well no find out why it's becoming
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:20.720]  an epidemic it's like find a cure for diabetes no
[01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:23.920]  find out why everybody's getting it that's like the whole breast cancer scam
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:26.480]  with the whole pink ribbons and everything where
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:29.760]  they promote all this promote all this promote but if you track the money back
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:33.360]  it goes straight back into the pharmaceutical companies to produce
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:36.800]  chemicals the merc manual says chemotherapy is a derivative of mustard
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:40.080]  gas oh my gosh we're gonna come right back stay with us

[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:55.120]  piosk that give you these brainwashing answers

[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:07.360]  tell folks your view on this i i agree with you talking about good news i
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:12.080]  think that the public is waking up uh every single day it's the hundredth
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:16.480]  monkey phenomenon you know if is the more information that you get
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:19.200]  out the more information that you get out people are realizing that the
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:22.240]  prescription medications are not fixing them they're turning to natural
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:25.680]  solutions that's why there's a big attack on all natural
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:30.000]  companies right now all the restrictions that the fda is putting on all the
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.360]  manufacturers to make sure everything is tested they're
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:37.280]  they're really creating a financial nightmare for natural supplement
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:41.280]  companies right now because it's costing them so much more
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:44.880]  to produce and all the testing requirements that the fda is
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:48.000]  laying down on them with all the new inspections and everything else
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.960]  and california has standards that are impossible
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:55.040]  there's more toxins in the air than california will allow right the prop 65
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:59.440]  that was all contrived by the attorneys over there in california to try to
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:04.320]  create massive amounts of lawsuits to sue everybody that had 0.5
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:08.800]  micrograms of lead uh in their products but all in all
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:13.200]  the it all comes down to focus on your gut
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:16.560]  make sure that you have good private probiotics in there
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:21.040]  you know i've said before the appendix is the microcomputer system of your body
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:25.120]  your gut is the brain in your system the gut is the immune system
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:29.760]  that's why oxy powder uh that's why good probiotics are so essential
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:32.560]  oxy powder i wish i'd have taken it earlier when you said
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:35.840]  just magical stuff available at m4slife.com
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:39.040]  with what it's done at a time release oxygen
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:43.840]  other flushes i've had to do did not feel good we're painful not with this
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:46.800]  i mean i was kind of scared of it because other flushes i did were painful
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:51.120]  this stuff is just it's amazing it is amazing that's
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:55.840]  that's why my main focus is on the gut i've got over 3 000 documented
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:59.840]  cases of just about every single disease out there that has been
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:04.880]  reversed uh and it all starts from cleaning the body i mean i am completely
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:08.000]  convinced right now that if you have a clean body disease
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.680]  cannot exist inside your system but you have to take the effort you mean you
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:14.320]  have people are addicted that's another thing we have here's an example when i
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:17.360]  was a kid i would eat a pint of dutch chocolate ice cream
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:21.200]  with all the additives and gmo and the high fructose corn syrup and a week
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:25.040]  later i get zits all over my face and my mom would say no more sweets and i
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:28.640]  didn't have zits and all the other kids did i mean it's real simple
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:34.000]  well a lot of the chemicals that are used in in preserve as preservatives in
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.480]  food are addictive chemicals they're designed to make you addicted to that
[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:41.920]  food like high fructose corn syrup for example is extremely addictive
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:47.120]  it causes uh diabetes a massive obesity they use it for rats and same with
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:50.640]  aspartame artificial sweeteners so it's about
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:54.160]  changing your diet and putting things into your body
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:57.520]  that are actually healthy for you that are organic

[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:12.880]  i look like total hell now i just look kind of bad
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:17.120]  and it's been transformative what's happened following the regiments even
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:20.000]  partially because i forget all the time and do things i shouldn't
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.760]  but just a 20 30 change in my life has been revolutionary

[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:28.960]  i got some you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:33.040]  i call it info wars life
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:37.040]  we're coming to you from deep in the heart of texas austin
[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:41.360]  i didn't ask george norrie is he out in la or is he somewhere deep beneath the
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:45.920]  earth there in st louis he actually does have an
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:49.200]  office and broadcasts out of an underground cave they have a big complex
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:51.120]  of caves there that a lot of businesses on them
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:54.560]  george norrie obviously does not need to be introduced
[02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:59.120]  i've been on pierce morgan and they said that was the biggest political media of
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:02.480]  end of the year la times and cnn voters said it was
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:07.600]  i've been on the bbc nightline rolling stone
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:11.760]  esquire you name it cover stories and never
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:15.920]  gotten one tenth the response that i've gotten going on coast to coast
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:21.200]  am dot com going on that 500 and almost 600 radio
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:24.080]  stations they're on in canada they're on all over the world
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:27.360]  you know most u.s radio shows even if they're popular like like rush limbaugh
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:30.400]  do not end up airing on broadcast stations other parts of the world but
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:35.200]  his show is so fascinating and the family of guests he has on is so diverse and
[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:40.160]  thought-provoking the coast to coast is america's radio
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:43.840]  export kind of like the beetles with a british invasion
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:48.640]  george norrie is the radio invasion of the world i was just thinking about that
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:51.760]  last night i was on his show last week and just got
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:56.160]  mobbed on the streets walking around austin going to restaurants
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:59.760]  hey alex i've heard you on george norrie that was a great two hours i like
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:03.040]  when you get george on your show and then the waitress comes over i heard you on
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:06.320]  george norrie and then i'm at the gym hey i heard george norrie heard you on
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:09.040]  590 that's because just here in austin he
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:12.400]  has last time i saw the ratings something like 70% of the total radio
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:15.840]  broadcast audience now you're killing it if you got 10%
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:18.720]  of the audience back when i was you know on at night here
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:23.280]  before george uh killing it's 10% of the total audience up against a m
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:28.480]  fm rock and roll hip hop uh spanish music
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:32.560]  i'm not kissing george's but i just don't think anybody sings the songs of his
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:35.840]  praises like they should uh that this is big media
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:40.480]  and and talk radio is the only place that still has giant audiences
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:44.320]  msnbc cnn and even fox has what three million on their big shows
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:49.920]  well george norrie has 678910 million a show 1615 you know 20 million depending
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:53.200]  on the week but you don't hear cnn hyping it you
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:56.160]  don't hear time magazine hyping it because they don't have audiences
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:59.440]  anywhere near it msnbc's got 200 000 viewers
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:03.600]  on their average show 500 000 on their top show cnn same story
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:07.440]  they're in freefall that's why you see the global is
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:10.880]  trying to destroy talk radio with all the regulations and fcc
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:14.480]  coming in and moves towards the fairness doctrine
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:19.040]  is because they're scared of it they want to control and dominate and censor the
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:22.080]  new media with cast sunstein white house tactics to cause
[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:26.480]  infighting on the internet something george's never involved in
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:30.000]  that's why i'm never involved in it but what can they do about talk radio well
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:33.520]  they can try to buy up the companies and just basically bankrupt it
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:37.440]  running into a wall that's why it's so important that we continue
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:41.600]  to promote new media and old media just like i'm on over 160 am and fm
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:45.520]  stations or like 170 support those local am and fm
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:49.280]  affiliates become sponsors support those sponsors let
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:52.640]  them know why you support them and if you're listening to us right now or
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:55.440]  george norrie tell people about the show
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:59.520]  we have the audience if we leverage it if you leverage it
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:03.440]  it's over george i remember first hearing when he took the show over like
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:07.600]  i don't know it has to be like 15 years ago or something i remember hearing
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:11.760]  george on air saying it's not the law under the
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:15.280]  model states health emergency powers act to take the vaccines
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:18.800]  and they've been credited him in the news is getting a movement going
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:22.480]  to say hey it's not the law and we shouldn't have them have regulations
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:25.600]  for force inoculations starting with firefighters police and
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:29.760]  nurses and see that's why i'm so excited about george
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:32.880]  is that in this whole pantheon of great talk show host
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:36.080]  he's right up there at the top and it's another testament
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:39.360]  to getting out of the left right paradigm with complex issues
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:43.280]  some of them wacky some of them profound and and and really bringing people
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:46.160]  together like drudge report you know having
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:50.640]  videos out of chicago of libertarian black folks breaking with obama
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:53.600]  now george i'm going to stop buttering you up here but i just thought
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:56.080]  i would talk about how important you've been over the years
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:13:00.720]  even before you were in talk radio uh winning three emmy's for news
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:05.520]  uh just so much you've done that's why i respect your view on the state of the
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:09.120]  world so where is the world right now what do you make of the drudge
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:12.960]  headline they dare not speak his name democrats won't even say his name
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:17.280]  well what does it mean that brand obama has fallen so incredibly hard
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:21.280]  then we'll get into obola we'll get into the elections and whatever else you
[02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:25.600]  want to cover george well first of all i like great to be on your program again
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:29.440]  i mean i really look forward to it and you talk about response because after
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:32.960]  i'm on your show i open up all my coast to coast
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:37.040]  am email and everybody's listening to you so
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:41.040]  thanks for having me on oh there's massive crossover we are living
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:44.960]  in the strangest times and most difficult times
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:49.520]  i can remember in my entire life and broadcast but
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:53.440]  let's go back a little bit when george bush was the president
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:57.360]  the son nobody wanted him anymore you know
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:01.920]  aside from a few republicans people were fed up with them they wanted out
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:07.920]  and they ran to barack obama they ran to him they cherished him they voted him
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:13.280]  in now here we are six years later people have made a complete
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:17.040]  turn again they want him out they don't want anything to do with them
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:22.240]  his own party shies away from him they don't want to mention his name
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:26.160]  what does this tell you about our political spectrum
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:30.800]  in the united states people just don't trust
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:35.040]  candidates anymore they don't trust elected officials
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:38.560]  because they're given the wrong person
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:42.240]  they're not given somebody like ron paul who comes out and tells the truth and
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:45.200]  lays it out there for you and cares about you
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:48.480]  we're given politicians who have their own agenda
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:52.800]  whatever it is and people are finally getting to that point where they're fed
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:56.240]  up this is an interesting election right now
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:59.840]  because it comes up next tuesday and i'm in st louis
[02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:03.760]  as you mentioned i go back and forth between here in los angeles
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:07.760]  and uh i have a secret location by the way in dallas which i don't tell anybody
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:13.760]  about i love texas but i've got to say people are just
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:17.600]  they're done they're done with the political system and democrats
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:21.600]  in the st louis area who are up for election
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:25.120]  and reelection they don't want anything to do with it
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:29.200]  i mean if the president today and this is a sad state of affairs
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:33.520]  the president today said look i want to come to st louis and campaign for you
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:37.840]  they don't want him here and it's unfortunate
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:43.920]  it it truly is i mean people need to trust their politicians
[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:48.400]  and we're just not yet i mean you don't know barack obama
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:51.760]  when he came out with his the in this these are the mistakes he made in
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:56.800]  ellis when he first came into office had a tremendous mandate
[02:15:56.800 --> 02:16:01.040]  you know people wanted him people didn't want nothing to do with george bush
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:04.720]  anymore he picked up on the bailout system
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:08.160]  exactly the way george bush had presented it
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:11.920]  and was funding it and he just carried the he just carried the ball into the
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:15.120]  end zone the same way he then immediately went into his
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:18.320]  health care program without thinking it through
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:22.400]  and everything he has done administratively
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:26.880]  has fallen short whether it's babbling isis in the middle east
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:32.320]  or you know a naming a czar on a bolo who is nowhere to be found
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:36.800]  everything he has touched has just not turned off the way it should
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:39.600]  and people have finally gotten to a point where they say
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:43.120]  we're done you know i hate to exist in a
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:47.920]  two years before another election and we'll talk about those candidates
[02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:52.320]  in a moment but people are going to be limping to the finish line
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:57.520]  with this president and i'm non-partisan as you well know we don't
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:00.800]  talk politics on coach the coach so you're getting
[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:05.840]  some of my personal views here we're at a point in this country
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:11.440]  where unless we get some people in office like the wrong polls
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:16.800]  we are in serious serious shape george norry i totally agree with you i see a
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:20.560]  major political realignment where it doesn't take people
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:24.960]  four or five years to wake up to a political party or a political group
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:28.880]  lying to them people are waking up in months now
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:32.320]  and if the republicans who are probably going to sweep the house in the senate
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:34.720]  next week despite massive election fraud and
[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:37.680]  legal voting if they don't deliver some basic tax
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:42.400]  relief some basic corruption reform dial back the police state
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:46.080]  if they don't stop the lying it is going to become
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:50.320]  very destructive and then you realize there is a political group behind all
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:53.280]  this that wants to wreck the country that wants to
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:58.000]  basically destroy confidence so how do you not trust the liars
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.920]  but at the same time have enough confidence for society to still
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:06.320]  work together because as you said when people stop trusting everything
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:11.680]  then society really does collapse i mean there's extremes of both sides
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:15.120]  no doubt i believe that the people like alex
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:20.560]  jones who come forward and tell the truth based on your own
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:24.880]  investigations based on what you see you just don't spout
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:27.040]  things out you're not one of those talk show
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:31.360]  votes that just grows out opinion you check first
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:37.040]  you research first you quote articles i i've seen this happen time and time
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:40.160]  again where people have tried to come after you
[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:44.240]  or saying something and you've got sources behind you
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:47.680]  all the way up your arm sure if i did not would have been sued into oblivion
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:51.440]  absolutely absolutely and so what is happening now
[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:55.760]  and i think in the long run said this before i'll see it again
[02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:59.360]  i think that the american people will win out
[02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:04.000]  over this gross stupidity that is happening around this country right now
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.720]  what we have lost in government is the most simplest thing
[02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:12.720]  and that's common sense they're just not doing things
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:19.120]  that are for the people and you know the greedy money barons have taken over
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:23.360]  and multi-level corporations are pushing their agenda
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:27.200]  and in the long run so it's going to be a rough
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:31.840]  rough road we're going to win well sure don't in my mind we're going to win
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:35.760]  i agree with you they can't shut us up that's right can't stop
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:39.600]  can't stop the signal george norrie coast to coastam dot com beyond belief
[02:19:39.600 --> 02:19:43.600]  dot com for his hit tv show coast to coastam dot
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:46.640]  com beyond belief dot com we're going to come back and talk

[02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:15.200]  i've been going on george's show it's got to be 13 14 years now
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:20.320]  and i thought about a half my life i've been on air more than half my life
[02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:24.400]  pretty pretty hard to believe how time flies by so quickly george norrie
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:27.040]  is our guest coast to coast a m dot com i'm your host
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:30.800]  alex jones and i'm on here during the day he's on overnight
[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:34.880]  and with the coast to coast sensation and he's here with us today
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:37.840]  in the long segment coming up we'll get more into abola
[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:41.600]  and other issues but ferguson continues to blow up
[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:45.440]  and i know that you you have a home and are broadcasting right now from very
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:48.080]  close to there i'm concerned that when it comes out
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:51.680]  they're not going to indict this cop that all hades is going to break loose it
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:54.400]  already has been and i'm not defending police state
[02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:57.520]  tactics our own reporters got shot with rubber bullets for no reason
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:25:00.560]  but it did turn out the cop told the truth and was in danger
[02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:04.080]  and it was a justified shooting but people say they don't care if it's been
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:08.800]  proven that to be a justified shooting cnn msnbc are still
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:11.280]  race baiting it are they hoping for some racial
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:15.680]  blow-up as a diversion for obama i don't think they're hoping alex for a
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:19.360]  racial blow-up but uh i'm concerned that it could happen
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:23.360]  you know i went through the detroit riots back in the 60s
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:27.440]  and about a month or so ago when i was back in st. lois i went out to ferguson
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:32.080]  and looked at the area during the daytime and you know it's a small area i mean
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:37.120]  it doesn't look like a huge war zone like you see on cnn but it's upsetting
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:41.040]  because businesses have boarded up their places and they're trying to stay open
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:44.640]  and you know you go buy it and see if you know wood all over the place
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:47.680]  boarding up the windows you don't even know if they're open or not
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:51.360]  so those people are really getting hit or suffering the most
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:55.280]  the worst part about it is is you got a lot of infiltrators coming in from
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:59.280]  outside of the st louis area now who were just coming in for their own
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:03.600]  publicity or just to you know grab a rouse and do things like that
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:07.360]  now you're absolutely right the police officer apparently
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:12.640]  had to defend himself why in god's name that this individual had to
[02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:18.480]  hustle with the cops it's beyond me um he should have just merely said you know
[02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:22.560]  okay i'm getting out of the street which is what the police wanted in the first
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:25.520]  place just don't walk down the middle of this road
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:30.320]  and you know they told him get out and uh and all h broke loose between the cop
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:34.960]  and the individually got killed now was it excessive did he fire off too many
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:37.840]  bullets i think this problem would have started
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:41.840]  even if he had shot once even if the police officer had shot him one time
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:46.880]  point is the cop told the truth and the some of the other locals lied but
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:51.200]  other black witnesses confirm what later came out in video and witnesses so i
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:56.720]  just don't get everybody's staking the whole world on this event when
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:26:59.760]  it's it's it's not even an example of a cop being out of control
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:02.800]  there's plenty of examples of police doing bad stuff
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:06.240]  and a lot of times they end up getting in trouble now
[02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:11.120]  i just think only scapegoating the police feeds into this balkanization
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:14.400]  program the system wants where it's at us against them mentality
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:18.560]  and i think that's why the controlled media tries to promote a police state on
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:22.480]  one hand but also blame the police for everything at the same time it's like
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:25.280]  saying oh look they have all these armored vehicles in
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:30.160]  ferguson well who gave it to them the the attorney general was blaming local
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:35.360]  police when their training and armor came from homeland security george
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:38.880]  we have a friend here who are local police officers alex
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:42.960]  and many of them have scheduled vacation time coming up
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:46.560]  they have been told no vacation time right now
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:52.720]  uh you've got to be on hold so they're anticipating the potential of problems
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:56.720]  if and when the uh ruling on the indictment or non indictment comes
[02:27:56.720 --> 02:28:00.880]  through on the police officer and you're right the speculation is that the
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:06.160]  officer is not going to be indicted and once that happens when that comes out
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:09.680]  who knows what's going to happen uh but you know what
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:13.040]  uh you got to get to a point where you know you and i have talked about the
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:17.360]  police state for some time uh if this is one of those times where
[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:21.440]  you need police forces in place you can't have people
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:26.240]  looting you know shooting them you know doing whatever they do we need some
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:28.720]  order well sure i mean we care about the police
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:32.320]  officers we don't like the politicians and the police state
[02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:36.880]  people tend to confuse those i know you don't uh
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:40.560]  again all this federalization all this militarization all this training
[02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:43.840]  the welfare society all of it is coming out of hollywood
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:47.520]  out of dc and then the police are on the ground
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:51.760]  who are being trained to act like this and then the feds go look at how horrible
[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:55.760]  your police are we'll federalize them yeah there's no doubt about it so we're
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:00.400]  going to watch this situation unfold i don't know when they're going to make
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:04.880]  the announcement there's talk that they may do it on a
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:11.440]  sunday which is a strange time of course but uh they may do it on some day
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:16.720]  like that to minimize a crowd but we'll see what happens in the
[02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:20.560]  interesting phenomenon about all of this social network
[02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:24.400]  has made demonstrations so much more powerful
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:28.000]  i mean because now you you tweet and you get the word out
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.800]  as they did in the middle east during the year of spring
[02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:35.360]  two years ago and i mean instantly you've got people out there
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:39.120]  and yes and you never know it'll cause that chain reaction

[02:33:26.240 --> 02:33:30.480]  jones well here's the big headline that just went
[02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:36.320]  line that info wars dot com directly from a cdc report and documents
[02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:40.320]  confirmed by the u.s army that i want red link to put at the top
[02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:44.800]  of prison planet dot com and info wars dot com
[02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:49.520]  this is an article by kit daniel cdc abola spreads like the flu
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:53.040]  a cdc flyer describing the droplet spread of abola
[02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:56.720]  which happens when germs traveling inside droplets are coughed and sneezed
[02:33:56.720 --> 02:34:00.320]  from a sick person is nearly identical to the cdc's
[02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:04.480]  description of influenza which it breaks down and then he links in there to the
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:07.680]  army's own report confirming that and here's the issue
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:12.240]  we knew years ago that they believed it was someone airborne
[02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:15.200]  and now we know that in temperatures below 45 degrees
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:21.920]  it can live for days and travel miles so if this is real abola because it could
[02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:24.560]  be a simulant or something else it's very suspicious
[02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:28.720]  we got a big problem on our hands either they're covering up
[02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:32.880]  in my view on george norris expert take on this
[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:37.920]  either they're covering up for the election and hiding it
[02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:41.360]  or it's not real abola because they would wear
[02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:44.640]  spacesuits previously and this abola clearly lasts longer
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:48.080]  incubates longer it's much more dangerous it's real in africa i'm not
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:51.760]  saying there isn't an abola crisis there's just no response and but then i
[02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:54.000]  talked to a medical doctor in dalis who's high level
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  we have a medical doctor from missouri on but they didn't fire monday but they're
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.840]  ostracizing he's the head of several hospitals
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:04.560]  he said no the feds come in and grab people out of the
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:07.680]  harry trimmann hospital they're bleeding out and disappear them
[02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:13.040]  i had senior board of patrol on by name saying this is happening
[02:35:13.040 --> 02:35:17.200]  zack taylor and others dr group met with senior board patrol who were
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:20.960]  active duty trying to figure out what's going on
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:24.000]  see the board patrol the police the feds don't even know
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:31.680]  it's it's c o g fema c d c uh north com uh the army doesn't even know
[02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:34.160]  what's going on it's only senior people
[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:37.520]  and believe me the the military teams are much bigger though than
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:41.040]  them saying it's a 35 person team no they're grabbing folks all over
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:43.840]  well are they grabbing people that really have malaria and it's a drill to
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:46.800]  see if they can get away with it still people are disappearing we know that's
[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:50.160]  going on george nori i want your take on this there's
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:54.000]  uproar over u.s troops who are under abola quarantine in italy
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:57.120]  but in the past the navy the army everybody quarantines people that are
[02:35:57.120 --> 02:36:02.240]  might be sick uh they shouldn't have been sent there uh trump says a new kind
[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:05.280]  of hell to pay if soldiers are infected paper
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:09.200]  dr lied about new york city travel turns out he traveled a lot more places
[02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:12.560]  what is he doing this other nurse now who's around abola
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:17.120]  saying she won't even self quarantine documents have now been released and
[02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:20.800]  revealed confirming the state department plans to bring non-us citizens
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:25.120]  with abola here uh i mean i made jokes about that two weeks ago and had
[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:30.160]  democrats sign uh fake petitions in austin saying bring them here
[02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:34.240]  this is becoming twilight zone but kit daniels is here
[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:37.120]  george nori is here we're going to have kit pop in in a moment
[02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:40.800]  about his story but george nori what do you think's really going on george
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:44.640]  nori of coast to coast a m dot com and beyond belief what do you
[02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:47.760]  think's really going on george well i find it unusual where alec
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:52.320]  buddy bolo it's been around for decades and now they're saying by
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:56.160]  january they can have vaccines what's taken so long
[02:36:56.160 --> 02:37:02.400]  that's strange librarian newspapers have reported that abola was started by us
[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:07.440]  to get them uh that is something that a lot of people have suspected a long
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:12.640]  long time ago as well first of all we should immediately and as i've said
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:16.560]  this weeks ago we should ban any flights in from those
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:20.160]  west african nations and seal off the borders with these
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:24.160]  airplanes and not let people in it's cruel
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:27.520]  it's cruel but it's got to be done australia is doing that we should be
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:30.720]  doing that we've got to minimize it as much as possible
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:34.000]  heck i was the even one who did not want the
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:37.840]  doctor and the worker to come in when they first came in
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:41.360]  a month and a half ago uh because i thought it would be a problem
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:46.160]  now with the possibility of letting real truly bolder patients into the
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:52.000]  country they're going to quarantine the troops for 21
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:55.840]  days those troops those american troops that we sent out there to help
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:58.960]  build little hospital rooms and things like that
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:02.480]  they're going to be quarantined for up to 21 days
[02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:06.640]  maybe longer before they're even going to be allowed out anymore
[02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:10.480]  uh the the danger of all of this is not the widespread
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:15.920]  keep in mind 36 000 americans die every year from the so-called natural blue
[02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:20.000]  if we had 36 000 people dying of Ebola we'd be running around going crazy
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:23.760]  screaming and yelling the problem with Ebola is
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:27.360]  is that 70 percent of the people who get it are dying
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:31.280]  we've been fortunate in this country that those people that have had it
[02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:34.400]  we've been able to take care of that they've been able to fight it
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:38.000]  uh we we must be doing something differently than they're doing in west
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:41.520]  african sure what's going on with this nurse who's around a ball of patients
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:45.040]  and then was sick so they quarantine her now she's out of the hospital obama
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:48.240]  orders are released uh now the main governor seeking to
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:50.800]  make nurse abide by quarantine standard house
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:55.760]  bloomberg's reporting uh the neighbors are freaking out the locals are
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:59.040]  i think people are so scared because the flu might kill one half of
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:04.880]  one tenth of one percent and so we know if we get it it's a very low
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:07.680]  chance Ebola kills 70 i think that's why it's so
[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:11.040]  scary that if it starts spreading in the winter months
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:15.440]  why was there a default george to stop people flying in before
[02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:19.360]  to quarantine before to not bring a ball of patients in before
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:23.840]  why has it all changed why do people not have any confidence in the system
[02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:28.160]  why do they say you can't get it on a bus or a train but scientists say you can
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:32.320]  why are they lying so much are they lying or are they idiots
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:36.880]  or maybe a combination of both sure uh it just seems that
[02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:41.680]  everything they try to do they screw up i mean if
[02:39:41.680 --> 02:39:45.280]  if you had people like this in your company alex or
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:49.920]  in coast to coast we would have fired them a long time ago i mean we just you
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:53.680]  just can't have that kind of incompetence and that's what we've got
[02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:56.960]  right now we've got it in common sense don't you
[02:39:56.960 --> 02:40:00.960]  you've got it you've got a disease that spreads like crazy
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:05.600]  when when you're when you when you get any kind of solutions or body foods or
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:08.560]  anything on you and like you said it could be you're born
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:13.200]  who the heck knows uh you got to be careful and they're not
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:18.000]  they're being very very foolish with it uh letting so many people in who have
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:23.760]  this disease is ridiculous and we have just touched the tip
[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:26.720]  of the iceberg of what's going to happen with Ebola
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:31.120]  i mean you get these isolated cases uh that's not a lot
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:36.160]  but it's going to grow it's going to faster it's not over by a long shot so
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:39.200]  you think it's overall real i tend to agree with you
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:44.320]  something's creepy here though george norrie pulling back then
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:47.200]  obviously you've on average Ebola spreads for each person that has it to
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:50.320]  two other people you've got the the guy that died in
[02:40:50.320 --> 02:40:54.320]  Dallas and you've got uh this doctor and this nurse and then others
[02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:57.040]  also there are Ebola patients they're being brought in
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:41:00.560]  more than 25 of them that are aid workers now they're going to bring in
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:04.720]  foreign aid workers that have it and they're saying it's no big deal
[02:41:04.720 --> 02:41:10.640]  when before they wear spacesuits and i mean you've got all this happening
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:13.600]  if two nurses got it from one guy following the average
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:17.120]  then you've got to expect with this medical doctor that was in the infectious
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:20.800]  stage at bowling alleys and restaurants and on the subway
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:24.800]  that it's had to have spread so either it's fake
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:28.000]  or it's going to spread now i'm not saying it's going to be some pandemic and
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.960]  we're going to see hundreds of thousands get sick and dying
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:34.000]  but clearly it's one of the other george what do you think
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.880]  well i i don't think it's fake i think it's real
[02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:41.680]  uh it it's it's happening and it could it could get out of control
[02:41:41.680 --> 02:41:45.760]  and that's the bottom line it could get out of control what does your gut tell
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:48.640]  you are we going to see more cases no there's no question about it
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:52.960]  are we going to see widespread cases i don't know yet i can't speculate on
[02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:55.040]  that but we're going to see more cases what do you think about the
[02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:58.480]  disappearance that i've confirmed with medical doctors on and off record
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:02.080]  of people the these federal teams come and grab them
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:05.840]  and they're probably quarantining them or testing them or grabbing
[02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:09.680]  a blood from them in case they get cured that you said it's a serum
[02:42:09.680 --> 02:42:14.560]  who knows but uh it's just very why not tell the public why not say if we think
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:17.440]  you have a ball or put your core names the public would support that
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:20.880]  i think they would i think they would but i think they think that these are just
[02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:25.440]  to grab people and take them away to set the precedent to secretly grab
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:29.440]  whoever they want in the future we are going to come and take you
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:33.200]  i tell you it's and then that only destroys confidence more causes all the
[02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:38.960]  rumors uh it is really out of control kit daniels one of our info wars news
[02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:43.680]  writers and special reporters is here and kit you notice something very easy uh
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:47.440]  to uh you know freak out about here uh hiding in plain view i want to get
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:51.520]  george norris take on this again george norris of coast to coast a m dot com
[02:42:51.520 --> 02:42:55.680]  one of the top syndicated hosts in the world uh joining us right now
[02:42:55.680 --> 02:43:00.160]  uh kit just a few weeks ago the cdc had one flyer out on obola
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:04.000]  now their new flyer says something pretty scary on it
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:08.160]  uh we're going to show folks a document cam shot of this if they're tv viewers
[02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:10.880]  uh kit describe for radio listeners what we're looking at here well the
[02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:16.240]  document on the left is from the cdc on october 16th it's about the transmission
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:19.600]  of obola it says nothing about droplet spread of obola
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:26.800]  but now the cdc released another flyer on the right on monday the 27th which
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:29.760]  does admit that yes a bullet can spread through a
[02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:34.160]  droplet droplets in the air now we were attacked by
[02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:38.000]  no exaggeration hundreds of publications uh two and a half months ago for
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:41.200]  saying this we were just linking to the cdc's internal documents that were
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:46.720]  public but not really widely circulated saying this too
[02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:50.800]  so why do you think they're now kit coming out and quietly admitting this
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:53.920]  because now even the mainstream media is forced to admit that yes
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:57.680]  air uh a bullet can spread through droplets in the air so now they're just
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:01.440]  slowly admitting trying not to bring too much attention to themselves
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:04.320]  by quietly releasing a document this new revelation
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:08.160]  well this is what concerns me is that it it doesn't die right away in cold
[02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:11.120]  weather and spreads according to the army i know you have links to that in your
[02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:16.160]  article thank you kid george what's your take on this latest cdc
[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:20.480]  fact flyer again it shows the incompetence of what's happening out there
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:24.080]  alley but you're not a doctor i'm not a doctor but we could have
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:28.400]  told people years ago that obola or any disease that's
[02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:33.600]  transmittable with droplets or any kind of fluids or any potential if you come
[02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:37.760]  up to someone and they sneeze on you it somehow that gets into your
[02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:42.160]  system you're going to get part of the virus now will your body fight it off
[02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:45.440]  perhaps look we all have cancer cells in our system
[02:44:45.440 --> 02:44:48.320]  but it's our immune system that's keeping it in check
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:53.280]  in most cases but there are some people that don't have strong immune systems
[02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:57.680]  and they come down with cancer it's the same thing with this obola situation
[02:44:57.680 --> 02:45:00.560]  except it's tougher it's tougher to fight off
[02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:05.280]  and you know it just shows me once again the incompetence
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:08.320]  how could they on one hand say it's not possible
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:11.760]  and then weeks later they come out and say well
[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:18.720]  maybe it is well we gmo corn like bt that is in major studies on record to kill
[02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:20.880]  the honeybees that eat it and it's linked to kids
[02:45:20.880 --> 02:45:24.720]  having you know these leaky guts and then we wonder why our immune systems are
[02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:28.080]  shutting down it's because they're bombarded they're overwhelmed
[02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:32.400]  we are in this toxic environment uh i want to expand george before we get into
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:35.840]  some other topics in the time we have left with you to talk about beyond
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:39.600]  belief.com and your hit tv show that i'm finally

[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:52.080]  for our november 8th event in toronto maybe next year alex
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:57.280]  while i sing i'll have you dance with somebody in the crowd
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:00.320]  well with my torna killies i'm not a very good dancer the secret is
[02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:03.440]  i'm not a good dancer unless i've had a bottle of wine but then i guess you are
[02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:08.400]  ever here shatner talk about uh his play his one person play that he was in
[02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:12.080]  and he said he's on stage and all of a sudden he gets hit
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:18.160]  with the worst stomach ache of his life he had to excuse himself
[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:22.320]  keep in mind he's on stage he's the only person he had to excuse himself
[02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:25.920]  go to the restroom where he was there for about 15 minutes
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:29.680]  and then he came back sure it's a dinner theater in fact those are some of the
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:33.440]  great stories when he was here last year and i went and saw him that he told
[02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:36.960]  and uh it was very interesting boy that's a guy that's got a lot of
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:39.440]  energy in fact i don't want to say it's about years and a thousand times better
[02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:42.960]  because this was pretty good i'm saying it was much much better watching it on
[02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:45.520]  skype than sing shatner in person which i liked
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:49.520]  so that's what i'm saying it really is a good show folks so check that out
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:53.200]  uh now george we we've only got one more segment left and you always let me
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:56.080]  come on your show and you've got a few questions but you let me kind of go
[02:48:56.080 --> 02:49:00.720]  in any direction i want what are you most happy about the world right now
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:04.400]  and what are you most concerned about in the world right now
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:11.040]  i'm concerned primarily about again the complete lack of understanding
[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:17.200]  and respect for human beings yes by government uh they just don't seem to
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:22.080]  hear what i'm happy about is that people are
[02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:26.800]  onto them and that we understand them and by doing so
[02:49:26.800 --> 02:49:31.840]  we're going to continue to fight back uh you know not necessarily and i do not
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:35.520]  advocate violence by any means but we're going to fight back
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:39.600]  at the election booth we're going to fight back on talk shows
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:43.440]  we're going to fight back uh in any way we can
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:47.760]  to keep them from trying to win and i think again in the long run
[02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:51.520]  we're going to win well that's right dinosaur media is dying
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:54.480]  everywhere because it just can't get its mind around ever
[02:49:54.480 --> 02:49:59.840]  questioning or being critical uh and i just can't imagine what the system's
[02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:02.400]  going to do because prior to going before a fall
[02:50:02.400 --> 02:50:06.160]  every indicator shows that the establishment is in deep trouble
[02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:10.240]  uh and it just shows so much arrogance i think it may be a confidence game
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:13.280]  and they're not actually as arrogant as they ask uh you know as they act but
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:16.160]  towards i think you're right though in the final equation
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:20.000]  respect for human life respect for each other believing in humanity
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:23.360]  believing in our greater angels believing we can do better things
[02:50:23.360 --> 02:50:27.760]  that's what builds civilization in the future but this globalist eugenesis
[02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:31.360]  view of we're all crud and humans are a disease and all this
[02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:36.160]  that's what's going to bring in a total nightmare final segment straight ahead
[02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:39.680]  with george norrie will talk more about some of the things happening in the
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:42.640]  election uh his prediction will the republicans take

[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:46.480]  Texan-american citizen on twitter asks what does George think about the recent
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:48.640]  deathbed confession of Lockheed Martin engineer
[02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:51.760]  Boyd Bushman i don't know what what they're talking about maybe you know
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:58.000]  that uh was uh in the area 51 expert uh who claims that indeed there are
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:03.280]  extraterrestrials at area 51 and that he knows that it's an amazing story you
[02:56:03.280 --> 02:56:06.400]  know i haven't been able to authenticate it yet
[02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:10.720]  a lot of times somebody can make up something and uh i don't even know if
[02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:16.320]  Bushman was was a real person from Lockheed but if he was it's an
[02:56:16.320 --> 02:56:21.680]  incredible story of another admission of what's been going on at area 51
[02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:26.560]  a rick so man on twitter asks what does George think about aliens and UFOs
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:29.840]  being a sigh up on the people by the new world order
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:32.960]  no i believe in extraterrestrials this universe is
[02:56:32.960 --> 02:56:37.040]  way too vast to think we're by ourselves i do believe they've come here
[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:40.240]  seated us but i don't think there's the uh
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:43.760]  thing going on with the new world order with that last question mama liberty
[02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:48.320]  1776 on twitter asks do you agree nowhere else to go
[02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:52.560]  that the u.s we must take a stand against current corruption
[02:56:52.560 --> 02:56:55.360]  uh and false authority is there nowhere else to run
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:57:00.480]  there is no place to run so we stay right here and we fix it and we make sure
[02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:03.920]  that it happens well george uh in the last
[02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:07.120]  minute and a half we have left uh want to encourage people to go

[02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:26.720]  think's going to happen in the next few years do you think obama and the
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:30.560]  globalists are going to run wild when he's uh a lame duck and can pardon
[02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:34.320]  himself no i don't think they're going to run
[02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:38.240]  wild you know some people have predicted that there's not going to be an
[02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:43.040]  election in 2016 but there's going to be some catastrophe
[02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:47.200]  where they decide that we can't have an election right now
[02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:51.440]  i'm not you know i'm not going to say no to that that's uh that's a possibility
[02:57:51.440 --> 02:57:57.600]  was it planned um i don't think so but it is it is possible
[02:57:57.600 --> 02:58:01.680]  i think it's unfortunate that these people we elect
[02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:07.600]  uh who start off well intention there's no question about it in my mind i think
[02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:11.440]  all of them have had these ideals of trying to make this
[02:58:11.440 --> 02:58:16.320]  a better country and a better planet and then something happens to them
[02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:20.480]  you know they get tainted they get approached they get changed
[02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:24.560]  and they begin to realize you know oh my gosh you know i gotta play this game
[02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:28.000]  with these leaders and that's what's happening
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:32.400]  um i i think barack obama came into this uh
[02:58:32.400 --> 02:58:36.720]  election backed by people i'll tell you what george

[03:00:24.080 --> 03:00:28.720]  overdrive here with george norrie of coast to coast to him dot com needs no introduction
[03:00:28.720 --> 03:00:33.680]  but george that is the key issue that we have an elite that act like history's
[03:00:33.680 --> 03:00:36.320]  already been won by them that we don't exist
[03:00:36.320 --> 03:00:39.440]  that they don't care how obvious they are how much they lie
[03:00:39.440 --> 03:00:43.600]  it's like they lie on purpose almost to discredit the system
[03:00:43.600 --> 03:00:47.120]  i know that's a communist tactic but it's beyond that but
[03:00:47.120 --> 03:00:50.240]  you were getting into so many people that get into office who are good at first
[03:00:50.240 --> 03:00:53.360]  and get blackmailed get compromised get insulated
[03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:59.040]  get overtaken by a system but at its root it's so sophisticated finish up your
[03:00:59.040 --> 03:01:01.920]  point i don't think they start off being bad people
[03:01:01.920 --> 03:01:05.440]  by any means they think they're all well intentioned i think they have great
[03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:11.280]  ideals of good ideas but once they get in or once they get chosen someone picks
[03:01:11.280 --> 03:01:16.480]  them uh they get changed they get tainted they get i don't want to say bought off
[03:01:16.480 --> 03:01:20.480]  that's not fair but something happens to them and it
[03:01:20.480 --> 03:01:24.000]  happens to all of them i don't know if the power gets to them
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:27.600]  or the elitists get to them but something changes them and i think that
[03:01:27.600 --> 03:01:32.480]  happens with almost every presidential person that gets elected
[03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:36.320]  into office and i think it's happening in this particular case
[03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:40.560]  i think we had a well intentioned person who was
[03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:44.480]  discovered by some folks who said this one's got potential
[03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:50.240]  and they got him elected and uh now the change the metamorphosis has occurred
[03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:53.920]  and uh it's dramatic so the next two years
[03:01:53.920 --> 03:01:57.840]  are going to be very bizarre for us i mean trust me on this that's my
[03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:04.480]  prediction and uh anything i mean anything can happen
[03:02:04.480 --> 03:02:08.240]  well i agree with you i don't ever want to hear people say this is a boring time
[03:02:08.240 --> 03:02:12.160]  or i hear other broadcasters say this is a low news day
