[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:33.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.040 --> 00:38.000]  well we've got another incredibly important worldwide transmission joining
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.280]  us today that is we have Charlie Daniels joining us today in the middle of
[00:43.280 --> 00:48.840]  this important worldwide transmission and I have a splitting headache I would
[00:48.840 --> 00:53.040]  not even be in here I rarely have headaches this bad but I have Charlie
[00:53.040 --> 00:58.400]  Daniels coming up today so I am here and we also have Joel Scalzen popping in
[00:58.400 --> 01:06.720]  dealing with Russia threatens to strike NATO missile defense sites so again very
[01:06.720 --> 01:14.680]  very important transmission lined up for everyone today as you notice the news
[01:14.680 --> 01:20.040]  just gets more and more well revealing that we're in the middle of an extreme
[01:20.040 --> 01:27.320]  global offensive by authoritarian corporate fascist operatives to bring
[01:27.320 --> 01:32.360]  in a ground-level socialist slash communist system to collectivize and
[01:32.360 --> 01:36.840]  destroy private property for the working-in-middle class and concentrate
[01:36.840 --> 01:42.560]  all private property in the hands of the global bankers controlling that
[01:42.560 --> 01:52.960]  collective now as you know I spent almost the entire three hours yesterday
[01:52.960 --> 02:00.240]  covering the article by Paul Joseph Watson that it has a real army document
[02:00.240 --> 02:03.920]  in fact some of the disinfo operatives aren't even denying that it's a real
[02:03.920 --> 02:08.480]  army document because it's been declassified they're simply saying hey
[02:08.480 --> 02:13.760]  what's the big deal with having psi-op officers in domestic camps we need them
[02:13.760 --> 02:18.120]  I thought the camps didn't exist but now well of course I mean the Star
[02:18.120 --> 02:26.000]  Spangled Banner for the land of the FEMA camp and the home of the reeducation
[02:26.000 --> 02:38.640]  center oh say can you see by the dawn's early light the TSA agent has grabbed
[02:38.640 --> 02:44.840]  your five-year-old daughter by the arm she's crying as he groves her he's
[02:44.840 --> 02:53.040]  enjoying the fear get back in line mister or we'll hurt your little dear
[02:53.040 --> 02:58.200]  yes that is our effect I've gotten the Star Spangled Banner and I was just

[03:02.240 --> 03:06.280]  make something up but I'm actually over the weekend I'm going to take the words
[03:06.280 --> 03:10.360]  and actually write a new one usually when I do silly singing and stuff it's
[03:10.360 --> 03:15.840]  totally impromptu but I want to give you the new world order Star Spangled Banner
[03:15.840 --> 03:20.240]  I think it's going to be quite effective I think you should do your own and sing
[03:20.240 --> 03:29.240]  it on YouTube so we can just illustrate how ridiculous all this is so digressing

[08:45.160 --> 08:52.040]  that our flag was still there but it's not still there the globalist have
[08:52.040 --> 08:56.360]  captured the federal government they have captured most states they are
[08:56.360 --> 09:00.320]  openly announcing world government and that the president is under UN command
[09:00.320 --> 09:05.920]  that the Congress is ceremonial and vestigial the entire Bill of Rights and
[09:05.920 --> 09:11.800]  Constitution is being systematically hacked up with a machete in front of all
[09:11.800 --> 09:19.120]  of us and I personally have had enough of it we do have Charlie Daniels who is
[09:19.120 --> 09:23.040]  fighting back for the Second Amendment with Gunners of America with a new film
[09:23.040 --> 09:29.520]  coming out I love Charlie Daniels some of my favorite old-style real country

[09:42.280 --> 09:48.360]  minutes and he's also been speaking out against the Gena 21 in the New World

[09:53.840 --> 09:59.280]  Order so I look forward to having him on with us for the first time
[10:01.280 --> 10:08.760]  that said yesterday we covered this story for the entire three hours and I'm
[10:08.760 --> 10:11.160]  gonna get Joel Scowles and popping in about an hour and a half from now to
[10:11.160 --> 10:15.640]  give us his quick take on that and this other little piece of news I saw this in
[10:15.640 --> 10:22.200]  the Washington Times I went and looked it up in the Russian news and it's true
[10:22.200 --> 10:27.600]  Russia threatens to strike NATO missile defense sites in a meeting with NATO
[10:27.600 --> 10:32.760]  Russian Chief General Staff that's their Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman said fine
[10:32.760 --> 10:36.160]  go ahead and activate those or right before you activate them we're gonna
[10:36.160 --> 10:42.480]  attack them because see that then allows the West to launch a first strike and
[10:42.480 --> 10:44.920]  use the missile defense to shoot down the Russian response that's what they're
[10:44.920 --> 10:49.680]  saying I mean we are not in Kansas anymore I mean the Russians during the
[10:49.680 --> 10:55.680]  Cuban Missile Crisis weren't in 61 62 we're not threatening to attack that was
[10:55.680 --> 11:01.960]  just clearly a option on the table the Russians during 888 back in 08 the
[11:01.960 --> 11:07.600]  attack on Georgia the Russian held areas rolled missiles in and said we're
[11:07.600 --> 11:11.760]  preparing to launch nuclear missiles on NATO forces and NATO pulled out I mean
[11:11.760 --> 11:17.160]  this is just an insane game of brinksmanship and the globalists may
[11:17.160 --> 11:21.240]  think because they've calmed the American people and dominated us and can
[11:21.240 --> 11:24.520]  take the troops death benefits the last 12 years when you die they steal your
[11:24.520 --> 11:28.800]  death benefits that's on record I deal the Fed signed with Prudential and
[11:28.800 --> 11:33.900]  others and they may be able to sign us on to a quadrillion plus in fake
[11:33.900 --> 11:37.440]  derivatives I mean just because the globalists can make 40 to 1 bets and
[11:37.440 --> 11:41.760]  core design can lie before Congress is still billions not getting trouble still
[11:41.760 --> 11:45.720]  you bankers are gonna start a nuclear war and I guess that's why you got all
[11:45.720 --> 11:51.120]  the bunkers built you're doing whatever you can to get the Russians to launch a
[11:51.120 --> 11:55.160]  an attack and I guess you'll just crawl into your bunkers while the rest of us
[11:55.160 --> 12:01.160]  get nuked it's it's it's it's disgusting truly disgusting what these
[12:01.160 --> 12:07.480]  arrogant globalists have done that so that is coming up but here is our top
[12:07.480 --> 12:15.080]  story and you guys do have the weather underground video ready correct okay
[12:15.080 --> 12:20.160]  we're gonna go to that in a moment that's the video that is in this little
[12:20.160 --> 12:26.360]  gem of an article Obama mentor one of the Americans put in re-education
[12:26.360 --> 12:32.720]  camps whether underground terrorists plan to eliminate or kill 25 million
[12:32.720 --> 12:38.000]  US citizens in re-education camps now this was later confirmed in federal
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.720]  court they admitted to this and they were allowed to kill police citizens you
[12:41.720 --> 12:45.400]  name it and it turned out of course Bill Clinton the few they sent to prison
[12:45.400 --> 12:52.440]  Bill Clinton a decade and a half or so later gave them all pardons and Bill
[12:52.440 --> 12:56.720]  Ayers is the guy that helped put Obama through college he lived with him they
[12:56.720 --> 13:01.560]  helped pay for his house let me explain this again the president's main mentor
[13:01.560 --> 13:06.880]  I'm gonna play video this in a moment wanted to take 25 million of you and
[13:06.880 --> 13:13.960]  of course I obviously to torture camps and re-educate us and they thought that
[13:13.960 --> 13:19.520]  well more than 25 million would be taken 25 million would have to be killed
[13:19.520 --> 13:27.280]  well you don't think we're just gonna go along with you when those army trucks
[13:27.280 --> 13:31.440]  pull up do you I mean just because you guys now command our military you you
[13:31.440 --> 13:35.440]  don't just think the military is not gonna figure out what's going on you
[13:35.440 --> 13:39.280]  don't think the police aren't gonna figure out what's going on listen we've
[13:39.280 --> 13:43.560]  got you in check and we're gonna checkmate you scum we're gonna take this
[13:43.560 --> 13:48.360]  country back and we're gonna arrest you and you're gonna get a jury trial and
[13:48.360 --> 13:52.320]  then you're not gonna get eliminated is people who like to kill everybody see
[13:52.320 --> 13:54.960]  the communists always want to get rid of the death penalty in their phase of
[13:54.960 --> 13:59.160]  takeover then they bring it back as soon as they're in command so we're not
[13:59.160 --> 14:02.680]  gonna give you what you want and act like you you'll just spend life in
[14:02.680 --> 14:07.880]  prison how's that sound as an example to everyone but if you ever do start
[14:07.880 --> 14:13.080]  tearing out your killings you will get a jury trial and then you'll get hung by
[14:13.080 --> 14:16.120]  the neck until dead we need to bring that back that's the best way to do it
[14:16.120 --> 14:23.320]  not the lethal injection not any of that I like hanging and we've got Larry
[14:23.320 --> 14:28.160]  graph wall and I want to try to get him on this all came out in federal court
[14:28.160 --> 14:34.480]  this is confirmed this is from a 1982 documentary but my point is people are
[14:34.480 --> 14:38.440]  saying Alex we we saw you play this 10 years ago you saw Glenn Beck play it
[14:38.440 --> 14:42.600]  last year after we played it again I mean this is not new news it's new
[14:42.600 --> 14:48.840]  because you see the military has been given for the first time we know of not
[14:48.840 --> 14:52.600]  plans for civil unrest that's been on the books forever since riots in New York
[14:52.600 --> 14:57.640]  hundreds of years ago 200 years ago this that's one thing one thing if there's a
[14:57.640 --> 15:03.520]  fire or riots or things like that this is taking you to reeducation camps for
[15:03.520 --> 15:08.960]  your political views and let me assure you they're not going to be taking the
[15:08.960 --> 15:13.480]  Leatherman the reeducation camp and they shouldn't there shouldn't be
[15:13.480 --> 15:19.640]  reeducation camps that's right out of linen Stalin Mao North Korea that's the
[15:19.640 --> 15:23.920]  communist model and in the reeducation camps folks they don't really reeducate
[15:23.920 --> 15:27.880]  anybody they they arrest a bunch of people that are on the fence take them
[15:27.880 --> 15:31.840]  in there and torture people they're planning to kill anyways in front of
[15:31.840 --> 15:36.280]  them and then create internal armies that'll go out and rat out and go after
[15:36.280 --> 15:40.480]  whoever they want they have these camps to identify just like they've done at
[15:40.480 --> 15:48.320]  Abu Ghraib in Iraq and Camp X-ray and Camp X inside of X-ray they take a
[15:48.320 --> 15:52.400]  bunch of innocent people most of them below the age of 14 to create the next
[15:52.400 --> 15:56.760]  wave after five six years of the conditioning to lead the new al-Qaeda or
[15:56.760 --> 16:00.480]  to lead the new opposition they release people out of the camps to go infiltrate
[16:00.480 --> 16:07.280]  the resistance the counter revolution they release them out to then go out
[16:07.280 --> 16:12.120]  and infiltrate and try to radicalize and do other things all right so here it
[16:12.120 --> 16:15.680]  is leaked US Army document outlines plan for reeducation camps in America
[16:15.680 --> 16:23.400]  poll Watson countered the shoddy disinformation operatives that tried
[16:23.400 --> 16:28.080]  to claim it didn't affect the US with a screenshot and book note we already had
[16:28.080 --> 16:31.760]  this but in great detail a long article titled yes the reeducation camp
[16:31.760 --> 16:36.080]  manual does apply domestically to US citizens and explains social security
[16:36.080 --> 16:40.880]  numbers how to arrest citizens for their political beliefs how to reeducate the
[16:40.880 --> 16:45.800]  brainwashing the loudspeakers all of it go read it go look at it go check the
[16:45.800 --> 16:49.960]  document and no one's denying the documents real just like in DAA all of
[16:49.960 --> 16:55.520]  it now let's go ahead and start getting to this story that's up on info wars
[16:55.520 --> 17:00.400]  dot com Obama mentor wanted Americans put in reeducation camps it's on the
[17:00.400 --> 17:04.880]  featured news area whether underground terrorists plan to eliminate 25 million
[17:04.880 --> 17:09.440]  US citizens in reeducation camps okay and this all came out in federal court
[17:09.440 --> 17:13.320]  this was admitted he was part of the central committee and we go give the
[17:13.320 --> 17:18.960]  orders to the operatives on the ground by the Ford Foundation funded banker
[17:18.960 --> 17:27.480]  terrorist here is the beginning of that video with Larry graph wall here it is
[17:27.480 --> 17:32.680]  I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the
[17:32.680 --> 17:39.280]  government you know we need become responsible then for administrating you
[17:39.280 --> 17:46.640]  know 250 million people and there was no answers no one had given any thought to
[17:46.640 --> 17:52.400]  economics how are you gonna close and feed these people the only thing that I
[17:52.400 --> 17:56.360]  could get was that they expected that the Cubans and the North Vietnamese and
[17:56.360 --> 18:00.480]  the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy get positive for
[18:00.480 --> 18:06.000]  portions of I first saw this video when locals were airing it in the mid-90s on
[18:06.000 --> 18:12.520]  access and I would have arguments with Kelly and others you don't want his last
[18:12.520 --> 18:15.280]  name shed and I would say they're never gonna bring foreign troops here we'd

[18:18.800 --> 18:22.320]  of military to do this here are the documents and now it's all out in the

[18:50.960 --> 18:54.080]  servers and don't know they're making them public that's and the government
[18:54.080 --> 18:59.200]  confirms that that's that's that's real and this new one was classified but
[18:59.200 --> 19:06.360]  they've now declassified it so that's a conplan 3502 we're gonna come back and
[19:06.360 --> 19:10.760]  play the clip in its entirety I just wanted to stop and you're hearing this
[19:10.760 --> 19:14.440]  and notice when they take over they say they're not worried about the economy

[19:57.480 --> 20:04.400]  right back a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[20:04.400 --> 20:07.880]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my
[20:07.880 --> 20:12.200]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[20:12.200 --> 20:15.520]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[20:15.520 --> 20:20.160]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[20:20.160 --> 20:24.760]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[20:24.760 --> 20:29.520]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[24:23.160 --> 24:28.760]  Obama mentor wanted Americans put in reeducation camps whether underground
[24:28.760 --> 24:33.760]  terrorists planned to eliminate that's killed 25 million US citizens let's
[24:33.760 --> 24:39.760]  let's start that over in reeducation camps and then now we have this 300 plus
[24:39.760 --> 24:48.040]  page document back here it is FM 3-39 dot 40 interment resettlement
[24:48.040 --> 24:53.840]  operations overseas and domestically February 2010 political dissidents for
[24:53.840 --> 25:00.880]  their views in the camps being reeducated in political reeducation
[25:00.880 --> 25:04.640]  camps they even call it reeducation camps I mean this is directly out of
[25:04.640 --> 25:10.520]  North Korea okay get the article that info wars calm like I'm gonna Twitter it
[25:10.520 --> 25:13.960]  out during the next break but let's remind me where the Charlie's about to
[25:13.960 --> 25:16.640]  be on effect I'll be talking to him during the break so one of you guys do
[25:16.640 --> 25:20.040]  that for me just ask her to Twitter it out saying hey Charlie Daniels is coming
[25:20.040 --> 25:23.800]  up thank you at real elections let's go ahead and go to this clip because you
[25:23.800 --> 25:30.240]  should know this is what they have planned and this is the mentor of Obama
[25:30.240 --> 25:40.800]  and this is the head general there in their Communist Politburo here in the
[25:40.800 --> 25:46.000]  US he's the man who would go out and give the orders to the rest of people
[25:46.000 --> 25:51.400]  this was the plan he's in the meetings here it is I brought up the subject of
[25:51.400 --> 25:56.560]  what's going to happen after we take over the government you know we we become
[25:56.560 --> 26:04.160]  responsible then for administrating you know 250 million people and there was no
[26:04.160 --> 26:10.200]  answers no one had given any thought to economics how are you gonna close and
[26:10.200 --> 26:15.000]  feed these people the only thing that I could get was that they expected that
[26:15.000 --> 26:19.400]  the Cubans and the North Vietnamese and the Chinese and the Russians would all
[26:19.400 --> 26:24.840]  want to occupy different portions of the United States they also believed that
[26:24.840 --> 26:28.440]  their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the
[26:28.440 --> 26:34.640]  counter-revolution and they felt that this counter-revolution could best be
[26:34.640 --> 26:40.160]  guarded against by creating an establishing reeducation centers in the
[26:40.160 --> 26:47.160]  Southwest we would take all the people who needed to be reeducated into the
[26:47.160 --> 26:51.240]  new way of thinking and pause and teach back it up 10 seconds we hear that again
[26:51.240 --> 26:55.800]  and then what did Rex 84 years after this film came out and it came out in
[26:55.800 --> 26:59.560]  court under the Reagan administration of course Reagan didn't know what was going
[26:59.560 --> 27:03.680]  on but during his administration the government had this for illegals
[27:03.680 --> 27:07.640]  communist and others so how do you sell the conservatives you tell them it's for
[27:07.640 --> 27:11.680]  the communist but it's really the globalist plan the globalist poses
[27:11.680 --> 27:16.440]  communist as fascist as Muslim extremist but it's always the globalist it's
[27:16.440 --> 27:20.040]  just different tools they're using let's continue where they talk about the
[27:20.040 --> 27:26.800]  extermination in the camps here we go Southwest we would take all the people
[27:26.800 --> 27:33.240]  who needed to be reeducated into the new way of thinking and teach them how
[27:33.240 --> 27:37.880]  things were going to be I ask well what is going to happen to those people that
[27:37.880 --> 27:44.400]  we can't reeducate better die hard cap capitalists and the reply was that they'd
[27:44.400 --> 27:49.600]  have to be eliminated and when I pursued this further they estimated that
[27:49.600 --> 27:55.320]  they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these reeducation centers and
[27:55.320 --> 28:01.080]  when I say eliminate I mean kill 25 million people I want you to imagine
[28:01.080 --> 28:09.560]  sitting in a room with 25 people most of which have graduate degrees from
[28:09.560 --> 28:16.360]  Columbia and other well-known educational centers and hear them
[28:16.360 --> 28:21.880]  figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people and
[28:21.880 --> 28:30.920]  they were dead serious that's from 1982 Larry Grasswall who later became an
[28:30.920 --> 28:37.640]  informant but this all came out in court they admitted their plan to do this and
[28:37.640 --> 28:42.720]  again people accuse us of having headlines that are too hardcore I called
[28:42.720 --> 28:46.400]  Paul up this morning does a great job and I said I want you to change your
[28:46.400 --> 28:53.120]  headline from incarcerate 25 million Americans to eliminate so we change it
[28:53.120 --> 28:57.320]  to eliminate and then I was watching it again he says kill because some people
[28:57.320 --> 29:00.880]  are already arguing what eliminate means so I'm gonna call Watson from the
[29:00.880 --> 29:05.720]  break and go I'm sorry even when I was trying to be more hardcore to show the
[29:05.720 --> 29:10.680]  reality I couldn't deal with this mentally so I whitewashed it in my mind
[29:10.680 --> 29:15.400]  to eliminate he says kill so we'll change that word in the headline to kill
[29:15.400 --> 29:20.680]  or I'm guilty of whitewashing and again people didn't believe the
[29:20.680 --> 29:24.080]  communists would do what they did in Russia or China or or any of these
[29:24.080 --> 29:31.000]  places Latin America communists have killed conservatively you could debate
[29:31.000 --> 29:37.480]  the numbers it's over 150 million I mean it is incredible and they do this they
[29:37.480 --> 29:42.520]  come in and they do it and they mean it and that's what agenda 21 is that's

[34:49.600 --> 34:54.600]  up one morning and after a midnight session of Congress we could be there
[34:54.600 --> 34:59.240]  could be I mean I'm telling what could be done and this is you know 21 is an
[34:59.240 --> 35:05.480]  evil diabolical thing that is global and in scope and everybody's know about it
[35:05.480 --> 35:09.480]  I think people know about it we've been harmed by it. Well you write about it at
[35:09.480 --> 35:13.720]  Charlie Daniels.com tell us about your you know political awakening that's I
[35:13.720 --> 35:18.160]  guess decades old but currently what you're most focused on and let's talk
[35:18.160 --> 35:22.200]  about agenda 21 and why people should be concerned about it. Well let me let me
[35:22.200 --> 35:26.000]  just read a little thing here from agenda 21 the American system of justice
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.880]  must be changed to conform to the rest of the world and there must be a shift
[35:29.880 --> 35:36.000]  in attitudes individual wants needs and desires are be conformed to the views and
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.200]  the dictates of government planners in the process of implementing sustainable
[35:41.200 --> 35:46.040]  development individual rights will have to take a backseat to the collective
[35:46.040 --> 35:50.640]  that's for starters that if that shocks anybody then you should dig a little
[35:50.640 --> 35:54.520]  deeper into this thing and I just gonna look it up don't take my word for it
[35:54.520 --> 35:58.520]  that does just go look it up it's just the information that's been pretty bold
[35:58.520 --> 36:02.640]  about it I will say that and information is readily available on the internet
[36:02.640 --> 36:10.000]  this is a this is a thing that you know I mean it goes on into no individual
[36:10.000 --> 36:15.960]  ownership of property I heard a thing the other day I raised I raised
[36:15.960 --> 36:21.160]  arm animals I raised cows and horses and there's a there was a bill that passed
[36:21.160 --> 36:24.840]  to I didn't know what it passed time but it was called the Food Protection Act
[36:24.840 --> 36:30.800]  that might have been the exact yeah the food safety act food safety act right
[36:30.800 --> 36:35.840]  and I called we are two senators I called it was in Senate time and I call
[36:35.840 --> 36:40.640]  Senator Mar-Alexander's office and I call Senator Corker's office and I said
[36:40.640 --> 36:43.520]  I asked each other I of course I don't even one of them but I thought they're
[36:43.520 --> 36:47.760]  great and I asked a guy it had already I didn't know I thought it was on the
[36:47.760 --> 36:53.400]  floor it had passed Senator Alexander had voted for it I call Senator Corker's
[36:53.400 --> 36:57.040]  and I asked a guy I said what about the small fire oh Senator Alexander would
[36:57.040 --> 37:01.280]  never do anything hurt her farmers call Senator Corker's office well Senator
[37:01.280 --> 37:06.520]  Corker voted against it now you know what what's the deal here if it's good
[37:06.520 --> 37:10.600]  for the state of Tennessee why would one senator vote for it and one vote against
[37:10.600 --> 37:15.920]  it the thing about to me is this and what people don't realize there's been
[37:15.920 --> 37:20.600]  has to be brought home to people you say okay if it's you know things go south
[37:20.600 --> 37:24.560]  I got a acre of ground I go in and plant a garden I'll get me a cow a couple of
[37:24.560 --> 37:30.440]  pigs and chickens no you won't because under the Food Protection Act they
[37:30.440 --> 37:34.640]  could come in and say you can't grow anything because you're spreading bad
[37:34.640 --> 37:38.680]  stuff into the food supply I saw a thing the other day about mad cat is the
[37:38.680 --> 37:44.640]  cat in California it's coming okay you're you're endangering the health of
[37:44.640 --> 37:47.760]  all the animals in the country by your animals so you can't grow your animals
[37:47.760 --> 37:54.280]  anymore that's that's cat sounds very very far-fetched but that is the scope
[37:54.280 --> 38:01.160]  of agenda 21 agenda 21 wants to reduce the population of the planet earth by
[38:01.160 --> 38:07.720]  some I'm afraid even say it because I it really makes me sound crazy but some
[38:07.720 --> 38:13.120]  tremendous event earth is God to these people and they're you know we're
[38:13.120 --> 38:19.240]  mistreating the earth as evil human beings the Bible says God gave you know
[38:19.240 --> 38:26.760]  he gave this earth demand to just subdue and animals on it put everything on it
[38:26.760 --> 38:31.720]  and it's earth is not God I love the earth I'm a very earthy sort of person
[38:31.720 --> 38:37.320]  but it is not my God it is not a God it does have any power and we have
[38:37.320 --> 38:42.240]  mistreated it I know we've mistreated but it's the earth is perfectly capable of
[38:42.240 --> 38:46.560]  repurposing itself I was about to say Charlie but Charlie Daniels our guest
[38:46.560 --> 38:50.200]  they don't care about the environment these globalists they've got a lot of
[38:50.200 --> 38:53.280]  people that that follow them that do that are misguided it's all about a
[38:53.280 --> 38:58.760]  power grab under agenda 21 go Obama can shut down cold power plants that his
[38:58.760 --> 39:02.320]  buddies don't own and he's done it and then that makes a general electric and
[39:02.320 --> 39:06.680]  others who by the way are tax exempt under this fraud they make giant profits
[39:06.680 --> 39:10.240]  it's about monopolies and when you talk about the food safety act you're right
[39:10.240 --> 39:15.200]  big pharma and big agro wrote it to shut down family farms I mean look at them
[39:15.200 --> 39:18.640]  going after the Amish I'm just backing you up here Charlie look at them going
[39:18.640 --> 39:22.960]  after people with lemonade stands look at them going after gardens the system
[39:22.960 --> 39:27.760]  does not want us self-sufficient well you know the next move is gonna be don't
[39:27.760 --> 39:33.240]  you it's gonna be coming up to your guns oh yeah there is something up here right
[39:33.240 --> 39:36.520]  now I don't know what it is but there's something and the one thing you're
[39:36.520 --> 39:42.280]  really scares me is the fact that we are one Supreme Court justice away from
[39:42.280 --> 39:47.640]  Obama doing just about any damn thing he wants to do I mean if you can't get it
[39:47.640 --> 39:50.960]  through the Congress the Congress and say it would never have enough just
[39:50.960 --> 39:54.160]  try to take people's guns away from them they would not do it they know it would
[39:54.160 --> 39:58.800]  be political suicide but if it's done through the Supreme Court it becomes a
[39:58.800 --> 40:03.440]  law of the land I tell you they don't sit well down my way at all it ain't gonna
[40:03.440 --> 40:07.760]  sit well but if they come out and people say well I will not give them my gun to
[40:07.760 --> 40:13.120]  take about one or two ruby ridges and wait goes to convince people hey it
[40:13.120 --> 40:17.240]  ain't worth it you know and that's that's how deepest thing goes it's you
[40:17.240 --> 40:23.120]  know it's it's scared to heck out of me that's I'm 75 years old you know I mean
[40:23.120 --> 40:26.880]  I don't know probably see this stuff implemented or not but I got a kid and I
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.120]  got grandkids and I don't want to see them live in a world that big brother
[40:31.120 --> 40:35.120]  runs and you got to worry about some Nazi type and so become knocking on the
[40:35.120 --> 40:38.560]  door in the middle of the night and they give you the task about some opinion
[40:38.560 --> 40:45.120]  that you have a hate crime a bit yet to me what is a hate crime I mean you know
[40:45.120 --> 40:50.800]  if you kill somebody you must hate them exactly kill somebody if you hate
[40:50.800 --> 40:54.680]  somebody it's a hate crime you kill them twice what is it you know what's the
[40:54.680 --> 41:00.560]  difference so yeah this stuff is these little things in this Obamacare thing
[41:00.560 --> 41:05.720]  that was passed we have a congressman named Bart Gordon in Tennessee that he
[41:05.720 --> 41:11.280]  was not gonna run again he voted against he voted for the Obamacare knowing
[41:11.280 --> 41:16.600]  that his constituency did not want it he had disappeared nobody even knows where
[41:16.600 --> 41:20.200]  he's at I tried to call him out he owes it to people who put him in office to
[41:20.200 --> 41:24.720]  come out and tell us why he voted for it and now we see Obama Charlie Daniels as
[41:24.720 --> 41:28.760]  our guest right now giving 2,000 plus companies waivers so again his
[41:28.760 --> 41:32.240]  buddies get waivers from what he does that's total discrimination but going
[41:32.240 --> 41:35.800]  back to second amendment as you know I know you're a big supporter of them the
[41:35.800 --> 41:41.160]  NRA and they're usually pretty you know conservative about what they say they
[41:41.160 --> 41:44.800]  have the intel the Washington Times reported on this last year that in his
[41:44.800 --> 41:50.240]  second term he is gonna try to ban semi-autos and then we got documents that
[41:50.240 --> 41:55.480]  he told the Brady campaign don't worry I'm gonna do it quote under the radar and
[41:55.480 --> 41:58.880]  remember that tape that got recorded he'd know people have where he said
[41:58.880 --> 42:04.600]  yeah these Bible hugging you know gun hugging a bitter clingers and so
[42:04.600 --> 42:09.320]  absolutely sir they are coming after our guns what about fast and furious
[42:09.320 --> 42:14.800]  where Obama ship guns into Mexico and CBS got the memos to blame the second
[42:14.800 --> 42:21.320]  amendment well you know I think Eric Holder for the two things he should have
[42:21.320 --> 42:25.840]  been even if he did that he should be appeased and run out of office he didn't know about it if
[42:25.840 --> 42:29.480]  he didn't he should be run out for incompetence how do you cross all guns
[42:29.480 --> 42:35.160]  into a sovereign nation across international borders and nobody knows
[42:35.160 --> 42:39.040]  about it except the peons that work in the bank now just tell me how did how do
[42:39.040 --> 42:44.120]  you do that if the bottom administration is that incompetent if they can do that
[42:44.120 --> 42:48.680]  if they can carry guns across state lines I mean across in the international
[42:48.680 --> 42:52.320]  borders and give them to people or I mean in essence that's what happened it's
[42:52.320 --> 42:56.960]  not that didn't actually care about their self I mean once and you don't know
[42:56.960 --> 43:00.080]  about it it's going on in your department where you fire everybody in your
[43:00.080 --> 43:05.000]  department if you know but that's got to do about it he had to know about it
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.120]  there's no way Holder didn't know about that thing I don't care what he said and
[43:08.120 --> 43:11.280]  I honestly and I will accuse me of lying if he says you don't know anything about
[43:11.280 --> 43:15.240]  it he knew it he knew that early on he didn't do anything about it he's such
[43:15.240 --> 43:19.120]  an arrogant SOB that he thinks that anything he does he can get away with
[43:19.120 --> 43:25.040]  and you know this is just any other administration would have fired him two
[43:25.040 --> 43:29.920]  years ago and he this guy's wreaking havoc with America he's wreaking
[43:29.920 --> 43:38.640]  havoc in Arizona people knew what was going on Arizona I met the family of a
[43:38.640 --> 43:44.120]  rancher a third generation or so rancher in Texas who was killed by people
[43:44.120 --> 43:49.280]  coming across the border I mean this is a family it's a good American family
[43:49.280 --> 43:53.280]  they've been to make a good honest living off the land and are good people
[43:53.280 --> 43:57.200]  and there's father and their husband have been killed by these people who come
[43:57.200 --> 44:02.920]  across the border this is what's happening in all along the border you
[44:02.920 --> 44:08.080]  don't care about it but every time somebody comes across some of these
[44:08.080 --> 44:12.120]  people come across certainly they come across there's one like a living okay
[44:12.120 --> 44:16.480]  you want to make a living you want to go do it like everybody my people did
[44:16.480 --> 44:19.880]  when it came over from Ireland and other people when it came to Germany and
[44:19.880 --> 44:24.520]  Israel and all these places that I'm a grader here why just because they live
[44:24.520 --> 44:28.520]  next to us people in Canada can't do that people in Canada can't walk walk
[44:28.520 --> 44:34.840]  across the border this is so bad going totally political and so basic spending
[44:34.840 --> 44:41.000]  and so you know contingency thing that we well we get as many voters we get
[44:41.000 --> 44:47.920]  what tell me something how can you go into bank and cash a check and it can
[44:47.920 --> 44:52.280]  make you put out a picture ID I can't get your plane without put the picture ID
[44:52.280 --> 44:56.760]  I can't vote in my state and they know who I am I vote the same polls all the
[44:56.760 --> 45:00.680]  time but you got to present that ID before they won't let you vote and you
[45:00.680 --> 45:04.320]  mean to tell me that it's right to let people go vote we don't even know if
[45:04.320 --> 45:08.080]  their citizens well Charlie as you know all over the country right here in
[45:08.080 --> 45:11.680]  Austin they let the illegals basically vote they let him get bank accounts with
[45:11.680 --> 45:16.240]  no ID but I've got to go show three sometimes at my bank the point is is
[45:16.240 --> 45:20.720]  that the government elite are on top the illegals are second citizens are
[45:20.720 --> 45:25.640]  third-class and the government just ignores laws whenever they want it's
[45:25.640 --> 45:30.040]  totally lawless this is globalism now talking about agenda 21 in this whole
[45:30.040 --> 45:34.240]  world government situation I'm seeing a huge awakening Arizona's on the verge
[45:34.240 --> 45:38.440]  of passing it another state has passed a law against it other states are passing
[45:38.440 --> 45:43.000]  laws against the NDA a to secretly arrest Americans it does look like there
[45:43.000 --> 45:46.920]  is an awakening happening and to go back to that song you had about you know
[45:46.920 --> 45:51.480]  America waking up and getting you know together it again you know we damn sure
[45:51.480 --> 45:57.360]  fooled you I think we're on the cusp of another big awakening I certainly hope
[45:57.360 --> 46:01.840]  you're right I'll be right I was I was at the bottom actually a prayer you know
[46:01.840 --> 46:05.200]  yesterday I was making speeches I want a big thing I was talking about the
[46:05.200 --> 46:10.120]  further away we get in God the more lost we get and I mean it's just a it's the
[46:10.120 --> 46:17.480]  absolute fact that in and this thing of being upset when you see across
[46:17.480 --> 46:22.480]  somewhere or something in this little handful of people I want to remove you
[46:22.480 --> 46:27.200]  know they'll tell you these people will tell you now just rank about citizens
[46:27.200 --> 46:30.280]  well this constitutional separation church and state it's not in the
[46:30.280 --> 46:34.360]  Constitution it says nothing about separation churches that he says
[46:34.360 --> 46:39.600]  Congress shall pass no law concerning religion that's right Congress can make
[46:39.600 --> 46:43.160]  no law and they take a letter from Thomas Jefferson saying he didn't want
[46:43.160 --> 46:47.520]  to have one church a one state religion and they twist it so instead the
[46:47.520 --> 46:51.280]  government runs a religion and they say that's the Constitution when that's the
[46:51.280 --> 46:56.520]  opposite government cannot touch it cannot do anything zero Congress will
[46:56.520 --> 46:59.600]  make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
[46:59.600 --> 47:04.800]  exercise thereof Charlie Daniels you are absolutely on target well you know
[47:04.800 --> 47:08.920]  that that part of the law and the Constitution was to protect the church
[47:08.920 --> 47:13.040]  from the from the government not the government from the church and it was
[47:13.040 --> 47:18.080]  all twisted around but you know if we start talking about you know things that
[47:18.080 --> 47:22.720]  offend you I think that's all time it's been me but I'm not gonna go out and do
[47:22.720 --> 47:26.480]  a protest about it because I you know I don't I don't like it if other people
[47:26.480 --> 47:30.720]  you know have but loot pictures up and that sort of thing I don't have to look
[47:30.720 --> 47:34.760]  at I want I want read by it don't bother me I can't do the same thing with the
[47:34.760 --> 47:39.320]  cross it's like these people just go around and look for little things that
[47:39.320 --> 47:43.840]  and what the situation is it's not separation of church and state it's
[47:43.840 --> 47:48.680]  separation of God and state that's what they want to do well sir as you know they
[47:48.680 --> 47:52.360]  want to replace it with this fake environmentalism as in 21 they admit in
[47:52.360 --> 47:56.280]  the UN they want a global religion they said that at the last big UN summit
[47:56.280 --> 48:02.400]  that Lord Moncton and others that were there saw and got the documents on this
[48:02.400 --> 48:07.080]  is a cult and you notice it's just Christianity they're even telling people
[48:07.080 --> 48:12.000]  not to wear shirts with a cross on it in the mall now it's an idea that you
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.240]  don't have freedom of speech in this country we have freedom of speech in
[48:16.240 --> 48:20.320]  this country I will wear it that blame thing I'm pleased to you know I mean
[48:20.320 --> 48:24.680]  that's just a situation no I hold people that people listening people don't be
[48:24.680 --> 48:29.320]  intimidated don't be intimidated by this stuff that that a biggest part of
[48:29.320 --> 48:32.480]  these things that you're hearing are not law they're not law in this country
[48:32.480 --> 48:38.200]  separation of church and state is not law it's not constitutional this thing
[48:38.200 --> 48:43.040]  agenda 21 that we're talking about please don't take my word for it I don't
[48:43.040 --> 48:47.480]  want you to take my word for it I want you to believe it so go look it up on
[48:47.480 --> 48:52.200]  your internet go check it for yourself it is very real it's been going on since
[48:52.200 --> 48:57.400]  back in the 70s some of the most powerful people in the world are connected
[48:57.400 --> 49:03.160]  to it and endorsing it and promoting it and the UN which in my book should be
[49:03.160 --> 49:06.600]  the building should be pushed into the East River returned into homeless hotel
[49:06.600 --> 49:11.760]  and running people out of here then go to Paris it's just a toothless debating
[49:11.760 --> 49:17.280]  society anti-American debating society I should say you imagine you the idiots
[49:17.280 --> 49:22.600]  running anything they can't find their way to the bathroom and I want to run they
[49:22.600 --> 49:26.560]  want to take over our national parks they want to say what we can do with our
[49:26.560 --> 49:30.840]  food chain what kind of animals we can raise and this sort of thing it ain't
[49:30.840 --> 49:37.200]  just like you said a while ago this is total paragraph total control expanding
[49:37.200 --> 49:45.640]  on that break down what you cover in the film behold a pale horse well this

[54:21.480 --> 54:25.320]  cracks just like Aaron Russo tried to get me in america freedom to fascism I
[54:25.320 --> 54:29.720]  have got to start being in these films but it doesn't matter I haven't seen it

[54:34.640 --> 54:38.000]  it out there or or behold a pale horse charlie daniels and not confuse it with
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.320]  the book that's out there by william cooper and I can't wait to see it and

[54:58.000 --> 55:05.480]  this Friday edition 800-259-9231 to talk to the legendary charlie daniels doesn't
[55:05.480 --> 55:09.640]  get any more country than that doesn't get any better fiddling than that and he
[55:09.640 --> 55:13.520]  joins us again right now briefly getting back into behold a pale horse then
[55:13.520 --> 55:17.120]  I've got a question for you about where you see this country going in the future
[55:17.120 --> 55:24.080]  charlie daniels a lot of that depends on you know what happens in this next
[55:24.080 --> 55:31.040]  election in my opinion I personally thank you obama gets elected again and
[55:31.040 --> 55:35.320]  gets any kind of unless the other side gets and I'm not a republican or
[55:35.320 --> 55:40.480]  democrat I don't claim a leadership party I just can't see I can't see any
[55:40.480 --> 55:44.760]  good coming out of it if you stop and figure you cannot get out of debt by
[55:44.760 --> 55:49.280]  spending money and instead it's got to be tackled at some time or other our
[55:49.280 --> 55:52.280]  entitlement thing has to be tackled at one time or another the country's just
[55:52.280 --> 55:57.240]  going to go broke and you know this we got to see what happens and it and
[55:57.240 --> 56:01.440]  hopefully make some gains and and build on on that but the whole thing about it
[56:01.440 --> 56:04.280]  is it like I said that you know the brother would get away from God the
[56:04.280 --> 56:08.800]  worst off this country gets and I just that was a national day of prairie as
[56:08.800 --> 56:12.040]  the day and a lot of millions of people around the country they were praying for
[56:12.040 --> 56:16.560]  you know for God to intervene and help us get back on the right path there so
[56:16.560 --> 56:21.240]  that's the main thing and I don't say any good come out of another Obama
[56:21.240 --> 56:25.640]  administration I'm sorry I don't hate the man I don't hate anybody but I just
[56:25.640 --> 56:34.720]  what I do not see his policy working at all well look Obama has openly said he
[56:34.720 --> 56:38.520]  wants a world government and he doesn't believe in individual liberty he is a
[56:38.520 --> 56:43.880]  tyrant and I look at now a leaked army document Obama had him set up a plan for
[56:43.880 --> 56:47.760]  reeducation camps in America and this just broke yesterday so you probably
[56:47.760 --> 56:53.920]  haven't seen it but then I have this video breaking down Bill Ayers who was
[56:53.920 --> 56:57.080]  for reeducation camps that came out in the federal court and he of course was
[56:57.080 --> 57:01.360]  was Obama's mentor but to learn that they're trying to get the army and that's
[57:01.360 --> 57:05.400]  why this leaked the army doesn't like it to prepare to basically round up
[57:05.400 --> 57:11.360]  political dissenters that means us and reeducate us boy I tell you this is what
[57:11.360 --> 57:13.600]  do you think of that if it's true Charlie I know you haven't had a chance to
[57:13.600 --> 57:18.200]  see it yet I think it's gonna be a hell of a war in this country exactly what I
[57:18.200 --> 57:23.160]  think I you know you can't stand still for this there's no way you can stand
[57:23.160 --> 57:26.000]  still there's gonna come that's what I was talking about the midnight knock on
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.720]  the door what's the difference between here and in Soviet Union if we do that
[57:30.720 --> 57:34.840]  that's what they do in China that's what they do in North Korea that's what they
[57:34.840 --> 57:39.240]  did in Soviet Union but your iron curtain day that is not America that we
[57:39.240 --> 57:45.000]  cannot allow that happen in America and anybody who promotes that Obama holder
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.280]  whoever needs to be gone they're not to be in need to be in any position of power
[57:49.280 --> 57:54.840]  at all that's what we've got to do somehow we have got to get away from
[57:54.840 --> 57:59.280]  these these people in the society sir but we're about to go to break there is
[57:59.280 --> 58:03.680]  some good news a record numbers of guns are being sold five million in one month
[58:03.680 --> 58:07.840]  a few months ago the American people say it's because they don't trust this
[58:07.840 --> 58:12.280]  president in this government so I think the system needs to understand that well
[58:12.280 --> 58:16.600]  I think we need to understand it too and I'll tell you what if anything to do with
[58:16.600 --> 58:21.320]  guns ain't go well I live in Tennessee and people treasured guns there and you
[58:21.320 --> 58:25.520]  know I mean for hunting and target shooting and protection but it ain't
[58:25.520 --> 58:30.640]  gonna go well my party's under at all it's not gonna go down good yeah we know

[1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:34.960]  can be off the races and he said oh you know how true that is I'm playing the
[1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:40.120]  Kentucky Derby this weekend okay let's let's go to some phone calls here
[1:00:40.120 --> 1:00:45.920]  Jonathan Michael John Patriot Richard and others Jonathan and Texas you're on
[1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:51.560]  the air with Charlie Daniels yes sir this is glad to speak with you Charlie
[1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:57.800]  Daniels this is that Fox 777 and I was wondering can you by chance assemble a
[1:00:57.800 --> 1:01:04.680]  cast a thing about agenda 21 similar to like they did with we are the world
[1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:09.200]  we listen he's the guy that did the song that that in America oh I love that
[1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:13.800]  song and then I mean so many other patriotic ones yeah we saw that new
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:20.280]  song that came out by Hank Williams Jr. telling Obama where he can go for getting
[1:01:20.280 --> 1:01:24.480]  him fired what about you doing something like that well you know I kind of take
[1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:28.480]  it as it comes I guess I get these inspirations to write songs I don't
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:32.560]  that was a unique idea that you came up with there Jonathan I hadn't really
[1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:38.560]  thought about it in that way I am very much I won't so bad and what we're
[1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:42.400]  doing now is good is to let people know a lot of people don't know this thing
[1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:46.880]  even exists they have to know what it exists they have to know what's in it
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:52.320]  and I believe when they do we will see some bad people in this country you could
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:56.120]  have a song about get your 21 out of here or you're gonna get a 21 gun salute
[1:01:56.120 --> 1:02:02.920]  that's right that's right that's probably what happened to oh man yeah thank
[1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:08.680]  you Jonathan man Michael in Texas you're on the air go ahead don't yeah
[1:02:08.680 --> 1:02:13.800]  gentlemen it's a pleasure speaking to you hey yes sir big big fan of yours big
[1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:17.760]  fan of yours and you know what you probably hear my Yankee accent I've only
[1:02:17.760 --> 1:02:21.320]  been down here in Texas for a few years but it's the best thing that ever
[1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:26.040]  happened to me this job transfer but the thing that and I'm asking if you've
[1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:31.520]  seen this even in your state people that you know all they care about probably is
[1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:37.520]  volunteer football and you know dancing with the stars or even on you know CMT
[1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:41.640]  they'll watch them that version of yeah but there's always people I want his
[1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:44.400]  answer to this but there's always people that don't care it's always been a
[1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:50.280]  minority that actually fights for liberty just like in 1776 Charlie yeah
[1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:56.120]  I think you know that's true but if it's a fair enough a minority you get the
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:03:00.800]  majority's attention you know the people don't realize this thing I didn't I was
[1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:04.520]  unaware of the scope of this thing myself but it's true a while ago I didn't
[1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:08.800]  I didn't you know I've been hearing about this global thing going on for a
[1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:11.880]  long time but they get down and get specific about it they've now put a lot
[1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:17.040]  of it in writing as to what exactly who showed you the proof who showed you the
[1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:21.560]  proof and turn Charlie Daniels loose looks up on the internet I mean it's
[1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:25.160]  there it's not free to look you know I know but I mean I'm interested in who
[1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:28.600]  what who got you to look because this is what you're talking about we've got to
[1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:33.280]  give people the facts well they got me specifically on agenda 21 was Chuck
[1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:37.360]  undersea who did this movie because he's really delved into it he's talked to
[1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:41.920]  people that are very familiar with what it is but this document is beyond the
[1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:47.680]  pale horse goes into this whole situation it names names it names the
[1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:52.960]  genders it names what has happened how far we have come along on how far down
[1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:58.480]  the trail we are and some people who explain from their point of view that
[1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:03.480]  the general names list nine right now I can't remember he was ahead of the
[1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:09.800]  special forces this is a man who has the credentials behind him that is a great
[1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:16.320]  great American who explains what has happened in this nation in so far as he
[1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:20.880]  was social was concerned the steps that were taken in other places where
[1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:25.160]  socialism took a hold the steps that they took what they did how they went in
[1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:30.120]  how they started and it goes through this whole thing and he extends their
[1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:34.520]  inexplainance and you believe him because he's telling the truth he is a
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:38.000]  man with the credentials behind him to know what he's talking about well said

[1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:37.040]  that you'd like to relay to the population well just you know the the
[1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:43.200]  thing about yesterday I'm able to put you good folks and we talked about it

[1:09:58.160 --> 1:10:02.960]  thing at the end it and just just stay with it I stand up for what you believe
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:06.160]  in that's the name of the game well there's a reason the globalist and the
[1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:08.960]  communists and the socialists and the collectivists are always trying to
[1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:13.280]  hin pack us into shutting up because we've got the power free market
[1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:18.760]  capitalism liberty private property family god country that trumps the crap
[1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:23.200]  I'm sorry to use that word they're shelling and and so they want to shut us
[1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:26.920]  up you're right absolutely and we don't shut up

[1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:39.200]  on the air with Charlie Daniels welcome good to speak with you again Alex yes
[1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:47.560]  sir hi Richard ah how you doing Charlie I'm well thank you my question to you is
[1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:53.400]  upon reading the undercover of darkness staining of for example the National
[1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:58.840]  Defense Authorization Act if upon reading that you got the exact same sort of
[1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:03.240]  red flag feeling that a lot of us got thinking this is a family for us not for
[1:11:03.240 --> 1:11:05.040]  other countries yeah let me put it this way
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:10.480]  Obama now says the war on terrorists over overseas and Al Qaeda's good going
[1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:14.800]  after Libya and there are friend now and then Wadden's dead but then he says
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:19.960]  we're gonna expand the TSA now they have checkpoints in Texas Indian Houston and
[1:11:19.960 --> 1:11:24.000]  Dallas where they grow up your wife and your family and your children so so now
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  they're telling us the war on terror is for the returning veterans and gun owners
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:33.600]  and libertarians I don't know if you saw those Homeland Security documents I did
[1:11:33.600 --> 1:11:38.800]  hear about that I that is just a day blames disgrace I mean that yes you
[1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:42.480]  you know I get you want to get my blood blown you start messing with that
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:48.240]  military would with the with with the veterans they are without them there is
[1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:53.520]  no us and I have been among these people in the last few years our men women
[1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:56.800]  uniform in in some pretty desperate parts of this world I want to tell you
[1:11:56.800 --> 1:12:00.960]  what they're the best we've got the best we got is not on Capitol Hill the best
[1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:05.640]  we've got is in the in the uniform of the United States military they're the
[1:12:05.640 --> 1:12:09.760]  best Americans we got and when I see somebody messing with them it just makes
[1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:15.200]  my it really gets my finger up higher people who are returning from our wars
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:19.480]  are heroes and should be treated as heroes and to even for anybody to even
[1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:23.560]  have the arrogance of accusing them after they've gone and put their lives on
[1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:27.160]  the line for this country and somebody comes along and accuses them of being a
[1:12:27.160 --> 1:12:32.760]  terrorist come on man well the bar well the person doing that is obviously the
[1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:37.120]  un-American terrorist but but that shows they want to bring in this agenda 21
[1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:41.080]  they are scared in these documents my act of Homeland Security it's made big
[1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:45.040]  news if you're a new looser folks this is real gun owners libertarians
[1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:50.080]  conservatives constitutionalists but number one returning veterans they're
[1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:55.800]  teaching police that they're the biggest terror threat well I just that's just
[1:12:55.800 --> 1:13:00.760]  yes man that's just crazy you know let me tell you something America is not
[1:13:00.760 --> 1:13:06.720]  stupid I mean I guarantee how many people are gonna believe that that sounds
[1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:11.280]  like something out of a fictional novel some kind that are returning veterans
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:16.640]  are terrorists come on nobody's gonna believe that nobody does believe that's
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:20.120]  about corsage that there's people that are just sheep that are led around by the
[1:13:20.120 --> 1:13:25.160]  doesn't believe anything you're told but people to get up and go to work in the
[1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:28.000]  morning to make a living for their family good God-fearing people are not
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:31.480]  gonna believe that they know that's a bunch of BS the only people that would
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:35.720]  say something like that are people that want to overthrow this country they
[1:13:35.720 --> 1:13:39.640]  come in and say constitutionalist and libertarians and conservatives and
[1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:44.240]  veterans are bad that's what you'd expect you know in the 70s of the Russians
[1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:49.600]  took over exactly well it ain't gonna work we can't let it work there's too
[1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:53.240]  many people out there man it's too many I see too many good people every day they
[1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:57.680]  go swallow this do you agree Charlie that's just me about educating people
[1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:01.520]  about this thing please people if you're listening to me don't take my word for
[1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:05.800]  it don't take Alex's word for it don't take anybody's word for it prove it to
[1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:10.280]  yourself for the sake of your children and your grandchildren and yourself and

[1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:27.000]  John in Texas we got to move quick here we're running out of time with Charlie
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:32.920]  Daniels go ahead hi Alex hello Charlie actually on basically we're all
[1:14:32.920 --> 1:14:36.960]  we're in the Soviet system right now it's just soft core because they're
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:40.880]  because of the Second Amendment they can't really get rough so they're
[1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:45.280]  trying to implement it slowly in spots where they can but the key to all this
[1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:49.760]  is the Second Amendment once the guns are gone the velvet glove comes off and
[1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:52.880]  iron fit to come down and we'll be in a red terror that the world will never see
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:58.480]  amen amen you're right we can't let that happen that's the thing I think about
[1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:02.200]  you know that what scares me more so than anything else about this is one
[1:15:02.200 --> 1:15:06.920]  more Supreme Court justice button think about it you've got the soda Meyer my
[1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:10.720]  y'all are and you've got Elena Kagan Elena Kagan should not even be on the
[1:15:10.720 --> 1:15:16.240]  Supreme Court start with she's been she's she helped write the health care law
[1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:20.760]  and it's now gonna rule on it that's illegal yes she should have been
[1:15:20.760 --> 1:15:26.040]  refused she refused she refused herself we've got our Constitution is being
[1:15:26.040 --> 1:15:31.800]  trampled on by this government and this administration Charlie what do you make
[1:15:31.800 --> 1:15:35.880]  your cast Sunstein since you said that cast Sunstein is the guy they've got
[1:15:35.880 --> 1:15:40.960]  lined up Obama says that'll be his next nominee cast Sunstein has said I'm not
[1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:44.960]  kidding pull this up I can't believe it he said it he wrote papers five years
[1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:49.600]  ago four years ago saying arrest people that don't agree with man-made global
[1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:53.440]  warming or at least find them he is a total authoritarian and that's who
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:58.520]  Obama wants then they got to come get me because I think man make love warm I
[1:15:58.520 --> 1:16:02.840]  don't think man I'd man can't control the climate of this kind of this world
[1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:08.120]  that is stupid if this world is changing as God's doing it's not ours if it's a
[1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:12.160]  woman it's God's doing it's not man's doing we can't do it we can't control it
[1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:16.800]  and you know we that's just that's just never a stupid anybody that has those
[1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:20.480]  kind of preconceptions should not even be allowed to go into Supreme Court
[1:16:20.480 --> 1:16:24.240]  building much less serve on the Supreme Court and that's what I'm talking about
[1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:28.800]  that's where if we aren't careful Obama's big power is going to come from is
[1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:32.800]  from the Supreme Court and then Congress and sit back and say well we didn't do
[1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:38.000]  it well yeah you did you sit back and let it happen amazing part of these idiots
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:43.680]  Charlie Daniels is our guest thank you so much John Patriot in Michigan you're

[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:03.720]  tidbit Alex I'd like to say thank you all of you we have started speaking out

[1:17:07.680 --> 1:17:14.160]  patreon.spot.wallfm it's got a ton of Alex John Chan full of agenda 21 good job
[1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:18.320]  buddy we appreciate you tell us if you got a question for Charlie yes Charlie
[1:17:18.320 --> 1:17:27.960]  um what what do you think we should do in in basically in response to the NDA a
[1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:34.440]  response to the what now the National Defense Authorization Act on the NDA
[1:17:34.440 --> 1:17:41.240]  um yeah what do you make of Obama me or him no I mean what do you make of
[1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:44.160]  Obama just to be clear with NDA a you know that's where he says he'll arrest
[1:17:44.160 --> 1:17:48.200]  citizens and disappear him if he wants I think you ought to call your congressman
[1:17:48.200 --> 1:17:51.760]  your senator Ray Hale with him tell me I can't come back to state if any of
[1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:54.920]  something like this happens but that's that's the danger again the Supreme
[1:17:54.920 --> 1:17:58.560]  Court since you're quite sick don't ever get that through Congress there's no way
[1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:02.400]  they'll ever get it through Congress but you wait for the Supreme I mean that
[1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:06.160]  that's that's what scares me that right now is one of my biggest fears in this
[1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:12.000]  country is the Supreme Court passing something and the are the Congress you
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:16.240]  know there's when you don't read bills if you can't read bills you have a
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:19.640]  business up are you both for stuff you don't even want the heck it is that's
[1:18:19.640 --> 1:18:24.960]  stupid that's not America that's not what they're there for we need to get
[1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:29.200]  squared away here we need to get we need people who are going to support our
[1:18:29.200 --> 1:18:33.160]  Constitution and people who are going to support Supreme Court justices that are
[1:18:33.160 --> 1:18:38.360]  not left so far in one direction that they can't possibly think is right way
[1:18:38.360 --> 1:18:42.760]  to rule right on things this thing about arresting people they go happen we
[1:18:42.760 --> 1:18:46.800]  can't let that happen I was about to say as is that is that they put a bunch of
[1:18:46.800 --> 1:18:51.000]  degenerates and crooks in so foreign interest can use America like a vending
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:54.280]  machine they stick money in pull the lever get whatever they want out of it

[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:26.520]  planet member for since March of 11 and I think that we are completely being
[1:19:26.520 --> 1:19:30.880]  taken over if people don't wake up and they'll listen to people like you and
[1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:35.400]  this is sort of like the Alamo can't say it wouldn't be a Texas without Tennessee
[1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:42.360]  I called Lamar Alexander I call Corker all the time they always tell me
[1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:47.240]  exactly what they told you they will never but for these things now they
[1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:52.960]  just did the transportation and highway thing and in it was a section about
[1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:59.400]  firearms and they cut they said he didn't vote for that I looked up the
[1:19:59.400 --> 1:20:03.800]  votes and they voted yeah on it I don't know he said well he didn't vote for that
[1:20:03.800 --> 1:20:07.720]  part well I know this they're always changing those bills but what I know is
[1:20:07.720 --> 1:20:13.440]  in that bill is that the IRS just says you haven't paid your taxes I mean I've
[1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:16.440]  had them come after me and I know full well I've got mainline accountants and
[1:20:16.440 --> 1:20:20.080]  paying all that's you know stupid tax the fellow reserve and just for them
[1:20:20.080 --> 1:20:24.560]  saying you haven't paid they take your passport away which is a right as a
[1:20:24.560 --> 1:20:26.960]  citizen Charlie what do you think of that
[1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:30.560]  well I think it's just another paragraph you know it's just like that
[1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:35.080]  they could just keep coming at you from every direction they possibly can how
[1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:38.920]  about this situation we're gonna make kids under what was it 16th with working
[1:20:38.920 --> 1:20:44.080]  on farms oh yeah that's the night that brilliant the best way in the world for
[1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:48.480]  kids to learn to work ethic is to get up there is a farm kids have the best work
[1:20:48.480 --> 1:20:52.440]  ethic I used to work on a farm when I was a kid you know kids that drive the
[1:20:52.440 --> 1:20:56.320]  kids that are 10 years old on farms do a better job driving a tractor than most
[1:20:56.320 --> 1:21:00.720]  people on the highways do with automobiles well here's the deal my dad
[1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:04.320]  exactly my dad grew up on a farm and I've worked on the family farm we have in
[1:21:04.320 --> 1:21:07.720]  ranches nearby that's sitting down down there for a whole year one time but the
[1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:12.640]  point is is that that's what teaches you to act like an adult when you're young
[1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:16.640]  and teaches you responsibility and some of the best workers on those farms or
[1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:20.400]  children they're having a good time and they've got a lot of money in their
[1:21:20.400 --> 1:21:25.160]  pockets instead of playing video games or joining gangs but it shows how they
[1:21:25.160 --> 1:21:29.840]  want to destroy parental control over their children well it ain't gonna
[1:21:29.840 --> 1:21:34.040]  happen we can't let you it you know somehow some way we got to say our
[1:21:34.040 --> 1:21:37.640]  prayers and pull our boat and leave her and we cannot let this happen it's
[1:21:37.640 --> 1:21:44.720]  obvious that this is a very a very clear cut deal here that we want to go this
[1:21:44.720 --> 1:21:48.400]  way that Obama is gonna take us and he ain't gonna change it gonna be worse if
[1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:52.080]  you get to take a turn is it going is it are we gonna go this way we're gonna
[1:21:52.080 --> 1:21:55.920]  try to go another way we're gonna take a port in the road and you know it's like
[1:21:55.920 --> 1:21:59.120]  I don't know anything about I look like Mitt Romney's gonna run I don't know a
[1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:03.440]  whole lot about him but I know he ain't Obama and I know you know to me I don't
[1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:07.360]  endorse play that for candidates but right now I would vote for just about
[1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:12.320]  anybody but Obama you'd vote for Mickey Mouse over Obama I'd vote for Mickey
[1:22:12.320 --> 1:22:18.120]  Mouse in New York minute yeah we ought to start that let's do that Mickey Mouse
[1:22:18.120 --> 1:22:22.520]  president yeah over Obama we've got a Mickey we've got a Mickey Mouse president
[1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:25.880]  now what's the difference exactly let's jam in a few more for Charlie Daniels
[1:22:25.880 --> 1:22:31.560]  then he's got to go play the Kentucky Derby let's go ahead and talk to Don in
[1:22:31.560 --> 1:22:38.240]  Texas you're on the air Don Alex I wanted to recommend to you since you've
[1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:43.000]  got a musician you're interviewing today a song that nobody knows but they
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:49.640]  think they do and it's the Star Spangled Banner the last verse well you know
[1:22:49.640 --> 1:22:53.040]  what you're right it does have a last verse but the thing about it is when
[1:22:53.040 --> 1:22:57.120]  you do it nobody wants that last person cuz it takes too long to burn up
[1:22:57.120 --> 1:23:01.320]  network time and it won't get home with a football game you know but yeah
[1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:06.320]  definitely that's the last verse to it and I quickly recite it sure go ahead
[1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:13.280]  oh thus be it ever when free men shall stand between their loved home and the
[1:23:13.280 --> 1:23:19.880]  wars desolation blessed with a victory and peace may the heaven rescued land
[1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:25.240]  praise the power that has made and preserved us a nation the conquer we
[1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:32.960]  must then we cause it is just and thus be our motto in God is our trust yeah
[1:23:32.960 --> 1:23:37.360]  that's why they don't say that and the star spangled banner and triumph shall
[1:23:37.360 --> 1:23:42.200]  wave or the land of the free and the home of the brave everybody needs to
[1:23:42.200 --> 1:23:49.640]  memorize it good verse but you notice it says if our cause is just you see and
[1:23:49.640 --> 1:23:52.880]  and that's why they want to make us corrupt because we lose all of our
[1:23:52.880 --> 1:23:59.520]  providence once we become corrupt yes absolutely yeah well you're on the air
[1:23:59.520 --> 1:24:04.400]  with us I'm sorry Charlie go ahead so we're not gonna let this happen we can't
[1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:07.440]  let this happen we're not a caller you're on with Charlie Daniels did you
[1:24:07.440 --> 1:24:12.120]  have a question no I just wanted to since you got a musician on remind you all
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:16.680]  of that and all your listeners okay thank you again we've only got a few
[1:24:16.680 --> 1:24:19.120]  minutes left with Charlie we're going to break here in a second I want to jam
[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:22.520]  in a few more he's been very nice Charlie Daniels.com but Charlie I've
[1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:27.160]  got to selfishly ask you a question how did you come up with the devil went
[1:24:27.160 --> 1:24:31.120]  down to Georgia and how did you come up with the best fiddle a fiddle and I've
[1:24:31.120 --> 1:24:36.320]  ever heard well I have to disagree about the best feeling because I don't
[1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:39.200]  consider myself that but the way we came up down down to Georgia is pretty
[1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:44.040]  boring story actually we had we had written and Rick and rehearsed a whole
[1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:49.480]  album's worth of songs to go into an album and we got in the studio and
[1:24:49.480 --> 1:24:52.920]  instead we need a fiddle game I don't know why we didn't discover before we went
[1:24:52.920 --> 1:24:56.360]  in but we said we need a fiddle game so we took a break moved out of the recording
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:25:00.600]  studio into a rehearsal studio and wrote this song and I don't where the idea came
[1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:06.160]  from I just you know which is I read an old poem back in high school by Stephen
[1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:09.600]  Mitzvah and they called him out and went for a will it had to do with Finland and
[1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:12.680]  he always impressed me because it was a young fiddle player if that's where the
[1:25:12.680 --> 1:25:16.960]  idea came from but I got this thing devil went out of Georgia and the guy
[1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:20.040]  started chipping in and here we went the first thing you know went back to the
[1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:26.480]  unrecorded so is that not I wish it was a better story of that that's been not
[1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:29.480]  well you could always come out with another one but let me ask you this
[1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:33.000]  then it's kind of a bright stuff question where they say well who was the
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:36.320]  greatest fighter pilot you ever knew and he was about to say Chuck Yeager but he
[1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:41.760]  said himself who do you think is the greatest fiddle player living or not
[1:25:41.760 --> 1:25:51.480]  living Johnny Gamble is hard to beat I know you for me with him yes there's
[1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:57.120]  couple guys on the operate it or who has to his excellent fiddle player the best
[1:25:57.120 --> 1:26:01.440]  bow down fiddle player right now in my opinion is our white in place for the
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:07.160]  square dance is only offering how down to Finland almost a wild start nowadays
[1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:10.720]  because there's you know people square dance it much in a more on a grand scale
[1:26:10.720 --> 1:26:15.680]  and some of the guys that I ran into on the road once a while some of these
[1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:19.640]  young guys are really really good I play kids ask me about playing fiddle I say
[1:26:19.640 --> 1:26:23.440]  don't look at me I hold the bow wrong I hold the fiddle wrong I put too much
[1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:27.600]  pressure on the bow you know that's my style but it may not work for you don't
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:30.880]  you run your body and take your crazy don't do it I don't read music so I
[1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:34.760]  just do it everyone said all right I'm gonna jam in two more calls but folks
[1:26:34.760 --> 1:26:37.360]  you've got to just ask your question we've got to go because we've got about
[1:26:37.360 --> 1:26:41.920]  two minutes left here let's talk to Charles in Rhode Island Charles you're
[1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:45.920]  on the air with Charlie Daniels greetings and salutations talk so host
[1:26:45.920 --> 1:26:50.520]  extraordinaire freedom friend mr. Daniels basically this is my question do
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:55.840]  you really understand the real crux of the situation here up until 1951 90% of
[1:26:55.840 --> 1:27:00.160]  people paying for tax the government did something very smart and making people
[1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:04.160]  invest in the government so therefore the mindset is they got to collect that
[1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:08.000]  check that you know from the government for the social security rather listen I
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.880]  could put you on hold come back to you after break because we've only got a
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:15.760]  minute or so left you have a question do you understand that that's what the real
[1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:19.920]  mindset is that's a kind of put him on hold Charlie he's saying the the income
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:25.160]  taxes unconstitutional we didn't get it till 1913 what's your take on that well
[1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:31.800]  you know I don't mind paying tax I mean I don't mind paying you know there's no
[1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:35.720]  taxes in the jungle is there always that on my paying tax but I don't like paying
[1:27:35.720 --> 1:27:38.800]  absorbent taxes and I don't like think we should have a lot more say about how
[1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:43.720]  they're spent I don't like our money being used against us flat I think we
[1:27:43.720 --> 1:27:48.960]  should have a flat tax across the board and you know no detection no nothing
[1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:52.920]  the IRS is way too big don't need that many people they're doing it give us a
[1:27:52.920 --> 1:27:57.960]  flat tax we can figure your own income tax 10% okay fine here came so this that
[1:27:57.960 --> 1:28:01.040]  send it in be done with it well that's the big thing about the income taxes
[1:28:01.040 --> 1:28:05.280]  that it you can go to 50 CPAs money magazine has done this you get 50
[1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:09.080]  different answers it's written so they can claim you did something wrong let's

[1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:28.280]  government was being developed for to protect life liberty and the pursuit of
[1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:32.920]  happiness but you're not the god is the creator the one that creates is the one

[1:32:02.080 --> 1:32:05.680]  you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[1:32:05.680 --> 1:32:09.080]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[1:32:09.080 --> 1:32:13.200]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds
[1:32:13.200 --> 1:32:16.720]  about perform even golden silver before in this country and it's possible that
[1:32:16.720 --> 1:32:20.480]  could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put
[1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:25.200]  together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank

[1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:58.120]  real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones
[1:32:58.120 --> 1:33:09.360]  for survival seed bank com we now take you live to the central Texas command
[1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:33.360]  center and the heart of the resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:38.040]  you know the last few callers wanted to talk about how the income tax is a
[1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:44.240]  fraud we don't screen your phone calls unless I say we're taking the calls of
[1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:50.680]  farmers or police or auto workers that were covering a specific subject and
[1:33:50.680 --> 1:33:57.600]  want their expertise but obviously if I say we've got two minutes I want to take
[1:33:57.600 --> 1:34:06.320]  two calls quick question you then can't start a minute diatribe and expect
[1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:13.040]  Charlie Daniels to answer so instead of just asking a quick question and getting
[1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:17.360]  something in people just start running on then they get mad at me and I feel
[1:34:17.360 --> 1:34:23.040]  bad I'll guarantee you when this video goes up on prison planet TV and on my
[1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:28.720]  websites I'll see comments like there's Jones you know cutting them off when they
[1:34:28.720 --> 1:34:33.960]  were asking an important question it's a break I skipped the last break that drives
[1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:37.760]  the network crazy I can't skip local breaks those belong to local stations
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:43.720]  I skip network breaks all the time I've skipped a break that's like coming into
[1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:48.120]  an aircraft carrier with your you know no fuel you got one pass to land I got
[1:34:48.120 --> 1:34:52.320]  two minutes left I try to go to your calls and then you just start going into
[1:34:52.320 --> 1:34:56.160]  the whole history of the income tax being a fraud I'd already mentioned that to
[1:34:56.160 --> 1:35:02.200]  Charlie but we're bringing Charlie along he's waking up to agenda 21 to the new
[1:35:02.200 --> 1:35:07.520]  world order not just kind of mainline right-wing politics we're waking him up
[1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:12.480]  and so he doesn't know what you're talking about that's why I would preface
[1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:15.960]  it and say did you hear about that where they said the returning veterans of the
[1:35:15.960 --> 1:35:21.640]  number one threat he had heard of that so he could talk about it he didn't know
[1:35:21.640 --> 1:35:24.880]  what you were talking about it's like a jinnah 21 he was saying I didn't know
[1:35:24.880 --> 1:35:30.240]  about this till recently somebody you know a filmmaker contacted me to be in a
[1:35:30.240 --> 1:35:34.160]  film about it I went and researched it on the UN website found out it was true
[1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:39.080]  and again we've been on in Fredericksburg for 17 years I know that filmmaker
[1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:43.200]  contacted me beyond that's the type of thing I love to see probably somebody
[1:35:43.200 --> 1:35:50.400]  we woke up a film I didn't even appear in just like I didn't Aaron Russo kept
[1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:54.360]  begging me to be in America freedom to fascism and I'm not bragging saying oh
[1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:58.760]  hey look I'd have been in this or I'd have been in that it's just funny how
[1:35:58.760 --> 1:36:02.440]  busy I get because there's just stacks of interview requests in there I just
[1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:08.000]  turned down and then I realized wow I'm probably blowing it so I'm gonna tell
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.800]  the behold the pale horse folks if they want to put out a second edition I'll
[1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:13.720]  be more than glad to be in it because I've been watching clips of it wow talk
[1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:17.200]  about good I've seen the whole thing yet and so there's your endorsement right
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:21.200]  there and then I think about America freedom to fascism that reached tens of
[1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:27.080]  millions was a blockbuster for Liberty and I'll talk about a who's who that's
[1:36:27.080 --> 1:36:30.760]  in that film I want to carry that thing by the way that guy's emailed us and
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:36.320]  contacted us over and over again and of course now we can't even find his
[1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:39.880]  contact so the director wants to come in here in studio get ahold of us right
[1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:45.080]  now we want to have you on but continuing if you just joined us we had
[1:36:45.080 --> 1:36:50.840]  Charlie Daniels on the type of thing that irritates me though is that I know
[1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:56.160]  I'll be criticized for hanging up on those callers or putting them on hold
[1:36:56.160 --> 1:37:01.840]  as if I was censoring them when I wasn't there wasn't time to do a treatise
[1:37:01.840 --> 1:37:10.800]  on the income tax there wasn't time to go into that we we have constant guest
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:17.360]  on exposing it it is a fraud it's unconstitutional but we didn't have
[1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:23.240]  time it'd be like if you had to be at work in an hour you couldn't go to a
[1:37:23.240 --> 1:37:28.200]  matinee two-hour movie got to be at work in an hour takes 30 months to get to
[1:37:28.200 --> 1:37:33.280]  work can you watch a two-hour matinee no you'd end up being two and a half three
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:39.560]  hours late to work you cannot do it like I saw a comment in the article about
[1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:46.840]  FEMA camps when the reason I'm covering this is it deals with people's lack of
[1:37:46.840 --> 1:37:53.400]  deep thought and the article leaked us army document outlines plan for
[1:37:53.400 --> 1:38:01.440]  reeducation camps in America and this is the big issue but there's like 450
[1:38:01.440 --> 1:38:08.200]  comments in there and half of them are saying yes we're accurate and you know
[1:38:08.200 --> 1:38:12.040]  here's some more documents and then another 25% are saying yeah it's pretty
[1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:17.440]  bad I hope we can back this off but the other 25% are saying it isn't true even
[1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:22.320]  though all the documents links screenshots PDF highlighted areas are
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:29.200]  right there and then another group in there are saying Alex Jones didn't give
[1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:36.280]  credit to who first broke this and I know how Watson is if somebody else
[1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:40.480]  covers it he always links to them especially because in case it turns out
[1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:45.640]  to be not totally accurate somebody else did it so I call Watson up this
[1:38:45.640 --> 1:38:48.800]  morning I saw a few of these comments and I said where'd you get that
[1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:53.080]  originally and he said an email one of our listeners pointed out it was in the
[1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:58.920]  Defense Department websites I said yeah okay well thank you just so I could
[1:38:58.920 --> 1:39:03.880]  certify it was somebody made a video mentioning it and that's the whole point
[1:39:03.880 --> 1:39:09.640]  is then we see it or Charlie Daniels sees it or Ron Paul sees it and then we
[1:39:09.640 --> 1:39:14.560]  cover it we're not every time I get amateur activists on all they want to do
[1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:18.680]  is thank all their friends and everyone else like it's an Academy Awards
[1:39:18.680 --> 1:39:25.680]  ceremony we're not here to just constantly obsess over who covered what
[1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:30.920]  first or who knew what first and I saw the person commenting said Alex Jones
[1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:38.600]  never gives credit and never helps other activists really info wars.com and
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:46.040]  prisonplanet.com is the mothership of bringing other people on and waking
[1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:51.400]  other people up and having candidates on and researchers and activists and
[1:39:51.400 --> 1:39:58.600]  filmmakers and and and people taking action that's what we do and it isn't
[1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:05.080]  that I don't like being criticized I don't care it upsets me to just see that
[1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:13.880]  kind of trolling swarming you know we've got FEMA camps being set up with
[1:40:13.880 --> 1:40:18.800]  massive MPs being trained and private contractors in billion dollar contracts
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:24.520]  every few months to prepare to turn the camps on I've never seen this happen
[1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:28.480]  they've taken them out of mothballs they had set up at old bases they're
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:33.360]  firing them up and 25% of people in the article are saying we're making it up
[1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:37.520]  not quite 25 and and a few percentage points of those are complaining about
[1:40:37.520 --> 1:40:46.400]  who reported it first that is insane that is crazy when all we do is link to
[1:40:46.400 --> 1:40:51.840]  other people's videos when all we do is promote everybody else it's amazing
[1:40:51.840 --> 1:40:57.680]  this isn't about being big stars this isn't about getting attention the only
[1:40:57.680 --> 1:41:01.120]  reason I want to get more attention is the bigger I get the better chance I've
[1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:05.440]  got them not being killed see it's not the way you think it is it's when you
[1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:10.000]  are small and exposing corruption at point-blank range within the
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:16.280]  organization itself they come after you and I'm just so tired of the infighting
[1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:22.880]  I'm so tired of all the mindlessness it's just so pointless like I don't mind
[1:41:22.880 --> 1:41:27.760]  being attacked by people because it actually just advertises us I had
[1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:33.440]  somebody last week run these Google ads a big Google ad attacking something I
[1:41:33.440 --> 1:41:42.600]  was selling and it tripled sales of the product and that's the way God takes
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:45.960]  attacks in terms of into something good and I was like oh they must have run out
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:50.320]  of money I wish they would have continued that the reason I'm against
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:56.160]  being attacked is because those people are spending their time doing something
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:01.160]  that is a waste of time you see what I'm saying I mean I consider and plug stuff
[1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:04.240]  every hour the last two or three days I've hardly plugged anything even though
[1:42:04.240 --> 1:42:09.520]  that's why I fund my news organization my reporters my webmasters the customer
[1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:16.040]  service people the researchers the accountant the writers you know all of
[1:42:16.040 --> 1:42:21.840]  it but then God does things like somebody attacks me thinking that when
[1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:28.640]  they run a Google ad making up stuff and lying about the pro pure water systems
[1:42:28.640 --> 1:42:37.520]  then that just tripled tripled sales when their ad ran tripled sales when they
[1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:41.120]  ran a disinfo piece attack on the pro pure filter that I consider and plug
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:44.600]  every hour if I wanted to I've done the test I've looked at them I think it's
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:49.200]  the best filter out there why frankly we don't carry some of the other filters
[1:42:49.200 --> 1:42:51.720]  because that they would break in shipment and the people wouldn't try to
[1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:56.160]  refund it we had all sorts of complaints something that was really good we
[1:42:56.160 --> 1:43:00.000]  started getting complaints about so for a year I didn't promote anything until I
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:04.680]  tested stuff myself and said I like this and does it mean it's the best thing in
[1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:09.480]  the galaxy no it's the best thing I found the storeable food company we've got
[1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:15.000]  I bought from three or four places MSG additives crud tasted like garbage was
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:19.600]  old finally found a place that oh was the biggest the oldest the best the newest
[1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:26.400]  food that's who I promote does it mean I'm perfect no I promote what I believe
[1:43:26.400 --> 1:43:30.440]  in I promote the info wars team calm with the best vitamin and mineral
[1:43:30.440 --> 1:43:34.120]  supplements I found that we've seen real results with saw Aaron lose 90 plus
[1:43:34.120 --> 1:43:41.000]  pounds some even a fat loss program I promote what I believe in does that mean
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:46.440]  I'm perfect no but let me tell you I get offers every day not even every day
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:50.600]  every hour they had like a hundred offers in there for advertisers and I'm
[1:43:50.600 --> 1:43:53.720]  like I'm too busy I gotta do the nightly news are like can you just this is like
[1:43:53.720 --> 1:43:56.760]  a week of stuff it's like a hundred offers you have to approve the
[1:43:56.760 --> 1:44:01.760]  advertisers and the problem is if I can't research an advertiser I don't
[1:44:01.760 --> 1:44:05.520]  take it not because I don't think they're good I have to use something I
[1:44:05.520 --> 1:44:10.840]  have to believe in it I have to get into it before I'll promote it let me tell
[1:44:10.840 --> 1:44:18.240]  you something there is almost no one in radio TV or print that does that I could
[1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:23.480]  call up Time Magazine and put ads in there for any amount of baloney I wanted
[1:44:23.480 --> 1:44:29.440]  they take the ad no questions asked this place but then you get attacked for
[1:44:29.440 --> 1:44:33.520]  what you advertise and sell you think man I might as well just sell people
[1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:38.560]  crud but I go no that's the devil talking it's because we are moral and
[1:44:38.560 --> 1:44:42.920]  upstanding that we're always accused of not being moral and upstanding it's
[1:44:42.920 --> 1:44:47.600]  because our heart is right and we try to do good that we're always being attacked
[1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:52.400]  and people are always saying we're not pure well let me just do you a favor
[1:44:52.400 --> 1:44:58.920]  let's just say I'm impure because we all are let's just say I'm consciously bad
[1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:06.200]  which I'm not I'm consciously good why I'm dangerous for all my problems let's
[1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:10.720]  just say I'm bad and get that out of the way government and Co until pro wants us
[1:45:10.720 --> 1:45:14.600]  to all fight with each other and and and nip at each other's heels all day
[1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:19.640]  instead of dealing with the hardcore issues that's why I blow up when some
[1:45:19.640 --> 1:45:22.760]  guy calls up and says all the National Guard's doing patrols on the streets
[1:45:22.760 --> 1:45:27.200]  what's the big deal you should have gotten both sides you're bad and I go
[1:45:27.200 --> 1:45:30.140]  okay what am I bad about well you just you're talking about about the National
[1:45:30.140 --> 1:45:35.320]  Guard I blow up at him because I'm not talking bad about the National Guard I'm
[1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:39.160]  talking bad about how they're being used along with the regular army and
[1:45:39.160 --> 1:45:43.880]  Marines to acclimate us for military on the streets of America and feds on the
[1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:48.800]  streets and it's all happening and the guys sitting there saying it's not I'm
[1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:53.800]  not putting up with it okay the Sun came up this morning if somebody calls me and
[1:45:53.800 --> 1:45:57.360]  says Alex the Sun didn't come up this morning I'm gonna either hang up on him
[1:45:57.360 --> 1:46:03.920]  or I'm gonna start yelling at him that's what I'm talking about I live this I
[1:46:03.920 --> 1:46:08.560]  researched this I am telling you what I really believe is the truth and I'm
[1:46:08.560 --> 1:46:15.480]  like 98% accurate I used to say I was 99% but really I'm about 2% of the time
[1:46:15.480 --> 1:46:18.840]  we're wrong now because we're doing too much there's too much happening it's
[1:46:18.840 --> 1:46:23.400]  moving too quick okay but I wake up in the middle of the night worried about
[1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:27.400]  this the new old order is real the cancer viruses and the vaccines are real look
[1:46:27.400 --> 1:46:33.880]  it up please the sodium fluoride the bisphenol a it's all real and we fight
[1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:37.800]  the sodium fluoride and bisphenol a we're getting it pulled out we fight the
[1:46:37.800 --> 1:46:42.800]  corn syrup people are stopping to drink it and people are finding out we're
[1:46:42.800 --> 1:46:47.640]  saving a lot of lives here this is real and it is a crime to sit here and attack
[1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:51.280]  people that are doing the best they can and again it's not because it's not I'm
[1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:54.920]  not angry because you're attacking me I'm angry because we need you fighting the
[1:46:54.920 --> 1:47:01.040]  new world order folks in a sick way when you attack me it makes me more powerful
[1:47:01.040 --> 1:47:05.560]  but it doesn't make the movement more powerful do you understand that and
[1:47:05.560 --> 1:47:08.920]  that's why it makes me want to cry
[1:47:12.920 --> 1:47:18.000]  and I'm sick of the trolls too the way they manipulate people to argue with
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:20.600]  them and fight with them on prison planet and info wars the way they kill
[1:47:20.600 --> 1:47:25.000]  discussion that's why I've never had a full-time moderator I've hired two and
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  starting in the next few weeks because one of them just now getting hired we're
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:32.240]  gonna have people on there 24 hours a day you go into the info wars message
[1:47:32.240 --> 1:47:36.320]  boards or the or the prison planet forum and you try to start in fights are you
[1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:40.280]  you go into subjects about one thing and try to change it on purpose and we
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:45.320]  know your IP address is the same person posing as three people you're just gone
[1:47:45.320 --> 1:47:50.200]  we want to have real discussion we want to move things forward we want to
[1:47:50.200 --> 1:47:55.440]  organize against tyranny I will tell you finally after four or five years of
[1:47:55.440 --> 1:47:58.840]  being put off and not working right and everything else that the we are gonna
[1:47:58.840 --> 1:48:03.520]  beta test starting next week the social network but you got to sign up for the
[1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:09.040]  free newsletter at the info wars insider on the right-hand side of info wars
[1:48:09.040 --> 1:48:13.800]  comm if you sign up to that email as hundreds of thousands have we will send
[1:48:13.800 --> 1:48:18.400]  you an email sometime next week with the social network web address and
[1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:22.240]  information and you can be the first to beta test it and then a few weeks after
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:26.800]  that we'll work some bugs out we're gonna go full bore full tilt buggy we had a
[1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:31.920]  little off-the-shelf social network that got like I don't know 35,000 members
[1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:41.800]  some 30 to 37,000 how many 30 30 38,000 38,000 users but the program couldn't
[1:48:41.800 --> 1:48:45.040]  handle it it was like some little thing for little sites and crashed and we
[1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:50.280]  couldn't fix it and I've run into people on the streets I was at a UFC fight
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:54.400]  that Joe Rogan invited me to two years ago or three years ago in Austin and not
[1:48:54.400 --> 1:48:59.280]  one but two different couples came up to me and we talk about God because I mean
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:04.520]  I probably only had it two other times separately happened on the street in one
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:08.660]  night a man and a woman and a man and a woman walked up and said will you please
[1:49:08.660 --> 1:49:14.200]  bring the social network back we met on your little social network and got
[1:49:14.200 --> 1:49:17.680]  married and have children and then and then after the fight I'm leaving another
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:21.760]  couple locks and those Alex Jones we met on the social network and I was like
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:28.920]  whoa now maybe it was a coincidence whatever the point is we've got a beefy
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:32.760]  one that we're gonna beta test next week and if you're signed up there at the
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:36.440]  email the free email thing you'll get it because I can't give it to the full
[1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:38.960]  you know tens of millions of listeners because if there's any problems it'll
[1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:42.440]  just wreck it so we're gonna beta test that next week I'm sure it'll be attacked
[1:49:42.440 --> 1:49:46.560]  by people and stuff hackers and folks but whatever we're gearing up for that
[1:49:46.560 --> 1:49:50.440]  because it's not it's gonna have a dating area and I'm even dating just
[1:49:50.440 --> 1:49:55.080]  getting together we're gonna call it freedom lovers and it's gonna be you

[1:50:31.080 --> 1:50:34.800]  me but I'm just learning to just say you know what I'm doing what I can that's
[1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:39.400]  why when somebody calls up thanking me it's like it's like taking a branding
[1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:43.000]  iron to me because they're counting on me and all these people are looking to
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:47.520]  Alex Jones and that's what we're talking about myself is I'm trying to like

[2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:48.240]  come back out to that facility again really so so who there specifically said
[2:02:48.240 --> 2:02:52.200]  they're ramping up the domestic checkpoints just one of the guys that
[2:02:52.200 --> 2:02:56.640]  was in there that was in the restraining just an older gentleman and it's kind
[2:02:56.640 --> 2:03:00.120]  of like what you said how before that they're collaborators so many people
[2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:04.520]  don't have a job and don't have any other prospect but to work for it but to
[2:03:04.520 --> 2:03:08.680]  be the minions of these globalists and it's a shame because you see some of
[2:03:08.680 --> 2:03:12.000]  these guys in there they're just barely they're just happy to get a paycheck they
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:16.960]  don't care what they're doing so declare he didn't even work for the TSA but he
[2:03:16.960 --> 2:03:21.280]  knew he'd been told this is we're gonna set up checkpoints and he thought that
[2:03:21.280 --> 2:03:26.040]  was good just because he was at a lotan dock he's part of the winning team yes
[2:03:26.040 --> 2:03:30.120]  sir yes sir exactly you know what stay there we're gonna come back from break

[2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:35.480]  Stockholm syndrome here's the CBS news headlines summit could mean airport
[2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:40.760]  style security and I saw the what was it three billion extra just a few months
[2:09:40.760 --> 2:09:45.200]  ago past Congress and then there was some other spending as well where they
[2:09:45.200 --> 2:09:49.480]  are calling him TSA inspectors and they're the boss of everything they
[2:09:49.480 --> 2:09:53.600]  were just going to be at shipping places and infrastructure but now
[2:09:53.600 --> 2:09:59.120]  everything's infrastructure and they're just all over Texas I heard San Antonio
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:04.400]  Dallas Houston warrantless bag searches checkpoints they command the police and
[2:10:04.400 --> 2:10:09.600]  I've heard from a little bird in the city of Austin in the police department
[2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:15.400]  that coming up in the middle of the summer we'll be getting them here first
[2:10:15.400 --> 2:10:19.240]  it won't be on the news though it's to acclimate officers that they just set up
[2:10:19.240 --> 2:10:22.600]  little checkpoints and they have a few little little light rail stations and
[2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:28.040]  people get there and it's like hey meet potbelly he's gonna grab your genitals
[2:10:28.040 --> 2:10:33.280]  and search your bag without a warrant so it's here now he just called in but we
[2:10:33.280 --> 2:10:38.520]  got cut off by the break I want Casey in Oklahoma to describe and get everything
[2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:42.320]  he's saying is already on record but this is I witnessed to this repeat
[2:10:42.320 --> 2:10:45.720]  everything you said and add the other area you didn't have time to get into
[2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:50.720]  about what you witnessed there at the main distribution hub in Oklahoma it's
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:55.920]  also the main prisoner hub I should add for the feds but break down what you were
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:11:02.600]  told this was for go ahead the delivery it says it in the body of the bill that
[2:11:02.600 --> 2:11:06.560]  I had the freight bill it says TSA field training kids and it's a pretty good
[2:11:06.560 --> 2:11:10.920]  size kid I'm about six foot tall six to it and it's taller than me there's hard
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:16.920]  case of toast on there that has padlock on them and a shrink wrap that's got
[2:11:16.920 --> 2:11:21.200]  security wrap tape all around it and I've been delivering to this place for two
[2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:25.320]  weeks now probably 16 to 20 skids going to this place and I asked the guy why
[2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:28.920]  is there so much coming through here he just kind of looked at me with this
[2:11:28.920 --> 2:11:33.800]  little grin on his face well they're fixed to wrap up a domestic checkpoint and
[2:11:33.800 --> 2:11:38.480]  I had to bite my tongue I told him they better not do it to me I still have a
[2:11:38.480 --> 2:11:43.200]  fourth amendment right and they called and asked that I not come back out to
[2:11:43.200 --> 2:11:47.680]  that facility because because they're a bunch of pervs hey do you have any
[2:11:47.680 --> 2:11:49.920]  daughters or children because they're really looking forward to getting their
[2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:53.480]  hands on your wife so you think you're gonna avoid them by not flying these
[2:11:53.480 --> 2:11:57.600]  pervs they're gonna get their goods take Tennessee they've had four years of
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:02.800]  grope points with the army at them and they actually grope I mean imagine you
[2:12:02.800 --> 2:12:08.840]  it's like we're putting your hands on your crying kids welcome to America I
[2:12:08.840 --> 2:12:13.600]  mean this is so this is fully this is martial law and slow motion it's what it
[2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:19.920]  is exactly I'm not a violent person by any means but I will stand to defend my
[2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:23.800]  constitutional rights I have three kids a 10 and 12 and a three-year-old all
[2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:29.640]  boys who they like three-year-olds they like those yeah they better not that
[2:12:29.640 --> 2:12:34.800]  that's just that's like you like but I'm sorry did you hear they ordered
[2:12:34.800 --> 2:12:39.960]  hundreds of mobile armored pill boxes they're gonna be in armored pill boxes
[2:12:39.960 --> 2:12:47.680]  yes sir in that in that now oh and 400 sorry we're talking about the what that
[2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:50.200]  does tell tune into what you were saying about how they're saying that the
[2:12:50.200 --> 2:12:54.760]  returning veterans are the number one enemy I'm a type of person I was always
[2:12:54.760 --> 2:12:59.680]  raised that you asked the old-timers like any job I've ever been in
[2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:03.680]  construction dig digging ditches running a trencher running a heavy
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:07.600]  baler driving a truck I don't have a problem picking the old-timers minds
[2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:11.320]  asking them hey how should I go about this how should I do this they've got
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:15.200]  the experience I don't have a problem going to them and that's one thing that
[2:13:15.200 --> 2:13:19.360]  I see that they're trying to take take out of the equation is these returning
[2:13:19.360 --> 2:13:22.760]  veterans because when something does come and something hits them when it
[2:13:22.760 --> 2:13:26.520]  when it does hit the fan those are the people that I'm gonna gravitate to those
[2:13:26.520 --> 2:13:29.560]  are the people that I'm gonna go and try and pick their mind teach me tactics
[2:13:29.560 --> 2:13:34.520]  teach me survival teach me weapons teach me what they taught you in boot camp
[2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:38.480]  and I see that they're trying to remove that equation but you can't get the
[2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:43.120]  experience and that education from those who have been in contact who are
[2:13:43.120 --> 2:13:47.560]  awake to what this world government I want to get rid of the force multipliers
[2:13:47.560 --> 2:13:54.400]  is what that's called that's exactly what that is well I tell you so but but you
[2:13:54.400 --> 2:13:58.840]  also add and repeat your point about this is the collaborator bootlicker type
[2:13:58.840 --> 2:14:03.360]  who in who who enjoys the idea of checkpoints because he feels like he's
[2:14:03.360 --> 2:14:08.200]  part of it because he helps ship it to him tell folks about that well exactly
[2:14:08.200 --> 2:14:11.160]  it's like the Boolean school you know that he doesn't have any power unless
[2:14:11.160 --> 2:14:13.920]  what are you getting and these little guys here they're doing everything
[2:14:13.920 --> 2:14:18.000]  they can't just to have a job and they feel empowered because they're working
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:22.320]  with so the so-called powers that be they're gonna march in on the people I
[2:14:22.320 --> 2:14:25.640]  mean these guys are just you could just tell that this is our last pitch effort
[2:14:25.640 --> 2:14:28.800]  for a job and they think that they've got something because they've gone along
[2:14:28.800 --> 2:14:33.120]  and collaborated with this enemy that is infiltrated our government like the
[2:14:33.120 --> 2:14:37.320]  French did that turned against our own people that's ridiculous how can these
[2:14:37.320 --> 2:14:40.800]  people say they're Americans and know what they're doing to this gut to these
[2:14:40.800 --> 2:14:44.840]  people when this does hit the fan Alex it is common and it's going to hit the
[2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:49.320]  people that I'm in contact with here with the former military and people that
[2:14:49.320 --> 2:14:54.280]  that are awake we're prepared we're prepared in Oklahoma for whatever comes
[2:14:54.280 --> 2:14:57.680]  and I'm sorry if it does come to that that's just like you said that's what
[2:14:57.680 --> 2:15:01.240]  they want they want us fighting with it must each other why they set off shore
[2:15:01.240 --> 2:15:05.600]  and watch what happens here but the boys in America we don't in Oklahoma we
[2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:10.680]  don't miss we're trained whether we got whether it's handguns rifles bows and
[2:15:10.680 --> 2:15:15.120]  arrows whether it's a swing shot we're prepared and it better not come here
[2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:20.800]  because they're not gonna like what they find well the collaborators the
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:22.920]  collaborators aren't gonna like what happens to them you're talking about
[2:15:22.920 --> 2:15:28.280]  the Vici French helping stand down France when the Nazis rolled in people
[2:15:28.280 --> 2:15:31.920]  say Hitler defeated the French most their military just stood down to been
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:36.320]  paid off that's what the West didn't Iraq they'd already paid off the Iraqi
[2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:41.240]  Republican Guard so that almost no one resisted when they came in and you know
[2:15:41.240 --> 2:15:46.880]  that's how these governments do this and 450 million rounds of 40 hollow point
[2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:52.080]  for the American people hundreds of mobile pillboxes a couple hundred
[2:15:52.080 --> 2:15:56.720]  million rounds of 223 308 they're handing out shotguns and rifles to even
[2:15:56.720 --> 2:16:02.360]  non law enforcement agencies they are gearing up for a war with the American
[2:16:02.360 --> 2:16:06.200]  people and while the banker set off shore they think they're gonna send in
[2:16:06.200 --> 2:16:12.320]  the TSA commanding the local police that's the sickest thing I've seen
[2:16:12.320 --> 2:16:18.320]  newscast out of Tennessee and Houston it'll show the TSA people walking around
[2:16:18.320 --> 2:16:23.160]  with a clipboard ordering the police to search people I mean it's so pathetic
[2:16:23.160 --> 2:16:28.000]  and it's so pathetic how the Houston police chief is makes me want to throw
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:32.600]  up anything else sir yeah you were talking about how they were talking
[2:16:32.600 --> 2:16:38.800]  about how people are being watched on Facebook and by the FBI I've specifically
[2:16:38.800 --> 2:16:42.560]  been on Facebook myself and I will put ransom against the government against the
[2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:49.040]  NDA I have been deleted while I have been placing my my statement and backed
[2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:54.000]  out of Facebook on my cell phone on my Android no no it happens all the time
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:59.480]  it's all listen imagine the millions of cowards that have joined this system and
[2:16:59.480 --> 2:17:03.480]  I've run into them and they love it they want reeducation camps they live these
[2:17:03.480 --> 2:17:07.320]  are guys that couldn't get a woman if they had a million dollars you know a
[2:17:07.320 --> 2:17:11.320]  guy that women can tell when a guy's good and strong you know you can't keep

[2:24:04.480 --> 2:24:08.840]  all right this is a quick report and then Joel Scalzen is coming up more your
[2:24:08.840 --> 2:24:14.400]  calls about a year ago I was driving on 22 22 at like five o'clock in the
[2:24:14.400 --> 2:24:18.440]  afternoon on about 60 miles an hour a lady came out of her lane I was in the
[2:24:18.440 --> 2:24:23.200]  slow lane almost hit me so I had to go over into the shoulder right as I was
[2:24:23.200 --> 2:24:29.880]  going over a hill there was a bike right up in the edge of the lane do they
[2:24:29.880 --> 2:24:33.040]  have big shoulders all these roads the bikes will get right over on the line
[2:24:33.040 --> 2:24:39.160]  or sometimes actually get on interstate highways I almost killed them and they
[2:24:39.160 --> 2:24:41.920]  would have been all over my car you're coming into my windshield might have
[2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:47.320]  killed me but I was able to get over as the car began to get over and almost hit
[2:24:47.320 --> 2:24:54.520]  them and the bike rider as I drove by was flipping me off now Richard Reeves
[2:24:54.520 --> 2:24:58.760]  who does reports camera work also helps me drive the bus around we go on the
[2:24:58.760 --> 2:25:04.720]  road he's a longtime 18-wheeler driver you name it and cab driver and I was
[2:25:04.720 --> 2:25:07.720]  telling the story of the day and he ran up and said my gosh they they they
[2:25:07.720 --> 2:25:11.960]  challenge you they're aggressive and they run red lights they cut in front of
[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:16.920]  you they get on 360 they get on major highways and get in the roads and when
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:19.960]  they get in packs I get even crazier and they're getting killed like every week
[2:25:19.960 --> 2:25:23.800]  in Austin and so the answer the government is saying is to shut down part
[2:25:23.800 --> 2:25:28.360]  of lanes Lamar South Congress make you back into the parking spots causing all
[2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:31.360]  these wrecks it's all about the bike riders and that's what the news is
[2:25:31.360 --> 2:25:35.800]  saying who wins in Boston bikes versus cars and I'm not against bikes I like
[2:25:35.800 --> 2:25:40.360]  biking Richard likes the mountain bike when I bike I get way over on the
[2:25:40.360 --> 2:25:45.480]  shoulder I mean when I'm in a car I defensively drive I mean motorcyclists
[2:25:45.480 --> 2:25:49.920]  don't drive like this if there's something wrong with these bicyclers and
[2:25:49.920 --> 2:25:54.420]  they say hey we're taking over the gena 21 is using them telling them hey the
[2:25:54.420 --> 2:25:57.480]  road jurors they're talking about taking highways now and giving them bike
[2:25:57.480 --> 2:26:01.360]  lanes ladies and gentlemen the number one cause of death for police and
[2:26:01.360 --> 2:26:06.920]  firefighters is pulling people over or working highways this is not fun this
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:11.640]  is this is cars going 75 miles an hour killing each other and they've got
[2:26:11.640 --> 2:26:14.920]  steel cages Richard we only got about three minutes but give us your report
[2:26:14.920 --> 2:26:18.840]  on this because they had another person get run over on a major highway in
[2:26:18.840 --> 2:26:22.120]  Austin and of course trains are killing people now so they're saying get rid of
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:26.760]  cars because the trains can't stop I mean this is crazy it is crazy like rail I
[2:26:26.760 --> 2:26:31.360]  drove for 30 years professionally 20 years 18 wheelers 10 years driving taxi
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:35.600]  here in Austin in San Antonio and I got to tell you when I started driving cab
[2:26:35.600 --> 2:26:40.680]  10 plus years in taxi business I started driving in 9798 with the cabs and I've
[2:26:40.680 --> 2:26:44.960]  seen as the years have gone by that continually pedestrians and bicyclists
[2:26:44.960 --> 2:26:48.720]  just get more brazen and more neglectful about what they're doing I don't
[2:26:48.720 --> 2:26:51.480]  know they'll be on their phone and walk out in front of you that's right you
[2:26:51.480 --> 2:26:55.760]  know we talk about texting and driving well it's like recently I saw a
[2:26:55.760 --> 2:26:59.240]  pedestrian downtown Austin that was messing with his smartphone I don't
[2:26:59.240 --> 2:27:01.960]  know if he was texting or calling or what but he was still walking into an
[2:27:01.960 --> 2:27:07.440]  intersection he ran right smack flat dab into a van taxi cab right there
[2:27:07.440 --> 2:27:11.480]  sitting there at the red light he just walked right into it so the bicyclists
[2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:15.580]  are challenging down there downtown especially is really bad in South
[2:27:15.580 --> 2:27:18.480]  Austin North Austin but they'll aggressively cut in front of you and
[2:27:18.480 --> 2:27:22.120]  then bug their eyes down or they'll cut across two lanes and if you look at them
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:26.720]  wrong they'll go f you right and I'm like wow bike rage is the issue but it's
[2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:31.000]  like oh they're little special there our Lord we must do what they say and I'm
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:34.480]  sitting here I love vehicles with two wheels I mean I've had motorcycles most
[2:27:34.480 --> 2:27:37.960]  years of my life and I intend to have another motorcycle one day I love
[2:27:37.960 --> 2:27:40.960]  somebody stole your motorcycle somebody stole my motorcycle a couple years ago
[2:27:40.960 --> 2:27:45.100]  otherwise I'd still have it and I love bicycles I grew up riding bikes I love
[2:27:45.100 --> 2:27:49.200]  two-wheeled vehicles but here's the rule folks if you're riding on two wheels
[2:27:49.200 --> 2:27:52.760]  whether it's a bicycle or motorcycle you're invisible assume that nobody
[2:27:52.760 --> 2:27:56.480]  sees you you've got to assume that you're invisible super defensive because if a
[2:27:56.480 --> 2:28:00.520]  car hits you a truck hits you whatever a motorized vehicle of any type hits you
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:04.320]  who's gonna win that battle in the long run I mean maybe you're six feet under
[2:28:04.320 --> 2:28:07.040]  or maybe your family soothes or whatever and get some money out of it but
[2:28:07.040 --> 2:28:10.960]  but that's not even the issue sure they're bad drivers they admit these
[2:28:10.960 --> 2:28:14.800]  bike riders are getting super aggressive well they are and they are and I
[2:28:14.800 --> 2:28:17.800]  mean it's part of that that that critical mass where they take over New York and
[2:28:17.800 --> 2:28:21.800]  stuff but now it's just like I'm gonna show you I'm gonna run out in front of
[2:28:21.800 --> 2:28:25.600]  an 80 mile an hour car that'll show you right I've experienced that myself and
[2:28:25.600 --> 2:28:29.280]  and there was talk on the mainstream radio here in Austin about giving the
[2:28:29.280 --> 2:28:32.960]  bicyclist super rights where there's even a bigger penalty if you hit one or
[2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:36.280]  run over one well God forbid they get those super rights because then they'll
[2:28:36.280 --> 2:28:39.440]  really who knows what levels they'll challenge us then you know just driving
[2:28:39.440 --> 2:28:43.760]  on the streets so it's just crazy but they're so they break all the laws like
[2:28:43.760 --> 2:28:47.400]  nothing I've seen well and I'll sit there I'll admit I've run my share of red
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:50.960]  lights when I'm on a bicycle or whatever but nobody's ever had to step on a
[2:28:50.960 --> 2:28:55.480]  break nobody's ever had to steer to avoid me that's the difference yeah but I
[2:28:55.480 --> 2:29:00.600]  mean I was on 360 a few months ago and I was getting off at the B cave section
[2:29:00.600 --> 2:29:04.800]  and we're on about 10 miles an hour down the deal and the guy gets off there's
[2:29:04.800 --> 2:29:10.280]  two lanes and he just cuts in front of everyone almost hitting him and like and
[2:29:10.280 --> 2:29:14.640]  then stopping and then going and acting arrogant and I'm not into road rage I
[2:29:14.640 --> 2:29:19.040]  control it but the road rage I'm seeing these bicycles they think they're God
[2:29:19.040 --> 2:29:23.520]  they're anti car it's liberals on these things they're anti car they're
[2:29:23.520 --> 2:29:26.520]  arrogant chicken necks it's like I mentioned to you the other day that the
[2:29:26.520 --> 2:29:31.000]  most dangerous people whether it's drivers bicyclists pedestrians
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:34.240]  motorcyclists to me in my book right now the most dangerous people out there on
[2:29:34.240 --> 2:29:39.000]  the road are the bicyclists no I mean I see them almost hit every day they just
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:42.840]  they think they're God yes and I know when I've been on a motorcycle or a bike
[2:29:42.840 --> 2:29:46.360]  I act like I'm invisible well and that's the only way to survive and then they
[2:29:46.360 --> 2:29:49.380]  complain when they get killed Richard Richard Reeves thanks for popping in
[2:29:49.380 --> 2:29:54.960]  Joel Scowzen coming up we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[2:34:02.400 --> 2:34:06.080]  work now he was just on last week and I don't normally have guests on you two
[2:34:06.080 --> 2:34:09.660]  weeks in a row but I appreciate him coming on but so much of what we talked
[2:34:09.660 --> 2:34:14.640]  about is now coming out in the mainstream media here's the Washington
[2:34:14.640 --> 2:34:21.320]  Times today Russia threatens to strike NATO missile defense sites that is one
[2:34:21.320 --> 2:34:26.000]  of the reports this is unprecedented they're ahead Russian chief of general
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:31.720]  or Russian chief of general staff came out and at a meeting with NATO and said
[2:34:31.720 --> 2:34:35.520]  if you deploy those that allows you to have a first strike you hit us with
[2:34:35.520 --> 2:34:40.580]  nukes we fire missiles you shoot them down you do that we're gonna hit your
[2:34:40.580 --> 2:34:45.440]  sites and I know Joel Scowles is a big expert on what's going on with the
[2:34:45.440 --> 2:34:49.680]  Russians so we'll get his take on that also course he's a former Marine Corps
[2:34:49.680 --> 2:34:53.920]  fighter pilot amazing stories with a carrier landings and mocked two events
[2:34:53.920 --> 2:34:57.320]  and things like that as well and maybe he'll tell us some of those on there
[2:34:57.320 --> 2:35:01.840]  today but I doubt we'll have time for that he told him the talk we had also his
[2:35:01.840 --> 2:35:07.400]  uncle wrote the naked communist and he's the editor of World Affairs brief and
[2:35:07.400 --> 2:35:13.400]  is a top expert in strategic relocation and creating secure homes in fact he
[2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:18.160]  wrote the secure home the the Bible on it but again enough of this bio you know
[2:35:18.160 --> 2:35:24.680]  who he is he joins us on the subject first the subject first of Obama mentor
[2:35:24.680 --> 2:35:29.440]  wanted Americans put in reeducation camps that came out in the federal cases
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:34.440]  and I have that video out dovetailed and they wanted 25 million killed they
[2:35:34.440 --> 2:35:38.360]  thought would need to be killed on those bases and it goes on leaked US Army
[2:35:38.360 --> 2:35:43.440]  document outlines plan for reeducation camps in America and it says get their
[2:35:43.440 --> 2:35:48.640]  social security numbers have psyops find out the political dissenters it's all
[2:35:48.640 --> 2:35:53.000]  in there it's for America and also overseas there's been a false debate
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:57.240]  about that but I've read it myself 300 pages can't over it we have screenshots
[2:35:57.240 --> 2:36:00.560]  of all the subsections to give us his take on this because we're just talking
[2:36:00.560 --> 2:36:05.320]  about it last week on air when he was in studio rounding up dissidents this is
[2:36:05.320 --> 2:36:09.000]  amazing because we know the camps are there but this is confirming they're
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:15.800]  even calling it the Stalinist or North Korean style reeducation camp this
[2:36:15.800 --> 2:36:21.280]  reeducation an amazing term to be using that they don't call it conditioning or
[2:36:21.280 --> 2:36:28.640]  reorientation or deradicalization they call it reeducation reeducation camps
[2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:33.400]  Joe Scalzen what do you make of this what we're talking about the army field
[2:36:33.400 --> 2:36:40.480]  manual the manual three dash 39.4 and this is a revised field manual from
[2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:44.960]  their normal prison camp training manual that they put out to the army this has
[2:36:44.960 --> 2:36:52.760]  been revised this Abu Ghraib so that it has the you know specific and and
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:36:57.160]  carefully worded concepts about not abusing principles of prisoners and
[2:36:57.160 --> 2:37:02.760]  not allowing detention has hey Joel your your phone's a little bit muffled I
[2:37:02.760 --> 2:37:07.280]  know you're on the road about to catch a plane are you on a hands-free no I'm
[2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:12.080]  on a cell phone do me a favor talk right into the receiver okay how's this
[2:37:12.080 --> 2:37:18.440]  it's a little bit better please continue all right in any case Alex you're
[2:37:18.440 --> 2:37:23.160]  exactly correct the article that you put out to and Paul Joseph Watson wrote
[2:37:23.160 --> 2:37:28.120]  for him for wars.com is something that everybody should see I've read the
[2:37:28.120 --> 2:37:35.880]  manual and it starts in fact give all of the details about how the army would
[2:37:35.880 --> 2:37:40.640]  implement the lockup of civilians and it talks about displaced civilians it's
[2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:44.920]  interesting when you read the whole manual it doesn't raise alarm bells
[2:37:44.920 --> 2:37:49.800]  with a normal army person because this is the typical thing we prepare for in a
[2:37:49.800 --> 2:37:54.240]  combat zone there will be civilians there will be displaced civilians and how
[2:37:54.240 --> 2:37:59.760]  you treat them but it does give certain hints that in fact this is going to be
[2:37:59.760 --> 2:38:04.720]  used on Americans it talks specifically about they will have to get a an
[2:38:04.720 --> 2:38:10.040]  exception to Positon the product and they will have to use executive power to
[2:38:10.040 --> 2:38:14.360]  get that exception and they will also seek to get a congressional
[2:38:14.360 --> 2:38:19.960]  resolution that we are under an insurgency and so it's very very clear
[2:38:19.960 --> 2:38:25.800]  that they put legal language in there to try to justify the reeducation of
[2:38:25.800 --> 2:38:29.880]  civilians they do talk about psychological operations officers how they
[2:38:29.880 --> 2:38:35.560]  will try to convince these dissidents about the benefits of American policies
[2:38:35.560 --> 2:38:43.600]  and actions so this is clearly a document aimed at army officers in order to not
[2:38:43.600 --> 2:38:49.760]  alarm them and that's why we have to be careful to say this does not give what
[2:38:49.760 --> 2:38:54.440]  the government is trying to do this is implementation to army officers and
[2:38:54.440 --> 2:38:59.120]  it's specifically written so it doesn't alert them to what the government really
[2:38:59.120 --> 2:39:03.440]  up to sure it's Riley it's a dryly written most military and police called
[2:39:03.440 --> 2:39:08.320]  in understood this but one guy called in and just said well this is for overseas
[2:39:08.320 --> 2:39:13.360]  this isn't for domestic and I just had the feeling it was a staged call it
[2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:20.240]  sounded sounded like a Psyop but clearly this is the aim domestically as well
[2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:24.160]  because they do mention Positon the product and the fact that they're
[2:39:24.160 --> 2:39:27.640]  going to have to get an exception now of course if you were a prisoner under
[2:39:27.640 --> 2:39:32.840]  that and you said look I've read the copy the man you're supposed to within 72
[2:39:32.840 --> 2:39:37.960]  hours give me a right of appeal it's time to have a determination of whether
[2:39:37.960 --> 2:39:41.600]  or not I'm under the Geneva Convention all that's right in your manual you know
[2:39:41.600 --> 2:39:46.120]  they'd probably just blow you off and say you know we don't have that stuff
[2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:48.880]  in front of us and you don't have a lawyer and you can't do anything to us
[2:39:48.880 --> 2:39:54.080]  but clearly the language is written in there not to offend the sensibilities
[2:39:54.080 --> 2:39:59.640]  of patriotic army officers they think there's simply going to be implementing
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:03.880]  something because of massive unrest that we have to control populations during
[2:40:03.880 --> 2:40:09.400]  a military operation within the borders of the United States well the point is
[2:40:09.400 --> 2:40:15.480]  this didn't just pop up today it's been a slow incremental across
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:21.440]  administrations continuity of agenda towards total control and then you've
[2:40:21.440 --> 2:40:26.720]  got the fact that this this is set up from what I've seen along a Soviet model
[2:40:26.720 --> 2:40:30.960]  Joel do you agree with that I mean all the terms being used reeducation loud
[2:40:30.960 --> 2:40:37.120]  speaker systems the whole way that this has been deployed and set up is is
[2:40:37.120 --> 2:40:42.640]  exactly what came out in the federal court case with Bill Ayers when they
[2:40:42.640 --> 2:40:47.720]  were planning to put conservatives libertarians constitutionalist in giant
[2:40:47.720 --> 2:40:55.080]  camps and kill 25 million of us well I do agree with you that this matches very
[2:40:55.080 --> 2:41:01.000]  clearly both the Soviet model and the and to a certain extent the Nazi Germany
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:06.160]  model but more like the Soviet model and even very disturbingly much like the
[2:41:06.160 --> 2:41:11.440]  North Korean model and so I think this is something they I mean it has been the
[2:41:11.440 --> 2:41:18.440]  in recent history it has been Vietnam Laos and China that have used in North
[2:41:18.440 --> 2:41:22.640]  Korea this the reeducation camps to the greatest extent these are the people
[2:41:22.640 --> 2:41:27.280]  that have the the top expertise including torture which this manual does not
[2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:32.400]  mention but and I think they're not going to tell the military that they're
[2:41:32.400 --> 2:41:36.640]  going to go back to that but once you get in these camps of course there are no
[2:41:36.640 --> 2:41:41.560]  rights there are no procedures you do as I say is what they tell you well we know
[2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:45.520]  from Abu Ghraib and other camps in Iraq we know from camp x-ray they have the
[2:41:45.520 --> 2:41:49.840]  general camp and they have a special torture camp for special personnel
[2:41:49.840 --> 2:41:56.560]  generally contractors or CIA where they take people and so but but expanding on
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:42:00.320]  that they even have paying compliance in jails now there are restraint chairs the
[2:42:00.320 --> 2:42:04.520]  billy clubs the the tasers undoubtedly they're going to be controlling the
[2:42:04.520 --> 2:42:10.120]  dissidents in these with torture but this is only two years old 2010 why do
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:15.400]  you think they're now upgrading it and using terms like reeducation reeducation
[2:42:15.400 --> 2:42:18.720]  camp I mean that's directly out of as you said Stalinist Russia and North
[2:42:18.720 --> 2:42:23.240]  Korea why not use a politically correct term
[2:42:24.120 --> 2:42:29.600]  well you know the the military and I'm a former military officer and I've had
[2:42:29.600 --> 2:42:34.080]  prison camp training as part of the Marine Corps as an officer and they've
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:39.720]  had psi ops the is a term that's been around since the 50s so that isn't
[2:42:39.720 --> 2:42:46.400]  particularly new reeducation is new you know it's probably slow accommodation of
[2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:50.760]  the American people to get them used to this but more so it's accommodation of
[2:42:50.760 --> 2:42:54.960]  American Army officers you know ever since the rise of Ron Paul as you know
[2:42:54.960 --> 2:43:01.160]  there has been a mini revolt going on in the military services against you know
[2:43:01.160 --> 2:43:05.560]  illegal actions and being called to that so the military's got a real problem I
[2:43:05.560 --> 2:43:09.520]  think one of the reasons for implementing this kind of language is to
[2:43:09.520 --> 2:43:14.080]  fair it out those who might object to it get them out of the service that's what
[2:43:14.080 --> 2:43:20.000]  all of the mercenaries involved in these past two wars have been involved in
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:26.560]  order to filter to vet to develop a cadre of frankly I'll use the word
[2:43:26.560 --> 2:43:31.360]  thugs people who don't have a conscience that will be able to implement this and
[2:43:31.360 --> 2:43:34.840]  they're reaping thousands of these people they don't have to bring in foreign
[2:43:34.840 --> 2:43:38.400]  troops they're gonna have plenty of Americans that would do this to Americans
[2:43:38.400 --> 2:43:43.200]  as long as they you know can separate the people that have internet access and
[2:43:43.200 --> 2:43:47.000]  understand what the agenda is and those that have come down yes man in the
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:50.060]  military that's why we're in a race you we talked privately at dinner about the
[2:43:50.060 --> 2:43:55.160]  TSA now we've confirmed they're now going to be in every city in town
[2:43:55.160 --> 2:44:01.320]  warrantless bag searches and the Secret Service CBS News today groping all over
[2:44:01.320 --> 2:44:08.640]  Chicago so the feds come to your town and start groping you for the furors
[2:44:08.640 --> 2:44:15.560]  safety it's clear the TSA is here to acclimate us to being stopped and then
[2:44:15.560 --> 2:44:19.120]  oh you're on the list you didn't you didn't know you're on the list you get
[2:44:19.120 --> 2:44:23.120]  put in the back of a squad car taken to a facility trucked to one of these
[2:44:23.120 --> 2:44:28.480]  reeducation camps but you know all of these these reeducation camps have been
[2:44:28.480 --> 2:44:34.360]  very very difficult to spare it out I believe that they are virtually all on
[2:44:34.360 --> 2:44:40.440]  dismantled or active duty military bases I have had my subscribers out
[2:44:40.440 --> 2:44:44.200]  searching for these and tracking down rumors of what they have and a lot of
[2:44:44.200 --> 2:44:49.440]  those rumors end up being false but we have confirmed that they do have them
[2:44:49.440 --> 2:44:54.360]  on on military bases the Nellis Air Force Base has one seen more job yeah
[2:44:54.360 --> 2:44:59.520]  it's generally right out in the middle and they call it a an internment training
[2:44:59.520 --> 2:45:03.880]  facility I mean they have I mean we've confirmed a bunch of them so they call
[2:45:03.880 --> 2:45:07.640]  them a training facility but they're sitting there waiting that's right I
[2:45:07.640 --> 2:45:12.800]  mean it's like the one at Nellis for example now Nellis has this prison camp
[2:45:12.800 --> 2:45:16.600]  system that's built right as part of the fence the triple fencing that goes
[2:45:16.600 --> 2:45:21.760]  around the nuclear warhead storage facility well it obviously serves dual
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:26.440]  purpose why put a prison camp right on the border of that fence if you aren't
[2:45:26.440 --> 2:45:31.000]  in in essence going to use double duty you put prisoners in there for a
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:36.480]  holdover if you have a massive influx of prisoners and why for example if
[2:45:36.480 --> 2:45:40.240]  Seattle do you have that big holding facility where they can fly people in
[2:45:40.240 --> 2:45:45.040]  ready for distribution and shipping out on rails this is the preparation for
[2:45:45.040 --> 2:45:49.080]  this kind of a thing I mean this facility in Seattle is massive this holding
[2:45:49.080 --> 2:45:52.320]  facility and it's nearly empty they just keep enough prisoners going through
[2:45:52.320 --> 2:45:56.920]  there to keep the staff there you go standpoint naval break that they've
[2:45:56.920 --> 2:46:00.760]  still got is in my film police state through the takeover at the local
[2:46:00.760 --> 2:46:07.720]  newscast where at the G 20 or no that was the WTO meeting in 99 they took
[2:46:07.720 --> 2:46:13.760]  thousands and put them in the quote old naval brig and FEMA ran it so that's my
[2:46:13.760 --> 2:46:18.360]  point they admitted sports stadiums its old brigs its old armories its old
[2:46:18.360 --> 2:46:23.080]  facilities we learned a lot in the emergency centers establishment act it
[2:46:23.080 --> 2:46:27.360]  said old bases how they do it that was an attempt to bring it out in the open
[2:46:27.360 --> 2:46:32.560]  and get more funding but it told us basically the whole blueprint and it's
[2:46:32.560 --> 2:46:36.080]  actually the Congress did and I confirmed this authorized funding to
[2:46:36.080 --> 2:46:39.840]  refurbish World War two prison camps but I've checked that out and there's
[2:46:39.840 --> 2:46:44.920]  nothing that's been active in that regard it could be done in the future but
[2:46:44.920 --> 2:46:49.440]  nothing has been done so those rumors are false right now about those being
[2:46:49.440 --> 2:46:55.720]  refurbished and ready to go it's incredible shifting gears well let me
[2:46:55.720 --> 2:47:00.200]  ask this question we'll get into the Russia situation the Russia threat the
[2:47:00.200 --> 2:47:03.640]  military is so awake and gave the majority of their contributions to Ron
[2:47:03.640 --> 2:47:09.000]  Paul I see that in calls on the streets the most awake group now is the
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:12.840]  military wasn't that case ten years ago but it's overwhelming and happening
[2:47:12.840 --> 2:47:16.720]  fast the military callers say half their buddies or all their buddies it's
[2:47:16.720 --> 2:47:20.800]  always above half but sometimes all generally about 70% are totally awake
[2:47:20.800 --> 2:47:25.480]  now to a certain extent they say what is the system going to do just because
[2:47:25.480 --> 2:47:29.320]  they've got a bunch of commas ours that want to put Americans in reeducation
[2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:32.400]  camps would love to you know get you and I and others in there and break our
[2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:36.840]  noses they're not going to get away with it the minute they try that it is
[2:47:36.840 --> 2:47:43.320]  going to be explosive I mean it to say the least well think blackwater think
[2:47:43.320 --> 2:47:47.800]  the special brigades of the mercenaries these are being increased all of the
[2:47:47.800 --> 2:47:52.280]  time these people are hungry for work I'll bet you will see more and more of
[2:47:52.280 --> 2:47:57.320]  these specialized mercenaries moving in to engage in this rather than ordinary
[2:47:57.320 --> 2:48:00.560]  troops because I think they would have a problem unless there was proper
[2:48:00.560 --> 2:48:04.920]  justification which they won't be obviously so I think you're right but
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:08.240]  they they know about this they know about this resistance that's why they
[2:48:08.240 --> 2:48:13.400]  are really restricting internet access to soldiers they're tracking it they
[2:48:13.400 --> 2:48:17.040]  tracking all of this stuff and I've talked to soldiers who have been
[2:48:17.040 --> 2:48:21.920]  chastised publicly for being on Ron Paul sites and engaging in what they call
[2:48:21.920 --> 2:48:27.360]  extremist literature you know it's just as bad as the chaplain's now being
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:32.080]  forced to or forced out of the service that they refused to service the gay
[2:48:32.080 --> 2:48:37.200]  community in the service with positive feedback in their chaplain service
[2:48:37.200 --> 2:48:44.200]  amazing there's been two new bombings in the Russian caucuses region and leaves
[2:48:44.200 --> 2:48:48.160]  at least 12 dead that's in the LA Times I just broke minutes ago let's start
[2:48:48.160 --> 2:48:53.280]  getting into the Russia situation this is unprecedented from what I've seen
[2:48:53.280 --> 2:48:57.360]  history and in modern times Russia threatens to strike NATO missile
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:49:01.360]  defense and that's in the Moscow newspapers in a meeting with NATO
[2:49:01.360 --> 2:49:07.040]  their their head general I guess all butcher's name Nikolai Mar how do you
[2:49:07.040 --> 2:49:15.280]  pronounce that Mar Argov Markarov Makarov said that said that if they begin
[2:49:15.280 --> 2:49:18.560]  to activate the missiles are before they're activated Russia's gonna attack
[2:49:18.560 --> 2:49:23.440]  them Joe Scalzen well the key is that they claim the right to preemptively
[2:49:23.440 --> 2:49:29.160]  strike them there's no way they're gonna go through with a preemptive strike
[2:49:29.160 --> 2:49:34.560]  without some justification but they've got preemptive out there now what's
[2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:38.320]  interesting about this is the State Department and the US military should
[2:49:38.320 --> 2:49:43.000]  be coming on and saying Russia has no excuse to be upset these are not capable
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:50.880]  of striking anyone these have no warhead so Russia is entirely mistaken you
[2:49:50.880 --> 2:49:56.040]  know the old fish grin about it they know better than that too you can't make
[2:49:56.040 --> 2:50:00.560]  an anti-missile system into an offensive weapon it has no warhead it
[2:50:00.560 --> 2:50:05.520]  can't do anything at all in fact it isn't even very effective against missiles
[2:50:05.520 --> 2:50:10.680]  but of course I believe our own globalist government is doing this on purpose
[2:50:10.680 --> 2:50:14.640]  not because they intend to really defend Europe there aren't enough missiles to do
[2:50:14.640 --> 2:50:19.120]  that I mean we just got a handful of them in fact it has really caused a
[2:50:19.120 --> 2:50:22.840]  backlash in the Czech Republic I've talked to people in Czechoslovakia who
[2:50:22.840 --> 2:50:27.320]  say they are hopping mad that they went out on a limb to accept
[2:50:27.320 --> 2:50:32.360]  anti-missiles in Czechoslovakia and the radar system and then the United
[2:50:32.360 --> 2:50:37.440]  States government pulled out and left us vulnerable to Russia he says now we have
[2:50:37.440 --> 2:50:41.520]  had most of the Americans leave Czechoslovakia and they're being replaced
[2:50:41.520 --> 2:50:45.560]  by Russian Russian businessmen Russian leaders are coming in to fill the
[2:50:45.560 --> 2:50:52.040]  vacuum because American is looked upon as an unreliable ally so all part of the
[2:50:52.040 --> 2:50:55.920]  globalist strategy to actually give provocation to the Russians to expand in
[2:50:55.920 --> 2:50:59.640]  the region we'll be right back stay with us show scousins our guests I'm Alex

[2:54:10.360 --> 2:54:15.160]  Joe Scalzen is our guest we're getting into the Russian situation so I might
[2:54:15.160 --> 2:54:18.360]  stole your thunder there or do you disagree as I went to break I'm saying
[2:54:18.360 --> 2:54:23.480]  is this just a way to give Russia a provocation to expand and a way to
[2:54:23.480 --> 2:54:29.240]  antagonize Russia what's the whole point of this well the entire missile system
[2:54:29.240 --> 2:54:34.280]  is meant to antagonize it's provoked Russia you are correct about that the
[2:54:34.280 --> 2:54:38.520]  Russians know as well as everyone else that these missiles are not fair to stop
[2:54:38.520 --> 2:54:42.200]  a rogue Iranian missile if you want to stop an Iranian missile you put them out
[2:54:42.200 --> 2:54:47.040]  on the border with Iran in fact Russia went to the extent of offering the US
[2:54:47.040 --> 2:54:54.080]  missile site on the border with Iran so that they could prove that the US wanted
[2:54:54.080 --> 2:54:58.280]  to keep them in Europe or aiming in the Russia now what this really means there's
[2:54:58.280 --> 2:55:02.680]  two points to why they make this threat of preemptively striking these
[2:55:02.680 --> 2:55:08.160]  missile sites number one they want to scare the former Soviet states like
[2:55:08.160 --> 2:55:12.760]  Poland into the fact that you're going to be the target of a nuclear attack if
[2:55:12.760 --> 2:55:18.240]  you accept these missiles or if you allow them to stay on your soil and that's
[2:55:18.240 --> 2:55:22.000]  so there is some pressure being applied and that's one of the pressures that
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:27.480]  made you know Czechoslovakia nervous when the US didn't back them up when the
[2:55:27.480 --> 2:55:32.400]  Russians issued their threat to Czechoslovakia the other thing is that
[2:55:32.400 --> 2:55:37.760]  they're giving fair warning that in fact and I'm convinced because that they
[2:55:37.760 --> 2:55:43.160]  will use tactical nuclear weapons not ICBMs to take out these sites they use
[2:55:43.160 --> 2:55:47.360]  tactical nuclear weapons to take out these missile sites before they launch
[2:55:47.360 --> 2:55:52.640]  their planned preemptive ballistic missile strike on the west because these
[2:55:52.640 --> 2:55:57.360]  missiles are primarily there in order to take out Russian missiles in the boost
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:56:02.600]  phase now we know from PDD-60 Alex that the US intends to absorb a nuclear
[2:56:02.600 --> 2:56:06.960]  first strike and not retaliate till afterwards when it's ineffective and
[2:56:06.960 --> 2:56:12.400]  when we have nothing or hardly anything left and so that is why I believe that the
[2:56:12.400 --> 2:56:18.360]  US you know will in fact allow these missile sites to be destroyed before
[2:56:18.360 --> 2:56:22.320]  Russia launches their preemptive nuclear strike which I'm not predicting
[2:56:22.320 --> 2:56:28.040]  until the early next decade so what do you expect Russia to do I mean does
[2:56:28.040 --> 2:56:32.040]  Russia normally just make threats to attack sites they say before they even
[2:56:32.040 --> 2:56:38.520]  get activated well once again I think the reason why it's being done now is to
[2:56:38.520 --> 2:56:44.360]  scare the former Soviet states into not cooperating in this manner with the
[2:56:44.360 --> 2:56:50.480]  West now remember that Russia intends to control and they still are to a large
[2:56:50.480 --> 2:56:54.880]  extent controlling the former Soviet states I've been talking to all of the
[2:56:54.880 --> 2:56:58.760]  dissidents whether it's in Hungary or Bulgaria and all of these so-called
[2:56:58.760 --> 2:57:02.480]  anti-communist leaders are actually former communists who are still communists
[2:57:02.480 --> 2:57:06.960]  and it was still got Russian advisors in there and when we let these people in
[2:57:06.960 --> 2:57:11.280]  the NATO it's just like having spies in the NATO and that's what our own
[2:57:11.280 --> 2:57:15.840]  globalist government intends but I continue to seek to expand NATO into
[2:57:15.840 --> 2:57:19.800]  the former Soviet states we're letting them in the backdoor and it's not going
[2:57:19.800 --> 2:57:23.280]  to turn out pretty for the West when the Russians finally decide to take back
[2:57:23.280 --> 2:57:30.160]  these former Soviet states. Joel Skalsen thank you so much for the analysis and
[2:57:30.160 --> 2:57:34.040]  the final equation I think this reeducation camp thing is really
[2:57:34.040 --> 2:57:38.840]  starting to wake some people up this has gone super viral yes I think so
[2:57:38.840 --> 2:57:44.360]  Caduce to your site on breaking the story Alex good job oh well no I mean it's
[2:57:44.360 --> 2:57:47.920]  just it's I'm just saying it's it's it's exciting though that the people are
[2:57:47.920 --> 2:57:52.480]  really starting to pay attention well it is if my emails I'm getting hundreds of
[2:57:52.480 --> 2:57:58.120]  emails today I can hardly keep up with it thanks to the warnings that your site
