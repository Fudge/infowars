[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  It's Sunday, January 22nd, 2023.
[00:10.000 --> 00:16.000]  This is the live Sunday edition and our shows.
[00:16.000 --> 00:35.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:35.000 --> 00:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, incredible developments have happened since I was last live with you Friday afternoon.
[00:42.000 --> 00:50.000]  Elon Musk has come out with a full article on his tweets that have something like 15 million retweets, hundreds of thousands of responses.
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  It's completely viral. He is now revealed the reason he really woke up with the shots is when he took the second one and almost killed him.
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.000]  He had to take it to go to Germany and look at his Tesla facilities there.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  Then his cousin, who's very young and a sports guy, almost died and has microcarditis and is destroyed.
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  And then there's just hundreds of thousands of people saying my daughter died, my mother died, my brother died.
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  I've had a heart attack. I'm in a wheelchair posting her medical records.
[01:13.000 --> 01:29.000]  It's over the top, but we've also got the Federal Reserve and the Central Bank here in the United States, the FDIC, preparing to do this.
[01:29.000 --> 01:40.000]  Canadian veteran and political activist Jeremy McKenzie, known as the Raging Dissident, was just notified that he can no longer do banking in Canada.
[01:40.000 --> 01:53.000]  As part of any of the relationships today, you're not to visit any of the Scotiabank branches or bank premises in person with their first getting written consent in advance from the bank for management.
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.000]  I'm banned from the bank.
[01:55.000 --> 02:05.000]  But it doesn't matter if you are a political activist or an obedient sheep, because the banks are planning on taking all of your money to pay off their debts.
[02:05.000 --> 02:14.000]  I mean, it's a little bit conflicted, right? I mean, it's important that people understand they can be bailed in, but you don't want a huge run on the institution.
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  But I mean, they're going to be.
[02:16.000 --> 02:27.000]  The FDIC currently has less than $200 billion in assets to insure over $9 trillion. That's just 1.3%.
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  They know that a system collapse is coming, and they are already planning for bail ins.
[02:33.000 --> 02:41.000]  As trust begins to fail, the people will begin to withdraw their funds, which will only guarantee a banking collapse.
[02:41.000 --> 02:52.000]  This is known as a bank run. In 2012, the International Monetary Fund, known for their reputation of coercion, violence, and extortion,
[02:52.000 --> 03:02.000]  published staff discussion notes entitled From Bail Out to Bail In, Mandatory Debt Restructuring of Systemic Financial Institutions.
[03:02.000 --> 03:14.000]  After the 2008 crisis, the world learned what a bail out is. Trillions of taxpayer dollars printed out of thin air to pay off the bankers' bad habits.
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.000]  It was hugely unpopular, but pales in comparison to a bail in. So what exactly is a bail in?
[03:21.000 --> 03:30.000]  It is officially obfuscated with elaborate equations, but to put it simply, it is when the bank steals your money directly from your account.
[03:30.000 --> 03:45.000]  They called it haircuts when they did it in Cyprus back in 2013, which the courts later ruled was legit, and a recent video on TikTok shows that the new bail ins may have already begun.
[03:45.000 --> 04:00.000]  I'm a bank of America, and everybody's missing money. I'm also missing money over $1,300, and they're telling me to call customer service, and they keep hanging up on people. There's another person here who's also missing money.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  So we're trying to see what's going on. Money's missing today, and we need our money, and they're telling us to call customer service.
[04:04.000 --> 04:16.000]  And customer service ain't doing nothing about it. So just to head top, is anybody experiencing this? Please let us know, because this is not right. I'm missing $1,400 from my account, and they're telling me that there is no way they can help us.
[04:16.000 --> 04:27.000]  This guy's missing money, too. This other person's missing money, too. You missing money, too? There you go. So this is not something that's just one person. Everybody's happening to them, and this is crazy.
[04:27.000 --> 04:39.000]  This is very crazy. Yes, Bank of America decided to take people's money without their consent, and we're asking what's going on, and they're giving us a run around. Everybody for the same thing now. Same thing.
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:43.000 --> 04:58.000]  All right, tell everybody, you know, tune in now. We always have incredibly important intel, but we've got over-the-top critical information tonight. Share the live feed at infowars.com.
[04:58.000 --> 05:14.000]  Go, go, go!

[06:16.000 --> 06:25.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:25.000 --> 06:34.000]  It was in late January last year, just about a year ago. You go back and pull up the headlines, as I did to check the date.
[06:34.000 --> 06:53.000]  But I came on air and said the deep state eugenicist, the mad scientist, and their biomedical tyranny takeover has blown up in their face, and they are going to have irrevocable problems that they're not going to be able to get their agenda through.
[06:53.000 --> 07:04.000]  But they would not give up, which would just make the situation that much more volatile and explosive. Thank you for joining us on this live Sunday transmission, reaching millions of people.
[07:04.000 --> 07:11.000]  Please share the local radio stations you're listening to, the TV stations you're watching, the cable stations you're watching, and the feeds you're watching at infowars.com.
[07:11.000 --> 07:33.000]  This is the report's live show in band.video and the new URL that takes you to a video feed that's not being censored, conspiracyfact.info. Well, a year later, let me say that they've gone from their agenda being doomed to their agenda being absolutely dead a year later
[07:33.000 --> 07:47.000]  and exponential anger and awakening to just how murderous and out of control these eugenicists are. Now, I can do the whole two hour show tonight. I'm going to be hosting longer into the third and fourth hour of the special event we're going to be covering.
[07:47.000 --> 07:52.000]  But let me just try to go over some of these headlines first for you.
[07:52.000 --> 08:06.000]  It felt like I was dying. Elon Musk trashed his COVID booster shot. Major side effects almost killed his cousin who's in great shape and younger than him with microcarditis. And then it didn't just get put out tens of millions of times via Twitter.
[08:06.000 --> 08:24.000]  I spent hours yesterday reading the comments. 99% of them anti shot posting their medical records. My son died. My daughter died. My mother died. My cousin died. Doctors saying they've seen it really hurt their patients, people posting medical records.
[08:24.000 --> 08:39.000]  Just this tweet alone could be studied for, again, a four year college education on medical tyranny, medical malpractice by design eugenicists, Dr. Minglob, 1,000.0.
[08:39.000 --> 08:52.000]  And again, I can only read and scan over a few hundred other comments because a lot of it was like Dr. McCullough was at the very top saying, here's an analysis of exactly what's happening, Elon, and why it got worse for you on the second shot and then other top scientists commenting.
[08:52.000 --> 09:04.000]  And you could spend years just trying to read, as of this morning, hundreds of thousands of posts to the tens of millions of retweets. This alone is encyclopedic.
[09:04.000 --> 09:16.000]  The gateway to that world is on infowars.com. If you want to read his tweets and then see the other key tweets that I sent to the writers, the great Jamie White have put together an article.
[09:16.000 --> 09:29.000]  So this right here is incredible. Here's just some of the things posted there. The Pfizer shot killed our beautiful 18 year old daughter. She hashtag died suddenly on November 9th.
[09:29.000 --> 09:39.000]  Elon Musk, please help us make this stop. Justice for Trista. Stop the shots now. Vaccine deaths. And then people just reminding folks what happened.
[09:39.000 --> 09:53.000]  Want to get your life, liberty and human rights back? Do what I tell you. Big highway signs, this on South 202 in the U.S. saying, want to return to normal, get vaccinated.
[09:53.000 --> 10:02.000]  The whole government lying to you and pushing poison on you and on their own employees. And then stuff like this. Scott Adams sees this happen.
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.000]  I like Scott Adams, but he came out, said the shot was safe. Take it when they weren't testing it and he knew it wasn't.
[10:09.000 --> 10:17.000]  And there have been previous studies done on rats with mRNA coronavirus vaccines that weren't vaccines. And the rats lived half as long.
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.000]  The mice lived half as long and a lot of them died very quickly from myocarditis, blood clots and strokes.
[10:23.000 --> 10:34.000]  I mean, that's a University of Texas initiative 2012, 13, 14, 15 by Barack Obama, ended up by Dr. Anthony Fauci. His name's on the initiative.
[10:34.000 --> 10:43.000]  So they tested the specific weapon. I told you that two years ago when our own researcher Rob do discovered it. Smoking gun.
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.000]  So Scott Adams just keeps saying, in his five minute video, we'll play a few minutes over here. Okay, you anti-vaxxers win.
[10:49.000 --> 10:56.000]  You were right. Learned immunities better. Looks like it doesn't work. Okay, you won. We don't want to win.
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  I don't want to be here 28 years ago telling you this was all coming and now we're living it.
[11:01.000 --> 11:08.000]  I don't want to be here in five years from now and you're saying, oh my God, it's true, billions are dead. I want to stop this, okay?
[11:08.000 --> 11:16.000]  Think I like the deep state coming after me. You think I like all the demonization attacks, but I like that a lot more than letting their agenda go all the way through.
[11:16.000 --> 11:24.000]  And we all live in a giant open air death camp. So here's a clip of what Scott Adams had to say, the full video and everybody's doing this.
[11:24.000 --> 11:31.000]  Suddenly BBC News has doctors on every day saying, my dad died, a bunch of my patients are dying, heart attacks.
[11:31.000 --> 11:39.000]  Oh my God, it's terrible. We were lied to somebody's got to be held accountable. I've got so many of these videos.
[11:39.000 --> 11:47.000]  I can't even remember all the ones I watched Friday and Saturday this morning. I can't pull myself away, but here's Scott Adams.
[11:47.000 --> 11:57.000]  The unvaccinated have a current advantage because they feel better. The thing they're not worrying about is what I have to worry about,
[11:57.000 --> 12:08.000]  which is I wonder if that vaccination in five years from now, because really the anti-vaxxers I think were really just distrustful of big companies and big government.
[12:08.000 --> 12:17.000]  That's never wrong. It's never wrong to distrust government. It's never wrong to distrust big companies, right?
[12:17.000 --> 12:25.000]  So if you just took the position, let's just distrust everything the government did, well, you won. You won.
[12:25.000 --> 12:37.000]  You won completely. I did not end up in the right place. Agree? You would all agree with that, right? I did not end up in the right place.
[12:37.000 --> 12:47.000]  The right place would be natural immunity, no vaccination. You should take victory and I should take defeat.
[12:47.000 --> 12:59.000]  We can agree on that, right? That my position is now the weakest and your position has gone from the weakest to the strongest and that we can just say that's true.
[12:59.000 --> 13:08.000]  Just stop there. Okay, and he just goes on and on and says, you win the intellectual argument. Hey, dude, we had an initiative by Fauci and Obama to create this thing.
[13:08.000 --> 13:19.000]  They knew it cut the life expectancy of rodents in half. They said it's about being right. It's about saving lives.
[13:19.000 --> 13:27.000]  And to his credit, he doesn't really say that in the video, but with his tweets he does, how do you interpret this?
[13:27.000 --> 13:38.000]  He starts showing the numbers that the vaccinated are more likely to get sick, more likely to be hospitalized, more likely to die, even in international and national studies.
[13:38.000 --> 13:47.000]  Meanwhile, we have the political fallout. Trudeau just had his little globalist WF twin removed in New Zealand. They just put some money in even worse.
[13:47.000 --> 13:57.000]  But here he is in a video with all the different premiers and their spokesperson in parliament saying we hate you.
[13:57.000 --> 14:04.000]  You put martial law in with the national emergency. You sit with a local emergency from the truckers. You're a dictator and should resign.
[14:04.000 --> 14:12.000]  It's in French, but they're subtitles. They just chew the living hell out of him. Then there's links to the three hour overall deal. No one's supporting him.
[14:12.000 --> 14:22.000]  They're like, how's he still in office? It's a parliament, so he only won by 30% of the vote. We're able to manipulate different parties together to do it, but he's gone to.
[14:22.000 --> 14:27.000]  They can shuffle a new puppet in there, but it won't matter. But that's the power they get out of this.
[14:27.000 --> 14:38.000]  Pfizer's CEO is questioned about the vaccine efficacy. He says it was constantly in our way. People asking if it was safe or not. We didn't know. Incredible video.
[14:38.000 --> 14:47.000]  Then also at Davos, another interview, he lies about the CDC coming out, the FDA saying they were lied to and that they think there's major signal of danger.
[14:47.000 --> 14:54.000]  He says they looked at it and it's totally safe. Another giant whopping lie because he knows he has secret liability agreements with the government.
[14:54.000 --> 15:00.000]  Here's national Australian news, Sky News, rising heart attacks across Australia and death.
[15:00.000 --> 15:10.000]  Overall deaths increased 13% in Australia, but heart attacks have increased 17%, the biggest increase ever recorded.
[15:10.000 --> 15:20.000]  Oh, and it's in the quote, vaccinated. Here's Tony Blair. It's not just about COVID. We're going to have a whole new slew of mRNA injections.
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.000]  We're going to make you take. I've got it all here, ladies and gentlemen. It's incredible.
[15:26.000 --> 15:38.000]  And that's just one stack. Then I've got what else happened to W.E.F., massive pedophile rings getting busted around the country with LGBT groups,
[15:38.000 --> 15:45.000]  grabbing CPS in Christian kids and then putting them in the sex dungeons. We always knew that was the case, that they're getting caught everywhere.
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  And they're just desperate. They're totally desperate that we know who they are and what they're up to.
[15:49.000 --> 15:59.000]  And the other giant, Satanic army of pedophiles were up against. I'm going to show you the evidence coming up.
[15:59.000 --> 16:19.000]  Well, I have fantastic stuff. Diet force is amazing. I'm 45 and I have bits. I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move. And diet force has helped me move those bits. Like, under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[16:19.000 --> 16:32.000]  Man, if you're struggling to get chip shaped for the ladies, diet force is the go. You have to get the diet force and have it to a day and just keep active.
[16:32.000 --> 16:38.000]  Infowarsstore.com, X7 diet force. Infowarsstore.com, baby.
[16:38.000 --> 16:46.000]  Now on sale. We're cutting that ad. We're cutting that call into an ad. I can guarantee you that. Thank you so much for the call, Grant. God bless Australia.

[16:50.000 --> 17:08.000]  I'm taking a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great effects. And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[17:08.000 --> 17:19.000]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[17:19.000 --> 17:26.000]  These products work great for women as well. Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD. It's the number one natural best seller under another name.

[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  Don't do it during the day.

[18:18.000 --> 18:28.000]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you to count the cost and realize that only your commitment to keep Infowars on the air will ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[18:28.000 --> 18:34.000]  They're coming for you and your family. They're coming for me. They're coming for the children. But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.000]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies. They're already given to the pregnant women.
[18:39.000 --> 18:51.000]  Miscarriages are off the chart. 80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots. We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[18:51.000 --> 18:58.000]  Let's do it together. And the fight starts at Infowars.com. And the fight continues with your financial support at Infowarsstore.com.
[18:58.000 --> 18:59.000]  Now take action now.
[18:59.000 --> 19:09.000]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, you know they may seem little, have a massive ripple effect throughout time and space. We're actually winning the Infowar.
[19:09.000 --> 19:18.000]  And when you realize that Band-Aught Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts whose information is beyond incredible.
[19:18.000 --> 19:24.000]  Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them right now telling the truth at Band-Aught Video.
[19:24.000 --> 19:36.000]  Millions of people today visiting Band-Aught Video. But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors and perfect strangers.
[19:36.000 --> 19:47.000]  You are the modern Paul Revere's. You are what takes our information and amplifies it. When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[19:47.000 --> 19:55.000]  So I thank you all for your past action and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[20:17.000 --> 20:37.000]  It's Sunday, January 22nd, 2023. I'm your host, Alexander Emerson Jones, broadcasting from the front lines of the fight against the Genesis death cult New World Order.
[20:37.000 --> 20:48.000]  Well, I knew the globalists were real and their plans for depopulation and world government were real when I was about 19 years old because my family had told me about it.
[20:48.000 --> 21:01.000]  But you know when you're a young person, you tend to tune out most of what your parents and grandparents and families say, even though I knew they were serious, very smart people, it just sounded like science fiction and something else going on in another world.
[21:01.000 --> 21:11.000]  But it was going on because they knew, because they were informed and they were involved at different levels of the system and seen it for themselves.
[21:11.000 --> 21:25.000]  And I have been battling these people for 28 plus years now on air. And before I hit the rest of the news, I just want to remind listeners that I am not proud of our work. I am proud of you.
[21:25.000 --> 21:38.000]  But it's not a feeling of pride, it's a feeling of love, and it's a feeling of satisfaction. It's not that pride's necessarily a bad thing, you're proud of your son, you're proud of your daughter, you're proud of your parents, your grandparents, you're proud of your country, you're proud of our veterans.
[21:38.000 --> 21:46.000]  But with me, it's not that feeling, it's a feeling of satisfaction and compulsion.
[21:46.000 --> 21:58.000]  And like breathing in a breath of fresh air, it's something you need, it's something you got to have, it's not like something that's on the side, it's primary, it's central.
[21:58.000 --> 22:05.000]  And now we're reaching the main point of the fight. They planned for us to be out of the air long before we hit this point. They're in deep trouble.
[22:05.000 --> 22:16.000]  But I got to tell you listeners, we've gone over the hump with legal bills and so many fights, and we won those fights so far staying on air, and now we're going into the appeals process, the rest of it will take years.
[22:16.000 --> 22:27.000]  And it's only after that big fight that then we're able to lick our wounds and repair some of the things that have happened and move forward.
[22:27.000 --> 22:41.000]  But we can't do that without you. So if you appreciate the work we've all done together, this crew, this audience, this whole family of info wars, and you want to see us continue on, it is absolutely critical that you understand.
[22:41.000 --> 22:49.000]  I need your support right now. I need you to go to 1776coin.com, the fourth and final coin.
[22:49.000 --> 22:59.000]  And by final, we may do coins in the future, but that can be part of this founding member series. It's the 1776. Teddy Roosevelt, man, the arena coin, there's only about 1200 left.
[22:59.000 --> 23:11.000]  And when they're gone, that's it. And yes, a normal silver round like this would cost $30. It cost $100 with promo code 7076, because it's a fund raiser.
[23:11.000 --> 23:20.000]  And you have that momentum. And I need the extra funds to be able to operate and continue on. Plus, it's a historic coin.
[23:20.000 --> 23:31.000]  So I want to thank those that got the coins. And I want to encourage those of you that do not have the coin and want to have this coin, no more of this type will ever be made again.
[23:31.000 --> 23:47.000]  To get the coin now at 1776coin.com. And if you want to support your body and fund info wars and fund this operation, go to infowarstore.com.
[23:47.000 --> 23:57.000]  That's infowarstore.com and get 1776 testosterone boost and pain MD.
[23:57.000 --> 24:04.000]  Both of these are number one bestsellers in the country. They're made by a pharmaceutical company that's huge, but they're patriots.
[24:04.000 --> 24:09.000]  It's small compared to the big ones, but it's still huge. $10 million a year. The owner's a listener.
[24:09.000 --> 24:19.000]  I said, what are your big best products about a year ago? And he gave me a list of 16 or so products out of hundreds they make that are number one or number two, depending on the product in the country, depending on which month it is.
[24:19.000 --> 24:28.000]  They're both tested, tried, loved, do a great job for pain reduction, naturally, and of course for boosting natural testosterone and free testosterone in the body.
[24:28.000 --> 24:36.000]  They're amazing. They're available exclusively with our private label and other places as well at infowarstore.com.
[24:36.000 --> 24:44.000]  And you heard Mike Adams on this week without me asking him saying, he's got a big lab that tests supplements and products. That's what he does.
[24:44.000 --> 24:50.000]  That guy's very prolific. He publishes books all over the world in Chinese, German, and everything else. That guy's a Renaissance man.
[24:50.000 --> 24:58.000]  He's got his own big farm, produces milk and everything. But the point is, is that he tests CBD oil.
[24:58.000 --> 25:05.000]  And he said, wow, this is like a super high-end, full-spectrum one. He was on the show, he used to be selling us for $150.
[25:05.000 --> 25:11.000]  Well, that's what I said before on air. They retail this for $150. They have it on sale for $100 in stores.
[25:11.000 --> 25:18.000]  They've actually sold a lot of places, clinics, you name it. And we sell it for $67. We can easily sell it for $100.
[25:18.000 --> 25:26.000]  I mean, that's just my instinct. A lot of people say, well, Jones used to charge $150 and then people think it has a higher value and you probably sell more.
[25:26.000 --> 25:32.000]  And that's a weird psychological thing that people like want the brand name, even though it's the exact same thing.
[25:32.000 --> 25:41.000]  So think of this as like generic. It's the same factory, the same bottle, just a different label, and you get it for less than half the price.
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  And we've already sold out of one of the CBDs. It's about to come back in, but the 1,000 milligram, the 25 milligram.
[25:46.000 --> 25:51.000]  And I would suggest you go with a low-power one at first. Doesn't get you high. Doesn't have any THC in it.
[25:51.000 --> 25:58.000]  Legal and all 50 states. But it's so good for pain, so good for inflammation, so good for your brain, so good for your heart.
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  And doctors, I can tell you, prescribe this all day. You know, it's not prescription. They tell you, go get a CBD.
[26:03.000 --> 26:10.000]  And I had a doctor prescribe me CBD for my knee and my Achilles three years ago, and that's when I was looking around different companies.
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.000]  I found out this company we get it from is the same group, the private labels, for my medical doctor and his clinic.
[26:16.000 --> 26:25.000]  He's one of the top-rated doctors in Central Texas. He's actually got clinics in Dallas and San Antonio and Houston, but I get to actually see him in his home office.
[26:25.000 --> 26:32.000]  He's a listener. And of course, he helped me out in thinking about coming out with the DNA Force Plus, because he sells a product.
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  It's basically that. We just made it even stronger. So that's what I do. I just bring in the very best stuff.
[26:36.000 --> 26:42.000]  So you really need to get the CBD oil as well from M4WarsMD and M4WarsTour.com, and that's what funds us.
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  But particularly, ladies and gentlemen, you see these headlines everywhere.
[26:47.000 --> 26:55.000]  Ones in bankruptcy is asking for $40,000 a month. Oh, he's rich. My legal bills are usually 50 grand a month.
[26:55.000 --> 27:02.000]  The court has ruled I have to pay 40% of the legal bills. And it sounds like a lot of folks have the deep state law firms, all of them after us.
[27:02.000 --> 27:09.000]  We've already had the show trials, already all the depositions, the hell of the last four years. Now the legal expenses are going way down.
[27:09.000 --> 27:19.000]  In fact, it was up to $100,000 a month I was personally paying just a few months ago with all those trials and all the rest of it having to have security and all the rest of it.
[27:19.000 --> 27:26.000]  So we're over the hump, but we got it now. We're so bloodied after that fight that now we need the funds.
[27:26.000 --> 27:37.000]  So when you go to 1776coin.com, part of that money goes to fund free speech and M4Wars, but part of it goes to fund me personally and other things I'm doing and other things I'm up to.
[27:37.000 --> 27:46.000]  And I'll just leave it at that. And soon everybody that's a founding member that got any one of these four coins and then no more five member coins are going to be getting a lot of benefits.
[27:46.000 --> 27:56.000]  You've already gotten some sent to your email, but amazing stuff in the next week in your email box. So get that final coin now before it sells out at 1776.
[27:56.000 --> 28:12.000]  1776coin.com, 1776coin.com and get the other great M4Wars Platinum products, 1776 Asteroom Boost, and of course, PainMD at infowarstore.com.
[28:12.000 --> 28:22.000]  But you can't get the last coins at M4Wars store. They're only available at 1776coin.com and Brainforce Plus, Brainforce Ultra, Amazing Neutrophics, they're about to sell out,
[28:22.000 --> 28:33.000]  and they are on massive 50% discount right now at infowarstore.com as well. We need funds, God keeps us honest, we're just right there at the breakeven point, so thanks for your support.
[28:33.000 --> 28:48.000]  I'm done plugging, we're going to plunge into all this news. I mean, I am massively prepared when we come back, but it is you that keep us on air, and if we had enough funds, I wouldn't even plug, but I've got to plug because we're in a debt battle just like America and the world are.
[28:48.000 --> 29:00.000]  We're a microcosm, everything else, so I thank you for keeping us in the fight. Go now to 1776coin.com. Go now to 1776coin.com. Thank you.
[29:00.000 --> 29:10.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes M4Wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[29:10.000 --> 29:19.000]  When we talk about the crew at M4Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[29:19.000 --> 29:28.000]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible.
[29:28.000 --> 29:37.000]  So for myself, the whole M4Wars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now to realize that M4Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[29:37.000 --> 29:47.000]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners never go to M4WarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[29:47.000 --> 29:53.000]  All at the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at M4Wars.com.
[29:53.000 --> 29:59.000]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to M4Wars.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[29:59.000 --> 30:13.000]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends. If we're so stupid, we let them kill us. We deserve it. Except children don't deserve it, do they?
[30:13.000 --> 30:32.000]  And I looked, and behold, a pale horse and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[30:32.000 --> 30:43.000]  Another translation is, I looked, and behold, a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him.
[30:43.000 --> 30:52.000]  A book of Revelation. Very serious times to be alive, folks. They're not just doing this as a one-off. This is the beginning of the rest of our lives. This is our fight.
[30:52.000 --> 30:59.000]  And I'm proud of humanity. The globalists even admit it's leaked. They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[30:59.000 --> 31:12.000]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[31:12.000 --> 31:36.000]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind. And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' Info Wars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[31:36.000 --> 31:59.000]  This is why they attack us. This is why we need your support. Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right. Join the resistance. Buy products. Donate to the cause. Share the links. Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[31:59.000 --> 32:07.000]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing Info Wars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[32:07.000 --> 32:17.000]  Because they know we're pro-human. They know we're telling the truth. They know we've got their number. They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[32:17.000 --> 32:43.000]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems. And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglonone and so much more to supercharge your body and to give your body the key elements and the key ingredients it needs to function at a proper level.
[32:43.000 --> 32:59.000]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny. This is Real Red Pill Plus sold out for two years, 50% off at infowarstore.com. Get the Red Pill Plus exclusively, infowarstore.com.
[33:14.000 --> 33:22.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:22.000 --> 33:40.000]  Alright, I'm about to branch out to a lot of other big news that's very important, but I wanted to finish up here with the poison COVID shots that they call a vaccine and how it's coming out everywhere that it's so deadly and total vindication.
[33:40.000 --> 33:50.000]  Now, I told you it's like that Hoosong, meet the new boss, same as the old boss won't get fooled again, but at least they're having to shuffle deck chairs on the New World Order Titanic.
[33:50.000 --> 34:01.000]  Jacinda Ardenin pushed total police state, the worst in the world except for Communist China, then Canada and Italy were close third and fourth.
[34:01.000 --> 34:12.000]  And she knew the polls showed right at 20% support between 19 and 22 depending on the poll, so she quit months ahead of the election coming up in October.
[34:12.000 --> 34:20.000]  But then they installed the new Prime Minister of New Zealand, Chris Hipkins. Now, this is what he said just a year ago.
[34:20.000 --> 34:33.000]  If you're not jabbed, we will come looking for you, so if you thought Jacinda Ardenin was crazy, look what New Zealand has now, but he's another WEF alumni.
[34:33.000 --> 34:40.000]  He said, why do I care about New Zealand? It's the same people that run our CDC and FDA.
[34:40.000 --> 34:47.000]  We've got a lawyer that's working with Robert Kennedy Jr. who needs no introduction joining us in here in just a moment.
[34:47.000 --> 34:56.000]  But here's the clip. I think early next year we'll be in the phase of chasing up people who haven't come forward to get their vaccination or have missed their bookings and so on.
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  So everyone will be able to get a vaccine between now and the end of the year.
[35:00.000 --> 35:09.000]  But of course, you know, and I want every New Zealander to come forward, but human behavior suggests that there will be some people that we have to actually really go out and look for.
[35:09.000 --> 35:15.000]  And some of that may spill into next year, but our commitment is everyone will have the opportunity to get the vaccine by the end of the year.
[35:15.000 --> 35:23.000]  Everyone will, but I can't say that, you know, that we're not going to have some hesitant people or some people who just haven't come forward that we don't have to go out and find next year.
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  Go out and find forced injections.
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.000]  Now we know how Elon totally turned against the shots. He had questions that it shouldn't be mandatory two years ago.
[35:31.000 --> 35:37.000]  Now we know that six months ago he had to go to his German plant. They made him take it to come into the country.
[35:37.000 --> 35:45.000]  The second shot almost killed him and it almost killed his cousin that's one of his best friends who's in great shape and a decade younger than him.
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.000]  And as much as his family got sick from it, because obviously when they gave Musk the shot, they had the ones that hadn't been overheated.
[35:50.000 --> 35:58.000]  The silver lining of this is a lot of the shots didn't hurt people because even an hour or so above 87 degrees ruins the Moderna and Pfizer shots.
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.000]  Remember, they're the exact same shot. Moderna is just four of the shots.
[36:02.000 --> 36:08.000]  Joining us is one of the top lawyers at the tip of the spear fighting this. We'll cover several other issues before he's got to go.
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  He's got to host his own show coming up in about 30 minutes.
[36:10.000 --> 36:17.000]  Robert Barnes, thank you for coming on. I mean, I said a year ago in late January that they would be defeated and it was over.
[36:17.000 --> 36:23.000]  It would just be a matter of time. I think we can say a year later everybody's turning against him across the board.
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.000]  The question is what do they do next? BBC every day is saying we were wrong. The shots are poison.
[36:28.000 --> 36:34.000]  It's a huge scandal of the ages. And I use the BBC. That's the government of Britain. That's government run.
[36:34.000 --> 36:39.000]  It's all over the news here. What the hell is going on? And what do you expect him to do?
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  Because the deep state is not going to back down in my research and history.
[36:43.000 --> 36:51.000]  Barnes, you're a savvy man and you're deeply in the middle of exposing Pfizer with lawsuits, with whistleblowers, from them covering this up.
[36:51.000 --> 36:58.000]  And we have Bordela obviously a few days ago in Davos saying, oh, we talked to the CDC. No side effects. Well, the CDC says very dangerous signals.
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  Where are we currently? What would you describe this moment right now?
[37:02.000 --> 37:08.000]  Well, there's a lot of pressure to crack the dam, but the institutional influence is still holding on.
[37:08.000 --> 37:17.000]  So like, I mean, to, you know, I mean, the, the, for example, that even though the military was forced to pull back on their vaccine mandate due to the passage of legislation,
[37:17.000 --> 37:29.000]  they were requiring it for people who are members of the reserves. Another example is, you know, the federal courts are still pushing back on allowing any kind of meaningful suit to go forward against either the CDC and the FDA,
[37:29.000 --> 37:35.000]  or the whistleblower claim brought by Brooke Jackson against the, against Pfizer directly.
[37:35.000 --> 37:41.000]  The biggest claim that would go into the heart of these issues is still pending with no discovery allowed, waiting for a motion to dismiss.
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.000]  So we're not out of the woods, but at least we know we're in the woods.
[37:45.000 --> 37:50.000]  Oh, absolutely. It's getting harder and harder for them to contain the truth.
[37:50.000 --> 38:03.000]  When your Elon Musk's of the world are coming out and saying the vaccine injured me, the vaccine caused a severe injury of my cousin, then that's, and it may have been part of the inspiration for him to take over Twitter and release.
[38:03.000 --> 38:10.000]  I mean, right now there's a big media dive going on of independent journalists into the Twitter files concerning Fauci.
[38:10.000 --> 38:16.000]  These will probably be the most damning Twitter files to be released entirely. So the system made institutional failures.
[38:16.000 --> 38:21.000]  You have, you see breaches in the dam repeatedly, breaks in the matrix repeatedly.
[38:21.000 --> 38:28.000]  You see it in the people being on BBC saying that these shots are dangerous, major medical professionals and doctors increased.
[38:28.000 --> 38:36.000]  I mean, every day, the way Robert Kennedy put it was every single day, they don't gain any converts. Every single day, we do.
[38:36.000 --> 38:48.000]  We're moving the football. They're not absolutely even Scott Adams who tried to be a cheerleader for the vaccines all the way through came out this week and said he was wrong and the vaccine critics were right.
[38:48.000 --> 38:56.000]  And he admitted the reason why he would got it wrong is he trusted government sources and media sources that that he probably shouldn't have trusted.
[38:56.000 --> 39:08.000]  So, you know, you have more and more people raising questions, challenging it, contesting it, doubting the institutional narrative. Even Benji Shapiro had to come out and say the vaccines weren't such a good idea.
[39:08.000 --> 39:18.000]  He misunderstood. He got the data wrong. So even these institutional narratives are breaking down amongst its own patrons and propagandizers.
[39:18.000 --> 39:24.000]  And so that's where they're getting into real risk. And the question is, when does it break through to the government?
[39:24.000 --> 39:29.000]  When does it break through to a federal judge? When do they get the message? It's time to hold these people accountable.
[39:29.000 --> 39:39.000]  But if you study history, even if the establishment is recalcitrant, something this big is not going to go away. And the more they try to suppress it, the more explosive it gets.
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  Absolutely. They're going to do everything possible and conceivable.
[39:42.000 --> 39:57.000]  And we saw that in Davos this past week. The WEF was saying, let's do more vaccines. Tony Blair was a big conspiracy theory when we were talking about vaccine passports being a predicate for a digital chip and a digital ID and a digital biometric system
[39:57.000 --> 40:01.000]  and a social credit system superimposed on that digital credit system.
[40:01.000 --> 40:11.000]  Well, what did Tony Blair say at Davos? He said, we need a digital passport system. We need to use the vaccines to create a permanent digital passport system.
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  So they're going to continue down their path.
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.000]  And of course, Robert, when you and I said that two and a half, three years ago, it wasn't because we just dreamed it up.
[40:18.000 --> 40:32.000]  The WEF and the UN with GG Ping had a four-year multinational research initiative to come up with a global ID based on a vaccine passport to create a global social credit score, carbon tax, universal basic income.
[40:32.000 --> 40:37.000]  So we knew their damn plan. We weren't making a prediction. We were telling them what was happening.
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.000]  It's like going to a play for the nutcracker like I did this year with my five-year-old and they give you a program.
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.000]  And if you've forgotten what comes next, you've got a five-page program tells you now this scene's coming up.
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.000]  I mean, we got the frickin' program.
[40:50.000 --> 40:57.000]  Absolutely. I mean, it's what you've been doing for several decades. It's just listening to what they themselves say, what they themselves write, what they themselves publish.
[40:57.000 --> 41:03.000]  Our mutual friend James Corbett put this out at the very beginning in his four-part Bill Gates documentary.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  Powerful.
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  All you got to do is follow what Bill Gates is up to and you can figure out what the plan is.
[41:08.000 --> 41:17.000]  Bill Gates has been obsessed with digital IDs, digital chips, digital banking, digital vaccines, population control, food control, all of this now.
[41:17.000 --> 41:28.000]  And how criminal is it that from day one, big pharma with intelligence agencies worked with dinosaur media and big tech to suppress not just the truth about the shots or the virus, but therapeutics.
[41:28.000 --> 41:34.000]  And that, to me, is a whole other crime just as big as the shot. I mean, this is Joseph Mingle stuff.
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.000]  Oh, absolutely. I mean, God bless President Trump, but if he paid attention, they ran a number on him.
[41:39.000 --> 41:50.000]  One of the key lies to get emergency use authorization for any of this, to get Operation Warp Speed ever there, was to convince President Trump and America that there were no therapeutics available.
[41:50.000 --> 41:57.000]  I mean, they came after anybody who was talking about silver, talking about vitamin D, talking about zinc, talking about ivermectin.
[41:57.000 --> 42:04.000]  Now, talking about exercise, talking about the sun. You know, I mean, I got the winter sun, Info Wars product right behind me.
[42:04.000 --> 42:10.000]  They were saying all these things. No, these things couldn't help stop COVID. These things couldn't be a therapeutic. These things couldn't help you.
[42:10.000 --> 42:25.000]  Now they admit all those things can help you. But they hid that. Why? Because of this forced vaccine treatment, never would have got off the ground if the world would have known there were successful therapeutics already available that were more likely to be successful than the vaccine has ever proven.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  Here's the cherry on top. We'll come back with other issues.
[42:28.000 --> 42:40.000]  Fauci from 2009 to 2015, this is mainstream news. Looking up, we've covered it, ran a Pentagon initiative trying to find a cure treatment for SARS and coronavirus COVID-like stuff out of China.
[42:40.000 --> 42:48.000]  And they found hydroxychloroquine and also the so-called horse pace, ivermectin, were almost 100% effective.
[42:48.000 --> 42:56.000]  That was all out of Pentagon study reports, and they knew it in a Fauci study out many years ago. Incredible evil.
[43:19.000 --> 43:28.000]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.

[45:59.000 --> 46:12.000]  There's a war against our masculinity. There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[46:12.000 --> 46:20.000]  But through Mother Nature, the Creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[46:20.000 --> 46:27.000]  And I got to tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game changer now. We've never put anything out that's powerful.

[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  Have the guts, got the glory.
[47:26.000 --> 47:34.000]  With the distance, now I'm not gonna stop just a man, having his will to survive.
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.000]  It's the eye of the tiger.
[47:37.000 --> 47:46.000]  Really ought to be our theme song, all of ours. All the patriots, black, white, old, young, gay, straight, all of you that knew the truth about the new world order and the deadly shots of the tyranny.
[47:46.000 --> 47:54.000]  And you didn't care what the propaganda say, you didn't care if you got censored, you didn't care if you got debanked, you didn't care if you got attacked, you did the right thing.
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  You're the tiger.
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  Woo!
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  I got a four or five issues I want to hit because you gotta leave, you're gonna be back.
[48:01.000 --> 48:07.000]  Mary Simpson was for a full hour, but Robert Barnes, great constitutional lawyer, one of the smartest guys I know as a historian.
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  How would you quantify this moment in the awakening we're at?
[48:10.000 --> 48:16.000]  And then I want to hit them raiding Biden's house now, I'm finding a third tranche of documents, what that signifies.
[48:16.000 --> 48:23.000]  Again, it seems like the Stephen Crowder daily wire fight is beneath the radar, not saying Crowder isn't important or they're not important, I'm saying.
[48:23.000 --> 48:34.000]  Little squabbles aren't important, but this is a little squabble, this shows how, by frankly Fox News and the Mockingbird operation controls the conservative nationalist movement will hit that before you leave.
[48:34.000 --> 48:46.000]  But just what do you want to say to the troops out there? Because they need a real, real salute. I'm not a guy that just rah rah rah, but when it's time to have, when we've had big victory, we should have a little bit of a spiritual celebration.
[48:46.000 --> 48:54.000]  Oh, no doubt about it. I mean, the bottom line is because we were on the front lines and because the infor's audience was on the front lines and stayed in the fight, didn't go away.
[48:54.000 --> 49:04.000]  All the law fair, all the political, all the deep platforming, all of it was intended to suppress and censor and shame the audience into going away.
[49:04.000 --> 49:12.000]  I mean, the lawyer made it explicit in Connecticut, said the whole goal and objective isn't to recover money for anybody, it's to shut down infowars.
[49:12.000 --> 49:20.000]  And the best way to get that is to get the audience to run away, to high and think about how much pressure has been brought on this audience over the last several years.
[49:20.000 --> 49:30.000]  Their jobs were threatened, their ability to travel was threatened, their ability to send their kids to school was threatened, their ability to do basic, their ability to basic access to medical care was threatened.
[49:30.000 --> 49:41.000]  They were told they were criminals, they were told they were murderers, but they did the research and the medical experts went public and the heroes went public and we have won a major victory. We're winning right now, aren't we, Barnes?
[49:41.000 --> 49:55.000]  No doubt about that. When you have billionaires like Elon Musk buying Twitter to out and expose the deep state because in part he was injured by this vaccine, that's what's going to happen because guys like Musk are paying attention to the whole audience too.
[49:55.000 --> 50:04.000]  And so when they see, hey, these people out here are saying that this is a dangerous product, but all the big people tell me it's not. So I go with the big people and it turns out it was a dangerous product.
[50:04.000 --> 50:10.000]  Maybe I need to reexamine what's happening in the world and use my wealth and power to open the door on the truth.
[50:10.000 --> 50:26.000]  And even if Musk isn't perfect, he can see which way the wind's blowing and that Liberty's going to win. This is a real, and Scott Adams and all of them, the BBC and ABC and CNN coming out and saying the mass didn't work and locking kids down didn't work and sorry, the shots really didn't work.
[50:26.000 --> 50:36.000]  They are capitulating. So any way you slice it, it is victory. Let's talk about Joe Biden and this rain on his house by the FBI yesterday.
[50:36.000 --> 50:44.000]  Yeah, I mean, I mean, apparently you can walk out of your footstep, you know, walk out your door and run into some classified documents that Joe Biden had stored.
[50:44.000 --> 50:54.000]  So I mean, there's been so much confession through projection. One of my favorite principles out there. Somebody accused you of something weird. Listen to it. They're probably confessing their own crimes.
[50:54.000 --> 51:09.000]  People at the Democratic Party has talked about Trump for five years, six years, and basically they were confessing Biden's own crimes. And what it is is like, why did they claim they claim Trump had classified documents because he was trying to sell them to for or monetize them for his personal game to
[51:09.000 --> 51:16.000]  foreign governments. Trump never did that. Trump had documents that embarrassed the deep state who did have documents in order to prop it.
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  And he was the president. He was allowed to have a Biden got this news vice president.
[51:20.000 --> 51:31.000]  Not only that, he had some of these back from his Senate days. So he's been storing the using his access to classified materials to monetize it, use his family to be the ones to go out and be the front guys.
[51:31.000 --> 51:37.000]  That's why it's not a coincidence that Hunter Biden was living at the house where these documents were stored.
[51:37.000 --> 51:51.000]  He was a known Chinese communist spy in his own audio recordings, working with the head of Chinese intelligence, 50,000 a month to pay for the house as a safe house for the chai comms. But clearly they're wanting to get rid of Biden now.
[51:51.000 --> 52:01.000]  Oh, they do. But the problem is they have an idiot in Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris's staff hates her. Kamala, the country hates her. Every poll shows she does worse than Biden.
[52:01.000 --> 52:08.000]  And that she's so unlikable, they would like to Spiro Agnew her. You know, like what they did to Nixon when they they took Spiro Agnew.
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  They used taxes on him. Yeah.
[52:10.000 --> 52:18.000]  Exactly. And that allowed them to take Nixon out as Tucker Carlson just talks about. We've been talking about that conspiracy going on for four years.
[52:18.000 --> 52:22.000]  Well, credit to Tucker Carlson for publicly talking about it on Fox News.
[52:22.000 --> 52:25.000]  And we're going to play that report in the first little segment coming up. Guys, get it ready after you leave.
[52:25.000 --> 52:35.000]  Because of time, let's shift gears. I can talk to you for five hours, Barnes. Let's get into the media calls a circular firing squad between Stephen Crowder and Ben Shapiro.
[52:35.000 --> 52:41.000]  But that's not. He said, I don't want the 50 million, which was over five years with bandwidth and crew. That's not that much money, folks.
[52:41.000 --> 52:46.000]  That ain't worked that much. I can tell you what it takes to run this. He's running a similar operation.
[52:46.000 --> 52:54.000]  So he leaves the blaze. He goes to them. They send him a contract saying a big tech censors you. You're locked in the contract for five years, but you're not going to be paid any money.
[52:54.000 --> 52:59.000]  He said, this is insane. I'm not taking the deal. But what about your people? He goes, well, they're wage slaves.
[52:59.000 --> 53:05.000]  Then they spun it that he was mad and wanted more money. So he releases a recording showing that wasn't it. He had to.
[53:05.000 --> 53:10.000]  People said, oh, he's a bitch releasing that. He's only recorded people three times. I don't record people very often.
[53:10.000 --> 53:15.000]  But I deal with Megan Kelly because when it's that evil, you should record it. Give us your take on it.
[53:15.000 --> 53:22.000]  Absolutely. I mean, the contract wasn't a 50 million dollar contract. The contract was an indentured servitude contract to be loyal to big tech.
[53:22.000 --> 53:29.000]  You lose your money for the next six years. You do the math. I mean, we've done these kind of contracts. We've seen these kind of contracts.
[53:29.000 --> 53:36.000]  It's common in the entertainment industry, sadly. It's a classic old record executive where, oh, you might get this if you do everything we say.
[53:36.000 --> 53:43.000]  Exactly. It's a contract that puts a big dollar amount up front that makes you tempted to take it. Then you dig into the details and you find out what this deal did.
[53:43.000 --> 53:52.000]  Stephen Crowder was going to have to pay the daily wire money to produce his own content and they daily wire would keep all of the profits.
[53:52.000 --> 54:02.000]  It was literal indentured servitude. If Big Tech censored him, he owed them money under the contract. They didn't owe him anything and they owned him for up to six years.
[54:02.000 --> 54:13.000]  It was a unilateral provisions in place. So the contract wasn't a 50 million dollar contract. It was, hey, Stephen Crowder, be an indentured servant, be loyal to Big Tech, or be, that's your choice.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  Either be loyal to Big Tech or you're going to be an indentured servant.
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  And I even said be our slave on the audio.
[54:19.000 --> 54:34.000]  No, that's exactly what it was all about. It was about the daily wire was founded by a billionaire family out of Texas connected to natural gas and fracking that's involved in a real religious, weird religious movement,
[54:34.000 --> 54:42.000]  that backed Ted Cruz, that founded the daily wire to take out Breitbart and Bannon to try to take out the populist wing of the Republican Party.
[54:42.000 --> 54:50.000]  Jeremy Boring has admitted that it being an anti Trump platform was their foundation. They were backed by spook related money and spook related sources.
[54:50.000 --> 54:57.000]  Their goal. It's not a coincidence. They were big backers of Ted Cruz. It's not a coincidence. They were big Trump haters. It's not a coincidence.
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  They've horded for every war in existence.
[54:59.000 --> 55:07.000]  Now, there's no doubt that if you're going to control the opposition, you should lead it. And it's 100% that Ben Shapiro is a figurehead.
[55:07.000 --> 55:14.000]  And there's some good people the daily wire. I don't want to attack them all, but I'm going to tell you folks, they are worse than the Democrats.
[55:14.000 --> 55:20.000]  They are the Judas Goats. They are Judas Iscariot. Ben Shapiro is Judas Iscariot.
[55:20.000 --> 55:27.000]  Absolutely. I mean, and then he comes out and he lies about the contract. He lies about Stephen Crowder. He lies about the negotiations.
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  That's what these be. It's not a coincidence.
[55:29.000 --> 55:33.000]  And then we saw the Twitter bots turn on against Crowder. That's what you know. Sorry, go ahead.
[55:33.000 --> 55:40.000]  Look at the institutional media. All the media was anti-Crowder. That was their spin on this. The Reuters, AP, Young Turks, Media Matters,
[55:40.000 --> 55:47.000]  all those organizations all took the spin for the daily wire against Stephen Crowder.
[55:47.000 --> 55:53.000]  I think Crowder stumbled into this. Crowder didn't realize he was stumbling into an operation mockingbird operation.
[55:53.000 --> 56:03.000]  But I mean, to give people an idea, the daily wire is backed by billionaires. Probably a billion-dollar company makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
[56:03.000 --> 56:08.000]  This deal was done in order to lock up and co-op and control and cabin and contain conservative voices.
[56:08.000 --> 56:15.000]  Which is what Fox News has been doing forever. Which is what Fox News did forever.
[56:15.000 --> 56:21.000]  Absolutely. You couldn't have a bigger contrast than the daily wire and info wars.
[56:21.000 --> 56:27.000]  See, what is, is a lot of people who follow the daily wire, they follow, you know, Candice Owens can say some really good stuff.
[56:27.000 --> 56:31.000]  Andrew Clavin can say some really good stuff. They sometimes say really good stuff.
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.000]  But when you need them, the leaders of the daily wire are on the wrong side.
[56:36.000 --> 56:43.000]  They're pro-shot. They're pro-New World Order. Absolutely. They're anti-gun.
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.000]  Absolutely. That's who they are. And that's the definition of controlled opposition.
[56:47.000 --> 56:53.000]  There's no opposition on some things where we share alignment, but they'll be controlled on the big issues that threaten deep state power.
[56:53.000 --> 56:58.000]  That's the difference between, I mean, I always say how they respond to Alex Jones describes it.
[56:58.000 --> 57:03.000]  Do they embrace defending free speech? No, no, no. Ben Shapiro supported my banning.
[57:03.000 --> 57:07.000]  All right, Barnes, great job. We should support Stephen Crowder all the way.
[57:07.000 --> 57:10.000]  Anybody that does it is a complete idiot. People go, well, he's not hardcore enough.
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.000]  Well, he ain't run by the deep state. And I wish Crowder would have listened to me.
[57:13.000 --> 57:18.000]  You got to leave the blaze. You got to do your own product sales direct. You'll be totally free.
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.000]  And then I can work for Crowder. And I love Crowder.
[57:21.000 --> 57:25.000]  The point is, is that he's got to break with him. He gets it now.
[57:25.000 --> 57:30.000]  He thought he was leaving something bad with the blaze. He jumped right out of the fire into Hades itself.
[57:30.000 --> 57:36.000]  Speaking of that clip of Tucker Carlson talking about Nixon, it's powerful. It's coming up next.
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.000]  Second hour is right ahead. Robert Barnes, thank you so much.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  Absolutely. Glad to be here.
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  He's got his own podcast coming up in about two minutes.
[57:44.000 --> 58:12.000]  We'll be right back with our number two info wars.com forward slash show.
[58:12.000 --> 58:17.000]  Right now, telling the truth at Band-Aut Video. Millions of people today visiting Band-Aut Video.
[58:17.000 --> 58:22.000]  But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect,
[58:22.000 --> 58:26.000]  and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, and perfect strangers.
[58:26.000 --> 58:32.000]  You are the modern Paul Revere's. You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[58:32.000 --> 58:37.000]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[58:37.000 --> 58:42.000]  So I thank you all for your past action and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now
[58:42.000 --> 58:50.000]  because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[58:50.000 --> 58:56.000]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove
[58:56.000 --> 59:05.000]  showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[59:05.000 --> 59:10.000]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans
[59:10.000 --> 59:15.000]  for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[59:15.000 --> 59:22.000]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' info wars and our audience
[59:22.000 --> 59:27.000]  were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[59:27.000 --> 59:32.000]  This is why they attack us. This is why we need your support.
[59:32.000 --> 59:36.000]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[59:36.000 --> 59:42.000]  Join the resistance, buy products, donate to the cause, share the leaks,
[59:42.000 --> 59:51.000]  join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[59:51.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  And we are back live at hour number two of this Sunday broadcast.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  I'll be hosting end to the third and fourth hour with a very important film we made.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  Please stay with us so much coming up, but since Robert Barnes mentioned it,
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  here, I was on the fence while I was going to play or not, but here's an out of the park report
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  done Friday by the amazing Tucker Carlson on the real Richard Nixon.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Here is this report. We'll be right back.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  So if you want to understand, if you really want to understand how the American government actually works
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  at the highest levels, and if you want to know why they don't teach history anymore,
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  one thing you should know is that the most popular president in American history was Richard Nixon.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  Richard Nixon. Yet somehow, without a single vote being cast by a single American voter,
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  Richard Nixon was kicked out of office and replaced by the only unelected president in American history.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  So he went from the most popular president to a president nobody voted for.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  Wait a minute, you may ask. Why didn't I know that? Wasn't Richard Nixon a criminal?
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Wasn't he despised by all decent people? No, he wasn't.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  In fact, if any president could claim to be the people's choice, it was Richard Nixon.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  Richard Nixon was reelected in 1972 by the largest margin the popular vote ever recorded before or since.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  Nixon got 17 million more votes than his opponent.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  Less than two years later, he was gone. He was forced to resign.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  And in his place, an obedient servant of the federal agencies called Gerald Ford took over the White House.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  How did that happen?
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  What's a long story, but here are the highlights, and they tell you a lot.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  Richard Nixon believed that elements in the federal bureaucracy were working to undermine the American system of government
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  and had been doing that for a long time. He often said that. He was absolutely right.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  On June 23, 1972, Nixon met with the then CIA director Richard Helms at the White House.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  During the conversation, which thankfully was tape recorded, Nixon suggested he knew, quote,
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  who shot John, meaning President John F. Kennedy.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  Nixon further implied that the CIA was directly involved in Kennedy's assassination, which we now know it was.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  Helms' telling response? Total silence.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  But for Nixon, it didn't matter because it was already over.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  Four days before, on June 19, the Washington Post had published the first of many stories about a break-in at the Watergate office building.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  Unbeknownst to Nixon and unreported by the Washington Post, four of the five burglars worked for the CIA.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  The first of many dishonest Watergate stories was written by a 29-year-old metro reporter called Bob Woodward.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  Who exactly was Bob Woodward?
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  Well, he wasn't a journalist. Bob Woodward had no background whatsoever in the news business.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  Instead, Bob Woodward came directly from the classified areas of the federal government.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  Shortly before Watergate, Woodward was a naval officer at the Pentagon. He had a top-secret clearance.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  He worked regularly with the intel agencies.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  At times, Woodward was even detailed to the Nixon White House where he interacted with Richard Nixon's top aides.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  Soon after leaving the Navy for reasons that have never been clear, Woodward was hired by the most powerful news outlet in Washington
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  and assigned the biggest story in the country.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  And just to make it crystal clear what was actually happening, Woodward's main source for his Watergate series was
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  the deputy director of the FBI, Mark Felt.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  And Mark Felt ran, and we're not making this up, the FBI's COINTELPRO program,
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  which was designed to secretly discredit political actors the federal agencies wanted to destroy.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  People like Richard Nixon.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  And at the same time, those same agencies were also working to take down Nixon's elected vice president, Spiro Agnew.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  In the fall of 1973, Agnew was indicted for tax evasion and forced to resign.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  His replacement was a colorless congressman from Grand Rapids called Gerald Ford.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  What was Ford's qualification for the job?
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Well, he had served on the Warren Commission, which absolved the CIA of responsibility for President Kennedy's murder.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  Nixon was strong armed into accepting Gerald Ford by Democrats in Congress.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  Quote, we gave Nixon no choice but Ford, Speaker of the House Carl Albert later boasted.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  Eight months later, Gerald Ford of the Warren Commission was the president of the United States.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  See how that works?
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  So those are the facts, not speculation, all of that actually happened.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  None of it's secret, most of it actually is on Wikipedia.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  But no mainstream news organization has ever told that story.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  It's so obvious, yet it's intentionally ignored.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  And as a result, Permanent Washington remains in charge of our political system.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  Unelected lifers in the federal agencies make the biggest decisions in American government and crush anyone who tries to rein them in.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  Permanent? Permanent dictatorship.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with so much more.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  In hour number two, stay with us.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  Proud of us, you will then be my slaves.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  And then you'll get that special shot of freedom from Cobra, it will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  I'm proud of about four and a half, 5,000 people, just a few hundred yards away where the British Prime Minister was meeting with the real leaders of the world.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  And I looked at those mainly English people, those British people, and I said to them, this is very important, please listen to me.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  I said, you know where 1776 came from?
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  Do you know why America and the 13 colonies was able to be born out of the 13 colonies?
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  It was because early in the beginning of the war, for at least a year, the British Parliament voted against the war, because they'd already had a similar revolution there that George Washington's grandfather and others had been involved in,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  that had spilled over to the colonies of that we the people had a right to be free.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  And so America was founded by predominantly Englishmen and also Germans and Dutch and Irish and the rest of it who wanted freedom.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  Doesn't mean they moved the ball way down the field, but they certainly began to move it down the field to where we are today.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  And I got that crowd of almost 5,000 people, the local police estimated, to chant the answer in 1984, 1776.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  It was not an anti-English slogan, it was an anti-King George III of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha who wasn't even English slogan.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  So they understood that and they knew that, and that's why this is so important.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  Listen to me carefully while I'm explaining this little historical piece.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  The main reason, and George Washington wrote about this in letters and speeches he gave before he died,
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  that the colonies and the new country America, the United States of America and those 13 stars, were able to succeed,
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  he said was the courage and the will of the soldiers and that minority of Americans, less than 4% at the start, that supported the rebellion.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  And that they had the cause of right on their side and that God oversees battles and revolutions and those are his famous speeches.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  But he said if it wasn't for three groups he listed the French that were supporting a war against their enemies,
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  they were in a current war with the British, and then he said,
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  English soldiers that knew our fight was right and gave us intel and joined us, either openly or covertly,
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  and German, Prussian, Hessian trained from birth soldiers.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  And so it was George Washington in letters to different commanders and others and the British were able to infiltrate his command
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  and get Benedict Arnold to turn against him in the last few months of the war as well.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  This was going both ways. There was an ideological communication between both sides of,
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  why don't you join us, we really are the good people.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  That's what George Washington was saying to the British soldiers and to the German soldiers.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  And the British were coming back and saying, we'll give you a thousand pounds, ten thousand pounds,
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  equivalent of millions of dollars, join us, you can move back to London to Benedict Arnold, he took the money.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  So the British offered money, the British government, the globalist government, the empire of the time,
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  but George Washington offered honor and he said, this is wrong, you fought for this in England,
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  join us, report what's happening, help us win.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  And it was British soldiers and officers that gave us the intel to win after five years of us losing.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  They believed in our cause. They saw the atrocities committed against the colonies, against the fledgling Americans.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  That's what George Washington executed a lot of troops.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  If you raped somebody, you were dead. If you pillaged, you were dead.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  He told them every day when they had a chance, it wasn't every day, but every time they had a chance to have formations,
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  he told them, you do one thing unbecoming, I'm going to hang your ass.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  I don't care if the British are burning down churches and raping women, I don't care what they're doing, we don't do that.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  That's not who we are, God's watching.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  We have the moral superiority and that got the British officers and others to give us the intel to win
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  and it was even worse with the Hessians, the defection.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  Some estimates are half the Hessians trained from birth be war soldiers, way more vicious than the British,
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  seen as the pit bulls, the attack dogs. They came here and saw this freedom and saw these Germans that were there
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  with these farms and ranches and the women and other families and they said, I want to be, why are we attacking you?
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  And they defected.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  So I'm going to say to the bureaucrats and the government and the media people and the intelligence agencies
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  and the FBI and the Justice Department and the academics and all of you,
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  you signed on to pure destruction and having our power cut off and our borders collapsed in total hell.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  I know George Washington had a little bit harder sell to those leaders and those soldiers, my sale is so easy.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  You should go against this pure evil. This isn't even a choice.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  It's a death cult. It's a circular firing squad.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  It's a purposeful sell out to pure destruction to not join us.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  This isn't just the second American Revolution we're involved in. This is 1776 worldwide and it belongs to people in Mexico
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  and people in Africa in Nigeria and South Africa and the Congo.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  It belongs to people in Brazil. It belongs to people in Japan and Russia and Germany and France and the Netherlands
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  and everywhere else of being free. We will win, guys.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  Some of us on the front lines aren't going to make it, but that's okay. God's watching. It's eternal.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  I'll wake up next level just like that. God's already rewarded me so much.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  It's a personal relationship and I'm going to get into it, but I'm at a whole other level and it's just such a blessing
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  and all God gets all the glory and everything else, but I just want all of you to still have a feeling of liberty in your heart
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  and still are even listening to me because if you work for the system as an analyst watching us right now
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  and deep inside you feel excited. You feel a tickle in your spine. You get tears in your eyes.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  You want to join us. It's a spiritual decision. You don't have to send us intel on the end.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  I mean, you don't have to do any of that. You just got to say to God, I repent. I'm sorry.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  I paid for abortions, folks. I've killed my children. I've done stuff far worse than most of the evil operatives watching have done.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  I don't tell those stories. The left always goes, why does he admit that it was anti-abortion? That's the whole point is I know it's wrong.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  It's the same thing to you. I've done more bad things to people than most of the bad people tuning in have done.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  I didn't just kill my children and I never started a fight, but I did enjoy it when I was younger.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  And if you did hit me, I would beat you to death. I'd beat you till you were in a coma and I repent of that now.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  I don't do that dark side stuff. As I get older, I pull further and further away from it.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  It's a good thing, but I'm here telling you I've been evil. I've been influenced by evil.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  I have been an unwilling minion of Satan, but I have been reprieved of that.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  And I'm here just simply telling you your ancestors and all the good people in your lineage and all of us and the current people alive
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  and the generations are waiting for you with our arms out and our hands out just saying, join us like the British officers and soldiers.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  Join us like the Hessian soldiers. Join us. Just come. Join us. Come on.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  You know the new world order is evil. You know it's bad. You know it's pedophilic. You know it's destructive.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  You know it's a dead end. So don't pretend like that's not the case and just repent.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  Just say, I'm sorry. I don't want to be part of this and God will leave God and direct you with the Holy Spirit.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  You don't need me to do it. You don't need to have all the answers.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  You've just got to say, yes, I don't want a back of vaccine that isn't a vaccine that causes math, death and destruction as the wheels come off.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  Because the devil's plan is to get people to do evil stuff and then deny they've done it and double down.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  This was a corruption. This was to get the medical system and the lawyers and the government and the media and all of it on board with this
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  so that imagine the next evil you're going to have to support and go along with.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  There isn't much time though. If you don't take on the Holy Spirit, if you don't say, God, help me. I'm weak. I love you.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  I want to be good. Show me you're real. If you don't literally, tonight, turn the lights off in your room or do it with the lights on.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  Just by yourself. Just say, God, I love you. I'm reaching out to you. Show me you're real. You won't believe the dreams you'll have.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  You won't believe the experiences you have. You won't believe what you might even manifestly see if you're that blessed.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  You've got to reach out, though, because God's a free will God.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  And I'm telling you, your heart's going to be hardened very soon. You'll be given over to total delusion.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  Like so many people, these zombies of evil you see everywhere, those of you that can still hear my voice and I can still get to you.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  You've still got receptors in your soul that I can reach to.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  This is only you can let yourself out of this trap. Only you can get out of this cage. Only God can unlock it.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  You have to say, God, unlock it. Let me out. Be like the British officers. Be like the Hessian officers. Join us.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  Be part of the future. Be pro-human. We're here waiting for you. My hand is out to you. Take my hand. Take my hand.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  Now, the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon. And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you. And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now, because we are over the target and history is happening.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones's Info Wars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  This is why they attack us. This is why we need your support. Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  Join the resistance. Buy products. Donate to the cause. Share the links. Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the new world order.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin. The final coin that we're putting out for a long time is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin, exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left. And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  The coin is a collector's item momento of your support during the Second American Revolution. So if you want to get one of these coins, they're going fast.

[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  What are the fantastic stuff?
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  InfoWarsStore.com. X7 Diet Force.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  We're cutting that call into an ad. I can guarantee you that. Thank you so much for the call.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  God bless Australia. We'll be right back, folks. Don't go anywhere. InfoWarsStore.com. Diet Force. Get it now.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  We're very late in the game. There's not much time. I want to finish up what I said. I was going to get into it and then go to the rest of the news.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:48.000]  What I'm quantifying here is you've been serving the New World Order many of you. I know the general audience has them, but I'm talking to those lost sheep out there that have tuned in.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  And there's a real chance for you to make the right decision to spiritually break with the globalists and say, I don't like what's happening. I think it's wrong.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  And I'm going to start thinking and praying and researching what I should do. I'm not telling you what to do. I'm not George Washington asking you to give me troop movements or do this or that.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  I'm just saying, do what Elon Musk has done and said, OK, it really made me sick six months ago and almost killed my family member. It's really bad.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  Oh, my God, these people are horrible. Whether he's really a good person or not, he knows we're winning. I don't get up here and tell you we're winning for no reason.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  I told you 10 years ago we were losing. I told you 25 years ago we were losing. People said, man, this guy is depressing people. No, I don't lie to people.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  I make mistakes, but not often when it comes to the big themes. And so when things are down, I want you to know you're down because when you're down is when you can really fire up.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  And we're still down, but we are beginning to climb out of this thing and we're moving faster and faster and faster.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  And I'm just saying, why would anybody want to serve something that destroys your own future? Even if you're a sociopath, this thing is not going to help you. This thing is going to destroy you.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  And so we're seeing record defections to our side everywhere. We're really turning the tide here. The enemy is going to launch bigger wars.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  They're committing leopard two tanks, 2,000 amount of Germany. They've almost agreed. And more is going to go. And so that's all going on.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  And they're getting ready. The FTC, a month ago, admitted again on Friday, said, yes, we are going to do bail ins. We just don't know the time.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  That means take money out of your bank account. I mean, a lot of it. They're already beta testing it.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  So things are going to get rough, folks. All I can tell you is going along with this is going to make things a lot worse.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  And my job is to tell you what's going on and lay it out and believe in you because the globalists don't believe in you.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  I do believe in you. God believes in you. And I believe in myself and I believe in good people.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  And I'll be damned. I'll speak quite frankly with you if I'm going to ever not bet on you.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  The New World Order betting against you, the people that serve evil, bet against themselves because we were made by God.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  And I'm not going to bet against my maker. I'm not going to bet against my grandparents or their parents or their parents.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  I come from good, hardworking, strong people and I'm not about to turn my back on who they were either.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  And I'm pissed off at myself that I haven't been stronger in the mistakes I've made.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.000]  But I'm telling you, folks, I've swung for the fences every time. Every damn time.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  But as flawed and as failed as I am, we've had incredible victory together.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  And I tell you that because I know how good people are and they don't want to make a mistake and you're humble
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  and you don't want to go to the city council and you don't want to go to the commissioner court or the school board to speak out
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  because it's like you're being uppity and you're being arrogant. You're being a loudmouth.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  No, you're not. You're doing your job when we're under attack.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  And the children are counting on you. And I can tell you, I remember 26 years ago, 27 years ago,
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  I've been on the air a couple of years and I'd been done a marathon video editing of a film.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  I just put it out. I've just done three hours of broadcasting and I was about to drive home.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  I wasn't even married yet. I hadn't even had children yet.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  And I pulled into a place, a waterloo ice house. I got a chicken fried steak and a beer and I'm sitting there in that restaurant.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  But I'm like 23 years old and the whole future opened up.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  And it was this feeling, not a fear, but of awesomeness.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  And that kind of gave me a little like, not what you call fear, more like, whoa.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  And the Holy Spirit was so strong and it was, you're going to create the new generation of resistors.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  And you're going to be destroyed in the end. You have to be ready for this.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  I've told you this story for over 15 years and you're going to change the whole world.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  But you've got to be fully committed to this and you see what it's going to look like.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  But before they destroy you, you're going to get to see all the people you've encouraged
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  and all the people you've spurred to wake up and they're going to be people even more effective than you
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  that are going to help us smash this. Do you understand that?
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  Do you take this mission right now and let me just give you an imprint of the knowledge?
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  Do you want this information? Yes, I want the information. Bam! You got the information now.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  And it was just, boom, my intellect the next week, my dreams, everything.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  I was just downloading stuff I can't even describe at that point.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  They had three other downloads like that. I got one about six months ago.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  And it is some of this stuff I can't even understand. It is like literally I'm being beamed directly.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  The resistance, how to do it, all the operations, how what the enemy is going to do, how to stop them.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  God is so real, ladies and gentlemen. This is not coming from me. This is literally interdimensional.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  Why would you not want to dial into that? Our enemies are dialed into their satanic force.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  They look like zombies. They're demons. They're unhappy. They're unhealthy.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  They're being destroyed, but they are jacked in and don't know how to unplug themselves.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  Like if you were sitting there with your hand in the sink, brushing your teeth,
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  and you forgot to turn the hair dryer off, and it falls into the sink, you're like...
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  You know, one time when I was about ten years old, I got out of the shower, didn't dry my feet off.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  My mom said, breakfast is ready, you're late. I kind of threw on my clothes, but didn't put my shoes on
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  and ran down with wet feet, and the toast popped out, and I put my hand on the toaster,
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  and it went... And I remember my dad telling me, if you ever touch an appliance,
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  and you're locked in by... If you have a heart attack, just kick your feet and fall back.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  And I fell back. I'm sure most of you have that experience of beginning to be electrocuted.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  And it's the same thing, ladies and gentlemen. You're being electrocuted by the New World Order.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  You're being killed by it, and all you got to do is just push away and fall back.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  You got to get off the electricity, get off the satanic force, and just push it off,
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  and get off that son of a bitch. Or it's going to fry your ass forever.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  And people jacked into it, go, man, this is kind of cool.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  You're being fried by evil, and people are like, oh man, I'm on a power trip.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  This is really crazy. I feel like I'm on fire. I'm demon influenced.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  I'm dialed into this evil. This feels really crazy. I must be getting some power.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  No, you're being spiritually electrocuted. You're being spiritually fried.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  Push off. And you know how you push off? You say, Jesus, help me.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  God help me, please. Just take this out of my life. And that's the first step.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  I said I'd cover news, and I will. But these are the times that travel in souls.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  This is a spiritual fight. And everybody needs to understand that 110%, that's what this is,
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  and you can't beat it without God. That's why they want to tell you God doesn't exist.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  They're throwing you overboard without a lifeboat, without a life raft.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  God is that life raft, and they're on a sinking ship. They want you to go down with them
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  thinking there's no other way, but there is. Just decide you don't like the New World Order.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  Just decide you don't like being poor. Just decide you don't want to be a slave.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  Just decide you want to control your own body. Just decide you want to protect children.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  Just decide you want peace and security. Just decide that, and you will get it.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  You got free will. You got to say, I want that. And tell me, God, what I got to do to get that for everybody.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  Alright, I'm going to shut up about this, but that's just defect to God.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  Leave the New World Order. Leave Satan. Break with it. That's all my message to you.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order you've ever had.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important than ever
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  and to intensify them. God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:57.000]  because we are over the target, and history is happening. The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  God bless you all.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  I want to encourage you all to go to m4warstore.com and check it out for yourself because it is a very strong, high quality formula.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  Gallon Out Sleep Support Liquid is very fast acting, taking out of the tongue.

[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  So, Gallon Out sold out for more than five months. It's now back available at m4warstore.com.

[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States,
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:17.000]  and it turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we were already using.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  So we've gone directly to the source, and that means we can give you lower prices on the very same high quality supplements,

[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  Let's plow through all this news I've got now.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  I'm going to go into the next hour as well.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  So why do you think Elon Musk is coming out and saying that the shot's deadly poison?
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  Does he know which way the wind's blowing, or is he really saying and hurting?
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  It doesn't matter.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  The truth's coming out, and it's all over the place.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  That's my message is there's not much time to choose.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  Mark Twain said it, and I love the quote, in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man, hated, feared, and scorned.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  You want freedom, you want empowerment, you want a destiny, you want to be fulfilled, join the good side.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  And if it didn't clear, we're the good side, then you have no discernment, you're already too far gone.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  Doesn't mean we're perfect, but we want to be good.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  We want to be aligned with God.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  I want to be honest.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  I want to tell the truth.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  I want to know the truth.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  And the more you don't lie, the more you neurotically never do it.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  The more you get dulled into God because God doesn't lie.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  All right, so Elon Musk says I was dying.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  Trash is covered boosters.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  Says it almost killed his cousin with microcarditis.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  It goes on and on.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  Already covered that.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  But what does that signify to all you people that serve the system, thinking that you are going to escape and that you're on the winning side.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  And I know listeners will tell me, and I do on the street and I get it emails and text messages and calls and everywhere.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  You care so much about people that are on the devil's side.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  Why do you keep talking to them instead of us?
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  Well, go read The Prodigal Son and you'll know why.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  God already loves you.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  You already know what's going on.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  For whatever reason, your family, your background, your connection.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  There are a bunch of these evil people that have got to get the message because God wants them served with a notice.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  And there's a bunch of them are going to join us and help us do the right thing.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  But the other ones got to be served.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  They got to be given their warning.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  And that's what I'm doing.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  And that's why I do it.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  So it isn't that you don't matter.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  You're already on the team.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  We already thank God you're already on board.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  Thank God for that.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  These other people, we got to try to save them.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  Love was projector evil on us.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  They want to kill everybody because they want to kill themselves.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  And I would want to kill myself if I was like them.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  But I don't want to live forever because I love life and I love God and I will my spirit.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  I will stop.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  It's hard to cover this.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  I did a lot of research on this and it's just so horrible to research it.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  I don't even like covering things like on this.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  But what we've got to expose it all over the country.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  In the last week, good police officers and good district attorneys not controlled by George Soros have busted LGBTQP organizations going and getting foster children grabbed from Christian parents
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  and turned over to them to be brutally raped, little boys and girls, main little boys, they hate men, and then sold out to sex slavery at the Democratic Party.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  This has been out for weeks. You already know all about it. There's a bunch of these cases.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  But I wanted to tie it in to Jamie Lee Curtis and John and Tony Podesta because that's been big news.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  And this Jamie Lee Curtis thing broke like five, six days ago.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  I held back on it until I could do some research.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  And I'm going to give you my take on it right now.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  But I really don't want to accuse people of things they haven't done.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  Most of these people, it's all in record. They've done it.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  So we're going to tie it all together.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  So here it is.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  A gay couple, a pedophile couple.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  Not saying gays are pedophiles.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  I'm saying these are pedophiles.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  In Atlanta had been charged with raping their adopted sons and also for pimping them out on other local pedophiles.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  And they did this on mainline Instagram and Facebook channels, thinking they were so protected.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  Does that tell you how widespread this is?
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  This is one of five or six big breaking cases right now.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  And you already know all about it. I'm not going to get into it.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  But here it is. Gay activist, pedo activist couple who sexually abused adopted sons having a rough time in prison.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  Sold them reportedly to dozens of men alone in their neighborhoods.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  Meanwhile, Facebook and Instagram will allow users to show their breasts, but only if they're trans or non-binary.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  Special rights to those people.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  End of civilization. A little woman that's $200,000 selling her farts.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  It's all about degrading you folks. That's all they want.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  And now that leads us to this.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  Jamie Lee Curtis slammed for photo of naked child in box.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  Strong Epstein vibes.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  I noticed most of the photos weren't HD.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  We found the HD. I forgot to tell the crew, but I gave it to you today.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  Pull up the HD photos of it.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  It's a child in a plastic container looking like a prisoner.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  Now, I don't know. We put that on screen. Just type in Jamie Lee Curtis. It's everywhere, guys.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  And you look at that and I don't know if that's in her office because she's into that.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  But I know that type of bondage of children.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  I'll pull up on my phone if you can't do it. I'll do it.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  Just go to Google. You type in Jamie Lee Curtis office photo. It's everywhere, guys.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  We did preparation for the show. I'm not mad, but I just don't know how.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  There it is. Okay.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  So it's a naked child inside of a plastic tote container from like Walmart.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  And maybe it's innocent. Maybe it's no big deal.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  But people are smart and are doing the right thing.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  Being concerned about it.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  But Jamie Lee Curtis says, oh, no, that's a photo a friend gave me a decade ago.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  It's no big deal. Okay. Maybe a naked girl in a garbage bin looking abused and totally brainwashed is normal.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  Maybe it's an innocent thing.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  Except you go anywhere around these people.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  That's all the art and culture you see.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  And that's what they spew out the media in the whole situation.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  So let's actually show you real art by the hundreds of pieces that I want to show on air.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  From Tony Podesta, the top lobbyist in DC and his brother.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  John Podesta from the pizza game and him in the Washington Post 2007 calling it dangerous art and his DC compound of little boys tied up and little girls tied up.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  Being paddled and raped and everything else.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  I can't show you the really hardcore stuff but adults.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  The child performing oral sex on a man inside showers inside dungeons, adults raping babies.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  That's a toddler sized child.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  All of it children tied up against walls being tortured with the woman looking on.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  Thousands of these that they published in the Washington Post calling it dangerous art.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  That's called lesser magic.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  That they would show that to you.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  That they would do that.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  They believe gives them more power.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  Because it shows a two year old on the floor being anally raped by a fat man.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  With notice a bunch of women looking on approvingly.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  Look at that image.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  This is what they published in the Washington Post as his cool art.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  What looks like a three year old with a fat man missionary style raping a child while the women look on approvingly with a little teddy bear over here.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  Meaning innocence has been removed.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  This is a satanic ritual.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  That's who we're dealing with.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  That's who the system is defending.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  And that's what makes me cry.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  Look at the other stuff at his house.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  Demon goblins with little girls in bed with the peacock looking on.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  All that is pedophilic.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  The phallic symbol of his arm about to destroy.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  He has the saiths about to destroy her innocence.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  The grim reaper.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  A golem like creature.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  And then after the rape the love she now loves the goblin that raped her.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  This is what he showed.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  This is what he showed the Washington Post and exercise their power over the children.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  Images of demonic women.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  Demonic breasts to form with cancer.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  Demonic demon raping children.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  On and on and on.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  We look at Harrison Smith and Owen Troyer and the hard work they engage in every day, 5, 6, 7 days a week.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  It's really just incredible.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTour.com
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keep us on air.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  If just 1% more of you took action at InfoWarsTour.com, our fighting problems will be over.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  Please take action now.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  There's a solution.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  The wellness company.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand, prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies,

[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new world that we're living in.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com and check out the wellness company for a low monthly fee.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  You can get started today and on a pathway to better health.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:06.000]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, you know they may seem little, have a massive ripple effect throughout time and space.
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  We're actually winning the info award.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  And when you realize that Band-Aught Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts whose information is beyond incredible.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them right now telling the truth at Band-Aught Video.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  Millions of people today visiting Band-Aught Video, but you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect,
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, and perfect strangers.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  You are the modern Paul Revere's. You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  So I thank you all for your past action and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  Info Wars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support and because of the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down Info Wars and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  If you decide we're done, we're done. If you decide to go to infowarshtore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  It is all in your hands. So thanks for your support. Stand up against the globalists. Go to infowarshtore.com right now and keep us on air. It's up to you.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  So, there was an article in 2007 called Dangerous Art with Tony Podesta, the top lobbyist in D.C.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  And it was just children in dungeons, children hanging up, children being raped. You're like, why would they put that in the newspaper?
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  And believe me, folks, we've showed you stuff you show on TV. We've not shown you the worst stuff. So be careful when you're online.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  It's the only legal child porn is whatever the Clintons and the Obamas put out. This is child porn. This is child porn.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  It's like the, you know, adults can't see it on TV, but the same type of books are put in public schools, including Austin, for middle schoolers.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  Like, oh, the man pulls up in your backyard once you get in this van. Get in the van. He's going to give you a blow job. It's going to be wonderful.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  A little kid gets in. It's images of this. I mean, you look at this, it makes you cry because you have children.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  And you realize how evil this is. This is our government. This is who took over while we were asleep.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  So, I showed this article. Podesta's art, stuff so bad, journalists don't want you to see it. And it's demons raping children in their beds.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  But don't worry. Again, the teddy bears dropped. The innocent's gone. The six-year-old girl has been raped by the demon.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  Oh, look how loving and liberal. But it's liberal that this is happening. And then demonic images of women and more children being raped, children being killed.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  It goes on and on and on. Demons attacking children. Stuff that looks like it's out of a Hellraiser movie or Stranger Things.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  That's who these people are. Maggots having sex with children. Human animal hybrids.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  And then look at this other stuff at his house. He showed the Washington Post. This is from the Washington Post.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  Why is he going to Podesta own artwork like this? Children look like Anderson Cooper.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  Little girls tied up in dungeons in their underwear with their butts paddled red. And babies with those black eyes, those dead eyes they have after they've been tortured.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  That can go on for days, days. Demons face-sucking children. People loving demons.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  Demonically possessed babies. All these torture photos of children. These are the people that dialed into this.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  Tony Podesta had a toilet camera. Yes, Tony Podesta had a toilet camera. Washingtonian. But meanwhile, we have the New York Times running defense covering it up saying it's no big deal.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  It's all pizza gate. It's all fake because they focus on a pizza place to hide what really happened.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  We've got Ghislaine Maxwell now doing interviews saying, oh, she's nothing about any of it. Oh, no. She's a nice person.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  What about this next clip I'm going to play? This is, if you long for the fastest government to parent your children, you're clearly a sick person.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  It's only a minute and 26 seconds long. And this is a woman in the New York Times saying, I lived in China the way they controlled our lives was so beautiful and we need that here.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  Stockholm syndrome or beyond. That's why the pedophilic image is a big fat man raping toddlers that Tony Podesta has and showed the Washington Post to sear our conscience and blacken our hearts and just throw it in our face.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  What he's doing, a big thrill for him. They can't help it. Tyrants love to brag.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  That's why the system defends them.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  So here's a mother moved back from China, wishing the state would take control of her children here. Here's the clip.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  Today, the New York Times published an op-ed from a woke American woman who spent 16 years living in China. What does she miss about China? She misses the Communist Party of China co-parenting her children.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  She thinks the Chinese commissars did a better job as a mother than she could have. She misses their firm hand. And we're quoting, not making this up. This is the New York Times saying, quote,
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  Our stringent government co-parent quickly made its presence felt, the woman writes. The girl's Chinese kindergarten lectured us on everything, including how many hours our daughter should sleep, what they should eat, and their optimal weight.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  The Communist Party party fat shamed this lady's kids, quote,
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  We sometimes felt as if our children were on loan to us for evenings and weekends to be delivered back to school each weekday.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  Now, again, she's not writing a new version of darkness at noon. She's complimenting the government of China. The piece ends by noting, quote,
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  Tight control of the Communist Party surveillance state results in its own kind of freedom.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  Okay, that is un-American. That person is sick. And if you don't recognize how sick that person is, if you long for a fascist government to call your little girl's fat, you're a sick person.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  Okay, the fact that the New York Times would run that and expect all of its readers to applaud, oh, if only the government would tell my kids they're fat, this would be a better country.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  So we showed you images, the ones we can show you on air. We're on a lot of TV stations.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  Of cartoons in Tony Podesta's home and he showed the Washington Post in 2007, he's proud of, of big fat men in beds raping toddlers.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  You say, well, okay, that's hypothetical. It's still horrible, but it's a cartoon. It's just right.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  What about China and 50 million dead girls, the one child policy? What about all the things that were done there?
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  What about this woman in the New York Times saying, I want G.G. Ping telling me how to live my life? They're openly externalizing all of this evil in our faces.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  They know exactly what they're doing. And it's important for everybody to let that sink in and think about the individuals we're fighting and what we're up against.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  So looking at these images again, and these are the ones we can show you on air.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  I'm trying to find the ones I showed earlier. If you guys can put them on screen of the fat man with women all around.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  Well, they're able to put that on screen, but regardless, we got it on air earlier and the children in dungeons all tied up and the rest of it.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  Why are these people into this? Because it's simple.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  If they can get you to go along with all of this, if they can get you to accept this, if they can get you to not revolt against this, then they can do anything.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  If they can condition you to accept what they've done, if they can condition you not to reject it, to vomit it out, to say no to it, there it is.
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  Show the rest of it. In every photo, every painting, it's the teddy bear against the wall.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  This is what these people are into. Giant men. Look at that one. It looks like a newborn baby being shoved into a woman's vagina.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  And a child tied up, chained to a wall while a woman onlooks while a man tasers it or shocks it while a big fat man rapes a two-year-old.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  And you go, that's not even real. They just raped your body with a poison shot.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  They just raped your body with a genetically engineered system to destroy your immune system.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  And that's why they've got an emaciated child stuffed in a garbage can, hanging on the wall of one of these Hollywood people.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  Because it's about their power and about their hatred of God and how they're willing to do anything.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  I'll throw my children away. I'll throw your children away. I'll throw anything away. I surrender to the devil.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  Well, guess what? I don't surrender to the devil.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  And in fact, I declare war on these people eternally, but I can only do it with your support.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  We're going to start the next two hours. We're going to cover something very special that's very, very important.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  Stephen Colbert is a big buddy of these guys. He's in. He's with them.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  They want to tie your children up and put poison shots on them.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  Whereas you think of the pedophilia as bad.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  They've all got their ruby slippers being there and on the club.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  They're already raping them with a bio weapon that kills their DNA. Your child can get over being raped by them.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  Your child can't get over being given genetic death.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  infowars.com. 4 and slash show is the coordinates of the resistance.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  If you don't share it, you can pitch like to the enemy.

[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  Share it or roll over and die. I mean, I'm just here fully max in the fight because I'm not a pedophile.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  God demands we fight this or with the enemy. It's not like, oh, you're a hero. You're fighting them.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  You know, it's what we're supposed to do.

[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  The second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset and in full wars in bodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
