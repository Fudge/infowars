[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:16.000 --> 00:33.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33.000 --> 01:00.000]  I don't think it's fundamentally about incivility. I think it is fundamentally about insurrection. You know, I don't know the individual, but the whole let's go Brandon kind of motif is a reflection of the view two thirds of the Republican base driven by Trump's claims, false claims and the big lie that Biden is an illegitimate president.
[01:00.000 --> 01:22.000]  You talk about the wheels coming off the globalist operation, you talk about the engine blowing up, you talk about the house burning down. The globalists know their corrupt system is coming to an end, and they're trying to take capitalism with it when it's not capitalism that caused this, but crony capitalism and corrupt financiers working with authoritarian regimes to create monopolies.
[01:22.000 --> 01:31.000]  So they know their monopolistic New World Order great reset is coming to an end. They understand that, and they don't know what to do.
[01:31.000 --> 01:55.000]  So crisis has shown us we need a mindset change, and we need also to move from a society where business and governments have very separate tasks to a society where the two together with civil society work hand in hand.
[01:55.000 --> 02:12.000]  Far more quickly, small businesses have suffered terribly. How has that not not the philosophy of stakeholder capitalism, but the ability of companies across the spectrum to execute it?
[02:12.000 --> 02:13.000]  Yes, we.
[02:13.000 --> 02:14.000]  Yeah.
[02:14.000 --> 02:15.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  Question to you and then we'll open to the group.
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  What is this great reset?
[02:21.000 --> 02:37.000]  What the great reset is, it's a bunch of global elites, as you said, and they have two protocols or two themes. One is that their credentials or their education or their inherited or made wealth make them elites and allow them to talk down to people.
[02:37.000 --> 02:52.000]  And, you know, by top down measures dictate to people in a non-democratic way what's good for them. And second, their power and influence and wealth mean they're never going to be subject to the ramifications of their own ideology because they're exempt.
[02:52.000 --> 02:59.000]  Capitalism made them wealth, but they don't want capitalism for anybody else. They want to close the attic door so nobody climbs up after them.
[02:59.000 --> 03:07.000]  And so they're going to engineer an artificial collapse so they can be the saviors of the collapse. So they have all the PR straight and all the propaganda straight.
[03:07.000 --> 03:15.000]  So that as things disintegrate, they can pose as the saviors and hopefully stay in charge of this control demolition that they have executed.
[03:15.000 --> 03:35.000]  But it's not going the way tyrants always wanted to go. It's getting out of control. So they're upping the level of control. They're accelerating the collapse. And they basically lost control now, ladies and gentlemen. Only a mass awakening of the public can get control of the train before it goes over the edge into the ravine.
[03:35.000 --> 03:45.000]  Most people I now know with Covid are those who are double or triple vaccinated. They're getting so ill. So what they're trying to do is get you to do a virtue symbol. They're trying to say, wear your mask.
[03:45.000 --> 03:52.000]  So I'm a good person. I'm a good Christian. I'm protecting people. No, you're not. You're shown that you're gagged and you're not speaking up for the truth.
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.000]  My husband is a vicar in the Church of England. When we're actually in the height of the pandemic, he was very, very quiet on funerals.
[03:58.000 --> 04:07.000]  There was very, very few funerals at all. People were not dying. And one of my sons actually was in hospital. The hospital was dead. Paul Hospital was absolutely empty.
[04:07.000 --> 04:17.000]  I got straight into A&E. No problem at all. Now, since the vaccine rollout, there's been funeral after funeral after funeral. We know undertakers in the area, undertakers have spoken out.
[04:17.000 --> 04:30.000]  What is killing people now is vaccine injury. Whether you can relate it or not, but it's heart attacks, stroke, blood clots, myocarditis, inflammation of the heart, or later down the line, it's going to be cancer.
[04:30.000 --> 04:44.000]  Masses, having a giant epiphany, a giant chain reaction awakening, can and will stop them. The majority of the people at the top now, you wonder why they're so evil, why they follow orders.
[04:44.000 --> 04:59.000]  Because they think get out of jail free cards. So that's who these people are. It's about their power, their control, their God. They can do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want.
[04:59.000 --> 05:17.000]  I'm cutting this announcement on the morning of December 28, 2021. And that means you've only got until Thursday morning, or less than two days to take advantage of the biggest sales of 2021, up to 60% off on our best selling products,
[05:17.000 --> 05:37.000]  double Patriot points, and store wide free shipping. DNA Force Plus is about to go off sale. Vitamins Refusion is about to go off sale. Ultimate bone broth that we finally got reformulated back at stock, it is going to be ending its sale, along with more than 50 other products that
[05:37.000 --> 05:51.000]  infowarstore.com and the free shipping. So you've got until Thursday to get the best deals of 2021 and they're gone and they're over. We were going to run them through to the new year, but most of these products have almost sold out.
[05:51.000 --> 06:09.000]  A lot of already sold out. So thanks for keeping us on the air. These are great products. It's a win win infowarstore.com.
[06:21.000 --> 06:35.000]  Welcome to this live Thursday, December 30th edition of the Alex Jones show. We've been on air 28 years. I've been in the syndicated time slot or at 424.
[06:35.000 --> 06:54.000]  And I'm very, very blessed and honored to be here. Okay, let me really just start the broadcast off from this perspective. I went to bed about 10 o'clock last night, and I woke up at 115 in the morning and never went back to sleep.
[06:54.000 --> 07:10.000]  And it wasn't because I drank coffee late in the day. I was just so upset about the depopulation going on and the fact that it's all confirmed. And basically every prediction we made has come true, except it's moving faster than I thought.
[07:10.000 --> 07:28.000]  And I've been laying there unable to sleep for about an hour, basically meditating, focusing, researching in my mind, thinking. And I just felt overwhelmed by the Holy Spirit to get on my knees and start praying on the floor.
[07:28.000 --> 07:35.000]  And I'm sitting there tired thinking, no, I can just pray right here. And it's like, no, you need to get on your knees and put your head on the ground.
[07:35.000 --> 07:50.000]  And I sat there for about an hour praying to God and just opening myself up. And it was literally God just saying, here's the time I saved you there. Here's the time I saved you here. Here's the time I saved your child from dying.
[07:50.000 --> 08:05.000]  And it was like, now you are going to have to go out and you're going to have to get up off your ass and you're going to have to get focused and be a real man because you've been having too much fun doing this. You joke around too much. You screw around too much.
[08:05.000 --> 08:23.000]  And I didn't rise you up to play half measures. And so, I mean, I want to talk about this on air because it sounds to people that don't know God, ridiculous, but it's totally true.
[08:23.000 --> 08:36.000]  I mean, they make the joke that my wife was slapped me around last Friday night, which she was. Of course, I'm not going to hit her back and go to prison. And this was God slapped me around last night.
[08:36.000 --> 08:49.000]  And, you know, just the amount of mental illness, the amount of rage, the amount of family violence, is it all-time record, the amount of suicide? We are just being poisoned and killed.
[08:49.000 --> 09:00.000]  And my wife's doing well now. She's gone into rehab.
[09:00.000 --> 09:10.000]  But that's the least of my problems. When I look at the problems I have, remember the saying my grandfather, my dad's dad would always have about people complaining.
[09:10.000 --> 09:19.000]  I complained I had no shoes till I saw a man who had no feet. That's another way of saying, walk a mile in my shoes.
[09:19.000 --> 09:35.000]  And I just think about all these sweet, dear little children who are just starting out their lives and have such wonderment in their eyes and are just wanting to be part of a great future.
[09:35.000 --> 09:45.000]  And here is a predatory sick evil system that already beta tested on poor foster children and orphans killing them by the thousands.
[09:45.000 --> 09:58.000]  Fauci, he ran the program, now doing it on a mass scale and then understanding the evil logic of why they're doing it, not just to depopulate children,
[09:58.000 --> 10:11.000]  not just to maim them and then suck decades of money out of their families as they slowly die, the ones that don't die right away.
[10:11.000 --> 10:25.000]  But to know that when doctors and nurses and clinics and parents and lawyers and teachers and bureaucracies are part of making children do this
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  and intimidating parents into doing this, that when the children get hurt and maimed and die, which is now happening,
[10:31.000 --> 10:45.000]  most of those people will fight to rationalize and to cover it up and to convince themselves that what they did was right
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.000]  and to actually hate those of us that tried to warn them and tried to stop them.
[10:49.000 --> 11:01.000]  And we've all seen an example of this with Trump, the globalist or after him, he was secure on the border, he was standing up to China,
[11:01.000 --> 11:08.000]  he was getting his better trade deals, he was cutting off the fentanyl coming in, he got us out of the WHO, he did so many great things.
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.000]  And then he wants to get the economy going so it has operational warp speed.
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  He believes it's a regular vaccine, he believes the propaganda, just like Dr. Paul did.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.
[11:20.000 --> 11:29.000]  But now a year and a half into this, year and a half, we count England, a year here, we have hundreds of thousands dead,
[11:29.000 --> 11:43.000]  we know of millions maimed and I was thinking this morning about all the people I know that have gotten really sick and wiped out
[11:43.000 --> 11:50.000]  or died after they took the shots.
[11:50.000 --> 11:59.000]  And so I was just thinking about Trump and how we count on him to supposedly be a leader and help us and that's why we're mad at him.
[11:59.000 --> 12:08.000]  But really, as I said yesterday, we can't be mad at Trump unless we're really mad at Rand Paul, who's a medical doctor,
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  who still hasn't come out and said, okay, I was wrong, this doesn't work, this is a scam.
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.000]  He still says, oh, I'm double-vaxxed, oh, it doesn't protect you and that's a lie.
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  And here's something really important we're going to cover when we come back.
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.000]  Here's something extremely important.
[12:30.000 --> 12:39.000]  You've seen those compilations over the years of all the local news saying the same thing in the same order because they've been paid to do it and told to do it.
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.000]  It's propaganda, many times paid propaganda.
[12:44.000 --> 12:52.000]  But you've seen the compilations of Pfizer brought to you by Pfizer at the end of the newscast telling you it's safe and effective.
[12:52.000 --> 13:02.000]  Well, think about this, they're paying hundreds of thousands of influencers around the world, including here in the U.S.,
[13:02.000 --> 13:09.000]  is the most prevalent where they're doing it, to say, trust the science like a parrot.
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  Trust the science, trust the science, trust the science.
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  And just say, oh, Trump's right, finally the Democrats say, Trump got something right.
[13:18.000 --> 13:26.000]  His crazy constituents, his crazy supporters, they're mad at him now.
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  And I've sat there just to monitor it because they've been attacking me.
[13:30.000 --> 13:37.000]  And I went in the last couple of days and I just watched the intro to the young Turks and a bunch of other shows,
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  all the Democrat YouTube shows that are force-fed by Google.
[13:42.000 --> 13:52.000]  And they all start their shows word for word, just like the compilations you see that show it's all staged with the Pfizer garbage.
[13:52.000 --> 14:03.000]  It's the same thing, except there it is, all the Democrat newscasters and all the little internet influencer talking heads.
[14:03.000 --> 14:12.000]  And they just sit there with smug looks on their faces, getting a paycheck to do that.
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  And then Bill O'Reilly, that sycophant, you know, he's getting paid.
[14:17.000 --> 14:30.000]  I got the inside baseball on Trump's tour and how he consoled Trump when Trump got freaked out by his supporters booing him.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  It's disgusting.
[14:32.000 --> 14:39.000]  And so I've gotten pretty much nothing but support attacking Trump from our listeners.
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  Because they understand it's done from a place of trying to get him to wake up and do the right thing,
[14:43.000 --> 14:48.000]  like Wayne Allen Roots said at a intervention, and that interview's been picked up in a bunch of newspapers
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  and been quoted, so that's something good.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  And I know Trump's going to read about it to see it.
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.000]  But if Trump won't stand up for us and his own future and his own name, that's his problem.
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.000]  It's up to us to do it and to go out and warn people.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  And we can't use the fact that Trump won't be a good person and do the right thing.
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  We can't use that as an excuse for us to not do anything.
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.000]  But I got to tell you, Senator Paul is smart and medically five times smarter than Trump.
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  One of the smartest people I know.
[15:15.000 --> 15:31.000]  And Senator Paul is entering the zone now of becoming an aider and a better of this and a accomplice of Fauci.
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000]  And that's why he's attacking Fauci over Wuhan and gaining a function, because he knows,
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  oh my God, this thing's deadly.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  This is a bio weapon depopulation.
[15:40.000 --> 15:41.000]  What have I done?
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  So he's at least going at it from that angle.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  Not enough, Senator.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  You told everybody do this.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  You signed on to it.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  You use your credibility to push it.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  You're wrong.
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  And we want you now to come out with the facts and help us sink the great reset.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  Or we're all going to sink.
[15:59.000 --> 16:08.000]  Well, if info wars was battle hardened and wounded and punished and tortured and demonized and lied about in the last 20 plus years,
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  we've really gone through the most destructive year we've ever seen.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.000]  But so is the country.
[16:14.000 --> 16:15.000]  So is the world.
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  And info wars intends to go into the thick of the fight.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  We intend to get attacked.
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  We also intend to win.
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  But we can't do that without working together.
[16:24.000 --> 16:32.000]  So I wanted to thank all of you in this insane year of 2021 for your support and for your promotion of liberty and freedom.
[16:32.000 --> 16:37.000]  And I want to encourage you all to understand that we're not backing down and the great awakening is here.
[16:37.000 --> 16:44.000]  And I want to encourage you to take advantage of the best deals of the year that we were going to extend through the first.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  But we're selling out of basically everything.
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.000]  So we have to end the sales Thursday morning.
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  So I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[16:51.000 --> 16:58.000]  That means there's just two days left to get store wide free shipping double patriot points up to 60% off at infowarstore.com.
[16:58.000 --> 17:02.000]  Not just across the United States but across the world.
[17:02.000 --> 17:07.000]  You see it on the sides of barns and on bumper stickers on cars and written on the side of bathroom walls.
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[17:09.000 --> 17:15.000]  That's become a maximum of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud of the new world order.
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  That they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates and the Great Reset.
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  And so now info wars credibility is stronger than it's ever been.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  And the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks.
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.000]  And we can't let them do that.
[17:27.000 --> 17:34.000]  So you've invested info wars over the years, I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  Or everything you've done in the past is for nothing.
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.000]  You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  You have done incredible things.
[17:43.000 --> 17:51.000]  And I'm telling you now going in 2022 info wars has major underages to run an operation and we need more funds in.
[17:51.000 --> 17:52.000]  So it's a 360 win.
[17:52.000 --> 17:56.000]  Get great products that are great for you and your family, your immune system and so much more.

[18:58.000 --> 19:04.000]  So when I first started taking survival shield basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[19:06.000 --> 19:11.000]  I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on their show and I listened to it.
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.000]  And it worked pretty good.
[19:15.000 --> 19:21.000]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that shield you had with the deep burden source you know and I got really excited about that so I took it.
[19:21.000 --> 19:27.000]  And man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  You know I could think again. I could connect with people again.
[19:30.000 --> 19:37.000]  And over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  It literally like if you want to sleep just take it.
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  It's amazing. It works.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  But anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[19:47.000 --> 19:53.000]  We have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[19:53.000 --> 20:16.000]  Beautifully said brother. I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[20:16.000 --> 20:23.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  The embattled info wars.
[20:26.000 --> 20:33.000]  The final operations standing up against the new world order toe to toe.
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.000]  Almost everyone else is falling.
[20:36.000 --> 20:49.000]  But as God would have it suddenly all of these quasi establishment type figures are waking up and the seeds that you and I planted in their minds.
[20:49.000 --> 21:01.000]  Warning them of this coming have now sprouted and are growing fast and bearing their fruit as well as others choose life and choose a human future.
[21:01.000 --> 21:08.000]  Now I could cover all this incredible news and I will next segment on the Gisling Maxwell verdict and is it a victory is a defeat.
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.000]  It's actually both giving my view on that rope the phones up today as well.
[21:13.000 --> 21:27.000]  But I want to talk about philosophy and a tale of two people and I'm a very private person when it comes to my friends and people that I know whether they just be a common person or a very famous person.
[21:27.000 --> 21:37.000]  But I'm going to go ahead and give you an example of two people that I know very well Joe Rogan particularly well since 1998 99.
[21:37.000 --> 21:43.000]  And I mean been good friends with him hung out with him vacation with him so much over the years.
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  We've had falling outs we've had issues has been some of him talk for a year.
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  Sometimes we hang out 15 times in a year.
[21:50.000 --> 22:02.000]  But it's a tale of two people you've got well the tale of three people you got Alex Jones and then you got Tucker Carlson you got Joe Rogan.
[22:02.000 --> 22:17.000]  And if you understand those three types you understand it's a way to explain something that's very important because I talk about this a lot but sometimes I hear the rebroadcast and I don't think I'm making it crystal clear like it is in my own mind.
[22:17.000 --> 22:31.000]  And I want you to really wrap your brain around this and I know most of you already have some probably level I haven't been able to but I want this to really sink in because it is a paradox.
[22:31.000 --> 22:42.000]  It is paradoxical and that you can see it from both angles.
[22:42.000 --> 22:48.000]  Joe Rogan is completely happy on cloud nine.
[22:48.000 --> 22:59.000]  I've known the guy forever and I've never seen him so satisfied and just you know they say he beat the game alive basically the best and everything he does.
[22:59.000 --> 23:27.000]  And he is waking up to what's really happening in the world but it's not really sunk into him how dystopic it's going to get and that it's only going to get worse from here unless he fully organizes against the globalist and that will step him into a whole another level.
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  So Joe is very happy person.
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.000]  He's mad about the shots.
[23:31.000 --> 23:32.000]  He knows their poisonous.
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  He's starting to figure out it's by design.
[23:34.000 --> 23:38.000]  He's he's he's as they say becoming completely red pilled.
[23:38.000 --> 23:48.000]  Then there's Tucker Carlson and I love seeing the left constantly fetishize and oh my God he's going to run for president.
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.000]  Oh he's the leader of the Republicans.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  Oh he could take over the party because they wish they could.
[23:53.000 --> 23:57.000]  Tucker Carlson wants nothing to do with DC.
[23:57.000 --> 23:58.000]  Nothing to do with the presidency.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  He grew up around it.
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  His dad ran a major federal agency.
[24:04.000 --> 24:09.000]  Tucker Carlson wants to live in the woods in Maine.
[24:09.000 --> 24:15.000]  Tucker Carlson only gets on his cell phone like 10 minutes a day.
[24:15.000 --> 24:23.000]  Tucker Carlson gets it and knows it's all dystopic and he's got it.
[24:23.000 --> 24:29.000]  He's all the way awake doing as much as he can on Fox News.
[24:29.000 --> 24:36.000]  So Tucker Carlson somebody that didn't believe all this and thought I was super evil 20 years ago and I was just saying horrible things.
[24:36.000 --> 24:44.000]  The 10 years ago he figured out okay Alex is right but maybe Jones exaggerates.
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.000]  Now he's like oh my God it's worse than you said.
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  But see there's the paradox.
[24:52.000 --> 25:00.000]  He's more awake than Joe Rogan but he doesn't have the complete freedom that Joe Rogan has.
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.000]  So it's the paradox.
[25:01.000 --> 25:09.000]  Imagine what he could do if he had his complete freedom and he's pretty much got 95% of it but he knows there's lines he can't really cross.
[25:09.000 --> 25:20.000]  Plus his audience isn't ready for the total truth like they say in a few good men you want the truth you can't handle the truth.
[25:20.000 --> 25:26.000]  And then there's Alex Jones.
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  I grew up around people that knew how the world really worked and never even thought of it as an issue.
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  I grew up knowing all this.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  I knew all this stuff when I was 10 years old.
[25:36.000 --> 25:46.000]  And that's why I got a big leap on everybody else because I was already there and you took it for granted.
[25:46.000 --> 25:52.000]  My mother's father knew all of this when almost no one did.
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.000]  His son knew all of it when nobody was talking about it.
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.000]  My uncle.
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  So I've been very blessed and God put me in the position I'm in.
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  But now it's weird like I'll be out eating a steak with Joe Rogan.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  We're having fun.
[26:07.000 --> 26:08.000]  Everything's great.
[26:08.000 --> 26:09.000]  We're telling jokes.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  And he's just so happy.
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  Carlson's not like that.
[26:16.000 --> 26:17.000]  And I'm not judging Joe.
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  I'm not judging Carlson.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  Carlson's more like me.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  He realizes we're really screwed.
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  We may not be able to turn this back.
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  This is the great reset takeover depopulation event.
[26:29.000 --> 26:34.000]  And there's that paradox that if the public won't wake up and won't defend themselves,
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  the globalists are going to turn them into a starving horde.
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  And they're planning in the endgame to make us join them just so we survive.
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  And that's the message I get from globalists is, yeah, Jones, you picked the wrong team.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  You'll be begging for our help soon.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  See, the population will destroy you for trying to help them.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  Oh, I guess that's the fourth group.
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  See, I get to know the globalists.
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.000]  I get to know all the top people.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  And I'm not bragging.
[27:01.000 --> 27:08.000]  I'm saying, God put me in that position so I could actually see it all for what it is.
[27:08.000 --> 27:16.000]  And then I ask myself, the reason I'm explaining this is, am I wrong on so many fronts?
[27:16.000 --> 27:27.000]  Should we go ahead and join with Satan and kill the majority of the population and go with that plan?
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  Because the population doesn't care about themselves or their children.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  They kind of deserve to die.
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  And that's a hypothetical.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  I'm not literally saying I'm going to join Satan.
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  It's just you have to know that all these other people decided to join it.
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.000]  And the reason I'm not going to join it is they're so miserable.
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.000]  They're so empty.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  They're not their own men and women.
[27:46.000 --> 27:53.000]  And spiritually, the feeling of even imagining joining them is worse than a thousand deaths.
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  So I'm not going to do that.
[27:55.000 --> 28:04.000]  But then how do I not be gloom and doom and things be so horrible that we just oppress people with what we cover?
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  Where is the paradoxical middle ground?
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  And that is in understanding that God is real.
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  Christ is real.
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.000]  And then only by transcending spiritually can we turn this around.
[28:15.000 --> 28:24.000]  And so that's really a larger gestalt of what I'm trying to articulate and what I'm trying to get at.
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  But it really is this.
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  I need to be able to enjoy my life.
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  I need to be able to have R and R.
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  I need to be able to say that's a natural function to not be in war constantly.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  But you see, we are in a war.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  The globalist system is a war on humanity.
[28:38.000 --> 28:41.000]  And so denying it just makes you surrender to it.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  I'm fighting it.
[28:43.000 --> 28:49.000]  And I'm just simply trying to explain to the public that you either better wake up and stand up now,
[28:49.000 --> 28:54.000]  or you are going to slowly be tortured to death and die.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  We'll be right back with the Pedophile Ring Convection.
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  Stay with us.
[28:59.000 --> 29:02.000]  2021 has been an incredible year.
[29:02.000 --> 29:07.000]  It's been an incredible year for evil, but it's also been an amazing year for the global awakening.
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  Time to believe it's almost over.
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.000]  Christmas 2021 is now a thing of history.
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.000]  And we are plunging into the most critical year.
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.000]  Not just in U.S. history, but world history in my view.
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  So please continue to spread the word about it in Full Wars.
[29:21.000 --> 29:24.000]  Please continue to pray for the broadcast because all of us together,
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.000]  including you the viewers and listeners, are the tip of the spear.
[29:27.000 --> 29:32.000]  And take advantage of Christmas sales that will end Thursday morning.
[29:32.000 --> 29:35.000]  I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  It's only going to run until Thursday morning.
[29:37.000 --> 29:40.000]  And the sale will end up to 60% off.
[29:40.000 --> 29:44.000]  Double Patriot Points and free shipping at infowarstore.com.
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  So thanks for keeping us on the air while getting great products at the same time.

[29:52.000 --> 29:56.000]  ultimate turmeric formula and so much more at infowarstore.com.
[29:56.000 --> 30:06.000]  The sale ends in just two days.
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  A dictatorship of the globalist.
[30:29.000 --> 30:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars is the tip of the spear.
[30:31.000 --> 30:34.000]  Your investment in us over the years, buying our products,
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  spreading the word and praying for us has been incredible.
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.000]  But I'm telling you right now, we're about to lose not just Info Wars,
[30:39.000 --> 30:42.000]  but the entire country and the world to tyranny.
[30:42.000 --> 30:45.000]  So now, everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today.
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.000]  And infowarstore.com is one of the most important places you can go
[30:48.000 --> 30:51.000]  to buy great products and fund the tip of the spear.
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  I will go down with the ship. I'm not going to back down.
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  I'm getting even more hardcore on their face.
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  I can't stand the fight at 100% unless you support us.
[30:57.000 --> 30:59.000]  So please go to infowarstore.com.
[30:59.000 --> 31:02.000]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[31:02.000 --> 31:06.000]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order
[31:06.000 --> 31:08.000]  by empowering humanity.
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  Well, that's why resetwarstore.com is so important.
[31:10.000 --> 31:14.000]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information
[31:14.000 --> 31:16.000]  to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[31:16.000 --> 31:20.000]  but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt
[31:20.000 --> 31:25.000]  to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[31:25.000 --> 31:27.000]  It is the true digital economy.
[31:27.000 --> 31:32.000]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent control.
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  I've been on there 28 years,
[31:34.000 --> 31:38.000]  and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God
[31:38.000 --> 31:41.000]  and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[31:41.000 --> 31:43.000]  But I got to tell you, out of everything I've done,
[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  resetwarstore.com is the most important,
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.000]  and it is now available.
[31:47.000 --> 31:52.000]  Now, the month of December 2021 is here at resetwars.com.
[31:52.000 --> 31:56.000]  Start your journey to the next level today at resetwars.com.
[31:56.000 --> 31:59.000]  The globalist, fear this information.
[31:59.000 --> 32:00.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[32:02.000 --> 32:03.000]  Welcome.
[32:03.000 --> 32:04.000]  Hello, Alex.
[32:04.000 --> 32:05.000]  Yes, Malcolm.
[32:05.000 --> 32:07.000]  All right, I will make this quick and real short
[32:07.000 --> 32:09.000]  where the other patrons can get on the line.
[32:09.000 --> 32:12.000]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts,
[32:12.000 --> 32:13.000]  Owen Schroyer.
[32:13.000 --> 32:17.000]  Supermell Vitality and Brainforce Plus. Mix those two together.
[32:17.000 --> 32:19.000]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.000]  Supermell Vitality really, really works.
[32:21.000 --> 32:24.000]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[32:24.000 --> 32:26.000]  that have never been heated up,
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.000]  and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[32:30.000 --> 32:32.000]  It also worked quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  This is like a very fine wine.
[32:34.000 --> 32:36.000]  In fact, each batch is different.
[32:36.000 --> 32:39.000]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[32:39.000 --> 32:40.000]  People are like, why are you selling something
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[32:42.000 --> 32:43.000]  That's just how it is.
[32:43.000 --> 32:44.000]  It's how it works.
[32:44.000 --> 32:46.000]  So it's always good.
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.000]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[32:48.000 --> 32:51.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls-Royce at a decent price,
[32:51.000 --> 33:13.000]  then this is it.
[33:21.000 --> 33:39.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000]  from the front lines of the Info War.
[33:45.000 --> 33:51.000]  Let me try to put bookends on what I was just saying earlier
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  in the last segment about the parallels
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.000]  and the paradox at the same time between Joe Rogan,
[33:58.000 --> 34:01.000]  Tucker Carlson, myself,
[34:01.000 --> 34:07.000]  and the different types of people in different world views.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  Joe Rogan now knows this is a dystopic depopulation takeover
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  and you see him getting more hardcore every day.
[34:12.000 --> 34:13.000]  I told you a year and a half ago
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  that was about to happen because he personally told me it was
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.000]  and he's just more of a smooth operator.
[34:18.000 --> 34:22.000]  So he did it his way where he would be in control
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  and couldn't be censored.
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.000]  Info Wars is the only other place at that level,
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  or even close to that level,
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  where you have true independence.
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  And so that's something very, very special.
[34:33.000 --> 34:34.000]  And so that's how God works,
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.000]  that right as the enemy tries to shut us down
[34:37.000 --> 34:38.000]  and persecutes us,
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  it only shows other people how accurate we were
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  and as everything we talked about comes true
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  in the last 28 years,
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  the credibility goes way up,
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.000]  so that then makes the enemy turn up the heat even more
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  to attack us.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  And let me tell you about the Democratic Party
[34:58.000 --> 35:01.000]  and American and globalist corporations.
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  They are completely criminal now.
[35:04.000 --> 35:05.000]  And I don't mean just at the top,
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  they've been criminal a long time.
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  They are criminal down to the grassroots.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  I'm not ready to talk about this yet.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  I should be by next week.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  I'm having to get permission from some of the people
[35:15.000 --> 35:19.000]  that have also been persecuted.
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.000]  But the stuff they're doing to try to take us off air right now
[35:23.000 --> 35:28.000]  is beyond racketeering.
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  But this is next level.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  And that's why every broadcast we have here is very precious.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  Now, I made this sacrifice.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  I made the decision to do this.
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  I don't like it.
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  I don't like the persecution.
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  I don't like the attacks on my family.
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  I don't like the corruption.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  I don't like the dirty tricks.
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  But it's something that's got to be done
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.000]  because not standing up against evil
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  has let it grow out of control
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  and gotten us into the position we're in right now.
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  And so here's what I'm trying to get at.
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.000]  I'm going to finish on this point.
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  It's a subtle point, but it's also very obvious,
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.000]  but also very, very complex.
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  Like anything simple, it's complex.
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.000]  It's multivariate.
[36:21.000 --> 36:28.000]  If we don't get out of our comfort zone,
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  we're going to lose.
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.000]  Because even if you are doing your top podcast
[36:37.000 --> 36:43.000]  and you still don't get that it's coming for you,
[36:43.000 --> 36:50.000]  even if you're worth $700 million or whatever,
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  then you're not getting the big picture
[36:52.000 --> 36:53.000]  and the enemy will win.
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  But if you see the full compendium of their whole operation
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  and pull back to a 35,000-foot view,
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  then you understand it and see the whole thing.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  But you've got to take it all in as the great reset.
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  You've got to take it all in as the New World Order,
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  not as window dressing or not as just political victories
[37:11.000 --> 37:18.000]  or tit for tat.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  And you've got to really get how dire our straights are,
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  not to be depressed, not to be down,
[37:25.000 --> 37:29.000]  but to realize what you're really up against
[37:29.000 --> 37:37.000]  so you know how to defeat it.
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  And that goes back to people like Ted Cruz
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  talking about political points.
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.000]  He is giving Biden his horrible, evil communist,
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  literal communist nominees, a bunch of them.
[37:49.000 --> 38:00.000]  So Biden put pressure on Germany
[38:00.000 --> 38:06.000]  to kill the Nord Stream gas pipeline from Russia into Europe,
[38:06.000 --> 38:11.000]  just like we got our Teescom pipeline killed.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  Now, I can see from a, quote,
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  America Empire first perspective
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  how cutting off European consumers from cheaper gas
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  and cutting money off from Russia could be seen as a hawkish,
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.000]  Americana-type move, but it really isn't.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  It's an act of espionage.
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  It's an act of blockading.
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  It is an act of siege.
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  It is an act of war.
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  Just like when Biden turned off the Teescom pipeline
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.000]  right when it got finished,
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  that would have made American consumers and workers
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.000]  billions of dollars a week
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  and billions of dollars a week in savings at the pump.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  But we didn't get that
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  because the globalist being counters decided
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  they weren't going to let prices go down.
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  They want more expensive energy, not less.
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  So there's an example.
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  We get evil ideology and a bunch of people
[39:10.000 --> 39:16.000]  that Russia has rejected.
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  And then we actually get them as federal judges
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  and the heads of federal agencies,
[39:21.000 --> 39:29.000]  and that's a victory for Ted Cruz.
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.000]  To be opposing a country and leadership
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  more akin to what America was founded on
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.000]  then the groups run in the country right now here today
[39:39.000 --> 39:44.000]  and then engaging in something like that.
[39:44.000 --> 39:49.000]  That's a deep state move right there.
[39:49.000 --> 39:54.000]  But we are hearing more and more from Senator Rand Paul.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  Rand Paul, Fauci will retire.
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  Republicans take over the House and Senate.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  And I will investigate the cover-ups.
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.000]  Oh, the cover-ups like them making it at Wuhan
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.000]  and deploying it and already having the vaccine ready.
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  You mean stuff like that, the vaccine you pushed
[40:12.000 --> 40:19.000]  and that you still aren't telling people it's dangerous?
[40:19.000 --> 40:27.000]  I mean, is it time to put the Hitler mustache on Rand Paul?
[40:27.000 --> 40:30.000]  I mean, both these guys are doctors.
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.000]  They can read studies all day, can't they?
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  And again, I am trying to pressure these people
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.000]  to go to the right thing and save all these children.
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  You know, like Dr. Robert Malone,
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  the inventor of mRNA,
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  coming out issuing an emergency warning last week
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  to parents listing off the CDC's own admissions
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  and the FDA's own admissions of how
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  it can cause blood clots and cancer in a very high percentage.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  And of course, he's banned on Twitter now.
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  But I guess we're not going to see old Rand Paul banned on there
[41:02.000 --> 41:10.000]  because Rand Paul's not going to tell you there's a problem.
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  All right, we're going to go to break
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.000]  and I'm going to come back with the Gisela and Maxwell trial stuff, I promise.
[41:14.000 --> 41:15.000]  Is it a victory? Is it a defeat?
[41:15.000 --> 41:16.000]  I'll give you my opinion.
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.000]  We'll open the phones up next hour into the third and fourth hour today
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.000]  and get your take on that.
[41:21.000 --> 41:24.000]  And Mike Adams joins us in the fourth hour.
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.000]  I've got an exciting announcement if you'd like to try to keep us on air
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  plus you get great products at the same time
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  because that is one of the biggest stresses we've got.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  We've got enough money in here to stay on air
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  and I couldn't imagine the world without InfoWars
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.000]  and quite frankly, that's the world we're going to have in six months to a year
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  if I don't raise some extra capital.
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  So I want to thank you all for your ongoing support
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  plus these are great products you already need.
[41:44.000 --> 41:50.000]  They told me two days ago that X2 would be back in by the day and it is.
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  And they also told me that Winter Sun would be in by the day.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  All made right here in America.
[41:55.000 --> 41:56.000]  But it's not.
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.000]  It's been delayed to next week because of trucking problems.
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.000]  And so I ran ads today that I cut yesterday saying,
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  hey, X2 is here, which it is.
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  And that Winter Sun is here, which it's not.
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  But the X2 is back in stock.
[42:09.000 --> 42:10.000]  It's sold out for months.
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  The Deep Earth Crystal, iodine, highest quality.
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  So many people have iodine deficiency.
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  So many people can't absorb iodine that is bound in with other compounds.
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  This is atomic, meaning it's not radioactive.
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  It's on the periodic table.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  It is pure.
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.000]  And it is available exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  And it's so good for your immune system as well.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  50% off.
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  And we're also extending vitamin mineral fusion discount
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  even though it's selling out from 40% to 50% off.
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  So that's also good for your immune system.
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  So we have vitamin mineral fusion, 50% off.
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  And X2 back in stock sold out for three or four months.
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  It is 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  It's absolutely essential and it funds the operation.
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.000]  I'm cutting this announcement on the morning of December 28, 2021.
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.000]  And that means you've only got until Thursday morning
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  or less than two days to take advantage of the biggest sales of 2021.
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  Up to 60% off on our best-selling products,
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  double-patriot points, and store-wide free shipping.
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  DNA Force Plus is about to go off sale.
[43:25.000 --> 43:28.000]  Vitamin Rolfusion is about to go off sale.
[43:28.000 --> 43:33.000]  Ultimate bone broth that we finally got reformulated back in stock.
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.000]  It is going to be ending its sale along with more than 50 other products
[43:37.000 --> 43:40.000]  at infowarstore.com and the free shipping.
[43:40.000 --> 43:46.000]  So you've got until Thursday to get the best deals of 2021
[43:46.000 --> 43:47.000]  and they're gone and they're over.
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  We were going to run them through to the new year,
[43:49.000 --> 43:51.000]  but most of these products have almost sold out.
[43:51.000 --> 43:52.000]  A lot of already sold out.
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  So thanks for keeping us on the air.
[43:54.000 --> 43:55.000]  These are great products.
[43:55.000 --> 44:17.000]  A win-win infowarstore.com.
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials.
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[44:32.000 --> 44:37.000]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[44:37.000 --> 44:40.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[44:40.000 --> 44:41.000]  It is not an antihistamine.
[44:41.000 --> 44:44.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts
[44:44.000 --> 44:47.000]  by blocking the activity of triptase,
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[44:54.000 --> 44:59.000]  Head to infowarstore.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[44:59.000 --> 45:02.000]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action,
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.000]  Half the population has lined up for an untested,
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.000]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.000]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.000]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[45:17.000 --> 45:21.000]  of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence,
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.000]  hive mind, in less than nine years.
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell,
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  we know this is all really happening,
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  But there is only two things to do.
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.000]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[45:37.000 --> 45:40.000]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.000]  But even when we win, and we eventually will,
[45:43.000 --> 45:46.000]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.000]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods,
[45:50.000 --> 45:55.000]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios,
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  and life-saving knowledge at InfowarsStore.com.
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.000]  Not just across the United States, but across the world.
[46:02.000 --> 46:05.000]  You see it on the sides of barns and on bumper stickers, on cars,
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.000]  and written on the side of bathroom walls, Alex Jones was right.
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.000]  That's become a maxim of people to communicate to others
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  that they see through the fraud of the New World Order,
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the Great Reset.
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  And so now Infowars' credibility is stronger than it's ever been.
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  And the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  after all their other attacks, and we can't let them do that.
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  So, you've invested in Infowars over the years.
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now into critical juncture.
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.000]  Or everything you've done in the past is for nothing.
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.000]  You have invested in justice and the truth, and hardcore populace.
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  You have done incredible things.
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  And I'm telling you now, going in 2022,
[46:46.000 --> 46:49.000]  Infowars has major underages to run an operation,
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  and we need more funds in.
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.000]  So it's a 360-Wing.
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  Get great products that are great for you and your family,
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  your immune system, and so much more.
[46:56.000 --> 47:22.000]  So please go to infowars.com.
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  My point earlier was we need to get desperate, we need to get really concerned.
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  We need to get out of our comfort zones.
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  We need to really expose what's happening.
[47:30.000 --> 47:36.000]  The major globalist depopulation operation is happening now.
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  And that it's our job and our responsibility to go out and defend the children
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  and to expose these people.
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  And to go out to the clinics and hold up banners
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  and educate the people going inside
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  and not let the system bring in a medical tyranny and try to force this garbage,
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  not just on us, but on consenting children.
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  Lord Nishogi said,
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  The way of the samurai is desperateness.
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.000]  Ten men or more cannot kill such a man.
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  Common sense will not accomplish great things.
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  Simply become insane and desperate.
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.000]  In the way of the samurai, if one uses discrimination, he will fall behind.
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  One needs neither loyalty nor devotion,
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  but simply to become desperate in the way.
[48:20.000 --> 48:29.000]  Loyalty and devotion are of themselves within desperation.
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.000]  And I have to say, I am desperate, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.000]  I am a desperate man.
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  And I should be desperate. I'm fighting pure evil.
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  But at least I know what I'm fighting.
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  The children don't know what hit them.
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.000]  And I will tell you
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  that you are an eternal being.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  You have a spirit. You have free will.
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  You are just manifesting in this body.
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.000]  And if you don't fight Klaus Schwab and Mill Gates
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  and the New World Order,
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.000]  God is going to separate you from the universe.
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  And you don't want that.
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.000]  Now, things are very paradoxical.
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.000]  And I notice what I do later in the day is not like what I do in the morning.
[49:17.000 --> 49:20.000]  Especially if I get up at 2, 3 in the morning because I can't sleep
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  and then I'm up here at 6, 7 at night.
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  And I shot a report last night where I said,
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  this is basically a big victory that Gisela and Maxwell got convicted.
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.000]  Because now it admits that her and Epstein were running child kidnapping rings.
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  He'd already been convicted before, but they tried to cover it up.
[49:33.000 --> 49:39.000]  So that's a victory in and of itself.
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  But is it a pyrrhic victory? And what is a pyrrhic victory?
[49:43.000 --> 49:49.000]  A pyrrhic victory is where you win a battle,
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.000]  but down the road it costs you so much you lose the war.
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  So I shot a video last night.
[49:55.000 --> 49:58.000]  Gisela and Maxwell convicted of deep state child sex trafficking.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  Alex Jones responds.
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  And overall, you know, it's my first take on it.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  And I said, this is a victory.
[50:04.000 --> 50:13.000]  And it was and is a victory.
[50:13.000 --> 50:18.000]  But when you actually drill down into what happened overall,
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.000]  it was a very limited victory.
[50:21.000 --> 50:25.000]  And it is a great success for the actual pedophile rings
[50:25.000 --> 50:31.000]  that Epstein and Maxwell simply worked for.
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  And I'm going to be going over some of that here in just a moment.
[50:34.000 --> 50:41.000]  But we've gotten the trouble we're in
[50:41.000 --> 50:46.000]  because we've not been desperate to help other people.
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  We've not been desperate to stand up for our rights.
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  We've not been hungry.
[50:52.000 --> 50:58.000]  And so in come the slimy opportunistic intelligence agency criminals
[50:58.000 --> 51:02.000]  that Gisela and Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein are just a dime a dozen.
[51:02.000 --> 51:07.000]  And this is the mafia cult culture they set up.
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.000]  I mean, I remember being on air 10 years ago, 12 years ago,
[51:11.000 --> 51:17.000]  when they supplied condoms to the Boy Scouts, quote, jamboree,
[51:17.000 --> 51:20.000]  with more than 30,000 Boy Scouts at it,
[51:20.000 --> 51:24.000]  and that they were basically inducting them into pedophilic sex
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.000]  as young as age seven and eight.
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  And I said, this will be used to bankrupt the Boy Scouts of America
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  and take it over, then the left will run it,
[51:33.000 --> 51:38.000]  and then it will be turned into a transgender cult, which it is now.
[51:38.000 --> 51:41.000]  Nothing against the Boy Scouts, nothing against people that have been in it.
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[51:43.000 --> 51:46.000]  They took over a good institution and they ruined it.
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  The very same group, the very same cult,
[51:50.000 --> 51:54.000]  because once they got a bunch of pedophilia going on in the Boy Scouts,
[51:54.000 --> 51:58.000]  once the Boy Scouts tried to cover it up the first few years
[51:58.000 --> 52:01.000]  because they had globalist lawyers in control,
[52:01.000 --> 52:06.000]  then they blackmailed the whole organization and they took it over.
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.000]  And they're still handing out the condoms,
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  and they're still doing all this.
[52:11.000 --> 52:15.000]  These are formulas,
[52:15.000 --> 52:20.000]  82,000 claims of sex abuse in the Boy Scouts,
[52:20.000 --> 52:25.000]  a good, wholesome American organization teaching honesty and reliance
[52:25.000 --> 52:30.000]  and outdoors understanding and craftsmanship,
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  all of it thrown down the toilet by the same satanic New World Order
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.000]  that's now turning the public schools into this.
[52:38.000 --> 52:41.000]  And putting the boys in the girls' bathroom and on and on and on.
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.000]  This is a group of people that hate humanity
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  and hate the natural order of humanity
[52:47.000 --> 52:53.000]  and who are in there literally with an alien spirit.
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  They're making human animal clones that are alien.
[52:55.000 --> 52:58.000]  They're making viruses that are synthetic that are alien.
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  They're saying we're going to merge with silicon
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  and they're going to become gods. That's all alien.
[53:03.000 --> 53:08.000]  It's all alien inspired.
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  Notice I don't talk about little green men or flying saucers.
[53:10.000 --> 53:13.000]  That's not what's going on here.
[53:13.000 --> 53:16.000]  You're aliens of the day or you're demons of old
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  and it's an interdimensional attack.
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  And notice the system doesn't laugh at that.
[53:20.000 --> 53:23.000]  They all take it deadly serious
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  because they all are on board with this
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  and they've signed up with it.
[53:29.000 --> 53:33.000]  And the currency of entering the New World Order
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.000]  is hurting children and hurting humanity
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.000]  and destroying our very future.
[53:39.000 --> 53:44.000]  That's how you get on board with the Rockefeller program
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  that is not human.
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  I mean, look at John D. Rockefeller the first.
[53:48.000 --> 53:51.000]  You think that's a human?
[53:51.000 --> 53:54.000]  No, that's an avatar jacked in right there.
[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  100%.
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  100%.
[53:59.000 --> 54:05.000]  And these creatures aren't even as advanced as us,
[54:05.000 --> 54:12.000]  but they are aware.
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  And it looks like older in a way.
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  We're not sure.
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  So they're like really stupid,
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  but they know tricks to manipulate us and control us.
[54:21.000 --> 54:24.000]  And so that's why they jack in to humans that will work with them
[54:24.000 --> 54:27.000]  and are able to take over and do so much
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  because we don't go around trying to cheat each other
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  and do all this stuff, but they do.
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  And they have their methodologies
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.000]  and their systems of control.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  So I'm not trying to build up the Epstein thing.
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  I really want to do a whole 20-30 minute rant on it,
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  and I'll do that when we start the next hour.
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.000]  I've already started there, but...
[54:49.000 --> 54:52.000]  You see, I'm teleprompter-free.
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  I don't get talking points somebody else gave me.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  And all these Democrat party-funded lawsuits,
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  they all kept saying, where's the talking points?
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  Who gives you your scripts?
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  Because, see, they're all not their own people.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  They all follow hierarchical orders.
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  And so to them,
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  that's why they default to us in both cases.
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  They said, we know you're run by somebody.
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.000]  We know you're given orders. We know.
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  And the judges just said, we know.
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  We're given orders.
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  We've been given orders to default you.
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  We've been given orders to destroy you.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  I mean, we're not our own people. You can't be real.
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  Like, you're not in charge of anything, Jones.
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.000]  You're a slave like us, right?
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  Right?
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  But see, not being a slave means
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  the multifaceted nature,
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.000]  not just the duality of man,
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  but the multifaceted thing.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  It's last night I was kind of like, I need a victory
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  and I want to feel good and thank God that evil woman got convicted
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  because, you know, they wanted to get her off
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.000]  and my hate of her made me say to myself it was a victory
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.000]  and I shot that video.
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  And from that perspective, it's true,
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  but that's a tired Alex,
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  not a fresh Alex.
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.000]  And a fresh Alex got up at 1.15 in the morning
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  because I couldn't sleep and really went and looked at it
[56:11.000 --> 56:17.000]  and I went, oh my gosh.
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.000]  The federal judge with the defense team and the prosecutors
[56:22.000 --> 56:27.000]  suppressed the black book of pedophiles
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  and they say they'll now be protected
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  and actually protected the child ring.
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.000]  The Chucky Schumer now is rewarding the judge
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  with a appellate court job with
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  and Schumer is heavily involved in the whole thing, of course,
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  with Uma Abedin and Weiner and all of us.
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.000]  So when you look at people
[56:45.000 --> 56:49.000]  and you think about who they are
[56:49.000 --> 56:53.000]  and you think about who stands against us,
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.000]  just remember that and know that.
[56:56.000 --> 57:01.000]  That when you see the people attacking info wars at the top,
[57:01.000 --> 57:06.000]  they are bottom line supporting child kidnapping rings and murder,
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.000]  illegal human animal cloning, baby blood farms,
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.000]  and hells that I'm not even going to tell you about on there.
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  You think that's as bad as it gets, it gets a lot worse.
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  I showed you mainstream news where Peter Nygard
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  has women have babies, his babies,
[57:22.000 --> 57:28.000]  he then drains all their blood and injects it in himself.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  I mean, you talk about just pitiful.
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  I mean, look at that judge.
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  Man, you talk about right out of hell, man.
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.000]  Good God, they have opened the pit on us.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  So we're going under judgment folks
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  and literal demons are now taking over the planet.
[57:42.000 --> 57:49.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.000]  2021 has been an incredible year.
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  It's been an incredible year for evil,
[57:54.000 --> 57:57.000]  but it's also been an amazing year for the global awakening.
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  It's hard to believe it's almost over.
[57:59.000 --> 58:02.000]  Christmas 2021 is now a thing of history
[58:02.000 --> 58:05.000]  and we are plunging into the most critical year,
[58:05.000 --> 58:08.000]  not just in US history, but world history in my view.
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.000]  So please continue to spread the word about info wars.
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  Please continue to pray for the broadcast
[58:13.000 --> 58:16.000]  because all of us together, including you the viewers and listeners,
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  are the tip of the spear and take advantage of Christmas sales
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  that will end Thursday morning.
[58:22.000 --> 58:25.000]  I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  This is only going to run until Thursday morning
[58:27.000 --> 58:30.000]  and the sale will end up to 60% off.

[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  we put in info wars live products
[58:54.000 --> 58:56.000]  and that's why for more than two years
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth
[58:58.000 --> 59:01.000]  and we could never get the ingredients again until now
[59:01.000 --> 59:04.000]  and we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients,
[59:04.000 --> 59:07.000]  we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[59:07.000 --> 59:09.000]  So out of all the bone broths out there,
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.000]  I'm telling you this is next level.
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.000]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  It's a bone broth protein isolate powder
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  for better flavor and dissolvability.
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom,

[59:29.000 --> 59:31.000]  like magnesium, potassium and sodium added.
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  I mean this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[59:33.000 --> 59:36.000]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder
[59:36.000 --> 59:39.000]  with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  and it just goes on and on.

[59:45.000 --> 59:48.000]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com
[59:50.000 --> 59:55.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[59:55.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  With the truth of the Ghislaine Maxwell Conviction
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  when we come back in the next segment.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  But first let's go ahead and go to this report.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  Realtors removed, crime, heat map, here it is.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  Police announcing they have this man in Cuddy,
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  25-year-old Willie Suarez-Maseo,
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  a licensed South Florida real estate agent
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  who boasts expertise in the stock market
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  but who detectives are now calling a serial killer.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  When considering to buy a home,
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  crime statistics are at the top of the list.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  Hello?
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Baltimore County 911, what is the address?
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  We just had a house blown up
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  and the house next to it is on fire.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  It's on a high level.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  A house exploded?
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  Yes.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  Maury and Kelly's, Maury and Kelly's.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  One subject down.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  Due to the current tsunami of cultural Marxist woke-ism,
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  realty sites are reimagining crime,
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  removing what were known as crime heat maps
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  and replacing them with vague safety data.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  As homicide rates skyrocket,
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  realtors are protecting their bottom line,
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  skewing reality and putting potential buyers in harm's way.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  The chaos erupted in Woodlawn early Saturday morning
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  when police say 50-year-old Everton Brown
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  ambushed and killed his neighbors in their home,
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  then killed another neighbor before police shot and killed Brown.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  He was about to burst and he bursted.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  According to court records, people living in this community
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  filed peace orders against Brown,
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  one just three days prior to the killings.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  WJZ also obtained a 2012 lawsuit Brown filed against the FBI,
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  claiming the agency was spying on him and demanding their records.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  He detailed alleged aerial surveillance of his home.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  A federal judge dismissed it,
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  finding no evidence of that surveillance.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  It's not like we haven't been saying nothing.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  We've been saying something for 20 years, 20 years,
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  and it was never, nothing done.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  A concerned InfoWars viewer recently emailed realtor.com
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  questioning if the crime map had been removed due to technical reasons.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  Realtor.com replied saying it had been removed on purpose,
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  defaulting to the popular corporate misnomer
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  that crime statistics are racist,
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  self-righteously purporting fair housing for all.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  The radical left argues that the redlining of black neighborhoods
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  that occurred before the 1968 Fair Housing Act is still alive and well.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  Therefore, the factual data simply informing an entire generation
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  that grew up under the progress of civil rights legislation must be eliminated.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  Hiding behind the socialist left's whining
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  is actually a Saul Alinsky-esque ploy
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  to poison the well of private home ownership
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  as the average individual tax-paying home buyer
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  has its power and freedom minimized
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  in favor of Karl Marx's 10 Planks of the Communist Manifesto,
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  which is morphed into the Great Reset,
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  abolishing land ownership.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  We have to prepare for a more angry world.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  Well, if you listen to Klaus Schwab in the Davos group
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  and Xi Jinping, the Great Reset is modeled after the Great Leap Forward.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  The theme of this year's Summer Davos
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  is shaping innovative societies in the fourth industrial revolution.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  What does an innovative society look like on your mind?
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  We are in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  Technology will change everything.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  Business models will also change society.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  We have to be prepared for it.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  What is necessary is to make sure that the population absorbs
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  all those changes and understands
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  that those changes at the end are beneficial for our lives,
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  for the quality of our lives.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  Are you sick of corporate bullsh**?
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  Send an email to feedback at realtor.com
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  and or write to David Doctorow, CEO of realtor.com
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  at 3315 Scott Boulevard, Santa Clara, California, 95054
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  and demand that the crime map be reinstated
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  before the practice metastasizes into a crime against humanity.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  John Bowne reporting.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  All right, folks, we're going down the pedophile rabbit hole state with us.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  Infowars was battle-hardened and wounded and punished and tortured
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  and demonized and lied about in the last 20-plus years.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  We've really gone through the most destructive year we've ever seen,
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  but so is the country, so is the world.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  And Infowars intends to go into the thick of the fight.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  We intend to get attacked.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  We also intend to win, but we can't do that without working together.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  So I wanted to thank all of you in this insane year.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  2021 for your support and for your promotion of liberty and freedom.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  And I want to encourage you all to understand that we're not backing down
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  and the Great Awakening is here.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  That's why the globalists are so scared.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  And I want to encourage you to take advantage of the best deals of the year
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  that we were going to extend through the first,
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  but we're selling out of basically everything,
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  so we have to end the sales Thursday morning.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  So I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  That means there's just two days left to get store-wide free shipping,
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  double-paid three appoints that was 60% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  Taddafile rings recruiting children and their mothers
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  to have their children perform sex acts on CNN-affiliated groups.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  That's the big business, pimping of children.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  So here it is, cover-up complete.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  Gisela and Maxwell found guilty of sex trafficking.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  A minor, Epstein's network escapes all accountability.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  InformationLiberation.com did really the best report out there.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  It's linked on Infowars laying it all out.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  And some will say, paradoxically, well, Alex, you did a video last night saying
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  this is a victory that she was convicted.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  Yes, but still the network that is running this has been protected,
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  but at least some of their top operatives have been busted.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  They had to kill one to cover it up,
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  and now they're going to send her away from prison for a long time.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  And her, the fitters, and the prosecution, and the judge all agree,
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  and I've got the quotes right here,
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  that we don't need to make a big circus out of this.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  That's the quote, we're not going to release anybody in the black book.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  Well, so you're going to aid and abed.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  That's what Mr. Nathan's doing.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  Aid, I mean, this guy, this judge, Mr. Nathan, is doing,
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  I'm sorry, it's a lady, Allison Nathan, a literal protege of Chuck E. Schumer.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  Chuck E. Schumer, you know, you got Wiener, you got Hubeh Abedin, you got it all,
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  and then you got Mr., I mean, sorry, not Mr. Rogers, Mr. Nathan.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  Not, I'm sorry, Allison Nathan.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  And so, you know, here's Allison Nathan, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  Don't all you leftist young Turks feel good and all the other leftist shows,
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  you know, defending this and covering it up and doing all this.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  Don't you feel good about yourselves now?
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  Because even if you're not pedophiles, I mean, the head of the young Turks says
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  he fantasizes about pleasuring animals.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  I mean, by the way, people think I'm joking.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  Pull up a sink uger or whatever his name is,
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  talk about how he wants to pleasure animals,
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  and he just starts licking his lips very excitedly.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  Sorry, Jesus can't make this up.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  Imagine being all these people, and now they're sealing it all.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  They're not going to prosecute anybody of the people that came,
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  including Prince Charles' brother, to have sex with 14 and 15 and 16-year-old girls,
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  many times that were purchased at age 7, 8, or 9 by Epstein in Eastern Europe
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  and flown to these islands and then groomed over years of sex slavery
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  to then be recruiters and kidnappers of other women.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  I mean, they have airlines that Epstein ran, private airlines with 14,
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  15-year-old stewardesses that had been kidnapped years before.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  And then those women are used, those little girls are used to recruit more people.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  And by the way, the young Turks leader, I'm not joking,
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  look back on screen, I forgot, he didn't just fantasize about having sex with animals
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  and pleasuring them, and he would make it legal if he was world dictator.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  So he's also fantasizing about, well, you think about being world dictator,
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  what would you do?
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  The first thing that pops in your head, and not the hundredth,
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  at least in my mind, or the 10,000th, is pleasuring animals.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  But first thing, when you're dictator of the world is, have sex with animals.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  I believe that if I were the benevolent dictator of the world, it's very benevolent.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  You know, I would legalize bestiality where you are giving,
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  where you're pleasuring the animal.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  See, I want to have fun like you do too.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  In fact, I've got a lot of really funny things here today,
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  but you know, at the end of the day, that's not really funny, is it?
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  Sick.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  Let's continue here.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  Cover up complete.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  At least he didn't end the kids.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  I mean, he never really made any pro pedophilic statements,
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  though they defend some of the Democrat pedophile networks and things,
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  like CNN.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  I mean, look at that, look at him.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  Like if I was going to, I'm not saying he's into bestiality, even though he says
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  he would be the dictator that legalized it.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  I'm not saying that he has sex with animals.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  He just talks about how much he'd love to legalize it.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  But if I was casting somebody, do the wide shot, let's look at the mouth,
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  the mouth's the grossest part.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  If I was going to cast somebody in a movie that runs a pet store
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  so he can have sex with the animals, including the aquarium fish,
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  it'd be that dude.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  Come on, come on.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  If you had to ask a questionnaire, like is that a farmer?
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  Is that an auto mechanic?
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  Is that a soldier?
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Is that a teacher?
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  Is that a lawyer?
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  Yeah, he looks pretty scummy, maybe a lawyer.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  Is he a pedophile?
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  I don't know.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  No, he looks like he likes to have sex with goats.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  So if I was going to cast somebody who has sex with animals,
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  I mean, yeah, that's not a pedophase.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  That's a face.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  And seriously, either there's something in a face
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  where it just tells you what they're into.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  Me?
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  Inchiladas, cold beer, and Marilyn Monroe.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  Every day of the week.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  And I'll tell you about it.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  But see, he is over here telling you he's into farm animals.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  But let's get back to the serious news. This is really serious.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  And I'm joking around because it's hard for me to cover this.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  I'm sick of being serious. Believe me, I'm just like you.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  Cover up.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  But I am completely serious that he looks like a,
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  he might have said a bestiality.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  Cover up, complete.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  Gisling Maxwell found guilty of sex-traving,
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  a minor, Epstein network escapes all accountability.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  And why weren't they running bestiality operations,
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  you know, running out their fridge bulldogs?
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  Because that's not even illegal in most jurisdictions
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  and not prosecuted.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  So they would have been doing running,
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  they'd have a farm of bestiality
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  if they could get you blackmailed and controlled, okay?
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  Let's continue here with the,
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  with the queen of the cover up,
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  Mr. Nathan the judge,
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  the intelligence network behind Jeffrey Epstein
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  and Gisling Maxwell,
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  sex slave to her father, OSSCIAMI6.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  The intelligence network behind Jeffrey Epstein
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  and Gisling Maxwell's child,
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  sex-traving blackmail operation can sleep easy tonight
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  with Maxwell and President Epstein
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  allegedly six feet under.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  No, they broke his neck.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  They wanted to get rid of him. He's dead.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  He was not that important. He was a pimp.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  And then it just goes on from there.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  It's an excellent article.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  Here's the police raid on the Palm Beach
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  pedo compound. We're showing some video of that.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  But let's move on. Here's the London Independent.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  It's not just Alex Jones
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  that is
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  saying all of this.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  It's the London Independent.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  Gisling Maxwell's little black book
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  to remain secret after
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  Judge warns against needless
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  name dropping.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  Oh yeah, we don't want to needlessly
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  name drop who raped little girls
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  says the judge,
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  the good person,
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  the judge.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  I mean, they're good.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  I mean, she worked for Schumer.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  I mean, she's got to be good.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  There's
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  daddy pedophile right there.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  He had a nice ending
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  like Jeffrey Epstein, didn't he?
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  Another pimp
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  to Prince Charles and Prince Philip
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  and all of them.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  And Jimmy Savelle.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  Look, hey, where did daddy end up?
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  Same place.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  Jeffrey ended up dead.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  Are you paying attention, says
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  Jack Pasobak. The DOJ
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  and Gisling Maxwell lawyers have made
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  a deal that her little black book
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  of contents will never be made
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  public.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  And then we got all the charges
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  against CNN employees for
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  running child sex rings.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  And again, InfoWars is not
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  powered by
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  pedophilia. Sorry.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  But let me tell you, our enemies,
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  when I face our enemies, I see them all the time.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  They're pedophiles.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  I mean, I am literally,
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  so I need your prayers and support.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  I'm on the front lines battling
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  these psychic vampires who will
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  burn in hell.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  Out of Mineral Fusion is about to go off
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  sale.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  Ultimate bone broth that we finally got
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  reformulated back at stock. It is going to
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  be ending its sale along with more than
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  50 other products that
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  infowarsstore.com and the free shipping.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  So you've got
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  until Thursday
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  to get the best deals of 2021
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  and they're gone and they're over. We were
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  going to run them through to the new year, but
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  most of these products have almost sold out.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  A lot of already sold out. So thanks for keeping
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  these great products. It's a win-win
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  for you.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  Thank you.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  Thank you.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  Thank you.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  Thank you.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  Thank you.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  Thank you.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  Thank you.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  Thank you.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:00.000]  Thank you.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  Thank you.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  Thank you.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  Thank you.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  Thank you.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  Thank you.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  Thank you.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:16.440]  Absolutely part of the course because these people are marching to Satan's tune.
[1:23:16.440 --> 1:23:23.840]  These individuals are going along with a very, very satanic spirit, a transmission, a program.
[1:23:23.840 --> 1:23:25.480]  It's what it is.
[1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:31.160]  And you can dial into that or you can dial into God.
[1:23:31.160 --> 1:23:41.240]  And those of you that have been blessed enough to never get sucked into evil, you don't understand
[1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:43.960]  that.
[1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:48.000]  But you really should.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:53.200]  Because everything is about the theft of the innocent's energy.
[1:23:53.200 --> 1:23:58.960]  That's like in the movie, The Dark Crystal, that they did a remake of.
[1:23:58.960 --> 1:23:59.960]  I heard it's really good.
[1:23:59.960 --> 1:24:02.840]  I didn't watch it at any time.
[1:24:02.840 --> 1:24:06.840]  And the gulflings are childlike and simple and loving and good.
[1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:11.920]  They're the evil skexies that kidnap them and plunge these systems into them to suck
[1:24:11.920 --> 1:24:16.360]  their essence in their life force to live forever.
[1:24:16.360 --> 1:24:22.040]  And that's that same archetype that's in fiction over and over and over again because that's
[1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:23.680]  what these people are doing.
[1:24:23.680 --> 1:24:24.680]  That's really who they are.
[1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:30.200]  So if you want to wonder why Pfizer is so evil or why Fauci is so evil or why any of
[1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:33.720]  them do this.
[1:24:33.720 --> 1:24:43.080]  And it's because interdimensionally it gets them closely aligned with the transmission
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:51.680]  that they are wanting to receive.
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:56.360]  They don't look at a beautiful, healthy, happy little toddler learning about the world giggling
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:25:02.240]  and talking and they see them as a meal.
[1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:09.760]  They don't see children having a future as a collective future of all of us and our collective
[1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:11.960]  wealth that we want to kill for.
[1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:14.200]  Like we want to die for our children.
[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:16.600]  We don't want to physically die, but we'll die for them.
[1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:17.600]  We're ready.
[1:25:17.600 --> 1:25:22.280]  But instead of the TV and the culture, they literally suck their souls and suck their
[1:25:22.280 --> 1:25:26.960]  potential out.
[1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:30.000]  And everything they do is about corrupting the youth.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:32.880]  Everything they do is about enslaving the innocent.
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:38.640]  And we've got to just spiritually reject them and then say, God, I'm too weak.
[1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:40.160]  This is too big.
[1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:46.720]  I need you to take me over.
[1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:51.080]  And then as a metaphysical symbol of that, raise your hands and your fingers open like
[1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:54.280]  a plant in the sun and say, save me.
[1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:55.280]  Save me.
[1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:56.280]  Help me.
[1:25:56.280 --> 1:25:57.280]  I want to be good.
[1:25:57.280 --> 1:25:58.280]  I don't want to be satanic.
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:25:59.280]  I want to help other people.
[1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:00.280]  Energize me.
[1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:01.280]  Please, God.
[1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:02.280]  Please help me.
[1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:03.280]  I'm too weak.
[1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:04.280]  I don't know the words to say.
[1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:05.280]  Just help me.
[1:26:05.280 --> 1:26:06.280]  Help me, Jesus.
[1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:07.280]  Help me.
[1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:08.280]  That's what you've got to do.
[1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:13.560]  And those of you that are under satanic control, if you can physically do that, it's a big
[1:26:13.560 --> 1:26:16.760]  victory and you're going to feel a block there.
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:19.480]  You're going to feel a block there.
[1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:21.120]  And that's that satanic force.
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:26.760]  But the more you cry out, God, like a flamethrower or a laser beam, is going to burn through
[1:26:26.760 --> 1:26:27.760]  that hole.
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:31.560]  And you're going to watch all hell break loose in your family and all hell break loose in
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:34.360]  your life and all sorts of bad stuff is going to happen right away.
[1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:39.080]  And that's the devil using all his powers to threaten you to not join with God.
[1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:44.320]  And then as soon as it breaks through, you'll get to the next level.
[1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:49.840]  And then God will have missions for you, little ones at first, bigger ones as you move on,
[1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:54.760]  and where you're going to have to get ready each time you carry out the mission.
[1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:58.480]  Then the enemy comes in and attacks you and you got to get spiritually stabbed and burned
[1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:01.720]  and bit and attacked and lied about and crapped on.
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:02.920]  They shot at me and missed.
[1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:08.240]  They shit at me and hit, as they say in Wisconsin.
[1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:17.200]  And that's the process of each wave of the attack makes you stronger.
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:20.560]  Each wave of the attack makes the enemy weaker.
[1:27:20.560 --> 1:27:23.600]  And your physical body is not the symbol of your power.
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:26.880]  Don't look at the bodies of those that fight evil and we don't look like little sugar
[1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:27.880]  plums or whatever.
[1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:28.880]  And we got sc…
[1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:31.000]  That's the symbol of our victory.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:35.040]  We want to make sure these bodies are completely broken and worn out when we leave because we
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:36.640]  put the full mission in.
[1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:40.680]  We weren't glitter bugging around, we weren't hollywooding around, we weren't trying to
[1:27:40.680 --> 1:27:42.160]  candy ass around.
[1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:48.440]  We were here on this planet to make sure we guide the children to the light.
[1:27:48.440 --> 1:27:51.040]  I'm going to live forever.
[1:27:51.040 --> 1:27:54.240]  I'm going to cross that river.
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:55.240]  That's a high women's song.
[1:27:55.240 --> 1:27:59.080]  Well, you guys try to find that, get which high women's song that is.
[1:27:59.080 --> 1:28:00.480]  I'm going to live forever is the song.
[1:28:00.480 --> 1:28:03.040]  We got to play that whole thing when we come back.
[1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:05.280]  I'm going to live forever.
[1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:11.680]  Shawnee Cash singing it, I'm going to cross that river and that's what we need to know
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:12.680]  ladies and gentlemen.
[1:28:12.680 --> 1:28:17.120]  We're going to cross that river at the end when we die and God's going to say, I
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:18.120]  read you.
[1:28:18.120 --> 1:28:19.120]  I scan you.
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:21.120]  You're with me.
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:22.120]  That's all.
[1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:23.120]  It's your decisions.
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:24.400]  It isn't God that even judges you.
[1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:26.400]  That's the simple human way of singing.
[1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:32.400]  It's what we did encoded in our genetics and in our will and our action is read by God
[1:28:32.400 --> 1:28:33.560]  when we die.
[1:28:33.560 --> 1:28:39.800]  You're taken by that angel with her hand on you and if God rejects you, a literal black
[1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:44.520]  hole opens up and that angel looks at you and you drop.
[1:28:44.520 --> 1:28:48.200]  You don't want to go there, folks, believe me.
[1:28:48.200 --> 1:28:49.200]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:59.680]  Stay with us in full wars.com tomorrow's news today 2021 has been an incredible year.
[1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:03.840]  It's been an incredible year for evil, but it's also been an amazing year for the global
[1:29:03.840 --> 1:29:04.840]  awakening.
[1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:07.320]  It's hard to believe it's almost over.
[1:29:07.320 --> 1:29:12.200]  Christmas 2021 is now a thing of history and we are plunging into the most critical
[1:29:12.200 --> 1:29:16.160]  year, not just in US history, but world history in my view.
[1:29:16.160 --> 1:29:19.080]  So please continue to spread the word about it in full wars.
[1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:22.320]  Please continue to pray for the broadcast because all of us together, including you,
[1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:27.440]  the viewers and listeners are the tip of the spear and take advantage of Christmas sales
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:30.280]  that will end Thursday morning.
[1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:32.600]  I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:38.120]  It's only going to run until Thursday morning and the sale will end up to 60% off double
[1:29:38.120 --> 1:29:42.680]  patriot points and free shipping at infowarstore.com.

[1:29:54.240 --> 1:29:57.280]  The sale ends in just two days.
[1:29:57.280 --> 1:30:03.440]  So if info wars was battle hardened and wounded and punished and tortured and demonized and
[1:30:03.440 --> 1:30:10.080]  lied about in the last 20 plus years, we've really gone through the most destructive year
[1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:11.080]  we've ever seen.
[1:30:11.080 --> 1:30:15.800]  But so is the country, so is the world and info wars intends to go into the thick of
[1:30:15.800 --> 1:30:16.800]  the fight.
[1:30:16.800 --> 1:30:18.080]  We intend to get attacked.
[1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:22.280]  We also intend to win, but we can't do that without working together.
[1:30:22.280 --> 1:30:27.880]  So I wanted to thank all of you in this insane year of 2021 for your support and for your
[1:30:27.880 --> 1:30:30.000]  promotion of liberty and freedom.
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:33.480]  And I want to encourage you all to understand that we're not backing down and the Great
[1:30:33.480 --> 1:30:34.480]  Awakening is here.
[1:30:34.480 --> 1:30:36.000]  That's why the globalists are so scared.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  And I want to encourage you to take advantage of the best deals of the year that we were
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:44.360]  going to extend through the first, but we're selling out of basically everything.
[1:30:44.360 --> 1:30:47.600]  So we have to end the sales Thursday morning.
[1:30:47.600 --> 1:30:49.800]  So I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[1:30:49.800 --> 1:30:53.840]  That means there's just two days left to get store wide free shipping, double patriot points
[1:30:53.840 --> 1:30:56.920]  up to 60% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:56.920 --> 1:31:03.680]  In late August, info war saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[1:31:03.680 --> 1:31:10.080]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[1:31:10.080 --> 1:31:13.200]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[1:31:13.200 --> 1:31:16.480]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has always been something that's important to
[1:31:16.480 --> 1:31:17.480]  have.
[1:31:17.480 --> 1:31:21.920]  It's something that everybody needs to have taken care of right along with water filtration,
[1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:24.200]  self-defense and a relationship with God.
[1:31:24.200 --> 1:31:27.560]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in.
[1:31:27.560 --> 1:31:31.000]  Now we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  It's high quality.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:36.720]  It's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com because in the future, you're going to see
[1:31:36.720 --> 1:31:41.040]  more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are
[1:31:41.040 --> 1:31:42.360]  already taking place.
[1:31:42.360 --> 1:31:47.440]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the info war at info war store
[1:31:47.440 --> 1:31:48.440] .com.
[1:31:48.440 --> 1:31:52.640]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[1:31:52.640 --> 1:31:53.640]  control.
[1:31:53.640 --> 1:31:58.120]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[1:31:58.120 --> 1:32:03.520]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:04.520]  happening in the atmosphere.
[1:32:04.520 --> 1:32:08.880]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about NASA and other governments
[1:32:08.880 --> 1:32:13.400]  and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[1:32:13.400 --> 1:32:18.960]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[1:32:18.960 --> 1:32:21.280]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[1:32:21.280 --> 1:32:25.600]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s, 80s, and then it's going
[1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:26.600]  to be global warming.
[1:32:26.600 --> 1:32:29.600]  And when that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to, okay, now it's just climate
[1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:30.600]  change.
[1:32:30.600 --> 1:32:36.080]  But did you know that manmade climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United
[1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:40.000]  Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:43.120]  They have weather control treaties from 1979.
[1:32:43.120 --> 1:32:46.520]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[1:32:46.520 --> 1:32:51.080]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different
[1:32:51.080 --> 1:32:53.800]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[1:32:53.800 --> 1:32:58.800]  So yes, manmade climate change is real.
[1:32:58.800 --> 1:33:23.040]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:23.040 --> 1:33:31.160]  I'm going to live forever, I'm going to live forever, I'm going to cross that river, I'm
[1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:39.520]  going to catch tomorrow now, you're going to want to hold me just like I always told
[1:33:39.520 --> 1:33:50.000]  you, you're going to miss me when I'm gone, nobody here will ever find me, but I will
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:34:12.120]  always be around, just like the songs I leave behind me, I'm going to live forever now.
[1:34:12.120 --> 1:34:20.720]  Your father said you must be good to one another, please try to raise your children.
[1:34:20.720 --> 1:34:26.920]  Don't let the darkness take them, don't make them feel forsaken, just lead them safely
[1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:27.920]  to the light.
[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:38.920]  When this whole world is blown asunder and all the stars fall from the sky, remember
[1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:46.240]  someone really loves you, we'll live forever, you and I.
[1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:53.040]  I'm going to live forever, I'm going to live forever, I'm going to cross that river, I'm
[1:34:53.040 --> 1:35:00.240]  going to catch tomorrow now, don't be part of CNN, I'm going to live forever, I'm going
[1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:07.640]  to cross that river, I'm going to catch tomorrow now, check them all, stop pretending you're
[1:35:07.640 --> 1:35:17.160]  part of the power structure by serving evil, wake up and take action now, okay so let's
[1:35:17.160 --> 1:35:23.200]  talk about some of these sickening evil people and how pathetic they are because they're
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:27.000]  not the winners, they're the losers.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:37.080]  Don't let the darkness take them, don't make them feel forsaken, just lead them safely
[1:35:37.080 --> 1:35:47.560]  to the light, don't let the darkness take them, don't let them feel forsaken, just
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:57.120]  lead them safely to the light, powerful words of poetry, don't let the darkness take them,
[1:35:57.120 --> 1:36:02.880]  don't let them feel forsaken, just lead them safely to the light.
[1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:10.720]  We are having our children forsaken, all those we've aborted and killed including myself,
[1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:14.720]  I was involved in it and I repent of it, but now it's all out of the open, it's the born
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:18.920]  children in the world and we're collectively allowing ourselves to be part of this, this
[1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:26.800]  is such evil, God will not forgive us if we don't fight these people, if we don't stand
[1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:34.280]  against these people, we will be cut off from the Creator, that's why the enemy does this
[1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:42.240]  to cut us off and take control of us, Satan commits these crimes, Satan wants to serve
[1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:48.680]  God knowing that these are the ultimate crimes that can be committed so that God cuts us
[1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:55.600]  off, this is alchemy that Satan's engaged in, it's not a bunch of cutes and stuff, it's
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:37:07.560]  about who can I buy, who can I control, who can I get to do my will, let's talk about
[1:37:07.560 --> 1:37:17.520]  it right now, you know I knew Aaron Russo really good and I talked to him just about
[1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:21.360]  a week before he died, he was a great filmmaker and made a lot of big movies with Eddie Murphy
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:26.960]  and was a very smart guy and a big silver trader and I liked him a lot, one of those
[1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:37.200]  guys you hung out with he was like wow this guy's got a lot of life in him and he talked
[1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:41.680]  about how he was hanging out with the Rockefellers and they said we're going to collapse society,
[1:37:41.680 --> 1:37:44.600]  we're going to bring in a cash flow system, you're going to have to have a chip and if
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:48.280]  you don't do what we want politically we'll just turn that chip off, yeah there he is
[1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:54.800]  a couple months before he died in Houston getting cancer treatment, but he was also,
[1:37:54.800 --> 1:38:02.720]  I guess he was married to Beth Medler, yeah, and so when I see Beth Medler in the news
[1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:11.040]  I think about Aaron Russo and I think about what type of person you've got to be like
[1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:15.760]  Beth Medler who she had never been to West Virginia, it's a beautiful state, a lot of
[1:38:15.760 --> 1:38:20.960]  amazing people, but it is mountains and so you know mountain folks don't get to grow
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:26.080]  a lot of crops, mountain folks aren't as rich as other people, you know she came out last
[1:38:26.080 --> 1:38:29.000]  week and I didn't comment on this till now because I have a point to make on it and she
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:35.720]  said that Joe Manchin represents a population smaller than Brooklyn, by the way it's three
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:43.080]  times that, she's an idiot, has done to the rest of America who wants to move forward
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:52.560]  not backward like its state horrible, she wants us to be like his state West Virginia,
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:59.040]  poor, illiterate and strung out, this is a woman worth hundreds of millions of dollars
[1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:06.080]  in her little Beverly Hills Palace making fun of poor people and coal miners in West
[1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:19.520]  Virginia that her system is cutting off, she's the definition of a bully and I can tell you
[1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:24.160]  right now Beth Medler you're not going to live forever, you're not going to cross that
[1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:28.200]  river and I'm not here cursing you, I can just tell you lady you better get right with
[1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:32.120]  God right now, I don't know if you still can or what's going on people like you but let
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:37.160]  me just tell you something, your hatred of America is because we were once a Christian
[1:39:37.160 --> 1:39:41.720]  nation, it's the same reason you hate Russia today is because they're becoming a Christian
[1:39:41.720 --> 1:39:48.360]  nation again but you look at that arrogant monster, you think about Meryl Streep defending
[1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:54.280]  Norman Polanski and Betafilia and you just got to say to yourself what the hell's wrong
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:40:06.120]  with these people but it gets worse, we got people like Michael Bloomberg up there that's
[1:40:06.120 --> 1:40:16.440]  set up with an intelligence agency, three intelligence agencies it's all the same agency,
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:23.480]  a system 40 years ago to high frequency trade and shave points and manipulate markets and
[1:40:23.480 --> 1:40:29.960]  give live time data to Ronald Reagan's plunge protection team so they thought there was
[1:40:29.960 --> 1:40:33.560]  a stock market problem they could prop it up but they used that not Reagan these guys
[1:40:33.560 --> 1:40:38.200]  to manipulate so this guy's worth like 80 billion bucks or whatever it is last time
[1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:44.920]  I checked and he comes out with statements like we need to just get rid of farmers I
[1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:50.760]  mean what dumbass, I got the quotes what type of idiot you know needs to know how to put
[1:40:50.760 --> 1:40:58.840]  a seed in the ground and the statement of what type of dumbass what type of idiot I got the
[1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:02.280]  actual quotes here you've heard the quotes you know it doesn't take much to be a farmer
[1:41:02.280 --> 1:41:08.040]  other dumbest people ever all you put a seed in the ground yeah out there on your own property
[1:41:08.040 --> 1:41:11.960]  you till the soil you put it in the ground you try to keep the bugs remaining it you
[1:41:11.960 --> 1:41:16.600]  got to harvest it you got to get through the scammers they want to rip you off on delivery
[1:41:16.600 --> 1:41:20.440]  in the sale you got to deal with the combines and all the big companies that drive down the
[1:41:20.440 --> 1:41:25.800]  prices of your product you got to deal with your sick kids you got to deal with your sick wife
[1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:30.040]  you got to do I mean I mean being a farmer is rough folks I mean the ancient Greeks the
[1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:38.280]  Romans the Chinese every proverb praised farmers farmers are hard working people
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:47.960]  farm is a hard job and this little piece of crap sits up there and runs them down and says
[1:41:47.960 --> 1:41:57.320]  anybody can stick a seed in the ground just like West Virginia right they're all a bunch
[1:41:57.320 --> 1:42:02.440]  of meth heads they're a bunch of trash we don't need them no more we turned off the cold supply
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:06.920]  we don't need them to go five thousand feet down on the ground in mine anymore and get their
[1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:13.160]  lungs all filled up we don't need those men no more they don't like us in Hollywood sitting
[1:42:13.160 --> 1:42:21.480]  there in our fancy mansions they're pieces of crap they're almost as bad as those farmers in Missouri
[1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:27.560]  or those farmers in South Dakota or those farmers in California or those farmers
[1:42:30.760 --> 1:42:32.440]  where do these people come from
[1:42:32.440 --> 1:42:44.840]  up they attack everything that's good including our children and one day one day one day they
[1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:50.520]  are going to pay for what they've done we're going to stay strong and never surrender well
[1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:51.480]  they're right back stay with us
[1:42:51.480 --> 1:43:04.520]  everything I do is about victory for humanity everything I promote is about standing up against
[1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:09.640]  a new world order by empowering humanity well that's why reset wars.com is so important not

[1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:22.600]  but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure
[1:43:22.600 --> 1:43:29.320]  and American jobs it is the true digital economy it's the spiritual economy of the mind
[1:43:29.880 --> 1:43:35.960]  and transcendent or control I've been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing

[1:44:03.160 --> 1:44:11.720]  had in my 47 years on this planet I've had a lot of loss like everybody else has and it's because
[1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:21.160]  it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for
[1:44:22.440 --> 1:44:29.240]  and now we're just throwing it all away and I see the general public ENA medically induced
[1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:36.600]  scientifically induced behavioral psychologically controlled tranche and I know we're being fed
[1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:43.240]  into this global speaker under and it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth
[1:44:43.240 --> 1:44:48.760]  and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating collapsing and then coming back to
[1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:54.280]  life again it's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of
[1:44:54.280 --> 1:45:06.840]  decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it

[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:47.560]  fact that yeah for a guy in his 60s you know pushing 70 I'm and I'm no I'm not just blowing
[1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:53.960]  smoke here the b12 saves my life
[1:45:58.120 --> 1:46:02.840]  let's go ahead take another call let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee welcome hello Alex yes
[1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:07.080]  Malcolm all right I will make this quick and real short where the other patreons can get on the
[1:46:07.080 --> 1:46:12.680]  line uh Alex I have to promote one thing from one of your co-host Owen shroyer super male
[1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:18.360]  volatility and brain force plus mix those two together you're an unstoppable tank super male
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:23.960]  volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been
[1:46:23.960 --> 1:46:30.360]  heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[1:46:30.360 --> 1:46:35.400]  but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's like each batch is different
[1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:39.320]  sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay people like why are you selling something and
[1:46:39.320 --> 1:46:45.000]  admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong that's just how it is it's how it works uh so it's always
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:50.520]  good it's just sometimes it's like super strong but yeah if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price
[1:46:50.520 --> 1:46:51.400]  then this is it
[1:46:59.160 --> 1:47:05.160]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones
[1:47:05.160 --> 1:47:16.040]  country roads take me home to the place
[1:47:20.600 --> 1:47:21.640]  less Virginia
[1:47:27.720 --> 1:47:32.680]  there's Ben middler saying you're a bunch of trash because you don't want to put us in the
[1:47:32.680 --> 1:47:40.600]  debt to the bankers you don't want to cut off our energy it's like Bloomberg I mean who are these
[1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:46.760]  farmers I mean what do they do these dumbasses all you got to do is stick a seed in the ground
[1:47:46.760 --> 1:47:52.360]  there's not tornadoes there's not storms there's not bugs there's not rocks in the field there's
[1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:57.080]  not all the scams with all the big combines trying to rip you off when you try to bring your crop to
[1:47:57.080 --> 1:48:04.600]  market no no they're the bad people they're the ones out there trying to raise their families
[1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:09.000]  and grow crops that basically don't even exist anymore and they're the enemy because they're
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:13.640]  humans and because they're building something because they're close to the ground and they're
[1:48:13.640 --> 1:48:23.480]  real and these hollywood trash have declared war on us but I'm not pissed off at them because they
[1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:28.680]  are of their father the devil and they can't help it but I will tell you right now that all these
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:34.040]  candy ass republicans that sit up there and act like they're fighting a new world order when we
[1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:40.680]  know damn well what we're up against I want war against these people I want them exposed I want
[1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:47.240]  them indicted I want them arrested they committed plenty of crimes I want them off the backs of
[1:48:47.240 --> 1:49:01.080]  our children and I want them off the backs of our children now now now they're begging to be destroyed
[1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:10.760]  they're just begging for it they're just asking for it and all we need to do is culturally
[1:49:10.760 --> 1:49:18.120]  non-violently flame throw them with the truth barbecue their asses speaking of that we've got
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:27.880]  the first domino to fall oh almost into the show today folks because I am really close right now
[1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:31.960]  see I can't sign on to the civil I won't be part of this
[1:49:33.960 --> 1:49:40.360]  no the first domino to fall happened in Miami Florida we'll cover at the start of the next
[1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:46.040]  hour don't give the number I'll take your calls the first domino fell on the big ABC affiliate
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:52.120]  that's since gone nationwide the first domino to fall exposing the poison vax you saw
[1:49:53.320 --> 1:50:00.600]  Fox News host waters at CPAC or whatever the hell turning point whatever the republican event was
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:07.480]  yeah it was turning point this week over the weekend say be the kill shot on Fauci confront him
[1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:12.280]  running the Wuhan lab confront him creating the virus that'll destroy him and it's true
[1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:21.400]  you taking action is their defeat we already launched this contest five thousand dollars
[1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:26.520]  for every person that gets out nationally in this counts
[1:50:29.480 --> 1:50:34.600]  exposing the globalist agenda watch the info wars yeah put that hat on back up for me so I can
[1:50:34.600 --> 1:50:43.880]  read it watch the info wars photo bomb the info wars photo bomb challenge has begun
[1:50:52.760 --> 1:50:56.280]  by the way people will say like Jones you sound drunk right now I'm not drinking right now
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:51:01.800]  I'm drunk on the Holy Spirit right now I am hammered as hell right now on Christ
[1:51:01.800 --> 1:51:06.520]  seriously because I've been in a lot of pain worried about this stuff and the Holy Spirit
[1:51:06.520 --> 1:51:11.160]  is floods in them it's just like they get higher in the kite so that's the way it works and these
[1:51:11.160 --> 1:51:15.240]  satanists they get high off hurting children so that's their little thrill but uh
[1:51:19.720 --> 1:51:27.640]  we got that for you next hour I got that for you next hour you know it's a paradox like I said
[1:51:27.640 --> 1:51:32.120]  that almost even covering what they're doing is almost like giving them power
[1:51:33.480 --> 1:51:37.080]  unless you explain that's what they're doing then then we defeat them but I mean
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:41.720]  some of these headlines are just unbelievable I mean look at this one
[1:51:46.120 --> 1:51:52.840]  men's health you know you know men's health lift weights jog ride bikes you know get a massage
[1:51:52.840 --> 1:51:57.080]  uh take vitamins oh no no no you don't tune into men's health for that
[1:51:59.480 --> 1:52:04.040]  just like you tune into young turks learn about how great bcality is or you tune into like third
[1:52:04.040 --> 1:52:12.840]  grade english class or not great pedophilia is you you you read men's health to learn how wonderful
[1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:17.960]  men taking hormones so they can breastfeed is
[1:52:17.960 --> 1:52:21.160]  yes whatever the hell that means
[1:52:23.720 --> 1:52:29.720]  hormone kit that lets men breastfeed could be available soon and yes if a man takes enough
[1:52:29.720 --> 1:52:34.840]  hormones they might produce a couple of drops of milk a day you're not going to feed a baby
[1:52:35.960 --> 1:52:43.000]  it doesn't matter it's all getting you ready for this alien world of like oh there's clones
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  aliens oh there's gmo animal human hybrids oh there's transgender oh there's aliens

[1:53:50.200 --> 1:53:57.400]  for the lockdown in their own admissions for the economic collapse so you're like oh my bank account
[1:53:57.400 --> 1:54:04.360]  is not worth anything anymore you're probably wondering how that's going to work would you
[1:54:04.360 --> 1:54:10.120]  like me to tell you because i'm going to tell you exactly how it works because i've not only
[1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:23.400]  read about it and researched it i've seen it it's unbelievable you know if i don't do this we won't
[1:54:23.400 --> 1:54:32.280]  be here so let me just do this now um a couple of big announcements here first big announcement is
[1:54:32.280 --> 1:54:44.520]  i need to take some time off just because when you get so close to grindstone so long i want to be
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:52.520]  here all the time you you lose perspective so i don't want to create a big conspiracy when i'm
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:55:01.640]  gone for a while but you know i think at this point it's kind of becoming a place of what are
[1:55:01.640 --> 1:55:07.720]  you going to do kind of like i'm going to hand the baton to you you know i mean maybe i'll just be
[1:55:07.720 --> 1:55:13.480]  gone a month maybe five years maybe i'll walk out of here tomorrow and you never see me again
[1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:20.600]  that's really what i want to do i never want to come back here again my time is almost over
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:24.760]  my stories are almost over
[1:55:24.760 --> 1:55:36.120]  and you won't think that's dramatic once you figure out it's real but then i say support us keep us
[1:55:36.120 --> 1:55:46.920]  on air um it's a paradox it's a paradox everything's a paradox i want to stay on air i want to
[1:55:46.920 --> 1:55:54.280]  continue to fight but if i'm going to go crazy and i'm going to give out because i'm a horse that's
[1:55:54.280 --> 1:56:01.080]  been marching for a hundred years at a certain point it's not that i'm spiritually giving up
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:05.960]  it's not that i'm physically giving up it's not that the january 6 stuff did it or the
[1:56:05.960 --> 1:56:10.600]  divorce did it or the family violence did it or the lawsuits did it or the no it was watching
[1:56:10.600 --> 1:56:16.600]  everybody's smile and love the satanism and loving killing the children and and reading
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:26.280]  teleprompters and just god's now i'm i'm almost there like because i fall the holy spirit and
[1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:35.960]  the holy spirit is now literally showing me alex jones his end my exit no longer on air gone
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:41.640]  and then i think well i better do some good broadcast here at the end and maybe that's not
[1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:49.000]  what i'm going to do but i'll tell you for the first time in 28 years on air i've got one foot
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:53.880]  already out of this because you're gonna have to deal with this yourselves now they're coming to
[1:56:53.880 --> 1:56:59.400]  kill you and your family and and and i want to be here with you when this is all happening
[1:57:01.720 --> 1:57:07.960]  but if god tells me to never come back to the studio again and leave that's what's going to happen
[1:57:07.960 --> 1:57:16.120]  folks so every broadcast you watch every broadcast you see maybe my last
[1:57:18.200 --> 1:57:22.680]  now whatever happens i want to try to stay on air as long as possible
[1:57:22.680 --> 1:57:27.080]  we have the new sale you don't buy it won't be on air plus it's game changing they don't want
[1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:33.400]  you to have it the i9 conspiracy the good halogen conspiracy x2 back in stock sold out for months
[1:57:33.400 --> 1:57:41.800]  50 off the new sale at infowarstore.com but whatever it's up to you you want to support us keep us
[1:57:41.800 --> 1:57:51.880]  on air fine if not i understand well if info wars was battle hardened and wounded and punished
[1:57:51.880 --> 1:57:57.800]  and tortured and demonized and lied about in the last 20 plus years we've really gone through
[1:57:57.800 --> 1:58:03.960]  the most destructive year we've ever seen but so is the country so is the world and info wars
[1:58:03.960 --> 1:58:09.880]  intends to go into the thick of the fight we intend to get attacked we also intend to win
[1:58:09.880 --> 1:58:15.560]  but we can't do that without working together so i wanted to thank all of you in this insane year
[1:58:15.560 --> 1:58:21.160]  uh 2021 for your support and for your promotion of liberty and freedom and i want to encourage you
[1:58:21.160 --> 1:58:25.080]  all to understand that we're not backing down and the great awakening is here that's what the
[1:58:25.080 --> 1:58:29.720]  globalists are so scared and i want to encourage you to take advantage of the best deals of the year
[1:58:29.720 --> 1:58:34.520]  that we were going to extend through the first but we're selling out of basically everything so we
[1:58:34.520 --> 1:58:40.520]  have to end the sales thursday morning so i'm cutting this on tuesday morning that means there's
[1:58:40.520 --> 1:58:45.960]  just two days left to get store wide free shipping double patriot points up to 60 off at infowarstore.com
[1:58:46.920 --> 1:58:51.960]  not just across the united states but across the world you see them the sides of barns and on
[1:58:51.960 --> 1:58:57.880]  bumper stickers on cars and written on the side of bathroom walls alex jones was right that's become
[1:58:57.880 --> 1:59:02.920]  a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud of the new world order
[1:59:02.920 --> 1:59:07.480]  that they're saying no to claus schwaab bill gates and the great reset and so now info wars
[1:59:07.480 --> 1:59:12.520]  credibility is stronger than it's ever been and the globalists are now coming to try to shut us
[1:59:12.520 --> 1:59:17.400]  down after all their other attacks and we can't let them do that so you've invested info wars over
[1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:23.080]  the years i'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture or everything you've
[1:59:23.080 --> 1:59:29.560]  done in the past is for nothing you have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace
[1:59:29.560 --> 1:59:36.520]  you have done incredible things and i'm telling you now going in 2022 info wars has major underages
[1:59:36.520 --> 1:59:41.560]  to run an operation and we need more funds in so it's a 360 win get great products that are great

[2:00:23.320 --> 2:00:29.400]  not just here but a lot of places this planet is an embryonic base
[2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:40.600]  and the forces against god continue to come back again and again they keep coming back for more
[2:00:42.680 --> 2:00:46.760]  and they will fail hear this like what is he talking about
[2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:51.160]  and you look at the stars
[2:00:51.160 --> 2:00:59.240]  and then you come back and then you know we're trying to block what we're trying to stop

[2:01:24.680 --> 2:01:29.880]  coming back again you keep coming back for more
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:40.120]  all right let me give the number up enough of this goblin talking let's
[2:01:40.120 --> 2:01:50.680]  take the phone calls all right i normally say first time callers or open phones and
[2:01:50.680 --> 2:01:55.640]  and that's what we're doing again today is first time callers is i want to give people a chance
[2:01:55.640 --> 2:02:02.120]  that have never gotten on air with us before i want to hear from you on any subject you want to
[2:02:02.120 --> 2:02:10.440]  discuss but first amongst these in my little brain is man what do we do about trump i mean
[2:02:10.440 --> 2:02:14.120]  look it's one thing to think this is a real vaccine earlier and now we know it's a scam
[2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:18.360]  he's got to say no what do we do about trump do we just move on and not talk about him
[2:02:18.360 --> 2:02:23.000]  or do we go after his ass and try to make him get on the straight and narrow and then you're like
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:27.160]  well ram paul's a doctor he really knows what about him and so that begs the question
[2:02:27.160 --> 2:02:34.280]  but then more important than that what about the worldwide collapse what about the new world
[2:02:34.280 --> 2:02:39.960]  order what do we do to say no to these forced injections uh how do we rally humanity if i
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:45.160]  got a whole stack of news right here dealing with this as well with why like biden suddenly
[2:02:45.160 --> 2:02:50.440]  like oh it's up to the stage someone's like yeah you fail no that's their plan
[2:02:50.440 --> 2:02:57.320]  and or gizling maxwell tefri ebbstein's little pimp and by the way
[2:02:58.920 --> 2:03:05.000]  the crew put a shot at gizling maxwell 25 years ago with jeffree ebbstein

[2:03:12.840 --> 2:03:19.320]  kids around on now convicted and i saw what they were talking about the crews like why did you
[2:03:19.320 --> 2:03:24.120]  make that point well it's just kind of the certain point you stop making the point but it's obviously
[2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:30.680]  it's a devil's pitchfork is the symbol on the side of the airplane
[2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:37.960]  and now because we're not showing it to you look at 10 times bigger you're like oh my god is it true

[2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:54.680]  of the plane dill there it is so there's the jeffree ebbstein little little and he always

[2:08:29.640 --> 2:08:32.840]  you know look at today's show headline it's a pretty big deal
[2:08:35.720 --> 2:08:43.560]  thursday live think about what goes into that it's like live it's real it's independent it's
[2:08:43.560 --> 2:08:51.720]  it's it's it's it's it's in touch and then it goes on top scientists which is true
[2:08:52.440 --> 2:08:57.080]  around the world have reached a consensus
[2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:07.560]  the coveted vax is a depopulation weapon and i can play you hundreds of top scientists which
[2:09:07.560 --> 2:09:17.400]  we've done from dr michael yedon to robert malone to wolf king wudarg to dr zelenko
[2:09:18.040 --> 2:09:19.880]  saying the same thing because it's true
[2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:31.560]  but the full horror of that is so hard to deal with do you blame the general public for not
[2:09:31.560 --> 2:09:40.680]  being able to understand it and yeah the public's dumbed down and decadent in a way they do deserve
[2:09:40.680 --> 2:09:46.680]  to die but we're not god we don't make that decision and the people making the decision to kill
[2:09:46.680 --> 2:09:52.040]  everybody are the worst of us they should go first and i would tell you that at bill gates
[2:09:53.640 --> 2:10:00.200]  and ted turner and oprah wimphrey and prince charles here they went on tv and pulled out
[2:10:00.200 --> 2:10:04.920]  a gun and blew their brains off and said there's too many people were a cancer save the earth
[2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:12.360]  i would like well they've they've got some credibility with me but they don't have credibility
[2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:21.080]  they tell you you can't have a small space heater or a small car that you take people around as a
[2:10:21.080 --> 2:10:26.760]  job in africa remember obama six seven years ago went to african said you can't have air conditioning
[2:10:26.760 --> 2:10:34.200]  or cars he went to brazil and said it too he went to chili and said it so they're flying around on
[2:10:34.200 --> 2:10:41.080]  jumbo jets and helicopters and huge palaces and and they're like hey well you're in a one room
[2:10:41.080 --> 2:10:46.600]  apartment you you gave your child a piece of beef i mean you know that's bad for the earth
[2:10:48.440 --> 2:10:54.600]  it'd be like a guy that weighed 900 pounds telling some starving ethiopian hey what are you doing
[2:10:54.600 --> 2:11:02.680]  eating a sandwich you're hurting the earth you're like listen you demonic lard ass you are a joke
[2:11:07.560 --> 2:11:13.720]  so that's where we are i want to go to break and go to don dean and wane and george
[2:11:14.840 --> 2:11:23.560]  everybody else but yeah i saw photos yesterday of jeff bezos on his support yacht it's like 150 feet
[2:11:23.560 --> 2:11:29.080]  long and then his yacht's the size of an aircraft carrier and that's great okay people bought your
[2:11:29.080 --> 2:11:34.280]  stuff they did that whatever and he's there with his trophy wife spraying him off and he's all royed
[2:11:34.280 --> 2:11:43.880]  up looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger but then he literally funds black lives matter and lectures
[2:11:43.880 --> 2:11:50.520]  everyone on their carbon footprint and says you should all be poor and it's just like what again
[2:11:50.520 --> 2:11:58.280]  it'd be like a 5 000 pound man teaching a weight loss seminar on youtube you'd be like uh you weigh
[2:11:58.280 --> 2:12:06.520]  5 000 pounds yeah there's the photo you guys found it quick so there's jeff bezos juiced out of his
[2:12:06.520 --> 2:12:18.680]  mind with his new trophy wife on his support yacht and then he's lecturing everybody about our
[2:12:18.680 --> 2:12:27.480]  carbon footprint how about this jeff yeah here's more photos how about
[2:12:30.920 --> 2:12:36.440]  while you're out there all drunk with all your women you stop funding transgenderism
[2:12:36.440 --> 2:12:40.280]  trying to chop five-year-old boys balls off because listen you can go have your women
[2:12:40.280 --> 2:12:44.920]  and be on a yacht we love that great we love that man with a woman on yacht humans babies
[2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:50.040]  we're gonna build a thousand planets wonderful dude you have seven planets yourself but will
[2:12:50.040 --> 2:12:55.880]  you just leave us alone will you stop trying to hurt us will you stop trying to starve us
[2:12:56.920 --> 2:13:04.680]  oh but you're the alpha i get it i get it you're supposed to show us how it's done
[2:13:04.680 --> 2:13:15.320]  you get it yacht we get to starve to death i understand but i've taken a look at you and
[2:13:15.320 --> 2:13:23.080]  i'm taking a look at bill gates and i've decided that you're not our leaders and the people have
[2:13:23.080 --> 2:13:33.960]  decided you're not the leaders in case you haven't noticed and so i tell you now you will be destroyed
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:43.080]  as soon as the sun comes up if you don't start getting with god's program and if you don't stop
[2:13:43.880 --> 2:13:50.040]  serving satan and serving these lies and serving these frauds you think you're gonna be safe in a
[2:13:50.040 --> 2:13:55.720]  societal collapse that you're gonna organize and control and that you're gonna end up immune
[2:13:55.720 --> 2:14:00.840]  from this with you and all of your little drunken women out there on your floaties
[2:14:06.760 --> 2:14:14.200]  and you gotta love the wife i mean in every photo just posing posing posing posing
[2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:22.920]  in love with herself they both look like they probably took a hit of ecstasy when they're out
[2:14:22.920 --> 2:14:29.720]  there and they are just totally in this dream of the man and the woman together in paradise
[2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:36.760]  but they don't understand that if you don't try to give everybody else paradise god flushes you
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:47.480]  down the toilet see jeff if you don't attempt to lift up the poor if you don't attempt to empower
[2:14:47.480 --> 2:14:54.520]  humanity if you only pay lip service to it there's an ai intelligence buddy boy that built the whole
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:15:01.320]  thing not just this planet and it doesn't like you because it's not artificial intelligence
[2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:11.560]  it's truth intelligence it's infinity intelligence it's god intelligence it's unlimited intelligence
[2:15:11.560 --> 2:15:25.000]  and it doesn't like what you're doing so if bill gates is right there's too many of us
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:33.720]  and if jeff bezos is right there's too many of us everyone would respect them if they like
[2:15:34.840 --> 2:15:40.440]  they're rich they can have a pool put power lines huge power lines into it into the pool and just
[2:15:40.440 --> 2:15:44.360]  jump in just fry yourselves top your head'll blow off we'll just fry in the water it'll

[2:19:07.160 --> 2:19:12.840]  coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better than watermelon
[2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:17.080]  coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers that you know the media calls communists but really
[2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:21.320]  they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the
[2:19:21.320 --> 2:19:25.000]  farmers don't let the mexican government take over so i actually buy this from the mexican rebels
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:28.600]  and i've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at
[2:19:28.600 --> 2:19:32.920]  Whole Foods under another name for about 50 percent more per pound and i just think it's some of the
[2:19:32.920 --> 2:19:37.640]  best coffee you're gonna find anywhere it's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels
[2:19:37.640 --> 2:19:46.120]  literally um in fact i'm gonna tell you a little story um we had like that i think you won't believe it

[2:20:04.360 --> 2:20:15.800]  alex jones
[2:20:21.160 --> 2:20:30.200]  sirens jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great grandchildren believe you could live to 103
[2:20:30.200 --> 2:20:38.680]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid i just have one of my crew members say hey man are you
[2:20:38.680 --> 2:20:48.360]  drinking no i am literally completely freaked out i have been up since 115 this morning once
[2:20:48.360 --> 2:20:55.960]  been about 10 p.m and i'm just so upset i mean i mean i always wondered reading globalist documents
[2:20:55.960 --> 2:21:01.080]  and seeing their plans and seeing them beta test extermination in terrible countries what will it
[2:21:01.080 --> 2:21:07.400]  look like when they go planetary when they hit the whole thing and i imagined a lot of it made a
[2:21:07.400 --> 2:21:17.880]  lot of predictions that came true but i mean i've been doing this 28 years and i'm like seriously
[2:21:17.880 --> 2:21:22.840]  on air talking about maybe i can't keep going on and i'm not and then i feel like i'm letting people
[2:21:22.840 --> 2:21:31.720]  down you see that's thinking about the satan so they just feel good and enjoy killing everybody
[2:21:31.720 --> 2:21:45.400]  and they don't worry about things i do and i know you do as well so i mean info wars will
[2:21:45.400 --> 2:21:48.920]  continue on but maybe i should just quit maybe today should be my last broadcast
[2:21:48.920 --> 2:21:57.320]  doctor peter mccullis coming in tomorrow i'll be here for that but i might quit tomorrow actually
[2:21:58.520 --> 2:22:02.600]  and then just turn it all over and everybody else else too and i'm just done i mean maybe
[2:22:02.600 --> 2:22:07.880]  i've run my course and i'm not giving into the enemy i just i feel like my time might have come
[2:22:07.880 --> 2:22:13.800]  to an end here i mean i'm serious i'm really people know folks i don't just say stuff for dramatic
[2:22:13.800 --> 2:22:23.880]  effect this might this might be the end folks and there's so many weird reasons for it i can't
[2:22:23.880 --> 2:22:31.240]  really explain them but it's like i'm not supposed to be on air in the time that's coming it's not
[2:22:31.240 --> 2:22:35.080]  that they're gonna put me in jail or shut me down's the reason i would quit it's the opposite of that
[2:22:35.080 --> 2:22:43.960]  it's like they're gonna do that anyways i just need to get ready to die just like you're about to die
[2:22:43.960 --> 2:22:50.440]  that's all it's just it's almost obscene to be on air during this time chronicling the murder of
[2:22:50.440 --> 2:22:57.640]  our children chronicling the death i mean it's what god wants you know we did this we're all
[2:22:57.640 --> 2:23:03.720]  gonna die we're liberal now it's trendy we get our paycheck the left does i don't get it from the
[2:23:03.720 --> 2:23:10.200]  from the big banks and then we follow the orders and we die and it's liberal i mean all right
[2:23:14.120 --> 2:23:16.280]  you know i'm just telling you the type of things i'm thinking
[2:23:22.440 --> 2:23:29.800]  but the craziest thing i see is the talking point that the global's behavioral psychologist enemies
[2:23:29.800 --> 2:23:37.320]  of humanity use against us over and over and over and over again is
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:46.760]  that those of us battling globalism are the establishment when they're reading
[2:23:46.760 --> 2:23:53.880]  teleprompter messages from the most powerful ruthless corporations in the world and then
[2:23:53.880 --> 2:24:03.160]  they run around talking about how they are battling the establishment all right i said i'd take phone
[2:24:03.160 --> 2:24:15.880]  calls but i don't even know i'm gonna do that seriously because here's the deal i can try to
[2:24:15.880 --> 2:24:25.320]  prop up info wars but hasn't info wars kind of done its work i mean we always said we want to
[2:24:25.320 --> 2:24:32.520]  become obsolete at some point and i love this crew but if i'm gone then the crew can organize and
[2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:38.760]  do what they're gonna do and be who they are and and and and maybe that'll give them an incentive
[2:24:38.760 --> 2:24:48.040]  because they do a great job because i'm here on air right now i mean i'll tell you i'm not gonna
[2:24:48.040 --> 2:24:52.360]  be back for weeks at this point and i'm walking out of here i guess tomorrow is i got this gets

[2:33:16.280 --> 2:33:25.240]  i won't be much when you get through with me he never gives up he's alex jones broadcasting
[2:33:25.240 --> 2:33:40.200]  from deep in the heart of texas we got some really bad news here you know erin rogers the big star
[2:33:40.200 --> 2:33:47.640]  quarterback has now come out and confirm what we already know that they were giving him ivermectin
[2:33:47.640 --> 2:33:52.920]  and hydroxychloric one in the nfl to keep them good for games and that's why our people have
[2:33:52.920 --> 2:34:00.920]  been dying and people in europe have been in sports just insane and now leticia james uh the george
[2:34:00.920 --> 2:34:07.480]  soros attorney general of new york is threatening to sue just like she did us selling toothpaste
[2:34:09.960 --> 2:34:16.200]  anybody that sells ivermectin including medical doctors that give prescriptions though again the
[2:34:16.200 --> 2:34:24.040]  nfl has been secretly handing it out that's big pharma folks want to depopulate your ass i mean
[2:34:24.040 --> 2:34:30.440]  that is murder that's like not throwing a baby that falls in the pool life raft i mean it's just
[2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:37.320]  these people are so inhuman and they follow any orders they're given and it's so so sad
[2:34:37.880 --> 2:34:45.960]  and soros now has thousands of county attorneys and city attorneys thousands in charge and they're
[2:34:45.960 --> 2:34:51.880]  the ones that are letting arm robbers and others out to again break down society it's really a
[2:34:51.880 --> 2:34:58.200]  dangerous situation but here's part of radio host hue hue it interviews fauci rattles off
[2:34:58.200 --> 2:35:04.840]  extensive list of his failures and lies asking to resign number one write your calls i've lost
[2:35:04.840 --> 2:35:11.640]  confidence in the cdc and the fda and i actually believe a lot of americans a significant part of
[2:35:11.640 --> 2:35:19.720]  america now have lost confidence in you dr fauci is there a point where you will say i do more harm
[2:35:19.720 --> 2:35:27.800]  than good because people don't listen to me anymore and step aside no absolutely unequivocally no
[2:35:27.800 --> 2:35:33.960]  hue sorry there's a large and a small part doctor the large part is not i'll come back to the small
[2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:40.600]  part on the mask i'm told by people in the room that you knew there were a shortage of mass so you
[2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:45.320]  told people not to wear a mask so that we didn't have a run on masks i actually understand that
[2:35:45.320 --> 2:35:50.680]  is public policy i i've read the account i've talked to the people in the room i know that you
[2:35:50.680 --> 2:35:56.920]  purposely told the noble lie to prevent us running out of masks and hospitals i think it's bad policy
[2:35:56.920 --> 2:36:02.120]  but i understand the motive and i understand changing i change my mind every day you know i'm
[2:36:02.120 --> 2:36:07.560]  on the air every day stuff happens i change my mind but what you said earlier it's just fact
[2:36:07.560 --> 2:36:15.080]  sometimes it's just a fact that tony fauci not the guy i'm talking with but tony fauci the person
[2:36:15.080 --> 2:36:21.800]  in people's mind is now an impediment to public health because people won't listen to you they
[2:36:21.800 --> 2:36:27.160]  actively reject what tony fauci says for reasons which are complicated have to do with psychology
[2:36:27.160 --> 2:36:34.840]  mass communication social media but can you accept that if that's just a fact you ought to respond to
[2:36:34.840 --> 2:36:42.920]  it and say mr president i think my time is up as a successful and effective spokesperson you know
[2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:49.240]  with all due respect to you you who i i do respect you and your intellect i just completely disagree
[2:36:49.240 --> 2:36:55.400]  with that premise because there are an awful lot of people who do listen who do the right thing from
[2:36:55.400 --> 2:37:01.480]  a public health standpoint so because there are a lot of people who have ideas about conspiracies
[2:37:01.480 --> 2:37:07.400]  and changing minds and flip-flopping that's not a reason to step down not at all what i'm saying
[2:37:07.400 --> 2:37:14.040]  though is there comes a point where it is simply a matter of fact that tony fauci in the era of
[2:37:14.040 --> 2:37:21.720]  social media is different than tony fauci at the beginning of hiv and if a new face for the program
[2:37:21.720 --> 2:37:28.520]  developed we would see an increase in vaccines and an increase in booster use so that data is
[2:37:28.520 --> 2:37:34.280]  presented to you that more people would get vaccinated if you left the scene would you leave
[2:37:34.280 --> 2:37:41.240]  the scene uh you i think that is a completely false narrative that people are not getting
[2:37:41.240 --> 2:37:48.120]  vaccinated because of me i am very sorry i've told you i've known you a long time and i respect you
[2:37:48.120 --> 2:37:56.120]  but i totally reject that people are not getting vaccinated because of me are you kidding me hugh
[2:37:56.120 --> 2:38:03.000]  come on i i'm trying to explain you the truth i i got vaccinated because of you okay that's enough
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:07.240]  and that's you hugh it's his establishment person but he knows fauci's going down so
[2:38:08.280 --> 2:38:16.360]  he always jumps on right at the last moment but the point is is that it's not a vaccine
[2:38:16.360 --> 2:38:27.960]  you do it it's a freaking gene therapy you snaggle tooth possum all right let's go to the phone calls
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:39.000]  here let's go to let's go to oregon first let's go to oregon where sandra's at and i really appreciate
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:49.480]  her holding she's on the air sandra welcome hi hi um i what i want to say um is that i i've been
[2:38:49.480 --> 2:38:54.120]  listening to you or why shouldn't i i haven't been listening to you for years i've known about you
[2:38:54.120 --> 2:39:00.440]  for years um and a lot of the things that you were saying were really hard to get my mind around um
[2:39:00.440 --> 2:39:09.560]  um but i also would say that i would be very sad to see you go because i'm just now getting my
[2:39:09.560 --> 2:39:16.200]  faith back well i'm not trying to be dramatic i just have not taken off more than a week in in
[2:39:16.200 --> 2:39:22.360]  28 years and and and and i just i just feel like i mean i'm not being dramatic i mean i'm literally
[2:39:24.280 --> 2:39:28.840]  i love my crew i love the audience i love everybody but i'm sick of begging people to keep
[2:39:28.840 --> 2:39:33.960]  us on air i'm sick of all of it and if all the leftists want to die and take gmo's and
[2:39:33.960 --> 2:39:38.840]  burn in hell let them you know at a certain point i've already i've already told my story
[2:39:38.840 --> 2:39:44.200]  and and it's true and and and it's almost like sick to sit there and like now they're carving up
[2:39:44.200 --> 2:39:48.280]  another child now they killed another thousand children now another hundred thousand now they
[2:39:48.280 --> 2:39:53.000]  got the african kids lined up and starving to death the uids running the sex ring there and now
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  they murdered another and a certain it's just become sick almost like i'm a narrator in a snuff film
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:05.320]  does that make sense yeah no that's it's completely understandable i i always wondered how you did it
[2:40:05.320 --> 2:40:10.280]  i mean because it's the evilness that you see i always wondered how you've got your stories who
[2:40:12.040 --> 2:40:18.840]  gave you your stories and and you know the fact that you do it is unbelievable and it has to be
[2:40:18.840 --> 2:40:28.600]  it has to hurt your soul well it does hurt my soul and and if i don't so i just can't believe i mean
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:33.160]  i can't believe there's so many evil people but enough about that sandra what you're
[2:40:33.160 --> 2:40:38.920]  wondering about antidepressants tell us about us yeah i was okay so a little bit i hit you about
[2:40:38.920 --> 2:40:46.040]  myself okay my dad was also a pedophile i grew up in a in a quasi a jewish religious church not
[2:40:46.040 --> 2:40:52.520]  not uh seventh day as anist or uh but it was a mix of seven seventh day and jehovah's witness
[2:40:52.520 --> 2:40:58.600]  so there was a lot of uh you know jesus wasn't really even uh mentioned because he wasn't you
[2:40:58.600 --> 2:41:05.160]  know a uh he wasn't a savior he was just a a person that was born you know he wasn't really a
[2:41:05.160 --> 2:41:16.440]  prophet um and so i grew up with that um religious ideology um but but god touched me when i was you
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:23.320]  know a child um there were some things that happened above and beyond you know the the
[2:41:23.320 --> 2:41:34.200]  pedophilia yada yada yada um but god touched me then and i i then in his he saved me through
[2:41:34.200 --> 2:41:41.880]  many circumstances in my life and one of those a lot of the things came to me taking antidepressants
[2:41:42.920 --> 2:41:55.240]  because i have cp ptsd c ptsd and i believe that that the antidepressants are one of the things that
[2:41:55.240 --> 2:42:03.640]  the mainstream media or just the global thing that you're talking about put into place to see
[2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:09.640]  to make us dumb us down literally to try to say okay here's a pill take a pill it'll make everything
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:17.720]  better um well we know those pills are incredibly toxic just the body alone you try to argue whether
[2:42:17.720 --> 2:42:21.160]  it helps somebody it hurts somebody it might help somebody it might hurt somebody in my view but
[2:42:21.160 --> 2:42:28.920]  overall they're extremely toxic and cancerous oh yeah i yeah i uh i finally got off of them
[2:42:28.920 --> 2:42:37.240]  when i realized that um they my oldest son has known to you for years too i mean but there's a
[2:42:37.240 --> 2:42:44.520]  whole different subject with that but he is the one that told me um that those that those pills
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:50.120]  are really bad for you i i had an older brother that died while he was taking those pills one called
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:59.480]  imagine this elobo listen god bless you sandra thank you so much well if info wars was battle
[2:42:59.480 --> 2:43:06.440]  hardened and wounded and punished and tortured and demonized and lied about in the last 20 plus years
[2:43:06.440 --> 2:43:12.680]  we've really gone through the most destructive year we've ever seen but so is the country so
[2:43:12.680 --> 2:43:18.600]  is the world and info wars intends to go into the thick of the fight we intend to get attacked
[2:43:18.600 --> 2:43:24.120]  we also intend to win but we can't do that without working together so i wanted to thank

[2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:25.320]  quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety this is nothing less than
[2:45:25.320 --> 2:45:30.600]  martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality faraday cages many

[2:47:25.880 --> 2:47:30.520]  he agrees with me gets misrepresented by the corporate media which we expect that's why
[2:47:30.520 --> 2:47:35.720]  it's important to know the actual broadcast but they're like oh jones is scared of the january
[2:47:35.720 --> 2:47:45.400]  sixth committee that's why he's threatening to dish dirt on trump the dirt is on how trump
[2:47:45.400 --> 2:47:52.520]  doesn't know what he's doing i said that yesterday i said the dirt that's what endeared me to trump
[2:47:52.520 --> 2:47:58.760]  is that he didn't know what he was doing he was actually not under their control that didn't mean
[2:47:58.760 --> 2:48:04.440]  he was perfect didn't mean he had all the policy answers but he was actually trying to be the president
[2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:14.920]  that's what i said not if trump doesn't do what i want i'm going to expose his dirt i don't know
[2:48:14.920 --> 2:48:23.480]  any dirt on trump i said the dirt is he's not playing 40 chess he doesn't know what he's doing
[2:48:24.280 --> 2:48:30.680]  that's the dirt i said the dirt and i can tell plenty of stories and the rest of it because i
[2:48:30.680 --> 2:48:35.640]  i don't want to hurt trump i don't want our listeners holding him up like he's the messiah
[2:48:35.640 --> 2:48:40.280]  and then he's going to fix all our problems that's why i did it and i explained that yesterday
[2:48:40.280 --> 2:48:48.520]  but there are hundreds of articles bbc new york times london independent la times media item
[2:48:49.800 --> 2:48:59.000]  crooks and liars daily beast i mean it's just everywhere jones holds trump hostage you know
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:03.720]  like it's over what's he got he's about to admit trump gave the orders to attack the capital
[2:49:03.720 --> 2:49:12.280]  well no that's not yeah there is on drudge you know what i gotta sit in a room and write notes
[2:49:12.280 --> 2:49:18.920]  but i'm gonna dish all the dirt today after the show i'm gonna go tape and then in the last hour
[2:49:18.920 --> 2:49:25.000]  of owens shroyer today the last two segments i'll dish the dirt on trump and the truth is
[2:49:27.400 --> 2:49:30.680]  i'll tell you what the truth is i'll tell you that i'll tell you that i mean i gotta think about it
[2:49:30.680 --> 2:49:35.160]  because gosh there's a lot i mean the more i think about it the more there is i mean
[2:49:36.120 --> 2:49:40.600]  which make it's like paradoxical it makes him good that he's such a buffoon
[2:49:42.600 --> 2:49:49.720]  and and and then everybody's like oh my god the 5d the 50d chess oh my lord this is no i mean he's
[2:49:49.720 --> 2:49:55.640]  like why china got a better deal than us the truth is he could turn a piece of coal in his rear end
[2:49:55.640 --> 2:50:03.720]  into a diamond and it's good to have somebody like that working for you and there's no evidence
[2:50:03.720 --> 2:50:08.440]  he was ever with epstein with kids or any of that there they were socialized they got photographed
[2:50:08.440 --> 2:50:14.200]  a lot i'm not my job's not to defend trump i don't get a paycheck for defending trump i get lawsuits
[2:50:14.200 --> 2:50:21.000]  i get the platform i get attacked for supporting trump that was my last straw with a morning talk
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:25.960]  show host we had who i was glad was attacking trump and who i was listening to and who i agreed with
[2:50:26.680 --> 2:50:31.800]  and then they were like acting like well jones must be on the payroll so he's with trump that's
[2:50:31.800 --> 2:50:36.920]  why you want to attack him no i was hoping to salvage trump and try to get him to do good
[2:50:39.080 --> 2:50:43.160]  it wasn't because i mean all i've gotten is hell for supporting trump
[2:50:43.160 --> 2:50:52.280]  so i'm like oh i'm censoring you when i never did screw you i will put up with lies but it

[2:52:40.520 --> 2:52:45.160]  a different direction and minister to you and your wife and one of the things i wanted to
[2:52:45.160 --> 2:52:50.440]  communicate is regarding addiction and and not just to you and her y'all are one person but to
[2:52:50.440 --> 2:52:56.760]  everybody we live in a messed up society where from the time we were children if you think about
[2:52:56.760 --> 2:53:02.360]  liminal rites of passages plain anthropology uh with the elysian mysteries you know with the
[2:53:02.360 --> 2:53:08.440]  worship of dine isis and the rite of wine there's a reason why we call it spirits right i um
[2:53:09.400 --> 2:53:15.480]  we are told don't do drugs just say no to drugs and then we are told we're young adults when we
[2:53:15.480 --> 2:53:21.800]  can buy a pack of cigarettes and grown adults when we can drink a beer and until we come to accept
[2:53:21.800 --> 2:53:27.640]  that that type of mind control for the purpose of gain thing is prevalent in our society and break
[2:53:27.640 --> 2:53:35.720]  ourselves from that that liminal rite of passage that we have been enticed into you i totally agree
[2:53:35.720 --> 2:53:43.080]  they sell it like a rite of passage yes that's exactly what it is i uh and what i would say is
[2:53:43.080 --> 2:53:47.960]  you know we support your wife wholeheartedly you've given her your last name as christ gave the church
[2:53:48.600 --> 2:53:53.240]  you know you you put a ring on her finger symbolizing the union between a man and a woman a
[2:53:53.240 --> 2:53:58.200]  finger piercing a ring i'm not going to draw a diagram of the birds of bees but you know it's
[2:53:58.200 --> 2:54:07.720]  pretty out there i uh but christ when he came to this earth he ministered to the sheep and he
[2:54:07.720 --> 2:54:13.800]  his cloak would his cloak would get touched and the spirit would go out of him and once that spirit
[2:54:13.800 --> 2:54:17.960]  keeps going out and going out and going out and going out as your ministering to the sheep every
[2:54:17.960 --> 2:54:23.240]  once in a while you do have to go into the wilderness and be fed if you're not getting it from the sheep
[2:54:24.520 --> 2:54:30.280]  and i just want to tell you today brother my brother in christ alex i love you i support
[2:54:30.280 --> 2:54:35.880]  you and your wife and your struggle what your children are going through and good god man

[3:03:07.400 --> 3:03:12.600]  certain people and maybe this should be a warning to the bezosis of the world that they might burn
[3:03:12.600 --> 3:03:19.000]  you too so let's not go into this whole transhumanist authoritarian nightmare start fighting back
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:23.720]  you know they exactly but the point is jason only thing we've ever taken together is the presence

[3:03:27.560 --> 3:03:33.640]  lot of alcohol with you i don't take stimulants other than coffee i mean i'm just sick of people
[3:03:33.640 --> 3:03:40.040]  claiming i'm excited from stimulants i'm excited for freedom yeah and the coffee there was great
[3:03:40.040 --> 3:03:44.920]  you always used to have those ground beans over in the office the fresh ones so that's good stuff
[3:03:44.920 --> 3:03:49.800]  yeah i've only had two cups of coffee you actually gotta go get one hey i know you're an expert on
[3:03:49.800 --> 3:03:55.720]  i mean back with me you weren't you were making films about child kidnapping rings a decade ago
[3:03:55.720 --> 3:03:59.880]  this is all come out i want to get your take because it's paradox i'm like yeah it's a victory she
[3:03:59.880 --> 3:04:05.000]  got convicted but it's a defeat that they sealed it all people are like well give us you're being
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:10.280]  too faced like is it a victory or not i'm like it's both i'm gonna get jason bermas's view of
[3:04:10.280 --> 3:04:15.960]  course he's a loose change filmmaker and so much more he produced several documentaries with us as
[3:04:15.960 --> 3:04:21.000]  well like fabled enemies and so much more we'll be right back with jason bermas i'll just call us
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:25.720]  with him this hour and then and then we'll take your phone calls pretty quick too i'll get out of
[3:04:25.720 --> 3:04:30.840]  here but i am gonna dish the dirt on trump not because of january 6 in fact it probably
[3:04:30.840 --> 3:04:37.240]  endangers me with the committee to dish to dish dirt on trump i'm dishing dirt on trump because
[3:04:37.240 --> 3:04:42.840]  i'm sick of him and the freaking vaccines that aren't vaccines that's why with me it's always
[3:04:42.840 --> 3:04:48.360]  straight up no cake no cocaine needed okay i'm pissed off because they're killing kids i don't
[3:04:48.360 --> 3:05:01.080]  need cocaine to get upset i've been fighting as hard as i can for almost 28 years against the
[3:05:01.080 --> 3:05:06.920]  globalist i wanted to stop their agenda i wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their
[3:05:06.920 --> 3:05:12.760]  tracks before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting
[3:05:12.760 --> 3:05:18.840]  caught flat footed but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[3:05:18.840 --> 3:05:23.720]  great restart and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[3:05:23.720 --> 3:05:28.040]  tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the
[3:05:28.040 --> 3:05:32.280]  truth so we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda and we've
[3:05:32.280 --> 3:05:36.040]  also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is high quality
[3:05:36.040 --> 3:05:41.560]  storable food we've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com
[3:05:41.560 --> 3:05:46.680]  so whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets it's ready to ship right
[3:05:46.680 --> 3:05:52.040]  now lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits
[3:05:52.040 --> 3:06:15.880]  because believe me serious times are coming get ready at infowarstore.com
[3:06:23.000 --> 3:06:28.360]  All right Jason Burmes is right in the shot done with us in this hour I'm Alan Jones your host
[3:06:28.360 --> 3:06:33.000]  George Christopher and Dan we will get to your calls coming up next segment I really appreciate
[3:06:33.000 --> 3:06:38.200]  you holding from California Maryland and Ohio but Jason Burmes is a major filmmaker with loose
[3:06:38.200 --> 3:06:43.480]  change and fabled enemies and shade and a bunch of other you know some of the top films out there
[3:06:44.120 --> 3:06:49.880]  and I've known him for over 15 years we've produced films together and so much more and you know I
[3:06:49.880 --> 3:06:57.240]  forget how much you have covered Gisling Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein for over a decade so I asked
[3:06:57.240 --> 3:07:02.120]  you the question because I want to declare victory sometimes as well is it a victory that hey they
[3:07:02.120 --> 3:07:08.840]  admit child trafficking child kidnapping all this but they sealed the black book of who the Johns
[3:07:08.840 --> 3:07:13.640]  are protecting the actual network is it a victory is it a defeat I mean obviously it's both the same
[3:07:13.640 --> 3:07:21.400]  time but is it 20% victory 80% defeat 50% victory 50% defeat I mean what do you think about this
[3:07:21.400 --> 3:07:30.680]  situation I think when we talk about maybe legally it's probably like a 5 to 10% victory in the court
[3:07:30.680 --> 3:07:36.600]  of public opinion and the arena of opening people's minds I think it's bigger than that I think it's
[3:07:36.600 --> 3:07:44.600]  probably about a 50% victory right because without people like yourself and myself amplifying these
[3:07:44.600 --> 3:07:51.480]  stories that again we're out there pre 2010 right exactly it's a victory that we at least forced this
[3:07:53.160 --> 3:08:02.120]  absolute look we forced the arrest we we forced good people within the NYPD system to go after
[3:08:02.120 --> 3:08:07.000]  Epstein and try to be legitimate about it and what happened okay let's talk about the first
[3:08:07.000 --> 3:08:11.800]  suicide attempt because we also have to get past imagination land you know we have those people
[3:08:11.800 --> 3:08:17.560]  that think oh glane Maxwell wasn't even on trial she was in that courtroom all right I know journalists
[3:08:17.560 --> 3:08:22.680]  that were there we have to be in reality it's just like they did not extract Epstein they were going
[3:08:22.680 --> 3:08:30.120]  to extract Epstein you would not have the first incident which involved who his cellmate Nicholas
[3:08:30.120 --> 3:08:36.200]  Tartiglione which they they totally whitewash remember they cleared the guy and then they said
[3:08:36.200 --> 3:08:39.720]  they didn't have the video and then months later they did have the video and then they didn't have
[3:08:39.720 --> 3:08:46.440]  the video again when Epstein had self had told his lawyer that he was attacked by that gentleman
[3:08:46.440 --> 3:08:53.000]  okay and then I mean that's a guy who's an ex dirty cop accused of quadruple murder in a bad
[3:08:53.000 --> 3:08:58.200]  coke deal you want to talk about cocaine folks okay and then the second time you know you have
[3:08:58.200 --> 3:09:04.520]  Michael Baden coming in and saying there were three fractures in his neck and you usually don't have
[3:09:04.520 --> 3:09:12.440]  one fracture okay and again there is no video the guards on duty were either asleep or not
[3:09:12.440 --> 3:09:19.320]  checking on them and then they were prosecuted and then you have over I believe it was 39,000
[3:09:19.320 --> 3:09:27.480]  images and videos that were extracted openly okay from the scene of the New York mansion right
[3:09:27.480 --> 3:09:33.720]  we all know this and we got to see about 40 of them Alex and not only did we get to see 40 of them
[3:09:33.720 --> 3:09:39.960]  here that here they are in the background they have any pictures of significance blacked out you
[3:09:39.960 --> 3:09:46.680]  say one black book well my friend it's much more than one black book here's some of the cd I grabbed
[3:09:46.680 --> 3:09:53.000]  all that that whole safe and that just disappeared and then this horrible judge Daniel or wherever
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:10:00.280]  the hell his name is is covering all this up well you're looking right behind me at a slew of binders
[3:10:00.280 --> 3:10:06.760]  that are black binders forget about one black book Alex and these just have information on the outside
[3:10:06.760 --> 3:10:11.960]  that is again blacked out in my life Jason you're right to correct I was reading the headline of
[3:10:11.960 --> 3:10:17.160]  judge blacks out black book that's their lie you're right it's literally dozens of computers
[3:10:17.160 --> 3:10:24.600]  a whole bunch of safes I'm in a smorgasbord what what is on this stuff as best we can tell well
[3:10:24.600 --> 3:10:30.120]  we have to look to the fact that number one they said what we don't want to politicize this we
[3:10:30.120 --> 3:10:34.760]  don't want to make it into a circus but you know and I'm no big defender of Trump I mean one of
[3:10:34.760 --> 3:10:40.040]  his biggest failures was having Dershowitz who they had on Fox News last night not just the BBC
[3:10:40.600 --> 3:10:45.880]  talking about this as his lawyer in that impeachment trial okay but there were never any
[3:10:45.880 --> 3:10:51.160]  logs of Trump with Epstein now people like myself had talked about how it was obvious that they knew
[3:10:51.160 --> 3:10:56.360]  each other and that Epstein had run on that plane but they made sure that of the new logs that did
[3:10:56.360 --> 3:11:03.080]  come out they had Trump on them again trying to further smear the guy you know I have to at least
[3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:09.240]  give him that credit meanwhile all the stuff with Bill Clinton was already in the arena I'll say this
[3:11:09.240 --> 3:11:15.400]  you have glane Maxwell coming up with another trial on perjury there's two counts there whether
[3:11:15.400 --> 3:11:21.640]  or not she gets convicted is almost a moot point now whether she gets you know 20 years or the 65
[3:11:21.640 --> 3:11:28.040]  max that is a big deal because let's say she gets 15 or 20 you know she could get commuted
[3:11:28.040 --> 3:11:32.760]  in five or six you know I wouldn't say it's a cosby situation where they just kind of release
[3:11:32.760 --> 3:11:38.440]  them on a technicality but right now you have Jean-Luc Brinnell in a separate trial and you
[3:11:38.440 --> 3:11:43.240]  have Peter Nygaard which you covered which was a huge coverage and I commend you on that as well
[3:11:43.240 --> 3:11:48.040]  because we can talk about all the evidence we now see that they've covered up they never even
[3:11:48.040 --> 3:11:56.040]  investigated Zorro Ranch which was the notorious what baby making ranch there and although and
[3:11:56.040 --> 3:12:01.640]  research what's going on with these babies they claim clones they claim body parts we know Nygaard
[3:12:01.640 --> 3:12:05.640]  was draining the blood out of the babies what the hell was going on at Zorro Ranch from your research
[3:12:05.640 --> 3:12:14.040]  so let's let's take a look at it folks it's in the desert okay and it is extremely criminal
[3:12:14.600 --> 3:12:18.520]  that you would not get to the middle of a national and state park line where nobody's at
[3:12:20.280 --> 3:12:25.800]  exactly Alex and we know first of all let's let's look at the New York mansion right we know
[3:12:25.800 --> 3:12:31.880]  that Epstein through Maria Farmers testimony not only had a room where he was taping all these
[3:12:31.880 --> 3:12:38.840]  uh other rooms in the house and individuals but it was manned he had people there 24-7 working
[3:12:39.400 --> 3:12:44.520]  that office if you will were they private contractors massage MI6 CIA what do we know
[3:12:45.560 --> 3:12:50.280]  we don't know exactly that that's a great question we do know that mansion was given to him by Les
[3:12:50.280 --> 3:12:56.520]  Wexner who among that group in the fashion industry and otherwise was closest to Epstein and has
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:13:03.240]  already been exonerated in the media and also represented by Dershowitz he and Dershowitz went
[3:13:03.240 --> 3:13:09.720]  and gave testimony together in a separate case which was the civil case with Virginia Frey Roberts
[3:13:09.720 --> 3:13:13.880]  just in November it was extremely short as they've denied everything but they've already been
[3:13:13.880 --> 3:13:20.680]  exonerated he's the one that gave Epstein the mansion for a dollar Alex and to get into the
[3:13:20.680 --> 3:13:27.160]  island we know there were underground facilities at the island to think that they didn't have
[3:13:27.160 --> 3:13:33.880]  underground facilities here in this vast region that has never been investigated with people like
[3:13:33.880 --> 3:13:40.680]  Bill Richardson who were the governor of New Mexico at the time being named as Epstein associates
[3:13:40.680 --> 3:13:46.520]  and again victimizing these young children okay never investigated whatsoever you have to wonder
[3:13:46.520 --> 3:13:51.000]  what was going on there you know when bill absolutely so bottom line you do study bohemian
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:56.520]  groves skull and bones all of it bottom line who are these people are they psychic vampires what
[3:13:56.520 --> 3:14:03.880]  would you call them I call them predator class because at the very base of it you have to be
[3:14:03.880 --> 3:14:11.640]  extremely sociopathic to do the types of things these people do on a regular basis and then look
[3:14:11.640 --> 3:14:19.160]  us in the eye and tell us otherwise in order to invert reality and I really think that these people
[3:14:19.160 --> 3:14:26.280]  go the way of social Darwinism they do believe that they can become their own gods it really is that
[3:14:26.280 --> 3:14:34.040]  Crowley-esque mantra of do as thou wilt what makes you feel good what empowers you and that's why
[3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:40.680]  that clip of Peter Nygaard sitting there talking about how he wants to live forever or die trying
[3:14:40.680 --> 3:14:47.720]  is so powerful because that's not science fiction anymore Kurzweil himself the big transhumanist
[3:14:47.720 --> 3:14:54.520]  that you and I have discussed many times he's been the head of the immortality division Calico
[3:14:55.080 --> 3:15:00.920]  of Google for over a decade and people do not talk about these things and he's been right on a
[3:15:00.920 --> 3:15:07.480]  lot of technology but the bottom line is they want to enslave you with this technology they
[3:15:07.480 --> 3:15:12.760]  don't want to empower you it's just like with their social credit score right or their stakeholder
[3:15:12.760 --> 3:15:20.120]  capitalism they will never be beholden to their own rules you will own nothing and they will own
[3:15:20.120 --> 3:15:25.560]  it all as a predator class over their serfs and slaves if they have their way and this was just
[3:15:25.560 --> 3:15:31.080]  one of their minions they burn man so again Bezos they could burn you too I just want to let you
[3:15:31.080 --> 3:15:35.480]  know hi Jason Mermas I want to get these three colors out of the way and have you take over
[3:15:35.480 --> 3:15:39.320]  you'll hit it all the bottom of the hour stay with us George Christopher Dan we're going right to you

[3:15:55.960 --> 3:16:02.040]  cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left it can be very stressful dealing with
[3:16:02.040 --> 3:16:07.800]  facts you refuse to accept if you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental
[3:16:07.800 --> 3:16:14.280]  condition buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store dot com studies have suggested
[3:16:14.280 --> 3:16:20.680]  that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure decrease triglyceride
[3:16:20.680 --> 3:16:26.360]  levels decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory

[3:20:01.160 --> 3:20:03.480]  order it's alex jones
[3:20:09.960 --> 3:20:15.160]  his and barmas is about to take over we're taking a few calls from george and christopher and dan
[3:20:15.160 --> 3:20:21.880]  before he does it and i wanted to just add this point we have a lot of legalists whether it be in
[3:20:21.880 --> 3:20:25.960]  politics or legal areas or spiritual areas that say well it's either this or that no it's both
[3:20:26.680 --> 3:20:31.640]  or it's 10 things it's 100 things it depends on what percentage it is you can try to recruit
[3:20:31.640 --> 3:20:36.840]  your own number but it's all dead reckoning it's a victory because lane maxwell has been found
[3:20:36.840 --> 3:20:43.320]  guilty and it proves they're running child's ranks but it made the feds then cover up the black book
[3:20:43.320 --> 3:20:47.720]  cover up all the hard drives cover up all the computers cover up the saves you're like oh my
[3:20:47.720 --> 3:20:53.880]  god that shows they're corrupt we forced them out of the open they're not liking what's happening so
[3:20:54.600 --> 3:20:59.320]  i asked the question at the start of the show is it a victory is it a defeat it's 50 50 if you
[3:20:59.320 --> 3:21:05.080]  just look at it like okay they went to prison or one's dead but they covered up but we forced them
[3:21:05.080 --> 3:21:11.000]  to cover it up and for everybody so i'd say it's a 75 victory 25 victory for them i mean i think
[3:21:11.000 --> 3:21:19.640]  justice the scales of justice are sliding against them right now jason i mean again it's really tough
[3:21:19.640 --> 3:21:26.600]  right because you look at this generational corruption right the fact that you have a guy like
[3:21:26.600 --> 3:21:32.920]  ebbstein in a prison where they held el chapo who would escape from other prisons but obviously
[3:21:32.920 --> 3:21:39.960]  wasn't getting out of that one and a prison where they hadn't had a suicide in 13 years and they allow
[3:21:39.960 --> 3:21:46.200]  that to happen not to mention that it was reported that bill bar was there before the first suicide
[3:21:46.200 --> 3:21:52.760]  attempt and then reported after the fact that he was in the prison after that talking to nicholas
[3:21:52.760 --> 3:21:59.080]  tartiglione himself you know the cellmate but again when you have that level of deep state
[3:21:59.080 --> 3:22:05.240]  corruption that is real that is not a right-wing term or a trump term something that was chronicled
[3:22:05.240 --> 3:22:12.760]  by peter dale scott and you got a guy like bill bar who came up with the cia right now and running
[3:22:12.760 --> 3:22:19.240]  the school with ebbstein well you have the dalton school connection but he comes up and what is
[3:22:19.240 --> 3:22:25.640]  his job in the justice department as if he comes a lawyer while all of a sudden he's doing the bcci
[3:22:25.640 --> 3:22:31.720]  scandal the banks of criminals cartels international that's involved with the iran contra network
[3:22:31.720 --> 3:22:38.360]  and the bin laden network and then he becomes one of the youngest attorney generals ever under
[3:22:38.360 --> 3:22:45.800]  mr cia george herbert walker bush in fact uh he is named as one of the fixers over in minna
[3:22:45.800 --> 3:22:53.640]  arkansas a man named robert johnson by one of those guys that was cargoing those drugs on c130s
[3:22:53.640 --> 3:22:59.320]  so you know bill bar why the hell did trump put him in there and that's the biggest problem with
[3:22:59.320 --> 3:23:05.880]  that administration right james mattis john bolton um these guys were never our friends and i think a
[3:23:05.880 --> 3:23:12.680]  lot of that had to do with naivety and you know i remember alex at the time when he failed on syria
[3:23:12.680 --> 3:23:16.840]  when he knew it was time to get out of syria and he said look we're going to get out and then within
[3:23:16.840 --> 3:23:23.640]  a week of that you had that false flag attack i can't even call an attack in duma right and then he
[3:23:23.640 --> 3:23:30.920]  back down even though mattis in hearings less than 48 hours later said they didn't even have evidence
[3:23:30.920 --> 3:23:37.480]  that let alone a chemical attack had occurred a attack had occurred and props to pierce and sharp
[3:23:37.480 --> 3:23:43.560]  he went over there for oan i remember watching it live he's interviewing the people on the ground
[3:23:43.560 --> 3:23:49.400]  and there was obviously no attack there so he should discover that more coming up let's get to a few
[3:23:49.400 --> 3:23:56.680]  these calls you're going to take over george in california welcome thanks for holding yes hi alex
[3:23:56.680 --> 3:24:03.000]  good afternoon sir welcome hi there i have just like three points and i'll also answer your question
[3:24:03.000 --> 3:24:06.760]  that you had but one point i wanted to bring up with you and i thought mike adams was going to be
[3:24:06.760 --> 3:24:15.080]  there uh sorry about that no um jason no uh yeah one of the things is you guys um quite often talk
[3:24:15.080 --> 3:24:21.560]  about false flags and the possibility of like uh you know they'll stage like a shooting at a vaccination
[3:24:21.560 --> 3:24:27.960]  place whatever my i think my my point is or what i'm calling them about is i think it already started
[3:24:28.920 --> 3:24:36.040]  with the rollout of the vaccine given the fact that if you include what laura lumar last said
[3:24:36.040 --> 3:24:41.720]  there when she was there she said like in certain even red states like florida they've enact law
[3:24:41.720 --> 3:24:47.800]  that if the county health commissioner and i don't know exactly the uh the title if they were to
[3:24:47.800 --> 3:24:54.200]  declare an emergency it doesn't matter we would be mandated to have vaccines and take away our guns
[3:24:54.200 --> 3:25:02.840]  which coincides with what passed in june labeling unvaccinated as terrorism or terrorist therefore
[3:25:02.840 --> 3:25:07.000]  they're not allowed to have guns that's one point i want to know that's right here in this document
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:12.200]  put out in actually june where they declare people that question lockdowns and the vacs as
[3:25:12.200 --> 3:25:16.680]  terrorists that's in the national strategy for countering domestic terrorism put up by the
[3:25:16.680 --> 3:25:22.280]  public president you know so yeah i wanted to get like your take and maybe even other callers in
[3:25:22.280 --> 3:25:28.680]  the future to kind of brainstorm what can we do to already prepare or i don't know warn others that
[3:25:28.680 --> 3:25:33.400]  hey it already it's gonna happen i see people that i absolutely you can see all the prescripting
[3:25:33.400 --> 3:25:40.200]  george is that your question you want to elaborate on that uh well yeah just like uh what can we do
[3:25:40.200 --> 3:25:45.400]  to like prevent that from happening from that from that moment jason bermus how do we stop
[3:25:45.400 --> 3:25:50.760]  obviously there's pre-programming for a false flag to attack anti-vaxxers are people that question
[3:25:50.760 --> 3:25:57.880]  this tmo shot uh you've you've made films about false flags jason yeah i think that you have to
[3:25:57.880 --> 3:26:03.480]  put your local representatives on blast you have to you actually have to go in there and i've been
[3:26:03.480 --> 3:26:07.720]  doing this when i moved to iowa you know i had to get out of new york state new york state i knew
[3:26:07.720 --> 3:26:11.160]  i was not going to be able to fight trying to get my brother and his family out of there now
[3:26:11.160 --> 3:26:18.440]  but the way to do it is to ask the legitimate questions film it and put it on the internet
[3:26:18.440 --> 3:26:23.400]  okay and put it on band dot video put it on youtube put it everywhere and that's why this signal is
[3:26:23.400 --> 3:26:28.360]  so important and your signal is so important because it is a network of us trying to hold
[3:26:28.360 --> 3:26:34.280]  these people accountable we don't have a media or a fourth estate who holds our officials accountable
[3:26:34.280 --> 3:26:39.960]  we no longer have checks and balances on the federal level and many times the state level
[3:26:39.960 --> 3:26:45.400]  you have to be that check and balance so that's where you start you say why is this legislation
[3:26:45.960 --> 3:26:50.920]  even here this needs to be taken away immediately and we're not only going to vote you out we're
[3:26:50.920 --> 3:26:58.520]  going to put you on blast daily for what voting this in that's right great point all right thank you
[3:26:58.520 --> 3:27:05.000]  george christopher first time caller from maryland you're on the air welcome christopher thank you
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:14.520]  alex long time listener almost 28 years now wow like not every day not all the time but you hit

[3:27:21.880 --> 3:27:30.200]  vaccines the whatever but i think a lot of people don't understand the origins silent weapons or quiet
[3:27:30.200 --> 3:27:43.240]  wars and re chrinal alexander they must understand this technology that they're implementing against
[3:27:43.240 --> 3:27:49.400]  us it says that it's it is bio warfare well tell folks about it
[3:27:52.120 --> 3:28:01.720]  binary re silent weapons for quiet wars it's a binary system where they inject you
[3:28:03.400 --> 3:28:08.920]  and then keep giving you injections and it what was your immune system
[3:28:08.920 --> 3:28:20.280]  um it's in the rockefeller foundation document what's that it's so frustrating don't hang up christ
[3:28:20.280 --> 3:28:24.040]  for one of you to get a final comment and we're going to talk to dan and then jason bermas is

[3:35:21.960 --> 3:35:30.760]  weird theologian stuff hey great everything's wonderful whatever dude i as a just a person
[3:35:30.760 --> 3:35:35.880]  i'm against a world id and the control that comes with that let's just get out of the
[3:35:35.880 --> 3:35:41.000]  religious debate about it i'm against the new world order i'm fighting it i'm not your enemy
[3:35:41.000 --> 3:35:47.560]  jason bermas we love you take over the last 25 minutes thank you so much thank you alex and you
[3:35:47.560 --> 3:35:55.080]  know let's go back to the last caller and talking about this idea of not only transhumanism but
[3:35:55.080 --> 3:36:02.360]  really affecting your mind forget about silent uh or i'm sorry it's silent weapons for quiet wars
[3:36:02.360 --> 3:36:08.840]  look at this rand document this is anybody can go check this out the security 2040 and this involves
[3:36:09.400 --> 3:36:19.240]  what the fda the national institute of health darpa irpa all working together with industries
[3:36:19.240 --> 3:36:30.040]  what institutions the ngo's and the universities as well to bring in a very real invasive and
[3:36:30.040 --> 3:36:36.120]  non-invasive transhumanist agenda it's all in this document in fact that paragraph let's go
[3:36:36.120 --> 3:36:41.720]  to the fda section right here uh it and it tells you all these people are not only working together
[3:36:41.720 --> 3:36:48.680]  they're heavily funded um for instance the nih there had already allocated between 2014 and
[3:36:48.680 --> 3:36:57.960]  2015 okay well over 125 million dollars that's public all right think about what they've been
[3:36:57.960 --> 3:37:05.160]  doing the last six years this is for the global populace it's not just the united states right
[3:37:05.160 --> 3:37:12.040]  darpa has invested hundreds of millions of dollars on records since the early 2000s that doesn't
[3:37:12.040 --> 3:37:20.040]  even include their black budget and that's why the focus on transhumanism at least right now
[3:37:20.040 --> 3:37:25.960]  should be a priority because as alex has said these quote unquote vaccines are really
[3:37:26.520 --> 3:37:34.920]  gene therapy but they're not just gene therapy okay mrna sure there's a lot of different things
[3:37:34.920 --> 3:37:41.400]  that you can do with it all right and i want to show you the strategic collaborators on mrna
[3:37:41.400 --> 3:37:48.760]  according to moderna's own website who are they darpa that's the defense department folks how honest
[3:37:49.560 --> 3:37:55.000]  has the defense department been not only with the american people but the global populace
[3:37:55.960 --> 3:38:04.440]  really think about that do they have any vested interest in telling the truth to the public
[3:38:04.440 --> 3:38:11.880]  when they are constantly dealing with what classified issues classified technologies and
[3:38:11.880 --> 3:38:18.040]  beyond things that are literally born classified and so compartmentalized very few people get to
[3:38:18.040 --> 3:38:22.600]  see that big picture do they tell you the truth about weapons of mass destruction i mean you
[3:38:22.600 --> 3:38:28.680]  could go to just the isis k debacle which they got caught on where they killed women and children
[3:38:28.680 --> 3:38:34.520]  you trust them then you trust bill and melinda gates and their foundation or murk or astrazeneca or
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:40.280]  moderna itself and then you realize that they partnered with darpa and this was up on their
[3:38:40.280 --> 3:38:47.000]  own website up until about a month ago but that's okay and the funny thing is that yeah they are
[3:38:47.000 --> 3:38:51.640]  therapeutics here right they don't even dare call them vaccines because you actually had to change
[3:38:51.640 --> 3:38:59.720]  the definition in this coveted 1984 nightmare to include these type of quote unquote therapeutics
[3:38:59.720 --> 3:39:06.280]  or drugs into vaccines just like they did with the vector based technology okay and what's funny
[3:39:06.280 --> 3:39:12.280]  is not only did they they partner with them on pandemics right that's the headline here
[3:39:12.280 --> 3:39:18.520]  it was pandemics but if you look at their own page it wasn't just pandemics it was actually
[3:39:18.520 --> 3:39:27.400]  infectious diseases and engineered biological weapons you mean like a virus that has i don't know
[3:39:28.040 --> 3:39:34.040]  certain protein fragments of hiv in it and you have people like luke monnier coming out and saying
[3:39:34.040 --> 3:39:39.240]  that this was obviously engineered in a lab and you've never found an animal reservoir
[3:39:41.080 --> 3:39:48.360]  hmm weird weird you're injecting that into us and then on top of it you're gonna sell us a program
[3:39:48.360 --> 3:39:56.120]  called operation warp speed where you can further classify its distribution investors great idea
[3:39:56.840 --> 3:40:02.360]  great idea and that is a huge failure of the trump administration and i think those people
[3:40:02.360 --> 3:40:08.600]  that are still wrapped up in the idea that you're gonna vote your way out of this and that somehow
[3:40:08.600 --> 3:40:13.560]  this red wave i keep seeing it on on the right wing networks the red waves coming the red waves
[3:40:13.560 --> 3:40:20.440]  coming we're gonna stop these socialist democrats this is about authoritarianism all right don't
[3:40:20.440 --> 3:40:25.720]  get me wrong there are socialist aspects of it because they got to promise you something right
[3:40:25.720 --> 3:40:30.600]  this has always been my you know big problem with you know progressives and their dreams of
[3:40:30.600 --> 3:40:37.080]  medicare for all what medicare you mean the one where they refuse you ivermectin you mean the
[3:40:37.080 --> 3:40:42.280]  one where they cut off model colonial antibodies you mean the one where they don't even want you
[3:40:42.280 --> 3:40:50.360]  to know about budesonite and i will give props right now to the florida surgeon general because
[3:40:50.360 --> 3:40:55.080]  he's come out and said that the uh biden administration and i called the zombie j
[3:40:55.080 --> 3:41:00.520]  administration right because biden's not really running it kamala harris isn't running anything
[3:41:00.520 --> 3:41:07.320]  i mean she's an embarrassment and said look they're costing people up people's lives by not
[3:41:07.320 --> 3:41:12.360]  getting the uh colonial any model colonial antibodies but then on tv last night he also mentioned that
[3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:21.000]  you had all these other cheap therapies like inhaled budesonide for over a year how many people
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:27.960]  know about that in the public arena i mean makes sense a steroid that gets into your lungs and
[3:41:27.960 --> 3:41:34.600]  remember early reports even out of china okay even out of china when i was covering this
[3:41:34.600 --> 3:41:41.720]  this in february and march before any lockdowns in this country said what they were successfully
[3:41:41.720 --> 3:41:50.360]  treating people early with steroid treatments and vitamin infusions cnd all you got censored for that
[3:41:51.160 --> 3:41:55.560]  right the united nations didn't want you to know about the world health organization
[3:41:56.520 --> 3:42:03.880]  literally an establishment that is just like filled with pedophilia filled i mean the last
[3:42:03.880 --> 3:42:10.120]  scandal again the obola in the congo scandal where now again we have to take advice from these
[3:42:10.120 --> 3:42:15.880]  authoritative sources that censor us that are involved in child rape it's unbelievable but
[3:42:15.880 --> 3:42:20.200]  it's generational let's bring it back to the epstein case just in this last little segment
[3:42:20.200 --> 3:42:25.560]  for a second all right what do you know about lord mount benn well i'll tell you something
[3:42:25.560 --> 3:42:32.600]  about lord mount benn he was a nato commander he's a part of the royal family he's charles's
[3:42:32.600 --> 3:42:40.040]  favorite uncle and andrew's uncle oh he's also somebody that the fbi knew about before he had
[3:42:40.040 --> 3:42:46.840]  some of those positions who had a lust and perversion for young boys this is generationally
[3:42:46.840 --> 3:42:51.880]  psychopathic and predatory and if you think these people have your best interest at heart you better

[3:44:16.680 --> 3:44:24.280]  famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda

[3:47:03.160 --> 3:47:20.760]  we are back i am jason berman sitting in for i believe the final segment of the final hour of
[3:47:20.760 --> 3:47:27.160]  the alex jones show and let me reach out to the audience before we finish up here and talk about
[3:47:27.160 --> 3:47:34.360]  this max well verdict the larger picture with epstein and a network that really goes well
[3:47:34.360 --> 3:47:41.720]  beyond epstein right it goes into the iran contra network it goes into the same network
[3:47:41.720 --> 3:47:50.280]  that carried out and covered up 9 11 that is a reality but how would the public know those
[3:47:50.280 --> 3:47:57.880]  things if it weren't for info wars dot com and alex jones look alex and i have had our differences
[3:47:57.880 --> 3:48:05.560]  we've known each other for many many years but i still remember okay all the way back in the day
[3:48:05.560 --> 3:48:13.160]  before i made loose change with dylan avery and cori roe finding out that i was lied to
[3:48:13.160 --> 3:48:20.040]  about 9 11 and trying to find as much information as possible and i came across a download of a real
[3:48:20.040 --> 3:48:26.760]  media file that was out of sync it was over two hours long it was 9 11 the road to tyranny
[3:48:27.320 --> 3:48:35.640]  and it was this low production gruff southerner in what appeared to be like a i don't know access tv
[3:48:35.640 --> 3:48:43.720]  studio a alex saying things that i thought were over the top then and sometimes presenting evidence
[3:48:43.720 --> 3:48:50.120]  that was eye-opening to me but at the same time i left i go i want to prove this guy wrong and
[3:48:50.120 --> 3:48:55.960]  unfortunately as i was looking more and more into these things although maybe he articulated it
[3:48:55.960 --> 3:49:02.600]  in a different manner i soon came to find that he was indeed correct about the vast majority
[3:49:02.600 --> 3:49:09.080]  of what was presented in that film and that led me into so many other avenues and directions
[3:49:10.040 --> 3:49:17.400]  and not only did i focus on 9 11 with loose change final cut and fabled enemies but i expanded
[3:49:17.400 --> 3:49:24.200]  into invisible empire a new world order defined with info wars dot com really my my swan song
[3:49:24.200 --> 3:49:31.400]  go take a look at that picture right now free and it lays so much of what has already happened out
[3:49:31.400 --> 3:49:35.880]  well over a decade ago and we reached a lot of people with that film and then shade the
[3:49:35.880 --> 3:49:42.520]  motion picture and he reached a lot of people with the obama deception okay and these were important
[3:49:42.520 --> 3:49:51.160]  to the zeitgeist around us that began questioning narratives and now despite the gas lighting on
[3:49:51.880 --> 3:50:00.520]  nbc and cbs right and mainstream media cnn all that stuff the vast majority of people
[3:50:00.520 --> 3:50:08.920]  are questioning the reality that's presented on that box the vast majority of people would rather
[3:50:08.920 --> 3:50:16.120]  listen to their neighbor in many instances and see what is posted on social media and that's why
[3:50:16.120 --> 3:50:22.040]  you've seen so much censorship the last two three years and info wars is a target so i'm going to
[3:50:22.040 --> 3:50:27.960]  say this you know i know he's got great products i know reset wars is out there save info wars
[3:50:27.960 --> 3:50:36.360]  dot com give a straight donation before 2022 let the man take a rest we all need a rest trust me
[3:50:36.360 --> 3:50:42.120]  you know one of the main things of this whole nightmare this kovat 1984 nightmare is that you
[3:50:42.120 --> 3:50:49.960]  are also going to have to find a way to navigate this situation i don't like talking about bio
[3:50:49.960 --> 3:50:56.520]  weapons that have been unleashed on the public and then injected into the public in different
[3:50:56.520 --> 3:51:04.440]  uh regiments but that was something i was talking about with alex jones uh over a year ago on my
[3:51:04.440 --> 3:51:09.720]  program when we were discussing how do we become the great resistance to this very real great reset
[3:51:09.720 --> 3:51:17.000]  agenda okay one of the ways that you help resist guess what it's supporting this broadcast and
[3:51:17.560 --> 3:51:23.480]  info wars dot com isn't perfect jason bermas ain't perfect i can tell you that right now uh but the
[3:51:23.480 --> 3:51:31.800]  heart is in the right place and we want to see more arrests more convictions more accountability
[3:51:31.800 --> 3:51:37.560]  i'd love to see the checks and balances of a judicial executive and legislative branch but
[3:51:37.560 --> 3:51:43.000]  in order for that to occur at the very bare minimum guess what you have to have a fourth
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:49.000]  estate that asks tough questions you have to have a fourth estate that points out that john
[3:51:49.000 --> 3:51:55.960]  that john luke brunel was very much a part of this epstein network just like peter neigard
[3:51:55.960 --> 3:52:02.120]  was a part of this epstein network and it seems very apparent that despite what the media has said
[3:52:02.680 --> 3:52:13.000]  what that come on less wexner was absolutely a part of this network and less wexner aside
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:20.280]  from being you know this highfalutin billionaire in all these different arenas of fashion and models
[3:52:20.280 --> 3:52:27.960]  right he was very much involved in foreign policy for the israelis in fact there's a document out
[3:52:27.960 --> 3:52:35.800]  there from the wexner institute where the united states had toppled saddam but it was talking
[3:52:35.800 --> 3:52:43.720]  about how do we keep the united states in iraq now now the people have already seen us go into
[3:52:43.720 --> 3:52:49.320]  afghanistan and take over there now that we've seen mission accomplished over in iraq as well how
[3:52:49.320 --> 3:52:58.360]  do we get them to stay and they talked about a multitude of methods to manipulate the populace
[3:52:58.360 --> 3:53:02.600]  into doing so and guess what we're still there aren't we we're still in iraq how about that
[3:53:02.600 --> 3:53:08.200]  that 20 year anniversary will come up sooner than you know i think what what are we about 18 months
[3:53:08.200 --> 3:53:15.400]  out from that something like that 18 19 months so this military industrial complex does move on
[3:53:16.120 --> 3:53:22.440]  and unfortunately that's a reality we all have to face and that's what this battle is really
[3:53:22.440 --> 3:53:28.920]  it is the battle for humanity because the transhumanist nightmare they want to impose on us
[3:53:28.920 --> 3:53:36.120]  us through regulations they're trying to say that we're harming the planet our carbon needs to be
[3:53:36.120 --> 3:53:45.320]  reduced okay we need a social credit score so we can all have a stake hold in the new society
[3:53:45.320 --> 3:53:51.800]  about our feelings right meanwhile they use the technology to empower themselves over us
[3:53:51.800 --> 3:53:57.240]  they are beholden to none of those rules and our very souls or whatever you believe we have
[3:53:57.240 --> 3:54:02.120]  because i'm not a bible thumper i'm not here to tell you what to believe but i think our
[3:54:02.120 --> 3:54:11.080]  consciousness our very being is something that they cannot replicate that goes well outside okay
[3:54:11.080 --> 3:54:19.080]  well outside of the you know two 3d dimensional universe that we see we know there are other
[3:54:19.080 --> 3:54:25.480]  not only spectrums of like things that are around us we could never even comprehend we can't accept
[3:54:25.480 --> 3:54:31.320]  that we also know that our very beings our minds our thoughts are extremely powerful and that's
[3:54:31.320 --> 3:54:36.840]  something they've tried to suppress with their technology so you want to hardwire something
[3:54:36.840 --> 3:54:44.600]  into your brain or you want to allow these people to use their quote unquote non invasive
[3:54:44.600 --> 3:54:52.360]  technologies and magnetic fields to then monitor your brain and whether or not you might be a
[3:54:52.360 --> 3:54:59.080]  dissident that's all in this document again forget about you know silent weapons for quiet wars
[3:54:59.080 --> 3:55:04.520]  and all that stuff that was is written back they're putting it in their own technological white
[3:55:04.520 --> 3:55:10.200]  papers and openly touting who's going to be doing it the robots are now rolling out on a
[3:55:10.200 --> 3:55:18.680]  commercial basis spot the DARPA robot is doing dances meanwhile they're telling you the human
[3:55:18.680 --> 3:55:23.400]  race is going to the stars we're going to the moon we're going to Mars we're going to college
[3:55:23.400 --> 3:55:31.800]  we do all these great things that's not reality they're going to trap you in a metaverse in virtual
[3:55:31.800 --> 3:55:41.800]  reality in isolation and not only a pharmaceutical medical tyrannical nightmare like we're seeing
[3:55:41.800 --> 3:55:52.920]  now but one that involves bio nanotechnology that can do things we can only imagine and once again
[3:55:52.920 --> 3:56:01.080]  info wars dot com has been at the forefront for exposing that agenda i am jason bermas i've been

[3:56:07.480 --> 3:56:11.480]  which i did get back because of a lot of you guys and the fact that again it's all selective
[3:56:11.480 --> 3:56:18.600]  enforcement and they want to censor the truth to promote their false narrative that is an
[3:56:18.600 --> 3:56:23.720]  inverted reality we're going to fight them tooth and nail i know you are too so follow me over at

[3:57:08.680 --> 3:57:13.960]  believe that and again that's one of the aspects of this glane maxwell trial they are having to
[3:57:13.960 --> 3:57:17.720]  burn some of their own do you think that ebstein thought he was going to have his neck broken
[3:57:17.720 --> 3:57:23.880]  in three places do you think that glane maxwell thought she was going to spend her 60th birthday

[3:57:58.680 --> 3:58:02.840]  that they see through the fraud of the new world order that they're saying no to claus wab bill
[3:58:02.840 --> 3:58:07.720]  gates and the great reset and so now info wars credibility is stronger than it's ever been
