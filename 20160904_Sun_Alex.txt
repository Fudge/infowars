[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  They said in October I'd be dead in six months.
[00:16.000 --> 00:27.640]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:27.640 --> 00:33.720]  So Hillary Rodham Clinton wants to be the first lady of the United States.
[00:33.720 --> 00:38.520]  But last Friday it came out the FBI did the big data dump ahead of the holiday weekend
[00:38.520 --> 00:41.360]  so nobody would look at the information.
[00:41.360 --> 00:47.240]  It turns out she couldn't answer questions about all the lies she told the FBI and federal
[00:47.240 --> 00:52.360]  prosecutors and investigators because she had a traumatic brain injury and disorder.
[00:52.360 --> 00:55.600]  But I thought that was a conspiracy theory.
[00:55.600 --> 01:01.840]  Here's the headline from infowars.com, who's also an associated press, you name it, Reuters.
[01:01.840 --> 01:07.880]  Hillary couldn't answer FBI questions due to brain injury doc show.
[01:07.880 --> 01:12.800]  Clinton decided concussion for being unable to recall details regarding private email
[01:12.800 --> 01:14.320]  server.
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.560]  So she wants to be president but she can't remember any details because she's so brain
[01:18.560 --> 01:23.720]  damaged and it's a conspiracy theory to say that she is brain damaged even though the
[01:23.720 --> 01:28.160]  Secret Service has told this individual that she is seriously brain damaged and many times
[01:28.160 --> 01:32.840]  has trouble even walking and you see her being reclusively held back from the public, being
[01:32.840 --> 01:43.360]  spirited, being circulated, being posited into areas that are very, very hard to see.
[01:43.360 --> 01:47.320]  Add this to a month ago, I myself and Donald Trump others came out and said we're really
[01:47.320 --> 01:49.160]  worried about election fraud in this campaign.
[01:49.160 --> 01:50.160]  We've got a long history.
[01:50.160 --> 01:54.680]  You try to steal the nomination from Trump, you did steal it from Bernie Sanders.
[01:54.680 --> 01:58.680]  We're going to be investigating and Obama came out and said this is preposterous why
[01:58.680 --> 02:02.600]  the federal government doesn't investigate or the federal government doesn't get involved
[02:02.600 --> 02:03.600]  in elections.
[02:03.600 --> 02:05.240]  It's all run by locals.
[02:05.240 --> 02:08.520]  Now they've come out and announced that Homeland Security is taking over and running the elections
[02:08.520 --> 02:11.880]  along with EU bureaucrats.
[02:11.880 --> 02:19.360]  So this is now all really unraveling for the social, for the social engineers and they've
[02:19.360 --> 02:22.200]  got big problems with their deceptive narratives.
[02:22.200 --> 02:30.000]  But I want to ask you the viewers today on this Sunday, the fourth day of September 2016,
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.200]  are they crazy enough to try to put a corpse, not just a physical person in bad shape, but
[02:36.200 --> 02:40.080]  a political corpse of an old twisted dynasty.
[02:40.080 --> 02:43.080]  Thanks to the Republicans and libertarians doing the right thing, real libertarians,
[02:43.080 --> 02:48.440]  not Gary Johnson the shill, we saw the Bush dynasty finally destroyed to a great extent.
[02:48.440 --> 02:53.040]  Goed away, discredited.
[02:53.040 --> 02:58.040]  But now, I guess they're back with another reincarnation of the Clintons and the Clintons
[02:58.040 --> 03:01.560]  basically had two terms, the Obama who they helped put in office had two terms.
[03:01.560 --> 03:06.640]  This will be their fifth and sixth term if Hillary is able to get into the White House.
[03:06.640 --> 03:11.520]  It'll open it up for her sixth term, she'll be in for her fifth term as co-president.
[03:11.520 --> 03:13.480]  How far will this go?
[03:13.480 --> 03:17.280]  What will we put up with or have they gone too far?
[03:17.280 --> 03:21.040]  Putting a puppet like this in, even though the public is rejecting it and even though
[03:21.040 --> 03:25.720]  that puppet itself is clearly flailing around having serious health problems.
[03:25.720 --> 03:29.920]  Now that said, today is going to be a very special broadcast because I've got a lot of
[03:29.920 --> 03:34.720]  special reports we've never aired yet, or special reports that are so important I want
[03:34.720 --> 03:36.960]  to air them again.
[03:36.960 --> 03:42.720]  And some of those are the elite trying to become quote, real life vampires.
[03:42.720 --> 03:45.040]  I'm not saying Peter Thiel wants to be a vampire.
[03:45.040 --> 03:48.480]  I'm saying that all the major billionaires that we look at are obsessed with life ascension
[03:48.480 --> 03:53.920]  technologies and so much of that orbits around the blood of the young.
[03:53.920 --> 03:59.240]  So yes, this is really wild, really kooky, really crazy, but it's historic that ruling
[03:59.240 --> 04:03.320]  class elites are obsessed with the blood of the innocents over and over again.
[04:03.320 --> 04:08.520]  Then we'll ask the question, are the elite hijacking the second earth discovery that
[04:08.520 --> 04:12.680]  we've seen almost no coverage of, but it's truly amazing information.
[04:12.680 --> 04:17.200]  Then we'll look back over a week ago to the truth about Hillary's alt-right speech.
[04:17.200 --> 04:21.200]  We'll look back at Matt Grudge's warning of internet ghettos.
[04:21.200 --> 04:24.440]  Inquisition 2.0, the internet has begun.
[04:24.440 --> 04:28.320]  It's downward plunge with a new world order taking in hostage.
[04:28.320 --> 04:31.640]  We also have breaking info, George Soros is taking over the internet.
[04:31.640 --> 04:35.440]  We have his own hacked emails and documents.
[04:35.440 --> 04:36.920]  It's all coming up.
[04:36.920 --> 04:43.680]  Also, we have Paul Watson's report that we hear on Friday dealing with the fact that
[04:43.680 --> 04:48.160]  we have Hillary shooting off her mouth about war with Russia and that ties into my report.
[04:48.160 --> 04:52.320]  The threat of nuclear war is not fear porn and that's just the first hour.
[04:52.320 --> 05:02.200]  I'm Alex Jones, stay with us.
[05:02.200 --> 05:15.360]  I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off coaching basketball, I get in here
[05:15.360 --> 05:19.720]  at 8.30, I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it
[05:19.720 --> 05:23.120]  and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview, I got my bottle of brain force
[05:23.120 --> 05:27.320]  right there, I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like everything just
[05:27.320 --> 05:28.760]  kind of clears up.
[05:28.760 --> 05:33.320]  It's got four and a half stars, people really love it, read about it, find out why third
[05:33.320 --> 05:38.040]  party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best
[05:38.040 --> 05:41.480]  organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[05:41.480 --> 05:44.440]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while but I probably could not have done
[05:44.440 --> 05:45.440]  it without brain force.
[05:45.440 --> 05:50.440]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain
[05:50.440 --> 05:51.760]  force and came in.
[05:51.760 --> 05:58.760]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[06:21.760 --> 06:40.480]  Is the sun in the future of humanity rising or is it setting?
[06:40.480 --> 06:48.240]  Has the age of the vampire arrived or does the age of the parasitic blood drinker fallen?
[06:48.240 --> 06:54.280]  Will we continue to allow our souls to be held captive by the globalist system or will we
[06:54.280 --> 06:57.080]  break free?
[06:57.080 --> 07:01.240]  The secret to reversing some effects of aging might be in the blood of the young.
[07:01.240 --> 07:06.560]  Three new studies have found that blood from young mice can reverse symptoms of aging in
[07:06.560 --> 07:08.160]  older mice.
[07:08.160 --> 07:12.120]  Three studies will be published this week in the journal Science and Nature, each exploring
[07:12.120 --> 07:14.240]  the regenerative properties of young blood.
[07:14.240 --> 07:19.720]  The blood of the young can make the old a young again.
[07:19.720 --> 07:20.720]  Are you kidding me?
[07:20.720 --> 07:22.640]  It sounds like out of a sci-fi movie or something.
[07:22.640 --> 07:23.640]  So what is it in the blood?
[07:23.640 --> 07:24.640]  Do we know?
[07:24.640 --> 07:27.440]  Peter Thiel here, a member of the PayPal mafia, it's called.
[07:27.440 --> 07:35.360]  He's 48 years old and yet plans to live forever, forever, forever, forever, forever.
[07:35.360 --> 07:42.120]  The process is called parabiosis and there's a company called Ambrosia that is openly
[07:42.120 --> 07:45.880]  raising money to bring it to market.
[07:45.880 --> 07:50.960]  Libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel, who is the star of the Republican National Convention
[07:50.960 --> 07:58.720]  for coming out as being gay, is also a fan of blood, blood transfusions.
[07:58.720 --> 08:05.280]  Parabiosis is a process of taking a young person's blood and putting it into your veins, into
[08:05.280 --> 08:12.880]  your cardiovascular system to rejuvenate your body with the essence of the young.
[08:12.880 --> 08:18.440]  What it really is is modern vampirism.
[08:18.440 --> 08:22.940]  Now I want to be clear, I don't think Peter is a bad person just because he's attended
[08:22.940 --> 08:24.440]  Bilderberg meeting.
[08:24.440 --> 08:30.760]  I don't think he's a bad person just because he's into the science of blood transfusion.
[08:30.760 --> 08:37.800]  My concern though is with the larger cultural movement to see human beings and human fluids
[08:37.800 --> 08:45.760]  as nothing more than commodities.
[08:45.760 --> 08:51.480]  Now the mainstream media is selling the idea that this technique, parabiosis, is the fountain
[08:51.480 --> 08:55.640]  of youth and that Peter is the first person to really push it.
[08:55.640 --> 09:00.480]  Actually, if you read it in the press, the queen mother for more than 30 years before
[09:00.480 --> 09:06.680]  she died was getting sometimes entire whole body blood transfusions.
[09:06.680 --> 09:10.480]  It's been reported that Queen Elizabeth II also gets them as well as Prince Charles.
[09:10.480 --> 09:15.680]  But one of the story really gets weird is that Prince Charles came out in the last decade
[09:15.680 --> 09:20.080]  and said, I'm a direct descendant of Vlad the Impaler, who was of course the Hungarian
[09:20.080 --> 09:26.520]  or Romanian count Dracula of history that opposed the Muslim invasion.
[09:26.520 --> 09:31.480]  The genealogy shows that I'm a descendant of Vlad the Impaler, so I do have a bit of
[09:31.480 --> 09:34.560]  a stake in the country.
[09:34.560 --> 09:38.760]  I remember almost 20 years ago interviewing the author of Bloodlines the Illuminati Fritz
[09:38.760 --> 09:43.200]  Springmeier and he was talking about the fact that Prince Charles and the royal family
[09:43.200 --> 09:46.800]  of England traced their lines back to Vlad the Impaler.
[09:46.800 --> 09:48.400]  I thought he was a cook.
[09:48.400 --> 09:49.400]  I thought he was a liar.
[09:49.400 --> 09:53.720]  Then a few years later they were in the British news admitting that and saying that Prince
[09:53.720 --> 09:56.840]  Charles was obsessed with Dracula.
[09:56.840 --> 10:01.320]  Then they started digging up dead bodies on the royal family's palaces and that of children.
[10:01.320 --> 10:06.920]  And then Jimmy Savelle, who was highly connected with the royal family, was basically caught
[10:06.920 --> 10:10.920]  with all these dungeons and torture centers and it had turned out that he was a Satanist
[10:10.920 --> 10:14.720]  who was abusing children through the children's charity and that the BBC had been running
[10:14.720 --> 10:16.920]  it and was basically protecting all of it.
[10:16.920 --> 10:18.960]  Then it made more and more sense.
[10:18.960 --> 10:26.040]  And then I began to research even more and found out that the people running things aren't
[10:26.040 --> 10:31.440]  physical, immortal vampires, but they have the spirit of what you describe as a vampire
[10:31.440 --> 10:33.000]  and they believe they're God Lucifer.
[10:33.000 --> 10:38.200]  If they establish a world government, it's going to give them eternal life.
[10:38.200 --> 10:44.200]  And now they're mainlining the idea of baby parts and blood from the young to make the
[10:44.200 --> 10:48.400]  rich live longer.
[10:48.400 --> 10:54.200]  The Mayans and the Aztec culture that came out of it sold the body parts of those that
[10:54.200 --> 10:58.060]  were sacrificed to the gods.
[10:58.060 --> 11:01.880]  They themselves funded their priesthood on the sale of human meat.
[11:01.880 --> 11:06.040]  When we talk about the legend of vampires, we have to understand that every culture has
[11:06.040 --> 11:12.560]  this because there's always been psychopaths and other groups of individuals who have joined
[11:12.560 --> 11:18.360]  forces and created central governments to actually carry out the practice of bloodletting,
[11:18.360 --> 11:25.120]  bloodlust, human sacrifice, and that the legend of blood drinking vampires has its roots in
[11:25.120 --> 11:30.880]  real activity that's taken place in every century, in every millennium, and in every
[11:30.880 --> 11:31.880]  culture.
[11:31.880 --> 11:36.680]  Now to be clear, from our deep research, we don't believe that actual semi or totally
[11:36.680 --> 11:45.240]  immortal vampires exist, but the spirit of parasitic evil does exist and has been manifested
[11:45.240 --> 11:51.000]  through what we would call satanic bloodlines in every culture throughout history.
[11:51.000 --> 11:55.920]  And we see, again, establishment media pushing the idea of women eating babies placenas at
[11:55.920 --> 12:00.560]  birth and Kim Kardashian doing blood facials.
[12:00.560 --> 12:05.160]  The idea that if we take something from some other human, we ourselves get something.
[12:05.160 --> 12:10.520]  This is the psychopaths setting up a system where they're the Morlocks from A.C.E. Wells
[12:10.520 --> 12:15.640]  and we are the suboid Eloise, the innocents who are being fed on.
[12:15.640 --> 12:21.760]  We have a predator class establishing a system where the general public is the prey.
[12:21.760 --> 12:27.760]  Now the king of the vampires in all of world history is the Communist Chinese.
[12:27.760 --> 12:33.760]  The Communist Chinese killed between 65 and 84 million people, according to their own
[12:33.760 --> 12:41.000]  channels, just during Mao Zedong's Communist rule, and to this day, hundreds of thousands
[12:41.000 --> 12:48.120]  of political dissidents a year who've committed no crimes are grabbed, put in prison, blood
[12:48.120 --> 12:54.600]  typed, prepared, and then rich Westerners fly into Japan just an hour away.
[12:54.600 --> 12:59.360]  Then the prisoners taken, they are gutted in a mobile execution van on the tarmac.
[12:59.360 --> 13:04.720]  The fresh organs are loaded on ice, flown to Tokyo and other Japanese cities where the
[13:04.720 --> 13:10.240]  organs are implanted in rich Asians, Westerners, and others.
[13:10.240 --> 13:16.880]  This is true vampire activity where you murder a Buddhist or some other person for their
[13:16.880 --> 13:22.360]  religious or political activity and then steal their organs, make money off of it, and implant
[13:22.360 --> 13:27.400]  it in decadent slobs that paid for the luxury.
[13:27.400 --> 13:30.920]  The truth is, all of us have a little bit of vampire ennis.
[13:30.920 --> 13:32.560]  All of us can be predators.
[13:32.560 --> 13:35.960]  All of us cannot have empathy for our fellow humans and dehumanize them.
[13:35.960 --> 13:39.400]  It's very easy to see the dumbed down public, if you're intelligent, and decide to not
[13:39.400 --> 13:44.080]  try to help them, but to just let them be ignorant and basically capitalize on the fact
[13:44.080 --> 13:46.600]  that they're unaware of what's happening around them.
[13:46.600 --> 13:50.480]  But all of us must transcend this because you reap what you sow.
[13:50.480 --> 13:52.080]  What comes around goes around.
[13:52.080 --> 13:53.440]  Call it karma.
[13:53.440 --> 13:56.280]  We as a species must face the light.
[13:56.280 --> 14:00.480]  We must look into the sun and not hide in the darkness.
[14:00.480 --> 14:06.720]  We must come together and realize that the elite know that there are very serious developments
[14:06.720 --> 14:12.560]  in life extension technology, and have openly said they want a world government in control
[14:12.560 --> 14:15.760]  so the general public doesn't have access to this.
[14:15.760 --> 14:20.880]  There are a lot of clean, healthy, safe ways to extend our lives, and the establishment
[14:20.880 --> 14:22.280]  knows this.
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.560]  The fountain of youth won't be found in the blood of babies or virgins.
[14:26.560 --> 14:33.320]  We know that Satanists on record have been involved inside abortuaries conducting ceremonies.
[14:33.320 --> 14:37.600]  We know that children for thousands of years have been tortured so that they release hormones
[14:37.600 --> 14:42.360]  under their blood so that initiates can have these powerful religious experiences.
[14:42.360 --> 14:46.560]  That's why it's important to understand that humanity is not a commodity.
[14:46.560 --> 14:53.600]  Because humanity has made the image of God and that we face absolute judgment when we
[14:53.600 --> 14:58.320]  attack the human genetic code and also the genetic code of this planet because it was
[14:58.320 --> 15:01.600]  made by the Creator.
[15:01.600 --> 15:03.880]  The archetypes are clear.
[15:03.880 --> 15:08.280]  Legend points the way to not just the past, the present, but the future.
[15:08.280 --> 15:13.920]  The vampire operates in the dark, in the occult, in the secret, in the hidden.
[15:13.920 --> 15:17.080]  The liberty lever operates in the light.
[15:17.080 --> 15:19.560]  You will decide the future of humanity.
[15:19.560 --> 15:24.640]  You will decide if the sun is rising or if the sun is setting.
[15:24.640 --> 15:30.400]  We will decide whether the age of vampires is now dawning upon us or whether the age
[15:30.400 --> 15:52.760]  of vampires is now ending.
[16:01.160 --> 16:05.320]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from InfowarsLife.com.

[16:46.160 --> 16:51.600]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant derived or of the highest
[16:51.600 --> 16:53.320]  quality lab standard.
[16:53.320 --> 16:54.760]  That means it's clean.
[16:54.760 --> 16:55.760]  That means it's pure.
[16:55.760 --> 16:58.840]  That's InfowarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[17:21.040 --> 17:25.120]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[17:25.120 --> 17:30.360]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[17:30.360 --> 17:34.440]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[17:34.440 --> 17:36.240]  the products that you need each month.

[17:49.080 --> 17:50.680]  this is a sure win.

[18:05.880 --> 18:06.880]  nutraceuticals.
[18:06.880 --> 18:11.960]  Young Jevity integrates years of scientific research into creating fantastic products

[18:52.600 --> 18:56.280]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how Young Jevity and the products
[18:56.280 --> 18:59.000]  at InfowarsTeam.com have changed their lives.
[18:59.000 --> 19:02.000]  Check it out for yourself today.
[19:02.000 --> 19:03.480]  Clean pure drinking water.
[19:03.480 --> 19:05.000]  You can't survive without it.
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.160]  But where do you get it?
[19:06.160 --> 19:11.120]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity fed water filtration system that is
[19:11.120 --> 19:12.120]  like no other.
[19:12.120 --> 19:17.440]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking
[19:17.440 --> 19:22.600]  water, pairing the unprecedented super filtration power of an all new gravity block core with
[19:22.600 --> 19:24.320]  a hybrochromatic shell.
[19:24.320 --> 19:32.280]  It removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants,
[19:32.280 --> 19:38.080]  volatile organic contaminants and hormones, filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons, stainless
[19:38.080 --> 19:43.360]  fuel construction, easy assembly, low maintenance, replacement filters are simple to install.
[19:43.360 --> 19:48.400]  And now, as part of an exclusive limited time introductory offer, you can save $20 off
[19:48.400 --> 19:50.600]  the retail price and get free shipping.

[19:55.200 --> 19:56.200]  off.
[19:56.200 --> 20:24.720]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[20:24.720 --> 20:47.720]  A second, Earth like planet, just a mere 4.243 light years away has been discovered.
[20:47.720 --> 20:52.800]  A distance that would take the average human using current propulsion technology, hurtling
[20:52.800 --> 20:59.320]  through space at 20,000 miles per hour, give or take 100,000 years to travel to, has quite
[20:59.320 --> 21:04.320]  possibly been discovered right in our own backyard in the habitable zone of a neighboring
[21:04.320 --> 21:07.080]  system known as Proxima Centauri.
[21:07.080 --> 21:33.040]  Subbed Kepler 452B, the Earth like planet is roughly 60% larger than Earth.
[21:33.040 --> 21:38.360]  Of course, the vampiric elite of planet Earth are beside themselves with world conquering
[21:38.360 --> 21:39.360]  glee.
[21:39.360 --> 21:43.360]  Mark Zuckerberg and his Russian internet billionaire counterpart, Yuri Milner, are
[21:43.360 --> 21:48.240]  hatching a plan to escape the confines of the earthbound hell pit the elite created
[21:48.240 --> 21:51.560]  and preside over for greener pastures.
[21:51.560 --> 22:06.120]  But now we can transcend it, with light beams, light sails and the lightest spacecraft ever
[22:06.120 --> 22:11.120]  built, we can launch a mission to Alpha Centauri within a generation.
[22:11.120 --> 22:16.320]  Although having been extremely successful, NASA is being constructed as incapable as
[22:16.320 --> 22:20.880]  a failed government bureaucracy, indeed as somehow effeminate.
[22:20.880 --> 22:25.320]  In addition, there is a trend wherein private companies contracted with the government are
[22:25.320 --> 22:29.280]  gradually beginning to take over the business of space missions.
[22:29.280 --> 22:34.680]  These processes regarding space exploration space travel are consistent with my argument
[22:34.680 --> 22:40.440]  that part of the hyper privatization mandate is to transfer many of NASA's assets over
[22:40.440 --> 22:42.040]  to the private sector.
[22:42.040 --> 22:48.360]  Space missions to other celestial bodies large and small in the past were carried out exclusively
[22:48.360 --> 22:50.160]  by government entities.
[22:50.160 --> 22:56.080]  For the next decade, we will work with experts here at ESO and elsewhere to get as much information
[22:56.080 --> 23:01.840]  as possible about the proximate Centauri planet, perhaps as noted even including whether it
[23:01.840 --> 23:03.160]  might bear life.
[23:03.160 --> 23:08.360]  Yuri Milner, Stephen Hawking and Mark Zuckerberg oversee our project.
[23:08.360 --> 23:11.560]  It doesn't look like a space shuttle or a voyager.
[23:11.560 --> 23:19.920]  The ultimate spacecraft is going to be about the size of this, maybe quite a bit lighter,
[23:19.920 --> 23:22.760]  and having much more functionality.
[23:22.760 --> 23:27.200]  Space travel was an ambitious endeavor that brought millions of people together.
[23:27.200 --> 23:32.840]  Humankind sat transfixed on Neil Armstrong's giant leap for mankind, now like everything
[23:32.840 --> 23:36.680]  else that has been hijacked by the emerging new world order.
[23:36.680 --> 23:41.800]  The human prospect of traveling to distant worlds has been consolidated and relegated
[23:41.800 --> 23:46.880]  to a handful of hubris riddled elite held bent on the survival of their own selfish
[23:46.880 --> 23:47.880]  goals.
[23:47.880 --> 23:53.240]  In your estimation, what's the probability of finding intelligent alien life in the
[23:53.240 --> 23:55.560]  next 20 years and why?
[23:55.560 --> 23:59.480]  The probability is low, probably.
[23:59.480 --> 24:04.760]  May they one day travel at the speed of light only to finally arrive on a planet inhabited
[24:04.760 --> 24:07.440]  by 50-foot-tall patriots.
[24:07.440 --> 24:20.040]  John Bown for InfoWars.com
[24:20.040 --> 24:25.600]  Hillary Clinton interrupted her coughing fits, seizures and three-day naps to attack the
[24:25.600 --> 24:26.600]  alt-right.
[24:26.600 --> 24:30.680]  Clinton savaged Trump for weaving dark conspiracy theories.
[24:30.680 --> 24:36.640]  Oh, you mean dark conspiracy theories like a YouTube video being responsible for Benghazi?
[24:36.640 --> 24:39.280]  What difference at this point does it make?
[24:39.280 --> 24:44.720]  She then proceeded to weave her own gigantic dark conspiracy theory, namely that Vladimir
[24:44.720 --> 24:49.400]  Putin controls InfoWars, Breitbart and the entire alt-right.
[24:49.400 --> 24:57.400]  And the grand godfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism is Russian President
[24:57.400 --> 24:59.880]  Vladimir Putin.
[24:59.880 --> 25:06.600]  That's funny because I don't recall receiving my paycheck in the mail from the Kremlin.
[25:06.600 --> 25:11.080]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[25:11.080 --> 25:15.760]  Right, so Trump is the conspiracy theorist for listening to Alex Jones, yet you just
[25:15.760 --> 25:21.800]  asserted that a former KGB officer under the communist government of the Soviet Union is
[25:21.800 --> 25:24.320]  now the leader of conservatives in America.
[25:24.320 --> 25:25.600]  What does that mean?
[25:25.600 --> 25:30.080]  Of course, Hillary failed to identify the real leader of the alt-right.
[25:30.080 --> 25:36.040]  Oh, yeah, and according to another one of Hillary's dark conspiracy theories, Trump
[25:36.040 --> 25:39.040]  is responsible for bullying in schools.
[25:39.040 --> 25:40.760]  The Trump effect.
[25:40.760 --> 25:43.320]  Bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools.
[25:43.320 --> 25:47.800]  Right, because it's not like Trump supporters have been viciously attacked and harassed
[25:47.800 --> 25:50.760]  by leftists for the last six months solid.
[25:50.760 --> 25:53.080]  But wait, it gets even funnier.
[25:53.080 --> 25:57.600]  Hillary began reading out headlines written by Milo Yenopoulos.
[25:57.600 --> 26:00.600]  Hello.
[26:00.600 --> 26:03.760]  Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy.
[26:03.760 --> 26:05.040]  Nobody wants to f**k you.
[26:05.040 --> 26:12.200]  Would you rather your child had feminism or cancer?
[26:12.200 --> 26:19.040]  He is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over.
[26:19.040 --> 26:23.640]  Oh, you mean like you and Obama have been doing for the last two years by mainstreaming
[26:23.640 --> 26:29.600]  Black Lives Matter, a group that has inspired cop killers and whose ideological inspiration
[26:29.600 --> 26:32.640]  is on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list.
[26:32.640 --> 26:39.480]  These are racist ideas, race-baiting ideas, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-women,
[26:39.480 --> 26:46.080]  all key tenants making up the emerging racist ideology known as the alt-right.
[26:46.080 --> 26:51.880]  So posting dank memes makes you an evil racist, but openly praising and describing as your
[26:51.880 --> 26:58.520]  mentor a man who founded a KKK chapter called Black People Mongrels and campaigned against
[26:58.520 --> 27:00.120]  the Civil Rights Act.
[27:00.120 --> 27:02.120]  My friend and mentor, Robert Seabird.
[27:02.120 --> 27:03.720]  That's just fine.
[27:03.720 --> 27:09.400]  Hillary also said that the alt-right is anti-women, this from the so-called feminist who takes
[27:09.400 --> 27:15.000]  hundreds of millions of dollars from a country that treats women little better than cattle.
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.840]  Nigel Farage, who stoked anti-immigrant sentiments to win the referendum to have Britain leave
[27:21.840 --> 27:24.840]  the European Union campaign with Donald Trump in Mississippi.
[27:24.840 --> 27:27.760]  Yeah, the key word there, Hillary, is win.
[27:27.760 --> 27:35.800]  He won because the tactic of constantly calling him a racist failed, just like your speech.
[27:35.800 --> 27:41.200]  But seriously, if the alt-right are trolls, who inside Hillary's campaign thought it was
[27:41.200 --> 27:47.200]  a bright idea to do the one thing you're not supposed to do with trolls?
[27:47.200 --> 27:48.520]  Which is feed the trolls?
[27:48.520 --> 27:52.120]  The alt-right only succeeds if you respond.
[27:52.120 --> 27:56.240]  You just walked straight into a trap.
[27:56.240 --> 28:02.440]  The people running your campaign are complete idiots who don't understand how the internet
[28:02.440 --> 28:03.440]  works.
[28:03.440 --> 28:07.400]  This has backfired more than any of us could ever dream of.
[28:07.400 --> 28:12.080]  Hundreds of thousands of new people are now coming to our websites, where we'll continue
[28:12.080 --> 28:18.240]  to educate them about your failing health, rampant corruption, and sneering arrogant
[28:18.240 --> 28:47.240]  in elitism.
[28:48.240 --> 29:00.120]  5.
[29:00.120 --> 29:01.120]  From the InfoWars.
[29:01.120 --> 29:05.400]  Secret 12, InfoWars Lives, Vitamin B12 Formulation.
[29:05.400 --> 29:10.720]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[29:10.720 --> 29:11.720]  by the body.
[29:11.720 --> 29:16.400]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which
[29:16.400 --> 29:18.800]  are known to have higher absorption rates.
[29:18.800 --> 29:23.960]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful
[29:23.960 --> 29:28.160]  form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[29:28.160 --> 29:34.880]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimental grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin,
[29:34.880 --> 29:39.120]  the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[29:39.120 --> 29:42.480]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[29:42.480 --> 29:44.560]  No needles, no injections.
[29:44.560 --> 29:46.120]  Don't take my word for it.
[29:46.120 --> 29:47.560]  Try it for yourself.
[29:47.560 --> 29:48.560]  Discover the secret.
[29:48.560 --> 29:49.560]  Secret 12.

[29:57.560 --> 29:58.560]  InfoWarsLife.
[29:58.560 --> 29:59.560]  Secret 12.
[29:59.560 --> 30:05.360]  Not a group you developed living defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[30:05.360 --> 30:07.080]  Why is this so good?
[30:07.080 --> 30:11.760]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[30:11.760 --> 30:16.400]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[30:16.400 --> 30:22.080]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[30:22.080 --> 30:25.400]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[30:25.400 --> 30:30.520]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[30:30.520 --> 30:31.760]  going on everywhere.
[30:31.760 --> 30:32.760]  These are all parasites.
[30:32.760 --> 30:35.480]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[30:35.480 --> 30:39.840]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[30:39.840 --> 30:43.120]  I recommend doing a parasite plans at least twice a year.
[30:43.120 --> 30:46.120]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[30:46.120 --> 30:50.200]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, InfoWarsLife.com, and folks, you can't lose
[30:50.200 --> 30:56.400]  full of stuff that's great for your body, period, and you support the broadcast, InfoWarsLife.com.
[30:56.400 --> 30:58.640]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[30:58.640 --> 31:01.880]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[31:01.880 --> 31:03.760]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[31:03.760 --> 31:05.800]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:05.800 --> 31:08.640]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:08.640 --> 31:14.680]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:14.680 --> 31:19.640]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking
[31:19.640 --> 31:24.600]  Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[31:24.600 --> 31:29.440]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, through the best
[31:29.440 --> 31:31.440]  job you can to purify your air.
[31:31.440 --> 31:36.480]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:36.480 --> 31:39.480]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[31:39.480 --> 31:41.680]  The general public hasn't.
[31:41.680 --> 31:45.640]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:45.640 --> 31:49.240]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:49.240 --> 31:52.800]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[31:52.800 --> 31:56.000]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:56.000 --> 32:00.520]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[32:00.520 --> 32:03.000]  Hey, everyone.
[32:03.000 --> 32:06.720]  This is Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission
[32:06.720 --> 32:09.000]  to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.040]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[32:11.040 --> 32:15.800]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child
[32:15.800 --> 32:20.200]  in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are
[32:20.200 --> 32:21.200]  rampant.
[32:21.200 --> 32:24.640]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[32:24.640 --> 32:27.760]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[32:27.760 --> 32:30.560]  If you are dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your
[32:30.560 --> 32:34.880]  vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional
[32:34.880 --> 32:39.640]  raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental

[33:05.640 --> 33:23.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:23.960 --> 33:36.520]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:36.520 --> 33:40.960]  I'm here to say, and this is the reason why I came to see you, Alex, is you are one of
[33:40.960 --> 33:48.400]  the very few who are operating under this theory to be an independent American in a
[33:48.400 --> 33:49.400]  big way.
[33:49.400 --> 33:53.800]  If you're calling his media fine, if you're calling his sports, whatever it is, but you
[33:53.800 --> 33:56.400]  have got to be the greatest you can be now.
[33:56.400 --> 34:02.120]  I don't know why they've been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos
[34:02.120 --> 34:07.840]  of these Facebooks and these tweets and these Instagrams, these Instas.
[34:07.840 --> 34:09.360]  This is ghetto.
[34:09.360 --> 34:10.360]  This is ghetto.
[34:10.360 --> 34:11.360]  This is corporate.
[34:11.360 --> 34:14.120]  They're taking your energy.
[34:14.120 --> 34:17.120]  They're taking your energy and you're getting nothing in return, nothing.
[34:17.120 --> 34:18.520]  They're dumbing the language down.
[34:18.520 --> 34:22.040]  Twitter's designed to reduce the language directly out of 1984.
[34:22.040 --> 34:23.040]  It's Insoc.
[34:23.040 --> 34:27.640]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me, said Matt, it's over
[34:27.640 --> 34:28.640]  for you.
[34:28.640 --> 34:30.960]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[34:30.960 --> 34:31.960]  You're out of there.
[34:31.960 --> 34:34.320]  They're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[34:34.320 --> 34:37.880]  To have a Supreme Court justice say that to my face that it's over.
[34:37.880 --> 34:41.760]  They've got the votes, which means time is limited.
[34:41.760 --> 34:43.160]  Time is not forever.
[34:43.160 --> 34:48.400]  How many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life rise and fall?
[34:48.400 --> 34:49.400]  There's not that many.
[34:49.400 --> 34:51.400]  It's a small amount.
[34:51.400 --> 34:55.840]  So for people to be saying with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and my greatness
[34:55.840 --> 34:56.840]  sometime.
[34:56.840 --> 34:57.840]  No.
[34:57.840 --> 34:58.840]  No, you can't.
[34:58.840 --> 34:59.840]  We're being enslaved now.
[34:59.840 --> 35:00.840]  And that's it.
[35:00.840 --> 35:05.840]  Under the TPP, they admit you can't put a headline to the New York Times.
[35:05.840 --> 35:08.160]  You're sending massive traffic to them.
[35:08.160 --> 35:10.840]  They're claiming you're taking their words.
[35:10.840 --> 35:11.840]  This is insane.
[35:11.840 --> 35:15.200]  And you had the Justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global law.
[35:15.200 --> 35:17.720]  Now, remember just recently getting lined up with it.
[35:17.720 --> 35:20.200]  So they're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[35:20.200 --> 35:22.240]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[35:22.240 --> 35:24.120]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[35:24.120 --> 35:30.680]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot
[35:30.680 --> 35:37.880]  have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[35:37.880 --> 35:40.200]  Waging war on corruption.
[35:40.200 --> 35:54.040]  That's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[35:54.040 --> 36:01.360]  Thematically every day, looking at hundreds and hundreds of news stories, a theme will
[36:01.360 --> 36:09.960]  emerge and more often than not the number one theme is global censorship of news and
[36:09.960 --> 36:12.680]  information.
[36:12.680 --> 36:17.920]  Many people will look at the collapse of the dinosaur media and the collapse of its credibility
[36:17.920 --> 36:18.920]  as something positive.
[36:18.920 --> 36:24.440]  And I do overall, but really now what do they have to lose?
[36:24.440 --> 36:30.440]  They have only intensified and then intensified again and then intensified again and again
[36:30.440 --> 36:32.280]  and again.
[36:32.280 --> 36:39.000]  The unification of deception and twisting information.
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.480]  But we have parallel media that is exposing it in real time.
[36:43.480 --> 36:48.600]  The next logical move for them to engage in is the takeover and the shutdown of that media.
[36:48.600 --> 36:54.400]  We were warned last year, I drive around this time of year by Matt Drudge, that he was told
[36:54.400 --> 36:58.560]  massive censorship was coming to the internet this year.
[36:58.560 --> 37:05.080]  And now we have even the Wall Street Journal today, an internet giveaway to the UN.
[37:05.080 --> 37:10.280]  The agreement with ICANN has been kept secret.
[37:10.280 --> 37:17.960]  And now they've gotten parts of it and it is the turnover to the UN and that dovetails
[37:17.960 --> 37:22.720]  with the fact that we have new documents from the Daily Caller, we need to do a unified
[37:22.720 --> 37:29.720]  story about this, Soros document, regulate internet to favor open society supporters.
[37:29.720 --> 37:36.240]  These are bloodthirsty monsters and they're moving, Hillary puts out a fundraiser, press
[37:36.240 --> 37:40.920]  release two weeks ago, didn't even hide it and says, right Bart doesn't have a right
[37:40.920 --> 37:44.040]  to exist, neither does the alt-conservative media, we're going to shut it down when I
[37:44.040 --> 37:45.040]  get in.
[37:45.040 --> 37:50.840]  Then she gives a speech last week and names yours truly as enemy number one, basically.
[37:50.840 --> 37:55.520]  Originally President Obama promised that the fed's handover of the Any Trust Protected
[37:55.520 --> 38:01.360]  Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers or ICANN would not involve the United
[38:01.360 --> 38:02.360]  Nations.
[38:02.360 --> 38:10.080]  If we fall for, you know, a bunch of Okie doke.
[38:10.080 --> 38:15.840]  Was this yet again a naive move by an incompetent president of the United States or has this
[38:15.840 --> 38:18.240]  been the plan all along?
[38:18.240 --> 38:22.960]  Time and time again, Congress has failed to pass draconian laws to control the internet.
[38:22.960 --> 38:29.480]  The Communications Decency Act of 1996, the Intellectual Property Enforcement Act of 2007,
[38:29.480 --> 38:35.400]  the Cyber Security Act, the Protect IP Act of 2011 and SOPA to name a few all failed
[38:35.400 --> 38:39.400]  miserably against the ironclad integrity of the First Amendment.
[38:39.400 --> 38:44.480]  The globalists scurrying to their den of iniquity at Bilderberg would hear none of it.
[38:44.480 --> 38:49.960]  Their very fortunes and lives depend on it, the public knows too much already.
[38:49.960 --> 38:54.840]  The role of the internet had to be torn from the protection of the U.S. Constitution.
[38:54.840 --> 38:59.880]  Larry Strickland of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a Commerce
[38:59.880 --> 39:06.880]  Department Agency, which has overseen ICANN since 1998, said, we will not accept a proposal
[39:06.880 --> 39:13.320]  that replaces the NTIA role with a government-led or an intergovernmental solution.
[39:13.320 --> 39:18.720]  Now after the full weight of Edward Snowden's revelations opened a treasure trove, the United
[39:18.720 --> 39:25.160]  States, in pure Hegelian dialectic fashion, offered to cede control to a multi-stakeholder,
[39:25.160 --> 39:27.600]  i.e., lobbyist-dominated model.
[39:27.600 --> 39:31.800]  That's right, the internet will be in the hands of lobbyists, the very bottom-featers
[39:31.800 --> 39:33.840]  of the whims of globalism.
[39:33.840 --> 39:34.840]  How bad is it?
[39:34.840 --> 39:39.480]  In the intervening years, the United Nations and the European Union had jostled for control
[39:39.480 --> 39:40.480]  of the internet.
[39:40.480 --> 39:45.280]  During a meeting in Dubai, the International Telecommunications Union, the telecom branch
[39:45.280 --> 39:50.760]  of the United Nations, demanded rules governing the internet to be rewritten.
[39:50.760 --> 39:56.480]  Specifically, the International Organization proposed deep-packet inspection authority
[39:56.480 --> 40:00.840]  that would allow it to monitor and censor content on the internet.
[40:00.840 --> 40:04.400]  The United States walked out of that conference in protest.
[40:04.400 --> 40:10.080]  What appears to be the mundane task of assigning parking spaces for internet businesses will
[40:10.080 --> 40:15.160]  more than likely face in the very near future a level of censorship that will make the free
[40:15.160 --> 40:20.480]  thinking people of the worldwide web's headspin, the Inquisition 2.0.
[40:20.480 --> 40:25.560]  The European Union has proposed the creation of a censorship and mass surveillance framework
[40:25.560 --> 40:28.880]  for EU countries funded by the European Commission.
[40:28.880 --> 40:34.800]  The Clean IT Project webpage explains the plan called for police to patrol Facebook and other
[40:34.800 --> 40:41.680]  social networks in search of extremist material and propaganda, in addition to allowing users
[40:41.680 --> 40:47.120]  to flag terrorist content and turn others into the police.
[40:47.120 --> 40:52.920]  In addition to censorship, the ICANN transfer will allow for a globalist taxation scheme,
[40:52.920 --> 40:57.560]  former Bush administration's State Department senior adviser Christian Whitten told The
[40:57.560 --> 41:03.320]  Daily Caller, if the UN gains control of what amounts to the directory and traffic signals
[41:03.320 --> 41:04.320]  of the internet.
[41:04.320 --> 41:07.400]  It can impose whatever taxes it likes.
[41:07.400 --> 41:12.840]  It likely would start with a tax on registering domains and expand from there.
[41:12.840 --> 41:15.600]  Transition that stewardship to the global community.
[41:15.600 --> 41:19.840]  Fadi Chahadi has been the CEO at ICANN since 2012.
[41:19.840 --> 41:25.880]  After having negotiated the full-scale globalization of the internet, Chahadi will be aptly rewarded
[41:25.880 --> 41:31.040]  by the New World Order acting as a senior adviser at Abri Partners, a private equity
[41:31.040 --> 41:34.640]  firm that controls an already monopolized media.
[41:34.640 --> 41:40.280]  Also as a co-chair of the newly formed World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, China, and last
[41:40.280 --> 41:46.720]  but not least, a senior adviser to Klaus Schwab, founder and chairman of the World Economic
[41:46.720 --> 41:47.720]  Forum.
[41:47.720 --> 41:50.720]  Schwab attended Bilderberg in 2016.
[41:50.720 --> 41:56.800]  An internal proposed strategy from George Soros' Open Society Justice Initiative calls for
[41:56.800 --> 42:02.760]  international regulation of private actors' decisions on, quote, what information is taken
[42:02.760 --> 42:06.360]  off the internet and what may remain, end quote.
[42:06.360 --> 42:12.000]  Those regulations, the document notes, should favor, quote, those most supportive of open
[42:12.000 --> 42:17.160]  society, end quote, open society being George Soros' organization.
[42:17.160 --> 42:24.000]  Soros and company, rather than striking directly at free speech progenitors like Infowars.com,
[42:24.000 --> 42:29.680]  are one month away from recklessly pulling the rug out from under everything.
[42:29.680 --> 42:35.320]  Now that ICANN is relinquished control of the medium, globalist institutions can move forward
[42:35.320 --> 42:40.880]  with plans to scrub the internet of all content unacceptable to the global elite and their
[42:40.880 --> 43:02.200]  minions at the United Nations, John Bowne, for Infowars.com.
[43:02.200 --> 43:04.200]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[43:04.200 --> 43:09.440]  Matt Lauer will moderate the first forum between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[43:09.440 --> 43:16.440]  On Wednesday, September 7, NBC News and MSNBC, along with the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans
[43:16.440 --> 43:20.520]  of America, will host the Commander-in-Chief Forum in New York City.
[43:20.520 --> 43:25.440]  It will be a one hour long forum where Clinton and Trump will answer questions about national
[43:25.440 --> 43:26.440]  security.
[43:26.440 --> 43:32.760]  The two candidates, though, will not be on stage at the same time, but instead will go
[43:32.760 --> 43:34.360]  back to back.
[43:34.360 --> 43:40.120]  Once again, Hillary Clinton is too scared to get on the same stage as Donald Trump.
[43:40.120 --> 43:41.120]  She's a coward.
[43:41.120 --> 43:42.280]  Where's Hillary?
[43:42.280 --> 43:43.980]  She's not in Louisiana.
[43:43.980 --> 43:45.480]  She's not in Mexico.
[43:45.480 --> 43:49.560]  She's not on the same stage as Donald Trump because she's sick.
[43:49.560 --> 43:53.200]  She's demented and she can't actually debate.
[43:53.200 --> 43:55.200]  She's scared f***-less.
[43:55.200 --> 44:01.160]  You can find more reports at Infowars.com.
[44:01.160 --> 44:04.560]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[44:04.560 --> 44:09.840]  Deep Cleanse by InfowarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocoloidal zeolites
[44:09.840 --> 44:13.960]  and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[45:59.440 --> 46:01.440]  Check it out for yourself today.
[46:01.440 --> 46:06.600]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what has been
[46:06.600 --> 46:08.360]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[46:08.360 --> 46:12.680]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[46:12.680 --> 46:17.920]  devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[46:17.920 --> 46:21.640]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[46:21.640 --> 46:25.360]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[46:25.360 --> 46:29.880]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[46:29.880 --> 46:32.320]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[46:32.320 --> 46:37.760]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[46:37.760 --> 46:43.560]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[46:43.560 --> 46:45.160]  ever concerning iodine.
[46:45.160 --> 46:47.120]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[46:47.120 --> 46:51.400]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to

[47:21.000 --> 47:38.440]  Cashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[47:38.440 --> 47:53.240]  We even know year by year what's going to happen, and they know we know.
[47:53.240 --> 47:57.280]  It's only you that they tell these fables and you buy it and spread it to the citizens
[47:57.280 --> 47:58.280]  of your countries.
[47:58.280 --> 48:03.960]  And your people do not feel a sense of being pinned in danger.
[48:03.960 --> 48:04.960]  This is what worries me.
[48:04.960 --> 48:11.720]  How do you not understand that the world is being pulled in an irreversible direction?
[48:11.720 --> 48:12.720]  That is the problem.
[48:12.720 --> 48:15.120]  But they pretend like nothing's going on.
[48:15.120 --> 48:17.840]  I don't even know how to get through to you people anymore.
[48:17.840 --> 48:28.040]  Putin will try to destabilize Ukraine, but the Ukrainians, the large majority of Ukrainians
[48:28.040 --> 48:31.560]  are determined to be independent of Russia.
[48:31.560 --> 48:34.560]  Well then, why are you interfering in our business?
[48:34.560 --> 48:38.000]  One medal in our business, sort out your own issues first.
[48:38.000 --> 48:44.120]  Mr. Trump declared that he is ready to restore full cooperative relations with Russia.
[48:44.120 --> 48:45.480]  What's so bad about that?
[48:45.480 --> 48:46.640]  We all welcome that.
[48:46.640 --> 48:57.680]  Do you not?
[48:57.680 --> 49:11.440]  In recent years, we have seen a cacophony of geopolitical experts, historians, statisticians,
[49:11.440 --> 49:20.840]  statesmen come out and warn that the world is hurtling towards major military conflict
[49:20.840 --> 49:26.320]  between the United States and Russia, and that the climate that we see in the world
[49:26.320 --> 49:32.400]  today is very similar to what we saw before World War I and World War II.
[49:32.400 --> 49:39.680]  Vladimir Putin has come out multiple times in the last six months at press conferences
[49:39.680 --> 49:45.040]  and warned the world that the West, under the guise of missile defense systems, is moving
[49:45.040 --> 49:50.560]  offensive nuclear weapons up to the border with Russia.
[49:50.560 --> 49:52.600]  I study the facts.
[49:52.600 --> 49:59.840]  I know that two years ago, George Soros bragged on CNN that he had the major part with the
[49:59.840 --> 50:03.960]  State Department in overthrowing the elected government of Ukraine.
[50:03.960 --> 50:09.960]  First on Ukraine, one of the things that many people recognized about you was that you,
[50:09.960 --> 50:16.320]  during the revolutions of 1989, funded a lot of dissident activities, civil society groups
[50:16.320 --> 50:19.200]  in Eastern Europe and Poland, the Czech Republic.
[50:19.200 --> 50:21.600]  Are you doing similar things in Ukraine?
[50:21.600 --> 50:30.280]  Well, I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia.
[50:30.280 --> 50:38.000]  And the foundation has been functioning ever since, and played an important part in events
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  now.
[50:39.000 --> 50:45.600]  Now, in the eastern area of Ukraine that has always been part of Russia, the Crimea, it
[50:45.600 --> 50:48.000]  means the border in Russian.
[50:48.000 --> 50:56.280]  We have proxy armies of NATO battling Russian troops, and the Russian losses have been high.
[50:56.280 --> 51:00.080]  Just last week, Vladimir Putin came out in a press conference and pointed out that Kiev
[51:00.080 --> 51:05.720]  is launching basically asymmetrical attacks, or what he called terrorism.
[51:05.720 --> 51:10.680]  And whether you support Russia or Putin or don't, or whether you're just neutral, it
[51:10.680 --> 51:14.480]  should be a major news item here in the United States.
[51:14.480 --> 51:17.280]  Here's a segment of that news conference.
[51:17.280 --> 51:22.800]  It is true that our special forces have foiled an attempt by a group of sabotage infiltrators
[51:22.800 --> 51:28.320]  belonging to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's intelligence agency, who are seeking to penetrate
[51:28.320 --> 51:30.320]  the Crimean territory.
[51:30.320 --> 51:36.520]  And in view of these events, it has become pointless to meet with the Ukraine's current
[51:36.520 --> 51:39.640]  authorities at the Normandy format.
[51:39.640 --> 51:43.040]  We have suffered losses as a result of this operation.
[51:43.040 --> 51:47.720]  We undoubtedly cannot turn a blind eye to the deaths of our servicemen.
[51:47.720 --> 51:52.520]  But I would also like to address our American and European partners.
[51:52.520 --> 51:57.520]  I think today it has become obvious for everyone that Kiev's current authorities are not seeking
[51:57.520 --> 52:04.000]  ways to solve problems through negotiations, but have turned to terrorism instead.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.280]  This is a highly troubling development.
[52:07.280 --> 52:13.240]  There are no other reasons for conducting such actions other than to distract the Ukrainian
[52:13.240 --> 52:20.160]  people, and divert their attention from the disastrous economic situation, and the miserable
[52:20.160 --> 52:23.160]  conditions most of them are living in.
[52:23.160 --> 52:28.840]  And here we are, two years after George Soros and the State Department brag that they overthrew
[52:28.840 --> 52:30.920]  the elected government of Ukraine.
[52:30.920 --> 52:36.480]  And now as NATO and Western forces mass on the Russian border, and as Russia puts 40,000
[52:36.480 --> 52:42.080]  troops on its border, and goes on high alert, and as Putin says, no more detente, no more
[52:42.080 --> 52:48.840]  talk with Ukraine, you are attacking Russian citizens in your east, zero coverage here
[52:48.840 --> 52:54.520]  in our media, unless there's stories saying that I'm a Russian agent, or that info wars
[52:54.520 --> 52:57.280]  or Donald Trump have sold out to Putin.
[52:57.280 --> 53:03.120]  No, we've sold out to common sense and decency, and not having a nuclear war.
[53:03.120 --> 53:08.240]  And I see the emails that come in, and the comments on info wars, by a vocal minority
[53:08.240 --> 53:13.000]  saying that I'm a fear monger because I'm concerned about global conflict.
[53:13.000 --> 53:17.720]  Yes, I'm concerned about the West funding al-Qaeda and ISIS to take over the Middle
[53:17.720 --> 53:19.240]  East and North Africa.
[53:19.240 --> 53:26.920]  I'm upset about our governments creating thousands of trillions of dollars of fake derivatives
[53:26.920 --> 53:28.720]  to buy up the world.
[53:28.720 --> 53:33.520]  I'm concerned about the Clinton Foundation taking money from third world dictators and
[53:33.520 --> 53:38.320]  Middle Eastern governments that oppress women and homosexuals.
[53:38.320 --> 53:44.240]  I'm concerned about the laissez-faire attitude of our elites, but I'm even more concerned
[53:44.240 --> 53:46.600]  about the general population.
[53:46.600 --> 53:50.520]  Because I've had people that I know personally say to me, Alex, we've been hearing about
[53:50.520 --> 53:57.240]  nuclear war since the 1960s, it's fear mongering, it's never going to happen.
[53:57.240 --> 54:01.360]  And the New York Times makes jokes about fear porn.
[54:01.360 --> 54:07.040]  We have the power to destroy life on this planet many times over.
[54:07.040 --> 54:11.480]  We have Promethean fire that will either take us to the stars or turn this whole planet
[54:11.480 --> 54:13.400]  into a giant tombstone.
[54:13.400 --> 54:14.920]  I have three children.
[54:14.920 --> 54:16.360]  I study geopolitics.
[54:16.360 --> 54:19.000]  I'm involved in trying to build a better world.
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.560]  I want peace with Russia and China.
[54:21.560 --> 54:22.960]  I don't want war.
[54:22.960 --> 54:27.080]  And I see our very elites that tell us, don't worry about war, be in the ones that gave
[54:27.080 --> 54:31.720]  the nuclear reactors in North Korea so they could create atomic bombs, and who gave the
[54:31.720 --> 54:37.360]  missile secrets for ICBMs to China in the 1990s.
[54:37.360 --> 54:41.880]  The very people telling us, don't worry about all this are the very ones that are pushing
[54:41.880 --> 54:48.160]  our world towards the brink of extinction and not just for humanity.
[54:48.160 --> 54:53.120]  We've seen the Hague recently rule against the Chinese in the South China Sea, and we've
[54:53.120 --> 54:59.600]  seen China go into a very belligerent tone threatening war with the world.
[54:59.600 --> 55:03.960]  Whether you support the Communist Chinese or don't, I'm sitting here as an American
[55:03.960 --> 55:10.400]  patriot pointing out that we have aircraft carriers and fleets openly lined up against
[55:10.400 --> 55:15.800]  Chinese ships in the South China Sea in the last two months with the people's daily and
[55:15.800 --> 55:23.480]  the president of China saying war with the United States is imminent.
[55:23.480 --> 55:30.560]  And there's a thousand times more news, literally, about some American athlete in South America
[55:30.560 --> 55:34.000]  at the Olympics who might have lied about being robbed.
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.200]  That's the big story and not this.
[55:37.200 --> 55:42.000]  WorldNet Daily is reporting that $6 plus trillion is missing from the Pentagon.
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.360]  The last time CBS News reported the day before 9-11 that two trillion was missing, you saw
[55:46.360 --> 55:47.360]  what happened.
[55:47.360 --> 55:49.240]  And that's just the beginning of what I'm talking about.
[55:49.240 --> 55:54.280]  The elite is all basically running to armored fortresses and redoubts in New Zealand.
[55:54.280 --> 55:55.360]  They're going underground.
[55:55.360 --> 55:56.360]  It's admitted.
[55:56.360 --> 56:01.200]  They're building huge walls from Hillary's Palace to Zuckerberg's around their houses.
[56:01.200 --> 56:03.200]  They're acting like it's the end of the world.
[56:03.200 --> 56:07.360]  While telling us, don't worry about it, there's a conspiracy theory if you even talk about
[56:07.360 --> 56:11.600]  Putin discussing nuclear war.
[56:11.600 --> 56:13.840]  These are crazy times to be alive.
[56:13.840 --> 56:19.360]  And I'm simply here ringing the alarm bell saying, we've gotten by without a nuclear
[56:19.360 --> 56:22.760]  war so far and we're very close to one right now.
[56:22.760 --> 56:28.000]  Let's have a debate about this instead of whether or not somebody on the Olympic team
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.360]  lied about being assaulted.
[56:30.360 --> 56:33.600]  Let's force real issues out there in the open.
[56:33.600 --> 56:41.000]  I'm Alex Jones asking all of you to think about the facts, to weigh the evidence, and
[56:41.000 --> 56:47.480]  to decide, is having 50,000 nuclear weapons on this planet safe?
[56:47.480 --> 56:50.880]  Is massing troops on the Russian border a good idea?
[56:50.880 --> 56:56.040]  Is funding ISIS and al-Qaeda a good idea?
[56:56.040 --> 57:01.120]  The decision is up to all of us, and we should have a serious debate about it.
[57:01.120 --> 57:06.240]  The globalists don't want that debate to happen, but we're here to force that debate front
[57:06.240 --> 57:10.920]  and center, just like we've done about election fraud, just like we've done about GMO.
[57:10.920 --> 57:14.880]  Just like we've done about our government funding ISIS on every front, in full wars
[57:14.880 --> 57:19.000]  at the tip of the spear, because we have 28 million viewers and listeners, just like
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.240]  you, that are awake and who are involved.
[57:23.240 --> 57:51.280]  So my friends, it's time to take action and to stop a new world war.
[57:51.280 --> 58:03.920]  I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off, coaching basketball, I get in
[58:03.920 --> 58:08.280]  here at 8.30, I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was going
[58:08.280 --> 58:11.920]  to make it, and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview, I got my bottle of brain
[58:11.920 --> 58:16.160]  force right there, I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later, it's like, everything
[58:16.160 --> 58:17.840]  just kind of clears up.
[58:17.840 --> 58:22.360]  It's got four and a half stars, people really love it, read about it, find out why third
[58:22.360 --> 58:27.120]  party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it really does have the best
[58:27.120 --> 58:30.520]  organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[58:30.520 --> 58:33.320]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have
[58:33.320 --> 58:34.560]  done it without brain force.
[58:34.560 --> 58:39.480]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain
[58:39.480 --> 58:40.800]  force and came in.
[58:40.800 --> 58:49.520]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[58:49.520 --> 58:55.400]  Dr. Group, you developed living defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[58:55.400 --> 58:57.120]  Why is this so good?
[58:57.120 --> 59:01.800]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[59:01.800 --> 59:06.440]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[59:06.440 --> 59:12.160]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[59:12.160 --> 59:15.480]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[59:15.480 --> 59:20.600]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[59:20.600 --> 59:21.840]  going on everywhere.
[59:21.840 --> 59:22.840]  These are all parasites.
[59:22.840 --> 59:25.560]  Tell us about all the stuff I said, there's so many things that are in it.
[59:25.560 --> 59:29.880]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[59:29.880 --> 59:33.280]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[59:33.280 --> 59:36.360]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[59:36.360 --> 59:40.320]  It just came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com and folks, you can't lose
[59:40.320 --> 59:43.200]  full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[59:43.200 --> 59:46.480]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[59:46.480 --> 59:48.680]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[59:48.680 --> 59:59.560]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[59:59.560 --> 01:00:09.640]  We've got it.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.640]  We're coming to you.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.640]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:20.560]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:24.840]  On Friday's broadcast, you're tuning in to the Sunday Transmission, the fourth day of
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.840]  September 2016.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:31.760]  On Friday's broadcast, we talked a lot about how the info war has broken through and is
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:37.040]  putting out counter narratives in the establishment of this information, but it really hit me
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:45.640]  in the last few hours that it really is you, the listeners that hit the zeitgeist.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:51.440]  Info wars was only one focal point of a media organization who saw what was coming, understood
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:56.360]  what happened, and did want to go along with it, so we built it and you came.
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.360]  I mean, it's so important.
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:01.440]  I don't mean this in a patronizing way, but in a very, very serious way.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.080]  Understand, you're the eyes and ears of the real media.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.040]  The globalists destroyed our old media, so we're not the alternative media.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.400]  We are the real media.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:18.120]  And we are the teleprompter free, open, free flow of information media that the globalists
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.800]  just can't counter.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.240]  And that's why they want to shut us down and shut down Drudge Report and Breitbart and
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:27.360]  others is because they want to shut you down.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:30.240]  You already think and believe, understand these basic facts.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.320]  You're the ones reporting it to us most of the time.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.320]  You're the leakers.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.320]  You're the sources.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.320]  You're the information.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.480]  But they don't want you to have a sounding board to be able to bounce information off
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:48.680]  of to realize that what you say and what you do and what you stand for actually has value.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.680]  Globalism is dehumanization.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.840]  Globalism is a system that's meant to bring in dehumanization.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.760]  And it wants you to feel alone.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:07.120]  No family, no tribe, no kinship, no independent organization that's based on true human values.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.960]  They want you all alone, like an inner city child who doesn't have a mother or father
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:16.280]  who gets taken over by a gang and will do horrible things because they believe that
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.280]  gang is their family.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.840]  What the New World Order is, it's what political correctness is.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:26.920]  It's all trying to arrest development, control people, make them be totally alone and then
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:34.120]  sell them horrible globalist agendas as something that's supposedly going to fulfill them.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.120]  That ladies and gentlemen is what the New World Order is.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:41.200]  It's what it stands for and it's what it's always going to be about.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.720]  It is about enslavement.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.440]  It is about not believing in you.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:49.480]  It is about dumbing the message down and thinking you're stupid.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.840]  You can say what you want about Donald Trump.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.640]  He is taking the globalist on.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.560]  He is taking the New World Order on.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.840]  He is talking to you like you're smart.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:00.520]  He is going down to Mexico and saying we're all being screwed over by globalism.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.720]  Let's come together.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.720]  He is pushing detente with Russia.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:07.760]  That's what the media says he's trying to start World War III while Hillary threatens
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.880]  war with Russia.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:15.040]  Donald Trump is the Newtonian physics response to the great tyranny and the interdimensional
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.560]  gravity of corruption and oppression.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:25.640]  He is the manifestation of the people's will and the collective unconscious wanting to resist.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:31.480]  Trump is only the first of many people that are going to manifest through the powerful
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:34.680]  human system to resist the New World Order.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:40.160]  Info wars is only one part of that as well and if we realize these metaphysical rules,
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:46.120]  if we realize what's happening, what's unfolding, what's taking place, there's no way the globalist
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:51.800]  could ever put this genie back in the bottle.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:52.800]  So make no mistake.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.920]  I talk about a lot of really big things happening, a lot of amazing things happening and that's
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.280]  because big things and incredible things are happening.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.280]  History is happening now.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.240]  We're in a world of wonder.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:08.640]  Being the social engineers engaged in is about making you not see the magic and the wonder
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:14.040]  of the universe and feeling empty and then only looking to the television and PR and
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:19.440]  Madison Avenue and the different disinformation agents for fulfillment.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.920]  They want you bought into their Hollywood system believing that you're inadequate because
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:28.240]  you're not some narcissistic woman or some guy that looks like a Superman.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.780]  Again, they pick the image of a woman that maybe one out of 500 women look like so you
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:38.040]  feel inadequate and bad and never feel like you're fulfilled and beautiful because you
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.440]  have lovely curves or voluptuous.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:46.000]  That's just one microcosm of how they operate and I'm here to tell you that there is no
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.480]  utopia we're offering but hell is where the globalists are leading us.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.480]  We'll be back.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:58.480]  Big second hour ladies and gentlemen with the Trump speech, Hillary's trail of death,
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.720]  billion dollar baby, ISIS supreme commanders Hillary Clinton and more.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:06.360]  Introducing vitamin mineral fusion from infowarslife.com.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.360]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.840]  and affordable great tasting multivitamin formula available.

[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.160]  shield x2, supermail vitality and so many others.
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:38.040]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:42.800]  system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:47.160]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:52.560]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.320]  quality lab standard.
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:55.760]  That means it's clean.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.760]  That means it's pure.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:59.840]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:20.880]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:27.040]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:35.400]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday Worldwide Broadcast.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:41.520]  I want to first go to the incredible speech Donald Trump gave last week in Mexico about
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:46.760]  unity but also sovereignty and standing up against multinational globalists that are
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:52.920]  coming in and taking over our nation states and really setting up systems of financial
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:53.920]  oppression.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.160]  This is a really powerful speech.
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:01.240]  The U.S. media captured by the globalists really tried to demonize it, kind of take
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.520]  it out of context.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:16.760]  So here is a speech unedited of Donald Trump in Mexico.
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:20.720]  There's now here the words of the Republican candidate to the presidency of the United
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.800]  States of America, Mr. Donald Trump.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:25.800]  Thank you.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:31.560]  It is a great honor to be invited by you, Mr. President, a great, great honor.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.600]  Thank you.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:44.520]  We had a very substantive, direct and constructive exchange of ideas over quite a period of time.
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:52.840]  I was straightforward in presenting my views about the impacts of current trade and immigration
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.480]  policies on the United States.
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:02.840]  As you know, I love the United States very much and we want to make sure that the people
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:06.640]  of the United States are very well protected.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:12.520]  You equally expressed your feelings and your love for Mexico.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:19.800]  The United States and Mexico share a 2,000 mile border, a half a trillion dollars in
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:27.680]  annual trade and one million legal border crossings each and every day.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:35.440]  We are united by our support for democracy, a great love for our people and the contributions
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:41.440]  of millions of Mexican Americans to the United States.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:47.720]  And I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican Americans, not only in terms of
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:53.080]  friendships, but in terms of the tremendous numbers that I employ in the United States
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:56.320]  and they are amazing people, amazing people.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:01.960]  I have many friends, so many friends and so many friends coming to Mexico and in Mexico.
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:09.600]  I am proud to say how many people I employ and the United States first, second and third
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:20.360]  generation Mexicans are just beyond reproach, spectacular, spectacular hardworking people.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:29.080]  I have such great respect for them and their strong values of family, faith and community.
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:38.300]  We all share a common interest in keeping our hemisphere safe, prosperous and free.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:48.240]  No one wins in either country when human smugglers and drug traffickers prey on innocent people,
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:55.000]  when cartels commit acts of violence, when illegal weapons and cash flow from the United
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:02.360]  States into Mexico, or when migrants from Central America make the dangerous trek and
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:12.200]  it is very, very dangerous into Mexico or the United States without legal authorization.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:19.760]  I shared my strong view that NAFTA has been a far greater benefit to Mexico than it has
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:26.760]  been to the United States and that it must be improved upon to make sure that workers
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:34.560]  and so important in both countries benefit from fair and reciprocal trade.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:41.320]  I expressed that to the United States and that of the United States that we must take
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:49.320]  action to stem this tremendous outflow of jobs from our country.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:57.120]  It's happening every day, it's getting worse and worse and worse and we have to stop it.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:03.640]  Prosperity and happiness in both of our countries will increase if we work together on the following
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.480]  five shared goals.
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:12.640]  Number one, ending illegal immigration.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:18.200]  Not just between our two countries, but including the illegal immigration and migration from
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:24.860]  Central and South Americans and from other regions that impact security and finances
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:30.200]  in both Mexico and the United States.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.360]  This is a humanitarian disaster.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:43.000]  The dangerous treks, the abuse by gangs and cartels and the extreme physical dangers and
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.960]  it must be solved, it must be solved quickly.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:55.080]  Not fair to the people anywhere, worldwide you can truly say, but certainly not fair
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:59.040]  to the people of Mexico or the people of the United States.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:05.840]  Number two, having a secure border is a sovereign right and mutually beneficial.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:13.720]  We recognize and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:22.320]  on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, drugs and weapons.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:29.720]  Cooperation toward achieving this shared objective and it will be shared of safety for all citizens
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:36.160]  is paramount to both the United States and to Mexico.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:42.520]  Number three, dismantling drug cartels and ending the movement of illegal drugs, weapons
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:47.440]  and funds across our border.
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:57.020]  This can only be done with cooperation, intelligence and intelligence sharing and joint operations
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:13:02.720]  between our two countries, it's the only way it's going to happen.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:10.800]  Improving NAFTA, number four, NAFTA is a 22-year-old agreement that must be updated to reflect
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.400]  the realities of today.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:19.280]  There are many improvements that could be made that would make both Mexico and the United
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:25.460]  States stronger and keep industry in our hemisphere.
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:31.400]  We have tremendous competition from China and from all over the world.
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.760]  Keep it in our hemisphere.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:41.160]  Workers in both of our countries need a pay raise very desperately in the United States.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:48.360]  It's been 18 years, 18 years wages are going down.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:54.720]  Improving pay standards and working conditions will create better results for all and all
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:57.040]  workers in particular.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:04.120]  There's a lot of value that can be created for both countries by working beautifully
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:08.680]  together and that I am sure will happen.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:15.520]  Number five, keep manufacturing wealth in our hemisphere.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:22.920]  When jobs leave Mexico, the U.S. or Central America and go overseas, it increases poverty
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:32.600]  and pressure on social services as well as pressures on cross-border migration.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.000]  Tremendous pressure.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.640]  The bond between our two countries is deep and sincere and both our nations benefit from
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:47.080]  a close and honest relationship between our two governments.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:54.000]  A strong, prosperous and vibrant Mexico is in the best interests of the United States
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:03.040]  and will keep and help keep for a long, long period of time America together.
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:09.560]  Both of our countries will work together for mutual good and most importantly for the mutual
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.800]  good of our people.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:18.880]  Mr. President, I want to thank you, this has been a tremendous honor and I call you a friend.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.880]  Thank you.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:20.880]  Thank you.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:28.160]  Now we are introducing a new t-shirt which I think folks need to get at telling the real
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:33.160]  truth about Bill Clinton who is a serial rapist and a user of women.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:37.480]  In another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will and rape
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.480]  and rape.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.480]  Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.480]  He's a rapist.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.480]  Absolutely.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:45.480]  He's a public figure.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.480]  He goes straight to hell.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:16:01.080]  Get your Bill Clinton rape shirt today at infostore.com or call 1-800-253-3139.
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:07.000]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.760]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:14.240]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.440]  it's very, very important.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:23.080]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.320]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.440]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.760]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.640]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.320]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.200]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.360]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.360]  It's in powder form.
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.080]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.080]  I take this.
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.960]  This is the product that I take.
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.960]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make, we fight the global, we fight the new world
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:53.960]  order.

[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.760]  Dr. Grip, you developed living defense for us.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.160]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.880]  Why is this so good?
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:10.480]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:15.200]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.200]  my system.
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:21.440]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:24.240]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:29.320]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.600]  going on everywhere.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:31.600]  These are all parasites.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:34.320]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said that there's so many things that are in it.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.560]  You have the neem in there.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.640]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.920]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:42.920]  All right.
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:45.120]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:48.120]  It just came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.120]  And folks, you can't lose.

[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:35.440]  Customers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder

[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:01.520]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:05.320]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side and as many of you
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.640]  know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.280]  You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in health
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.920]  care nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer,
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.960]  heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:24.240]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:27.400]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.080]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:34.040]  your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:38.600]  nutritional raw materials into your day to day lives to guarantee that your body is getting

[01:19:52.600 --> 01:20:05.720]  Your body will be very grateful on the web at infowarsteam.com, that's infowarsteam.com.
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:16.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.240]  We are on the march.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.320]  The empire is on the run.
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:43.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:48.000]  The presidential election process is beginning to reek of corruption.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.640]  Homeland Security Chief Jay Johnson recently determined that our election process should
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:57.200]  be overseen by the Department of Homeland Security because it has been dubbed critical
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.960]  infrastructure, akin to the financial sector and the power grid.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:06.640]  Truth be told, Mr. Johnson, this election is critical to the total emergence of a totalitarian
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:10.240]  new world order that has almost crossed the finish line.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:15.320]  Meanwhile, a desperate scythe to spin Hillary into the Oval Office is fully underway, as
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:21.520]  Matt Lauer will host a propagandized non-debate, whereas the Daily Color reports it will be
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:27.040]  a one-hour forum where Clinton and Trump will answer questions about national security, military
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:32.040]  affairs and veterans' issues in front of an audience mainly made up of members of the
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.040]  military.
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:38.840]  The two candidates will not be on the stage at the same time, but will instead go back
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:44.520]  to back, this after Trump dominated the last 48-hour news cycle with true presidential
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.520]  aplomb.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:53.600]  We are united by our support for democracy, a great love for our people, and the contributions
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:58.840]  of millions of Mexican-Americans to the United States.
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:10.160]  We agreed on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns and people
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:17.040]  across our border and to put the cartels out of business.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:25.920]  We are going to uphold the laws of the nation and defend our sovereignty and security, and
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.800]  we are going to defend our border.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:33.840]  And now with Hillary sinking in the polls as Rasmussen reports, Hillary Clinton's post-convention
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:38.360]  lead has disappeared, putting her behind Donald Trump for the first time nationally since
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:39.360]  mid-July.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:43.760]  The latest weekly Rasmussen reports, White House Watch National Telephone and Online
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:51.160]  Survey shows Trump with 40% support to Clinton's 39% among likely U.S. voters, after Clinton
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:54.600]  led 42% to 38% a week ago.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:58.840]  As a result, the globalist empire is fiercely striking back.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:05.640]  It certainly takes more than trying to make up for a year of insults and insinuations by
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:10.600]  dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again.
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.960]  That is not how it works.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:17.280]  It's like anthrax dormant in our soil.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:22.840]  We are a nation of immigrants who turn on immigrants as scapegoats when normal politics
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.400]  doesn't work anymore.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:30.240]  And so when the wind's just right and the host is weak, just wait.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:35.680]  To blame the immigrants' nativism that is always around at some level, it comes back.
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:37.720]  It comes out of the secret societies.
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.840]  It comes roaring out, once again, out of the dark.
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.320]  I think it was kind of a diplomatic embarrassment.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:47.320]  We'll get to his speech later, but he's been talking for a year about we're going to build
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.600]  a wall and Mexico's going to pay for it.
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:54.440]  And then he goes and he sits down and he goes eyeball to eyeball with the president of Mexico.
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:59.040]  And what, he forgets suddenly to bring it up or he's too afraid to bring it up?
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:05.120]  When riding on the coattails of the SIA, trolls upon trolls echoing half-baked disinformation
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:09.840]  in an effort to chip away Trump's emerging bold domination of the real issues.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:14.600]  The Daily Caller reports, liberals did not like Donald Trump's immigration speech in
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:15.600]  Arizona.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:19.760]  Some even attacked the angel moms, parents whose children have been killed by illegal
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:20.760]  immigrants.
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:25.400]  Mark McKinnon wrote, Trump's surrounded on Phoenix stage by angel moms who say their
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.760]  kids were murdered by illegal immigrants.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:29.880]  This is pretty much a hate rally.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:34.880]  Joy Reed wrote, the way they call people illegals, so dehumanizing.
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:40.240]  The mainstream media and true gobel zeal even blurred out Trump's name in an interview
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.120]  with a man who recently rescued a baby from a hot car.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:50.800]  Again, propaganda was legalized in America in 2013 with the death of the Smith-Mont Act.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:57.720]  With the only rational explanation one could surmise to be used on the American people.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:02.880]  propaganda is running wild, ladies and gentlemen, and a cabal of impetuous globalists are pushing
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:15.600]  their narrative into overdrive.
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.440]  Much ado about Hillary.
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.240]  Heat Street reported, Hillary has been using pillows at every appearance to prop herself
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.240]  up.
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:28.680]  Truly, the media spin cycle of her scandalous path of deviation in the face of the justice
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:32.880]  system that has propped up Hillary's presidential aspirations.
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.560]  How so, you ask?
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:40.720]  Because if Hillary's true criminal modus operandi was examined by a legitimate investigative
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.520]  media, the dead bodies stuck in Hillary's web would be front and center.
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.960]  And that trail of the dead is a long one.
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:54.880]  Vince Foster, Mary Mahoney, Judy Gibbs, Walter Scheid, Charles Ruff, Jim McDougal, Admiral
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:26:01.280]  Borda, Barry Steele, Michael Hastings, Sandy Hume, Gareth Williams are just a few of the
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.600]  ghosts in the Clinton's past.
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:08.480]  But now fresh blood is being spilled with auspicious intentions regarding the Clinton
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.480]  campaign.
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:16.280]  June 22, 2016, UN official John Ash was murdered in a bizarre weightlifting incident while
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:21.840]  facing a trial for taking bribes from Clinton-tied Chinese billionaire David Ng.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:28.720]  July 10, 2016, Seth Rich, DNC voter expansion data director was murdered in Washington,
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:34.560]  D.C. after possibly being tied to the massive email leak that upended the DNC.
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:41.000]  July 25, 2016, former DNC chairman Joe Montano died of a supposed heart attack.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:47.240]  August 1, 2016, author Victor Thorn shot near his home after writing a slew of books exposing
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:48.920]  the Clinton crime family.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:55.680]  August 2, 2016, Sean Lucas died mysteriously after serving a frog-class action suit against
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:57.080]  the Democratic Party.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:02.280]  Poll numbers from Zogby Analytics now show that Hillary and Trump are neck and neck.
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:07.480]  Meanwhile, America's most trusted physician, Dr. Drew, raises legitimate concerns over
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:34.360]  Hillary's health.
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:39.320]  In Republicans of the House, motion to file perjury charges against Hillary after FBI
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:44.400]  director James Comey contradicted Hillary's claims of innocence regarding the handling
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.080]  of classified material.
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:51.240]  There was nothing marked classified on my emails, either sent or received.
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:55.000]  Nothing was marked classified at the time I sent or received it.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.720]  I think it's also important to say something about the marking of classified information.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:05.080]  Only a very small number of the emails here containing classified information bore markings
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.520]  that indicated the presence of classified information.
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:14.360]  But even if information is not marked classified in an email, participants who know or should
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:19.160]  know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:24.600]  When he was very careful, the director, Comey, said that she didn't lie to them.
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.760]  But you know, the public comments are one area.
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:30.320]  But when you lie under oath, that's a whole nother level, and I was trying to get there
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:33.320]  because I wanted to know if that went towards her intent.
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:38.920]  However, these are the kind of pressures Hillary Clinton can endure, because after decades
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.440]  of lying to Congress, it all begins to run together.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.520]  In the very near future, once the smoke clears, Hillary Clinton's race to the halls of the
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:52.840]  hijacked, corporate-cratic throne of the United States will go down in history as the most
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.920]  bizarre political act of the 21st century.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:01.240]  Who else will ever be able to match the amount of minor corruption that was used as cover
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:07.040]  by a bought-and-paid-for media, ignoring the major crimes that threatened Hillary's political
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.360]  ambitions every step of the way?
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:38.080]  John Bowne.
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:44.800]  B12 is a binary of nutrimental grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin, the
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:49.040]  same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:52.400]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.480]  No needles, no injections.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.040]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.480]  Try it for yourself.
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:58.640]  Discover the secret.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:29:59.640]  Secret 12.

[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.960]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:29.960]  products.

[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.120]  Right.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.120]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:44.120]  Have they worked for you?
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:46.760]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:47.760]  What products are you taking?
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:48.760]  Are you taking?
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:54.200]  Everything from, uh, supermale to, uh, brain force to winter sun, uh, X2.
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:58.600]  Even got a little, uh, DNA force, so when I just re-upped everything, and I just went
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:31:59.600]  to auto-built.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:04.800]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:14.080]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:27.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:33.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:48.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.400]  It's called augmented reality.
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:56.920]  I thought humans interfacing with this incredible third dimension, having sight, having smell,
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:01.560]  having taste, having touch, having emotions, and feelings inside our hearts.
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:03.760]  I thought that was augmented reality.
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:06.560]  I thought that was consciousness.
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:11.880]  But now we're told it's the number one search, five, six days running, Pokemon Go.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:16.760]  In fact, some of the amazing crew members at our own office are playing it.
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:20.120]  And I'm not judging them for checking out something new and interesting.
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:23.480]  My kids have played Pokemon, you know, the card game years ago.
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:25.840]  You have these little monsters that you play against each other.
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:30.320]  You've got to go find the monsters, capture them, train them, all the rest of it, whatever.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:33.920]  Board games have been around, chess games have been around three, four thousand years.
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:35.440]  That's great.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:42.120]  The problem is that we see more and more people living in second life, buying Ferraris with
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:48.720]  real money that don't really exist, forming fake relationships in cyberspace, and becoming
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:51.920]  very unsuccessful in the real world.
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:57.360]  And we see the social engineers pushing as hard as they can to get people to tune out
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:04.200]  of the real world this incredible planet hurtling through space and our amazing moon and all
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:11.240]  the other things that are happening on our planet and dial into artificial systems created
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:18.800]  by Nintendo or by Microsoft or by Google or by Apple.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:27.160]  They are creating the universes in which we interface instead of humans living in the
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:32.640]  real universe and being creative sentient beings yourself.
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:40.680]  They are building false realities into which they want to induct you so they can play God.
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:46.640]  So I'm not saying anybody's bad who wants to play video games or who wants to be involved
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:49.680]  in a world of warcraft or any of that.
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:56.080]  All I'm saying is the metrics are there, our IQs are dropping, the screen time is lowering
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:04.760]  our IQs, our synapses are collapsing, humanity is in crisis, and Pokemon Go is illustrating
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:06.880]  my own fact.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:12.000]  Ambulance drivers, EMTs across not just the U.S. but the world are saying that suddenly
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.320]  because there's augmented reality, kids that have never been outside their house that's
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:22.080]  been less time on average than prisoners do outside are suddenly out in the real world
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:26.800]  looking for these mythical monsters so they can show off for their friends and collect
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:27.800]  more.
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:32.440]  So in a way the matrix is actually backfiring on itself as it attempts to go out and take
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:34.480]  over reality.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:37.760]  That's what Microsoft and others have said they want for decades is to have every real
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:42.560]  area of the world with this whole data list and this whole information cube around it
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:44.600]  to track what you do.
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:50.360]  In a way it's actually backfiring as people go out into the real world themselves looking
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:51.720]  for the false reality.
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:58.440]  But I can't get over the image of brain dead zombies that we see on TV walking looking
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:01.880]  at their phones going into traffic.
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:07.600]  I can't help but think about the images of people that walk into fountains at malls or
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:13.440]  that drive off cliffs while they're watching their GPFs or drive into raging rivers because
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:17.600]  they're making this their entire consciousness.
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:23.960]  I mean I'm out here supposedly at a nearby golf course looking for one of these Pockimons
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:28.760]  and I'm told that it's magically laid some eggs about a hundred yards over there and
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:32.840]  then I can go over there and watch it hatch and capture it for myself.
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:36.520]  But in truth it's not really there it's being geo-located.
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:40.520]  I'm being tracked everything I'm doing by the way by the SAP it's been hacking millions
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:45.560]  of people's phones and I'm now feeding this data to the matrix of where I am and what
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:51.920]  I'm doing to find some mythical projection that it's shooting onto my phone.
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:58.160]  Again this is giving all of my personal privacy all of my personal power over to Nintendo to
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:02.760]  sell my habits to sell my behaviors to sell my data to whoever they want.
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:09.400]  The studies don't lie this dehumanizes you this ends up destroying your humanity in the
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.280]  final equation.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:16.280]  If you use it in limited amounts sure it's interesting you can meet like-minded people
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:21.600]  that are into it I'm not judging anybody Lord knows I'm just simply pointing out we should
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:29.280]  ask ourselves why Pockimon has been more popular the last five six days than porn.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.800]  When I heard that the British exit from the Euro was more popular than porn the only thing
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:37.280]  in years to beat that I was proud of the people.
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:44.760]  My globalism is number one even above simulated procreation but the truth is porn is just
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:51.760]  like this it's simulated it isn't real you're living through somebody else's template somebody
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:57.680]  else's intercourse somebody else's activities that are then edited and presented and sold
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:04.600]  to you so while they live you sleep and that's all I'm saying.
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:10.400]  Every study every piece of research shows it that forest bathing and getting outdoors
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:15.840]  and being in the open air and looking up at the sky raises your awareness raises your
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:21.920]  IQ getting in the wind feeling the reality seeing the birds fly around in the air but
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:28.960]  I tell you it is sacrilege to the gamers and sacrilege to the TV heads who you get around
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:32.360]  and they don't talk about what's happening in the world they don't talk about what they're
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:35.960]  doing with men or women they don't talk about what they're doing with art they don't talk
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:40.720]  about hiking or camping trips they're going on they don't care about their work they don't
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:46.120]  care about the world they're cynical and don't care about the new world order on average
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:50.960]  all they want to do is live in their fantasy land and I for one am sick and tired of that
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:56.080]  and I'm reaching into those people that are living in false worlds built by other people
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:01.160]  built by these gaming companies that make billions of dollars off of you that this is the ultimate
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:06.640]  form of slavery and let me be clear a lot of the big game companies are patriots a lot
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:10.760]  of the big game companies are listeners of mine my god I've been like eight or nine big
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:15.520]  video games over the years I've signed contracts and let them use my voice or image and there's
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:19.720]  a lot of good messages in video games just like movies just like TV but there's some
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:25.560]  bad messages and the globalists are basically pushing this because they don't want you to
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:35.360]  be involved in the real world look it is kind of fun I'm gonna admit it to just not look
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:40.480]  at the sunset over there and not look at the sky or the moon and just start looking at
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:45.280]  this it's so much fun it's so neat why don't that there's eggs over there there's there's
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:49.880]  something there's something there's something hatching actually this is pretty cool guys
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:57.280]  I'm into this over there it's oh my god oh my god I just found a new can't you see it
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:01.280]  over there it's right there and now I can see it for myself ladies and gentlemen right
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:09.280]  there Trigly Puff is the newest Pokemon it's given birth Trigly Puff is giving birth Trigly
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:16.120]  Puff is giving birth to a baby to a baby Darth Vader it's my own fantasy land I don't have
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:20.640]  to actually affect change the real world I can just believe whatever I want to be a star
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:33.920]  here oh my god I've actually changed my mind now that I'm in the matrix don't look outside
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:40.200]  the television or the internet or the computer only look into this world that's real this
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:48.160]  world this world where you could actually create something isn't real the only world
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:56.280]  that's real is the world where Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and your trusted local professors
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:02.640]  tell you what words you're allowed to use so go back to your dorms and play Pokemon
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:09.440]  go and whatever you do don't hack into Pokemon and actually create your own characters whatever
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:17.600]  you do don't use their own memes and their own systems to wake people up just conform
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:23.880]  and pretend you were never conscious and you were never alive and whatever you do never

[01:48:50.480 --> 01:49:20.160]  ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles it's also what happens when you listen to
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:26.880]  the radio host alex jones who claims that 9 11 and the Oklahoma city bombings were inside
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:36.440]  jobs he even said the victims of the sandy hook massacre were child actors live from

[01:49:54.880 --> 01:50:03.840]  created ices hillary clinton created ices with obama he is becoming ices's best recruiter
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:10.720]  they are going to people showing videos of donald trump insulting islam and muslims in
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:15.880]  order to recruit more radical jihadists hillary clinton would have us all forget about the
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:21.760]  failed regime changes she oversaw in egypt and libya that led up to the stage rollout
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:27.760]  of bangazi as an actual marine sergeant pointed out to bill clinton on the campaign trail back
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:55.760]  in february bangazi now commonly known as a bungled covert operation nothing less than
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:51:02.960]  a cia arms transfer of qaddafi's pilfered arsenal to ices hillary's accusations of trump now
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:09.280]  being somehow responsible for ices are on their face laughable the way donald trump
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:16.280]  talks about terrorism and his you know very insulting language toward muslims is making
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:22.120]  him the recruiting sergeant for ices in january of this year soros dropped eight million dollars
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:27.600]  to boost hillary's sluggish campaign while we are all overwhelmed and diverted by the

[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:43.800]  the bank of england mervin king admitted one month ago when he said that europe's economic
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:51.120]  depression is the result of deliberate policy choices made by e u elites it is also what
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:57.560]  aig bank strategist bernard connelly said back in 2008 when laying out what europe wants
[01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:02.680]  the evidence is staggering as wiki leaks published the transcript of a teleconference
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:08.360]  that took place on march nineteen twenty sixteen between the top two imf officials in charge
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:14.480]  of managing the greek debt crisis paul tomsen the head of imf's european department and
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:21.240]  elia velkulescu the imf mission chief for greece the imf officials say that a threat
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:26.480]  of an imminent financial catastrophe as the guardian puts it is needed to force other
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:33.120]  players into accepting its measures such as cutting greek pensions and working conditions
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:40.280]  or as bloomberg puts it considering a plan to cause a credit event in greece and destabilize
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:46.320]  europe under the banner of the globalist soft war through the terror of isis europe is gradually
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:51.880]  being forced into total submission while many americans bitterly cling to their blind ignorance
[01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:59.560]  in the face of an upcoming storm i see nothing i was not here i did not even get out this
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:06.280]  morning i love your respect the fact is we had four dead americans was it because of
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:10.360]  a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk when i decided they'd go kill some
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:17.000]  americans what difference at this point does it make it is our job to figure out what happened
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:22.080]  and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again senator as isis brigadier
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:26.880]  general hillary clinton lectures the home of the brave and the land of the free the
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:43.400]  average american citizen is genuinely insulted john bound for info wars dot com they said
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:50.120]  in october i'd be dead in six months it's also what happens when you listen to the radio
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:58.480]  host alex jones i don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:08.120]  must be to say things like that we came we saw he died the intervention led by nato to
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:18.880]  topple kadafi has led to a failed state maybe libya was not perfect under kadafi but it had
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:24.440]  even if to some extent a functioning government one unified country it was a sovereign state
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:31.440]  libya now has two rival governments a civil war that has left over 4 000 people dead and
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:38.920]  its cities are ruined i don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:44.600]  must be women are treated discriminated against in all these countries she took money against
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:50.240]  gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely they're mistreated she claims to
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:57.920]  be their champion we let isis take this position it was hillary clinton that she should get
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:03.080]  an award from them as the founder of isis we had this brilliant idea that we were going
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:09.040]  to come to pakistan and create a force of muja hadin equipped them with stinger missiles
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:14.600]  and everything else to go after the soviets inside afghanistan and we were successful in
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:19.200]  this really just is so disgusting when vince foster left his white house office on that
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:25.040]  july day in 1993 he told his secretary that he would be back but the deputy white house
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:30.840]  council and boyhood friend of bill clinton never returned there has been this urgency
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:38.080]  to end this and you know historically that makes no sense we all remember bobby kennedy
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:43.680]  was assassinated in june in california google is being accused of hiding negative stories
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:49.320]  about hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to marry stories like the clinton
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:54.240]  body count story that's according to website info wars if a google user types in clinton
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:59.600]  body they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:03.480]  tied to the clinton's who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:08.640]  decades whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:14.640]  risks we have upcoming leaks in relation to hillary clinton you know the emails we published
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:21.200]  show that hillary clinton is receiving constant updates about my personal situation as a 27
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:27.680]  year old that works for the dnc who was shot in the back murdered just two weeks ago for
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:33.120]  unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in washington i don't know what happens
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:37.280]  in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be
