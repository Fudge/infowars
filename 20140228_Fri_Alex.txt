[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.240 --> 00:28.720]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones I just did a 35 minute
[00:28.720 --> 00:34.480]  taped interview with Tucker Carlson because he got here at 10 o'clock an hour before
[00:34.480 --> 00:38.880]  showtime and we're going to add a lot of video clips and documentation what we talked about
[00:38.880 --> 00:45.280]  it was pretty amazing interview and now he's going to be live in studio with us coming
[00:45.280 --> 00:52.000]  up for the balance of the hour after this first break it is the 28th day of already
[00:52.000 --> 00:59.200]  February the last day of February 2014 I just double-taked on that and we are going to be
[00:59.200 --> 01:07.440]  here for the next three hours and then coming up later in the transmission we also have
[01:07.440 --> 01:12.480]  Joel Scowzen on to talk about the Ukraine situation that's escalating very very fast
[01:12.480 --> 01:17.920]  you know I want to be clear here I don't romanticize Vladimir Putin I don't romanticize the Russians
[01:17.920 --> 01:24.880]  but it's wrong to use al-Qaeda to attack the Syrians and start a war and so Russia was on
[01:24.880 --> 01:28.880]  the right side of that and our own military agreed with that a lot of the republican leadership
[01:28.880 --> 01:35.520]  did it as well as democrats and that stopped and it's wrong with George Soros to go in and start
[01:35.520 --> 01:41.440]  this revolution in Ukraine even though I know the Ukrainians have some real issues with Russian
[01:41.440 --> 01:48.320]  influence in the east I get all that my issue is as George Washington said these foreign
[01:48.320 --> 01:56.880]  entanglements are wrong and we have seen enough of American blood sweat tears and our name being
[01:56.880 --> 02:02.080]  used for corporate interest because if you look at what's happened they've just appointed as the
[02:02.080 --> 02:08.160]  deputy prime minister over there a central banker who's planning to basically loot the country so
[02:08.160 --> 02:14.160]  there's been some neocon attacks on us saying we're putting out pro-russia propaganda and I just
[02:14.160 --> 02:19.520]  want to respond to those people that that's intellectually bankrupt we are against funding
[02:19.520 --> 02:26.960]  al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia to go in and blow up 500 churches or more in Syria preemptively
[02:26.960 --> 02:32.400]  to turn that country over to islamicist now look at iraq much worse than it was
[02:32.400 --> 02:41.520]  countries overrun by jihadis from both camps irans there it's a serious situation and this
[02:41.520 --> 02:46.960]  is not for american interest this is for globalist interest that all of this is going on that's where
[02:46.960 --> 02:54.640]  I stand on this and out of these political wars and economic wars and financial wars we the people
[02:55.200 --> 03:00.400]  end up losing in the final equation and so that's why I'm a libertarian who is against
[03:00.400 --> 03:04.960]  offensive war and offensive meddling in other countries I'd rather deal with people through
[03:04.960 --> 03:12.240]  trade and through soft power something this country had up until the 1960s so that is all
[03:12.240 --> 03:17.680]  coming up today I tell you folks there is just so much news and we're going to be breaking down
[03:17.680 --> 03:26.880]  we're going to be talking about a ton of it with Tucker Carlson coming up but here's a new
[03:26.880 --> 03:36.080]  article out right now Syrian rebels amputate man's hand live and then tweet it and if you
[03:36.080 --> 03:41.840]  look at the flag right there on dredgerport.com you understand that is an al-Qaeda well hobbyist
[03:41.840 --> 03:47.440]  black flag and that is a bin laden brigade flag right there just like you learn what the texas
[03:47.440 --> 03:51.840]  flag looks like or the german flag or the japanese flags japanese flags a white background
[03:51.840 --> 03:58.720]  the red sun rising sun that is a the sum of bin laden brigade flag right there and if you go over
[03:58.720 --> 04:05.440]  here there is a wahhabist flag right there if you're watching us on television so that's the orgy
[04:06.080 --> 04:12.720]  of off the chart insane news that we've got this is out of the uh washington post syrian extremists
[04:12.720 --> 04:18.400]  amputate a man's hand and live tweet it we'll know what they are is al-Qaeda in the al-Qaeda
[04:18.400 --> 04:24.400]  outfits with the al-Qaeda flags that's about 65 percent of the force over there and they are taking
[04:24.400 --> 04:30.480]  over the entire country look at this look at this shot out of the washington post where they are
[04:30.480 --> 04:36.480]  chopping his hand off live on television they're putting burkas on the women's heads they are
[04:37.280 --> 04:41.520]  kicking women out of college they are literally turning the country over to a bunch of cavemen
[04:41.520 --> 04:48.320]  from all over the caucuses you name it that have flooded in saudi arabia afghanistan you name it
[04:48.880 --> 04:55.280]  to have a saudi arabia funded free for all and we call this a liberation this is outrageous but
[04:55.280 --> 05:01.440]  now it's out in the open and we told you this first three years ago why does the united states
[05:01.440 --> 05:06.720]  spend the largest percentage of gdp in the world on health care why do we have the highest cancer

[09:19.920 --> 09:24.640]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities if you've got a business that you didn't build that
[09:25.600 --> 09:32.240]  somebody else made that happen mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two

[09:56.720 --> 10:15.760]  the dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras parents grabbing their children and running
[10:15.760 --> 10:19.760]  after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face to
[10:19.760 --> 10:24.000]  face with the muzzle of a swat officer's rifle they let them in the area they told them they
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.080]  could come in and now they're coming in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people
[10:28.080 --> 10:33.840]  we're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down if you want

[11:12.880 --> 11:17.840]  well we've got a special edition for you today we have a lot of great in studio guests but
[11:17.840 --> 11:23.360]  tucker carlson of fox news is here he also heads up one of the most successful libertarian
[11:24.080 --> 11:30.640]  conservative type news sites out there and that's dailycaller.com that people see via info wars.com
[11:30.640 --> 11:35.120]  and drudgereport.com because so many other stories are just right on target breaking
[11:35.120 --> 11:42.320]  breaking the tyranny wide open there's so much of it some of the stories up on info wars.com i
[11:42.320 --> 11:47.520]  see a theme today federal court denies first amendment in california you cannot wear american
[11:47.520 --> 11:52.320]  flag t-shirts because the illegal aliens just see red when they see them so you're not allowed to
[11:52.320 --> 11:59.040]  wear those also the tsa detains libertarian blogger after seeing bitcoin in his bag
[11:59.040 --> 12:07.280]  but again we're joined in studio by tucker carlson to cover the waterfront we've got russia
[12:07.280 --> 12:13.040]  seeks access to bases in eight countries for its ships and bombers russia admits its troops
[12:13.040 --> 12:17.360]  are moving into the Crimea as we reported three days ago that's not confirmed mainstream news
[12:17.360 --> 12:22.800]  we just covered the russian news ousted president emerges at press conferences defiant says they'll
[12:22.800 --> 12:28.800]  fight fascist hooligans look i don't romanticize the russians here but at the same time you've
[12:28.800 --> 12:35.200]  got soros funding no neo-nazi groups who've now gotten number three positions in the government
[12:35.200 --> 12:41.360]  who really do wear giant swastikas around their necks simply amazing that's one of the stories
[12:41.360 --> 12:50.320]  up on info wars.com us back neo-nazi party given key roles in ukrainian government and i was looking
[12:50.320 --> 12:54.560]  at this story this morning and going over at mccain meeting with him a few months ago it is
[12:54.560 --> 13:01.920]  simply amazing that one month he's meeting with al-qaeda in syria to hand over syria to him
[13:01.920 --> 13:11.440]  and in the next month he's meeting with the modern official uh nazi party now being put into official
[13:12.080 --> 13:17.520]  government positions and and their campaign slogans are blonde-haired blue-eyed people with
[13:17.520 --> 13:22.080]  lightning bolts flying out of their hands like emperor palpatine i mean you cannot make this up
[13:22.080 --> 13:25.840]  i'm going to cover it later after tucker leaves us in detail i'll read all the names you name it
[13:25.840 --> 13:32.080]  but again if if it was a real democracy move and libertarians or it was like poland throwing the
[13:32.080 --> 13:38.720]  russians out or whatever uh at the end of the cold war i'd be all for it this though is a big
[13:38.720 --> 13:44.000]  power struggle between the russian corrupt system and the e you and the e you i think is the more
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.920]  virulent of the cancers that try to take over the world but tucker carlson is here with us we're
[13:47.920 --> 13:54.240]  honored to have him daily caller dot com you've heard my little intro rant here what is your take
[13:54.240 --> 13:59.040]  on the situation in the ukraine right now but my take first of all thanks a lot for having me
[13:59.040 --> 14:02.240]  that's great haven't you know yeah i was in austin i've always wanted to meet you you're down here
[14:02.240 --> 14:06.720]  hunting yes i'm here a bore hunting and i thought no bore hunting trip would be that's why we got
[14:06.720 --> 14:10.720]  the guns out here just just sit there without it'll make you feel more comfortable ah there you go
[14:10.720 --> 14:16.000]  i'm holding a rifle chambered in 7.62 and i'm glad that's a uh navy sails use that that's a reaper
[14:16.000 --> 14:22.400]  oh it's fantastic thank you um oh would you like it i'll just i it's a gift i live in washington dc
[14:22.400 --> 14:27.520]  so i'm not even gonna apply uh even but it makes it more comfortable we'll just sit here you know
[14:27.520 --> 14:32.800]  it's fantastic we're celebrating pierce morgan being bye bye but go ahead there by the way the one
[14:32.800 --> 14:39.760]  thing i believe in this is in the second amendment no i mean look i'm very uh skeptical of a lot of
[14:39.760 --> 14:45.360]  so-called freedom movements in other countries the bottom line is it's very hard to understand the
[14:45.360 --> 14:51.200]  dynamic on the ground um outside of the united states and so before we start giving our money
[14:51.200 --> 14:56.480]  arms prestige to various uh groups trying to overthrow this or that government around the
[14:56.480 --> 14:59.600]  world we probably want to know who they are and what their agenda is and often we don't you're
[14:59.600 --> 15:04.160]  seeing it right now in syria i'm not defending the Assad regime i'm merely saying just because
[15:04.160 --> 15:07.840]  bashar Assad is a bad guy doesn't mean the people who oppose him are good guys
[15:07.840 --> 15:11.840]  and so we should pause before we start sending them weapons but so often we don't we just weigh
[15:11.840 --> 15:16.800]  in like we know what we're doing um and the the blowback and the unintended consequences are
[15:16.800 --> 15:21.520]  sometimes profound as you know and as you know because you wrote about this last year now they're
[15:21.520 --> 15:26.240]  openly in the washington post saying oh my god al qaeda got all these weapons they may attack
[15:26.240 --> 15:32.560]  europe with them it's incredible so so the weapons out of vengazi into syria are already
[15:32.560 --> 15:37.040]  leaking all over the place and we have a right to know that by the way i mean uh you know
[15:37.040 --> 15:42.800]  half of what the government does seem sometimes like it's classified and if we're arming a rebel
[15:42.800 --> 15:48.240]  group in syria you know maybe all the details shouldn't be public but that basic fact ought
[15:48.240 --> 15:51.840]  to be public and it's not you know they keep it from us and i what do you make of the new
[15:51.840 --> 15:56.560]  washington post article out today where the al qaeda rebels with al qaeda flags are chopping
[15:56.560 --> 16:01.360]  people's hands off because they don't follow the religious rules and it says the extremist
[16:01.360 --> 16:06.800]  Syrian group deemed too radical even for al qaeda well wait they have al qaeda flags they have the
[16:06.800 --> 16:13.040]  lohabious flags uh are now chopping people's hands off for not joining them i mean in the
[16:13.040 --> 16:18.640]  in the their their savages obviously in the end it seems to me our interest in other countries
[16:18.640 --> 16:25.200]  is stability and so you know for all the talk i mean the irony is for example in egypt we worked
[16:25.200 --> 16:28.480]  the babam administration was talking about you know the right of the egyptian people to determine
[16:28.480 --> 16:34.960]  their own future and to be free so we in effect back the overthrow of mubarak a year and a half
[16:34.960 --> 16:40.400]  two years later the people of egypt are less free these llamas have more power so again the paradox
[16:40.400 --> 16:45.600]  is sometimes as we pursue liberation in the rest of the world we wind up abetting tyranny and so we
[16:45.600 --> 16:50.160]  should just like be humble understand what you don't understand understand that there are always
[16:50.160 --> 16:54.480]  consequences you can't foresee sometimes it's better just to you know don't just do something
[16:54.480 --> 16:58.640]  stand there restraint is called for and no one ever says that out loud because you sound weak when
[16:58.640 --> 17:04.240]  you say it but it's true well sabre rattling with iran all the numbers show props up the moolas
[17:04.240 --> 17:09.040]  exactly and then sabre rattling with putin actually strengthens his position in russia
[17:09.680 --> 17:14.880]  and i just don't see how the state department could be involved in in giving top ministerial jobs
[17:15.520 --> 17:21.600]  in western ukraine now in Kiev uh to known neo nazis well look kube is the perfect example i
[17:21.600 --> 17:27.120]  hate fidel castro and his brother roel i think communism is the most evil system ever devised
[17:27.120 --> 17:33.200]  i truly hated the soviet union i'm not defending kube at all my only point is our embargo against
[17:33.200 --> 17:38.480]  kube clearly allowed fidel to stay in power longer so you know think through what you
[17:38.480 --> 17:43.680]  want the end result to be and then you know do wise things in order to bring it about i mean
[17:43.680 --> 17:49.680]  you can wind up helping people by attacking them i guess is the obvious point i want to get into
[17:49.680 --> 17:55.680]  gop and the whole libertarian movement the tea party and the battle that's going on there but
[17:55.680 --> 18:01.280]  one of your compadres from the daily caller was here and he said that we ought to bring up the
[18:01.280 --> 18:06.240]  point which is a really good question i didn't think to ask about how wall street is so behind
[18:06.240 --> 18:11.840]  obama and how the republicans are behind obama the leadership is not wanting to repeal obama
[18:11.840 --> 18:16.480]  care what do you think is behind that because that's what's making the tea party so upset
[18:16.480 --> 18:21.360]  well there's been a huge shift in american culture and american politics that no one ever
[18:21.920 --> 18:25.840]  people rarely mentioned and that is that rich people now vote democrat rich people and poor
[18:25.840 --> 18:29.600]  people vote democrat this is a broad generalization but it's generally true and everyone else
[18:30.240 --> 18:36.320]  doesn't and so wall street absolutely is responsible for obama's election are partly
[18:36.320 --> 18:41.440]  responsible in 08 they supported they financed his campaign even to some extent in 2012 and they are
[18:41.440 --> 18:46.720]  united wall street is united with the democratic party and with someone in the public and leadership
[18:46.720 --> 18:50.880]  on the question of immigration low skilled immigration obviously raises profits for some
[18:50.880 --> 18:56.880]  companies it also brings in democratic voters and so there is this unspoken arrangement between the
[18:56.880 --> 19:01.600]  two parties the leadership of the two parties to back what they call immigration reform increasing
[19:01.600 --> 19:06.800]  not not just legalizing the 12 or 13 million illegal aliens here but in bringing in doubling
[19:06.800 --> 19:13.600]  the number of beagle entrance low skilled labor into the country because it helps both the parties
[19:13.600 --> 19:17.040]  i just don't think it helps middle class americans at all i don't think there's any evidence it does
[19:18.320 --> 19:20.240]  but he's already by fiat
[19:22.640 --> 19:27.360]  legalizing most of the people and not deporting them i saw that uh the i think it was in the
[19:27.360 --> 19:32.240]  daily college is the other day that they've slashed uh the number of people in court that
[19:32.240 --> 19:36.000]  they're actually beating you know well let's skip this network break this is too important
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.240]  we're going to skip that break right there i can do that occasionally because i'm on radio so it
[19:40.240 --> 19:44.560]  sounds like fun well no it does cost the network money but that's you know whatever we do it sometimes
[19:44.560 --> 19:48.880]  because i just want to keep talking about this where do you see it all going because i see the
[19:48.880 --> 19:54.080]  elite in this country thinking short term about their profits instead of thinking long term about
[19:54.080 --> 19:58.960]  the integrity of the nation i mean this country's infrastructure all of it is just rotting and then
[19:58.960 --> 20:03.920]  government has this instinct to want to disenfranchise get people on the dole put them on welfare
[20:03.920 --> 20:09.120]  care cut their hours from 40 hours to 25 hours under obama care i mean it really is clowered
[20:09.120 --> 20:14.560]  and pivot well it doesn't make any sense at all from an economic point of view you want immigration
[20:14.560 --> 20:18.640]  when you have a labor shortage and we have the opposite of a labor shortage we have persistent
[20:18.640 --> 20:23.200]  long term double digit unemployment i don't care what the the official numbers are we have double
[20:23.200 --> 20:28.240]  digit unemployment that's extended for what six years now five and a half years you can't tell me
[20:28.240 --> 20:32.560]  that we have a labor shortage we have just the opposite so why are we bringing in why we doubling
[20:32.560 --> 20:38.480]  the number of legal workers because they work cheaper now that's great for the businesses
[20:38.480 --> 20:41.920]  that employ them and i understand that i'm not attacking business i'm merely saying it's not
[20:41.920 --> 20:46.720]  so great for people who already live here the u.s government has a one job only one job and that's
[20:46.720 --> 20:51.040]  to look out for the interests and the safety of american citizens not for people in guatemala who
[20:51.040 --> 20:54.960]  want to come here not for the you know striving masses around the world it'd be nice if we could
[20:54.960 --> 20:58.800]  help them but that's not our main job our main job is to watch out for people who are already here
[20:58.800 --> 21:05.920]  and citizens here americans and that scheme importing millions literally doubling the number of
[21:05.920 --> 21:10.400]  legal workers here shafts americans because it undercuts her which is really really simple
[21:10.400 --> 21:14.640]  there's no defending that well i agree with you and the numbers are very clear this is
[21:14.640 --> 21:19.280]  isn't even really debatable if someone is educated about basic economics look at switzerland they don't
[21:19.280 --> 21:25.280]  let anybody in their money gains value doesn't lose it and they only let skilled people in
[21:25.280 --> 21:31.280]  and they absolutely are the richest country in the world highest standard of living versus here
[21:31.280 --> 21:36.400]  as ross perot said you bring in giant unskilled groups it doesn't raise your country it drives
[21:36.400 --> 21:42.560]  down the overall standard of living we become like guatemala or nigeria they don't become like us
[21:42.560 --> 21:47.120]  exactly california where i grew up in southern california california when i was a child i'm
[21:47.120 --> 21:51.520]  about to turn 45 was one of the richest states in the country had a great school system and had
[21:51.520 --> 21:55.520]  great infrastructure and one of the and it was also by the way a pretty conservative state
[21:55.520 --> 21:59.360]  and voted republican and presidential campaigns one of the reasons that all of the main reason
[21:59.360 --> 22:03.600]  all of that has changed the schools have disintegrated it's too crowded for the infrastructure that
[22:03.600 --> 22:09.600]  exists uh and the state has moved dramatically left immigration that's the reason the demographic
[22:09.600 --> 22:15.040]  balance of the state changed it is more like oaxaca than it used to be i'm not attacking anybody i
[22:15.040 --> 22:19.520]  like mexican immigrants because they work hard and they don't beg and i'm not a bigot but it
[22:19.520 --> 22:23.440]  doesn't change the fact doesn't change the fact that like 80 some percent vote to take my guns
[22:24.080 --> 22:28.080]  and until we're able to deprogram these people they get here and they get the you know the
[22:28.080 --> 22:32.080]  welfare they believe the democratic party is for them the republican party leadership goes
[22:32.080 --> 22:39.200]  along with it it is literally game over bringing an outside group to vote for obama care to vote
[22:39.200 --> 22:43.680]  for socialism to vote for gun control that's why the democrats are serious when they say they're
[22:43.680 --> 22:49.840]  going to turn texas blue they will they they'll bring in 10 million illegals and then and they got
[22:49.840 --> 22:54.320]  msnbc saying my kids belong to them and they will come and they will run my life yeah there's no
[22:54.320 --> 23:01.040]  doubt about it and and they are doing this with uh you know the the complicit support of the republican
[23:01.040 --> 23:05.520]  leadership because it benefits a small number of people i'm not just to be totally clear i'm not a
[23:05.520 --> 23:09.520]  conspiracy nut i don't think this is a a secret conspiracy i think it's completely out in the
[23:09.520 --> 23:14.640]  open the chamber of commerce is lobbying for this immigration bill and loraza isn't lobbying for the
[23:14.640 --> 23:18.720]  immigration bill and they have different aims but they have the same goal which is to increase the
[23:18.720 --> 23:24.320]  number of immigrants who come here by the way we're at the highest level per capita of immigration
[23:24.320 --> 23:28.240]  in the last hundred years we have more foreign-born americans at any time in the last hundred years
[23:28.240 --> 23:33.200]  we've absorbed an awful lot more than a million it's a political takeover for 50 years and and
[23:33.200 --> 23:36.880]  the people part of the takeover are going to have their prosperity destroyed it's not like they're
[23:36.880 --> 23:41.840]  even taking over and they're going to win they're taking over and it's going to be wahaka well it's
[23:41.840 --> 23:47.120]  it's awesome for rich people i live in an affluent neighborhood in washington dc dc's the richest city
[23:47.120 --> 23:52.560]  in america and immigration is great for us because it's good for business and it's awesome for people
[23:52.560 --> 23:58.480]  seeking inexpensive help i mean to be totally blunt with you and so rich people benefit from
[23:58.480 --> 24:04.800]  immigration but anybody who's not rich does not benefit from it and so it is in a way an informal
[24:04.800 --> 24:09.040]  conspiracy against the middle it's ordinary people do not benefit from it they just don't
[24:09.040 --> 24:14.480]  and when you when you press advocates in this well how exactly does it work that you import labor
[24:14.480 --> 24:18.800]  when you have an excess amount of labor why does that help and they'll say well you because you
[24:18.800 --> 24:23.120]  expend the economy really where's that work to the united states and they say well it's worked
[24:23.120 --> 24:30.160]  in silicon valley really because silicon valley employs fewer people than it did 30 years ago
[24:30.160 --> 24:37.040]  so i'm not attacking silicon valley i'm merely saying that you know the current information
[24:37.040 --> 24:41.440]  and finance-based economy we have does benefit people but it benefits as a proportion of the
[24:41.440 --> 24:46.400]  population a smaller number of people than the manufacturing economy we used to have so obama
[24:46.400 --> 24:49.760]  looks around he's like i'm upset about income inequality well you know you should be because
[24:49.760 --> 24:54.000]  you get an unstable country when you have dramatic disparities in income but do you understand
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.360]  why we have it we have it partly maybe largely because of immigration that's right and of course
[24:59.360 --> 25:06.640]  you know what la raza stands for the race and my issue is i look at the democratic party and the
[25:06.640 --> 25:10.400]  demographics and i've always been nonpartisan but you can see they're going to get rid of the
[25:10.400 --> 25:16.720]  republican party right now they are making a commit suicide the republicans are are absolutely
[25:16.720 --> 25:21.920]  helping in this and i don't want to have a total one party system we already almost have this with
[25:21.920 --> 25:27.920]  these committee chairman but when you look at la raza and mecha and their slogans for those inside
[25:27.920 --> 25:32.960]  our group everything for those outside the group nothing and you look at how the democrats were
[25:32.960 --> 25:39.280]  anti civil rights anti civil rights act anti voting rights up until the republicans beat them
[25:39.840 --> 25:43.920]  and people like my grandfather ran for office in texas and won you know as a republican when
[25:43.920 --> 25:48.480]  nobody was a republican in the state you know back in the sixties and the democrats went from
[25:48.480 --> 25:53.440]  being the kukluks clan party of race with senator bird and all them to literally going okay we're
[25:53.440 --> 25:58.400]  going to go race politic with the minorities make them the majority and so basically they went
[25:58.400 --> 26:03.440]  sort of financing mecha la raza all of the fort foundation and that's why you have this new race
[26:03.440 --> 26:09.680]  based system where we all have been conditioned as republicans or as libertarians or as white people
[26:09.680 --> 26:15.600]  to be oh my gosh we're loving you know we're not racist yes please you know do whatever i'm sorry i'm
[26:15.600 --> 26:20.240]  white and beat ourselves with whips on the head and then meanwhile the democrats have just recreated
[26:20.240 --> 26:24.880]  the kukluks clan movement but they've done it with minorities there's a lot of truth in that
[26:24.880 --> 26:29.840]  i wish there weren't i mean there's no question that the country is more race conscious than it was
[26:29.840 --> 26:34.320]  when i was a kid i thought we were moving away i hate segregation clarence thomas said that got
[26:34.320 --> 26:38.160]  demonized last week but it's just it's just factually true we went from my kids i have four
[26:38.160 --> 26:41.200]  children and they learn all about segregation in fact it's one of the few things i learned about
[26:41.200 --> 26:44.640]  in school and how horrible it was and i agree with them completely the idea the federal government
[26:44.640 --> 26:49.440]  would take sides based on race is immoral and horrifying and i and i always want to say them
[26:49.440 --> 26:53.280]  but i never do because i want to upset them because they're too young we do that now the
[26:53.280 --> 26:58.960]  federal government takes sides and hands out spoils based on your skin color it hasn't changed in
[26:58.960 --> 27:03.920]  fact it's become even more entrenched what was once a tradition in the south and the law in southern
[27:03.920 --> 27:09.920]  states is now national under the rubric of diversity here's the problem with it not only is it unfair
[27:09.920 --> 27:15.920]  it also creates undue ethnic awareness which you don't want and it's going to create ethnic politics
[27:15.920 --> 27:20.000]  and the problem with ethnic politics is it's inherently unreasonable people hate each other
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.480]  if you would that's democrat big city politics where they break everybody the romans two thousand
[27:24.480 --> 27:28.400]  years ago controlled roam with it broke into ethnic groups we're just going back to the great
[27:28.400 --> 27:32.960]  games why you don't want it every other country has it we've never had it if you and i disagree on
[27:32.960 --> 27:37.120]  an issue we can be mad at each other but the issues get resolved like they change and we can
[27:37.120 --> 27:41.200]  become friends again if we disagree on ethnic grounds if we dislike each other because we're
[27:41.200 --> 27:45.920]  of different ethnicities that never changes ethnicities is immutable and it doesn't make it about
[27:45.920 --> 27:52.000]  actual issues it makes it about skin color and people become by definition unreasonable irrational
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.800]  in some cases violent over ethnic division and you really want to stay you want to downplay
[27:56.800 --> 28:02.000]  the importance of race and ethnicity and we are accentuating it with this over Martin Luther King
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.760]  said make it about what somebody does what they stand for not about what color they are just saying
[28:05.760 --> 28:10.160]  they're playing with fire i'm not even making a moral case here because i could because it is immoral
[28:10.160 --> 28:16.720]  but leave that aside an atheist could agree that it is dangerous to fuel this fire it can get out
[28:16.720 --> 28:20.160]  of control you there isn't a car you're right race stuff is like a religion oh man but you
[28:20.160 --> 28:25.040]  don't want to mess with it because people become people i mean it just can flare up i've traveled
[28:25.040 --> 28:29.040]  to a lot of countries and covered a covered a lot of conflict around the world and the one thing
[28:29.040 --> 28:34.080]  almost every place i've ever been has in common at its core the conflict is an ethnic conflict
[28:34.080 --> 28:39.120]  if that is the case in iraq sunni kurjiya they hate each other not because of what they believe
[28:39.120 --> 28:43.840]  but because who they are we don't want that same thing in egypt exactly same thing in ukraine
[28:43.840 --> 28:49.040]  it's catholic uh orthodox it's it's also russian ukrainian that's that's why you're saying what's
[28:49.040 --> 28:54.720]  happening in Crimea Crimea is 70 russia russian ethnic russians who are different from ethnic
[28:54.720 --> 28:59.520]  ukrainians they don't the distinction seems minor to us it's not minor to them it's central to them
[28:59.520 --> 29:02.400]  well that's right and plus the ukrainians ran into russia during world war two and killed a
[29:02.400 --> 29:06.400]  bunch of russians then vice versa the russians came in and killed them well yeah i'm stalling
[29:06.400 --> 29:11.120]  starved half of ukraine in 1938 the biggest famine in human history so like there's a lot
[29:11.680 --> 29:15.920]  that we don't perceive because to us everyone's the same they're all foreigners but no they break
[29:15.920 --> 29:22.080]  down along ethnic lines you don't want that here and we are we're accelerating it i want to ask you

[34:47.360 --> 34:53.120]  oh yeah here are guns to flaunt them in their face to try to acclimate them to liberty i love
[34:53.120 --> 34:57.680]  that about texas i i grew up with guns i grew up hunting uh from a really young age and i don't
[34:57.680 --> 35:02.640]  know anybody who's safer around guns and more responsible with guns than people who grew up
[35:02.640 --> 35:08.080]  around guns well you're a be you i mean you are like a uber man like putin or something coming
[35:08.080 --> 35:13.120]  down to texas just to hunt of course i i absolutely love texas if i could make a living here i would
[35:13.120 --> 35:17.600]  live here my kids we have relatives in texas and my kids were on two of my kids were on other
[35:17.600 --> 35:22.320]  ranch last week and they came back we're moving to texas you know everyone's nice the food is great
[35:22.320 --> 35:27.200]  you can shoot you can fish i mean it's just it's fantastic well we need you because all the socialist
[35:27.200 --> 35:32.080]  democrats from the cities they've imploded like los angeles are moving here i know and and they're
[35:32.080 --> 35:35.440]  literally turning austin into california well this is what happened in vermont this is what
[35:35.440 --> 35:39.600]  happened to main it's what happened to new hampshire i mean you you had these kind of sturdy
[35:39.600 --> 35:44.000]  independent states that were flooded by refugees from states they destroyed like new york and
[35:44.000 --> 35:50.000]  massachusetts and then they they spread the virus you know to the to the pristine states which are now
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.720]  kind of depressing a little and that's not rhetoric they literally do it put up a wall baby
[35:54.720 --> 35:59.280]  i'm i'm sure i gave that advice to friends of mine in new hampshire in manchester new hampshire
[35:59.280 --> 36:03.440]  15 years ago but now it's too late now new hampshire is moving in that direction vermont
[36:03.440 --> 36:09.360]  is like you know bulgaria i mean it's unbelievable vermont was always a conceded a small government
[36:09.360 --> 36:13.120]  i don't know right wing or it wasn't never right wing but it was always you know pro second amendment
[36:13.120 --> 36:16.080]  get out of my business you know i'm doing what i do you can do what you do we're not going to
[36:16.080 --> 36:21.680]  bother each other kind of state and now it's this overweening nanny state run by super annoying
[36:21.680 --> 36:26.800]  people from other places and they come like locust from the area they've already wrecked and they're
[36:26.800 --> 36:31.280]  aggressive they're totally in your face like i have a lot of problems trying to impose my views
[36:31.280 --> 36:35.520]  on other people like i don't even with my kids i don't lecture my kids at the table i don't lecture
[36:35.520 --> 36:39.920]  people at you know my kids school i don't not bother no they will come up and lecture my wife
[36:39.920 --> 36:46.400]  that we've got too many children oh no literally they are relentless and totally without shame they
[36:46.400 --> 36:50.320]  i believe in this well they call it nudging it's like it's like pecking like a hand there's to me
[36:50.320 --> 36:54.800]  a huge separation between my personal life and politics i don't want to obsess over politics i
[36:54.800 --> 36:59.280]  want to chase my wife around the house in an amorous way i want to play with my kids i want to
[36:59.280 --> 37:04.960]  have a normal life politics is worth getting involved in in order to create the space for a
[37:04.960 --> 37:10.640]  normal that's right you have to fight them or they'll take over exactly but they never stop
[37:10.640 --> 37:14.640]  ever they never stop with their political views and when they come to your state talking about
[37:14.640 --> 37:19.280]  liberals here um you know some of them are nice but i mean they're just they just want to control
[37:19.280 --> 37:22.800]  you and i don't want to be controlled and nor do i want to control other people i hate telling
[37:22.800 --> 37:27.440]  other people what to do i really do now that's the worst part of my job it's not fun but people
[37:27.440 --> 37:32.560]  who love liberty don't want to be the boss people that are into control they want to be boss 100%
[37:32.560 --> 37:38.480]  and that's one of the reasons why it's an asymmetrical battle that in the end the
[37:38.480 --> 37:44.000]  authoritarians have the advantage because they are willing to break eggs to make omelets you
[37:44.000 --> 37:51.600]  know whereas people like me aren't looking at pierce morgan he never really imploded because
[37:51.600 --> 37:56.320]  he took over larry king's slot that was already going down and it went from two million viewers
[37:56.320 --> 38:02.000]  down to a half million viewers down to 400 000 viewers and the lecturing and all of it but i
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.600]  see that as a bellwether of a rejection of globalism a rejection of the nanny state lecturing
[38:08.240 --> 38:13.120]  people that he is so hated i mean when i blew up in him they put that on every channel in the
[38:13.120 --> 38:17.120]  country and it just reared this week again i didn't give myself credit for it but a lot of mainstream
[38:17.120 --> 38:21.920]  media gave me credit for kind of being the bellwether of the the the straw that broke the
[38:21.920 --> 38:27.120]  camel's back of pierce morgan i guess being sent packing back to england what is your take on him
[38:27.120 --> 38:33.200]  and and the whole phenomenon of like he was obama or something they put everything behind him promoted
[38:33.200 --> 38:37.920]  him gave him every big guest still fell around his face the dogs won't eat the dog food as they say
[38:37.920 --> 38:41.600]  in the political business you can you can roll out the biggest ad campaign ever but if they won't
[38:41.600 --> 38:46.080]  eat it you're not selling any and that's exactly what happened i mean i think in the end he just
[38:46.080 --> 38:52.240]  didn't put on a very interesting or appealing show i think the gun control stuff was alienating to a
[38:52.240 --> 38:56.000]  lot of people because it should even if people agree with him he clearly didn't understand america
[38:56.000 --> 39:01.280]  he didn't understand that guns for americans are not just some affectation not just some
[39:01.280 --> 39:07.600]  you know symbol they are integral to our country to our freedom earlier you said that's baked in
[39:07.600 --> 39:12.320]  it's baked into the cake that is america absolutely and he just he didn't get that and
[39:12.320 --> 39:18.240]  why was he arrogant really really arrogant i loved your exchange with him um i have to say i was
[39:18.240 --> 39:22.480]  rooting for you well thank you but but i mean that should have been an example for him that for
[39:22.480 --> 39:26.880]  two weeks he had a rating spike after that because there was something real on there
[39:26.880 --> 39:33.600]  not just a bunch of pinheaded perseveration well and and pierce morgan you know it was no larry
[39:33.600 --> 39:37.840]  king i worked at cnn when for years five or six years when larry king was there and people always
[39:37.840 --> 39:41.840]  said larry king's stupid really i knew larry king pretty well not stupid at all one thing
[39:41.840 --> 39:47.200]  about larry king he actually listened to other people you'd he'd have on guests he would ask
[39:47.200 --> 39:50.560]  them interesting evocative questions well if you heard his radio show back in the day and i've
[39:50.560 --> 39:54.800]  actually gone in online and heard some of the old shows he was he's really smart he's he's really
[39:54.800 --> 39:59.360]  smart and he was good at getting interesting stuff it's like howard stern one of the great
[39:59.360 --> 40:04.080]  interviewers ever i thought you had a great interview on that on his show he is good he gets
[40:04.800 --> 40:09.200]  the cool stuff out from his guest whereas pierce morgan i always felt was just interested in
[40:09.200 --> 40:15.920]  talking about himself and his friends and his stupid opinions and had this obnoxious accent
[40:15.920 --> 40:22.960]  i love the idea of him being sent back to cold fog covered unhappy pasty white england
[40:23.760 --> 40:28.000]  i would feel weird if i lived in england had a prime time tv show lecturing them all day
[40:28.560 --> 40:34.800]  telling them that they you know had bad dental work or something becoming an anti-t activist or
[40:34.800 --> 40:40.400]  attacking you know the queen or something it's not your country you know well that's what jay leno
[40:40.400 --> 40:44.400]  told him behind the scenes because i was told by jay's people he said look you stop lecturing people
[40:44.400 --> 40:48.560]  about our politics it's not gonna work you're gonna be jay leno is a good guy i worked at msnbc
[40:48.560 --> 40:52.720]  for four years and i did something obnoxious on well many things obnoxious on my show and one
[40:52.720 --> 40:57.040]  time jay leno came came to my office and said you know we're not great friends or anything but he
[40:57.040 --> 41:01.280]  said i just want to give you piece of advice what you just did was you shouldn't have done that you
[41:01.280 --> 41:04.880]  look like a jerk and i said why are you telling us he said because i like you and i'm just giving
[41:04.880 --> 41:08.720]  you advice and he was right that guy's a nice guy who goes out of his way to yeah i was told he
[41:08.720 --> 41:13.200]  did that to pierce morgan yes i'm sure he did because he's that kind of person and and pierce
[41:13.200 --> 41:17.200]  morgan too where i was smart enough to take jay leno's advice i think you get advice from someone
[41:17.200 --> 41:21.200]  who's you know the word is they got rid of him because he did those old mama jokes sorry i'm
[41:21.200 --> 41:26.560]  sure that's exactly right i mean look what other i don't understand the reasoning i mean again this
[41:26.560 --> 41:30.480]  is like he's a rich guy he'll be totally fine whatever he'll wind up somewhere else but think
[41:30.480 --> 41:35.520]  about this nbc fired him because he was first in his time slot how does have you ever heard twice
[41:35.520 --> 41:39.920]  they fired him and both times he was number one in his time slot when does that happen in broadcasting
[41:39.920 --> 41:45.920]  they tried to bury him and then it it it works still so he's got rid of it because he's unpopular
[41:45.920 --> 41:50.720]  with people in you know new york and la but everyone else seemed to like him i like jail
[41:50.720 --> 41:55.760]  anyway it's it tells you that it's not a meritocracy i mean you think that tv rewards people who are
[41:55.760 --> 42:00.160]  the most successful but look at pierce morgan the fact that he hung that's where i was going is
[42:00.160 --> 42:04.880]  that it shows how rigged it is they care about the politics and the trillions they'll control
[42:04.880 --> 42:09.440]  it isn't even about the ratings but then they still lose the audience that's what the establishment
[42:09.440 --> 42:14.960]  doesn't get i mean when they program the people they put and i'm no genius but it's unwatchable
[42:14.960 --> 42:21.040]  now what's on cnn and msnbc jillan radigan has the high time slot because he's ranting and raving
[42:21.040 --> 42:25.520]  about both parties being bad so they don't renew his contract they don't want real people in there
[42:26.160 --> 42:30.000]  it's i don't know what the hell they want i mean presumably they want to succeed they have shareholders
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.640]  who are demanding profits you would think they would make wise market-based decisions but they
[42:34.640 --> 42:40.640]  don't they'd make christian almond poor the host of the sunday show on abc i don't think
[42:40.640 --> 42:45.920]  her husband wants to listen to her talk much less viewers i don't have a lecturing vampire it was
[42:45.920 --> 42:51.120]  bizarre it was bizarre and they had a pretty they should have jake tapper would have been great no
[42:51.120 --> 42:56.000]  if christian almond poor because she was friends with the wife of the president of the of the
[42:56.000 --> 43:01.440]  network i mean that's not a smart way to make no it shows it's totally clicks that are disconnected
[43:01.440 --> 43:06.480]  like maria entoinette from we talked about drudge in this great taped interviews can air in a couple
[43:06.480 --> 43:12.560]  days on the nightly news but but getting back to that i remember him a decade ago on c span
[43:13.440 --> 43:17.280]  well i mean you were talking about it i was saying you're all gone you're not going to have jobs it's
[43:17.280 --> 43:22.080]  over and of course he's been proven right now completely i sat there in the audience in 1998
[43:22.080 --> 43:26.080]  at the national press club as he told the reporters assemble that they were working for dying news
[43:26.080 --> 43:30.560]  organizations by the way they laughed at him because at the time the washington post had a flat out
[43:30.560 --> 43:35.200]  monopoly and so did all the papers ellie times they were making they were a wash in cash their
[43:35.200 --> 43:39.440]  reporters are flying first class on assignment why is drudge such a visionary drudge is a visionary
[43:39.440 --> 43:44.400]  because he follows his own instincts there's no board of directors at drudge if drudge thinks
[43:44.400 --> 43:47.680]  it's interesting and thinks his readers will think it's interesting he puts it up and he
[43:47.680 --> 43:53.200]  does it instantly and he has an unerring sense an unerring instinct for things that are interesting
[43:53.200 --> 43:58.720]  he has a mix drudge takes his page it's a you know it's technology from 20 years ago and it's
[43:58.720 --> 44:02.720]  still the most compelling thing on the internet because he takes it and he tells a story with
[44:02.720 --> 44:07.200]  other people's headlines it's brilliant if you want to know drudge's view of america read the
[44:07.200 --> 44:11.440]  drudge report every day don't even click on a headline just read the headline it gives you a
[44:11.440 --> 44:17.840]  gestalt a snapshot of what's going on exactly and it's drudge is some of his obsessions and i think
[44:17.840 --> 44:22.960]  it's fair to call them that things he's really interested in he's been interested in for 20 years
[44:22.960 --> 44:28.080]  but only now seem relevant for instance weather drudge was always focused on the weather i never
[44:28.080 --> 44:31.920]  cared about the weather all of a sudden weather is like something that we're really concerned about
[44:31.920 --> 44:36.400]  nsa spying nsa spying exactly the privacy stuff people 15 years ago said boy that drudge is a
[44:36.400 --> 44:41.600]  little bit paranoid about the government spying on us well it turns out he was prescient not paranoid
[44:41.600 --> 44:46.480]  he was absolutely right well listen 15 years ago i had stickers over my laptop people you know
[44:46.480 --> 44:51.360]  family would laugh at me and now it comes out we know camera on your laptop absolutely government
[44:51.360 --> 44:56.480]  in the us is taking millions of shots a year without warrants schools are watching kids at home
[44:56.480 --> 45:01.760]  with them i mean of course there's going to be a power grab wait by the authoritarians well it's
[45:01.760 --> 45:06.800]  scary and technology definitely empowers the people who control it and if the u.s. government
[45:06.800 --> 45:11.600]  controls technology then they have an awful lot and if they get away with it i mean take the
[45:11.600 --> 45:16.080]  austin police chief i should have brought this up he was in here last friday or i or no i guess
[45:16.080 --> 45:21.920]  it's monday was few days ago whatever the point is is that he now it's a federal initiative they
[45:21.920 --> 45:27.040]  want to dial all the private security cameras in so the police can look at them well pretty soon
[45:27.040 --> 45:33.760]  it's going to be mandatory see i just i'm really bothered by that intensely bothered because the
[45:33.760 --> 45:38.720]  i don't care what the intent is i mean presumably the intent is to stop bad people and protect the
[45:38.720 --> 45:44.720]  rest of us but in practice large or large organizations almost can never resist the
[45:44.720 --> 45:49.600]  inherent temptation to abuse their power the more power you amass the greater the temptation
[45:49.600 --> 45:55.600]  to abuse that power and you see this in every big organization whether it's the church whether it's
[45:55.600 --> 46:00.160]  universities and most profoundly of all the biggest organization in human history the federal
[46:00.160 --> 46:05.760]  government of the united states and so giving them that power even if it's you know for presumably
[46:06.480 --> 46:11.440]  noble ends is a real risk i think it's really unwise the founders understood you want to take
[46:11.440 --> 46:15.360]  power and make it diffuse you want to vest some with this guy some with that guy some with the
[46:15.360 --> 46:19.440]  third guy and make sure that you know it's it's the same principle you give you know it takes three
[46:19.440 --> 46:23.920]  keys to open a safe you're not going to get any theft if you have that but if you have one guy
[46:23.920 --> 46:29.440]  holding the key to the safe he can loot the safe and generally it will end up happening because
[46:29.440 --> 46:33.120]  power corrupts an absolute power tends to grab absolute words have never been spoken it's a
[46:33.120 --> 46:38.000]  cliche for a reason here's an article from yesterday info wars.com you read it here first
[46:38.000 --> 46:43.040]  government spies on innocent people via webcams laptops xbox latest snowden leak confirmed
[46:43.040 --> 46:49.360]  story info wars broke eight years ago we had the patents and google bragging that they were watching
[46:49.360 --> 46:54.800]  people over their webcams and then like said they heard a dog barking they would have a dog food ad
[46:54.800 --> 47:02.080]  pop up and then it turns out that they're listening and it's just absolutely incredible you just
[47:02.080 --> 47:07.040]  wonder like if i was a paranoid schizophrenic i mean there are people who you know who run
[47:07.040 --> 47:11.760]  duly paranoid oh they're obviously people think the sun is falling right they read this i mean they
[47:11.760 --> 47:18.080]  must be ready to jump off a bridge i mean it's like it's making i am very unparanoid by temperament
[47:18.080 --> 47:22.480]  completely i always i have very high self-esteem so i assume everyone likes me i assume all is
[47:22.480 --> 47:27.280]  well i'm just an optimist by nature it's just genetic it's built in nothing i did even i
[47:28.080 --> 47:32.880]  feel a little bit watched knowing all this is well that's the panopticon a phone called
[47:33.680 --> 47:36.800]  panopticon because even though they're not really watching all the time and they're they
[47:36.800 --> 47:40.800]  can't even control the data it makes you feel like you're being watched so you self censor
[47:40.800 --> 47:45.920]  but it bothers me that more americans aren't upset about it when i when i was there on this i'll
[47:45.920 --> 47:50.480]  never forget being on the set when uh at fox reporting out this nsa story is the first
[47:50.480 --> 47:54.720]  broke the stone story and and feeling you know mixed feelings about it but being feeling horrified
[47:54.720 --> 48:01.040]  by the fact that the nsa could read my email and capture my texts and and listen to my phone calls
[48:01.040 --> 48:05.760]  i was shocked by how few people shared my view of this oh it's like knowing your neighbor every
[48:05.760 --> 48:09.760]  day is looking at your window but i'm really bothered by that why aren't more people bothered i
[48:09.760 --> 48:13.920]  feel i'm starting to feel like a crazy person am i crazy i don't know i don't think i am but but the
[48:13.920 --> 48:19.360]  issue is it's not that we have something to hide we draw the blinds at night for privacy but you
[48:19.360 --> 48:23.600]  have to have privacy to have basic liberty of course there's there is no freedom without privacy
[48:23.600 --> 48:27.680]  and and the idea i love when people say things like well if you have nothing to hide then why
[48:27.680 --> 48:31.120]  does it bother you really can i have the the password to email of course you're not going to
[48:31.120 --> 48:36.640]  give me the password to email because privacy is a basic human need and if you violate it you've
[48:36.640 --> 48:40.480]  dehumanized me well the new york times as you know you're absolutely right just came out a few
[48:40.480 --> 48:44.400]  months ago talking to the new york observer so they have to go to kind of the alternative media
[48:45.200 --> 48:50.240]  of the newspapers even get heard and they interviewed over 30 people and they all said no
[48:50.960 --> 48:56.080]  quote we're not relevant we cannot get our stories picked up or heard because that's what
[48:56.080 --> 48:59.680]  you want in media is to put your new breaking story out and then have others pick it up and
[48:59.680 --> 49:05.360]  then affect the culture in a good way i wear my bias of a libertarian patriot openly and naked you
[49:05.360 --> 49:10.880]  know my bias towards truth but i can put stories out every day that end up becoming a national
[49:10.880 --> 49:16.240]  news story even of a great site like drudgereport.com doesn't pick it up but what must it be like for
[49:16.240 --> 49:21.520]  the new york times now they have little ragtag sites like mine becoming more relevant than them
[49:21.520 --> 49:25.840]  because they're so discredited how long can the power structure keep moving forward when the gray
[49:25.840 --> 49:31.120]  lady is dead well it's increasingly it's a niche publication like it's so many so want to be trendies
[49:31.120 --> 49:37.920]  that think i mean the new york times has a lot of i think influence from say 101st street all the way
[49:37.920 --> 49:43.280]  down to time and fashion square on on the west side right i mean so a certain kind of Manhattan
[49:43.280 --> 49:47.200]  dweller pays attention to the new york times and nobody else does increasingly and the reason
[49:47.200 --> 49:52.320]  nobody else does is because they don't try hard enough to be straight they really don't they don't
[49:52.320 --> 49:58.400]  make an effort they they they obsess over there i mean i'm not anti gay in the slightest but i don't
[49:58.400 --> 50:03.520]  think that every single development on gay marriage is the most important thing and i've
[50:03.520 --> 50:07.440]  always been for gay marriage but i just don't think well exactly like ukraine's really important
[50:07.440 --> 50:10.960]  but i told my reporters my god 80 percent of articles have to be about ukraine
[50:10.960 --> 50:14.400]  well exactly a certain point i'm getting sick of ukraine but ukraine might be a little bit
[50:14.400 --> 50:18.320]  more important as my start of war the latest development in gay marriage there is not a
[50:18.320 --> 50:22.560]  no exactly that by they are obsessed and at some point you don't take them seriously listen i used
[50:22.560 --> 50:26.160]  to never even think about it didn't care i'm getting sick of it that i can't turn on any

[55:04.560 --> 55:09.440]  can never underestimate the value of like the personal narrative the fact that you know he's
[55:09.440 --> 55:14.480]  out there shooting guns with hot girls like people love that he's like a james bondville he really
[55:14.480 --> 55:19.120]  he really is he's absolutely a james bondville and then compared to a totally fake harvard

[55:40.400 --> 55:47.200]  total mind control hey listen i said we're gonna my view is governments allow terrorists to attack
[55:47.200 --> 55:51.280]  they've been caught financing them they're financing al-qaeda in syria i'm not saying
[55:51.280 --> 55:56.400]  dick cheney had the plunger like wiley coyote blown up the towers yeah i don't buy it i don't buy
[55:56.400 --> 56:01.120]  that the u.s government allowed terrorists to attack i i'm open minded trust me i wouldn't
[56:01.120 --> 56:04.160]  have thought the well they sure use it to take our liberties they've definitely used to take
[56:04.160 --> 56:09.520]  our liberties without question i just don't think that they allowed it um and i think knowing a lot
[56:09.520 --> 56:13.120]  by living dc i know a lot of people in the u.s government i disagree with what they do but i
[56:13.120 --> 56:18.320]  think um with a lot of what they do but i think uh you know they wouldn't have stood for that i
[56:18.320 --> 56:25.440]  let me play a clip of bbc 24 25 minutes before tower seven the solemn brothers building fell
[56:27.040 --> 56:30.320]  saying that it had already fallen let me play that clip for you right now go ahead and uh
[56:31.120 --> 56:36.480]  as you can see behind me the uh trade center appears to be still burning we see these
[56:36.480 --> 56:43.040]  and then you can see it right there that's that's building seven right there right and then she goes
[56:43.040 --> 56:49.200]  on uh to talk about that and i mean i showed you that earlier clouds of smoke and ash and
[56:49.200 --> 56:56.080]  we know that behind that there's an empty piece of what was a very familiar new york skyline a
[56:56.080 --> 57:03.360]  symbol of the financial prosperity of this city but uh completely disappeared now and new york
[57:03.360 --> 57:10.000]  is still unable to take on board what has happened to them today presumably there were very few people
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.520]  in the sullaman building when it collapsed i mean there were i suppose fears the two twin towers of
[57:15.520 --> 57:18.720]  the world chasing all right now now we're going to show you some of the b-roll up close to building
[57:18.720 --> 57:22.560]  seven falling radio listeners can just search building seven collapse we'll roll some of that
[57:22.560 --> 57:28.720]  b-roll now uh i mean what about building seven i heard cbs radio at 4 30 in the afternoon 5 30
[57:28.720 --> 57:32.640]  eastern when i was driving to get a pizza because i was on i've been on air all day that day doing
[57:32.640 --> 57:36.400]  commentary on other shows i heard them say the government was going to bring it down to protect
[57:36.400 --> 57:40.560]  the other buildings and then later we actually found those tapes on cnn where they said get back
[57:40.560 --> 57:44.800]  we're bringing down seven and then i talked to the deputy emergency manager who said they were
[57:44.800 --> 57:50.480]  told it was going to be blown up he died two weeks after i interviewed yeah i mean then you know i'm
[57:50.480 --> 57:56.800]  look the bottom i have no idea what happened in building seven i think um that the u.s government
[57:56.800 --> 58:02.480]  didn't allow the hijackers to fly those planes uh into the trade center or the pentagon or
[58:02.480 --> 58:08.720]  shanks you know who was in building seven no the cia right fbi i i did that was the state
[58:08.720 --> 58:12.480]  emergency command center i did and there were also massive gold reserves in the basement
[58:12.480 --> 58:16.800]  and all that apparently um but i what about criminal elements in the government working with
[58:16.800 --> 58:21.600]  the saudi arabians if any of those ever emerge if there's ever a first person to count of that
[58:21.600 --> 58:25.440]  you know i will receive l edmunds i will keep an open mind you know about see bell edmunds no but

[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:03.600]  interview we did today right before we did the live show and that's going to be out later in
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:10.000]  the week but let me tell you it shows a major sea change in media that somebody like tucker
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.080]  carlson would reach out to us about a month ago saying he wanted to come to austin and go out to
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:22.720]  dinner with me and then i said hey forget dinner why don't you come into the studio and we'll have
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:28.480]  a you know debate about a couple things in studio we've got him on tape freaking out when he saw
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:34.720]  building seven in there on the screen in the tv studio so this is a big way to reach out to people
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:40.800]  and a big way to you know expand the libertarian movement and we talk about how the libertarians
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:45.200]  are taking over the republican party now the republican party is trying to block that i mean
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.600]  we're talking about real real solutions here obviously folks there is just so much news
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:57.200]  that's up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and uh i got ready for the radio show
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.760]  about seven a.m at my house today then i don't usually do an interview right before my own show
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:08.080]  so i kind of got blindsided by it today having him on uh during the first hour but there is
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:12.960]  so much news we're going to be covering but what i want to do is i want to open the phones up
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:22.080]  to get your take on any of the big issues that are out there as we learn that obama care the irs
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.320]  announced as you know on monday that indeed on their own website they will be taking money out of
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:30.640]  your bank account they will be tracking you in the tax return with penalties and interest if you
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:35.360]  don't a get insurance or b pay the five thousand dollar fee to me that's bombshell news of the
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.400]  bombshell news so i'm i covered that sunday i covered that on monday here we are on friday
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:45.360]  i'm back covering that's basically all i'm i'm i think about what upsets me the most
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:52.800]  why isn't there a move to repeal obama care going on here you got massive layoffs happening
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.760]  you've got it hurting businesses everywhere you've got it getting rid of people of pre-existing
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.800]  conditions you've got a doubling tripling quadrupling prices it is such a nightmare
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:08.560]  and if they can get away with that they can get away with anything
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:16.400]  and i'm seeing it hurt people i know um if this thing still keeps going through we already pay
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:23.360]  people pretty good around here i mean i i pay them more than most people in media at their level
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:27.840]  and folks when you get quote health care you end up paying for at least half of it
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:32.640]  and there's some pools out there and things but a lot of my crew already have their health care
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.200]  or they're being kicked off of what they had and it's going up and it's going to be really hard to
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:42.000]  keep the number of people we've got and to keep folks at the hours they are there's a big temptation
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.840]  to cut people and cut their hours so that you can have more people and not have to pay for the
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:52.640]  health care which would be one thing of the health care was twelve thousand fifteen thousand dollars
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:57.440]  a year like it was on average just last year we're looking at twenty five thousand dollars
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:04.240]  thirty thousand dollars uh for people a year i mean that's half of what some of them get paid or more
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:11.680]  so if if if you're quoting business and i'm not in business i'm in media but i have to fund myself
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.880]  myself so i am in business most people in media don't do that most of the talk show host and
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:21.440]  radio host they just have managers and handlers and they just get a paycheck and go play golf all
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:28.240]  day and i'm not knocking that i'm in here in the guts of the operation from mail order in
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:34.640]  nineteen ninety seven at my house shipping out uh you know my first film to fund my operation
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:39.520]  so i know what this is doing to the economy i know what it's doing to our listeners
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:46.080]  and it is the most monumental financial screw job tax i've ever seen so i want your take on that
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.720]  this story out of the washington post uh i don't even want to show it again on tv
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:57.680]  but it is the al-qaeda brigade and that is the al-qaeda will hobbyist flag syrian extremist
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:06.640]  amputate man's hand uh and live tweet it and you can see uh at least on my screen for some
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:13.120]  reason doesn't show up on your screen uh you you can see in the islamic writing and the flag that is
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:19.200]  a will hobbyist out of saudi arabian uh group and they're saying they're even more hardcore than
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:24.160]  al-qaeda so so that's their new distraction to say well it's not really al-qaeda it's worse than that
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:29.520]  the extremist syrian group deemed too radical even for al-qaeda perform what may have been a
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:35.360]  twitter first friday live tweeting the amputation of a hand the amputation took place in remote rural
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:42.000]  town of mas cana not saying that right in the northern province of aleppo according to a series
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.720]  of tweets posted by the account by a supporter of the extremist islamic state of iraq and syria
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:54.320]  that's the uh will hobbyist group taking over uh the first showed a photograph of a blindfolded man
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:59.840]  having his arm positioned on a table by fighters as a mass man willing to sword waits nearby another
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:05.680]  man wearing a white robe of the kind favored by arab gulf countries well i mean come on wash them
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:12.080]  posts those are the hobbyist flags behind them is reading a statement a caption states that the
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:16.640]  blindfolded man is a thief who was asked to have his hand cut off in order to cleanse his sins
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:24.080]  a second photographer is taken to the sword is about to strike the hand while a burly fighter
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:30.080]  restrains the victim a third picture posted an hour later shows the man with his hand
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.600]  chopped off and there's video of it and and this gets everybody upset what about throwing christian
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:42.800]  orthodox and catholics priest off of five-story buildings what about blowing up churches hundreds
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:50.080]  of them they blew up hundreds on christmas week last year what about just a total siege
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:54.480]  with the west funding it and giving al-qaeda so much money they've now poured back into iraq and
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:15:02.480]  taken over philuja this is a total destabilization campaign and it is outrageous then meanwhile
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:06.960]  i'm no fan of what the russians are doing i don't romanticize what the russians are doing
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:13.120]  but it is the state department it is george soros it is john mccain the same guy going over and
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:20.960]  meeting with al-qaeda they're running around now saying that you know you're you're basically a
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:27.360]  traitor if you're not for the freedom fighters in ukraine who are well-known actual neo-nazis
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:31.520]  you know that do the howl hitler salute we have photos of it major ministers doing howl hitler
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:36.960]  salutes showing blonde-haired blue-eyed god people firing lightning bolts out of their hands
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:45.520]  that's up on info wars.com in paul watson's article us backed neo-nazi party given key roles
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:52.560]  in ukrainian government and it shows mccain meeting with the very neo-nazi leaders who we have
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:58.080]  photos of doing the hitler salute again with emperor palpatine firing power beams out of
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:04.160]  their hands i mean i mean the nazis didn't they had red curtains like these folks but actual power
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:10.400]  beams i mean can you guys pull up emperor palpatine firing power beams please i mean let me say this
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:16.720]  politicians probably aren't good if their symbol is a blonde-haired blue-eyed woman firing electricity
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:22.800]  out of her fingers i mean that that probably shows these are crazed individuals so there's emperor
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:28.560]  palpatine i guess the the leader of the ukrainian right you could call them and if we go back to my
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:38.400]  computer paul watson's article uh we have uh the leader us backed uh leader how do you pronounce that
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:46.640]  guy's name oley tyos shambak i can't pronounce these folks names i just have him hollant tyombak
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:53.440]  and it says a confrontation that a us backed the confirmation that a us backed neo-nazi party has
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:59.120]  been handed key positions within the newly formed ukrainian government illustrates the fact that the
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:06.080]  euro maiden uprising was a contrived coup d'etat and has little to do with freedom and democracy
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:12.000]  back in december around the same time the top us diplomat victorian newland announced the united
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.480]  states had invested five million dollars to help ukrainians achieve a new form of government
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:26.080]  senator john mccain with the party leader how do you pronounce it oley tyombak shared the stage
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:30.160]  i've seen them all over the news with him at the event during which mccain gave the united states
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:37.120]  blessing for the opposition revolt the state department is financing and again folks what's
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.120]  crazy is they're going to open the borders up let the e you come in and suck them dry and actually
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:47.440]  bring in all these foreigners which will be anti-ukrainian but the public who's sick of foreigners
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:52.080]  will actually then go vote for a nazi party even though they will sell them out as well
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:57.840]  and you got george soros the nazi collaborator involved i mean this is too rich folks the fact
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:02.800]  that uh both these leaders have been handed the reins of power following the ouster of the president
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:08.560]  just weeks ago newland afforded them washington's seal of approval clearly reveals the united
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:12.000]  states central role in the overthrow of the democratically elected government
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:18.800]  he has the history of a banker makes him the perfect candidate to assume the role of technocrat
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:28.080]  selling ukraine the imf debt strategy however the savaboda party uh rise to prominence is even
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:32.720]  more chilling given the organization's clear links to extremist groups and anti-semitism
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:39.440]  and it shows the top diplomat victorian newland meeting with him and here he is the nazi leader
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.400]  and then down here here he is giving the nazi salute with electricity beams firing up
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:53.920]  that this ladies and gentlemen is uh very very interesting i can see hyal us backed leader
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:19:03.120]  olay how do you say it again yanibag i hope tianibag olay tianibag and i got to see more
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:08.240]  of this party's artwork i mean i got to tell you i got to hand it to him i've never seen anybody
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:14.000]  come up with that where they're firing electricity beams but i guess palpatine's are blue blue white
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.120]  there's their gold power beam so what does that mean maybe maybe you got the time machine went to
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:26.720]  the future no no it was a a long time ago in a galaxy far far away so maybe he's the trillionth
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:32.560]  grandson of emperor palpatine and this is actually a sith uprising but i'm telling you this this goes
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:37.360]  with the globalists how they fund mecha and la raza the hispanic supremacist groups that they'll
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.360]  fund the white supremacist groups they'll fund al qaeda they'll fund any radical group they can
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:46.640]  to take over and again i'm not saying russia's good either it's just a complete disaster zone
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:51.600]  with george soros running around captaining it and then i've got right-wing neocon groups attacking
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:57.040]  you know there's a not supporting george soros i mean whatever we come back folks what does john
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:02.640]  wain have to do with freedom i'll tell you straight ahead silver has always been nature's very own

[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:49.600]  on the 26th and i mentioned it but never covered it this is really a top story
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.320]  and i'm going to do it here in just a minute and then take your phone calls google order to remove
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:59.920]  anti-islamic film from youtube that is such a devastating blow for the first amendment i don't
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:03.520]  even know what to say and that's out of roiders we're going to be covering that in just a moment
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:10.960]  but first off i think this is one of the best covers ever we found an open source john wane
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:18.800]  photo uh john wane and a lovely lady and the cover of the new info wars magazine uh for the
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:23.920]  month of march by the way it's not even on the shopping cart yet it's going to go up there in
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:27.840]  the next hour you can buy it in bulk to give to your friends and family only way to get it we
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:31.200]  didn't even have subscriptions anybody who bought a subscription gets for the next year
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:37.040]  we're going right to bulk because that's more effective at cost a big color magazine that
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:43.840]  it's covers black and white john wane and it says the war on men doesn't that look good the good
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.080]  looking woman with the manly man i mean that's what it's all about right there and that's what
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:51.040]  the ladies really want on top of it even though that you know they think they want to trendy or
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:57.920]  whatever that you know it acts like a woman the point is is that god bless john wane this whole
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:02.400]  thing is about the chemicals in the water the food how they're targeting men to sterilize this
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.480]  there's also a bunch of second amendment news but this is a theme-based magazine to give to men
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:15.120]  and women so they can understand the war on men and so i gotta love it it is the new magazine
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:21.680]  and it's got all the quotes by douglas wilson and by thomas hughes norman mailer john wane
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:28.800]  i won't be wronged i won't be insulted and i won't be laid a hand on i don't do these things to
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:33.680]  other people and i require the same from them here's another one by douglas wilson we live in a
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:39.840]  feminist and a feminine culture because of this at best as a people we are uneasy with masculinity
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:44.880]  and with increasing regularity whenever it manages to appear somehow we call for someone
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:50.560]  to do something about it and the quotes just go on masculinity is not something given to you
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:55.840]  but something you gain and you gain it by winning small battles with honor that's right they don't
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:01.280]  want masculinity because men won't put up with being slaves men won't put up with being pushed
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:07.280]  around men like to operate real men with other men that are honorable and have proven themselves
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:14.640]  worthy in good society they want a bunch of scallywag backstabbing rats that think being a male
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:20.960]  that the new masculinity that mtv puts out is a thug a stupid gangster thug that cheats people
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.440]  and is arrogant to everyone and disregards everyone that's the opposite of a man that's a thug
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:31.520]  then women think i don't want a thug i want an effeminate lapdog male so the media pushes
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:37.280]  that but then that doesn't satisfy women women what you want is a real man and of course all
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:44.160]  the studies actually show that that's what women want is they want a man and uh you know sorry
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:49.600]  trendies if you don't like it but that's why there's a war on masculinity and this issue of the magazine
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:57.520]  expose it expose it came and talked now us postal service giant ammo purchase new update on that is
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:03.600]  in the article dhs gun owners are seen as a bio threat bloomberg plans that disarm americans
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:08.960]  and integrated investigative report about his latest plans leaked on that we've got the updates on
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:14.400]  the duck dynasty controversy many people are renouncing their citizenship that's expanding
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:20.880]  we have an updated report on that uh will no one challenge obama's dictatorship school shooting
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:26.320]  expert threatened we got an update on that uh on how the retired state police officer
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:33.280]  has really found the evidence that it was staged ron paul launches uh clemency petition bpa and
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:38.000]  here's the articles on men bpa lowering sperm counts and we tie the articles in together
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  uh we continue with gmo's hinder animal reproduction in animals as well as humans
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:51.360]  process food lowers iq and children and then we just go through kill more babies to save the earth
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:29:00.080]  and we've got uh 297 scientists sign a statement saying gmo's are not safe study finds bpa changes
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:06.000]  your brain and then we've got the war on men that watson wrote last week expanded the drudge and
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.120]  others carried 10 ways masculinity is under attack and again the reason we have this is there's so
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:18.560]  much digital media now and we've dominated digital media but a lot of people disregard digital media
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:24.240]  now to a great extent but you give them a big glossy color magazine that you can get for like

[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:32.640]  and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously

[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:44.800]  reporting on street lights that actually see through your clothes that naked body scan you
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:50.720]  and the way the media spends it is oh we're going to catch the terrorists with weapons
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:34:01.360]  and the police worldwide are attempting to get governments to pass laws to make you
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:10.160]  you hook your surveillance cameras into their network and again my issue with that is you
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:17.200]  can't trust the state in the final equation history has shown conclusively that every time
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:24.000]  you give this type of power to the state it will be abused here's liens macadoo's report man on

[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:35.280]  led lights greeting the passengers at a new work new jersey airport are doing a little more than
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:41.360]  just lighting the way they're spying on travelers before they even get to the security checkpoints
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:47.280]  the lights are fitted with computer chips cameras sensors and wi-fi antennas they collect data that
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:53.120]  can help detect suspicious activity or aid in police investigations we reported on these spying
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:58.960]  street lights in 2011 when illuminating concepts promoted the capability of intel street lights
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:05.520]  which include energy conservation homeland security public safety traffic control advertising
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:10.640]  and video surveillance using street lights as surveillance tools has already been advanced
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:15.440]  by several european countries and leaked documents out of the uk home office revealed that the
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.560]  british authorities were working on proposals to fit lamp posts with cameras that would x-ray
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:27.520]  passersby and undress them in order to trap terror suspects and it isn't just for street surveillance
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:33.840]  these led lights are also offering an alternative to wi-fi for your home and office german physicist
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:38.800]  herald haas has come up with a data through illumination led light bulb where data for

[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:08.240]  thanks to the energy efficiency of the leds but the lights also transmit coded messages with the
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:14.640]  desks below which will allow data to be transmitted over the internet wi-fi style now while the fourth

[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:48.000]  long ago announced its plans to direct targeted advertising through technological devices by using

[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:12.480]  startling revelation is connects ability to map your shape in high def the new xbox one can see
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:18.080]  your penis now these are just several ways that the government has already tapped into your home
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:23.200]  but i haven't even touched on the smartest device that you own your phone comes equipped with a
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:29.040]  microphone camera and tracking device that gives the nsa backdoor access to everything you do
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:33.600]  and who you're doing it with but no i'm not talking about your phone i've just been talking
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:39.280]  about light bulbs and thermostats it should be abundantly clear by now that this has nothing
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:45.360]  to do with energy efficiency and innovation this is about a well planned well orchestrated agenda
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:51.040]  for the complete transformation of america educate yourself on every aspect of this agenda
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:56.000]  so that you can learn how to fight this takeover attempt and on simplest terms vote with your
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:08.080]  dollars by refusing to buy into this smart technology leon titled that street surveillance
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:12.000]  she did another report with a man on the street asking folks about that because they're putting
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.640]  him in in austin will air that report coming up after we take some phone calls if we have time
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:22.480]  but what an incredible report that's real journalism if you're a radio listener everything
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:28.240]  she said she showed government documents or news articles including how they have the light bulbs
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:35.040]  that communicate with your computer i've been telling folks about that for six years i first
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:39.760]  saw it in my team magazine and then the associated press and they have national news shows that make
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:47.200]  fun of me and say he claims that light bulbs are watching you and it's just a complete denial
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:53.200]  while all of this is openly happening by the way she gave that headline street surveillance i want
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:58.000]  to take that video that era on the nightly news last night i want to post that on info wars dot
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:07.200]  com as the top story and it needs some bombshell headline and then link under it steve watson's
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:13.120]  article that came out last night a link to his article about you heard it here first laptops
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:17.680]  xboxes and more are watching you we need to have her video and then that article under it
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:22.400]  some of our best stuff breaks in the evening a third the people reach stuff in the evening and
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:27.200]  at night that read it in the morning and during the day and it's frustrating because i want to
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:32.800]  societally turn this back i mean that's so horrible what you just heard and so over the chart
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:39.360]  i don't even know the headline to come up with that's bad enough to describe
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:47.440]  what we just saw total special report america one thousand times worse than 1984
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:53.760]  i don't know naked body scanners on the streets
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:41:02.000]  thousand times worse than 1984 i mean that's the problem when you're faced with sensational
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:11.120]  developments and these companies spying on everything you do illegally outside of law
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:15.760]  using the data to corner the market to surveil you to cheat you they use customer
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:20.640]  databases to charge you more online they know if you have more money or a surfing history so when
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:24.320]  you go online suddenly the prices are higher because they know your algorithm and what you'll
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:29.840]  pay amazon can ship your package before you order it with a hundred percent certainty that's mind
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:37.840]  control folks that's mapping the human brain every culture knew a 1984 scenario was bad
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:44.240]  this is now beyond that toll free number to join us i want to hear from you on all these subjects
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:50.720]  the subjects of obama care and how bad it really is now the subject of the scanners on the streets
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:58.320]  but look at these two articles Reuters and then there's another one out of the ap
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.360]  google ordered to remove anti islamic film from youtube i should add the toll free number
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:16.320]  to join us is 800 259 9231 800 259 9231 and we'll go to your phone calls 800 259 9231
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:23.840]  now continuing here google ordered to remove anti islamic film from youtube they also arrested
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:28.800]  the guy and put him in jail for a year they claimed this video caused Benghazi which had
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:34.080]  already been out for a while the trailer and was not connected to it to make it like it was our fault
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:40.160]  like free speech caused it a us appeals court on wednesday ordered google ink to remove from
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:45.040]  its youtube video sharing website an anti islamic film that has sparked protests across the muslim
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:52.080]  world well now radical islam will burn stuff and we'll do whatever they say this this is incredible
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:58.000]  ladies and gentlemen buy a two one vote a panel from the ninth u.s circuit court of appeals rejected
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:03.520]  google's assertion that the removal of the film innocence of muslims amounted to prior
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:08.800]  restraint of free speech that violated the u.s constitution yeah they should sue that film
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:15.760]  company and of course they wouldn't win so instead they're saying take the video down because it
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:21.520]  depicts Muhammad as a bad guy sorry that's free speech that's western culture and if you can take
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:26.720]  our right to do that then everybody's free speech goes out the window folks i don't want to burn a
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:32.400]  karan or a bible but you got to defend somebody's right to do it because once you give into that
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:39.280]  folks once you get rid of the free speech everything else follows so extremely serious situation
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:46.320]  the plane of cindy lee garcia had objected to the film after learning that it incorporated a clip
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:51.680]  she had made for different movie which had been partially dubbed in which she appeared to be asking
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:58.960]  is your muhammad a child molester so they're trying to claim that's the reason they're going after
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:03.680]  but it sends a free speech chilling statement in a statement google said we strongly disagree
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:08.480]  with this ruling and we'll fight it chris ermetta a lawyer for a greece says she's delighted with
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:13.680]  the decision ordering youtube and google to take down the film the right thing to do the controversial
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:20.560]  film billed as a film trailer depicted the prophet muhammad as a tool as a fool and a sexual deviant
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:26.800]  it sparked a turn of anti-american unrest in the middle east with muslims libya egypt and other
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:33.200]  countries and it goes on to say the outbreak coincided with the attack on the u.s. diplomatic
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:41.040]  facilities and been gauzy our law permits even the vilous criticisms of governments political
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:46.960]  leaders and religious figures as legitimate exercises of free speech the company wrote
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:51.680]  in response to the ruling now if you don't think that's an outright attack on free speech look at
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:57.760]  this next article right here associated press remember all over the u.s. you're not allowed to
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:08.240]  wear american flags because the illegals see it as offensive ap court school can ban u.s. flag
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:14.160]  shirts for safety see if your free speech doesn't make it safe if somebody makes threats we give
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:20.160]  into them and your free speech is banned officials not public servants at a northern california high
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:24.880]  school acted appropriately when they ordered students wearing american flag t-shirts to turn
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:30.240]  the garments inside out during mexican heritage celebration sinco de mayo a federal appeals
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:36.560]  court ruled yesterday the night u.s. circuit court of appeal same folks that said you can't have that
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:46.720]  video said that the officials concerns of racial violence outweighed students freedom of expression
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:53.680]  rights so see the la rica and quistas mecha la raza hispanic could cause clang rips they don't
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.920]  like the american flag so you can't wear it administrators feared the american flag shirts
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:03.360]  would inflame the passions of latino students celebrating the mexican holiday live oak school
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:09.200]  in san jose suburb of morgan hill had a history of problems between white and latino students on
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:14.880]  that day i'll tell you one thing you go out on sigo de mayo it's mexican flags everywhere mexico
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:21.680]  mexico la raza plan of san diego and plan of san diego is to kill all whites under the uh over
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:26.160]  the age of 16 and we've gone up and interviewed folks and what does your shirt mean it means
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:31.200]  we're gonna take over we're gonna kill you and the media is like oh how sweet how good kill the
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:38.480]  gringo and you know i'm just sick of it that our government our media fosters this and pushes this
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:45.520]  as much as they can because it's all part of the balkanization of this country and is thoroughly
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:52.640]  disgusting okay let's go to your phone calls uh let's talk to average joe in illinois his take
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:59.280]  on ukraine go ahead hey man what's going on worldwide broadcast yeah that's what's up uh
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:02.560]  yeah i just want to talk about these uh neo nazis that i've been hearing about because i've been
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:06.960]  following the uh ukrain situation ever seems to be uh riot started happening they started
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:14.720]  getting really serious and uh i was watching it on rt live on the internet on youtube and they had
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:21.040]  a live place where you could actually talk and i saw a lot of anti-stimetic comments a lot of
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:26.720]  people saying you know jews get out of ukraine and stuff so i just wanted your take on what
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:33.360]  these guys are wanting to do now well i mean here's the deal the globalists will use any group they
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:40.160]  can to break a country down so they'll try to turn all the hispanics into quote la raza for those in
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:44.160]  the race everything those outside the race nothing they will go in and look at the demographics in
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:51.360]  ukraine and say the majority of people are anti-slav anti-russian and we're pro-nazi during large
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:56.320]  parts of world war two we will fund the right wing groups to take over and they'll double cross them
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:48:03.040]  in the end as well just like they'll fund al qaeda uh to go in and take over syria so it's it's
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:10.160]  total balkanization total destruction is the plan uh but you're right it is uh i see that all over

[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:37.920]  book out basically describing uh how everything works called the parties over and basically you
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:43.120]  said sounded just like my show on pbs in an hour-long presentation with bill moyers you're
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:54.400]  right lol fgre and so he had him on he did a uh breakdown of what he calls the enemy anatomy of
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:55:03.520]  the deep state in other words we look at washington we think it's broken but the military industrial
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:12.480]  complex is smoothly going along democrats and republicans are voting for the nsa for all of this
[01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:23.200]  ndaa all of this stuff that is taking away our liberties and he also points out how obama is
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:30.560]  in the pocket of wall street and the big banks it was excellent well we're gonna get him on
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:35.360]  the parties over and i guess he just basically says both parties are controlled well this realization
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:40.960]  is happening that's why we could have tucker carlson in here and him basically say i agree with almost
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:45.840]  everything you say now over there on the tv and this hasn't aired yet he goes i've got to say you're
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:50.320]  pretty much right about everything now and i can't believe it i must be going crazy and so what's
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:56.480]  happening is it's safe now to admit how much trouble we're in and i think that's a very very positive
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:03.040]  thing anything else bill yeah one other thing that and i'm gonna throw this out alex uh you've
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:11.040]  made a comment here several times over the last couple weeks that uh the earth revolves around
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:22.000]  the sun and i'm gonna ask you where you go in the universe at what fixed point to prove that
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  that in other words i'm a traditionalist i believe in scripture and i believe that god's creation
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:40.480]  namely the earth is the center not the sun well you can say that you know that that's
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:44.880]  spiritually the earth the center of of our reality i appreciate your call but you know
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:53.920]  they're able to land lunar landers mars rovers sin probes to venus probes to mercury and and it's all
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:57:01.600]  to certain feet with radio telescopes with measurements we know that the planets orbit the sun
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:07.280]  and my point in bringing that up was is that one in four americans don't know
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:13.680]  that the earth orbits the sun and and and if i understand there's a lot of stuff out in the
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:18.560]  kuiper belt that has an elliptical orbit and the rest of it but i understand people not
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:23.360]  believing the system so much that they that they throw out established science that
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:27.520]  look at how they say it's established science that man make global warming is real and it's
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:32.720]  been a proven fraud uh but i don't go to the extreme then of thinking you know the earth is flat
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:39.280]  because uh you know the establishment's been caught lying so much now we've got uh michael in

[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:52.800]  ukraine fatigue but the big developments have begun to unfold russian troops have gone into the area
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:59.040]  of eastern ukraine that's mainly russian the kramia they got fighter jet scrambled quote preparing

[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:12.000]  key roles ukrainian government federal court denies first amendment in california coup
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:17.440]  government in Kiev demands us britain mount military response in kind in the kramia now

[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:30.240]  russian air force drills ukraine attack plan for military invasion this is a big development
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:38.000]  here's another headline 12 signs that russia is ready to fight a war over kramia i get sick
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.400]  of hearing about it i'm not siding with russia either but george soros's people the globalists
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:48.240]  are in there trying to destabilize things some of the folks in ukraine have real beefs with the
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:53.680]  russian-backed government they had a western-backed government in 2004 joel some stations join us the
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.800]  next segment so i need you to repeat whatever you say now but where do you come down on this
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:02.000]  because i don't like coming down on the side of russia but also don't want to come down on the
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:07.520]  side of the hillary and the state department and george soros it's this old quandary of both sides
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:14.240]  are bad i go to the fact that it looks like the west is starting this so the initiation of the coup
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:20.960]  says that the western invasion is bad or what do you think well actually you're going to get a
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:27.040]  whole different view from me because uh you know my biggest expertise is understanding what the
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:33.040]  conspiracy is all about and there's not just one conspiracy there is a russian conspiracy no no i
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:39.040]  know there is that's what i'm that's what i'm asking you that's right but in fact everything
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:46.720]  that we've heard on the alternate media has been wrong this coup was not a western coup this was a
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:54.160]  phony coup pulled off by the pro-russian forces themselves to make it look like a collapse and
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:59.760]  to turn it on its head in other words we got to go one level deeper in conspiracy theory to understand
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:06.240]  this is the same thing that happened in the phony coup to overthrow the soviet union there's never
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:14.000]  been a coup here uh alex in the world that hasn't been done by a military takeover except in russia
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:21.440]  and now ukraine are we to believe that you know suddenly all of the powerful forces of the kgb
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:26.960]  and the russian army simply collapsed and let unarmed people take over the government so it
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:33.760]  didn't happen it was a staged coup and it was a fraud and the same thing happened this weekend in
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:40.320]  uh in the ukraine i mean it's amazing alex no one in the mainstream or even the alternative
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:45.120]  media asked these essential questions that i put out in today's world affairs brief number one
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:52.000]  who gave the orders for all the riot police the berkut to melt away and leave their posts
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:56.720]  so that the totally disarmed opposition could easily take control of the city no no i pointed
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:00.240]  that out last week but i'm gonna give you the floor when we come back i that's why i said this is
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:06.960]  very confusing for me because why did the government stand down i thought that was because of the
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:11.760]  western threat they wanted to look good but they had to know then that this group would take over
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:20.240]  since when did police let rioters shoot them and not shoot back that's right i mean this was scripted
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:24.400]  i mean who gave the orders to the pro-russian party of regions i want you to start over we're
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:29.280]  gonna come back i'm gonna give you the floor joel that's why i got you on because i really do respect
[02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:34.080]  your view and and nine times out of ten has turned out to be very accurate and very piercing so
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:39.680]  we want to get your take on this and then tie it into the larger strategy but i mean was georgia
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:45.280]  a staged event as well or was that different in 2008 well that was different i'll explain that as
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:49.120]  well yeah yeah because that looked like that was really the west trying to test russia right yeah
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:53.200]  and well it was the israelis who were involved in that as well yes yes they were involved on behalf
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:58.480]  of the globalists trying to instigate i think but they really did have to move to let's start at georgia
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:04.640]  then when we come back alex jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide

[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:28.480]  know you don't know and the more you learn that governments do involve themselves in conspiracies
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:34.000]  wheels within wheels it's come out to ben laudan raid was staged aka sigh hers two time
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:39.760]  well a surprise winner we told you first old scousen told you as well i got navy seals families on
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:43.760]  whose sons before they were killed blown up in the helicopter said it was staged they were going
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:51.280]  after a ben laudan double there was no body thrown overboard on the ship if they'd lie about all that
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:56.880]  911 you name it they'd lie about anything and there are different criminal organizations battling
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:01.680]  for control of the planet three different major power blocks i agree with the editor and chief
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:09.280]  of world affairs brief dot com's analysis former marine corps officer and a naval aviator in vietnam
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:15.280]  and again world affairs brief commentary and insight on a troubled world you can subscribe
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:20.560]  there on the site we sell his big color book that's the best out there or into all the survivalist
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:26.880]  i talk to a strategic relocation with the film we made with him exclusively an info or store
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:35.200]  dot com i should add invaluable information per region your area on politics race manipulation
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:41.600]  uh resources threats you name it not just for the us but worldwide so strategic relocation the book
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:46.880]  and the film we also sell his best seller of the bible on home fortification the secure home
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:53.440]  all available at info wars store dot com but that's a side issue the reason i wanted to get
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:12:00.480]  joel scousen on is i don't as i've said worship latimer putin i don't romanticize him i know it's
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:05.840]  just a different power block i don't like george soros the state department and what they're doing
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:12.720]  five billion dollars into ukraine back in 2004 putting another government in what's really
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:17.760]  going on but we know what the highest levels between e u russia the west united states there's
[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:24.400]  also backdoor deals weapons transfers china's been given all our bases the deep water ports the
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:30.880]  panaman canal the industry so there's high level double crossing going on and something doesn't feel
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:38.080]  right about all this and joel scousen brought up the point that it looks like the west is backing
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:42.080]  a coup it looks like they're funding neo nazis it looks terrible you've got so-called protesters
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:46.560]  being called freedom fighters shooting police at point blank not getting in trouble taking over the
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:52.480]  presidential palace no one resist uh taking over the airports beating people up and they
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:59.440]  but the russians going into eastern ukraine is this a covert deal like the the war saw pack
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:07.120]  or or before that when hitler split part of poland with stalin is that getting ready to happen
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:12.080]  what's really going on here uh with all your research joel scousen what's your take on this
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:19.120]  well my take alex is that this is pure and simple a folk a faked coup done by the russians not by
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:26.880]  the west uh because they're the only ones it's only the russian-backed uh majority rulers in
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:31.280]  ukraine that it could have given the orders to the berkut to go back to the barracks and let the
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:37.040]  opposition have full reign i mean the e u globalist don't have that kind of control there there's
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:42.240]  only one person for example look at the pro-russian party of regions who has the vast majority in the
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:50.560]  rada which is the ukrainian parliament they were voting you know in a block to stop any reforms
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:14:00.480]  and all of a sudden on saturday they they switch and vote unanimously to oust president janakovich
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:05.360]  unanimously somebody had to give them the word i mean this is like the old soviet days when you
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:10.560]  see these pictures of the whole soviet parliament raising their hand in unison and saying i you
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:16.160]  know this only happens when you have absolute party control when you switch things like that
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:23.040]  in other words you know paul credit groberts talks about the fact that on saturday on sunday
[02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:27.680]  all of a sudden the party of regions started to claim that they had threats on their lives people
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:33.280]  were shooting at them they had to flee for the lives they were mass resignations but remember
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:40.560]  that happened after they voted unanimously why would the opposition be shooting at them and
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:44.640]  threatening their lives if they were already complying and voting a hundred percent with the
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:51.840]  opposition it just doesn't make sense i'll tell you what happened it was the secret services
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:58.160]  controlled by the russians that not only threatened president janakovich to leave
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:04.000]  but also the members of the party of regions after they had voted to oust russia why would
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:10.320]  they do that because remember you've got to make the ukraine look like it's in western hands now
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:17.360]  and controlled even though it's not the entire opposition has been created by the soviet it's
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:24.720]  they control julia timoshenko and have for years but she plays up to the west as if she's pro-western
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:31.440]  but putin and her and she have a very very close relationship and that wouldn't happen if she was
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:37.760]  truly anti-russian and look at janakovich's press conference in russia today claiming he left only
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:43.200]  because his life was threatened and that he was being shot at in his car all along his exit route
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:48.720]  as he left the country i'm sorry alex but that just doesn't wash there aren't but a handful of
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:53.840]  old hunting rifles in the hands of the opposition so it's hardly believable they could set up a
[02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:59.840]  running ambush on his escape route that nobody knew where he was going or what the escape route was
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:05.920]  so what's the bigger strategy well here's the bigger strategy remember that let me just cover
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:11.840]  one other thing too you know the uk telegraph says that the russians admitted that armored
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:17.200]  units from the black sea fleet base near sabastopol have entered Crimea in order to protect fleet
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:22.000]  positions this is the story that everyone's claiming is russia's moving troops into the
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:30.000]  Crimea this is not true these are only units that are already at the naval base at sabastopol
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.600]  and which is in Crimea they're not moving into Crimea they're already there and they're simply
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:41.360]  going to other bases to ensure that russia protects its naval bases this is not in any way
[02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:48.240]  a move by russian military and neither are the fighter repositioning this is all political
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:54.240]  theater by Putin to make it appear in the western media is playing this up as if this is a major
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:17:01.600]  thing so here's here's the game plan the ukrainian opposition of course is really opposed to the
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:07.840]  extreme bureaucracy and evil that remains even during timoshenko when she was prime minister
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:14.880]  from 2005 to 2010 nothing changed this is typical of when you have a phony coup that is the communists
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:19.840]  were still in charge of all the bureaucracy everybody was still requiring bribes to get
[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:25.760]  anything done nothing changed there was no freedom change in the ukraine or anyone else in the soviet
[02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:32.480]  unit and so naturally the people have had enough and they really in a tip the tip of the iceberg
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:38.880]  when janakovic refused to have this trade agreement with the eu so this was legitimate hatred against
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:46.240]  russian domination of western ukraine now the problem is this opposition in ukraine was getting
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:52.720]  too fervent and and legitimately so yes there was some flow of western support in here but it was
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:59.200]  not as paul craig robert said daily handing out of cash there was one time uh stiff dunes or
[02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:05.040]  subscription not sort of but scholarship money that went to some of the students on the front lines
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:09.600]  but i have contacts were right there on the front lines in ukraine saying these people are just normal
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:15.040]  people they actually you know don't have any food they don't have any money they're sacrificing
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:20.800]  because they hate this regime most of these protesters were absolutely legitimate as for
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:27.200]  the claims that there are neo-nazis uh protected and supported by the rest remember there are no
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:34.400]  neo-nazis anywhere in the world legitimate neo-nazis they're only agent provocateurs built up by
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:40.400]  governments and russia does the same thing they build up they pay people to become skinheads of
[02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:45.520]  neo-nazis to give the right wing in the world a bad name and the russians play this just like the
[02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:52.400]  west because you see neo-nazis give them an excuse to attack anyone who's associated with that with
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:57.840]  that view but there's nobody who who in the right mind wants to go and champion something in the
[02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:03.760]  name of the of the nazis unless they're paid you know for by governments so we've got to really
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:08.640]  see through what's going on there but let me get to the final point that is what's the game plan
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:15.840]  the opposition was rising much faster than russia's remilitarization russia isn't anywhere near
[02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:22.720]  ready to take on the west and so here's what they've done in order to prolong the conflict in the
[02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:28.320]  ukraine they pulled a phony coup so that now it appears that western ukraine is in the hands of
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:36.160]  the globalists but they're not they're in the hands of russian puppets masquerading as pro-eu people
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:41.520]  like timoshenko you mark my words you'll be back in power pretty soon already the prime prime
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:47.440]  minister has been named is one of her formal lieutenants and that shows that her freedom party
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:53.920]  is going to be back in power soon but now from now on you're going to have a constant conflict
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:59.760]  between the eastern european russian base say what stay there i'm gonna come back and break this down

[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:27.360]  Joe i want you to get into what happened in georgia in 2008
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:32.800]  want to get your take on the forces involved in that because clearly you look at it that was the
[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:39.120]  west trying to go in and test russia but this there are a lot of telltale signs that it was
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:43.680]  staged when the police stood down the argument was well they're doing that to look friendly
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:49.040]  but the rest of the government stood down as well and then i guess the country goes into a permanent
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:55.600]  destabilization where they can play the literal right and left off the two different sides of
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:25:03.520]  the country uh the right from the west and the russian from the uh from the east and then just
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:08.640]  use that as a tool of political control i know russia to a certain extent collaborates with the EU
[02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:12.960]  but is against the angle american british us power block explain the strategy there
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:18.080]  well the strategy is remember that russia has always intended to strike the west they want
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:22.400]  to run their own new world order with them in control we've got a temporary pact with china to
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:27.280]  join with them to control the world and they'll have to fight it out whatever and they don't
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:32.560]  haven't gone that far down the road but the the goal is to take down the hegemony of the west
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:38.800]  and uh but they're not ready to do that yet so what i'm saying is it's very important to understand
[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:46.320]  that in the status quo that was going on before the last friday and before was that the pro-western
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:51.440]  western u kranians were the beleaguered ones and russia was the bad guys that's all the news kept
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:56.240]  saying the russia has ironclad control of ukraine and the westerners want to be free the russians
[02:25:56.240 --> 02:26:01.680]  are the bad guys now it's been reversed and this is why this really plays to russia's favor
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:09.120]  because if they want to postpone the eventual taking back of the soviet states uh whether it's
[02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:16.320]  Czechoslovakia, poland, ukraine, georgia, etc instead of playing like they're independent they want
[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:20.880]  to take them back with force someday they got to wait till they're militarily ready to take on
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:25.840]  the west and they're not so we've got several years that they've got to bide their time so
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:31.040]  but in order to do that you've got to play the same game that hitler played by attacking
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:38.800]  his own people the germans in poland and uh in uh Czechoslovakia in order to justify that intrusion
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:43.440]  it's too early for that justification everybody keeps thinking russia's going to attack ukraine
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:49.120]  right now to take it back and it's too early it's going to make russia look very very bad
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:54.800]  they want more disarmament with the west the west wants more unilateral disarmament with russia to
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:27:01.840]  make sure that they paved the way for this war and so what they've got to do is slow the process
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:09.520]  down now what happened after saturday's phony coup now the eastern russians are the beleaguered
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:15.280]  people and it's the western ukraine that's going to be the bad guys that's why they had to have all
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:23.280]  of the the pro-russian majority in the rata and the parliament resigned so that now it can be a
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:29.040]  majority of pro-western people they can get the blame for everything plus the fact this allows the
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:35.040]  west to come to the rescue of ukraine's bankruptcy i mean ukraine is literally bankruptcy they
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:40.160]  instituted currency controls today the west just like in the former soviet union they're going
[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:46.640]  to take over all of the payments and give bailout money to them russians are loving this but the
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:53.920]  most important thing to remember now is that for now on in advance the russian uh the western
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:59.200]  the phony opposition these are run by russians but they're going to be claiming to be pro-eu
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:04.720]  they're going to get the blame for everything that happens now you're not going to see eastern
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:10.960]  ukraine and the Crimea secede you're not going to see in the independence and here's why if they
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:16.640]  were to become independent these majoritarian russian populations in eastern ukraine and
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:21.200]  Crimea everybody would be happy the western ukranians would be happy and so would the
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:25.120]  estuaries and you wouldn't have conflict anymore what you're going to see is russia's going to
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:32.160]  accept some sort of some type of federalization which means that uh they're going to be federalized
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:37.360]  under a ukrainian nation but that means that the eastern portions will always be able to
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:43.920]  complain in the future about being underrepresented and oppressed by the dominant western government
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:50.400]  and eventually they can tweak that with protesters and with the ongoing unrest so that in a couple
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:54.560]  of years maybe three or four years when they do want to take back ukraine they'll have the
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:59.760]  justification to do that so do you see what i'm saying you're going to have a much better
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:06.880]  permanent system of conflict by allowing western Ukraine to go in ostensibly to go into western
[02:29:06.880 --> 02:29:14.160]  hands when in fact it is russian puppets playing as if they're in western hands i want to come back
[02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:20.160]  and talk about georgia and then take phone calls on the waterfront about uh strategy of the global

[02:34:57.840 --> 02:35:01.280]  about many folks and i went to doctors i was told by joel actually and i went to medical doctors
[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:06.320]  others and i talked to pharmacist ben fuchs he said you need real nascent iodine but it's hard
[02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:11.680]  to find well i finally found it bought the company out put it out to you the one place that has it
[02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:15.200]  the company still is able to put it out but it's double the price half the size that's why i said
[02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:20.960]  we have double the strength half the size i mean double the strength you know double the size
[02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:24.640]  i guess we'll just be double the size but you then can say double the strength of the leading
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:28.560]  competitor it is double the size so it's double the strength because that's accurate statement
[02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:34.640]  the point is is that we have that exclusive and so we have that available at info wars life.com
[02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:39.040]  and we've got the survival shield the fluoride shield and the supermail vitality
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:45.600]  and speaking of males we have john wane on the cover of the new march issue that just came in
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:50.240]  you can buy it in bulk at cost so you can hand out to friends and family as low as a dollar a
[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:56.560]  piece big glossy color magazine and half the magazine is about chemicals biologicals radiologicals
[02:35:56.560 --> 02:36:04.160]  so you basically drug the population to make us very very easy to control in the globalist own
[02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:09.040]  words so a great thing to give people so they understand why there's a war on men and when
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:13.840]  we finish up with georgia and they go to phone calls i want to ask i never asked joel his view
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:19.280]  on this if he agrees with me or if he sees that message out there what's what's behind that but
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:26.720]  going back to joel scousen uh joel uh so so what is the larger let's spend 10 minutes to go to
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:30.720]  calls on the three power blocks undoubtedly the globalist their own documents say that is the
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:37.200]  power blocks uh you're very accurate in that research so what are the power blocks up to what
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:42.400]  is this ukraine thing mean when will russia be ready for the strike will they strike us with
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:48.240]  china and go but start off with georgia because from what i looked at that was a real attack what
[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:54.240]  was that about well that was that was the west uh in combination with israel because uh you know
[02:36:54.240 --> 02:37:00.640]  what the west does to have plausible deniability about directly giving military arms to something
[02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:07.040]  to exacerbate the russian uh and former soviet state situation they use israel israel on americans
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:13.920]  don't realize that they use israel to to send a lot of military technology to china which is going
[02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:21.200]  to be our number one enemy someday even more you know greater than russia and people would be incensed
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:26.720]  if they knew that israel had a green light to transfer technology to china but they also did it to
[02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:34.160]  abkhazia in south osetia these are the two uh semi-autonomous regions of georgia that wanted
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:41.120]  to defect and become independent and of course the west normally does you know like to encourage
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:46.960]  independence uh but really they knew that russia wasn't going to let uh let that happen and they
[02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:51.600]  did that to simply tweak russia russia did in fact have to use military power to come in
[02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:57.600]  because of the fact that um they had israeli advisors in there they it looked to them like
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:02.880]  they were really trying to use military force to break away this is entirely different than what
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:07.920]  happened in ukraine remember the opposition has no military forces none whatsoever maybe over
[02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:12.400]  a handful of hunting rifles there's no way that they could have done a coup and that's why russia
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:20.480]  has no reason to come in and to do a military uh you know invasion to retake ukraine and here's
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:24.560]  saying just like arab spring the west knows the rebellion's coming russia knows it's coming
[02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:30.640]  so they pre trigger it so they can then control it discredit it later and even worse the prime minister
[02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:36.400]  today is saying he's accusing russia of trying to invade ukraine based upon the same phony
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:42.720]  information that i just uh told your audience about in Crimea this is not russian troops coming in
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:49.920]  from outside Crimea these are russian troops already in Crimea by prior agreement with ukraine
[02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:54.960]  they're simply shuffling some forces around to make sure that all the military bases are protected
[02:38:54.960 --> 02:39:01.520]  i'm not defending russia but they're tweaking the nose of the west and the ukrainian new ukrainian
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:07.680]  government is tweaking the nose of russia but this is all political theater nothing is going to
[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:13.200]  happen in a major military way this is just the onset of continual conflict and in getting back
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:18.880]  to the bigger picture here it's my estimation based upon what i've studied about russian
[02:39:18.880 --> 02:39:25.920]  rearmament and china rearmament or actual armament they are rearming but engaged in massive
[02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:33.600]  armament especially of missile forces they still aren't going to be ready until at least 2020
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:38.000]  and even though they're ready that doesn't mean that there's going to be a strike in 2020 it's
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:44.080]  going to be sometime in the next decade not before now as you get closer to the point when
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:48.000]  they're ready if they see an opportunity it's possible that they could strike earlier than
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:52.880]  that so i'm not trying to say that there's a definitive time that anyone i mean we're talking
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:57.360]  about three different multiple conspiracies here there's no way anyone can say this is
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:03.840]  going to happen on a certain date but we can tell when by their own statements they feel like
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:08.960]  they're going to be ready with their newest weapon systems and everything out of the russian system
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:14.560]  and the chinese talks about post 2020 in terms of being ready with new aircraft carriers with
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:20.320]  new submarines with their new missile systems and all the while of course the us is disarming
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:26.080]  we haven't built a new missile in 20 years and we're shooting off what m minute man three missiles
[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:32.400]  we have and not replacing them i mean it's an incredible suicidal mission of the west to try
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:39.280]  to set the stage and what what they have to do remember they have to induce russian china to
[02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:45.200]  strike as strong as they are getting they still have especially russia has a lot of decrepit
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:51.200]  systems a lot of older systems they got quantity they don't have a lot of quality except in their
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:57.280]  newest systems and they're very low in quantity of those things but the globus continue to have to
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:03.440]  disarm to induce them to strike and the big picture i want to put out is and people don't
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:08.800]  understand why is it the globus would want to bring on a nuclear strike on to america and it's
[02:41:08.800 --> 02:41:15.440]  because you can't get americans to give up essential freedoms national sovereignty and yield to a global
[02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:22.080]  government unless the us military gets taken down if they let the us military get taken down in a
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:27.360]  preemptive nuclear strike then they can come out of their bunkers and our leaders are building
[02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:31.120]  huge underground bunkers because they know this strike is coming if they come out of their bunkers
[02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:36.240]  and say oh the russians and chinese deceived us we didn't know this was going to happen but our only
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:41.840]  salvation now is to join together with nato and other forces and form a new world government
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:47.520]  to prosecute this war and literally everyone will lay down and say save us do whatever it takes we
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:53.440]  don't care about sovereignty just do what it takes that's why this is going to happen but they do
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:57.840]  have secret weapon systems i believe they have space-based weapon systems that are going to be
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:04.000]  used to stop any further strikes while the west regroups and pulls out a lot of secret military
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:08.800]  weapons that they've been developing not to defend us with but to prosecute this war afterwards
[02:42:09.440 --> 02:42:13.840]  i'm projecting that russia will be defeated eventually in that war because the west will
[02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:22.560]  cut a deal with china to betray russia and turn on its rear and russia can't win and here's the
[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:27.760]  advantage for china in that he gets to eliminate the other third leg of the conspiracy for the new
[02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:34.640]  world order and then it's only china versus the west and then the west wants that they want a
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:40.720]  reinvigorated china they'll use just like we invigorated russia during world war two by giving
[02:42:40.720 --> 02:42:48.000]  them all that aid and lend lease will do the same with with china because the the west wanted the
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:53.680]  cold war they wanted this great enemy because it would justify so much more militarization
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:43:01.840]  and the globalist will want an enemy a cold war enemy after world war three to justify keeping
[02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:07.040]  all of the militarized troops of the world government and by the way these same elites
[02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:12.240]  start up world war one and world war two and so many of their writings they say they need something
[02:43:12.240 --> 02:43:16.480]  bigger than a regional war ran corporation others have said in the last three years they need a
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:22.640]  world war three to get the angle american world government in place so i mean to keep it militarized
[02:43:22.640 --> 02:43:26.720]  arrow alex to keep it militarized they need a war big enough that they've got an enemy on the other
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:32.320]  side you can't win at all that's why they sabotaged and didn't let us win against russia in fact we
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:37.200]  let russia sure that's why they let patin go in and and be stolen or macArthur because they wanted
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:42.400]  to keep them there that's right so we're going to have after world war three a powerful world
[02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:47.840]  government with a global military and a global taxation system a new currency remember you can't
[02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:52.000]  have a collapse of the dollar and a new currency unless you have a world government to manage it
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:55.760]  they're certainly not going to let the if the dollar collapse they wouldn't let the fed reconstitute
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:44:01.120]  a new currency and the fed isn't going to let control of world finance that's why i keep saying
[02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:06.240]  there's not going to be an economic collapse until this war comes and that gives the powers to be
[02:44:06.240 --> 02:44:12.640]  cover it's not their fault then if the economy collapses because war did it oh it's clear notice
[02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:17.280]  they stage 9 11 right as the dot com went under exactly they're always pulling stuff so they don't
[02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:22.400]  get the blame now i want to go to phone calls but let me be more domestic here the constant attack
[02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:27.680]  on men the constant attack on women in traditional roles the attack on children the feminization
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:34.240]  all of this what is the goal behind that i mean i've i've got my views on it i don't think i've
[02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:41.280]  ever asked you your views joe scousen about the war on men because it is really kicking into high
[02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:47.600]  gear right now well it goes back to what we've talked about before that at at the bottom this is
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:54.000]  a satanic conspiracy he's giving direction this is a real person just like god is real fighting
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:45:00.160]  against god and all that is good there's no globalist purpose you know for emasculating
[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:06.080]  manhood or destroying western culture or things other than the fact or promoting homosexuality
[02:45:06.080 --> 02:45:12.080]  for that unless you want to destroy the moral fiber of a nation and that's why this multifaceted
[02:45:12.080 --> 02:45:18.160]  front that you've so eloquently described is really something that is satanic and it isn't
[02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:26.320]  a uniform conspiracy in the sense that anyone involved is being dictated to you know just like
[02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:31.520]  god speaks to conscience satans in there all the time as well and you have innately liberal people
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:36.880]  innately immoral people who get those little hints from conscience to go ahead and attack
[02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:42.720]  all that is good and to promote that which is evil and to emasculate masculinity and promote
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:48.480]  feminism and all those and they have they can do that without conspiracy that is of a of a human
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:55.040]  variety because the grandest conspiracy is the fact that satan himself works a multifaceted front in
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:46:01.680]  people's minds through organizations through leadership that he is allowed to get people into
[02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:12.000]  spiritual sickness yes it is but it's so obvious now and it's not easy to overcome you know yes
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:17.920]  repentance and returning to jesus christ is the answer but we can't force those things we can only
[02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:24.720]  do that by invitation by and so that's why the battle is one of dividing society and that's what
[02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:30.640]  i see coming up to this war is more and more society is going to be divided between those that see
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:37.280]  that there's a conspiracy that they control both political parties those that have a moral foundation
[02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:43.280]  and unfortunately you know a lot of christian churches are being suborned by becoming mainstream
[02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:48.720]  and not being and being afraid of being criticized for being extreme and radical
[02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:54.960]  chuck pastor chuck baldwin has some marvelous writings about and criticisms about the the
[02:46:54.960 --> 02:46:59.440]  mainstream christian churches and how they're basically getting into the new world order without
[02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:03.200]  there i mean they're taking government money and literally just spouting whatever the mainstream
[02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:10.640]  media says now yeah i tell you what's the time frame do you think five to ten years till they
[02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:16.480]  try this world war three thing i have to say i don't think it's coming before 2020 now as you
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:21.120]  get closer to that i mean you can't hold me to that because they could take an opportunity to move
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:26.000]  for it but i think we've still got a good five years to fight this battle and you're saying we
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:31.280]  see north korea start shelling ceo get out of get out of major cities that's right because that's
[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:35.680]  going to be the trigger event of world war three there has to be some reason why they treat north
[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:40.960]  korea with kid gloves that they don't ever have a military option for taking them down a regime change
[02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:45.920]  they know north korea is going to be the trigger to start it we may have to use tactical nuclear
[02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:51.920]  weapons to stop that kind of attack and that will justify china and russia for initiating
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:56.800]  a nuclear preemptive strike because we started with tactical nuclear when they have the pdds in
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:02.480]  place where the sub commanders and silo commanders can't fire back they'll be totally destroyed
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:07.040]  that's right you know our sub and missile commanders believe that they're going to be
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:12.400]  given the orders to launch on warning when russian china launch against us but i don't
[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:16.960]  believe those orders are ever going to arrive for those that don't know until the pdds got changed
[02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:22.400]  under clinton continued by bush and obama if the missiles are tracking in they have the authorization
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:28.960]  to defend now they've taken that away that's right and they have told them in pdd 60 1997
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:34.720]  to prepare to retaliate after absorbing a nuclear first strike that don't depend on they didn't
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:38.480]  actually tell them you're not going to be able to launch they just said don't depend on it
[02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:44.240]  it structure your system so that you can retaliate after absorbing a nuclear first strike and general
[02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:51.520]  butch needle the marine corps have retaliated with what he was just incensed and uh and especially
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:56.160]  since in that same year clinton agreed with the russians that we would keep 50 percent of our
[02:48:56.160 --> 02:49:02.240]  missile submarines in port either in king's bay georgia bangor washington to make it easier for
[02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:10.000]  the russians to target them because they were in port i mean this is just incredible alex yep and
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:15.520]  meanwhile the media pushes 24 7 to demonize the tea party that's the big threat the homeland security
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:20.160]  says uh let's talk to michael in origan you want to talk about us flags being banned you're on the
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:25.680]  air with joel scowles and go ahead hey alex joel it's a privilege gentlemen i gotta tell you joel
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:33.200]  what you say it it's just it's overwhelming i'm sitting here listening it's overwhelming um i thank
[02:49:33.200 --> 02:49:39.040]  you for you know the insight that you give us my son today and i were talking about the usa flags

[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:18.000]  american culture just par for the course for the kind of government that you have in california
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:24.400]  you know as a fellow orgonian uh i'll tell you i wince at the orgonian newspaper and you know the
[02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:30.320]  liberal elite and portland and eugene i expect them to follow suit pretty soon too what california
[02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:35.840]  does origan does you know a few years later and they're very proud of their anti-maleness i'm
[02:50:35.840 --> 02:50:41.440]  seeing in the news now that it's offensive heterosexual couples marriages now see marriage
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:48.800]  itself is offensive this isn't tolerance this is that we're being conquered by this it's amazing

[02:54:54.720 --> 02:55:02.080]  member he wants to know what's next for the usa go ahead ray hi alex uh hi joe uh i've been a
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:08.240]  council member here for the past three years and uh i actually got involved into doing this because
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:13.760]  of alex and people like alex and dorge and a few other like-minded people and i want to say thank
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:20.000]  you for uh getting me involved and i just hope that other people will get off the couch instead
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:26.000]  of just complaining about what's going on getting involved some way or somehow but uh joe my question
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:32.560]  is you talked about the timetable what would happen uh how significantly would that timetable uh
[02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:38.160]  go forward if like an emp pulse or a solar flare would hit north america like they've been talking about
[02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:45.120]  and wiping out our grid and our fences going down with china and russia say hey let's do it now
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:50.240]  instead of waiting or what do you think about that well you know that's a scenario that's been
[02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:56.720]  prognosticated by several people uh here's why i don't believe that an emp will ever strike separate
[02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:02.800]  from an actual physical nuclear strike one thing an emp doesn't do and let me just tell you about
[02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:08.160]  the technology of emp the latest data from the u.s government and others is that it takes about six
[02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:14.320]  high altitude nuclear weapons to blanket the whole us to take down the whole grid in a in a in a in a
[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:22.080]  very serious way not just one and so there's been a lot of hype about uh iran sending a whole fleet
[02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:27.200]  of ships over towards our coast and that they're going to launch a missile off that just not
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:33.600]  technically very feasible uh to do that uh it takes more than one missile and even if it did
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:39.120]  happen an emp strike doesn't take out the military because it's been hardened
[02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:44.000]  and so the military would know where it come came from they'd be able to retaliate so it doesn't
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:51.040]  achieve the the purposes of either russia and china or even a rogue state you know as if iran
[02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:56.240]  would do that which i don't believe they would and so sure if they were to do that just smuggling
[02:56:56.240 --> 02:57:02.080]  nuke into manhattan and detonated that's right i mean if you want to just make a show and get your
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:05.920]  your country retaliated against i mean if you want to do something suicidal there are easier
[02:57:05.920 --> 02:57:10.080]  ways to do that than to try to do it with a missile on a ship coming into but i just don't
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:15.040]  think that's going to happen it really is more technical than people think to to throw a high
[02:57:15.040 --> 02:57:18.960]  altitude nuclear weapon up there and it's got to be well in the 60s the pentagon detonated big
[02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:23.600]  hydrogen bombs in the atmosphere and it did knock out power but they found it was sporadic
[02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:30.400]  through the atmosphere that's right it is sporadic it takes about six to blanket the whole us and even
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:35.840]  then um as i say it doesn't take down the military because they're hard now a son
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:41.040]  emp could actually hit the whole country the equivalent of big flare why is there so much
[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:45.600]  military industrial complex hype we get hit by guests constantly wanting to come on about emp
[02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:53.120]  me well i don't know you know the government agents have been hyping a lot of things and
[02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:59.520]  frankly alex anybody who calls up me included and says i'm an insider in government and i have
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:06.000]  some top-secret information for you i don't take it because nobody in today's nsa can get away
[02:58:06.720 --> 02:58:12.480]  with talking to anybody on our side without getting caught and if they can do it week after week you
[02:58:12.480 --> 02:58:18.160]  know it's permitted it's not that they're really on our side they're always getting about snowden
[02:58:19.040 --> 02:58:24.400]  i think snowden was legit he doesn't match that same thing he's told here's the information it's
[02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:30.640]  out he's not claiming to be in the inside anymore he's not claiming to have the insider information

[02:59:56.400 --> 03:00:10.160]  to the alex jones broadcasting network network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[03:00:10.720 --> 03:00:20.080]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin
[03:00:20.080 --> 03:00:27.200]  texas alex jones i agree with joel scowson that if you're getting real info from the government
[03:00:28.320 --> 03:00:34.800]  even 15 years ago i would have high level tech company people telecom people and one time somebody
[03:00:34.800 --> 03:00:39.760]  connected to the nsa they would come to a live event where i was speaking signing books videos
[03:00:39.760 --> 03:00:46.240]  or at a movie theater or a bookstore and would walk out leave something on my car or hand me
[03:00:46.240 --> 03:00:53.760]  something in a rodeo or a car show where i was doing a remote and i was given nsa stuff i was
[03:00:53.760 --> 03:00:58.400]  given documents i was given stuff about delta force in south texas and then talked to the
[03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:02.560]  san antonio police chief who they tried to bribe so there are cases where whistleblowers
[03:01:03.280 --> 03:01:06.640]  speak out but usually it's public to the associated press the police chief
[03:01:06.640 --> 03:01:11.440]  after i intervening went public to the associated press alex philipus about the military buying
[03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:17.440]  off the city for covert operations and and thomas sanchez of kingsville i've also been
[03:01:17.440 --> 03:01:25.280]  sent stuff by state police i've been sent stuff by federal marshals but it comes in unmarked mail
[03:01:26.800 --> 03:01:32.480]  and then later i get a contact about it and they get hopping mad i got a call about the missing
[03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:37.280]  nukes and i'm not going to say from who but it was people that didn't know there were nukes hitting
[03:01:37.280 --> 03:01:43.520]  it dais were freaked out and wanted got concerned so there are but then they never would talk to me
[03:01:43.520 --> 03:01:48.880]  after and i can't say any more to let out who it is but a big a big thing happened over that
[03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:53.440]  not for me to fear for my life um so i want to be clear though there are real whistleblowers
[03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:57.440]  but somebody that constantly says i'm a government agent here i'll give you this i'll give you that
[03:01:57.440 --> 03:02:03.360]  over the phone over email that's not real because real stuff it's when people are not
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:08.240]  going to be part of evil anymore they blow the whistle like snowden at great risk of themselves
[03:02:08.240 --> 03:02:12.640]  do you agree with what i just said joel and they get out that's right there's no way to
[03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:17.840]  stay a whistleblower and not get caught when you're inside government well i mean i don't want to
[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:23.520]  actually prohibit whistleblowers but they found out who the state police guy was and then we're
[03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:28.720]  tried to fire him he was senior and i mean i can say that because people know who it is on the inside
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:34.560]  and then he was able to keep his job basically get put on a desk uh for sending me that info
[03:02:34.560 --> 03:02:39.840]  right by the way before we go on i want to congratulate you a alex on outlasting pierce
[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:48.960]  morgan you're still here and he's gone well nobody working mom but by god's good graces
[03:02:48.960 --> 03:02:54.240]  but yeah pierce morgan though it shows the mindset of the globalist thinking that that would ever be
[03:02:54.240 --> 03:03:02.160]  popular well americans just don't like somebody looking down their nose at them and and being
[03:03:02.160 --> 03:03:06.880]  disgusted with our second amendment's amendment rights but see there's a lot of good stuff happening
[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:11.840]  i see a lot of people like like you said it's either people are waking up or they're getting
[03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:17.280]  more into the darkness i just don't know it's gonna get crazy yeah there's a great division
[03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:22.400]  taking place within our society and you know the one hopeful thing i want to say about my scenario
[03:03:22.400 --> 03:03:28.720]  about this war coming in world war three that the great the hidden blessing of that that comes
[03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:34.080]  through any war even though there's a great deal of horror and terror and war is that a separation
[03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:40.000]  of society happens and the good become better and the worst become worse and a lot of them die
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:45.280]  and what's the best thing though is that the lord will drive people out of the major corrupt
[03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:50.640]  metropolitan areas there won't be any jobs left to hold them there and i think he'll inspire them
[03:03:50.640 --> 03:03:57.120]  to relocate to places where they'll have more liberty and then we can reconstitute liberty
[03:03:57.120 --> 03:04:01.840]  on a more regional and local basis even though i don't think we're ever gonna win it back
[03:04:01.840 --> 03:04:06.640]  on the national scene because of the power of this secret combination of power that we're dealing with
[03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:13.680]  well undoubtedly they are animated by a spirit of evil and deception folks can get your fine book
