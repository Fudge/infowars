[00:32.000 --> 00:39.680]  you know I talked about this two weeks ago when Obama was in town and I talked
[00:39.680 --> 00:44.680]  about it again yesterday because a pretty big city in Washington state the
[00:44.680 --> 00:49.560]  same I'm not gonna pay the $30 plus thousand dollars per leg of Obama's
[00:49.560 --> 00:54.200]  fundraising trips up there well now the headline at drudgereport.com
[00:54.200 --> 01:00.840]  Hollywood horror Obama motorcade traps pregnant woman in labor now look
[01:00.840 --> 01:06.200]  Obama can openly fund Al Qaeda and ISIS and IS Islamic State to run around and
[01:06.200 --> 01:12.440]  murder 300,000 Christians nobody cares and Obama could shut down most our
[01:12.440 --> 01:16.800]  power plants and double electricity prices people don't care and Obama can
[01:16.800 --> 01:21.000]  sign laws that bankrupt almost all US businesses that aren't exempt from Obama
[01:21.000 --> 01:27.080]  care and the general public just can't really see it but you keep a woman having
[01:27.080 --> 01:34.480]  a baby for being able to go to the hospital oh my goodness it's for the
[01:34.480 --> 01:40.520]  children just like they're using a bunch of teenagers as the face of the
[01:40.520 --> 01:45.640]  border being dissolved the North American Union well it's children I mean

[01:53.200 --> 01:59.360]  motorcade NBC News local woman in labor unable to cross street to hospital
[01:59.360 --> 02:04.040]  because of Obama motorcade and listen here's the issue when when he came to
[02:04.040 --> 02:09.720]  Austin a few weeks ago I was watching it when his motorcade began at like 745 in
[02:09.720 --> 02:13.440]  the morning he was downtown I was watching the live news feeds had all the
[02:13.440 --> 02:18.560]  traffic cams tied into it's they were showing and they shut down most of
[02:18.560 --> 02:23.680]  downtown and then he drives down I-35 and they shut the thing down in North
[02:23.680 --> 02:29.960]  Austin all the way to South Austin for two hours for close to two hours like an
[02:29.960 --> 02:36.280]  hour and 45 minutes because I was driving to work and watch the tail end at
[02:36.280 --> 02:43.640]  like 945 and this started before 8 and the last motorcycles were there and they
[02:43.640 --> 02:47.760]  still had cops blocking entrance ramps and I had to drive around it to get to
[02:47.760 --> 02:52.520]  work so maybe it was more than two hours I'm being conservative that is crazy
[02:52.520 --> 03:01.360]  that is crazy I-35 is already from 7 in the morning till 9 30 in the morning
[03:01.360 --> 03:05.480]  two mile an hour traffic on average I mean it's just a nightmare when you're
[03:05.480 --> 03:13.960]  downtown as far north as George County sometimes it just snurlls same thing in
[03:13.960 --> 03:19.360]  the afternoon 3 30 to about 6 30 you just better avoid it and it caused traffic
[03:19.360 --> 03:24.320]  shutdowns all over the place cars overheating things breaking down and
[03:24.320 --> 03:29.760]  again we've got all this other tyranny going on but when people see scores of
[03:29.760 --> 03:33.280]  federal helicopters and police helicopters and everyone grandstanding
[03:33.280 --> 03:39.400]  for some nobody to go to Robert Rodriguez's house and collect you know
[03:39.400 --> 03:45.320]  $30,000 a plate donations it's disgusting we're sick of it you
[03:45.320 --> 03:49.640]  already suck off of us you got your red carpets your Air Force one all of it
[03:49.640 --> 03:56.240]  people are tired of it Chinese Communist presidents don't act like this
[03:56.240 --> 04:00.880]  Vladimir Putin doesn't act like this he'll have about five cars on each end
[04:00.880 --> 04:05.800]  of them will have different routes and maybe a helicopter above or he'll fly
[04:05.800 --> 04:10.960]  around by helicopter again American presidents didn't used to act like this
[04:10.960 --> 04:16.920]  unless it was an inauguration or something I did it as a big stunt this
[04:16.920 --> 04:19.640]  started back in the days of Woodrow Wilson and people they would have these
[04:19.640 --> 04:24.720]  these these trains would go through the countryside and then the president would
[04:24.720 --> 04:28.640]  stop at train stations that were already like Grand Central Station full of
[04:28.640 --> 04:33.000]  people and everybody would wave at them they would take shots for the newspapers
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.200]  that was all Edward Bernays the propaganda saying make them like
[04:36.200 --> 04:41.880]  theater stars and later make them like Hollywood stars listen Obama isn't our
[04:41.880 --> 04:47.720]  Hollywood star and I'm sick of it and I don't like two hours of a highway shut
[04:47.720 --> 04:51.440]  down for him and people are starting to get it and resonate and it's stuff like

[09:28.400 --> 09:34.400]  airliner shootdown what's happening in Gaza what's happening with ISIS and IS is
[09:34.400 --> 09:38.720]  now known in the Middle East and a lot more and then coming back for a second
[09:38.720 --> 09:43.960]  visit he was almost about three weeks ago professor Daryl Hamamoto who heads up
[09:43.960 --> 09:48.040]  one of the departments at UC Davis is an expert on government propaganda and
[09:48.040 --> 09:53.880]  sociology psychology advertising saying that it is a premeditated plan to
[09:53.880 --> 09:58.080]  basically create a political underclass and implode the country into serfdom
[09:58.080 --> 10:01.880]  opening up the borders he's going to join us with the latest developments and
[10:01.880 --> 10:07.080]  the aftermath of him going public on this broadcast so that is coming up
[10:07.080 --> 10:11.640]  today I also want to open the phones up throughout the three hours of this
[10:11.640 --> 10:19.160]  Thursday edition and go through all of the different news stories now
[10:19.160 --> 10:25.240]  continuing here here is the story that I want to get to first because it
[10:25.240 --> 10:32.560]  illustrates so many different angles that we're looking at NBC News local out
[10:32.560 --> 10:40.440]  of Southern California woman in labor unable to cross the street the hospital
[10:40.440 --> 10:45.160]  because of Obama motorcade had to sit there for a long period of time I guess
[10:45.160 --> 10:51.000]  is her water poured out on the street and it was the image of the police with
[10:51.000 --> 10:57.680]  the yellow tape and coming up and getting in reporters and camera people's
[10:57.680 --> 11:03.840]  faces because their God was driving by and it's just the idea that the entire
[11:03.840 --> 11:07.920]  road was shut down for a long period of time while his Imperial Highness drove
[11:07.920 --> 11:15.000]  by going to different parts of Los Angeles shutting down traffic for long
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.160]  periods of time while they were basically busy going around collecting
[11:19.160 --> 11:26.160]  money from members of the Hollywood elite now again there's a lot of huge
[11:26.160 --> 11:30.640]  news going on worldwide potential expansion of war with Russia proxy wars
[11:30.640 --> 11:35.400]  devaluing dollar countries leaving the dollar the bricks agreements that they're
[11:35.400 --> 11:40.600]  not about Germany may join huge border collapsing
[11:40.600 --> 11:50.040]  depressionary spikes so many issues but this is the type of thing that can
[11:50.040 --> 11:54.320]  really get people thinking why does this guy or any other president have red
[11:54.320 --> 11:59.000]  carpets why do they have Air Force One why do members of Congress have jets
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.480]  now like Nancy Pelosi and others and the Speaker of the House Boehner why do we
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.200]  have an imperial government that treats us like total garbage that lives behind
[12:09.200 --> 12:17.360]  fences and have armed bodyguards but then that same government is lobbying to
[12:17.360 --> 12:25.040]  disarm the American people in the poorest areas of this country they are
[12:25.040 --> 12:33.280]  expanding the fleet of congressional jets they've just been another 550 million
[12:33.280 --> 12:37.640]  according to Wall Street Journal to buy some new jets for themselves this year
[12:37.640 --> 12:45.680]  and some of them are large type aircraft like Air Force One and again it's all
[12:45.680 --> 12:51.760]  part of them being the new elite though the Hollywoodization of the politicians
[12:51.760 --> 12:57.480]  they've always said that politics is show business for ugly people well it's
[12:57.480 --> 13:03.160]  worse than that you have the merger of Hollywood entertainment with the
[13:03.160 --> 13:07.800]  imperial presidency and that's been going on the last 20 years really bad it
[13:07.800 --> 13:12.840]  goes back to Jack Kennedy so you say 40 50 years but it's been accelerating the
[13:12.840 --> 13:24.200]  last 20 years or so to the point now where you see Obama in movies almost every
[13:24.200 --> 13:28.920]  movie I go see now Obama's in it if it's a cop movie or an adventure movie or a
[13:28.920 --> 13:37.560]  sci-fi movie there's Obama in it shooting fake newscasts for the film I mean
[13:37.560 --> 13:40.360]  just a few years ago member Arnold Schwarzenegger couldn't be in movies
[13:40.360 --> 13:44.840]  because the law in California that you can't make money off films and things
[13:44.840 --> 13:49.440]  when you're part of the state film initiative program if you study the
[13:49.440 --> 13:55.800]  old Soviet Union and the Nazis for that matter Hitler was obsessed with
[13:55.800 --> 14:00.440]  controlling German Hollywood and making the stars come and have sex with him if
[14:00.440 --> 14:05.640]  they wanted to keep being in the films and Joseph Gerbils and what they wanted
[14:05.640 --> 14:09.920]  inserted and J Edgar Hoover trying to control Hollywood and television and
[14:09.920 --> 14:13.800]  cop shows and the Pentagon involved manipulating it this has been going on
[14:13.800 --> 14:19.640]  for a long time but what it's about is your local mayor going and voting to
[14:19.640 --> 14:24.040]  spend hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to pay for Eccleston
[14:24.040 --> 14:31.080]  Eccleston to have his formula one track paid for and be given tax exemption so
[14:31.080 --> 14:36.880]  the mayor can go and be in the box each time and fly around on helicopters with
[14:36.880 --> 14:41.640]  the formula one owners and and rub shoulders with Hollywood people that
[14:41.640 --> 14:46.520]  are all paid to basically come to the event so they can control the local
[14:46.520 --> 14:51.120]  government it's all a big vanity fair all a bunch of narcissistic mentally ill
[14:51.120 --> 15:00.200]  people I mean we've all seen the mothers that will put their children in these
[15:00.200 --> 15:05.280]  beauty pageants or in these dancing classes so they'll go perform and it's
[15:05.280 --> 15:10.320]  not about the kids being in a beauty pageant or a talent show or being models
[15:10.320 --> 15:16.400]  it's about the moms putting on 20 layers of makeup and in lipstick and
[15:16.400 --> 15:22.400]  going and imagining narcissistically that they're these big stars because
[15:22.400 --> 15:28.640]  Hollywood and television has created the illusion that you aren't anybody if
[15:28.640 --> 15:32.920]  you're not in show business and so so many people that are anchorman and women
[15:32.920 --> 15:41.320]  so many newscasters so many media people only get in to the media because
[15:41.320 --> 15:46.640]  they want to be stars and I've been inside of this now for 20 years and I've
[15:46.640 --> 15:55.840]  seen it I've seen it in the Liberty movement where I would say it's got to
[15:55.840 --> 16:00.400]  be 80% of the people that get involved in it to be radio host or to make films
[16:00.400 --> 16:06.640]  are doing it to be big stars themselves and are violently jealous of anyone and
[16:06.640 --> 16:11.320]  everyone else in the movement and can work with no one because they're
[16:11.320 --> 16:14.880]  constantly trying to undermine everybody else because they're so
[16:14.880 --> 16:20.000]  narcissistic and so mentally ill and then they will accuse you of undermining
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.920]  them while all they do in truth when you know the inside baseball is undermine
[16:24.920 --> 16:30.120]  others again it's a manifestation of that I got involved in media because they
[16:30.120 --> 16:35.560]  were trying to ban guns and private sale of guns and junior you know shooting
[16:35.560 --> 16:39.680]  groups under the age of 18 and because they were taking farmers and ranchers
[16:39.680 --> 16:43.480]  land without just compensation and giving it to environmental mafia front
[16:43.480 --> 16:50.080]  groups for development I got involved because my grandfather was told to clean
[16:50.080 --> 16:54.280]  out the city creek behind his house even though it wasn't his property they
[16:54.280 --> 16:58.200]  sort of giving him $2,000 a day fines and I had to go prove in court and the
[16:58.200 --> 17:03.080]  rest of it that it was a fraud I got involved because I don't like being
[17:03.080 --> 17:08.840]  pushed around I got involved because I was so disgusted by the political class
[17:08.840 --> 17:12.840]  and the wannabe media class and all the people trying to act like they've
[17:12.840 --> 17:17.520]  arrived and act like there's somebody and act like they know everything when
[17:17.520 --> 17:23.560]  the average person in media is a mentally ill scared narcissist who is living
[17:23.560 --> 17:28.440]  in a poser fantasy land and that goes for mainstream media dinosaur media
[17:28.440 --> 17:36.200]  alternative media new media you name it the mark of real media is that you
[17:36.200 --> 17:41.520]  promote stories and ideas and culture and information that's positive and
[17:41.520 --> 17:46.360]  truthful and you work with others who have that same goal in mind because
[17:46.360 --> 17:51.880]  that's the big brass ring that's the goal don't let them confiscate the guns
[17:51.880 --> 17:55.960]  don't let them implode the borders don't let them take all the private property
[17:55.960 --> 18:00.520]  don't let George Soros and Warren Buffett lobby for higher taxes on middle
[18:00.520 --> 18:04.160]  class when they're almost completely tax-exempt and help write the laws to
[18:04.160 --> 18:07.880]  make themselves exempt expose the fraud don't let them shut off our power
[18:07.880 --> 18:12.440]  plants don't let them ship our jobs overseas shop at the farmers market
[18:12.440 --> 18:16.480]  stand up for the Amish being SWAT team for shelling cheese to their neighbors
[18:16.480 --> 18:21.280]  stand up for the mother having her two children taken with no due process for
[18:21.280 --> 18:26.960]  CPS because they want to sell them into the adoption market stand up against the
[18:26.960 --> 18:30.960]  Christians and Muslim minorities being slaughtered by ISIS who's gonna stand up
[18:30.960 --> 18:36.280]  for them having empathy for other people realizing that if you don't have
[18:36.280 --> 18:41.760]  empathy for the people in all these war-torn regions if you don't understand
[18:41.760 --> 18:45.280]  what they're going through the reason you have an instinct to care about them
[18:45.280 --> 18:49.080]  and want it to stop and not want to have it being done in your name is because

[25:06.440 --> 25:12.640]  glitter bugs who aren't doing anything to try to change the world they might as
[25:12.640 --> 25:18.480]  well go hang out with Benny him the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit you know
[25:18.480 --> 25:23.360]  I've never talked about this on air and I haven't read this in decades but when
[25:23.360 --> 25:28.200]  I describe being God fearing and isn't like some type of servitude or slavery
[25:28.200 --> 25:34.240]  it's like not wanting to do something bad in front of your elderly grandmother
[25:34.240 --> 25:39.400]  it's it's it's it's wanting to be a good person not wanting to be separated from
[25:39.400 --> 25:43.360]  the spirit of goodness that's how I've always described it and I was probably
[25:43.360 --> 25:47.840]  going subconsciously from reading the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit when I
[25:47.840 --> 25:53.080]  was a child but Chris Jordan brought this into me and it describes it
[25:53.080 --> 25:59.400]  absolutely perfectly fear of the Lord wonder and awe with the gift of fear of
[25:59.400 --> 26:04.200]  the Lord we are aware of the glory and majesty of God a person with wonder and
[26:04.200 --> 26:10.320]  awe knows that God is the perfection of all we desire perfect knowledge perfect
[26:10.320 --> 26:15.200]  goodness perfect power perfect love the gift is described as a fear of
[26:15.200 --> 26:22.760]  separating oneself from God he describes the gift as a fear like a child's fear of
[26:22.760 --> 26:27.560]  offending his father rather than servile fear this is a fear of punishment fear of
[26:27.560 --> 26:35.440]  the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and I think that says it perfectly and even
[26:35.440 --> 26:42.280]  if you don't believe in God folks I have a fear of peeing in a public pool not
[26:42.280 --> 26:48.880]  that I'm going to be caught I was in a public pool of my kids just the other
[26:48.880 --> 26:56.360]  day and jump in and I'm thinking man it'd be easy to pee in the pool and I
[26:56.360 --> 27:01.520]  said no I'm gonna get up and walk the hundred two hundred yards to the
[27:01.520 --> 27:05.200]  bathroom and I'm gonna go to the bathroom there and then and of course I'm not
[27:05.200 --> 27:08.720]  being juvenile here telling the story you've all done it you look at most
[27:08.720 --> 27:11.960]  people they're not getting up to go to the bathroom folks the point is I don't
[27:11.960 --> 27:15.200]  want to swim around everybody's urine and I know people are already doing it
[27:15.200 --> 27:20.880]  but I'm I'm not gonna contribute to it now a lot of you say oh I go ahead and
[27:20.880 --> 27:28.400]  pee in the public pool a lot of y'all to know you do it the point is that why
[27:28.400 --> 27:31.880]  don't you just crap in the pool then oh well you know that would be really
[27:31.880 --> 27:36.840]  gross wouldn't it and everybody might see you then well it's the same thing
[27:36.840 --> 27:40.480]  about committing crime or the same thing being corrupt or the same thing
[27:40.480 --> 27:46.120]  giving in to the New World Order if you feel first you pee in the pool well
[27:46.120 --> 27:50.160]  next you're doing number two in the pool and again I don't usually use gross
[27:50.160 --> 27:53.640]  analogies but it's the best analogy I've got what did everybody want to public
[27:53.640 --> 27:58.040]  pools let's say Barton Springs that's where I was at big natural spring-fed
[27:58.040 --> 28:01.600]  pool I like to go there in the morning when it's not full of people peeing in
[28:01.600 --> 28:11.400]  it but the point is is that they've done studies on these so-called
[28:11.400 --> 28:14.760]  environmentalists where there's six times more likely government study in
[28:14.760 --> 28:20.920]  Canada last year to steal it was another study out just last week out of
[28:20.920 --> 28:26.560]  England where leftists are more apt to steal and lie and cheat and I'm not
[28:26.560 --> 28:29.040]  saying all environmentalists aren't real environmentalists I'm a real
[28:29.040 --> 28:34.840]  environmentalist the conservationist but the establishment fake leftists there
[28:34.840 --> 28:38.960]  it is London Guardian how going green may make you mean ethical consumers less
[28:38.960 --> 28:45.080]  likely to be kind and more likely to steal another study there's a whole bunch
[28:45.080 --> 28:50.160]  of them that's London Guardian EPA memo to employees please stop pooping in the
[28:50.160 --> 28:55.280]  hallway people say well why would they put in the hallway the toilet wasn't
[28:55.280 --> 29:00.920]  broken it's fun for a leftist to poop in the hallway I'm trying to explain this
[29:00.920 --> 29:06.280]  to people I've studied them that's the environmental protection agency pooping
[29:06.280 --> 29:09.760]  in the hallway well if you read the full report it's pooping at their desk as
[29:09.760 --> 29:13.960]  well or pooping on other people's desk and I'm not trying to be juvenile here
[29:13.960 --> 29:19.080]  folks this is what happens to a society in decline the Japanese have always been
[29:19.080 --> 29:22.640]  known as the cleanest people in the world and into being honorable people so
[29:22.640 --> 29:25.400]  how do the young people rebel now they were adult diapers and poop on
[29:25.400 --> 29:32.080]  themselves that's that's that that that describes a nihilistic society at the
[29:32.080 --> 29:36.840]  edge of a cliff who who've been given so much power like spoiled kids they don't
[29:36.840 --> 29:39.960]  care anymore except these spoiled kids want to run our lives and start World

[33:52.120 --> 33:56.760]  governor comes through town one time they shut down a bunch of roads when
[33:56.760 --> 34:00.560]  Vicente Fox came to town and had a parade of motorcycles for the criminal
[34:00.560 --> 34:03.960]  Mexican president I went out there and bullhorn him at point blank range and
[34:03.960 --> 34:07.520]  the state police refused to arrest me because they'd lost lawsuits over it
[34:07.520 --> 34:12.040]  and whenever I bullhorned at the gate and shut down the press conference of
[34:12.040 --> 34:16.840]  Vicente Fox calling him a narcotics trafficker because he's clearly connected
[34:16.840 --> 34:20.840]  to groups that have been caught doing that that video by the way is on YouTube

[37:10.240 --> 37:15.000]  house and went right through I didn't tell him to do this not just because I
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.680]  want liability protection but I don't want him to get hurt I don't even know
[37:17.680 --> 37:21.000]  Biggs probably should have done this he went right into the drug smuggling route
[37:21.000 --> 37:29.440]  area went through the openings in the fence and went and bought a taco we're
[37:29.440 --> 37:34.040]  gonna get him on the show in fact we probably get him on today I live I was

[38:01.360 --> 38:07.200]  illustrate border collapse pretty ridiculous how open the border is
[38:07.200 --> 38:12.640]  continuing a human trafficker attacks South Texas Game Warden orchestrated
[38:12.640 --> 38:16.360]  border implosion encourages criminals to engage in risky illegal business they're
[38:16.360 --> 38:21.240]  shooting at people stabbing them attacking them and when border agents
[38:21.240 --> 38:25.280]  fight back and shoot back they get indicted by the Justice Department so
[38:25.280 --> 38:33.720]  now they just run now they just run here's another one GOP in the house
[38:33.720 --> 38:38.640]  send National Guard speed removals rebuke of Obama's proposed solution to
[38:38.640 --> 38:43.360]  crisis on the southern border Obama came out in Reuters today and said he's
[38:43.360 --> 38:48.360]  dispatching a team from the Justice Department in the Pentagon with a major
[38:48.360 --> 38:53.400]  general down to the Texas border to decide if National Guard need to be
[38:53.400 --> 38:59.040]  there to quote aid the refugees and I told you where this was going on Monday
[38:59.040 --> 39:05.160]  when Rick Perry announced that he was gonna send thousands National Guard down
[39:05.160 --> 39:11.240]  there it doesn't matter because the guard are going to hand the people over to
[39:11.240 --> 39:15.360]  ice that then gives them a green card and bustles them wherever they want to go
[39:15.360 --> 39:19.920]  on Greyhound what has the Border Patrol head said and the former head and the
[39:19.920 --> 39:22.720]  head of the Union they had of the retiree union they've all said quote
[39:22.720 --> 39:27.640]  they're facilitating the end of the smuggling cycle they have collapsed the
[39:27.640 --> 39:31.600]  border they have ended the border it's asymmetrical warfare those are all
[39:31.600 --> 39:38.360]  quotes precise quotes you just heard precision total asymmetric warfare
[39:38.360 --> 39:43.680]  carried out perfectly that's a quote carried out perfectly yeah Obama's not
[39:43.680 --> 39:50.000]  a buffoon we prefer not to we let law enforcement officials do that so we're
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.840]  gonna deter by being present and fully visible and then we're gonna refer
[39:55.840 --> 40:01.840]  anybody who comes our way to law enforcement DPS will be close by to
[40:01.840 --> 40:05.920]  then hand them over to the feds who will then bust them into the country and I'm
[40:05.920 --> 40:10.040]  not saying that the general that's over the state guard is bad or over the
[40:10.040 --> 40:13.760]  National Guard in Texas let's put him back up on screen I'll give folks his
[40:13.760 --> 40:18.240]  name I'm not saying maybe Rick Perry means well I'm not but but I know what
[40:18.240 --> 40:22.240]  the in solution is here for Obama that's just in the borders that's major
[40:22.240 --> 40:28.640]  general John Nichols Texas adjunct general so that's the two-star general
[40:28.640 --> 40:33.600]  here over Texas that's what's going on ladies and gentlemen by the way the
[40:33.600 --> 40:37.640]  army in the National Guard the army is not supposed to be running around in
[40:37.640 --> 40:41.000]  Indiana running checkpoints with guns that's totally illegal but it's going on
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.720]  regular army you know where the regular army could be with Abrams tanks and
[40:44.720 --> 40:48.920]  helicopters the border that's what an army supposedly for it's not to run
[40:48.920 --> 40:53.840]  around an arm al Qaeda but of course it's not there they will do and by the
[40:53.840 --> 41:01.080]  way 911 calls are at record levels of the illegal aliens check them into
[41:01.080 --> 41:03.720]  thought crime right there that's what I'm called in Mexico I'll call it that
[41:03.720 --> 41:12.200]  here that's the term worldwide they call the police with their cell phones to get
[41:12.200 --> 41:16.640]  picked up and taken and then given to ice and then to get three hots and a
[41:16.640 --> 41:21.760]  cot and a bus ticket want to go to New York want to go to Indianapolis want
[41:21.760 --> 41:26.440]  to go to Seattle want to go to Dallas want to go to Albuquerque want to go
[41:26.440 --> 41:33.640]  to Sioux Falls I've been everywhere man I've been everywhere anywhere they want
[41:33.640 --> 41:39.880]  vouchers with Greyhound I can't get that again this is a joke people told free
[41:39.880 --> 41:51.960]  number to join us 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 so all this is is more
[41:51.960 --> 41:57.960]  nannies why don't we put the big red one well why don't we put the regular
[41:57.960 --> 42:03.040]  army brigades that are trained to take on the tea party what do you expect a
[42:03.040 --> 42:06.440]  military train to take on the tea party publicly their main mission to crush
[42:06.440 --> 42:12.080]  gun owners what would be their other mission busting the illegals in just
[42:12.080 --> 42:19.040]  that's what it is well they got the army down there the National Guard they'll
[42:19.040 --> 42:25.880]  fix it no they won't they will deliver them to ice run by Obama how COP's and
[42:25.880 --> 42:33.400]  National Guard speed removals you can't because ice is in control and the
[42:33.400 --> 42:38.840]  criminal president won't let the military do their job I'll tell you who's
[42:38.840 --> 42:41.200]  going to be arrested you if you go over the Mexican border and who's going to
[42:41.200 --> 42:45.840]  take you to a slave pit to then get your ID number and suck money out of your
[42:45.840 --> 42:50.400]  family it's gonna be Mexican army but that's okay there won't be any news
[42:50.400 --> 42:53.440]  reports about them knocking your teeth out or extorting a hundred thousand
[42:53.440 --> 42:56.760]  dollars over a year out of your family when you come back with dysentery or
[42:56.760 --> 43:01.240]  maybe die there won't be any newscast about how you were beaten to death
[43:01.240 --> 43:07.360]  especially if you're a gringo no no no no no no no no there won't be any of that
[43:07.360 --> 43:11.640]  because you don't count by what they beat Mexican Americans black Americans
[43:11.640 --> 43:15.840]  to death as well I mean Mexico is a hellish place now especially in the
[43:15.840 --> 43:24.400]  north well Raza CEO chance USA USA made me angry in an interview so see just
[43:24.400 --> 43:28.840]  hearing USA is bad I agree don't wear your American flags run up white flags
[43:28.840 --> 43:34.480]  abroad the beast migrants fear Texas crackdown after Perry sends troops to the
[43:34.480 --> 43:40.400]  border Texas governor AFP reports Rick Perry's plan to send troops to reinforce
[43:40.400 --> 43:45.520]  Mexican border was enough to deter Salvadoran couple Edwin and Sandra who
[43:45.520 --> 43:50.320]  decided to make a difficult trek through Mexico instead the young couple who are
[43:50.320 --> 43:55.680]  expected a baby in six months are crossing the Mexico a board an infamous
[43:55.680 --> 43:59.040]  freight train known as the beast which tens of thousands of Latin Americans
[43:59.040 --> 44:03.320]  hop on each year hearing two small backpacks the pair had jumped off the
[44:03.320 --> 44:06.760]  beast actually a network of trains crossing Mexico from the south the north
[44:06.760 --> 44:12.320]  and say they'll now I guess try to get up here some other way because hey what
[44:12.320 --> 44:18.080]  do you do you get pregnant and then you go through Mexico and you make the
[44:18.080 --> 44:22.640]  little payoffs on the way and then you get here and you're given a voter ID card
[44:22.640 --> 44:27.480]  a driver's license and then you vote to make me your slave it's a very easy
[44:27.480 --> 44:32.720]  equation carrying two small backpacks the pair had jumped off the beast actually
[44:32.720 --> 44:36.200]  a network of trains crossing Mexico from south the north to stop for the night in
[44:36.200 --> 44:41.960]  Christ the king a shelter in central Mexico town that provides rooms to
[44:41.960 --> 44:47.200]  migrants hoping to sneak in the United States and that just special here indeed
[44:47.200 --> 44:51.760]  Ford Foundation US government funded or church funded the couple had been on the
[44:51.760 --> 44:56.200]  road for 18 days it's leaving El Salvador but they heard the news about
[44:56.200 --> 45:00.200]  presidential prospect Perry's move to send a hundred thousand or excuse me I
[45:00.200 --> 45:04.000]  had a Freud slip a thousand National Guard reservists to the already tightly
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.560]  guarded border it's not tightly guarded listen to this bull they decided to ditch
[45:07.560 --> 45:13.800]  their plan to cross at Eagle Pass Texas and take an 11 hour route they're gonna
[45:13.800 --> 45:18.160]  cross in New Mexico they go on to say and again I'm not against these desperate
[45:18.160 --> 45:23.480]  people I feel sad for them but let me tell you they're being brought in to
[45:23.480 --> 45:27.520]  crush this country and bring down the borders and we'll vote to take my guns
[45:27.520 --> 45:32.240]  and we'll vote to make me a slave I was talking to a rock star who pays about
[45:32.240 --> 45:36.960]  80% of his money in taxes one way or another that's why a lot of rock stars
[45:36.960 --> 45:40.480]  and people just have stopped touring because they can't even make money and
[45:40.480 --> 45:45.440]  folks tell them well 80% you're paying like that golfer out in California who
[45:45.440 --> 45:52.440]  complained and had to apologize he's paying like 75% 80% ain't enough now
[45:52.440 --> 45:59.480]  Nicholson you need to pay 100 like the middle-class does in France 100% I'm
[45:59.480 --> 46:04.400]  sick of this slavery using our democratic system to bring in people to
[46:04.400 --> 46:09.440]  then vote to take my guns and I told you this was coming again general says guard
[46:09.440 --> 46:14.320]  to take observation role we just played that clip but they're gonna observe and
[46:14.320 --> 46:19.600]  then help take the 911 calls to pick the people up in air-conditioned vans to
[46:19.600 --> 46:24.760]  take them to the Greyhound bus terminal so and of course to keep reporters from
[46:24.760 --> 46:29.680]  getting video out that we've already had that go on so that's what's happening
[46:29.680 --> 46:34.200]  ice has been begging for help and sources say immigration agents believe
[46:34.200 --> 46:38.200]  the federal government is deliberately not giving them work yeah they've been
[46:38.200 --> 46:41.400]  ordered to stand down so that's a national review article it's a white
[46:41.400 --> 46:46.040]  wash much worse than that few research report nearly 90% of illegal immigrant

[47:59.640 --> 48:05.560]  all part of destabilizing the whole country and Democrats out there hate the
[48:05.560 --> 48:10.280]  second amendment and libertarians so much and want full political power they

[52:11.120 --> 52:15.160]  headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to

[55:18.840 --> 55:27.560]  arabus in Australia you're on the air go ahead hey how are you good brother yeah
[55:27.560 --> 55:31.240]  I've been listening to you for quite a while been watching from the shadows
[55:31.240 --> 55:36.160]  all that kind of stuff I've noticed Australia is signed onto the Trans
[55:36.160 --> 55:41.480]  Pacific Partnership and I do seem to recall a some of us petition a whole
[55:41.480 --> 55:45.920]  lot of people throwing up from that think about it and it does worry me what
[55:45.920 --> 55:49.000]  does this mean from my country and the rest of the world that has signed those
[55:49.000 --> 55:54.480]  documents well our elites are so wonderful and we're so free here in
[55:54.480 --> 55:58.360]  Western countries like Australia the United States that there are 30 parts
[55:58.360 --> 56:05.120]  to that and only a few of them have been leaked by anonymous which is probably
[56:05.120 --> 56:10.040]  Google and that particular part of anonymous I'm not saying all of anonymous
[56:10.040 --> 56:14.640]  is Google but Google doesn't want internet restrictions yet because they're
[56:14.640 --> 56:19.240]  dominating the world right now with the free web but insiders a few months ago
[56:19.240 --> 56:25.760]  leaked the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement but only the parts dealing
[56:25.760 --> 56:31.160]  with open web censorship on end of free speech web taxes Chinese style
[56:31.160 --> 56:35.400]  censorship that's why the Chinese are signing on to it we don't know what's
[56:35.400 --> 56:39.560]  in the other parts they're reportedly even more nightmarish but our president
[56:39.560 --> 56:43.320]  signed on to it your government signing on to it I know and no one's allowed to
[56:43.320 --> 56:48.560]  know kind of like Bush signed on to the North American Union agreement in 2005
[56:48.560 --> 56:53.520]  at Baylor there were photos of them signing the agreement and they said
[56:53.520 --> 56:58.400]  it's secret well we got part of it in the Banff Canada meeting a year later via
[56:58.400 --> 57:02.680]  lawsuits and it said North American Union using border crises and other things
[57:02.680 --> 57:07.120]  to bring in a world government so they've created North American Union Asian
[57:07.120 --> 57:11.040]  Union European Union and then bilateral agreements merging those and then they
[57:11.040 --> 57:16.200]  tell the public go to hell you can't see the agreement does it that sound like
[57:16.200 --> 57:22.000]  authoritarian autocratic tyranny to you brother it sounds like absolute corruption
[57:22.000 --> 57:27.640]  and I'll have you know I'm the founder of a Sydney based metal bank all
[57:27.640 --> 57:34.120]  deranged humanity every lyric about is very much political I think I think it's
[57:34.120 --> 57:37.640]  from one of our songs played out like to black as a lyric where it's politicians
[57:37.640 --> 57:40.840]  waging war bleeding out the foreign poor is this the way you wish to die
[57:40.840 --> 57:46.240]  servants to the light and that's exactly what we're seeing today I mean they just
[57:46.240 --> 57:49.880]  illegally spy on us they just illegally put stuff in the vaccines they
[57:49.880 --> 57:53.600]  illegally take blood at birth from Australia to here all declassified for
[57:53.600 --> 57:58.360]  secret DNA databases they just do whatever they want it's a revolution by
[57:58.360 --> 58:02.840]  the political class and the corporate class against everybody and they have a
[58:02.840 --> 58:08.520]  fighting over left right black white Hispanic whatever and again it's a real
[58:08.520 --> 58:12.440]  fight because the Democrats in this country and the same in Europe have
[58:12.440 --> 58:18.320]  organized the minorities into a majority and have them trained on average to hate
[58:18.320 --> 58:24.400]  any liberty associating it with white people so it's a serious situation and
[58:24.400 --> 58:27.080]  I don't know how to turn it around but thank you for the call from Australia
[58:27.080 --> 58:35.320]  anything else you want to take us out to break the talking to you I want to go
[58:35.320 --> 58:40.440]  down under some time second hour coming up your calls a ton of news I got
[58:40.440 --> 58:45.080]  through two stacks it's pretty good I got like six or seven more and we got
[58:45.080 --> 58:51.400]  breaking news and info wars dot com from the water table to our soils to the
[58:51.400 --> 58:56.080]  atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[58:56.080 --> 58:59.960]  but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to
[58:59.960 --> 59:03.160]  have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even
[59:03.160 --> 59:07.640]  outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[59:07.640 --> 59:11.400]  chemicals within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the
[59:11.400 --> 59:15.240]  United States well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to
[59:15.240 --> 59:18.920]  numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million Americans live
[59:18.920 --> 59:22.040]  with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to research these
[59:22.040 --> 59:26.640]  statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order
[59:26.640 --> 59:30.360]  to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but we can fight back
[59:30.360 --> 59:34.640]  against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the
[59:34.640 --> 59:39.400]  USA the new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that

[59:52.600 --> 59:59.280]  war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network

[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:19.760]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:29.640]  Alex Jones I want to make a very simple point about Russia at the start of the
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.240]  next segment to remind me guys to do that I want to go to calls right now
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:38.440]  continue with calls as well don't give you the latest Russian news big deal
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:46.080]  get in the latest economic news as well coming up briefly but I'm going to
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:50.160]  quantify why I'm against starting a war with Russia and it's a lot bigger than
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.440]  nuclear war because I don't think that's a probability right now but it is in the
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:03.240]  cards I'll break it down coming up let's talk to Adam in Canada you're on the
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:08.440]  air welcome hi Alex first I'd like to say thank you for all your hard work
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.920]  please don't thank me thank you brother go ahead and the great products that you
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:16.920]  find for us I just got another young Jevvie health start pack and I've been
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.800]  loving this stuff for months it I'm 40 years old and I feel better than I did
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:25.200]  when I was 25 well info wars health calm when you purchase the great products
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.480]  they're discounted that helps funder operation and their great products so
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:35.080]  thank you absolutely so you want to talk about checkpoints today you know I'm in
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.800]  Canada and the funny thing is when the checkpoints started up here they started
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:44.840]  without any fanfare or backlash it started with the DUI checkpoint and then
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:54.000]  it was the belt seat belt checkpoint and then it was insurance checkpoint and now
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.680]  it just seems like it's checkpoints for you know it's Tuesday let's have a
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.080]  checkpoint yeah well Magna Carta Bands checkpoints and then it became our
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:04.160]  Bill of Rights but you've got Magna Carta and they're not supposed to do them
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.200]  but they just do them and it's well come on guys it's for your safety that we
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:13.200]  have checkpoints well Soviet Russia had a Nazi Germany had them and our border is
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:17.400]  the only place that you can constitutionally have a checkpoint and I've
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.840]  been mad at the border patrol because they've been directed for at least six
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.120]  seven years to only mess with citizens mainly and they've admitted that too
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:27.520]  they said no we're told to do busy work and you know mess with teenagers sneaking
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.760]  back pills from Mexico but we're not supposed to mess with hardened criminals
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.240]  and illegals and so yeah that's what's going on so how are you liking those
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:40.840]  checkpoints well it's it's funny I can avoid the checkpoint you know because I
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:46.000]  don't drive in the city but I mean you can go just about anywhere out west in
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  the prairies and walk into the United States completely unmolested like
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.840]  nobody will see you you're walking through a cornfield or a wheat field and
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:03:00.120]  you're in the US you know so the idea that you know we're gonna catch a whole
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.960]  bunch of bad guys on our city streets but we're not going to protect our
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:08.480]  border is it's ridiculous you know we have an unprotected border of the United
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.760]  States because we've always felt that you know we're safe we don't have to
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.440]  worry about things coming across from the US that's a good point I wanted to
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.880]  what are you as a Canadian think about tens of millions of illegals shut to
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.720]  pour in 30 million already here and the word is they're already going into
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:29.000]  Canada I mean this is just this is incredible I mean I mean I guess you
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.320]  want to live in Guatemala right because that's where you're about to live well
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.360]  you know what out in Vancouver they really there's a lot of South and
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:41.040]  Central Americans in Vancouver illegals they come up through the states they
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.400]  come up to Canada they go to Vancouver because it's got the nicest climate I
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.560]  mean the homeless shelters out there are just full of Guatemalans and
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:54.800]  Salvadorians I mean it's just and they get on the welfare rolls and they are
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.560]  considered refugees up here and we've been considering them refugees longer
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.800]  than the states have so imagine you know you know it was hard to get by down in
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.920]  the states well they just come up here because it was easier to get by in
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:11.560]  Canada yeah the socialists want that and again you're gonna go bankrupt it's a
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.400]  plan it's not like we're trying to go down to Guatemala and help them get a
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.960]  good government and build them up and then if people are skilled or whatever
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.800]  let's folks come up here it is a premeditated hey you're pregnant you
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:28.840]  know what your plan is get pregnant and come to America and then the left puts
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:33.320]  us in an impossible position they go then pay to abort them and I'm like no I
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:36.520]  don't want to kill the Guatemalans I just don't want them coming here to be
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:41.880]  exploited by you to vote to take my guns don't you understand shut up racist
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:46.360]  I'm just done I mean it makes me want to throw up I mean I'm
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:50.360]  Guatemala folks I've been there is scared I had family that lived there for a
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:56.320]  decade I mean I've had I had two of my cousins separately kidnapped living down

[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  just this July 4th weekend but the entire month of July at maiden 1776 comm
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:59.480]  Molan Lobby you can take my gun from my cold dead ants
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:06.240]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:13.680]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network I'm gonna
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.800]  break down the bottom line on Russia here in a minute the latest and then go

[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:26.960]  help find extremist tea partiers and call the police so the secret police
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:32.040]  spy systems going into high gear islamic state orders female genital
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:37.880]  mutilation in Mosul that will affect four million women who will have their
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:42.400]  sexual organ chopped off but of course you won't hear the cause to live Hollywood
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:47.080]  talking about that because the big global scripture funding ISIS islamic
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:51.920]  state and a mutilate four million women analysts Germany secretly planning to
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:55.760]  join bricks that is a huge story we're gonna be breaking down the effect of
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:01.320]  that why is Walmart preparing for a major earthquake on the new Madrid fault line
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:05.320]  they confirm they are preparing for a massive mega quake in the middle of the
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:12.120]  country as the super caldera in Colorado starts becoming more active is this why
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.440]  the plane was shot down we're gonna break that down in a minute MH 17 now they
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:21.520]  have multiple sources and radar tracking looks conclusive that they had
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:26.520]  fighter jets shadowing it not to intimidate it into the airspace but to
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:33.640]  then bomb thinking the rebels wouldn't fire on it that's just some of the news
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:42.240]  upon info wars calm and prison planet calm but let's get into the Russian news
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:48.160]  right now first off the reason I'm for national sovereignty even though most
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:52.200]  governments are pretty corrupt and bad is the global corporate government is
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:57.360]  anti-free market anti-human technocratic a scientific dictatorship in their own
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:03.040]  words who want to fundamentally reduce population forcibly and bring in a
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:08.640]  global tyranny so they are the most threatening scientifically evil
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:15.200]  anti-human elite the world has ever seen I made a film about them it's called
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.200]  endgame eight years ago it's evergreen today if you want to understand their
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.520]  own quotes what they plan to do since 1850 and how they rule the planet right
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:27.160]  now pretty much they're trying to mop up a few sectors they don't fully control
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:33.640]  Russia I ran a few others is Iran good no their leaderships out of control in
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:39.640]  many cases is Russia good no their leadership is somewhat centralized
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:46.520]  kleptocratic strongman compared to the globalist though Russia is a totally
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:51.520]  different animal it the Russia does not want to kill humanity the Russian
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.680]  leadership is not want to exterminate their population the Russian elite are
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:03.360]  totally different and in a primitive strongman nationalistic model on record
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:07.520]  that's what they are and in a nationalistic strongman Russia that's
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:12.640]  free market is light years better than communism and light years better than
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:21.000]  Sovietism subitization and light year upon light year better than the globalist
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.440]  synthetic death now that said what are firewalls in a building or a ship if
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:32.520]  there's a fire in the engine room it's contained by big firewalls that can
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:38.040]  handle three four thousand five thousand degrees so you don't get the whole ship
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:43.680]  sinking or the whole building burning down that's what a firewall is or it's
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.480]  like a bulkhead the ship if water gets into one area it can't flood all the
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:52.200]  bulkheads and compartments so if you get a Hitler he takes over a few countries
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:57.240]  but gets stopped by other nations sometimes by bad nations like Russia at
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:04.720]  the time run by styling one evil fights another evil the globalist want to
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:08.320]  bring down Russia they've paid off China they pretty much control China though
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:12.120]  China is someone independent and has its nukes and plans to double deal as well
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:16.560]  there are three power blocks but China is more in bed with the globalist than
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.360]  Russia Russia is someone in bed with them and I've studied the whole history of
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:27.560]  it that's why I'm against using radical Islamic al-Qaeda groups to destabilize
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:32.000]  Russia and take over a bunch of its former satellites and countries that
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.680]  are part of Russia proper for a thousand years what is known as you know the old
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:42.480]  Russian Empire and the proto Russian Empire you go back close to a thousand
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:47.920]  years ago the Orthodox Church basically is is Russia and of course the
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.600]  communists tried to get rid of that when they were there now notice it's back
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:57.000]  and it's not state run so Russia is just rediscovering itself with all its
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.880]  problems but all its glory instead of being a Rothschild Rockefeller run
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:05.280]  fiefdom and they've kicked out all the Rothschild fronts and the Rothschilds
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:08.720]  sued British newspapers when they said that this oligarch was a Rothschild
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:13.240]  front and that oligarch was a Rockefeller front they sued they went on in
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:18.640]  court for three years they lost and the court said wow this hearing and this
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:25.680]  trial actually found the claims were true you are a puppet master what is the
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:31.160]  what does the spider want to do it doesn't want to be revealed who did the
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:36.720]  Rothschilds fund you can look it up Adolf Alois Hitler not because they
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.840]  were Nazis they would they had wrecked Europe before funding both sides it's
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:47.440]  beyond the evil that we normally see it's cold-blooded scientific look at the
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:53.480]  brakes in the pool game and decide you're gonna be both players or all
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:57.480]  three players or all four players and the minute people get this it'll be so
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:03.960]  simple but still so complex you'll go why didn't I ever see that before see
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:07.520]  we're supposed to take the side of the immigrants and the media says you know if
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:11.040]  you have any Hispanic descent they're supposed to support totally open borders
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:14.280]  when Latin American companies are having wars with each other all the time
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:18.880]  they can't get along or you're supposed to take the side of you know let's kill
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:23.360]  all the brown people no you're supposed to rise above it see the full spectrum
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:28.360]  and then make the moral decision out of it but people don't even know how to make
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:33.360]  decisions now that's why they don't have geopolitical understanding
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:38.640]  historical understanding cultural understanding spiritual understanding and
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:45.560]  I come to the realization that even when I talked to big CEOs and really smart
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:49.120]  artists and famous people I mean some of the most famous people in the world I've
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:55.320]  I know personally even bigger than the people you've heard on this show by
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:00.840]  orders of magnitude as big as it gets in Hollywood as big as it gets in rock and
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:06.880]  roll and they're smart but they just go I don't believe I can affect change and
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:11.400]  it's too big and they they're mainly focused on their own hobbies they know
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.280]  a lot of what I'm saying is true but they just said there's nothing we can do
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:19.440]  or we'll see what happens I'm glad you're there but then I talked to the head
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:24.400]  of a major you know big five bank in confidence on on an airplane in first
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:30.680]  class for three hours and he said well I know you're somebody that keeps
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:35.240]  confidence is you don't you want to really talk laughing at me
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:45.720]  and he said the public will adapt to being slaves you always thought of
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.960]  evolution and I mean that in the sense of like cars evolve folks or ideas evolve
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:53.680]  you always think of social evolution as something better we think of it as
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:58.360]  something worse and you will lose humanity has failed and it was like I
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:02.560]  was talking to a space alien his hair was perfect his skin was perfect well he
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.800]  was 65 years old his suit was perfect when he got up he put his trench coat on
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:10.400]  it was perfectly put on and he just sat there with his briefcase under his arm
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.360]  a lot and just laughed at me looking me up and down when he walked off the plane
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:19.680]  he was a general and he was telling me you have failed he was a general of
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:24.840]  evil and that bank supports open borders and gun control and everything
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:29.280]  else and they want to bring down Russia well let me tell you you want to bring
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:34.160]  down Russia everything you do is evil I'm against you you want my guns I can
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:37.000]  intellectually show why it's bad to turn my guns in but I'm just automatically
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.360]  no I'm not I'm not turning my guns in you want fake environmental groups take
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:44.040]  property away I'm automatically against it you want me to eat GMO I'm

[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:55.040]  real simple you're for it I'm against it real simple default because you
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:59.720]  fundamentally are malfunctioning and are mentally ill to sit here and tell me
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:04.000]  that humanity has failed humanity is over and given up on everything and you
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.880]  think you're gonna get ahead by screwing everyone over and not giving them the
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:11.360]  tricks and not telling them the inside baseball and not telling them how the
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:16.440]  rabbit got pulled out of the hat and then when they don't know and you've screwed
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.520]  them up from birth with weaponized television you point your finger at them
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:23.000]  and say look they're a failure that's all gonna blow back on you and your
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.160]  family and already has and these guys don't even care about their kids they'll
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:30.760]  have five kids and hope one of them turns out okay to run the Empire that's
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:34.840]  how the elite does it you go out and you have five six seven kids you just throw
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:37.960]  them out there into boarding schools and prep schools and whichever one's the
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:41.080]  meanest and the smartest you make the head of the Empire and then you don't
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:46.600]  even talk to the other ones because I mean I'm able to run with the elite if I
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:50.120]  want to and I've been around it and I've seen it folks and it is the most cold
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:54.760]  blooded inhuman crap I have ever seen in my life what do you think British
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:59.680]  royalty does they don't even meet with most the kids they'll pick one or maybe
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:03.840]  two to run the show and then they do that again like vampires like head

[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.720]  overthrow the Russian government the West is trying to put horrible new
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:20.200]  governments in the prime minister just stepped down and he's got all these
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:25.400]  Nazi ties and that government's collapsing they destabilize that country
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:30.280]  that's immoral that's not America's job and it's not America doing it it's
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:35.160]  American money doing it and then it's in our name there aren't many countries
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:40.240]  left that aren't under globalist control and they're like firewalls once the
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:46.000]  globalists get full control there's nowhere for Edward Snowden to run I
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.280]  wish Guatemala was a free beautiful country I wish Nigeria was a free
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:58.840]  beautiful country I wish if there was a country of freedom-loving people that
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:03.560]  were with low crime or happy I wouldn't care if they were all brown I was a
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:07.640]  young man I'd move there and marry a brown woman and have little brown kids
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:13.120]  if it was a free country but it's not ladies and gentlemen those places don't
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:18.240]  exist anymore and Europe's becoming a tyranny the whole world is falling to
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:23.560]  third-world evil and what is third-world evil it's colonialism it's
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:29.840]  centralized control it's barbarism just like Europe was before the renaissance
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:33.560]  freedom has been so rare the renaissance wasn't perfect but it was
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:40.200]  better than what was there before 550 years ago I want renaissance I want
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:44.320]  freedom I want local shops local businesses I want local factories I
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:50.880]  want decentralization everything the globalist cell is poverty and fraud down
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:56.160]  the road you may get wealthy from it for a season but the wages of the new world
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:00.480]  order is serfdom let's go to AJ and Ohio thanks for holding you're on the
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:05.040]  year worldwide thank you for taking my call Alex I want renaissance and
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:10.760]  freedom as well the reason I'm calling I just had two quick comments the first
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:15.520]  one is as you always say you have about a 95 percent accuracy rating I'd say
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:20.280]  it's more like 98 however I think you're kind of wrong about one thing this
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:25.760]  morning and that is that they're gonna vote to take our guns but see I've been
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:30.000]  studying this for about eight years now and I started listening to you about
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.280]  three years ago I think God kind of put you in my path and I think there's a
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.600]  lot of way they're going after the guns they're gonna use bureaucracy they're
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:42.200]  gonna doesn't everybody is mentally ill they're going to prohibit the firearms
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:46.160]  themselves and the manufacturers they're gonna ban them at the state level I mean
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:50.120]  there's a cocktail of ways they're going after the guns executive orders banning
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:54.840]  importation okay well what do you think how am I wrong I think the way that it's
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:58.560]  gonna unfold is this okay they're bringing all the illegals and everything
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:03.280]  like that and we all know that they're gonna implode the economy but I see I
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.160]  think the end game is this once the economy implodes they're gonna bring in
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.280]  the UN and then it's gonna be martial alone at that point they're not gonna
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:14.800]  need the votes because UN is gonna make the rule no no I agree with you I ab or
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:18.960]  they'll nuke a city and Obama says that's his main fear remember I said the
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:25.840]  globalist are not below detonating a nuke and killing 200,000 people and
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:30.560]  radiating 5 million or 10 million to bring in total control and everything
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:35.240]  they're doing is a huge preparation for that and so yeah it's a collapsing
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:40.400]  Southwest nuke goes off in DC takes out a bunch of Congress the globalist might
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:45.960]  even take out Obama and then make him some saint I'm telling you we're in deep
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:50.000]  I mean can't you just feel the fact that the National Security Council and the
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.720]  globalists are just looking at all the scenarios to screw us over they don't
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:57.320]  want to miss this opportunity to take over and they know people are waking up
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:01.360]  to him man I tell you I can just feel it I can feel it I mean we're in grave
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:06.200]  danger and I believe that that that right there what you said the the nuke
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:09.020]  going off in the city I believe that that's what they're gonna do when it
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:12.880]  gets the situation when the UN takes over and it turns to revolution in this
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:16.800]  in this state that's how they're in this country they're gonna set off and say the
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:21.920]  Patriots did it US Army soldiers following the George Washington Brigade
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:27.640]  hit DC with a five megaton low yield taking out most of Congress during the
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:32.280]  State of the Union I for forces striking back with the new Republic of
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:37.480]  Freedom together with our allies from the South are moving in on the basis that
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:42.080]  have broken away in the coup I'm telling you the sky's the limit and there could
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:45.680]  be a double cross I don't think it'll be Russia they're massing Chinese troops
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.640]  and built the Chinese port in southern Mexico on the Pacific side they're
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:52.840]  gonna run a whole Chinese army right in here and that's come out in federal
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:58.680]  documents and then I see the whole thing everything but old CIA and FBI and
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:02.200]  Army officers told me when I was first on air and I thought these guys were all
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:06.040]  nuts even though they were who they said they were it's really the plan they're
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:10.280]  really gonna break this country and I mean it's just so hellish they plan on
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:13.000]  just getting rid of this country I'm telling you folks they're gonna just get
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.640]  rid of us of the new world order and the average idiot out there has no idea I'm
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:20.480]  not trying to scare him right now that's the funny thing that you should talk
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.760]  about the average idiot because my second comment was this I constantly
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:28.280]  constantly and putting out you know I write my own articles and things like
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:31.800]  that I'm a writer so I've been putting things out on Facebook trying to wake up

[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:38.920]  course if it's not about kittens or you know I'm so west side or whatever the
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:42.560]  things that they're doing now it doesn't make a difference to them so because

[01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:00.400]  what he talked about at the American hospital he predicted they had him on
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.320]  ice when rolling out somewhere in the future for political gain now Sy
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:08.720]  Hirsch has come out saying the entire bin Laden killing story was a fraud and I've
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:14.280]  had Navy SEALs families on that died who were part of all that shang it was a
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:18.640]  total fraud and it was a bin Laden double is what the SEALs have told them at
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:23.040]  that house so it was a real firefight but it was all staged that's why they had
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:27.480]  to later kill most of that team that were witnesses to that and court martial
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:31.560]  almost everybody on the ship that saw that nobody was dumped overboard and

[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:06.040]  geopolitical break up these countries but who runs our country our people
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:10.640]  targeting the Tea Party and targeting gun owners and setting up regular army
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:15.360]  for domestic operations and imploding the border and bringing in unlimited
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:21.400]  illegals and shutting down our power plants I see the political elite
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:27.760]  energetically trying to sabotage this country and only promote different
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:30.840]  combines that are part really the Democratic Party in my view and I know
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:35.040]  you're nonpartisan I don't like the Republican leadership either politically
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:37.840]  because you've been part of the CFR you name it in the past you resigned out of
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:43.120]  it what a council on farm relations what do you think of Obama and this
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:47.600]  political elite and what they're doing domestically so we can then move to the
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:51.800]  international level dr. Pashenek thanks for joining us well I think Obama is not
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:56.720]  a tutored individual in terms of domestic concerns I think he has a staff
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:02.400]  that has not been performing very well but to attribute a lot of the various
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:06.440]  deeds and you know I've criticized Obama from the beginning with Newtown and
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:12.320]  Eric Holden all that I think we have to understand that there is a political
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:17.080]  elite but it's really diverse it goes from Silicon Valley to business man it
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:21.800]  goes from the right wing to the left wing so we're too big a country to be
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:27.040]  contained or suppressed you know I've said it from 9-11 that eventually the
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:31.320]  American public would understand what happened in 9-11 Bush and Cheney and the
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:36.680]  Neopons would pay the price and they are we went from zero people understanding
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:41.560]  it to over 60% of the country 13 years thanks to you Alex and the people in the
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:45.960]  alternative media we got the truth out the reality of the truth now is that
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:50.440]  FEMA is not as effective as they are Obamacare is not going to work that
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:54.680]  effectively a lot of the things that they've targeted it has been overblown
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:37:00.200]  but the reality of America is that we are very incredibly powerful as an
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:05.520]  entity the people itself we're diversified we're located over huge
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:10.560]  geographic expanse we're multivariate we contain over a hundred different
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:15.920]  ethnic groups and so it's very hard to begin to understand that Washington is
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:20.720]  becoming less and less relevant what's becoming more relevant domestically and
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:24.320]  this is what the American public has to understand through the Alex Jones show is
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:28.640]  the governor's and the Congress understands this that's why congressmen
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:32.920]  are leaving senators are leaving even big businesses leaving because they have
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:37.760]  to develop their power to the state level the states are becoming incredibly
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:42.280]  more powerful if the American public wants to be effective they have to work
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:46.240]  for their governors their local commissioners their ward cabinets that's
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:49.760]  where politics has been going and I'm not concerned about the federal
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:53.920]  government at the local level or domestic what I am concerned and I think
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:57.520]  this is fair because everybody understood that I have criticized Obama
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:02.480]  domestically and farm policy but this fast weekend has been an amazing turn
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:06.880]  around in the Obama administration where he has to receive credit at least from
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.800]  somebody like me who's worked for both Republicans and Democrats and what
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:15.640]  happened even with the Malaysian airline and the war in Gaza by the Israelis is
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:21.720]  that Obama quietly allied himself with Iran now that's 35 years that I've been
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:27.240]  waiting since I was involved in the Iran hostage siege where Jimmy Carter lost it
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:32.680]  and we lost the embassy we lost Iranian influence but in the meantime Iran has
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:38.800]  been helping US military forces for the past ten years to assist us in Iraq and
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.160]  to assist us in Afghanistan and more importantly Iran has assisted us in
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:48.880]  evacuating from Iraq and Afghanistan and quietly Obama in the administration has
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:54.200]  recognized that fact and understand very well that Iran will be the dominant
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:59.680]  Middle Eastern power for the Shiites and Turkey will be the dominant Middle East
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:05.320]  power for the Sunni Israel has become a strategic liability as general Petraeus
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:10.240]  said two years ago and it's evidencing it now with Hamas which is not a war of
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:15.800]  terror it is that major invasion into Gaza and they have a major problem with
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:20.680]  not only Hamas which they by the way created 25 years ago they funded it and
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:24.440]  they have all the Palestinian operatives who are in their prison and they
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:28.560]  know that they've doubled them up but they also know that Hezbollah is on the
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:34.280]  north and Lebanon also funded by Iran Israel failed in their intelligence they
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:38.280]  knew very well the intelligence that the arms were coming from Iran to Sudan
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:43.040]  Sudan each of Egypt to Gaza they waited they had a year's worth of
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:46.720]  assessments on the tunnels they knew the tunnels but they didn't have a good
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:51.160]  assessment of the fighting capacity of Hamas which turned out not to be terrorist
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:56.240]  but insurgents who were fully armed fully disciplined extremely well organized
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:01.920]  well on and Israel failed and the reason it is failing is because every time an
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:06.240]  Israeli soldier dies and this is not what I wish for and I warn them don't do
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:12.760]  this it is equal to 30 American soldiers so basically 30 Israeli elite units of
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:18.280]  the Galani unit had died that's 900 special forces American soldiers who
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:23.720]  have died in less than a week that is not tenable for Israel it's not tenable
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:28.880]  for the political legitimacy of the state and BB has failed he has failed in
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:32.840]  the same way historically that Moshe Diane understood you have to make a
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:38.440]  session even his mentor Sharon who didn't like BB and detested him and was far
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:43.320]  a greater military hero said we have to pull out of Gaza and in the same way
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:49.400]  that he failed when he invaded into Lebanon in 2006 at Hezbollah with 800
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:54.040]  soldiers was able to decimate thousands of Israeli soldiers Dr. Bachanik can I
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:58.080]  just add a point here you know I'm neutral on this I understand it's a very
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:03.280]  diverse tribal warfare situation over there and there's a lot of vitriol on
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:11.360]  both sides but when I see the kind of Benjamin Netanyahu think tank groups
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:18.720]  attacking anybody including Jews who have any opinion on Israel outside of
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:23.600]  theirs it concerns me because I don't have any ill will towards Israel Israel's
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.320]  not going anywhere has upwards of 800 nuclear weapons high-tech and as you
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:32.400]  know you know the globalist are playing a double game with the Palestinians
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:36.760]  manipulating things for whatever strategy of tension but when you start
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:42.360]  seeing Israeli professors in the news and Israeli's cheering dead kids and you
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:46.880]  know saying hey let's rape Palestinian women it's all and then these are real
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:51.840]  Israelis not Palestinian operatives if I was a Palestinian operative I would
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:56.560]  pose as Jews and say these horrible things losing a propaganda war and
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:00.560]  that's what concerns me because I don't want nuclear war and Israel more and
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:07.480]  more the leadership is taking on a stubborn obstinate invincibility attitude
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:12.840]  of we'll do whatever we want and it really concerns me correct and the
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:17.400]  and the issue that I said is that they have a problem that's basically from
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:22.840]  immaturity in terms of a country that never developed I'm a Holocaust Jew
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:27.720]  BB knows very well that those of us who died in the Holocaust including the
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:33.280]  Warsaw ghetto would never were co-opted by Zionism and I grew up in the
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:37.880]  battalion and the job with 10 scheme and I come back and this is not the state
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:42.720]  that was created in terms of Judaism this is the state that was created by
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:47.360]  bingurian in terms of the state of concept called Zionism which about
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:52.880]  Hamas understands the PLO understands the British understand in America what's
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:58.520]  happening now is Israel will lose its credibility at the Jewish state because
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:02.960]  most of the Jews in America and around the world will not accept the
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:08.240]  ignominious behavior of the Israelis continuously slaughtering innocent
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:12.960]  children and women it's a repetition compulsion that they have been invested
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:17.280]  in now let me put it in perspective what you said is correct Alex over the past
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:21.920]  30 years I was involved tangentially in taking down a part site but it was taken
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:28.280]  down by Bush and Baker quietly so blacks in South Africa aren't power we were I
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:33.120]  was involved directly in taking down the Soviet Union 30 years ago under Reagan
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:38.400]  and Baker and Bush and what happened we didn't fire a shot and yet the Soviet
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:43.560]  Union became Russia and Russia is growing we were involved directly under the
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:47.920]  Bush Reagan administration even Carter and allowing China to become an
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:53.360]  economic force and transforming from communism to basically capitalism now
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:57.680]  you're telling me in 60 years with the greatest brainpower that allegedly we
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:02.560]  Jews have we have not been able to get away from this incredible immature
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:08.520]  psychotic that pattern of behavior that Israel has to continuously fight against
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:14.400]  PLO Hamas his below or anybody around them with this paranoid notion that they
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:18.840]  can't make peace yet we've been able United States and the Jews in America
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:23.240]  as well as Christians and Muslims and others have been able to incorporate
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:28.040]  peace all over the world but not with Israel so Israel is headed towards
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:32.560]  self-destruction and that's really what you're saying but more importantly what
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:38.240]  Israel understands is that as Obama moves to Iran and by the way Obama is not
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:42.920]  anti-stimidic because Rami Emmanuel worked in the IDF and his father when
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:48.360]  they go to say Lumi Rami Emmanuel Michelle's cousin is an Orthodox Jewish
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:53.640]  rabbi the first black one so any notion that he's anti-stimidic is nonsense but
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:59.200]  strategically and in terms of tactics the CIA our military intelligence were
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:04.120]  very effective in making an alliance with Iran we will denuclearize the
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:08.960]  capability of making an alliance with Turkey allowing Iraq to become what it
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:12.880]  should have been and Biden by the way said it correctly years ago it's a
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:17.780]  federalized country that means we are taking apart we the United States of
[01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:22.000]  America and its own power is taking apart what the British and the French did
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:27.960]  in the Sykes-Bicot Treaty of 1917 and that is we're taking apart Syria now
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:32.320]  you're gonna have ISIS which we have funded that's part of our data and by
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:38.040]  the way BB Netanyahu has funded these Sunnis as well because he wants to get
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:42.640]  in there and so every notion that BB is against terrorism is nonsense
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:47.760]  remember he created Hamas he's worked with the PLO he's protected Arafat and
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:51.840]  the Israelis had fought against Hezbollah and now they make peace so they
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:56.400]  have to come to peace now the second part is what countries have lost in all
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:46:01.800]  of this Saudi Arabia the creation of British intelligence particularly
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:07.720]  Gertrude Bell and Lawrence of Arabia and basically this is Wahhabism but it was
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:13.000]  never an effective country on the Lusulimani Federation of Seven Suns they
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.640]  have not been able to grow develop or develop has Saudi Arabia figured out that
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:22.160]  large power blocks in the West plan on breaking their country up well they
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:25.680]  figured it out and if right now what they're doing is helping Israel and
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:30.000]  basically encouraging Israel to attack the PLO because Saudi Arabia is never
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.200]  never cared about the Palestinians even I worked on the West Bank and I went into
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:40.960]  the different Palestinian camps the Saudis always used it as a pawn so the
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:45.720]  hypocrisy of Saudi Arabia and the hypocrisy of setting up Al Qaeda and
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:51.680]  Haqqani and funding all these right-wing extremists Sunni extremists is coming back
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:56.280]  to hurt Saudi Arabia so we have effectively deflected entire Al Qaeda
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:01.960]  Haqqani networks against the Saudi Arabian machinery and Royal House which
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:06.600]  is really not an institution and they will eventually devolve they will be
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:12.240]  out of power because the eastern part of Saudi Arabia is run by Shiites and there
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:16.520]  were there are now conflicts there and Saudi Arabia understand that it's 40%
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:20.600]  couldn't we just see overnight a collapse of Riyadh one day and the
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:25.960]  princes all in their big 777s running with all their loot to Paris yes they're
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:29.880]  all in Marbella they have Swiss bank accounts they're here in America they're
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:33.560]  totally corrupt they know it we know what the world knows it but they're not a
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:37.920]  country they were never a country they were centralized point of a very
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:41.700]  fundamentalist sect that didn't even really relate to the Quran the Holy
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:46.640]  Quran and they were called Wahhabis and they claim they were the patrons or the
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:50.440]  guardians of Mecca Medina while I get breaking up Iraq as it was always in
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:55.160]  three parts before but but here's my problem you don't use Islamic State a
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:59.800]  bunch of crazies to do it or blowing up all the churches that I mean that makes
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:04.480]  the West just proves it's like using the ring of Mordor and you cannot use the
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:09.480]  ring and have it turn into good I agree with you now the issue of Christianity
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:13.000]  is something I brought up on your show three years ago and I have asked the
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.440]  Coptics to prepare for this I'd ask the Geneva Convention of churches to be
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:23.680]  aware of this no one stood up to defend the Christians in Syria or anywhere else
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:27.640]  the Middle East and I helped to write a book called out of the ashes with a
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:32.320]  last-time plan C book which has to do with the explode of the Christians but
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:36.960]  that is not an issue of the ISIS ISIS has been a product of the American
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:42.440]  Israeli and Sunni Turkish as well as Saudi Arabian involvement to create a
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:48.160]  caliphate where they can control some of Syria break up Iraq and then
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:53.480]  eventually they have to come to terms at peace with Jews and Christian minorities
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:57.320]  which they're trying to do I do not defend the caliphate but basically what's
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:03.400]  happening is our total reorganization of the Middle East by America and the
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:07.880]  influence of this the president and his vice president Biden who was accused by
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:12.920]  Robert Gates the director of the CIA is being stupid General Stanley McChrystal
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:18.120]  is being stupid and and Petraeus yet this is the only man who predicted 10 to
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:23.200]  20 years ago that we would have a breakup of Iraq we were never going to
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:26.720]  build a nation and Iraq we would never that's clearly been the plan is getting
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:31.360]  it weak the whole time to do that I mean clearly the plan has been get Iraq week
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.440]  the whole time to do that it's a clear program of vulcanization well it was
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:40.280]  after the bush chain in the neocons we wanted to break it up because it had no
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:44.640]  viability as a centralized organization all right sir we got to go to break I
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:47.920]  want to come back and shift gears over to Russia and briefly find out what you
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:50.640]  think about the whole shoot down the plan and get your perspective on that but
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:54.440]  briefly what do you think of them refusing to enforce border laws and
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:58.280]  just opening the border up wide open I think Obama could use this as a crisis
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:02.520]  to power grab no I don't think so I don't think well Obama really needs to have a
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:06.080]  power grab he's already been in an executive expansion without a power
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:10.120]  grab basically I always believe that these children should be brought back to
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:14.560]  their home country the real culprit in this is Mexico Mexico should never have
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:17.880]  allowed them a transit point because if I want to go into Mexico and become a
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:22.960]  Mexican citizen it's almost impossible for no I know so why is Mexico doing that
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:27.160]  because Mexico wants to put pressure on our borders for them to get more money
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:30.640]  for us to help them out find out that's it they've been demanding a Marshall plan
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:35.480]  so they're holding us ransom correct yeah it's just all right there well I
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:39.320]  can't argue with any of that well it's money yeah Alex it's always follow the

[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:05.400]  Pachennick thank you for giving us the perspective of what the establishment
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:08.520]  thinks they're doing with this and I can agree with what you're saying because we
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:12.600]  can see it unfolding and see what the think tanks are saying piecemeal putting
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:20.280]  together but specifically with Russia and what's happening there and in George
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:23.000]  Soros and the rest of it over there what do you think about what happened with
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:29.040]  the MH 17 you know first you have to remember Malaysia is that what I call
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:34.120]  a pimp country it is run by the Kenting group which is a huge investment in the
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:38.160]  United States again it's money issues they run the casinos of Miami
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:43.000]  Pennsylvania and New York they run the cruise ships the Norwegian cruise ship
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:47.720]  the bimini line they came out of the drug smuggling business there's still a
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:53.720]  very very nefarious country which will do anything for money and will will work
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:58.960]  with us or anybody else so the issue of down plane is not as significant to me
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:03.920]  as the issue of what it means in terms of the United States and Russia but again
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:08.640]  I hate to say this but what Obama did on behalf of this administration was to
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:13.400]  create economic sanctions now I agree with that because we don't need to go to
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:18.080]  war our country is tired of sending boys to Iraq and Afghanistan thanks to Bush
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:21.920]  and Cheney who never went to war but instead we did something much more
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:28.920]  effective we lowered the rubble we forced an economic flood of money out of
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:34.640]  close to a hundred billion dollars of investment money out of Russia we forced
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:39.520]  that at the indices of the market to go down the Russians are hurting economically
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:43.600]  they will hurt economically and the reason we can do this is because they
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:47.080]  the only product they can sell on the open market is a hundred dollars a
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:53.040]  barrel of oil now having done that what happens is Putin has been put up there
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:57.840]  by the CIA and other intelligence units you got to understand nothing happened
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:02.120]  in Russia the world without our CIA and our intelligence community helping to
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:06.520]  put it there and in the respect we want Putin out and what's happening it's three
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:11.240]  divisions of his intelligence service that's the FSB which he was head of the
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:17.640]  KGB and the SVR which is the foreign intelligence plus they the GRU their
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:21.960]  military intelligence has been fighting over the fact that Putin has not been
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:26.640]  able to economically maintain a stability in Russia and in turn they're
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:30.160]  the ones who deal with the economic fallout because they're the ones who do
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:34.160]  anti-corruption work but they are involved in corruption and in turn they're
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:38.600]  fighting among each other and what you saw in the Ukraine was the GRU FSB
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:42.720]  fighting among them each other it's very much like our military intelligence
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:47.200]  fight for the CIA a much more lethal because the head of that is Putin and
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:52.120]  Putin is hurting because we forced him to stretch out all the way into Ukraine
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:56.840]  remember the Ukraine in and of itself has no basic value to us in terms of
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:01.080]  strategic force structure it really doesn't impact on you so it's a proxy
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:06.560]  war like Afghanistan well it's even less than that because it Afghanistan was
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:11.520]  totally desolate here we have a 15 billion liability in other words the
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:15.520]  minute we pick up the Ukraine despite what everybody says we have a dead
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:20.760]  asset that is not worth 15 billion but we have well you cut off Russian gas and
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:24.560]  then make them buy it from the US well we can do that but that was because of
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:27.780]  Bella but we don't need hey what doc do five more minutes with us and I promise

[02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:47.100]  our guest your calls are coming up not finishing up with what's happening with
[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:51.380]  Putin. I mean I know that there were deals with Yeltsin for the so-called
[02:00:51.380 --> 02:00:55.860]  collapse of Soviet Union I know that there were deals with Putin early on
[02:00:55.860 --> 02:01:00.860]  then he went after a bunch of the oligarchs European oligarchs and others
[02:01:00.860 --> 02:01:07.540]  and my whole issue is I don't really see Russia trying to expand anywhere and I
[02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:11.980]  don't want a unipolar world I mean I want to see sovereign nations out there
[02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:16.300]  operating off their trade I don't like communist China that's who I really see
[02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:21.340]  as being just nightmarishly oppressive I get they've got a huge population but I
[02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:26.300]  mean are you endorsing the toppling of Putin and putting something else in. Yes
[02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:30.700]  I think it's time for Putin to leave but I don't have to endorse anything basically
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:35.620]  what's happening is Putin spent 14 years in the Soviet and Russian unit he was
[02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:41.060]  trained by Marcus Wolf by the way he was a Jewish spymaster who was
[02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:46.940]  appointed by Stalin and Marcus Wolf. He was the head of the Stasi. He was head of
[02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:51.100]  Stasi but also you have to understand Putin was really trained by Stasi in
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:55.420]  East Germany that's why he and Merkel really get along very well but Putin
[02:01:55.420 --> 02:02:00.940]  has no strategic sense and he is becoming too counterproductive to really
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:04.500]  world trade and what we're interested in and quite frankly America's not
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:08.460]  interested in war we're interested in world trade and as you said China is
[02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:11.380]  expanding very quickly they're expanding in the Indian Ocean the
[02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:16.260]  Middle East and Africa and world trade and we want to compete with that. Hey
[02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:19.860]  by the way sometime I'll tell the whole audience a story one time they said they
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:24.900]  wanted me on like Interfax national Russian television and when they punched
[02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:29.580]  up the Skype for the interview the video feed was this big giant government
[02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:36.020]  hall and all these like obvious FSB people but like the brain bugs not like
[02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:40.020]  the knuckle-draggers all like interrogating me it wasn't for TV
[02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:45.060]  asking about you and why you came on my show and I said I don't know but then
[02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:47.500]  they started getting real paranoid thinking I was an Asian or something
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:51.580]  what do you want to say to them? I don't want to say anything I want to say
[02:02:51.580 --> 02:02:57.020]  all the best to you you know what you have to do you take out Putin and the
[02:02:57.020 --> 02:03:00.940]  rest is you want your money and you want to be able to come to the United
[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:04.220]  States you want to be able to come to Switzerland and Europe so get rid of
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:07.380]  Putin that's it. Well that was a couple years ago that happened but it was
[02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:12.780]  really weird. Alex it's always continuing Russia and Catherine the Great has always
[02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:16.940]  been an internal turmoil and remember the Soviet Union was a hundred and twenty
[02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:21.860]  two countries Russian Federation is eleven times out right now it is huge
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:26.940]  and Putin can't control it I mean it economically it has to develop beyond
[02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:31.860]  the oil and gas and it can't. Yeah but the Russians like a strong man he makes
[02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:36.420]  some feel good all the polls show that. Well that's up till now until they get
[02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:40.460]  very hungry and they realize that they don't have the Germans coming in for
[02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:44.300]  technology they don't have the American investments on technology to extract the
[02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:48.700]  oil out of the barren straits and they don't have their access points out of
[02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:52.620]  the Crimea. Now the one thing we did agree to when the take down of Soviet
[02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:56.700]  Union is that Crimea belongs to the Russia and we never argued over that
[02:03:56.700 --> 02:04:00.260]  point and they knew that the Russians know that unfortunately we should never
[02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:04.580]  have ever made Crimea a point because that's their only exit point for their
[02:04:04.580 --> 02:04:08.260]  well no it's meant to force them into a larger conflict. That's correct it was
[02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:12.860]  agitation propaganda rightfully wrongfully our CIA effectively created
[02:04:12.860 --> 02:04:17.620]  agitprop an economic warfare. Here's the deal I don't like the government agitproping my
[02:04:17.620 --> 02:04:21.460]  guns my property or my children and that's why I don't like people running
[02:04:21.460 --> 02:04:24.820]  this country and that's why you know I just don't support anything they're up
[02:04:24.820 --> 02:04:30.100]  to. Well remember we're a democracy and we were based on a revolution Alex
[02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:34.620]  that revolution is always innate in our in our genetics. I agree we should take
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:38.980]  the country back. Well we are taking it back as I said to you the devolution of
[02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:43.140]  power is negating the two parties we don't need the group Democrats and we
[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:46.300]  don't need the republicans. Quite frankly we don't depress them. This has been one of
[02:04:46.300 --> 02:04:49.260]  our best talks thank you Dr. Steve Pachennick I hope you're having a nice
[02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:52.460]  week StevePachennick.com. Thank you very much. Thank you we'll talk to you again
[02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:56.020]  soon. All right we got Professor Hamamoto coming up and if the callers want to hold
[02:04:56.020 --> 02:05:03.780]  I promise I'll get to you stay with us. Hi I'm Dr. Edward Grobe it took me 20
[02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:09.100]  years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:16.780]  available. The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the
[02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:22.580]  earth in pristine environmentally clean conditions. The iodine crystals we use
[02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:29.980]  are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the
[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:37.060]  earth. It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today. It delivers 650
[02:05:37.060 --> 02:05:42.980]  micrograms per drop. Experience the new formula. Experience the ancient purity.

[02:05:58.580 --> 02:06:03.500]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water. I can taste
[02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:07.660]  dirt in it. God knows what's in there. These people just sampled City of Austin
[02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:11.820]  tap water straight from the faucet. Next we had them try a sample of tap water
[02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:17.180]  filtered with a Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system. That one is better. Tastes like
[02:06:17.180 --> 02:06:20.740]  nothing. Yep, I know what good water tastes like. It's good water. Most tap water
[02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:25.620]  contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate and many others.
[02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:29.460]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health
[02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:33.740]  issues including tooth decay, lower IQ and even cancer. It tastes like you're
[02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:38.460]  drinking out of the lake when you're in tap water. The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration
[02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:43.140]  system removes these deadly substances leaving only fresh tasting deliciously
[02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:47.620]  clean water. Okay, this is very tasty. It's good water. Refreshing. It's good. Go to

[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:05.580]  because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify. Most
[02:07:05.580 --> 02:07:10.340]  people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world. Iodine
[02:07:10.340 --> 02:07:15.620]  is key to so many of the body's functions especially the thyroid. I discovered
[02:07:15.620 --> 02:07:20.500]  a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield true
[02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:24.860]  nascent iodine that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago he said
[02:07:24.860 --> 02:07:29.060]  listen if you think this is powerful I'm going to come out with rare earth deep
[02:07:29.060 --> 02:07:33.980]  earth crystals and the results that I personally have had have been life
[02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:39.340]  changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals ladies and
[02:07:39.340 --> 02:07:43.820]  gentlemen. This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund Infowars.com
[02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:48.020]  the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian

[02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:56.820]  The sands of time for me and for you are running low running low
[02:08:56.820 --> 02:09:22.820]  I saw Megadeth and Iron Maiden last year out on the racetrack. I was invited. I got to say it was the best Megadeth concert I ever saw. Iron Maiden wasn't too good but this is certainly a good song right here. I saw Iron Maiden when I was about 14 it was awesome. It's all how their sound is that night. That's an epic song right there.
[02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:45.820]  Running low. We just had Dr. Steve Pachinicon with us. What a character. That guy has been involved in almost everything. And with him on the air with us you get a specific bird's eye view into the larger geopolitical operations that are being carried out.
[02:09:45.820 --> 02:10:05.820]  And just yes the west runs Al Qaeda yes and ISIS and yes they're breaking the country up of Iraq and yes we help put Putin in with deals with the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and now we've told him he has to go and you know these three groups of the FSB know that's the thing to go but the others don't.
[02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:20.820]  I mean that time I was telling that story last hour where I'd been on Russian TV probably. Let's not exaggerate 75 times. I've been on Japanese TV probably 20 30 times British TV probably 40 times.
[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:30.820]  You know I've been on Canadian TV probably 30 40 times. So I go on national TV if it's easy and quick. I don't go on Iranian TV. It's just a big hassle and I'm time to do it and they call me every day if I go on it.
[02:10:30.820 --> 02:10:41.820]  You know they have that press TV thing. But this time they want to be on national Russian TV whatever the biggest channel was. It's a state run one.
[02:10:41.820 --> 02:10:52.820]  And it goes to the Skype interview and it wasn't an interview. These aren't reporters and it was all these obvious government people wanting to talk about Steve Pachennik with me.
[02:10:52.820 --> 02:11:00.820]  And I just you know who he is. You know what he's done. Yeah I get his view on things. Why does he talk to you.
[02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:06.820]  They were asking me questions about him and I said look I can't answer any questions about Steve Pachennik.
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:14.820]  And it was right after that a bunch of stuff went on. But I tell you they do not like Steve Pachennik.
[02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:22.820]  He's from Russia. He was like a Russian Jew that got grabbed his family down in the concentration camps. He never even talks about that.
[02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:29.820]  But that's why he criticizes Israel. People should listen because he's such an interesting person and had a lot of tragedy in his life.
[02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:34.820]  So that's why we have him on the show. He's offered to come to town before if we don't show his face on air.
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:39.820]  But I just I don't think I want to get that deep into it. It'd be interesting to get him over here though.
[02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:47.820]  But I don't know why I'm going off into all that. The weirdness I've seen in 20 years of doing this show.
[02:11:47.820 --> 02:11:52.820]  It's just about 20 years now in a few months be 20 years. I got to look up the some of the history.
[02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:58.820]  But I think we should have like a celebration or something 20 years of the Info War to not celebrate my show or even me.
[02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:05.820]  But you know the fact that we've had 20 years on air and had this big of an effect. It's a testament to everybody else's power.
[02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:15.820]  And that's really my goal here is to let you know historically through all cultures but also now and this time that we live that fortune favors the bold.
[02:12:15.820 --> 02:12:25.820]  And there is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune to quote William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
[02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:28.820]  But Charlton has to know I just watched again the other night.
[02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:34.820]  But the fortune I'm looking for is not a bigger house or not the fanciest car.
[02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:42.820]  Though I do want that new 700 horsepower Dodge Challenger Stingray but so affordable for the price beats Lamborghinis and Ferrari folks.
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:48.820]  And it's like $55,000. But side issue. I'm sorry. I got to go to our guests. I apologize.
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:54.820]  The point here is that my brass ring is not money. It's not success.
[02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:59.820]  I've had plenty of time to learn to not like being a public figure.
[02:12:59.820 --> 02:13:08.820]  Any enjoyment of that has exited the building a long time ago. The narcissism has exited the building and now really I just want the goal of empowering humanity.
[02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:11.820]  That's what thrills me is teaching people things and learning things.
[02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:18.820]  I know that's what thrills people like Professor Hamamoto who we're going to be talking to here in just a moment for the balance of the hour and taking your phone calls.
[02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:28.820]  But long story short what I'm getting at here is you have power. You can affect change. You've just got to have the courage to do it.
[02:13:28.820 --> 02:13:42.820]  Because of a rag tag guy from Texas with no fancy college education and really not a lot of connections could effectively reach 20 million people a week in the burgeoning new media that grew in the last 20 years.
[02:13:42.820 --> 02:13:49.820]  What could you do? And that's what Professor Daryl Hamamoto talked about two or three weeks ago when he was on with us.
[02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:58.820]  A very popular guest I enjoyed talking to him was that the revolution, the true renaissance is here and it is a velvet revolution of ideas.
[02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:03.820]  And he's hitting the bar bar early and has been I know persecuted some at the university.
[02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:08.820]  He had him threatened to pick out his pay because he's been the head of the Asian American studies.
[02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:12.820]  He's the senior ranking professor in the Department of Asian American Studies.
[02:14:12.820 --> 02:14:15.820]  I won't go over his whole bio again. He's taught at the University of California.
[02:14:15.820 --> 02:14:22.820]  He's famous for most of his academic career. He holds undergraduate and graduate degrees, political science, popular culture studies and comparative culture.
[02:14:22.820 --> 02:14:26.820]  Hamamoto is a senior ranking professor in the Department of Asian American Studies.
[02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:29.820]  He's a recognized authority in U.S. media. He's seen on national television.
[02:14:29.820 --> 02:14:33.820]  Popular culture and sexuality having published extensively in these areas.
[02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:38.820]  He's a recipient of a Rockefeller Foundation research fellowship and is a Fulbright scholar.
[02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:46.820]  His current project is a volume that outlines the principles of the New World Order theory and is directed in the current generation college,
[02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:53.820]  university undergraduates in search of alternatives to the dominant foundation guided corporate as curriculum.
[02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:57.820]  So we have plenty of time with him. I'm going to skip this network break coming up.
[02:14:57.820 --> 02:15:01.820]  He'll be so polite. He'll pause constantly and I'll rush in and take over like a wolf.
[02:15:01.820 --> 02:15:05.820]  But I want you to talk about whatever you want to first. Did you get any repercussions coming on?
[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:11.820]  What do you make of all the stuff happening with Russia? What's your take on the border crisis expanding?
[02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:16.820]  Since you were on it's confirmed it's premeditated. Thank you for joining us, sir.
[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:23.820]  Thank you very much. All the reactions and responses that I've been receiving have been 100% positive.
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:24.820]  Wow.
[02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:31.820]  That's unusual. I assume that the university administration is not paying much attention at this point.
[02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:37.820]  They're narrowly focused on illustrating what remains of public education.
[02:15:37.820 --> 02:15:42.820]  Once they've removed that, then the rest of the society will fall.
[02:15:42.820 --> 02:15:52.820]  And part of their strategy is this engineered border crisis that I will speak to today, hopefully, for your readers, for your viewers,
[02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:54.820]  nationally, internationally.
[02:15:54.820 --> 02:16:02.820]  Add a little bit of insight so far as academic research is concerned to expand our critical lexicon here.
[02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:03.820]  Go ahead. Go ahead.
[02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:13.820]  Yeah, because it goes beyond the term cloward, or the phrase cloward and piven is a shorthand for this sort of left progressive strategy
[02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:22.820]  intensifying conflict so that the economic system, the culture, society will implode, will self-destruct.
[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:32.820]  And of course, the objective here is to assure in some form of centralized corporate government, socialist, if you will, government.
[02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:37.820]  This is classic Leninism, by the way, the notion that everything has to get worse before it gets better.
[02:16:37.820 --> 02:16:40.820]  This is the part that they leave out.
[02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:43.820]  So that's important. That's an important framework to understand.
[02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:53.820]  But I want to more specifically introduce another pair of ass clowns from academia by the name of Rosaldo and Ong.
[02:16:53.820 --> 02:16:56.820]  Rosaldo Ong is spelled O-N-G.
[02:16:56.820 --> 02:17:07.820]  The Rosaldo element covers the Latino population of illegal aliens and the mass influx of population from Latin America.
[02:17:07.820 --> 02:17:16.820]  And the Ong component addresses the large influx of impoverished Asians, which are going to be the next phase of it.
[02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:17.820]  I don't know when that's going to happen.
[02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:20.820]  We're looking at Central American illegal aliens currently.
[02:17:20.820 --> 02:17:31.820]  But by and by, they will be bringing in, that is the people who are orchestrating to bring in large numbers of people from probably the western regions,
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:34.820]  the politically unstable regions of China.
[02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:43.820]  So what has happened in the academic world is that these foundations, many of which you have identified over the years in your program,
[02:17:43.820 --> 02:17:54.820]  the Rockefellers, the Soros, more recently the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, have been pouring in lots of money to social science departments, humanities,
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:58.820]  and for the most part, they own it, lock, stock, and barrel.
[02:17:58.820 --> 02:18:09.820]  They brought forth these two individuals. This person's name is Renato Rosaldo, formerly Professor of Anthropology at Stanford University in Palo Alto.
[02:18:09.820 --> 02:18:13.820]  This is Yale, Scull and Bones West.
[02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:14.820]  He was there.
[02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:16.820]  Now he's at NYU, New York University.
[02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:18.820]  He retired from Stanford.
[02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:28.820]  And what NYU does is they take retired professors from name brand prestigious institutions in the highermen, and they start their second career there.
[02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:31.820]  And the other person is a little bit further up north.
[02:18:31.820 --> 02:18:39.820]  And that's sort of Silicon Information IT, Scull and Bones Bohemian Growth Territory.
[02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:41.820]  Her name is Iwa Hong.
[02:18:41.820 --> 02:18:45.820]  She's a Malaysian Chinese, straight Chinese for Nankan, as they're referred to.
[02:18:45.820 --> 02:18:52.820]  She's also a professor of anthropology, but she is at UC Berkeley.
[02:18:52.820 --> 02:19:03.820]  Now, these two people, unbeknownst to the general American public, have articulated, they redefined what citizenship is.
[02:19:03.820 --> 02:19:04.820]  Very clever.
[02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:05.820]  Very clever.
[02:19:05.820 --> 02:19:23.820]  They redefined it so that we have now two or three generations of university students, graduates and graduate students, professionals, people who are in public policy attorneys, you name it, who have now been imbued with this ideology that people like Rosaldo.
[02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:24.820]  And there are others as well.
[02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:30.820]  These are the two main people that I've identified that Rosaldo and Aung have cultivated.
[02:19:30.820 --> 02:19:38.820]  And remember, by the way, that Barama Mama, that's Barack Obama, I just kind of conflate his name to Barama.
[02:19:38.820 --> 02:19:43.820]  But Barama Mama, Stanley Ann Dunham, was also an anthropologist.
[02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:45.820]  She was a cultural anthropologist.
[02:19:45.820 --> 02:19:51.820]  She was trained as an anthropologist by the East West Center, which has CIA connections at the University of Hawaii.
[02:19:51.820 --> 02:19:55.820]  She was sent over to Indonesia to supposedly study indigenous cultures.
[02:19:55.820 --> 02:20:00.820]  And what happens is that research gets kicked up to the big boys and they figure out how to go in there.
[02:20:00.820 --> 02:20:09.820]  They read the ethnological literature and they can use that in order to destroy the indigenous culture so they can bring in their shock troops.
[02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:11.820]  That's what they did right after she gave them the info.
[02:20:11.820 --> 02:20:13.820]  They engage in a bunch of extermination.
[02:20:13.820 --> 02:20:14.820]  Absolutely.
[02:20:14.820 --> 02:20:24.820]  So you're already connecting the connections between the anthropological sciences, Rosaldo and Aung, and people like Dunham who are more prominently known.
[02:20:24.820 --> 02:20:31.820]  It'd be like space aliens if they wanted to take over, putting humanoids in to blend in and study things before they attack.
[02:20:31.820 --> 02:20:32.820]  Absolutely.
[02:20:32.820 --> 02:20:36.820]  I was reading the Mongol history, culture, military strategy.
[02:20:36.820 --> 02:20:40.820]  They always had people, they didn't just come in there in charge and they're Mongol ponies.
[02:20:40.820 --> 02:20:50.820]  They always had people going in to the local culture, asking questions, fitting in, trading with them, gaining intelligence, identifying their vulnerabilities,
[02:20:50.820 --> 02:20:56.820]  learning a little bit of their language, their culture, their folk ways, and then taking it back to the Great Khan.
[02:20:56.820 --> 02:20:58.820]  And then they would come in and invade.
[02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:02.820]  So this is a really old pattern of strategy.
[02:21:02.820 --> 02:21:07.820]  And this is what's going on right now here in 2014.
[02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:13.820]  So what Rosaldo came up with is this notion of cultural citizenship.
[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:15.820]  Cultural citizenship.
[02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:23.820]  Now, this is our beginning to destroy our common understanding of citizenship, which is black and white.
[02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:27.820]  Either you're a citizen or you're a non-citizen.
[02:21:27.820 --> 02:21:32.820]  And even further, this is a direct attack on the nation state.
[02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:37.820]  This is a direct attack and assault on this notion of national sovereignty.
[02:21:37.820 --> 02:21:45.820]  And as you spoke to it earlier in this very program, it's not really about borders, it's about national sovereignty.
[02:21:45.820 --> 02:21:51.820]  And to reiterate, to underscore what you said previously, why is national sovereignty important?
[02:21:51.820 --> 02:21:53.820]  Well, it is a firewall.
[02:21:53.820 --> 02:22:03.820]  It's a protection of Americans or any other nationalities against these global centralized banking families of ancient origins
[02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:13.820]  who want unipolar absolute power, whether it's orchestrated from the city of London, Geneva, one of their centers.
[02:22:13.820 --> 02:22:15.820]  And we're all going to suffer for it.
[02:22:15.820 --> 02:22:20.820]  I mean, if you think your government today is inaccessible, is not listening to you and is distant,
[02:22:20.820 --> 02:22:28.820]  and you think you're alienated now, just try to appeal for a regressive grievance to a global centralized government, it's going to be impossible.
[02:22:28.820 --> 02:22:33.820]  No borders, no one can communicate with each other, and they have little racial and ethnic leaders
[02:22:33.820 --> 02:22:38.820]  that are part of the new Politburo under the corporations who are exempt offshore.
[02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:41.820]  It's the ultimate form of neo-futilism.
[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:43.820]  Absolutely, yes.
[02:22:43.820 --> 02:22:45.820]  We're going back to the feudal model.
[02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:50.820]  The high tech techno fascist is a friend of mine, Doug Gellner at UCLA called it.
[02:22:50.820 --> 02:22:58.820]  Techno fascist overlay in order to manage this, which makes it much more difficult to...
[02:22:58.820 --> 02:23:02.820]  Well, how do you... I mean, I want you to continue to break down how they're redefining things, who these people are.
[02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:08.820]  This is important to actually see who these big foundations are funding and what their plan is.
[02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:13.820]  But after that, I just want to ask this now, but answer it an hour later, because I don't want to interrupt you.
[02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:21.820]  But how do you communicate to people from Eastern Europe, or people from Guatemala,
[02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:26.820]  or people that grew up in dirt floor villages, how do you communicate with them?
[02:23:26.820 --> 02:23:33.820]  This information, when I'm talking to PhDs in sociology and they can't even understand it,
[02:23:33.820 --> 02:23:39.820]  it's all written on the globalist manuals, you've read them, you're smart, you get it, I've read them, I get it.
[02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:47.820]  It's so alien to the average person, because they're not premeditatedly technocrats who see people as things to be programmed.
[02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:52.820]  I just don't know how... It's so simple, but it's also so complex.
[02:23:52.820 --> 02:23:58.820]  Well, the average person and the audience that I'm trying to reach are undergraduates,
[02:23:58.820 --> 02:24:01.820]  either in the United States and the English-speaking world.
[02:24:01.820 --> 02:24:05.820]  These are the people that are going into the professions, these are the people who are the educators,
[02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:11.820]  and they have gone now through three or four generations, four or five years I count as a generation,
[02:24:11.820 --> 02:24:19.820]  of Rosaldo and Ong being programmed to accept this model of society and politics and government.
[02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:25.820]  They accept it. So what I'm trying to do is to identify the origins, the sources, and name names
[02:24:25.820 --> 02:24:31.820]  on who is responsible for this takeover in academic culture.
[02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:35.820]  These are two individuals of a larger, larger complex that's heavily funded.
[02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:37.820]  I'm just using them as a shorthand.
[02:24:37.820 --> 02:24:43.820]  So once we educate these new generations of undergraduates, and of course they accepted blindly,
[02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:46.820]  these are professors and they have no frame of reference.
[02:24:46.820 --> 02:24:52.820]  So they just uncritically, in chess, everything that these people are saying.
[02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:55.820]  They're like sponges. You're saying the answer is what you're doing.
[02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:59.820]  Be bold, get threatened, but you're doing it. Go in and try to deprogram them,
[02:24:59.820 --> 02:25:01.820]  because you're not even telling them your view.
[02:25:01.820 --> 02:25:04.820]  You're saying here's the man behind the curtain. Look, they're saying it.
[02:25:04.820 --> 02:25:07.820]  They're saying it. So I'm sorry to interrupt. Let's move on to the next person.
[02:25:07.820 --> 02:25:14.820]  There's a second part to it, which is what are the alternatives, which perhaps I can speak to at a later date.
[02:25:14.820 --> 02:25:17.820]  Maybe you can have me back on for a back to school special.
[02:25:17.820 --> 02:25:22.820]  I have a program that's going to rock the foundations of the University of California,
[02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:28.820]  because it's not enough to just diagnose the problem. We also have to come up with solutions.
[02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:35.820]  So yes, going back to your analogy of the sponge, what I'm trying to do is squeeze out all the track out of a SpongeBob
[02:25:35.820 --> 02:25:42.820]  and fill that sponge up with important information, like this notion of cultural citizenship.
[02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:50.820]  What does it really mean to be an American, a Honduran, a Russian,
[02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:54.820]  as opposed to being someone who's a Spanish-speaking person who happens to live in the United States,
[02:25:54.820 --> 02:26:00.820]  who's going to be part of this massive welfare system or part of Section 8 housing?
[02:26:00.820 --> 02:26:05.820]  I was about to say, under this globalism, this cultural Marxism, this cultural citizenship,
[02:26:05.820 --> 02:26:10.820]  you really are like a refugee worldwide and have no rights, and that's what they're saying.
[02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:17.820]  And so these people literally are setting the new model, and it's a borderless, landless vagabond
[02:26:17.820 --> 02:26:20.820]  who doesn't even know how to work the system.
[02:26:20.820 --> 02:26:27.820]  And of course they're oblivious to this, but these illegal aliens are really, really invulnerable.
[02:26:27.820 --> 02:26:33.820]  They're like a mobile weaponized shock troops here, and they're going to have to do the bidding of the people
[02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:40.820]  that are controlling them, which will be primarily Latinas now for the Central Americans.
[02:26:40.820 --> 02:26:42.820]  It's a slave army.
[02:26:42.820 --> 02:26:45.820]  It's a slave army. It's the reserve army that Marx wrote about.
[02:26:45.820 --> 02:26:51.820]  The lumpen proletariat is referred to it that is used historically to destabilize regimes.
[02:26:51.820 --> 02:26:58.820]  They're the ones that have the pitchforks and the torches, but in this case it's being directed against the middle class.
[02:26:58.820 --> 02:27:03.820]  So I'm addressing the middle class, the educated middle class, the undergraduates of the University of California,
[02:27:03.820 --> 02:27:11.820]  the University of Texas, all the great public institutions, and from there we will educate the larger public
[02:27:11.820 --> 02:27:19.820]  just by doing, by being an administration and in government, and the field of law and medicine.
[02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:24.820]  Professor, something just clicked. Normally what you cover gets a lot of attention,
[02:27:24.820 --> 02:27:28.820]  and obviously your interview here got a lot of attention in the alternative press, the new press,
[02:27:28.820 --> 02:27:32.820]  but they're smart. They threatened to cut your pay or fire, you or whatever.
[02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:35.820]  You didn't back down. You're a well-known figure, respected.
[02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:43.820]  Now they realize that didn't work, so they're trying to ignore this and hope that, because obviously you're ready to be persecuted,
[02:27:43.820 --> 02:27:48.820]  you're ready to use them coming after you, as you said last time, to bring more attention to this authoritarianism,
[02:27:48.820 --> 02:27:52.820]  so they're being smart. They're choosing to fight when they want to fight,
[02:27:52.820 --> 02:27:58.820]  and I would imagine that'll come somewhere down the road against you. They'll come sneaking in the night.
[02:27:58.820 --> 02:28:06.820]  Well, my back-to-school special is going to flesh them out. They're not going to be able to ignore my back-to-school special,
[02:28:06.820 --> 02:28:12.820]  which I'm going to roll out in about another two or three weeks, maybe right around the time that everybody's going back to school.
[02:28:12.820 --> 02:28:17.820]  Right now there's a vacuum, right? No one's paying attention. It's the summer break.
[02:28:17.820 --> 02:28:24.820]  But let me continue. That's the Rosaldo cultural citizenship. I'd like your viewers, your listeners to ponder that term,
[02:28:24.820 --> 02:28:29.820]  his innovation, and the Rewarder, of course. They're giving status. They're giving more grants.
[02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:36.820]  They're giving prestigious academic posts, and they've been brought to Washington, D.C. to chitchat with the political leaders
[02:28:36.820 --> 02:28:41.820]  and probably the intelligence community. So this was in 2003. It's relatively recent.
[02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:47.820]  This is why we're still talking about Cloward and Piven, though we should be talking about Rosaldo and Aung, right?
[02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:53.820]  Because they, as I said, the generals always fighting the last battle. This is the current battle.
[02:28:53.820 --> 02:29:01.820]  The battle that we're waging now is against the Rosaldo and Aung model, which is an extension of Cloward and Piven.
[02:29:01.820 --> 02:29:06.820]  Okay, let me move to Iowa Aung, who's another foreign-born intellectual.
[02:29:06.820 --> 02:29:14.820]  This is a model. They don't just cream and cultivate people from out of the country who are impoverished.
[02:29:14.820 --> 02:29:20.820]  They also like to cream intellectual laborers, like IT, information technology, computer technology.
[02:29:20.820 --> 02:29:24.820]  First it was Taiwan, then India, and now China.
[02:29:24.820 --> 02:29:30.820]  And the Silicon Valley people don't realize it yet, but they're also going to be looking forward to these engineers.
[02:29:30.820 --> 02:29:33.820]  Stay there. Tell us about the other professor when we come back.
[02:29:33.820 --> 02:29:41.820]  Professor Hamamoto is our guest. Powerful information, and we're going to break down from an insider inside of it, how this is working,
[02:29:41.820 --> 02:29:48.820]  and the plan to bring him the North American Union and a planetary corporate-run, fascist world government.
[02:29:48.820 --> 02:29:50.820]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the line.
[02:29:50.820 --> 02:29:52.820]  With a bunch of idiot socialists.
[02:29:52.820 --> 02:29:53.820]  Alex Jones, working in the bottom.
[02:29:53.820 --> 02:29:54.820]  Working in the bottom.
[02:29:54.820 --> 02:29:55.820]  Radio Network.
[02:29:55.820 --> 02:30:24.820]  Working in 200 square foot shacks.
[02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:34.820]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a two ounce bottle, and it's not recommended for extended continual use.
[02:30:34.820 --> 02:30:36.820]  This is not a low grade formula.
[02:30:36.820 --> 02:30:43.820]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver.
[02:30:43.820 --> 02:30:49.820]  Using electrical processes within a base of deionized water for your preparedness storage.

[02:30:59.820 --> 02:31:07.820]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs. Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes,
[02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:17.820]  instead of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:31:17.820 --> 02:31:21.820]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say that was good stuff.
[02:31:21.820 --> 02:31:32.820]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:31:32.820 --> 02:31:38.820]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:45.820]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day. I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[02:31:45.820 --> 02:31:51.820]  It's not just the super male vitality. All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.

[02:32:21.820 --> 02:32:27.820]  We're talking about Made in America belt buckles and nickel brass. This is more than a summer blowout special.
[02:32:27.820 --> 02:32:37.820]  This is a new declaration of independence, but to expand the InfoWars, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free right now.
[02:32:37.820 --> 02:32:42.820]  And you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:50.820]  That's more than five months free off the regular price, not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July.
[02:32:50.820 --> 02:33:00.820]  Made in 1776.com. Molan Lombay. You can take my gun from my cold, dead, ranch.
[02:33:21.820 --> 02:33:36.820]  It's so fascinating. I'm trying to not interrupt, but I am. I apologize. I'm Alex Jones, your host, Professor Daryl Hamamoto.
[02:33:36.820 --> 02:33:44.820]  He was one of the leaders and has been the head of the Department of Asian American Studies at UC Davis.
[02:33:44.820 --> 02:33:50.820]  And he's inside the system seeing all of this. And look, it's really very simple.
[02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:57.820]  I know most of you know all this, but we have to reach out to middle class people that can understand it.
[02:33:57.820 --> 02:34:02.820]  And to executives and to pastors and to cultural leaders.
[02:34:02.820 --> 02:34:12.820]  And explain. Look, there's a sophisticated cultural modeling control system developed by the Empires in the last, well, thousands of years.
[02:34:12.820 --> 02:34:22.820]  Julius Caesar wrote about it a lot, but really codified the last 200 by the British Empire to administer and control countries along ethnic and religious
[02:34:22.820 --> 02:34:31.820]  Balkanization lines. So to control that, they've artificially come in and put more of this in the name of political correctness, making it worse,
[02:34:31.820 --> 02:34:39.820]  shelling it on the idea of equality of men. Just like Illuminati said they would push equality, but actually their secret was they would use that to get control
[02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:47.820]  and bring in inequality. So that's the name of the game is they, they claim all this equality and fraternity of men and women.
[02:34:47.820 --> 02:34:54.820]  But when you look at what they do, they bring in dehumanization, dumbing down, deindustrialization, destabilization.
[02:34:54.820 --> 02:35:03.820]  And then after they've cut your legs off, they give you crutches in Iraq or Libya, you name it and say, see the favor we did.
[02:35:03.820 --> 02:35:10.820]  We burned your house down and then called a fire truck afterwards. So it is a very wicked management system.
[02:35:10.820 --> 02:35:16.820]  And it did not even get full power itself. The West had a little bit more freedom than other cultures.
[02:35:16.820 --> 02:35:24.820]  And in my view, so it was able to produce more science and technology that was then hijacked, leveraged biotechnology.
[02:35:24.820 --> 02:35:32.820]  And we're now a couple hundred years into this. And now we're going into the end game stages and you can debate politics all day and the window dressing
[02:35:32.820 --> 02:35:39.820]  of the full spectrum discussions. But you've got to pull the curtain back and look at the real machinery behind it.
[02:35:39.820 --> 02:35:45.820]  And a little man running it or there's no beating it. And that's why there's a compulsion to say tinfoil hat.
[02:35:45.820 --> 02:35:51.820]  Or there's no world government or there's no corruption because they don't even want the debate to begin.
[02:35:51.820 --> 02:35:57.820]  There's no NSA watching you or listening. That's preposterous or of course they're listening and it's preposterous.
[02:35:57.820 --> 02:36:04.820]  You don't like it. There's no police state. OK, there is. But it's for your own good.
[02:36:04.820 --> 02:36:14.820]  This is a dehumanizing system. So I want to go back to Professor Darrell Hamamoto to be able to break this down and go over where he sees it's going,
[02:36:14.820 --> 02:36:21.820]  finish up with, you know, recap the first professor at NYU and then go to the other professor because he's trying to introduce the term.
[02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:30.820]  We know about Cloward and Piven. That itself is just one popularized example of this thought of order out of chaos, this lininist idea,
[02:36:30.820 --> 02:36:38.820]  destroy it, build it back up in their new image. So we're introducing the new current war in his view and I agree with him.
[02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:44.820]  What's currently happening so we can identify it, educate others, be aware of it and defeat it.
[02:36:44.820 --> 02:36:53.820]  They're trying to control the lexicon we use, aka Ingsock, right out of 1984 where we can't even communicate with each other.
[02:36:53.820 --> 02:37:00.820]  When you hear Michelle Obama say, don't use the word bossy, that's not some Kurt Vonnegut satire. That's real.
[02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:08.820]  And they want you to learn that every day words are bad and that you better only repeat what they say and that's going to change day to day.
[02:37:08.820 --> 02:37:16.820]  As Carl Rove bipartisan told the New York Times, we control reality. We control the language. You will take whatever new reality we give you.
[02:37:16.820 --> 02:37:22.820]  We're talking about the end of free will. So I'm going to shut up. Professor, you've got the floor. Go ahead.
[02:37:22.820 --> 02:37:30.820]  Yes. So far as the first lady boy is concerned, her scolding us for using the term bossy, I have a suggestion for her.
[02:37:30.820 --> 02:37:36.820]  How about Biachi? Would that be better for the first lady boy? I don't know.
[02:37:36.820 --> 02:37:42.820]  But anyway, let me finish up with Rosaldo here with this notion of cultural citizenship.
[02:37:42.820 --> 02:37:48.820]  Part of this is to completely undermine this notion of national sovereignty.
[02:37:48.820 --> 02:37:56.820]  And the implication that is, is that if you are a Spanish speaking person, or if you're part of the National Council of La Raza,
[02:37:56.820 --> 02:38:03.820]  if you're part of the race, La Raza, or you are part of the people, then you are a citizen.
[02:38:03.820 --> 02:38:10.820]  The borders be damned. You are a citizen. You belong there. It's your birthright because you are part of this new reformulation
[02:38:10.820 --> 02:38:17.820]  of what citizenship is, cultural citizenship, quote unquote, 2003. It's important to understand the genesis of these terms
[02:38:17.820 --> 02:38:23.820]  because they leak into everyday discourse and they affect political policy.
[02:38:23.820 --> 02:38:30.820]  The second person I wanted to talk about, and she's handling the Asian end of it because that's going to be coming down to Pike very soon.
[02:38:30.820 --> 02:38:38.820]  Larger numbers of politically unstable, economically underdeveloped areas in China being brought into the United States.
[02:38:38.820 --> 02:38:45.820]  And they can dictate that to the United States because they own so much of our debt and they want some sort of exchange.
[02:38:45.820 --> 02:38:52.820]  And one of the exchanges can be the exportation of political descent to the United States, which is only going to compound the problem.
[02:38:52.820 --> 02:39:00.820]  And they have a ready-made front here. They have a whole two or three generations of educated, middle-class people in the professions
[02:39:00.820 --> 02:39:06.820]  who have been reading the work and worshiping the intellectual superstars. Because these are superstars.
[02:39:06.820 --> 02:39:11.820]  It's just like Hollywood. There's a star system in academia, believe it or not. We never hear about them, but there is one.
[02:39:11.820 --> 02:39:15.820]  Sure. I mean, everyone else starts parroting what the superstar is hoping they get a grant.
[02:39:15.820 --> 02:39:20.820]  Right. They come from the elite institutions. They're the name brand marquee designer institutions.
[02:39:20.820 --> 02:39:25.820]  And every state university professor has to follow suit or liberal arts colleges.
[02:39:25.820 --> 02:39:29.820]  You can down to the community college level. They set the tone, right?
[02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:33.820]  They're the head fish and the pilot fish school.
[02:39:33.820 --> 02:39:41.820]  So there's this person, her name's I-Wong O-N-G, and she came up with a similar concept, similar to Rosalvo.
[02:39:41.820 --> 02:39:45.820]  And she calls it flexible citizenship.
[02:39:45.820 --> 02:39:53.820]  Oh, flexible citizenship. 19 and 19-9. She wrote an entire foundation-funded book on it. This made her reputation.
[02:39:53.820 --> 02:39:59.820]  So it's flexible. If you break it down now, it makes a lot as much sense as flexible pregnancy.
[02:39:59.820 --> 02:40:04.820]  Right. You're either pregnant or you're non-pregnant. You're either a citizen or you're a non-citizen.
[02:40:04.820 --> 02:40:11.820]  But by playing around with the language, or we'll call it Ingsoc, it's an old strategy,
[02:40:11.820 --> 02:40:16.820]  by reconceptualizing, remoulding our perceptual basis,
[02:40:16.820 --> 02:40:22.820]  and then teaching generations of educated people that this is the way to go,
[02:40:22.820 --> 02:40:25.820]  then you have frozen any sort of discussion.
[02:40:25.820 --> 02:40:31.820]  And by the way, this is important. This is one of the reasons why, unlike the border agents,
[02:40:31.820 --> 02:40:36.820]  unlike the military, unlike growing numbers of individuals in all these important institutions,
[02:40:36.820 --> 02:40:42.820]  maybe in the majority of them now, who are keyed in and are aware of the New World Order endgame,
[02:40:42.820 --> 02:40:46.820]  academia is utterly silent on this.
[02:40:46.820 --> 02:40:51.820]  This is the key reason, because we've already had two or three generations of undergraduates,
[02:40:51.820 --> 02:40:56.820]  graduate students creating new generations of the professoria,
[02:40:56.820 --> 02:41:01.820]  who have monopolized any sort of discussion of this.
[02:41:01.820 --> 02:41:08.820]  And my function here is to put this out to the general public to have them understand
[02:41:08.820 --> 02:41:12.820]  what they're paying for, so far as their tuition is concerned,
[02:41:12.820 --> 02:41:15.820]  for their students, for their children to learn.
[02:41:15.820 --> 02:41:19.820]  So it's open kimono time, if you will, if you hear.
[02:41:19.820 --> 02:41:25.820]  I'm going to just open it up, full disclosure, and expose whatever I can from the inside
[02:41:25.820 --> 02:41:32.820]  of what the academic community has been doing to help usher in this New World Order endgame.
[02:41:32.820 --> 02:41:36.820]  It's a really, really crucial component.
[02:41:36.820 --> 02:41:41.820]  And it's so important that, as I mentioned last time, they even brought one of their top
[02:41:41.820 --> 02:41:47.820]  Capos and Janet De Paletano to be the president of the University of California system
[02:41:47.820 --> 02:41:49.820]  in Oakland, California.
[02:41:49.820 --> 02:41:55.820]  So these are the two superstars in this framework.
[02:41:55.820 --> 02:41:59.820]  Now there's another component, if I may change focus slightly,
[02:41:59.820 --> 02:42:06.820]  and that is what I alluded to earlier, and that's the GLBT agenda, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual.
[02:42:06.820 --> 02:42:12.820]  And it has nothing to do with preserving the rights, the dignity of any of these groups.
[02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:18.820]  This is just simply another power block that is being exploited by the Rockefeller Foundation Soros
[02:42:18.820 --> 02:42:23.820]  and whoever else gives them money, private corporations, you name it.
[02:42:23.820 --> 02:42:29.820]  It's a synthetically created, installed power block that's going to be, that already is in place, by the way.
[02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:35.820]  I've talked to other colleagues, and the upper level administration is already stocked with individuals like this.
[02:42:35.820 --> 02:42:43.820]  And the reason being is that if you criticize any aspect of the curriculum, any of these superstars within the university system
[02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:50.820]  are even trivial points like banning smoking on the campus entirely, even in your own car.
[02:42:50.820 --> 02:42:58.820]  Then automatically you become a homophobe, and no one wants to be stigmatized or labeled as being anti-human
[02:42:58.820 --> 02:43:01.820]  or homophobic or racist, whatever it is.
[02:43:01.820 --> 02:43:03.820]  So that's the second phase.
[02:43:03.820 --> 02:43:08.820]  The first part was with putting in a person of color and presidency and saying,
[02:43:08.820 --> 02:43:13.820]  well, you can't criticize them, otherwise you're racist. So the GLBT agenda is installed.
[02:43:13.820 --> 02:43:22.820]  It's very much an extension of what is referred to in this critical community as the cultural Marxism.
[02:43:22.820 --> 02:43:25.820]  But again, cultural Marxism is an outdated phrase.
[02:43:25.820 --> 02:43:27.820]  It's fighting the last war.
[02:43:27.820 --> 02:43:36.820]  And just briefly, let me, like I did in the case of Rosaldo and Aung, identify three GLBT academic superstars
[02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:39.820]  that your viewers should be aware of.
[02:43:39.820 --> 02:43:47.820]  And that had a huge, huge, huge impact on how the educated middle class, including its professionals, its attorneys, its physicians,
[02:43:47.820 --> 02:43:52.820]  its people in the sciences, they've had a huge impact.
[02:43:52.820 --> 02:43:57.820]  And there's very little discussion of these people in the larger society.
[02:43:57.820 --> 02:44:00.820]  Professor, get in, Joe. This is critical information.
[02:44:00.820 --> 02:44:06.820]  Great. There's this one individual, her and him, because she goes by a dual gender identity.
[02:44:06.820 --> 02:44:10.820]  She goes by Jack's Flash, Judith Halberstam.
[02:44:10.820 --> 02:44:13.820]  She's at the University of Southern California, USC.
[02:44:13.820 --> 02:44:17.820]  Or as we refer to it, the university as Foyle Children.
[02:44:17.820 --> 02:44:22.820]  And she wrote a classic text called Female Masculinity.
[02:44:22.820 --> 02:44:31.820]  In 1998, talk about Baphomet, Female Masculinity, and she's talking about how gender roles are artificial, their social constructions.
[02:44:31.820 --> 02:44:37.820]  And she lives her life as a man slash woman.
[02:44:37.820 --> 02:44:42.820]  If you want to look up her photos online, you can see what I mean.
[02:44:42.820 --> 02:44:46.820]  But so she's a key superstar.
[02:44:46.820 --> 02:44:48.820]  She has an endow chair at the University of California.
[02:44:48.820 --> 02:44:50.820]  This is how they reward them.
[02:44:50.820 --> 02:44:54.820]  And again, this is nothing about being transgender, transsexual or being queer.
[02:44:54.820 --> 02:44:58.820]  It has nothing very little to do with it.
[02:44:58.820 --> 02:45:01.820]  The second person is at the University of California, Berkeley.
[02:45:01.820 --> 02:45:03.820]  Her name's Judith Butler.
[02:45:03.820 --> 02:45:09.820]  She's famous for the incomprehensibility of her really arcane and abstruse writings.
[02:45:09.820 --> 02:45:13.820]  But her contribution is 1990.
[02:45:13.820 --> 02:45:15.820]  It's called Gender Trouble.
[02:45:15.820 --> 02:45:23.820]  And again, her attack is on these notions of man, of woman, of female, and male.
[02:45:23.820 --> 02:45:29.820]  This is the cultural assault on gender, on really on humanity.
[02:45:29.820 --> 02:45:37.820]  Because they call it transhumanism or transsexualism.
[02:45:37.820 --> 02:45:44.820]  But it's really postsexuality, posthumanism, where the state, after this point, takes control of reproduction.
[02:45:44.820 --> 02:45:46.820]  And of sexuality in general.
[02:45:46.820 --> 02:45:48.820]  And for those that don't know, just to back you up.
[02:45:48.820 --> 02:45:53.820]  I mean, Huxley, his brother ran the UN program, was the founder of the transhumanist movement.
[02:45:53.820 --> 02:45:55.820]  You have the pop transhumanism that sounds nice.
[02:45:55.820 --> 02:45:57.820]  But internally, it's Brave New World.
[02:45:57.820 --> 02:45:59.820]  They pick your sex.
[02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:01.820]  You go into puberty when you're five.
[02:46:01.820 --> 02:46:03.820]  You're a drone. You're programmed.
[02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:07.820]  So they use the civil rights movement saying, let's be nice to people that are naturally this way.
[02:46:07.820 --> 02:46:09.820]  Or you have this proclivity.
[02:46:09.820 --> 02:46:10.820]  You were nice people.
[02:46:10.820 --> 02:46:14.820]  And let's hype it and then make it where people have to do what we want.
[02:46:14.820 --> 02:46:20.820]  Because it's an engine pulling a whole political train that is a post-human world.
[02:46:20.820 --> 02:46:22.820]  And that's in all their text.
[02:46:22.820 --> 02:46:24.820]  They're not even hiding that.
[02:46:24.820 --> 02:46:27.820]  But they know that the average person isn't aware of this.
[02:46:27.820 --> 02:46:33.820]  It's just like the chemicals in the food and water with the frogs now having, quote, gender trouble.
[02:46:33.820 --> 02:46:36.820]  It's not that we're homophobic against gay frogs.
[02:46:36.820 --> 02:46:40.820]  They're not gay frogs, folks, like some Romans were, you know, one way or the other.
[02:46:40.820 --> 02:46:42.820]  The point is that's always gone on.
[02:46:42.820 --> 02:46:48.820]  It is an artificiality being projected for an end of humanity scenario.
[02:46:48.820 --> 02:46:49.820]  That's their words, not ours.
[02:46:49.820 --> 02:46:51.820]  I know you've studied it, so get into it.
[02:46:51.820 --> 02:46:52.820]  That's precisely it.
[02:46:52.820 --> 02:46:58.820]  I mean, it's interesting that you picked up on the biochemical and the science behind this.
[02:46:58.820 --> 02:47:01.820]  Because they're doing in the humanities and the social science,
[02:47:01.820 --> 02:47:07.820]  what they're doing is providing cover for the bio, the re-engineering of the human endowment, male and female,
[02:47:07.820 --> 02:47:10.820]  through biochemical re-engineering to the BPA.
[02:47:10.820 --> 02:47:15.820]  You talk about it constantly in your program and your guests speak to it, to these issues.
[02:47:15.820 --> 02:47:17.820]  But they are normalizing.
[02:47:17.820 --> 02:47:23.820]  Through their teaching, they are normalizing this post-human transgender reality
[02:47:23.820 --> 02:47:30.820]  that is part of a biological programming that was announced in public by people like Aldous Hoxley.
[02:47:30.820 --> 02:47:32.820]  It comes from the same branch.
[02:47:32.820 --> 02:47:38.820]  This is the most recent bud, the green bud of this eugenics tree
[02:47:38.820 --> 02:47:43.820]  that has been growing and growing since the time at least of Hoxley.
[02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:48.820]  The third person, we have Judith Butler, we've just finished up with here.
[02:47:48.820 --> 02:47:55.820]  The third person in this triumvirate is Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, deceased.
[02:47:55.820 --> 02:48:01.820]  She was at Duke University, which was one of the capitals of a quote-unquote literary theory,
[02:48:01.820 --> 02:48:03.820]  which is part of this, by the way.
[02:48:03.820 --> 02:48:05.820]  Maybe I can get into this later on.
[02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:14.820]  There was something called theory with a capital T that was imported from Europe in order to, I think, neutralize
[02:48:14.820 --> 02:48:18.820]  any sort of political dissenter awareness that was coming out of the humanities,
[02:48:18.820 --> 02:48:22.820]  largely out of the anti-Vietnam War organization.
[02:48:22.820 --> 02:48:28.820]  So they brought in something overseas, and Yale and places like Duke were instrumental in bringing this in.
[02:48:28.820 --> 02:48:30.820]  So her name is Sedgwick.
[02:48:30.820 --> 02:48:37.820]  She was at Duke University, made out of family tobacco money, these Duke fortune,
[02:48:37.820 --> 02:48:43.820]  and then she wound up at the Cooney Graduate Center, City University of New York.
[02:48:43.820 --> 02:48:54.820]  And she is one of the kingpins, or queenpins, rather, of queer theory, and her classic text was published in 1990.
[02:48:54.820 --> 02:48:59.820]  And the title there is The Epistemology of the Closet.
[02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:04.820]  The epistemology, this is the philosophical underpinnings of what later became queer theory,
[02:49:04.820 --> 02:49:13.820]  which again is, I mean, they view it as a standalone, but really it's an adjunct to this larger eugenics, re-engineering of the human species
[02:49:13.820 --> 02:49:17.820]  to move us into the post-human world.
[02:49:17.820 --> 02:49:19.820]  This is how it works. It's very subtle.
[02:49:19.820 --> 02:49:21.820]  It's incremental.
[02:49:21.820 --> 02:49:25.820]  It's part of this larger strategy of transformation.
[02:49:25.820 --> 02:49:29.820]  Of course, there'll be no resistance because there are no more men.
[02:49:29.820 --> 02:49:35.820]  And toward that end, I wanted to talk briefly about the Elliot Roger situation,
[02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:38.820]  and not of respect to his family and to the victims.
[02:49:38.820 --> 02:49:42.820]  I won't go into the specifics of that scenario.
[02:49:42.820 --> 02:49:50.820]  I just wanted, I'm putting his name out there as being emblematic of what is happening at major institutions,
[02:49:50.820 --> 02:49:54.820]  as well as liberal arts colleges, community colleges all over the country.
[02:49:54.820 --> 02:49:57.820]  It's probably happening in Europe, Western Europe.
[02:49:57.820 --> 02:49:59.820]  It's happening in Japan.
[02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:07.820]  But you're seeing larger and larger numbers of male students who fit the Elliot Roger prototype.
[02:50:07.820 --> 02:50:11.820]  They have severe gender confusion.
[02:50:11.820 --> 02:50:14.820]  Sometimes it's referred to as gender dysphoria.
[02:50:14.820 --> 02:50:16.820]  They're obsessed about it.
[02:50:16.820 --> 02:50:24.820]  They've been on psychotropics most of their life, and now they're being dosed heavily by these gender-bending hormones.
[02:50:24.820 --> 02:50:31.820]  And the university instead of addressing these issues, because they manufacture these gender-pending hormones,
[02:50:31.820 --> 02:50:35.820]  because they are an adjunct of the pharmaceutical combine,
[02:50:35.820 --> 02:50:42.820]  they instead have put together university student services and counseling services
[02:50:42.820 --> 02:50:50.820]  to help serve as sort of the mission control therapeutic center to normalize this transformation.
[02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:54.820]  All right, we'll be right back. Just like with breast cancer exploding because of the glyphosates,
[02:50:54.820 --> 02:50:59.820]  they make it about, let's find a cure instead of finding out why it's exploding, they control the movement.

[02:54:16.820 --> 02:54:21.820]  Here's the bottom line.
[02:54:21.820 --> 02:54:32.820]  There is a public agenda to end human fertility and to reprogram the population in preparation to phase out most of the population.
[02:54:32.820 --> 02:54:36.820]  There are arguments to reduce the population out there and there's a lot of problems with humanity.
[02:54:36.820 --> 02:54:49.820]  But there's the artificiality of trying to make us failures so that we can be controlled and dealt with more easily and removed by an elite who I see as at the bottom of the barrel for humanity.
[02:54:49.820 --> 02:54:51.820]  And that's where I leave it.
[02:54:51.820 --> 02:54:58.820]  It's just that as the infertility spikes, next it'll be why are you against people that have infertility?
[02:54:58.820 --> 02:55:00.820]  They're in their own group now too.
[02:55:00.820 --> 02:55:10.820]  So I've seen how the very groups behind so much of this will then manage the crises they've helped create as the professor was just saying.
[02:55:10.820 --> 02:55:18.820]  And then they've done the public down to just bleeding names like double plus good where there's not even a discussion of anything.
[02:55:18.820 --> 02:55:21.820]  That it's just you're a racist or you're a blah blah blah.
[02:55:21.820 --> 02:55:24.820]  Well, meanwhile, all the real racism and stuff gets ignored.
[02:55:24.820 --> 02:55:26.820]  It really is a dumbing down.
[02:55:26.820 --> 02:55:27.820]  It's very dangerous.
[02:55:27.820 --> 02:55:30.820]  We'll have to have you back again soon, professor. We're almost out of time.
[02:55:30.820 --> 02:55:34.820]  Got three or four minutes. Go ahead and finish up, put bookends on what you've said so far today.
[02:55:34.820 --> 02:55:39.820]  And I hope you'll come back and premiere your back to school special here in the next two, three weeks on air with us.
[02:55:39.820 --> 02:55:45.820]  I'd love to come back and roll that one out for the benefit of the University of California.
[02:55:45.820 --> 02:55:49.820]  Yes, we're heading in the name of queer theory and jail.
[02:55:49.820 --> 02:55:59.820]  And the end game of post sexuality is slowly being realized. This is the goal as you have spoken to it in your own documentary end game.
[02:55:59.820 --> 02:56:05.820]  This helps realize this dream of authoritarians from play to all the way to Darwin.
[02:56:05.820 --> 02:56:10.820]  And that is elite control of human reproduction.
[02:56:10.820 --> 02:56:23.820]  So hopefully today I just gave you a little bit of insight, a little bit of behind the scenes insight on how this is orchestrated in the academic curriculum
[02:56:23.820 --> 02:56:34.820]  and how generations of educated Americans and Western Europeans and overseas as well are being infused with this new world order.
[02:56:34.820 --> 02:56:40.820]  Humanistic outlook, which is really anti-human.
[02:56:40.820 --> 02:56:47.820]  What do your colleagues say? Because they're smart. They all know this stuff's in the main line literature.
[02:56:47.820 --> 02:56:52.820]  At the technocrat level, it's not hidden. I mean, what do they say to you?
[02:56:52.820 --> 02:57:01.820]  When they speak to me, they look at me as scant and I think that most of my opposition comes from my immediate colleagues.
[02:57:01.820 --> 02:57:08.820]  Because they've been bought off into it. They're smart, intelligent people.
[02:57:08.820 --> 02:57:14.820]  But like any other institution, the reigning operational philosophy is a goal long to get along.
[02:57:14.820 --> 02:57:17.820]  And this is true for academia, which is ironic.
[02:57:17.820 --> 02:57:27.820]  Supposedly we're here in order to blaze new trails and come up with new insights and information so that we could help move our civilization a little bit further along here.
[02:57:27.820 --> 02:57:29.820]  But that doesn't work that way in practice.
[02:57:29.820 --> 02:57:33.820]  Well, there's the paradox. They're in their ivory towers scared of you.
[02:57:33.820 --> 02:57:37.820]  But out in the open, what you're saying, really, people have been supportive.
[02:57:37.820 --> 02:57:44.820]  And so I think that's what the disconnect is. I don't think this overall program is going to go the way the technocrats thought.
[02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:47.820]  I don't believe so. And that's why I'm going outside the tower.
[02:57:47.820 --> 02:57:51.820]  I'm going over their heads and going directly to the public.
[02:57:51.820 --> 02:57:55.820]  And I thank you for the opportunity to reach such large numbers of people.
[02:57:55.820 --> 02:58:04.820]  Because this is how we are going to erode the foundations of this artificial tower of ivory tower of Babel that has been erected.
[02:58:04.820 --> 02:58:08.820]  It's very, very vulnerable. And I'd like to leave on an optimistic note.
[02:58:08.820 --> 02:58:12.820]  The educated middle class historically around the world has never been larger.
[02:58:12.820 --> 02:58:20.820]  And that's why their control system, their snoop systems, their IT, the NSA, that's why they're going to fail.
[02:58:20.820 --> 02:58:23.820]  Because our intelligence and our will is far, far greater than theirs.
[02:58:23.820 --> 02:58:26.820]  And that's not hyper-pep talk. It's true.
[02:58:26.820 --> 02:58:29.820]  That's why they're trying to move so quick right now because they know they're in trouble.
[02:58:29.820 --> 02:58:34.820]  The human desire for true freedom is much stronger than their desire to control and dominate us.
[02:58:34.820 --> 02:58:38.820]  Professor, thank you so much for the time. Professor Hamamoto, I'm coming back in overdrive.
[02:58:38.820 --> 02:58:41.820]  Thank you to talk to Darlene, James, and Dennis.
[02:58:41.820 --> 02:58:42.820]  I appreciate you guys holding.
[02:58:42.820 --> 02:58:44.820]  I apologize to the other callers.
[02:58:44.820 --> 02:58:54.820]  I'll get to those three. Stay with us in FullWars.com.
[02:59:15.820 --> 02:59:31.820]  The Propure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:59:31.820 --> 02:59:32.820]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:59:32.820 --> 02:59:33.820]  It's good water.
[02:59:33.820 --> 02:59:34.820]  Refreshing.
[02:59:34.820 --> 02:59:35.820]  It's good.
[02:59:35.820 --> 02:59:50.820]  The Propure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:59:50.820 --> 02:59:53.820]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:53.820 --> 03:00:08.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:24.820 --> 03:00:27.820]  All right, you know, we line up guests at most talk shows.
[03:00:27.820 --> 03:00:29.820]  We just hang up on the callers when the guest comes on.
[03:00:29.820 --> 03:00:32.820]  But I let folks hold if they want to stay with us to talk.
[03:00:32.820 --> 03:00:35.820]  So I kind of apologize but also say, hey, I'm doing you a favor.
[03:00:35.820 --> 03:00:38.820]  My point is I don't like making people hold, but I do.
[03:00:38.820 --> 03:00:39.820]  Darlene, thanks for holding.
[03:00:39.820 --> 03:00:41.820]  From Canada, we've got a Dennis and James.
[03:00:41.820 --> 03:00:42.820]  Go ahead.
[03:00:42.820 --> 03:00:43.820]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:43.820 --> 03:00:50.820]  I've been listening to you for eight years, and I believe they're going to let the border crisis get so bad
[03:00:50.820 --> 03:00:55.820]  that that's when they'll introduce the UN troops on Americans.
[03:00:55.820 --> 03:00:59.820]  Well, the UN's already down there actually calling the shots.
[03:00:59.820 --> 03:01:00.820]  We have an article about that yesterday.
[03:01:00.820 --> 03:01:03.820]  So, no, I mean, I think this is just part of the process.
[03:01:03.820 --> 03:01:04.820]  I think you're right.
[03:01:04.820 --> 03:01:06.820]  And it's going to be bad.
[03:01:06.820 --> 03:01:10.820]  So probably by the spring, all hell's going to break loose.
[03:01:10.820 --> 03:01:13.820]  Thank you for everything you do, and God bless.
[03:01:13.820 --> 03:01:15.820]  Well, God bless you, sweetheart, for holding.
[03:01:15.820 --> 03:01:16.820]  What a sweet lady.
[03:01:16.820 --> 03:01:18.820]  Let's talk to James in Colorado.
[03:01:18.820 --> 03:01:20.820]  How are you doing on the air?
[03:01:20.820 --> 03:01:21.820]  Hey, Alex.
[03:01:21.820 --> 03:01:23.820]  James, I saw a longtime listener.
[03:01:23.820 --> 03:01:29.820]  I'm also a libertarian party endorsed candidate for Colorado State House Representative District 45.
[03:01:29.820 --> 03:01:30.820]  Awesome.
[03:01:30.820 --> 03:01:36.820]  So, I'd just like to briefly comment about the gun control issues going on in Colorado
[03:01:36.820 --> 03:01:40.820]  and the National Guard sent to Texas border by Governor Perry.
[03:01:40.820 --> 03:01:41.820]  Go ahead.
[03:01:41.820 --> 03:01:49.820]  In response for gun control in Colorado is getting better, a lot better outside of the Denver Metro area at least.
[03:01:49.820 --> 03:02:01.820]  The city that I live in, Castle Rock, their city council just recently voted to remove the ban on open carry in all public government buildings and city council meetings.
[03:02:01.820 --> 03:02:08.820]  If you remember almost half of the city council said they were going to resign if the ban was removed.
[03:02:08.820 --> 03:02:13.820]  Well, they're all still there.
[03:02:13.820 --> 03:02:14.820]  Well, I know this.
[03:02:14.820 --> 03:02:19.820]  We need to continue to move against all those legislators with recalls that voted for the gunman.
[03:02:19.820 --> 03:02:20.820]  Exactly.
[03:02:20.820 --> 03:02:37.820]  Also, in regards to the National Guards sent down to the Texas border by Governor Perry, what Perry needs to do is give the National Guards orders not to allow the feds to be even in the area that they're actively patrolling and guarding.
[03:02:37.820 --> 03:02:43.820]  You know, since they're being deployed by the governor himself, it's not a war activity.
[03:02:43.820 --> 03:02:49.820]  So, the federal government and their federal agencies have zero authority to do anything.
[03:02:49.820 --> 03:02:59.820]  What needs to happen is Governor Perry and the Texas Guard need to restrain and just ignore any requests by these feds and federal agencies.
[03:02:59.820 --> 03:03:08.820]  I know, but the Mexican government won't take the people back, so we can't just stick everybody in a prison camp indefinitely.
[03:03:08.820 --> 03:03:10.820]  You've got to have a way to deport them.
[03:03:10.820 --> 03:03:12.820]  So, it's a very complex issue.
[03:03:12.820 --> 03:03:15.820]  It's the federal government has the jurisdiction to do this.
[03:03:15.820 --> 03:03:17.820]  This is one of the few things they're supposed to do.
[03:03:17.820 --> 03:03:19.820]  So, of course, they're not doing it.
[03:03:19.820 --> 03:03:20.820]  You can't blame the border patrol.
[03:03:20.820 --> 03:03:22.820]  They've been ordered to stand down.
[03:03:22.820 --> 03:03:24.820]  I mean, they should speak up more, but they are speaking up.
[03:03:24.820 --> 03:03:25.820]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:25.820 --> 03:03:26.820]  Interesting points, James.
[03:03:26.820 --> 03:03:29.820]  Dennis in Texas, you're our tail gunner.
[03:03:29.820 --> 03:03:30.820]  Go ahead.
[03:03:30.820 --> 03:03:37.820]  Yeah, what basically I wanted to speak about was something that I think is very much overlooked,
[03:03:37.820 --> 03:03:47.820]  and that is basically how much the church is involved and what's going on.
[03:03:47.820 --> 03:03:48.820]  Oh, yeah.
[03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:50.820]  They're 501c3 faith-based initiative.
[03:03:50.820 --> 03:03:54.820]  First, they made them anti-terror police where the preacher watches their flock.
[03:03:54.820 --> 03:03:56.820]  Now Baptist Church is Catholic.
[03:03:56.820 --> 03:03:57.820]  You name it.
[03:03:57.820 --> 03:03:59.820]  They're the ones running the end of the country.
[03:03:59.820 --> 03:04:01.820]  Yes, the Council of Churches.
[03:04:01.820 --> 03:04:10.820]  But the thing is, is the majority of the people coming out of Mexico and Central America is primarily Catholic.
[03:04:10.820 --> 03:04:19.820]  And the fact that the Pope and Obama met just before all this was rolled out, is that a coincidence?
[03:04:19.820 --> 03:04:23.820]  I don't think so.
[03:04:23.820 --> 03:04:27.820]  Well, I mean, I know that the Catholic Church has a lot of constituent south of the border.
[03:04:27.820 --> 03:04:32.820]  I know the Catholic Church, depending on which branch of it, which bishop it is, are involved in this heavily.
[03:04:32.820 --> 03:04:35.820]  But it's being directed by the federal government.
[03:04:35.820 --> 03:04:37.820]  I mean, we can blame the Catholic Church if we want to.
[03:04:37.820 --> 03:04:39.820]  I think pressure should be put on them.
[03:04:39.820 --> 03:04:46.820]  But it's being directed by the 501c3, which was unconstitutional, that grew into clergy response teams.
[03:04:46.820 --> 03:04:47.820]  That's illegal.
[03:04:47.820 --> 03:04:54.820]  It's now grown into open federal funding of churches through faith-based initiatives that started under George Bush that the Democrats just love.
[03:04:54.820 --> 03:05:18.820]  Whatever happened to the First Amendment, it went out the window.
