[00:56.240 --> 01:02.920]  this morning and I watched diehard the last one that came out I think diehard
[01:02.920 --> 01:11.680]  for whatever it is live free or diehard and it's all about hackers taking over
[01:11.680 --> 01:15.720]  and doing a fire sale is what it's called where they completely shut down
[01:15.720 --> 01:22.000]  everything that is computer-based and of course it's some rogue group of hackers
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.400]  that do it not the government but in truth it is the government that openly
[01:27.400 --> 01:32.440]  has said that they are looking at ways to shut the web and all computers not
[01:32.440 --> 01:38.920]  just in the US but in the world down and boy we sure are a society that are

[08:31.080 --> 08:34.400]  going on right now against not just the people of the United States but the
[08:34.400 --> 08:40.960]  people of Canada Europe investors worldwide there are hundreds of
[08:40.960 --> 08:47.360]  billions of dollars being stolen by the international banking cartel on a
[08:47.360 --> 08:53.600]  daily basis that is conservative by the way hundreds of billions of dollars
[08:53.600 --> 09:00.520]  being stolen mainstream news is basically trying to create a panic while
[09:00.520 --> 09:03.680]  at the same time talking about the other side of their mouth claiming that
[09:03.680 --> 09:07.640]  everything is going to be okay so that they can't be accused of trying to cause
[09:07.640 --> 09:16.040]  a panic it's a very simple thing to understand on a daily basis now for the
[09:16.040 --> 09:27.040]  last two weeks institutions much larger and much more leveraged than in run are
[09:27.040 --> 09:33.280]  going under in run made hundreds of thousands of people lose their jobs
[09:33.280 --> 09:39.600]  millions of investors took a big hit a lot of people lost their retirement and
[09:39.600 --> 09:45.040]  they were not given help a few people got maybe 10 cents on the dollar out of
[09:45.040 --> 09:53.600]  it and then Ken lay after he was convicted conveniently died in his home
[09:53.600 --> 10:00.080]  in Aspen, Colorado if you believe any of that he's probably basking in the
[10:00.080 --> 10:08.520]  Maui son with Whitman price and had died his debt to society paid in full I mean
[10:08.520 --> 10:13.280]  with this government as corrupt as it is there's no telling remember he later
[10:13.280 --> 10:20.200]  became secretary of the army mr. White he was the head of operations on the
[10:20.200 --> 10:24.400]  west coast for in run and he would give the state legislature walk through so
[10:24.400 --> 10:30.160]  the in run energy trading command center big computer screens running fake
[10:30.160 --> 10:35.440]  computer simulations showing them energy trading going on there there wasn't
[10:35.440 --> 10:39.440]  any energy trading going on it was it was fake they would just make up whatever
[10:39.440 --> 10:45.680]  numbers they wanted and some days would built the Californian taxpayers for more
[10:45.680 --> 10:51.600]  than a billion dollars a day and that went on for several years it of course
[10:51.600 --> 10:58.600]  was a money laundering operation for drug cartels and the CIA offshore and when
[10:58.600 --> 11:01.800]  they were done with it they closed it up like an umbrella all the real assets
[11:01.800 --> 11:05.200]  have been moved out the back and they just told the public there's been some
[11:05.200 --> 11:08.520]  mismanagement and that's why hundreds of billions of dollars had just
[11:08.520 --> 11:11.720]  disappeared into a black hole
[11:11.720 --> 11:19.360]  well that's the same thing that's going on here but every day every day there
[11:19.360 --> 11:24.440]  are events much bigger than in run and you'll you'll hear the news say and
[11:24.440 --> 11:28.960]  federal and federal regulators say who by the way all come out of these
[11:28.960 --> 11:34.040]  companies they'll say oh um there was some mismanagement they did some things
[11:34.040 --> 11:40.800]  that probably weren't completely kosher but nothing illegals been done that's
[11:40.800 --> 11:48.760]  right taking junk debt that they knew when they sold it wasn't gonna be paid
[11:48.760 --> 11:52.280]  back but they knew they were gonna actually cause the run on the securities
[11:52.280 --> 12:00.680]  that's part of the Ponzi scheme and selling it as solid gold triple A rated
[12:00.680 --> 12:09.120]  government-backed securities standing behind Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and
[12:09.120 --> 12:12.880]  then that's why you saw banks popping up like McDonald's all over the country
[12:12.880 --> 12:16.560]  I mean here in Texas I'm not exaggerating by my house they built
[12:16.560 --> 12:23.000]  probably I don't know within a mile 10 banks two years ago just just banks
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.120]  everywhere just just banks with no customers you might see one car drive
[12:27.120 --> 12:31.920]  through every once in a while just just everywhere new subsidiaries new names
[12:31.920 --> 12:37.440]  thousands of new banks because they could take those asset those assets those
[12:37.440 --> 12:43.520]  securities government-backed that means taxpayer-backed and go deposit it as a
[12:43.520 --> 12:47.600]  asset and then loan out 10 times more and then take the money from that bank
[12:47.600 --> 12:53.960]  and set up another bank and loan out 10 times more or nine to one of you want to
[12:53.960 --> 12:57.120]  get technical the fractional reserve banking here in the US but then they
[12:57.120 --> 13:03.320]  by the mid 90s they just got rid of that and just said unlimited and then I
[13:03.320 --> 13:07.200]  found out about the IMF World Bank plan which wasn't hidden it was in the BBC
[13:07.200 --> 13:10.640]  news other places to do that in the west and to leverage everything out and
[13:10.640 --> 13:14.040]  then implode it and then actually have riots in the streets for food and water
[13:14.040 --> 13:19.320]  and then bring in martial law and I said man this doesn't sound too good I
[13:19.320 --> 13:23.920]  better go on the radio and warn people and I got left it like I always do it's
[13:23.920 --> 13:28.720]  all real funny drinking sodium fluoride taking mercury shots prisons popping up
[13:28.720 --> 13:33.280]  everywhere cops in black uniforms with ski masks with no identification cameras
[13:33.280 --> 13:40.600]  going up it's you know on every street corner it's real funny it's real all of
[13:40.600 --> 13:51.240]  it's real funny isn't it I remember a 1998 I saw a blurb online put up by an
[13:51.240 --> 13:54.760]  industry publication about how Dell was going to move most its factories to
[13:54.760 --> 13:59.280]  China so I walk up to Michael Dell at a smart growth land grab conference he was
[13:59.280 --> 14:03.200]  heading up here in Austin I said well I read you're going to move the next
[14:03.200 --> 14:06.560]  five years most your factories to China he just laughed at me and said you're a
[14:06.560 --> 14:09.920]  liar and then just gave me the most devilish smile and just laughed at me
[14:09.920 --> 14:16.600]  it's a big joke because he knows and the insiders know this nation was born to be
[14:16.600 --> 14:22.640]  butchered like a fat hog and then these delionaires people that you know had
[14:22.640 --> 14:26.880]  Dell stock and think they're rich they call into my show and say dad he's
[14:26.880 --> 14:31.360]  telling the truth you're a liar and then and we're an American company and
[14:31.360 --> 14:36.920]  we're going to do great and there's not just arrogant full of themselves
[14:36.920 --> 14:43.160]  self-assured it's it's delusional I haven't walked around self-assured and
[14:43.160 --> 14:47.080]  delusional since I was about three years old imagining that I was a superhero on
[14:47.080 --> 14:51.920]  the back porch on a sunny spring day and then I had self-awareness suddenly
[14:51.920 --> 14:55.600]  happened and I realized there's this giant world a universe around me I'm an
[14:55.600 --> 15:00.680]  individual I don't really countless I make myself count and that it was
[15:00.680 --> 15:05.480]  embarrassing to be imagining that I was a superhero jumping off the back steps
[15:05.480 --> 15:10.680]  these adults though folks they are like three-year-olds that never woke up it's
[15:10.680 --> 15:14.640]  dress up it's play land all these people go into the steak houses and the golf
[15:14.640 --> 15:18.000]  courses with their heads up in the air and looking at each other looking at
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.760]  each other's jewelry and just all into it and I'm not even saying things are bad
[15:22.760 --> 15:27.240]  but the worshiping of it to the point of where you worship things so much you'd
[15:27.240 --> 15:30.760]  buy into a fraudulent stock market system and you buy into a system that was
[15:30.760 --> 15:36.840]  designed to totally steal all of our real wealth and with leveraged fiat
[15:36.840 --> 15:42.960]  currency make us from the richest surplus nation greatest manufacturing
[15:42.960 --> 15:47.920]  greatest patents ideas best universities most informed intelligent
[15:47.920 --> 15:52.640]  dynamic people to being what we are now people who bought into lies bought into
[15:52.640 --> 15:59.040]  frauds there's been millions of lies we've all bought into them and now we
[15:59.040 --> 16:02.080]  are in the slaughterhouse being brought through the slaughter pens
[16:02.080 --> 16:08.520]  economically and a lot of these bovine two-legged cows don't even know they're
[16:08.520 --> 16:13.040]  in a slaughter pen they don't even know history that they are still giggling and
[16:13.040 --> 16:19.640]  smirking and laughing and the sick thing about it is we could have turned this
[16:19.640 --> 16:26.760]  around at any time now you probably can't turn it around I mean they're
[16:26.760 --> 16:32.440]  bringing down the gas powered gas powered bolt air powered bolt big old hammer
[16:32.440 --> 16:36.200]  to knock us right in the head and hang us up by our hind legs and slit our
[16:36.200 --> 16:44.840]  throat blade us out and it's very painful to me to see this happening very
[16:44.840 --> 16:53.400]  painful to see this happening and developing but this is what happens to
[16:53.400 --> 16:59.120]  decadent evil countries of self-assured near-duels the problem is there's a lot
[16:59.120 --> 17:02.040]  of good people in this nation a lot of people that have fought against this
[17:02.040 --> 17:07.480]  evil and corruption have been laughed at and we don't deserve this we don't
[17:07.480 --> 17:18.880]  deserve this to happen to us but say live you will see what happens this is
[17:18.880 --> 17:22.760]  from prisonplanet.com Paul Watson excellent analysis article you could
[17:22.760 --> 17:26.840]  read this story and get more than you get from reading 30 MSNBC stories or CNBC

[18:13.000 --> 18:18.480]  illegal has been done nothing bad was done the banks are good it's a slack
[18:18.480 --> 18:25.000]  jawed citizens who went and lied on their applications they were told to do
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.480]  that the whole system was and that was only one small part of this this that
[18:28.480 --> 18:35.280]  isn't what's bringing things down that's only two hundred billion dollars it's
[18:35.280 --> 18:40.640]  the entire system was rigged and they've taken trillions of dollars and
[18:40.640 --> 18:48.680]  leverage that out that's the problem but the public turns on their TV and and
[18:48.680 --> 18:52.320]  still tunes into the same business news channels that have lied to them all these
[18:52.320 --> 18:59.240]  years and tell me what to do now tell me what to do now Barack Obama John McCain
[18:59.240 --> 19:04.880]  save me Sarah Palin save me run on the bank you know things are bad when you
[19:04.880 --> 19:07.760]  are the most tragic website in the world and usually prepare a mindless celebrity
[19:07.760 --> 19:13.040]  gossip that writes a story about how Americans could lose their bank deposits
[19:13.040 --> 19:16.360]  following the collapse of Lehman Brothers for the internet giant to
[19:16.360 --> 19:21.160]  prominently report that there is already a slow motion run on banks is indeed a
[19:21.160 --> 19:25.880]  landmark event you know that's what I called it slow motion run on banks about
[19:25.880 --> 19:30.320]  a year ago and precludes even that's a slow motion red dawn but it's not
[19:30.320 --> 19:34.920]  Soviets taking over it's North com and the Pentagon eating America it's all
[19:34.920 --> 19:39.880]  military this is all being militarily run with precision bringing the economic
[19:39.880 --> 19:45.000]  structure down as they suck up the pieces and precludes even the most
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.160]  ignorant American from claiming they were not forewarned about the unfolding
[19:48.160 --> 19:53.080]  economic catastrophe I'm gonna run through the economic news then we're

[20:19.400 --> 20:23.200]  take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the

[20:27.040 --> 20:32.960]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli
[20:32.960 --> 20:37.480]  citizens have been detained in London's connections to the CIA the hijackers

[24:41.760 --> 24:45.960]  mainstream media is saying run on banks the article points out that all of the
[24:45.960 --> 24:49.720]  federal deposit insurance corporation guarantees individual accounts up to
[24:49.720 --> 24:55.440]  $100,000 the Fed the FDIC but only has about 50 billion to ensure about one
[24:55.440 --> 25:01.640]  trillion and assets across the nation's financial institutions one trillion and
[25:01.640 --> 25:07.640]  assets it's a lot more than that that's in trouble I mean it Fannie Mae and
[25:07.640 --> 25:12.400]  Freddie Macquitts 50 something trillion on the books and that's leveraged out
[25:12.400 --> 25:18.040]  thousands of trillions that's what these bankers did they just created out of
[25:18.040 --> 25:24.840]  nothing all this liquidity so they could buy the world up but now they want to
[25:24.840 --> 25:30.520]  fully implode the economy so they can buy up the pieces in Northcom is there to
[25:30.520 --> 25:35.880]  make sure that happens caught our military totally turned against us
[25:35.880 --> 25:42.960]  trained all the TV and movies that we're the enemy God help us they train the
[25:42.960 --> 25:46.240]  police that there's thousands of white al-qaeda everywhere about to attack that
[25:46.240 --> 25:49.880]  white people are al-qaeda you know first it's just those brown people in the
[25:49.880 --> 25:55.200]  racist get behind that and well it's actually you when Americans realize the
[25:55.200 --> 25:59.360]  fact that banks are going to run out of money the article nonchalantly states
[25:59.360 --> 26:04.840]  around the banks will accelerate warning comes from top economists
[26:04.840 --> 26:10.920]  Norealy Robini we've had him on we'll get him back on of NYU Stern School of
[26:10.920 --> 26:17.200]  RGE monitor who correctly predicted the severity of the credit crunch he says
[26:17.200 --> 26:20.920]  there is already a slow-motion run on retail banks occurring nationwide
[26:20.920 --> 26:23.640]  he advises that people with accounts over a hundred thousand dollars in
[26:23.640 --> 26:27.840]  value should at least spread the amount among different firms use of such
[26:27.840 --> 26:31.040]  inflammatory language like a run on the bank especially for the most visited
[26:31.040 --> 26:35.480]  website on the entire planet is a phenomenon and other news websites as
[26:35.480 --> 26:40.360]  well as financial advisors have been cautious to use such terms in an effort
[26:40.360 --> 26:45.040]  to prevent panic for example we read in today's Seattle Post intelligence sir
[26:45.040 --> 26:49.960]  that Sarah Hassan an analyst with Seattle's McAdams right Reagan Inc. since
[26:49.960 --> 26:53.560]  she didn't even want to use the word run on a bank during an interview because
[26:53.560 --> 26:57.840]  these are very touchy times other advisors are more upfront with their
[26:57.840 --> 27:02.200]  warnings first off go ahead and make a run on your banks if you have money with
[27:02.200 --> 27:06.680]  a brokerage firm or a bank that is in trouble get your money the heck out of
[27:06.680 --> 27:14.120]  there writes Joe Ponziio in reality I don't want to cause it run on banks but
[27:14.120 --> 27:17.480]  I wouldn't prevent one by saying that everything is fine that you shouldn't
[27:17.480 --> 27:20.800]  wait until it's too late my recommendation is move your important
[27:20.800 --> 27:23.680]  savings and check-ins accounts to banks that have a higher likelihood of
[27:23.680 --> 27:33.520]  weathering the storm he adds good God and it just goes on you know to read the
[27:33.520 --> 27:36.800]  comments on it that that's really what's interesting they're on prison
[27:36.800 --> 27:42.880]  planet dot com stocks slide at the open markets follow the worst pounding in
[27:42.880 --> 27:46.760]  years with further declines 500 points yesterday hundreds of more points today
[27:46.760 --> 27:51.240]  up and down since then as Goldman Sachs reports disappointments and then the
[27:51.240 --> 27:55.720]  disappointment is billions and billions and losses which signal the other banks
[27:55.720 --> 28:02.240]  going under oh boy stock slipped Tuesday morning as investors considered
[28:02.240 --> 28:07.000]  Goldman Sachs mixed profit report with the latest Federal Reserve policy
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.600]  meeting after the previous sessions brutal sell-off the Dow Jones industrial

[28:15.240 --> 28:21.000]  declined in early going Goldman Sachs reported earnings of a third quarter
[28:21.000 --> 28:27.040]  which missed analysts expectations revenue it goes on the financial firm
[28:27.040 --> 28:33.760]  reported revenue of 6.4 billion and that profit of 845 million or 1.81 per share
[28:33.760 --> 28:40.440]  it goes on among other early movers Lehman shares inched higher the open
[28:40.440 --> 28:44.740]  trading make of America lost 5% Merrill Lynch inched higher as AIG loss under
[28:44.740 --> 28:50.840]  65% black Monday Goldin's Goldman's financial challenges pale when compared
[28:50.840 --> 29:01.680]  to other firms and it goes over what happened on Monday 2001 on that black
[29:01.680 --> 29:09.520]  Monday September 17 2001 but that happened once it didn't happen every day
[29:12.480 --> 29:20.240]  that's the difference is that we have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac tens of
[29:20.240 --> 29:25.680]  trillions of dollars leveraged out illegally in every other type of
[29:25.680 --> 29:32.440]  commodity and market and security you can imagine their books are secret it's

[33:12.720 --> 33:18.560]  we are seeing in Ron level collapses every day
[33:18.560 --> 33:22.760]  Fannie Mae Freddie Mac going into receivership with the Treasury Dr.
[33:22.760 --> 33:26.320]  Roberts former Wall Street Journal editor I had a policy to partner the
[33:26.320 --> 33:30.000]  Treasury father of Reaganomics Joseph Stiklitz Nobel Prize winner in
[33:30.000 --> 33:37.080]  economics joining us in the next hour author of the $3 trillion war but Dr.
[33:37.080 --> 33:40.960]  Roberts said he didn't know if the Treasury would be able to even sustain
[33:40.960 --> 33:45.720]  sustain this and not go bankrupt itself or not have the world see it as
[33:45.720 --> 33:51.440]  insolvent last week when he joined us when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac got in
[33:51.440 --> 33:57.960]  so much trouble and now we've seen all these other major brokerage firms in
[33:57.960 --> 34:03.200]  deep trouble Goldman Sachs now in trouble today of course everybody knows
[34:03.200 --> 34:09.120]  what happened yesterday with a another major firm going under Bank of America
[34:09.120 --> 34:17.960]  buying another firm and this is just really getting serious and to answer
[34:17.960 --> 34:21.320]  the question from last week we have confirmed it has been confirmed the
[34:21.320 --> 34:26.360]  Treasury is backing the securities out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that were
[34:26.360 --> 34:30.360]  sold and and and so those are now government back not just the bad
[34:30.360 --> 34:36.080]  mortgages and jumbo loans of above $500,000 so for this one segment we are
[34:36.080 --> 34:41.320]  joined by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts author of the second edition just came out the
[34:41.320 --> 34:45.880]  tyranny of good intentions thanks for coming on
[34:45.880 --> 34:57.160]  Dr. Roberts where do you see things going here well Alex there's been there's
[34:57.160 --> 35:05.320]  being a lot of concentration in the financial sector it looks like the end
[35:05.320 --> 35:12.760]  of independent broker dealers and so we're moving into what marks or linen or
[35:12.760 --> 35:21.160]  somebody would have called financial monopoly capitalism this concentration
[35:21.160 --> 35:33.640]  is what it will take I guess to prevent this from unraveling what happened was
[35:33.640 --> 35:42.360]  all of this in my opinion is consequence of too much deregulation things would
[35:42.360 --> 35:49.560]  be regulated to the point that firms these independent broker dealers like
[35:49.560 --> 35:58.360]  Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, Barrister and they did not have enough
[35:58.360 --> 36:06.120]  capitalization to back the risk that they assumed in these new deregulated
[36:06.120 --> 36:11.360]  financial instruments like subprime derivatives collateral debt obligations
[36:11.360 --> 36:15.920]  no one really knew what the value of these things were because the risk had
[36:15.920 --> 36:25.480]  never been analyzed and so they lacked the capitalization to sustain the risk
[36:25.480 --> 36:32.360]  and so there they seem to be for the most part going out of business I don't
[36:32.360 --> 36:38.320]  know that means anything other than just more concentration it's kind of like the
[36:38.320 --> 36:44.920]  deregulation of the airlines we've got fewer and fewer airlines a lot of
[36:44.920 --> 36:51.840]  deregulation happened when the pendulum swung against over regulation it went
[36:51.840 --> 36:57.240]  too far in the other direction became an ideology you know the deregulation of
[36:57.240 --> 37:04.800]  electric power gave us in rod so I don't think it means the end of the world I
[37:04.800 --> 37:11.040]  think we have to have some concern that the Treasury's assumption of the Fannie
[37:11.040 --> 37:17.760]  May and Freddie Mac risk since we don't really know what those risks are that the
[37:17.760 --> 37:25.280]  Treasury could possibly impair its own credit spending it might no longer be
[37:25.280 --> 37:31.680]  seen as the safest government bond it may fall below any number of European
[37:31.680 --> 37:37.640]  countries or Japan in its ranking but I don't think it means necessarily the
[37:37.640 --> 37:44.680]  end of the United States the problems that we face that are more serious than
[37:44.680 --> 37:51.560]  its financial trouble that we're experiencing is the budget deficit and
[37:51.560 --> 37:56.360]  the trade deficit and these are pushed in to the background they kind of
[37:56.360 --> 38:03.520]  submerged because of the focus on the current issue but they are the more
[38:03.520 --> 38:09.440]  serious problem because how can you close a trade deficit which could be
[38:09.440 --> 38:13.400]  approaching a trillion dollars a year when you don't have factories when you
[38:13.400 --> 38:18.960]  don't have anything to sell because you're off-shoring not just the the
[38:18.960 --> 38:23.120]  manufactured goods but also the tradeable services research the
[38:23.120 --> 38:28.600]  development the engineering just recently Duke University is issued a
[38:28.600 --> 38:35.320]  report that that these high value added services that were considered too
[38:35.320 --> 38:42.920]  proprietary too much of the core business to be outsourced abroad are now
[38:42.920 --> 38:49.640]  being moved offshore so we don't just lose the tradeable goods we lose the
[38:49.640 --> 38:54.080]  tradeable services so how do you close that deficit well even weapons
[38:54.080 --> 38:59.640]  development outfits aren't just building the cluster bombs and tanks and in
[38:59.640 --> 39:04.280]  weapon systems offshore they are now as you said having different research and
[39:04.280 --> 39:09.720]  development done even in quote enemy countries like quote communist China
[39:09.720 --> 39:14.840]  right and and the better reason to worry about that fact it might be one way we
[39:14.840 --> 39:18.880]  can curtail the wall making proclivities of the republican well let me ask you
[39:18.880 --> 39:27.640]  this Dr. Roberts yeah we were talking to a syndicated columnist author and of
[39:27.640 --> 39:32.920]  course he's an economist a former head of policy department of the Treasury Dr.
[39:32.920 --> 39:37.280]  Paul Kirk Roberts doesn't it also increase the deficit to have the
[39:37.280 --> 39:42.920]  Treasury bailing out all these quote financial institution right and then
[39:42.920 --> 39:48.800]  further devout devalue the dollar down the road that's right it increases the
[39:48.800 --> 39:52.280]  budget deficit we have the two deficits the trade deficit and the budget
[39:52.280 --> 39:57.040]  deficit so when the Treasury assumes these responsibilities it's likely
[39:57.040 --> 40:01.360]  congressional budget office said the other day that the revenues now of
[40:01.360 --> 40:06.320]  many million Freddie Mac should be included in the federal budget and
[40:06.320 --> 40:11.880]  their expenditures should be included well obviously the expenditures are
[40:11.880 --> 40:16.480]  greater than the revenues that's why they had to be taken over so yes that
[40:16.480 --> 40:22.160]  will automatically increase the amount of money the Treasury has to borrow every
[40:22.160 --> 40:28.720]  year for the federal government to operate so and that of course puts more
[40:28.720 --> 40:35.160]  pressure on on the dollar at some point the rest of the world which is
[40:35.160 --> 40:42.960]  financing us realizes that there's just too many dollar obligations for them to
[40:42.960 --> 40:48.800]  be good and when they stop buying the bonds that's when reality hits Americans
[40:48.800 --> 40:53.720]  and when it hits Washington because then they realize hey you know we've been
[40:53.720 --> 40:58.600]  dependent all this time on foreigners to operate the government on a daily basis
[40:58.600 --> 41:04.480]  and we've abused that to such an extent we've scared off the lenders and that's
[41:04.480 --> 41:10.520]  those are the problems that are lurking that are far more serious than the
[41:10.520 --> 41:14.680]  failure of layman brothers or Merrill Lynch being bought by Mike of America
[41:14.680 --> 41:23.680]  or whatever the remaining independent broken dealers who will possibly be
[41:23.680 --> 41:29.360]  pushed into being acquired by some commercial bank apparently these can
[41:29.360 --> 41:34.280]  big commercial banks I don't really understand the mechanics of it I haven't
[41:34.280 --> 41:39.920]  had time to think about it but they feel that these big commercial banks are
[41:39.920 --> 41:46.000]  protected by so many deposits that they I don't quite know how the accounting
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.800]  works but somehow this shields the investment parts from being under
[41:51.800 --> 41:57.320]  capitalized so when really what they're doing is infecting everybody's savings
[41:57.320 --> 42:04.240]  and pension funds right now by moving all of this bad debt and all these dirty
[42:04.240 --> 42:12.680]  securities into Bank of America and others well Bank of America wouldn't have
[42:12.680 --> 42:18.040]  taken this they didn't see it to be there they're advantageous sometimes the
[42:18.040 --> 42:23.760]  company's get insolvency doesn't always mean the company doesn't have a future
[42:23.760 --> 42:29.040]  when things turn around it just means it can't last that long and and that's
[42:29.040 --> 42:34.200]  probably the case oh no I understand the big banks the Federal Reserve stock
[42:34.200 --> 42:37.600]  holding banks certainly like what's happening and that's where we may differ
[42:37.600 --> 42:42.160]  I believe this has all been engineered it may have gotten out of control but you
[42:42.160 --> 42:45.840]  know I read the I'm out they have to be pretty smart to know how this would
[42:45.840 --> 42:51.240]  would work out but whether it's engineered or not it is leading to
[42:51.240 --> 42:56.040]  financial concentration now huh which is what the elite wants I mean could you
[42:56.040 --> 43:03.160]  come up with a more dastardly plan if you tried to to offshore our industry to
[43:03.160 --> 43:08.000]  dumb our population down to militarize our police to then run us up to debts
[43:08.000 --> 43:13.440]  that never before seen even in Imperial Rome and then to set up a domestic
[43:13.440 --> 43:17.720]  police state and have North com over the people and to have our new industry be
[43:17.720 --> 43:22.040]  prisons and military I mean that's really I mean I'm you talk about the
[43:22.040 --> 43:26.480]  greater threat being our trade deficit I agree with you but but even if everything
[43:26.480 --> 43:31.040]  fell apart tomorrow we had a depression if we had liberty and some free market
[43:31.040 --> 43:35.360]  system we could build it back up but if all we have is North com in the prison
[43:35.360 --> 43:42.440]  system left and a lazy population I don't see us ever digging out of that I
[43:42.440 --> 43:47.520]  see us becoming a banana Republic Dr. Roberts well Alex if I was this
[43:47.520 --> 43:53.240]  elite and I was that cleverer I would rather be taking the cream off the top
[43:53.240 --> 43:57.000]  of highly prosperous and successful country I know I don't see how it would
[43:57.000 --> 44:05.000]  be my advantage to run it into the ground so this this I think is what
[44:05.000 --> 44:11.160]  problematic about the elite warning to destroy the country I I can see that we
[44:11.160 --> 44:17.040]  want to have power more control but they they certainly don't gain from creating
[44:17.040 --> 44:22.120]  a situation in which they can't borrow money and in which they can't fund the
[44:22.120 --> 44:25.120]  military oh no no no listen I agree with you that it's gotten out of their
[44:25.120 --> 44:28.880]  control and I've had a lot of other you know analysts on and and I want to see
[44:28.880 --> 44:32.040]  me disagree with them but they're saying they plan to get everybody in debt they
[44:32.040 --> 44:35.160]  wanted to you know create these fraudulent securities to leverage them to
[44:35.160 --> 44:39.400]  buy up more real assets and commodities and that it did get out of control a
[44:39.400 --> 44:43.920]  couple years ago Alex I don't think they plan to get everybody that what what
[44:43.920 --> 44:47.760]  they did they fool themselves with free trade theory and thought that all
[44:47.760 --> 44:52.800]  showing was free trade and that we would benefit and when they found out what
[44:52.800 --> 44:57.960]  they're really doing is killing consumer demand because people were losing the
[44:57.960 --> 45:02.800]  jobs and the income then they said oh well we can substitute low interest rates
[45:02.800 --> 45:07.600]  and a housing boom if we drive up their housing prices they'll be richer they
[45:07.600 --> 45:11.560]  can refinance them and spend the money and we'll have a service economy and
[45:11.560 --> 45:15.480]  we'll call putting a hamburger together manufacturing so I think it's really
[45:15.480 --> 45:21.280]  just a low grade of fault rather than a supermind out there okay well then what
[45:21.280 --> 45:24.440]  is Homeland Security all about I mean you've written a book about it you know
[45:24.440 --> 45:28.400]  it's martial law you know they're gearing up for it they admit they are both
[45:28.400 --> 45:31.920]  parties are bought and paid for by the same interest I mean what what is all
[45:31.920 --> 45:38.160]  that for yeah that that question it deserves far more attention than it
[45:38.160 --> 45:45.280]  gets it's obviously not about terrorists to which they aren't in and I would say
[45:45.280 --> 45:51.680]  that the police agencies never want to be accountable they never want
[45:51.680 --> 45:56.820]  accountability you know years ago when in New York we were trying to have police
[45:56.820 --> 46:01.080]  review boards and the police professing the conservatives were
[46:01.080 --> 46:06.080]  professing this would make the police in effect fuel and all that they don't like
[46:06.080 --> 46:12.880]  accountability and so they've always got some kind of legislation on hand that
[46:12.880 --> 46:16.640]  makes them less accountable and gives them more power and they use whatever
[46:16.640 --> 46:24.120]  happens to advance that because the the Patriot Act for example was was was
[46:24.120 --> 46:31.320]  written long long before 9-11 and even before anybody planned 9-11 because it
[46:31.320 --> 46:35.840]  was waiting for an opportunity so they always want to be unaccountable they
[46:35.840 --> 46:41.680]  don't like accountability no that's right via Den and and and and Ashcroft and
[46:41.680 --> 46:47.080]  Chertoff they admittedly just just bundled a lot of other laws they'd
[46:47.080 --> 46:50.720]  already tried to pass I mean that's admitted some of it written in the 80s
[46:50.720 --> 46:56.280]  and just stuck it all together and then passed it that's right and and of course
[46:56.280 --> 47:01.760]  the law and order conservatives who think that crime is rampant and they
[47:01.760 --> 47:05.640]  always want the police to have more power and be less accountable so there's
[47:05.640 --> 47:12.080]  so many factors out there pushing for unaccountability that just like on the
[47:12.080 --> 47:16.040]  economy so where do you see the economy going I mean this this looks like well
[47:16.040 --> 47:20.320]  that's a that's another very important question you know in the past when we
[47:20.320 --> 47:24.560]  had a recession we had a recession because the economy heated up inflation
[47:24.560 --> 47:29.840]  moved up the Fed cut down on the money supply
[47:29.840 --> 47:36.120]  sales fell off inventory is built firms laid off workers and then when the
[47:36.120 --> 47:40.040]  recession set in the Fed would switch gears and lower the interest rates again
[47:40.040 --> 47:45.160]  and get the credit out things would pick back up and sales would pick up and
[47:45.160 --> 47:50.080]  they would rehire the workers well that's not what we've got anymore the
[47:50.080 --> 47:58.080]  jobs are gone they're offshore the consumer is overloaded with debt credit
[47:58.080 --> 48:05.600]  card debt mortgage debt you can't get any more consumer demand out of debt
[48:05.600 --> 48:10.680]  expansion they don't have any ability to bear any more debt and the jobs are
[48:10.680 --> 48:16.320]  gone so they can't pull those back with an anti recessionary policy so the
[48:16.320 --> 48:22.680]  question is what we'll call the economy to pick up I think that's an open
[48:22.680 --> 48:25.440]  question I don't know what and maybe that's why they want to start World War
[48:25.440 --> 48:33.600]  3 well you know since they have no way to finance the war except far and bar I
[48:33.600 --> 48:40.200]  don't know if far the foreigners want us to start World War 3 do they do they
[48:40.200 --> 48:45.040]  want to lend us the money to start it I don't know but those are the kinds of
[48:45.040 --> 48:50.000]  constraints that are not discussed in the media they're not discussed in the
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.520]  presidential campaign well what about this they're not even talking about
[48:53.520 --> 48:57.960]  prosecuting anybody or even investigating to prosecute with all the
[48:57.960 --> 49:01.840]  scams that have been going on I mean that's another dangerous sign right
[49:01.840 --> 49:09.120]  there yes I think it is look at the fact that that Cheney's lawyer forged the
[49:09.120 --> 49:14.760]  signature of the Attorney General on a document that the Department of Justice
[49:14.760 --> 49:20.400]  would not approve you know this is now now it just came out tens of millions of
[49:20.400 --> 49:24.640]  fines under Cheney's orders when he headed up Halliburton to Nigeria and
[49:24.640 --> 49:29.760]  nothing happens it comes out in major papers yeah I mean that exactly it's
[49:29.760 --> 49:34.240]  like a corruption is just running rampant there's a lack of any kind of
[49:34.240 --> 49:41.440]  accountability and this is an extremely serious problem for the social and
[49:41.440 --> 49:49.240]  political order for the legal order it's like the laws just are not applied
[49:49.240 --> 49:57.000]  they're not enforced and it's very difficult to describe a sociopolitical
[49:57.000 --> 50:03.520]  system that doesn't apply its own law it's a kleptocracy it's a selectively
[50:03.520 --> 50:08.520]  enforced kleptocracy where the elite are above the law but then write
[50:08.520 --> 50:15.080]  unconstitutional laws for we the people well you see not all the elite above I
[50:15.080 --> 50:19.840]  mean Lehman brothers has to be the elite and they they're going down the
[50:19.840 --> 50:25.840]  tubes Merrill Lynch is the most famous brokerage firm in the world and they
[50:25.840 --> 50:33.360]  had to become part of a commercial bank so it's just difficult to understand
[50:33.360 --> 50:39.800]  other than the American people don't seem to have any real awareness of what
[50:39.800 --> 50:45.000]  is transpiring and of the risk to the kind of social economic system they
[50:45.000 --> 50:51.160]  live in and to them personally and so it seems like what we are witnessing is
[50:51.160 --> 50:56.280]  a dissolution a mass mental illness part stay there still we got a break stay
[50:56.280 --> 51:02.280]  there for one second I want to say bye to you during the break a day unlike any
[51:02.280 --> 51:07.080]  other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against

[51:11.800 --> 51:16.080]  bin Laden this is his M.O. we have to look to the Middle East we have to look to

[51:24.760 --> 51:28.680]  u.s. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in
[51:28.680 --> 51:34.280]  spying in and on the u.s. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[51:34.280 --> 51:39.080]  detained in Laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI the

[54:22.080 --> 54:27.760]  we're gonna finish up dr. roberts comment and then we got Joseph piglets coming up
[54:27.760 --> 54:32.920]  Nobel Prize winner for economics he's been forecasting what we're now getting to
[54:32.920 --> 54:36.680]  see happen basically saying a lot of the same things dr. roberts is saying they
[54:36.680 --> 54:39.800]  have different theories about how to implement things they both agree on
[54:39.800 --> 54:43.960]  unaccountability corruption is the source of it and during the break we were
[54:43.960 --> 54:46.920]  talking about roberts about I was saying what's the fount where does all this
[54:46.920 --> 54:52.880]  flow and you you were saying hubris arrogance just delusional megalomania I
[54:52.880 --> 54:57.440]  guess and and I agree with you the greater threat is just the basic
[54:57.440 --> 55:03.800]  unaccountability by the system itself and a kind of delusion so so finishing
[55:03.800 --> 55:09.360]  up your statement yes that's right it's ignorance and hubris it's true of the
[55:09.360 --> 55:13.800]  investment banks for example I mean there's no accountability there but they
[55:13.800 --> 55:20.480]  they took shameless risk they should you know no no institution with integrity
[55:20.480 --> 55:28.880]  would have taken those kinds of risk it was greed driven and we no government
[55:28.880 --> 55:34.040]  would take the kind of risk with its finances or its diplomacy as the United
[55:34.040 --> 55:41.040]  States government has taken the last eight years and in the fact that the
[55:41.040 --> 55:47.480]  law is not applied it shows a complete lack of legal accountability I mean
[55:47.480 --> 55:56.040]  where are the bar associations where are the law schools why aren't justice is
[55:56.040 --> 56:01.560]  speaking out well where are all the judiciary committees of Congress if
[56:01.560 --> 56:08.440]  there's there's just no accountability the whole idea seems to be oh well we
[56:08.440 --> 56:15.120]  have to deal with terrorists how can we be accountable if we don't improve our
[56:15.120 --> 56:22.360]  bottom line shareholders will bring food or some takeover artists will show up
[56:22.360 --> 56:28.600]  on the doorstep or is this the total lack of accountability well it's the same
[56:28.600 --> 56:31.360]  thing that we've seen over and over again throughout history just just
[56:31.360 --> 56:36.680]  magnified in our current situation I mean take the surge the surge admittedly
[56:36.680 --> 56:40.920]  was tens of billions of dollars of hundred dollar bills on pallets paid off
[56:40.920 --> 56:44.480]  of the warlords right and and then I and then it's come out in the news I
[56:44.480 --> 56:48.560]  reported it two years before it was in the news that they give privates 30,000
[56:48.560 --> 56:52.720]  but that's to corrupt them they give kernels a hundred thousand they give
[56:52.720 --> 56:57.320]  millions to generals and then they kill all these army inspectors and and and
[56:57.320 --> 57:01.720]  people looking into corruption I mean this is it's like general amazade when
[57:01.720 --> 57:05.760]  he threatened general to goomba in the car saying you're being investigated and
[57:05.760 --> 57:10.600]  and to goomba investigating Abu Ghraib said it was then I realized I wasn't in
[57:10.600 --> 57:18.280]  the army anymore I was in the mafia good report yes I think you're you're right
[57:18.280 --> 57:23.280]  to be suspicious and it's a good thing you do report these things otherwise
[57:23.280 --> 57:30.120]  people simply will not will not know about them so just to sum up briefly this
[57:30.120 --> 57:38.320]  this is the financial mess but the real mess is submerged and that's the two
[57:38.320 --> 57:44.480]  ongoing deficits the budget and trade deficits what ways do they have of
[57:44.480 --> 57:52.960]  closing them it's not clear they have any at all I suspect that when and when
[57:52.960 --> 57:58.040]  the next dollar crisis hit and they start having trouble selling their bonds
[57:58.040 --> 58:03.760]  financing the government that they will make a run at private pensions they will
[58:03.760 --> 58:11.360]  simply say as my successor in the Treasury or Clinton appointee said that
[58:11.360 --> 58:18.920]  the build-up of private pensions is tax-free and therefore there should be a
[58:18.920 --> 58:25.640]  capital leave on the private pensions to make up for the tax-free build-up in
[58:25.640 --> 58:30.440]  other words the government should go in and recoup the tax-free build-up in
[58:30.440 --> 58:37.080]  pensions with a capital leavey and that this then could be used amazing paydown
[58:37.080 --> 58:43.000]  today I would imagine we're out of time dr. Roberts thank you the last thank you
[58:43.000 --> 58:55.240]  for listening to GCN visit GCN live on September 11th 2001 along with hundreds

[59:04.120 --> 59:11.520]  gives first responders a platform to tell their story Whitman EPA director on

[59:25.960 --> 59:30.040]  getting a countdown he takes his hand off and you know three two one and it was

[59:55.800 --> 1:00:09.120]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio networks big brother mainstream media government
[1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:16.720]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[1:00:16.720 --> 1:00:23.600]  network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:35.880 --> 1:00:39.400]  I gotta say it could have been a lot worse a lot of people would say in the
[1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:43.520]  scenario where you have several bank right if you could have people would
[1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:47.000]  say you get a thousand you get more the fact is it seems relatively well
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:50.440]  contained let's see bill gross is with us now chief investment officer pinco
[1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:54.200]  bill what do you think the right way to look at this is the market is afraid or
[1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:58.720]  wow you know what if you have a bank no one expected to go out of business I
[1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:02.120]  get bought this weekend another bank declare chapter 11 and the world's
[1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:06.320]  largest insurer trying to get a fed lifeline things are pretty good
[1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:13.920]  considering well I suppose and in terms of the stock market you know investors
[1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:18.560]  are afraid Aaron but I think in addition there's a technical situation a
[1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:22.800]  technical unwinded that's associated with layman it's primarily in the credit
[1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:27.400]  markets but it flows through to the stock markets and that is is that credit
[1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:32.000]  default swaps and interest rate swaps that were you know basically part of
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:36.920]  layman's book are now invalid and so all investors that dealt with layman and
[1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:40.400]  had positions with layman and then includes the street that includes your
[1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:43.880]  Goldman Sachs and Raul Lynch and includes pinco now we're scrambling to
[1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:48.640]  reinitiate those positions and it produces lots of volatility lots of
[1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:54.160]  uncertainty and technical positions that they need to be unwound do you have
[1:01:54.160 --> 1:01:59.920]  clarity of pinco right now about what your potential logs might be who the
[1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:03.680]  counterparties are I mean do you know or are you still trying to figure it out
[1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:08.600]  no we know exactly who our counterparties are we know exactly how much we
[1:02:08.600 --> 1:02:13.360]  have on with layman we came in over the weekend and determined that now in the
[1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:18.240]  absence of new capital leads to asset sales and lower prices and margin calls
[1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:22.280]  and further price declines and and you know last night's policy provisions
[1:02:22.280 --> 1:02:26.320]  were sort of private market dominated including the purchase of marrow okay
[1:02:26.320 --> 1:02:31.080]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us we do have Joseph Stiglitz
[1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:35.200]  for the next 30 minutes on the line with us we're gonna go to break in just a
[1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:40.960]  moment and come back with him a brief biography of Joseph Stiglitz of course
[1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:45.160]  he's a best-selling author I mean he's also known as one of the chief
[1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:50.440]  economist at the World Bank in 1995 he did a report of the intergovernmental
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:03:00.080]  panel and he won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize he was also part of a panel the
[1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:04.600]  Nobel Prize in economics for his analysis of markets with asymmetric
[1:03:04.600 --> 1:03:10.440]  information so he'll be with us for the next 30 minutes in fact let's go ahead
[1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:15.240]  and just introduce him now we're about to go to break in one moment but but but
[1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:20.240]  my sir a lot has happened since you were last on with us six months ago yeah I'll
[1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:25.120]  say it was a little bit predictable though and in fact I probably if you
[1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:29.600]  asked me I would have said that I did not think the turmoil was over and that
[1:03:29.600 --> 1:03:35.600]  I I think it's going to go on for it for for another year a year and a half two
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:40.440]  years the economics slow down well we did ask you that and you did say two to
[1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:44.400]  three years going from memory and that it would deepen did you think it would
[1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:51.720]  deepen this fast you can't predict exactly when these kinds of events
[1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:56.760]  happen yet yes I actually did think it would be happening around roughly
[1:03:56.760 --> 1:04:02.240]  around now and basically what's been happening is the cumulative effects
[1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:09.680]  house prices have continued to fall that means more default that means more
[1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:17.320]  more financial institutions are in deep problems you know you can papers things
[1:04:17.320 --> 1:04:22.040]  over for a while but eventually you have to face reality stay there sir we're
[1:04:22.040 --> 1:04:26.040]  going to skip this break for the info wars dot com and prison planet TV viewers
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:30.600]  with Joseph Stiglitz for everybody else we ride back okay mr. Stiglitz let's
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:36.280]  continue I was just breaking there for some stations that left us and and let's
[1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:40.960]  make sure and talk about your new book also before you leave us today because
[1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:47.680]  that ties into all of this why were you five six seven years ago talking about
[1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:51.400]  and I remember first interviewing you about six years ago you were bringing
[1:04:51.400 --> 1:04:56.600]  up the fact that there was no accountability that they were leveraging
[1:04:56.600 --> 1:05:01.920]  these asset-backed securities these debt-backed securities remember four
[1:05:01.920 --> 1:05:05.800]  years ago you came on the show you were talking about problems with mortgages in
[1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:09.120]  the real estate bubble in the United States I mean why were you talking about
[1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:14.320]  this years and years before anybody else was really talking about it well the
[1:05:14.320 --> 1:05:19.880]  problem is that much of the news much of the views on what's going on in the
[1:05:19.880 --> 1:05:25.120]  financial markets comes from those who are making money out of the financial
[1:05:25.120 --> 1:05:31.720]  markets so if you were you know one of the people in in layman brothers one of
[1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:35.200]  the people in AIG you're going to be talking up the economy you're going to
[1:05:35.200 --> 1:05:41.480]  say how wonderful thing is go by my shares and in fact the head of layman
[1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:47.080]  brothers last April was quoted as saying you know we've turned the corner the
[1:05:47.080 --> 1:05:52.600]  economy is you know it is on the uptick and the same thing goes for the
[1:05:52.600 --> 1:05:58.760]  president and the secretary of treasury they've been saying that they not only
[1:05:58.760 --> 1:06:02.400]  they've been telling the American people they've been going around the world I
[1:06:02.400 --> 1:06:08.160]  talked to senior government officials the and all over the world and they said
[1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:13.280]  you know we just had a private meeting with the secretary treasury and he
[1:06:13.280 --> 1:06:18.120]  said you've turned the corner and I said don't you believe it the fact is
[1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:25.280]  that they're they're involved in salesmanship as an academic you know
[1:06:25.280 --> 1:06:30.600]  I'm trying to figure out what is really going on and unfortunately what I saw
[1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:37.560]  were really going on was not very good in layman's terms for the average folks
[1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:41.760]  out there and for myself what is going on what did you see that was happening
[1:06:41.760 --> 1:06:46.920]  that that really raised red flags for you well there were several things let
[1:06:46.920 --> 1:06:50.640]  me just pick up one that's related to my book that's just coming out on the
[1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:57.400]  three trillion dollar war there were something very peculiar things about the
[1:06:57.400 --> 1:07:01.560]  financing of this war and the relationship between the war and the
[1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:03.400]  economy
[1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:08.640]  this is the first war in america history that has been totally put in from the
[1:07:08.640 --> 1:07:09.800]  credit card
[1:07:09.800 --> 1:07:14.320]  uh... that even as we went into the war we had a big deficit and yet the
[1:07:14.320 --> 1:07:16.760]  president asked for a tax cut
[1:07:16.760 --> 1:07:20.360]  for upper-income america it's also the first preemptive war just where they've
[1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:25.520]  done nothing and we go in that's right it's clearly out was a war of choice
[1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:28.320]  they were going to join some stations i want you to start back over about a
[1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:30.600]  minute ago and and and and go over your new book
[1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:32.960]  the three trillion dollar war here we go
[1:07:32.960 --> 1:07:37.760]  on the gc n radio network
[1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:43.360]  we're speaking with joseph sticklets he is a nobel prize winner
[1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:45.080]  fact he's been involved in
[1:07:45.080 --> 1:07:46.840]  several nobel prizes
[1:07:46.840 --> 1:07:48.560]  here if i read his bio correctly
[1:07:48.560 --> 1:07:51.440]  and when he's been kind enough to come on the show
[1:07:51.440 --> 1:07:56.760]  this is probably i don't six or seven visit of the last seven years or so and
[1:07:56.760 --> 1:07:59.000]  we bring you the economist
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.800]  uh... who have been right we don't bring you the economist who's been wrong at
[1:08:02.800 --> 1:08:04.200]  the ones they like to put on
[1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:07.040]  tv all the time though you're on television sometimes but it's about
[1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:09.120]  ninety percent as info in my opinion
[1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:12.160]  uh... you were uh... getting into the red flags
[1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:15.360]  you saw years ago and then going into this war
[1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:17.360]  and why you've been reading the alarm bells
[1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:20.840]  uh... about uh... really serious financial
[1:08:20.840 --> 1:08:22.840]  uh... problem so please continue
[1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:26.280]  well what i was saying is that that there are several things both about the
[1:08:26.280 --> 1:08:28.760]  war in the way that it was finance that
[1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:32.200]  should have been uh... uh... a cause of concern
[1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:34.040]  uh... this is the first
[1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:36.200]  but this was a war of choice this is uh...
[1:08:36.200 --> 1:08:38.880]  a preemptive or this is a war that
[1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:41.440]  though that as we went to war we had a
[1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:44.680]  huge deficit and yet the president as part tax cut
[1:08:44.680 --> 1:08:46.560]  usually when you go to war you ask
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:48.880]  your young men and women to go
[1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:52.920]  risk their lives and then there's a things that share sacrifice
[1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:57.360]  the only sacrifice the president asked was a few people on the shopping mall
[1:08:57.360 --> 1:09:03.200]  uh... the uh... and there was actually a tax cut cut for upper income americans
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:03.960]  well
[1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:06.960]  uh... the piling up of
[1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:09.000]  has meant meant that
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:12.480]  should a problem occur in the problem has now occurred
[1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:16.320]  there would be less room for maneuver we wouldn't be able to do anything
[1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:21.760]  uh... when we had a uh... an economic downturn back in two thousand one
[1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:27.280]  we had uh... a surplus of two thought of two percent of gdp that gave it a lot of
[1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:32.640]  of ammunition to use to uh... try to remedy the problem now
[1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:37.120]  uh... this year next year we're expected to have the largest deficit in
[1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:42.320]  america's history in one year hitting a half a trillion dollars
[1:09:42.320 --> 1:09:44.880]  uh... that's one problem the second problem
[1:09:44.880 --> 1:09:47.800]  with that and uh... the war
[1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:50.960]  is in my judgment uh...
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:54.400]  largely responsible for the increase in the price of oil was back
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:09:58.320]  back in two thousand three was twenty three twenty five dollars a barrel
[1:09:58.320 --> 1:10:02.240]  uh... futures markets uh... understood that there was going to be increases in
[1:10:02.240 --> 1:10:06.720]  demand from china from other places but they believe that there will be a
[1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:08.800]  concomitant increase in
[1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:12.880]  uh... supply from the middle east the war changed that equation and now we have
[1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:14.320]  uh...
[1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:15.120]  oil
[1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:18.640]  hundred dollars gallon now normally
[1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:24.400]  if a country is spending so much more money abroad as we were importing oil
[1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:25.920]  from q way from
[1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:27.840]  sorry rebert from other countries
[1:10:27.840 --> 1:10:30.480]  it's going to weaken the economy
[1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:32.720]  but it didn't seem to be happening
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:33.600]  and why
[1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:37.200]  well some people said there was uh... new laws of economics whenever anybody
[1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:39.760]  says that to me i start getting suspicious
[1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:41.680]  uh... what was going on with
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:43.880]  very simple
[1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:45.780]  the fed decided to let
[1:10:45.780 --> 1:10:46.880]  warthog
[1:10:46.880 --> 1:10:51.480]  lot of liquidity lax regulation we got a housing bubble
[1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:55.560]  the housing bubble led to a consumption boom savings united states went down to
[1:10:55.560 --> 1:10:57.720]  zero
[1:10:57.720 --> 1:11:02.320]  sustained economy for a while but we were living on borrowed money and borrowed
[1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:05.080]  time it was just a matter of time before something happened
[1:11:05.080 --> 1:11:08.200]  and so when i looked at what was going on with uh...
[1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:13.360]  how the economy continued in spite of the high oil prices in spite of the war
[1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:17.520]  it was clear to me and i thought the the housing bubble
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:20.920]  and i thought what was happening to to savings rate
[1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:24.920]  it was uh... you didn't have to be a genius to say that there were problems
[1:11:24.920 --> 1:11:28.240]  around the corner in fact i saw that number in january of two thousand and
[1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:30.520]  seven that that was the highest
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:34.520]  uh... debt ratio for the average american and lack of savings rate
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:36.240]  uh... you know both
[1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:40.320]  since the depths of the great depression in fact it was it was worse
[1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:44.240]  than late nineteen thirty three that's right i mean it it it
[1:11:44.240 --> 1:11:47.480]  and that by itself should have been uh... assigned
[1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:50.440]  uh... of a problem but there were even other signs
[1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:54.400]  uh... you know housing prices were getting higher and higher as part of
[1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:56.040]  this bubble
[1:11:56.040 --> 1:11:57.440]  uh... but
[1:11:57.440 --> 1:11:59.200]  most americans income
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:00.440]  we're stagnating
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:04.760]  in fact meeting income adjusted for inflation was declining
[1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:08.440]  and again you don't have to be a genius to say look at americans can't spend
[1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:11.880]  more and more their incomes are going down at more and more housing
[1:12:11.880 --> 1:12:14.160]  if their incomes are going down and down
[1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:15.760]  this was the pyramid
[1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:19.840]  this was uh... uh... uh... uh... this with this uh... this was a house of
[1:12:19.840 --> 1:12:20.880]  cards
[1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:26.280]  and uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... the the banks in spite of the fact that the
[1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:30.040]  housing prices were getting so out of line
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:31.280]  increase
[1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:32.520]  the fraction
[1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:36.360]  uh... of the value of the house that they were willing to lend against and
[1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:39.480]  they were actually having loans that where you didn't even have to pay to
[1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:43.160]  interest on the loan
[1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:46.200]  just incredible
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:48.120]  expanding from there
[1:12:48.120 --> 1:12:51.160]  uh... where do you see this going
[1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:53.000]  where i mean how do you see
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:57.120]  uh... the government the treasury of the private federal reserve
[1:12:57.120 --> 1:12:58.960]  you know this whole international order
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:03.040]  dealing with this because i've seen is financial times of london article saying
[1:13:03.040 --> 1:13:04.720]  look other other
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:09.640]  uh... contractions other uh... speculation bubble
[1:13:09.640 --> 1:13:11.280]  uh... implosions
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:14.480]  have been manageable and have you been some opportunities
[1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:17.640]  for people that weren't in debt and and and people that did save both the local
[1:13:17.640 --> 1:13:19.240]  level of the international level
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:23.240]  you know it didn't matter where you were geopolitically now
[1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:24.200]  now
[1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:27.040]  uh... they're talking about this being a financial black hole that if it
[1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:28.080]  continues
[1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:30.720]  might even make the treasury become
[1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:36.160]  insolvent i mean but they're clearly this is clearly uh...
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:40.720]  the most serious problems since the great depression and in some ways uh...
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:42.200]  uh... worse
[1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:46.360]  uh... in terms of the uh... the financial institutions the reason
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:49.040]  in part is that that while
[1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:51.720]  some of the same problems that have
[1:13:51.720 --> 1:13:54.760]  uh... occurred that have occurred since then
[1:13:54.760 --> 1:13:58.120]  excessive leverage pyramid schemes bubbles
[1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:00.480]  have happened before
[1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:05.480]  the so-called innovation of wall Street the financial innovations
[1:14:05.480 --> 1:14:09.840]  created it was supposed to manage risk to create a risk
[1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:14.200]  and created a kind of non-transparency
[1:14:14.200 --> 1:14:18.960]  uh... that is so great that no one knows exactly
[1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:22.800]  uh... what the magnitude what what the nature of the risk they pay in fact
[1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:25.720]  that's now coming out where these companies say we can't show you your
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:27.320]  books we don't even really
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:31.400]  really have them i mean it's just well you know the companies are saying they
[1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:33.200]  can't extrapolate
[1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:36.840]  uh... how these algorithms are even working what these computer systems are
[1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:37.600]  doing
[1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:42.800]  who owns what debt how it was leveraged exactly and that's why no one trust
[1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:44.200]  anybody else
[1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:48.400]  you can't uh... you go who wants to buy women brothers when you don't know what
[1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:51.880]  it's a liability well that's my question because you won one of your two
[1:14:51.880 --> 1:14:53.520]  noble prizes for coming up
[1:14:53.520 --> 1:14:55.720]  with these asymmetrical models or or
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:14:57.880]  looking at certain strata something they hadn't
[1:14:57.880 --> 1:15:01.640]  done so something you're an expert on this exactly and and you know what i
[1:15:01.640 --> 1:15:05.480]  cautioned about i wrote about these these problems of
[1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:06.600]  asymmetric
[1:15:06.600 --> 1:15:08.360]  information fact that
[1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:10.640]  some people know things that others don't know
[1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:13.680]  but this is a in some ways uh... uh...
[1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:15.360]  double problem because
[1:15:15.360 --> 1:15:20.360]  not only do others not know who say what layman brothers
[1:15:20.360 --> 1:15:24.200]  may know layman brothers doesn't know what it ought to know what which makes it
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:28.160]  even harder to say if you have a fire no one has a full blueprint of even the
[1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:28.760]  building
[1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:29.920]  exactly
[1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:34.120]  so that's where we are in in this uh... in this crisis uh... and that of
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:37.640]  course means that no one's willing to lend to anybody else and that of course
[1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:42.760]  uh... restricts credit so we have a crisis of trust not the not just with the
[1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:46.760]  public in the banks but with the institutions themselves which sounds
[1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:48.840]  like that
[1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:52.480]  just about as bad a scenario that it's it's particularly bad because you know
[1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:56.560]  our financial institutions are based on trust i mean you put your money in the
[1:15:56.560 --> 1:15:57.280]  bank
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:00.240]  and you trust that you can get your money out
[1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:03.400]  if you didn't trust that you would never put your money in the bank so trust is
[1:16:03.400 --> 1:16:06.680]  absolutely essential for the functioning of our financial markets
[1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:08.400]  functioning of our economy
[1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:12.360]  and then there's another level of trust you know outsiders uh... say
[1:16:12.360 --> 1:16:14.680]  uh... those in other countries uh...
[1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:18.280]  have to have trust that the american economy is working well they have to
[1:16:18.280 --> 1:16:22.560]  trust that when the president says the everything is going well
[1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:24.280]  it is
[1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:25.200]  uh...
[1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:29.120]  this administration has really burned that trust
[1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:33.080]  you know the president said all there is no problem just a few too many houses
[1:16:33.080 --> 1:16:34.080]  been built
[1:16:34.080 --> 1:16:38.680]  well if back the level of analysis that uh... the leader of the united states is
[1:16:38.680 --> 1:16:41.800]  giving about what back in nature of economic problems
[1:16:41.800 --> 1:16:45.280]  no wonder everybody around the world is losing uh... a certain amount of
[1:16:45.280 --> 1:16:48.760]  well in fact in the past of a president said all is good the market would go up
[1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:50.360]  now with mccain
[1:16:50.360 --> 1:16:53.400]  or even obama or even bush anyone seen as a leader
[1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:56.760]  says you know we're gonna make it out of this it's okay markets go down
[1:16:56.760 --> 1:16:58.800]  which shows almost a terminal
[1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:02.280]  uh... loss of trust now now now going back to this asymmetric data
[1:17:02.280 --> 1:17:05.800]  where where uh... you know people can't see around the tree to the other side to
[1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:07.560]  see what's on the other side of it
[1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:11.120]  uh... i mean projecting forward which which you've really been good at
[1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:14.120]  uh... where do you see this going how do you see this on the good side
[1:17:14.120 --> 1:17:15.040]  unfolding
[1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:17.600]  versus on the bad side unfolding
[1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:20.800]  well there's always uh... some uncertainty about what the government is
[1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:25.800]  going to do and and uh... uh... i have to say that that the the
[1:17:25.800 --> 1:17:27.600]  uncertainty has increased
[1:17:27.600 --> 1:17:33.240]  uh... because uh... there's clearly now an additional element of uncertainty
[1:17:33.240 --> 1:17:36.600]  with the government saying we're going to pick winners were going to fight
[1:17:36.600 --> 1:17:40.520]  uh... who we bail out and who not and so if you have your money
[1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:43.320]  and uh... the wrong
[1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:45.600]  firm you won't get bailed out
[1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:50.080]  uh... uh... boy is that scary to to people outside uh... because they're
[1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:52.680]  now making not only an economic
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:55.320]  that they're making a political bad on who
[1:17:55.320 --> 1:17:59.200]  who's friends of the bush administration of the fed and who
[1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:02.800]  what their judgment about whether there's systemic risk let me ask you who
[1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:06.360]  are those friends of the chase manhattan city bank bank of america
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:11.120]  well we don't really know uh... what we do know for instance you know uh...
[1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:15.840]  question why was it that we bailed out fanny may and freddy mack
[1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:20.440]  uh... one story that when it here is that uh... there were a lot of investors
[1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:22.320]  uh... abroad uh...
[1:18:22.320 --> 1:18:25.740]  some with close connections with uh... one of the firms that
[1:18:25.740 --> 1:18:28.640]  secretary treasury will was at the four
[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:32.800]  and uh... so they're you know the rumors uh... that that that may have played an
[1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:34.120]  important role
[1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:39.120]  in the decision to bail out fanny may saw these in the chinese right exactly
[1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:43.920]  so uh... the question is you know is this being done for the american
[1:18:43.920 --> 1:18:45.040]  economy
[1:18:45.040 --> 1:18:48.280]  but uh... you know how would american taxpayers feel that
[1:18:48.280 --> 1:18:52.160]  is uh... the reason they they they put
[1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:54.680]  billions of billions of their money at risk was
[1:18:54.680 --> 1:18:57.120]  was to help some people that would uh...
[1:18:57.120 --> 1:19:01.440]  uh... in other countries not not to help with american economy well of course
[1:19:01.440 --> 1:19:03.480]  they're always going to say
[1:19:03.480 --> 1:19:08.000]  uh... if we lose the confidence in american economy uh... where will we
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:11.080]  be you but we've lost that confidence
[1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:14.000]  joseph stichlitz because we only got you another ten minutes on the skip this
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:16.360]  break and the final break we're gonna ride up
[1:19:16.360 --> 1:19:18.000]  about thirty two after with you
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:21.280]  uh... so we will continue uh... some stations will not
[1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:23.280]  carry this but others will and
[1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:27.120]  you go to info wars dot com pick it up as well here we go with joseph stichlitz
[1:19:27.120 --> 1:19:28.020]  two-time
[1:19:28.020 --> 1:19:29.080]  double prize winner
[1:19:29.080 --> 1:19:30.800]  now
[1:19:30.800 --> 1:19:33.880]  okay uh... yeah this is so important i want to continue
[1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:35.560]  uh... now now i
[1:19:35.560 --> 1:19:39.240]  don't consider myself technical or to you know be some economic whiskey but i
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:40.480]  do read what you write
[1:19:40.480 --> 1:19:43.960]  i do read what all you know hundreds of others say because this is so important
[1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:44.840]  obviously
[1:19:44.840 --> 1:19:49.120]  uh... but but but let's go down from the level of knowledge say i have
[1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:52.600]  uh... you know uh... or you know somebody who somewhat informed
[1:19:52.600 --> 1:19:56.800]  down to just very simple i understand people listen to you see gotta be
[1:19:56.800 --> 1:20:00.400]  very technical explain out why you're saying what you're saying but but just
[1:20:00.400 --> 1:20:01.720]  in layman's terms
[1:20:01.720 --> 1:20:05.400]  i was asking what's the good side what's the bad side i mean what do you
[1:20:05.400 --> 1:20:08.680]  uh... you know from past research from from from seeing what's going on now i
[1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:12.120]  know so much this is secret that you're saying you know i can't see through a
[1:20:12.120 --> 1:20:15.720]  brick wall but but but i mean your best dead reckoning
[1:20:15.720 --> 1:20:18.840]  where do you see us in twelve months eighteen months
[1:20:18.840 --> 1:20:23.600]  uh... i think uh... in in certainly over the next twelve months uh...
[1:20:23.600 --> 1:20:29.200]  the basic pattern of that we've seen for the last twelve months continuing
[1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:32.120]  uh... house prices will continue to fall
[1:20:32.120 --> 1:20:36.440]  more mortgages will uh... go into foreclosure
[1:20:36.440 --> 1:20:38.840]  the value of more more uh...
[1:20:38.840 --> 1:20:41.560]  houses will be less than the mortgages
[1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:43.360]  uh...
[1:20:43.360 --> 1:20:46.920]  more uh... firms will face
[1:20:46.920 --> 1:20:51.280]  uh... more more financial firms will be uh... put in the crisis to make funds
[1:20:51.280 --> 1:20:54.880]  will how deep i mean we're now here and i'm not saying a hundred banks but a
[1:20:54.880 --> 1:20:59.040]  thousand banks you know in cnbc i mean
[1:20:59.040 --> 1:21:02.280]  it's hard to predict
[1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:05.920]  as i say it because because there's such down transparency in what's been going
[1:21:05.920 --> 1:21:10.040]  on but i i i don't think it's uh...
[1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:14.240]  uh... i i i i i just very hard to know it could be
[1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:18.640]  uh... certainly in the dozens of bank do you think it's more rotten
[1:21:18.640 --> 1:21:22.000]  though than you previously thought as we kick in more doors and see what's
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:26.520]  behind you know uh... uh... deeper levels it is a little bit more rotten
[1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:30.440]  and then i had uh... uh... then i had originally thought uh...
[1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:32.080]  uh... but you know
[1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:36.000]  uh... one aspect of of what has been going on
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  is uh... everybody realized that
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:43.400]  their work what they called clueless of dollars and open positions where people
[1:21:43.400 --> 1:21:45.640]  were betting against other people
[1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:50.200]  he had to ask the question what were they doing who were they betting against
[1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:53.680]  they said that they were trying to manage risk but what risk for the trying to
[1:21:53.680 --> 1:21:54.840]  manage
[1:21:54.840 --> 1:21:57.720]  and uh...
[1:21:57.720 --> 1:21:59.240]  why do some people think
[1:21:59.240 --> 1:22:02.560]  but they were smarter than other people that they knew that the exchange rate was
[1:22:02.560 --> 1:22:05.640]  going to go up exchange rate was going to go down interest rates go up or
[1:22:05.640 --> 1:22:07.320]  interest rate goes to down
[1:22:07.320 --> 1:22:11.560]  but what you know is when you have a lot of people making
[1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:14.000]  big
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.760]  and you have a lot about a little in the economy
[1:22:16.760 --> 1:22:17.880]  there could be some
[1:22:17.880 --> 1:22:20.640]  big winners and they're going to be some big loser and there's also you can
[1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:23.120]  follow back with the consistent winners aren't find out
[1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:25.480]  who's getting illegal inside information
[1:22:25.480 --> 1:22:29.240]  and that may be playing a role of some of the so you can't you there's no
[1:22:29.240 --> 1:22:31.200]  inside information about where
[1:22:31.200 --> 1:22:35.000]  with exchange rate is going to go there may be some inside information about
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:39.520]  bailouts and things like that that that is clear or commodities uh... park
[1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:42.520]  but so to the point i want to make though is that
[1:22:42.520 --> 1:22:45.560]  given the level of volatility they're going to be uh... more
[1:22:45.560 --> 1:22:48.480]  firms that go that more of a financial institution
[1:22:48.480 --> 1:22:51.920]  that are going to be in uh... deep trouble and given the lack of
[1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:55.440]  transparency there's going to be hard to get liquidity
[1:22:55.440 --> 1:22:57.280]  and so i think we can
[1:22:57.280 --> 1:22:59.840]  the uh... more problems they had
[1:22:59.840 --> 1:23:04.280]  what i am particularly worried about what i call the real economy
[1:23:04.280 --> 1:23:07.680]  that's what i wanted to bring up when we come back to the full audience i want
[1:23:07.680 --> 1:23:08.560]  to plug your book
[1:23:08.560 --> 1:23:10.840]  here in the five minutes we have left about it
[1:23:10.840 --> 1:23:12.280]  at half our audience here i just
[1:23:12.280 --> 1:23:15.120]  skip the brakes because some stations and and the internet
[1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:17.560]  uh... certainly likes that but that was my next question
[1:23:17.560 --> 1:23:20.280]  was we can talk all day about these big financial institutions
[1:23:20.280 --> 1:23:22.960]  the real economy does not look good to me
[1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:25.360]  and i'm in the supposedly best city in the u.s
[1:23:25.360 --> 1:23:26.480]  austin texas
[1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:29.640]  there's restaurants closing houses for foreclosure
[1:23:29.640 --> 1:23:35.160]  uh... the share of south graven people's houses here we go
[1:23:35.160 --> 1:23:36.720]  well he's a two-time
[1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:40.680]  nobel prize winner is one one for economics and for peace
[1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:43.400]  and uh... you don't usually went to visa
[1:23:43.400 --> 1:23:46.080]  shows of sticklets is new book is coming out
[1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:48.560]  the three trillion dollar war
[1:23:48.560 --> 1:23:51.000]  the true cost of the iraq conflict and i want to spend a few minutes on that
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:52.600]  before he leaves us
[1:23:52.600 --> 1:23:56.360]  uh... but uh... he he he brought up just now for those listening and for work
[1:23:56.360 --> 1:23:57.960]  dot com not on the mnfm
[1:23:57.960 --> 1:24:00.800]  he just brought up my next question he said i want to talk about the cost on
[1:24:00.800 --> 1:24:02.800]  the real economy and that was my next question
[1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:05.960]  uh... i'm in supposedly of this great city of austin for the economy compared
[1:24:05.960 --> 1:24:06.760]  the rest of country
[1:24:06.760 --> 1:24:08.440]  foreclosures everywhere
[1:24:08.440 --> 1:24:11.160]  my dad yesterday driving around saw sheriffs
[1:24:11.160 --> 1:24:15.360]  outside three houses pulling people out you're a repossessing enforceably
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:18.640]  uh... restaurants i've gone to two years i pull into one it's closed i pull
[1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:20.000]  into another it's closed
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:21.920]  uh... stuff shutting down
[1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:25.560]  i mean the real economy is just getting worse and worse meanwhile
[1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:28.520]  bush is going around you know when gas was four bucks a gallon saying no it's
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:31.960]  not and then there's just this let them eat cake even from the democrats in
[1:24:31.960 --> 1:24:33.000]  congress
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:36.280]  that's right uh... and and it's going to get worse i mean basically when the
[1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:39.120]  financial system starts getting weak
[1:24:39.120 --> 1:24:43.320]  uh... it it isn't a position to provide credit to provide loans
[1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:48.320]  uh... to provide mortgages and and that means in turn that housing prices are
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:50.240]  going to fall fall further
[1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:52.040]  businesses are going to contract
[1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:55.760]  uh... unemployment is going to grow and it's a downward vicious
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:57.360]  uh... cycle snowball
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:25:01.200]  it's a snowball and that and that's where we are uh... we eventually will
[1:25:01.200 --> 1:25:04.280]  emerge from it we've worked merge from every other downturn
[1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:08.920]  uh... so i don't want to be excessively pessimistic but uh...
[1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:12.360]  you have to be in fantasy land to say everything is fine
[1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:17.160]  uh... that and and even to say that we are have turned the corner i think we
[1:25:17.160 --> 1:25:18.520]  are we are in
[1:25:18.520 --> 1:25:22.640]  uh... still in the downward phase of uh... this
[1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:26.800]  uh... economic cycle we're going into a deepening storm uh... how much longer
[1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:32.200]  did uh... does your uh... expertise i i would say that we can't we should not
[1:25:32.200 --> 1:25:34.160]  anticipate emerging from this for
[1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:36.440]  a year and a half or longer
[1:25:36.440 --> 1:25:41.160]  uh... so so this is going to be uh... uh... but this is
[1:25:41.160 --> 1:25:44.800]  is a different kind of economic downturn from most of those that we've had in
[1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:47.720]  the last seventy five years most of those are quick we call it
[1:25:47.720 --> 1:25:49.520]  inventory cycles uh...
[1:25:49.520 --> 1:25:52.880]  businesses accumulate to look at too much in the generated from the bottom this
[1:25:52.880 --> 1:25:54.600]  crisis generated from the top
[1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:55.880]  exactly and it
[1:25:55.880 --> 1:26:00.920]  it's systemic it's uh... not just a little excess investment a little bit
[1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:04.880]  uh... hi to our interest rates it's it's basically
[1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:08.480]  basic institutions of our economy the financial institutions
[1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:13.200]  and uh... it's going to be hard to get a little uh... uh...
[1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:16.280]  difficult road getting out and it's particularly difficult
[1:26:16.280 --> 1:26:19.200]  because for the last five years especially
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:23.280]  uh... you know as the war is uh... is uh... going on
[1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:25.840]  we've been a debt economy
[1:26:25.840 --> 1:26:29.800]  uh... go back into that uh... because i interrupted you with a break earlier
[1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:32.520]  about your you know your book the fact you're laying out the three trillion
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:33.520]  dollar war
[1:26:33.520 --> 1:26:35.160]  uh... folks need to get it and read it
[1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:39.080]  uh... i mean what we're dealing with your wall why so many fundamentals have
[1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:40.080]  been changed
[1:26:40.080 --> 1:26:44.120]  uh... that's right i mean uh... they make this is the first word that that
[1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:47.200]  uh... we have put totally on the credit card in fact it's the first
[1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:50.120]  worsening the revolutionary work that we had to turn to
[1:26:50.120 --> 1:26:51.240]  foreigners
[1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:52.320]  to finance
[1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:56.120]  because of forty percent of our national debt is now being fined by
[1:26:56.120 --> 1:26:57.080]  foreigners
[1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:00.080]  uh... we had to borrow eight hundred fifty billion dollars
[1:27:00.080 --> 1:27:03.800]  uh... in in recent years uh... per year
[1:27:03.800 --> 1:27:04.880]  uh... from
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:08.360]  for uh... from foreigners to uh... here we have the richest country in the
[1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:10.640]  world that can't live within its means
[1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:14.560]  uh... households and then borrowing uh... and an unprecedented level we
[1:27:14.560 --> 1:27:18.920]  mentioned before that that national savings rate uh... uh... uh... the
[1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:23.040]  household savings rate with the lowest in six minutes of the great depression
[1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:27.880]  uh... and uh... the federal government has been piling up debt because it did
[1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:28.800]  it
[1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:32.920]  uh... been borrowing at every not only to finance the war
[1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:35.640]  but to finance it's other operations
[1:27:35.640 --> 1:27:38.400]  so with all that
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:42.400]  and at the same time the financial institutions which manage
[1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:43.360]  the debt
[1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:45.000]  going
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:46.480]  but having such trouble
[1:27:46.480 --> 1:27:50.400]  we are in trouble as an economy and you're saying the biggest financial
[1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:52.400]  threat since the great depression maybe
[1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:53.360]  even bigger
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:57.440]  uh... is there some internal bank warfare going on people using
[1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:00.640]  uh... the lack of confidence uh... using connections
[1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:03.560]  to go and basically sabotage and overtake
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:05.880]  the case of Bear Stearns on a two dollars
[1:28:05.880 --> 1:28:08.560]  uh... which clearly that was an overreaction of my humble opinion and
[1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:10.720]  then going and taking that over minutes any of this
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:13.160]  also market forces inside
[1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:16.600]  uh... wall street uh... using this to their advantage
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:20.880]  part of the problem is as i said before that there is
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:22.920]  lack of transparency
[1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:24.880]  that uh...
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:26.040]  it does give
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:29.040]  anybody from who has something for that information
[1:28:29.040 --> 1:28:30.960]  a big advantage over others
[1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:34.160]  but you mentioned that you thought two dollars uh...
[1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:38.920]  may have been uh... too low for Bear Stearns but the fact of the matter is
[1:28:38.920 --> 1:28:40.520]  we the taxpayers
[1:28:40.520 --> 1:28:41.280]  do not
[1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:44.480]  no yet month after the bailout
[1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:46.520]  how much we are at risk
[1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:49.160]  for that bailout that's another point is
[1:28:49.160 --> 1:28:52.000]  we don't know what we're signing on to we know it's trillions
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.240]  all together but but i mean uh... so it's a
[1:28:54.240 --> 1:28:55.360]  it's a time bomb
[1:28:55.360 --> 1:28:58.680]  uh... what we just got about two minutes left with joseph stickles for folks
[1:28:58.680 --> 1:28:59.880]  listening exclusively
[1:28:59.880 --> 1:29:02.320]  at info wars dot com and some of the stations that
[1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:05.600]  uh... carry it and then he'll be uh... hopefully back with us in the future
[1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:07.960]  as things unfold because he's one of the
[1:29:07.960 --> 1:29:10.920]  most important guests on the subject we could hope to have a very
[1:29:10.920 --> 1:29:13.880]  thankful to have him the new book is
[1:29:13.880 --> 1:29:18.720]  the three trillion dollar war the true cost of the iraq conflict
[1:29:18.720 --> 1:29:21.920]  uh... mister sticklets i'm gonna let you go here in just about two minutes but i
[1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:23.480]  wanted
[1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:27.280]  to ask you about some solutions you know you put forward quite a few ideas to
[1:29:27.280 --> 1:29:31.080]  keep this from happening now that's a little late we're now into this happening
[1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:35.400]  i mean if you were the economic you know king for a day uh... if uh... you were
[1:29:35.400 --> 1:29:38.560]  both the fed chairman and the uh... treasury secretary which
[1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:41.040]  kind of paulson really is he's telling the stuff to do right now that's been
[1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:41.680]  reported
[1:29:41.680 --> 1:29:43.200]  uh... what would you do
[1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:47.400]  right now to stabilize this to to build confidence back in and to stop
[1:29:47.400 --> 1:29:48.840]  the implosion
[1:29:48.840 --> 1:29:49.840]  well uh...
[1:29:49.840 --> 1:29:53.920]  the first thing the economy needs i i go back to the real economy and it needs
[1:29:53.920 --> 1:29:55.120]  the stimulus
[1:29:55.120 --> 1:29:57.040]  uh... and uh...
[1:29:57.040 --> 1:30:00.320]  but it needs a stimulus that really works is that we have to
[1:30:00.320 --> 1:30:05.760]  uh... increase the locality uh... aid to state local uh... government who are
[1:30:05.760 --> 1:30:06.760]  facing a
[1:30:06.760 --> 1:30:10.600]  big shortfall of revenue to come back expenditures to back investment
[1:30:10.600 --> 1:30:15.480]  come back uh... basic uh... programs for for for americans
[1:30:15.480 --> 1:30:19.640]  uh... we need to strong or unemployment insurance uh... you know with with the
[1:30:19.640 --> 1:30:21.240]  unemployment growing
[1:30:21.240 --> 1:30:24.880]  uh... we need to have some confidence that that uh...
[1:30:24.880 --> 1:30:29.000]  uh... if you lose your job no fault of your own that you're going to be a bit
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:31.160]  better protected than we've been
[1:30:31.160 --> 1:30:31.920]  uh...
[1:30:31.920 --> 1:30:34.960]  we need uh...
[1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:38.920]  more investment in our infrastructure if you anybody visits
[1:30:38.920 --> 1:30:42.560]  uh... an airport in asia
[1:30:42.560 --> 1:30:45.280]  uh... europe you realize what state
[1:30:45.280 --> 1:30:49.720]  all our air our our our our our airports are in the uh...
[1:30:49.720 --> 1:30:53.800]  new Orleans levies the minnesota bridges are all emblematic
[1:30:53.800 --> 1:30:56.360]  of what has happened to our infrastructure
[1:30:56.360 --> 1:30:57.880]  so uh...
[1:30:57.880 --> 1:30:58.840]  i would
[1:30:58.840 --> 1:31:03.480]  take this admit advantage of this particular uh... time
[1:31:03.480 --> 1:31:08.960]  to try to stimulate the economy in ways to provide the basis of our longer term
[1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:10.680]  economic growth
[1:31:10.680 --> 1:31:16.040]  uh... if our economy is growing then we will be better able to manage some of
[1:31:16.040 --> 1:31:20.800]  the financial turmoil but if our economy is going as i believe it's going to go
[1:31:20.800 --> 1:31:23.960]  into a uh... uh... uh... downward uh...
[1:31:23.960 --> 1:31:25.200]  uh... mo
[1:31:25.200 --> 1:31:26.120]  direction
[1:31:26.120 --> 1:31:29.680]  uh... is going to be much more difficult to manage and the problem is
[1:31:29.680 --> 1:31:34.480]  uh... the president still talking about everything being fine in the economy
[1:31:34.480 --> 1:31:39.040]  well that's my final question uh...
[1:31:39.040 --> 1:31:41.400]  it doesn't appear that they're really planning to change any of the
[1:31:41.400 --> 1:31:43.440]  fundamentals that brought us to this point
[1:31:43.440 --> 1:31:46.440]  they continue to say full speed ahead armor to the fog
[1:31:46.440 --> 1:31:48.880]  uh... eighty agree with that statement that that's what they're doing and be
[1:31:48.880 --> 1:31:50.720]  what will that then lead to
[1:31:50.720 --> 1:31:55.240]  well i think it's clear that they've not uh... take into account uh...
[1:31:55.240 --> 1:31:57.560]  they didn't participate these problems
[1:31:57.560 --> 1:32:01.440]  and uh... they're not responding to the problems
[1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:06.520]  uh... partly because that the problems are of their own making and they want
[1:32:06.520 --> 1:32:10.120]  to hide their head in the senate and say oh everything is fine
[1:32:10.120 --> 1:32:11.880]  are uh... you know
[1:32:11.880 --> 1:32:14.440]  our recipe tax cuts for the rich
[1:32:14.440 --> 1:32:18.000]  deregulation let markets uh... run wild
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:23.040]  uh... is the recipe for a long-term economic growth and stability
[1:32:23.040 --> 1:32:24.640]  they've been proven
[1:32:24.640 --> 1:32:28.240]  very very wrong mister stiglitz we're gonna let you go about sixty seconds
[1:32:28.240 --> 1:32:31.000]  i want to come back to the full audience right now plug your personal
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:31.960]  website
[1:32:31.960 --> 1:32:33.960]  i forgot to do that here we go
[1:32:33.960 --> 1:32:35.840]  alex jones show
[1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:39.480]  because there's a war on for your mind
[1:32:39.480 --> 1:32:42.200]  well we've kept it a little bit longer than he originally was coming on out
[1:32:42.200 --> 1:32:45.880]  for a full hour in the near future left to do that
[1:32:45.880 --> 1:32:52.040]  uh... joseph stiglitz dot com s t i g l i t z but the great part about google
[1:32:52.040 --> 1:32:54.040]  so you misspelled joseph stiglitz
[1:32:54.040 --> 1:32:56.840]  you'll still get his website so joseph stiglitz
[1:32:56.840 --> 1:32:58.920]  dot com and he's written quite a few
[1:32:58.920 --> 1:33:02.000]  by selling books and the new one's just been out for a few months
[1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:04.800]  of the most recent book the three trillion dollar war the true cost of the
[1:33:04.800 --> 1:33:08.600]  iraq conflict paperback just came out uh... it with a new afterward trying to
[1:33:08.600 --> 1:33:10.600]  keep us uh... bring us up to date

[1:33:14.280 --> 1:33:15.160]  what happened
[1:33:15.160 --> 1:33:16.480]  uh... since the last
[1:33:16.480 --> 1:33:18.480]  the bird edition came out
[1:33:18.480 --> 1:33:21.760]  well we appreciate all your time anything that i didn't bring up anything
[1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:23.680]  you know we have good discussion
[1:33:23.680 --> 1:33:25.880]  thank you mister stiglitz take care
[1:33:25.880 --> 1:33:28.120]  there he goes ladies and gentlemen joseph
[1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:32.320]  stiglitz uh... joining us
[1:33:32.320 --> 1:33:35.240]  look i mean i can have the head of the new york business school on by the way
[1:33:35.240 --> 1:33:37.480]  we're gonna set him back up to the show
[1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:42.120]  uh... we can have any of these people
[1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:46.920]  we can bring them here and tell you this and you heard stiglitz
[1:33:46.920 --> 1:33:50.120]  worse than the great depression is what we're facing
[1:33:50.120 --> 1:33:57.120]  and then you look at the on the ground uh... situation
[1:33:57.120 --> 1:34:01.360]  i keep repeating this because ninety percent of the american people
[1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:05.920]  live in urban areas that means in cities and built up suburbs
[1:34:05.920 --> 1:34:10.040]  of the ten percent that live in what you can call rural areas the last census
[1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:11.440]  ten percent
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:13.120]  about half of them
[1:34:13.120 --> 1:34:14.880]  or five percent
[1:34:14.880 --> 1:34:17.360]  of the public are somewhat
[1:34:17.360 --> 1:34:21.840]  self-sufficient in most of them say they're self-sufficient when asked
[1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:23.640]  in the wider survey
[1:34:23.640 --> 1:34:27.040]  they have a farming supplement that was part of the
[1:34:27.040 --> 1:34:30.360]  larger census of a business census will be all talked about on constitutional
[1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:31.640]  that is side issue
[1:34:31.640 --> 1:34:37.520]  point is we have those numbers show five percent claim of their self-sufficient
[1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:38.840]  five percent now
[1:34:38.840 --> 1:34:42.680]  do you know what percentage were truly self-sufficient
[1:34:42.680 --> 1:34:45.880]  going into the great depression
[1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:46.920]  eighty percent
[1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:47.880]  or a little more
[1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:51.720]  the problem is is they were not economically self-sufficient
[1:34:51.720 --> 1:34:53.800]  they had mortgages on their farms
[1:34:53.800 --> 1:34:57.200]  and so they were driven off their farms at shotgun point
[1:34:57.200 --> 1:34:58.760]  at police gunpoint
[1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:01.160]  and i don't want to be enemies with the police here
[1:35:01.160 --> 1:35:03.480]  the point is the police are going to be used
[1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:06.320]  to take your farms your answers here and i mean
[1:35:06.320 --> 1:35:09.760]  these are going to be your families and neighbors is where you get your food cops
[1:35:09.760 --> 1:35:13.000]  they won't care the feds are going to ship a man on the backs of trucks food
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:14.320]  you know if it gets this bad
[1:35:14.320 --> 1:35:17.880]  and the cops will literally be taking your land and your property
[1:35:17.880 --> 1:35:19.520]  uh... for the banks
[1:35:19.520 --> 1:35:21.760]  that is ready
[1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:23.160]  they will literally
[1:35:23.160 --> 1:35:26.400]  be doing all of this just to get their food
[1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:27.760]  you enter and remember
[1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:30.080]  none of this had to happen you just heard the former
[1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:32.000]  had it at the treasury policy
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:36.400]  uh... for you know the chief advisor ronald reagan on economics doctor paul greg roberts
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:37.040]  tell you this
[1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:39.400]  you just heard stiglitz two-time nobel prize winner
[1:35:39.400 --> 1:35:40.440]  for economics
[1:35:40.440 --> 1:35:42.160]  and peace
[1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:45.480]  uh... we can have all the do you need to the top guys the top guys don't like
[1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:46.320]  being wrong
[1:35:46.320 --> 1:35:47.840]  so they'll tell you what's really gonna happen
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:50.880]  the hacks they put on cnbc and msnbc and
[1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:52.920]  fox financial and all this
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:54.680]  you know they'll tell you everything's great things wonderful
[1:35:54.680 --> 1:35:57.720]  what scares me is they're finally getting the point of admitting everything's not
[1:35:57.720 --> 1:35:59.960]  wonderful
[1:35:59.960 --> 1:36:01.920]  and i'm so busy
[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:04.880]  that by about eighty percent of the money i got in this world is just in a
[1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:08.920]  business account is to run this this company for a few months
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:10.040]  and i'm going
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:12.840]  you know i need to take that out of that account put another account just to
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:16.160]  run this business should i even be on the air right now
[1:36:16.160 --> 1:36:20.040]  when yahoo is talking about bank runs going on
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:24.000]  and went to and when the seattle times is talking about bank runs
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:30.080]  and people are starting to advise bank runs
[1:36:30.080 --> 1:36:31.480]  i realized that
[1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:33.600]  i've tried to be fiscally responsible
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:36.320]  and had the money run this place for five six months and
[1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:39.280]  maybe that's even in jeopardy thank god for the money bomb we did but i'm trying
[1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:40.320]  to expand to a
[1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:42.240]  tv show building another
[1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:43.960]  studio right now with like
[1:36:43.960 --> 1:36:46.760]  six cameras which are all professional and
[1:36:46.760 --> 1:36:49.440]  you know just to put out more you know better information better package
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:51.920]  information for people
[1:36:51.920 --> 1:36:53.880]  that's another reason i didn't go to new york
[1:36:53.880 --> 1:36:57.360]  i can't fly me in my whole crew up to new york is just to give a speech and
[1:36:57.360 --> 1:36:58.920]  hang out with a bunch of people
[1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:02.960]  i'm trying to be frugal here but with your money that you bought my videos and
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:04.520]  books and materials from
[1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:07.040]  i really see that as your money
[1:37:07.040 --> 1:37:10.120]  and i see it as a sacred mission to try to stay afloat if we go into a full
[1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:11.080]  board depression
[1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:12.800]  i've told my it people
[1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:16.360]  i want to more servers if we get those last week
[1:37:16.360 --> 1:37:17.880]  all we did
[1:37:17.880 --> 1:37:19.920]  we did order to more servers
[1:37:19.920 --> 1:37:23.880]  i mean i want them now because we barely got the servers we need right now and
[1:37:23.880 --> 1:37:26.680]  they're going to be companies going under left and right in fact i'm changing
[1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:28.280]  that i want for
[1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:30.880]  new of those cheap good servers
[1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:35.680]  now now now now now now now and i'm not in my cruise in a great job
[1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:37.040]  i'm just saying folks
[1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:40.240]  we're in an emergency situation we're in the middle of a typhoon
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:43.600]  and i'm a captain on my little ship and i'm saying batten down hatches
[1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:47.120]  you know get those sales down so they don't rip off you know secure the main
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:50.200]  mass everybody else below bail bail
[1:37:50.200 --> 1:37:53.400]  and people are running the balers and the yuppies are still giggling and
[1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:55.080]  laughing and dancing around and
[1:37:55.080 --> 1:37:58.600]  smirking and it's all and people say well you know that's good that's that's
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:38:00.000]  confidence
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:01.280]  but this isn't
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:03.240]  a crisis like we've seen before
[1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:05.720]  this is a top-down crisis
[1:38:05.720 --> 1:38:12.560]  this isn't a but i should know about prize winner on i said this is a bottom
[1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:17.000]  issue of us having to be right but this didn't originate from the economy
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:19.120]  this originated from the elites
[1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:21.800]  and that's why it's such a dog in pony show
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:25.240]  to say oh some people that lie on their mortgage forms
[1:38:25.240 --> 1:38:27.400]  they cause that no the banks
[1:38:27.400 --> 1:38:30.000]  decided two years ago year and a half ago
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:30.880]  to stop
[1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:32.040]  issuing
[1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:33.880]  unlimited fiat
[1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:35.080]  uh...
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:36.720]  to to to
[1:38:36.720 --> 1:38:37.960]  to the bottom
[1:38:37.960 --> 1:38:40.720]  see because they already gotten us
[1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:43.920]  in two thousand and seven at the start of the year was announced that in two
[1:38:43.920 --> 1:38:48.080]  thousand and six we had become a net debt or nation individually greater than
[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:49.840]  even in the depths of the great depression
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:53.440]  and at that point they flip the switch they had gotten us in debt
[1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:56.520]  they had bankrupted us and now it was time for receivership
[1:38:56.520 --> 1:38:57.880]  that's while banks
[1:38:57.880 --> 1:39:00.280]  quote make their money they issue fake
[1:39:00.280 --> 1:39:01.240]  liquidity
[1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:04.800]  on a ballot sheet or now a computer but the real assets of the farms the
[1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:08.720]  ranches the companies the intellectual properties the technologies
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:11.760]  the military companies the media companies the infrastructure
[1:39:11.760 --> 1:39:14.040]  the the comp the uh...
[1:39:14.040 --> 1:39:16.760]  commodities like gold and silver and in timber
[1:39:16.760 --> 1:39:22.640]  and and and uranium and bauxite and nickel and all of these things and oil
[1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:25.120]  and all its derivatives
[1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:28.000]  that's what they do during these implosions and then they
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:31.360]  got everything they have in shipping and real assets now they're going to come
[1:39:31.360 --> 1:39:33.760]  in with a police escort
[1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:37.480]  in enough they are going to take on the testicles with roberts was talking
[1:39:37.480 --> 1:39:39.160]  about how they plan to take the pension funds
[1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:42.000]  bush changed the law in two thousand and four
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:43.920]  and congress voted for it
[1:39:43.920 --> 1:39:47.160]  so again this is both parties
[1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:49.760]  you go pull the vote up and i remember it was the vast majority in congress
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:51.440]  voted for it
[1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:55.480]  to say your money in a pension fund money they took from you
[1:39:55.480 --> 1:39:57.880]  out of your check is not yours and that
[1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:00.560]  companies and the government can take it
[1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:03.320]  that's why roberts just said they're planning to take your pension funds
[1:40:03.320 --> 1:40:06.080]  that's why i've been screaming for four years and take your pension funds and
[1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:08.800]  newspapers have written a few articles about me and blogs going
[1:40:08.800 --> 1:40:13.040]  he fear mongers and says they're going to take the pension funds with no evidence
[1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:15.960]  what are you talking about they've already taken a bunch of pension funds
[1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:19.760]  at the time that happened and they change the law where they can that's
[1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:22.440]  like legalizing murder
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:25.960]  legalizing grand theft
[1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:28.320]  legalizing bank robbery
[1:40:28.320 --> 1:40:29.960]  mean that's what it is
[1:40:29.960 --> 1:40:31.360]  they wire it out of there
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:34.200]  i got a new stick somebody up at the front counter
[1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:38.040]  but it's armed robbery you try to go stop the bank for taking your pension fund
[1:40:38.040 --> 1:40:43.960]  you try to go stop the bride they will send cops to kill your butt
[1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:46.640]  and so yes they're going to take your pension funds and if you don't like a
[1:40:46.640 --> 1:40:49.320]  little gun your ass down the street
[1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:51.680]  that's how this works folks
[1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:54.000]  now you just heard the father of reaganomics the former head of the
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:58.760]  treasury tell you that
[1:40:58.760 --> 1:41:02.520]  now before they did this takeover of fanny may and freddy mac and we had
[1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:04.480]  guest on bob chapman ted anderson
[1:41:04.480 --> 1:41:06.000]  roberts and others
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.600]  we talked about how they were going to drive down oil they always do that
[1:41:08.600 --> 1:41:09.960]  anyways in the fall
[1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:12.000]  that's what's going up again in the spring and summer
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.880]  they were in a drive down gold drive down silver
[1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:16.280]  we laid all that out
[1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:19.680]  but there'd be some type of correction that would raise back up in the winter
[1:41:19.680 --> 1:41:22.760]  now it was a bigger correction than i thought it would be
[1:41:22.760 --> 1:41:25.480]  which is quite frankly a buying opportunities on the truck a
[1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:28.280]  meager amount of capital put in some gold
[1:41:28.280 --> 1:41:30.160]  this is a buying opportunity
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:31.960]  i believe it's at bottom
[1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:35.360]  and if you see them bailing out trillions of dollars in talk of
[1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:38.800]  the treasury going in solvent and talk of great depression from nobel prize
[1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:39.480]  winners
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:42.760]  and then the mainstream media talking about bank runs
[1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:45.840]  it is smart to have five ten twenty percent
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:49.080]  in silver in gold in palladium in platinum
[1:41:49.080 --> 1:41:50.840]  uh... and i and and and
[1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:54.360]  i believe that people should do this i mean i bought gold at two hundred and
[1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:57.040]  eighty bucks an ounce and i bought gold in a thousand dollars an ounce and i
[1:41:57.040 --> 1:42:01.680]  feel good about every purchase and i haven't sold any of it
[1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:05.840]  because it is my emergency backup it will always have some intrinsic value
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:11.520]  it can't be devalued down to nothing and when the bottom finally falls out
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:15.360]  this fantasy land's gonna end and gold now should be rated with inflation up
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:18.360]  close to three thousand an ounce not twenty two twenty five hundred like it
[1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:20.760]  was a year ago
[1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:22.320]  now i don't know if it'll ever go there
[1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:25.800]  in this allison wonderland they make for claiming pigs can fly and
[1:42:25.800 --> 1:42:28.360]  you know they may elect a horse president i don't know
[1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:31.040]  but uh...
[1:42:31.040 --> 1:42:33.120]  we're living in the twilight zone right now
[1:42:33.120 --> 1:42:36.800]  i mean they are in one level implosions every day
[1:42:36.800 --> 1:42:40.000]  for the last two weeks and talk of more for the next few months
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.560]  and then stuff will kind of settle down for a few weeks and then more
[1:42:42.560 --> 1:42:45.920]  implosions and i don't worry that was the end and then more implosions you know
[1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:46.960]  what this means
[1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:50.560]  all these big brokerage firms and banks going under and being taken over and
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:53.640]  going into receivership and being bailed out what that means to jobs and
[1:42:53.640 --> 1:42:57.000]  investments and they've now got to go in with hundreds of billions of dollars
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:57.840]  just in the last
[1:42:57.840 --> 1:43:01.080]  two days what's happened and revalue all that
[1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:04.200]  and then they find out there's no way to revalue it
[1:43:04.200 --> 1:43:06.560]  and now there's talk of thousands of banks going under
[1:43:06.560 --> 1:43:10.440]  i wanted to bring ten on the admin on about a month
[1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:14.520]  uh... change uh... major buying opportunity gold has started going back
[1:43:14.520 --> 1:43:17.720]  up again was last time i checked the silver same thing
[1:43:17.720 --> 1:43:21.880]  the bankers before they did this try to hammer commodities down profit take
[1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:23.840]  it's always the same cycle
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:26.080]  uh... and uh... i really
[1:43:26.080 --> 1:43:29.120]  don't see uh... a financial world
[1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:30.560]  where gold and silver
[1:43:30.560 --> 1:43:33.640]  and and other commodities wouldn't go back up
[1:43:33.640 --> 1:43:36.360]  a lot of other commodities are still still still ballooning
[1:43:36.360 --> 1:43:39.000]  as a calling those bubbles but they really are bubbles
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:40.920]  if it's based on a devalued dollar
[1:43:40.920 --> 1:43:43.640]  and everything the treasury is doing everything the federal reserves doing
[1:43:43.640 --> 1:43:46.520]  is signaling the dollar is to put
[1:43:46.520 --> 1:43:50.480]  uh... and and and so i guess so it wouldn't fully plunge they bolstered it
[1:43:50.480 --> 1:43:53.960]  with the threat against russia and the muscle flexing people said okay
[1:43:53.960 --> 1:43:55.360]  america isn't dead
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:43:58.040]  but how long can that trick continued ed
[1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:01.360]  well it's it's not going to continue very long because we got institutions
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:04.560]  right now that are just so big that the united states government can't bail
[1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:05.920]  them out without printing
[1:44:05.920 --> 1:44:06.640]  just
[1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:09.440]  buckets and buckets and buckets full of money
[1:44:09.440 --> 1:44:12.400]  i mean you watch what's going on out there that federal reserve system with
[1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:13.880]  that open market committee
[1:44:13.880 --> 1:44:17.240]  is dumping cash into the treasury like there's no tomorrow
[1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:21.280]  and uh... and they're just uh... you know every time fanny man freddy mac and
[1:44:21.280 --> 1:44:24.920]  and uh... now we've got uh... layman brothers we're now what a year and a
[1:44:24.920 --> 1:44:29.160]  half into this all men alex it it's crazy i mean i looked at the wall street
[1:44:29.160 --> 1:44:32.560]  journal yesterday and i have you know i was wondering if i should even be in
[1:44:32.560 --> 1:44:36.320]  this country anymore i mean it was just the kind of con the kind of businesses
[1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:37.840]  that are failing around us
[1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:41.400]  uh... total looting all by design remember folks we didn't just start
[1:44:41.400 --> 1:44:43.040]  claiming this was by design now
[1:44:43.040 --> 1:44:44.760]  we got infiltrated
[1:44:44.760 --> 1:44:46.400]  three years ago
[1:44:46.400 --> 1:44:48.640]  uh... the
[1:44:48.640 --> 1:44:49.600]  the uh...
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:53.280]  builder berg meeting and we also can had infiltrators into the estan bull two
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:54.320]  years ago
[1:44:54.320 --> 1:44:57.200]  and then obviously got a lot of intel out of virginia
[1:44:57.200 --> 1:44:59.280]  chantele outside dc this year
[1:44:59.280 --> 1:45:02.040]  and those bastards said three years ago they said
[1:45:02.040 --> 1:45:03.040]  plus
[1:45:03.040 --> 1:45:05.320]  carly that's three years ago
[1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:09.160]  they said we're going to implode the housing market and start
[1:45:09.160 --> 1:45:11.800]  a domino effect to consolidate
[1:45:11.800 --> 1:45:16.120]  so there's no doubt they engineered this and i want the people to know that dead
[1:45:16.120 --> 1:45:19.400]  well at the right now liquidity is everything anybody that has something
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:22.960]  that's a value that's not tied to the u.s. currencies they're gonna have
[1:45:22.960 --> 1:45:25.920]  something but anybody that has their money in the bank they have it in the
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:28.120]  stock market they have it in all these different
[1:45:28.120 --> 1:45:30.680]  paper type investments are going to get wiped out
[1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:33.600]  and that's going to put people in the position we have to hand over their
[1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:34.320]  homes
[1:45:34.320 --> 1:45:35.840]  and hand over all these other
[1:45:35.840 --> 1:45:40.000]  other real assets like you're talking about in the and they didn't triple johnny
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.400]  law last twenty for fifteen years
[1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:45.160]  for now they didn't travel the cops for them for nothing
[1:45:45.160 --> 1:45:47.560]  that's to take everything you got i'm not even
[1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:52.440]  bashing these poor cops and other cops go take the cops from your mama's house
[1:45:52.440 --> 1:45:56.160]  well you know and it is definitely time to batten down the hatches get out of
[1:45:56.160 --> 1:45:58.800]  debt i've got got people that are crying to me that the
[1:45:58.800 --> 1:46:02.120]  they leverage themselves long in the marketplace when silver and gold was
[1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:02.760]  going up
[1:46:02.760 --> 1:46:05.520]  and now they got margin calls it's like what are you doing
[1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:08.640]  you get the stuff physically in your hands you can hold on to it
[1:46:08.640 --> 1:46:13.240]  and who cares if you bought it at fifteen dollars silver or ten dollars silver
[1:46:13.240 --> 1:46:17.000]  it doesn't matter you can see the thing melt in around you know in reality the
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:19.440]  dollar is birdcage liner and
[1:46:19.440 --> 1:46:22.880]  rest in peace and they may redollar eyes or do something new or
[1:46:22.880 --> 1:46:25.040]  tie it to carbon taxes but regardless
[1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:28.400]  i mean for the next decade or so and that's what every major economist is
[1:46:28.400 --> 1:46:29.080]  saying
[1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:33.120]  that dollar is going downhill when is it going to go and it's already gone down
[1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:36.280]  sixty seven percent and bounced up five percent and started going back down
[1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:37.400]  again this week
[1:46:37.400 --> 1:46:41.000]  uh... you know that's kind of a dead cat bounce bouncing down the cliff
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:43.200]  uh... i just think people need to move
[1:46:43.200 --> 1:46:45.360]  now aggressively this is the major
[1:46:45.360 --> 1:46:49.360]  buying opportunity to tell about the specials most definitely major buying
[1:46:49.360 --> 1:46:52.120]  opportunity and right now the walking liberty haves
[1:46:52.120 --> 1:46:55.360]  we're looking at those at ten dollars apiece right now i have it i have a
[1:46:55.360 --> 1:46:57.120]  six ninety five
[1:46:57.120 --> 1:46:59.800]  and that was just a few months ago when they're at that price
[1:46:59.800 --> 1:47:02.960]  currently right now you can get them rolls of twenty at one hundred and thirty
[1:47:02.960 --> 1:47:03.640]  nine
[1:47:03.640 --> 1:47:07.040]  the british sovereign we all know that those are at about two fifteen
[1:47:07.040 --> 1:47:10.200]  uh... you know that i'm sorry about two hundred ninety and right now they're
[1:47:10.200 --> 1:47:12.120]  two hundred and seventeen
[1:47:12.120 --> 1:47:13.280]  uh... you know that
[1:47:13.280 --> 1:47:16.680]  if you're picking this stuff almost for half price right now
[1:47:16.680 --> 1:47:20.280]  frank said one seventy three right now those ones are the ones are up around
[1:47:20.280 --> 1:47:22.520]  two fifteen to twenty
[1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:25.760]  that the silver without a question is the one that take the most hit on the
[1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:26.680]  downside
[1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:29.360]  it'll also be the one that rebounds the fast enough
[1:47:29.360 --> 1:47:32.920]  uh... the fastest and that uh... and that walking liberty half those i could
[1:47:32.920 --> 1:47:33.880]  even get them
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:37.960]  you know there was no supply and right now i had employees that bought gold
[1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:41.600]  uh... under my advice when it was about six hundred and then i said dump it when
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:42.800]  it had a thousand
[1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:45.480]  they said but you're not gonna dump yours and i said well this is insurance for
[1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:46.800]  me but i and then
[1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:49.320]  they dumped it were like a two months before
[1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:51.000]  and then it's job
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.640]  they made you know good profits for themselves of the couple guys are in
[1:47:53.640 --> 1:47:54.840]  the office that listen to me
[1:47:54.840 --> 1:47:58.320]  but with my major holdings i did not sell it if it goes up or down
[1:47:58.320 --> 1:48:01.920]  well because to me that is emergency backup it that that's just the whole
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:05.200]  point alex i mean i hear these people with these leverage positions i mean for
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:07.240]  god's sakes don't do that
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:09.480]  get the gold and take it physically i mean
[1:48:09.480 --> 1:48:12.480]  why lose more than you have into it you can't you can't hold on to these
[1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:17.400]  fluctuations you know i mean this is bottom line a a a stopgap measure
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:20.880]  an emergency thing to do in uncertain times metals
[1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:22.040]  are king
[1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:25.320]  tell them the specials you got that yeah again pick up the walking liberty
[1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:27.600]  halves are at six ninety five apiece
[1:48:27.600 --> 1:48:30.880]  or you can pick them up at a hundred and thirty nine dollars per roll of twenty
[1:48:30.880 --> 1:48:31.640]  you can't
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:34.000]  you can't beat that alex you gotta pick those up
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.800]  the british sovereign gold coin quarter ounce piece
[1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:38.560]  two hundred and seventeen
[1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:39.760]  get that one
[1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:43.600]  frank coin one seventy three that's a fifth of an ounce again
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:47.360]  it right now is the time to be getting involved in this market do it now
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:51.320]  do it now before it's too late because it is getting to be too late real fast
[1:48:51.320 --> 1:48:52.680]  and we've got an opportunity
[1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:56.640]  with lower price well the incredible thing if ted we see scarcity in golden
[1:48:56.640 --> 1:48:57.440]  silver
[1:48:57.440 --> 1:48:58.640]  hard to get

[1:50:50.800 --> 1:50:55.360]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door
[1:50:55.360 --> 1:50:58.520]  seven years after the attacks of september eleven

[1:51:33.580 --> 1:51:37.580]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:51:40.580 --> 1:51:43.580]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:51:43.580 --> 1:51:46.580]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:51:46.580 --> 1:51:51.580]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of...

[1:53:58.580 --> 1:54:02.580]  You can really see the trend, death of the dollar.
[1:54:02.580 --> 1:54:06.580]  And it's all about design and bringing them to the world order.
[1:54:06.580 --> 1:54:10.580]  I mean, we got it from inside Bilderberg. Those bastards.
[1:54:10.580 --> 1:54:16.580]  They're greedy. They want to destroy the economy so they can buy it all up.
[1:54:16.580 --> 1:54:22.580]  We're going to open the phones up and we have Cindy Sheehan on where this will talk about the economy,
[1:54:22.580 --> 1:54:33.580]  the war, a host of issues where they're 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[1:54:33.580 --> 1:54:36.580]  You know, what am I doing?
[1:54:36.580 --> 1:54:41.580]  I just don't remember. The main lines for Genesis are down.
[1:54:41.580 --> 1:54:43.580]  So I can't give out the phone number.
[1:54:43.580 --> 1:54:47.580]  Well, I guess we can give out our phone number.
[1:54:47.580 --> 1:54:52.580]  Oh, no, the phone lines are back up for the callers.
[1:54:52.580 --> 1:54:57.580]  Okay, good. Well, what phone lines aren't back up then?
[1:54:57.580 --> 1:55:02.580]  Okay, okay, okay. You guys can't call out. People can call in.
[1:55:02.580 --> 1:55:09.580]  Oh, that's good. 1-800-259-9231.
[1:55:09.580 --> 1:55:16.580]  We have got so much to cover here. You know, I could recap some of the things that have happened.
[1:55:16.580 --> 1:55:18.580]  A really important story by Paul Watson.
[1:55:18.580 --> 1:55:22.580]  Run on the banks, Americans could lose their deposits.
[1:55:22.580 --> 1:55:29.580]  You know, it's badwinyahoo.com, which is a story about fiscal armageddon.
[1:55:29.580 --> 1:55:37.580]  And then we have another report here about Goldman earnings fall, 70% sending shares still lower.
[1:55:37.580 --> 1:55:45.580]  A banking crisis in Britain heading for the worst recession since the 1930s at London Telegraph.
[1:55:45.580 --> 1:55:52.580]  Hewlett Packard asked 24,000 jobs take a $1.7 billion charge.
[1:55:52.580 --> 1:55:58.580]  HP said it will carry out the cutbacks over the next three years while replacing about half the jobs
[1:55:58.580 --> 1:56:05.580]  in new areas of its service businesses and announce the plan ahead of a meeting with Wall Street analysts
[1:56:05.580 --> 1:56:08.580]  to detail the merger plans.
[1:56:08.580 --> 1:56:13.580]  So they're all merging, trying to stay afloat, which is good for the globalist consolidation.
[1:56:13.580 --> 1:56:17.580]  Best Buy Profit Below View shares fall.
[1:56:17.580 --> 1:56:21.580]  Best Buy, one of the most successful retailers out there in trouble.
[1:56:21.580 --> 1:56:25.580]  Consumer Electronics Retailer Best Buy reported a worse than expected 19% drop.
[1:56:25.580 --> 1:56:31.580]  The second quarter earnings has spent more money than ProofStores, saying it shares down 7%.
[1:56:31.580 --> 1:56:38.580]  FTSE 100 plunges through 5,000 mark as share route continues.
[1:56:38.580 --> 1:56:41.580]  London Index shares down 229 points.
[1:56:41.580 --> 1:56:44.580]  HBOS shares plummet more than 40%.
[1:56:44.580 --> 1:56:48.580]  The global market panic followed by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers deepened today
[1:56:48.580 --> 1:56:52.580]  when the FTSE plunged to the 5,000 point.
[1:56:52.580 --> 1:56:57.580]  Investors continue to reel from yesterday's high drama.
[1:56:57.580 --> 1:57:01.580]  It's kind of patronizing, isn't it? What's high drama?
[1:57:01.580 --> 1:57:06.580]  And central banks pumped more into the system, more money into the system.
[1:57:06.580 --> 1:57:15.580]  The index 100 tumbled 229 points to 4,975.2 or almost 4.5%.
[1:57:15.580 --> 1:57:18.580]  Confidence has been shattered.
[1:57:18.580 --> 1:57:22.580]  Well, yeah, for a year they keep telling us it's a conspiracy theory if you say it's going to get worse.
[1:57:22.580 --> 1:57:24.580]  They actually use those terms.
[1:57:24.580 --> 1:57:30.580]  Later, the U.S. Federal Reserve offered to lend 50 billion to banks having to put 70 billion in yesterday.
[1:57:30.580 --> 1:57:33.580]  Oh, 50 billion today, 70 billion yesterday.
[1:57:33.580 --> 1:57:35.580]  There's all this happening.
[1:57:35.580 --> 1:57:42.580]  Meanwhile, yesterday on Black Monday, McCain said the fundamentals of our economy are still strong.
[1:57:42.580 --> 1:57:45.580]  Oh, yeah, record consumer debt, record corporate debt.
[1:57:45.580 --> 1:57:48.580]  All the real assets have been taken out the back door.
[1:57:48.580 --> 1:57:53.580]  I mean, your cities had billions and billions in assets and secret investments.
[1:57:53.580 --> 1:57:55.580]  All have been transferred out now.
[1:57:55.580 --> 1:58:01.580]  Huge, enron-level collapses, bigger, bigger than those, every day.
[1:58:01.580 --> 1:58:05.580]  Also, the Ukrainian government falls apart. That's the BBC headline.
[1:58:05.580 --> 1:58:10.580]  Israel's wedging a secret war with Iran. Stay with us.
[1:58:10.580 --> 1:58:19.580]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:19.580 --> 1:58:26.580]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:58:26.580 --> 1:58:30.580]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:58:30.580 --> 1:58:32.580]  bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:58:32.580 --> 1:58:35.580]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:58:35.580 --> 1:58:42.580]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:58:42.580 --> 1:58:49.580]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:58:49.580 --> 1:58:53.580]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:58:53.580 --> 1:59:12.580]  Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:59:12.580 --> 1:59:22.580]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:59:22.580 --> 1:59:29.580]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:29.580 --> 1:59:51.580]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:59:51.580 --> 2:00:03.580]  Well, for the next 30 minutes or so, we're joined by Cindy to check in with us once a month or so with her historic campaign against the treacherous Nancy Pelosi.
[2:00:03.580 --> 2:00:10.580]  It is treacherous to claim that she was with anti-war pro-peace people, folks that are against murder.
[2:00:10.580 --> 2:00:18.580]  It's treacherous to then get into power and enthusiastically actually expand the war and cheerlead for it.
[2:00:18.580 --> 2:00:30.580]  And you've got 90-plus percent in polls in the San Francisco Bay Area of the district she's in. Against the war, they want it over now, but Pelosi ignores that.
[2:00:30.580 --> 2:00:36.580]  So if Cindy Sheehan doesn't win, we know something's rotten the state of Denmark. We've got 50-something days until the election.
[2:00:36.580 --> 2:00:44.580]  Here's your chance to get in there, to canvass, to donate, to help Cindy Sheehan as she runs against Nancy Pelosi.
[2:00:44.580 --> 2:00:51.580]  This is what we need to see from people out there. And she's here to talk about the economy, the war.
[2:00:51.580 --> 2:00:57.580]  She just gets better and better in the speech I saw her give out and Denver was just really powerful.
[2:00:57.580 --> 2:01:04.580]  She talked about the two parties, the twins, and she is now with us for the next 30 minutes. Cindy Sheehan, good to have you here.
[2:01:04.580 --> 2:01:06.580]  Cindy Sheehan, good to have you here.
[2:01:06.580 --> 2:01:08.580]  Cindy Sheehan, good to have you here.
[2:01:08.580 --> 2:01:10.580]  Well, it's good to have you here with us.
[2:01:10.580 --> 2:01:14.580]  There's so much to talk about, but how about sending me throwing questions at you?
[2:01:14.580 --> 2:01:18.580]  Talk about what you think's most important right now. What's on your mind?
[2:01:18.580 --> 2:01:26.580]  Well, these past days, I've been really sorry that I didn't major in economics.
[2:01:26.580 --> 2:01:34.580]  So I've been trying to really focus on that and try to get a handle on what's happening.
[2:01:34.580 --> 2:01:43.580]  And I know what the government is doing is not the best correction for what's happening with our economy collapsing.
[2:01:43.580 --> 2:01:52.580]  And I think that, you know, the major issue around the whole economy is, and people don't acknowledge this,
[2:01:52.580 --> 2:02:04.580]  but you don't see anybody in mainstream America on the news or are candidates or president in the two major parties, which I call the monopoly now.
[2:02:04.580 --> 2:02:10.580]  I used to call it a duopoly, but why even pretend that there's any difference in it?
[2:02:10.580 --> 2:02:23.580]  But they don't talk about how our military economy is collapsing. This country, like it, collapsed all other empires before it.
[2:02:23.580 --> 2:02:30.580]  And they're not talking about decreasing military spending or bringing our troops home from Iraq or Afghanistan,
[2:02:30.580 --> 2:02:37.580]  or closing our bases around the world, which are just basic imperialism.
[2:02:37.580 --> 2:02:49.580]  They're talking about bailouts and stimulus and all these Keynesian things that haven't worked for a long time,
[2:02:49.580 --> 2:02:54.580]  because they're designed to make the rich richer and disappear our middle class.
[2:02:54.580 --> 2:03:00.580]  Well, you're right. In fact, they're saying they're going to continue all the exact same policies and then bail out,
[2:03:00.580 --> 2:03:05.580]  and they really designed all this. We have their documents, Cindy, designed this to fully implode the economy.
[2:03:05.580 --> 2:03:11.580]  Basically, the military industrial complex is just eating the country. They do what they do everywhere else.
[2:03:11.580 --> 2:03:18.580]  They are eating their own. They're engaged in cannibalism or strip mining, and they're imploding the economy
[2:03:18.580 --> 2:03:25.580]  so they can, quote, have the taxpayers bail them out, but really that's just so bigger banks can gobble up smaller banks.
[2:03:25.580 --> 2:03:35.580]  Well, absolutely. And I just don't understand how people think that continuing failed policies is going to make a correction in the economy.
[2:03:35.580 --> 2:03:44.580]  And instead of blaming Republicans or instead of blaming George Bush or whoever, we can go all the way back to the Clinton administration
[2:03:44.580 --> 2:03:52.580]  for a majority of what's happening today. But we really need to get down to business, and we don't need false hope
[2:03:52.580 --> 2:04:03.580]  or, you know, false change. We need a leader who will actually identify the problem and say that we're in deep trouble.
[2:04:03.580 --> 2:04:09.580]  And something beautiful happened. I want to talk to you about this after the break. Ron Paul, Ralph Nader, Dennis Kasinich,
[2:04:09.580 --> 2:04:13.580]  all together saying this, what you just said, what you've been saying, we don't need false change.
[2:04:13.580 --> 2:04:19.580]  We need real change in truly diverse political movements that are huge coming together.
[2:04:19.580 --> 2:04:23.580]  They need to get behind Cindy Sheehan, and they are behind Cindy Sheehan. Cindy, stay there.
[2:04:23.580 --> 2:04:50.580]  We'll be back in just three minutes. Stay with us.

[2:07:28.580 --> 2:07:39.580]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:07:39.580 --> 2:07:56.580]  Okay, going right back to Cindy Sheehan who's running for Congress against the traitor Nancy Pelosi. And it's almost even worse than being George Bush. You know, he's a warmonger. We know what he stands for. He did lie. So he didn't want foreign entanglements like Clinton had done.
[2:07:56.580 --> 2:08:11.580]  But then went forward with Pelosi saying, send me there all in the war. Make me the Speaker of the House and we know what she did. So we're talking about real change, not fake change. And we saw that in the press conference last week with Ralph Nader, Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich, and others.
[2:08:11.580 --> 2:08:14.580]  Incredible unity. Cindy, please continue.
[2:08:14.580 --> 2:08:33.580]  Well, you know, I was in Norway last week when they did that press conference, and I think that it's really important to support third-party or independent candidates. I could really just walk into this office here in San Francisco if I would just endorse Barack Obama.
[2:08:33.580 --> 2:08:49.580]  But I'm not going to sell out my principles and I'm not going to sell out humanity to endorse somebody who I don't think will be good for the country or good for the world or really have any policies that differ from McPayland or the Bush administration.
[2:08:49.580 --> 2:09:07.580]  So I think that it was very important. It was very historic for the candidates and for Ron Paul to, but because party and say, I'm not going to endorse a Republican. And of course, I absolutely agree with them 100 percent.
[2:09:07.580 --> 2:09:18.580]  It's beautiful to see this happening. But break that down for listeners. If you endorse Barack Obama, the party, I guess locally, is let you know that they may not.
[2:09:18.580 --> 2:09:30.580]  Let you take Pelosi's seat or not try to block you. Then it'd be a shoe in because you're very, very popular, especially with people in the San Francisco area, but all across the country.
[2:09:30.580 --> 2:09:39.580]  But you can't support Obama because then you'd be compromised. He is supporting expanding the war, continuing the conflict.
[2:09:39.580 --> 2:09:56.580]  Well, you know, not only that, he is just a very conservative Democrat. And there's not very many things that he differs with on McCain. And yes, I have had pressure from even people on my own staff to come out and endorse Obama.
[2:09:56.580 --> 2:10:13.580]  And I'm not like Obama. I don't pander to people. I don't change what I know is right in my heart to get votes or to get money or to go forward. If winter lose on November 4th, I'm going to win or lose with my integrity intact.
[2:10:13.580 --> 2:10:32.580]  And then we can like, you know, just like, like Ron Paul, I don't agree with everything he says, but you know, he is a man of integrity and principle, and he won't sell out his principle for votes or money and how successful was he in raising money and raising awareness over the primary season.
[2:10:32.580 --> 2:10:41.580]  So I think that people recognize and they want leadership. They want leadership with integrity and they want leadership with courage.
[2:10:41.580 --> 2:10:57.580]  Well, I want to bring up a tough subject. I was out in the countryside over the weekend visiting family and some family was visiting and they were, some family was visiting family that I was visiting.
[2:10:57.580 --> 2:11:05.580]  We're sitting around the dinner table and one of them was aware that I like you and have interviewed you. And it's, you know, a military family, most of them are in the military.
[2:11:05.580 --> 2:11:15.580]  And he said, well, that she and lady, you know, she's got a right to say what she wants. But what she did is make her son's death count for nothing.
[2:11:15.580 --> 2:11:28.580]  She's taken, you know, away the sacrifice he made. And I just said, no, I don't want to speak for her, but I would imagine that she would say that I'm trying to stop other people's sons and daughters from needlessly being killed.
[2:11:28.580 --> 2:11:42.580]  And instead of him dying for a lie, dying, you know, in a fraud, I am, you know, making his memory stand out as a testament to the crimes that have been committed so that his life does mean something.
[2:11:42.580 --> 2:11:53.580]  And so that he didn't die for a lie that, by the way, he didn't support and wrote to you in letters. Now, is that accurate? And I'm sure you can add something to it.
[2:11:53.580 --> 2:12:09.580]  Well, that's 100% accurate. You know, George Bush is the one who has abused our military and sent people over to die for lies, to kill innocent people for lies, to destroy a country for lies, or to be wounded for lies and deception.
[2:12:09.580 --> 2:12:28.580]  And, you know, it's not a reflection on Casey or the military, it's a reflection on the leadership that have done this. And I believe that Casey did die for nothing. You know, he died, he was killed by an Iraqi insurgent who wanted Casey out of his country.
[2:12:28.580 --> 2:12:43.580]  And I don't blame that Iraqi insurgent. I blame the system who sent Casey and his comrades to Iraq for no reason except for profit and imperial greed. So, you know, you answered it absolutely correct.
[2:12:43.580 --> 2:12:52.580]  And the reason I fight so hard is to make Casey's death count for something positive, but also for, you know, our children and grandchildren.
[2:12:52.580 --> 2:13:11.580]  They won't have to go through this. Now, I'll be damned if I let the neocon elite, which Nancy Pelosi is part of that, send our country, or neoliberal, I think her and Obama's views would be more like neoliberal, allow them to take our country to a path of total destruction.
[2:13:11.580 --> 2:13:23.580]  I have a grandson now. He's four months old. Every time I look at him, my fire is bound even more because I don't want him to grow up in the same kind of country that Casey grew up.
[2:13:23.580 --> 2:13:24.580]  Well, how do we ever...
[2:13:24.580 --> 2:13:25.580]  I'm sorry for...
[2:13:25.580 --> 2:13:35.580]  Absolutely. How do we ever get to the point where you're not supposed to question the government, you're not supposed to be involved, and we all know the greatest expression of patriotism is to engage in dissent.
[2:13:35.580 --> 2:13:42.580]  I mean, the vast majority of us are against the war. We were taken there over a lie, and they somehow a million plus Iraqis are dead.
[2:13:42.580 --> 2:13:44.580]  This is an incredible Nazi level crime.
[2:13:44.580 --> 2:13:45.580]  Right.
[2:13:45.580 --> 2:13:50.580]  And then they just turn it around and say, oh, you hate America. You know, I mean, this is incredible.
[2:13:50.580 --> 2:14:07.580]  Both an absolute genocide and the America that they love is an America that tortures people, imprisons people without, you know, habeas corpus, which has been a basic right for centuries. This is a country that buys on people without warrants.
[2:14:07.580 --> 2:14:24.580]  This is a country that is impoverishing people to increase the wealth in the bottom line of the 1% of this country. And, you know, if this is the country that they love, then their values are seriously messed up.
[2:14:24.580 --> 2:14:34.580]  Well, it certainly is. In fact, I mean, it's so asinine. The lie is so big, it's hard to even articulate it.
[2:14:34.580 --> 2:14:48.580]  I mean, to be butchering and systematically dismantling the entire Bill of Rights, the Constitution, everything good about this nation, everything that made us great, not that we've ever been perfect, but better than most, and then to claim that they're doing it for America.
[2:14:48.580 --> 2:14:57.580]  This is just more dirt if we don't have our morals. And we've had our name destroyed worldwide, and then we're trying to salvage some of America.
[2:14:57.580 --> 2:15:12.580]  And then they tell us we hate America because we love freedom and liberty and not attacking innocent countries and not killing a million, 200,000 Iraqis in the last six years and not torturing children and raping and the rape.
[2:15:12.580 --> 2:15:21.580]  I mean, in the White House memos about torturing children, they're saying we're bad because we're against that. It's just, it's so over the top.
[2:15:21.580 --> 2:15:30.580]  I think it's because we recognize that, you know, the humanity and life for humanity aren't just contained within the borders of the United States.
[2:15:30.580 --> 2:15:41.580]  That, you know, people in Iraq and Afghanistan and wherever they deserve, and they want security and peace and prosperity as much as Americans want for their children.
[2:15:41.580 --> 2:16:01.580]  And so that somehow makes us anti-American because we're pro-humanity. But the real true values of this country are the values that we are fighting for to not disappear and not be forgotten, not be shoved down the memory hole of this, you know, Neocon ruling elite.
[2:16:01.580 --> 2:16:13.580]  And as long as we're alive, that's not going to happen. But they're trying to shut us up. They're trying to keep us out. And we appreciate your show and other shows that are independent from the mainstream.
[2:16:13.580 --> 2:16:25.580]  Because, you know, the mainstream media and the corporate media here are really trying to shut us out to not allow us to present our vision because our vision is so alternative.
[2:16:25.580 --> 2:16:31.580]  Well, that brings me, exactly, that brings me to another issue and I want to plug the campaign in different ways folks can get involved.
[2:16:31.580 --> 2:16:49.580]  But the inventor of the internet over in England and others are calling for basically restricting it, certifying websites, internet to governments, you know, the newspapers are imploding, TV ratings are plunging, alternative media is surging.
[2:16:49.580 --> 2:17:00.580]  And the mainstream has been discredited and they're angry at us, the alternative. They discredited themselves and so they're not just trying to shut you out of mainstream television and print.
[2:17:00.580 --> 2:17:04.580]  They're also trying to shut down and restrict the web. Can you speak to that?
[2:17:04.580 --> 2:17:23.580]  You know, and that's really common in other countries because I travel extensively and you have to register websites and you have to know that if you're on the internet that there are some sites that they're going to block and you will be, you know, but they're overt about it.
[2:17:23.580 --> 2:17:41.580]  You know, in the United States we know that we're being fired on via the internet but, you know, at least they're covert about it. And they've gone to the lengths to take away our non-biased news on the television.
[2:17:41.580 --> 2:18:00.580]  They've gone to great lengths to do that. There's no more fairness doctor. Nancy Pelosi can be on all the shows everywhere, you know, promoting her book or promoting her corporate malignant vision for America, but we can't demand equal time.
[2:18:00.580 --> 2:18:05.580]  And that's just something that they've been working on very hard for the past few decades.
[2:18:05.580 --> 2:18:13.580]  But then that's the other problem is the fairness doctrine and I would be, you know, for it if they're going to have Nancy Pelosi on your real candidate against her, you should be on those shows.
[2:18:13.580 --> 2:18:27.580]  But the point is they would then use that to shut me down and say, well, since Pelosi doesn't want to come on your show, you just can't talk about about Pelosi, you know, kind of like the quote campaign finance reform that just doubled the amount corporations can give but restrict citizens.
[2:18:27.580 --> 2:18:37.580]  But you're right. They are just giving her lavish coverage and really trying to shut you down. But your campaign is exploding and is surging. Tell us about that.
[2:18:37.580 --> 2:18:49.580]  Well, that's why it's so important for people to support us financially. If you can't come out to San Francisco to help, we are, of course, having an influx of people from all over the country here coming to help us.
[2:18:49.580 --> 2:18:58.580]  Just like Camp Casey, people came from everywhere to help, except for San Francisco is much nicer than Crawford, Texas. So, you know, invite everybody to come out.
[2:18:58.580 --> 2:19:07.580]  But if you can support us financially, anything, 510-25, up to the maximum donation of $2,300, that helps us get our message out.
[2:19:07.580 --> 2:19:20.580]  All we need to be able to do is buy airtime on TV, buy airtime on the radio, get billboards, get my face up on buses, spread our message to San Francisco.
[2:19:20.580 --> 2:19:22.580]  And stay there. Stay there. We'll do it.
[2:19:22.580 --> 2:19:28.580]  We've got a break. We're going to come back and we'll talk about that. You know, that way we'll do what?
[2:19:28.580 --> 2:19:35.580]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:19:35.580 --> 2:19:39.580]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:19:39.580 --> 2:19:41.580]  bin Laden. This is his MO.
[2:19:41.580 --> 2:19:44.580]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:19:44.580 --> 2:19:52.580]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:19:52.580 --> 2:19:58.580]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:19:58.580 --> 2:20:02.580]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:20:02.580 --> 2:20:09.580]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:20:09.580 --> 2:20:14.580]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[2:20:28.580 --> 2:20:35.580]  Jim Newcomer from ITUS Resources. September 16, 2008. Gold opened this morning at 7.84.40.
[2:20:35.580 --> 2:20:42.580]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for 808.25, 404.12 for half ounce, and 202.06 for quarter ounce.
[2:20:42.580 --> 2:20:46.580]  That's 808.25, 404.12, and 202.06.
[2:20:46.580 --> 2:20:53.580]  70% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in Euro.
[2:20:53.580 --> 2:20:58.580]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen. Bad news for US currency.
[2:20:58.580 --> 2:21:02.580]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar. Trading equals permanent loss.
[2:21:02.580 --> 2:21:05.580]  Dollars fall into 65% of Euro. Erosion accelerates.
[2:21:05.580 --> 2:21:09.580]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of US. Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[2:21:09.580 --> 2:21:12.580]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[2:21:12.580 --> 2:21:17.580]  Why attack Iran? Jerome O'Corsies. Iran leads attack against the US dollar document spells it out.

[2:21:35.580 --> 2:21:39.580]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[2:21:39.580 --> 2:21:43.580]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[2:21:43.580 --> 2:21:50.580]  Health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression, mood swings,
[2:21:50.580 --> 2:21:54.580]  speech disorders, neuropathy, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, and more.
[2:21:54.580 --> 2:22:00.580]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and potentially deadly toxins.
[2:22:00.580 --> 2:22:03.580]  That's why there's PuraClear from Ripple Creek.
[2:22:03.580 --> 2:22:09.580]  PuraClear contains a proprietary blend of ingredients including a cilantro extract and alphalipoic acid.

[2:24:19.580 --> 2:24:21.580]  I'm sorry.
[2:24:21.580 --> 2:24:30.580]  You know, people in America haven't been asked to sacrifice since World War II.
[2:24:30.580 --> 2:24:40.580]  We're a nation, and this is a district that's filled with such human talents and gifts and wealth.
[2:24:40.580 --> 2:24:45.580]  We have a history of being able to pull together when we have to pull together.
[2:24:45.580 --> 2:24:48.580]  But nobody's asking anybody to do this.
[2:24:48.580 --> 2:24:50.580]  Cindy, I've got an idea.
[2:24:50.580 --> 2:24:55.020]  If you guys are, commission says, Zogby poll, but don't let them add their questions.
[2:24:55.020 --> 2:24:56.020]  I've done polls before.
[2:24:56.020 --> 2:25:01.220]  Make it fair and just, you know, have it say Nancy Pelosi is, you know, basically said
[2:25:01.220 --> 2:25:05.180]  she wants to continue the, you know, the war.
[2:25:05.180 --> 2:25:11.700]  And Cindy Sheehan says that she wants to end the war and have a few questions like that.
[2:25:11.700 --> 2:25:14.680]  And then poll say 2000 San Franciscans.
[2:25:14.680 --> 2:25:16.460]  I think you're going to win that.
[2:25:16.460 --> 2:25:22.300]  And then you can use that to get a lot of media attention and show people that you can
[2:25:22.300 --> 2:25:23.300]  win.
[2:25:23.300 --> 2:25:24.300]  There's that.
[2:25:24.300 --> 2:25:27.020]  Actually, Alex, that's what we are working for right now.
[2:25:27.020 --> 2:25:32.860]  And we actually have to have about $20,000 to do that.
[2:25:32.860 --> 2:25:34.300]  So we're fundraising right now.
[2:25:34.300 --> 2:25:35.980]  Who told you it was 20,000?
[2:25:35.980 --> 2:25:39.140]  Who told you it was 20,000?
[2:25:39.140 --> 2:25:41.460]  Our political consultant.
[2:25:41.460 --> 2:25:44.220]  Well, I've done a few polls.
[2:25:44.220 --> 2:25:51.980]  I mean, you can just do a one off poll with Zogby or something for five, six grand.
[2:25:51.980 --> 2:25:54.100]  And then they'll ask almost to 3000 people.
[2:25:54.100 --> 2:25:55.100]  All right on.
[2:25:55.100 --> 2:25:58.900]  Well, we are, we definitely will check into that because that is something that we want
[2:25:58.900 --> 2:25:59.900]  to do.
[2:25:59.900 --> 2:26:04.900]  And we agree with you when a poll comes out and there have been some polls done here
[2:26:04.900 --> 2:26:10.460]  that haven't been like what they call a sampling, a good sampling.
[2:26:10.460 --> 2:26:15.620]  But I have overwhelmingly beaten Nancy Pelosi in those polls.
[2:26:15.620 --> 2:26:20.980]  So I think that that, like you said, would garner a lot of media attention, a lot of
[2:26:20.980 --> 2:26:21.980]  donations.
[2:26:21.980 --> 2:26:25.780]  Well, see, I didn't know you'd already been beating her in spot polls, which is common
[2:26:25.780 --> 2:26:26.780]  sense.
[2:26:26.780 --> 2:26:29.340]  You need to have those polls out ahead in case they cheat you.
[2:26:29.340 --> 2:26:33.140]  That'll be ammo in the recount or showing the machines are fraudulent to say, look,
[2:26:33.140 --> 2:26:34.340]  I won in this poll.
[2:26:34.340 --> 2:26:39.780]  But I mean, maybe your consultant may be getting sold and I'm not saying they're not a great
[2:26:39.780 --> 2:26:40.780]  consultant.
[2:26:40.780 --> 2:26:41.780]  I don't know who they are.
[2:26:41.780 --> 2:26:44.660]  Your consultant may be getting sold on larger, bigger packages.
[2:26:44.660 --> 2:26:46.660]  They try to sell you.
[2:26:46.660 --> 2:26:49.220]  But I'd call up Angus and Reed.
[2:26:49.220 --> 2:26:50.460]  I'd call up Mason Dixon.
[2:26:50.460 --> 2:26:51.700]  I'd call up Zogby.
[2:26:51.700 --> 2:26:53.260]  I'd spend five grand apiece.
[2:26:53.260 --> 2:26:58.660]  I'd get three different polls, but I would not let them insert their own questions.
[2:26:58.660 --> 2:27:02.500]  They are out of control, but make it fair so everybody can read the questions.
[2:27:02.500 --> 2:27:07.660]  When you put the press release out, Nancy Pelosi said that she went in the war and have a quote.
[2:27:07.660 --> 2:27:11.580]  She did not, she says, continue it.
[2:27:11.580 --> 2:27:17.660]  Cindy Sheehan says that, you know, elective, this is her plan to do it, on this issue,
[2:27:17.660 --> 2:27:18.660]  who would you vote for?
[2:27:18.660 --> 2:27:22.980]  Or with leaving issues out, people know the issues, say, who would you vote for?
[2:27:22.980 --> 2:27:25.940]  Nancy Pelosi or Cindy Sheehan?
[2:27:25.940 --> 2:27:28.900]  And you know, you were going to win that.
[2:27:28.900 --> 2:27:30.660]  My political gut tells me.
[2:27:30.660 --> 2:27:31.660]  And then you're going to have that tool.
[2:27:31.660 --> 2:27:32.820]  But I mean, I know you've got help.
[2:27:32.820 --> 2:27:33.820]  So I thought you...
[2:27:33.820 --> 2:27:38.820]  The only thing that we're battling here in San Francisco is the Democratic machine.
[2:27:38.820 --> 2:27:41.740]  You know, all the unions are endorsing Pelosi.
[2:27:41.740 --> 2:27:46.060]  The Democratic clubs, of course, are endorsing Pelosi.
[2:27:46.060 --> 2:27:47.540]  And so they're endorsing war now.
[2:27:47.540 --> 2:27:48.540]  Exactly.
[2:27:48.540 --> 2:27:55.140]  Even though her stance on the issues of war, accountability, the environment, labor, everything
[2:27:55.140 --> 2:28:02.060]  that these people hold dear are, you know, exactly opposite of what they believe that
[2:28:02.060 --> 2:28:06.140]  they're endorsing her, because it is just a big Democratic machine town.
[2:28:06.140 --> 2:28:09.980]  So we have to overcome that, and it has to be more issues-based.
[2:28:09.980 --> 2:28:14.100]  And again, you have that ruling order where you've got 90-plus percent against the war.
[2:28:14.100 --> 2:28:18.060]  Everybody loves you in San Francisco, but the machine loves the power.
[2:28:18.060 --> 2:28:19.060]  Right.
[2:28:19.060 --> 2:28:20.060]  Then it just...
[2:28:20.060 --> 2:28:22.900]  You know, the machine just exists to perpetuate itself.
[2:28:22.900 --> 2:28:28.100]  And they'll run over anybody who gets in its way, even somebody that does have integrity
[2:28:28.100 --> 2:28:33.540]  and courage, and who is right on all the issues that San Francisco cares about.
[2:28:33.540 --> 2:28:35.820]  And Nancy Pelosi is wrong on all of those issues.
[2:28:35.820 --> 2:28:41.740]  So that's what we have to have the money to be able to get out to the 8th district.
[2:28:41.740 --> 2:28:45.980]  But like I said, there's just people pouring in from all over to help us.
[2:28:45.980 --> 2:28:47.980]  We have to expand our campaign.
[2:28:47.980 --> 2:28:49.980]  We can't fit in this office anymore.
[2:28:49.980 --> 2:28:50.980]  Thank God.
[2:28:50.980 --> 2:28:56.820]  It's just becoming a real enthusiastic, energetic, committed people are quitting their jobs to
[2:28:56.820 --> 2:28:58.580]  work on this campaign.
[2:28:58.580 --> 2:29:00.900]  People are moving to San Francisco to work on my campaign.
[2:29:00.900 --> 2:29:04.940]  Cindy, can you do 10 more minutes with us so we can take a few calls and also tell folks
[2:29:04.940 --> 2:29:05.940]  how they can donate?
[2:29:05.940 --> 2:29:06.940]  Sure, absolutely.
[2:29:06.940 --> 2:29:10.460]  Okay, we're going to come back and take a few calls specifically for Cindy Sheehan
[2:29:10.460 --> 2:29:15.740]  about her campaign or about the larger election, 1-800-259-9231.
[2:29:15.740 --> 2:29:19.740]  Stay with us.
[2:29:19.740 --> 2:29:20.740]  We're on the march.
[2:29:20.740 --> 2:29:25.100]  Okay, Cindy, we're going to be back in about about three minutes, okay?
[2:29:25.100 --> 2:29:26.100]  Alrighty.
[2:29:26.100 --> 2:29:27.100]  Thank you.
[2:29:27.100 --> 2:29:28.100]  You bet.
[2:29:28.100 --> 2:29:29.100]  John Harmon.
[2:29:29.100 --> 2:29:30.100]  Hey, Alex.
[2:29:30.100 --> 2:29:31.100]  Yes.
[2:29:31.100 --> 2:29:39.100]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[2:29:39.100 --> 2:29:42.980]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[2:29:42.980 --> 2:29:48.260]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[2:29:48.260 --> 2:29:50.100]  to tell their story.
[2:29:50.100 --> 2:29:58.860]  This film and EVA director on the AT made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:29:58.860 --> 2:30:03.620]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world
[2:30:03.620 --> 2:30:05.900]  take action against their global masters.
[2:30:05.900 --> 2:30:09.060]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:30:09.060 --> 2:30:13.860]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom,
[2:30:13.860 --> 2:30:14.860]  boom.
[2:30:14.860 --> 2:30:21.780]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide, download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and
[2:30:21.780 --> 2:30:26.900]  aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:30:26.900 --> 2:30:30.580]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[2:30:30.580 --> 2:30:33.180]  and bring in martial law.
[2:30:33.180 --> 2:30:36.460]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[2:30:36.460 --> 2:30:38.900]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[2:30:38.900 --> 2:30:44.220]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel and today I gave a killer presentation
[2:30:44.220 --> 2:30:45.220]  in Sydney.
[2:30:45.220 --> 2:30:50.020]  Finalize the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston, online from my
[2:30:50.020 --> 2:30:52.020]  desk with WebEx.
[2:30:52.020 --> 2:30:54.900]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[2:30:54.900 --> 2:30:58.820]  I just talked to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from
[2:30:58.820 --> 2:31:03.940]  their desktop so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[2:31:33.220 --> 2:31:38.180]  High fuel prices for gasoline and diesel are taking a huge bite out of budgets for individuals
[2:31:38.180 --> 2:31:41.420]  and businesses, but there is something you can do.
[2:31:41.420 --> 2:31:45.780]  Fuel Saver Incorporated's fuel enhancer formula will not only stretch each gallon of fuel
[2:31:45.780 --> 2:31:50.220]  further for mere pennies per treated gallon, but also cleans fuel injectors, pumps and
[2:31:50.220 --> 2:31:51.660]  reduces emissions.
[2:31:51.660 --> 2:31:56.780]  Average improvement in fuel economy typically ranges from 8 to 20 percent or more, saving
[2:31:56.780 --> 2:32:00.300]  you 30 to 80 cents on each gallon of fuel at the pump.
[2:32:00.300 --> 2:32:02.020]  Now there's a boost for your budget.
[2:32:02.020 --> 2:32:06.620]  Fuel Saver Incorporated's product is completely safe for your vehicle, gas or diesel.

[2:32:30.660 --> 2:32:37.660]  We're saving on fuel today.
[2:33:28.500 --> 2:33:30.500]  We have Cindy Sheehan back on.
[2:33:30.500 --> 2:33:31.500]  Sheehan with us.
[2:33:31.500 --> 2:33:37.260]  Folks, you can call us on our local lines, we'll be with us about 10, 15 more minutes
[2:33:37.260 --> 2:33:42.860]  this segment for questions about the campaign, about the two parties, about how once you
[2:33:42.860 --> 2:33:48.580]  get off their skin color or their sexual gender, there's really no separation.
[2:33:48.580 --> 2:33:51.580]  It's just different flavors of the same corporate lives.
[2:33:51.580 --> 2:33:56.740]  888-201-2244 is the number here in my studio.
[2:33:56.740 --> 2:34:06.020]  888-201-2244-888-201-2244 and we'll take a few calls for Cindy Sheehan.
[2:34:06.020 --> 2:34:10.180]  Sheehan, before we run out of time, how do people help the historic campaign?
[2:34:10.180 --> 2:34:13.500]  I want to add, 50-something days away from the election.
[2:34:13.500 --> 2:34:15.500]  Absolutely, 49 days.
[2:34:15.500 --> 2:34:16.500]  Wow.
[2:34:16.500 --> 2:34:22.980]  I've been thinking 50 so long, 49 days, there's so many and even if you lose, it'll expose
[2:34:22.980 --> 2:34:24.380]  the voting machines.
[2:34:24.380 --> 2:34:28.460]  You will educate people, you will show how both parties are controlled, it's all part
[2:34:28.460 --> 2:34:29.460]  of the fight.
[2:34:29.460 --> 2:34:35.300]  If we don't stand up, we don't build movements and the two parties have a 9% approval rating,
[2:34:35.300 --> 2:34:36.740]  they're being discredited.
[2:34:36.740 --> 2:34:41.220]  This is an important process and that's why I just thank you for what you've done standing
[2:34:41.220 --> 2:34:44.980]  up to these people just in a dogged fashion.
[2:34:44.980 --> 2:34:51.140]  So what's the different basket of tactics and things listeners can do to help you?
[2:34:51.140 --> 2:34:58.860]  Well, we're downloading the voter rolls onto Google Docs and they'll be able to go into
[2:34:58.860 --> 2:35:04.900]  our website and pull out a list of maybe 10 voters in San Francisco that they can phone
[2:35:04.900 --> 2:35:10.580]  bank or they can send messages to, things like that that aren't very expensive that
[2:35:10.580 --> 2:35:13.380]  people from around the country can do.
[2:35:13.380 --> 2:35:20.980]  We will be here in San Francisco doing a lot of phone banking, a lot of door-to-door contact
[2:35:20.980 --> 2:35:21.980]  with voters.
[2:35:21.980 --> 2:35:30.420]  And like I said, anybody can go on our website Cindyforcongress.org, CindyFORcongress.org
[2:35:30.420 --> 2:35:34.260]  and just donate anything that you can.
[2:35:34.260 --> 2:35:39.180]  Our campaign is supported by total grassroots donations.
[2:35:39.180 --> 2:35:48.500]  We haven't received or taken one PAC contribution, one corporate contribution and we've raised
[2:35:48.500 --> 2:35:51.060]  over $400,000 so far.
[2:35:51.060 --> 2:35:57.180]  And if we could just have $100,000 more between now and November 4th, we would really be able
[2:35:57.180 --> 2:35:59.500]  to blanket this city with our message.
[2:35:59.500 --> 2:36:04.500]  Well, I would also keep a little bit back for lawyers and the force of it.
[2:36:04.500 --> 2:36:05.500]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:36:05.500 --> 2:36:06.500]  We're on election day.
[2:36:06.500 --> 2:36:14.220]  We're all about election protection and about getting lawyers right there to challenge the
[2:36:14.220 --> 2:36:18.580]  vote because you know, like we said, the system just exists to perpetuate it.
[2:36:18.580 --> 2:36:20.380]  And it's not like we're firing blanks.
[2:36:20.380 --> 2:36:26.380]  People have gone to prison in Ohio and other states for stealing elections but unlike these
[2:36:26.380 --> 2:36:30.580]  rigged elections, you're not like some of the people we've seen in the past who will
[2:36:30.580 --> 2:36:31.580]  stand down.
[2:36:31.580 --> 2:36:35.700]  Oh heck no, we're going to fight for every last vote to make sure every vote is counted
[2:36:35.700 --> 2:36:42.980]  properly, to challenge the voting system and this election, you know, won't be over
[2:36:42.980 --> 2:36:48.580]  one way or the other on November 4th, like you said, where if it turns out that, you
[2:36:48.580 --> 2:36:52.620]  know, somehow Nancy Pelosi got more votes than us, we will challenge every vote.
[2:36:52.620 --> 2:36:53.620]  We will challenge that.
[2:36:53.620 --> 2:36:58.980]  We have a hotline for people to call if there's any kind of voter suppression or voter fraud
[2:36:58.980 --> 2:37:00.980]  or any kind of hanky-panky.
[2:37:00.980 --> 2:37:07.100]  I have seen myself on the voter rolls at the Department of Elections how they scrub people
[2:37:07.100 --> 2:37:08.860]  off the voter rolls.
[2:37:08.860 --> 2:37:17.580]  So we also have to do a lot of voter registration and a lot of education about the right to
[2:37:17.580 --> 2:37:19.700]  vote and the right to have your vote counted.
[2:37:19.700 --> 2:37:20.700]  Absolutely, folks.
[2:37:20.700 --> 2:37:21.700]  Do not procrastinate.
[2:37:21.700 --> 2:37:22.700]  Donate now.
[2:37:22.700 --> 2:37:26.700]  If you live in California or somewhere else, go door-to-door now.
[2:37:26.700 --> 2:37:28.500]  We have to punish Nancy Pelosi.
[2:37:28.500 --> 2:37:33.300]  I mean, if we reward somebody, it's not much of a reward, it'll be torture for up in Congress.
[2:37:33.300 --> 2:37:38.340]  But to send this great patriot up there who will ring the alarm bells and ask the serious
[2:37:38.340 --> 2:37:39.340]  questions and send again.
[2:37:39.340 --> 2:37:44.100]  I know you're going to be busy, but election day and the day after, whatever happens, please
[2:37:44.100 --> 2:37:49.540]  tell your folks to put you in for this show so that we can have that, you know, as that
[2:37:49.540 --> 2:37:50.900]  breaks whatever's happened.
[2:37:50.900 --> 2:37:51.900]  But again...
[2:37:51.900 --> 2:37:52.900]  Well, of course, absolutely.
[2:37:52.900 --> 2:37:56.420]  I mean, as you said, though, you are winning in the little polls they're doing locally,
[2:37:56.420 --> 2:37:58.780]  which of course is common sense.
[2:37:58.780 --> 2:38:00.820]  If you don't win, there is definitely fraud.
[2:38:00.820 --> 2:38:02.900]  You already have name recognition.
[2:38:02.900 --> 2:38:05.820]  You are her worst nightmare.
[2:38:05.820 --> 2:38:09.220]  And as this all...I mean, what word are you getting on the street?
[2:38:09.220 --> 2:38:10.220]  What are people saying?
[2:38:10.220 --> 2:38:20.020]  Well, actually, the energy and the positive responses have been overwhelming since we
[2:38:20.020 --> 2:38:21.300]  got on the ballot.
[2:38:21.300 --> 2:38:26.620]  People really recognize that this is a serious campaign and that it is a campaign for the
[2:38:26.620 --> 2:38:29.660]  people and not for the corporate elite.
[2:38:29.660 --> 2:38:34.300]  And we have been able to hire more staff that get out there.
[2:38:34.300 --> 2:38:39.380]  And when I get out there, of course, it's overwhelmingly positive, but they have...they're
[2:38:39.380 --> 2:38:45.300]  hearing very few negative comments and they're able to talk with people who say, well, you
[2:38:45.300 --> 2:38:49.100]  know, I still support Nancy, you know, she's not doing that bad of a job or she's doing
[2:38:49.100 --> 2:38:50.100]  the best she can.
[2:38:50.100 --> 2:38:55.340]  And when we educate people and are able to talk to them, they change their minds and
[2:38:55.340 --> 2:38:56.900]  they say that they're going to vote for me.
[2:38:56.900 --> 2:38:58.900]  So the word on the street is very positive.
[2:38:58.900 --> 2:39:08.820]  And of course, like I said, we're battling this almost undefeatable machine here in San
[2:39:08.820 --> 2:39:17.340]  Francisco, but it's not like I am just Sarah Smith running against Joe Jones in Montana.
[2:39:17.340 --> 2:39:19.980]  This is Cindy Sheehan running against Nancy Pelosi.
[2:39:19.980 --> 2:39:25.700]  This is Cindy Sheehan, you know, the voice of the people running against the speaker
[2:39:25.700 --> 2:39:26.700]  of the House.
[2:39:26.700 --> 2:39:33.220]  Cindy Sheehan, I think that this will fundamentally put a wound in the system.
[2:39:33.220 --> 2:39:38.340]  And everybody in Congress, when we beat Nancy Pelosi, when we beat her, not me, when we
[2:39:38.340 --> 2:39:43.460]  beat her, everybody in Congress is going to say, whoa, our jobs are now performance-based
[2:39:43.460 --> 2:39:48.220]  and we're going to have to be responsive to our constituents, not our corporate lobbyists.
[2:39:48.220 --> 2:39:54.020]  Well, it's a true David versus Goliath scenario.
[2:39:54.020 --> 2:39:58.660]  And it shows how controlled the corporate media is and the good job they're doing, keeping
[2:39:58.660 --> 2:40:03.780]  the people uninformed, that a lot of people in San Francisco wouldn't know that Pelosi
[2:40:03.780 --> 2:40:07.260]  was supporting the war and her statements and her votes and her actions.
[2:40:07.260 --> 2:40:08.260]  But you're right.
[2:40:08.260 --> 2:40:12.340]  As soon as the facts are presented, you even get those that weren't supporting you.
[2:40:12.340 --> 2:40:15.500]  So it's all a fight here to get the word out.
[2:40:15.500 --> 2:40:16.900]  Give us the phone number.
[2:40:16.900 --> 2:40:17.900]  People can call and donate.
[2:40:17.900 --> 2:40:18.900]  Give us the website.
[2:40:18.900 --> 2:40:26.900]  Okay, it's 415-621-5027, and our website is CindyFORcongress.org.
[2:40:26.900 --> 2:40:32.220]  All right, I want to go ahead and take some phone calls.
[2:40:32.220 --> 2:40:36.660]  But before we do that, give the number out again slowly, give the web address out again
[2:40:36.660 --> 2:40:37.660]  for folks.
[2:40:37.660 --> 2:40:47.620]  Okay, 415-621-5027, and the website is CindyFORcongress.org.
[2:40:47.620 --> 2:40:53.380]  CindyFORcongress.org, and listeners, whether she wins, loses, draws, it doesn't matter.
[2:40:53.380 --> 2:40:55.620]  We win by fighting back.
[2:40:55.620 --> 2:40:56.620]  We win.
[2:40:56.620 --> 2:40:58.460]  So when wins the situation for the people?
[2:40:58.460 --> 2:41:02.580]  Well, there's some people on YouTube that edit together my show to make it sound like
[2:41:02.580 --> 2:41:06.300]  I'm being incongruent or engaging in doublespeak.
[2:41:06.300 --> 2:41:10.740]  You know, I talk about election fraud, I talk about rigged voting machines, and then I say,
[2:41:10.740 --> 2:41:14.460]  go out and vote, go out and be involved, go out and poll watch.
[2:41:14.460 --> 2:41:18.940]  I'm saying don't let them take our process and don't go quietly into the night and go
[2:41:18.940 --> 2:41:21.500]  out there everywhere you can and expose this.
[2:41:21.500 --> 2:41:23.660]  We've sent a bunch of people to prison.
[2:41:23.660 --> 2:41:27.580]  The American people in like seven, eight years, I've seen the polls, have gone from
[2:41:27.580 --> 2:41:32.540]  maybe 10% knowing there's election fraud to over 90% in national polls.
[2:41:32.540 --> 2:41:36.500]  People know about Daibold, they know about Sequoia, they know about heart and her civics.
[2:41:36.500 --> 2:41:37.940]  They know now.
[2:41:37.940 --> 2:41:40.100]  People are going to jail.
[2:41:40.100 --> 2:41:42.460]  We're winning that fight too.
[2:41:42.460 --> 2:41:46.340]  More of their executives are going public, more of their programmers are going public.
[2:41:46.340 --> 2:41:49.340]  You know, I'm saying, be involved, vote, get involved.
[2:41:49.340 --> 2:41:54.420]  Well, I never thought that I would run for Congress or any elective office because of
[2:41:54.420 --> 2:42:03.180]  all of these, you know, challenges that you bring up, but if we just give up and say that
[2:42:03.180 --> 2:42:06.140]  they won, then they have won.
[2:42:06.140 --> 2:42:08.780]  And we can't let them do that.
[2:42:08.780 --> 2:42:13.940]  And like, like I said before, our voices, they can't silence our voices no matter how
[2:42:13.940 --> 2:42:14.940]  hard they try.
[2:42:14.940 --> 2:42:22.140]  So I just think that you, by saying that just give up and don't go vote, don't be involved
[2:42:22.140 --> 2:42:23.140]  in the process.
[2:42:23.140 --> 2:42:28.140]  Don't do this, don't do that, you're just saying that it's fine than the neocons have
[2:42:28.140 --> 2:42:29.140]  won.
[2:42:29.140 --> 2:42:30.140]  Absolutely.
[2:42:30.140 --> 2:42:33.420]  We've only got about six, seven minutes left with you.
[2:42:33.420 --> 2:42:35.260]  Let's take some phone calls.
[2:42:35.260 --> 2:42:39.420]  John in Oklahoma, you're on the air with Cindy Sheehan.
[2:42:39.420 --> 2:42:41.140]  Hello, Cindy.
[2:42:41.140 --> 2:42:42.620]  Hello, John.
[2:42:42.620 --> 2:42:48.660]  Um, this is not maybe not pertinent to your particular race, but it was something that
[2:42:48.660 --> 2:42:55.860]  I noticed about the Barack Obama and uh, the Hareley Clinton, when they were running together
[2:42:55.860 --> 2:42:58.660]  it was about six or nine months, eight months ago.
[2:42:58.660 --> 2:43:00.140]  You mean running against each other?
[2:43:00.140 --> 2:43:01.140]  Yeah.
[2:43:01.140 --> 2:43:07.140]  When they took that drink, when they were all taking the drink, Hillary was like, whew.
[2:43:07.140 --> 2:43:08.140]  Yeah.
[2:43:08.140 --> 2:43:11.300]  Is this all I got to do to be president?
[2:43:11.300 --> 2:43:19.900]  And Barack Obama was like, if you look at the film photos, I mean, I'm sure you guys,
[2:43:19.900 --> 2:43:21.900]  you guys are a lot smarter than I could ever be.
[2:43:21.900 --> 2:43:22.900]  No, I'm, no we're not.
[2:43:22.900 --> 2:43:24.020]  In fact, I don't know what you're talking about.
[2:43:24.020 --> 2:43:29.860]  Well, when they took, when Barack Obama took that drink of wine, it barely touched his
[2:43:29.860 --> 2:43:30.860]  lips.
[2:43:30.860 --> 2:43:37.780]  I believe he is a closet Muslim and he's just hiding, hiding under, isn't there something
[2:43:37.780 --> 2:43:39.700]  in the Koran about?
[2:43:39.700 --> 2:43:43.860]  Yeah, when you're in amongst the quote enemies, keep yourself at low, let's not appreciate
[2:43:43.860 --> 2:43:44.860]  your call.
[2:43:44.860 --> 2:43:51.180]  Um, it doesn't matter, you know, we hear all this talk, he is bought and paid for by powerful
[2:43:51.180 --> 2:43:52.420]  corporate interest.
[2:43:52.420 --> 2:43:59.140]  The president is a puppet now, uh, under the COG system, uh, to say, you know, to get
[2:43:59.140 --> 2:44:03.300]  into him being a Muslim, to get into him not being, to get into him this or that.
[2:44:03.300 --> 2:44:04.300]  It doesn't matter.
[2:44:04.300 --> 2:44:07.540]  He's bought and paid for by the global corporate interest.
[2:44:07.540 --> 2:44:09.900]  And you know, to get involved, well, McCain's bad.
[2:44:09.900 --> 2:44:13.660]  We better vote for him because, because we can't trust Barack Obama.
[2:44:13.660 --> 2:44:15.260]  It doesn't matter.
[2:44:15.260 --> 2:44:21.380]  We have to stop being fooled into, into believing that these people aren't, aren't corporate
[2:44:21.380 --> 2:44:22.380]  stuges.
[2:44:22.380 --> 2:44:23.380]  Uh, Cindy?
[2:44:23.380 --> 2:44:24.380]  Well, I agree with you.
[2:44:24.380 --> 2:44:28.460]  It doesn't matter if Barack Obama is a Muslim or not, and if he is, he sure does a good
[2:44:28.460 --> 2:44:34.700]  job of hiding it or being in the, in the closet because he sure has been, um, very vocal in
[2:44:34.700 --> 2:44:39.700]  support of Israel and, you know, taking down Muslim countries for Israel.
[2:44:39.700 --> 2:44:44.820]  So, you know, I think that even if he was a Muslim, it wouldn't have, you know, wouldn't
[2:44:44.820 --> 2:44:45.820]  make that much difference.
[2:44:45.820 --> 2:44:47.940]  It's not supposed to make a difference.
[2:44:47.940 --> 2:44:53.100]  You know, I wish that we didn't hear about religion and politics that we're not voting
[2:44:53.100 --> 2:44:57.500]  for the Pope of America, we're voting for the president of America, and it doesn't
[2:44:57.500 --> 2:45:03.340]  really matter to me, and it shouldn't matter to, matter to other people what religion anybody
[2:45:03.340 --> 2:45:04.340]  is.
[2:45:04.340 --> 2:45:07.300]  Well, I agree with you.
[2:45:07.300 --> 2:45:15.380]  They just use that as a political football, just a wedge issue and if Palin was totally
[2:45:15.380 --> 2:45:25.060]  just to pander to the religious right in this country who, um, don't, you know, the
[2:45:25.060 --> 2:45:30.340]  Jesus that I grew up and then grow to know it's nothing like that.
[2:45:30.340 --> 2:45:34.340]  Well, look, I mean, it's, it's, it's a fraud as well.
[2:45:34.340 --> 2:45:40.500]  I mean, if this should insult Christian conservatives, uh, you know, the fact is McCain isn't for
[2:45:40.500 --> 2:45:49.140]  the issues they want, and so all they're doing here, uh, is, as you said, just, just, just
[2:45:49.140 --> 2:45:55.100]  using her to add some novelty, oh, she's a woman, oh, she's Christian, oh, she's, you
[2:45:55.100 --> 2:45:58.820]  know, she's, uh, a pro-gun and you're absolutely right.
[2:45:58.820 --> 2:46:05.820]  It is nothing but an attempt to sucker conservatives back to the table.
[2:46:05.820 --> 2:46:06.820]  Let's take another call.
[2:46:06.820 --> 2:46:11.060]  Let's talk to, uh, Michael in Ohio, Michael, you're on the air.
[2:46:11.060 --> 2:46:12.060]  Welcome.
[2:46:12.060 --> 2:46:13.060]  Yeah.
[2:46:13.060 --> 2:46:14.060]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:46:14.060 --> 2:46:15.060]  And hello, Cindy.
[2:46:15.060 --> 2:46:16.060]  And Cindy for president and one too.
[2:46:16.060 --> 2:46:17.060]  How's that?
[2:46:17.060 --> 2:46:22.540]  Uh, Cindy, I just wanted to, in fact, uh, I've been battling something called chemtrails
[2:46:22.540 --> 2:46:24.940]  for many, many, many, many years.
[2:46:24.940 --> 2:46:31.100]  Um, I've been on all radio shows and been on Alex's yet, but he knows a lot about them.
[2:46:31.100 --> 2:46:36.540]  And the thing with the chemtrails in the Bay Area in California, transins all the politicking.
[2:46:36.540 --> 2:46:37.540]  Yeah.
[2:46:37.540 --> 2:46:39.340]  Remember when Arnold wanted to spray the pesticides?
[2:46:39.340 --> 2:46:40.340]  Yeah.
[2:46:40.340 --> 2:46:45.020]  The brown apple malt butterfly, that is a nice assignee, extremely toxic, but Pelosi in
[2:46:45.020 --> 2:46:49.340]  fact and all the other people out there that in fact are supposed to be our elected officials
[2:46:49.340 --> 2:46:52.780]  ignore this, this particular issue, transins all of it.
[2:46:52.780 --> 2:46:53.780]  Yeah.
[2:46:53.780 --> 2:46:56.980]  What he's bringing up is what Cassinage, uh, wrote about in a bill, I think six years
[2:46:56.980 --> 2:47:02.300]  ago, the declassified weather modification and other classified programs.
[2:47:02.300 --> 2:47:06.100]  What would you do in Congress, uh, to look into that, Cindy?
[2:47:06.100 --> 2:47:08.380]  Oh, we lost her.
[2:47:08.380 --> 2:47:10.140]  That's, that's why we lost her earlier.
[2:47:10.140 --> 2:47:11.140]  That's strange.
[2:47:11.140 --> 2:47:12.140]  Yeah.
[2:47:12.140 --> 2:47:13.140]  I was going to tell her about something that I wrote in.
[2:47:13.140 --> 2:47:17.620]  Our phone systems are fun, let me tell you, uh, in this new studio, man, I want as many
[2:47:17.620 --> 2:47:22.900]  backups as possible because this internet phone business is not the way to go.
[2:47:22.900 --> 2:47:26.540]  See, we have regular phone lines here, but not enough to take your calls and have Cindy
[2:47:26.540 --> 2:47:27.540]  on.
[2:47:27.540 --> 2:47:28.540]  They're not friends.
[2:47:28.540 --> 2:47:34.380]  Uh, and, and so what we're, so, so then we have people, uh, on, on IP phones to call
[2:47:34.380 --> 2:47:39.860]  into the show and, and Genesis is doing something similar and it just needs to stop.
[2:47:39.860 --> 2:47:41.380]  It just doesn't work.
[2:47:41.380 --> 2:47:44.660]  It, it, it, it, it, it, it, it isn't backed up enough.
[2:47:44.660 --> 2:47:50.380]  That's why other major radio networks still use landlines, uh, because they sound better.
[2:47:50.380 --> 2:47:51.380]  They work better.
[2:47:51.380 --> 2:47:52.380]  They are better.
[2:47:52.380 --> 2:47:56.540]  It, you know, it's been figured out, uh, and so by the way, I want that in the new studio.
[2:47:56.540 --> 2:48:01.620]  I want a five regular line back up in my studio and I'll just take more and more over myself.
[2:48:01.620 --> 2:48:07.700]  Uh, but we'll just say by to Cindy, uh, right now and let you go to send me your info, send
[2:48:07.700 --> 2:48:13.020]  it to tray at info wars.com, um, say your name is Dr. Michael Castle.
[2:48:13.020 --> 2:48:14.020]  Yes.
[2:48:14.020 --> 2:48:15.020]  So just send that over.
[2:48:15.020 --> 2:48:16.020]  Thanks for the call.
[2:48:16.020 --> 2:48:17.020]  Thanks.
[2:48:17.020 --> 2:48:18.020]  Uh, you bet.
[2:48:18.020 --> 2:48:19.020]  Take care.
[2:48:19.020 --> 2:48:22.220]  Uh, but, uh, look, we had Cindy, she in on and, uh, that's what matters and that's a
[2:48:22.220 --> 2:48:23.220]  done deal.
[2:48:23.220 --> 2:48:28.340]  Now let's go ahead and take another call here from, uh, Leo in mass, Leo, you're on the
[2:48:28.340 --> 2:48:29.340]  air.
[2:48:29.340 --> 2:48:30.340]  Go ahead.
[2:48:30.340 --> 2:48:31.340]  Howdy.
[2:48:31.340 --> 2:48:32.340]  Uh, is Cindy still there?
[2:48:32.340 --> 2:48:33.340]  No, she's not.
[2:48:33.340 --> 2:48:34.340]  Okay.
[2:48:34.340 --> 2:48:38.300]  I think that the, uh, people calling in from the outside is the most dangerous thing she
[2:48:38.300 --> 2:48:39.860]  could ever do.
[2:48:39.860 --> 2:48:44.020]  That's really like, like curtains because you don't have any control over who's doing
[2:48:44.020 --> 2:48:45.580]  the calling.
[2:48:45.580 --> 2:48:49.220]  So get back to her and make sure that she doesn't do that.
[2:48:49.220 --> 2:48:50.220]  What are you talking about?
[2:48:50.220 --> 2:48:57.140]  Cindy was talking about having people calling in to the people, to the prospective voters
[2:48:57.140 --> 2:49:01.180]  and doing it in an unregulated atmosphere is the most dangerous thing you can do and
[2:49:01.180 --> 2:49:03.060]  letting people do things on their own.
[2:49:03.060 --> 2:49:09.980]  Well, a lot of political parties will, uh, act like they are phone bank, uh, volunteers
[2:49:09.980 --> 2:49:12.660]  and call up and say horrible things to people.
[2:49:12.660 --> 2:49:14.020]  That's some dirty tricks.
[2:49:14.020 --> 2:49:18.780]  Uh, but, uh, you know, I, I think things should be under unregulated.
[2:49:18.780 --> 2:49:21.500]  Well, I mean, it's people are allowed to call who they want.
[2:49:21.500 --> 2:49:23.500]  They're allowed to pamphleteer who they want.
[2:49:23.500 --> 2:49:29.180]  It's that it's that bottom up structure that unregulated system, uh, that has been so
[2:49:29.180 --> 2:49:32.620]  successful, uh, throughout history.
[2:49:32.620 --> 2:49:40.500]  So, uh, you know, I mean, it's, it's even worse to have only a top down integration,
[2:49:40.500 --> 2:49:41.500]  vertical integration.
[2:49:41.500 --> 2:49:44.780]  Oh, anyway, uh, hey, do me a big favor.
[2:49:44.780 --> 2:49:48.740]  If you want to be on this show, will you turn off whatever radio or TV show that is on the
[2:49:48.740 --> 2:49:49.740]  background?
[2:49:49.740 --> 2:49:50.740]  Oh yeah.
[2:49:50.740 --> 2:49:51.740]  Right.
[2:49:51.740 --> 2:49:52.740]  Okay.
[2:49:52.740 --> 2:49:53.740]  It's off.
[2:49:53.740 --> 2:49:55.980]  I'm going to let you go.
[2:49:55.980 --> 2:49:57.700]  I appreciate your call.
[2:49:57.700 --> 2:50:05.580]  It's just too noisy in the background as it wasn't off, um, we're going to come back
[2:50:05.580 --> 2:50:08.980]  and I'm going to have open phones throughout the show, more of the economic news, a bunch
[2:50:08.980 --> 2:50:16.300]  of big military developments to between Israel and Iran, the U S, um, we're going to cover
[2:50:16.300 --> 2:50:26.020]  all that and then get back into your calls at 888-201-2244-888-201-2244.
[2:50:26.020 --> 2:50:30.420]  We're on TV in here and there's a fly flying around, they're giving me a fly swatter.
[2:50:30.420 --> 2:50:34.980]  Cameras are everywhere above stoplights on toll booths and scanning the freeways just
[2:50:34.980 --> 2:50:40.060]  waiting to snap a photo of your license plate only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[2:50:40.060 --> 2:50:43.780]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400.
[2:50:43.780 --> 2:50:48.380]  Spray your plate is a spray on photo blocker that protects against all types of cameras.
[2:50:48.380 --> 2:50:53.100]  Spray your plate photo blocker spray reflects and protects against flash photo images making
[2:50:53.100 --> 2:50:54.780]  your plate unreadable.
[2:50:54.780 --> 2:50:59.860]  One can of photo blocker will pay for itself many times over, last forever and is completely
[2:50:59.860 --> 2:51:00.860]  undetectable.
[2:51:00.860 --> 2:51:05.220]  You cannot afford to not be protected with spray your plate photo blocker.

[2:51:26.860 --> 2:51:29.940]  Don't give your money to the state, spray your plate.
[2:51:29.940 --> 2:51:35.180]  The day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:51:35.180 --> 2:51:36.660]  against this country.
[2:51:36.660 --> 2:51:38.860]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:51:38.860 --> 2:51:40.860]  But who is the enemy?
[2:51:40.860 --> 2:51:41.860]  Bin Laden.
[2:51:41.860 --> 2:51:42.860]  This is his MO.
[2:51:42.860 --> 2:51:46.220]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:51:46.220 --> 2:51:50.660]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:51:50.660 --> 2:51:53.240]  networks inside the United States.
[2:51:53.240 --> 2:51:57.700]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:51:57.700 --> 2:51:59.860]  in and on the US.
[2:51:59.860 --> 2:52:03.580]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:03.580 --> 2:52:09.020]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:09.020 --> 2:52:13.180]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and much,
[2:52:13.180 --> 2:52:14.180]  much more.

[2:52:31.180 --> 2:52:35.180]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?

[2:53:31.180 --> 2:53:32.180]  Answer.
[2:53:32.180 --> 2:53:33.180]  Answer.
[2:53:36.020 --> 2:53:40.300]  You really can't make things up like this Reuters
[2:53:41.940 --> 2:53:43.940]  City uses DNA
[2:53:44.980 --> 2:53:46.980]  To fight dog poop
[2:53:48.420 --> 2:53:50.700]  There's 2,000 dead on the Texas border
[2:53:51.580 --> 2:53:54.080]  In the first nine months of 2008
[2:53:54.820 --> 2:53:58.460]  Rocket attacks truck bombs going off police and being killed
[2:53:58.460 --> 2:54:05.980]  There is a literal drug war raging between the CIA and other drug cartels to control the narcotics
[2:54:07.220 --> 2:54:12.860]  No one knows about it. Literally 99% of the public have no idea. I mean, it's worse than Iraq
[2:54:15.020 --> 2:54:20.140]  We're into like year number five of this but it's getting worse and cities are going around
[2:54:20.140 --> 2:54:31.280]  To bus people's dogs who are pooping in the park and not being cleaned up with DNA going after the animal
[2:54:31.780 --> 2:54:33.780]  We're gonna talk about that
[2:54:35.340 --> 2:54:39.420]  I've got a bunch of other news Georgia is still claiming Russia's snuck attack them
[2:54:39.860 --> 2:54:45.580]  The New York Times is acting like it's serious and has some weight and you read the evidence that it isn't evidence
[2:54:45.580 --> 2:54:48.660]  Ukraine's government falls apart
[2:54:49.060 --> 2:54:54.300]  Cheney goes to Ukraine and says stick behind us. Don't worry about the Russians and their government falls apart
[2:54:54.620 --> 2:54:57.180]  Basically a pro-russian grids pretty close to taking it over
[2:54:59.340 --> 2:55:05.500]  So the elite is not omnipresent they're not all powerful they're trying to be with this casual society
[2:55:06.420 --> 2:55:08.420]  technological straightjacket
[2:55:08.420 --> 2:55:14.460]  Technological dehumanization grid that they're putting into place and
[2:55:16.140 --> 2:55:18.140]  It's Pentagon designed for that
[2:55:19.300 --> 2:55:22.860]  But if we say no to it now, there's no way they'll get away with it
[2:55:24.660 --> 2:55:29.940]  Also Israel's waging secret war with Iran and then stuff like this
[2:55:29.940 --> 2:55:39.660]  Teach the pleasure of gay sex to children as young as five say researchers. How about you don't teach anything about sex to children?
[2:55:40.540 --> 2:55:48.020]  Because perverts always want to do this as an excuse to get involved with your children sex education is about eugenics
[2:55:48.180 --> 2:55:53.180]  It's about teaching children that having children is bad that sex is somehow bad
[2:55:53.700 --> 2:55:58.100]  That marriage is stupid that abstinence is stupid so they can corrupt them
[2:55:58.100 --> 2:56:04.820]  I mean they want to teach second third fourth graders about things that I didn't know about till I was 12 or 13 and then that destroys
[2:56:04.820 --> 2:56:08.060]  Their innocence and sexualizes them. They've got studies
[2:56:08.780 --> 2:56:14.820]  In Europe and the US where you put up anti smoking billboards and smoking gets worse people
[2:56:15.700 --> 2:56:17.700]  Think it's rebellious. They want to do it
[2:56:18.180 --> 2:56:25.580]  They're also introduced to it federally funded since 1990 death education in schools has radically hundreds of percentile points
[2:56:25.580 --> 2:56:29.060]  It's incredible. Go look it up for yourself different numbers, but they're all way up
[2:56:29.980 --> 2:56:34.620]  Big one how you look at it, but they're all up different ways of measuring but all those indices are up
[2:56:35.820 --> 2:56:39.140]  And they teach them how people hang themselves they shoot themselves
[2:56:39.140 --> 2:56:43.940]  They take pills when they get depressed and you know all these 12 year old girls kill themselves 11 year old girls going well
[2:56:43.940 --> 2:56:46.900]  They taught me how you know, I'm and then they kill themselves
[2:56:47.700 --> 2:56:53.060]  They have a death education class in big schools and usually some girls every year in that every school
[2:56:53.060 --> 2:56:55.660]  they go home and kill themselves and again and
[2:56:57.900 --> 2:57:02.860]  Then if you see it says here teach the children how great quote gay sex is and how a queer lifestyle
[2:57:02.860 --> 2:57:04.500]  That's a term they use
[2:57:04.500 --> 2:57:07.060]  They've taken that derogatory term and like made it a good one
[2:57:08.660 --> 2:57:13.980]  How about you keep your hands off the kids perverts, so I'm going to cover that after I cover the foreign war news
[2:57:15.140 --> 2:57:21.340]  Before I end this hour. I've done three hours now without a single plug for the
[2:57:21.340 --> 2:57:29.540]  19 films I've directed and produced and the one film I've produced I made 20 films total fabled enemies is out
[2:57:30.460 --> 2:57:36.900]  It covers how the continuity of government shadow government carried out the attacks how the different intelligence agencies were tied in how the
[2:57:37.220 --> 2:57:39.220]  High Jackers were just government patsies
[2:57:41.700 --> 2:57:43.860]  I hope you will take action now
[2:57:44.620 --> 2:57:48.580]  And I hope you will go to info wars comm and for your library your collection
[2:57:48.580 --> 2:57:53.700]  But most importantly so you make copies of them and give them to people and show them to folks buy one copy
[2:57:53.700 --> 2:57:59.220]  Have a few parties show them to people every little bit is big in the final equation many hands make light work
[2:57:59.260 --> 2:58:01.260]  So get fabled enemies get truth rising

[3:03:03.500 --> 3:03:05.500]  For the folks watching on prisonplanet
[3:03:08.180 --> 3:03:11.180]  Dot TV Ukraine's government falls apart
[3:03:11.180 --> 3:03:17.540]  Ukraine's ruling pro-western coalition
[3:03:18.580 --> 3:03:22.540]  That's the new fad is to have a 25 year old blonde as your prime minister
[3:03:22.860 --> 3:03:29.780]  Ukraine's ruling pro-western coalition has officially collapsed the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament says
[3:03:31.220 --> 3:03:38.340]  President Victor Yoshinko has been involved in a long-running dispute with Prime Minister Yula
[3:03:38.340 --> 3:03:46.620]  Timo Shinko, I can never pronounce that right. She's a attractive lady. It dresses like an elf
[3:03:47.820 --> 3:03:49.740]  the president's
[3:03:49.740 --> 3:03:53.340]  Our Ukraine block left the coalition earlier this month
[3:03:53.780 --> 3:03:58.060]  Parliament now has 30 days to try to form a new ruling coalition
[3:03:59.540 --> 3:04:01.540]  If those efforts fail
[3:04:02.180 --> 3:04:05.940]  Mr. Yoshinko can dissolve parliament and call a snap election
[3:04:05.940 --> 3:04:10.780]  The our Ukraine party hold out of the coalition on September 3rd
[3:04:11.340 --> 3:04:19.340]  After the block sided with the pro-Moscow opposition party of regions to pass several laws that mr
[3:04:21.740 --> 3:04:24.700]  But we'll come back and cover all this right of time on the other side
[3:04:25.460 --> 3:04:28.740]  But this is a pretty interesting development geopolitically
[3:04:28.740 --> 3:04:36.340]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this country
[3:04:36.340 --> 3:04:42.580]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy been locked in this is his M.O
[3:04:42.580 --> 3:04:45.540]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden
[3:04:45.900 --> 3:04:52.740]  Fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[3:04:52.740 --> 3:04:59.300]  Some u.s. Investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the u.s
[3:04:59.540 --> 3:05:03.380]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained

[3:08:06.020 --> 3:08:12.940]  Okay, welcome back your calls all 20 of them are coming up. How many phone calls can this system take?
[3:08:16.060 --> 3:08:20.140]  Because you were telling me that you can open it up for what 30 seconds and get like 20 calls
[3:08:20.660 --> 3:08:26.140]  That's how many come through the phone system. Goodness gracious a lot of folks out there listening
[3:08:26.140 --> 3:08:27.900]  I
[3:08:27.900 --> 3:08:32.300]  Don't know. Maybe I should just go to your phone calls right now. Let me let me just run through the news
[3:08:32.300 --> 3:08:34.300]  I said I'd do that. So let me just do that
[3:08:38.380 --> 3:08:44.940]  So Dick Cheney after basically farming and ordering through Israel the sneak attack of
[3:08:44.940 --> 3:08:53.980]  of
[3:08:53.980 --> 3:08:55.980]  40 days ago or so
[3:08:56.140 --> 3:08:59.900]  Travels around to Poland to Ukraine to the Czech Republic
[3:09:00.900 --> 3:09:03.620]  To a bunch of other countries ringing Russia
[3:09:04.860 --> 3:09:07.900]  former possessions of the brutal Soviet regime and
[3:09:09.020 --> 3:09:12.940]  The governments all start basically falling apart or on the edge of falling apart
[3:09:12.940 --> 3:09:16.660]  So this is not looking too good for the United States
[3:09:16.660 --> 3:09:21.700]  I mean, this is what hubris and arrogance and really a kind of self-destructive attitude is generating
[3:09:23.020 --> 3:09:29.940]  Ukraine's ruling pro-western coalition has officially collapsed the speaker of the Ukraine parliament says we read part of that
[3:09:30.940 --> 3:09:35.060]  I officially declare the coalition of democratic forces in Ukraine's parliament dissolved
[3:09:35.860 --> 3:09:37.500]  Parliament speaker
[3:09:37.500 --> 3:09:42.980]  Announced on Tuesday. This has been long-expected. But for me, it's extremely sad. He told the chamber
[3:09:42.980 --> 3:09:47.400]  I would not call this a political apocalypse though. It is true that it is another
[3:09:48.740 --> 3:09:54.260]  Change of democracy. I hope we can overcome it now. Remember Yoshinko's government
[3:09:55.420 --> 3:09:57.420]  Was powerful guy in parliament
[3:09:58.940 --> 3:10:00.940]  The president
[3:10:00.940 --> 3:10:06.820]  Has wanted to kick the Russians out of their lease of the Ukrainian Black Sea port
[3:10:07.060 --> 3:10:14.380]  They've wanted to saber rattle move weapons systems into Ukraine which they've done and it's to menace Russia
[3:10:14.380 --> 3:10:17.380]  And it is causing a
[3:10:18.180 --> 3:10:22.700]  Major rift because the Ukraine's trading with Russia more than anybody and
[3:10:22.700 --> 3:10:30.140]  And then after that they're trading with the European Union in Europe. And so they don't want this to happen. And so
[3:10:31.100 --> 3:10:34.600]  By the United States pressing this or the people that run the United States
[3:10:34.700 --> 3:10:38.420]  It's endangering our relationship with all of Eastern Europe
[3:10:39.020 --> 3:10:43.340]  But hey, our currency is going bankrupt. All the big banks are going under basically
[3:10:43.860 --> 3:10:50.320]  We're on the tab to pay for it all and I guess this is people's idea of prosperity and happiness
[3:10:50.320 --> 3:10:53.480]  Meanwhile, our government gave Pakistan nukes and they've had
[3:10:55.960 --> 3:11:02.520]  Pakistani forces now are shooting at US helicopters Pakistan's got nukes. There's fighting going on everywhere
[3:11:03.840 --> 3:11:06.880]  The attacks on our troops are now killing more people in
[3:11:08.160 --> 3:11:12.320]  Afghanistan they are in Iraq the killing has really expanded there
[3:11:13.120 --> 3:11:15.120]  all of this is just
[3:11:15.120 --> 3:11:17.120]  swarming around and
[3:11:17.120 --> 3:11:24.320]  You could say what you want about it, but out of this global crisis. We see the push for world government
[3:11:24.320 --> 3:11:28.360]  Oh, we had a world war one. We need a League of Nations. Oh, we had a world war two. We need a UN
[3:11:28.360 --> 3:11:32.120]  Oh, all this conflict. We need a global government to stop all of it
[3:11:32.120 --> 3:11:35.860]  And that's what's being called for by all the saviors out there
[3:11:36.840 --> 3:11:42.360]  The people criticizing the neocons and the Neolibs their bosses are oh, this is just terrible
[3:11:42.360 --> 3:11:49.320]  We need to have a more responsive international order to the people and help the poor, but that's just the more kindler gentler new world order
[3:11:50.160 --> 3:11:52.160]  stratagem
[3:11:52.680 --> 3:11:56.880]  I in other news New York Sun has this report
[3:11:57.840 --> 3:12:00.120]  And I'm showing folks on prison planet dot TV
[3:12:02.040 --> 3:12:07.640]  Israel waging a secret war with Iran new book details mishaps that have
[3:12:07.640 --> 3:12:11.060]  Likely delayed Iran's efforts to go nuclear
[3:12:12.960 --> 3:12:19.400]  Israel and America are intensifying a clandestine war Iran that has run hot and cold since the Islamic Revolution in 79
[3:12:19.440 --> 3:12:23.360]  But it's grown more urgent as Iran races to obtain an atomic bomb
[3:12:25.280 --> 3:12:29.640]  They're not racing to do that all the inspectors have been there they gave into world government
[3:12:29.640 --> 3:12:34.280]  They gave into tyranny. That's the good cop. The bad cop is actually being bombarded from the air
[3:12:34.280 --> 3:12:39.240]  See how that's a false choice Pakistan gonna have nukes China, India, South Africa, Israel
[3:12:39.920 --> 3:12:41.920]  France England
[3:12:42.200 --> 3:12:43.760]  Russia
[3:12:43.760 --> 3:12:45.760]  Ukraine
[3:12:45.760 --> 3:12:47.760]  Everybody else can have weapons
[3:12:49.160 --> 3:12:52.280]  But the United States is mad
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  That Iran isn't
[3:12:55.120 --> 3:12:58.440]  Getting one really it's that's just the public can't find Iran
[3:12:58.440 --> 3:13:02.960]  On them on a map, but they think that it needs to be attacked
[3:13:06.440 --> 3:13:08.440]  Now see how that headline
[3:13:09.040 --> 3:13:13.280]  Says races to obtain an atomic bomb, but the New York Sun knows that's a lie
[3:13:13.400 --> 3:13:17.840]  So then they in the next paragraph knowing that most people won't literally
[3:13:18.880 --> 3:13:22.600]  Understand what that meant that by in the next paragraph
[3:13:22.600 --> 3:13:28.840]  They say that's the claim, but it's sold as a fact kind of like scores of AP and Reuters headlines and
[3:13:29.120 --> 3:13:34.120]  New York Post headlines and CNN and Fox headlines nuclear Iran tonight
[3:13:36.120 --> 3:13:44.280]  Coming up but first gas prices and then they go nuclear Iran as they get more centrifuges and move forward towards the Bashir
[3:13:44.280 --> 3:13:47.080]  Peaceful reactor, but the but the headline is I
[3:13:47.080 --> 3:13:54.760]  Ran close to being nuclear people. Oh, they're close to having the nuke just like Saddam had the nuke get them get them
[3:13:54.760 --> 3:13:56.760]  Get them Saddam's got nukes to get them
[3:13:57.040 --> 3:14:00.520]  They've pulled neocon followers and they still think they were nukes in Iraq
[3:14:03.280 --> 3:14:07.560]  It says this is the central claim in a new book the secret war with Iran oh
[3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:14.280]  It's a claim if they don't they're not trying to get a bomb by an Israeli journalist
[3:14:14.280 --> 3:14:18.280]  Ronnie
[3:14:18.280 --> 3:14:24.080]  Bergman I want to get him on that before I forget that I want to get Ronnie Bergman on just give this to Trey
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:32.240]  Who also deals a series of mishaps during the past two and a half years that have likely delayed Iran's efforts to go nuclear oh?
[3:14:36.760 --> 3:14:38.360]  Man it's mishaps well
[3:14:38.360 --> 3:14:44.360]  This is no new news from this is Rayleigh or from the New York Sun. Sighers reported four years ago
[3:14:45.040 --> 3:14:47.880]  About a year after we reported from our sources
[3:14:48.560 --> 3:14:49.600]  and
[3:14:49.600 --> 3:14:57.320]  Others reported that US special forces backing three separate Sunni groups one of them headed up by the number three in al Qaeda
[3:14:58.440 --> 3:15:00.440]  for the US
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:05.080]  Have been running pimprick terror attacks police station schools
[3:15:05.080 --> 3:15:08.560]  Nuclear scientists killing them
[3:15:11.040 --> 3:15:18.920]  Black ops and and and and now bombing mosque blowing up dams bombing dams and then bush comes out middle of last year
[3:15:18.920 --> 3:15:22.880]  I guess over a year ago now man time's flying on the white house gov and
[3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:25.440]  Says yes, it's true
[3:15:26.520 --> 3:15:32.720]  We have special forces working with and enlisted the groups in Iran and the groups were all al Qaeda
[3:15:32.720 --> 3:15:42.040]  So the u.s. Has al Qaeda attacking Iran who she I and then John McCain runs around saying Iran is running al Qaeda attacks in Iraq and
[3:15:42.920 --> 3:15:44.560]  Is Sunni?
[3:15:44.560 --> 3:15:46.360]  Look, they're not Sunni folks
[3:15:46.360 --> 3:15:52.560]  I don't care what you want to believe is mindless little fake conservatives that suck your thumbs and think open borders and gun control is
[3:15:52.800 --> 3:15:54.720]  Conservatives you're not conservatives
[3:15:54.720 --> 3:16:01.720]  You are little pathetic toadies of the party just like the Democrats who support Nancy Pelosi and her warmongering
[3:16:04.560 --> 3:16:07.080]  This is unbelievable absolutely unbelievable
[3:16:11.560 --> 3:16:15.440]  You guys shut that door it popped up and that door is driving me crazy. Thanks
[3:16:17.000 --> 3:16:23.120]  While president Bush and other Western leaders have warned of the seriousness of the threat that Iran may obtain a nuclear weapon
[3:16:23.120 --> 3:16:28.080]  Little reporting a service in the West and the efforts in the shadows to stop the Iranians
[3:16:28.080 --> 3:16:33.520]  So so first they say they've gotten they're trying to get a bomb then oh it's just a claim and then oh
[3:16:34.760 --> 3:16:38.000]  Little has been said about how we're trying to stop them from getting the bomb
[3:16:38.000 --> 3:16:41.640]  So now they reintroduce it as fact again very deceptive writing
[3:16:42.640 --> 3:16:45.360]  while president Bush and other Western leaders have warned of the
[3:16:45.640 --> 3:16:52.200]  seriousness of the threat that Iran may obtain a nuclear weapon little reporting a service in the West on the efforts in the shadows to
[3:16:52.200 --> 3:16:57.160]  Stop the Iranians. Mr. Bergman himself has had to skate a close line in this area
[3:16:57.240 --> 3:17:04.440]  In part because of military censorship in Israel where some of the reporting has been withheld from publication pending rulings by the Israeli Supreme Court
[3:17:05.160 --> 3:17:06.280]  nonetheless
[3:17:06.280 --> 3:17:08.280]  the Israeli journalist
[3:17:08.280 --> 3:17:14.720]  Compiles a picture that suggests that the West has some has had some success in the war to stop the Iranian bomb
[3:17:14.720 --> 3:17:16.720]  Mr. Bergman reports for example that in January
[3:17:16.720 --> 3:17:23.560]  2007 Iran determined that some of its nuclear suppliers in Europe were fronts for Western intelligence agencies
[3:17:24.400 --> 3:17:25.400]  specifically
[3:17:25.400 --> 3:17:27.400]  Britain's MI 6 and
[3:17:28.760 --> 3:17:36.240]  Mr. Bergman writes that between February 06 and March 07 at least three planes belong to revolutionary guards crash in Iran
[3:17:36.240 --> 3:17:39.040]  Yeah, and I ran keep saying our planes are blowing up
[3:17:40.280 --> 3:17:44.280]  While carrying personnel connected with the security of the nuclear project
[3:17:44.280 --> 3:17:52.560]  Now again, it's not a nuclear program that's admitted, but they're still killing these people and that's and Iran can't fight back in any way
[3:17:52.560 --> 3:17:59.240]  In fact, they've said if Iran even shoots a one bullet back if they're attacked by the US and Israel that will be called terrorism
[3:17:59.240 --> 3:18:04.000]  And they will go on the news and say Al Qaeda for no reason has snuck attack us
[3:18:04.240 --> 3:18:07.520]  It won't matter if we've just seen three days of bombings of Iran
[3:18:07.720 --> 3:18:13.200]  They will just call Iran firing back Al Qaeda is striking and they will say
[3:18:13.200 --> 3:18:19.600]  Do like they did with Georgia. I'm not kidding. They will say I ran launched a sneak attack on our forces and
[3:18:20.520 --> 3:18:26.040]  People will stick flags on their cars and drive, but see they're gonna take your pension funds, too
[3:18:26.040 --> 3:18:30.880]  They're not just gonna lie and say I ran attacked when they didn't they're not just gonna lie and attack
[3:18:32.440 --> 3:18:39.200]  Into Georgian territory into Russian areas and say that Russia did it see see when you accept these type of delusions
[3:18:39.200 --> 3:18:43.280]  The elites say these people are cut total cattle. Let's just go all the way with them
[3:18:43.960 --> 3:18:46.120]  They would have never dare try this before
[3:18:47.720 --> 3:18:55.120]  So murdering Iranians and mr. Berger writes between February oh six and March oh seven at least three planes belong to revolutionary guard crash Iran
[3:18:55.600 --> 3:18:59.960]  The secret effort appears not to be limited to modifying equipment on January 18th
[3:18:59.960 --> 3:19:03.020]  Oh seven Iranian expert on electromagnetics who worked in an a
[3:19:03.840 --> 3:19:06.340]  enrichment facility died in his apartment
[3:19:06.340 --> 3:19:10.340]  The author quotes the deputy director of the Islamic Atomic Energy Commission
[3:19:10.540 --> 3:19:14.820]  Ellie Levetti as saying in a closed forum that
[3:19:15.740 --> 3:19:20.980]  Operations against Iran gained time for us and have doubtless cause significant delays in the project
[3:19:20.980 --> 3:19:26.020]  So this is just them acting like they've had a covert victory against a program that doesn't exist
[3:19:26.500 --> 3:19:29.260]  Because they got their butt kicked in Lebanon and other places
[3:19:29.900 --> 3:19:31.780]  You know what?
[3:19:31.780 --> 3:19:36.820]  You know what? Let's just skip this break and let's just I'm gonna finish up with this news
[3:19:37.900 --> 3:19:40.020]  and then
[3:19:40.020 --> 3:19:46.260]  I'm gonna go ahead and start going to the calls because I'll never get to Jeff Phil misty Mark Kitty Gilbert Dave Vinnie Ryan
[3:19:46.260 --> 3:19:49.680]  Buck Tom and others if I don't start going to your calls
[3:19:50.020 --> 3:19:52.900]  You just you just read this and it's just complete crap
[3:19:52.900 --> 3:20:01.860]  And it goes on to say they're killing Iranian terrorists and that's what these doctors that work in the plants are their terrorists
[3:20:02.260 --> 3:20:05.220]  And when they kill us microbiologists, it's their terrorist
[3:20:05.220 --> 3:20:09.980]  I guess and when the government launches anthrax attacks, it's to stop terrorist and when they do all this
[3:20:09.980 --> 3:20:13.420]  It's for your own good. No, it's not and they cynically know that okay
[3:20:14.420 --> 3:20:16.420]  Very interesting article
[3:20:16.420 --> 3:20:20.180]  But I'm only one I not only want to get this is railing on I want to get
[3:20:20.180 --> 3:20:22.180]  it
[3:20:22.260 --> 3:20:24.260]  Eli Lake on
[3:20:24.820 --> 3:20:29.580]  I'm gonna give this to you right now. I want Eli Lake, please and I want
[3:20:33.460 --> 3:20:35.460]  This Bergman on
[3:20:38.540 --> 3:20:40.900]  To Ronan actually calling him Ronnie
[3:20:41.380 --> 3:20:47.620]  Here it is. We give that to Teddy Eddie bear. I'm whatever his name is today. Thank you. Appreciate it folks
[3:20:47.620 --> 3:20:50.300]  I'm out of it lately. I'm really out of it right now because I've been
[3:20:51.140 --> 3:20:52.060]  jogging
[3:20:52.060 --> 3:20:55.900]  Like a mile and a half a day, which isn't far. I'm really out of shape
[3:20:56.100 --> 3:21:00.980]  Just lifting weights once a week and doing some bicycle hadn't been cutting it. So I've been doing some jogging some and
[3:21:02.740 --> 3:21:04.740]  It
[3:21:06.540 --> 3:21:13.500]  I have more mental stamina almost when I'm smoking cigarettes and sitting around it's strange when I'm actually exercising
[3:21:13.500 --> 3:21:16.940]  Okay, it doesn't matter
[3:21:18.180 --> 3:21:20.580]  What's really happening is I'm losing all composure
[3:21:20.940 --> 3:21:26.340]  Because I'm I'm on the air so much and I'm on the air behind the scenes that just everyone is seeing everything now
[3:21:26.340 --> 3:21:31.820]  It's it's a total transparency is the new radio show here kind of the first time this has been done
[3:21:31.820 --> 3:21:34.060]  I think it's like reality TV here
[3:21:35.780 --> 3:21:39.660]  Let me tell you see if I skip the brakes though, then I don't have brakes. Let me just rest for a second. Oh
[3:21:40.620 --> 3:21:42.620]  Just a micro nap
[3:21:42.620 --> 3:21:44.620]  I
[3:21:46.820 --> 3:21:51.500]  Okay, there we go. I'm actually relaxed after that actually worked quite nicely. Oh
[3:21:52.460 --> 3:21:58.380]  Oh, man, I've got a meeting with my ghost writer after this for hours and then a bunch of other stuff. I'm not whining. I just
[3:21:59.940 --> 3:22:03.500]  There's so much to go over, you know, I may not even cover this
[3:22:04.420 --> 3:22:07.620]  Just know what's going on in British and US and European schools
[3:22:07.620 --> 3:22:15.580]  Know that B. F. Skinner tortured his son to death over several years in a small box and is hailed for it and
[3:22:17.620 --> 3:22:21.620]  Know that you've got to get evil people to run a criminal government
[3:22:22.620 --> 3:22:29.180]  And so a lot of their front line people and a lot of their technocrats and even horrible people are part of pedophile guilds
[3:22:31.620 --> 3:22:34.500]  And so what they're doing is they're legitimizing
[3:22:34.500 --> 3:22:42.020]  That parents can't talk to their children can't drive their children off in England with a towel without being government registered to touch
[3:22:42.020 --> 3:22:48.300]  Their child so see they make everybody else a pedophile for no reason and then they teach the children in the US and England
[3:22:48.620 --> 3:22:55.820]  how to not just have gay sex when they're six seven years old, but how to
[3:22:56.700 --> 3:23:03.460]  Do things like inserting giant dangerous implements in themselves and I can't even I mean
[3:23:03.460 --> 3:23:05.380]  There's recordings of what in Massachusetts?
[3:23:05.380 --> 3:23:11.820]  They teach elementary school students that that that I actually played on air about ten years ago and a few affiliates dropped us
[3:23:11.820 --> 3:23:14.540]  I mean it was small children brought to a
[3:23:15.340 --> 3:23:17.340]  College dormitory and put in beds
[3:23:17.980 --> 3:23:21.020]  And and then the school taught them how to have sex with each other
[3:23:21.540 --> 3:23:25.140]  Whether it's heterosexual homosexual, whatever it shouldn't be going on and it's wrong
[3:23:26.340 --> 3:23:30.220]  But I have to say it is the quote gays that are pushing
[3:23:30.220 --> 3:23:37.940]  Homosexual sex and so it seems that because that's a protected group. They're allowed to engage in pedophilia. We're gonna go live right now. Here we go
[3:23:37.940 --> 3:24:03.100]  On screen I'm holding up an article that reads teach the pleasure of gay sex to children as young as five say researchers
[3:24:03.100 --> 3:24:09.180]  Yes, we are shifting from Israeli u.s.
[3:24:09.820 --> 3:24:16.500]  British and al-qaeda will hobbyist killing and murdering Iranian police killing doctors
[3:24:17.220 --> 3:24:21.900]  Nuclear experts blowing things up and it's they our government brags about it in newspapers
[3:24:21.900 --> 3:24:24.420]  and now we've shifted gears into
[3:24:25.820 --> 3:24:28.980]  This and this is going on in the u.s. This is going on in England
[3:24:28.980 --> 3:24:34.580]  I covered this a decade ago, and I can't even really read this on air even though. It's out of a major newspaper
[3:24:35.580 --> 3:24:41.420]  You it's it's it's homophobic to say you shouldn't teach children as young as five
[3:24:42.100 --> 3:24:47.100]  That it's wonderful to have gay sex now if you teach him heterosexual sex
[3:24:47.260 --> 3:24:53.620]  That's pedophilia, but because they're a protected group. They do teach this and it's pedophilia and it's wrong
[3:24:53.620 --> 3:25:01.540]  And just got help us just got help us children as young as five should be taught to understand the pleasures of gay sex according to
[3:25:02.660 --> 3:25:08.700]  Leaders of a taxpayer funded education project and it goes in to say that millions of dollars six hundred thousand pounds
[3:25:08.700 --> 3:25:12.540]  Just in one program is being taught in 14 primary schools
[3:25:12.980 --> 3:25:16.420]  They the parents are told it's part of a stop bullying and prejudice
[3:25:16.900 --> 3:25:18.900]  aimed at homosexuals and then in it
[3:25:18.900 --> 3:25:24.260]  Five-year-olds that have never even heard of sex who are totally innocent have their minds ruined and again. I mentioned earlier
[3:25:25.220 --> 3:25:32.940]  The feds in this country in England started suicide education in 1990 and then every school that did it saw suicide start
[3:25:32.940 --> 3:25:40.300]  And they teach the little girls they so you don't do this will show you how you strangle yourself or how you eat three bottles of Tylenol
[3:25:40.540 --> 3:25:47.100]  Did you know girls kill themselves by going and getting all these different bottles of cold medicines that it will kill you
[3:25:47.100 --> 3:25:49.820]  But it's painless you go to sleep now
[3:25:49.820 --> 3:25:55.060]  We're going to show you the basketball diaries of mass shootings in schools and then boom it all starts
[3:25:55.740 --> 3:25:57.740]  they know and
[3:25:57.740 --> 3:26:02.540]  So oh let us teach you how to fist each other and that's in here
[3:26:04.140 --> 3:26:07.100]  How to bleed how do you how a pleasurable it is
[3:26:08.420 --> 3:26:13.860]  Let us teach you how to do this and then if you say I don't want that you are arrested
[3:26:13.860 --> 3:26:17.660]  Because to say you're against it is I'm not kidding just type
[3:26:19.500 --> 3:26:27.300]  Prejudice raids England Robin Page BBC presenter said that rural communities deserve the same rights as homosexuals and that word
[3:26:27.820 --> 3:26:33.860]  Homosexual is illegal if they choose they have special social network social services boards
[3:26:34.220 --> 3:26:37.940]  This is not a joke. This is not satire if you're watching this. This is happening
[3:26:37.940 --> 3:26:47.620]  So they just destroy the innocence of these children and this is part of the recruiting and and the eugenic is cold bloodedly do this
[3:26:47.660 --> 3:26:49.660]  So people don't
[3:26:50.220 --> 3:26:51.900]  Have children
[3:26:51.900 --> 3:26:56.060]  Propriation this is about and then they say this in the 20s. They said we're going to teach us in schools
[3:26:57.060 --> 3:26:59.060]  so people don't have children anymore and
[3:27:00.260 --> 3:27:04.300]  so now they're targeting your children for over a decade and I
[3:27:04.300 --> 3:27:11.660]  You know, they're going to corrupt your children you put them in a government training camp you're out of your mind
[3:27:12.620 --> 3:27:18.180]  Out but I'm against heterosexual or homosexual indoctrination of five-year-olds twelve-year-olds
[3:27:18.700 --> 3:27:24.420]  Ten-year-olds, but I mean this is five-year-olds and God Almighty folks. We've played the tapes from the classrooms
[3:27:25.020 --> 3:27:31.900]  Where they bust the seven eight nine-year-olds to college dorms and put them in badge together and then they teach him and haven't you know
[3:27:31.900 --> 3:27:39.620]  It's it's open pedophilia is now legal in the country selectively the only government can practice open pedophilia
[3:27:39.740 --> 3:27:42.540]  That's why you've had so many Homeland Security state directors
[3:27:42.820 --> 3:27:47.740]  Deputy directors caught because the whole government isn't bad all the police aren't bad all the military isn't bad
[3:27:47.740 --> 3:27:51.500]  The whole system isn't corrupt yet, so they keep busting their own people
[3:27:52.420 --> 3:27:58.380]  Texas Youth Commission giant rape rams public rape riparariums and the coined a term. I mean literally
[3:27:58.380 --> 3:28:00.740]  It's just it's just hell has been released

[3:29:35.020 --> 3:29:40.980]  Hey, we're hanging out with you and then we learned people associate with them then put out videos trying to falsely claim
[3:29:40.980 --> 3:29:42.660]  I'm with those guys
[3:29:42.660 --> 3:29:50.420]  From the patriot perspective exposing that I staged it all just so it's like a triple black off being run of deception
[3:29:50.420 --> 3:29:53.220]  I can hardly figure it out much less the average viewer of YouTube
[3:29:53.940 --> 3:29:57.740]  But yeah, they come up. Hey, we're with Alex Jones. Hey kill Michelle Malkin
[3:29:57.740 --> 3:30:03.660]  and then and then and then later the media sets me up and then they kind of leave in the same direction as them and are
[3:30:03.660 --> 3:30:09.660]  Friendly on video with each other, but we want to know who the guys in disguises are who are with them
[3:30:09.660 --> 3:30:15.300]  We know Al Marco goes over and then tells the police knowingly
[3:30:15.300 --> 3:30:20.740]  Hey, Alex is saying kill Michelle Malkin when he knows it's not me saying it, but I tell us what you know about it
[3:30:21.340 --> 3:30:25.740]  Well watching Michelle Malkin videos. She was doing a lot of setups
[3:30:26.460 --> 3:30:29.060]  Making somebody go out there and talk to some unknowing
[3:30:29.220 --> 3:30:34.600]  You know college kid who thinks he's the communist or something and get him to spill their guts and make it fun of it
[3:30:34.600 --> 3:30:36.100]  With a video on there on her posting
[3:30:36.100 --> 3:30:41.660]  No, no, she admitted that she got a quote attack the day before to it was all about setting up provocative actions
[3:30:41.660 --> 3:30:43.380]  And then going oh my god
[3:30:43.380 --> 3:30:47.940]  I call for putting everybody in camps and then I go to real hardcore liberal things and they don't like me
[3:30:47.940 --> 3:30:49.220]  I mean go
[3:30:49.220 --> 3:30:55.380]  But anyways, I recognized them right away as a guy that I used to rent a room to two years ago and
[3:30:55.980 --> 3:30:59.020]  I watched all the videos up close listening to them
[3:30:59.020 --> 3:31:04.100]  It's exactly how the the man acted was saying no no no no no it wasn't me wasn't me no no no
[3:31:04.100 --> 3:31:08.500]  And I looked it up. I can't find him on the state of Michigan anymore
[3:31:08.500 --> 3:31:13.740]  I looked him up in the in the United States and sure enough there's a guy with his name who lives in Denver and
[3:31:14.180 --> 3:31:17.500]  I sent emails to emails to el marco telling him
[3:31:17.500 --> 3:31:20.420]  I think I know who you are if you are you from Detroit, you know
[3:31:20.420 --> 3:31:23.980]  You owe me this money and and then and you're just you know
[3:31:23.980 --> 3:31:26.580]  I told him you you got to open your eyes and wake up
[3:31:26.580 --> 3:31:32.220]  I told the whole new world order, you know scheme and and never responded nothing absolutely nothing
[3:31:32.220 --> 3:31:35.540]  And it's well, I mean, I don't know about all that. I mean, I'm not doubting but I don't know about that
[3:31:35.540 --> 3:31:39.340]  I can't confirm or deny that well, then I got back to him and I said look I
[3:31:39.620 --> 3:31:43.940]  Since you didn't you didn't respond. I know exactly who you are and he still didn't respond
[3:31:44.220 --> 3:31:49.300]  So I I looked him up on the and white pages. His name is Dave Lanham
[3:31:52.180 --> 3:31:54.180]  LAH AM
[3:31:54.180 --> 3:32:01.900]  L a n H a m Lanham L a what L a n H a m
[3:32:03.620 --> 3:32:10.740]  Also, he uses a fake name. Oh, yeah, well Marco. I remember him talking about something about el marco way back in the day
[3:32:11.540 --> 3:32:16.580]  Well, you have to understand their people have tried to set us up with this info you sound credible, but just
[3:32:17.340 --> 3:32:19.340]  write me up something with some proof or
[3:32:19.340 --> 3:32:23.700]  Or give me his contact info because we caught him other days following us
[3:32:24.460 --> 3:32:27.420]  Trying to do stuff. I have a video of us
[3:32:28.140 --> 3:32:31.420]  At a party I threw like 10 12 years ago. I
[3:32:32.220 --> 3:32:36.780]  Mean if you could see who he is. Yeah, mail it mail it to us. I mean I want proof
[3:32:36.780 --> 3:32:48.620]  Because well, we're going back to the full audience. Here we go
[3:32:48.620 --> 3:33:03.100]  You know, I said I take these 20 phone calls this one caller is so great about Malcolm's people trying to set me up
[3:33:06.380 --> 3:33:09.220]  That's what he's talking about al marco and he's saying his name is
[3:33:10.860 --> 3:33:12.540]  Dave Lanham
[3:33:12.540 --> 3:33:15.540]  But you know regardless if they got exposed they got beat
[3:33:15.540 --> 3:33:22.660]  It came out that they set that up and that their people were yelling Michelle kill Michelle Malcolm and so
[3:33:23.060 --> 3:33:26.460]  Another big defeat for them. They're just more just like she said we fake the dog
[3:33:26.460 --> 3:33:32.700]  It wasn't real the Marines threw off that's come out and so our credibility goes up their credibility goes down now
[3:33:32.700 --> 3:33:37.380]  For the dumb down mass who kind of halfway heard I said kill a woman that'll be out there forever
[3:33:37.380 --> 3:33:42.900]  But anytime I'm attacked on I can just just prove it so it won't stick and that's what's important
[3:33:42.900 --> 3:33:49.740]  So Jeff, send me that info. Okay, buddy. I will but I Alex aside from all Alex Jones is excellent movies
[3:33:49.740 --> 3:33:56.540]  I think people should go check out a movie series called the Illuminati and another movie called rings of power and
[3:33:57.140 --> 3:33:59.860]  I think it would be a mistake to
[3:34:01.020 --> 3:34:02.820]  disregard the
[3:34:02.820 --> 3:34:08.140]  spiritual implications of what's what's happening. I don't have to explain to you how evil these people are
[3:34:08.140 --> 3:34:15.060]  But it is really a spirit war of those like 10 and 20 part series on YouTube
[3:34:15.820 --> 3:34:19.140]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think I've seen a few of those even linked to them
[3:34:19.140 --> 3:34:25.220]  So don't think that we're disregarding something just because you don't hear us the particular show you tune into cover something
[3:34:25.900 --> 3:34:31.500]  Listen, I appreciate your call Jeff. Let's talk to a Phil in New York Phil. You're on the air
[3:34:31.500 --> 3:34:38.340]  Hey Alex, how are you doing? Good sir? I wanted to talk to you about something that's going on right now right under our noses on
[3:34:38.460 --> 3:34:46.820]  On YouTube they're taking a whole nother step now at censorship and a number of Patriot accounts have been removed overnight
[3:34:46.820 --> 3:34:51.340]  I knew that a lot of my videos are being erased. I mean
[3:34:52.420 --> 3:34:56.060]  Folks they're openly saying they want to shut the web down. They say we're kicking their hind in
[3:34:56.060 --> 3:35:01.020]  You better get the videos on DVD and make copies of them. You better spread the files around
[3:35:01.540 --> 3:35:08.300]  While you can we're going into a major depression probably. I mean my god, it's getting worse faster than I thought it would
[3:35:08.820 --> 3:35:13.980]  And I'm here eat drinking and sleeping literally eating on the air because I'm you know
[3:35:14.820 --> 3:35:17.140]  Working all the time, you know even during breaks now
[3:35:17.700 --> 3:35:19.700]  And I've somehow got to live here
[3:35:19.820 --> 3:35:23.700]  And it's just getting more and more serious. Tell us what's happening on YouTube
[3:35:23.700 --> 3:35:27.540]  Okay, well if you go to uh, there was a bunch of longer
[3:35:28.140 --> 3:35:32.360]  URL addresses, but I shorten them up if you go to tiny url.com
[3:35:33.180 --> 3:35:40.540]  Flash YouTube censored you can watch a video by enough respect one of one of the greatest Patriots we have wait a minute
[3:35:40.540 --> 3:35:44.020]  They they they ban enough respects account. No, no, he's not banned yet
[3:35:44.020 --> 3:35:46.660]  But a number of other people are and he's made a video on this
[3:35:47.180 --> 3:35:49.180]  Okay, well, I know he actually
[3:35:49.180 --> 3:35:55.260]  Won the first contest I've got to get around to announcing the second contest winner for for censorship with the video
[3:35:55.260 --> 3:35:59.620]  We put together. Well, he well video. We did he put together. Okay. Well, this is a new video
[3:35:59.620 --> 3:36:04.900]  This just came out today. Good in in the video. He's got a link to an article now
[3:36:04.900 --> 3:36:11.260]  You could see this article also. It's about a YouTube makes senator Lieberman happy with new anti-terrorism guidelines
[3:36:11.620 --> 3:36:15.980]  What they're doing is they're going ahead and removing videos that they deem are
[3:36:15.980 --> 3:36:20.260]  Our terrorist in nature. No, no, that's right. Then this is huge news
[3:36:20.260 --> 3:36:23.020]  We've got to get Paul Watson and Steve Watson incurred on this
[3:36:23.020 --> 3:36:27.700]  I remember a month ago. YouTube's got a letter and Google did
[3:36:28.220 --> 3:36:31.340]  Which is the parent of YouTube. I remember this to them
[3:36:32.460 --> 3:36:36.140]  Saying anything that's terrorist quote terrorist propaganda
[3:36:36.860 --> 3:36:40.540]  We want you to remove and they'd already been doing that like the marine puppy video
[3:36:40.540 --> 3:36:46.340]  They removed it even when ABC News was airing it and Fox News was airing it. They were it was anti-american
[3:36:46.340 --> 3:36:51.780]  They said to show our troops doing bad things and then last time I heard Google was considering
[3:36:52.380 --> 3:36:54.660]  doing this so now and then and then we have the
[3:36:55.540 --> 3:36:56.700]  different
[3:36:56.700 --> 3:37:01.420]  Homegrown extremists acts and then the hearings in Congress wanting to risk and they showed
[3:37:02.460 --> 3:37:05.740]  Architects and engineers for 9-11 truth and so they were Al Qaeda
[3:37:05.740 --> 3:37:10.180]  The national TV is now saying I'm really trained in Afghanistan and all this
[3:37:10.180 --> 3:37:15.020]  I mean, it's totally mindless, but folks you've got a public that believes the Federal Reserve is government
[3:37:15.020 --> 3:37:21.020]  They believe everything they're told and so they hear I said kill Michelle Malkin. They hear I'm Al Qaeda trained
[3:37:21.220 --> 3:37:24.140]  They believe it. You're telling me that
[3:37:24.700 --> 3:37:29.380]  That yeah, there's an article mainstream where YouTube says they are doing that
[3:37:29.380 --> 3:37:36.300]  Well, it's a this article I'm looking at here is on e-flux media. It was linked to in enough respects video
[3:37:36.300 --> 3:37:43.020]  But they're doing this via s 1959 which is this this homegrown terrorism bill
[3:37:43.020 --> 3:37:46.500]  And if you want to if you want to look at that you can go to tiny url
[3:37:46.580 --> 3:37:52.620]  Dot com slash homegrown terrorism and you can view the bill and again with that you can go to tiny url
[3:37:52.620 --> 3:37:56.820]  Listen, let me just stop you because given out these links better get out headlines
[3:37:56.820 --> 3:38:03.500]  And then folks can find things that way. Why don't you why don't you email this to Aaron at info wars dot com?
[3:38:03.500 --> 3:38:08.220]  Two a's right now, and he will post it in the next ten minutes on info wars dot com
[3:38:08.220 --> 3:38:10.220]  But but this is important, but wrap it up
[3:38:10.580 --> 3:38:15.460]  Okay, well you could see you could see who voted against you know free speech
[3:38:15.820 --> 3:38:22.820]  Because when this went to vote only six people said nay and four hundred and four people said yes, and this is the
[3:38:22.820 --> 3:38:27.900]  Yeah, you can look for the article on gov track that u.s. It's house vote on passes hr
[3:38:28.340 --> 3:38:33.220]  1955 violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism now now has that left the Senate yet?
[3:38:33.860 --> 3:38:38.780]  Um, I don't think so. I'm not sure but they're already enforcing it on YouTube. Yeah, no
[3:38:38.780 --> 3:38:43.780]  I knew that Lieberman not video. I knew that Lieberman said do that. Thank you for the call excellent caller
[3:38:43.780 --> 3:38:48.580]  We will get right on that. That's the kind of thing where it's in the stack, and I don't get to it
[3:38:48.580 --> 3:38:54.180]  I mean, I didn't mention in a month ago, but yeah, and and saying look just anything it's anti-government
[3:38:54.700 --> 3:39:00.060]  Anything that criticizes the government aides the terrorists take it off remember Calhoun
[3:39:00.940 --> 3:39:02.940]  the deputy attorney general in
[3:39:03.500 --> 3:39:06.660]  2003 in California under Bill Lockyer
[3:39:07.620 --> 3:39:09.620]  He was in the newspapers
[3:39:09.860 --> 3:39:11.860]  including the Baltimore
[3:39:13.700 --> 3:39:15.700]  Tribune Baltimore the
[3:39:15.700 --> 3:39:19.300]  Oakland Tribune Oakland Tribune I
[3:39:20.900 --> 3:39:26.020]  Remember I read it on there over and over again. It was such a big deal. I read it over and over again on air
[3:39:27.140 --> 3:39:29.580]  He said in the peace
[3:39:31.180 --> 3:39:37.380]  That we're banning all protest against the war in California and he's a Democrat because the war is against al-Qaeda
[3:39:37.380 --> 3:39:42.900]  And so if you protest a war this war you're for al-Qaeda saying Saddam was al-Qaeda
[3:39:42.900 --> 3:39:47.540]  And they're really getting ready for something folks. They are coming after the web
[3:39:47.540 --> 3:39:52.460]  I mean I get up here and I say you should appreciate our videos. You should appreciate the access you have to them
[3:39:52.980 --> 3:39:55.660]  Folks you better go eight five six hours a day
[3:39:56.300 --> 3:39:57.740]  you know
[3:39:57.740 --> 3:40:02.900]  On message boards on blogs sending videos to news groups in the list in my space
[3:40:02.900 --> 3:40:06.740]  I mean you better bust your butt. We're having big victories
[3:40:06.740 --> 3:40:11.980]  So they're moving to block us and they're moving at every level Aaron. Did you hear all that earlier? You?
[3:40:14.220 --> 3:40:18.900]  Didn't hear come on in here come on in the studio. I'll just have to let you know I
[3:40:19.740 --> 3:40:23.060]  Know he's busy watching videos. He's posting on info wars calm
[3:40:23.900 --> 3:40:27.660]  Let me give you just a 30 seconds synopsis because I have to do this on air, you know, I have calls
[3:40:28.260 --> 3:40:30.260]  50 of them or something
[3:40:30.260 --> 3:40:35.780]  On air. I was telling you they're sending it to Aaron and info wars calm right now
[3:40:37.020 --> 3:40:42.540]  Remember laborman a month ago said that he wanted YouTube and Google to ban anything that was pro-terrorist
[3:40:42.540 --> 3:40:47.380]  That means if you're against the war you're pro-terrorist or we show the troops killing children. You're pro-terrorist
[3:40:48.340 --> 3:40:54.860]  They're saying that that's now being implemented that YouTube's banning all these accounts that show troop atrocities and things like that
[3:40:54.860 --> 3:40:56.620]  Which we know they do
[3:40:56.620 --> 3:41:01.380]  And so that's a big story. We need to get on the violent radicalization act passing the house
[3:41:01.540 --> 3:41:06.380]  And he says enough respect has a new video out on it. So educate yourself on that. Let's get
[3:41:07.060 --> 3:41:09.420]  He also plugs some URLs to check them
[3:41:09.420 --> 3:41:12.180]  But I know everything he was saying is already verified
[3:41:12.180 --> 3:41:18.540]  But it just check them and get it up on info wars calm right now in the in the news and focus area with the breaking news area, okay?
[3:41:19.460 --> 3:41:21.860]  Featured news there. Thank you, sir
[3:41:21.860 --> 3:41:26.740]  Okay, now I got to give each caller about a minute or two or we'll ever get to all these people misty in North Carolina
[3:41:26.740 --> 3:41:27.820]  You're on the air
[3:41:27.820 --> 3:41:32.980]  Hi, Alex. Hello. I want to say thanks to all you guys in the studio
[3:41:33.380 --> 3:41:37.620]  What you do every day you've influenced my life in a huge way
[3:41:37.860 --> 3:41:42.340]  We started a group here in Greensboro, North Carolina called tried 9-eleven truth
[3:41:42.460 --> 3:41:50.580]  We had our first street action 9-eleven and we passed out like 75 copies of loose chains that I got from info wars TV
[3:41:50.580 --> 3:41:57.380]  and 175 pieces of literature and we plan on doing something deal at the 11th of every month, but
[3:41:58.020 --> 3:42:00.340]  It's just exciting. Just thank you. Thank you
[3:42:01.380 --> 3:42:03.380]  well, thank you and
[3:42:03.660 --> 3:42:10.820]  My question this is going to sound really crazy with the events with the economy and the bank and maybe even possibly
[3:42:10.980 --> 3:42:15.500]  The running of the bank if one were to want to like leave the United States
[3:42:15.500 --> 3:42:21.940]  I mean, there's gonna have to be a time when you if you plan to leave or you just stand up and fight
[3:42:21.940 --> 3:42:23.380]  But if you leave
[3:42:23.380 --> 3:42:25.820]  You have to leave before there's too much of a crisis
[3:42:25.820 --> 3:42:31.140]  Well, they've also passed international laws where they can steal your money for leaving the country
[3:42:31.140 --> 3:42:34.580]  But only big bankers can all leave and have private islands and keep all their money
[3:42:34.580 --> 3:42:39.340]  But you can't really keep much of it. But yeah, no things are shaping up to where
[3:42:39.340 --> 3:42:47.340]  Um, that's you know, the evacuation may be needed. I mean, it's it's that bad. I mean, they built death camps
[3:42:47.340 --> 3:42:49.980]  They uh Rocky Mountain News reported eight years ago
[3:42:50.300 --> 3:42:54.460]  They built giant crematoriums and you can argue whether the Nazis had crematoriums or not
[3:42:54.460 --> 3:42:57.420]  But uh, I mean, we know they had them for burning dead bodies
[3:42:57.420 --> 3:43:03.180]  But people claim they didn't the point is that the governor said we built all these big ovens to burn people during a bio attack
[3:43:03.180 --> 3:43:08.220]  I mean the black off governments are very very sick and they're you Genesis and they want to get rid of us
[3:43:08.220 --> 3:43:12.060]  Uh, yeah, they do but you know problem. Well, there's nowhere to run
[3:43:12.060 --> 3:43:15.580]  So the best thing to do is is stand and fight and wake people up now
[3:43:16.460 --> 3:43:20.060]  But uh, I mean the world tyranny is pretty much everywhere
[3:43:21.500 --> 3:43:27.420]  Yeah, I guess so I guess it's a global full spectrum dominance death grid
[3:43:30.140 --> 3:43:35.900]  I just wonder if you could maintain and survive longer if you like run to the mountains of Greece or I mean, I don't know
[3:43:35.900 --> 3:43:40.700]  Where well, what do you do? I mean, how long could you stand and fight if they come to get you at four o'clock in the morning?
[3:43:40.700 --> 3:43:46.460]  And I mean, well, if they come how many guns I'd buried if they come at four o'clock in the morning
[3:43:47.740 --> 3:43:52.940]  With the local, you know police doing it and one percent fight back they'll lose and pull back
[3:43:53.660 --> 3:43:59.900]  Uh, I mean if we do like the Russians didn't give in to it. They'll kill millions of us and they'll do it with enjoyment
[3:44:00.540 --> 3:44:02.540]  That's who they've been hiring to run these prisons
[3:44:02.540 --> 3:44:08.140]  Uh is convicted rapists and people they're hiring criminals and when the government starts hiring criminals, you're in trouble
[3:44:08.780 --> 3:44:12.380]  Uh, so uh, you know, that's up to you to make that decision
[3:44:13.100 --> 3:44:17.980]  But yeah, there's a look I mean look at mexico. It's consumed with tens of thousands of murders now
[3:44:18.460 --> 3:44:20.860]  2000 on the texas border alone the last nine months
[3:44:21.660 --> 3:44:28.860]  Uh gringos being kidnapped everywhere and held for ransom the whole society's unraveling the elite have gone completely corrupt
[3:44:28.860 --> 3:44:34.460]  I appreciate your call call me back later. We can talk more about it. I want to get everybody here mark and florida here on the air
[3:44:35.420 --> 3:44:40.860]  Hi, alex great show today. I had two quick questions one about internet two and uh
[3:44:41.820 --> 3:44:45.500]  Marianne and I want to know about uh recently acquired gold
[3:44:45.900 --> 3:44:49.900]  Should we keep it in a safety deposit box or bring it home and keep it in a home safe?
[3:44:50.060 --> 3:44:56.620]  You know, that's there is there is risk in everything and i'm not going to tell people what they should or shouldn't do
[3:44:56.620 --> 3:44:58.620]  Um spreading things out
[3:44:59.980 --> 3:45:03.980]  You know having some in a safety deposit, but they never seize those now now they just steal them
[3:45:04.300 --> 3:45:08.060]  California will just go in and grab a whole banks and say it's for a budget shortfall and just steal everything
[3:45:08.860 --> 3:45:13.100]  You read stuff like that. They just stole everything a little there a little in your house a little buried
[3:45:13.580 --> 3:45:17.020]  Uh, you know, uh, your cousins, but you know, don't tell your cousin
[3:45:17.660 --> 3:45:21.500]  Uh, but the truth is there's a lot of good. I mean, you know spread it around
[3:45:21.820 --> 3:45:25.180]  Most of us don't have the problem of having a lot of it. It's just something
[3:45:25.180 --> 3:45:29.500]  Uh, but uh, that's up to you. I mean, it's just the banks are so untrustworthy
[3:45:29.900 --> 3:45:32.380]  I mean, I think spreading risk is the way to go
[3:45:33.180 --> 3:45:35.820]  I think that's good. Let me ask you about internet two
[3:45:36.300 --> 3:45:43.740]  Suppose things happen the way they do the way they're anticipating it to uh, what about a little uh, I live in an area
[3:45:43.820 --> 3:45:47.980]  Where where I can't get you on the radio or either get it on the internet or I call in like this
[3:45:48.540 --> 3:45:54.460]  What about a little pilot program where uh, I was if I if there was no internet
[3:45:54.460 --> 3:45:58.300]  Like I can copy your show now. I can put five of your shows
[3:45:58.460 --> 3:46:02.140]  Yeah, I've been asking for six months to have a phone system
[3:46:02.380 --> 3:46:06.460]  And and then people can listen to free for it and then have sponsorship
[3:46:07.020 --> 3:46:09.020]  To pay for it. How much is it?
[3:46:09.420 --> 3:46:12.780]  How much is it to say have 500 listeners on a phone system they dial into?
[3:46:14.620 --> 3:46:16.620]  Well, how long till I can have that?
[3:46:18.060 --> 3:46:19.580]  went
[3:46:19.580 --> 3:46:21.580]  25 years from now
[3:46:21.580 --> 3:46:24.060]  Listen, I already want that and and
[3:46:24.940 --> 3:46:28.220]  I want a phone system here where we have like a sponsor
[3:46:28.940 --> 3:46:31.500]  Uh, who you hear recording at the first of it when you call
[3:46:32.300 --> 3:46:36.540]  So that we can pay for that's how radio actually started in europe the first radio before marconi
[3:46:38.060 --> 3:46:44.460]  Uh was phone systems and you called in and you subscribed and uh, they had uh newsreaders there into a big speaker
[3:46:44.540 --> 3:46:46.140]  and you know into a uh
[3:46:46.140 --> 3:46:53.260]  phonograph and and and and and elites paid for that and companies paid for that was a intelligence and uh, we are going to put that in
[3:46:54.300 --> 3:47:00.620]  Uh, and we are going to try to develop a private network for people to get through to the problem is
[3:47:01.020 --> 3:47:03.020]  Here's how they're going to shut the web down. I appreciate your call
[3:47:03.500 --> 3:47:10.460]  They're going to build internet to demonize the first internet tax it regulated let the hubs fail start bringing in
[3:47:11.020 --> 3:47:13.020]  uh filtration which already
[3:47:13.020 --> 3:47:16.140]  Uh, the major cable companies are doing
[3:47:16.940 --> 3:47:18.460]  Time Warner
[3:47:18.460 --> 3:47:20.460]  Comcast others
[3:47:21.420 --> 3:47:27.660]  Most of canada's announced the two big carriers have more than half of canada's customers are saying they're only give you a few thousand sites
[3:47:27.660 --> 3:47:29.660]  You can visit so it's already happening
[3:47:29.900 --> 3:47:34.060]  See we're back to the future. It's now all happening. We're here. The banks are going bust
[3:47:34.140 --> 3:47:36.700]  It's all starting to slide into this is
[3:47:37.020 --> 3:47:41.500]  Beginning the fema camps are opening the cops are strutting around bulging their eyes out at the people
[3:47:41.500 --> 3:47:44.940]  The illegal aliens are running around shooting the place up. I mean it's here
[3:47:45.580 --> 3:47:47.100]  um
[3:47:47.100 --> 3:47:52.140]  The bedlam the corruption the looting the fun the the anarchy by the criminal state
[3:47:54.300 --> 3:47:56.300]  And uh
[3:47:56.940 --> 3:48:01.260]  Yes, you could then dial in over a phone record it and then distribute it to people that way
[3:48:02.460 --> 3:48:07.020]  We could even sell phone subscriptions if we had to but I want to put it out for free
[3:48:07.020 --> 3:48:10.780]  How much is a hundred people continually for a month?
[3:48:12.060 --> 3:48:14.140]  How much a thousand
[3:48:16.460 --> 3:48:23.020]  And five thousand uh, but but I would only pay for what I actually did right well, well, let's make it where I can have uh
[3:48:25.260 --> 3:48:29.820]  Here I'm putting the order in because the thing will be oh, I wasn't told what to put in uh put in 200 lines
[3:48:30.300 --> 3:48:34.620]  I want 200 lines for people to be able to get into it. But isn't that going to be internet-based?
[3:48:34.620 --> 3:48:36.620]  It's not ip-based
[3:48:37.900 --> 3:48:43.100]  It'll be regular phone line based. Okay. I want it. I want it now. Okay done done
[3:48:43.900 --> 3:48:47.500]  Uh, because yeah, no, no, we're getting extra servers. I want four extra servers
[3:48:47.980 --> 3:48:49.180]  Because we're getting ready for this
[3:48:49.180 --> 3:48:53.340]  We're going to try to be here when everything goes to hell in a hand basket at least in some way
[3:48:53.660 --> 3:48:57.900]  Because that's when folks who are really going to be and these callers are all great today. Good goodness gracious
[3:48:58.700 --> 3:49:00.700]  Kitty in New Hampshire. You're on the air
[3:49:00.700 --> 3:49:05.180]  Hello, Alex. Hi. I'd love to hug you if I was there
[3:49:05.740 --> 3:49:09.820]  I have learned a lot from you and one of the things is contract law
[3:49:10.620 --> 3:49:13.580]  Um, I've put it to use in my daily life
[3:49:14.060 --> 3:49:19.260]  Um, now the thing is is I have an issue and I thought I'd like to send you a story
[3:49:19.820 --> 3:49:23.820]  And maybe uh, you would read it. Sure. What's the issue turning the mason?
[3:49:24.620 --> 3:49:28.540]  And a program federal agency called eeoc
[3:49:28.540 --> 3:49:30.540]  ee
[3:49:30.540 --> 3:49:39.100]  Are you familiar with that? Yes, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Um, I was sexually harassed at my place of employment
[3:49:39.500 --> 3:49:41.500]  I was fired for um
[3:49:42.220 --> 3:49:44.060]  filing a claim
[3:49:44.060 --> 3:49:45.500]  and um
[3:49:45.500 --> 3:49:48.620]  Eoc throughout my complaint when I had proof
[3:49:49.260 --> 3:49:53.340]  Factual proof of this and I believe that it was an inside job
[3:49:53.340 --> 3:49:56.700]  What was it? But I mean you're saying the masons. What was he a mason?
[3:49:56.700 --> 3:50:01.420]  I worked at as a nurses aid at a place called the masonic home. It was the nursing home
[3:50:03.580 --> 3:50:09.260]  Well a lot of people get their claims thrown out but but but I mean it's no doubt that in england especially
[3:50:09.660 --> 3:50:11.660]  I mean you just
[3:50:11.660 --> 3:50:17.500]  They do whatever they want. So the whole society's falling apart. Well, the thing is is I had proof that it happened
[3:50:17.980 --> 3:50:19.980]  I had their own admission
[3:50:19.980 --> 3:50:26.940]  And I got a phone call asking me what I wanted monetarily and then said that they would stay there
[3:50:26.940 --> 3:50:28.940]  We're going to talk behind scenes
[3:50:28.940 --> 3:50:34.220]  Sure, I got I got to move quick. I want to hear your story, but I won't get to the others if you don't so I mean bottom line
[3:50:34.220 --> 3:50:35.420]  Uh
[3:50:35.420 --> 3:50:41.420]  They fired you and you didn't get unemployment or what what happened? I the thing is there's eoc's own website
[3:50:41.420 --> 3:50:47.260]  They're not there to help you. They're only there to break up families break up society and turn everybody against each other
[3:50:47.260 --> 3:50:50.060]  All that's just window dressing for fascism
[3:50:50.380 --> 3:50:54.620]  Oh, I understand, but I had their own admission saying it
[3:50:56.300 --> 3:51:01.660]  Well, send me the info then I'll try to look at it. Can you get it? Can we'll give can you give me an address?

[3:51:18.220 --> 3:51:20.220]  I didn't finish earlier with internet too
[3:51:21.020 --> 3:51:23.900]  So they have ways of picking it apart shutting it down restricting it
[3:51:25.100 --> 3:51:28.300]  Culling groups regulating ending that neutrality
[3:51:29.420 --> 3:51:33.100]  Taxing it but also then they can launch a cyber attack
[3:51:33.100 --> 3:51:38.220]  They've conditioned us with the movies claiming terrorists did it and then oh only the new
[3:51:38.860 --> 3:51:43.660]  Stronger better internet internet to with registration and sign-on
[3:51:43.660 --> 3:51:45.660]  registration and sign-on and all this it
[3:51:46.620 --> 3:51:54.540]  It will keep you safe. So internet one has to fully die. So that's how they're going to do it and just prepare for it
[3:51:55.020 --> 3:51:59.580]  Okay, uh, let's go ahead and we shouldn't all throw fits when it happens
[3:51:59.820 --> 3:52:04.300]  We should say see we told you so then work as hard as we can to infiltrate that and take that over
[3:52:05.500 --> 3:52:10.460]  A lot of people, you know give up they get their youtube account suspended. They say I'll never post on you again
[3:52:10.460 --> 3:52:13.980]  That's not the answer. The answer is getting 15 accounts
[3:52:16.060 --> 3:52:19.020]  Let's go and talk to gilbert and tahosh you're on the air gilbert

[3:52:34.780 --> 3:52:37.660]  It was at the school of america's actually and when I got back
[3:52:37.660 --> 3:52:39.660]  I uh, I
[3:52:40.220 --> 3:52:41.820]  It a week and a half later
[3:52:41.820 --> 3:52:45.900]  Did they threw me out of my bank and they didn't want to tell me why and had done business with them for like seven years
[3:52:46.060 --> 3:52:48.780]  And oh, yeah, this part of me. Oh, yeah, you get
[3:52:49.340 --> 3:52:52.060]  Army spooks on you if you go to that fort bending georgia deal
[3:52:52.620 --> 3:52:57.100]  They're now saying it's terrorism if you touch the fence, you know get like 20 years in jail
[3:52:57.100 --> 3:52:59.100]  That's where they train people out of torture
[3:52:59.260 --> 3:53:04.780]  How to rape children and all the rest of that's all come out. That's your government. I guess the good guys according to them
[3:53:04.780 --> 3:53:09.580]  And uh, yeah, that's how they run black ops on you. What else happened to you?
[3:53:10.380 --> 3:53:14.380]  Well, I asked them all if you're going to kick me out can you at least tell me and I talked to the manager
[3:53:14.380 --> 3:53:16.540]  I talked to everybody nobody could tell me why they were kicking me out
[3:53:16.540 --> 3:53:19.100]  They had to I had to wait a week and talk to the person
[3:53:19.660 --> 3:53:21.820]  In love back that was in charge of the entire bank
[3:53:22.220 --> 3:53:26.700]  And then she finally gave me some technicality that I didn't sign a paper one time when I made two deposits
[3:53:26.700 --> 3:53:32.140]  Because I have four businesses in two different sides of the of the city, but my business is a different
[3:53:32.140 --> 3:53:34.780]  No, I hear you. I mean, I mean it might be a coincidence, but
[3:53:35.260 --> 3:53:38.060]  Probably not they want to punish you for political action
[3:53:38.380 --> 3:53:42.220]  So the word gets out so people stop having political action. Here we go final segment
[3:53:48.300 --> 3:53:50.300]  Am I gonna have to go into overdrive
[3:53:51.900 --> 3:53:53.900]  Because I want to get to

[3:53:59.020 --> 3:54:05.980]  Okay, that's an exaggeration like 15 or something and then I've got a book interview. I got to do with my ghost writer
[3:54:07.260 --> 3:54:10.380]  Uh, and I've got these two great sponsors. I want to plug here
[3:54:10.380 --> 3:54:13.500]  So we're just going to go into overdrive to respect these callers
[3:54:13.980 --> 3:54:20.220]  So we can get to all of them. I like this. I like taking phone calls on our own end and just taking them one after the other
[3:54:21.260 --> 3:54:24.860]  It's John's fault that I don't go to him quicker. I'm joking. It's completely my fault
[3:54:24.860 --> 3:54:28.300]  But for some reason when I'm looking at them on screen, I tend to go to them faster
[3:54:30.540 --> 3:54:32.540]  Um

[3:54:47.100 --> 3:54:48.780]  Great material

[3:55:03.660 --> 3:55:07.660]  Doubts about the reliability of the country's food distribution system. You know that there are shortages ahead
[3:55:08.380 --> 3:55:10.620]  You may be even engineered shortages ahead
[3:55:10.940 --> 3:55:15.500]  Which are going to mean soaring prices perhaps even empty store shelves and there's no doubt that's happening
[3:55:15.820 --> 3:55:17.820]  Well, here's what you can do right now

[3:58:53.740 --> 3:58:55.180]  Oh, huh?

[3:59:32.300 --> 3:59:36.940]  And my name's on the top of a government hit list, but they don't want to go out for me till they move on everybody
[3:59:38.220 --> 3:59:40.060]  They want to wait
[3:59:40.060 --> 3:59:42.060]  It's your pension funds. It's your future thereafter
[3:59:43.180 --> 3:59:45.180]  By god, they're going to get them

[4:00:01.580 --> 4:00:03.580]  Go ahead and play that for you
[4:00:08.540 --> 4:00:10.540]  It's al-qaeda wrong for the hills
[4:00:12.060 --> 4:00:15.900]  Police and block uniforms grabbing everybody's children save me from al-qaeda
[4:00:15.900 --> 4:00:21.420]  Help me. Help me. Help me. Take all my rights away. Take my pension funds
[4:00:22.220 --> 4:00:24.220]  Take them. People battle al-qaeda
[4:00:24.940 --> 4:00:26.940]  I love the government
[4:00:27.180 --> 4:00:28.700]  Government's like
[4:00:28.700 --> 4:00:32.140]  That's right. You love the government
[4:00:35.740 --> 4:00:39.580]  I'm just glad we got a great leader like George Debbie Bush
[4:00:39.580 --> 4:00:46.460]  This is how I'm run for you by horizon organic yogurt power packed energy. What keeps me going?
[4:00:47.580 --> 4:00:54.860]  That's a joke. One time I was out somewhere had some orange juice or cranberry juice. I was snappled at a uh
[4:00:57.500 --> 4:00:59.500]  Last year
[4:00:59.900 --> 4:01:05.500]  In new york somebody gives me a snapple and I drink it. You know not worrying of its poison
[4:01:05.500 --> 4:01:12.380]  And I drink it. You know not worrying of its poison and it's like ha ha and I go ha ha and I see a camera on me and I go
[4:01:12.380 --> 4:01:19.740]  Delicious snapple. That's what keeps me going. It was like Alex Jones funded by snapple. He's owned by the company that owns. I mean
[4:01:20.300 --> 4:01:22.300]  Everything else
[4:01:22.300 --> 4:01:38.220]  Now that's a joke. I wouldn't like a rise in organic dairy products is my sponsor though
[4:01:38.220 --> 4:01:40.220]  All right
[4:01:40.220 --> 4:01:58.140]  I'm talking singing after four hours of broadcast
[4:02:31.180 --> 4:02:35.180]  All right enough screwing around let's go to the callers Dave Vinnie Ryan Buckington
[4:02:35.260 --> 4:02:37.740]  That's going to be it Dave in california
[4:02:37.740 --> 4:02:39.740]  Go ahead sir here on the air
[4:02:40.060 --> 4:02:48.940]  Alex, can you can you hear me brother? Absolutely cabler. Okay, right on man. Hey, listen that was perfect break music for what I've got to announce
[4:02:49.420 --> 4:02:53.580]  Um, I've been uh, I've been announcing on other shows, but you I've been trying to get into yours
[4:02:53.580 --> 4:02:56.620]  It's a little difficult because you got so many callers, but thank you so much
[4:02:57.180 --> 4:03:03.180]  For everything you do and I I predict that you will go down in history as the most innovative media person ever
[4:03:03.180 --> 4:03:07.580]  So there you go. I don't know about that. We've just tried to use any tool we can to expose the enemy
[4:03:07.980 --> 4:03:12.220]  Well, put me down as the first person on your list to get one of those phone lines because I you know
[4:03:12.540 --> 4:03:16.700]  They're not going to stop me from listening to what you got to say, man. Well, we'll see if we ever get that
[4:03:17.100 --> 4:03:22.540]  Okay. Well, anyway, so here it is. I'm starting it. You guys have been working so hard and I can't really get out
[4:03:22.540 --> 4:03:26.380]  So I figured well, I'll do something myself and so that you guys don't have to do anything about
[4:03:26.780 --> 4:03:30.220]  And so I'm starting a music contest. I'm supplying all the prizes
[4:03:30.220 --> 4:03:37.580]  It's going to be called the our children will sing great songs to us music contest in honor of richard pearl
[4:03:38.460 --> 4:03:41.340]  Anyway, and uh, you're going to be prevented from doing anything
[4:03:41.900 --> 4:03:48.460]  You can take micro naps if you like, but uh, you know, you've you've done enough. So anyway, here's here's what it's about
[4:03:49.100 --> 4:03:52.860]  I'm putting up one so a one gold ounce and 20 silver ounces
[4:03:53.500 --> 4:03:54.380]  um
[4:03:54.380 --> 4:03:57.580]  To people that want to compose an epic song
[4:03:57.580 --> 4:04:01.340]  It must be about the 9-11 truth movement to qualify
[4:04:01.900 --> 4:04:06.860]  But it the more inclusive the better anybody fighting the new world order the militia folks, you know
[4:04:07.020 --> 4:04:11.820]  All of them the more people you include the more likely you are to win because hopefully this will get wide play
[4:04:12.620 --> 4:04:14.140]  uh
[4:04:14.140 --> 4:04:18.540]  Let's see here a friend told me that maybe I'm looking for an anthem and anthem will be good
[4:04:19.100 --> 4:04:24.860]  But I'm okay. Listen, you happen to get on the day when I'm an overdrive and I'm really behind give us your website
[4:04:24.860 --> 4:04:30.380]  I have no website, but I would like to talk to Aaron and I can give them details. Is that okay if I just mail them in
[4:04:31.020 --> 4:04:34.060]  Sure. I mean you want us to basically run your your your no
[4:04:34.060 --> 4:04:35.100]  I don't want you to run it
[4:04:35.100 --> 4:04:41.260]  The only thing I'm looking for is is a forum where I can have the music uploaded and downloaded to an mp3 format
[4:04:41.260 --> 4:04:44.940]  That's it. Well, hell. I can hardly keep the lights on you. Who carries the trash out around here
[4:04:45.340 --> 4:04:47.820]  But listen, listen, uh, yeah, just drop
[4:04:48.700 --> 4:04:51.340]  Aaron an email will try to put you in contact with somebody but listen
[4:04:51.340 --> 4:04:55.260]  We're not a big organization folks. I know and I appreciate your call Dave
[4:04:55.660 --> 4:04:59.980]  Uh, that's a good idea what you're doing. Uh, Vinnie in california. Vinnie you're on the air
[4:05:00.620 --> 4:05:02.620]  Alex what's happening?
[4:05:02.620 --> 4:05:07.180]  Oh, I'm doing a radio show. I know it's a great one today, man. Great job. You're killing me, dude
[4:05:07.260 --> 4:05:12.300]  And eating refreshing horizon organic. I'll tell you what I'll blab my mouth while you eat for a minute
[4:05:12.380 --> 4:05:14.940]  But real quick shout out to the guy that was wondering where to put his gold
[4:05:14.940 --> 4:05:16.220]  You were trying to be nice to him
[4:05:16.220 --> 4:05:18.540]  But no do not put it in the safety deposit box
[4:05:18.540 --> 4:05:22.060]  Because I as far as I know it's written in the patriot act that they can come in and take it
[4:05:22.060 --> 4:05:25.660]  And I was saying I was saying diversified. I was saying it's up to him what he does
[4:05:25.980 --> 4:05:29.820]  No, you know, that was really good advice on your part. It really was but um, two things real quick
[4:05:29.820 --> 4:05:35.260]  And I'll get out of your hair. Like I said, great show today. First thing is um, I watched this deal on the history channel the other night
[4:05:35.260 --> 4:05:37.580]  And you were on it. I'm surprised you haven't talked more about it
[4:05:37.820 --> 4:05:43.260]  But I'm sitting there and I'm just getting absolutely irate because of all the inconsistencies that the so-called experts had
[4:05:43.260 --> 4:05:50.140]  Yeah, I mean listen, they've aired that two hour hit piece more than I don't think I've heard of as aired like 10 times or something
[4:05:50.380 --> 4:05:55.180]  It airs every month for like the last year sometimes multiple times dailies was probably 20 30 times
[4:05:55.180 --> 4:05:57.500]  I just haven't kept track. It's all this info
[4:05:57.500 --> 4:06:03.020]  They would show the popular mechanics yellow journalism Hearst people in glistening steel
[4:06:03.740 --> 4:06:06.540]  Stainless steel huge windows and fine suits
[4:06:06.940 --> 4:06:12.700]  And it would say expert and then they'd show a physicist and wouldn't say expert and blow the video out the wrong frame rate
[4:06:12.700 --> 4:06:14.700]  With their head all uh, like that
[4:06:15.820 --> 4:06:17.580]  I mean, it was ridiculous
[4:06:17.580 --> 4:06:20.940]  But it was ridiculous because every single point that they try to make from the so-called expert
[4:06:21.020 --> 4:06:25.500]  I mean me the novice that I am I could easily rip that to shred but it also makes people go away
[4:06:25.740 --> 4:06:28.140]  You mean and they know not to trust the media
[4:06:28.300 --> 4:06:32.700]  So see it's gone to the point of backfiring people know it's a bunch of scum liars and twisters
[4:06:32.940 --> 4:06:34.940]  And so they're going I got a two hour special
[4:06:35.020 --> 4:06:40.300]  Sandy people are liars. I better look into it and you know what that that was great though by halfway through instead of being angry
[4:06:40.300 --> 4:06:44.700]  I said, you know what at least at least somebody's talking about or has the guts to put some of these people on it
[4:06:44.700 --> 4:06:48.780]  I really know what they're talking about. So I I had to you know twist my thinking around and go from being
[4:06:48.860 --> 4:06:51.580]  You know angry to happy but so I'm just glad they're playing something
[4:06:51.580 --> 4:06:55.500]  I mean, I think we're I think we're winning this battle my brother. I really do I got one more thing to say
[4:06:55.500 --> 4:06:58.940]  Well, by the way, they've refused to debate me popular mechanics will not debate me
[4:06:58.940 --> 4:07:00.460]  But I called in on a show once
[4:07:00.460 --> 4:07:04.540]  When they were on there and I brought up things like you say that norad never said they intercepted a plane
[4:07:04.780 --> 4:07:06.220]  But one time in their history
[4:07:06.220 --> 4:07:13.100]  But here's Reuters the same expert you use the head spokesman norad saying 160 something times in the year before 9 11
[4:07:13.340 --> 4:07:17.820]  And it's just and then they said 25 of the building was scooped out the final nis report
[4:07:17.980 --> 4:07:26.060]  The nis report discredits them because now it says 25 was not scooped out by the north tower falling into the 47 story building building 7
[4:07:26.300 --> 4:07:29.980]  But see people just hear a government report discredited it
[4:07:30.140 --> 4:07:35.100]  But if you actually read the warren commission it discredits the kennedy if you actually read the nis report
[4:07:35.100 --> 4:07:38.060]  It discredits 9 11. Uh, but go ahead
[4:07:38.780 --> 4:07:41.260]  Okay, no, you're absolutely right and I don't remember the exact number
[4:07:41.260 --> 4:07:43.980]  But that whole 25 percent thing was thrown so much out of proportion
[4:07:43.980 --> 4:07:49.500]  I think it was 25 percent of 10 percent of the building or something like that. There was a real aldeos wasn't that right?
[4:07:49.500 --> 4:07:55.180]  It's all lies. Okay. The black building out in front of the building was it's not for it. It's ridiculous
[4:07:55.180 --> 4:07:57.180]  I know it's freaking child could figure that out
[4:07:57.660 --> 4:08:01.820]  Um, the other thing I wanted to ask you is, uh, you know the day of ron paul's get together there
[4:08:01.820 --> 4:08:05.740]  We had the third party candidates and bob bar dissed him. Did you hear about adam kokesh?
[4:08:05.820 --> 4:08:10.460]  The guy from my rack vets against the war going in there and telling him to his face that he was pulling his endorsement of him
[4:08:10.460 --> 4:08:11.980]  Do you hear about that?
[4:08:11.980 --> 4:08:15.100]  No, I didn't hear about that, but I appreciate your call bob bars
[4:08:15.740 --> 4:08:21.980]  A political advisor says the war's great. He loves bush. He loves the neocons bob bars former cia
[4:08:23.660 --> 4:08:26.860]  And they just know there's a lot of campaign contributions and all of this basically
[4:08:27.420 --> 4:08:29.420]  so bob bar is um
[4:08:29.420 --> 4:08:31.420]  Pretty bad in my book
[4:08:31.660 --> 4:08:33.660]  Pretty darn bad. We've interviewed him a few times
[4:08:34.300 --> 4:08:36.620]  It's not we're not attacking him because he dissed us either
[4:08:37.180 --> 4:08:44.220]  Uh, it's it's that he dissed ron paul and the stuff he's been doing and saying and I'm really ashamed of libertarians bringing him in as their person
[4:08:45.420 --> 4:08:50.700]  But hey, they like thinking they're powerful. That's what it's all about. Uh, let's talk to ryan and oregon ryan. You're on the air
[4:08:51.340 --> 4:08:53.340]  Hi, mr. Jones. How you doing today? Good, sir?
[4:08:53.900 --> 4:08:56.780]  Hey, I was calling about our monetary system. I had uh
[4:08:56.780 --> 4:09:04.700]  Uh served petition on my congressman earl blooming hour here about why is america's money privately owned and not publicly owned as mandated by the united states constitution
[4:09:05.660 --> 4:09:09.500]  I've had all these books and videos and stuff sitting around and I've seen them and burned them and passed them around
[4:09:09.500 --> 4:09:12.620]  So I took all those down there to them and dropped them off and I was calling in just to say
[4:09:13.100 --> 4:09:15.340]  Maybe there's other folks listening got some of those same books
[4:09:16.220 --> 4:09:17.340]  um
[4:09:17.340 --> 4:09:21.100]  I had hansen on the irs congressman george hansen
[4:09:21.740 --> 4:09:23.580]  to harass our people
[4:09:23.580 --> 4:09:27.180]  Give them as much information that is from their own kind from their own congressman
[4:09:27.660 --> 4:09:33.820]  And uh, just start putting these people on the spot. Well, it's it's it's every person you wake up every person you you confront
[4:09:33.900 --> 4:09:39.980]  I appreciate your call the government knows it's criminal. That's why it's hiring swat teams hiring more cops building more prisons
[4:09:40.620 --> 4:09:42.940]  Passing laws for the general public to ensnare us
[4:09:43.580 --> 4:09:45.580]  To go out and eat out our substance
[4:09:45.980 --> 4:09:48.300]  To harass our people's declaration of independence says
[4:09:49.820 --> 4:09:51.660]  They know
[4:09:51.660 --> 4:09:55.740]  And so they're moving against us. Can the military industrial complex eat america?
[4:09:56.220 --> 4:09:58.220]  Will it be able to take over?
[4:09:58.220 --> 4:10:00.220]  That's up to us balls in our court
[4:10:02.140 --> 4:10:08.620]  Buck in texas you're on the air. Hello, alex. Hi buck. Thanks. Uh, uh, long time no talk too
[4:10:08.700 --> 4:10:14.620]  Thanks for waking me up 11 years ago. My life hasn't been the same since good to have you on board my friend
[4:10:14.620 --> 4:10:20.940]  Uh, uh, uh, you know ironically there was another caller just called in about the
[4:10:21.740 --> 4:10:25.260]  Show that was on the history channel had you and uh
[4:10:26.060 --> 4:10:32.460]  Burmese and his bunch and uh calling us all liars and uh thieves and you know
[4:10:33.260 --> 4:10:36.060]  communists and uh, et cetera, but as a main
[4:10:37.260 --> 4:10:42.140]  The main thing I saw was as a filmmaker that they shot us in a different frame rate
[4:10:42.140 --> 4:10:48.220]  They made our skin yellow blew out the video. I mean when when you look at the interviews with uh
[4:10:48.860 --> 4:10:54.700]  With dylan especially his head fills at the screen. It's all yellow and it looks like he's like this
[4:10:55.340 --> 4:10:58.460]  Oh, yeah, I mean they they just pulled out every stop
[4:10:59.260 --> 4:11:06.780]  Oh, absolutely glistening palaces with stainless steel and huge windows. Oh, yeah, and and yeah for them for them
[4:11:07.100 --> 4:11:09.100]  Yeah, it was it was uh, you know
[4:11:09.100 --> 4:11:13.100]  That obvious that they left out the the real point
[4:11:14.220 --> 4:11:17.980]  Listen that guy was there and I said I want to talk about operation north was the official plan

[4:11:41.180 --> 4:11:46.060]  Hey, uh another thing ironically there was a guy called in uh
[4:11:46.700 --> 4:11:51.180]  Said that he had been calling in listening to your show and uh every day
[4:11:51.740 --> 4:11:57.900]  I I tried to get a hold of you when I saw that show advertised because I have no way to record it
[4:11:57.980 --> 4:12:02.860]  I wanted to let you know it was coming on. I I tried it. It's been airing for lucky here
[4:12:02.860 --> 4:12:08.140]  I'm not okay. I didn't know that I hadn't seen it and uh, I even tried to email Weldon
[4:12:08.380 --> 4:12:12.620]  He's a friend of mine and uh, I my my computer was having problems
[4:12:12.620 --> 4:12:15.900]  So I couldn't get through that way and then I tried to call every day
[4:12:16.780 --> 4:12:21.900]  And and then I hear people calling and saying that they're listening to the phone
[4:12:22.460 --> 4:12:29.420]  System to listen to your show. Well, that cuts us callers out that really need to get a hold of you
[4:12:29.420 --> 4:12:33.820]  No, no, no, no, sir. We're not allowing that to happen. So I appreciate your call
[4:12:33.820 --> 4:12:38.460]  Now everyone fighting over the phone lines. Uh, you will put that in correct

[4:12:51.180 --> 4:12:54.700]  They're going to hurt the people so bad they already have and just poor pathetic population
[4:12:55.260 --> 4:12:56.700]  just just
[4:12:56.700 --> 4:13:00.540]  Like this to the guy. Oh, they're gonna help you. All right
[4:13:01.500 --> 4:13:04.460]  Final caller then I got all these calls to make myself
[4:13:05.660 --> 4:13:09.340]  The woods are lovely dark and deep but I have miles to go before I sleep

[4:13:24.300 --> 4:13:31.660]  Uh, let me see real quick 2005. I saw your film martial law changed my whole life as a catalyst for who I the person I've become now

[4:13:39.900 --> 4:13:43.100]  I'm devoted myself. I spent all my money two weeks to go on a video camera
[4:13:43.500 --> 4:13:46.380]  I'm trying to go around capture conversations with people and show
[4:13:46.860 --> 4:13:49.980]  Some more people do more of what you're doing because you can't do it all on your own
[4:13:50.460 --> 4:13:52.460]  and you know, honestly, it's like
[4:13:52.460 --> 4:13:56.140]  No, they don't want to say too and it's too bad that we're not on your radio broadcast, but
[4:13:57.420 --> 4:14:02.860]  There's people out there listening on the internet right now in places of influence places of power politics
[4:14:03.340 --> 4:14:06.940]  You know in media and and they know they're sitting there listening to this show
[4:14:06.940 --> 4:14:10.300]  And they're watching all these little news stories drop to the bottom of the river
[4:14:10.620 --> 4:14:14.940]  And they don't say anything people in places of power and it's time for those people to start standing up
[4:14:14.940 --> 4:14:18.540]  Oh, they're cowards. They're cowards. They do what what they think is safe
[4:14:18.540 --> 4:14:24.460]  And they think it's safest just to sit back and do nothing. They don't understand that attitude is going to bring us to rack and ruin
