[00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:06.111]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:07.892]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.892 --> 00:00:09.632]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.632 --> 00:00:11.213]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.213 --> 00:00:12.773]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.773 --> 00:00:16.975]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:21.036]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:26.260]  We're live Friday the 13th on this August 13th, 2010.
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.264]  Bob Chapman with his once a week visit.
[00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:34.828]  He'll be joining us in the third hour to talk about the deterioration of the economy.
[00:00:34.828 --> 00:00:37.351]  All the latest developments since he joined us last Friday.
[00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:41.134]  We'll have open phones throughout the full transmission today.
[00:00:42.483 --> 00:00:57.456]  Incredibly important information on so many fronts with the top story we're going to be discussing today, dealing with Rand Paul, the Tea Party, and the political realignment happening in this nation.
[00:00:57.456 --> 00:00:58.497]  That's coming up in a moment.
[00:00:59.847 --> 00:01:06.553]  I am a consultant on the television show Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:09.476]  And Jesse was here in town yesterday, but I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:01:09.476 --> 00:01:10.557]  That's why I wasn't here.
[00:01:10.557 --> 00:01:15.342]  And I appreciate Paul Joseph Watson sitting in in the first hour.
[00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:21.447]  And we went to rebroadcast some of the most informative interviews we've done in the last month in the second and third hour.
[00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:31.231]  But let me just say this series coming up in the fall is going to be even more powerful than the record rated first season on True TV.
[00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:35.992]  And I'm sure Ventura will be back on with us in the next few months in the lead up to the show airing.
[00:01:35.992 --> 00:01:42.174]  And we'll be able to break it down a little bit more and tell you a little bit more about some of the incredible adventures.
[00:01:42.174 --> 00:01:47.875]  But this was serious journalism and hardcore investigations we were engaged in.
[00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.896]  And I will just leave it at that.
[00:01:51.186 --> 00:01:52.247]  We're good to go.
[00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:21.938]  But loose lips sink ships, so I won't be talking about the huge investigation we're involved in, spearheaded by Jesse Ventura, until it airs on TruTV, hopefully in the fall.
[00:02:21.938 --> 00:02:24.640]  And then if it doesn't air, we'll be able to tell you about it after that.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.343]  But it's set to, this is bombshell information.
[00:02:29.343 --> 00:02:31.164]  Okay.
[00:02:31.164 --> 00:02:33.246]  I've got a lot of economic news I want to go over.
[00:02:35.207 --> 00:02:39.129]  Even mainstream media is announcing that this is the end of the free Internet as we know it.
[00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:57.136]  It is Internet 2, the takeover of the old web, the end of freedom, the FCC's involved, the Federal Trade Commission's involved, and it's being reported on that Google and Verizon are choking the Internet and basically setting the precedent to phase out the free open Internet as you know it.
[00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:00.938]  And so we'll be discussing that coming up.
[00:03:00.938 --> 00:03:10.884]  We'll also, as I said, get into the economy, the police state, a lot of key health care news, climate and energy and environment news, and some new WikiLeaks developments.
[00:03:10.884 --> 00:03:18.609]  Also, the continued escalation going into high gear towards an attack on Iran set for sometime this fall or winter.
[00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.453]  We hopefully can avert that, but they may stage a Gulf of Tonkin event or other staged terror attack to get that going.
[00:03:25.313 --> 00:03:32.257]  But when we come back from break, I really want people to pay close attention to what I'm about to cover.
[00:03:32.257 --> 00:03:44.183]  Because it's bigger than Rand Paul, it's bigger than the Tea Party, and it also illustrates the dirty tricks, the hoaxes, run by the mainstream media.
[00:03:44.183 --> 00:03:52.427]  Of course you know they claim that he kidnapped and bound and gagged a woman and tried to make her
[00:03:54.462 --> 00:03:56.684]  To use drugs.
[00:03:56.684 --> 00:04:11.094]  And I could tell by the way it was written, and the way the mainstream media jumped on it, and how they wouldn't give the woman's name, and that it was Esquire, a key disinformation outlet, that it was pure propaganda.
[00:04:11.094 --> 00:04:15.417]  And now it is completely confirmed to be a 100% hoax.
[00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:17.259]  Doesn't matter.
[00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:23.924]  Mainstream media is still going, and George Soros publications are still going with it, and Rand Paul,
[00:04:26.636 --> 00:04:45.391]  He needs to know that he needs to file suit Monday against Esquire as a way to force the hoax out in the open because Kentucky media thinks that their viewers and readers are stupid and is still reporting that he kidnapped a woman and it's now admitted to not be true.
[00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:50.475]  I mean this is hardcore evil and they're going to do it more if they get away with it.
[00:04:50.475 --> 00:04:54.839]  He's got for libel and defamation to sue
[00:04:56.451 --> 00:04:58.634]  GQ now!
[00:04:58.634 --> 00:04:59.835]  Be right back.
[00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:04.380]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.725]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:14.112]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.452 --> 00:05:15.213]  It's true.
[00:05:15.213 --> 00:05:20.897]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.897 --> 00:05:24.480]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.204]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.966]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:35.309]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:40.574]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.574 --> 00:05:45.618]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.618 --> 00:05:49.802]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:49.802 --> 00:05:51.584]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:56.188]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:02.633]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:06.435]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:09.317]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:06:09.317 --> 00:06:14.240]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.624]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[00:06:20.624 --> 00:06:26.307]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[00:06:26.307 --> 00:06:30.850]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:39.335]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[00:06:39.335 --> 00:06:41.116]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[00:06:41.536 --> 00:06:43.917]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:43.917 --> 00:06:51.742]  Go to their website online right now, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.

[00:06:59.486 --> 00:07:04.450]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.451]  What have we got?
[00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:07.893]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:07:07.893 --> 00:07:08.914]  A republic.
[00:07:08.914 --> 00:07:11.556]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.818]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:07:13.818 --> 00:07:15.839]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:17.521]  So they think they own our land?
[00:07:17.521 --> 00:07:18.842]  They think they own our water?
[00:07:18.842 --> 00:07:19.462]  Children?
[00:07:19.462 --> 00:07:20.583]  Our education?
[00:07:20.583 --> 00:07:21.424]  Our money?
[00:07:21.424 --> 00:07:25.067]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:07:25.407 --> 00:07:30.392]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:07:30.392 --> 00:07:31.413]  We have the facts.
[00:07:31.413 --> 00:07:32.574]  We have the Constitution.
[00:07:32.574 --> 00:07:33.475]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:07:33.475 --> 00:07:34.376]  We have common law.
[00:07:34.376 --> 00:07:36.898]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:36.898 --> 00:07:40.662]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:07:40.782 --> 00:07:45.724]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:07:45.724 --> 00:07:47.224]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:07:47.224 --> 00:07:48.304]  Don't tread on me.
[00:07:48.304 --> 00:07:55.186]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:08:09.332 --> 00:08:10.914]  This is our land.
[00:08:10.914 --> 00:08:17.280]  These are our people.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.144]  The workers, the strivers, the builders.
[00:08:21.144 --> 00:08:23.967]  These are our people.
[00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:30.594]  Who are they?
[00:08:30.594 --> 00:08:33.434]  They are the Dark Armies.
[00:08:33.434 --> 00:08:37.475]  The dark, murdering armies whose only honor is atrocity.
[00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:38.256]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:08:38.256 --> 00:08:40.196]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:09:01.767 --> 00:09:07.451]  It is Friday the 13th, August 13th, 2010.
[00:09:07.451 --> 00:09:08.912]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:09:08.912 --> 00:09:14.796]  We're going to get into the economy, the military developments with Iran, and so much more today.
[00:09:14.796 --> 00:09:18.278]  But our top story is about GQ.
[00:09:18.278 --> 00:09:25.503]  And there have been other hit pieces by Esquire, The Washington Post, about Rand Paul in the past.
[00:09:25.503 --> 00:09:30.887]  But specifically, Rand Paul needs to instigate litigation against GQ.
[00:09:33.428 --> 00:09:40.053]  Or bare minimum, threaten litigation if they do not correct the hoax that they have run against Rand Paul.
[00:09:40.053 --> 00:09:47.497]  Now, last Saturday, Kurt Nemo wrote a story for InfoWars.com
[00:09:51.277 --> 00:10:20.471]  Detailing the fact that a known, admitted Democratic Party operative, on his own Facebook, on his own MySpace, had gone out and dressed up as a Rand Paul supporter, posing as basically a racist, and wearing a tinfoil hat, and local TV and newspapers ran with the story about him, and the newspaper, one in particular, even shot video of him saying that he was a Rand Paul supporter.
[00:10:21.923 --> 00:10:33.972]  And then he tried to deny it, but then later it came out and they had to admit that he is a Democratic Party operative for Barack Obama and has been caught marching and working with Rand Paul's Democratic challenger.
[00:10:33.972 --> 00:10:35.874]  Now, you may not be in Kentucky.
[00:10:35.874 --> 00:10:38.135]  You're saying, well, why should I care about Rand Paul?
[00:10:38.135 --> 00:10:42.539]  Rand Paul announced that we are coming for you, Washington.
[00:10:42.539 --> 00:10:44.400]  The American people are sick of you.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.121]  We have a message for you.
[00:10:46.121 --> 00:10:47.563]  We're taking America back.
[00:10:48.363 --> 00:10:50.185]  No to your NAFTA and GATT.
[00:10:50.185 --> 00:10:51.966]  No to your carbon taxes.
[00:10:51.966 --> 00:10:53.727]  No to the private Federal Reserve.
[00:10:53.727 --> 00:10:56.930]  His father has a perfect voting record against tyranny.
[00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.512]  Rand is a chip off the old block.
[00:10:59.512 --> 00:11:02.614]  And the Republican Party ran people against him.
[00:11:02.614 --> 00:11:05.156]  Dick Cheney campaigned against Rand Paul.
[00:11:05.156 --> 00:11:11.141]  And Rand Paul, by 20-plus points, devastated the establishment Republican.
[00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:16.944]  And we've seen establishment Democrats losing, like Arlen Specter and others in the primaries.
[00:11:16.944 --> 00:11:33.709]  In every case, the pro-New World Order, pro-establishment Republican or Democrat in the primaries is being defeated in every case but Rick Perry in Texas, and he posed as a patriot there.
[00:11:33.709 --> 00:11:38.371]  He posed as an anti-New World Order individual when he's actually pro-globalist.
[00:11:39.414 --> 00:11:44.816]  I've got to say, as bad as Rick Perry is, he's better than the Democratic opponent, though.
[00:11:44.816 --> 00:11:51.599]  I mean, I'm not into lesser of two evils, but in this case, it certainly is borne out.
[00:11:51.599 --> 00:11:59.963]  The Democratic candidate is openly anti-gun, pro-open border, pro-world government, New World Order all the way, but side issue.
[00:11:59.963 --> 00:12:07.626]  Rand Paul has been set up by the controlled corporate media as the head now, even more than Sarah Palin,
[00:12:08.883 --> 00:12:19.353]  of the awakening, the grassroots realignment that's happening, so that they can destroy him and try to embarrass the political realignment that's happening.
[00:12:19.353 --> 00:12:34.287]  You go to these Tea Parties, it's Democrats, it's Republicans, it's Libertarians, it's third party people, they're anti-Fellow Reserve looting, they're anti-New World Order, they're anti-war predominantly, they're anti-welfare, both corporate and individual.
[00:12:36.052 --> 00:12:39.096]  They understand what's happening.
[00:12:39.096 --> 00:12:43.603]  A lot of my listeners and supporters and viewers are Tea Party members.
[00:12:43.603 --> 00:12:47.148]  You know, Time Magazine, New York Times have pointed that out.
[00:12:47.148 --> 00:12:49.671]  What did Newsweek call me?
[00:12:49.671 --> 00:12:52.095]  The prophet of the Tea Party.
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.084]  So they understand these are individuals that are the enemy of the New World Order.
[00:12:58.084 --> 00:13:04.071]  What is the MIAC and Homeland Security reports that we were given by law enforcement in January of last year show?
[00:13:04.071 --> 00:13:09.436]  The Pentagon, the FBI, local police being federalized, they're being trained
[00:13:10.472 --> 00:13:28.264]  To take on the American people, and they list them as Ron Paul supporters, Bob Barr supporters, Chuck Baldwin supporters, people that want to abolish the IRS, people that want to abolish or audit the Federal Reserve, people that are against the New World Order and global government, which is all now out in the open.
[00:13:28.264 --> 00:13:30.865]  It's Americans that want to be free and sovereign.
[00:13:30.865 --> 00:13:32.466]  We're not left, we're not right.
[00:13:32.466 --> 00:13:33.587]  We want freedom.
[00:13:33.587 --> 00:13:35.168]  We're constitutionalists.
[00:13:35.168 --> 00:13:36.549]  We're truth tellers.
[00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:37.490]  We're freedom lovers.
[00:13:38.916 --> 00:13:41.997]  We're Americans, of all race, colors, and creeds.
[00:13:41.997 --> 00:13:53.180]  And so, there have been countless, even mainstream reports, after we break it and others break it, because our supporters are out there as eyes and ears.
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.401]  They shoot video of it in Portland.
[00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:57.681]  They shoot video of it in Lexington, Kentucky.
[00:13:57.681 --> 00:14:00.082]  They shoot video of it in Dallas, Texas.
[00:14:00.082 --> 00:14:06.844]  They catch video of it in New York, in D.C., where the Black Caucus will walk through the Tea Party trying to start a fight.
[00:14:08.035 --> 00:14:11.359]  The white congressman walking by her being booed just as much.
[00:14:11.359 --> 00:14:14.123]  The black guys walk together to get a photo op.
[00:14:14.123 --> 00:14:16.846]  They have the mainstream media there, MSNBC.
[00:14:16.846 --> 00:14:18.528]  No one yells the N-word.
[00:14:18.528 --> 00:14:20.070]  No one calls them names.
[00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.473]  They lie and say they were and get caught lying.
[00:14:23.234 --> 00:14:37.032]  Democratic Party operatives have been caught with websites that we first exposed nationwide organizing to go out and pose as racist and to wear racist shirts and to call black people names at tea parties.
[00:14:37.032 --> 00:14:37.933]  And that does two things.
[00:14:37.933 --> 00:14:40.917]  That makes black people and Hispanics and other folks
[00:14:41.658 --> 00:14:43.639]  Feel insecure and not go to tea parties.
[00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:50.983]  And then, when some do, white people are nervous and sometimes are then standoffish.
[00:14:50.983 --> 00:14:56.806]  So it's a self-fulfilling prophecy of divide and conquer that is going on here.
[00:14:56.806 --> 00:15:02.029]  And they know exactly what they are doing.
[00:15:02.029 --> 00:15:05.531]  And you see the government and the media saying, you don't want government health care?
[00:15:05.531 --> 00:15:07.112]  You're a racist.
[00:15:07.112 --> 00:15:08.293]  You don't want banker bailouts?
[00:15:08.293 --> 00:15:08.993]  You're a racist.
[00:15:08.993 --> 00:15:10.254]  You don't like Barack Obama?
[00:15:11.785 --> 00:15:16.967]  Having lavish, you know, million-dollar parties all the time with taxpayer money?
[00:15:16.967 --> 00:15:17.707]  You're a racist.
[00:15:17.707 --> 00:15:22.329]  You're not allowed to criticize any of these policies or you are a racist.
[00:15:22.329 --> 00:15:26.770]  So you see them invoking division, invoking racial issues.
[00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:34.333]  That's all Obama did when he gave his speech last week, or I guess earlier in the week, I guess on Monday, here in Austin, Texas.
[00:15:39.614 --> 00:15:58.441]  So they're desperately trying to divide the American people so the offshore banks and corporations that control this country can come in and continue business as usual and finish mopping up what's left of the free market and consolidate it into a globalist monopoly while we're busy fighting with each other over race, religion, color, creed, things like that.
[00:15:58.441 --> 00:16:01.622]  These political diversions, these football issues.
[00:16:01.622 --> 00:16:05.943]  They play monkey in the middle, throwing back and forth above the electorate.
[00:16:05.943 --> 00:16:07.524]  So there's a realignment that's happened.
[00:16:08.973 --> 00:16:12.774]  Let me go back before I get into Rand Paul and why this is so important.
[00:16:12.774 --> 00:16:15.595]  Just setting the table here with some history.
[00:16:15.595 --> 00:16:31.939]  In January, in February, March, April, in those months, you remember that Rick Perry would get up and give a speech at a tea party and be booed off the stage.
[00:16:31.939 --> 00:16:32.699]  Senator Cornyn,
[00:16:33.527 --> 00:16:37.309]  Would get up and give a speech in Dallas or Austin or Houston and be booed off.
[00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:38.670]  But it was only on YouTube.
[00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:43.453]  And we posted it and pointed it out and said, look, the Tea Parties are nonpartisan.
[00:16:43.453 --> 00:16:50.397]  The Tea Parties understand that Bush continue what Clinton did and that Obama continue what Bush did.
[00:16:50.397 --> 00:16:57.382]  But the controlled left media, which is just a cloaking device they put on.
[00:16:57.382 --> 00:16:58.603]  They're not left, they're not right.
[00:16:58.603 --> 00:17:01.544]  They're establishment consolidators of power.
[00:17:01.544 --> 00:17:02.265]  They came out
[00:17:03.826 --> 00:17:26.645]  Starting in Austin, in March, when Lloyd Doggett, one of the biggest globalists in Texas, Congressman Lloyd Doggett, the Congressman got up, he sent letters to his constituents, and I have people that work in my office, one of them whose wife is a Democrat, she got the letter, and I said, please come to the grocery store,
[00:17:28.391 --> 00:17:29.351]  I don't know.
[00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:54.019]  And that was on YouTube and got millions of views.
[00:17:54.019 --> 00:18:04.947]  And MSNBC came out and said, those are Republican Party operatives, those are Republican Party lobbyists who paid for people to come on buses.
[00:18:06.167 --> 00:18:09.088]  And my neighbor was at the grocery store while this was happening.
[00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.068]  It's not true.
[00:18:10.068 --> 00:18:11.449]  And they had to admit that later.
[00:18:11.449 --> 00:18:14.950]  So Fox comes in and plays along and says, yeah, they are Republicans.
[00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.410]  They set up their new Tea Party organizations.
[00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.011]  They hype them, promote them, and try to suck in the Tea Party.
[00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:22.932]  And that worked into early this year.
[00:18:22.932 --> 00:18:25.653]  And then it was all over the news that there was a big split.
[00:18:25.653 --> 00:18:29.814]  And the Tea Party said, no, we're nonpartisan all over the country, and we don't want Republicans taking us over.
[00:18:30.214 --> 00:18:33.255]  And so now they were able to start to take it over.
[00:18:33.255 --> 00:18:37.216]  Then they failed in taking it over in the last six, eight months.
[00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:53.301]  And then a true patriot, a true anti-globalist, a true constitutionalist, Rand Paul, is attacked by the Republican Party, by Dick Cheney campaigning against him, by the Republicans raising money, by the neocon publications viciously attacking Rand.
[00:18:55.319 --> 00:19:01.986]  Then Rand beat, by more than 20 points, his Republican rival, who was even over the Election Commission.
[00:19:01.986 --> 00:19:03.648]  He was the head of elections.
[00:19:03.648 --> 00:19:08.213]  And the board allowed that to happen, but the margin of victory was so big, he lost.
[00:19:09.704 --> 00:19:10.945]  He lost.
[00:19:10.945 --> 00:19:14.429]  Rand Paul won and came out and said, we're coming for the new world order.
[00:19:14.429 --> 00:19:15.450]  We're coming for you.
[00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.392]  I got a message from the Tea Party.
[00:19:17.392 --> 00:19:20.034]  Washington, NAFTA GAD is over.
[00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:21.896]  Your carbon taxes are over.
[00:19:21.896 --> 00:19:23.518]  Your communism is over.
[00:19:23.518 --> 00:19:28.062]  Your takeover of America, your hatred of America, your elitism.
[00:19:28.062 --> 00:19:32.086]  He told it like it was and they went into panic mode and he went on Rachel Maddow.
[00:19:32.907 --> 00:19:34.768]  And he's like, excuse me, there's a delay.
[00:19:34.768 --> 00:19:36.648]  She goes, are you for getting rid of the Civil Rights Act?
[00:19:36.648 --> 00:19:38.529]  And he goes, yes, I can hear you now.
[00:19:38.529 --> 00:19:40.230]  No, I'm not for getting rid of it.
[00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:50.994]  They took, in the transcript, without showing the video, and ran a hoax for a week, nationwide, that he'd say get rid of the Civil Rights Act, when clearly he said, yes, I can hear you now.
[00:19:50.994 --> 00:19:52.054]  No, I'm not for getting rid of it.
[00:19:52.054 --> 00:19:55.496]  They took, yes, I can hear you, as saying that.
[00:19:55.496 --> 00:19:58.977]  Now, we disproved that hoax, but now they're back with even worse ones.
[00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:03.814]  All types of batteries for all types of gadgets.
[00:20:03.814 --> 00:20:04.934]  We'll say it again.

[00:21:02.349 --> 00:21:08.112]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:21:08.112 --> 00:21:20.198]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:21:20.198 --> 00:21:28.462]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:21:28.462 --> 00:21:32.164]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.

[00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:01.991]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:22:01.991 --> 00:22:07.515]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:07.515 --> 00:22:08.055]  I get it.
[00:22:08.055 --> 00:22:17.422]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:22:17.662 --> 00:22:19.082]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:19.082 --> 00:22:27.545]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:27.545 --> 00:22:30.946]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:30.946 --> 00:22:35.208]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:35.208 --> 00:22:36.808]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:36.808 --> 00:22:40.770]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:44.371]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:22:44.591 --> 00:22:45.492]  You should too.
[00:22:45.492 --> 00:22:46.632]  Find out what they know.
[00:22:46.632 --> 00:22:49.934]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.

[00:22:49.994 --> 00:22:50.354]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.354 --> 00:22:50.534]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.543 --> 00:23:04.084]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:23:04.084 --> 00:23:06.385]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:07.245]  Don't!
[00:23:07.245 --> 00:23:10.686]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:23:10.686 --> 00:23:17.807]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:23:17.787 --> 00:23:19.768]  's number one debt secret.
[00:23:19.768 --> 00:23:23.429]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:23:23.849 --> 00:23:26.993]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:23:26.993 --> 00:23:34.361]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:23:34.361 --> 00:23:35.542]  Herb K was right.
[00:23:35.542 --> 00:23:38.586]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:23:38.746 --> 00:23:40.007]  What do you have to lose?
[00:23:40.007 --> 00:23:41.209]  Stop the calls now.
[00:23:41.209 --> 00:23:43.191]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[00:23:43.191 --> 00:23:43.772]  Get Herb K.'
[00:23:43.712 --> 00:23:46.495]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[00:23:46.495 --> 00:23:46.835]  Call 800-405-7850.
[00:23:46.835 --> 00:23:47.436]  That's 800-405-7850.
[00:23:47.436 --> 00:23:47.476]  800-405-7850.
[00:24:07.833 --> 00:24:13.956]  So the establishment, both Republican and Democrat, is panicked and scared to death of Rand Paul.
[00:24:13.956 --> 00:24:28.303]  If he can win, that will turbocharge, supercharge, real candidates who are anti-globalist, pro-US sovereignty and free market, taking over the Republican and, to a lesser extent, Democratic parties.
[00:24:28.303 --> 00:24:34.066]  You have the entire establishment in free fall, they're playing the race card, they're doing everything.
[00:24:34.066 --> 00:24:37.408]  But they didn't just say that he wanted to get rid of the Civil Rights Act when it was a total lie.
[00:24:39.727 --> 00:24:42.828]  When he was being interviewed, he said, yes, yes, I can hear you now.
[00:24:42.828 --> 00:24:43.728]  No, I don't want to get rid of it.
[00:24:43.728 --> 00:24:54.852]  They took the yes, yes, because of the delay and took that in the transcript and just had him saying yes, yes, after she put the question out to him.
[00:24:54.852 --> 00:24:56.393]  They were probably manipulating the audio.
[00:24:56.393 --> 00:24:58.693]  That's the way it looks because he can't hear him.
[00:24:58.693 --> 00:25:00.394]  He's saying, excuse me, I can't hear you.
[00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:05.756]  Then they came out in the last two months and said he's not really an eye doctor.
[00:25:05.756 --> 00:25:06.957]  And then people said, well, what do you mean?
[00:25:06.957 --> 00:25:11.581]  Well, he's not, in 15 years or so, hasn't renewed his local state license.
[00:25:11.581 --> 00:25:13.362]  Well, you don't have to.
[00:25:13.362 --> 00:25:25.211]  And it turns out he created his own state organization because he thinks it's wrong that doctors have to be controlled by these local institutions and be basically shaken down by them for fees.
[00:25:25.211 --> 00:25:29.775]  The truth is he's a top eye doctor, eye surgeon, very well respected.
[00:25:29.775 --> 00:25:30.996]  And so they ran with that hoax.
[00:25:32.471 --> 00:25:34.813]  And then that wasn't enough for them.
[00:25:34.813 --> 00:25:37.475]  So they tried to say he might be a racist with no evidence.
[00:25:37.475 --> 00:25:42.639]  And then they came out Monday in GQ.
[00:25:42.639 --> 00:25:46.001]  To be specific, that's who he needs to at least threaten to sue.
[00:25:46.001 --> 00:25:58.571]  And they came out with a headline that he had bound, gagged, taken a woman, abducted her, kidnapped her, made her use drugs, made her worship water Buddha.
[00:26:00.302 --> 00:26:07.728]  Well, what is in the Washington Post two days ago?
[00:26:07.728 --> 00:26:22.942]  This came out two days ago, but still the Huffington Post and local Kentucky TV and newspapers are still going with this, saying, well, Rand Paul denies that he kidnapped the woman and bound and gagged her and made her use drugs.
[00:26:24.045 --> 00:26:30.719]  Today they're running news articles and TV shows playing on the ignorance or the perceived ignorance.
[00:26:30.719 --> 00:26:32.703]  They think you're stupid in Kentucky.
[00:26:32.703 --> 00:26:34.707]  They think you're not going to go read the Washington Post.
[00:26:35.643 --> 00:26:44.528]  They think they can keep running with this, saying he did this, but she now admits Rand Paul's accuser clarifies kidnapping.
[00:26:44.528 --> 00:26:47.029]  They should have ran the headline that it was a hoax.
[00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:56.014]  The woman who sparked a national firestorm by recounting Rand Paul's youthful indiscretions to GQ magazine is now clarifying her account.
[00:26:56.014 --> 00:27:01.697]  She says she was not kidnapped, that should be the headline, woman not kidnapped, nor forced to do drugs by Paul.
[00:27:04.682 --> 00:27:13.804]  And the intel on this is that it was a big sorority fraternity with hundreds of people at a lakeside party in Waco.
[00:27:13.804 --> 00:27:15.224]  I've been to that lake.
[00:27:15.224 --> 00:27:23.466]  And so there's a party with people drunk, acting stupid, and it turns into Rand Paul kidnapping her.
[00:27:23.466 --> 00:27:26.147]  It turns into Rand Paul making her do drugs.
[00:27:26.147 --> 00:27:28.007]  And she says, now, none of that's true.
[00:27:29.246 --> 00:27:31.728]  Now, you notice she wouldn't say who she was.
[00:27:31.728 --> 00:27:33.570]  That's always a big red flag.
[00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:39.134]  This was 27 years ago.
[00:27:39.134 --> 00:27:43.218]  27 years ago at a fraternity sorority party.
[00:27:43.218 --> 00:27:50.624]  You know, I got invited to fraternity parties, and I went to some of them, and I said, this is not for me.
[00:27:52.068 --> 00:27:58.430]  A bunch of drunk people acting stupid, but that's what most professional people, going to school to be professionals, are part of fraternities and sororities.
[00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:05.593]  I mean, I guess it would have been okay if Rand Paul was at black magic rituals with people being urinated on and masturbating in coffins.
[00:28:05.593 --> 00:28:07.013]  That's admitted skull and bones.
[00:28:07.013 --> 00:28:11.675]  ABC News, and of course they made a movie, The Good Shepherd, that has scenes with
[00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:19.188]  Matt Damon, of course, Robert De Niro directed it and is also in it, and it's very historically accurate.
[00:28:19.188 --> 00:28:21.770]  I mean, it's on record that that goes on at Skull & Bones.
[00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:32.877]  Now, that's a real bizarre secret society, but the media ran the headlines, Paul was part of secret society that kidnapped women, made them use drugs.
[00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:36.199]  They tailored it to go after his constituency.
[00:28:37.145 --> 00:28:47.230]  People that are aware of Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones, New World Order, we don't like Trilateral Commission, we don't like Bilderberg Group, we don't like secret societies, we don't like drug users.
[00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.410]  It was all tailored.
[00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:54.153]  She says now, no, he didn't have her use drugs, didn't ask her to use drugs, he didn't kidnap her.
[00:28:54.153 --> 00:28:56.114]  It was a party.
[00:28:56.114 --> 00:29:03.037]  It was a party where fraternities, and I know that's very popular, they put blindfolds on people and play games.
[00:29:03.037 --> 00:29:04.518]  And it turns out he wasn't involved in that.
[00:29:05.868 --> 00:29:16.812]  Wasn't involved in any of it, his fraternity was, and they basically lied and exaggerated to the 10th power about what happened there.
[00:29:16.812 --> 00:29:24.395]  Rand Paul, with dignity, goes on a few national TV shows and says it's ridiculous, I did not kidnap anybody, this is not true.
[00:29:25.592 --> 00:29:30.356]  And then the Huffington Post runs a headline this morning, Rand Paul runs from TV cameras.
[00:29:30.356 --> 00:29:33.659]  He goes to a Fox studio to do an uplink to New York.
[00:29:33.659 --> 00:29:37.462]  They chase him out of the studio, the local affiliate, saying, you need to talk about this.
[00:29:37.462 --> 00:29:40.604]  He says, it's not true, and thank you.
[00:29:40.604 --> 00:29:43.006]  But I mean, what does this tell you about these people?
[00:29:43.006 --> 00:29:46.569]  The media in Kentucky is still running with this.
[00:29:46.569 --> 00:29:48.931]  They are still reporting this is happening.
[00:29:48.931 --> 00:29:50.692]  We have a way to strike back.
[00:29:50.692 --> 00:29:52.093]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.093 --> 00:29:53.595]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.606 --> 00:29:57.303]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:52.316 --> 00:31:52.977]  Thank you!
[00:31:59.295 --> 00:32:03.838]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:03.838 --> 00:32:04.758]  Number 1.
[00:32:04.758 --> 00:32:08.181]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.181 --> 00:32:09.041]  Number 2.
[00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:13.924]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:13.924 --> 00:32:14.685]  It's true.
[00:32:14.685 --> 00:32:19.548]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:19.548 --> 00:32:20.368]  Number 3.
[00:32:20.368 --> 00:32:23.951]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:23.951 --> 00:32:27.653]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:27.853 --> 00:32:28.653]  Number 4.
[00:32:28.653 --> 00:32:31.414]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.414 --> 00:32:35.095]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.095 --> 00:32:35.895]  Number 5.
[00:32:35.895 --> 00:32:40.036]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.036 --> 00:32:45.078]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.078 --> 00:32:49.259]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:51.040]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:55.641]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:32:56.141 --> 00:33:07.690]  877-327-0365.
[00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:17.658]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:17.658 --> 00:33:22.802]  We've got a way to strike back against the people going to Rand Paul rallies
[00:33:23.715 --> 00:33:36.724]  With racist signs and signs demonizing Hispanics and black people and trying to associate themselves with Rand Paul who were admittedly Barack Obama and Democratic Party operatives on record.
[00:33:36.724 --> 00:33:37.904]  We have their Facebooks.
[00:33:37.904 --> 00:33:40.106]  We have previous news articles about him.
[00:33:40.106 --> 00:33:44.249]  It's happening all over the country, but particularly in Kentucky.
[00:33:44.249 --> 00:33:53.175]  We can counter them for claiming he's kidnapping, you know, women and blindfolding them and gagging them and making them do drugs.
[00:33:54.264 --> 00:33:58.107]  Because what's happening is the Washington Post is trying to cover its butt.
[00:33:58.107 --> 00:34:01.689]  Slate and others are doing retractions.
[00:34:01.689 --> 00:34:03.170]  Here's Slate.
[00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:10.015]  More about Tyler Collins, the man who poses a Rand Paul fan, complete with tinfoil hat.
[00:34:10.015 --> 00:34:10.996]  And of course this came out
[00:34:11.957 --> 00:34:15.960]  Two days ago we reported on this over the weekend and on Monday.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.502]  Good job to our listeners.
[00:34:17.502 --> 00:34:21.885]  Forcing the mainstream media to admit they're involved in disinformation.
[00:34:21.885 --> 00:34:28.070]  That's why they want to start shutting down the alternative media on the web using the FCC and others and the end of net neutrality.
[00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.693]  So the big telecoms can decide what sites you can visit.
[00:34:31.693 --> 00:34:33.315]  This is the Chinese censorship model.
[00:34:34.448 --> 00:34:40.709]  Because we're here, you're here, countering them every step of the way, countering Al Gore and his carbon tax lies.
[00:34:40.709 --> 00:34:48.530]  It's coming out that Obama and Al Gore are set to make billions individually off the carbon taxes and own large stakes and companies to do it.
[00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.831]  And the Chicago Exchange.
[00:34:50.831 --> 00:34:52.131]  And the British Exchange.
[00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:54.191]  The British Exchange is actually owned by Gore.
[00:34:54.191 --> 00:34:56.412]  It's called Gore and Blood.
[00:34:56.412 --> 00:34:59.732]  They got the, as partners, named Blood.
[00:34:59.732 --> 00:35:03.733]  They don't like the fact that we're here pointing out their lies and disinformation.
[00:35:04.741 --> 00:35:07.483]  And so there's a way to strike back against this.
[00:35:07.483 --> 00:35:16.369]  Rand Paul, instead of being classy and just saying it's not true, he needs to have a press conference, go on the offensive and say, I'm sick of the hoaxes.
[00:35:16.369 --> 00:35:26.636]  And people need to know that there's been at least five major national hoaxes that Paul Watson links to that they've run against Rand Paul in the last three months.
[00:35:26.636 --> 00:35:28.197]  And it's only going to get worse.
[00:35:28.197 --> 00:35:34.621]  He's still got his lead in all the major polls of six to ten points, but he's starting to lose some of the points.
[00:35:35.061 --> 00:35:38.204]  Because people hear and they think where there's smoke there's fire.
[00:35:38.204 --> 00:35:40.205]  He's not really a doctor.
[00:35:40.205 --> 00:35:43.127]  He's making women do drugs and kidnapping them.
[00:35:43.127 --> 00:35:44.068]  He's a racist.
[00:35:44.068 --> 00:35:46.129]  He wants to get rid of the Civil Rights Act.
[00:35:46.129 --> 00:35:49.212]  He's got racists at his events.
[00:35:49.212 --> 00:35:52.774]  In every case it's a hundred percent lies.
[00:35:52.774 --> 00:35:54.996]  In every case it is a fraud.
[00:35:57.657 --> 00:36:16.923]  We need to get on the offensive, and Paul Watson has written a detailed report that needs to get out to everyone, especially Kentucky media, radio, TV, and print, and especially the outfits that Paul Watson links to, who are still running with stories that he has racist supporters at his events.
[00:36:17.583 --> 00:36:29.726]  That he's not a doctor, that he said that he was against the Civil Rights Act and wanted to repeal it, which is not true, never said that, and that's admitted, and that he's kidnapped a woman and made her do drugs.
[00:36:29.726 --> 00:36:38.389]  It's a big deal, and I'm not a litigious person, but the few people I've had to sue are folks that would say things like, Alex is a drug dealer, I have proof, totally asinine.
[00:36:40.245 --> 00:36:42.386]  Go to Alex's sister's high school.
[00:36:42.386 --> 00:36:43.647]  This was back when she was still in high school.
[00:36:43.647 --> 00:36:45.028]  She's 14 years younger than me.
[00:36:45.028 --> 00:36:46.389]  Go there and get her.
[00:36:46.389 --> 00:36:47.190]  Police wouldn't do anything.
[00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:48.470]  I had to sue them.
[00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:51.773]  Not the police, but the guy that was doing it.
[00:36:51.773 --> 00:37:00.379]  If somebody comes out and says, I am kidnapping women, I have to sue them because if I don't, people are going to believe that I'm kidnapping women.
[00:37:01.753 --> 00:37:11.443]  I mean, they came out in the Washington Post, and they came out in GQ, and they came out in all these other publications, but it started with GQ, and the woman says that's not what she even told GQ.
[00:37:11.443 --> 00:37:12.664]  Well, that'll all come out in court.
[00:37:14.622 --> 00:37:18.766]  Look, you can say anything you want as long as it's defended by the truth.
[00:37:18.766 --> 00:37:20.768]  That's 100% defense.
[00:37:20.768 --> 00:37:22.730]  Or that you at least believe something.
[00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.112]  But she says she didn't tell them this.
[00:37:25.112 --> 00:37:30.357]  That it was a fraternity party, and that he didn't make her do this, and that he didn't kidnap her.
[00:37:30.357 --> 00:37:31.498]  And that she didn't say that.
[00:37:34.642 --> 00:37:42.029]  Rand Paul, you need to go on the offensive and then use the offensive of exposing this hoax to expose the other hoaxes.
[00:37:42.029 --> 00:37:46.994]  Because Kentucky media and other national media like the Huffington Post, they're still going with it.
[00:37:46.994 --> 00:37:54.021]  Today they've got an article out talking about Rand Paul running away.
[00:37:54.021 --> 00:37:58.386]  Here it is, Rand Paul takes page from Sharon Engel's playbook, runs from reporters.
[00:38:00.492 --> 00:38:04.154]  And it goes on to talk about he will not attempt to dispel allegations.
[00:38:04.154 --> 00:38:17.321]  It says, earlier this week, Paul sat down with Fox interview and attempted to dispel allegations that he forced a female friend to take bong hits, among other charges, during the years he was enrolled as a student at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.
[00:38:17.321 --> 00:38:27.726]  After taping the segment in Lexington, Kentucky at an affiliate for Fox, the GOP hopeful declined an invitation to discuss the controversy with reporters at the local outlet, maybe because they've been running hit pieces.
[00:38:29.755 --> 00:38:37.439]  The video shows Paul attempting to justify his refusal to answer further questions about the controversy that came to light in a recent GQ profile.
[00:38:37.439 --> 00:38:38.479]  And then it goes into him.
[00:38:38.479 --> 00:38:39.500]  He didn't run.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.961]  He says, I'm done with the interview.
[00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:42.681]  I did it with the National Fox.
[00:38:42.681 --> 00:38:43.142]  I'm leaving.
[00:38:43.142 --> 00:38:47.864]  And he tells the guy it's not true and I'm not going to respond to lies.
[00:38:47.864 --> 00:38:50.945]  And they spin that like, ooh, look, he's guilty.
[00:38:50.945 --> 00:38:57.729]  This two days, two days, two days, full days, this came out
[00:38:59.414 --> 00:39:03.677]  Wednesday morning, that it wasn't true.
[00:39:03.677 --> 00:39:05.378]  That it wasn't true.
[00:39:05.378 --> 00:39:06.958]  She says it isn't true.
[00:39:06.958 --> 00:39:08.219]  He didn't kidnap me.
[00:39:08.219 --> 00:39:09.740]  He didn't make me take drugs.
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:11.341]  He didn't ask me to.
[00:39:11.341 --> 00:39:12.642]  I didn't tell GQ that.
[00:39:12.642 --> 00:39:15.884]  They've twisted it.
[00:39:15.884 --> 00:39:16.964]  Now she might have lied to him.
[00:39:16.964 --> 00:39:17.785]  We don't know.
[00:39:17.785 --> 00:39:19.226]  That'll come out in court.
[00:39:19.226 --> 00:39:22.067]  And I know the polls are classy people and they'll say we're taking the high road.
[00:39:23.621 --> 00:39:27.043]  You've got to come out and say, you're in trouble for this!
[00:39:27.043 --> 00:39:34.966]  You don't say... And oh, Rand also, when he's talking to the Fox affiliate people following out of the building, he didn't run, he's being very polite, stops and talks to them.
[00:39:34.966 --> 00:39:39.749]  They've got a hidden camera, see it pointed at the floor.
[00:39:39.749 --> 00:39:43.770]  The reporter's saying, please do an interview while they're running a camera down their side from behind the reporter.
[00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:46.972]  And he says, my wife's really upset about this and it's not true.
[00:39:49.363 --> 00:39:50.343]  My wife's really upset.
[00:39:50.343 --> 00:39:51.884]  You know, he's a man with children.
[00:39:51.884 --> 00:39:54.245]  He's a man with a wife.
[00:39:54.245 --> 00:39:56.206]  He's a classy guy.
[00:39:56.206 --> 00:39:59.187]  He is a top-rated doctor.
[00:39:59.187 --> 00:40:01.068]  Very high up in his class.
[00:40:01.068 --> 00:40:04.329]  They've tried to claim he didn't graduate from college.
[00:40:04.329 --> 00:40:05.670]  What happened is he graduated early.
[00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:09.291]  He placed out like my father did.
[00:40:09.291 --> 00:40:11.172]  My father didn't go to the graduation.
[00:40:11.172 --> 00:40:13.813]  He left a year early.
[00:40:13.813 --> 00:40:18.295]  Because when you're at the top of your class, you go into medical school immediately.
[00:40:20.879 --> 00:40:28.044]  But people who don't have fathers who are professionals or top of their class, they don't know that!
[00:40:28.044 --> 00:40:33.107]  This is the type of hoaxes that they have been running against Rand Paul.
[00:40:33.107 --> 00:40:40.592]  And if they can destroy him, and if they can get away with nationally lying about him kidnapping a woman,
[00:40:41.764 --> 00:40:50.370]  Implying it was sexual, saying he was making her do drugs, and in a secret society worshipping the Water Buddha, if they can get away with that, they can get away with anything.
[00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:58.957]  We need to expose these people, not just have them in the back of the paper, okay, she now backs off those statements.
[00:40:58.957 --> 00:41:01.018]  This shows you how dirty they are.
[00:41:01.018 --> 00:41:02.679]  It shows you how manipulative they are.
[00:41:02.679 --> 00:41:09.785]  Get this article at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and get it out to everyone you know.
[00:41:09.785 --> 00:41:09.925]  The
[00:41:11.733 --> 00:41:18.795]  Infowars.com headline on the same story is, Desperate Establishment's Latest Rand Paul Hoax Backfires.
[00:41:18.795 --> 00:41:25.436]  Desperate Establishment's Latest Rand Paul Hoax Backfires, Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones.
[00:41:25.436 --> 00:41:36.979]  The original article posted just about two hours ago, or an hour and a half ago, at PrisonPlanet.com is, Establishment's Latest Desperate Rand Paul Hoax Explodes in Their Face.
[00:41:36.979 --> 00:41:41.000]  Establishment's Latest Desperate Rand Paul Hoax Explodes in Their Face.
[00:41:43.271 --> 00:41:59.054]  Now I'm not going to sit back and wait for Rand Paul or his classy father, an icon of liberty, who's attacked by COINTELPRO and media from above and below, to sit there and come out and defend themselves.
[00:41:59.054 --> 00:42:00.614]  The best defense is a good offense.
[00:42:00.614 --> 00:42:03.675]  I'm going on the offensive and I'm asking you to go on the offensive.
[00:42:03.675 --> 00:42:04.835]  We're nine for nine.
[00:42:04.835 --> 00:42:07.796]  We've done nine searches the last three weeks.
[00:42:08.749 --> 00:42:13.060]  Where you type in keywords into Google and Yahoo and other search engines.
[00:42:14.161 --> 00:42:34.596]  And where you go on message boards and news sites and where you contact the media with these terms, and then in some cases hundreds of newspapers and blogs and others, it's always over 30 or 40, then write about our report, and it becomes the number one search term, and instead of these articles Watson and I write getting 100,000 viewers in our big stories, they get millions.
[00:42:34.596 --> 00:42:40.741]  And the videos that we simulcast to this radio show get hundreds of thousands of views, and we get on the offensive.
[00:42:42.008 --> 00:42:46.010]  So today I want you to search term three words together.
[00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:48.131]  Rand Paul hoax.
[00:42:48.131 --> 00:42:50.773]  Rand Paul hoax.
[00:42:50.773 --> 00:42:56.375]  R-A-N-D P-A-U-L H-O-A-X.
[00:42:56.375 --> 00:42:57.676]  Three words.
[00:42:57.676 --> 00:43:01.378]  Rand Paul hoax.
[00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:07.901]  And when that becomes the number one search term, masses of people will see this and we will expose GQ,
[00:43:09.124 --> 00:43:11.666]  We will expose the Huffington Post.
[00:43:11.666 --> 00:43:28.036]  We will expose the Louisville Courier-Journal, running videos still and not retracting, the admitted Democratic Party operative, dressed up with an anti-immigrant sign, with a tinfoil hat, making fun of Kentuckians' accents with his elitist, you know,
[00:43:35.356 --> 00:43:37.157]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:43:37.157 --> 00:43:41.340]  Out of an event with thousands of people, they zero in on him.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:49.185]  We get this article that covers all the different hoaxes, and people will read this, and it'll be one more nail in the globalist's credibility.
[00:43:49.185 --> 00:43:55.189]  One more nail in their credibility coffin to show people back-to-back all the hoaxes.
[00:43:55.189 --> 00:43:56.690]  This covers five of the hoaxes.
[00:43:58.339 --> 00:44:00.860]  Five of the hoaxes and the latest.
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:22.844]  I mean, look, if they get away with claiming he kidnapped a woman and gagged her and put a blindfold on her and took her out to a secret ceremony to worship the Water Buddha and made her do drugs when she now admits that's not true and that, quote, GQ lied and twisted it, are they going to say Rand Paul killed Kennedy in 1963 in Dallas at Ely Plaza?
[00:44:22.844 --> 00:44:25.525]  Are they going to say that he blew up the Hindenburg?
[00:44:26.894 --> 00:44:32.138]  Are they going to say that he bombed the main in 1898?
[00:44:32.138 --> 00:44:34.120]  Are they going to say he crucified Christ?
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:39.624]  Are they going to say he was at the Ford Theater and shot Lincoln in the back of the head?
[00:44:39.624 --> 00:44:41.865]  Are they going to say he's a cocaine dealer?
[00:44:41.865 --> 00:44:44.567]  Are they going to say he's a murderer?
[00:44:44.567 --> 00:44:45.768]  I mean, the sky's the limit.
[00:44:45.768 --> 00:44:48.410]  They're already saying he kidnapped a woman and made her do drugs.
[00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.671]  What's next?
[00:44:48.671 --> 00:44:50.072]  They're going to say he's a child molester?
[00:44:50.072 --> 00:44:52.814]  And they're going to say it about other people and get away with it?
[00:44:55.046 --> 00:44:55.526]  What's next?
[00:44:55.526 --> 00:45:01.371]  Are they going to say he knocks old ladies on the heads and mugs people?
[00:45:01.371 --> 00:45:03.472]  They've already said he wanted to get rid of the Civil Rights Act.
[00:45:03.472 --> 00:45:04.153]  Wasn't true.
[00:45:04.153 --> 00:45:05.554]  They've already said he's not a doctor.
[00:45:05.554 --> 00:45:06.134]  Isn't true.
[00:45:06.134 --> 00:45:07.896]  They've already said he didn't graduate from college.
[00:45:07.896 --> 00:45:08.556]  Not true.
[00:45:08.556 --> 00:45:15.241]  They've already said that he's got all these racist supporters when they're the ones staging it in false flag political terror events.
[00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:20.606]  Admitted fraud.
[00:45:20.606 --> 00:45:22.367]  Why are they after him so much?
[00:45:22.367 --> 00:45:23.548]  Because he's important!
[00:45:25.216 --> 00:45:30.599]  Because he is being set up as the leader of the Liberty Movement so they can destroy him.
[00:45:30.599 --> 00:45:36.302]  But if they miscalculate, and if we can hold him up and defend him, it's going to blow up in their face big time.
[00:45:36.302 --> 00:45:39.703]  And it already is starting to blow up in their face.
[00:45:39.703 --> 00:45:50.809]  But they count on people not paying attention, just halfway hearing, oh he doesn't like black people, he's against the Civil Rights Act, he's not really a doctor, he's a fraud, he's not real, he's kidnapping women, he's making them do drugs.
[00:45:52.742 --> 00:46:00.968]  Notice it's all about how he isn't credible, how he's a fraud, how he isn't the real deal, because he is the real deal.
[00:46:00.968 --> 00:46:03.070]  And they're not the real deal.
[00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:04.371]  They don't represent you.
[00:46:04.371 --> 00:46:09.995]  What does COINTELPRO, in conjunction with Foundations and George Soros and Media Matters and mainstream media do to me?
[00:46:09.995 --> 00:46:11.516]  They lie about what I say.
[00:46:11.516 --> 00:46:12.897]  They lie about what I stand for.
[00:46:14.107 --> 00:46:21.537]  They came out and claimed I was praising the Joe Stack attack in the Austin American Statesman and in the New York Daily News within three hours of it happening.
[00:46:21.537 --> 00:46:29.247]  As I predicted, an hour and ten minutes after it happened, happened at about 9.55, I went on air at 11 and said, you watch, they're going to blame it on me.
[00:46:29.247 --> 00:46:30.329]  I decry this event.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.440]  They didn't care.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.480]  Why do they do that?
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:37.741]  Because if the government listens to my phones and Rand Paul's phones, they've assessed us.
[00:46:37.741 --> 00:46:39.021]  They know we're real.
[00:46:39.021 --> 00:46:40.382]  They know Ron Paul's real.
[00:46:40.382 --> 00:46:51.544]  That's why they go, as Cass Sunstein says in the White House memos, and in his law papers written two years ago, he says, we've got to pose as conspiracy theorists to go into their movement and discredit them.
[00:46:51.544 --> 00:46:57.505]  Anybody that's against man-made global warming, anybody that says 9-11's an inside job, we've got to go in and
[00:46:57.585 --> 00:47:02.748]  It poses them, because we have no credibility as the establishment, we've got to cause infighting.
[00:47:02.748 --> 00:47:07.611]  So, everything they do is to destroy Ron Paul, Alex Jones, Rand Paul's credibility.
[00:47:07.611 --> 00:47:15.135]  Everything they do is to say we're not real and we're frauds and we're lies, because we are real.
[00:47:15.135 --> 00:47:17.536]  That's their attack profile.
[00:47:17.536 --> 00:47:18.817]  So please, let's make this.
[00:47:18.817 --> 00:47:19.457]  We've never failed.
[00:47:19.457 --> 00:47:20.758]  This will be 10 for 10.
[00:47:20.758 --> 00:47:23.579]  This is your mission if you choose to accept it.
[00:47:23.579 --> 00:47:26.321]  This is very proactive, something very effective we can do.
[00:47:27.788 --> 00:47:32.252]  Establishment's latest desperate Rand Paul hoax explodes in their face.
[00:47:32.252 --> 00:47:37.397]  Search three words, Rand Paul hoax.
[00:47:37.397 --> 00:47:38.758]  I'm gonna do it myself during the break.
[00:47:38.758 --> 00:47:41.120]  I'm gonna go to Google and Yahoo.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.583]  And I'm asking you to Twitter this out to everybody you know.
[00:47:43.583 --> 00:47:45.024]  I'm asking you to put it on MySpace.
[00:47:45.024 --> 00:47:47.226]  I'm asking you to put it on your Facebook.
[00:47:47.226 --> 00:47:50.049]  I'm asking you to go to the Lexington
[00:47:52.179 --> 00:47:57.340]  Currier Journal and to the other TV stations that we have listed here still lying about him.
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:06.323]  Even days after they know this isn't true, the Huffington Post and others, they're still implying it's true, not telling you that she's reneged.
[00:48:06.323 --> 00:48:16.426]  You need to go to their message boards, their comment pages, you need to send them emails, letters to the editor, and you need to get very aggressive about this and show them
[00:48:17.503 --> 00:48:30.169]  That we're building a case against them and we're showing how they engage in political dirty tricks and political terrorism to demonize and destroy the good name of Rand Paul.
[00:48:30.169 --> 00:48:33.431]  And everybody will learn about it at Rand Paul Hoax.
[00:48:33.431 --> 00:48:35.692]  Rand Paul Hoax.
[00:48:35.692 --> 00:48:39.014]  You search that term and you'll find out he's the real deal.
[00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:41.911]  He's the patriot.
[00:48:41.911 --> 00:48:45.492]  He's the same as he was 20 years ago in interviews on television.
[00:48:45.492 --> 00:48:47.553]  Just like his father, 30-year-old interviews.
[00:48:47.553 --> 00:48:48.914]  It's the same Ron Paul today.
[00:48:48.914 --> 00:48:55.217]  Perfect voting record.
[00:48:55.217 --> 00:48:57.098]  Now is the time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:58.427 --> 00:49:03.290]  To stand up against these people, and to get this article, and especially folks in Kentucky.
[00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:08.393]  You got friends, family, neighbors in Kentucky, call them, email them, write them, make them read this story.
[00:49:08.393 --> 00:49:15.158]  Tell them you're being lied to, you're being hoaxed, so they can get informed and then angry, and so they can go out and tell the people they know.
[00:49:15.158 --> 00:49:16.999]  And even if you don't have friends or family in Kentucky.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.042]  I've got some cousins that have family in Kentucky.
[00:49:23.042 --> 00:49:24.824]  I'm going to call them today.
[00:49:24.824 --> 00:49:26.345]  I mean, I do the big stuff and the little stuff.
[00:49:26.345 --> 00:49:27.226]  It's the little things that matter.
[00:49:27.226 --> 00:49:28.467]  I'm going to ask them to call them.
[00:49:28.467 --> 00:49:37.074]  You can go to the message boards, and you can go to the newspapers, and you can go to the TV stations, you can call into Kentucky Radio, and you can bring up Rand Paul hoax.
[00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:46.302]  Tell people to search that term and find out how it's all a hoax, and the media, two days after, and counting, after it was admittedly a hoax by this lady,
[00:49:47.003 --> 00:49:48.704]  Washington Post admits it.
[00:49:48.704 --> 00:49:49.644]  I went and looked this morning.
[00:49:49.644 --> 00:49:51.945]  No retraction by GQ.
[00:49:51.945 --> 00:49:56.667]  No retraction by the other groups that carried this story.
[00:49:56.667 --> 00:50:00.208]  Oh, they may have, you know, come out in a few weeks in their magazine and have a little blurb.
[00:50:00.208 --> 00:50:05.891]  We ran this story and it was a fraternity party and she exaggerated.
[00:50:05.891 --> 00:50:09.492]  She didn't, you know, he didn't kidnap her and he didn't make her take drugs.
[00:50:09.492 --> 00:50:11.033]  Marijuana.
[00:50:11.033 --> 00:50:11.553]  Bong hits.
[00:50:12.639 --> 00:50:20.664]  That isn't enough, when you run with a big national story, and it's all over the place, and then now I know people are gonna have arguments with Kentuckians.
[00:50:20.664 --> 00:50:22.425]  He is too racist, I heard it!
[00:50:22.425 --> 00:50:27.248]  He is too, he did too kidnap that woman!
[00:50:27.248 --> 00:50:29.349]  And they're playing to the dumbed-down mass.
[00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:30.490]  Are you dumb?
[00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:31.630]  Are you stupid in Kentucky?
[00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:32.311]  I don't think you are.
[00:50:33.814 --> 00:50:34.715]  But they think you are.
[00:50:34.715 --> 00:50:36.035]  They think about this.
[00:50:36.035 --> 00:50:39.057]  They are still reporting this.
[00:50:39.057 --> 00:50:42.279]  But I was going to go for that Rand, but he kidnaps girls.
[00:50:42.279 --> 00:50:43.600]  And he's not a doctor.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.061]  He didn't graduate from college.
[00:50:45.061 --> 00:50:47.402]  He wants to get rid of the Civil Rights Act.
[00:50:47.402 --> 00:50:51.845]  He's got racist supporters at events sent by the Democratic Party on record.
[00:50:51.845 --> 00:50:53.206]  And they're still running with it.
[00:50:53.206 --> 00:50:54.366]  They're still running with it.
[00:50:54.366 --> 00:50:58.369]  So search the term Rand Paul hoax and get Paul Watson's article out to everybody.
[00:51:02.796 --> 00:51:04.017]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:04.017 --> 00:51:06.518]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:06.518 --> 00:51:08.419]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:51:08.419 --> 00:51:15.643]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:15.643 --> 00:51:20.026]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:51:20.026 --> 00:51:30.352]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:51:31.032 --> 00:51:31.592]  We're good to go!
[00:52:00.754 --> 00:52:03.137]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.137 --> 00:52:05.459]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.459 --> 00:52:08.663]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.663 --> 00:52:13.769]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.769 --> 00:52:17.974]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.274 --> 00:52:20.637]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:23.520]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:26.423]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.423 --> 00:52:34.032]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.372 --> 00:52:39.757]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.757 --> 00:52:42.619]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.

[00:53:52.469 --> 00:53:55.031]  Ladies and gentlemen, Rand Paul hoax.
[00:53:55.031 --> 00:53:56.272]  That's the search term.
[00:53:56.272 --> 00:53:58.693]  We do this a few times a week.
[00:53:58.693 --> 00:54:03.096]  This will be our 10th adventure into this.
[00:54:03.096 --> 00:54:03.997]  I want to be clear.
[00:54:21.164 --> 00:54:41.489]  If we let them get away with saying somebody's kidnapping women when she now admits it isn't true, and they're so arrogant and think you're so stupid, that GQ and Huffington Post and other George Soros-affiliated outfits will not retract, the sky's the limit.
[00:54:41.489 --> 00:54:46.990]  They can get away with anything they want.
[00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:48.510]  Rand Paul, I know he's angry.
[00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:49.191]  His wife is hurt.
[00:54:49.191 --> 00:54:50.471]  He should go up there with his wife.
[00:54:52.182 --> 00:54:54.543]  And say we're sick of the lies about being racist.
[00:54:54.543 --> 00:54:56.984]  We're sick of the Democrats sending operatives to our events.
[00:54:56.984 --> 00:54:58.145]  That's confirmed repeatedly.
[00:54:58.145 --> 00:55:01.707]  And posing as racist supporters.
[00:55:01.707 --> 00:55:05.208]  We're sick of people lying about, you know, my medical record.
[00:55:05.208 --> 00:55:09.971]  We're tired of people saying I'm kidnapping women, which has now been admitted to be a hoax.
[00:55:09.971 --> 00:55:12.132]  And we're considering legal action.
[00:55:13.732 --> 00:55:17.755]  And he could go on to say, but why do you think the Democrats and the establishment are doing this?
[00:55:17.755 --> 00:55:30.806]  Because they're scared of our message to rebuild America with sovereignty and to end NAFTA and GATT and to end the carbon taxes and to end all these wars and the rest of it.
[00:55:30.806 --> 00:55:35.630]  Because we've got months and months, what, three months till November, August, September, October.
[00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:40.974]  Yeah, it's about, just about a little less than three months until the election in early November.
[00:55:42.307 --> 00:55:48.691]  And we've got, he's still got a 6 to 10 point lead, but it's not 20 like it was, because people are kind of halfway paying attention.
[00:55:48.691 --> 00:55:55.956]  They see the cover of the paper, he's got racist supporters, he's against the Civil Rights Act, they're just throwing every lie they can.
[00:55:55.956 --> 00:56:00.319]  He's kidnapping women, he's making women do drugs, he's doing secret rituals.
[00:56:00.319 --> 00:56:03.922]  It doesn't matter if a week later, see these newspapers,
[00:56:04.682 --> 00:56:10.803]  And these TV stations, they don't want to admit they ran with a hoax until next week when this story's already had its effect.
[00:56:10.803 --> 00:56:12.304]  We gotta hit them now.
[00:56:12.304 --> 00:56:13.424]  It's Friday.
[00:56:13.424 --> 00:56:15.364]  Going into the weekend.
[00:56:15.364 --> 00:56:23.366]  And they can't stop you going into their message boards and comment sections and letters to the editor and calling talk radio and calling TV stations.
[00:56:23.366 --> 00:56:25.027]  In fact, play a little clip.
[00:56:25.027 --> 00:56:25.867]  This is what the
[00:56:28.775 --> 00:56:37.003]  Newspaper, the Louisville Courier-Journal, decided to run when they were covering, along with their story, a Rand Paul rally last week.
[00:56:37.003 --> 00:56:46.051]  And we pointed out it was a fraud, found his Facebook, we broke it first at InfoWars and Prison Planet, and then now mainstream media has had to admit, okay, the guy works for the Democrats.
[00:56:46.051 --> 00:56:48.694]  And of course he lied on tape later when he got caught and said he didn't.
[00:56:48.694 --> 00:56:49.315]  But here it is.
[00:56:49.315 --> 00:56:52.558]  I had a tinfoil hat to keep the government out of my brain.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.743]  I mean, I have a, I'm a Rand Paul fan.
[00:56:58.743 --> 00:57:01.826]  Let's see, it's a fan.
[00:57:01.826 --> 00:57:03.807]  And then he had a sign bashing illegal aliens.
[00:57:03.807 --> 00:57:14.536]  I got a door of the Explorer Pinata, and I have a sign that says, they take our jobs, they corrupt our children, seal the American dream, Rand Paul 2010.
[00:57:14.536 --> 00:57:17.759]  I'd like to hear what all the politicians have to say.
[00:57:17.759 --> 00:57:21.022]  And then he's got a little image of a Hispanic girl.
[00:57:21.022 --> 00:57:22.103]  Imagine the psychology.
[00:57:23.442 --> 00:57:34.547]  And of course, when you really talk to him and see him in Democratic events, he's very well-spoken, you know, perfectly tailored suit out there, working for Obama and the Democrat candidate running against Paul for the Senate.
[00:57:34.547 --> 00:57:37.208]  He's very well-spoken and very serious.
[00:57:37.208 --> 00:57:40.690]  Meanwhile, look, I got a little Hispanic girl I'm making fun of.
[00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:41.530]  I hate these people.
[00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:43.411]  These people are ruining America.
[00:57:43.411 --> 00:57:45.732]  I love Rand Paul.
[00:57:45.732 --> 00:57:48.113]  Get out of Kentucky if you don't like a southerner's accent.
[00:57:51.863 --> 00:57:54.864]  I mean, you people are sick, and that's what the leftists do.
[00:57:54.864 --> 00:57:59.845]  They prey on blacks, and southerners, and poor people, and Hispanics.
[00:57:59.845 --> 00:58:03.826]  They pose as your friend, and they play the race card for control.
[00:58:03.826 --> 00:58:09.267]  Are we going to see a retraction that that was a staged event by the Louisville Courier-Journal?
[00:58:09.267 --> 00:58:12.988]  Are we going to see this local Fox affiliate demonizing Paul?
[00:58:12.988 --> 00:58:14.889]  We got that clip.
[00:58:14.889 --> 00:58:16.529]  You know, oh, kidnapping women.
[00:58:16.529 --> 00:58:19.890]  He won't respond when he just been on Fox News saying it wasn't true.
[00:58:21.297 --> 00:58:23.538]  Are they going to retract?
[00:58:23.538 --> 00:58:27.321]  Are all these other TV and radio stations and newspapers going to retract?
[00:58:27.321 --> 00:58:30.003]  All the other lies?
[00:58:30.003 --> 00:58:33.365]  Rand Paul hoax, you search that term, cram it down their throat.
[00:58:33.365 --> 00:58:36.927]  We're going to point out what a pack of manipulators you are.
[00:58:36.927 --> 00:58:38.148]  You deserve no credibility.
[00:58:38.148 --> 00:58:42.090]  You think your readers are idiots.

[00:58:53.188 --> 00:58:56.991]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:58:56.991 --> 00:58:59.873]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.

[00:59:53.225 --> 00:59:55.606]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.606 --> 00:59:58.388]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.123 --> 01:00:06.423]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.423 --> 01:00:08.184]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.184 --> 01:00:09.945]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.945 --> 01:00:11.525]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:13.086]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.086 --> 01:00:17.267]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.267 --> 01:00:25.250]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:29.671]  Okay, I'm gonna be getting into the economy, the latest developments with Iran.
[01:00:29.671 --> 01:00:34.173]  Even mainstream news admits the Google-Verizon deal will end the free Internet as we know it.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:43.303]  They've got to shut down the internet because they can't have us responding to their lies and disinformation in the mainstream corporate whore media.
[01:00:43.303 --> 01:00:54.386]  But for the last hour, I've been talking about dirty tricks in politics and how last Monday, GQ Magazine, who deserves to be sued for it, came out and said Rand Paul kidnapped a woman and made her do drugs.
[01:00:54.386 --> 01:00:57.027]  And the way they wrote it, total deception.
[01:00:57.027 --> 01:00:58.468]  It's now admitted it's all lies.
[01:00:58.468 --> 01:00:59.968]  None of it's true.
[01:00:59.968 --> 01:01:02.029]  And the woman's told the Washington Post she didn't even tell them that.
[01:01:03.729 --> 01:01:06.352]  But it shows how dirty these people are.
[01:01:06.352 --> 01:01:16.765]  And now a lot of mainstream media, mainly in Kentucky, where they think folks in Kentucky aren't seeing national news, they're still going with the fact that he's kidnapping women.
[01:01:16.765 --> 01:01:18.066]  Lock up your wives and daughters.
[01:01:18.066 --> 01:01:19.028]  Here comes Rand Paul.
[01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:26.716]  So we are launching a new key search term today so that it links through to Paul Watson and the story I helped write.
[01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:30.399]  Establishment's latest desperate Rand Paul hoax explodes in their face.
[01:01:30.399 --> 01:01:32.661]  Rand Paul hoax is the search term.
[01:01:32.661 --> 01:01:34.603]  And I appreciate everybody taking action with this.
[01:01:34.603 --> 01:01:35.784]  This is a big deal.
[01:01:35.784 --> 01:01:38.125]  I want to open the phones up on any subject you want to discuss but
[01:01:38.826 --> 01:01:43.109]  Yeah, I'm looking at these flashback articles that Watson has posted under this story.
[01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.750]  Flashback!
[01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:47.392]  Former Obama campaigner caught provocateuring his racist Tea Party member.
[01:01:47.392 --> 01:01:48.873]  Flashback!
[01:01:48.873 --> 01:01:51.555]  Rand Paul strikes back at mainstream media smear machine.
[01:01:51.555 --> 01:01:52.496]  Flashback!
[01:01:52.496 --> 01:01:54.958]  The establishment is in full-blown panic over Rand Paul.
[01:01:54.958 --> 01:01:55.939]  Flashback!
[01:01:55.939 --> 01:02:00.162]  Rand Paul survives smear campaign to maintain healthy lead over Conway.
[01:02:00.162 --> 01:02:01.082]  Flashback!
[01:02:01.082 --> 01:02:06.907]  Racist government imposed segregation laws, not two-year-old Rand Paul.
[01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:11.092]  That's just some of the articles detailing all of this.
[01:02:11.092 --> 01:02:13.454]  So we're gonna open the phones up in the next segment.
[01:02:13.454 --> 01:02:15.715]  On any issue you wish to discuss, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:02:15.715 --> 01:02:15.795]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:02:15.795 --> 01:02:22.799]  But what's happening here is, the alternative media, they reported what, a year and a half ago, now gets more visitors in total than all the mainstream media combined.
[01:02:36.716 --> 01:02:42.002]  And our lead is growing, and the mainstream media is imploding.
[01:02:42.002 --> 01:02:44.664]  Newspapers, TV, cable, all of it.
[01:02:44.664 --> 01:02:50.630]  Fox News poses as patriots so they have more than all the other cable shows combined.
[01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:53.593]  Rupert Murdoch understands that.
[01:02:53.593 --> 01:02:57.377]  So they're moving to try to start curtailing and shutting down the web, and that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:02:57.377 --> 01:02:59.680]  A lot of new developments on that front.
[01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:05.273]  And they're also trying to arrest people all over the country for videotaping police in public legal areas.
[01:03:05.273 --> 01:03:06.854]  They don't care if it's a false charge.
[01:03:06.854 --> 01:03:08.555]  They want to intimidate people.
[01:03:08.555 --> 01:03:10.796]  The system is out of control.
[01:03:10.796 --> 01:03:12.797]  The system is going for broke.
[01:03:12.797 --> 01:03:14.658]  So we'll talk about that as well.
[01:03:14.658 --> 01:03:24.603]  But do you agree with me that this is important, what's happening to Rand Paul, and shows how desperate these people are, and how ruthless they are, and how wicked and criminal they are?
[01:03:24.603 --> 01:03:29.646]  It's criminal to come out and say that your neighbor kidnapped you when they didn't.
[01:03:30.888 --> 01:03:34.673]  And bound and gagged you and made you use drugs.
[01:03:34.673 --> 01:03:40.000]  Now, did this woman commit the crime of lying and saying this happened?
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.263]  Reporting a false crime is illegal.
[01:03:42.263 --> 01:03:44.385]  And it's also serious defamation and libel.
[01:03:45.425 --> 01:03:46.406]  Or is she telling the truth?
[01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:51.010]  And I tend to believe her that GQ lied about this and what she said.
[01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:57.597]  That it was a fraternity party at the lake, a bunch of people, and it was sorority fraternity games, blindfolding people, which is standard.
[01:03:57.597 --> 01:04:03.823]  See, they'll take something standard and turn it into secret society, drug use, and kidnapping women.
[01:04:03.823 --> 01:04:05.965]  Rand Paul, cult member.
[01:04:05.965 --> 01:04:07.266]  Remember on Monday?
[01:04:07.266 --> 01:04:08.307]  Secret society.
[01:04:08.307 --> 01:04:10.309]  Tailored to make patriots not like him.
[01:04:11.755 --> 01:04:17.076]  And then over and over again, they come up with lie after lie after lie, and people start saying, well, some of it's gotta be true.
[01:04:17.076 --> 01:04:20.337]  They say he doesn't have a medical license, which isn't true.
[01:04:20.337 --> 01:04:22.818]  They say he didn't graduate from college, admittedly not true.
[01:04:22.818 --> 01:04:24.878]  They say he doesn't like black people, not true.
[01:04:24.878 --> 01:04:27.679]  They say he doesn't like the Civil Rights Act.
[01:04:27.679 --> 01:04:34.020]  He said, no, I'm, you know, not for repealing it.
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:39.082]  They're sending people to pose as racist at his events, that's admitted.
[01:04:39.082 --> 01:04:40.642]  This shows you who these people are.
[01:04:41.971 --> 01:04:45.572]  But the globalists just don't send people to pose as racist at a Patriots event.
[01:04:45.572 --> 01:04:48.093]  They blow up federal buildings to blame it on us.
[01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:50.794]  They stage terror attacks and launch new wars.
[01:04:50.794 --> 01:04:53.914]  This is a microcosm of the big things they do.
[01:04:53.914 --> 01:04:58.676]  They're a bunch of criminal frame-up operators who play the dirtiest tricks imaginable.
[01:05:03.217 --> 01:05:04.519]  Other police action!

[01:05:44.878 --> 01:05:48.441]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:48.441 --> 01:05:50.402]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:50.402 --> 01:05:50.843]  It's here.

[01:08:04.728 --> 01:08:06.391]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:06.391 --> 01:08:07.773]  Government cover-ups.

[01:08:22.114 --> 01:08:24.116]  We are back live, going to your phone calls.
[01:08:24.116 --> 01:08:32.962]  If you just joined us, I got a lot of other financial, military, police, state, internet takeover news coming up, and I want to go to Holly, Dan, Big Cat, James, Joe, others.

[01:08:34.303 --> 01:08:36.545]  My friends, if you, again, just tuned in,
[01:08:45.794 --> 01:08:49.756]  There have been five major hoaxes, all complete lies, run against Rand Paul.
[01:08:49.756 --> 01:08:54.119]  And now they're getting desperate, saying he kidnapped a woman, made her do drugs, did rituals.
[01:08:54.119 --> 01:08:55.900]  Now, admittedly, not true.
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:58.221]  But it's footnotes in the Washington Post.
[01:08:58.221 --> 01:08:59.662]  It's footnotes.
[01:08:59.662 --> 01:09:10.328]  But other Kentucky newspapers, TV, and other national publications, like the Huffington Post, that's bigger than most major newspapers, are saying he's running away from the allegations.
[01:09:11.445 --> 01:09:16.968]  And I want to play this clip and analyze it, and then we are going to go to your phone calls.
[01:09:16.968 --> 01:09:23.411]  But Rand Paul takes Paige from Sharon Angle's playbook, runs from reporters.
[01:09:23.411 --> 01:09:25.833]  This is today, two days after it's admitted.
[01:09:25.833 --> 01:09:26.853]  The woman says, it's not true.
[01:09:26.853 --> 01:09:29.915]  He didn't kidnap me, didn't make me do drugs.
[01:09:29.915 --> 01:09:31.676]  You know, GQ lied about this.
[01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:37.250]  They're still going with it, going, ooh, he's running from this.
[01:09:37.250 --> 01:10:01.658]  He went on that Fox affiliate with Satellite Uplink to New York to be on Fox, where he went on and said it wasn't true, but they took selective clips of him during the interview where Cavuto would ask the question, and then it would cut to their in-camera, not the feed they were sending Fox National, Fox New York, but it would cut to him putting his mic on and putting his head down and sighing to create the psychological vision
[01:10:02.592 --> 01:10:06.814]  In Kentucky, where this is aired, that look at Paul, he's asked, did you do it?
[01:10:06.814 --> 01:10:12.137]  And it's him waiting for the interview.
[01:10:12.137 --> 01:10:17.599]  Just like Rachel Maddow gets him on and says, do you want to repeal the Civil Rights Act?
[01:10:17.599 --> 01:10:19.440]  And he's going, excuse me, I can't hear you.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.541]  Yes, yes, I can hear you now.
[01:10:21.607 --> 01:10:22.167]  Say that again?
[01:10:22.167 --> 01:10:24.388]  No, no, I'm not for getting rid of it.
[01:10:24.388 --> 01:10:28.571]  And they take the transcript, knowing the video shows that he didn't say get rid of the Civil Rights Act.
[01:10:28.571 --> 01:10:36.315]  The transcript is, Rachel Maddow asks, are you for getting rid of the Civil Rights Act, as your person running against you says, and he says yes.
[01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:36.615]  Yes!
[01:10:37.748 --> 01:10:41.330]  Yes, but yes, yes, I can hear you say that again.
[01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:45.532]  They don't show that, just yes, the headline, get rid of the Civil Rights Act.
[01:10:45.532 --> 01:10:47.453]  Rand Paul, yes!
[01:10:47.453 --> 01:10:50.475]  What does Rachel Maddow and MSNBC think of you?
[01:10:50.475 --> 01:10:52.316]  What does the Huffington Post think of you?
[01:10:52.316 --> 01:10:54.777]  What does the local Fox affiliate think of you?
[01:10:54.777 --> 01:11:00.480]  What does the Louisville Courier-Journal and others think of you?
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.802]  The Courier-Journal, I checked this morning before airtime,
[01:11:03.832 --> 01:11:06.454]  A week later, a week ago, it was exposed.
[01:11:06.454 --> 01:11:13.699]  Now the guy admits he's a Democratic Party operative, dressing up, saying, I don't like illegals, or destroying America with a tinfoil hat on.
[01:11:13.699 --> 01:11:15.240]  Admittedly a fraud.
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.661]  Admittedly a hoax.
[01:11:16.661 --> 01:11:19.283]  They're not retracting!
[01:11:19.283 --> 01:11:21.144]  Let me tell you something, folks.
[01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:29.930]  Back last year, when Richard Poplosky was drunk, got home at 3 a.m., he already had one pit bull living with mommy out of the Marine Corps.
[01:11:31.041 --> 01:11:37.984]  Richard Poplosky, this is on record in the court transcripts, and it came out days after the media knew this.
[01:11:37.984 --> 01:11:43.547]  He gets a second dog, he's gone, it uses the bathroom and pees all over the floor.
[01:11:43.547 --> 01:11:48.629]  His mother says, I'm kicking you out if you don't get rid of these dogs.
[01:11:48.629 --> 01:11:51.150]  Then she says, I'm calling the police to throw you out.
[01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:52.191]  He's still drunk at 7am.
[01:11:54.397 --> 01:12:00.909]  The police arrive, he gets his semi-automatic AK-47 and shoots and kills three cops in cold blood.
[01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:09.420]  Within two hours of the standoff beginning and ending, Alex Jones in the Pittsburgh paper.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:10.381]  He loved me.
[01:12:10.381 --> 01:12:13.922]  They had some guy on the street within an hour of it saying he did it for Alex Jones.
[01:12:13.922 --> 01:12:15.562]  Look, completely staged.
[01:12:15.562 --> 01:12:19.143]  Then it came out from the message board that he hated me.
[01:12:19.143 --> 01:12:21.584]  That he said that I was a Zionist agent.
[01:12:21.584 --> 01:12:23.645]  That I was covering up for Israel.
[01:12:23.645 --> 01:12:26.806]  When all we do is criticize Israel when they're warmongering and things.
[01:12:26.806 --> 01:12:28.226]  I'm against attacking Iran.
[01:12:28.226 --> 01:12:29.467]  I was against the Iraq war.
[01:12:29.467 --> 01:12:30.647]  I'm against AIPAC in the lobby.
[01:12:32.179 --> 01:12:44.147]  But he was one of these brainwashed people following the Hal Turner COINTELPRO, admittedly he is FBI, to radicalize the liberty movement and try to make it white supremacist so it's not effective.
[01:12:44.147 --> 01:12:45.368]  What do you see the Democrats doing?
[01:12:45.368 --> 01:12:46.789]  Dressing up like racists.
[01:12:46.789 --> 01:12:48.030]  This is their game plan!
[01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:49.151]  They hate me!
[01:12:49.151 --> 01:12:55.055]  Because I'm waking people up, because I'm for real, I'm bringing blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians together against tyranny.
[01:12:55.055 --> 01:12:58.738]  And I on-air said and sent emails
[01:12:59.915 --> 01:13:09.540]  To Raw Story, and to the Daily Kos, and to that newspaper, and I said, I'm going to have to probably sue you, because I'm in danger with you telling cops nationwide.
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:13.542]  And it turned out the writer basically is the beat reporter for the Southern Property Law Center.
[01:13:13.542 --> 01:13:15.783]  He almost exclusively reports on that.
[01:13:15.783 --> 01:13:17.684]  I said, I'm going to have to file a lawsuit here.
[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:27.003]  And then that same newspaper went in and tried to do copyright claims on me, even showing their articles about me on air, which we defeated.
[01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:28.603]  I had to do a federal filing on it.
[01:13:28.603 --> 01:13:34.666]  They didn't want me to show the article to defend myself about me and say this is wrong.
[01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:36.947]  And I was ready.
[01:13:36.947 --> 01:13:41.408]  You think I want to go get a high-powered lawyer and prepare a case and do it right to make sure I win?
[01:13:41.408 --> 01:13:42.889]  You think I got time for that?
[01:13:42.889 --> 01:13:45.530]  But you can't say that I made a guy kill three cops.
[01:13:46.866 --> 01:13:53.769]  I came within one inch of suing the statesman when they mixed it all together and said some sites are praising Joe Stack's attack.
[01:13:53.769 --> 01:14:00.473]  The Alex Jones blog, and then they had another sentence that made it look like I was for it.
[01:14:00.473 --> 01:14:01.994]  They're after me, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:01.994 --> 01:14:07.196]  They're saying I want cops dead, I want planes to fly into buildings, when it's the opposite of that.
[01:14:07.196 --> 01:14:10.758]  And I got retractions in five newspapers and publications within one day.
[01:14:12.093 --> 01:14:13.134]  Five retractions.
[01:14:13.134 --> 01:14:16.356]  Now Rand Paul needs to demand retractions.
[01:14:16.356 --> 01:14:19.017]  He didn't kidnap anybody!
[01:14:19.017 --> 01:14:22.819]  He didn't blindfold, he didn't gag, he didn't make her use drugs.
[01:14:22.819 --> 01:14:27.722]  She is in the Washington Post today.
[01:14:27.722 --> 01:14:31.525]  And the headline should say, Rand Paul's story was a hoax.
[01:14:31.525 --> 01:14:39.870]  And the Washington Post that ran with it the day of the Esquire report and went along with it and reported it as inflammatory as they could to demonize Rand Paul.
[01:14:42.039 --> 01:14:47.700]  The way they crafted that article.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.960]  They did everything they could.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:50.761]  And what do they do today?
[01:14:50.761 --> 01:14:52.241]  I hope people don't notice this.
[01:14:52.241 --> 01:14:54.701]  The Plum Line, Greg Sargent.
[01:14:54.701 --> 01:14:58.062]  Exclusive, Rand Paul's accuser clarifies kidnapping.
[01:14:58.062 --> 01:15:03.383]  And then it reads her quote, she said, he did not kidnap me or make me use drugs.
[01:15:03.383 --> 01:15:07.464]  It should say, accuser reverses story.
[01:15:07.464 --> 01:15:09.464]  Let me show you a headline that's actually proper.
[01:15:14.434 --> 01:15:15.515]  This is the type of headline.
[01:15:15.515 --> 01:15:17.536]  This is from hot air.
[01:15:17.536 --> 01:15:18.876]  Rand Paul's kidnapped victim.
[01:15:18.876 --> 01:15:20.257]  Oh, by the way, he didn't kidnap me.
[01:15:20.257 --> 01:15:23.839]  And there's other publications saying it's not true.
[01:15:23.839 --> 01:15:25.320]  Because she admits it now.
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:25.880]  And it goes on.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:30.963]  The woman who sparked a national firestorm by recounting Rand Paul's youthful indiscretions.
[01:15:30.963 --> 01:15:32.824]  They're still saying it was indiscretions.
[01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:34.124]  They're not backing off.
[01:15:34.124 --> 01:15:36.286]  The GQ magazine is not clarifying her account.
[01:15:36.286 --> 01:15:38.807]  She says she was not kidnapped nor forced to do drugs by Paul.
[01:15:48.109 --> 01:15:51.550]  And she's going on to say that, I mean, she needs to go public.
[01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:54.130]  She needs to be specific.
[01:15:54.130 --> 01:15:59.331]  You're allowed under the Bill of Rights to face your accuser and not be lynched in the court of public opinion.
[01:15:59.331 --> 01:16:01.831]  Let's go back and go to this local Fox piece, then I'm going to your calls.
[01:16:01.831 --> 01:16:08.333]  Look at this demonization piece where they cut shots of him not even live to make it look like he's hesitating.
[01:16:08.333 --> 01:16:14.214]  And then they say that he ran from them when he said, look, my wife's really hurt by this and it's not true.
[01:16:14.214 --> 01:16:16.534]  And I've done my interview nationally and I'm leaving.
[01:16:17.054 --> 01:16:19.436]  And they spin it like he's running from the allegations.
[01:16:19.436 --> 01:16:23.800]  Here it is.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.601]  Good evening, I'm Marvin Bartlett.
[01:16:25.601 --> 01:16:31.006]  An article in a national publication is putting a lot of attention on Kentucky's Republican candidate for U.S.
[01:16:31.006 --> 01:16:31.887]  Senate.
[01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:36.270]  Rand Paul was in our studio this afternoon to tape an appearance with Fox News.
[01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:39.953]  And Gabriel Rojas spoke with him about what the article alleges, first on Fox.
[01:16:41.758 --> 01:16:45.859]  By now, responding to controversial reports has become commonplace for U.S.
[01:16:45.859 --> 01:16:47.620]  Senate candidate Rand Paul.
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:58.084]  But as he sat in our studio waiting to record a national interview for Fox News, Dr. Paul faced tense moments watching the clock and preparing to control an increasing amount of media damage.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:06.982]  We now have a hundred different media outlets, some who pretend to be real media outlets, saying I kidnapped someone.
[01:17:06.982 --> 01:17:17.105]  It all began with this GQ article, which quotes an anonymous woman claiming when she and Paul were classmates at Baylor University, Paul blindfolded, tied up, and kidnapped her.
[01:17:18.965 --> 01:17:21.846]  What I say is please spare us the details.
[01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:32.330]  The woman, who asked to remain anonymous because she now works as a clinical psychologist, goes on to say Paul tried to force her to take drugs and worship an idol known as Aqua Buddha.
[01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:34.231]  It didn't take long for the story to spread.
[01:17:37.566 --> 01:17:46.660]  Show little short clips of what he said and then show his eyes shifting before the interview so you don't get fully what he's saying to make it look like he's halfway agreeing with this.
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:48.804]  She says no kidnapping, no forced drugs.
[01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:55.016]  It was a party at a lake with sorority fraternity games.
[01:17:55.016 --> 01:18:03.518]  And I'm not into that stuff, but I looked it up, and I remember hearing about it in college, that yes, that's one of the more popular games where the girls tie up the boys and the boys tie up the girls.
[01:18:03.518 --> 01:18:08.198]  So this turns into Rand Paul kidnapped woman, made her do drugs.
[01:18:08.198 --> 01:18:12.939]  I mean, you can't say somebody beat you up or raped you or kidnapped you.
[01:18:12.939 --> 01:18:13.920]  You get in trouble for that.
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.780]  You can't say somebody robbed a bank if they didn't.
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:20.262]  And GQ, this woman probably did have what she said spun.
[01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:23.784]  They need to retract big time, not some minor footnote.
[01:18:23.784 --> 01:18:26.545]  All right, I'm done talking about this.
[01:18:26.545 --> 01:18:31.107]  We're gonna go to Holly, Dan, Big Cat, James, Joe, and others.
[01:18:31.107 --> 01:18:35.269]  1-800-259-9231 on the other side of this break.
[01:18:35.269 --> 01:18:42.433]  I briefly want to remind folks that we're in an info war and that we're doing specials that end in a week.
[01:18:43.951 --> 01:18:46.012]  And the Obama Deception Special is over now.
[01:18:46.012 --> 01:18:49.093]  This new special is three of our newest and most important films.
[01:18:49.093 --> 01:18:51.793]  Invisible Empire, New Order Defined by Jason Bermas.
[01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:53.374]  Breaking down their whole history and operations.
[01:18:53.374 --> 01:18:55.135]  Follow the Republic.
[01:18:55.135 --> 01:18:57.135]  And of course, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:18:57.135 --> 01:19:04.718]  You want to understand the total FEMA takeover of local law enforcement, police, every sheriff, every police officer, every sheriff's deputy needs to see this film.
[01:19:04.718 --> 01:19:05.598]  Buy one copy.

[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:12.203]  Buy two, get eight free, buy one, get three free.
[01:19:12.203 --> 01:19:14.584]  It's gonna be over in a week.
[01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:17.166]  Infowars.com.

[01:19:56.003 --> 01:19:58.924]  I couldn't do any of it without you, and so I want to thank you all.
[01:20:02.537 --> 01:20:04.281]  What is a wind generator?
[01:20:04.281 --> 01:20:06.687]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[01:20:06.687 --> 01:20:10.055]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:12.000]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?

[01:21:01.243 --> 01:21:05.265]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:21:45.337 --> 01:21:47.778]  Look for Max, the Orange Home Gain Gorilla.
[01:21:47.978 --> 01:21:48.479]  We're good.
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:04.624]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:22:04.624 --> 01:22:06.045]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:22:06.045 --> 01:22:09.909]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:22:09.909 --> 01:22:12.832]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:22:12.832 --> 01:22:14.894]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:22:14.894 --> 01:22:17.196]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:22:18.257 --> 01:22:22.038]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:22:22.038 --> 01:22:23.919]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:22:33.942 --> 01:22:36.022]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:22:36.022 --> 01:22:38.583]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.

[01:22:41.563 --> 01:22:42.284]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[01:22:42.284 --> 01:22:45.004]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[01:22:45.004 --> 01:22:45.664]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[01:22:59.767 --> 01:23:02.290]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:23:02.290 --> 01:23:05.853]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[01:23:05.853 --> 01:23:14.362]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:23:14.362 --> 01:23:19.166]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food.
[01:23:19.827 --> 01:23:25.450]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:33.494]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness and put up tons of free food, too.
[01:23:33.494 --> 01:23:38.936]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[01:23:38.936 --> 01:23:40.157]  Our foods are their enemy.
[01:23:40.757 --> 01:23:46.603]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[01:23:46.603 --> 01:23:49.586]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[01:23:49.586 --> 01:23:52.849]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[01:23:52.849 --> 01:23:54.330]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence!
[01:24:07.256 --> 01:24:08.318]  Okay, we're back live.
[01:24:08.318 --> 01:24:10.020]  Let's go to Holly in Colorado.
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:10.942]  Holly, thanks for holding.
[01:24:10.942 --> 01:24:11.583]  You're on the air.
[01:24:11.583 --> 01:24:13.486]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[01:24:13.486 --> 01:24:19.155]  I recently received a community health survey from the county I live in, and I was wondering if you'd ever heard
[01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:20.170]  I think so.
[01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:40.334]  I don't
[01:24:58.434 --> 01:25:00.535]  Uh, does mommy smoke marijuana?
[01:25:00.535 --> 01:25:03.177]  They're turning basically all the professionals into spies.
[01:25:03.177 --> 01:25:06.459]  It's part of Top Secret USA that the Washington Post reported on.
[01:25:06.459 --> 01:25:08.580]  Uh, but yes, I'm aware of those surveys.
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:11.221]  I mean, what particularly does it say, Holly?
[01:25:11.221 --> 01:25:20.767]  Well, um, of course, they want to know if you had your seasonal flu vaccination shot or missed, or your H1N1 swine flu shot or missed.
[01:25:20.767 --> 01:25:24.409]  The other one, um, it asked you if you had during the past 30 days
[01:25:25.749 --> 01:25:30.572]  Not buckled your child into a safety seat or booster seat?
[01:25:30.572 --> 01:25:31.592]  You know what that's done for?
[01:25:31.592 --> 01:25:34.834]  If you say yes on that, CPS is coming.
[01:25:34.834 --> 01:25:36.395]  And it's all CPS related.
[01:25:36.395 --> 01:25:38.116]  That is outrageous.
[01:25:38.116 --> 01:25:39.737]  Where are you in Colorado?
[01:25:39.737 --> 01:25:40.837]  I'm in Well County.
[01:25:40.837 --> 01:25:43.559]  I live in a little town called Lock Bowie.
[01:25:43.559 --> 01:25:49.162]  Can you scan that and email it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com?
[01:25:49.659 --> 01:25:51.560]  Yes, I'll have my husband do that.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:55.603]  We have dial-up internet, so we're kind of backwards here.
[01:25:55.603 --> 01:25:57.664]  Well, you can mail it.
[01:25:57.664 --> 01:26:04.067]  Take your name off of it or whatever, your address, but mail it to PLBOX19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[01:26:04.067 --> 01:26:06.649]  Do you have a pen and paper in front of you?
[01:26:06.649 --> 01:26:08.010]  Let me grab one, I do.
[01:26:08.564 --> 01:26:10.965]  Because you notice, folks, we don't screen calls.
[01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:12.386]  She called in, she said, have you heard of this?
[01:26:12.386 --> 01:26:14.227]  And I said, yeah, it's CPS.
[01:26:14.227 --> 01:26:15.648]  They're going to ask about your kids.
[01:26:15.648 --> 01:26:16.829]  They're going to ask about shots.
[01:26:16.829 --> 01:26:18.690]  They're going to ask other questions.
[01:26:18.690 --> 01:26:20.391]  And it's like they're wolves.
[01:26:20.391 --> 01:26:21.632]  And a lot of state police are nice.
[01:26:21.632 --> 01:26:22.432]  They've pulled me over.
[01:26:22.432 --> 01:26:25.194]  I've been in a wreck, and they've been real nice.
[01:26:25.194 --> 01:26:32.018]  But driving to Port Aransas a few years ago, I guess four years ago, I had two children then.
[01:26:32.018 --> 01:26:34.339]  We hadn't had our wonderful third yet.
[01:26:34.339 --> 01:26:36.480]  And I was going two miles over the speed limit.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:37.421]  They still pulled me over.
[01:26:38.488 --> 01:26:42.410]  And they came over, and the guy had horrible green teeth and horrible breath, and he had a woman with him.
[01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:45.451]  It was a male and female team.
[01:26:45.451 --> 01:26:49.173]  And my children were both asleep in the back seat in their seats, fully buckled in.
[01:26:49.173 --> 01:26:50.794]  They said, we want to examine these.
[01:26:50.794 --> 01:26:52.955]  Looks like you've got this done wrong.
[01:26:52.955 --> 01:26:55.016]  And of course, then I said, listen.
[01:26:55.016 --> 01:26:56.516]  You can see it's all buckled in right.
[01:26:56.516 --> 01:26:57.837]  They wanted to check the understrap.
[01:26:57.837 --> 01:27:02.679]  They were real wolf-like, looking at us like we were ham sandwiches or something.
[01:27:02.679 --> 01:27:04.060]  And this is what they do.
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:06.601]  And they're just training them that you're bad, you're a criminal.
[01:27:07.541 --> 01:27:12.444]  Ma'am, I've actually seen these before, even in Texas, so it's like a little survey.
[01:27:12.444 --> 01:27:15.305]  Oh, did you not buckle your child in?
[01:27:15.305 --> 01:27:17.766]  And they're not telling you this is a police interview.
[01:27:17.766 --> 01:27:22.909]  And let me guess, the letter probably implies that you're supposed to fill it out.
[01:27:22.909 --> 01:27:24.950]  Do you have it in front of you?
[01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:25.250]  I do.
[01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:29.472]  It does say it's voluntary, but I thought it was ridiculous.
[01:27:29.472 --> 01:27:32.974]  It's ten pages, and then on the very next page, after it asks you if you
[01:27:33.464 --> 01:27:35.024]  Well, you know what that's for.
[01:27:35.024 --> 01:27:46.987]  A lot of times you'll have a husband and wife that are fighting with each other, that are on the verge of divorce, and they'll do that to break up the family, and the woman or the man will fill it out and say, yeah, my wife
[01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:13.457]  You know, let them ride in the back of the pickup truck down the dirt road to the pond, and boom, you're gonna have police, your kids are gone, and it's just high five, nothing like getting the prisoners.
[01:28:13.457 --> 01:28:21.422]  And this is a form of, like, the Catholic Church using confession to control and spy on people in the old days, you know, kind of during the dark ages.
[01:28:21.422 --> 01:28:31.989]  This is something that they do, and yes, it's federally funded or sometimes private foundations, and they'll send CPS if you say, yeah, I've been depressed lately.
[01:28:31.989 --> 01:28:32.730]  And also,
[01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:36.372]  The Fed said this in 2000 and 2010.
[01:28:36.372 --> 01:28:45.799]  They want to make first censuses yearly, then monthly, then weekly under the local health department, and then you're going to get home visits.
[01:28:45.799 --> 01:28:48.961]  Already if you're in Head Start, you get three visits a year by CPS.
[01:28:48.961 --> 01:28:56.847]  And it's just training you that they come to your house, you line up, they come in and inspect, you're a prisoner, the government owns your house, owns your children.
[01:28:56.847 --> 01:28:58.588]  But that's par for the course, ma'am.
[01:28:59.813 --> 01:29:01.636]  Well, I thought you'd be interested in it.
[01:29:01.636 --> 01:29:03.178]  And could you give me your address again?
[01:29:03.178 --> 01:29:04.279]  I'll mail it to you.
[01:29:04.279 --> 01:29:04.760]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:09.487]  And again, black out your name, but I do want the... It's probably got, what, an identification barcode, correct?
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:11.661]  It does in RHS.
[01:29:11.661 --> 01:29:12.522]  I'll black it out.
[01:29:29.935 --> 01:29:32.316]  Do not respond to them, obviously.
[01:29:32.316 --> 01:29:34.477]  That's why you can't respond to the Census.
[01:29:34.477 --> 01:29:40.600]  It's constitutional to ask how many people live here, but they nexus it in with these eugenic surveillance boards.
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.641]  This is part of the Threat Fusion Centers.
[01:29:42.641 --> 01:29:43.561]  God bless you, Holly.
[01:29:43.561 --> 01:29:44.502]  Glad you called.
[01:29:44.502 --> 01:29:45.442]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:29:45.442 --> 01:29:46.963]  Something special after the break.
[01:29:46.963 --> 01:29:50.985]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:52.405]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.405 --> 01:29:54.907]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.907 --> 01:29:57.588]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.267 --> 01:30:04.810]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:04.810 --> 01:30:05.731]  Number 1.
[01:30:05.731 --> 01:30:09.153]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.153 --> 01:30:10.014]  Number 2.
[01:30:10.014 --> 01:30:14.917]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:14.917 --> 01:30:15.657]  It's true.
[01:30:15.657 --> 01:30:20.521]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.521 --> 01:30:21.361]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.361 --> 01:30:24.943]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:24.943 --> 01:30:28.646]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.846 --> 01:30:29.627]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.627 --> 01:30:32.390]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:36.074]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.074 --> 01:30:36.874]  Number 5.
[01:30:36.874 --> 01:30:41.019]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.019 --> 01:30:45.784]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:31:10.706 --> 01:31:18.089]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:31:18.089 --> 01:31:22.632]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:31:35.883 --> 01:31:42.029]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:31:42.649 --> 01:31:46.531]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:33:05.697 --> 01:33:10.461]  Hi, this is former Governor Jesse Ventura, and this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:10.461 --> 01:33:23.713]  I recommend you all pay attention to Alex, because Alex and I are teaming up again this fall for a second season of Conspiracy Theory, where we will attempt to get to the bottom of these conspiracies.
[01:33:23.713 --> 01:33:26.475]  Until then, keep watching and listening to Alex.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:35.802]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:33:35.802 --> 01:33:40.604]  In the heart of the resistance, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:40.604 --> 01:33:50.549]  Yeah, if you're a prison wanted dot TV viewer, it was Jesse sitting in this chair yesterday before he left Austin.
[01:33:50.549 --> 01:33:58.033]  And no, I can't tell you all Jesse was here, but then I'm a consultant and also appear in some of the episodes and that we're working together.
[01:33:59.389 --> 01:33:59.509]  I'm
[01:34:20.583 --> 01:34:35.010]  Stories that he was here in Austin working on with me that we're gonna put up next week for prison planet TV viewers And of course air here on the radio show, but that's coming up next week an interview I did with Jesse in between some of the investigations that we were doing while we were in the car
[01:34:36.462 --> 01:34:40.204]  But there's Governor Jesse Ventura right here in this chair.
[01:34:40.204 --> 01:34:43.126]  It's his second visit here to Austin to see me.
[01:34:43.126 --> 01:34:45.167]  He came out, I guess, about two years ago.
[01:34:45.167 --> 01:34:46.387]  Well, no, it's the third visit.
[01:34:46.387 --> 01:34:50.810]  I met him in Austin, actually San Antonio, originally four years ago, four and a half years ago.
[01:34:51.758 --> 01:34:53.759]  And boy, he is really a smart guy.
[01:34:53.759 --> 01:34:59.080]  In person, he's intelligent, well-spoken on television, and is governor.
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:01.461]  But in person, he's just a really interesting guy.
[01:35:01.461 --> 01:35:02.742]  What a character.
[01:35:02.742 --> 01:35:05.963]  And more and more, looking at him and talking to him, I recognize something.
[01:35:05.963 --> 01:35:09.284]  Because I hadn't watched John Wayne movies in probably ten years.
[01:35:09.284 --> 01:35:12.645]  In the last few months, I saw a couple John Wayne films.
[01:35:13.686 --> 01:35:17.969]  And the mannerisms, and the way his eyes look, and the way he talks.
[01:35:17.969 --> 01:35:21.731]  I was kind of looking at him going, wait a minute, you kind of look a little bit like John Wayne in a weird way.
[01:35:21.731 --> 01:35:24.693]  And he goes, you know, I was told that by a big Hollywood producer.
[01:35:24.693 --> 01:35:28.776]  They said if John Wayne had been alive while you were in Hollywood, you'd have been in all their movies.
[01:35:28.776 --> 01:35:33.820]  I've actually been told that by one of the directors that worked with John Wayne.
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:36.340]  So he's just such a character.
[01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:38.041]  Okay, let's continue with your calls.
[01:35:38.041 --> 01:35:42.082]  What a chilling comment from Holly.
[01:35:42.082 --> 01:35:45.923]  And you notice before she even started talking, she said, do you get these health department surveys?
[01:35:45.923 --> 01:35:48.183]  And I said, yeah, it's asking, do you vaccinate?
[01:35:48.183 --> 01:35:51.924]  Do you have guns?
[01:35:51.924 --> 01:35:54.165]  Do you have your kids in seat belts, mental health stuff?
[01:35:54.165 --> 01:35:55.325]  It's all standard.
[01:35:55.325 --> 01:35:58.966]  And I've told you this, the doctors aren't even conscious of this.
[01:35:58.966 --> 01:36:02.367]  The first time I went to the hospital for my wife to give birth to my son,
[01:36:04.264 --> 01:36:08.348]  The head nurse said, will you please take these papers downstairs for me?
[01:36:08.348 --> 01:36:09.509]  And I said, sure.
[01:36:09.509 --> 01:36:13.312]  I came back, my wife went, and she's sitting there with her water broke, going into labor.
[01:36:13.312 --> 01:36:18.197]  She goes, they were asking me if we have guns or if, you know, there's any family violence.
[01:36:18.197 --> 01:36:21.299]  And obviously, you know, there's guns, but there's no family violence.
[01:36:21.299 --> 01:36:23.081]  And I said, yeah.
[01:36:23.081 --> 01:36:26.084]  And then I, of course, experienced that the next two times.
[01:36:26.084 --> 01:36:28.766]  But by the second, I said, you want me to take this file?
[01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:34.827]  Downstairs for you while you do the health department deed, lady.
[01:36:34.827 --> 01:36:37.368]  She went, I know about your show.
[01:36:37.368 --> 01:36:38.749]  Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[01:36:38.749 --> 01:36:39.749]  And you do this with everybody?
[01:36:39.749 --> 01:36:41.650]  Well, yeah, I do.
[01:36:41.650 --> 01:36:46.833]  And then the other nurses were in there, you know, when they're washing the baby, you know, getting them ready and all that.
[01:36:46.833 --> 01:36:49.854]  And, you know, you have to say, no, I don't want the vaccine, sign a form.
[01:36:49.854 --> 01:36:51.775]  They're like, we don't vaccinate either.
[01:36:51.775 --> 01:36:52.936]  We know it's bad.
[01:36:52.936 --> 01:36:53.276]  Yeah.
[01:36:53.276 --> 01:36:54.637]  A lot of parents are saying no.
[01:36:54.637 --> 01:36:56.318]  Sometimes half of them, depending on the week,
[01:36:57.498 --> 01:37:02.281]  So, you're totally vulnerable, wheeling your wife in.
[01:37:05.172 --> 01:37:08.534]  And, you know, because they make them get in a wheelchair once you, you know, get to the hospital.
[01:37:08.534 --> 01:37:12.415]  And it's like loving doctors and nurses, and we actually are friends with the doctor.
[01:37:12.415 --> 01:37:16.177]  She's a great lady and a patriot and watches the show, listens to the show.
[01:37:16.177 --> 01:37:18.238]  But it still doesn't matter.
[01:37:18.238 --> 01:37:24.321]  The nurses and everybody have these computer laptops and screens on the walls, and they're just, you got plenty of money?
[01:37:24.321 --> 01:37:25.461]  Are you having financial trouble?
[01:37:25.461 --> 01:37:28.842]  Because that's neglect or, you know, in danger if you don't.
[01:37:28.842 --> 01:37:30.123]  You taking all your shots?
[01:37:30.123 --> 01:37:30.963]  You got guns?
[01:37:30.963 --> 01:37:32.724]  Is your husband beating you?
[01:37:32.724 --> 01:37:34.125]  Come on, you can tell me, honey.
[01:37:35.538 --> 01:37:41.523]  Of course, they don't tell you, this hospital's gonna get a big cut of that 300 grand off your kid.
[01:37:41.523 --> 01:37:43.765]  White babies are going for a lot.
[01:37:43.765 --> 01:37:44.886]  They don't tell you that.
[01:37:44.886 --> 01:37:50.690]  You know, when the cops come and say, we want to question you, you know you've got your 5th Amendment, your 4th Amendment.
[01:37:50.690 --> 01:37:55.654]  They don't tell you this when your kid's at school and the gym teacher's looking for bruises on their knees.
[01:37:55.654 --> 01:37:56.575]  What kids don't have bruises?
[01:37:56.575 --> 01:37:59.017]  And they take your kid in and go, mommy beat you?
[01:37:59.017 --> 01:38:00.898]  No, I fell down.
[01:38:00.898 --> 01:38:03.260]  Take your pants off, we're gonna search you now.
[01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:04.982]  CPS is not gonna take you, hon.
[01:38:06.502 --> 01:38:08.003]  CPS now going to take yard.
[01:38:08.003 --> 01:38:10.704]  I said I'd take your calls and I'm going to go fast now.
[01:38:10.704 --> 01:38:12.044]  Big cat in Kentucky.
[01:38:12.044 --> 01:38:12.505]  Big cat.
[01:38:12.505 --> 01:38:16.286]  I bet you're calling in about Rand Paul and the demonization campaign against him.
[01:38:16.286 --> 01:38:17.066]  Uh, yes, sir.
[01:38:17.066 --> 01:38:19.668]  I am Alex and greetings from the great Commonwealth.
[01:38:19.668 --> 01:38:24.630]  What I really wanted to do is kind of give you a, um, an inside view of what's going on here.
[01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:32.233]  Um, as in the revolutionary war where artillery wasn't precise and they just volleyed and hoping they hit something.
[01:38:32.233 --> 01:38:34.934]  Well, that's what the Democrats are doing here in Kentucky because
[01:38:35.541 --> 01:38:36.141]  Exactly!
[01:39:06.041 --> 01:39:09.583]  Vote that straight Democratic Party line for all these local races.
[01:39:09.583 --> 01:39:17.068]  Now, we have a lot of people that are running on the Tea Party support here, and they're all in the Republican Party.
[01:39:17.068 --> 01:39:19.570]  So, that's what's really going on.
[01:39:19.570 --> 01:39:26.034]  And then, to give you an example, we got the 6th District Congressman race here.
[01:39:27.237 --> 01:39:36.944]  We have Ben Chandler running, and Chairman Pelosi gave him a permission not to vote on the TARP bailout because she had enough votes.
[01:39:36.944 --> 01:39:42.349]  Well, he is running his whole campaign on that he voted no for the TARP bailout.
[01:39:42.349 --> 01:39:46.412]  But the rest of his votes are party-line voting.
[01:39:46.412 --> 01:39:56.020]  And the earlier Republican that Cheney and others and the neocons were supporting against Rand, he got record money in that Senate race from Goldman Sachs and others.
[01:39:57.263 --> 01:39:58.104]  Yes, yes.
[01:39:58.104 --> 01:40:03.206]  And every time, you know, it's kind of like when Obama shows up to campaign for you.
[01:40:03.206 --> 01:40:05.988]  It's kind of the same thing with Dick Cheney.
[01:40:05.988 --> 01:40:07.168]  This is a nightmare, though.
[01:40:07.168 --> 01:40:08.769]  This is a nightmare for them.
[01:40:08.769 --> 01:40:25.718]  Can you imagine Ron Paul in the House, Rand Paul in the Senate, going in in the next year and a half to the 2012 election, cranking up to get Ron Paul into the presidency, and more and more Ron Paul-type libertarians and constitutionalists seeing that they can win for county commissioner?
[01:40:26.838 --> 01:40:33.845]  Dog catcher, school board, mayor, legislature, state legislature, congress, senate.
[01:40:33.845 --> 01:40:36.247]  We're discovering we can win.
[01:40:36.247 --> 01:40:37.127]  Every incumbent.
[01:40:37.938 --> 01:40:43.061]  Except for in a few cases like Rick Perry, losing in the Republican and Democratic primaries.
[01:40:43.061 --> 01:40:45.802]  I mean, this has got the system scared.
[01:40:45.802 --> 01:40:54.767]  So they want to demonize Rand Paul, who's seen as the personified, true patriot, libertarian Tea Party, as a kidnapper.
[01:40:54.767 --> 01:40:56.809]  And now I've been scanning through
[01:40:57.549 --> 01:41:13.679]  Yesterday and today's TV, radio and newsprint, and am I correct in saying the media is still implying this is a scandal and not retracting, even though the woman two days ago admitted he did not kidnap her, he did not make her use drugs, and most of the story is not true or an exaggeration?
[01:41:14.994 --> 01:41:22.578]  Dude, that is the ammo they're using right now and they've not let up on it here locally.
[01:41:22.578 --> 01:41:24.619]  Exactly.
[01:41:24.619 --> 01:41:29.461]  Nationally, they're backing off because they're Washington Post and GQ are liable.
[01:41:29.461 --> 01:41:32.922]  But locally, from what I've seen, they are pouring it on heavy.
[01:41:32.922 --> 01:41:38.285]  We've got to get this out nationally and in Kentucky that this is a hoax and that's why we're doing the search term.
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:43.582]  I'd like to thank all the fellow InfoWarriors that are doing this for us here in Kentucky.
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:15.284]  And I would like to mention Wes Collins for the 6th District.
[01:42:15.284 --> 01:42:18.026]  He's running a writing campaign and doing a bang-up job.
[01:42:18.026 --> 01:42:22.709]  And if anybody would, you know, I know the times are hard, but we would like to donate to him.
[01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:26.351]  You can go to WesCollins2010.com and look over his platform.
[01:42:29.673 --> 01:42:32.294]  Big Cat, let me ask you one more question and then I gotta go.
[01:42:32.294 --> 01:42:36.636]  We should support all the good candidates locally, all over the country, but Rand's the figurehead.
[01:42:36.636 --> 01:42:48.102]  As you said, they're making him the bin Laden here, trying to turn him into that, you know, from the choir boy to bin Laden, and it's not working, but as much as they'd like, but it's having some effect because people aren't really paying attention.
[01:42:48.102 --> 01:42:53.865]  They just kind of hear the background noise and the retractions are done in the back of the paper, not the front of the paper, like the original lies.
[01:42:54.725 --> 01:43:02.030]  Are people starting to get, though, that the system is running hoaxes against him in Kentucky?
[01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:08.634]  Well, like I said, we're predominantly Democrats and, man, they're laughing it up with the bread and the soup spoon.
[01:43:08.634 --> 01:43:11.055]  But we have a contention here fighting.
[01:43:11.055 --> 01:43:13.897]  There's a lot of Tea Party patriots here fighting.
[01:43:13.897 --> 01:43:17.579]  But, you know, it's kind of like going to a gunfight with a knife.
[01:43:17.579 --> 01:43:18.960]  You know, we're just outnumbered.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:19.860]  We're outmanned.
[01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:22.382]  You know, when you have the two biggest papers in Kentucky,
[01:43:23.118 --> 01:43:25.360]  Every day, there's something about Rand.
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:27.921]  There's nothing about Jack Conway whatsoever.
[01:43:27.921 --> 01:43:30.163]  It's always about Rand.
[01:43:30.163 --> 01:43:31.464]  Listen, I gotta jump.
[01:43:31.464 --> 01:43:32.945]  Great points, Big Cat.
[01:43:32.945 --> 01:43:37.708]  So telling us from Kentucky what we've observed from Texas and the rest of the nation.
[01:43:37.708 --> 01:43:38.969]  The cavalry's on the way.
[01:43:38.969 --> 01:43:42.811]  The Info Warriors are gonna get this article out to everybody.
[01:43:42.811 --> 01:43:47.294]  Establishment's latest desperate Rand Paul hoax explodes in their face.
[01:43:47.294 --> 01:43:50.757]  Folks are out there en masse and I commend them searching the term Rand Paul hoax.
[01:43:51.297 --> 01:43:59.183]  You need to go to all the big newspapers online, letters to the editor, in their comments, talk radio, TV, and you tell them, you better retract.
[01:43:59.183 --> 01:44:02.705]  But I think Rand needs to get on the offensive against these people.
[01:44:02.705 --> 01:44:05.567]  Let's go ahead now and talk to James in Ohio.
[01:44:05.567 --> 01:44:06.428]  James, you're on the air.
[01:44:06.428 --> 01:44:08.409]  Alex, how you doing?
[01:44:08.409 --> 01:44:09.370]  Good.
[01:44:09.370 --> 01:44:12.752]  I just wanted to give you a little bit of an update.
[01:44:12.752 --> 01:44:17.756]  My district is Jim Traffickin.
[01:44:17.756 --> 01:44:19.037]  They disqualified him, didn't they?
[01:44:20.014 --> 01:44:23.215]  Well, it's still up in the air.
[01:44:23.215 --> 01:44:28.296]  They did disqualify that he's going to be on the ballot with his name as an independent.
[01:44:28.296 --> 01:44:43.739]  He turned in a little over 3,500 signatures and he had to have 2,100 registered voters in them signatures and they say he came up like 32 short, which is a
[01:44:44.505 --> 01:44:44.865]  Yeah.
[01:44:44.865 --> 01:44:47.908]  Well, I'll say this, tying Traficant into Paul.
[01:44:47.908 --> 01:44:51.751]  Traficant, you can say what you want about him, was clearly railroaded.
[01:44:51.751 --> 01:44:53.693]  That evidence is overwhelming.
[01:44:53.693 --> 01:45:02.039]  And, you know, if they get away with seeing Rand Paul's kidnapping people and making them use drugs, which they admit isn't true, they may try to falsely indict Rand.
[01:45:02.039 --> 01:45:04.541]  I mean, these people don't play games.
[01:45:04.541 --> 01:45:12.588]  No, no, they, uh, my, uh, one of my professors was on the, uh, he was the jury foreman for Jim Traficant's first trial.
[01:45:13.497 --> 01:45:16.620]  And just like his second trial, it was totally one-sided.
[01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:28.969]  They wouldn't let Jim get any evidence and they had no real solid evidence other than hearsay and people being kind of nudged and forced along.
[01:45:28.969 --> 01:45:33.732]  But yeah, they're trying everything they can to just keep him off the ballot.
[01:45:36.829 --> 01:45:37.830]  Hello Mr. Jones, how are you?
[01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:38.210]  Good sir, welcome.
[01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:15.655]  First of all, um, I wanted to, I don't know if anybody has said this or not, but the, the Google, uh, when they were blocking that search term thing and, you know, fudging the searches.
[01:46:15.655 --> 01:46:16.456]  Yes.
[01:46:16.456 --> 01:46:24.259]  Uh, I went to MSN Yahoo and I just kept searching, searching, searching, like over a couple hundred times.
[01:46:24.259 --> 01:46:25.300]  No problem.
[01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:27.681]  And then I went back to Google and
[01:46:28.286 --> 01:46:32.507]  It seemed like after like a hundred times, it's just that I got that error message.
[01:46:32.507 --> 01:46:34.488]  Yeah, I don't think people should do it that way.
[01:46:34.488 --> 01:46:41.870]  I think people should just go, you know, search around, click on the stories, type it in five or six times, because that's, you know, naturally occurring basically.
[01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:44.910]  We want to see this is the top story.
[01:46:44.910 --> 01:46:54.033]  I think when they put those automatic computer systems in that just do it, you know, a whole bunch, that that's why it'll go up for a few hours as the number one search, and then they'll make it non-searchable
[01:46:54.893 --> 01:46:55.073]  I think?
[01:47:12.529 --> 01:47:12.689]  I don't
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:29.100]  Something
[01:47:45.347 --> 01:47:45.667]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:09.308]  And then that will lead people to the Rand Paul hoax story.
[01:48:09.308 --> 01:48:17.581]  So search Rand Paul hoaxes one search by itself and latest desperate latest desperate as another
[01:48:20.649 --> 01:48:22.109]  Yeah, the other thing I wanted to, I gotta thank you.
[01:48:22.109 --> 01:48:26.711]  I can't even begin to thank you because I got to listen to your website just to feel sane.
[01:48:26.711 --> 01:48:27.871]  I have a Facebook
[01:48:46.403 --> 01:48:46.643]  I don't
[01:49:05.993 --> 01:49:09.454]  Well, they don't see themselves in the mode as a leader or a defender.
[01:49:09.454 --> 01:49:15.695]  They see themselves as jellyfish people that just repeat what the media says and who are spectators in life.
[01:49:15.695 --> 01:49:24.977]  And that's why the establishment is moving against humanity because they know a lot of people are jellyfish and then they're demonizing active people as if it's weird to be for freedom.
[01:49:24.977 --> 01:49:29.298]  It's dangerous, it's terrorist to be against offshore banks running your country.
[01:49:29.298 --> 01:49:31.559]  But keep it up Joe, you're doing a great job.
[01:49:31.559 --> 01:49:32.079]  Let's go to
[01:49:34.053 --> 01:49:38.456]  Hello Mr. Alex.
[01:49:38.456 --> 01:49:40.017]  First time caller, long time listener.
[01:49:40.017 --> 01:49:45.040]  I want to thank you for making us all leaders for the fight of freedom and liberty, sir.
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:48.102]  I want to say one thing.
[01:49:48.102 --> 01:49:50.363]  I called GQ Public Relations today.
[01:49:52.318 --> 01:49:54.799]  Public Relations got a nice little message.
[01:49:54.799 --> 01:49:58.061]  His number is 2-1-2... Hold on, let me just stop you.
[01:49:58.061 --> 01:50:00.203]  I want to make sure it's not his personal home number.
[01:50:00.203 --> 01:50:03.524]  This is the official GQ phone number?
[01:50:03.524 --> 01:50:06.686]  Yeah, it's GQ Public Relations.
[01:50:06.686 --> 01:50:13.370]  I call on behalf of... I call on behalf... I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.
[01:50:13.370 --> 01:50:14.731]  First time caller, like I said.
[01:50:14.731 --> 01:50:16.392]  I call on behalf of Rand and just...
[01:50:17.162 --> 01:50:19.183]  No, of the publication.
[01:50:19.183 --> 01:50:20.604]  Well, listen, hold on.
[01:50:20.604 --> 01:50:23.505]  I want to give out the GQ public relations phone number.
[01:50:23.505 --> 01:50:24.906]  That's a good idea.
[01:50:24.906 --> 01:50:26.787]  But I trust you.
[01:50:26.787 --> 01:50:36.631]  But the reason a lot of national hosts won't let people give out numbers is people can do it to the wrong number or say it wrong or do it to call some innocent person.
[01:50:36.631 --> 01:50:37.912]  And then we're liable.
[01:50:37.912 --> 01:50:43.975]  So, John Harmon, will you get this number from him during the break and call it yourself?
[01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:46.522]  Uh, and then it's put into a search engine.
[01:50:46.522 --> 01:50:48.364]  I'm sure you're telling the truth.
[01:50:48.364 --> 01:50:49.906]  Phillip, we're gonna come back to you.
[01:50:49.906 --> 01:50:52.309]  I just gotta double check a number before we give it out, okay?
[01:50:52.309 --> 01:50:53.770]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:53.770 --> 01:50:54.832]  Stay with us.
[01:50:54.832 --> 01:50:59.116]  We'll give a call to GQ, who ran the hoax that Rand Paul was kidnapping a woman.
[01:50:59.116 --> 01:50:59.977]  Now they admit it's not true.
[01:51:01.018 --> 01:51:02.319]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.319 --> 01:51:07.922]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.922 --> 01:51:12.944]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.944 --> 01:51:13.404]  It's true.
[01:51:13.404 --> 01:51:17.967]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.507 --> 01:51:23.733]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.733 --> 01:51:30.861]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.861 --> 01:51:31.983]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.983 --> 01:51:38.330]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.650 --> 01:51:41.831]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.831 --> 01:51:44.052]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.052 --> 01:51:44.992]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:44.992 --> 01:51:45.192]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.192 --> 01:51:48.634]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.634 --> 01:51:50.394]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.871 --> 01:52:04.254]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:52:04.254 --> 01:52:08.158]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:52:08.158 --> 01:52:11.881]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:52:11.881 --> 01:52:19.428]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[01:52:19.448 --> 01:52:19.728]  I think so.
[01:52:34.445 --> 01:52:34.985]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:53:00.934 --> 01:53:03.936]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:53:03.936 --> 01:53:05.998]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:53:05.998 --> 01:53:08.760]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:10.981]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:53:10.981 --> 01:53:12.402]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:53:12.402 --> 01:53:14.304]  But first, the facts.
[01:53:14.304 --> 01:53:16.225]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:53:16.225 --> 01:53:18.206]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:53:18.206 --> 01:53:21.909]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:53:21.909 --> 01:53:29.654]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:53:29.654 --> 01:53:30.275]  Sinofresh.
[01:53:30.515 --> 01:53:33.597]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[01:53:49.906 --> 01:53:50.266]  Mention GCN.

[01:53:51.206 --> 01:53:51.466]  It works!
[01:54:07.682 --> 01:54:13.027]  Okay, we looked up this number and it appears to be Corey Wilson, GQ Magazine.
[01:54:15.979 --> 01:54:20.700]  Associate Director, but I can't 100% nail it down.
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:31.063]  If people want to go to GQ's website and find phone numbers and names, we need to call them and tell them, look, and politely, because most of them aren't involved in this, you know, you said this guy kidnapped a woman.
[01:54:31.063 --> 01:54:34.624]  And the lady has said now that that's not the case and he didn't force her to use drugs.
[01:54:34.624 --> 01:54:36.685]  You need to retract it.
[01:54:36.685 --> 01:54:40.766]  But separately, I want to commend you for taking action.
[01:54:40.766 --> 01:54:44.547]  Phillip, anything else?
[01:54:44.547 --> 01:54:45.147]  Phillip, still there?
[01:54:47.358 --> 01:54:47.959]  Okay, he's gone.
[01:54:47.959 --> 01:54:49.540]  Let's go to Walt in Pennsylvania.
[01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:53.683]  Walt, you're on the air.
[01:54:53.683 --> 01:54:55.244]  Hey, Walt.
[01:54:55.244 --> 01:54:58.066]  I appreciate everything you're doing for America, man.
[01:54:58.066 --> 01:55:01.769]  You're one of the few people out there that I think really care.
[01:55:01.769 --> 01:55:02.489]  Well, I'm trying.
[01:55:02.489 --> 01:55:05.191]  Yeah, I got two things.
[01:55:05.191 --> 01:55:07.093]  First thing's real quick.
[01:55:07.093 --> 01:55:12.817]  Does Aquabooda have anything to do with Moloch?
[01:55:12.817 --> 01:55:14.819]  I'm being a wise guy on that one.
[01:55:15.609 --> 01:55:16.830]  I think that's hilarious.
[01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:19.291]  That sounds like a comic book.
[01:55:19.291 --> 01:55:20.792]  Aqua Buddha.
[01:55:20.792 --> 01:55:33.299]  But, uh, the second thing I wanted to talk about was, uh, it seems like, uh, everybody in the media has forgot about the Gulf oil spill and the Corexit.
[01:55:33.299 --> 01:55:35.280]  But, uh, are you still there, Alex?
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:36.521]  I'm listening to you.
[01:55:36.521 --> 01:55:37.041]  Oh, okay.
[01:55:37.041 --> 01:55:38.022]  I'm sorry, bro.
[01:55:38.022 --> 01:55:44.306]  But anyhow, uh, can I give out a website where I got this information from?
[01:55:44.306 --> 01:55:44.486]  Sure.
[01:55:45.603 --> 01:55:48.085]  Okay, it's called the Intel Hub.
[01:55:48.085 --> 01:55:59.434]  Well, they just put out a thing today that a parish president, Kevin Davis, was threatened by, through the federal government, by the Coast Guard.
[01:55:59.434 --> 01:56:02.397]  He does not want to take away the oil
[01:56:03.374 --> 01:56:06.275]  Uh, booms and stuff, trying to protect Lake Park.
[01:56:06.275 --> 01:56:11.276]  Well, we, we, we linked to an article, uh, what, Wednesday, that had all these mainstream articles.
[01:56:11.276 --> 01:56:30.882]  It was, uh, the George Washington blog, just is great at excising clips out of a bunch of news to show the pattern, where all these scientists and heads of universities and top meteorologists and people in the Gulf saying it's still leaking, there's fissures all over the seafloor, and they've all said they've been threatened by the federal government.
[01:56:30.882 --> 01:56:32.783]  Yeah, and this guy that was just, uh, supposedly
[01:56:33.585 --> 01:56:35.827]  He either drowned or died of a heart attack.
[01:56:35.827 --> 01:56:36.808]  Nobody knows.
[01:56:36.808 --> 01:56:39.750]  Oh yeah, we wrote articles about that the last few days.
[01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:48.776]  The guy that was real critical of BP, big high-powered energy guy, supposedly had a heart attack and drowned in his swimming pool.
[01:56:48.776 --> 01:56:53.480]  And it's very suspicious, just like Senator Ted Stevens playing going down and dying a few days ago.
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:55.281]  I appreciate your call, Walt.
[01:56:55.281 --> 01:56:56.802]  Let's talk to John in Ohio.
[01:56:56.802 --> 01:56:58.763]  John, you're on the air.
[01:56:58.763 --> 01:57:00.425]  Yes, I wanted to mention that
[01:57:01.484 --> 01:57:04.978]  If people would just look and do a search of the words, uh, Rand Paul.
[01:57:05.678 --> 01:57:09.780]  Neocon, Israeli mouthpiece of Rand Paul, Neocon warmonger.
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:14.022]  I think you'll come up with a lot of information that shows he's not, he's not at all his fault.
[01:57:14.022 --> 01:57:15.283]  And Rand Paul kidnapped her!
[01:57:15.283 --> 01:57:17.844]  I bet we can find some fake stories about that too, huh?
[01:57:17.844 --> 01:57:29.370]  Well, I'm sure you're fully aware of what he said out to all of his supporters, which was sort of a copy of all of these right-wing Zionists within the Senate that are propping up the propaganda for war.
[01:57:29.370 --> 01:57:30.390]  If you're not going to be against
[01:57:32.111 --> 01:57:32.612]  Hey, John!
[01:57:32.612 --> 01:57:34.054]  Hey, put him on hold!
[01:57:34.054 --> 01:57:34.154]  John!
[01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:56.451]  Dick Cheney came and campaigned against Rand and said he's soft on terrorists and soft on wars because he is against the wars and he knows this stuff is hyped up and exaggerated into fraud.
[01:57:56.451 --> 01:58:04.099]  The main neocon attack engine spent record money for his challenger in the Republican primary.
[01:58:04.099 --> 01:58:06.642]  The Democrat is way more pro-war.
[01:58:07.282 --> 01:58:12.486]  Now, Rand Paul has said if America is attacked, he would be for defending America.
[01:58:12.486 --> 01:58:15.268]  And then other people spun it that way.
[01:58:15.268 --> 01:58:15.809]  Okay?
[01:58:15.809 --> 01:58:17.390]  It's ridiculous, John.
[01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:18.491]  It's ridiculous.
[01:58:18.491 --> 01:58:19.011]  Okay?
[01:58:19.011 --> 01:58:19.732]  So, fine.
[01:58:19.732 --> 01:58:21.614]  The Democrat, I'm sure, is great.
[01:58:21.614 --> 01:58:24.376]  And Rand Paul, who wants to audit and abolish the Federal Reserve, is bad.
[01:58:24.376 --> 01:58:24.896]  No.
[01:58:24.896 --> 01:58:27.018]  The system is out to get him.
[01:58:27.018 --> 01:58:32.562]  Dick Cheney and a bunch of top neocons, a whole bunch of them, wrote stories attacking him.
[01:58:32.562 --> 01:58:34.344]  I'm going to come back and let you have a last word on that.
[01:58:34.844 --> 01:58:38.049]  When we start the next hour, then at 8 after, we got Bob Chapman coming on.
[01:58:38.049 --> 01:58:38.509]  Stay with us.

[01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:56.001]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.001 --> 01:59:58.784]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.478 --> 02:00:10.320]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.901]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.901 --> 02:00:13.461]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.461 --> 02:00:17.703]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.703 --> 02:00:25.766]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.766 --> 02:00:31.889]  William Crystal, National Review, Dick Cheney, all the neocons,
[02:00:33.868 --> 02:00:47.698]  I mean, literally, scores of them demonized him for not being for the wars, demonized him for being his father's son, demonized him for wanting to cut defense spending, demonized him.
[02:00:47.698 --> 02:00:52.101]  But in these debates, he said, well, if America's attacked, I'm for defending ourselves.
[02:00:53.562 --> 02:01:02.291]  And meanwhile, Newsweek is attacking him, the conservative backlash against Rand Paul, this is May 19th, this is a couple months ago, because he's not pro-war.
[02:01:02.291 --> 02:01:06.555]  But then meanwhile, you got all the COINTELPRO, and I'm not saying John's that, but I see it.
[02:01:06.555 --> 02:01:17.066]  I mean, listen, I looked at what Peter Schiff said, and I said I think it hurt him, and he did lose, by the way, in Connecticut to a true neokine.
[02:01:18.444 --> 02:01:20.288]  And he said, well, this is how you get elected in Connecticut.
[02:01:20.288 --> 02:01:22.131]  And I said, no, that's not how you get elected.
[02:01:22.131 --> 02:01:25.537]  Now, what he said is neoconnish to a certain extent.
[02:01:25.537 --> 02:01:28.002]  I still like him on finance and a lot of other things.
[02:01:28.002 --> 02:01:29.164]  He would have been better than this other lady.
[02:01:30.373 --> 02:01:33.136]  But with Rand Paul, it's not the case.
[02:01:33.136 --> 02:01:46.348]  And then John is just chomping at the bit with such anger and aggression towards me, and then saying, if Rand Paul's gonna cover up for Israel and all this other stuff, he wants to end aid to Israel and every other country.
[02:01:46.348 --> 02:01:48.090]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:01:48.090 --> 02:01:51.213]  Let me guess, John, do you not like Ron Paul either?
[02:01:51.213 --> 02:01:54.276]  Is Ron Paul a tool of Israel as well?
[02:01:55.191 --> 02:02:00.973]  All I can find on his foreign policy issues, naturally, I don't support... Okay, I'm going to stop you again.
[02:02:00.973 --> 02:02:03.494]  Is Ron Paul bad too?
[02:02:03.494 --> 02:02:05.675]  No, not on half of his positions.
[02:02:05.675 --> 02:02:13.638]  It's refreshing to hear the fact that he's against these wars that Israel and military-industrial complex are trying to drag us into World War III with.
[02:02:13.638 --> 02:02:19.721]  I disagree, of course, with his right-wing economic policies, which I think dovetail with the Wall Street ideas.
[02:02:19.721 --> 02:02:23.142]  And John, you are an avowed socialist communist, correct?
[02:02:23.991 --> 02:02:25.774]  I'm not arguing any of that here.
[02:02:25.774 --> 02:02:27.137]  I'm going to ask you a question.
[02:02:27.137 --> 02:02:30.342]  You've called for years, plugging how great communism is.
[02:02:30.342 --> 02:02:32.005]  I'm just showing how distorted all of this is.
[02:02:33.908 --> 02:02:39.332]  Hey, you don't like libertarians, you don't like constitutionalists.
[02:02:39.332 --> 02:02:41.273]  Okay, communism doesn't work.
[02:02:41.273 --> 02:02:49.979]  Okay, so the establishment's decided to go after him because, you know, there's a lot of people who don't like Israel by claiming he supports everything Israel does when he doesn't.
[02:02:49.979 --> 02:02:50.819]  It's just like me.
[02:02:50.819 --> 02:02:53.161]  I can make films exposing the USS Liberty.
[02:02:53.161 --> 02:02:54.462]  I can criticize the wars.
[02:02:54.462 --> 02:02:56.203]  I can be against things Israel's doing.
[02:02:56.203 --> 02:03:01.807]  And people lie and say that I say if you criticize Israel, you're a weak-minded idiot.
[02:03:01.807 --> 02:03:02.747]  No, that's not what I said.
[02:03:02.747 --> 02:03:03.468]  That's another hoax!
[02:03:04.108 --> 02:03:16.493]  What I've said is, as clear as day, is that if you say I work for Israel, as people put out this hoax, and with no evidence, and nothing but lies, that you are a weak-minded idiot, okay?
[02:03:16.493 --> 02:03:18.293]  It's ridiculous, okay?
[02:03:18.293 --> 02:03:28.977]  And you've got Hal Turner and others, funded by the FBI, to radicalize the Patriot movement, that if you don't put on a SS uniform with a red armband with a swastika on it, and
[02:03:30.998 --> 02:03:37.585]  Okay, so don't worry, John, I'm sure they're gonna make up more kidnappings and more drugs and more secret societies and more rituals and more getting rid of the
[02:03:54.162 --> 02:04:00.065]  Civil Rights Act, and he's not a doctor, and he didn't graduate from college, all hoaxes, all lies.
[02:04:00.065 --> 02:04:01.725]  You might become successful!
[02:04:01.725 --> 02:04:03.666]  You might get that Democrat who's for big government.
[02:04:03.666 --> 02:04:05.227]  I appreciate your call.
[02:04:05.227 --> 02:04:06.967]  Really good hearing from you, John.
[02:04:06.967 --> 02:04:09.468]  Boy, I tell you, you're battling the New World Order, aren't you?
[02:04:09.468 --> 02:04:18.732]  Calling in here with communism, socialism, it's gonna save us, Rand Paul's bad, Alex is bad.
[02:04:18.732 --> 02:04:19.973]  Holy mackerel!
[02:04:21.181 --> 02:04:22.181]  It gets old.
[02:04:22.181 --> 02:04:26.822]  The entire Republican machine was demonizing and running hoaxes against him.
[02:04:26.822 --> 02:04:32.263]  The Democrat machine, all wedded together, pulling out every stop against him.
[02:04:32.263 --> 02:04:36.644]  And you don't have the common sense to be able to know this is the guy we want in the U.S.
[02:04:36.644 --> 02:04:38.025]  Senate.
[02:04:38.025 --> 02:04:42.666]  But regardless, they're playing the race card to control people, all of it.
[02:04:42.666 --> 02:04:42.886]  Okay?
[02:04:43.823 --> 02:04:45.124]  So, go vote for the Democrat.
[02:04:45.124 --> 02:04:45.564]  Enjoy it.
[02:04:45.564 --> 02:04:46.344]  Buy into the hoax.
[02:04:46.344 --> 02:04:47.585]  Buy into everything else.
[02:04:47.585 --> 02:04:49.466]  Hey, we fundamentally disagree.
[02:04:49.466 --> 02:04:51.947]  I'm not for socialism and collectivism.
[02:04:51.947 --> 02:04:52.867]  You are.
[02:04:52.867 --> 02:04:54.568]  You've said you are many times.
[02:04:54.568 --> 02:04:56.228]  And you don't like me because of that.
[02:04:56.228 --> 02:04:59.410]  Because you can't imagine anybody being good who isn't a commie.
[02:05:00.779 --> 02:05:05.763]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:05:05.763 --> 02:05:06.764]  What have we got?
[02:05:06.764 --> 02:05:09.206]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:05:09.206 --> 02:05:10.207]  A republic.
[02:05:10.207 --> 02:05:12.849]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:05:12.849 --> 02:05:15.131]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:05:15.131 --> 02:05:17.153]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:05:17.153 --> 02:05:18.834]  So they think they own our land?
[02:05:18.834 --> 02:05:20.156]  They think they own our water?
[02:05:20.156 --> 02:05:20.756]  Children?
[02:05:20.756 --> 02:05:21.877]  Our education?
[02:05:21.877 --> 02:05:22.698]  Our money?
[02:05:22.698 --> 02:05:26.361]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:05:26.721 --> 02:05:31.687]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:05:31.687 --> 02:05:32.728]  We have the facts.
[02:05:32.728 --> 02:05:33.869]  We have the Constitution.
[02:05:33.869 --> 02:05:34.791]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:05:34.791 --> 02:05:35.672]  We have common law.
[02:05:35.672 --> 02:05:38.195]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:38.195 --> 02:05:41.979]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:05:42.079 --> 02:05:47.024]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:05:47.024 --> 02:05:48.526]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:05:48.526 --> 02:05:49.627]  Don't tread on me.
[02:05:49.627 --> 02:05:56.494]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:06:00.598 --> 02:06:05.140]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.140 --> 02:06:06.060]  Number 1.
[02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:09.482]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.482 --> 02:06:10.342]  Number 2.
[02:06:10.342 --> 02:06:15.224]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.224 --> 02:06:15.984]  It's true.
[02:06:15.984 --> 02:06:20.847]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.847 --> 02:06:21.687]  Number 3.
[02:06:21.687 --> 02:06:25.268]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.268 --> 02:06:28.970]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.170 --> 02:06:29.971]  Number 4.
[02:06:29.971 --> 02:06:32.734]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.734 --> 02:06:36.418]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.418 --> 02:06:37.198]  Number 5.
[02:06:37.198 --> 02:06:41.343]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.343 --> 02:06:46.108]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:46.388 --> 02:06:50.570]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:53.814 --> 02:07:54.274]  Thank you!
[02:08:09.511 --> 02:08:13.673]  On the march, the empire is on the run.
[02:08:13.673 --> 02:08:19.015]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:19.015 --> 02:08:23.177]  Alright, we're back live for the Balance of the Hour, our once a week Friday visit with Bob Chapman.
[02:08:23.177 --> 02:08:26.919]  Bob was on hold listening to John in Ohio call in.
[02:08:26.919 --> 02:08:29.840]  More of your calls coming up.
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:34.342]  Rand Paul has said that if we're attacked, he wants to defend this country.
[02:08:35.796 --> 02:08:45.352]  He didn't go one-tenth as far as Peter Schiff did in his attempt to get elected because he was attacked by Dick Cheney, all the top neocons.
[02:08:45.352 --> 02:08:48.737]  Now, you saw it in the last year as pro-terror.
[02:08:49.895 --> 02:08:53.258]  He wants to end the wars, end foreign aid, all of this.
[02:08:53.258 --> 02:08:55.320]  The issue is he wants to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:09:02.147]  And now the Democrats have come out with a hoax story in GQ saying he kidnapped a woman, he made her do drugs.
[02:09:02.147 --> 02:09:05.050]  She's now recanted and says that's not true.
[02:09:05.050 --> 02:09:05.871]  It's not even recanted.
[02:09:05.871 --> 02:09:07.613]  She said that GQ twisted what she said.
[02:09:07.613 --> 02:09:09.635]  He didn't kidnap her, didn't make her do drugs.
[02:09:09.635 --> 02:09:12.758]  It was a fraternity party at a lake and that none of that happened.
[02:09:14.585 --> 02:09:16.386]  They've said he's against the Civil Rights Act.
[02:09:16.386 --> 02:09:19.749]  They've said that he doesn't have a degree, which they admit's not true now.
[02:09:19.749 --> 02:09:21.771]  They've sent Democratic Party operatives out.
[02:09:21.771 --> 02:09:23.712]  We've covered it all, posing as racist.
[02:09:23.712 --> 02:09:25.934]  That's now admitted.
[02:09:25.934 --> 02:09:28.476]  How many more hoaxes do we have to see?
[02:09:28.476 --> 02:09:33.721]  And then meanwhile, you got people going, he's not anti-Israel enough.
[02:09:34.855 --> 02:09:37.758]  I mean, it's just everything revolves around that.
[02:09:37.758 --> 02:09:41.261]  People just sit there like birds in trees going, Israel, Israel, Israel, Israel.
[02:09:41.261 --> 02:09:42.782]  No other issues.
[02:09:42.782 --> 02:09:45.505]  Let's not get the Bias Finale out of the water.
[02:09:45.505 --> 02:09:47.567]  Let's not take our local communities back.
[02:09:47.567 --> 02:09:49.309]  Let's not abolish the Federal Reserve.
[02:09:49.309 --> 02:09:53.773]  Let's just show off and say, I'm more anti-Israel than anybody else.
[02:09:55.179 --> 02:09:58.321]  And then when people criticize Israel, they go, that's not enough, scum!
[02:09:58.321 --> 02:09:59.762]  You didn't prove yourself enough!
[02:09:59.762 --> 02:10:07.827]  I mean, it's all a bunch of holier-than-thou people not getting anything done, just running around complaining constantly.
[02:10:07.827 --> 02:10:09.208]  And it's crazy!
[02:10:09.208 --> 02:10:16.533]  I mean, the whole system is coming after Rand Paul, pulling out the stops with dirty tricks, the likes of which I have never seen.
[02:10:17.682 --> 02:10:20.263]  It's starting to have an effect lowering some of his poll numbers.
[02:10:20.263 --> 02:10:22.004]  He's still got a good lead.
[02:10:22.004 --> 02:10:33.969]  But, you know, if they come out and say he's killing nuns tomorrow, or they come out and say he killed the Loch Ness Monster, or they come out and say he killed Jesus, or they come out and say he killed Kennedy, Lincoln, he tried to kill George Washington.
[02:10:33.969 --> 02:10:37.650]  You know, if you slip on a banana peel, he put it there.
[02:10:37.650 --> 02:10:39.851]  If it's a rainy day, Rand Paul did it.
[02:10:39.851 --> 02:10:42.072]  If you got a stomachache, Rand Paul caused it.
[02:10:43.564 --> 02:10:46.585]  Rand Paul wants to eat little black children.
[02:10:46.585 --> 02:10:49.425]  I mean, they are really getting desperate.
[02:10:49.425 --> 02:10:55.166]  Bob, I want to get into the economy and a bunch of other news with you, but what's your take on all this?
[02:10:55.166 --> 02:11:02.807]  It's called disinformation, and it's a form of propaganda.
[02:11:02.807 --> 02:11:10.989]  It's used usually in psychological operations, and it has been used for a long time in the United States.
[02:11:12.166 --> 02:11:25.637]  And they don't want Rand Paul in office, and they're going to continue to mislead the public through this program, and people have to be informed like you are, and telling them, look, this is not fair.
[02:11:25.637 --> 02:11:28.079]  What they're saying is untrue.
[02:11:28.079 --> 02:11:31.182]  These people don't care about truth.
[02:11:31.182 --> 02:11:39.869]  I mean, just look at the background of people like Cheney, and people in the Central Intelligence Agency, and other agencies of the government.
[02:11:41.294 --> 02:11:49.939]  They have been running private armies, private killing squads, all to make money.
[02:11:49.939 --> 02:11:58.785]  And, you know, I... Years ago, I was approached by these people and told them to take a hike.
[02:11:58.785 --> 02:12:02.507]  And they approached me because of my background.
[02:12:02.507 --> 02:12:07.090]  And they said... The last real time I refused was in 1966.
[02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:13.751]  And I've had trouble ever since with the government.
[02:12:13.751 --> 02:12:18.093]  Because they don't want me around because I won't play their game.
[02:12:18.093 --> 02:12:20.354]  So I know what these people are up to.
[02:12:20.354 --> 02:12:22.915]  And Alex, you're absolutely right.
[02:12:22.915 --> 02:12:25.496]  Let's get on with what's important.
[02:12:25.496 --> 02:12:32.719]  These diversions should not cloud the mind of intelligent people.
[02:12:32.719 --> 02:12:33.659]  Don't listen.
[02:12:33.659 --> 02:12:34.519]  They're not true.
[02:12:34.519 --> 02:12:39.021]  And these jealous vendettas I see out there are ridiculous.
[02:12:40.103 --> 02:12:42.064]  And I put up with the same thing for years.
[02:12:42.064 --> 02:12:45.065]  I just ignore them and keep right on going.
[02:12:45.065 --> 02:12:52.969]  But then again, I don't have a program on radio and I don't have to directly defend myself as you do.
[02:12:52.969 --> 02:12:56.710]  And so, let's get on with the job.
[02:12:56.710 --> 02:12:58.911]  Let's stop all this foolishness.
[02:12:58.911 --> 02:13:00.252]  Let's get Rand Paul.
[02:13:01.371 --> 02:13:26.661]  Elected well, I mean the entire power structure is going after him and running in many cases criminal operations Just incredible frauds and can't people see and I guess most folks do that's why he's got a six to ten point lead that this is a fraud and I mean and Cass Sunstein two years ago said the government media mainstream media lost so much credibility we've got
[02:13:27.628 --> 02:13:39.835]  To radicalize the conspiracy culture, people that don't trust the system, people that are awake, and make them so radicalized they look unpalatable to everybody else, and we've got to start infighting just like COINTELPRO.
[02:13:39.835 --> 02:13:49.341]  So anybody who's real, anybody who's good, like Rand Paul, myself, you, Ron Paul, others, Judge Napolitano, we're going to be attacked because we're actually winning.
[02:13:49.341 --> 02:13:50.842]  We're actually in the poll position.
[02:13:50.842 --> 02:13:52.503]  We're actually affecting change.
[02:13:52.503 --> 02:13:54.484]  We're actually getting people to hear what we're saying.
[02:13:54.484 --> 02:13:55.665]  We're accurate.
[02:13:55.665 --> 02:13:56.886]  What we've said has come true.
[02:13:57.426 --> 02:14:07.815]  And the system is attacking us from the media, the mainstream media, the government, the think tanks, the George Soros groups, the fake alternative media, because we're having an effect.
[02:14:07.815 --> 02:14:10.197]  They're after us because we're in the lead car.
[02:14:10.197 --> 02:14:12.299]  We're winning!
[02:14:12.299 --> 02:14:13.660]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:14:13.660 --> 02:14:19.104]  And I sent you an email today, and I never send you emails, to prove that we're winning.
[02:14:19.104 --> 02:14:23.128]  And it was a gentleman who lives in England who started to make
[02:14:24.023 --> 02:14:33.710]  Uh, videos and he's sending them out and putting them on the, on the internet, uh, because he wants to try to do something.
[02:14:33.710 --> 02:14:38.354]  And I just wanted to show you by sending you one of them, uh, what he was doing.
[02:14:38.354 --> 02:14:43.657]  And it's not what Alex is doing because he's not on that level of expertise.
[02:14:43.657 --> 02:14:52.664]  But the point is the motivation is reaching people all over the world to step up and say, we're not going to put up with this anymore.
[02:14:53.226 --> 02:14:57.610]  And this is what we're going to do, and we're going to inform people of what's wrong out there.
[02:14:57.610 --> 02:15:02.313]  Because we're telling the truth, and we want you to know about it.
[02:15:02.313 --> 02:15:02.934]  Well said.
[02:15:02.934 --> 02:15:07.297]  Alright, getting into the serious issues of the day.
[02:15:07.297 --> 02:15:11.281]  Here are some of the financial headlines right now.
[02:15:13.049 --> 02:15:15.350]  Fed leads America to the brink of collapse.
[02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:22.573]  Paul Joseph Watson and it goes through CNN, New York Times, all of them admitting, okay, maybe it is a depression, maybe it is a collapse.
[02:15:22.573 --> 02:15:26.434]  Fed's new round of quantitative easing, you predicted this two weeks ago, now they're announcing it.
[02:15:26.434 --> 02:15:31.016]  It's likely, it's like trying to patch leaky pipes by pumping in more water.
[02:15:31.016 --> 02:15:33.097]  The Washington blog said that, George Washington blog.
[02:15:34.818 --> 02:15:37.739]  All the jobless numbers, the manufacturing numbers going down.
[02:15:37.739 --> 02:15:40.161]  I mean, this is really happening.
[02:15:40.161 --> 02:15:42.142]  Let's get into the latest financial developments.
[02:15:42.142 --> 02:15:45.544]  I don't want to get into issues like Senator DeMint ratifying U.N.
[02:15:45.544 --> 02:15:50.027]  Children's Treaty would turn parental rights over to international community.
[02:15:50.027 --> 02:15:52.148]  Bob Chapman.
[02:15:52.148 --> 02:15:57.432]  Well, it was about six weeks ago on this program that we started to talk about it.
[02:15:57.432 --> 02:15:59.453]  And it's come to fruition.
[02:15:59.453 --> 02:16:01.194]  And there was no way out for the Fed.
[02:16:01.818 --> 02:16:20.531]  And what they said they were going to do was to take the interest that they are receiving from the collateralized debt obligations, some $1.8 trillion that they'll admit to, that they purchased, and they won't tell us what price of course, from banks and others.
[02:16:20.531 --> 02:16:28.557]  And they're going to use that interest to buy treasuries and agencies, thereby putting more money back into the economy.
[02:16:28.557 --> 02:16:31.179]  And they even have proposed to sell
[02:16:31.974 --> 02:16:36.518]  These collateralized debt obligations back to the banks that they bought them from.
[02:16:36.518 --> 02:16:40.000]  And that brings up the question again, what did they buy them for?
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.561]  And of course, I won't tell you.
[02:16:41.561 --> 02:16:44.784]  But my guess is around 70 cents on the dollar.
[02:16:44.784 --> 02:16:48.927]  And they'll sell them back to the banks probably for 15 or 20.
[02:16:48.927 --> 02:16:58.114]  Another gift and free up that much capital as well as interest that they had on the books previously.
[02:16:58.843 --> 02:17:03.325]  But we don't know exactly what they're doing because they won't tell us.
[02:17:03.325 --> 02:17:11.530]  And we might find out a year or two from now, but that's not any good because, you know, we need to zone in on what's important presently.
[02:17:11.530 --> 02:17:15.692]  So essentially, the Fed's going to do what I said they were going to do.
[02:17:15.692 --> 02:17:18.873]  Five trillion dollars will be injected into the U.S.
[02:17:18.873 --> 02:17:24.196]  economy and probably other economies as well over the next two years.
[02:17:24.196 --> 02:17:26.037]  They want to bring this thing through
[02:17:26.990 --> 02:17:53.227]  This election in the following one and they're going to continue to Inject money into the system by doing that also in the repo market where they buy securities from banks usually Treasury paper and the banks in turn turn that money over to 18 dealers who are instructed every day how to rig the markets and then in addition to that
[02:17:53.874 --> 02:17:57.576]  We have the banks who are sitting on over a trillion dollars.
[02:17:57.576 --> 02:18:03.438]  Now, they will lend the money by the Fed with no interest.
[02:18:03.438 --> 02:18:09.341]  They gave the money back to the Fed, and they're getting two and a half percent, which you get to pay for.
[02:18:09.341 --> 02:18:22.246]  And I think what the Fed's going to do is either lower the interest rate, or they're going to stop paying them interest, and the banks and the fractional banking system will take the trillion, and they'll make it into five trillion.
[02:18:24.037 --> 02:18:45.150]  And what's going to happen then is that money's going to go for loans to the small and medium-sized bank businesses that create 70% of the jobs, and they're going to try to bring up the economy that way, but they're going to be relatively successful.
[02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:50.174]  What I mean by that, on a scale of 10, three years ago it would have been a 10.
[02:18:50.174 --> 02:18:51.314]  This time it's going to be a 3 or a 4.
[02:18:52.907 --> 02:19:05.672]  In other words, the battle to keep the economy afloat will barely keep its head above water for the next two years if they do what I said I think they're going to do.
[02:19:06.616 --> 02:19:15.781]  Now, Bob, how did you know three weeks ago and then two weeks and then last week that they were going to make this announcement with so much precision?
[02:19:15.781 --> 02:19:17.542]  I had seen none of this in the news anywhere.
[02:19:17.542 --> 02:19:21.784]  There was a lot of financial shows, mainstream, wondering what was going to happen.
[02:19:21.784 --> 02:19:26.047]  They now are saying the Fed's going to basically start to boil this down, monetizing debt.
[02:19:26.047 --> 02:19:26.967]  So, A, how did you know?
[02:19:26.967 --> 02:19:28.788]  We're going to come back from break and go to calls.
[02:19:28.788 --> 02:19:30.129]  B, how did you know?
[02:19:30.129 --> 02:19:31.610]  In fact, we're coming back now.
[02:19:31.610 --> 02:19:32.590]  We'll do it then.
[02:19:32.590 --> 02:19:33.231]  How did you know?
[02:19:34.211 --> 02:19:37.474]  A, and then B, what is this going to do?
[02:19:37.474 --> 02:19:38.975]  Because we're already going into a depression.
[02:19:38.975 --> 02:19:41.457]  You say it'll slow it a bit.
[02:19:41.457 --> 02:19:42.538]  How does more debt do that?
[02:19:42.538 --> 02:19:46.061]  How do they raise taxes to then put this stimulus back out there?
[02:19:46.061 --> 02:19:51.124]  They claim the last stimulus was for the general public, but it was for the big banks, not Main Street.
[02:19:51.124 --> 02:19:55.568]  You're saying this will go to the big banks, but then they will put some of it out to Main Street.
[02:19:55.568 --> 02:19:57.990]  But how can Main Street even afford to get loans?
[02:19:57.990 --> 02:19:59.111]  We'll be back with Bob Chapman.
[02:20:01.101 --> 02:20:05.664]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:05.664 --> 02:20:06.564]  Number 1.
[02:20:06.564 --> 02:20:10.007]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:10.007 --> 02:20:10.847]  Number 2.
[02:20:10.847 --> 02:20:15.750]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:16.491]  It's true.
[02:20:16.491 --> 02:20:21.374]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.374 --> 02:20:22.194]  Number 3.
[02:20:22.194 --> 02:20:25.777]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:25.777 --> 02:20:29.479]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:29.679 --> 02:20:30.480]  Number 4.
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:33.243]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.243 --> 02:20:36.928]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:36.928 --> 02:20:37.709]  Number 5.
[02:20:37.709 --> 02:20:41.854]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:41.854 --> 02:20:46.620]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:46.900 --> 02:20:51.084]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:51.084 --> 02:20:52.866]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:21:01.883 --> 02:21:05.766]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:21:05.766 --> 02:21:07.168]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:21:07.168 --> 02:21:11.051]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:21:11.051 --> 02:21:13.953]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[02:21:13.953 --> 02:21:16.035]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:21:16.035 --> 02:21:18.177]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:21:19.378 --> 02:21:25.003]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:21:25.003 --> 02:21:27.525]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:21:35.051 --> 02:21:37.152]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[02:23:00.905 --> 02:23:06.128]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[02:23:06.128 --> 02:23:06.828]  Listen.
[02:23:06.828 --> 02:23:11.090]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[02:23:11.090 --> 02:23:14.492]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[02:23:14.492 --> 02:23:17.533]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[02:23:17.533 --> 02:23:20.915]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[02:23:21.314 --> 02:23:29.747]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[02:23:29.747 --> 02:23:32.310]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[02:23:32.310 --> 02:23:36.657]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months, I felt completely normal.
[02:23:36.897 --> 02:23:41.101]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[02:23:41.101 --> 02:23:45.304]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.

[02:24:07.119 --> 02:24:18.904]  Ladies and gentlemen, do you realize what a depression means to this society with no industrial base, with a public that's almost completely dependent and not self-sufficient, myself included?
[02:24:18.904 --> 02:24:21.745]  I mean, I don't know how to run a farm and grow everything I need.
[02:24:21.745 --> 02:24:23.766]  I've got some storable food.
[02:24:23.766 --> 02:24:29.529]  Bob, how did you know this was coming and what measurable effect will it have?
[02:24:29.529 --> 02:24:32.710]  Well, I kept on scratching my head still.
[02:24:33.504 --> 02:24:41.765]  About the episode in Europe, the short positions in the euro and the long positions in the dollar by New York and London banks.
[02:24:41.765 --> 02:24:57.908]  And I figured, finally, what they were up to, and that was the signal to, number one, make a lot of money, and number two, to bring pressure on the euro so that the dollar would get stronger.
[02:24:57.908 --> 02:25:02.189]  And the reason they wanted the dollar stronger was that they had something planned.
[02:25:02.865 --> 02:25:17.114]  And that plan was to, as I figured out, to have the Fed Reserve inject this tremendous amount of money over the next couple of years into the economy, and that would negatively affect the dollar.
[02:25:17.114 --> 02:25:23.338]  And so the dollar would go down, the stock market would go up, if temporarily only.
[02:25:23.826 --> 02:25:30.591]  It would go up, so it went down to approximately $96,000, $9,700 in the Dow.
[02:25:30.591 --> 02:25:38.477]  After I made the exclamations here on this program, it popped up to $10,700.
[02:25:38.477 --> 02:25:46.722]  And after that happened, I said it's going to go back down probably to $10,000, maybe even to test $96,800.
[02:25:46.722 --> 02:25:50.005]  At the same time, the dollar came plummeting down.
[02:25:50.835 --> 02:26:12.360]  And it dropped from 89 to almost 80 and it's pulled back up into the 82.3 area because it had a rally based upon the fact that the pressure was off and I think there was a great deal of help from the same cast of characters in New York and London that drove the dollar up in the first place.
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:20.122]  They wanted to give it a bounce because what the Fed's going to do is extremely negative to the dollar and it's very positive for gold and silver.
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:23.602]  Because it's going to create inflation.
[02:26:23.602 --> 02:26:26.444]  And how much, we don't know.
[02:26:26.444 --> 02:26:30.626]  Inflation, I believe, is running over 7%.
[02:26:30.626 --> 02:26:38.191]  John Williams, the eminent economist, who I follow quite closely, is talking about a higher number than that.
[02:26:38.191 --> 02:26:39.992]  But it's up there.
[02:26:39.992 --> 02:26:43.014]  And while the government says, no, we don't have any inflation.
[02:26:43.014 --> 02:26:44.634]  And of course, they don't know how to tell the truth.
[02:26:44.634 --> 02:26:47.776]  Well, that's just like I said, we have 9.7% unemployment when it's over 22%.
[02:26:50.148 --> 02:26:56.713]  Well, I backed off here a little with the last numbers because I dropped people off the end of the system, so to speak.
[02:26:56.713 --> 02:27:04.259]  It's running around $21.38 to a half right now, and it'll probably get to $20, but I don't think it'll get any better than that over the next couple of years.
[02:27:04.259 --> 02:27:08.522]  Okay, so what will this stimulus do, and can small companies even get these loans?
[02:27:08.522 --> 02:27:09.683]  Will they go out and get them?
[02:27:09.683 --> 02:27:13.186]  I mean, where are we 12 months from now?
[02:27:13.186 --> 02:27:18.190]  I think the second part of your statement, will they go out and get them, a lot of companies out of business.
[02:27:18.735 --> 02:27:22.158]  A lot of companies are afraid to expand because of what's gone on.
[02:27:22.158 --> 02:27:33.247]  Plus, they don't know which way the economy's going to go after the first of the year, whether those tax breaks are going to remain or whether they're going to be eliminated.
[02:27:33.247 --> 02:27:46.558]  And then on top of it, you have, you know, small and medium-sized companies that have become totally jaundiced at the misinformation coming out of Wall Street and Washington.
[02:27:46.558 --> 02:27:47.859]  So, on a scale of 10,
[02:27:48.672 --> 02:27:55.554]  Maybe two, two, three years ago, ten would have taken the loans if offered to them.
[02:27:55.554 --> 02:27:57.654]  Today, it's probably going to be about three.
[02:27:57.654 --> 02:28:17.900]  And that's why the increase in the GDP, which came in in the last quarter about 1.3%, which is even below what I estimated, if they're lucky over the next two years with $5 trillion going into the economy, they probably will be able to go somewhere between a minus one
[02:28:18.507 --> 02:28:20.649]  And a plus one and a half to two.
[02:28:20.649 --> 02:28:21.610]  And that's it.
[02:28:21.610 --> 02:28:23.211]  Put that in layman's terms.
[02:28:23.211 --> 02:28:26.614]  Put that in layman's terms.
[02:28:26.614 --> 02:28:30.317]  Well, you want a growing GDP.
[02:28:30.317 --> 02:28:40.186]  They spent 2.3 to 2.5 trillion dollars over the past year and a half, particularly over the past 15 months, getting the economy going.
[02:28:40.186 --> 02:28:45.730]  They averaged about three and a quarter percent for five quarters growth.
[02:28:45.730 --> 02:28:46.271]  And they spent
[02:28:47.195 --> 02:29:02.098]  $2.5 trillion, so now the business community, and as you pointed out earlier, that we produce very little anymore, they're not going to want to take the loans they would have before.
[02:29:02.098 --> 02:29:07.019]  And so the results are going to be less on the same amount of money.
[02:29:07.019 --> 02:29:10.240]  And you've got to look forward as well.
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:15.641]  Two years from now, are we going to have had hyperinflation of over 14%?
[02:29:17.799 --> 02:29:26.008]  And if that didn't work to make the economy work better, and believing it won't, are they going to be able to do another program?
[02:29:29.175 --> 02:29:33.036]  But we're already in a horrible recession, bordering on depression.
[02:29:33.036 --> 02:29:41.599]  So, I mean, I want to really quantify this, but I want to go to Rob in Chile, Alyssa in Texas, Mike in Louisiana, Brandon in Arizona, Warren and others.
[02:29:41.599 --> 02:29:45.020]  Straight ahead on the other side with Bob Chapman, we'll look at some other economic news.
[02:29:45.020 --> 02:29:47.001]  And Senator DeMint says ratifying U.N.
[02:29:47.001 --> 02:29:51.283]  Children's Rights Treaty will take over the family in this country.
[02:29:51.283 --> 02:29:52.703]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.703 --> 02:29:55.224]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.224 --> 02:29:57.905]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:03.683]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[02:30:03.683 --> 02:30:07.486]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:30:07.486 --> 02:30:10.368]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.

[02:32:04.418 --> 02:32:05.680]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:05.680 --> 02:32:09.624]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:09.624 --> 02:32:11.847]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:11.847 --> 02:32:17.734]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:17.734 --> 02:32:23.961]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:24.381 --> 02:32:30.364]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:30.364 --> 02:32:34.525]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:32:34.525 --> 02:32:38.827]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:32:38.827 --> 02:32:44.769]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:32:44.769 --> 02:32:48.331]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:48.331 --> 02:32:50.312]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:50.312 --> 02:32:50.732]  It's here.

[02:33:17.872 --> 02:33:20.774]  Okay, I want to go to phone calls.
[02:33:20.774 --> 02:33:21.855]  But Bob, briefly.
[02:33:21.855 --> 02:33:33.263]  I know you're using all the technical jargon as little as you have to, but... I mean, for the general public to understand, because I have trouble following along sometimes, and I try to study this constantly.
[02:33:34.494 --> 02:33:42.397]  I understand the basics of what you're saying, but the system admittedly wanted to bankrupt the economy and their own IMF World Bank documents to consolidate control.
[02:33:42.397 --> 02:33:44.278]  They knew the Timberwolves stuff was bad.
[02:33:44.278 --> 02:33:50.161]  Derivatives they were selling, they were telling the public it was great.
[02:33:50.161 --> 02:33:52.462]  They've paid a fine for that, but no criminal charges.
[02:33:52.462 --> 02:33:55.283]  That's just one small layer of this.
[02:33:57.065 --> 02:33:58.667]  What is their plan then?
[02:33:58.667 --> 02:34:06.814]  You know, steal everything while getting us deeper in debt, just to create the illusion that things are maybe getting better, but then in the end it's going to make it worse?
[02:34:06.814 --> 02:34:10.137]  I mean, what's their game plan, simply?
[02:34:10.137 --> 02:34:14.922]  Well, it's exactly as you put it, and their goal is world government.
[02:34:14.922 --> 02:34:20.027]  It's to take the economy of the world, and particularly the United States and Europe, down first.
[02:34:20.942 --> 02:34:37.046]  Because they essentially have been world leaders from an economic and financial viewpoint and force the people of the entire world to accept world government and give them no alternative.
[02:34:37.046 --> 02:34:43.528]  And that's why I think they'll probably have another war as well and it'll accomplish two things.
[02:34:43.528 --> 02:34:48.469]  Basically, control over people by putting them in a military environment
[02:34:49.782 --> 02:34:53.404]  More fearful of death than anything else.
[02:34:53.404 --> 02:34:57.406]  And being able to get rid of excess population.
[02:34:57.406 --> 02:35:03.148]  That's why I think China will get involved on the other side because they have 1.4 billion people.
[02:35:03.148 --> 02:35:05.549]  And I'm sure they'd like to get rid of half of them.
[02:35:05.549 --> 02:35:06.950]  And I know that's callous but...
[02:35:07.637 --> 02:35:09.478]  That's not what I'm saying.
[02:35:09.478 --> 02:35:14.861]  That's what these people who are behind the scenes are saying that you brought out so often.
[02:35:14.861 --> 02:35:16.322]  And so that's their goal.
[02:35:16.322 --> 02:35:18.083]  That's why they're doing what they're doing.
[02:35:18.083 --> 02:35:22.386]  And they've done it over and over again in many, many previous societies.
[02:35:22.386 --> 02:35:26.568]  Well, Mao and a bunch of other people said repeatedly, let's have a nuclear war.
[02:35:26.568 --> 02:35:28.349]  We want to get rid of most of our population.
[02:35:28.349 --> 02:35:29.210]  That would help us.
[02:35:29.210 --> 02:35:33.132]  I mean, the quotes are a nuclear war would help China.
[02:35:33.132 --> 02:35:34.353]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:35:35.748 --> 02:35:38.049]  That's right, but that's what we're dealing with.
[02:35:38.049 --> 02:35:44.630]  We're dealing with people who have this dream that they know better what's good for us than we do.
[02:35:44.630 --> 02:36:00.775]  They create the crisis, offer their world government solution, but then literally give the private Federal Reserve member banks more money to make us even more dependent, and they call that the solution, and then all it does is kind of give somebody morphine when they have a compound fracture to make them feel better.
[02:36:02.136 --> 02:36:03.257]  Exactly.
[02:36:03.257 --> 02:36:06.800]  And they're going to carry that through to the end because they have to.
[02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:08.401]  There's no way back for them.
[02:36:08.401 --> 02:36:15.867]  Because if we win, and I know we will, then they're going to lose everything they have, particularly their power and their wealth.
[02:36:15.867 --> 02:36:17.528]  And that is going to happen.
[02:36:17.528 --> 02:36:22.432]  And that's why they monitor your show all the time, so they can hear me say that on every show.
[02:36:22.432 --> 02:36:23.673]  Because we're going to come and get you.
[02:36:24.943 --> 02:36:34.451]  Well, I just want to stop the tyranny and start going after the real high-powered criminals instead of having the judicial system turned loose on little people for no reason.
[02:36:34.451 --> 02:36:35.912]  Let's talk to Rob in Chile.
[02:36:35.912 --> 02:36:38.954]  Rob, thanks for holding her on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:36:38.954 --> 02:36:41.296]  Hey, it's great to talk to you guys.
[02:36:41.296 --> 02:36:46.200]  It looks like fourth time was the charm this week.
[02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:53.446]  I was on hold Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday just dying to ask this question to your guest.
[02:36:54.532 --> 02:36:57.353]  And then the show ended, so I didn't get that.
[02:36:57.353 --> 02:36:58.454]  Well, here you are, Rob.
[02:36:58.454 --> 02:36:59.414]  You're on the air now.
[02:36:59.414 --> 02:37:00.314]  Exactly.
[02:37:00.314 --> 02:37:01.175]  Okay, great.
[02:37:01.175 --> 02:37:01.695]  Excellent.
[02:37:01.695 --> 02:37:02.595]  Okay.
[02:37:02.595 --> 02:37:07.517]  So this is a question I'm posing to you and Bob, of course.
[02:37:07.517 --> 02:37:09.358]  Bob Chapman, hello.
[02:37:09.358 --> 02:37:12.539]  Great to listen to you every week.
[02:37:12.539 --> 02:37:14.880]  Okay.
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:22.263]  Are you a neo-creationist, also known as Creation 2.0, now with dinosaurs?
[02:37:23.403 --> 02:37:33.148]  Or do you believe in both the existence of abiotic carbon and its abundance?
[02:37:33.148 --> 02:37:36.690]  Well, I understand the second part of the question.
[02:37:36.690 --> 02:37:45.294]  The clear evidence is there is coal and oil that is made up of broken down dead animals, and they find coal that is just full of ferns.
[02:37:45.294 --> 02:37:46.955]  You can see the imprints of them.
[02:37:46.955 --> 02:37:51.898]  But then there's also the abiotic oil, and more and more top scientists are having to admit that
[02:37:52.338 --> 02:37:54.239]  This oil is replenishing itself.
[02:37:54.239 --> 02:37:59.782]  I mean, I don't think we know all the secrets of this universe and I don't think the scientists know or the preachers.
[02:37:59.782 --> 02:38:05.865]  I just believe in God and I believe in goodness and I think the system creates false debates.
[02:38:07.062 --> 02:38:10.584]  But we know the way evolution is proposed has been proven wrong.
[02:38:10.584 --> 02:38:17.388]  You just don't have a, you know, fish over, you know, overnight turn into a land animal or vice versa.
[02:38:17.388 --> 02:38:21.871]  And I know now in the development of, I mean, scientists just a decade ago...
[02:38:22.851 --> 02:38:28.133]  Or more like 20 years ago, we're saying, oh, the Earth gets hit every 15, 20, 30 million years by a huge asteroid.
[02:38:28.133 --> 02:38:33.734]  Now they say it's every 100,000 because they're able to watch other planets and see what's happened here on this planet.
[02:38:33.734 --> 02:38:36.295]  And so the scientists don't know everything.
[02:38:36.295 --> 02:38:39.856]  Preachers interpret the Bible the way they want.
[02:38:39.856 --> 02:38:43.197]  Interesting question, even waiting to ask myself and Bob.
[02:38:43.197 --> 02:38:45.937]  Bob, did you get the question?
[02:38:45.937 --> 02:38:49.178]  I did, and you answered it perfectly.
[02:38:49.178 --> 02:38:51.959]  And I don't know any more than what you have said.
[02:38:52.637 --> 02:38:54.878]  So I can't add anything to it.
[02:38:54.878 --> 02:38:57.060]  But I have a question.
[02:38:57.060 --> 02:39:00.501]  And this doesn't often happen on this program.
[02:39:00.501 --> 02:39:03.343]  What are the effects of the earthquake in Chile?
[02:39:03.343 --> 02:39:06.165]  And what is the revival?
[02:39:06.165 --> 02:39:07.345]  What's happening there?
[02:39:07.345 --> 02:39:09.206]  Yeah, what's the aftermath six months later?
[02:39:09.206 --> 02:39:09.867]  What's the aftermath?
[02:39:09.867 --> 02:39:11.628]  That's a good question, Rob.
[02:39:11.628 --> 02:39:15.690]  That is a difficult question for me, actually, because
[02:39:17.271 --> 02:39:23.659]  I call myself Rob in Chile because that's where I was the first time I got through to you and the second time.
[02:39:23.659 --> 02:39:25.642]  Alright Rob, I appreciate your call.
[02:39:25.642 --> 02:39:27.564]  It was good to have you on with us.
[02:39:27.564 --> 02:39:29.126]  We've got a lot of callers from Chile though.
[02:39:29.126 --> 02:39:32.831]  They can call in and give us their take on things.
[02:39:32.831 --> 02:39:34.452]  Let's talk to Alyssa in Texas.
[02:39:34.452 --> 02:39:35.454]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:39:36.781 --> 02:39:41.705]  Hi Alex, um, I've been listening to your show for quite a few, for a while.
[02:39:41.705 --> 02:39:44.668]  My husband's been a fan for at least five years.
[02:39:44.668 --> 02:39:52.355]  Um, we've listened, you know, faithfully to your show, and we noticed that you do quite a few cases on CPS.
[02:39:52.355 --> 02:40:03.024]  Well, I, we emailed you earlier on this week, uh, telling you our story, but basically what happened was
[02:40:04.036 --> 02:40:12.159]  We took those stories with a grain of salt when we heard them, but it's a completely different story when it happens to you.
[02:40:12.159 --> 02:40:21.923]  Basically what happened is we have a seven-month-old daughter, she's eight months old now, and she got an injury and we took her to the hospital.
[02:40:21.923 --> 02:40:25.365]  I took her to the hospital because my husband's in the Marine Corps.
[02:40:25.365 --> 02:40:30.527]  Took her to the hospital, CPS called, and they took her out of my hands because my explanation
[02:40:31.667 --> 02:40:31.827]  No.
[02:40:31.827 --> 02:40:34.591]  They took her away from us and put her in foster care.
[02:40:34.591 --> 02:40:34.991]  And they did CPR.
[02:40:50.854 --> 02:40:52.055]  Yes.
[02:40:52.055 --> 02:40:52.915]  And you got blue eyes?
[02:40:52.915 --> 02:40:54.516]  Green.
[02:40:54.516 --> 02:40:55.696]  Oh, that's even worse.
[02:40:55.696 --> 02:40:59.358]  And if you got dark hair and black hair and green eyes, that's one of their favorite.
[02:40:59.358 --> 02:41:00.779]  That's because that's rare.
[02:41:00.779 --> 02:41:03.200]  Ma'am, it's come out in our news.
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:04.941]  It's admitted they have bounties.
[02:41:04.941 --> 02:41:09.443]  They're looking for children and people at the hospital get cuts of the money.
[02:41:10.183 --> 02:41:14.667]  And so you bring your child in, you know, she's having trouble breathing or, you know, her arm's hurt.
[02:41:14.667 --> 02:41:15.728]  I don't know.
[02:41:15.728 --> 02:41:19.832]  And they just snatch him and then you go to the lawyers and they just sell you down the river.
[02:41:19.832 --> 02:41:22.434]  Have they permanently terminated custody?
[02:41:23.226 --> 02:41:24.286]  Not yet.
[02:41:24.286 --> 02:41:27.247]  We can't afford an attorney right now, so basically our hands are tied.
[02:41:27.247 --> 02:41:29.108]  We're fighting the state and we don't know what to do.
[02:41:29.108 --> 02:41:34.690]  And they're going to threaten you to sign forms and say, well give your baby back, just sign these, admit you hurt her.
[02:41:34.690 --> 02:41:36.751]  I mean, have you told the monster?
[02:41:36.751 --> 02:41:44.474]  Let me guess, is it about a 5 foot 5 chubby guy with little piggy eyes who like smiles at you?
[02:41:44.474 --> 02:41:46.914]  Or is it a woman with a short haircut with a crazed look in her eyes?
[02:41:46.914 --> 02:41:48.335]  Because that's the only type they've got.
[02:41:48.942 --> 02:41:49.482]  She's a troll.
[02:41:49.482 --> 02:41:50.563]  I'm just going to say she's a troll.
[02:41:50.563 --> 02:41:51.303]  It's a troll woman.
[02:41:51.303 --> 02:41:51.803]  No, no, sure.
[02:41:51.803 --> 02:41:52.924]  No, well, yeah.
[02:41:52.924 --> 02:41:54.044]  No, I, no, I understand.
[02:41:54.044 --> 02:41:55.385]  I mean, that's only psych.
[02:41:55.385 --> 02:41:59.947]  They hired these so-called investigators to do a sloppy investigation, you know.
[02:41:59.947 --> 02:42:01.588]  Well, here's the next problem, ma'am.
[02:42:01.588 --> 02:42:02.948]  Here's the next problem.
[02:42:02.948 --> 02:42:06.870]  Every child you ever have, even if you try to go to foreign countries, they're going to steal now.
[02:42:06.870 --> 02:42:10.472]  You've got to, you'll never be allowed to reproduce or you'll be a brood mother for them.
[02:42:11.112 --> 02:42:11.292]  Yep.
[02:42:11.292 --> 02:42:11.412]  Yep.
[02:42:36.954 --> 02:42:45.179]  You're gonna, there are different family groups, homeschooling groups, family groups that know all the particulars of it.
[02:42:45.179 --> 02:42:47.801]  I mean, I know it as well, but you need to pull it up.
[02:42:47.801 --> 02:42:52.944]  You need to get, I mean, just search the term groups fighting CPS.
[02:42:52.944 --> 02:42:54.605]  And there's a lot of groups in Texas.
[02:42:54.605 --> 02:42:56.446]  Texas is one of the worst.
[02:42:56.446 --> 02:42:57.627]  And what town is this?
[02:42:57.627 --> 02:43:01.329]  I'm actually in Morgan, Texas.
[02:43:01.329 --> 02:43:03.811]  It's out of Meridian.
[02:43:03.811 --> 02:43:05.372]  Is that your husband in the background?
[02:43:05.372 --> 02:43:05.692]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:07.469 --> 02:43:09.750]  Okay, let me talk to him.
[02:43:09.750 --> 02:43:11.350]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:43:11.350 --> 02:43:11.630]  Good.
[02:43:11.630 --> 02:43:13.391]  Hey, you're going to have to get your family involved.
[02:43:13.391 --> 02:43:14.551]  You're going to have to go on local radio.
[02:43:14.551 --> 02:43:16.372]  You're going to have to have press conferences.
[02:43:16.372 --> 02:43:19.312]  You're going to have to go knock on doors.
[02:43:19.312 --> 02:43:22.013]  You're going to have to go to the mayor's office.
[02:43:22.013 --> 02:43:27.095]  You're going to have to, you know, make a huge deal out of this.
[02:43:27.095 --> 02:43:31.156]  I mean, have they tricked you to sign a bunch of stuff yet?
[02:43:31.952 --> 02:43:32.793]  Not quite.
[02:43:32.793 --> 02:43:34.474]  They're trying to.
[02:43:34.474 --> 02:43:42.680]  They've already got custody, but what they're seeking now is they want me to take counseling and therapy, and I expressed to them that... Yeah, let me stop you.
[02:43:42.680 --> 02:43:45.322]  Yeah, but while they keep your daughter, right?
[02:43:45.322 --> 02:43:46.363]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:43:46.363 --> 02:43:48.304]  And they've got hired counselors.
[02:43:49.085 --> 02:43:57.187]  Who worked for them, who will then lie about you or twist anything you say and do.
[02:43:57.187 --> 02:43:59.228]  They're telling you, oh prove you're good.
[02:43:59.228 --> 02:44:07.910]  So they've gotten a temporary protection order with the judge, which isn't a real court, it's a family court.
[02:44:08.810 --> 02:44:11.751]  Uh, so you need to talk to the experts.
[02:44:11.751 --> 02:44:14.253]  But I mean, actually, this is why I don't like doing this show.
[02:44:14.253 --> 02:44:17.954]  I like to be like everybody else, ignore this is happening, but you can't hide from it.
[02:44:17.954 --> 02:44:21.356]  You know, I told you, your wife is saying she thought it was a joke earlier.
[02:44:21.356 --> 02:44:22.937]  I'm telling you, it's not a joke.
[02:44:22.937 --> 02:44:24.357]  I've opened the door to hospital.
[02:44:24.357 --> 02:44:26.178]  One woman called us to help her.
[02:44:26.178 --> 02:44:28.119]  Then her only crime was she was poor with her husband.
[02:44:28.119 --> 02:44:30.860]  Uh, and they were waiting for an apartments.
[02:44:30.860 --> 02:44:32.221]  They were staying in a hotel for a week.
[02:44:33.067 --> 02:44:37.271]  And the hotel call point is newborn baby.
[02:44:37.271 --> 02:44:45.758]  I opened the door and I get there and the police officer was choking her saying sign it like in a movie open the door and the cops all come they got their hands on their guns.
[02:44:45.758 --> 02:44:46.758]  They all look the same.
[02:44:46.758 --> 02:44:51.562]  It's like a special Guild they have and the CPS workers were like demonic enjoying the torture.
[02:44:53.254 --> 02:44:54.154]  Get out of here.
[02:44:54.154 --> 02:45:02.437]  And Mike Hanson caught some of it on tape and me and Mike came outside and started crying with the evil we'd seen because they were just like nesting demons on the woman.
[02:45:02.437 --> 02:45:05.799]  And they didn't even file her right name.
[02:45:05.799 --> 02:45:06.539]  It was a file.
[02:45:06.539 --> 02:45:12.321]  They used a filing to take the kid from a woman two years before another woman whose kid they'd taken.
[02:45:12.321 --> 02:45:14.142]  And I got on TV and showed the files.
[02:45:14.142 --> 02:45:15.883]  I mean, they don't even fill forms out.
[02:45:15.883 --> 02:45:19.264]  It's just they walk into the judge who's always sitting up there.
[02:45:19.724 --> 02:45:21.005]  I was at the first court hearing and the
[02:45:32.799 --> 02:45:50.370]  It wasn't so much the judge and the sheriffs, because since it's a small town, they all know a lot of people and they're all real nice, but the child protective services, they're all out of Waco and I can... Yeah, but you should have said, judge, we don't know why the baby got hurt.
[02:45:50.370 --> 02:45:51.471]  We were honest about that.
[02:45:51.471 --> 02:45:52.291]  We're a good family.
[02:45:52.291 --> 02:45:53.232]  Give us our child back.
[02:45:54.112 --> 02:45:57.373]  We did, and there was nothing that we could do.
[02:45:57.373 --> 02:46:05.394]  Based on the report that was filed, it painted us up to be terrible and awful people.
[02:46:05.394 --> 02:46:07.875]  What happened to the baby?
[02:46:07.875 --> 02:46:09.695]  Absolutely, and it was all lies.
[02:46:09.695 --> 02:46:11.596]  Yeah, the report had lots of inconsistencies.
[02:46:11.596 --> 02:46:15.317]  No, of course they lied, but I mean, my point is, why did you originally take the baby to the hospital?
[02:46:15.317 --> 02:46:16.397]  And we're going back to Bob.
[02:46:16.397 --> 02:46:17.157]  Why'd you originally go?
[02:46:18.157 --> 02:46:22.439]  We went back... She had a spiral fracture on her femur.
[02:46:22.439 --> 02:46:28.442]  She got her leg caught underneath the couch and rolled over and she got a hairline fracture.
[02:46:28.442 --> 02:46:30.843]  I took her to the hospital... No, let me stop you, let me stop you.
[02:46:30.843 --> 02:46:32.384]  This is your defense.
[02:46:32.384 --> 02:46:40.628]  Doctors, when a baby is born, do a hip test to see if the hip is developed and they routinely cause fractures just doing the medical exam.
[02:46:41.428 --> 02:46:54.108]  And so you go in, you get a doctor as a special witness, a family doctor, pediatrician, whatever to explain, that babies routinely do this, rolling around, they routinely... And so how did you know the baby was hurt?
[02:46:56.188 --> 02:46:57.929]  Because she was crying, I mean, of course.
[02:46:57.929 --> 02:47:00.710]  Okay, so you just say the baby was rolling around the floor and twisted something.
[02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:02.490]  Of course, I took her to the doctor.
[02:47:02.490 --> 02:47:17.215]  And then you get up there, you go to the media, and you get in your uniform, and you start standing outside, you make a big issue in your town, and you go to that newspapers, the local papers, and you talk to them, and you tell them, defend us, and you go absolutely ape.
[02:47:17.215 --> 02:47:19.896]  But I just can't even hear these stories anymore.
[02:47:21.084 --> 02:47:26.409]  When I saw that cop grabbing that woman around the neck, I couldn't even believe it.
[02:47:26.409 --> 02:47:29.651]  This country is so hell-bent on destruction.
[02:47:32.170 --> 02:47:33.991]  I can't even remember all the names of the groups we've had on.
[02:47:33.991 --> 02:47:38.934]  There's a lot of great groups with lawyers that, for free, will help you.
[02:47:38.934 --> 02:47:42.056]  But it's, you know, groups that fight CPS.
[02:47:42.056 --> 02:47:44.198]  And just stay in contact with us.
[02:47:44.198 --> 02:47:47.360]  Send us another email to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:50.482]  And the show's almost, this hour's almost over, and I got a bunch of calls.
[02:47:50.482 --> 02:47:56.105]  Bob, I mean, just hearing that, it makes you want to leave the United States, but they're doing this worldwide.
[02:47:56.105 --> 02:47:57.066]  You're absolutely right.
[02:47:57.066 --> 02:48:00.688]  They've got groups in Belgium that have been doing it for years.
[02:48:01.357 --> 02:48:06.778]  And they export children to the Far East, and it's not only children.
[02:48:06.778 --> 02:48:19.580]  When I was living in Geneva in the late 50s, I knew a young girl my age, whose dad was head of the police department, and I used to talk to him.
[02:48:19.580 --> 02:48:27.542]  And he would tell me our biggest crime here is the spiriting of young people out of the country to the Middle East.
[02:48:28.211 --> 02:48:32.914]  And these people come from everywhere and they just, boom, they just disappear and that's the end of it.
[02:48:32.914 --> 02:48:34.976]  And it's children, it's adults as well.
[02:48:59.492 --> 02:49:02.514]  I'm just sick of knowing how real the crime is.
[02:49:02.514 --> 02:49:04.636]  And people don't know how dangerous this country is.
[02:49:04.636 --> 02:49:10.280]  We had a woman last hour, the health department wrote her a survey saying, do you always put your kids in safety belts?
[02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:11.861]  Do you give them vaccines?
[02:49:11.861 --> 02:49:13.923]  Do you have any mental problems?
[02:49:13.923 --> 02:49:19.707]  And if you're honest, well, one time we had them in the back of the pickup truck out in the field, you know, driving to a creek.
[02:49:19.707 --> 02:49:20.507]  They'll take your kids.
[02:49:20.507 --> 02:49:22.909]  They don't tell you this is a predatory gun.
[02:49:22.909 --> 02:49:26.412]  They take over a million, 200,000 kids a year in this country, Bob.
[02:49:27.887 --> 02:49:31.711]  That's right, and they're going to keep on doing it unless we stop them.
[02:49:31.711 --> 02:49:46.546]  And I'm glad that the young lady and young man called in, and Alex, you send me their email address, and I'll get Drew Rains on this as well, the Marine Disquisition, and I think we'll climb all over them.
[02:49:48.390 --> 02:49:53.812]  Guys, will you make sure when they send us an email, I know we get thousands, but we gotta find their email they've sent us and try to get them some help.
[02:49:53.812 --> 02:49:58.134]  And then hundreds more people call us and I investigate and it's always worse.
[02:49:58.134 --> 02:50:03.516]  And we have a lady works here whose great little daughter is so sweet.
[02:50:03.516 --> 02:50:07.757]  And I talked to her and she had a bruise on the side of her leg at P.E.
[02:50:07.757 --> 02:50:09.458]  and they took her in, they strip searched her.
[02:50:11.192 --> 02:50:29.041]  And they said your mommy did this and she said no and they were trying to take her and then I told her I said don't go home they're gonna be waiting for you at your house because when I heard this happen I said go get her out of school right now they're gonna come take your kid and then they tried and then she went to go ahead and meet with a cps person when she pulled in the parking lot there were cops hiding
[02:50:30.021 --> 02:50:31.442]  In the alley, and I said, get out of there.
[02:50:31.442 --> 02:50:32.403]  I was on the cell phone with her.
[02:50:32.403 --> 02:50:33.023]  I said, get out of there.
[02:50:33.023 --> 02:50:34.224]  And it turned out they were going to grab her.
[02:50:34.224 --> 02:50:36.185]  And she never would have got her little daughter back.
[02:50:36.185 --> 02:50:37.686]  But we got attention on it.
[02:50:37.686 --> 02:50:39.768]  But I can't do this for everybody.
[02:50:39.768 --> 02:50:41.889]  My audience can't always do it.
[02:50:41.889 --> 02:50:45.412]  Or then every time I call for people to aid us, then they'll stop helping us.
[02:50:45.412 --> 02:50:47.273]  When we do ask for the help, we do it constantly.
[02:50:47.273 --> 02:50:49.475]  I can't stop these criminals.
[02:50:49.475 --> 02:50:51.496]  I can't stop the pedophile rings.
[02:50:51.496 --> 02:50:53.858]  These CPS workers, most of them are pedophiles.
[02:50:53.858 --> 02:50:54.478]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:50:54.478 --> 02:50:56.159]  They're bags of pus.
[02:50:56.159 --> 02:50:57.680]  They're child rape and trash.
[02:50:57.680 --> 02:50:58.261]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.431 --> 02:51:06.395]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:51:06.395 --> 02:51:07.395]  What have we got?
[02:51:07.395 --> 02:51:09.837]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:51:09.837 --> 02:51:10.858]  A republic.
[02:51:10.858 --> 02:51:13.500]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:51:13.500 --> 02:51:15.762]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:51:15.762 --> 02:51:17.783]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:51:17.783 --> 02:51:23.347]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[02:51:23.347 --> 02:51:27.010]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:51:27.370 --> 02:51:32.335]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:51:32.335 --> 02:51:33.356]  We have the facts.
[02:51:33.356 --> 02:51:34.517]  We have the Constitution.
[02:51:34.517 --> 02:51:35.438]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:51:35.438 --> 02:51:36.319]  We have common law.
[02:51:36.319 --> 02:51:38.861]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:51:38.861 --> 02:51:42.625]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:51:42.725 --> 02:51:47.688]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.

[02:51:49.189 --> 02:51:50.270]  Don't tread on me.

[02:54:05.197 --> 02:54:15.763]  Everybody in the control room was telling stories about being six years old and jumping off the front porch and breaking their elbow and their parents freaked out at the hospital with CPS trying to take them.
[02:54:15.763 --> 02:54:19.925]  But if you're a young baby, those are perfect to adopt because they won't remember.
[02:54:19.925 --> 02:54:20.966]  And your mother and father
[02:54:21.846 --> 02:54:24.087]  Or white, that's the main groups they hunt.
[02:54:24.087 --> 02:54:36.010]  If you're white trash, or your parents are ugly, or you're not a baby people are wanting, you can be burning your kids with cigarettes, and they use those stories in the media, they won't take their kids.
[02:54:36.010 --> 02:54:48.433]  But if you got a blonde haired, blue eyed baby, or raven hair, green eyes, that's their favorite, because that's really rare, and the rich families will pay big money, and the Arab sheiks will pay big money, it's gone.
[02:54:48.433 --> 02:54:49.413]  It's gone, it's over.
[02:54:50.401 --> 02:54:54.962]  Well, the only thing you can do when you get to that level is be as effective as you can because you understand the problem.
[02:54:54.962 --> 02:54:58.603]  And just like I said earlier when the gentleman and his wife were on, get me the email.
[02:55:20.546 --> 02:55:22.647]  Their email address, and I'll see what I can do.
[02:55:22.647 --> 02:55:27.749]  And they can also go to theinternationalforecaster.com and find the emails there for you and get directly to you.
[02:55:27.749 --> 02:55:30.630]  That's right, and we can put them on to the Marine Disposition.
[02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:38.573]  There's gonna be retired Marine non-coms and officers that live in that area that got connections that could do something.
[02:55:39.298 --> 02:55:42.861]  Yeah, and don't just say, oh, that's their problem, I'm going to play golf.
[02:55:42.861 --> 02:55:44.702]  Or I'm going to be a deacon at the church.
[02:55:44.702 --> 02:55:46.804]  Get in there and start defending people.
[02:55:46.804 --> 02:55:52.628]  This woman's gonna have every child she ever has taken now, they don't get this one back.
[02:55:52.628 --> 02:55:53.869]  Well, you gotta try.
[02:55:54.924 --> 02:55:55.364]  Absolutely.
[02:56:11.246 --> 02:56:16.428]  I meant to get to the rest of your calls, but we're just out of time here with Bob Chapman for this hour.
[02:56:16.428 --> 02:56:18.829]  Bob, we're launching another keyword search today.
[02:56:18.829 --> 02:56:21.711]  We want to make Ron Paul hoax the number one search.
[02:56:21.711 --> 02:56:23.251]  In fact, let's go to Google Trends right now.
[02:56:23.251 --> 02:56:25.812]  It usually takes two, three hours to become number one.
[02:56:25.812 --> 02:56:29.314]  Let's see if Ron Paul hoax has become number one yet.
[02:56:29.314 --> 02:56:32.075]  We'll get a screenshot of it when it does, thanks to your efforts.
[02:56:32.075 --> 02:56:36.197]  And then people will click on that link, and we'll find the article, Establishments Latest
[02:56:37.057 --> 02:56:50.564]  You know, desperate action, Ron Paul hoax explodes in their face and get this article out to everyone because it just shows how dastardly and evil this system is, Bob Shatman.
[02:56:50.564 --> 02:56:58.168]  You're absolutely right and that's our job to help and we're going to do it.
[02:56:58.168 --> 02:56:59.328]  Is it number one yet, guys?
[02:56:59.328 --> 02:57:01.229]  Okay, well it should be soon.
[02:57:01.229 --> 02:57:03.931]  Folks, just keep searching the term Ron Paul hoax.
[02:57:03.931 --> 02:57:05.972]  You can do a secondary search.
[02:57:08.314 --> 02:57:11.615]  You gotta go down to the rudimentary level and that is if you can't afford anything more
[02:57:35.535 --> 02:57:40.480]  Get canned goods, the things you normally eat, and get extra ones and rotate them.
[02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:47.306]  So you get extra food around for when you might lose your job or something drastic happens.
[02:57:47.306 --> 02:57:51.110]  Have a water filter if you can afford to purchase one.
[02:57:51.110 --> 02:57:54.914]  If you have a weapon, that's a good thing because you can defend your family.
[02:57:55.552 --> 02:57:59.177]  And if you got money beyond that, you buy gold and silver coins.
[02:57:59.177 --> 02:58:03.102]  If you have more money than that, and you want some leverage, you buy stocks.
[02:58:03.102 --> 02:58:05.145]  And that's it.
[02:58:05.145 --> 02:58:06.246]  There is nothing else.
[02:58:06.877 --> 02:58:11.679]  And you get the word out because the best insurance for freedom is being active and saying no to tyranny.
[02:58:11.679 --> 02:58:14.101]  The globalists are in deep trouble now.
[02:58:14.101 --> 02:58:16.142]  We have got to stand up against these people.
[02:58:16.142 --> 02:58:19.523]  And I was so shook up by that last call that I was saying Ron Paul hoax.
[02:58:19.523 --> 02:58:23.045]  It's Rand Paul hoax is the search term.
