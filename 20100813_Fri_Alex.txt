[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:22.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.000 --> 00:30.000]  we're live Friday the 13th on this August 13th 2010 Bob Chapman with his once a week visit
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  will be joining us in a third hour to talk about the deterioration of the economy all the latest
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.000]  developments since he joined us last Friday will have open phones throughout the full
[00:39.000 --> 00:48.000]  transmission today incredibly important information on so many fronts with the top
[00:48.000 --> 00:55.000]  story we're going to be discussing today dealing with Rand Paul the Tea Party and the
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.000]  political realignment happening in this nation that's coming up in a moment I am a consultant
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.000]  on the television show conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura and Jesse was here in town
[01:07.000 --> 01:12.000]  yesterday but I'm just going to leave it at that that's why I wasn't here and I appreciate
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.000]  Paul Joseph Watson sitting in in the first hour and we went to rebroadcast some of the
[01:17.000 --> 01:22.000]  most informative interviews we've done in the last month in the second third hour but
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  let me just say this series coming up in the fall is going to be even more powerful than
[01:26.000 --> 01:33.000]  the record rated first season on true TV and I'm sure Ventura will be back on this in the
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.000]  next few months in the lead up to the show airing and we'll be able to break it down a
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  little bit more and tell you a little bit more about some of the incredible adventures but
[01:42.000 --> 01:48.000]  this was serious journalism and hardcore investigations we were engaged in and I will just
[01:48.000 --> 01:54.000]  leave it at that for you today though on a separate issue I did a little interview with
[01:54.000 --> 02:01.000]  Mr. Ventura that will be posting at prisonplanet.tv later next week on other issues and also
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  he did a little shout out to the viewers of this show and listeners of this radio show
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  that will be airing towards the end of the broadcast today but loose lip-sync ships so
[02:12.000 --> 02:19.000]  I won't be talking about the huge investigation we're involved in spearheaded by Jesse Ventura
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.000]  until it airs on true TV hopefully in the fall and then if it doesn't air we'll be able
[02:23.000 --> 02:29.000]  to tell you about it after that but it's set to this is bombshell information.
[02:29.000 --> 02:36.000]  Okay I've got a lot of economic news I want to go over even mainstream media is announcing
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  that this is the end of the free internet as we know it it is internet to the takeover
[02:40.000 --> 02:47.000]  of the old web the end of freedom the FCC's involved the federal trade commissions involved
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.000]  and it's being reported on that Google and Verizon are choking the internet and basically
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  setting the precedent to phase out the free open internet as you know it and so we'll be
[02:58.000 --> 03:04.000]  discussing that coming up will also as I said get into the economy the police state a lot
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.000]  of key health care news climate and energy and environment news and some new wiki leaks
[03:10.000 --> 03:16.000]  developments also the continued escalation going into high gear towards an attack on Iran
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.000]  set for sometime this fall or winter we hopefully can avert that but they may stage a Gulf of
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  Tonkin event or other stage terror attack to get that going but when we come back from
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  break I I really want people to pay close attention to what I'm about to cover because
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  it's bigger than Rand Paul it's bigger than the tea party and it also illustrates the dirty
[03:37.000 --> 03:46.000]  tricks the hoaxes run by the mainstream media of course you know they claim that he kidnapped
[03:46.000 --> 03:57.000]  and bound and gagged a woman and tried to make her use drugs and I could tell by the way it
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  was written and the way the mainstream media jumped on it and how they wouldn't give the
[04:02.000 --> 04:09.000]  woman's name and that it was Esquire a key disinformation outlet that it was pure propaganda
[04:09.000 --> 04:19.000]  and now it is completely confirmed to be a 100% hoax doesn't matter mainstream media is still
[04:19.000 --> 04:27.000]  going and George Soros publications are still going with it and Rand Paul needs to know that
[04:27.000 --> 04:34.000]  he needs to file suit Monday against Esquire as a way to force the hoax out in the open
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  because Kentucky media thinks that their viewers and readers are stupid and it's still reporting
[04:40.000 --> 04:47.000]  that he kidnapped a woman and it's now admitted to not be true I mean this is hard core evil
[04:47.000 --> 04:57.000]  and they're gonna do it more if they get away with it he's got for libel and defamation to sue GQ
[04:57.000 --> 05:04.000]  now this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[05:14.000 --> 05:20.000]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.000]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[05:25.000 --> 05:30.000]  the new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.000]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[07:00.000 --> 07:05.000]  the question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand
[07:05.000 --> 07:11.000]  a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so

[08:36.000 --> 09:02.000]  one of them is atrocity the answer to 1984 is 1776 more than listening to the alex jimmy show
[09:02.000 --> 09:09.000]  is Friday the 13th August 13 2010 thank you for joining us today we're going to get into
[09:09.000 --> 09:16.000]  the economy the military developments with Iran and so much more today but our top story
[09:16.000 --> 09:24.000]  is about gq and there have been other hit pieces by Esquire the washington post about
[09:24.000 --> 09:33.000]  rand paul in the past but specifically rand paul needs to instigate litigation against gq
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.000]  or bare minimum threatened litigation if they do not correct the hoax that they have run
[09:39.000 --> 09:52.000]  against rand paul now last saturday curt nemo wrote a story for info wars dot com detailing
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  the fact that had known admitted democratic party operative on his own facebook on his
[09:57.000 --> 10:04.000]  own myspace had gone out and dressed up as a rand paul supporter posing as basically
[10:04.000 --> 10:12.000]  a racist and wearing a tinfoil hat and local tv and newspapers ran with the story about
[10:12.000 --> 10:20.000]  him and the newspaper one in particular even shot video of him saying that he was a rand
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  paul supporter and then he tried to deny it but then later it came out and they had to
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.740]  admit that he is a democratic party operative for barack obama and has been caught marching
[10:30.740 --> 10:36.200]  and working with rand paul's democratic challenger now you may not be in kentucky you're saying
[10:36.200 --> 10:41.800]  well why should i care about rand paul rand paul announced that we are coming for you
[10:41.800 --> 10:46.640]  washington the american people are sick of you we have a message for you we're taking
[10:46.640 --> 10:52.640]  america back know to your nafta and gat know to your carbon taxes know to the private
[10:52.640 --> 10:57.920]  fellow reserve his father has a perfect voting record against tyranny rand is a chip off
[10:57.920 --> 11:04.060]  the old block and the republican party ran people against him dick cheney campaign against
[11:04.060 --> 11:12.080]  rand paul and rand paul by twenty plus points devastated the establishment republican and
[11:12.080 --> 11:16.960]  we've seen establishment democrats losing like our inspector and others in the primaries
[11:16.960 --> 11:23.000]  in every case the pro new world order pro establishment republican or democrat in the
[11:23.000 --> 11:30.280]  primaries is being defeated in every case but rick perry in texas and he posed as a
[11:30.280 --> 11:39.360]  patriot there he posed as an anti new world order individual when he's actually pro globalist
[11:39.360 --> 11:45.040]  i've got to say as bad as rick perry is he's better than the democratic opponent i mean
[11:45.040 --> 11:52.400]  i'm not into lesser of two evils but in this case it certainly is born out the democratic
[11:52.400 --> 11:57.120]  candidate is openly anti gun pro open border pro world government new world order all
[11:57.120 --> 12:04.640]  the way but side issue rand paul has been set up by the controlled corporate media as
[12:04.640 --> 12:12.400]  the head now even more than sarah palin of the awakening the grassroots realignment that's
[12:12.400 --> 12:18.440]  happening so that they can destroy him and try to embarrass the political realignment
[12:18.440 --> 12:22.920]  that's happening you go to these tea parties it's democrats it's republicans it's libertarians
[12:22.920 --> 12:28.560]  it's third party people their anti fellow reserve looting their anti new world order
[12:28.560 --> 12:37.360]  their anti war predominantly their anti welfare both corporate and individual they understand
[12:37.360 --> 12:43.600]  what's happening a lot of my listeners and supporters and viewers are tea party members
[12:43.600 --> 12:49.520]  you know time magazine new york times have pointed that out what did newsweek call me
[12:49.520 --> 12:57.400]  the prophet of the tea party so they understand these are individuals that are the enemy of
[12:57.400 --> 13:01.040]  the new world order what is the mayack and homeland security reports that we were given
[13:01.040 --> 13:06.880]  by law enforcement in january of last year's show the pentagon the fb i local police being
[13:06.880 --> 13:14.120]  federalized they're being trained to take on the american people and they list them as
[13:14.120 --> 13:19.440]  rand paul supporters bob bar supporters chuck balvin supporters people that want to abolish
[13:19.440 --> 13:24.120]  the irs people that want to abolish or audit the federal reserve people that are against
[13:24.120 --> 13:28.960]  the new world order in global government which is all now out in the open it's americans
[13:28.960 --> 13:33.680]  that want to be free and sovereign we're not left we're not right we want freedom we're
[13:33.680 --> 13:40.800]  constitutionalist we're truth tellers we're we're freedom lovers we're americans of all
[13:40.800 --> 13:46.280]  race colors and creeds and so there have been countless even mainstream reports after
[13:46.280 --> 13:53.120]  we break it and others break it because our supporters are out there as eyes and ears
[13:53.120 --> 13:58.000]  they shoot video of it in portland they shoot video of it in lexington kentucky they shoot
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.880]  video of it in dallas texas they catch video of it in new york in dc where the black caucus
[14:04.880 --> 14:09.680]  will walk through the tea party trying to start a fight the white congressman walking
[14:09.680 --> 14:14.400]  by or being booed just as much the black guys walk together to get a photo op they have
[14:14.400 --> 14:20.440]  the mainstream media there msnbc no one yells the n word no one calls them names they lie
[14:20.440 --> 14:25.440]  and say they were and get caught lying democratic party operatives have been caught with websites
[14:25.440 --> 14:33.120]  that we first exposed nationwide organizing to go out and pose as racist and to wear racist
[14:33.120 --> 14:38.200]  shirts and to call black people names at tea parties and that does two things that makes
[14:38.200 --> 14:43.760]  black people and hispanics and other folks feel insecure and not go to tea parties and
[14:43.760 --> 14:51.200]  then when some do white people are nervous and sometimes are then standoffish so it's
[14:51.200 --> 14:58.240]  a self-fulfilling prophecy of divide and conquer that is going on here and they know exactly
[14:58.240 --> 15:04.920]  what they are doing and you see the government and the media saying you don't want government
[15:04.920 --> 15:09.200]  health care you're a racist you don't want banker bailout you're a racist you don't
[15:09.200 --> 15:16.920]  want barack obama having lavish you know million-dollar parties all the time with taxpayer money
[15:16.920 --> 15:22.280]  you're a racist you're not allowed to criticize any of these policies or you are a racist
[15:22.280 --> 15:28.400]  so you see them invoking division invoking racial issues that's all obama did when he
[15:28.400 --> 15:39.700]  gave a speech last week I guess earlier in the week I guess on monday here in austin texas
[15:39.700 --> 15:44.400]  so they're desperately trying to divide the american people so the offshore banks and
[15:44.400 --> 15:49.600]  corporations that control this country can come in and continue business as usual and
[15:49.600 --> 15:53.280]  finish mopping up what's left of the free market and consolidate it into a globalist
[15:53.280 --> 15:57.680]  monopoly while we're busy fighting with each other over race religion color creed things
[15:57.680 --> 16:02.640]  like that these these political diversions these football issues they play monkey in
[16:02.640 --> 16:07.160]  the middle throwing back and forth above the electorate so there's a realignment that's
[16:07.160 --> 16:12.920]  happened let me go back before I get into rand paul and why this is so important just
[16:12.920 --> 16:25.240]  set in the table here with some history in january in february march april in those months
[16:25.240 --> 16:30.080]  you remember that rick perry would get up and give a speech at a tea party and be booed
[16:30.080 --> 16:35.880]  off the stage senator cornyn would get up and give a speech in dallas or austin or
[16:35.880 --> 16:40.280]  houston to be booed off but was only on youtube and we posted it and pointed out and said
[16:40.280 --> 16:46.760]  look the tea parties are nonpartisan the tea parties understand that bush continue what
[16:46.760 --> 16:52.720]  clinton did and that obama continue what bush did but the controlled left media which is
[16:52.720 --> 16:59.600]  just a cloaking device they put on there they're not left they're not right their establishment
[16:59.600 --> 17:10.240]  consolidators of power they came out starting in austin in march when loy dogged one of
[17:10.240 --> 17:17.240]  the biggest globalist in texas congressman loy dogged the congressman got up he sent
[17:17.240 --> 17:21.400]  letters to his constituents and i had people that work in my office one of his wife is
[17:21.400 --> 17:30.640]  a democrat she got the letter and i said please come to the grocery store at noon on saturday
[17:30.640 --> 17:35.200]  and he's going to talk about health care and other issues so democrats show up start chanting
[17:35.200 --> 17:40.840]  him down say we do not want health care first they're polite and the question answered say
[17:40.840 --> 17:45.040]  we don't want and he calls them right wing extremists and operatives and things they
[17:45.040 --> 17:52.040]  get mad and say no i'm a democrat then he gets chanted out of the building and that
[17:52.040 --> 17:57.240]  was on youtube and got millions of views and msnbc came out and said those are republican
[17:57.240 --> 18:06.280]  party operatives those are republican party lobbyists who paid for people to come on buses
[18:06.280 --> 18:10.200]  and my neighbor was at the grocery store while this was happening it's not true and they
[18:10.200 --> 18:14.880]  had to admit that later so fox comes in and plays along and says yeah they are republicans
[18:14.880 --> 18:18.960]  they set up their new tea party organizations they hype and promote them and try to suck
[18:18.960 --> 18:24.160]  in the tea party and that worked into early this year and then it was all over the news
[18:24.160 --> 18:28.200]  that there was a big split and the tea party said no we're nonpartisan all over the country
[18:28.200 --> 18:32.600]  and we don't want republicans taking us over and so now they were able to start to take
[18:32.600 --> 18:38.280]  it over then they failed in taking it over in the last six eight months and then a true
[18:38.280 --> 18:44.800]  patriot a true anti globalist a true constitutionalist ran paul is attacked by the republican
[18:44.800 --> 18:50.200]  party by dick cheney campaigning against him by the republicans raising money by the neocon
[18:50.200 --> 18:59.440]  publications viciously attacking rand then rand beat by more than 20 points his republican
[18:59.440 --> 19:04.160]  rival who was even over the election commission he was the head of elections and the board
[19:04.160 --> 19:11.960]  allowed that to happen but the margin of victory was so big he lost he lost rand paul won and
[19:11.960 --> 19:16.080]  came out and said we're coming for the new world order we're coming for you i got a message
[19:16.080 --> 19:22.720]  from the tea party washington nafta gad is over your carbon taxes are over your communism
[19:22.720 --> 19:28.800]  is over your takeover of america your hatred of america your elitism he told it like it
[19:28.800 --> 19:34.320]  was and they went into panic mode and he went on rachel madow and he's like excuse me there's
[19:34.320 --> 19:38.040]  a delay she goes are you forgetting rid of the civil rights and he goes yes i can hear
[19:38.040 --> 19:42.440]  you now no i'm not forgetting rid of it they took in the transcript without showing the

[24:13.280 --> 24:20.720]  rand paul if he can win that will turbo charge supercharge real candidates who are anti-globalist
[24:20.720 --> 24:26.840]  pro-us sovereignty and free market taking over the republican and to a lesser extent
[24:26.840 --> 24:32.600]  democratic parties you have the entire establishment in freefall they're playing the race card
[24:32.600 --> 24:35.880]  they're doing everything they didn't just say that he wanted to get rid of the civil
[24:35.880 --> 24:42.200]  rights act when it was a total lie when he was being interviewed he said yes yes i can
[24:42.200 --> 24:47.320]  hear you now no i don't want to get rid of it they took the yes yes because of the delay
[24:47.320 --> 24:53.040]  and took that in the transcript and just had him saying yes yes after she put the question
[24:53.040 --> 24:57.280]  out to him they were probably manipulating the audio that's the way it looks because
[24:57.280 --> 25:02.400]  he can't hear him he's he's he's saying excuse me i can't hear you then they came out in
[25:02.400 --> 25:06.480]  the last two months and said he's not really a eye doctor and then people said well what
[25:06.480 --> 25:11.680]  do you mean well he's not in 15 years or so hasn't renewed his local state license well
[25:11.680 --> 25:16.920]  you don't have to and it turns out he created his own state organization because he thinks
[25:16.920 --> 25:22.960]  it's wrong that doctors have to be controlled by these local institutions and be basically
[25:22.960 --> 25:29.800]  shaken down by him for fees the truth is he's a top eye doctor eye surgeon very well respected
[25:29.800 --> 25:35.440]  and so they ran with that hoax and then that wasn't enough for them so they tried to say
[25:35.440 --> 25:43.280]  he might be a racist with no evidence and then they came out monday in gq to be specific
[25:43.280 --> 25:48.120]  that's who he needs to at least threaten to sue and they came out with a headline that
[25:48.120 --> 25:56.720]  he had bound gagged taken a woman abducted her kidnapped her made her use drugs made
[25:56.720 --> 26:08.360]  her worship water Buddha well what is in the washington post two days ago this came out
[26:08.360 --> 26:14.880]  two days ago but still the huffington post and local kentucky tv and newspapers are
[26:14.880 --> 26:20.560]  still going with this saying well ran paul denies that he kidnapped the woman and bound
[26:20.560 --> 26:27.760]  and gagged her and made her use drugs today they're running news articles and tv shows
[26:27.760 --> 26:32.640]  playing on the ignorance or the perceived ignorance they think you're stupid in kentucky
[26:32.640 --> 26:37.240]  they think you're not going to go read the washington post they think they can keep running
[26:37.240 --> 26:44.560]  with this saying he did this but she now admits ran paul's accuser clarifies kidnapping they
[26:44.560 --> 26:49.000]  should have ran the headline that it was a hoax the woman who sparked a national fire
[26:49.000 --> 26:55.920]  storm by recounting ran paul's youthful indiscretions to gq magazine is now clarifying her account
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.640]  she says she was not kidnapped that should be the headline woman not kidnapped nor forced
[27:00.640 --> 27:09.760]  to do drugs by paul and the intel on this is that it was a big sorority fraternity with
[27:09.760 --> 27:15.560]  hundreds of people at a lakeside party in waco i've been to that lake and so there's
[27:15.560 --> 27:23.880]  a party with people drunk acting stupid and it turns into ran paul kidnapping her it turns
[27:23.880 --> 27:30.160]  into ran paul making her do drugs and she says now none of that's true now you notice
[27:30.160 --> 27:39.680]  she wouldn't say who she was that's always a big red flag this was 27 years ago 27 years
[27:39.680 --> 27:47.200]  ago at a fraternity sorority party you know i got invited to fraternity parties and i
[27:47.200 --> 27:53.640]  went to some of them and i said this is not for me a bunch of drunk people acting stupid
[27:53.640 --> 27:57.160]  but that's what most professional people going to school to be professionals are part of
[27:57.160 --> 28:00.480]  fraternities and sororities i mean i guess it would have been okay if ran paul was at
[28:00.480 --> 28:05.520]  black magic rituals with with people being urinated on and masturbating and coffins
[28:05.520 --> 28:09.760]  that's admitted skull and bones abc news and of course they made a movie the good shepherd
[28:09.760 --> 28:17.440]  that has scenes with matt daemon of course robert de niro directed it and is also in
[28:17.440 --> 28:21.440]  it and it's very historically accurate i mean it's on record that goes on the skull
[28:21.440 --> 28:27.200]  and bones now that's a real you know bizarre secret society with the media around the headlines
[28:27.200 --> 28:34.280]  paul was part of secret society that kidnapped women made them use drugs they tailored it
[28:34.280 --> 28:39.680]  to go after his constituency people that are aware of bohemian growth skull and bones new
[28:39.680 --> 28:43.920]  world order we don't like trilateral commission we don't like bill der berg group we don't
[28:43.920 --> 28:50.080]  like secret societies we don't like drug users it was all tailored she says now no he didn't
[28:50.080 --> 28:56.320]  ever use drugs didn't ask her to use drugs he didn't kidnap her it was a party it was
[28:56.320 --> 29:01.200]  a party where fraternities and i know that's very popular they put blindfolds on people
[29:01.200 --> 29:07.960]  and play games and it turns out he wasn't involved in that wasn't involved in any of
[29:07.960 --> 29:15.280]  it his fraternity was and they and they basically lied and exaggerated to the tenth power about
[29:15.280 --> 29:21.280]  what happened there ran paul go with dignity goes on a few national tv shows and says it's
[29:21.280 --> 29:26.720]  ridiculous i did not kidnap anybody this is not true and in the huffington post runs
[29:26.720 --> 29:32.640]  a headline this morning ran paul runs from tv cameras he goes to a fox studio to an uplink
[29:32.640 --> 29:37.000]  to new york they chase him out of the studio the local affiliate saying you need to talk
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  about this he says it's not true and thank you but but i mean what does this tell you
[29:42.000 --> 29:48.000]  about these people the media in kentucky is still running with this they are still reporting

[33:11.320 --> 33:20.840]  order it's alex jones on the gcn radio network we've got a way to strike back against the
[33:20.840 --> 33:27.920]  people going to rand paul rallies with racist signs and signs demonizing hispanics and black
[33:27.920 --> 33:32.880]  people and trying to associate themselves with rand paul who were admittedly barack
[33:32.880 --> 33:39.000]  obama and democratic party operatives on record we have their face books we have previous
[33:39.000 --> 33:44.120]  news articles about him it's happening all over the country but particularly in kentucky
[33:44.120 --> 33:51.720]  we can counter them for claiming he's kidnapping you know women and blindfolding them and gagging
[33:51.720 --> 33:56.680]  them and making them do drugs because what's happening is the washington post is trying
[33:56.680 --> 34:04.080]  to cover its butt slate and others are doing retractions here's slate more about tyler
[34:04.080 --> 34:10.480]  collins the man who poses a rand paul fan complete with tinfoil hat and of course this
[34:10.480 --> 34:16.400]  came out two days ago we reported on this over the weekend and on monday good job to
[34:16.400 --> 34:21.840]  our listeners forcing the mainstream media to admit they're involved in disinformation
[34:21.840 --> 34:25.440]  that's why they want to start shutting down the alternative media on the web using the
[34:25.440 --> 34:30.240]  fcc and others in the end of net neutrality so you're so the big telecoms can decide what
[34:30.240 --> 34:37.080]  sites you can visit this is the chinese censorship model because we're here you're here countering
[34:37.080 --> 34:41.280]  them every step of the way countering al gore and his carbon tax lies it's coming out that
[34:41.280 --> 34:46.360]  obama and al gore are set to make billions individually off the carbon taxes and own
[34:46.360 --> 34:52.120]  large stakes and companies to do it and the chicago exchange and the british exchange
[34:52.120 --> 34:56.680]  the british exchange is actually owned by gore it's called gore and blood and they got
[34:56.680 --> 35:02.440]  the his partners named blood they don't like the fact that we're here pointing out their
[35:02.440 --> 35:09.160]  lies and disinformation and so there's a way to strike back against this ram paul instead
[35:09.160 --> 35:13.320]  of being you know classy and just saying it's not true he needs to have a press conference
[35:13.320 --> 35:18.040]  go on the offensive and say i'm sick of the hoaxes and people need to know that we that
[35:18.040 --> 35:23.680]  there's been at least five major national hoaxes that paul watson links to that they've
[35:23.680 --> 35:28.520]  run against ram paul in the last three months and it's only going to get worse he's still
[35:28.520 --> 35:33.960]  got his lead in all the major polls of six to ten points but he's starting to lose some
[35:33.960 --> 35:38.520]  of the points because people here and they think whether smoke there's fire he's not
[35:38.520 --> 35:44.320]  really a doctor he's making women do drugs and kidnapping him he's a racist he wants
[35:44.320 --> 35:50.240]  to get rid of the civil rights act he's got racist isn't at his events in every case it's
[35:50.240 --> 35:59.600]  a hundred percent lies in every case it is a fraud we need to get on the offensive and
[35:59.600 --> 36:05.040]  paul watson has written a detailed report that needs to get out to everyone especially
[36:05.040 --> 36:12.880]  kentucky media radio tv and print and especially the the outfits that paul watson links to who
[36:12.880 --> 36:17.800]  are still running with stories that he has racist supporters at his events that he's
[36:17.800 --> 36:22.320]  not a doctor that he said that he was against the civil rights act and wanted to repeal
[36:22.320 --> 36:26.520]  it which is not true never said that that's admitted and that he's kidnapped a woman
[36:26.520 --> 36:33.120]  and made her do drugs it's a big deal and i'm not a litigious person but the few people
[36:33.120 --> 36:37.760]  i've had to sue are folks that would say things like alex is a drug dealer i have proof totally
[36:37.760 --> 36:43.240]  asinine you'll go to alex's sister's high school this was back when she was still in
[36:43.240 --> 36:47.120]  high school she's 14 years younger than me go there and get her police wouldn't do anything
[36:47.120 --> 36:52.200]  i had to sue him not the police but the guy that was doing it you know you know if somebody
[36:52.200 --> 36:58.360]  comes out and says i am kidnapping women i have to sue them because if i don't people
[36:58.360 --> 37:04.480]  are going to believe that i'm kidnapping women i mean they came out in the washington post
[37:04.480 --> 37:08.440]  and they came out in gq and they came out all these other publications but it started
[37:08.440 --> 37:12.320]  with gq and the woman says that's not what she even told gq well that'll all come out
[37:12.320 --> 37:18.920]  in court look you can say anything you want as long as it's defended by the truth that's
[37:18.920 --> 37:23.840]  a hundred percent defense or that you at least believe something but she says she didn't
[37:23.840 --> 37:28.640]  tell them this that it was a fraternity party and that he didn't make her do this and that
[37:28.640 --> 37:37.440]  he didn't kidnap her and that she didn't say that rand paul you need to go on the offensive
[37:37.440 --> 37:42.760]  and then use the offensive of exposing this hoax to expose the other hoaxes because kentucky
[37:42.760 --> 37:47.440]  media and other national media like the huffington post they're still going with it today they've

[42:19.800 --> 42:24.080]  then in some cases hundreds of newspapers and blogs and others it's always over 30 or
[42:24.080 --> 42:28.720]  40 then write about our report and it becomes the number one search term and instead of

[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.840]  even mainstream news admits that the google horizon deal will end the free
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.680]  internet as we know it
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:38.840]  they've got to shut down the internet because they can't have us responding to
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.080]  their lies
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.280]  and disinformation in the mainstream corporate horror media
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:48.080]  but for the last hour i've been talking about dirty tricks in politics and how
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.600]  last monday gq magazine who deserves to be sued for it
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.760]  came out and said ran paul kidnapped a woman made her do drugs and the way they
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.160]  wrote it
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.960]  total deception has now admitted it's all lies none of its truth
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.720]  the woman's told the washington post she didn't even tell them that
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:08.600]  but it shows how dirty these people are and now a lot of mainstream media mainly
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.680]  in kentucky where they think folks in kentucky aren't
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.200]  seeing national news
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:16.680]  they're still going with the fact that he's kidnapping women
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:20.760]  lock up your wives and daughters here comes ran paul
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.880]  so we are launching a new key search term today so that it links through to
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.280]  paul watson and
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.600]  the story i helped write
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.840]  establishments latest desperate ran paul hoax explodes in their face ran paul
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.640]  hoax is the search term
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.600]  and i appreciate everybody taking action with this
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.720]  this is a big deal
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.800]  i want to open the phones up on any subject you want to discuss but
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:41.920]  now i'm looking at these flashback articles that watson has posted under
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.080]  this story
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.640]  flashback former obama campaigner caught provocaturing is racist tea party
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.360]  members
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.480]  flashback
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.480]  uh... ran paul strikes back at mainstream media smear machine flashback
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.880]  the establishment is in full blown panic over ran paul flashback
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.120]  ran paul survived smear campaign to maintain healthy lead over conway
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.320]  flashback racist
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.840]  uh... government
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.240]  impose segregation laws not two-year-old ran paul
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.340]  that's just some of the articles detailing
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:13.360]  uh... all of this we're open the phones up in the next segment
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.560]  on any issue you wish to discuss
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:19.800]  one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.000]  one eight hundred
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.080]  two five nine nine two thirty one
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:28.040]  but what's happening here is
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:31.640]  the alternative media they reported what a year and a half ago now gets more
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:32.600]  visitors
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:36.560]  in total than all the mainstream media combined
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.440]  and our lead is growing
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.080]  and the mainstream media
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:44.600]  is imploding newspapers tv cable all of it
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.400]  fox news poses his patriot so they have more than all the other cable shows
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.560]  combined
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.480]  river murdoch understands that
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.040]  so they're moving to try to start her tailing and shutting down the web and
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.800]  that's coming up at the bottom of the hour a lot of new developments
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.760]  uh... on that front
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.280]  and they're also trying to arrest people all over the country for videotape and
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.280]  police and public legal areas
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.520]  they don't care if it's a false charge they want to intimidate people
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.760]  the system is out of control
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.760]  the system is going for broke
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.480]  so we'll talk about that as well
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:17.720]  uh... but you agree with me that this is important what's happening around paul
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:20.280]  and shows how desperate these people are
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.960]  and how ruthless they are
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:22.800]  and how
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:26.120]  wicked and criminal they are it's criminal
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.720]  to come out and say
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.800]  that your neighbor kidnapped you when they didn't
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:34.640]  and bound and gagged you and made you use drugs
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:37.160]  now did this woman commit the crime
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.960]  of lying and saying this happened
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.160]  reporting a false crime is illegal
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:45.280]  and it's also serious defamation and libel
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.920]  or is she telling the truth i tend to believe her that
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.000]  gq lied about this and what she said
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.040]  that it was a fraternity party at the lake
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.680]  a bunch of people and it was sorority fraternity games a blindfolding people
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.520]  which is standard
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.440]  see they'll take something standard
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.360]  and turn into secret society drug use
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:05.000]  and kidnapping women ran paul
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.440]  cult member remember
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.240]  remember on monday secret sec
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.680]  tailored to make patriots not liking
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.520]  and then over and over again they come with lie after life or lie people start
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:15.520]  saying
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:19.240]  well some of it's got to be true they say doesn't have a medical license
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.320]  which is true
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.320]  they say didn't graduate from college admittedly not true they say they don't
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.080]  like black people not true they say
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.760]  he doesn't like the civil rights act he said no i'm you know not for repealing
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.000]  it
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.040]  they're sending people to pose as racists at his events that's admitted
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.960]  this shows you who these people are
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.560]  but the globalists just don't send people to pose as racist at a patriot's event
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:48.080]  they blow up federal buildings to blame it on us
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.760]  they staged terror attacks to launch new wars
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.920]  this is a microcosm of the big things they do
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:58.040]  they're a bunch of criminal frame-up operators who play the dirtiest tricks
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.240]  imaginable
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.480]  you may be arrested and or subject to other police action

[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:57.400]  rituals now admittedly not true but it's footnotes in the
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:00.360]  washington post it's footnotes but other
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:05.320]  kentucky newspapers tv and other national publications like the
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.960]  huffington post that's bigger than most major newspapers
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:11.240]  are saying he's running away from the allegations
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:15.800]  and i want to play this clip and analyze it and then we are going to
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:20.200]  go to your phone calls but ran paul takes page from sharon angles playbook
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:26.200]  runs from reporters this is today two days after it's admitted the woman says
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:30.360]  it's not true he didn't kidnap me didn't make me do drugs uh you know
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.640]  gq lied about this
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:38.200]  they're still going with it going oh he's running from this he went on that
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:43.400]  fox affiliate with satellite uplink to new york to be on fox where he went on
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:46.440]  and said it wasn't true but they took selective clips
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.200]  of him during the interview where he where cavuto would ask the question
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.720]  and then it would cut to their in-camera not the feed they were sending fox
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.720]  national fox new york but it would cut to him putting his mic on and
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:02.440]  putting his head down and sighing to create the psychological vision
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:06.680]  in kentucky where this is aired that look at paul he's asked did you do it
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.480]  and he's
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:13.880]  it's him waiting for the interview just like rachel madow
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:17.640]  gets him on and says do you want to repeal the civil rights act and he's
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.400]  going excuse me i can't hear you yes yes i can hear you now
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:25.400]  say that again no no i'm not forgetting rid of it and they take the transcript
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.520]  knowing the video shows that he didn't say get rid of the civil rights act the
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:32.120]  transcript is rachel madow asked are you forgetting rid of the civil rights act
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:36.200]  as your person running against you says and he says yes
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:41.160]  yes yes but yes yes i can hear you say that again
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:45.400]  they don't show that just yes the headline get rid of the civil rights act
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:50.680]  ran paul yes what is rachel madow and msnbc think of you what does the
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.680]  huffington post think of you what does the local fox affiliate think of you
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:11:00.280]  what does uh the lewisville courier journal and others think of you
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.640]  the courier journal i checked this morning before airtime
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.880]  a week later a week ago it was exposed now the guy admits he's a democratic
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.280]  party operative dressing up saying i don't like
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.560]  illegals are destroying america with a tinfoil hat on
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:19.080]  admittedly a fraud admittedly a hoax they're not retracting
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:24.440]  let me tell you something folks back last year when richard poplowski
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:29.160]  was drunk got home at 3am he already had one pit bull living with mommy out of
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:33.160]  the marine corps richard poplowski this is on record in the court
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:37.800]  transcripts and it came out days after the media knew this
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:42.200]  he gets a second dog he's gone it it it uses the bathroom and peas all over
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.960]  the floor his mother says i'm kicking you out if you
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:49.960]  don't get rid of these dogs then she says i'm calling the police to
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:54.280]  throw you out he's still drunk at 7am
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.680]  the police arrive he gets his semi-automatic ak47
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:04.360]  and shoots and kills three cops in cold blood within two hours of the standoff
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:09.320]  beginning and ending alex jones in the pittsburgh paper
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:12.520]  he loved me they had some guy on the street within an hour of it
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.480]  saying he did it for alex jones look completely staged
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:19.000]  then it came out from the message board that he hated me
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.480]  that he said that i was a zionist agent that i was covering up for israel
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.840]  when all we do is criticize israel when they're warmongering and things i'm
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:29.480]  against attack in iran i was against the iraq war i'm
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:33.880]  against apac in the lobby but he was one of these brainwashed
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.920]  people following the howl turner co-intel pro
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.400]  admittedly he is fbi to to to radicalize the liberty movement
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.600]  and try to make it white supremacist so it's not effective what do you see the
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:49.000]  democrats doing dressing up like racist this is their game plan they hate me
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.520]  because i'm waking people up because i'm for real i'm bringing blacks whites
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:56.920]  Hispanics agents together against tyranny and i
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:03.480]  on air said and send emails to raw story and to the daily costs and to that
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:06.760]  newspaper and i said i'm gonna have to probably sue you
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:10.280]  because i'm in danger with you telling cops nationwide and turned out the
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:13.400]  rider basically is the beat reporter for the southern property law center
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:17.000]  he was almost exclusively reports on that i said i'm gonna have to follow a
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.040]  lawsuit here and then that same newspaper went
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.480]  in and tried to do copyright claims on me even showing their articles about me
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:28.440]  on air which we defeated i had to do a federal filing on it
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.960]  they didn't want me to show the article to defend myself about me
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:36.600]  and and and and say this is wrong and i i mean i and i was ready
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:39.320]  yeah you think i want to go get a high-powered lawyer and prepare a case
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:42.760]  and do it right to make sure i win you think i got time for that
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.680]  but you can't say that i made a guy kill three cops
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.880]  i came within one inch to sue in the statesman when they
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:53.640]  mixed it all together and said some sites are praising joe stax attack
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:57.080]  the alex jones blog and then they had another sentence made it look like i
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:59.640]  was for it
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:04.040]  they're after me ladies and gentlemen they're saying i want cops dead i want
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:07.000]  planes to fly into buildings when it's the opposite of that
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.040]  and i got retractions in five newspapers and publications within one day
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:17.240]  five retractions now rand paul needs to demand retractions he didn't kidnap
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:21.080]  anybody he didn't blindfold he didn't get
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.440]  he didn't make her use drugs she is in the washington
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:29.000]  post today and the headline should say
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.560]  rand paul's story was a hoax and the washington post that ran with it
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:36.840]  the day of the esquire report and went along with it reported it
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:41.880]  as inflammatory as they could to demonize rand paul
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:47.640]  the way they crafted that article
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:51.320]  they did everything they could and what do they do today hope people don't
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:56.200]  notice this the plumb line greg sergeant exclusive rand paul's accuser
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:00.280]  clarifies kidnapping and then it reads her quote she said he did not kidnap me
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:06.360]  or make me use drugs it should say accuser
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:14.120]  reverse's story let me show you a headline that's actually proper
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.400]  this is the type of headline this is from hot air
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.840]  rand paul's kidnapped victim oh by the way you didn't kidnap me
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:24.600]  and there's other publications saying it's not a true because she admits it
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.160]  now and it goes on the woman who sparked a national
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.960]  firestorm by recounting rand paul's youthful
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.600]  indiscretions she's still saying it was indiscretions
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:36.120]  they're not backing off to gq magazine is not clarifying her account
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:47.960]  she says she was not kidnapped nor forced to do drugs by paul
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:52.040]  and she's going on to say that i mean she needs to go public she needs to be
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.840]  specific she needs to not you you're allowed under the
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.320]  bill of rights to face your accuser and not be
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.200]  lynched in the court of public opinion let's go ahead and go to this local
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.880]  fox piece that i'm going to your calls look at this demonization piece
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:07.560]  where they cut shots of him not even alive to make it look like he's
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:10.520]  hesitating to make it and then they say that he
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:13.480]  ran from them when he said look my wife's really hurt by this and it's not
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:16.200]  true and i've done my interview nationally and i'm
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.600]  leaving and they spin it like he's running from the
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.360]  allegations here it is
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:27.640]  good evening i'm marvin Bartlett an article in a national publication is
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.720]  putting a lot of attention on kentucky's republican candidate for us senate
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.040]  ran paul's in our studio this afternoon to tape an appearance with fox news
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.400]  and gave a roja spoke with him about what the article alleges
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:45.000]  first on fox by now responding to controversial reports has become common
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.320]  place for us senate candidate ran paul but as he sat in our studio waiting to
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:54.040]  record a national interview for fox news dr paul faced tense moments
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:57.560]  watching the clock and preparing to control an increasing amount of media
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:02.120]  damage we now have a hundred different media outlets
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.920]  some who pretend to be real media outlets
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.920]  saying i kidnapped someone it all began with this gq article
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:12.520]  which quotes an anonymous woman claiming when she and paul were classmates at
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:18.760]  baler university paul blindfolded tied up and kidnapped her
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.160]  what i say is please spare us the details the woman who asked to remain
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:26.200]  anonymous because she now works as a clinical psychologist
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:29.240]  goes on to say paul tried to force her to take drugs
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:33.800]  and worship an idol known as aqua buddha it didn't take long for the story to
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.200]  spread
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.240]  show little short clips of what he said and then show his eyes shifting before
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:44.920]  the interview so you don't get fully what he's saying to make it look like
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:49.720]  he's halfway agreeing with this she says no kidnapping no forced drugs
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:54.120]  it was a party at a lake with sorority fraternity
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:57.160]  games well and i'm not into that stuff but i looked it up and i remember
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:00.760]  hearing about it in college that yes that's one of the more popular games
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:04.920]  where the girls tie up the boys and the boys type the girls so this turns into
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.760]  ran paul kidnapped woman made her do drugs i mean
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.760]  you can't say somebody beat you up or raped you or kidnapped you
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:16.360]  you get in trouble for that you can't say somebody robbed a bank if they didn't
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:20.120]  and gq this woman probably did have what she said spun
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:24.520]  they need to retract big time not some minor footnote
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:28.200]  all right i'm done talking about this we're gonna go to holly dan
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:34.600]  big cat james joe and others 1-800-259-9231 on the other side of this

[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:16.600]  hi mr. jones i recently received a community health survey from the
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.720]  county i live in and i was wondering if you'd ever heard
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.680]  of one of those and then i have a couple of sample questions if you're
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:26.040]  interested in hearing them yes the federal government mainly but also private
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:31.160]  corporations give grants to local cities and counties
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:34.600]  to ask invasive questions like do you have health problems do you vaccinate
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:39.880]  your children do you own firearms they've now in the last five years
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:45.320]  federally basically paid off the american medical association and others
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.160]  the dental associations the nursing associations to turn them into spies
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:53.640]  or when pediatricians get your children they say does mommy spank you
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:57.000]  do they hurt you while you're in the waiting room uh are they giving you
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.920]  your shots uh does mommy smoke marijuana they're turning
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:04.840]  basically all the professionals into spies it's part of top secret usa
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:08.840]  that the washington post reported on but yes i'm aware of those surveys i mean
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:12.760]  what particularly does it say holly well um of course

[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:20.600]  going to ask other questions and it's like they're wolves i had a lot of
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:23.240]  state police are nice they've pulled me over i've been in a wreck and they've
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:27.560]  been real nice uh but driving to poor ranzis a few years
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:32.360]  ago it's four years ago um i had two children then we hadn't had our
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:35.880]  wonderful third yet and i was going two miles over the
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:39.640]  speed limit they still pulled me over and they came over and the guy had
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:43.080]  horrible green teeth and horrible breath and he had a woman with him
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:47.320]  as a male and female team and uh my children were both asleep in the back
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:50.600]  seat in their seats fully buckled in they said we want to examine these
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.840]  looks like you've got this done wrong and of course then i said listen
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:57.720]  you can see it's all buckled in right they wanted to check the understrap
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:01.480]  they were real wolf-like looking at us like we were ham sandwiches or
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:04.200]  something and this is what they do and they're
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:07.400]  just training them that you're bad you're a criminal
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:11.000]  ma'am i've actually seen these before even in texas
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.080]  so they're it's like a little survey oh did you not buckle your child in
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:18.600]  and they're not telling you this is a police interview
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.880]  and let me guess the letter probably implies that you're supposed to fill it
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:25.480]  out uh do you have it in front of you i do it
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:30.440]  it does say it's voluntary but i i thought it was ridiculous it's 10 pages
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:33.320]  and then on the very next page after it asks you if you
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:38.040]  buckle your um child in or not it asks you if you have any emotional or mental
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:43.800]  health um issues or concerns um on the back of it it has your address
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.560]  your address is actually on the survey and it has this little identification
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:51.160]  number they've um given it well you know what that's for
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:54.600]  you know what that's for a lot of times you'll have a husband and wife that are
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:58.200]  fighting with each other that are on the verge of of divorce
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:01.400]  and they'll do that to break up the family and the woman of the man will fill
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.080]  it out and say yeah my wife you know let them ride in the back of the pickup
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:08.840]  truck down the dirt road to the pond and boom you're gonna have police
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:13.320]  your kids are gone and it's just high five nothing like getting the prisoners
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:16.520]  and this is a form of like the catholic church using confession
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:20.440]  to control and spy on people in the old days you know kind of during the dark
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:25.400]  ages this is something that they do and yes it's federally funded or
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:30.200]  sometimes private foundations uh and they'll send cps if you say yeah i've
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:36.280]  been depressed lately and also on the the fed said this in 2000 and 2010
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:42.360]  they want to make uh first census is uh yearly then monthly then weekly
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.720]  under the local health department and then you're going to get home visits
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.320]  already if you're in head start you get three visits a year by cps
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:52.520]  and it's just training you that you they come to your house you line up they
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:55.720]  come in and inspect you're a prisoner the government owns your house owns your
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:59.560]  children uh but that's a that's par for the course ma'am

[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.600]  coming number three in some areas of the country
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:27.080]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation

[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:01.000]  we're working together on some really bombshell
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:06.840]  information i did talk to jessie about uh some fun stuff like the running man
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:10.280]  and predator and batman and robin and uh
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:13.480]  you know some of his history and and the alternate ending
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:17.960]  of the running man uh the one that they didn't use and also some serious issues
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:22.440]  that aren't related to the story stories that he was here in austin working on
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:24.760]  with me uh that we're going to put up next week for
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:28.840]  prisonplanet.tv viewers uh and of course air here on the radio show but
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:32.120]  that's coming up next week an interview i did with jessie
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:34.760]  in between some of the investigations that we were doing while we were in the
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:38.120]  car but there's governor jessie ventura
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:42.920]  right here in this chair that's a his second visit here to austin to see me
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:46.600]  he came out i guess about two years ago and i well no it's the third visit i met
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:50.200]  him in austin actually san antonio originally four years ago four and a
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:54.520]  half years ago and boy he is really a smart guy in person
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:57.400]  he you know he's intelligent well spoken on television
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:01.320]  uh and and as governor but but in person he's just a really interesting guy
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:04.840]  what a character and more and more looking at him and talking to him
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:07.800]  i recognize something because i hadn't watched john wane movies in probably
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:11.720]  ten years in the last few months i uh saw a couple
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:17.080]  john wane films and the mannerisms and the way his eyes look and the way he
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:19.640]  talks i was kind of looking at him going wait a minute
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:22.120]  you kind of look a little bit like john wane in a weird way and he goes you know
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:25.560]  i was told that by a big hollywood producer they said if john wane had been
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:28.280]  alive while you were in hollywood he'd have been you'd have been in all their
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:30.360]  movies i've actually been told that by
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:34.280]  one of the directors and uh that uh worked with john wane
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:38.360]  so he's just such a character okay let's continue with your calls what a
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:43.160]  chilling comment from holly and you notice before she even started
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:46.600]  talking she said do you get these health department surveys and i said yeah it's
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:49.640]  asking do you vaccinate do you have guns
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:54.040]  uh you know do you know do you have your kids in seatbelts mental health stuff
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.520]  it's all standard and i've told you this
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:00.200]  the doctors aren't even conscious of this the first time i went to the hospital
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:04.120]  to for my wife to give birth to my son
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.800]  the head nurse said will you please take these papers downstairs
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:10.840]  for me and i said sure i came back my wife went
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:14.280]  and she's sitting there with her water broke going into labor she goes uh
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:18.040]  they were asking me if we have guns or if you know there's any family violence
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:20.680]  or and obviously you know there's guns but there's no family
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:23.960]  violence uh and i said yeah and then i of course
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:27.240]  experienced that the next two times but but by the second i said
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:31.720]  you want me to take this file downstairs for you
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:34.680]  while you do the health department deed lady
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:38.600]  if you i know about your show yeah that's what i'm doing
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:42.920]  and you do this with everybody well yeah i do and then the other nurses were in
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:45.640]  there you know when they're washing the baby you know
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:48.440]  getting them ready and all that and you know you have to say no i don't want the
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:51.480]  vaccine sign of form you're like we don't vaccinate
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:55.320]  either we know it's bad yeah a lot of parents are saying no i sometimes half
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:00.680]  of them depending on the week so you're going you're totally
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:04.200]  vulnerable wheeling your wife in
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:07.320]  and you know because they make them get in a wheelchair once you you know get to
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:11.320]  the hospital and and and it's like loving doctors and nurses and we
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:14.760]  actually are friends with the doctor she's a great lady and a patriot and
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:16.920]  watches the show listens to the show but but it
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:20.200]  it still doesn't matter the nurses and everybody have these computer
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:23.160]  laptops and screens on the walls and they're just

[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:13.960]  big cat in Kentucky big cat i bet you're calling in about rand paul and the
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:15.960]  demonization campaign against him
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:20.120]  uh... yes sir i am alex and greens from the great commonwealth what i really
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:24.360]  wanted to do is kind of give you uh... uh... an inside view of what's going on
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:28.040]  here uh... as in the revolutionary war where artillery
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:32.280]  wouldn't precise and they just ballied and hoping they hit something well
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:35.320]  that's what the democrats are doing here in kentucky because
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.000]  predominantly as a as a commonwealth we vote
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.120]  republicans in a national uh... national elections as you know sentence and
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:48.920]  and for the uh... president one dot but the attack is on our local
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:54.520]  tea party patriot uh... patriot contestants that are running on the
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:57.800]  republican uh... ticket they're using ran paul
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:01.960]  as the boogeyman or though some have been locked in to get that democrat vote
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:05.960]  out for them before they'll go in exactly vote
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:10.040]  vote that straight democratic party line for all these local races that we have
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:14.680]  a lot of people that are running on the on on the tea party support here and
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:17.640]  they're all in the republican party so
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:21.480]  that's what's really going on and and then i think it is ample
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:26.600]  we got uh... uh... the six district uh... congressman race here
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:30.080]  we uh... we have uh... been channel running and
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:34.680]  the chairman bookie gave him a permission not to vote on the cart bill out
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:36.760]  because she had a note uh... not both
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:41.000]  well he is running his whole campaign on that he voted no
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.800]  for the cart bill out but of the rest of his vote are party line
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:49.960]  voting in the earlier republican that cheney and others in the neocons are
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.560]  supporting us rand
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:56.840]  he got record money in that senate rate from goldman sacks and others
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:01.560]  yes yes and and and every time you know it's kind of like when obama shows up
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:05.400]  the camp that campaign for you it's kind of the same thing with dick cheney
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:08.680]  but uh... this is a nightmare though this is a nightmare for them
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:12.520]  can you imagine ron paul in the house rand paul in the senate
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:16.360]  going in the next year and a half to the twenty twelve election cranking up
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.920]  to get ron paul into the presidency and more and more ron paul type
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:24.680]  libertarians and constitutionalists seeing that they can win
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:28.920]  for county commissioner dog catcher school board
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:33.080]  mayor legislature state legislature congress
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:37.800]  senate we're discovering we can win every incumbent
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:41.880]  except for in a few cases like rick perry losing in the republican and
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:46.280]  democratic primaries i mean this has got the system scared so they want to
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:50.200]  demonize rand paul who's seen as the personified true
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:54.600]  patriot libertarian tea party as a kidnapper
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:57.480]  and and and now i've been scanning through
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:01.960]  yesterday and today's tv radio and newsprint and am i correct in saying
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:05.160]  the media is still implying this is a scandal
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:08.040]  and not retracting even though the woman two days ago admitted
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:11.000]  he did not kidnap her he did not make her use drugs
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.280]  and most the story is is not true or an exaggeration
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:18.440]  do you think that that is that that is the the ammo they're using right now
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:23.080]  they've not let up on it here locally um... yeah i know you uh... exactly
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:26.360]  nationally nationally they're backing off because they're
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:29.320]  the washington post and g q reliable
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:32.840]  but locally from what i've seen they are pouring it on heavy
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:36.840]  we've got to get this out nationally and in kentucky that this is a hoax and
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:39.320]  that's why we're doing the search term
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:43.160]  uh... today that is so important ran paul hoax
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.880]  and that'll become the number one search term hopefully thanks to our listeners
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:49.160]  ran paul hoax and we'll leave them to our article
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:54.600]  showing not one not two not three not four but five hoaxes against him
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:58.600]  each the newest one more dash really in the last
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:01.400]  and it'll just show you who these people are
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:04.840]  yeah and i'd like to uh... and i'd like to uh... thank you
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:08.520]  all the fellow info warfare warriors that are doing this for us here in
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:11.560]  kentucky and uh... i would like to mention uh...
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:15.800]  uh... uh... west collins for the sixth district he's running a
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:19.320]  writing campaign and doing a bang up job and if anybody would
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:23.400]  you know i know the times are hard but would like to donate him you can go to
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:27.960]  west collins two thousand and ten dot com and and look over
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:32.120]  his uh... his platform they can let me ask you one more question i gotta go
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.000]  we should support all the good candidates locally all over the country
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.120]  but but rand's the figurehead as you said they're making him the bin laden
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.720]  here trying to turn him into that you know from the choir boy to bin laden
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:46.280]  and it's not working but it is as much as they like but it's having some effect
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.760]  is people aren't really paying attention they just kind of hear the
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.880]  background noise and the retractions are done in the back of the paper not the
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:55.160]  front of the paper like the original lines
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:59.320]  are people starting to get though that the system is running hoaxes against
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:01.400]  team in kentucky
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:05.560]  uh... well like i said we're predominantly democrats and they're
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:10.360]  laughing it up with the bread and the soup spoon but we have a contingent here
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:13.720]  fighting there's a lot of tea party patriots here fighting
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:17.720]  but you know you it's kind of like going to a gun fight with a knife you know
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:21.160]  we're just outnumbered we're out man you know when you have the two biggest
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:25.880]  papers in kentucky every day there's something about rand there's nothing
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:29.560]  about jack conway whatsoever it's always about ran
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:32.760]  and you know listen i gotta jump up to great points big cat
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:36.280]  so telling us from kentucky what we've observed from texas and the rest of the
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:40.680]  nation uh... the cavalry's on the way the info warriors are going to get this
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:45.720]  article out to everybody establishments latest desperate rand paul hoax
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:49.160]  explodes in their face folks are out there in mass and i commend them
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:52.760]  searching the term rand paul hoax you need to go to all the big newspapers
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:56.040]  online letters to the editor in their comments
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:59.000]  talk radio tv you tell them you better retract
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.280]  but i think rand needs to get on the offensive against these people
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:07.240]  uh... let's go ahead now and talk to james and ohio james you're on the air
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:10.840]  alex how you doing good i i just wanted to
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:16.680]  give you a little bit of an update my uh... district is uh... jim traffic
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:19.880]  and uh... they disqualified him didn't i
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:25.160]  well they it's still uh... update they did disqualify that he's going to be on
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:28.120]  the ballot with his name as an independent
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:33.480]  he turned in uh... a little over thirty five hundred signatures and
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:37.320]  he had to have twenty one hundred uh...
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:41.800]  registered voters in them signatures and they say he came up like
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:46.120]  thirty two short which is a yeah well i'll say this time
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:49.960]  traffic and into paul traffic can't you can say what you want about him was
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:53.480]  clearly railroaded that evidence is overwhelming
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:57.160]  and you know if they get away with saying rand paul's kidnapping people
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:00.600]  and making him use drugs which they admit isn't true that you know they may try
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:04.440]  to falsely indict rand i mean these people don't play games
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:08.520]  no no they uh... my uh... one of my professors
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:13.240]  was on the uh... he was the jury foreman for jim traffic its first trial
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:17.000]  and just like a second trial it was totally one-sided
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.160]  it would let jim get any evidence in the they had no real
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:25.000]  solid evidence other than hearsay and people
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.920]  being kinda much enforced along
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:32.760]  but uh... yeah they are uh... they're trying everything they can to just keep
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:36.680]  them off the ballot well i'll tell you this uh...
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:39.720]  jim said he really wants to come back on the show
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:44.360]  but his number has changed i guess just so we got the number so folks there
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:46.760]  uh... get jim to the contacts we want to get him back
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:50.040]  on the broadcast or i've got his address i just send him a letter
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:52.360]  i just haven't gotten around to that let's send traffic and a letter today
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:54.680]  guys uh... thank you so much uh...
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:59.000]  james let's talk to joe in pa you're on the air
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.440]  hey uh... hello mister jones how are you good sir welcome
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:06.000]  uh... first of all uh... i wanted to
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.800]  i don't know if anybody has said this or not but uh...
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:13.120]  the google uh... when they were blocking that search term thing
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:14.720]  you know put in the
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:19.440]  the searches yes uh... i went to msn yahoo
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:20.960]  and i just kept
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:24.200]  search and search and search and like over a couple hundred times
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.240]  no problem
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:28.200]  and then i went back to google
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:31.760]  it was him like after like a hundred times it's just that i got that error
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:32.480]  message
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:36.120]  yeah i don't think people should do it that way i think people should just go
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:39.600]  you know search around click on the stories type it in five or six times
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:42.480]  because that's you know naturally occurring basically we want to see this
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:44.000]  is the top story
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.360]  uh... i think when they put those automatic computer systems in the just
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:49.160]  do it you know a whole bunch
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:52.640]  that that's why it'll go up for a few hours is the number one search and then
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:54.840]  they'll make it non-searchable
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:59.520]  in the google trends but by then scores of newspapers and others pick up on it
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:03.280]  it becomes the number one search term and it's very very effective another way
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.080]  to go after him
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:08.480]  is to have two search terms launch one at the start of the show
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:12.480]  which we've done ran paul hoax
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:15.880]  and that will lead you to our article proving the hoax and the entire history
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:17.880]  of the last five hoaxes
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:18.880]  or
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:19.960]  you can
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:21.200]  uh... search it
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.800]  do a second search
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:25.560]  because that'll confuse them they won't get around that
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:28.800]  and uh... you could type in
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.120]  something like
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:32.160]  latest desperate
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.400]  so type in
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:35.320]  ran paul hoax
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:38.480]  by itself those three words rampol hoax but then also
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:41.720]  after you're done doing that type in latest desperate
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:45.280]  latest desperate because we we did this with one of the
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:46.600]  ten searches we've done
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:50.600]  we had two in one day and they were both number one and number two
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:51.920]  in both categories
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:54.880]  and and one of them got passed them was up there for about a day and a half
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:59.720]  that actually happened with some obama term searches so multiple torpedo attacks
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:02.120]  also gets through other computers
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:04.400]  uh... so latest desperate
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.160]  and then that will lead people
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:11.360]  to the uh... ran paul hoax story so search ran paul hoax is one search by
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:12.160]  itself
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.440]  and latest desperate
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:16.480]  latest desperate
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:20.520]  uh... as another
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:23.840]  search term or or you could just type latest desperate hoax
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:27.480]  and if it that's probably better than three word latest desperate hoax
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:29.880]  latest desperate hoax that's one search
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:31.960]  and then ran paul hoax
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:33.360]  that's the main one
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.960]  and if people will do that will have a devastating effect but i can menu for
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:37.400]  doing anything else job
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:40.760]  yeah the other thing i want to do i got to thank you you can i can begin to
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:42.040]  thank you because
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:46.360]  i got to listen to your website just as feel saying i have a facebook
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:48.760]  page i got a hundred twenty seven friends
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:53.520]  and i bombarded with news from not just your site but all kinds of sites
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:54.680]  and nobody
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:56.560]  comment on anything
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:00.600]  and i even say you don't even have to do the research is already done for you
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:01.640]  and they're like
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:02.840]  my kids got
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:04.000]  a tooth loose
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.400]  and they just i i just i think it's very difficult they don't see themselves in
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:11.360]  the mode as a leader or a defender they see themselves as jellyfish
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:15.640]  people that just repeat what the media says and who are spectators in life
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:18.120]  and that's why the establishment is moving against
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:21.020]  humanity because they know a lot of people are jellyfish and then they're
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:24.880]  demonizing active people as if it's weird to be for freedom
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:29.200]  it's dangerous it's terrorist to be against offshore banks run your country
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:31.360]  but keep it up joe you're doing a great job
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:33.000]  uh... let's go to
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:33.760]  philip
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:35.320]  in florida
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:37.480]  uh... you're on the air

[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:46.840]  are not a problem
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:50.800]  uh... i want to say one thing i called gq public relations today a lot
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:52.280]  the uh...
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:56.000]  public relations guy a nice little message his number is two one two
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.760]  also a lot of a lot of a lot of let me just stop you want to make sure it's not
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:03.500]  his personal home number this is the official gq phone number
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:06.600]  yet but gq public relations
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:10.000]  i call on behalf of uh...
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.760]  i call on behalf
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:14.680]  i'm sorry i'm a little nervous uh... first-time caller like i said
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:17.040]  i call on behalf of ran and i just don't

[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:30.160]  but the reason a lot of national host won't let people give out numbers is
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:31.720]  people can do it
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:34.600]  to the wrong number or say it wrong or do it
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:40.120]  to call some innocent person and then we're liable show

[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:44.960]  yourself
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:48.320]  uh... and then put into a search engine i'm sure tell the truth
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:51.040]  fell up when i come back to you i just got a double check a number before we
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:52.280]  give it out okay
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:54.800]  we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen stay with us
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:59.080]  we'll give a call to gq who ran the hoax that ran paul was kidnapping a woman
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:00.960]  and now they miss our trip
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:04.400]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:07.880]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:11.560]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:12.840]  than silver or gold
[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:16.160]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:18.400]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:20.600]  so our friends at solutions from science
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:23.680]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:25.960]  they call it a survival seed bank
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:30.120]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:33.840]  family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.000]  in any way
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.280]  you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:44.280]  today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:48.600]  them a call at eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five

[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:22.920]  which was sort of the copy
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:27.160]  of all these right wing zionist within the senate that are about popping up
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:29.160]  uh... the uh... propaganda for war
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:32.080]  uh... if you're not going to if you're not going to be against
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:36.960]  israel and uh... by the uh... move towards world war three against rand
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:39.040]  uh... the wellspring of everything before

[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:49.200]  dick cheney came and campaigned against rand and said he's soft on terrorist
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:52.880]  and soft on wars because he is against the wars
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:56.360]  and he knows the stuff is hyped up and exaggerated in the fraud
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:00.440]  the main neocon attack engine spent record money
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:01.320]  for his
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:04.040]  uh... challenger in the republican primary
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:07.200]  the democrat is way more more pro war
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:10.600]  now uh... rampall has said is if america is attacked
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:14.280]  he would be for defending america and then other people spun it
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:15.160]  that way
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:17.280]  okay it's ridiculous john

[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:27.880]  william christold
[02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:29.480]  national review
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:33.840]  dick chaney all the neocons
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:35.240]  i mean literally
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:37.800]  scores of them
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:42.760]  demonized him for not being for the wars demonized him for being his father's
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:44.320]  son demonized him
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:46.280]  for wanting to cut defense spending
[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:47.640]  demonized him
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:50.960]  but in these debates he said well of america's attack
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:53.360]  i'm for defending ourselves
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:56.640]  and meanwhile newsweek is attacking him the conservative backlash against
[02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:00.160]  rand paul this is may 19th this is a couple months ago
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:02.240]  because he's not pro-war
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:05.240]  but then meanwhile you got all the co-intel pro and i'm not saying jones
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:07.680]  that but i see it
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:11.840]  i mean listen i looked at what peter schiff said and i said i think it hurt
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:13.880]  him and he did lose by the way
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:15.920]  in uh... connecticut
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:18.400]  to a true neocon
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:20.840]  and he said well this is how you get elected in connecticut i said no that's
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.080]  not how you get elected
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:23.440]  now what he said
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:26.840]  is neoconish to a certain extent i still like him on
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:30.240]  finance a lot of things he would have been better than this other lady
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:32.760]  but with rand paul it's not the case
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:37.200]  uh... and then john is just chomping at the bit with such anger
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:39.120]  and aggression towards me
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:40.360]  and then saying if you're gonna
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:43.960]  if rand paul's in a cover-up for israel's other stuff he wants to end aid to
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:46.200]  israel and every other country
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:47.760]  i mean this is crazy
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:49.240]  and let me guess john
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:53.100]  do you not like ron paul either is is is is ron paul
[02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:55.120]  a tool of israel as well
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:59.120]  i like to find out about his foreign policy issues naturally i don't think i'm
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:00.320]  going to stop you again
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:03.440]  is ron paul bad too
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:08.280]  no not on half of his opposition to this is repression to hear the fact that he's
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:11.320]  against these wars that israel and military industrial complex you're
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:13.560]  trying to drag us into world war three with
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:14.960]  i disagree of course
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:17.960]  with his right wing economic policies which i think i've dealt with the
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:19.320]  last three times
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:23.680]  and john you are you are in a valid socialist communist correct
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:27.240]  i'm not i'm not arguing any of that here i'm gonna ask you a question you've
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:30.280]  called for years plugging how great communism is
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:33.800]  i'm just showing how distorted all of this is
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:39.240]  now is that you don't like libertarians you don't like constitutionalist
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:41.200]  okay communism doesn't work
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:42.240]  okay so
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:45.160]  the establishment decided to go after him because you know there's a lot of
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:49.200]  people don't like israel by claiming he supports everything israel does when
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:49.960]  he doesn't
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:53.080]  it's just like me i can make films exposing the u.s. is liberty
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:56.520]  i can criticize the wars i can be against things israel's doing and people
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:57.400]  lie
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:01.640]  and say that i say if you criticize israel you're a weak-minded idiot
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:03.960]  no that's not what i said that's another hoax
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:06.680]  what i said is is clear as a day
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:12.160]  is that if you say i work for israel as people put out this hoax and with no
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:15.640]  evidence and i think that lies that you are a weak-minded idiot
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:16.360]  okay
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:18.200]  it's it's ridiculous okay

[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:23.000]  the patriot movement

[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:28.760]  it
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:30.200]  and and and

[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:53.800]  getting rid of the

[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.680]  you might become successful

[02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:10.560]  calling in here
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:11.840]  with communism
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:14.400]  socialism it's gonna save us

[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:22.160]  it gets old
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:26.320]  the entire republican machine was demonizing and running hoaxes against
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:26.760]  him
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:29.720]  the democrat machine all wedded together
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:32.160]  pulling out every stop against him
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:34.440]  and you don't have the common sense
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:38.000]  to be able to know this is the guy we want the u.s senate
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.600]  but regardless you won't they're playing the race card to control people all of
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:43.840]  it
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:47.920]  so go out for the democratic enjoy it buy into the hoax find everything else

[02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:05.720]  sand
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:06.720]  what have we got
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:09.120]  a republic or a monarchy
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:13.000]  a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.080]  democracy not mob rule
[02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:17.960]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our
[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:18.840]  land

[02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:38.880]  he didn't go one-tenth as far as peter shifted
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:40.960]  in his attempt to get elected
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:45.280]  because he was about attacked by dick cheney all the top neocons

[02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:56.200]  the issue is he wants to abolish the federal reserve and now the democrats
[02:08:56.200 --> 02:08:57.120]  have come out
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:08:59.720]  with a hoax story in gq
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:01.360]  saying he kidnapped a woman
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:04.400]  he made her do drugs she's now recanted says that's not true
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:07.880]  uh... it's not even recanted she said that gq twisted what she said he didn't
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:11.720]  kidnap or didn't make her you drugs it was a fraternity party at a lake
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:14.600]  and that none of that happened
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:18.000]  they said he's against the civil rights act they've said that he doesn't have a
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.120]  degree which they admit it's not true now they've sent democratic party
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:25.920]  operatives out we've covered it all posing as racist that's now admitted
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:27.800]  how many more hoaxes
[02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:29.680]  do we have to see and then meanwhile

[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:34.920]  and tie israel enough
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:37.800]  it's just everything revolves around that that's
[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:41.160]  people just sit there like birds and trees like israel israel israel israel
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:45.440]  no other issues now let's not get the vice-phenol lay out of the water
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:49.320]  let's not take our local communities back let's not abolish the federal reserve
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:55.200]  let's just show off and say i'm more anti-israel than anybody else
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:58.440]  and then when people criticize israel they go that's not enough scum you
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:01.400]  didn't prove yourself and i mean it's all a bunch of
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:04.640]  holier than now people not getting anything done
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:07.720]  just running around complaining constantly
[02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:09.240]  and it's crazy
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:12.480]  i mean that the whole system is coming after ran paul
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:17.640]  pulling out the stops with dirty tricks the likes of which i have never seen
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:20.520]  it's starting to have an effect lowering some of his poll numbers he's still
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:22.000]  got a good lead
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.360]  but you know if they come out and say he's killing nuns tomorrow
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:28.320]  or they come out and say he killed the Loch Ness monster or they come out and
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:32.400]  say he killed jesus or they come out and say he killed kennedy lincoln
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:35.080]  he tried to kill george washington
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:39.360]  if you slip on a banana peel he put it there if it's a rainy day ran paul did
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:43.560]  it if you got a stomach ache ran paul caused it
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:45.360]  ran paul wants to
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:47.040]  eat little black children
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:49.400]  i mean they are really getting desperate
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:52.000]  bob i want to get into the economy a bunch of the news with you but what's
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.120]  your take on all this
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:56.760]  it's called
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:59.000]  disinformation
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.320]  and it's a form of propaganda
[02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:04.800]  uh... it's used usually
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:07.480]  and psychological operations
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:11.960]  and it has been used for a long time in the united states
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:13.720]  and they don't want
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:16.880]  ran paul in office and they're going to continue
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:21.320]  to mislead the public through this program and people have to be informed
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:22.520]  like you are
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:25.480]  and telling them look uh... this is not fair
[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:27.680]  uh... what they're saying is untrue
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:29.000]  uh... these people
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.160]  don't care about truth
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:34.360]  i mean just look at the background of people like cheney
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:37.880]  and people in the central intelligence agency
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:41.360]  other agencies of the government
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.920]  they have been running
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:44.920]  private armies
[02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:47.480]  private killing squads
[02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:49.800]  all to make money
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:52.840]  and uh... you know
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:55.840]  years ago i was approached by these people
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:58.600]  and told him to take a hike
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:02.320]  and they approached me because of my background
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:03.360]  and it
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:04.680]  and they said
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:07.800]  the last real time i refused within
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:10.240]  nineteen sixty six
[02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:13.720]  and i've had trouble ever since with the government
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:17.560]  because they don't want me around because i won't play their game
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:20.280]  uh... so i know what these people are up to
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:22.720]  and alex you're absolutely right
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:25.240]  let's get on with what's important
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:27.600]  these diversions
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:28.600]  should not
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:30.240]  cloud the mind
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:32.680]  of intelligent people
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:35.240]  don't listen they're not true
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:38.200]  and he's jealous and dead as i see out there
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:40.080]  a ridiculous
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:43.280]  and i put up with the for the same thing for years i guess ignore them
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:45.080]  they keep right on going
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:48.280]  but then again i don't have a program on radio and i have
[02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:49.920]  don't have to
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:52.880]  directly defend myself as you do
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:53.840]  and so
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:56.400]  uh... let's get on with the job
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:58.880]  let's stop all this foolishness
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:01.280]  let's get ran paul
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:05.080]  elected well i mean i mean the entire power structure
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:07.240]  is going after him and running
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:10.120]  in many cases criminal operations
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:11.960]  uh... just incredible
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:13.320]  frauds
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:17.160]  and can't people see and i guess most folks do that's why he's got a six to ten
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:18.240]  point lead
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:19.960]  that this is a fraud
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:22.720]  and i mean and cast sunsteen two years ago said
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:27.560]  the government media mainstream media lost so much credibility we've got
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:32.040]  to radicalize the conspiracy culture people that don't trust the system people
[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:33.240]  that are awake
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:36.840]  and make them so radicalize they look unpalatable everybody else
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:38.720]  and we've got a start in fighting
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:42.440]  just like cohen tell pro so anybody who's real anybody who's good like
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:45.160]  ran paul myself you run paul others
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:46.520]  judge depolitano
[02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:49.240]  we're going to be attacked because we're actually winning
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:52.360]  we're actually in the poll position we're actually affecting change
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:55.400]  we're actually getting people to hear what we're saying we're accurate
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:57.360]  what we've said has come true
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:58.320]  and the system
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:01.520]  is attacking us from the media the mainstream media the government the
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:06.600]  think tanks the george soros groups the fake alternative media because we're
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:10.320]  having an effect they're after us because we're in the lead car we're
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:12.160]  winning
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:14.200]  and you're absolutely right and
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:17.360]  i sent you an email today i never send you emails
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:22.200]  uh... to prove that we're winning and it was a gentleman who lives in england
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:23.760]  we started to make
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:27.840]  uh... videos and he's sending them out and putting them on the
[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:29.440]  on the internet
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:30.800]  uh... because
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:33.480]  he wants to try to do something
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:36.440]  and i just wanted to show you by sending you one of them
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:38.120]  uh... what he was doing
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:41.640]  and it's not what alex is doing because
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:45.000]  he's not on that level of expertise but the point is
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.320]  the motivation
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:49.320]  is reaching people all over the world
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:50.400]  to step up
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:53.200]  and say what i could put up with this anymore
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:55.920]  and this is what we're going to do and we're going to inform people
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:57.600]  of what's wrong out there
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:59.120]  because we're telling the truth
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:02.240]  and we want you to know about it
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:03.560]  well said
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:08.120]  i get into the serious uh... issues of the day
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:12.960]  uh... here's some of the financial headlines right now
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:16.680]  fed leads america to the brink of collapse paul joseph watson and it goes
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:19.000]  through cnn new york times all of them
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.280]  admitting okay maybe it is a depression maybe it is a collapse
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:25.360]  uh... feds new round of quantitative easing predicted is two weeks ago now
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:26.400]  they're announcing it
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:27.600]  is likely
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:31.560]  is like trying to patch leaky pipes by pumping in more water the washington
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:33.840]  blog said that was washington blog
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:38.200]  uh... all the jobless numbers the manufacturing numbers going down
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:40.120]  i mean this is really happening let's
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:42.600]  let's get into the latest financial developments and i want to get into
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:44.240]  issues like senator de mit
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:47.520]  ratifying u n children's treaty would turn
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:52.120]  uh... parental rights over the international community bob chapman
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:56.080]  well it was about six ago a week ago on this program that we started to talk
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:15:57.200]  about it
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:01.720]  and it's come to fruition and there was no way out for the fed
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:04.880]  and what they said they were going to do was to
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:07.280]  take the interest that they are receiving
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:08.920]  uh... from the
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:13.200]  collateralized at obligations someone point eight trillion dollars worth that
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:14.520]  they'll admit to
[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:16.200]  that they purchased
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:18.480]  and they won't tell us what price of course
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:20.280]  from banks and others
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:24.480]  and they're going to use that interest to buy treasuries and agencies
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:25.600]  thereby
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:28.320]  putting more money back into the economy
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:31.840]  and uh... they even have proposed to sell
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:36.440]  these collateralized at obligations back to the bank that they bought him from
[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:38.880]  and that brings up the question again
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:41.520]  what did they buy him for and of course they won't tell you
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:44.520]  but my guess is around seventy cents on the dollar
[02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:48.440]  and they'll tell them back to the banks probably for fifteen or twenty
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:52.120]  uh... another gift and free up that much
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:53.280]  uh... capital
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:54.920]  as well as interest
[02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:58.760]  uh... that uh... they had on the books uh... previously
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:03.200]  but we we don't know exactly what they're doing because they won't tell us
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:05.760]  and we might find out a year or two from now
[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:07.680]  but that's not a good because
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:11.400]  you know we need to zone in on what's important presently
[02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:12.680]  so essentially
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:15.600]  the feds going to do what i said they were going to do
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:18.040]  five trillion dollars will be injected
[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:22.360]  into the u.s. economy and probably other economies of as well
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:24.120]  over the next two years
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:26.520]  they want to bring this thing through
[02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:29.320]  uh... this election in the following one
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:32.560]  and they're going to continue to
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:35.520]  inject money into the system by doing that
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:37.800]  also in the repo market
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:39.360]  uh... with a by
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:41.240]  securities from banks
[02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:43.160]  usually treasury paper
[02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:45.000]  and the banks in turn
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.560]  turn that money over to eighteen dealers
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:51.840]  who are instructed every day how to break the markets
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:53.800]  then in addition to that
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:58.840]  we have the back to a sitting over on over a trillion dollars now
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:01.400]  they will lend the money by the fed
[02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:03.360]  with no interest
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:07.160]  they gave the money back to the fed and again two and a half percent
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:09.040]  which you get to pay for
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:13.080]  and i think that the fed going to do is either the lower the interest rate
[02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:17.080]  or they're going to stop paying an interest in the bank in the fractional
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:21.720]  fractional banking system will take the trillion and they'll make it into five
[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:23.760]  trillion
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:28.600]  and what's going to happen then is that money's going to go for loans
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:30.840]  to the small and medium-sized
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:32.960]  bank uh... businesses
[02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:35.200]  that create seventy percent of the jobs
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:36.600]  and they're going to try
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:38.240]  to
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:39.840]  bring up
[02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:41.720]  the economy that way
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:44.760]  uh... but they're going to be relatively successful
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:47.520]  uh... what i mean by that on the scale of ten
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:50.120]  uh... three years ago it would have been a ten
[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:52.840]  this time it's going to be a three or four
[02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:54.720]  and other words the
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:57.160]  the the battle to keep the
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:18:58.840]  uh... economy of flow
[02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:03.680]  will barely keep its head above water for the next two years if they do
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:06.560]  what i said i think they're going to do
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:07.720]  now bob
[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:12.120]  uh... how did you know three weeks ago in the two weeks than last week
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:15.480]  that they were going to make this announcement with so much precision
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:18.400]  uh... i've seen none of this in the news anywhere there was a lot of financial
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:20.080]  shows mainstream
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:23.200]  no wondering what was going to happen they now they are saying the feds in a
[02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:24.840]  basically start to boil this down
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:27.960]  monetizing debt so a how did you know that we're coming back from break and go
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:28.640]  to calls
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:29.520]  be
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:30.840]  how did you know
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:32.520]  that we're coming back now we'll do it then
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:34.040]  how did you know
[02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:34.920]  a
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:37.520]  and then be what is this going to do
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:41.240]  because we're already going into a depression you say it'll slow it a bit
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:44.080]  uh... how does more debt do that how do they raise taxes
[02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:47.760]  to them put the stimulus back out there they claim the last stimulus
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:51.080]  was for the general public but it was for the big banks not mainstream
[02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:54.240]  you're saying this will go to the big banks but then they will put some of it
[02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:55.560]  out to mainstream
[02:19:55.560 --> 02:19:58.000]  but how can mainstream even afford to get loans
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:01.120]  we'll be back with bob chapman
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:04.200]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:05.560]  solar power generator
[02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:09.440]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:10.800]  bill number two
[02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:14.520]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:15.680]  allows you to have
[02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:19.800]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:21.320]  technology is coming
[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:24.920]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:29.040]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:33.400]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:36.920]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:40.960]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:44.240]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:48.200]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information

[02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:12.040]  ladies and gentlemen do you realize what a depression means to this society with
[02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:17.080]  no industrial base with a public that's almost completely dependent and not
[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:21.080]  self-sufficient myself included and I don't know how to run a farm and grow
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:24.920]  everything I need I've got some storeable food Bob how did you know this was
[02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:31.960]  coming and in what measurable effect will it have well I kept on scratching my
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:37.960]  head still about the episode in Europe the short positions in the euro and the
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:43.080]  long positions in the dollar by New York and London banks and I figured
[02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:50.840]  finally what they were up to and that was the the signal to number one make a
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:55.960]  lot of money and number two to bring pressure on the euro so that the dollar
[02:24:55.960 --> 02:25:01.120]  would get stronger and the reason they wanted the dollar stronger was that they
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:08.440]  had something planned and that plan was to as I figured out to have the fed
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:13.240]  reserve inject this tremendous amount of money over the next couple of years into
[02:25:13.240 --> 02:25:18.000]  the economy and that would negative the effect the dollar and so that would the
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:24.080]  dollar would go down the stock market would go up if temporarily only it would
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:29.920]  go up so it went down to not approximately 96 9700 and the Dow it
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:35.440]  after I made the exclamation exclamations here on this program it
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:40.920]  popped up to 10,700 and after that happened I said it's going to go back
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:48.760]  down probably to 10,000 maybe even to test 96 80 at the same time the dollar
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:55.800]  came plummeting down and it dropped from 89 to almost 89 to almost 80 and it's
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:26:01.240]  pulled back up into the 82 3 area because it had a rally based upon the
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:06.040]  fact that the pressure was off and I think there was a great deal of help
[02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:10.680]  from the same cast of characters in New York and London that drove the dollar up
[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:14.680]  in the first place they wanted to give it a bounce because what the feds going
[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:19.760]  to do is extremely negative to the dollar and it's very positive for gold and
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:26.000]  silver because it's going to create inflation and how much we don't know
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:33.760]  inflation I believe is running over 7% John Williams the eminent economist who
[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:39.080]  I follow quite closely is talking about a higher number than that but it's up
[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:43.320]  there and while the government says no we don't have any inflation and of course
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:46.680]  they don't know how to tell the truth that's just like I say we have 9.7
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:52.040]  unemployment when it's over 22% well it backed off here a little with the the
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:55.920]  last numbers because they dropped people off the end end of the system so to
[02:26:55.920 --> 02:27:00.680]  speak it's running around 21 and 3 8 to a half right now and it'll probably get
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:04.320]  the 20 but I don't think it'll get any better than that over the next couple
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:08.800]  years stimulus do and can small companies even get these loans will they
[02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:13.880]  go out and get them I mean where are we 12 months from now I think the second
[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:17.800]  part of your statement will they go out and get them a lot of companies out of
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:22.400]  business a lot of companies are afraid to expand because of what's gone on plus
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:26.880]  they don't know which way the economy is going to go after the first of the year
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:31.400]  whether those tax breaks are going to remain or whether they're going to be
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:37.200]  eliminated and then on top of it you have you know small and medium-sized
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:44.480]  companies that have become totally jaundiced at the misinformation coming
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:49.920]  out of Wall Street in Washington so on a scale of 10 maybe two two three years
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:56.160]  ago 10 would have taken the loans if offered to them today it's probably
[02:27:56.160 --> 02:28:02.760]  going to be about three and that's why the increase in the GDP which came in in
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:08.400]  the last quarter about 1.3% which is even below what I estimated if they're
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:12.200]  lucky over the next two years with five trillion dollars going into the economy
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:18.960]  they probably will be able to go somewhere between a minus one and a plus
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:23.800]  one and a half to two and that's it put that in layman's terms great job put
[02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:32.440]  that in layman's terms well you want a growing GDP they spend 2.3 to 2.5
[02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:36.520]  trillion dollars over the past year and a half particularly over the past 15
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:42.160]  months getting the economy going and they averaged about three and a quarter
[02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:50.000]  percent for five quarters growth and they spent 2.5 trillion dollars so now
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:55.560]  the business community and as you pointed out earlier that we produce very
[02:28:55.560 --> 02:29:00.320]  little anymore they're going to be ready they're not going to want to take the
[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:05.320]  loans they would have before and so the results are going to be less on the same
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:10.920]  amount of money and you know it you got to look forward as well two years from
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:18.360]  now are we going to have had hyperinflation of over 14% and if that
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:24.160]  didn't work to make the economy work better and believe me it won't are they
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:30.640]  going to be able to do another program but we're already in a horrible
[02:29:30.640 --> 02:29:34.920]  recession bordering on depression so so I mean I want to really quantify this but
[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:39.640]  I want to go to Rob and Chili Alyssa in Texas Mike Louisiana Brandon in Arizona
[02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:43.560]  Warren and others straight ahead on the other side with Bob Chapman look at some

[02:33:17.560 --> 02:33:24.280]  Okay I want to go to phone calls but Bob briefly I know you're using all the technical
[02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:29.800]  jargon as little as you have to but I mean for the general public to understand
[02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:32.600]  because I have trouble following along sometimes and I try to study this
[02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:37.160]  constantly I understand the basics of what you're saying but the system
[02:33:37.160 --> 02:33:40.560]  admittedly wanted to bankrupt the economy in their own IMF World Bank
[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:45.640]  documents to consolidate control they knew the timber wolf stuff was bad
[02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:50.280]  derivatives they were selling they were telling the public it was great they've
[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:55.000]  paid a fine for that but no criminal charges that's just one small layer of
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:00.480]  this what is their plan then you know steal everything while getting us
[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:04.320]  deeper in debt just to create the illusion that things are maybe getting
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:07.920]  better but then in the end it's going to make it worse I mean what's their game
[02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:14.920]  plan simply what's exactly as you put it in their goal is world government it's
[02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:18.720]  to take the economy of the world and particularly the United States and
[02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:25.080]  Europe down first because they essentially even world leaders from an
[02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:31.760]  economic and financial viewpoint and force the people of those of the entire
[02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:37.600]  world to accept world government I give them no alternative and that's why I
[02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:43.360]  think they'll probably have another war as well and it'll accomplish two things
[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:49.880]  basically control over people by putting them in a military environment and more
[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:56.200]  fearful of the death than anything else and being able to get rid of excess
[02:34:56.200 --> 02:35:01.080]  population that's why I think China will get involved on the other side because
[02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:04.760]  they have 1.4 billion people and I'm sure they'd like to get rid of half of
[02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:09.920]  them and I know that's callous but that's not what I'm saying that's what
[02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:14.320]  these people who are behind the scenes are saying that you brought out so often
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:17.840]  and so that's their goal that's why they're doing what they're doing and
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:22.760]  they've done it over and over again in many many previous societies well now
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:26.640]  and a bunch of other people said repeatedly let's have a nuclear war we
[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:29.440]  want to get rid of most of our population that would help us I mean the
[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:36.160]  quotes are a nuclear war we would help China I mean it's insane that's right
[02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:40.280]  but that's what we're dealing with we're being dealing with people who have this
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:45.200]  dream that they know better what's good for us than we do they create the
[02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:49.800]  crisis offer their world government solution but then literally give the
[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:53.440]  private fellow reserve member banks more money to make us even more dependent
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:56.920]  and they call that the solution and then all it does is kind of give somebody
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:01.440]  morphine when they have a compound fracture to make them feel better
[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:06.120]  exactly and they're gonna carry that through to the end because they have to
[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:12.040]  there's no way back for them because if we win and I know we will then they're
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:14.760]  gonna lose everything they have particularly their power and their
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:19.240]  wealth and that is going to happen and that's why they monitor your show all
[02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:23.320]  the time so they can hear me say that on every show because we're gonna come and
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:28.400]  get you now I just want to stop the tyranny and start going after the real
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:32.400]  high-powered criminals instead of having them judicial system turned loose on
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:36.720]  little people for no reason let's talk to Rob and chili Rob thanks for holding
[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:41.520]  her on the air with Bob Chapman hey it's great to talk to you guys it looks
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:48.840]  like fourth time was the charm this week I was on hold Monday Tuesday and
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:56.000]  Wednesday just dying to ask this question to your guest and then the show
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:00.520]  ended so I didn't get that here you are Rob you're on the air now exactly okay
[02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:06.680]  great excellent okay so this is a question I'm posing to you and Bob of
[02:37:06.680 --> 02:37:15.360]  course Bob Chapman hello great to listen to you every week okay do you are you a
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:24.400]  neocreationist also known as creation 2.0 now with dinosaurs or do you believe
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:33.840]  in both the existence of abiotic carbon and its abundance I understand the
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:38.960]  second part of the question I the clear evidence is there's there is coal and
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:43.840]  oil that is made up of broken down dead animals and they find coal that is just
[02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:48.440]  full of ferns you can see the imprints of them but then there's also the abiotic
[02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:52.920]  oil and more and more top scientists are having to admit that this oil is
[02:37:52.920 --> 02:37:56.520]  replenishing itself I mean I don't think we know all the secrets of this
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:00.080]  universe and I don't think the scientists know or the preachers I just
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:04.560]  believe in God and I believe in goodness and and I think the system
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:09.960]  creates false debates but we know the way evolution is proposed has been proven
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:14.600]  wrong you just don't have a you know fish over you know overnight turn into a
[02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:20.040]  land animal or vice versa and they know now in the development of I mean
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:24.560]  scientists just a decade ago or more like 20 years ago we're saying oh the
[02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:28.560]  earth gets hit every 15 20 30 million years by a huge asteroid now they say
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:31.480]  it's every hundred thousand because they're able to watch other planets and
[02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:35.440]  see what's happened here on this planet so and and so the scientists don't know
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:40.240]  everything preachers interpret the Bible the way they want I interesting
[02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:46.280]  question even waiting to ask myself and Bob Bob did you get the question I did
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:51.520]  and you answered it perfectly and I don't know any more than what you have
[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:57.800]  said so I can't add anything to it but I have a question and this doesn't often
[02:38:57.800 --> 02:39:02.760]  happen on this program what are the effects of the earthquake and chilly
[02:39:02.760 --> 02:39:08.600]  and what is the revival what's happening there yeah what's the aftermath six
[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:12.680]  months later what's the aftermath that's a good question Rob that is a
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:19.520]  difficult question for me actually because I call myself Rob and she lay
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:23.360]  because that's where I was the first time I got through to you and the second
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:26.720]  time all right I appreciate your call it was it was good to have you on with us
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:30.520]  we've got a lot of callers from chilly though they can call in and give us
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:35.040]  their take on things let's talk to Alyssa in Texas you're on the air with Bob
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:42.360]  Chapman I've been listening to your show for quite a few while my husband's been
[02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:47.880]  a fan for at least five years we've looked at you know facefully to your
[02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:54.800]  show and we noticed that you do quite a few cases on CPS well I we emailed you
[02:39:54.800 --> 02:40:04.360]  earlier on this week telling your story but basically what happened was we took
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:07.880]  those stories with the grain of salt when we heard him but it's a completely
[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:13.600]  different story when it happens to you basically what happened is we have a
[02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:19.600]  seven month old daughter she's eight months old now and she got an injury and
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:23.720]  we took her to the hot I took to the hospital because my husband's in the
[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:28.200]  Marine Corps took her to the hospital CPS balls and they took her out of my
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:34.840]  hands because my explanation was I don't know what happened and that happens a
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:38.200]  lot with babies and with children that they're hurt and you're like you're
[02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:41.360]  not sure how it happened and having have you gotten your daughter back from the
[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:46.120]  clutches of the globalist no they took they took her away from us and put her
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:52.560]  in foster care and they did you have blonde hair yes well and you got blue
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:57.840]  eyes green oh that's even worse and if you got dark hair and black hair and
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:02.320]  green eyes that's one of their favorite that's cuz that's rare ma'am it's come
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:06.360]  out in our news it's admitted they have bounties they're looking for children
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:11.240]  and people at the hospital get cuts of the money and so you bring your child
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:14.320]  in you know she's having trouble breathing or you know her arms hurt I
[02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:17.920]  don't know and they just snatch them and then you go to the lawyers and they
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:24.600]  just sell you down the river have they permanently terminated custody we can't
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:27.760]  afford an attorney right now so our basically our hands are tied we're
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:30.240]  fighting the state and we don't know what and they're gonna threaten you to
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:34.120]  sign forms and say we'll give your baby back just sign these admit you heard her
[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:39.000]  I mean if you told the monster let me guess it's about a five foot five chubby

[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:11.280]  which isn't a real court it's a family court so you need to talk to the experts
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:14.680]  but I mean actually that's why I don't like doing this show I'd like to be like
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:18.000]  everybody else thing nor this is happening but you can't hide from it you
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:21.360]  know I told you your wife is saying she thought it was a joke earlier I'm
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:24.840]  telling you it's not a joke I've opened the door to hospital when woman called
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:29.800]  us to help her then our only crime was she was poor with her husband and they
[02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:33.280]  were waiting for an apartment they were staying in a hotel for a week and the
[02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:38.840]  hotel call point is newborn baby I open the door and I get there and the police
[02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:43.560]  officer was choking her saying sign it like in a movie open the door and the
[02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:46.840]  cops all come they got their hands on their guns they all look the same it's
[02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:51.000]  like a special guild they have and the CPS workers were like demonic enjoying
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:56.800]  the torture and Mike Hanson caught some of it on tape and me and Mike came
[02:44:56.800 --> 02:44:59.760]  outside started crying with the evil we'd seen because they were just like
[02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:05.800]  nesting demons on the woman and and and they didn't even file her right name it
[02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:09.480]  was a file they used a filing to take the kid from a woman two years before
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:14.280]  another woman whose kid they taken and I got on TV and showed the files I mean
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:18.400]  they don't even fill forms out it's just they walk into the judge who's always
[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:22.000]  sitting up there with their crew cut haircut if it's a woman or if it's a
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:27.080]  man all effeminate and they just go haha I mean were you there at the demonic
[02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:33.640]  court hearing I was at the first court hearing and the it wasn't so much the
[02:45:33.640 --> 02:45:38.480]  judge and the sheriff's cuz since it's a small town they all know a lot of people
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:42.520]  and they're all real nice but the but the child protective services they're
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:46.720]  all out of Waco and and I can you know but you should have you should have said
[02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:50.560]  judge we don't we don't know why the baby got hurt and that's all we were
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:55.760]  honest about that we're good family give us our child back we did and there was
[02:45:55.760 --> 02:46:01.000]  nothing that we could do based on the report that was filed it painted us up
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:08.880]  to be a terrible and awful what happened to the baby absolutely and it was all
[02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:12.280]  right yeah the report had lots of inconsistencies now of course they lie
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:15.360]  but I mean my point is what why did you originally take the baby to the hospital
[02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:20.520]  and we're going back to Bob why'd you originally go we went back we
[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:25.000]  fracture on her femur she got she got her leg caught underneath the couch and
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:29.400]  rolled over and it she got a hairline fracture I took her to the hospital let
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:34.640]  me stop you let me stop you this is your defense doctors when a baby is born do
[02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:38.680]  a hip test to see if the hip is developed and they routinely cause
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:43.680]  fractures just doing the medical exam and so you go in you get a doctor as a
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:48.440]  special witness of the family doctor pediatrician whatever to explain that
[02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:53.240]  babies routinely do this rolling around they routinely and so how did you know
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:58.720]  the baby was hurt because he was crying I mean of course okay so you just say the
[02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:01.320]  baby was rolling around the floor and twisted something of course I took her
[02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:05.560]  to the doctor and and and and and then you get up there you go to the media and
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:09.840]  you get in your uniform and you start standing outside you make a big issue in
[02:47:09.840 --> 02:47:13.680]  your town and you go to that newspapers the local papers and you talk to them
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:18.880]  and you tell them defend us and you go absolutely ape but but I just can't
[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:23.600]  even hear these stories anymore when I saw that cop grabbing that woman around
[02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:28.480]  the neck and I couldn't even believe it I mean this this country so hell hell
[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:33.840]  bent on destruction and I can't remember all the names the groups we've had
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:39.040]  off there's a lot of great groups with lawyers that for free will help you but
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:44.120]  it's you know groups that fight CPS and just just stay in contact with the
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:48.040]  sentence another email to show tips and info wars calm and the show is almost
[02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:51.480]  this hour is almost over and I got a bunch of calls Bob having just hearing
[02:47:51.480 --> 02:47:53.960]  that it makes you want to leave the United States but they're doing this
[02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:59.720]  worldwide you're absolutely right they've got groups in Belgium that have been
[02:47:59.720 --> 02:48:05.160]  doing it for years and they export children to the far east and and it's
[02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:12.360]  not only children when I was living in Geneva in the late 50s I knew a young
[02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:18.200]  girl my age who's dad was head of the police department and I used to talk
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:23.680]  to him and he would tell me our biggest crime here is the spiriting of young
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:29.120]  people out of the country to the Middle East and these people come from
[02:48:29.120 --> 02:48:33.000]  everywhere and they just boom they just disappear and that's the end of it and
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:37.120]  it's children it's adults as well well it's admitted dying core and others have
[02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:43.080]  been in Halliburton caught running whole airfields and now they are just given
[02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:46.160]  they're selling people's children to these adoption rackets and the and the
[02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:49.720]  parents don't know they're getting kidnapped kids it's just pure evil I
[02:48:49.720 --> 02:48:54.320]  just you know that's not a good way to end the shower here in her call I Bob I
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:57.080]  mean people say well you shouldn't be depressed you know we're making big
[02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:03.240]  headway I I'm just sick of knowing how real the crime is and people don't know
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:06.920]  how dangerous this country is we had a woman last hour the health department
[02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:10.560]  wrote her a survey saying do you always put your kids in safety belts do you give
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:14.680]  them vaccines do you have any mental problems and if you and if you're
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:17.360]  honest and well one time we had them in the back of the pickup truck out in the
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:21.080]  out in the field you know driving to a creek they take your kids they don't tell
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:25.240]  you this is a predatory got they take over a million two hundred thousand kids
[02:49:25.240 --> 02:49:30.120]  a year in this country Bob that's right and they're gonna keep on doing it unless
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:36.560]  we stop them and I'm glad that the young lady and young man called in and Alex
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:42.960]  you send me their email address and I'll get Drew Reigns on this as well the
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:49.120]  marine disquisition and I think we'll climb all over them guys we make sure
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:51.920]  when they send us an email we can't know we get thousands we got to find their
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:54.680]  email they've sent us and try to get them some help and then hundreds more
[02:49:54.680 --> 02:49:58.800]  people call us and I investigate and it's always worse and we have a lady
[02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:04.760]  works here whose great little daughter is so sweet and I talked to her and she
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:09.240]  had a bruise on the side of her leg at PE and they took her in they strip searched
[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:14.160]  her and they said your mommy did this and she said no and they were trying to
[02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:17.560]  take her and then I told her I said don't go home they're gonna be waiting
[02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:21.160]  for you at your house when I heard this happen I said go get her out of school
[02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:25.000]  right now they're gonna come take your kid and then they tried and then she
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.840]  went to go ahead and meet with a CPS person when she pulled in the parking
[02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:31.680]  lot there were cops hiding in the alley and I said get out of there I was on
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:33.800]  the cell phone with her I said get out of there and turn out they were gonna
[02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:36.960]  grab her and she never would have got her little daughter back but we got
[02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:41.560]  attention on it but I can't do this for everybody my my audience can't always do
[02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:45.400]  it or then every time I call for people to aid us then they'll stop helping us
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:48.920]  when we do ask for the help as we do it constantly I can't stop these criminals
[02:50:48.920 --> 02:50:53.960]  I can't stop the pedophile rings the CPS workers most of them are pedophiles I
[02:50:53.960 --> 02:51:00.240]  mean I'm sorry their bags of pus their child rape and trash will be right back
[02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:05.920]  the question is where should the American people draw their line in the
[02:51:05.920 --> 02:51:11.400]  sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a
[02:51:11.400 --> 02:51:15.880]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two
[02:51:15.880 --> 02:51:18.920]  wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[02:51:18.920 --> 02:51:24.000]  they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to

[02:54:13.160 --> 02:54:17.600]  hospital with CPS trying to take them but if you're a young baby those are
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:21.280]  perfect to adopt because they won't remember and your mother and father are
[02:54:21.280 --> 02:54:26.160]  white that's the main groups they hunt if you're white trash or your parents are
[02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:30.680]  ugly or you're not a baby people are wanting you can be burning your kids
[02:54:30.680 --> 02:54:34.240]  with cigarettes and the and they use those stories in the media they won't
[02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:39.680]  take their kids but if you got a blonde-haired blue-eyed baby or or raven
[02:54:39.680 --> 02:54:43.160]  hair green eyes that's their favorite because it's really rare and the rich
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:47.320]  families will pay big money and the Arab sheiks will pay big money it's gone
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:52.240]  it's gone it's over and then you'll read about the kids 20 years later in
[02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:55.480]  midnight visits to the White House as sex slaves in the Washington Times that's
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:55:00.400]  mainstream news I mean they just don't care it's they harvest us Bob Chapman it
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:07.520]  just it takes me to a level above rage well the only thing you can do when you
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:11.560]  get to that level is be as effective as you can because you understand the
[02:55:11.560 --> 02:55:16.640]  problem and just like I said earlier when the gentleman and his wife were on
[02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:22.960]  get me the email their email address and I'll see what I can do and they can
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:26.120]  also go to the international forecaster comm and find the emails there for you
[02:55:26.120 --> 02:55:29.800]  and get directly to you that's right and we can put them on to the marine

[02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:40.400]  area they got connections that could do something yeah and don't just say oh
[02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:44.000]  that's their problem I'm going to play golf or I'm going to be a deacon at the
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:47.800]  church get in there and start defending people this woman's gonna have every
[02:55:47.800 --> 02:55:54.080]  child she ever has taken now they don't get this one back well you got to try
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:58.280]  absolutely well no they can get them back if they knew the proper procedures

[02:56:02.520 --> 02:56:05.960]  now I'll be thinking about is this and trying to help these people and when I

[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:33.440]  it when it does thanks to your efforts and then people will click on that link

[02:57:12.960 --> 02:57:17.720]  those in Bob when I get you on next Friday I want to talk about solutions
[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:22.000]  ideas you got for people to individually try to lessen the blow of this
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:25.360]  ongoing deepening depression but briefly in the last minute and a half of this
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:29.880]  hour what are some solutions people can do quickly to protect themselves you
[02:57:29.880 --> 02:57:33.560]  got to go down to the right of to rudimentary level and that is if you
[02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:38.280]  can't afford anything more get canned goods of things you normally eat and get
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:43.040]  extra ones and rotate them so you've got extra food around for when you might
[02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:49.160]  lose your job or something drastic happens have a water filter if you can
[02:57:49.160 --> 02:57:53.680]  afford to purchase one if you have a weapon that's a good thing because you
[02:57:53.680 --> 02:57:57.840]  can defend your family and if you get money beyond that you buy gold and
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:01.920]  silver coins if you have more money than that and you want some leverage you
[02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:07.800]  buy stocks and that's that's it there is nothing else and you get the word out
[02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:11.280]  because the best insurance for freedom is being active and saying no to tyranny
[02:58:11.280 --> 02:58:15.720]  the globalists are in deep trouble now we have got to stand up against these
[02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:19.400]  people and I was so shook up by that last call that I was saying Ron Paul hoax
