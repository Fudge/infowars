[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:11.000 --> 00:26.000]  Alex Jones, the four-way conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[00:26.000 --> 00:35.000]  Alex Jones, scum, Russian scum.
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  Until war comes to mind.
[00:41.000 --> 00:51.000]  Reputation's amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  It's Sunday, the 18th of March, 2018. I'm your host, Alex Jones. We'll be live here for the next two hours.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  Then we're back with a weekday transmission. David Knight, 8 a.m., myself at 11 a.m.
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  And of course, 3 o'clock, Owen Schroyer, Roger Stone, and others, the War Room.
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  Certainly not a boring time to be alive, and there's never a slow news day, as some people would like to say.
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  Sometimes mainstream media doesn't have its talking points out, and they take a vacation,
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  but we never sleep here when it comes to defending, not just this Republic, but the future of humanity
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  and the defense of free will and our own chance to govern our own destiny.
[01:29.000 --> 01:36.000]  There's so much I want to get to here. The Justice Department is moving with indictments against McCabe, Comey,
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  and Hillary Clinton, finally, along with others in their crime network.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  I have that from sources very high up, and the sources have been telling me this for a month.
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  I'm seeing people, very prominent former deputy directors and others, saying exactly what I've been told.
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.000]  So I've been kind of sitting on this because folks know I'm not a wishful thinker.
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.000]  I don't tell you something's going away until it's going that way.
[01:58.000 --> 02:04.000]  Mines might get changed. The Democrats might roll over and back off and let us make the country great again.
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  And then maybe there could be some daytime, because I don't want to have the big train wreck that's going to come from this,
[02:10.000 --> 02:17.000]  but it's better than going into the long night of tyranny and letting the Clinton crime combo continue to stay in power
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  and sell us out of the communist, Chinese, and others.
[02:21.000 --> 02:29.000]  And Trump tried to give them a chance to go quietly, you know, out to pasture, not into the dark night,
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  but just take their stolen loot and go.
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  They put Napoleon on Alba than another island, not because they didn't hate the guy,
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  but because he had a lot of networks, a lot of people, and they wanted him to make a deal and give up for everybody's greater good.
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  Well, he snuck back a few years later, as everybody knows, and then had to be finally completely locked up,
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  not just giving his own island and, you know, a few hundred of his own troops,
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  because with that little network, he launched attacks again.
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  And it's the same thing here. They're not going to give up. They're not going to go away. They're crazy.
[03:01.000 --> 03:08.000]  So huge news on that front. Also, Vladimir Putin re-elected. There were globalists trying to hack in and block that.
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  A lot of craziness there. That's all coming up.
[03:10.000 --> 03:16.000]  And I'm going to spend some time on this. You know, I normally check Drudge Report five, six, ten times a day.
[03:16.000 --> 03:23.000]  I didn't today. I was watching my wife on her iPad, and I saw some of the stuff she was looking at,
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  so I kind of got it away from her when she started cooking lunch.
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.000]  I'm just explaining how my surfing habits, and I went down the rabbit hole to London Guardian.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  I didn't know that Drudge had it as well as his top story.
[03:35.000 --> 03:41.000]  The Cambridge Analytica files meet the whistleblower.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  I created CBET and psychological warfare tool.
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  Staff claim Analytica ignored ban on foreigners working elections.
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  Facebook suspends. Zuckerberg detests them out before Senate committee.
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.000]  Socials weaponized, data harvested, behaviors predicted, manipulated.
[03:58.000 --> 04:07.000]  This is like in 2018 saying, this young man invented the automobile in 2014.
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  He was the first ever to have an automobile.
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  You're like, automobiles have been around for hundreds of years.
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.000]  That's what social networks are. That's how they data mine. It's how they harvest.
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  They're 100% Democrat, globalist worldwide. They fund the Arab Spring.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  They fund all these uprisings. They fund the war in Ukraine, the war on Russia,
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  the war against Brexit.
[04:29.000 --> 04:36.000]  Oh, but one young guy who was in these companies, they're now putting him out there
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  knowing people aren't technical like, he invented this, he discovered it,
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  and they harvested millions of days.
[04:41.000 --> 04:50.000]  Yes, Steve Bannon with this guy developed basically a spit-wad shooter compared to a 5,000 megaton hydrogen bomb.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  Okay?
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.000]  In fact, pull me that clip at the top of the story and I'm coming out and saying the social networks are taking over
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  for the globalists, not the other way around.
[04:58.000 --> 05:27.000]  That's the article I need to clip.
[05:28.000 --> 05:40.000]  The anti-oxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[05:40.000 --> 05:48.000]  The stronger the anti-oxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[05:48.000 --> 06:02.000]  Boost, protect, and adapt with cell force from Infowars Life.
[06:02.000 --> 06:27.000]  We're breaking the conditioning.
[06:27.000 --> 06:44.000]  Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[06:46.000 --> 07:08.000]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work, operating in areas that we can't control.
[07:08.000 --> 07:15.000]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  He denied everything. He called it all fake news.
[07:17.000 --> 07:22.000]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.000]  If they killed Trump or removed Trump, it would cause a massive civil war in this country.
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.000]  This is a female high level.
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  We are at war with Russia.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange in WikiLeaks?
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  The White House and the President are citing Infowars.
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  They can shut us down. You're next.
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[07:49.000 --> 07:55.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[07:55.000 --> 08:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are two giant news stories that we're going to predominantly cover here on this live Sunday broadcast today.
[08:02.000 --> 08:09.000]  The 18th of March, 2018. Thank you so much for joining us.
[08:09.000 --> 08:17.000]  And there's a lot of other big tidbits like Vladimir Putin getting reelected with the landslide.
[08:17.000 --> 08:25.000]  But the first big story is the firing of McCabe before he got his pension, the hysteria in Washington,
[08:25.000 --> 08:31.000]  the open and shut case that he perjured himself and his wife got a half million dollars from Hillary,
[08:31.000 --> 08:39.000]  and that they used government money to pay for fusion GPS, and he sat over that cabal, that organization.
[08:39.000 --> 08:47.000]  Oh, and of course, the big one, protected Hillary, protected all her crimes with Eric Holder,
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000]  and of course, Ms. Lynch after that, Loretta Lynch.
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  So, Comey's been caught perjuring as well before Congress.
[08:56.000 --> 09:02.000]  It's open and shut, and that's just what we know. Imagine what the president knows.
[09:02.000 --> 09:14.000]  So, all of that said, that's going to be coming up today. In fact, I'm going to hit that first after I get some other important news out of the way in the next segment.
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.000]  And of course, then you've got to ask yourself, how big a response are we going to see from the MSM Globalist?
[09:21.000 --> 09:31.000]  What other tricks up their sleeves do they have? This is obviously a very dangerous, critical time for the American reboot that we're all in the middle of right now.
[09:31.000 --> 09:43.000]  Now, that said, though, I want to tackle this first because I'm not an IT expert when it comes to zeros and ones and programming.
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  I mean, I took programming some in middle school and high school and did a little bit of it here and there.
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.000]  And I try to focus on a computer and engineering or electricity or anything.
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  I mean, I can actually get pretty good at it, but it's not my forte. It's not the direction I've gone in.
[09:57.000 --> 10:07.000]  What I do is I study what the experts say in the big swath of where a technology is going, what it's based on and how it operates.
[10:07.000 --> 10:17.000]  Now, two years ago, Google came out and they said that when they were founded in the late 1990s with CIA and NSA funding and money,
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.000]  that the government officials that were there from NQ, Tal, and DARPA said, we already have a bunch of search engines in system.
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.000]  What is this? They said, sir, and Wired Magazine wrote about this two years ago.
[10:27.000 --> 10:34.000]  We'd first course covered it over a decade ago. We're building an over-the-horizon future predicting system.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  But once you can predict it, you can also manipulate people with stimulus to control them.
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000]  And we want billions of people plugged into a supercomputer so it can machine learn.
[10:43.000 --> 10:51.000]  And then we're going to put everybody in their own groups and manipulate and control them basically through peer pressure and bullying.
[10:51.000 --> 10:58.000]  Now, remember last year, Sean Parker came out. The former head of Facebook and others, a bunch of executives there went public.
[10:58.000 --> 11:04.000]  Documents got released in Australia where they said we exploit liberals mainly.
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  We exploit people that are depressed. We exploit young people.
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.000]  And we try to keep them desperate and alone.
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  And we have fake bots that manipulate them that look like real people but that they're avatars.
[11:14.000 --> 11:25.000]  And then we datamined billions of people a day to then manipulate through peer pressure and control them.
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  Facebook told advertisers to identify teens feeling insecure and worthless.
[11:29.000 --> 11:37.000]  So now that they make you depressed, now they're going to offer psychology tests and things and then recommend drugs you should be put on.
[11:37.000 --> 11:45.000]  So it's kind of a whole 360 spectrum there of even making money off of how they make you depressed and basically doom your life.
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  And there's thousands of articles of stimulus.
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.000]  So imagine I have that curse. I have that thing called a memory.
[11:53.000 --> 12:06.000]  And so when I got up this morning and my wife was reading London Guardian on her iPad, I went and spent, like I do, two and a half hours reading everything about it from every angle.
[12:06.000 --> 12:17.000]  And it is just a ridiculous PR stunt with this new superhero character they're launching that has pink hair so you know you've got to listen to him.
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  And he's gay so you can't question him just at that point.
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  Who cares if you're gay dude? Give me a break.
[12:23.000 --> 12:29.000]  Other people walk up and say, I'm heterosexual, dun dun dun or I'm whatever man, I don't care.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  It's not that I dislike you because you're gay, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care.
[12:35.000 --> 12:43.000]  So Stephen Hawking dies as their PR guy and then one week later we've got the new guy and it's like Jesus arrived.
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  He's the greatest genius the world ever saw.
[12:46.000 --> 12:56.000]  He has a way to track people on social networks and know what group they're in and then bully them with bots to make them politically do what he wants.
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.000]  It says he invented it in 2014. Dun dun dun.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  Oh I mean this is he.
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  Folks he also invented in 2014 fire.
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  He invented the wheel.
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  In fact he, Jesus was gay and he was married to him now being sarcastic.
[13:17.000 --> 13:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, social networks were theorized at MIT in the 70s.
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  Steve Pachinix talked about it.
[13:28.000 --> 13:37.000]  My dad at UT wrote seminal papers on it that were then picked up and basically went into the classification bin.
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  My dad told me about social networks when I was five years old and the whole plan.
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  So no, but no, no, no, no, I didn't tell you all about this 20 years ago.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  This hasn't been going on publicly for about 15.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  This man invented it.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  Now that's how they do it, you see.
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.000]  They go, oh my God, the Russian collusion, it's incredible.
[13:59.000 --> 14:10.000]  Stephen Bannon went with submersor money and they went in and they wanted somebody to go harvest conservatives and libertarians
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  from the database to activate them politically and motivate them.
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  And when I saw the numbers of five million, ladies and gentlemen,
[14:18.000 --> 14:25.000]  Info Wars got hundreds of millions of free thinkers worldwide mobilized to just promote free market and capitalism.
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.000]  We weren't paid by the mercers.
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  Five million is a joke.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  But again, they know the general public doesn't know this.
[14:34.000 --> 14:40.000]  So they have this huge to do about, you know, the cool gay guy with pink hair and the camo jacket who didn't know what he was doing.
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  And he's really sorry.
[14:41.000 --> 14:42.000]  He's God.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  He gave us Promethean fire.
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000]  He knew everything.
[14:45.000 --> 14:52.000]  And there's one email where they pitched a Russian bot company to help do their operation.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  And so that's the proof of Russian collusion, even though it never happened.
[14:55.000 --> 15:02.000]  And it says, I made Stephen Bannon's psychological warfare tool meet the data war whistleblower.
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  Oh, like info war.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  Oh, did you invent info war too, young man?
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  Did your pink hair invented?
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  And you read this crap.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  I mean, it's like a 20 page article or more.
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.000]  And then I read a bunch of others and it's just a giant hoax.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  It's a total hoax.
[15:16.000 --> 15:23.000]  Bannon never covered up the fact that he went and tried to data mine to create a database to expand Breitbart and all those other stuff.
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  Because as a Democrat globalist, I guess he thought he could capitalize off that or whatever.
[15:27.000 --> 15:35.000]  But there's probably 20 companies in Austin bigger than Cambridge Analytics doing the same thing for the Democrats.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  They're the ones that dominated all.
[15:37.000 --> 15:43.000]  But if conservatives and libertarians even try to toy with it, they go, oh my God, you're manipulating everyone.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  It's Zuckerberg calling his users dumb efforts.
[15:45.000 --> 15:51.000]  They admit the whole thing is a giant manipulation and data mining and putting people in pens and bullying them.
[15:51.000 --> 15:58.000]  But oh, this guy with pink hair invented it and oh, the Republicans are using it, bots are illegal when Republicans have them.
[15:58.000 --> 16:04.000]  After being sold out for months, our best selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  I thought it would be a six month supply for listeners.
[16:09.000 --> 16:14.000]  And since then, people are beating down our doors wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  Research across the board is clear.
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.000]  In fact, it's certified.
[16:17.000 --> 16:22.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[16:22.000 --> 16:29.000]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[16:29.000 --> 16:32.000]  Super Blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[16:36.000 --> 16:43.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[16:43.000 --> 16:50.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include silo toll, peppermint oil, iodide, nano silver and more.
[16:50.000 --> 16:59.000]  Learn more about Info Wars Life Super Blue toothpaste at infowarslife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.000]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.000]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[17:06.000 --> 17:13.000]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and awards shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[17:13.000 --> 17:20.000]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance, all to make them march, make them protest,
[17:20.000 --> 17:31.000]  make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding.
[17:31.000 --> 17:37.000]  Until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.000]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[17:41.000 --> 17:52.000]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[17:52.000 --> 17:59.000]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.000]  Perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts and entire meals.
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about.
[18:30.000 --> 18:38.000]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[18:38.000 --> 18:48.000]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[18:48.000 --> 18:55.000]  That's what I call the miracle of food preservation. Harvest right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.000]  So what are you waiting for? Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[18:59.000 --> 19:06.000]  The reason InfoWarsLine has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family.

[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[19:26.000 --> 19:34.000]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[19:34.000 --> 19:41.000]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good. And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.000]  So obviously the super female is amazing. I love it.
[19:44.000 --> 19:54.000]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2.
[19:54.000 --> 20:22.000]  It's got a five star rating. It's a win-win InfoWarsLive.com.
[20:22.000 --> 20:30.000]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host. We're going to get into the imminent indictments of McCabe, Comey, Hillary, you name it.
[20:30.000 --> 20:35.000]  The word is, they've got the evidence. They're going forward. Trump delivers on every front. He always does what he says he'll do.
[20:35.000 --> 20:41.000]  And how are they going to respond? They are so panicked. They're openly threatening the president. Wait till we get to that in the next segment.
[20:41.000 --> 20:46.000]  But since I mentioned this, let me try to quantify this because it's a big deal.
[20:46.000 --> 20:57.000]  The world is learning about how social networks have been weaponized from the beginning to make you depressed, to control you, to make you a globalist, to make you a leftist,
[20:57.000 --> 21:10.000]  to bully people with bots that sound like they're regular folks ridiculing you when you Twitter or Facebook something right of Mao Zedong or Vi Lenin.
[21:10.000 --> 21:32.000]  And so now it's well known, it's always been in the news, that Bannon, for Breitbart, wanting a database of conservatives, went in 2015-16 and paid different companies to go into the profiles of Facebook
[21:32.000 --> 21:46.000]  and to create a database and a relationship for political mailers. Conservatives hadn't even done that. Everything's leftist, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube.
[21:46.000 --> 21:57.000]  They're the ones that admit 99% of it's leftist, globalist, Sean Parker's gone public, all of it. They try to keep you depressed. They try to keep you under their control.
[21:57.000 --> 22:02.000]  And then you read this big article, The Cambridge Analytica Files.
[22:02.000 --> 22:08.000]  I made Stephen Bannon the psychological warfare tool meet the data war whistleblower.
[22:08.000 --> 22:16.000]  And then when you read the article, what they're saying is standard data mining, public source, totally legal.
[22:16.000 --> 22:25.000]  Once they got the codes to get into the private Facebooks and public ones, they would then have bots strike up relationships.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  That's what the Democrats and the globalist and the modern internet is.
[22:30.000 --> 22:38.000]  So Bannon goes and does a primitive attempt to get into it and do what they were doing a decade before.
[22:38.000 --> 22:45.000]  And now they write huge articles like, like he discovered free energy.
[22:45.000 --> 22:56.000]  It's like saying you discovered radio in 2018 when it was invented by Marconi in what, 1889 or something? Look up when Marconi discovered radio, please.
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  Then publishes. 5 is going from memory. It was 18 something.
[23:00.000 --> 23:05.000]  So I'm reading this and it's like, this guy's got pink hair.
[23:05.000 --> 23:13.000]  He discovered radio in 2018 and it's a total cutout.
[23:13.000 --> 23:19.000]  It's like everything else. Yeah, he worked at the company. Yeah, Bannon went and did it.
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  Yeah, there were millions of dollars that Russian bots involved.
[23:23.000 --> 23:30.000]  80% of them were anti-Trump, including rallies that Michael Moore attended against Trump that was funded by the Russian bot company.
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.000]  Because you get around campaign finance laws by going overseas and who's famous for that?
[23:35.000 --> 23:45.000]  The Clintons, the Clinton Foundation, billions, 1888. When did I say?
[23:45.000 --> 23:51.000]  My memory, it's just incredible. If I just don't question my memory, it's almost always right.
[23:51.000 --> 23:54.000]  But then there was a debate about it and three other guys kind of did it at the same time.
[23:54.000 --> 24:02.000]  I think it was published and agreed that he was, I think it was 1889 that he was recognized as inventing it.
[24:02.000 --> 24:07.000]  I believe the first transmissions were in 1888. Anyway, side issue. Hadn't looked at that in 30 years.
[24:07.000 --> 24:11.000]  I'm not bragging. I'm just saying, folks, I don't make this crap up. People see me up here saying all this stuff.
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.000]  They think there's no way this guy actually knows all this stuff. I do and more, believe me.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  And it's not bragging. I'm just letting you know.
[24:18.000 --> 24:24.000]  So, no, no, no. He didn't invent radio. This guy with pink hair did. I don't care that he's got pink hair.
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.000]  Hell, there are more people with pink hair in America now or purple hair than there are with just a regular color.
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  Mine's all falling out in gray. I don't give a damn.
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.000]  He's got pink hair, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.000]  And I read this crap. I mean, I spent hours on this today and I couldn't believe it.
[24:41.000 --> 24:47.000]  It's all bad and inventive system with this pink hair guy to bully people with fake bots.
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.000]  So you think you're really conservative and have friends and then it gives you confidence.
[24:51.000 --> 24:55.000]  And then you go out and you do things and then, oh, yes.
[24:55.000 --> 25:02.000]  Oh, Steve Bannon with this guy in 2000, this guy in 2014, Bannon a year and a half later.
[25:02.000 --> 25:09.000]  They invented organizing people on social networks and data mining for political purposes.
[25:09.000 --> 25:16.000]  Really? Because a couple of years before that, they funded the whole Arab Spring to overthrow a bunch of countries
[25:16.000 --> 25:21.000]  and Google, Facebook and Twitter admittedly haunched it.
[25:21.000 --> 25:27.000]  But see, that's all buried in the back of the newspaper. See how that works?
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  It's all just, man, that was kids incredible.
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.000]  Yeah, did you hear? He invented steam engines in 2018. Yeah, yeah.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  And he, listen, he invented fire and shoes.
[25:38.000 --> 25:45.000]  And let me tell you about this guy. What's his name? Christopher Weil. He invented toilet paper.
[25:45.000 --> 25:50.000]  That's right. My God, he's got a nose ring, pink hair.
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  Oh, he's powerful. I don't know what to do right now. I'm kind of threatened right now about it.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  I don't like that big.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  And then everyone just, oh my gosh, what are we going to do?
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  They got this power. The Republicans are dominating the Internet.
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  They're censoring and they've got mind control weapons.
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.000]  All they did was data mine 5 million people to create a new mailing list to get them politically involved
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.000]  and try to get donations out of them.
[26:15.000 --> 26:22.000]  The Democrats would fix the search results daily with Hillary Clinton in between phone calls with Google.
[26:22.000 --> 26:29.000]  She was getting the questions for the debate, planting questions for Trump and then lying about it all the same day.
[26:29.000 --> 26:32.000]  Everything rigged, everything tilted.
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.000]  And then they're like, how do we keep these Republicans from being able to use bots?
[26:37.000 --> 26:44.000]  Because their worldview is so much more popular and people want nationalism and God, we're selling tyranny versus capitalism.
[26:44.000 --> 26:50.000]  How do we do that? Just say it's Russian, have a big genius come out with pink hair and talk about how they invented it.
[26:50.000 --> 26:55.000]  Oh, that's how Trump won. He had all these fancy things to steal it.
[26:55.000 --> 27:01.000]  But oh, Facebook, Google, Twitter, CNN, NBC News, NBC, all of the whole Hollywood Combine,
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  foreign governments, the EU, the Pope, the Communist Chinese all piling on.
[27:06.000 --> 27:12.000]  But Trump still won. How do we make it look like we're not hated and there hadn't been a total political realignment
[27:12.000 --> 27:18.000]  and the whole world's turning against us? What do we do?
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  Just like Comey 2012. Oh, there's an African in Central Africa with all these slaves and he's evil.
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.000]  And look, there's a trendy university student fighting it and let's raise a million dollars.
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.000]  Comey's on the CIA payroll been protected the whole time. He's a ghost profile there.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  So they have an excuse to invade wherever they want.
[27:33.000 --> 27:39.000]  And I already knew that before out of the people that sit down and have dinner with him and delivering lost rockets.
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  Now, that's what this comes down to.
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  And that's why I spent so much time on this is because I love Drudge.
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.000]  I know it's a big breaking story. You guys pop Drudge back up there for me.
[27:52.000 --> 27:58.000]  But, you know, it's all the big story up there. The Cambridge Analytica files gone.
[27:58.000 --> 28:04.000]  They invented fire. Oh, what is it? Oh, God. Meet the whistleblower.
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.000]  He's got pink hair. He's powerful. Oh, my God. I created Steve Bannon's psychological warfare tool.
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  Oh, yeah, you want lower taxes? Want your sovereignty back?
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  Want to stop being bashed by globalists and being pissed all over?
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  Yeah, the truth is called psychological warfare. The truth is called victory.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  That's why Trump's so important and has so much courage and it's so amazing because he's just not out to get you.
[28:26.000 --> 28:33.000]  So the whole Stephen Bannon thing, this whole deal about analytics and all this, it's a big story.
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.000]  I'm glad Drudge is covering it. My point is, is that it's hiding in plain view when you read this crap
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.000]  that Bannon was trying to go back to what was around 10 years before or more and trying to take her toy
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  and so making a foray into their whole fake bot Facebook world.
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.000]  They're saying no, no, no. Now they put an article out trying to introduce bots to the world
[28:53.000 --> 28:58.000]  as if libertarians and conservatives are the ones that invented it for social control.
[28:58.000 --> 29:05.000]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and Biotru Selenium.

[30:59.000 --> 31:04.000]  InfowarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen blocks.
[31:04.000 --> 31:10.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including
[31:10.000 --> 31:16.000]  promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory functions.
[31:16.000 --> 31:21.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[31:21.000 --> 31:25.000]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[31:25.000 --> 31:31.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research,
[31:31.000 --> 31:36.000]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[31:36.000 --> 31:41.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase
[31:46.000 --> 31:51.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[31:51.000 --> 31:54.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[31:54.000 --> 31:59.000]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[32:08.000 --> 32:13.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico
[32:13.000 --> 32:16.000]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[32:16.000 --> 32:21.000]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[32:21.000 --> 32:28.000]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfowarsLife.com.

[32:42.000 --> 32:47.000]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[32:59.000 --> 33:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:30.000 --> 33:32.000]  How's the life reserve talking?
[33:32.000 --> 33:34.000]  It's the last round for me, willing to have a fight.
[33:34.000 --> 33:36.000]  One eight point at this point.
[33:36.000 --> 33:41.000]  And only the dumbest morons buying to your SJW Globalist, George Soros, dropping.
[33:41.000 --> 33:42.000]  Stabilized.
[33:42.000 --> 33:43.000]  Emergency reserve.
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  Hillary Clinton, it's the new world order of Michael Moore.
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  Go back to where you came from.
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  We're awake and you're not putting us back in the coma.
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  You got this, Jack?
[33:54.000 --> 33:55.000]  You're done.
[33:55.000 --> 33:56.000]  It's over.
[33:56.000 --> 33:57.000]  You're won.
[33:57.000 --> 34:00.000]  Get him back. Get him back.
[34:18.000 --> 34:25.000]  The Cambridge Analytica Files story, that is one of the biggest stories in the worldwide media right now,
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  is a giant, disgusting hoax.
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.000]  And I'm going to just say this and I'm done talking about it.
[34:31.000 --> 34:35.000]  It's already broken down earlier and laid it all out.
[34:35.000 --> 34:49.000]  They're saying that Stephen Bannon and some pink-haired guy developed the idea to data mine Facebook in 2014, 15, and 16 for political purposes.
[34:49.000 --> 34:55.000]  And that they have bots that then contact people and try to get them politically involved.
[34:55.000 --> 35:04.000]  That's what MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, all of that's been going on since the inception of the Internet as we know it.
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.000]  When you send somebody an auto response on email, that's a bot.
[35:09.000 --> 35:13.000]  And there's been no discussion of bots and manipulation politically.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  I've been talking about it forever.
[35:15.000 --> 35:18.000]  Except when they talk about Trump.
[35:18.000 --> 35:25.000]  In Congress, another investigation even admits less than one half of 1% of bot activity in 2016 was Russian.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  And 80% of that was leftist.
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  Russia is like America.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  It's overrun with leftists.
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  It's overrun with Soros operators.
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  The Russians are just aware of it.
[35:36.000 --> 35:42.000]  Internationalists have had enough of New York, DC, globalism.
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.000]  It was the left-winton, took over Russia in 1917, 100 years ago, plus.
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  Believe me, they've had a good gang raping.
[35:51.000 --> 35:55.000]  Bernie Sanders wanted to have his honeymoon there in the 70s and he did.
[35:55.000 --> 36:01.000]  He doesn't want to have it there now because it's not a place to have his way with Christians.
[36:01.000 --> 36:02.000]  That's what this is.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  The globalists want to mount your head on the wall.
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  They're evil.
[36:05.000 --> 36:06.000]  They want dominance.
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  They want control.
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  They're mentally ill.
[36:09.000 --> 36:15.000]  Just like Hitler, just like Mao, they have this nature to want to control it all.
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  They're like cancer.
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  Bernie Sanders describes Soviet Union honeymoon.
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  Oh, it's incredible.
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  There's too many choices, too much medicine, too much entertainment in America.
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  There's a quote.
[36:30.000 --> 36:35.000]  I like austerity, except I got five houses and a bunch of $100,000 cars.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  But I'm not in the ruling class.
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.000]  I'm Bernie Sanders.
[36:38.000 --> 36:39.000]  Sorry.
[36:39.000 --> 36:40.000]  The big news is coming.
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  I just had to hit the spot news because...
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  Did you hear Stephen Bannon discovered a thing called fire?
[36:47.000 --> 36:48.000]  Yeah, he did.
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.000]  He's really powerful.
[36:49.000 --> 36:50.000]  But a paint-cared guy actually did it.
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  He's the guy behind it all.
[36:53.000 --> 37:00.000]  Because the idea of libertarians or nationalists even getting involved in bots, not bots that
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  make people insecure, not bots that control them like Facebook documents show they do,
[37:04.000 --> 37:11.000]  not Zuckerberg famously saying, pull up New York Magazine, pull it up.
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  Oh, our readers, they trust us.
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  They're dumb efforts and laughing at everybody.
[37:18.000 --> 37:22.000]  And then the documents come out that it's their job to keep you depressed.
[37:22.000 --> 37:23.000]  We had the article earlier.
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  Let's throw it up on screen.
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  To keep you depressed, to control you.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  Yeah, embarrassing and damaging.
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  Zuckerberg's IMs confirmed by Zuckerberg, the New Yorker.
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  Scroll down.
[37:32.000 --> 37:37.000]  And he's talking about how much he hates his users.
[37:37.000 --> 37:43.000]  Zuck, so yeah, if you ever need info about anyone in Harvard, this is just them, their
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  own alumni, how to stalk folks.
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  Just ask.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses.
[37:49.000 --> 37:50.000]  Friend, what?
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  How'd you manage that one?
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  People just submitted it.
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  I don't know why they trust me, dumb ass.
[37:57.000 --> 38:02.000]  Now, I remember eight years ago, to be on Facebook, they'd send a thing and go, are these really
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.000]  your friends and it'd be high school photos from 30 years ago and it would do a face scan
[38:07.000 --> 38:08.000]  of you.
[38:08.000 --> 38:14.000]  It's getting everything, sharing it, bigger than any database, 3 billion users, totally
[38:14.000 --> 38:20.000]  in control, AI system.
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  But they think you're such troglodytes.
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.000]  Like when you're showing poor Pygmies and never seen technology, a lighter, it is God.
[38:30.000 --> 38:36.000]  You know, they've got flamethrowers over here, but they're like, look, Bannon made fire.
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  Looky, looky, look at the fire.
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  And everybody, woo, did you hear what Bannon did?
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  And I've noticed that's a tactic they use against me.
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  They'll go, Jones is a master manipulator.
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.000]  No one's better.
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  Here's how he lies to people and then they'll show made up stuff I didn't say.
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.000]  But it's just appeal to like, wow, look, he's really good at BS.
[38:56.000 --> 39:01.000]  But that's not what I've done.
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.000]  So my point is Zuckerberg and all these big things are broke into your info.
[39:06.000 --> 39:07.000]  They're tracking everything.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  The appliances are watching and listening.
[39:09.000 --> 39:10.000]  Everything's a total free for all.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  And then there's lawsuits coming, congressional hearings.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  Steve Bannon worked with a company.
[39:15.000 --> 39:21.000]  Why up to 5 million profiles of Facebook were accessed without Facebook users permission
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  and then people contacted them.
[39:23.000 --> 39:28.000]  It was like when they go bully the woman seeing it in Florida in Broward County.
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.000]  Why the Russian bots were, she was, no, I meet with the people here locally.
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.000]  We're libertarians and conservatives.
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  We like Trump.
[39:34.000 --> 39:35.000]  We talked to her.
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  She's a listener.
[39:36.000 --> 39:37.000]  She wouldn't want to come on.
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  She wouldn't want any more attention.
[39:38.000 --> 39:46.000]  And they bully her because they claim something connected to a Russian bot once posted a link
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  that was sent to her.
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  See how dumb they think you are?
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  So this bot thing's a big deal because they've got them.
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.000]  They use them.
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.000]  They're on record rigging everything.
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  And this is all going on.
[40:04.000 --> 40:09.000]  And now the London Guardian just told us he was invented by a guy with pink hair four
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  years ago.
[40:10.000 --> 40:16.000]  The article says that they, they were shutting AI robots off 20 something years ago because
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.000]  they'd know what they were doing.
[40:17.000 --> 40:23.000]  They had plans for information energy as it was called and then classified 35, 40 years
[40:23.000 --> 40:29.120]  ago, they had everything theoretically in the incredible mind of humans.
[40:29.120 --> 40:30.120]  And then now it's here.
[40:30.120 --> 40:34.640]  And then again, they tell you because they don't have a debate about how they're illegally
[40:34.640 --> 40:38.240]  using bots, how they're trying to make you depressed, how they're trying to rig everything,
[40:38.240 --> 40:41.080]  how they're rigging the debates, how they're rigging the town halls, how they're doing
[40:41.080 --> 40:42.080]  it all.
[40:42.080 --> 40:43.520]  No, no, no, no, no.
[40:43.520 --> 40:50.360]  If you try to harvest Facebook for 5 million names that you contact to politically be involved
[40:50.360 --> 40:55.840]  to be an American or to be sovereign, that's the dirtiest thing the world ever saw.
[40:55.840 --> 40:59.960]  And they talk about the guilt of the pink haired guy, you know, that he did this and
[40:59.960 --> 41:03.800]  didn't know what he'd done, but he was such a genius.
[41:03.800 --> 41:08.800]  And I wonder if this guy even knows he's being used because I went and looked at the company
[41:08.800 --> 41:15.080]  records and stuff, this is just some programmer for just some second rate standard, you know,
[41:15.080 --> 41:20.280]  contact program that goes and skims contacts, he can send somebody a damn email like this
[41:20.280 --> 41:24.600]  guy just discovered Valhalla and his ass at the same time.
[41:24.600 --> 41:31.920]  All right, our top story was the impending indictments of McCabe and Comey and Hillary
[41:31.920 --> 41:34.920]  and how bold that is of Trump and how are they going to strike back because that's
[41:34.920 --> 41:43.040]  huge news, we're going to get to that next and so much more.
[41:43.040 --> 41:45.680]  And then it turns out the executive of that company, according to Lee Sterni, and he's
[41:45.680 --> 41:55.040]  got the documents, turns out they sued me for claiming the CIA was involved with the
[41:55.040 --> 41:56.040]  growing government.
[41:56.040 --> 41:58.400]  So I wasn't really talking about him, but then it turns out the company reportedly works
[41:58.400 --> 42:02.600]  for Braggs that it runs up, carries out covert CIA operations.
[42:02.600 --> 42:05.480]  I mean, not that I ever thought anybody that works at the State Department might be involved
[42:05.480 --> 42:06.480]  with the CIA.
[42:06.480 --> 42:12.520]  Next year they're going to tell me that the sky's blue and penguins walk funny and bears
[42:12.520 --> 42:16.280]  take big old fat dumps in the woodlands.
[42:16.280 --> 42:18.360]  But we'll keep straight shooting you straight ahead.
[42:18.360 --> 42:21.760]  By the way, as you know, they're trying to shut us down.
[42:21.760 --> 42:24.840]  So when you spread the live links, you spread the articles, you're not bots, you're real
[42:24.840 --> 42:25.840]  people.
[42:25.840 --> 42:30.040]  When you, on your email or in person or whatever on local radio, spread the word about a local
[42:30.040 --> 42:33.600]  station, that's what gets the word out and funds our operation.
[42:33.600 --> 42:35.280]  And that's how we reach more people.
[42:35.280 --> 42:41.840]  So infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, info wars in 2018 really is the archetypal example
[42:41.840 --> 42:49.560]  of human brains online fighting against the globalist and seeing if we can overturn this
[42:49.560 --> 42:50.800]  anti-human system.
[42:50.800 --> 42:53.760]  This is the human versus AI operation.
[42:53.760 --> 42:55.760]  We'll be right back.
[42:55.760 --> 42:59.360]  Stay with us.
[42:59.360 --> 43:00.360]  I'm so excited.
[43:00.360 --> 43:05.800]  The new product at infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to
[43:05.800 --> 43:10.480]  the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[43:10.480 --> 43:15.920]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[43:15.920 --> 43:18.920]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[43:18.920 --> 43:25.240]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[43:25.240 --> 43:31.840]  it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae, and I came
[43:31.840 --> 43:36.560]  up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made
[43:36.560 --> 43:43.200]  right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[43:43.200 --> 43:47.640]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[43:47.640 --> 43:49.320]  hormones in your glands.
[43:49.320 --> 43:52.120]  It is amazing.
[43:52.120 --> 43:58.920]  Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com and your purchase fuzz the operation.
[43:58.920 --> 44:03.560]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest
[44:03.560 --> 44:10.320]  cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[44:10.320 --> 44:16.280]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, carnivore, for being able to break down meat
[44:16.280 --> 44:22.760]  other proteins better, and then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic
[44:22.760 --> 44:28.160]  culture of the very best strains in fluorolife advanced restoration.
[44:28.160 --> 44:33.720]  And we also have an everyday extremely affordable fluorolife everyday maintenance, but all of
[44:33.720 --> 44:42.080]  these are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely
[44:42.080 --> 44:43.600]  affordable price.
[44:43.600 --> 44:49.360]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[44:49.360 --> 44:54.400]  When you purchase it at infowarsstore.com, you know you are also financing the attack
[44:54.400 --> 44:58.400]  on the globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[44:58.400 --> 45:05.520]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still
[45:05.520 --> 45:08.520]  maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[45:08.520 --> 45:09.520]  That's right.
[45:09.520 --> 45:14.240]  It's time to build your own food storage with Harvest Wright's Freeze Dryers.
[45:14.240 --> 45:19.440]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology
[45:19.440 --> 45:24.840]  that's easy to use, and let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze-drying fruits, vegetables,
[45:24.840 --> 45:28.040]  meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[45:28.040 --> 45:29.800]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about.
[45:29.800 --> 45:34.800]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[45:34.800 --> 45:38.800]  you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[45:38.800 --> 45:44.640]  Harvest Wright Freeze Dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[45:44.640 --> 45:48.120]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[45:48.120 --> 45:51.560]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[45:51.560 --> 45:55.680]  Harvest Wright is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[45:55.680 --> 45:56.680]  So what are you waiting for?
[45:56.680 --> 45:59.680]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[45:59.680 --> 46:02.480]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[46:02.480 --> 46:08.800]  The MycoZX Plus, lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed to your contract
[46:08.800 --> 46:13.080]  with an even bigger, organic manufacturer and producer.
[46:13.080 --> 46:19.600]  Scalability, but now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off because
[46:19.600 --> 46:22.600]  there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient, MycoZX.
[46:22.600 --> 46:26.120]  Now it's the other side of the equation, everybody thinks about probiotics, now great
[46:26.120 --> 46:30.280]  they are for your gut because you have toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides,
[46:30.280 --> 46:37.040]  more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace, yeast mold creates slime walls
[46:37.040 --> 46:41.920]  and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes
[46:41.920 --> 46:42.920]  all sorts of syrups issues.
[46:42.920 --> 46:47.600]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy
[46:47.600 --> 46:49.600]  that slime wall.
[46:49.600 --> 46:51.760]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[46:51.760 --> 47:03.560]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus, now from the InfoWars store.
[47:03.560 --> 47:25.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:25.240 --> 47:31.720]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance,
[47:31.720 --> 47:33.720]  Alex Jones.
[47:33.720 --> 47:41.320]  All right, we're 47 minutes into this global broadcast and I have not gotten into our top
[47:41.320 --> 47:44.000]  story yet.
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.600]  You know, I'm not one to hype things as the audience knows, I don't sit there and say
[47:47.600 --> 47:53.920]  indictments of Hillary or imminent, indictments of McCabe or imminent until our sources have
[47:53.920 --> 47:58.160]  told us that indeed, that's where this is going and you've seen the evidence mount,
[47:58.160 --> 48:04.160]  the perjury to Congress, the fake dossiers, McCabe getting a half million from Hillary
[48:04.160 --> 48:14.360]  from her foundation, his wife, Comey, testifying on May 3rd, they never leaked anything and
[48:14.360 --> 48:19.240]  now we know he's the main leaker and then later on June 8th admitting he'd leaked going
[48:19.240 --> 48:27.040]  back over a year, repeatedly, I mean, that's all bombshell, but the big story is Trump's
[48:27.040 --> 48:32.760]  taking the gloves off and I've seen the real signs of them cracking with Joy Behar and
[48:32.760 --> 48:42.000]  Hillary's former campaign manager and Democrat Congressman Dick Durbin going, Trump's not
[48:42.000 --> 48:51.360]  racist, the same 30% of Democrats that voted to put Obama over the top are the ones that
[48:51.360 --> 48:54.600]  voted for Trump, which is true.
[48:54.600 --> 49:00.640]  And I've got a bunch of other examples, but I've watched everything and smarter Democrats
[49:00.640 --> 49:06.560]  who aren't even good people, but they're survivors, they see this as an extinction level of end.
[49:06.560 --> 49:11.240]  One side says go for broke, threaten everybody, shoo everybody, overthrow the country, call
[49:11.240 --> 49:17.040]  for the murder of the president and we've got clips of that, but the smart ones go, man,
[49:17.040 --> 49:20.200]  you've really revealed yourself.
[49:20.200 --> 49:24.080]  We should be acting like Trump to get our people in office like happen in Pennsylvania, there
[49:24.080 --> 49:26.440]  was also election fraud now proven.
[49:26.440 --> 49:27.440]  You need to stop.
[49:27.440 --> 49:35.000]  This is crazy, but Clinton and her crime network are still in control.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.440]  Thank God, but not thank God.
[49:37.440 --> 49:41.160]  I mean, at a Machiavellian level, I'm like, oh, thank God, there's still in control, but
[49:41.160 --> 49:45.440]  I don't like seeing evil done and bad, even if it hurts the overall bad system, it's
[49:45.440 --> 49:52.120]  still unseemly because if there's a runaway bulldozer going through houses, okay, it's
[49:52.120 --> 49:55.080]  going to run over the first house that has bad guys in it.
[49:55.080 --> 49:56.080]  There's a bunch of other houses.
[49:56.080 --> 49:58.840]  You see, I think like moves ahead.
[49:58.840 --> 50:06.280]  I'm not arrogant and the globalists that are arrogant are like, right up the white flag,
[50:06.280 --> 50:07.960]  stop, stop.
[50:07.960 --> 50:10.040]  Trump never blinks.
[50:10.040 --> 50:12.520]  He never backs down.
[50:12.520 --> 50:14.640]  He's a pragmatist.
[50:14.640 --> 50:17.040]  He's actually a libertarian liberal.
[50:17.040 --> 50:21.840]  He just has a soft spot for America and they think that's mentally ill to not like just
[50:21.840 --> 50:26.480]  harvest everybody and screw everybody over and can, I mean, I love Facebook explaining
[50:26.480 --> 50:31.240]  that folks about, oh, Bannon got five million of your names out of three billion and contacted
[50:31.240 --> 50:32.240]  you.
[50:32.240 --> 50:33.240]  He raped you.
[50:33.240 --> 50:35.960]  I just call you dumb ass and try to keep your depression, rip you off.
[50:35.960 --> 50:40.000]  You know, it's like, I've done 85 billion times what he did, but I'm going to tell you
[50:40.000 --> 50:51.080]  how it's like Hitler being the chief judge at Nuremberg and then sentencing Nazi cadets
[50:51.080 --> 50:53.560]  to be hung.
[50:53.560 --> 50:59.960]  That's what's so it's the hypocrisy and watching them have the knowledge and screw people that
[50:59.960 --> 51:04.240]  I want to just tell people about the trick, the hat trick.
[51:04.240 --> 51:07.960]  And they say, I'm mentally ill because I know how the hat trick works.
[51:07.960 --> 51:11.320]  I'm like a globalist, but I don't use it to F people over.
[51:11.320 --> 51:12.440]  Do you understand that?
[51:12.440 --> 51:13.440]  That's what's so frustrating.
[51:13.440 --> 51:14.880]  These are bad people.
[51:14.880 --> 51:21.040]  The average leftist is a lost, bought, desperate, mentally ill under their control doing whatever
[51:21.040 --> 51:23.720]  they say, hoping they can be somebody.
[51:23.720 --> 51:30.400]  They use people, but I know if you use people, it comes back on you.
[51:30.400 --> 51:37.160]  I thought if we built everybody up, I would rise.
[51:37.160 --> 51:41.720]  And that's why they say I'm an arrogant, crazy person because I'm projecting my own
[51:41.720 --> 51:43.560]  cell phone to general public.
[51:43.560 --> 51:45.440]  Well, I just know this.
[51:45.440 --> 51:48.760]  I'm not signing on to you devil worship or pedophiles operation.
[51:48.760 --> 51:50.760]  So that's not going to happen.
[51:50.760 --> 51:55.080]  I've told you, feel your hand, you have filled it.
[51:55.080 --> 51:57.960]  And so we'll see at the end of the day what happens here.
[51:57.960 --> 52:00.640]  All I know is I got to make a good showing in front of God.
[52:00.640 --> 52:02.920]  You people aren't in my equation.
[52:02.920 --> 52:06.200]  There's only one entity that's in my equation.
[52:06.200 --> 52:10.520]  And when I spiritually feel like I'm lined up with God, I'm fine.
[52:10.520 --> 52:13.960]  The minute I get out of alignment, that's when that's the real torture.
[52:13.960 --> 52:18.320]  You people see, I serve somebody like Bob Dylan said, you globalists haven't got that yet.
[52:18.320 --> 52:19.320]  I don't serve Hollywood.
[52:19.320 --> 52:20.720]  I don't serve your new order.
[52:20.720 --> 52:23.680]  I don't give a rat's butt about any of this.
[52:23.680 --> 52:28.200]  I care about lining my soul up with God and doing things that are right.
[52:28.200 --> 52:34.440]  And you think, because I'm not a big narcissistic, inbred, scumbag sociopath like you that I'm
[52:34.440 --> 52:35.440]  weak?
[52:35.440 --> 52:38.080]  No, you're weak.
[52:38.080 --> 52:42.320]  I'm just trying to get right with God.
[52:42.320 --> 52:44.000]  So I got a bunch of these clips.
[52:44.000 --> 52:49.680]  This is James Kallstrom, former deputy head of the FBI, says they plotted to undermine
[52:49.680 --> 52:53.480]  Trump, to frame him and to protect Hillary, and they perjured themselves, and it's all
[52:53.480 --> 52:54.480]  coming out.
[52:54.480 --> 52:58.320]  And Trump's willing to play those cards in its bombshell.
[52:58.320 --> 53:02.960]  And just like Trump's delivered on every other thing he said he'd do, I have the Tiger
[53:02.960 --> 53:03.960]  Man.
[53:03.960 --> 53:04.960]  He is there to take down the globalists.
[53:04.960 --> 53:08.800]  And this criminal cabal that was so arrogant, it thought it was invincible.
[53:08.800 --> 53:09.800]  Here's that clip.
[53:09.800 --> 53:16.520]  I think we have ample facts revealed to us during this last year and a half that high-ranking
[53:16.520 --> 53:22.560]  people throughout the government, not just the FBI, high-ranking people, had a plot to
[53:22.560 --> 53:30.640]  not have Hillary Clinton, you know, indicted, so that she could remain the flawed candidate
[53:30.640 --> 53:33.760]  that she was, which in my view was stupidity.
[53:33.760 --> 53:39.800]  And they also had a, and even this Strock guy talked about this, and they had a backup
[53:39.800 --> 53:44.720]  plan to basically frame Donald Trump, and that's what's been going on.
[53:44.720 --> 53:53.240]  This whole thing, in my view, is just total phony, total phony, planet phony.
[53:53.240 --> 53:54.240]  And that's it.
[53:54.240 --> 53:55.240]  That's it.
[53:55.240 --> 54:03.760]  That's all they've got, is that, as he said, they're making about the FBI, and as if you're
[54:03.760 --> 54:07.960]  saying the average FBI agent's bad, the FBI is a middle player in this.
[54:07.960 --> 54:12.960]  You've got the National Security Agency, you've got the CIA, you've got Defense Intelligence,
[54:12.960 --> 54:16.920]  you've got Director of Nationality, you've got all of them involved illegally spying
[54:16.920 --> 54:22.960]  on Trump, the campaign, that's totally illegal, lying about what data they gained, lying to
[54:22.960 --> 54:28.840]  Congress, and then they've got the FBI trying to fix the investigation to protect Hillary,
[54:28.840 --> 54:32.560]  and then, oh my God, they got us with the Russians, and they got us with the Chinese.
[54:32.560 --> 54:33.920]  Let's go blame it on Trump.
[54:33.920 --> 54:36.360]  I mean, that's the whole plan.
[54:36.360 --> 54:39.280]  It's crazy.
[54:39.280 --> 54:42.920]  So let's get into some of the perjury, because Trump's come out and said, Comey is a perjurer,
[54:42.920 --> 54:46.320]  and then everybody started threatening him, we'll get to those clips, we get after the
[54:46.320 --> 54:47.320]  next segment.
[54:47.320 --> 54:55.720]  But here is May 3rd, Comey saying that he never supplied anybody with information, and then
[54:55.720 --> 55:00.400]  a month later, in June 8th, he's saying he did, and again, they've got the recordings,
[55:00.400 --> 55:03.840]  they've got the files, they've got the FBI files, now they've got it all.
[55:03.840 --> 55:08.440]  Comey was leaking the whole time before Trump even got elected, before he was even president,
[55:08.440 --> 55:13.160]  before he was even the nominee, which is illegal, here it is.
[55:13.160 --> 55:20.320]  Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating
[55:20.320 --> 55:24.480]  to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?
[55:24.480 --> 55:26.320]  Never.
[55:26.320 --> 55:35.280]  So, that's May 3rd, let's go to June 8th, and here he is once he knows that they've
[55:35.280 --> 55:39.480]  already talked to the sources, FBI agents were there, there's been a lot of FBI agents
[55:39.480 --> 55:43.480]  with them, in fact, I'm not lionizing the FBI, but it is FBI agents that have actually
[55:43.480 --> 55:46.880]  been the critical witnesses of Congress, and the president, they're about to bring all
[55:46.880 --> 55:47.880]  this down.
[55:47.880 --> 55:52.320]  So, once he knows the FBI agents have told the truth, and blown his cover for his criminal
[55:52.320 --> 55:54.720]  operations, here's what he says.
[55:54.720 --> 56:04.520]  And finally, did you show copies of your memos to anyone outside of the Department of Justice?
[56:04.520 --> 56:05.520]  Yes.
[56:05.520 --> 56:06.520]  Yes.
[56:06.520 --> 56:08.680]  And to whom did you show copies?
[56:08.680 --> 56:14.120]  I asked, the president tweeted on Friday after I got fired that I better hope there's
[56:14.120 --> 56:15.400]  not tapes.
[56:15.400 --> 56:19.440]  I woke up in the middle of the night, on Monday night, because it didn't dawn on me originally,
[56:19.440 --> 56:23.000]  that there might be corroboration for our conversation, there might be a tape...
[56:23.000 --> 56:24.000]  Hip-Hoss.
[56:24.000 --> 56:27.200]  Oh, he never wrote all this down to be a fake record.
[56:27.200 --> 56:32.920]  Oh, he, he, Jeepers, Creepers, Lordy, Lordy, I'm such a good Sunday school boy, getting
[56:32.920 --> 56:38.200]  my yellow Volkswagen, I'll take care of you, Lordy, Lordy, I just thought, oh, I have,
[56:38.200 --> 56:41.320]  oh, I have the, oh, here it is.
[56:41.320 --> 56:45.280]  My judgment was, I needed to get that out into the public square, and so I asked a friend
[56:45.280 --> 56:50.900]  of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter, didn't do it myself for a variety
[56:50.900 --> 56:53.200]  of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought...
[56:53.200 --> 56:54.200]  The pause.
[56:54.200 --> 56:56.480]  I didn't leak, I just gave it to somebody.
[56:56.480 --> 56:59.640]  I didn't order somebody killed, I just gave the order.
[56:59.640 --> 57:04.240]  I didn't kill the guy, I just gave the order.
[57:04.240 --> 57:07.200]  You just heard classic mafia, let's finish.
[57:07.200 --> 57:10.760]  That might prompt the appointment of a special counsel, and so I asked a close friend of
[57:10.760 --> 57:11.760]  mine to do it.
[57:11.760 --> 57:13.400]  And was that Mr. Wittes?
[57:13.400 --> 57:14.960]  No, no.
[57:14.960 --> 57:15.960]  Who was that?
[57:15.960 --> 57:19.520]  A good friend of mine who's a professor at Columbia Law School.
[57:19.520 --> 57:21.800]  A good friend of mine.
[57:21.800 --> 57:26.600]  And for the FBI at that level, it's all about, are you seven feet tall, or do you look like
[57:26.600 --> 57:30.960]  you're really a good guy, like, well they be stun, we walk a seven foot tall guy in,
[57:30.960 --> 57:34.080]  it's all just, and he's just nothing but a little crook.
[57:34.080 --> 57:38.040]  Second hour straight ahead, spread those live links, stick in the eyes of Soros, Zuckerberg
[57:38.040 --> 57:39.040]  and all of them.
[57:39.040 --> 57:43.480]  We'll be back on Alex Jones, stay with us, big breaking news, breaking news in the second
[57:43.480 --> 58:02.840]  hour, stay with us.
[58:02.840 --> 58:07.200]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[58:07.200 --> 58:13.680]  Live from theInfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[58:13.680 --> 58:18.280]  Well we've got some incredible information about the break of the next segment.
[58:18.280 --> 58:23.000]  The arrogance of these people is only outmatched by their stupidity.
[58:23.000 --> 58:28.400]  So we'll look at this riddle, but all my lawyers have looked at these fake lawsuits against
[58:28.400 --> 58:32.800]  us, and I don't just put a good face on things, if something's bad I'll tell you, or I admit
[58:32.800 --> 58:35.480]  I've done something wrong.
[58:35.480 --> 58:40.560]  Stop lawyers, look at these lawsuits and they say, this is like a temper tantrum, this is
[58:40.560 --> 58:44.360]  not real, judges will never even advance this.
[58:44.360 --> 58:48.920]  The left is acting like they're in the battle of their lives because they are, and none
[58:48.920 --> 58:56.440]  of it matters, they just grandstand and temper tantrum, it's going to get them ahead, but
[58:56.440 --> 59:03.000]  well we'll cover it next segment, it's just mind-boggling.
[59:03.000 --> 59:20.440]  Now before we go any further, you've got Trump, who even though I disagree with some of the
[59:20.440 --> 59:29.280]  things Trump does, I can see his algorithm, and it's pragmatic, it's real, it's pro-prosperity,
[59:29.280 --> 59:37.280]  it's pro-free market, it's pro-symbiosis, it's pro-deals, the smarts of the general public,
[59:37.280 --> 59:43.920]  free will, Trump's a real free will guy, and I can see it, and I can see 14, 15 months
[59:43.920 --> 59:49.040]  into his presidency, the whole world turning around, and nationalism, and free market,
[59:49.040 --> 59:56.880]  and religious freedom, and so many good things exploding, and then I see the globalist panicking,
[59:56.880 --> 1:00:01.920]  I see them freaking out, and I see them attacking myself, and anybody else they see as a support
[1:00:01.920 --> 1:00:08.080]  mechanism for Trump, because as narcissistic Satanists they believe it's Alex Jones or
[1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:13.120]  it's Donald Trump, and this is key, who's creating all this, because these idiots all
[1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:17.520]  think they're the center of the universe, but they don't understand that we just metaphysically
[1:00:17.520 --> 1:00:23.680]  are signing on to what we already know as inherent, and real, and powerful, and true,
[1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:32.400]  we're not the fount, we're not the progenitor, we're not the engine, we're not the birthplace,
[1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:43.640]  we're not the zygote of this, we're simply strong nodes in that human quest for life
[1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:50.400]  and liberty and justice in a future, we're alive, and it's because we are alive they
[1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:58.400]  hate us, they live, we sleep, well I'm alive, and yeah I'm an arrogant person I guess, I
[1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:04.000]  don't need to see somebody else down on their luck and weak, I wouldn't feel good in some
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:11.280]  mountaintop chalet with 50 bedrooms and helicopters and all the best with all around me like Brazil,
[1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:17.680]  another area with just people crapping on themselves and enslavement, and keeping them
[1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:25.120]  politically suppressed so I could feel powerful by how low they were, and if you understand
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:31.120]  that essence, you understand everything, that's what Satanism is, it's all about you, it's all about
[1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:36.400]  the more selfish you are, if you're willing to rape a baby or slit its throat, you get all this
[1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:44.880]  power because you're this selfish god, that's a freaking joke, that's a cultural planetary abortion,
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:55.920]  and see to me my life isn't about me, it's about my progeny and the whole continuum
[1:01:55.920 --> 1:02:01.600]  because it is about me, and I realize I'm going on with the future through my progeny
[1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:05.760]  and I'm not going to be stopped and I'm not going to let a bunch of chicken crap BS global
[1:02:05.760 --> 1:02:10.480]  is getting away on that, and if they want to fight I'm ready for the animating contest
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:15.920]  because what they do to me only makes me stronger whether I even die in the process,
[1:02:16.560 --> 1:02:23.680]  I'll never be a piece of crap like they are, so the whole Russiagate thing is a projection
[1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:27.920]  of what Hillary was, it's in all the documents McCabe's been caught covering up Hillary's crimes,
[1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:31.680]  they've all been caught and the indictments are being readied for them, I can tell you now
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:35.920]  from my local sources they want to fight, they've got one, they're all going to be indicted,
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:41.440]  they're all going to prison, and all the scum and all the trash that thought they had their will over
[1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:44.720]  America, they're about to get their asses handed to them collectively.

[1:03:57.760 --> 1:04:01.680]  Coming to you from the former United States of America,
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:07.040]  from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:25.120]  All right, Leash ran a hands-on journalist that's worked for U.S. media, international media,
[1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:31.440]  you name it, citizenjournalismschool.com, thepapost.us and he was named last Tuesday in
[1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:38.000]  a lawsuit with myself, former congressman Allen West and others. And I want to get into that suit
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:44.400]  because it's not like the other millions of suits that are filed each year. It's in their own brief
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:50.080]  and I had top lawyers look at it, an attack on the First Amendment, it says we're Russian agents,
[1:04:51.040 --> 1:04:58.720]  it's just a total act of fiction, it's crazy. But also we pointed out that Soros was involved
[1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:04.000]  overthrowing Ukraine with State Department CIA funding and that other people that were involved
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:08.480]  covering the events in Charlottesville had worked with the State Department in clandestine positions
[1:05:08.480 --> 1:05:13.760]  and that usually that means CIA because the State Department is the CIA. We didn't even say that
[1:05:13.760 --> 1:05:19.520]  they particularly were because they conflated in the suit what we were saying. But Leash ran a hand,
[1:05:19.520 --> 1:05:27.360]  did some research, we're going to go to it here in just a moment. And it turns out the company,
[1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:35.440]  this gentleman Zett, brags that it carries out CIA covert operations, which isn't hard to predict.
[1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:42.160]  But then they defame us in the New York magazine, everywhere else saying that Stranahan and I say
[1:05:42.160 --> 1:05:49.600]  that this man that's suing us killed the woman run over by somebody. We never said that. My
[1:05:49.600 --> 1:05:55.200]  lawyers have spent a lot of money just a week, they've looked at all the clips and they go,
[1:05:55.200 --> 1:05:58.880]  you've never said this. They go, we've never seen a suit like this. I mean, I don't go on air and
[1:05:58.880 --> 1:06:05.440]  say this is a hoax suit just to say that. It's a hoax. All this stuff's a hoax.
[1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:12.800]  I had these people sue me and they go, about six months, I didn't realize what was going on. They
[1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:18.400]  go, Mr. Jones, we don't have a suit. How about X amount goes in your bank account and we drop it?
[1:06:19.360 --> 1:06:24.000]  My lawyers are like, this is a great deal when I go, okay, but they were building the case.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:30.720]  So the second time they filed suit, they offered me money and it's like millions of dollars.
[1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:35.360]  I go, no, no, we're going to court. No, no, no, don't do that. Don't do that. So it's this PR.
[1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:42.480]  They can put the defamation in a suit like these EEOC things like, we saw Jones with
[1:06:42.480 --> 1:06:49.360]  Russian agents giving him orders. This is in EEOC stuff. Jones was under the Russian commander's
[1:06:49.360 --> 1:06:57.040]  control and you're like, EEOC, what? It's like saying, Jones was with Captain Kangaroo and you're
[1:06:57.040 --> 1:07:07.600]  like, what is this? And then you realize they're just building this insanity with enough headlines
[1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:14.640]  thinking the listeners are dumb that it'll work. So look, I'm a smart guy sometimes, but
[1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:20.000]  so this isn't about info wars. It's not about Lee Strayani. It's not about Alex Jones.
[1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:22.800]  It's not about the citizen journalism school. It's about
[1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:30.160]  Hillary Clinton's main lawyers on the East Coast and West Coast are suing me.
[1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:37.600]  This groups, Georgetown University, the professors there, we're talking to the leaders of the
[1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:41.440]  university right now go, we didn't know this was happening. Let us fix this because
[1:07:41.440 --> 1:07:47.600]  no one's ever done something like this. This is rogue and it shows total panicking
[1:07:48.480 --> 1:07:53.280]  by the criminal elements of the deep state to just make up stuff we never said or did.
[1:07:53.280 --> 1:07:59.360]  So as long as you stand behind this and spread the articles, the books, the videos, as long as
[1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:03.440]  you buy the products, we'll make it through these fake lawsuits. But at the same time,
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:10.320]  the lawyers even say, we've never seen this type of craziness. So what does this signify?
[1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:15.200]  We'll get in the next segment of the documents, all the proof, what Lee Strayani has pulled up,
[1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:22.560]  dealing with all of this and the groups. But again, when I said the CIA did it,
[1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:31.760]  it's edited videos of us talking about Ukraine and Soros. And they mixed that together with other
[1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:36.800]  stuff we said about you got democratic operatives in Charlottesville when this woman gets killed,
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:42.000]  clearly being the spokespersons for the media, just like four kids out of 3,000 are with the
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:47.520]  shooting. We never said nobody died. We never said they were crisis actors. They say in the lawsuit,
[1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:55.520]  we should be shut down for seeing crisis actors. Nobody died because you can put defamation on
[1:08:55.520 --> 1:09:01.520]  lawsuit. So this is the deep state trying to take us down. And I'm not worried. I'm quite honored,
[1:09:01.520 --> 1:09:06.480]  quite frankly. Lee Strayani, we're going to go through your exhibits in the next segment,
[1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:13.280]  but just looking at this and looking at what's going on and then suing you and I
[1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:18.400]  for saying this guy had a CIA connection when we weren't even really, in most cases, talking about
[1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:24.320]  him. And then it looks like the connections are there. Again, it's like a lawyer would say,
[1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:33.520]  this doesn't, what do you think they're thinking? Well, this is clearly part of a longer play,
[1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:40.080]  Alex. What's going on here is a PR campaign that goes back. Well, actually, I would say,
[1:09:40.080 --> 1:09:47.120]  if you look in WikiLeaks, you can see some of the seeds of this at the founding of the Tea Party
[1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:52.640]  at that early time when remember the battle over Obamacare the early days of the Tea Party, right?
[1:09:52.640 --> 1:09:58.800]  And remember the media was accusing a Tea Party of being racist and a lot of the same things that
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:04.160]  we saw at Charlottesville. Well, who was one of the congressmen who was right in the middle of
[1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:11.200]  that controversy? It comes up actually in the WikiLeaks, Hillary Clinton emails, just look up the
[1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:21.920]  name Tom Periello. Tom Periello is the congressman from Virginia at the time and he's mentioned by
[1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:29.760]  Hillary Clinton in that email. And that's the guy suing his works for him. And that congressman
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:36.000]  gets massive, unusual Soros funding. Well, let's talk about that. Tom Periello is key to
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:42.080]  understanding it. He has a deep, long relationship with Brennan Gilmore, the man who's suing you,
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:48.400]  me, Alan West, Gateway Pundit and others, right? When I say a long relationship, you can find
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:57.120]  newspaper articles where they say that both Periello and Brennan Gilmore worked together
[1:10:57.120 --> 1:11:03.360]  like 15, about 15 years ago, it could be 14, but right around 15 years ago in Sierra Leone.
[1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:10.240]  Gilmore is a longtime State Department employee, but he's also been Tom Periello's
[1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:14.480]  chief of staff. So he's not a minor staffer. He's very tightly connected.
[1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:20.240]  He's the chief of staff. So basically, I mean, Periello looks like he's running a covert
[1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:28.320]  sex with chief operation. Well, I don't, so let me explain one thing. Let me explain why I go
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:33.680]  over facts like this too, because this is a big deal in the lawsuit, Alex. The reason a reporter
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:39.600]  like me sometimes, so like for instance, am I saying Brennan Gilmore is a CIA agent? I'm not
[1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:45.200]  saying that at all. I'm not at that point yet. But is the State Department involved with the CIA?
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:51.040]  Is the companies he worked for bragging they got CIA contracts? Yes, we're totally covered.
[1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:56.880]  Well, let me, let me just say this too. Part of the reason I put information out though
[1:11:57.920 --> 1:12:03.280]  is that maybe someone out there in the listening audience worked with this guy and it becomes a
[1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:08.880]  tipster. Alex, I've done this in story after story after story. You get a little bit of the story
[1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:14.240]  out and then people go, well, gee, this guy's a good reporter. He's, he's getting the facts
[1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:19.920]  correct. Then they come to me and they become a whistleblower. Does that make sense? Well,
[1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:24.080]  that's what scares them. So why are they so scared about the Charlottesville? What, what do you think
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:27.360]  we're going to break in a minute? But what is the in game plan? We'll come back, go through the
[1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:32.400]  documents we've got here of this being CIA connected. We're not saying they killed the woman. We never
[1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:36.560]  said that. That's all them lying, fake news. Yeah, never, never said that. Yeah, yeah. They don't
[1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:40.160]  have it. That's why it's a joke. So joke. They hope we get pissed at them and create something for
[1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:45.280]  the lawsuit right now. It's not going to happen. Well, why, what are they, what are they trying
[1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:52.640]  and what is the point of this? Well, we'll, we'll talk about that, but this is the real danger
[1:12:52.640 --> 1:13:00.000]  of Soros. He has fooled the left. He has bought the left out. And so now the people who were opposed
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:04.400]  to the deep state traditionally are all on the side of the deep state. We'll talk about it,
[1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:09.360]  Alex. When you'll see this, it's stunning. Well, I know you're a smart guy and I respect
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:12.880]  your work. Been wearing for years. They have a nice interview, probably 50 times. I'm just going
[1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:17.600]  to let you co-host. You know what? The only way I shut up is you got the last two segments. I'm
[1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:20.880]  going to just sit here and listen to you. We'll do one more segment together, but I'll let you
[1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:26.800]  co-host and just take over the fourth to fifth segment of this hour to end the transmission.
[1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:30.720]  Lee Shranahan is right ahead because he's dug up some amazing stuff and isn't about us.
[1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:36.960]  It's about understanding the larger picture and just how crazy this is. Try it out.

[1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:06.880]  And as a long time infowars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force,
[1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:11.440]  Anthroplex. My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex too. Thank you. I use the
[1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:16.160]  bio true selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans.

[1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:26.960]  I can't wait to get some more and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[1:17:26.960 --> 1:17:33.360]  Absolutely. Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women
[1:17:33.360 --> 1:17:38.160]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order
[1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:41.040]  and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:52.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:18:02.320 --> 1:18:09.600]  The blitzkrieg of globalist disinformation just ran through a big brick wall. It's called America
[1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:22.800]  and the rebirth of the republic. I'm your host Alex Jones, least ran and investigative journalist
[1:18:23.440 --> 1:18:26.800]  is our guest for the rest of the hour. I'm going to let him take over and really
[1:18:26.800 --> 1:18:31.360]  break all this down, not just the fake lawsuits against us, but what's behind it,
[1:18:31.360 --> 1:18:36.480]  the upcoming indictments, which I'm confirmed are about to happen. So much is going on. But here's
[1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:45.200]  an example of talking points memo far from a leftist site and let me sarcastic. And then you've
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:50.480]  got all these others saying new lawsuit reveals challenges of taking fake news peddlers to court.
[1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:57.760]  And then it goes on to say that Brennan Gilmore, this individual from the State Department that's
[1:18:57.760 --> 1:19:03.680]  saying that we say he killed a woman according to the article. They go on to say Jones says crisis
[1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:08.240]  actor staged the attack and that nothing actually happened in Florida. Never said that. There's
[1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:13.920]  no clip. There's no video. They just say it. But it goes in a complaint put together by lawyers
[1:19:13.920 --> 1:19:18.960]  for Georgetown law school civil rights center, which now is Antifree speech in federal court
[1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:23.120]  Tuesday. Gilmore claims false stories saying he was part of a deep state plot to undermine the
[1:19:23.120 --> 1:19:30.960]  Trump administration by staging the murder of anti racist activist Heather Hayer led to threats
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:37.440]  to his personal safety and cause potential damage to his career. So where's the link here? It's funny
[1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:39.680]  in journalism when we make when we say
[1:19:42.320 --> 1:19:49.200]  Bill Clinton settled a rape case where the Pope says communism's good or whatever it is. We link
[1:19:49.200 --> 1:19:56.720]  to it. Where is it? Well, it's not there. So that's how dumb they think you are. When they sued Jim
[1:19:56.720 --> 1:20:02.080]  Hoffton, Ellen West, myself, at least trying to end his homeless right now. So let's get into
[1:20:02.080 --> 1:20:08.000]  fact. He's also says that we say he CIA. We were talking in general about Soros and the funding
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:13.920]  of all this and State Department connections to that. But then it turns out you've got the
[1:20:13.920 --> 1:20:18.880]  organization, the group, you've done the research, the company he's an executive at reportedly
[1:20:19.600 --> 1:20:25.360]  brags of carrying out CIA contracts. So at least trying to hand let's teach them how journalism
[1:20:25.360 --> 1:20:31.760]  works right now. You got it. So let me let me do something a little even more fundamental
[1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:38.480]  before we get to that, Alex real simple point. This lawsuit claims that due to a report, for
[1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:46.320]  instance, that I did on info wars on August 15th. That's an important day that he was subject to
[1:20:46.320 --> 1:20:53.120]  threats. But in fact, in interviews that he gave with Judy Woodruff and in an article he wrote
[1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:59.600]  on Politico, he admitted that his own sister told him he was under threat on August 13th.
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:04.560]  So in other words, the threats had nothing to do with anything I said on info wars.
[1:21:05.360 --> 1:21:10.240]  Threats were happening two days earlier, according to believe it, he's a public figure.
[1:21:11.040 --> 1:21:15.680]  Obviously, the whole thing's a joke. Well, this is this is how it rolls. But let's talk about the
[1:21:15.680 --> 1:21:20.240]  connections. Because as you point out, there's two things they don't want. They're very upset in
[1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:28.880]  this suit that we tried to, they say, connect him as a CIA agent, or as a Soros puppet or
[1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:35.680]  something like that, neither of which were said. And about the about saying that he was responsible
[1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:41.280]  for Heather higher being killed, let me say, emphatically, not only did I not say it, I don't
[1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:46.880]  believe it. Do you believe that? No, no, we're saying Soros, well, they even cut off our headlines.
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:52.080]  They said, Soros should be indicted for staging Charlottesville chaos. They cut the chaos off.
[1:21:52.720 --> 1:21:56.480]  We didn't say stage start. We're saying he funds Antifa. They're there.
[1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:02.720]  But here's the good news. The lawyers, I'm sure you've talked to your own.
[1:22:02.720 --> 1:22:08.160]  They say they've never seen such a flip shot lawsuit. So the question is, why are they filing
[1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:15.120]  these these these these these BS things? Well, let me say this, too, there's another blessing
[1:22:15.120 --> 1:22:21.200]  in disguise here, Alex. Normally, as a journalist, I don't get to question people under oath,
[1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:27.360]  but I have some questions about Charlottesville. And now, because someone sued me, I'm going to
[1:22:27.360 --> 1:22:33.920]  get to ask that person questions under oath. We're going to get this opinion is bank records.
[1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:39.440]  Let's do it. Now, at the company, he's an executive at and the congressman even see the staff or that
[1:22:39.440 --> 1:22:44.560]  say they're running CIA operations. Let's let's that's the big bomb show. They sue us for saying
[1:22:44.560 --> 1:22:49.200]  they're connecting to CIA. We didn't really say that. But but now let's get into it right now.
[1:22:50.560 --> 1:22:55.360]  And so let's do that. And there's no Soros connect. That's the two things they say.
[1:22:55.360 --> 1:23:00.960]  There's no CIA connection, no Soros connection. Okay, let's go over it. So first off, Tom Pirello,
[1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:06.560]  who I mentioned before. Remember, Brendan Gilmour is his chief of staff. If you look into he ran
[1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:12.800]  for governor this past year, didn't make it out of the primaries. His top funder was drumroll George
[1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:18.000]  Soros. That's not me saying it. That's the Washington Post reporting in it. That's the FEC reports
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:24.240]  reporting that he was a major funder of Pirello's campaign. Let's start with that. Now, what you're
[1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:31.040]  talking about is something that I unveiled in the Periscope last night. It's that Brendan Gilmour is
[1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:40.560]  in a company. He's one of three executives in this company, right? And the two others. I want to
[1:23:40.560 --> 1:23:47.840]  focus on one in particular, Dario Marquez. Okay. Does another man tell folks the name of the company
[1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:51.840]  because document cam guys, I've got the articles right here. It's wise, right? That's them right
[1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:56.480]  there. And if you scroll, if they scroll down a little bit there, Alex, you'll see a picture
[1:23:57.040 --> 1:24:02.640]  of Brendan Gilmour. There's Mr. Marquez. There's Mr. Gilmour. This is clearly the same Brendan
[1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:08.000]  Gilmour who's suing us to right? Same biographer. That's him and look at the power trip right there.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:14.880]  He's a public figure. He's out there. That's, that's right. Now let's talk about Dario Marquez.
[1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:22.800]  Couple things. First off, Dario Marquez is a former secret service agent and he formed a company
[1:24:23.440 --> 1:24:31.920]  called MVM. Now MVM is a military contractor. If you look, the Wall Street Journal wrote about MVM.
[1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:36.960]  Okay. Now again, this is the guy that, that Brendan Gilmour is in business with here.
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:43.120]  He had a company MVM. MVM was a military contractor like Blackwater. That's the way the Wall Street
[1:24:43.120 --> 1:24:52.880]  Journal described them. So I just, I mean, Blackwater is the clandestine CIA. Well, and in this Wall
[1:24:52.880 --> 1:25:02.160]  Street Journal article, you can find where Marquez admits freely that the, they worked for the NSA
[1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:09.120]  and the CIA. Okay. So boom. Our boy is one of the top three executives of the company that's in the
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:13.840]  Wall Street Journal saying they carry out CIA contracts and we're not mean pencil pushing here.
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:19.600]  We mean military contractor. Military contractor like Blackwater. That's the way they're defined.
[1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:25.280]  So let, let's just stop for a second and talk about. We're being sued saying the guy's CIA
[1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:29.760]  connected. We didn't even say that. And now he's an executive of the company that brags the Wall
[1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:36.400]  Street Journal. They don't, they're not just CIA. They're running muscle operations and for the NSA
[1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:43.120]  in Iraq. Yep. That's what that's, it's right there. Now let's talk about Tom Purello for a
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:50.800]  second. Tom Purello is known as a sort of liberals liberal on the left. Okay. The reason Soros funded
[1:25:50.800 --> 1:25:57.920]  him is he's a guy who got the endorsement of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Right. Now,
[1:25:57.920 --> 1:26:04.160]  traditionally, when you think about people like Bernie Sanders, they're anti-war. Right. That's,
[1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:11.040]  that's the way we think of the left. I want to point out what's happened here. There's a reason
[1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:16.560]  Soros is funding a guy like Purello. There's a reason for it. You're taking over. So I shut up.
[1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:20.720]  You're going to get the next two segments straight ahead on the other side. Lee Lee's on target. We
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:25.760]  got all the articles right here. I mean, wow, these, these guys, the arrogance, the, the, the
[1:26:25.760 --> 1:26:31.760]  insolence, uh, here, here's the McCabe, all the globalist, all these parasites that have hijacked
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:35.760]  the country. Your time is coming. And no matter what happens, no, there's scumbags. We're coming
[1:26:35.760 --> 1:26:42.160]  for you in full wars.com news wars.com. The second American revolution is now spread those links
[1:26:42.160 --> 1:26:49.680]  and defeat the globalist. They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools
[1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:55.040]  to teach children that their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers
[1:26:55.040 --> 1:27:00.960]  and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:07.360]  their ex president to endorse the resistance all to make them march, make them protest, make them
[1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:14.240]  scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down
[1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:20.480]  interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the
[1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:26.720]  police to do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse
[1:27:26.720 --> 1:27:34.000]  for their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:41.440]  is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth. I'm the national rifle association

[1:30:57.280 --> 1:31:11.280]  Waging War on Corruption. Alex Jones.
[1:31:11.280 --> 1:31:16.320]  I want to lead to be able to roll this out in this segment and the next so I'm going to just
[1:31:16.320 --> 1:31:18.880]  sit back and listen to what he has to say here and I'm going to punch you out in a minute and
[1:31:18.880 --> 1:31:26.640]  just sit back here but let me just say it from the heart. I fight the globalist so hard because
[1:31:26.640 --> 1:31:32.320]  they're so anti-human, they're so evil, they're such liars, they're such scumbags, there's such
[1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:39.440]  pieces of crap from the chicken you know what dimension you know the chicken SH what T dimension.
[1:31:39.440 --> 1:31:44.320]  That's how I describe it they're just these jerks they don't play by the rules they don't care about
[1:31:44.320 --> 1:31:53.360]  basic humanity. An example is my daughters were their mom the last week up in Connecticut skiing
[1:31:53.360 --> 1:31:59.440]  which is great and when they called me this morning they said yeah my middle daughter was talking to
[1:31:59.440 --> 1:32:06.400]  some kids they were with at ski camp and who their dad was and then the dad walked over and
[1:32:06.400 --> 1:32:12.080]  yelled and screamed at my daughter I mean the left involves children and things they they
[1:32:12.080 --> 1:32:17.280]  anti for beats of women they just they have no rules they're they're scum and they're all about
[1:32:17.280 --> 1:32:27.040]  guilt though and how they're good so I look at all this and I pull back from it and I want to
[1:32:27.040 --> 1:32:32.640]  ask Lee Stranahan this I'm going to punch out with him take over why would you have a guy's
[1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:38.800]  state department who videotapes this woman getting run over come out and follow lawsuits saying we
[1:32:38.800 --> 1:32:44.800]  said he killed the woman when there's no video that we never said that there's no audio and then
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:50.560]  he heads up a company that brags in the Wall Street Journal they've got CIA contracts we just
[1:32:50.560 --> 1:32:55.520]  showed that to TV viewers I can I can go over the headlines that folks want it all right case
[1:32:55.520 --> 1:33:02.000]  sheds light on secret contractors I mean this guy's company's in secret contractor articles
[1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:07.200]  we're not just talking about CIA analytics you know analytics or you know some little
[1:33:07.200 --> 1:33:13.280]  supplement this is like the teeth of the CIA and all the articles Airbnb house white nationalist and
[1:33:13.280 --> 1:33:19.360]  all of it my lawyers look at this and they go this is desperate temper tantruming
[1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:23.200]  that doesn't mean we don't have to fund the lawsuits and deal with it it just means like
[1:33:25.040 --> 1:33:30.640]  what is what's the motive of these guys what's their problem Lee what are you well you're a smart
[1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:36.480]  guy you don't speculate as a journalist but as a personal guy being sued they they know they've
[1:33:36.480 --> 1:33:42.560]  got these contracts they know that we're talking about Soros and the CIA they didn't I think they're
[1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:47.520]  saying well there's events like this and we put a narrative out we're not seeing their stage in the
[1:33:47.520 --> 1:33:51.920]  event they put their narrative out stay out of our narrative that's what they're pissed about is
[1:33:51.920 --> 1:33:56.080]  that we're there talking about the narrative saying hey let's ask questions whether it's
[1:33:56.080 --> 1:34:02.080]  Charlottesville or whether it's Lakewood or Parkview or whatever the hell it is they just
[1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:07.680]  don't like us questioning the narrative I think that's it that they're mad that we're just
[1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:13.040]  questioning things not even saying what we know what's got them so mad go ahead and take over
[1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:21.840]  well I think what got them so mad is that Charlottesville in some ways was the culmination
[1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:29.040]  of the Black Lives Matter movement that they had put a lot of money and exactly their piss that
[1:34:29.040 --> 1:34:33.440]  it blew up in their face and then a month later Pelosi saying Black Lives Matter and Antifa's
[1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:42.240]  terrorist yes and so it's a failed project it's a failed project well in in in some ways and Trump's
[1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:49.280]  election proved a failure in other words the way it really failed was it failed to stop all everything
[1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:55.680]  they threw at them the people still were like you know what I trust Trump over Hillary Clinton
[1:34:55.680 --> 1:35:01.120]  that's it and they were very upset and is he not fulfilled that trust what are they gonna do now
[1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:07.760]  well yeah that that's right well here's what's very interesting and I know it's it's weird to
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:15.920]  think about this but I I think the left is being victimized by George Soros there Soros has figured
[1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:23.680]  out how to use the left to promote an agenda that is really the antithesis so is George Soros
[1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:31.680]  a leftist yes or no clearly he's a leftist is he a greedy capitalist clearly yes right and that's
[1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:38.320]  kind of a weird contradiction but let's talk about I want to correct one thing uh the the guy who's
[1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:44.560]  suing us Brennan Gilmore he's an executive in a company where the founder of the company's
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:50.880]  other company is the one who is connected to the CIA sure sure exactly he he works with a guy that
[1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:55.920]  created the clandestine operation group we're not even saying he's CIA we're just saying CIA all
[1:35:56.960 --> 1:36:04.720]  but this company itself may or may not be connected because it's the same guy who who owns both of
[1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:10.960]  them and Gilmore's with one of those companies but I just want to clarify that there are two
[1:36:10.960 --> 1:36:18.240]  different companies here that being said does this mean that there's a CIA involvement that
[1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:22.320]  Brennan Gilmore has I'm not saying that and if I thought that I would tell you let me give you
[1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:27.360]  another scenario let me give you another possibility maybe it's just a political connection why do I
[1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:32.080]  say that well that's all we said was you keep getting politicos at these events like the you
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:37.440]  know the kids that are anti-gun on a 3000 they get all the coverage that's what we said and well
[1:36:37.440 --> 1:36:42.720]  what I said no right and what I said also was I don't know what's going on I'm just trying to
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:47.520]  piece it out here's what we know let's talk about this guy Dario Marquez now again he's the guy whose
[1:36:47.520 --> 1:36:56.080]  company was a blackwater style military contractor Dario Marquez also happened to be a top donor to
[1:36:56.080 --> 1:37:03.520]  a pack that was headed up by drumroll please Tom Perriello Brennan Brennan Gilmore's close
[1:37:03.520 --> 1:37:10.720]  work associate yeah she was there for that exactly right so Perriello had a a pack called
[1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:18.960]  win Virginia now it's supposed to be a progressive pack okay and if you look at the fundraising for
[1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:28.000]  that pack you will see that Dario Marquez who's the same guy who's partnered with Brennan Gilmore
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:35.920]  in this other company Dario Marquez was also a major donor to this Tom Perriello headed pack
[1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:42.800]  you're with me there so this is important because it just shows that there's another connection here
[1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:49.360]  not military not deep state but political and that's very well could be what was going on
[1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:55.520]  it could also be a personal connection but let's be clear not a correction a clarification
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:38:01.360]  we're not saying a woman wasn't run over we're not saying this Brandon guy you know did this
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:06.320]  what we're saying is is that you've got politicos at these events obviously in an
[1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:11.440]  anti-fascist rally that are the spokesperson's exacerbating it saying Trump's Hitler
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:19.440]  exactly right and I keep seeing Soros connections everywhere here no I know he finds the whole
[1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:22.960]  thing but that's what I'm asking you is then and I hear take over the next segment
[1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:28.720]  what do they think they're getting out of it my lawyers just think it's the PR stunt of the lawsuit
[1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:32.720]  and then they don't care if it gets defeat because they say there's no way this goes forward this is
[1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:38.480]  like crap well this is one of the points I've been making Alex if you want to really get to the
[1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:43.920]  to the motivation here I think there's something very sneaky going on here's what it is traditionally
[1:38:43.920 --> 1:38:49.600]  in this country when we think of people fighting for free speech we think of the left right if
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:54.000]  you think about the 50s and 60s and sure so it's the left trying to have this right free speech
[1:38:54.560 --> 1:38:59.360]  that's that's right now if you think about who's the anti-war movement in this country traditionally
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:06.640]  it's the left what they're doing here what Soros is buying for his money no like you said he's
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:13.840]  getting the left to be pro-war pro censorship they're killing the left that's that's exactly right
[1:39:13.840 --> 1:39:20.720]  and if you look around usually the ACLU would be taking the side look we don't I remember the
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:28.160]  Illinois Nazis back in the 80s when I was growing up 80s 90s and ACLU came out to defend them here
[1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:33.680]  the ACLU's had a cut tail and run and the reason why is Soros spreads his checks over that's not
[1:39:33.680 --> 1:39:41.280]  conspiracy theory he he finds every damn word you can imagine that's that's right and that's
[1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:47.840]  what I think is going on here every when I looked into the groups the civil rights unit who's suing
[1:39:47.840 --> 1:39:54.640]  us and the voting rights institute at Georgetown every member of their advisory board for voting
[1:39:54.640 --> 1:40:00.320]  rights institute all 12 people I were directly working with organizations that are directly
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:06.720]  funded by George Soros's own society every single one it's incredible this guy thought he was the
[1:40:06.720 --> 1:40:12.480]  messiah 30 years ago when he wrote a book but in a way he kind of is the messiah of evil I mean he
[1:40:12.480 --> 1:40:17.600]  he's like the devil's messiah it's just like how could one guy be involved in so much evil well
[1:40:17.600 --> 1:40:21.680]  he's almost run a bunch of countries he's swendled so much money I mean it's incredible all right
[1:40:21.680 --> 1:40:25.440]  at least right and you're doing the final segment and I'm leaving so you intro it you out throw it
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:32.000]  great points wow ladies and gentlemen this is incredible I mean this is the battle for the

[1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:03.040]  you
[1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:22.160]  you are either with the republic or against it from the front lines of the information war
[1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:24.320]  it's alex jones
[1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:34.720]  hey there everybody welcome back to the alex jones show here at info wars.com
[1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:40.400]  my name is lee stranahan i'm an investigative reporter and i want to thank alex for trusting
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:45.600]  me to do this last segment we're talking about the lawsuit that was filed this past tuesday
[1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:51.920]  against alex jones and info wars against me against jim hoff my friend over at the gateway pundit
[1:45:51.920 --> 1:45:58.080]  alan west and other people and this lawsuit was filed by a man named brennan gilmore
[1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:05.200]  and brennan is a state department employee he's a political democratic chief of staff
[1:46:05.200 --> 1:46:12.480]  person for uh tom perriello who's a congressman in virginia and mr gilmore is also the person
[1:46:12.480 --> 1:46:20.480]  who happened to videotape the best shot of the car crashing in to the crowd of people back in
[1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:26.560]  august back on august 12th of last year in charlottesville killing heather hyer murdering her
[1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:35.040]  and i did a segment last year uh on august 15th a few days after this where i was interviewed
[1:46:35.040 --> 1:46:39.840]  and i talked about some things that i mentioned the fact that brennan gilmore who shot that video
[1:46:39.840 --> 1:46:47.040]  works for the see uh works for the state department forgive me and uh i mentioned that he worked for
[1:46:47.040 --> 1:46:53.680]  uh tom perriello i did not say he worked for the cia i don't believe he works for the cia
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:46:59.840]  because i have no proof that he works for the cia i don't believe he was responsible for
[1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:04.960]  engineering heather hyer's death that would be a horrible accusation to make i didn't say it because
[1:47:04.960 --> 1:47:09.840]  i don't believe it what i did say was that he worked for the state department he worked for
[1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:15.280]  tom perriello and that's why i'm being sued and literally if you read the lawsuit itself
[1:47:15.280 --> 1:47:23.120]  that's why i'm being sued so one of the reasons i'm actually happy that alex jones is my co-defendant
[1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:30.080]  and alex may not want to hear this but i'm happy to have alex as a co-defendant because alex is
[1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:36.000]  one of the few people out there in the media who when he gets hit with a lawsuit like this
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:43.760]  he doesn't cower he doesn't hide under the bed and my mentor andre bryepard was a little bit
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:49.520]  like that as well and that's why you know i i like someone with some fight in them and i got the same
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:55.840]  fight myself and jim hoffed over a gateway pundit the same way so i've said this before
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:48:01.280]  but brennan gilmore you picked the wrong wrong people to sue sorry brennan you picked the wrong
[1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:08.240]  people to sue if you were counting on us shutting up and between with the audience that jim has and
[1:48:08.240 --> 1:48:13.600]  that alex has this is a lot of people you're trying to shut up i know you're a musician i
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:19.600]  know you play bluegrass i suggest you look into the stricand effect anyone can look that up and
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:24.720]  you'll see that's the effect where barbra stricand sued some people who took a helicopter picture
[1:48:24.720 --> 1:48:29.760]  of her estate and so what happened was everybody published the picture that's called the stricand
[1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:37.200]  effect and mr gilmore you're going to get it because your suit is an affront to anyone who
[1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:43.600]  believes in the first amendment you can't sue somebody for telling the truth just because you
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:50.720]  think one possible interpretation is that you work for the cia let's talk about some other
[1:48:50.720 --> 1:48:56.400]  political connections and by the way i challenge anybody just follow along with the facts look
[1:48:56.400 --> 1:49:00.960]  up what i'm about to show you and you'll find another interesting connection to charlotte's
[1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:07.280]  bill what does this mean i don't know but let's go ahead and take a look so i mentioned in the last
[1:49:07.280 --> 1:49:14.640]  segment that uh tom perriello has a pack called win virginia now remember brennan gilmore's worked
[1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:21.280]  closely with tom perriello as the chief of staff this win virginia pack if you look at the fundraising
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:29.360]  numbers uh the donors you'll see the one big donor there is dario marquez who i mentioned earlier
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:36.720]  but if you look at the top donor i believe you'll see the very two top donors are reid hoffman
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:46.400]  and technology for democracy llc now technology for democracy llc is effectively reid hoffman
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:52.800]  so who's reid hoffman this big donor of the pack here that perriello is ahead of reid hoffman is a
[1:49:52.800 --> 1:50:00.800]  big angel investor in silicon valley perhaps you've heard of one of his things which is linked in the
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:06.720]  big social media site for business people he's the guy behind that he's also one of the first
[1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:13.520]  investors and is still on the board of air b and b you're with me air b and b that's who reid hoffman
[1:50:13.520 --> 1:50:21.280]  is now why do i mention air b and b if you look back to the charlotte's bill unite the right
[1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:28.640]  rally that was the center of all this remember that happened on august 12th it began on august 11th
[1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:36.160]  but if you go back to about august 8th three days before the rally there was already a story
[1:50:36.160 --> 1:50:43.360]  that air b and b the same company that reid hoffman tom perriello's big donor at his win
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:50.400]  virginia pack right you'll see that air b and b that company made headlines across the country
[1:50:50.400 --> 1:50:57.040]  by saying that they had cancelled the memberships of people at the unite the right rally now i don't
[1:50:57.040 --> 1:51:03.440]  know if you're like me my friends on the right didn't know anything about the unite right the
[1:51:03.440 --> 1:51:09.760]  right rally in other words the people i know who read info wars bright bart daily caller and so on
[1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:16.080]  the people on the right we're not thinking about this remember this was like 200 largely white
[1:51:16.080 --> 1:51:22.080]  nationalists that's who's there about two 300 people not a big well attended event this was not
[1:51:22.080 --> 1:51:30.560]  like a tea party rally so what happened stories like this set a media narrative oh air b and b
[1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:37.360]  pulled out they don't want to they went it was making things more difficult for the people
[1:51:37.360 --> 1:51:46.320]  showing up to the rally so here's a question i have was there did reid hoffman at air b and b
[1:51:46.320 --> 1:51:53.680]  get the heads up from tom perriello does he know brendan gilmore a brendan gilmore
[1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:59.760]  reid hoffman i assume he does maybe i'm wrong but here's the beautiful thing about it right now
[1:51:59.760 --> 1:52:05.600]  they picked the wrong people to sue because now what i get to do since they sued me is i get to
[1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:11.920]  get brendan gilmore in a deposition and while i'm at it i think i probably need to depose his
[1:52:11.920 --> 1:52:18.160]  business partner david marquez i should probably also depose reid hoffman because he has a clear
[1:52:18.160 --> 1:52:24.560]  connection to the charlottesville thing i don't know what it means but now they can't duck my phone
[1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:31.440]  calls they can't avoid my emails as a reporter i'm used to that now they have to sit in a chair
[1:52:31.440 --> 1:52:38.400]  while i or someone representing me or better yet alex jones just picture that picture them
[1:52:38.400 --> 1:52:43.600]  under the bright deposition lights getting a few questions from alex about what their role is and
[1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:50.640]  about what they were doing that is an episode you're not going to want to miss now again i don't
[1:52:50.640 --> 1:52:55.920]  think they realize what they were doing i'm not saying i know what was going on the thing that
[1:52:55.920 --> 1:53:01.920]  drives me as a reporter is curiosity but i'm saying you can look it up yourself win virginia
[1:53:02.800 --> 1:53:10.240]  biggest donor reid hoffman oh and one other thing while you're looking that up look into a cia
[1:53:11.440 --> 1:53:20.400]  tech company an incubator if you will called intel what it's intel acue and if you look it up you'll
[1:53:20.400 --> 1:53:26.640]  see that another investment company that reid hoffman has something to do with called gray hawk
[1:53:26.640 --> 1:53:31.760]  also has something to do with intel acue so that's another thing you can look up yourself again this
[1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:36.960]  is i'm pointing this out not because i think it means anything if i knew what it meant i'd just
[1:53:36.960 --> 1:53:42.320]  tell you that i'm pointing it out because as you start to lay out the beats of a story it gets very
[1:53:42.320 --> 1:53:47.120]  very interesting now i'm going to mention one other thing we mentioned in the last segment that
[1:53:47.120 --> 1:53:54.960]  uh brennan gilmore is in a company uh with his guide dario marquette marquez from mvm okay now
[1:53:55.600 --> 1:54:03.040]  the other person who's in that company uh is a man named michael titmos and michael titmos is also
[1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:09.920]  been involved in companies that were directly involved with the nsa and the cia according to
[1:54:09.920 --> 1:54:17.040]  a filing that they did so it's not just one of the partners in the company that has a cia nsa
[1:54:17.040 --> 1:54:24.080]  connection it's not just one it's both of them what does that mean i don't know what it means
[1:54:24.080 --> 1:54:29.040]  what it means is it's a fact and one of the reasons we do something like this and one of the reasons
[1:54:29.040 --> 1:54:37.520]  again i'm i'm very proud to to be able to get a few minutes of alex's audience's time is to tell you
[1:54:37.520 --> 1:54:42.480]  we're at a point right now where you can't take anybody's word on this stuff don't take my word
[1:54:42.480 --> 1:54:50.240]  on it go look it up yourself and this is exactly why they're afraid of info wars alex has said the
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:55.600]  reason he named his company free speech is if you ever got sued and you'll see that's in his
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:55:02.160]  company free speech i'll see is that people were suing free speech well guess what that is exactly
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:08.320]  what's going on here people are suing free speech and they're doing it because out there they think
[1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:14.000]  you know we live in a world where alex jones's daughter will get yelled at by another parent
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:18.720]  that's the world we live in so they know what we're up against but the thing that they're afraid of
[1:55:18.720 --> 1:55:25.520]  is that you the audience like everyone here at info wars is actually independent for the alex
[1:55:25.520 --> 1:55:40.800]  show and show from washington you see my name is chrending it pretty good
