[00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:16.785]  I mean, there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:26.589]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.029]  Scum!
[00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.270]  Russian scum!
[00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:39.303]  Until worse comes to mind.
[00:00:39.303 --> 00:00:42.547]  Your reputation's amazing.
[00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:44.008]  I will not let you down.
[00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:46.871]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:54.172]  It's Sunday, the 18th day of March 2018.
[00:00:54.172 --> 00:00:55.493]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:55.493 --> 00:00:59.316]  We'll be live here for the next two hours, then we're back with a weekday transmission.
[00:00:59.316 --> 00:01:07.782]  David Knight, 8 a.m., myself at 11 a.m., and of course, 3 o'clock, Owen Schroyer and Roger Stone and others, The War Room.
[00:01:07.782 --> 00:01:13.207]  Certainly not a boring time to be live, and there's never a slow news day, as some people would like to say.
[00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:16.950]  Sometimes mainstream media doesn't have its talking points out, and they take a vacation, but
[00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:28.921]  We never sleep here when it comes to defending not just this republic, but the future of humanity and the defense of free will and our own chance to govern our own destiny.
[00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.523]  There's so much I want to get to here.
[00:01:31.523 --> 00:01:39.527]  The Justice Department is moving with indictments against McCabe, Comey, and Hillary Clinton, finally, along with others in their crime network.
[00:01:39.527 --> 00:01:43.389]  I have that from sources very high up, and the sources have been telling me this for a month.
[00:01:44.398 --> 00:01:50.295]  And then now I'm seeing people, very prominent former deputy directors and others, saying exactly what I've been told.
[00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:51.679]  So I've been kind of sitting on this.
[00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:55.333]  Because, folks, no, I'm not a wishful thinker.
[00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:59.036]  I don't tell you something's going away until it's going that way.
[00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:00.477]  Minds might get changed.
[00:02:00.477 --> 00:02:04.040]  The Democrats might roll over and back off and let us make the country great again.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.243]  And then maybe there could be some detente.
[00:02:08.243 --> 00:02:10.385]  Because I don't want to have the big train wreck that's going to come from this.
[00:02:10.385 --> 00:02:20.713]  But it's better than going into the long night of tyranny and letting the Clinton crime cabal continue to stay in power and sell us out to the Communist Chinese and others.
[00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:30.974]  And Trump tried to give them a chance to go quietly out to pasture, not into the dark night, but just take their stolen loot and go.
[00:02:30.974 --> 00:02:43.057]  They put Napoleon on Alba and then another island, not because they didn't hate the guy, but because he had a lot of networks and a lot of people and they wanted him to make a deal and give up for everybody's greater good.
[00:02:43.917 --> 00:02:48.801]  Well, he snuck back a few years later, as everybody knows, and had to be finally completely locked up.
[00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:52.903]  Not just given his own island and, you know, a few hundred of his own troops.
[00:02:52.903 --> 00:02:54.805]  Because with that little network, he launched attacks again.
[00:02:54.805 --> 00:02:57.467]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:02:57.467 --> 00:02:58.828]  They're not going to give up.
[00:02:58.828 --> 00:02:59.968]  They're not going to go away.
[00:02:59.968 --> 00:03:02.170]  They're crazy.
[00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.531]  So huge news on that front.
[00:03:03.531 --> 00:03:06.193]  Also, Vladimir Putin re-elected.
[00:03:06.193 --> 00:03:08.154]  There were globalists trying to hack in and block that.
[00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:09.195]  A lot of craziness there.
[00:03:09.195 --> 00:03:10.096]  That's all coming up.
[00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:11.857]  And I'm going to spend some time on this.
[00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:13.418]  You know, I normally check Grudge Report.
[00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:16.256]  Five, six, ten times a day.
[00:03:16.256 --> 00:03:17.196]  I didn't today.
[00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:28.141]  I was watching my wife on her iPad, and I saw some of the stuff she was looking at, so I kind of got it away from her when she started cooking lunch.
[00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:32.363]  I'm just explaining how my surfing habits, and I went down the rabbit hole to London Guardian.
[00:03:32.363 --> 00:03:36.065]  I didn't know that Drudge had it as well as his top story.
[00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:39.726]  The Cambridge Analytical Files.
[00:03:39.726 --> 00:03:41.467]  Meet the whistleblower.
[00:03:41.467 --> 00:03:43.688]  I created Steve Bannon's psychological warfare tool.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.783]  Staff claim Analytica ignored ban on foreigners working elections.
[00:03:48.783 --> 00:03:52.326]  Facebook suspends Zuckerberg to testify before Senate Committee.
[00:03:52.326 --> 00:03:53.407]  Socials weaponized.
[00:03:53.407 --> 00:03:54.768]  Data harvested.
[00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:55.768]  Behaviors predicted.
[00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:58.951]  Manipulated.
[00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:07.877]  This is like in 2018 saying, this young man invented the automobile in 2014.
[00:04:07.877 --> 00:04:10.319]  He was the first ever to have an automobile.
[00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.621]  They're like, automobiles have been around for a hundred and something years.
[00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:15.837]  That's what social networks are.
[00:04:15.837 --> 00:04:16.939]  That's how they data mine.
[00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:18.200]  It's how they harvest.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.203]  They're 100% democrat globalist worldwide.
[00:04:21.203 --> 00:04:22.785]  They fund the Arab Spring.
[00:04:22.785 --> 00:04:24.287]  They fund all these uprisings.
[00:04:24.287 --> 00:04:28.532]  They fund the war in Ukraine, the war on Russia, the war against Brexit.
[00:04:28.532 --> 00:04:33.878]  Oh, but one young guy who was in these companies
[00:04:34.696 --> 00:04:41.159]  They're now putting him out there, knowing people aren't technical, like, he invented this, he discovered it, and they harvested millions of names.
[00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:42.119]  Yes.
[00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:50.323]  Steve Bannon, with this guy, developed basically a spitwad shooter compared to a 5,000 megaton hydrogen bomb.
[00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:52.484]  Okay?
[00:04:52.484 --> 00:04:57.686]  In fact, pull me that clip of the top historian coming out and saying the social networks are taking over for the globalists, not the other way around.
[00:04:57.686 --> 00:04:59.867]  Print me that article, I need that clip.
[00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:02.568]  Introducing Cell Force by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:03.257 --> 00:05:07.218]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:05:07.218 --> 00:05:10.579]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:05:10.579 --> 00:05:13.100]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.841]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:05:17.841 --> 00:05:20.181]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[00:05:20.181 --> 00:05:26.563]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:05:27.203 --> 00:05:35.386]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:05:35.386 --> 00:05:40.448]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:05:40.448 --> 00:05:47.411]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:53.003]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWars Life.
[00:05:53.003 --> 00:05:55.904]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:02.152 --> 00:06:03.413]  We're breaking the conditioning!
[00:06:03.413 --> 00:06:04.614]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:05.415]  Alex Jones.
[00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:06.215]  Alex Jones.
[00:06:06.215 --> 00:06:06.856]  Alex Jones.
[00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:09.898]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[00:06:09.898 --> 00:06:19.465]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:21.167]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:06:21.167 --> 00:06:25.090]  It's confirmed there are recent shooters on the fully automatic website.
[00:06:26.648 --> 00:06:30.830]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.291]  J.F.
[00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:34.052]  King was shot from the back and the front.
[00:06:34.052 --> 00:06:36.974]  It was almost as if there were a plant imploding.
[00:06:36.974 --> 00:06:38.335]  It just pancaked.
[00:06:38.335 --> 00:06:42.477]  He took the baby by the pinky fingers and left the children to die on the street.
[00:06:43.797 --> 00:06:45.858]  I think this is a national security emergency.
[00:06:45.858 --> 00:06:53.121]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.
[00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:54.262]  UFOs!
[00:06:54.262 --> 00:06:56.363]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:06:56.363 --> 00:06:57.383]  Is it one world?
[00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:58.844]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:06:58.844 --> 00:07:00.505]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[00:07:01.185 --> 00:07:02.245]  Some former U.S.
[00:07:02.245 --> 00:07:04.306]  Naval officers say it was on purpose.
[00:07:04.306 --> 00:07:07.847]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[00:07:07.847 --> 00:07:13.449]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:14.989]  Russian scum!
[00:07:14.989 --> 00:07:15.829]  Denied everything!
[00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:17.310]  He called it all fake news!
[00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.351]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[00:07:20.351 --> 00:07:22.231]  This is the national emergency.
[00:07:22.231 --> 00:07:26.593]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[00:07:27.993 --> 00:07:31.457]  This is a theme that I love a little bit.
[00:07:31.457 --> 00:07:33.559]  We are at war with Russia.
[00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:39.244]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and Wikileaks?
[00:07:39.244 --> 00:07:42.287]  The White House and the President are citing InfoWars.
[00:07:42.287 --> 00:07:45.090]  They can shut us down, you're next!
[00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.875]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:07:49.875 --> 00:07:51.517]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:07:55.223 --> 00:08:04.327]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are two giant news stories that we're going to predominantly cover here on this live Sunday broadcast today, the 18th day of March 2018.
[00:08:04.327 --> 00:08:09.709]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:17.313]  And there's a lot of other big tidbits like Vladimir Putin getting reelected with a landslide.
[00:08:17.313 --> 00:08:22.175]  But the first big story is the firing of McCabe before he got his pension.
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:38.243]  The hysteria in Washington, the open and shut case that he perjured himself and his wife got a half million dollars from Hillary, and that they used government money to pay for Fusion GPS, and then he sat over that cabal, that organization.
[00:08:38.243 --> 00:08:41.583]  Oh, and of course, the big one.
[00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:49.204]  Protected Hillary, protected all her crimes with Eric Holder, and of course, Ms.
[00:08:49.204 --> 00:08:51.505]  Lynch after that.
[00:08:51.505 --> 00:08:52.085]  Loretta Lynch.
[00:08:53.849 --> 00:08:56.711]  Comey's been caught perjuring as well before Congress.
[00:08:56.711 --> 00:08:59.512]  It's open and shut, and that's just what we know.
[00:08:59.512 --> 00:09:02.174]  Imagine what the President knows.
[00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:05.795]  So, all of that said, that's going to be coming up today.
[00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:14.380]  In fact, I'm going to hit that first, after I get some other important news out of the way, in the next segment.
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:19.703]  And of course, then you've got to ask yourself, how big a response are we going to see from the MSM globalists?
[00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:23.826]  What other tricks up their sleeves do they have?
[00:09:23.826 --> 00:09:30.796]  This is obviously a very dangerous, critical time for the American reboot that we're all in the middle of right now.
[00:09:30.796 --> 00:09:37.166]  Now that said though, I want to tackle this first because I'm not an IT expert.
[00:09:38.306 --> 00:09:42.868]  When it comes to zeros and ones and, you know, programming.
[00:09:42.868 --> 00:09:47.151]  I mean, I took programming some in middle school and high school and did a little bit of it here and there.
[00:09:47.151 --> 00:09:53.934]  But if I try to focus on a computer and engineering or electricity or anything, I mean, I can actually get pretty good at it.
[00:09:53.934 --> 00:09:55.515]  But it's not my forte.
[00:09:55.515 --> 00:09:57.616]  It's not the direction I've gone in.
[00:09:57.616 --> 00:10:06.461]  What I do is I study what the experts say in the big swath of where a technology is going, what it's based on and how it operates.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:23.529]  Now, two years ago, Google came out, and they said that when they were founded in the late 1990s with CIA and NSA funding and money, that the government officials that were there from In-Q-Tel and DARPA said, we already have a bunch of search engines and systems, what is this?
[00:10:23.529 --> 00:10:31.333]  They said, sir, and Wired Magazine wrote about this two years ago, we first, of course, covered it over a decade ago, we're building an over-the-horizon
[00:10:32.472 --> 00:10:34.394]  Future predicting system.
[00:10:34.394 --> 00:10:38.417]  But once you can predict it, you can also manipulate people with stimulus to control them.
[00:10:38.417 --> 00:10:43.822]  And we want billions of people plugged into a supercomputer so it can machine learn.
[00:10:43.822 --> 00:10:51.969]  And then we're going to put everybody in their own groups and manipulate and control them, basically through peer pressure and bullying.
[00:10:51.969 --> 00:10:59.155]  Now, remember last year, Sean Parker came out, the former head of Facebook and others, a bunch of executives there went public.
[00:10:59.155 --> 00:11:00.716]  Documents got released in Australia.
[00:11:01.613 --> 00:11:22.499]  Where they said we exploit liberals mainly, we exploit people that are depressed, we exploit young people and we try to keep them desperate and alone and we have fake bots that manipulate them that look like real people but that they're avatars and then we data mine billions of people a day to then manipulate through peer pressure and control them.
[00:11:25.433 --> 00:11:29.135]  Facebook told advertisers to identify teens feeling insecure and worthless.
[00:11:29.135 --> 00:11:37.120]  So now that they make you depressed, now they're gonna offer psychology tests and things and then recommend, you know, drugs you should be put on.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.602]  So, you know, it's kind of a whole 360 spectrum.
[00:11:40.602 --> 00:11:45.224]  They're even making money off of how they make you depressed and basically doom your life.
[00:11:45.224 --> 00:11:47.285]  And there's thousands of articles admitting this.
[00:11:47.285 --> 00:11:49.807]  So imagine, I have that curse.
[00:11:49.807 --> 00:11:51.988]  I have that thing called a memory.
[00:11:53.377 --> 00:12:06.885]  And so when I got up this morning, and my wife was reading The London Guardian on her iPad, I went and spent, like I do, two and a half hours reading everything about it from every angle.
[00:12:06.885 --> 00:12:16.751]  And it is just a ridiculous PR stunt with this new superhero character they're launching that has pink hair, so you know you've got to listen to him.
[00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:20.433]  And he's gay, so you can't question him just at that point.
[00:12:20.433 --> 00:12:21.914]  Who cares if you're gay, dude?
[00:12:21.914 --> 00:12:22.334]  Give me a break!
[00:12:23.507 --> 00:12:26.029]  Other people walk up and say, I'm heterosexual!
[00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:28.451]  Dun-dun-dun, or I'm... Whatever, man, I don't care!
[00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:32.014]  It's not that I dislike you because you're gay, I don't care!
[00:12:32.014 --> 00:12:33.054]  I don't care!
[00:12:33.054 --> 00:12:35.216]  I don't care!
[00:12:35.216 --> 00:12:41.861]  So... Stephen Hawking dies as their PR guy, and then one week later, we've got the new guy.
[00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:43.382]  And it's like Jesus arrived.
[00:12:43.382 --> 00:12:46.144]  He's the greatest genius the world ever saw.
[00:12:46.144 --> 00:12:53.150]  He has a way to track people on social networks, and know what group they're in, and then bully them with bots,
[00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:56.412]  To make them politically do what he wants.
[00:12:56.412 --> 00:12:58.713]  It says he invented it in 2014.
[00:12:58.713 --> 00:13:01.734]  Dun, dun, dun.
[00:13:01.734 --> 00:13:07.416]  I mean, this is... Folks, he also invented in 2014 fire.
[00:13:07.416 --> 00:13:12.258]  He invented the wheel.
[00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:15.939]  In fact, he... Jesus was gay and he was married to him.
[00:13:15.939 --> 00:13:17.960]  I'm being sarcastic.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.361]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:20.801]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:22.462]  Social networks were...
[00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:26.492]  Theoretize at MIT in the 70s.
[00:13:26.492 --> 00:13:28.013]  Stephen Shinnick's talked about it.
[00:13:28.013 --> 00:13:37.557]  My dad at UT wrote seminal papers on it that were then picked up and basically went into the classification bin.
[00:13:37.557 --> 00:13:40.498]  My dad told me about social networks when I was five years old and the whole plan.
[00:13:40.498 --> 00:13:41.758]  Okay?
[00:13:41.758 --> 00:13:43.879]  So, no, but no, no, no, no.
[00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:45.960]  I didn't tell you all about this 20 years ago.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.161]  This hasn't been going on publicly for about 15.
[00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.762]  This man invented it.
[00:13:52.771 --> 00:13:55.033]  Now that's how they do it, you see.
[00:13:55.033 --> 00:13:59.576]  They go, oh my God, the Russian collusion, it's incredible.
[00:13:59.576 --> 00:14:04.620]  Stephen Bannon went with some Mercer money.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:14.727]  And they went in, and they wanted somebody to go harvest conservatives and libertarians from the database to activate them politically and motivate them.
[00:14:14.727 --> 00:14:16.209]  And when I saw the numbers of 5 million,
[00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:25.305]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars got hundreds of millions of freethinkers worldwide mobilized to just promote free market and capitalism.
[00:14:25.305 --> 00:14:26.966]  We weren't paid by the Mercers.
[00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:32.391]  Five million is a joke.
[00:14:32.391 --> 00:14:41.778]  But again, they know the general public doesn't know this, so they have this huge to-do about, you know, the cool gay guy with pink hair and the camo jacket who didn't know what he was doing and he's really sorry.
[00:14:41.778 --> 00:14:42.579]  He's God.
[00:14:42.579 --> 00:14:44.220]  He gave us Promethean fire.
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.161]  He knew everything.
[00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:55.807]  And there's one email where they pitched a Russian bot company to help do their operation, and so that's the proof of Russian collusion, even though it never happened.
[00:14:55.807 --> 00:14:59.489]  And it says, I made Steve Bannon's psychological warfare tool.
[00:14:59.489 --> 00:15:02.311]  Meet the Data War Whistleblower.
[00:15:02.311 --> 00:15:03.452]  Oh, like Info War?
[00:15:03.452 --> 00:15:05.893]  Oh, did you invent Info War, too, young man?
[00:15:05.893 --> 00:15:07.854]  Did your pink hair invent it?
[00:15:07.854 --> 00:15:09.015]  And you read this crap.
[00:15:09.015 --> 00:15:11.176]  I mean, it's like a 20-page article or more.
[00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:13.838]  And then I read a bunch of others, and it's just a giant hoax.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.181]  It's a total hoax.
[00:15:16.181 --> 00:15:23.405]  Bannon never covered up the fact that he went and tried to data mine to create a database to expand Breitbart and all this other stuff.
[00:15:23.405 --> 00:15:27.547]  Because as a Democrat globalist, I guess he thought he could capitalize off that or whatever.
[00:15:27.547 --> 00:15:31.609]  But that's what, there's probably 20 companies in Austin bigger
[00:15:32.344 --> 00:15:35.147]  Then Cambridge Analytics doing the same thing for the Democrats.
[00:15:35.147 --> 00:15:37.048]  They're the ones that dominate it all.
[00:15:37.048 --> 00:15:43.053]  But if conservatives and libertarians even try to toy with it, they go, Oh my God, you're manipulating everyone!
[00:15:43.053 --> 00:15:45.335]  It's Zuckerberg calling his users dumb effers.
[00:15:45.335 --> 00:15:51.141]  They admit the whole thing is a giant manipulation, and data mining, and putting people in pins, and bullying them.
[00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:54.964]  But oh, this guy with pink hair invented it, and oh, the Republicans are using it.
[00:15:54.964 --> 00:15:57.146]  Bots are illegal when Republicans have them.
[00:15:58.718 --> 00:16:04.121]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:16:04.121 --> 00:16:06.983]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:16:06.983 --> 00:16:08.964]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:16:08.964 --> 00:16:13.987]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:16:13.987 --> 00:16:16.088]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:16:16.088 --> 00:16:17.369]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:16:17.369 --> 00:16:22.252]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:16:22.472 --> 00:16:29.358]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:16:29.358 --> 00:16:32.361]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:16:32.361 --> 00:16:36.044]  It's loaded with good halogen iodides of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:16:36.044 --> 00:16:42.970]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:48.054]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[00:16:57.477 --> 00:17:01.818]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[00:17:01.818 --> 00:17:06.020]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:12.722]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[00:17:12.722 --> 00:17:16.463]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[00:17:17.183 --> 00:17:31.057]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding.
[00:17:31.057 --> 00:17:36.683]  Until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[00:17:37.243 --> 00:17:41.366]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[00:17:41.366 --> 00:17:52.594]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[00:17:52.594 --> 00:17:57.718]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[00:17:59.435 --> 00:18:08.165]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[00:18:08.165 --> 00:18:08.705]  That's right.
[00:18:08.705 --> 00:18:13.971]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Right's freeze dryers.

[00:18:28.223 --> 00:18:28.464]  Woo!
[00:18:28.464 --> 00:18:29.504]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:18:29.504 --> 00:18:38.230]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:46.196]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:18:47.817 --> 00:18:51.261]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:55.385]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:56.446]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:19:00.436 --> 00:19:05.920]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.761]  I take this.
[00:19:06.761 --> 00:19:07.902]  My family takes this.
[00:19:07.902 --> 00:19:12.185]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[00:19:12.185 --> 00:19:16.788]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:21.432]  If I ever forget to take them, like, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:19:21.432 --> 00:19:22.553]  I don't feel good.
[00:19:22.553 --> 00:19:26.315]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:19:26.315 --> 00:19:29.017]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:19:29.017 --> 00:19:29.398]  I had a
[00:19:29.858 --> 00:19:32.680]  A few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.781]  Hitting the gym once again.
[00:19:34.781 --> 00:19:35.982]  Very exciting.
[00:19:35.982 --> 00:19:36.603]  Feeling great.
[00:19:36.603 --> 00:19:37.743]  Looking good.
[00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:41.186]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:19:41.186 --> 00:19:43.527]  So obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[00:19:43.527 --> 00:19:44.048]  I love it.
[00:19:44.048 --> 00:19:46.849]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:19:46.849 --> 00:19:47.870]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:53.834]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:19:53.834 --> 00:19:55.695]  It's got a 5-star rating.
[00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:56.936]  It's a win-win.
[00:19:56.936 --> 00:19:57.897]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:02.875 --> 00:20:05.503]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.313 --> 00:20:25.814]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:25.814 --> 00:20:30.077]  We're going to get into the imminent indictments of McCabe, Comey, Hillary, you name it.
[00:20:30.077 --> 00:20:32.358]  The word is, they've got the evidence, they're going forward.
[00:20:32.358 --> 00:20:33.999]  Trump delivers on every front.
[00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.840]  He always does what he says he'll do.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.821]  And how are they going to respond?
[00:20:36.821 --> 00:20:37.981]  They are so panicked.
[00:20:37.981 --> 00:20:39.382]  They're openly threatening the president.
[00:20:39.382 --> 00:20:42.124]  Wait till we get to that in the next segment.
[00:20:42.124 --> 00:20:46.467]  But since I mention this, let me try to quantify this because it's a big deal.
[00:20:46.467 --> 00:20:52.030]  The world is learning about how social networks have been weaponized from the beginning.
[00:20:52.671 --> 00:21:09.203]  To make you depressed, to control you, to make you a globalist, to make you a leftist, to bully people with bots that sound like they're regular folks, ridiculing you when you Twitter or Facebook something right of Mao Zedong or V.I.
[00:21:09.203 --> 00:21:10.945]  Lenin.
[00:21:10.945 --> 00:21:19.191]  And so now it's well known, it's always been in the news, that Bannon, Ford Breitbart, wanting a database of conservatives,
[00:21:20.117 --> 00:21:39.802]  Went in 2015-16 and paid different companies to go into the profiles of Facebook and to create a database and a relationship for political mailers.
[00:21:39.802 --> 00:21:41.763]  Conservatives hadn't even done that.
[00:21:42.558 --> 00:21:43.539]  Everything's leftist.
[00:21:43.539 --> 00:21:46.781]  Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube.
[00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:51.244]  They're the ones that admit 99% of it's leftist, globalist.
[00:21:51.244 --> 00:21:52.485]  Sean Parker's gone public.
[00:21:52.485 --> 00:21:52.806]  All of it.
[00:21:52.806 --> 00:21:54.047]  They try to keep you depressed.
[00:21:54.047 --> 00:21:57.289]  They try to keep you under their control.
[00:21:57.289 --> 00:22:03.093]  And then you read this big article, the Cambridge Analytica files.
[00:22:03.093 --> 00:22:08.377]  I made Stephen Bannon's psychological warfare tool meet the data war whistleblower.
[00:22:08.377 --> 00:22:09.518]  And then when you read the article,
[00:22:10.174 --> 00:22:17.498]  What they're saying is standard data mining, public source, totally legal.
[00:22:17.498 --> 00:22:25.503]  Once they got the codes to get into the private Facebooks and public ones, they would then have bots strike up relationships.
[00:22:25.503 --> 00:22:31.107]  That's what the Democrats and the globalists and the modern Internet is.
[00:22:31.107 --> 00:22:34.889]  So, Bannon goes and does a primitive attempt to get into it.
[00:22:35.578 --> 00:22:45.925]  And they do what they were doing a decade before, and now they write huge articles like, like he discovered free energy.
[00:22:45.925 --> 00:22:53.230]  It's like saying you discovered radio in 2018 when it was invented by Marconi in what, 1889 or something?
[00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:57.073]  Look up when Marconi discovered radio, please, and publish this.
[00:22:57.073 --> 00:22:58.474]  I'm just going from memory.
[00:22:58.474 --> 00:23:00.515]  It was 18-something.
[00:23:00.515 --> 00:23:04.498]  So, I'm reading this and it's like, this guy's got pink hair!
[00:23:05.302 --> 00:23:07.483]  He discovered radio in 2018.
[00:23:07.483 --> 00:23:12.125]  And it's a total cut out.
[00:23:12.125 --> 00:23:15.687]  It's like everything else.
[00:23:15.687 --> 00:23:16.807]  Yeah, he worked at the company.
[00:23:16.807 --> 00:23:19.888]  Yeah, Bannon went and did it.
[00:23:19.888 --> 00:23:20.829]  Yeah, there were
[00:23:21.627 --> 00:23:35.416]  Millions of dollars of Russian bots involved, 80% of them were anti-Trump, including rallies that Michael Moore attended against Trump that was funded by the Russian bot company, because you get around campaign finance laws by going overseas, and who's famous for that?
[00:23:35.416 --> 00:23:36.397]  The Clintons!
[00:23:36.397 --> 00:23:38.519]  The Clinton Foundation!
[00:23:38.519 --> 00:23:39.139]  Billions!
[00:23:39.139 --> 00:23:45.363]  1888, when did I say?
[00:23:45.363 --> 00:23:46.944]  My memory, it's just incredible.
[00:23:46.944 --> 00:23:49.206]  If I just don't question my memory, it's almost always right.
[00:23:51.061 --> 00:23:54.063]  But then there was a debate about it and three other guys kind of did it at the same time.
[00:23:54.063 --> 00:24:01.989]  I think it was published and agreed that he was... I think it was 1889 that he was recognized as inventing it.
[00:24:01.989 --> 00:24:04.451]  But I believe the first transmissions were in 1888.
[00:24:04.451 --> 00:24:05.351]  Anyway, side issue.
[00:24:05.351 --> 00:24:06.992]  Hadn't looked at that in 30 years.
[00:24:06.992 --> 00:24:07.893]  Let me get... I'm not bragging.
[00:24:07.893 --> 00:24:09.414]  I'm just saying, folks, I don't make this crap up.
[00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:13.517]  People see me up here saying all this stuff and they think there's no way this guy actually knows all this stuff.
[00:24:13.517 --> 00:24:15.739]  I do and more, believe me.
[00:24:15.739 --> 00:24:16.679]  And it's not bragging.
[00:24:16.679 --> 00:24:17.320]  I'm just letting you know.
[00:24:18.138 --> 00:24:18.798]  No, no, no.
[00:24:18.798 --> 00:24:19.979]  He didn't invent radio.
[00:24:19.979 --> 00:24:21.560]  This guy with pink hair did.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.741]  I don't care that he's got pink hair.
[00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:29.624]  Hell, there are more people with pink hair in America now or purple hair than there are with just a regular color.
[00:24:29.624 --> 00:24:31.024]  Mine's all fallen out and gray.
[00:24:31.024 --> 00:24:32.485]  I don't give a damn.
[00:24:32.485 --> 00:24:36.327]  He's got pink hair, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:36.327 --> 00:24:38.268]  And I read this crap.
[00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:40.649]  I mean, I spent hours on this today and I couldn't believe it.
[00:24:41.747 --> 00:25:09.712]  Yes, Bannon invented a system with this pink haired guy to bully people with fake bots so you think you're really conservative and have friends and then it gives you confidence and then and then you go out and you do things and then oh yes oh Steve Bannon with this guy in 2000 this guy in 2014 Bannon a year and a half later they invented organizing people on social networks and data mining it for political purposes really
[00:25:11.107 --> 00:25:21.533]  Because a couple years before that, they funded the whole Arab Spring to overthrow a bunch of countries, and Google, Facebook, and Twitter admittedly honchoed it.
[00:25:21.533 --> 00:25:25.835]  But see, that's all buried in the back of the newspaper.
[00:25:25.835 --> 00:25:27.536]  See how that works?
[00:25:27.536 --> 00:25:30.858]  It's all just, man, that whiz kid's incredible.
[00:25:30.858 --> 00:25:31.958]  Yeah, did you hear?
[00:25:31.958 --> 00:25:33.819]  He invented steam engines in 2018.
[00:25:33.819 --> 00:25:35.220]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.862]  And he, listen, he invented fire and shoes.
[00:25:38.862 --> 00:25:39.883]  And let me tell you about this guy.
[00:25:39.883 --> 00:25:40.343]  What's his name?
[00:25:41.613 --> 00:25:45.456]  Christopher Weil, he invented toilet paper.
[00:25:45.456 --> 00:25:45.936]  That's right.
[00:25:45.936 --> 00:25:50.600]  My God, he's got a nose ring, pink hair.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.061]  God, he's powerful.
[00:25:52.061 --> 00:25:53.001]  I don't know what to do right now.
[00:25:53.001 --> 00:25:54.803]  I'm kind of threatened right now by an intellect that big.
[00:25:56.494 --> 00:25:59.495]  And everyone's just, oh my gosh, oh, what are we gonna do?
[00:25:59.495 --> 00:26:05.877]  They got this power, the Republicans are dominating the internet, they're censoring and they've got mind control weapons.
[00:26:05.877 --> 00:26:15.159]  All they did was data mine 5 million people to create a new mailing list to get them politically involved and try to get donations out of them.
[00:26:15.159 --> 00:26:22.001]  The Democrats would fix the search results daily with Hillary Clinton in between phone calls with Google.
[00:26:22.001 --> 00:26:23.822]  She was getting the questions for the debate.
[00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:29.433]  Planting questions for Trump, and then lying about it all on the same day.
[00:26:29.433 --> 00:26:30.733]  Everything rigged!
[00:26:30.733 --> 00:26:32.574]  Everything tilted!
[00:26:32.574 --> 00:26:36.916]  And then they're like, how do we keep these Republicans from being able to use bots?
[00:26:36.916 --> 00:26:43.879]  Because their worldview is so much more popular, and people want nationalism, and God, we're selling tyranny versus capitalism.
[00:26:43.879 --> 00:26:44.479]  How do we do that?
[00:26:45.419 --> 00:26:46.640]  Just say it's Russian?
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.344]  Have a big genius come out with pink hair and talk about how they invented it?
[00:26:50.344 --> 00:26:52.166]  Oh, that's how Trump won.
[00:26:52.166 --> 00:26:55.149]  He had all these fancy things to steal it.
[00:26:55.149 --> 00:27:06.440]  But, oh, Facebook, Google, Twitter, CNN, ABC News, NBC, all of the whole Hollywood combine, foreign governments, the EU, the Pope, the Communist Chinese, all piling on.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.661]  But Trump still won.
[00:27:07.661 --> 00:27:09.343]  How do we make it look like
[00:27:09.563 --> 00:27:14.794]  We're not hated, and there hadn't been a total political realignment, and the whole world's turning against us.
[00:27:14.794 --> 00:27:15.576]  What do we do?
[00:27:18.183 --> 00:27:27.108]  Just like Comey 2012, oh there's an African in Central Africa with all these slaves and he's evil and look there's a trendy university student fighting it and let's raise a million dollars.
[00:27:27.108 --> 00:27:29.950]  Comey's on the CIA payroll, been protected the whole time.
[00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:38.494]  He's a ghost profile there, so they have an excuse to invade wherever they want and I already knew that before I know the people that sit down and have dinner with him and deliver him lost rockets.
[00:27:42.023 --> 00:27:49.567]  That's what this comes down to, and that's why I spent so much time on this, is because I love Drudge, and I know it's a big, breaking story.
[00:27:49.567 --> 00:27:52.328]  Can you guys pop Drudge back up there for me?
[00:27:52.328 --> 00:27:55.549]  But, you know, it's all the big story up there.
[00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:59.131]  The Cambridge Analytica file's gone!
[00:27:59.131 --> 00:28:00.051]  They invented fire!
[00:28:00.051 --> 00:28:02.893]  Oh, what is it?
[00:28:02.893 --> 00:28:03.913]  Meet the whistleblower!
[00:28:03.913 --> 00:28:05.394]  Oh, he's got pink hair, geez, he's powerful!
[00:28:05.394 --> 00:28:07.395]  Oh my God!
[00:28:07.395 --> 00:28:09.916]  I created Steve Bannon's psychological warfare tool.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.201]  Oh yeah, you want lower taxes?
[00:28:12.201 --> 00:28:13.581]  Want your sovereignty back?
[00:28:13.581 --> 00:28:16.703]  Want to stop being bashed by globalists and being pissed all over?
[00:28:16.703 --> 00:28:18.964]  Yeah, the truth's called psychological warfare.
[00:28:18.964 --> 00:28:21.585]  The truth's called victory.
[00:28:21.585 --> 00:28:26.287]  That's why Trump's so important, and has so much courage, and it's so amazing, because he's just not out to get you.
[00:28:26.287 --> 00:28:29.869]  So, the whole Stephen Bannon thing, this whole deal about
[00:28:31.181 --> 00:28:32.521]  Analytica and all this.
[00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:33.282]  It's a big story.
[00:28:33.282 --> 00:28:34.882]  I'm glad Drudge is covering it.
[00:28:34.882 --> 00:28:49.026]  My point is, is that it's hiding in plain view when you read this crap that Bannon was trying to go back to what was around 10 years before or more and trying to tinker toy and so making a foray into their whole fake bot Facebook world.
[00:28:49.026 --> 00:28:50.806]  They're saying no, no, no.
[00:28:50.806 --> 00:28:57.968]  Now they put an article out trying to introduce bots to the world as if libertarians and conservatives are the ones that invented it for social control.
[00:28:58.914 --> 00:29:05.177]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.

[00:31:02.998 --> 00:31:04.220]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:16.908]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:31:16.908 --> 00:31:25.534]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:31:25.974 --> 00:31:31.937]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:31:31.937 --> 00:31:37.040]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.641]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:31:39.641 --> 00:31:41.362]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:31:41.362 --> 00:31:50.767]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:31:51.367 --> 00:31:54.008]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:31:54.008 --> 00:31:59.229]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:31:59.229 --> 00:32:09.292]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[00:32:09.612 --> 00:32:16.717]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:16.717 --> 00:32:21.580]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:28.384]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:28.384 --> 00:32:35.469]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:32:35.529 --> 00:32:42.573]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:42.573 --> 00:32:47.055]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:32:47.055 --> 00:32:56.740]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:02.303]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:02.303 --> 00:33:04.965]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:09.819 --> 00:33:15.665]  I'm picking up a fake transmission right now.
[00:33:15.665 --> 00:33:18.368]  I think it's Alex Jones calling.
[00:33:18.368 --> 00:33:19.009]  On screen.
[00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:20.550]  But here's the good news, chumps.
[00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:28.498]  You think you're gonna assassinate Trump, shut down the identity, and bully a bunch of us into going along with you?
[00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:31.810]  I'd like reserve power.
[00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:32.231]  No.
[00:33:32.231 --> 00:33:33.951]  How long from being willing to have a fight?
[00:33:33.951 --> 00:33:35.732]  Twenty-one at this point.
[00:33:35.732 --> 00:33:41.173]  And only the dumbest morons buy into your SJW globalist George Soros dropping.
[00:33:41.173 --> 00:33:41.973]  Stabilizer.
[00:33:41.973 --> 00:33:42.954]  Emergency reserve.
[00:33:42.954 --> 00:33:45.834]  Hillary Clinton and the New World Order and Michael Moore.
[00:33:45.834 --> 00:33:49.095]  Go back to Hades where you came from.
[00:33:49.095 --> 00:33:52.636]  We're awake and you're not putting us back in the coma.
[00:33:52.636 --> 00:33:54.097]  You got that, Jack?
[00:33:54.097 --> 00:33:55.517]  You're done.
[00:33:55.517 --> 00:33:56.517]  It's over.
[00:33:56.517 --> 00:33:57.798]  Worldwide.
[00:33:57.798 --> 00:33:58.318]  Get him back.
[00:33:58.318 --> 00:33:58.898]  Get him back.
[00:34:18.401 --> 00:34:27.464]  The Cambridge Analytica file story, that is one of the biggest stories in the worldwide media right now, is a giant disgusting hoax.
[00:34:27.464 --> 00:34:29.945]  And I'm gonna just say this and I'm done talking about it.
[00:34:29.945 --> 00:34:35.347]  I already broke it down earlier and laid it all out.
[00:34:35.347 --> 00:34:39.069]  They're saying that Stephen Bannon and some pink-haired guy
[00:34:40.729 --> 00:34:55.198]  Develop the idea to data mine Facebook in 2014, 15, 16 for political purposes and that they have bots that then contact people and try to get them politically involved.
[00:34:55.198 --> 00:35:04.443]  That's what MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, all of that's been going on since the inception of the Internet as we know it.
[00:35:04.443 --> 00:35:07.465]  When you send somebody an auto response on email, that's a bot.
[00:35:08.917 --> 00:35:12.859]  And there's been no discussion of bots and manipulation politically.
[00:35:12.859 --> 00:35:15.040]  I've been talking about it forever.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.961]  Except when they talk about Trump.
[00:35:18.961 --> 00:35:25.444]  And Congress, in their investigation, even admits less than one half of one percent of bot activity in 2016 was Russian.
[00:35:25.444 --> 00:35:27.585]  And 80% of that was leftist.
[00:35:27.585 --> 00:35:29.485]  Russia is like America.
[00:35:29.485 --> 00:35:30.986]  It's overrun with leftists.
[00:35:30.986 --> 00:35:34.147]  It's overrun with Soros operators.
[00:35:34.147 --> 00:35:35.428]  The Russians are just aware of it.
[00:35:35.428 --> 00:35:37.849]  Internationalists.
[00:35:38.462 --> 00:35:41.244]  I've had enough of New York, D.C.
[00:35:41.244 --> 00:35:41.924]  globalism.
[00:35:41.924 --> 00:35:47.068]  It was the left went and took over Russia in 1917, a hundred years ago plus.
[00:35:47.068 --> 00:35:51.231]  Believe me, they've had a good gang raping.
[00:35:51.231 --> 00:35:55.333]  Bernie Sanders wanted to have his honeymoon in there in the 70s and he did.
[00:35:55.333 --> 00:36:01.397]  He doesn't want to have it there now, because it's not a place to have his way with Christians.
[00:36:01.397 --> 00:36:02.518]  That's what this is.
[00:36:02.518 --> 00:36:04.599]  The globalists want to mount your head on the wall.
[00:36:04.599 --> 00:36:05.500]  They're evil.
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.441]  They want dominance.
[00:36:06.441 --> 00:36:07.261]  They want control.
[00:36:07.261 --> 00:36:08.222]  They're mentally ill.
[00:36:09.597 --> 00:36:10.818]  Just like Hitler.
[00:36:10.818 --> 00:36:12.559]  Just like Mao.
[00:36:12.559 --> 00:36:15.622]  They have this nature to want to control it all.
[00:36:15.622 --> 00:36:19.365]  They're like cancer.
[00:36:19.365 --> 00:36:22.928]  Bernie Sanders describes the Soviet Union honeymoon.
[00:36:22.928 --> 00:36:24.349]  Oh, it's incredible.
[00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:28.552]  There's too many choices, too much medicine, too much entertainment in America.
[00:36:28.552 --> 00:36:31.315]  There's a quote.
[00:36:31.315 --> 00:36:37.700]  I like austerity, except I got five houses, a bunch of $100,000 cars, but I'm the ruling class.
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:38.480]  I'm Bernie Sanders.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:38.981]  All right, sorry.
[00:36:39.685 --> 00:36:40.626]  The big news is coming.
[00:36:40.626 --> 00:36:47.329]  I just had to hit this bot news because... Did you hear Steven Bannon discovered a thing called fire?
[00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:47.889]  Yeah, he did.
[00:36:47.889 --> 00:36:48.810]  He's really powerful.
[00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:50.210]  But a pink-haired guy actually did it.
[00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:53.132]  He's the guy behind it all.
[00:36:53.132 --> 00:37:01.276]  Because the idea of libertarians or nationalists even getting involved in bots... Not bots to make people insecure.
[00:37:01.276 --> 00:37:04.318]  Not bots to control them like Facebook documents show they do.
[00:37:04.318 --> 00:37:08.380]  Not Zuckerberg famously saying... Pull up New York Magazine.
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:08.640]  Pull it up.
[00:37:11.878 --> 00:37:14.620]  Oh, our readers, they trust us.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:18.523]  They're dumb effers and laughing at everybody.
[00:37:18.523 --> 00:37:21.906]  And then the documents come out that it's their job to keep you depressed.
[00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:23.768]  We had the article earlier, let's throw up on screen.
[00:37:23.768 --> 00:37:26.290]  To keep you depressed, to control you.
[00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:27.731]  Yeah, embarrassing and damaging.
[00:37:27.731 --> 00:37:31.053]  Zuckerberg's IM's confirmed by Zuckerberg, the New Yorker.
[00:37:31.053 --> 00:37:32.474]  Scroll down.
[00:37:32.474 --> 00:37:35.417]  He's talking about how much he hates his users.
[00:37:37.529 --> 00:37:46.553]  Zuck, so yeah, if you ever need info about anyone in Harvard, this is just them, their own alumni out of Stockfolks, just ask.
[00:37:46.553 --> 00:37:49.494]  I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses.
[00:37:49.494 --> 00:37:50.454]  Friend, what?
[00:37:50.454 --> 00:37:51.995]  How'd you manage that one?
[00:37:51.995 --> 00:37:53.816]  People just submitted it.
[00:37:53.816 --> 00:37:56.417]  I don't know why they trust me, dumbass.
[00:37:56.417 --> 00:38:02.979]  Now, I remember eight years ago, to be on Facebook, they'd send a thing and go, are these really your friends?
[00:38:02.979 --> 00:38:04.280]  And it'd be high school photos.
[00:38:05.197 --> 00:38:08.498]  From 30 years ago, and it would do a face scan of you.
[00:38:08.498 --> 00:38:14.919]  It's getting everything, sharing it, bigger than any database, 3 billion users, totally in control.
[00:38:14.919 --> 00:38:20.981]  AI system.
[00:38:20.981 --> 00:38:25.282]  But they think you're such troglodytes.
[00:38:25.282 --> 00:38:28.942]  Like where you're showing, you know, poor pygmies have never seen technology a lighter.
[00:38:28.942 --> 00:38:30.183]  It is God.
[00:38:30.183 --> 00:38:31.043]  You know, they've got
[00:38:32.694 --> 00:38:36.115]  Flamethrowers over here, but they're like, look, Bannon made fire.
[00:38:36.115 --> 00:38:39.937]  Lookie, lookie, look at the fire.
[00:38:39.937 --> 00:38:42.358]  And everybody, woo, did you hear what Bannon did?
[00:38:42.358 --> 00:38:44.199]  And I've noticed that's a tactic they use against me.
[00:38:44.199 --> 00:38:47.260]  They'll go, Jones is a master manipulator.
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.380]  No one's better.
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:49.601]  Here's how he lies to people.
[00:38:49.601 --> 00:38:52.322]  And then they'll show made up stuff I didn't say.
[00:38:52.322 --> 00:38:56.923]  But it's this appeal to like, wow, look, he's really good at BS.
[00:38:56.923 --> 00:38:57.784]  But that's not what I've done.
[00:39:01.685 --> 00:39:06.049]  So, my point is Zuckerberg and all these big things are broke into your info.
[00:39:06.049 --> 00:39:07.050]  They're tracking everything.
[00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.172]  The appliances are watching and listening.
[00:39:09.172 --> 00:39:10.474]  Everything's a total free-for-all.
[00:39:10.474 --> 00:39:13.296]  And then there's lawsuits coming, congressional hearings.
[00:39:13.296 --> 00:39:21.824]  Steve Bannon worked with a company why up to 5 million profiles of Facebook were accessed without Facebook users' permission.
[00:39:21.824 --> 00:39:23.426]  And then people contacted them.
[00:39:23.426 --> 00:39:26.589]  It's like when they go bully the woman CNN in Florida in Broward County.
[00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:28.651]  Why?
[00:39:28.651 --> 00:39:29.972]  The Russian bots were talking.
[00:39:29.972 --> 00:39:31.993]  She goes, no, I meet with the people here locally.
[00:39:31.993 --> 00:39:33.414]  We're libertarians and conservatives.
[00:39:33.414 --> 00:39:34.235]  We like Trump.
[00:39:34.235 --> 00:39:34.695]  We talked to her.
[00:39:34.695 --> 00:39:35.215]  She's a listener.
[00:39:35.215 --> 00:39:36.316]  She didn't want to come on.
[00:39:36.316 --> 00:39:37.456]  She didn't want any more attention.
[00:39:37.456 --> 00:39:49.604]  And they bully her because they claim something connected to a Russian bot once posted a link that was sent to her.
[00:39:49.604 --> 00:39:52.185]  See how dumb they think you are?
[00:39:52.185 --> 00:39:53.486]  So this bot thing's a big deal.
[00:39:54.699 --> 00:40:01.685]  Because they've got them, they use them, they're on record rigging everything.
[00:40:01.685 --> 00:40:10.272]  And this is all going on, and now the London Guardian just told us it was invented by a guy with pink hair four years ago.
[00:40:10.272 --> 00:40:12.073]  The article says that.
[00:40:12.073 --> 00:40:16.957]  They were shutting AI robots off 20-something years ago because they didn't know what they were doing.
[00:40:16.957 --> 00:40:22.481]  They had plans for information energy, as it was called and then classified, 35, 40 years ago.
[00:40:24.002 --> 00:40:29.027]  They had everything, theoretically, in the incredible mind of humans.
[00:40:29.027 --> 00:40:30.068]  And then now it's here.
[00:40:30.068 --> 00:40:41.638]  And then again, they tell you, because they don't have a debate about how they're illegally using bots, how they're trying to make you depressed, how they're trying to rig everything, how they're rigging the debates, how they're rigging the town halls, how they're doing it all.
[00:40:41.638 --> 00:40:43.479]  No, no, no, no, no!
[00:40:43.479 --> 00:40:48.384]  If you try to harvest Facebook for five million names that you contact
[00:40:48.982 --> 00:40:54.810]  To politically be involved to be an American or to be sovereign, that's the dirtiest thing the world ever saw.
[00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:58.675]  And they talk about the guilt of the pink-haired guy.
[00:40:58.675 --> 00:41:03.741]  You know, that he did this and didn't know what he'd done, but he was such a genius.
[00:41:03.741 --> 00:41:06.205]  And I wonder if this guy even knows he's being used.
[00:41:07.796 --> 00:41:09.437]  Because I went and looked at the company records and stuff.
[00:41:09.437 --> 00:41:23.123]  This is just some programmer for just some second-rate standard, you know, contact program that goes and skims contacts, even sends somebody a damn email, and they act like this guy just discovered Valhalla in his ass at the same time.
[00:41:23.123 --> 00:41:34.629]  All right, our top story was the impending indictments of McCabe and Comey and Hillary, and how bold that is of Trump, and how are they going to strike back?
[00:41:34.629 --> 00:41:35.469]  Because that's huge news.
[00:41:35.469 --> 00:41:36.390]  We're going to get to that next.
[00:41:37.657 --> 00:41:42.958]  And so much more.
[00:41:42.958 --> 00:41:55.461]  And then it turns out the executive of that company, according to Lee Strang, and he's got the documents, turns out they sued me for claiming the CIA was involved in overthrowing governments.
[00:41:55.461 --> 00:41:56.881]  I wasn't really talking about him.
[00:41:56.881 --> 00:42:02.742]  But then it turns out the company reportedly works for Braggs, and it carries out covert CIA operations.
[00:42:02.742 --> 00:42:06.043]  I mean, not that I ever thought anybody that works for the State Department might be involved with the CIA.
[00:42:06.926 --> 00:42:16.174]  Next you're going to tell me that the sky is blue and penguins walk funny and bears take big old fat dumps in the woodlands.
[00:42:16.174 --> 00:42:18.336]  But we'll keep straight shooting you straight ahead.
[00:42:18.336 --> 00:42:18.716]  By the way,
[00:42:19.973 --> 00:42:21.694]  As you know, they're trying to shut us down.
[00:42:21.694 --> 00:42:25.515]  So when you spread the live links, you spread the articles, you're not bots, you're real people.
[00:42:25.515 --> 00:42:33.398]  When you, on your email, or in person, or whatever, on local radio, spread the word about a local station, that's what gets the word out and funds our operation.
[00:42:33.398 --> 00:42:35.178]  And that's how we reach more people.
[00:42:35.178 --> 00:42:38.199]  So, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:42:38.199 --> 00:42:42.461]  InfoWars in 2018 really is the archetypal example of human
[00:42:43.321 --> 00:42:50.647]  Brains online fighting against the globalists and seeing if we can overturn this anti-human system.
[00:42:50.647 --> 00:42:53.669]  This is the human versus AI operation.
[00:42:53.669 --> 00:42:54.329]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:54.329 --> 00:42:54.690]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.401 --> 00:43:00.181]  I'm so excited.
[00:43:00.181 --> 00:43:10.324]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:43:10.324 --> 00:43:15.825]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:43:15.825 --> 00:43:18.846]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:43:18.846 --> 00:43:27.628]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:43:29.716 --> 00:43:49.305]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:43:49.305 --> 00:43:51.986]  It is amazing!
[00:43:51.986 --> 00:43:56.948]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:43:58.783 --> 00:44:10.227]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[00:44:10.227 --> 00:44:17.730]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:27.633]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[00:44:28.113 --> 00:44:33.498]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, Floralife Everyday Maintenance.
[00:44:33.498 --> 00:44:43.426]  All of these are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[00:44:43.426 --> 00:44:49.891]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price when you purchase
[00:44:51.575 --> 00:44:58.313]  You know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our Republic and freedom worldwide.
[00:44:59.654 --> 00:45:08.376]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[00:45:08.376 --> 00:45:08.916]  That's right.
[00:45:08.916 --> 00:45:14.177]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Right's freeze dryers.
[00:45:14.177 --> 00:45:20.579]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[00:45:20.859 --> 00:45:28.440]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:28.680]  Woo!
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.721]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:45:29.721 --> 00:45:38.462]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:45:38.462 --> 00:45:46.504]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:45:48.044 --> 00:45:51.487]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[00:45:51.487 --> 00:45:55.610]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:56.671]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:45:56.671 --> 00:45:59.573]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:59.573 --> 00:46:02.376]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[00:46:02.376 --> 00:46:10.082]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with even bigger organic.
[00:46:10.542 --> 00:46:12.823]  Manufacturer and producer.
[00:46:12.823 --> 00:46:13.603]  Scalability.
[00:46:13.603 --> 00:46:18.044]  But now, we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[00:46:18.044 --> 00:46:22.885]  Because there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient, MycoZX.
[00:46:22.885 --> 00:46:24.505]  Now, it's the other side of the equation.
[00:46:24.505 --> 00:46:30.166]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because you have toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides.
[00:46:30.166 --> 00:46:33.327]  But more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace
[00:46:34.122 --> 00:46:37.183]  Yeast mold creates slime walls.
[00:46:37.183 --> 00:46:42.985]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[00:46:42.985 --> 00:46:49.428]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[00:46:49.428 --> 00:46:52.249]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[00:46:52.249 --> 00:46:57.771]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.
[00:47:03.364 --> 00:47:05.975]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:25.186 --> 00:47:31.610]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:37.053]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:37.053 --> 00:47:43.936]  Alright, we're 47 minutes into this global broadcast and I have not gotten into our top story yet.
[00:47:43.936 --> 00:47:46.938]  You know, I'm not one to hype things as the audience knows.
[00:47:46.938 --> 00:47:52.141]  I don't sit there and say indictments of Hillary are imminent, indictments of McCabe are imminent, until
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:56.441]  Our sources have told us that indeed that's where this is going.
[00:47:56.441 --> 00:48:07.883]  You've seen the evidence mount, the perjury to Congress, the fake dossiers, McCabe getting a half million from Hillary from her foundation, his wife.
[00:48:07.883 --> 00:48:13.184]  Comey testifying on May 3rd.
[00:48:13.184 --> 00:48:19.066]  They never leaked anything and now we know he's the main leaker and then later on June 8th admitting he leaked.
[00:48:19.066 --> 00:48:21.006]  Going back over a year repeatedly.
[00:48:21.835 --> 00:48:24.396]  I mean, that's all bombshell.
[00:48:24.396 --> 00:48:28.439]  But the big story is Trump's taking the gloves off.
[00:48:28.439 --> 00:48:44.328]  And I've seen the real signs of them cracking with Joy Behar and Hillary's former campaign manager and Democrat Congressman Dick Durbin going, Trump's not racist.
[00:48:44.328 --> 00:48:44.928]  The same 30% of Democrats
[00:48:48.709 --> 00:48:54.533]  That voted to put Obama over the top of the ones that voted for Trump, which is true.
[00:48:54.533 --> 00:49:03.559]  And I've got a bunch of other examples, but I watch everything and smarter Democrats who aren't even good people, but they're survivors.
[00:49:03.559 --> 00:49:06.521]  They see this as an extinction level event.
[00:49:06.521 --> 00:49:12.445]  One side says, go for broke, threaten everybody, sue everybody, overthrow the country, call for the murder of the president.
[00:49:12.445 --> 00:49:15.447]  And we've got clips of that.
[00:49:15.447 --> 00:49:18.389]  But the smart ones go, man, you've really revealed yourself.
[00:49:20.173 --> 00:49:23.956]  We should be acting like Trump to get our people in office, like happened in Pennsylvania.
[00:49:23.956 --> 00:49:26.357]  There was also election fraud now proven.
[00:49:26.357 --> 00:49:27.318]  You need to stop.
[00:49:27.318 --> 00:49:29.579]  This is crazy!
[00:49:29.579 --> 00:49:34.822]  But Clinton and her crime network are still in control.
[00:49:34.822 --> 00:49:36.603]  Thank God.
[00:49:36.603 --> 00:49:37.464]  But not thank God.
[00:49:37.464 --> 00:49:40.766]  I mean, at a Machiavellian level, I'm like, oh, thank God they're still in control.
[00:49:40.766 --> 00:49:45.789]  But I don't like seeing evil done and bad, even if it hurts the overall bad system, it's still
[00:49:47.444 --> 00:49:48.105]  Unseemly.
[00:49:48.105 --> 00:49:54.929]  Because if there's a runaway bulldozer going through houses, okay, it's going to run over the first house that has bad guys in it.
[00:49:54.929 --> 00:49:56.030]  There's a bunch of other houses.
[00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:58.872]  See, I think, like, moves ahead.
[00:49:58.872 --> 00:50:01.854]  I'm not arrogant.
[00:50:01.854 --> 00:50:05.736]  And the globalists that aren't arrogant are like, run up the white flag.
[00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:06.276]  Stop.
[00:50:06.276 --> 00:50:07.737]  Stop.
[00:50:07.737 --> 00:50:09.999]  Trump never blinks.
[00:50:09.999 --> 00:50:12.461]  He never backs down.
[00:50:12.461 --> 00:50:14.562]  He's a pragmatist.
[00:50:14.562 --> 00:50:16.043]  He's actually a libertarian liberal.
[00:50:16.989 --> 00:50:19.230]  He just has a soft spot for America.
[00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:21.110]  And they think that's mentally ill.
[00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:24.611]  To not, like, just harvest everybody and screw everybody over.
[00:50:24.611 --> 00:50:31.472]  I mean, I love Facebook explaining to folks about, oh, Bannon got 5 million of your names out of 3 billion and contacted you.
[00:50:31.472 --> 00:50:32.873]  He raped you.
[00:50:32.873 --> 00:50:36.234]  I just call you dumb ass and try to keep you depressed and rip you off.
[00:50:36.234 --> 00:50:40.235]  You know, it's like, I've done 85 billion times what he did, but I'm going to tell you how.
[00:50:40.235 --> 00:50:45.816]  It's like Hitler being the chief judge at Nuremberg and then sentencing Nazi
[00:50:47.268 --> 00:50:53.336]  Cadets to be hung.
[00:50:53.336 --> 00:51:02.829]  That's what so it's the hypocrisy and watching them have the knowledge and screw people that I want to just tell people about the trick.
[00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:03.350]  The hat trick.
[00:51:04.167 --> 00:51:08.028]  And they say I'm mentally ill because I know how the hat trick works.
[00:51:08.028 --> 00:51:09.348]  I'm like a globalist.
[00:51:09.348 --> 00:51:11.208]  But I don't use it to F people over.
[00:51:11.208 --> 00:51:12.228]  Do you understand that?
[00:51:12.228 --> 00:51:13.309]  That's what's so frustrating.
[00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:14.809]  These are bad people!
[00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:23.670]  The average leftist is a lost, bought, desperate, mentally ill, under their control, doing whatever they say, hoping they can be somebody.
[00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:26.451]  They use people!
[00:51:26.451 --> 00:51:30.472]  But I know if you use people, it comes back on you.
[00:51:30.472 --> 00:51:32.692]  I thought if we built everybody up, I would rise.
[00:51:37.051 --> 00:51:40.333]  And that's why they say I'm an arrogant, crazy person.
[00:51:40.333 --> 00:51:44.376]  Because I'm projecting my own self on the general public.
[00:51:44.376 --> 00:51:48.678]  Well, I just know this, I'm not signing on to you devil worshipper pedophiles operation.
[00:51:48.678 --> 00:51:50.619]  So, that's not gonna happen.
[00:51:50.619 --> 00:51:55.002]  And, I've told you fill your hand, you have filled it.
[00:51:55.002 --> 00:51:57.884]  And so we'll see at the end of the day what happens here.
[00:51:57.884 --> 00:52:00.566]  All I know is I gotta make a good showing in front of God.
[00:52:00.566 --> 00:52:02.827]  You people aren't in my equation.
[00:52:02.827 --> 00:52:05.949]  There's only one entity that's in my equation.
[00:52:06.866 --> 00:52:10.448]  And when I spiritually feel like I'm lined up with God, I'm fine.
[00:52:10.448 --> 00:52:13.890]  The minute I get out of alignment, that's when, that's the real torture.
[00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:16.131]  You people, see, I serve somebody.
[00:52:16.131 --> 00:52:18.393]  Like Bob Dylan said, you globalists haven't got that yet.
[00:52:18.393 --> 00:52:19.794]  I don't serve Hollywood.
[00:52:19.794 --> 00:52:20.754]  I don't serve your new order.
[00:52:20.754 --> 00:52:23.796]  I don't give a rat's butt about any of this.
[00:52:23.796 --> 00:52:28.098]  I care about lining my soul up with God and doing things that are right.
[00:52:28.098 --> 00:52:34.842]  And you think because I'm not a big narcissistic, inbred, scumbag sociopath like you that I'm weak?
[00:52:34.842 --> 00:52:35.963]  No, you're weak!
[00:52:38.158 --> 00:52:39.880]  I'm just trying to get right.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.222]  With God.
[00:52:42.222 --> 00:52:43.804]  So, I got a bunch of these clips.
[00:52:43.804 --> 00:52:47.427]  This is James Kallstrom, former deputy head of the FBI.
[00:52:47.427 --> 00:52:51.992]  Says they plotted to undermine Trump, to frame him, and to protect Hillary.
[00:52:51.992 --> 00:52:54.394]  And they perjured themselves, and it's all coming out.
[00:52:54.394 --> 00:52:58.158]  And Trump's willing to play those cards, and it's bombshell.
[00:52:58.158 --> 00:53:01.461]  And, just like Trump's deliberate on every other thing he said he'd do,
[00:53:02.365 --> 00:53:09.209]  I think we have ample facts revealed to us during this last year and a half that high-ranking people throughout the government, not just the FBI, high-ranking people had a plot
[00:53:22.253 --> 00:53:22.953]  Total phony!
[00:53:50.737 --> 00:53:53.160]  Planet phony.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.502]  And that's it.
[00:53:55.502 --> 00:53:55.902]  That's it.
[00:53:55.902 --> 00:54:00.067]  That's all they've got.
[00:54:00.067 --> 00:54:03.390]  They make it about the FBI.
[00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:05.352]  And as if you're saying the average FBI agent is bad.
[00:54:05.352 --> 00:54:07.895]  The FBI is a middle player in this.
[00:54:07.895 --> 00:54:10.978]  You've got the National Security Agency, you've got the CIA, you've got
[00:54:11.835 --> 00:54:18.137]  Defense Intelligence, you've got Director of National Intelligence, you've got all of them involved illegally spying on Trump, the campaign.
[00:54:18.137 --> 00:54:19.717]  That's totally illegal.
[00:54:19.717 --> 00:54:22.598]  Lying about what data they gain.
[00:54:22.598 --> 00:54:23.938]  Lying to Congress.
[00:54:23.938 --> 00:54:28.760]  And then they've got the FBI trying to fix the investigation to protect Hillary.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.421]  And then, oh my God, they got us with the Russians and they got us with the Chinese.
[00:54:32.421 --> 00:54:33.961]  Let's go blame it on Trump.
[00:54:33.961 --> 00:54:36.262]  I mean, that's the whole plan.
[00:54:36.262 --> 00:54:36.822]  It's crazy.
[00:54:39.227 --> 00:54:44.769]  So let's get into some of the perjury, because Trump's come out and said Comey is a perjurer, and then everybody started threatening him.
[00:54:44.769 --> 00:54:53.833]  We'll get to those clips when we get after the next segment, but here is May 3rd, Comey saying that he never supplied anybody with information.
[00:54:54.878 --> 00:54:58.499]  And then, a month later, in June 8th, he's saying he did.
[00:54:58.499 --> 00:55:03.540]  And again, they've got the recordings, they've got the files, they've got the FBI files, now they've got it all.
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:09.541]  Comey was leaking the whole time before Trump even got elected, before he was even president-elect, before he was even the nominee.
[00:55:09.541 --> 00:55:11.121]  Of course, it was illegal.
[00:55:11.121 --> 00:55:12.862]  Here it is.
[00:55:12.862 --> 00:55:24.264]  Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?
[00:55:24.264 --> 00:55:24.484]  Never.
[00:55:28.636 --> 00:55:31.337]  So, that's May 3rd.
[00:55:31.337 --> 00:55:37.858]  Let's go to June 8th, and here he is once he knows that they've already talked to the sources, FBI agents were there.
[00:55:37.858 --> 00:55:39.819]  There's a lot of FBI agents with him.
[00:55:39.819 --> 00:55:47.621]  In fact, I'm not lionizing the FBI, but it is FBI agents that have actually been the critical witnesses to Congress and the President that are about to bring all this down.
[00:55:47.621 --> 00:55:53.762]  So, once he knows the FBI agents have told the truth and blown his cover for his criminal operations, here's what he says.
[00:55:54.634 --> 00:56:04.597]  And finally, did you show copies of your memos to anyone outside of the Department of Justice?
[00:56:04.597 --> 00:56:06.277]  Yes.
[00:56:06.277 --> 00:56:08.798]  And to whom did you show copies?
[00:56:08.798 --> 00:56:15.480]  I asked, um, the President tweeted on Friday, after I got fired, that I better hope there's not tapes.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:22.202]  I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night, because it didn't dawn on me originally, that there might be corroboration for our conversation.
[00:56:22.202 --> 00:56:22.942]  There might be a tape.
[00:56:24.273 --> 00:56:27.336]  Oh, he never wrote all this down to be a fake record.
[00:56:27.336 --> 00:56:32.000]  Oh, he, he, jeepers, creepers, lordy, lordy, I'm such a good Sunday school boy.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.844]  Get in my yellow Volkswagen, I'll take care of ya.
[00:56:35.844 --> 00:56:40.528]  Lordy, lordy, I just thought, oh, I have, oh, I have the, oh, here it is.
[00:56:41.335 --> 00:56:49.658]  My judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square, and so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.
[00:56:49.658 --> 00:56:53.460]  Didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought- Hey, pause.
[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:55.260]  I didn't leak.
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:56.621]  I just gave it to somebody.
[00:56:56.621 --> 00:56:58.402]  I didn't order somebody killed.
[00:56:58.402 --> 00:56:59.782]  I just gave the order.
[00:56:59.782 --> 00:57:00.763]  I didn't kill the guy.
[00:57:00.763 --> 00:57:01.623]  I just gave the order.
[00:57:03.607 --> 00:57:04.127]  Ha!
[00:57:04.127 --> 00:57:05.988]  You just heard classic mafia.
[00:57:05.988 --> 00:57:07.028]  Let's finish.
[00:57:07.028 --> 00:57:09.609]  That might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.
[00:57:09.609 --> 00:57:11.470]  And so I asked a close friend of mine to do it.
[00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:13.430]  And was that Mr. Wittes?
[00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:14.051]  No.
[00:57:14.051 --> 00:57:14.871]  No.
[00:57:14.871 --> 00:57:16.791]  Who was that?
[00:57:16.791 --> 00:57:20.153]  A good friend of mine who's a professor at Columbia Law School.
[00:57:20.153 --> 00:57:22.834]  A good friend of mine.
[00:57:22.834 --> 00:57:26.055]  With the FBI at that level, it's all about, are you seven feet tall?
[00:57:26.055 --> 00:57:27.615]  Or do you look like you're really a good guy?
[00:57:27.615 --> 00:57:30.876]  Like, will they be stunned when we walk a seven foot tall guy in?
[00:57:30.876 --> 00:57:32.897]  It's all just, and he's just nothing but a little crook.
[00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:35.104]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:57:35.104 --> 00:57:36.266]  Spread those live links.
[00:57:36.266 --> 00:57:37.026]  Stick it in the eyes.
[00:57:37.026 --> 00:57:39.048]  Soros, Zuckerberg, and all of them.
[00:57:39.048 --> 00:57:40.410]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:40.890]  Stay with us.
[00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:41.851]  Big breaking news.
[00:57:41.851 --> 00:57:43.813]  Breaking news in the second hour.
[00:57:43.813 --> 00:57:44.474]  Stay with us.
[00:58:02.785 --> 00:58:07.769]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:58:07.769 --> 00:58:13.533]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:58:13.533 --> 00:58:18.237]  Well, we've got some incredible information about the break of the next segment.
[00:58:18.237 --> 00:58:22.920]  The arrogance of these people is only outmatched by their stupidity.
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:29.305]  So, we'll look at this riddle that all my lawyers have looked at these fake lawsuits against us, and I don't just put
[00:58:30.131 --> 00:58:31.051]  A good face on things.
[00:58:31.051 --> 00:58:32.151]  If stuff's bad, I'll tell you.
[00:58:32.151 --> 00:58:35.272]  Or I'd admit I've done something wrong.
[00:58:35.272 --> 00:58:40.293]  Top lawyers look at these lawsuits and they say, this is like a temper tantrum.
[00:58:40.293 --> 00:58:41.773]  This is not real.
[00:58:41.773 --> 00:58:44.314]  Judges will never even advance this.
[00:58:44.314 --> 00:58:48.554]  The left is acting like they're in the battle of their lives, because they are.
[00:58:48.554 --> 00:58:49.675]  And none of it matters.
[00:58:49.675 --> 00:58:56.116]  If they just grandstand and temper tantrum, it's going to get them ahead.
[00:58:59.443 --> 00:59:00.784]  Well, we'll cover it next segment.
[00:59:00.784 --> 00:59:02.926]  It's just mind-boggling.
[00:59:02.926 --> 00:59:18.941]  Now, before we go any further, you've got Trump.
[00:59:18.941 --> 00:59:24.906]  So, even though I disagree with some of the things Trump does, I can see his algorithm.
[00:59:26.138 --> 00:59:35.260]  And it's pragmatic, it's real, it's pro-prosperity, it's pro-free market, it's pro-symbiosis, it's pro-deals.
[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:37.141]  The smarts of the general public.
[00:59:37.141 --> 00:59:38.021]  Free will.
[00:59:38.021 --> 00:59:40.701]  Trump's a real free will guy.
[00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:47.103]  And I can see it, and I can see 14, 15 months into his presidency, the whole world turning around.
[00:59:47.103 --> 00:59:53.004]  And nationalism, and free market, and religious freedom, and so many good things exploding.
[00:59:53.004 --> 00:59:55.585]  And then I see the globalists panicking.
[00:59:56.909 --> 01:00:15.372]  I see them freaking out and I see them attacking myself and anybody else they see as a support mechanism for Trump because as narcissistic Satanists they believe it's Alex Jones or it's Donald Trump, this is key, who's creating all this because these idiots all think they're the center of the universe.
[01:00:15.372 --> 01:00:23.554]  They don't understand that we just metaphysically are signing on to what we already know is inherent and real and powerful and true.
[01:00:23.554 --> 01:00:24.814]  We're not the fount
[01:00:26.366 --> 01:00:35.493]  We're not the progenitor, we're not the engine, we're not the birthplace, we're not the zygote of this.
[01:00:35.493 --> 01:00:46.882]  We're simply strong nodes in that human quest for life and liberty and justice and a future.
[01:00:46.882 --> 01:00:48.724]  We're alive.
[01:00:48.724 --> 01:00:51.726]  And it's because we are alive they hate us.
[01:00:51.726 --> 01:00:53.407]  They live, we sleep.
[01:00:53.407 --> 01:00:54.508]  Well, I'm alive!
[01:00:56.423 --> 01:00:58.424]  Yeah, I'm an arrogant person, I guess.
[01:00:58.424 --> 01:01:02.985]  I don't need to see somebody else down on their luck and weak.
[01:01:02.985 --> 01:01:24.213]  I wouldn't feel good in some mountaintop chalet with 50 bedrooms and helicopters and all the best with all around me like Brazil and other areas with just people crapping on themselves and enslavement and keeping them politically suppressed so I could feel powerful by how low they were.
[01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:25.974]  And if you understand that essence,
[01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:28.151]  You understand everything.
[01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:29.492]  That's what Satanism is.
[01:01:29.492 --> 01:01:30.453]  It's all about you.
[01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:32.635]  It's all about the more selfish you are.
[01:01:32.635 --> 01:01:39.500]  If you're willing to rape a baby or slit its throat, you get all this power because you're this selfish God.
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.802]  That's a freaking joke!
[01:01:41.802 --> 01:01:47.406]  That's a cultural, planetary abortion.
[01:01:47.406 --> 01:01:50.769]  And see, to me, my life isn't about me.
[01:01:53.058 --> 01:01:56.000]  It's about my progeny and the whole continuum.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.702]  Because it is about me.
[01:01:58.702 --> 01:02:01.764]  And I realize I'm going on to the future through my progeny.
[01:02:01.764 --> 01:02:02.865]  And I'm not going to be stopped.
[01:02:02.865 --> 01:02:07.068]  And I'm not going to let a bunch of chicken crap BS globals get in the way of that.
[01:02:07.068 --> 01:02:10.591]  And if they want to fight, I'm ready for the animating contest.
[01:02:10.591 --> 01:02:16.775]  Because what they do to me only makes me stronger whether I even die in the process.
[01:02:16.775 --> 01:02:20.158]  I'll never be a piece of crap like they are.
[01:02:20.158 --> 01:02:20.318]  So.
[01:02:22.077 --> 01:02:24.698]  The whole Russiagate thing is a projection of what Hillary was.
[01:02:24.698 --> 01:02:25.678]  It's in all the documents.
[01:02:25.678 --> 01:02:28.019]  McCabe's been caught covering up Hillary's crimes.
[01:02:28.019 --> 01:02:29.020]  They've all been caught.
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.820]  And the indictments are being readied for them.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:34.322]  I can tell you now, from high-level sources, they want to fight.
[01:02:34.322 --> 01:02:34.922]  They've got one.
[01:02:34.922 --> 01:02:36.022]  They're all going to be indicted.
[01:02:36.022 --> 01:02:37.343]  They're all going to prison.
[01:02:37.343 --> 01:02:44.766]  And all the scum and all the trash that thought they had their will over America, they're about to get their asses handed to them collectively.

[01:03:57.876 --> 01:04:06.180]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:04:21.537 --> 01:04:24.198]  Alright, Lee Shranahan's a journalist that's worked for U.S.
[01:04:24.198 --> 01:04:36.223]  media, international media, you name it, citizenjournalismschool.com, thepopulous.us, and he was named last Tuesday in a lawsuit with myself, former congressman Alan West, and others.
[01:04:36.223 --> 01:04:43.126]  And I want to get into that suit, because it's not like the other millions of suits that are filed each year.
[01:04:43.126 --> 01:04:50.069]  It's in their own brief, and I've had top lawyers look at it, an attack on the First Amendment, it says we're Russian agents,
[01:04:51.335 --> 01:04:53.477]  It's just a total act of fiction.
[01:04:53.477 --> 01:04:55.578]  It's crazy.
[01:04:55.578 --> 01:05:12.454]  But also, we pointed out that Soros was involved in overthrowing Ukraine with State Department and CIA funding, and that other people that were involved covering the events in Charlottesville had worked for the State Department in clandestine positions, and that usually that means CIA, because the State Department is the CIA.
[01:05:12.454 --> 01:05:17.138]  We didn't even say that they particularly were, because they conflated in the suit what we were saying.
[01:05:18.877 --> 01:05:20.379]  But at least Ranahan did some research.
[01:05:20.379 --> 01:05:24.764]  We're going to go to it here in just a moment.
[01:05:24.764 --> 01:05:36.338]  And it turns out the company that this gentleman is at brags that it carries out CIA covert operations, which isn't hard to predict.
[01:05:36.338 --> 01:05:37.760]  But then they defame us.
[01:05:38.636 --> 01:05:48.363]  In the New York Magazine, everywhere else, saying that Stranahan and I say that this man that's suing us killed the woman run over by somebody.
[01:05:48.363 --> 01:05:49.504]  We never said that.
[01:05:49.504 --> 01:05:51.886]  My lawyers have... I spent a lot of money.
[01:05:51.886 --> 01:05:54.728]  Just a week, they've looked at all the clips.
[01:05:54.728 --> 01:05:56.149]  And they go, you never said this.
[01:05:56.149 --> 01:05:58.050]  They go, we've never seen a suit like this.
[01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:02.414]  I mean, I don't go on air and say this is a hoax suit just to say that.
[01:06:02.414 --> 01:06:04.495]  It's a hoax!
[01:06:04.495 --> 01:06:05.456]  All this stuff's a hoax.
[01:06:08.138 --> 01:06:15.804]  I had these people sue me and they go, about six months ago, I didn't realize what was going on, they go, Mr. Jones, we don't have a suit.
[01:06:15.804 --> 01:06:19.567]  How about X amount goes in your bank account and we drop it?
[01:06:19.567 --> 01:06:24.791]  My lawyers are like, this is a great deal, and I go, okay, but they were building the case.
[01:06:24.791 --> 01:06:31.136]  So the second time they filed suit, they offered me money, and it's like millions of dollars.
[01:06:31.136 --> 01:06:32.477]  I go, no, no, we're going to court.
[01:06:32.477 --> 01:06:34.379]  No, no, don't do that, don't do that!
[01:06:34.379 --> 01:06:37.221]  So it's this PR, they can put the defamation in a suit,
[01:06:39.253 --> 01:06:44.178]  Like these EEOC things, like, we saw Jones with Russian agents giving him orders.
[01:06:44.178 --> 01:06:47.461]  This is in the EEOC stuff.
[01:06:47.461 --> 01:06:50.664]  Jones was under the Russian commander's control.
[01:06:50.664 --> 01:06:52.586]  And you're like, EEOC, what the hell?
[01:06:52.586 --> 01:06:56.850]  It's like saying, Jones was with Captain Kangaroo.
[01:06:56.850 --> 01:06:57.931]  And you're like, what is this?
[01:07:02.014 --> 01:07:12.498]  And then you realize, they're just building this insanity with enough headlines, thinking the listeners are dumb, that it'll work!
[01:07:12.498 --> 01:07:30.164]  So, look, I'm a smart guy sometimes, but... So this isn't about InfoWars, it's not about Lee Strahan, it's not about Alex Jones, it's not about the Citizen Journalism School, it's about... Hillary Clinton's main lawyers on the East Coast and West Coast are suing me.
[01:07:32.032 --> 01:07:44.200]  This group, Georgetown University, the professors there were talking to the leaders of the university right now, go, we didn't know this was happening, let us fix this because no one's ever done something like this.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:53.466]  This is rogue and it shows total panicking by the criminal elements of the deep state to just make up stuff we never said or did.
[01:07:53.466 --> 01:07:55.007]  So as long as you stand behind us,
[01:07:56.383 --> 01:08:02.729]  And spread the articles, the books, the videos, as long as you buy the products, we'll make it through these fake lawsuits.
[01:08:02.729 --> 01:08:10.476]  But at the same time, the lawyers even say, we've never seen this type of craziness, so what does this signify?
[01:08:10.476 --> 01:08:22.667]  We'll get in the next segment to the documents, all the proof, what Lee Stranahan has pulled up, dealing with all this, and the groups, but again, when I said the CIA did it,
[01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:27.459]  It's edited videos of us talking about Ukraine and Soros.
[01:08:27.459 --> 01:08:42.967]  And then they mix that together with other stuff we said about you got Democratic operatives in Charlottesville when this woman gets killed, clearly being the spokespersons for the media, just like four kids out of 3,000 are with the shooting.
[01:08:42.967 --> 01:08:44.347]  We never said nobody died.
[01:08:44.347 --> 01:08:46.468]  We never said they were crisis actors.
[01:08:46.468 --> 01:08:51.791]  They say in a lawsuit we should be shut down for saying crisis actors, nobody died.
[01:08:54.028 --> 01:08:56.872]  Because you can put defamation in a lawsuit.
[01:08:56.872 --> 01:08:59.255]  So this is the deep state trying to take us down.
[01:08:59.255 --> 01:09:00.577]  And I'm not worried.
[01:09:00.577 --> 01:09:02.620]  I'm quite honored, quite frankly.
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.301]  Lee Stranahan?
[01:09:04.691 --> 01:09:22.781]  We're going to go through your exhibits in the next segment, but just looking at this, and looking at what's going on, and them suing you and I for saying this guy had a CIA connection, when we weren't even really, in most cases, talking about him, and then it looks like the connections are there.
[01:09:22.781 --> 01:09:27.564]  Again, it's like the lawyers say, this doesn't, what do you think they're thinking?
[01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:34.103]  This is clearly part of a longer play, Alex.
[01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:52.812]  What's going on here is a PR campaign that goes back, well, actually, I would say, if you look in WikiLeaks, you can see some of the seeds of this at the founding of the Tea Party, at that early time when, remember the battle over Obamacare, the early days of the Tea Party, right?
[01:09:52.812 --> 01:10:00.036]  And remember the media was accusing the Tea Party of being racist and a lot of the same things that we saw at Charlottesville.
[01:10:00.603 --> 01:10:05.146]  Well, who was one of the congressmen who was right in the middle of that controversy?
[01:10:05.146 --> 01:10:10.048]  It comes up, actually, in the WikiLeaks, Hillary Clinton emails.
[01:10:10.048 --> 01:10:15.432]  Just look up the name Tom Perriello.
[01:10:15.432 --> 01:10:24.177]  Tom Perriello is the congressman from Virginia at the time, and he's mentioned by Hillary Clinton in that email.
[01:10:24.177 --> 01:10:26.258]  And that's the guy suing his works for him.
[01:10:28.544 --> 01:10:33.288]  And that congressman gets massive, unusual Soros funding.
[01:10:33.288 --> 01:10:34.889]  Well, let's talk about that.
[01:10:34.889 --> 01:10:37.211]  Tom Perriello is key to understanding it.
[01:10:37.211 --> 01:10:46.417]  He has a deep, long relationship with Brennan Gilmore, the man who's suing you, me, Alan West, Gateway Pundit, and others, right?
[01:10:46.417 --> 01:10:51.801]  When I say a long relationship, you can find newspaper articles where they say that
[01:10:53.417 --> 01:11:04.982]  Both Perriello and Brennan Gilmore worked together like 15, about 15 years ago, could be 14, but right around 15 years ago in Sierra Leone.
[01:11:04.982 --> 01:11:13.186]  Gilmore is a long-time State Department employee, but he's also been Tom Perriello's chief of staff, so he's not a minor staffer.
[01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:14.607]  He's very tightly connected.
[01:11:14.607 --> 01:11:20.229]  He's the chief of staff of basically, I mean, Perriello looks like he's running a covert
[01:11:22.663 --> 01:11:25.324]  Sex is chief operation.
[01:11:25.324 --> 01:11:27.445]  Well, I don't... Let me explain one thing.
[01:11:27.445 --> 01:11:29.846]  Let me explain why I go over facts like this, too.
[01:11:29.846 --> 01:11:32.567]  Because this is a big deal in the lawsuit, Alex.
[01:11:32.567 --> 01:11:39.289]  The reason a reporter like me sometimes... So, like, for instance, am I saying Brennan Gilmore is a CIA agent?
[01:11:39.289 --> 01:11:41.110]  I'm not saying that at all.
[01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:42.831]  I'm not at that point yet.
[01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:46.652]  But is the State Department involved with the CIA?
[01:11:46.652 --> 01:11:49.793]  Is the companies he worked for bragging they've got CIA contracts?
[01:11:49.793 --> 01:11:51.134]  Yes, we're totally covered!
[01:11:52.426 --> 01:11:54.847]  Well, let me just say this, too.
[01:11:54.847 --> 01:12:04.652]  Part of the reason I put information out, though, is that maybe someone out there in the listening audience worked with this guy, and it becomes a tipster.
[01:12:04.652 --> 01:12:07.413]  Alex, I've done this in story after story after story.
[01:12:07.413 --> 01:12:13.296]  You get a little bit of the story out, and then people go, well, gee, this guy's a good reporter.
[01:12:13.296 --> 01:12:15.157]  He's getting the facts correct.
[01:12:15.157 --> 01:12:17.879]  Then they come to me, and they become a whistleblower.
[01:12:17.879 --> 01:12:18.679]  Does that make sense?
[01:12:19.901 --> 01:12:21.362]  Well, that's what scares them.
[01:12:21.362 --> 01:12:23.484]  So, why are they so scared about the Charlottesville?
[01:12:23.484 --> 01:12:24.224]  What do you think?
[01:12:24.224 --> 01:12:26.666]  We're going to break in a minute, but what is the end game plan?
[01:12:26.666 --> 01:12:30.809]  We'll come back and go through the documents we've got here of this being CIA connected.
[01:12:30.809 --> 01:12:32.190]  We're not saying they killed the woman.
[01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:32.871]  We never said that.
[01:12:32.871 --> 01:12:34.452]  That's all them lying, fake news.
[01:12:34.452 --> 01:12:35.633]  Yeah, never said that.
[01:12:35.633 --> 01:12:36.413]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:36.413 --> 01:12:36.914]  They don't have it.
[01:12:36.914 --> 01:12:37.654]  That's why it's a joke.
[01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:38.375]  It's a joke.
[01:12:38.375 --> 01:12:41.417]  They hope we get pissed at them and create something for the lawsuit right now.
[01:12:41.417 --> 01:12:42.038]  It's not going to happen.
[01:12:42.038 --> 01:12:44.659]  Well, we're not going to do it.
[01:12:44.659 --> 01:12:45.480]  What are they trying?
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.461]  And what is the point of this?
[01:12:47.791 --> 01:12:53.957]  Well, we'll talk about that, but this is the real danger of Soros.
[01:12:53.957 --> 01:12:55.719]  He has fooled the left.
[01:12:55.719 --> 01:12:57.801]  He has bought the left out.
[01:12:57.801 --> 01:13:03.767]  And so now, the people who were opposed to the deep state, traditionally, are all on the side of the deep state.
[01:13:03.767 --> 01:13:05.789]  We'll talk about it, Alex.
[01:13:05.789 --> 01:13:06.409]  You'll see this.
[01:13:06.409 --> 01:13:06.950]  It's stunning.
[01:13:07.904 --> 01:13:09.805]  Well, I know you're a smart guy and I respect your work.
[01:13:09.805 --> 01:13:10.665]  I've been aware of it for years.
[01:13:10.665 --> 01:13:12.646]  David and I have interviewed you probably 50 times.
[01:13:12.646 --> 01:13:14.767]  I'm just going to let you co-host.
[01:13:14.767 --> 01:13:15.448]  You know what?
[01:13:15.448 --> 01:13:19.470]  The only way I shut up is... The last two segments, I'm going to just sit here and listen to you.
[01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:26.953]  We'll do one more segment together, but I'm going to let you co-host and just take over the fourth to fifth segment of this hour to end the transmission.
[01:13:26.953 --> 01:13:30.015]  Lee Strahan straight ahead because he's dug up some amazing stuff.
[01:13:30.015 --> 01:13:30.955]  It isn't about us.
[01:13:30.955 --> 01:13:37.058]  It's about understanding the larger picture and just how crazy this is straight ahead.

[01:15:03.038 --> 01:15:03.258]  I think?
[01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:22.991]  Yeast mold creates slime walls.
[01:15:22.991 --> 01:15:28.773]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.

[01:15:55.176 --> 01:16:03.579]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:16:03.579 --> 01:16:08.200]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:29.235]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:16:29.455 --> 01:16:33.940]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:16:45.973 --> 01:16:48.196]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide, go ahead.
[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:51.042]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:16:51.042 --> 01:17:00.408]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:17:01.224 --> 01:17:08.007]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[01:17:08.007 --> 01:17:10.247]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[01:17:10.247 --> 01:17:11.308]  Thank you.
[01:17:11.308 --> 01:17:13.809]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[01:17:13.809 --> 01:17:18.110]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:21.132]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[01:17:21.132 --> 01:17:22.452]  They are quality.
[01:17:22.452 --> 01:17:24.193]  I can't wait to get some more.
[01:17:24.193 --> 01:17:27.074]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:17:27.074 --> 01:17:27.514]  Absolutely.
[01:17:28.134 --> 01:17:49.671]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:17:49.671 --> 01:17:52.313]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:02.452 --> 01:18:08.398]  The blitzkrieg of globalist disinformation just ran to a big brick wall.
[01:18:08.398 --> 01:18:19.911]  It called America and the rebirth of the Republic.
[01:18:19.911 --> 01:18:22.834]  I'm your host Alex Jones, Lee Stranahan, investigative journalist.
[01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:25.111]  He's our guest for the rest of the hour.
[01:18:25.111 --> 01:18:27.773]  I'm going to let him take over and really break all this down.
[01:18:27.773 --> 01:18:35.438]  Not just the fake lawsuits against us, but what's behind it, the upcoming indictments, which I'm confirmed are about to happen.
[01:18:35.438 --> 01:18:36.279]  So much is going on.
[01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:39.862]  But here's an example of Talking Point's memo.
[01:18:39.862 --> 01:18:42.503]  Far from a leftist site.
[01:18:42.503 --> 01:18:44.885]  And let me be sarcastic.
[01:18:44.885 --> 01:18:50.449]  And then you've got all these others saying, new lawsuit reveals challenges of taking fake news peddlers to court.
[01:18:52.085 --> 01:19:02.090]  And then it goes on to say that Brennan Gilmore, this individual from the State Department that's saying that we say he killed a woman, according to the article.
[01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:07.653]  They go on to say Jones says crisis actors staged the attack and that nothing actually happened in Florida.
[01:19:07.653 --> 01:19:08.174]  Never said that.
[01:19:08.174 --> 01:19:09.094]  There's no clip.
[01:19:09.094 --> 01:19:09.775]  There's no video.
[01:19:09.775 --> 01:19:10.435]  They just say it.
[01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:12.641]  Then it goes.
[01:19:12.641 --> 01:19:34.872]  In a complaint put together by lawyers for Georgetown Law School's Civil Rights Center, which now is anti-free speech, in federal court Tuesday, Gilmore claims false stories, saying it was part of a deep state plot to undermine the Trump administration by staging the murder of anti-racist activist Heather Heyer, who led to threats to his personal safety and caused potential damage to his career.
[01:19:34.872 --> 01:19:36.612]  So, where's the link here?
[01:19:36.612 --> 01:19:37.633]  It's funny.
[01:19:37.633 --> 01:19:39.014]  In journalism, when we say
[01:19:42.463 --> 01:19:50.245]  Bill Clinton settled a rape case, or the Pope says communism's good, or whatever it is, we link to it.
[01:19:50.245 --> 01:19:51.026]  Where is it?
[01:19:51.026 --> 01:19:53.546]  Well, it's not there.
[01:19:53.546 --> 01:20:01.429]  So that's how dumb they think you are, when they sue Jim Hoft and Ellen West, myself, at least Trant Ann, who's on this right now.
[01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:02.889]  So let's get into facts.
[01:20:02.889 --> 01:20:05.830]  He also says that we say he's CIA.
[01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:11.532]  We were talking in general about Soros and the funding of all this and State Department connections to that, but then it turns out
[01:20:13.374 --> 01:20:16.596]  You've got the organization, the group, you've done the research.
[01:20:16.596 --> 01:20:22.918]  The company he's an executive at reportedly brags of carrying out CIA contracts.
[01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:26.600]  So, Lee Stranahan, let's teach him how journalism works right now.
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:27.981]  Let's go for it.
[01:20:27.981 --> 01:20:28.401]  You got it.
[01:20:28.401 --> 01:20:33.183]  So, let me do something a little even more fundamental before we get to that, Alex.
[01:20:33.183 --> 01:20:34.584]  Real simple point.
[01:20:34.584 --> 01:20:41.287]  This lawsuit claims that due to a report, for instance, that I did on InfoWars on August 15th,
[01:20:42.751 --> 01:20:47.234]  That's an important date, that he was subject to threats.
[01:20:47.234 --> 01:20:59.821]  But in fact, in interviews that he gave with Judy Woodruff and in an article he wrote on Politico, he admitted that his own sister told him he was under threat on August 13th.
[01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:05.504]  So in other words, the threats had nothing to do with anything I said on InfoWars.
[01:21:05.504 --> 01:21:08.626]  Threats were happening two days earlier, according to the guy's story.
[01:21:08.626 --> 01:21:11.227]  If you even believe it, he's a public figure.
[01:21:11.227 --> 01:21:12.468]  Obviously, the whole thing's a joke.
[01:21:13.226 --> 01:21:14.888]  Well, this is how it rolls.
[01:21:14.888 --> 01:21:19.312]  But let's talk about the connections, because as you point out, there's two things they don't want.
[01:21:19.312 --> 01:21:30.163]  They're very upset in this suit that we tried to, they say, connect him as a CIA agent or as a Soros puppet or something like that.
[01:21:30.163 --> 01:21:31.765]  Neither of which were said.
[01:21:31.765 --> 01:21:35.329]  And about saying that he was responsible
[01:21:35.809 --> 01:21:42.274]  For Heather Heyer being killed, let me say emphatically, not only did I not say it, I don't believe it.
[01:21:42.274 --> 01:21:43.155]  Do you believe that?
[01:21:43.155 --> 01:21:47.018]  No, we're saying Soros, well they even cut off our headlines.
[01:21:47.018 --> 01:21:51.041]  They said, Soros should be indicted for staging Charlottesville chaos.
[01:21:51.041 --> 01:21:52.882]  They cut the chaos off.
[01:21:52.882 --> 01:21:56.565]  We didn't say stage Charlottesville, we're saying he funds Antifa, they're there.
[01:21:59.767 --> 01:22:01.148]  But here's the good news.
[01:22:01.148 --> 01:22:06.251]  The lawyers, I'm sure you've talked to your own, they say they've never seen such a slipshot lawsuit.
[01:22:06.251 --> 01:22:09.953]  So the question is, why are they filing these BS things?
[01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:14.130]  Well, let me say this, too.
[01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:16.912]  There's another blessing in disguise here, Alex.
[01:22:16.912 --> 01:22:21.333]  Normally, as a journalist, I don't get to question people under oath.
[01:22:21.333 --> 01:22:30.737]  But I have some questions about Charlottesville, and now, because someone sued me, I'm going to get to ask that person questions under oath.
[01:22:30.737 --> 01:22:32.077]  We're going to get the subpoena.
[01:22:32.077 --> 01:22:33.978]  He's going to get the subpoena in his bank records.
[01:22:33.978 --> 01:22:35.078]  Let's do it now.
[01:22:35.078 --> 01:22:39.740]  At the company he's an executive at, and a congressman he's the chief of staff for that say,
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.442]  They're running CIA operations.
[01:22:42.442 --> 01:22:43.603]  That's the big bombshell.
[01:22:43.603 --> 01:22:45.945]  They sue us for saying they're connected to the CIA.
[01:22:45.945 --> 01:22:47.206]  We didn't really say that.
[01:22:47.206 --> 01:22:51.269]  But now, let's get to it right now.
[01:22:51.269 --> 01:22:54.151]  So let's do that and there's no Soros connection.
[01:22:54.151 --> 01:22:55.512]  That's the two things they say.
[01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:58.195]  There's no CIA connection, no Soros connection.
[01:22:58.195 --> 01:22:59.436]  Okay, let's go over it.
[01:22:59.436 --> 01:23:02.178]  So first off, Tom Pirello, who I mentioned before,
[01:23:03.081 --> 01:23:05.123]  Remember, Brendan Gilmore is his chief of staff.
[01:23:05.123 --> 01:23:08.686]  If you look into, he ran for governor this past year.
[01:23:08.686 --> 01:23:10.467]  Didn't make it out of the primaries.
[01:23:10.467 --> 01:23:13.670]  His top funder was, drumroll, George Soros.
[01:23:13.670 --> 01:23:16.812]  That's not me saying it, that's the Washington Post reporting it.
[01:23:16.812 --> 01:23:22.176]  That's the FEC reports reporting that he was a major funder of Piriello's campaign.
[01:23:22.176 --> 01:23:23.618]  Let's start with that.
[01:23:23.618 --> 01:23:28.742]  Now, what you're talking about is something that I unveiled in the Periscope last night.
[01:23:28.742 --> 01:23:30.443]  It's that Brendan Gilmore is
[01:23:32.374 --> 01:23:37.729]  In a company, he's one of three executives in this company, right?
[01:23:38.502 --> 01:23:45.166]  And the two others, uh, I want to focus on one in particular, Dario Marquez, okay?
[01:23:45.166 --> 01:23:46.887]  Uh, there's another, uh, man.
[01:23:46.887 --> 01:23:47.988]  Tell folks the name of the company.
[01:23:47.988 --> 01:23:48.928]  It's Document Cam, guys.
[01:23:48.928 --> 01:23:50.369]  I've got the articles right here.
[01:23:50.369 --> 01:23:51.290]  It's Wise, right?
[01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:52.451]  That's them right there.
[01:23:52.451 --> 01:23:58.614]  And if you scroll, if they scroll down a little bit there, Alex, you'll see a picture of Brennan Gilmore.
[01:23:58.614 --> 01:23:59.995]  There's Mr. Marquez.
[01:23:59.995 --> 01:24:01.276]  There's Mr. Gilmore.
[01:24:01.276 --> 01:24:05.398]  This is clearly the same Brennan Gilmore who's suing us, too, right?
[01:24:05.398 --> 01:24:06.119]  Same biography.
[01:24:06.119 --> 01:24:06.559]  That's him.
[01:24:06.559 --> 01:24:08.060]  And look at the power trip right there.
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:09.941]  He's a public figure.
[01:24:09.941 --> 01:24:11.562]  He's out there.
[01:24:11.562 --> 01:24:12.483]  That's right.
[01:24:12.483 --> 01:24:16.025]  Now, let's talk about Dario Marquez.
[01:24:16.025 --> 01:24:16.926]  Couple things.
[01:24:16.926 --> 01:24:25.371]  First off, Dario Marquez is a former Secret Service agent and he formed a company called MVM.
[01:24:25.371 --> 01:24:29.634]  Now, MVM is a military contractor.
[01:24:29.634 --> 01:24:31.616]  If you look, the Wall Street Journal wrote about MVM.
[01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:37.172]  Okay, now again, this is the guy that Brennan Gilmore's in business with here.
[01:24:37.172 --> 01:24:38.472]  He had a company, MVM.
[01:24:38.472 --> 01:24:42.094]  MVM was a military contractor like Blackwater.
[01:24:42.094 --> 01:24:45.375]  That's the way the Wall Street Journal described them.
[01:24:45.375 --> 01:24:51.438]  So, I just... I mean, Blackwater is the clandestine CIA.
[01:24:51.438 --> 01:24:56.660]  Well, and in this Wall Street Journal article, you can find where Marquez admits
[01:24:57.708 --> 01:25:03.772]  Freely that the they worked for the NSA and the CIA.
[01:25:03.772 --> 01:25:06.694]  Okay, so boom.
[01:25:06.694 --> 01:25:14.019]  Our boy is one of the top three executives of the company that's in the Wall Street Journal saying they carry out CIA contracts and we're not mean pencil pushing here.
[01:25:14.019 --> 01:25:15.520]  We mean military contractor.
[01:25:16.477 --> 01:25:18.559]  Military contractor like Blackwater.
[01:25:18.559 --> 01:25:19.720]  That's the way they're defined.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:25.764]  So let's just stop for a second and talk about... We're being sued saying the guy's CIA connected.
[01:25:25.764 --> 01:25:27.165]  We didn't even say that.
[01:25:27.165 --> 01:25:30.708]  And now he's an executive of the company that brags in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:25:30.708 --> 01:25:32.449]  They're not just CIA.
[01:25:32.449 --> 01:25:35.551]  They're running muscle operations.
[01:25:35.551 --> 01:25:36.972]  And for the NSA in Iraq.
[01:25:36.972 --> 01:25:37.413]  It's right there.
[01:25:41.633 --> 01:25:43.633]  Let's talk about Tom Fiorello for a second.
[01:25:43.633 --> 01:25:49.294]  Tom Fiorello is known as the sort of liberal's liberal on the left, okay?
[01:25:49.294 --> 01:25:57.376]  The reason Soros funded him is he's a guy who got the endorsement of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, right?
[01:25:57.376 --> 01:26:04.017]  Now, traditionally, when you think about people like Bernie Sanders, they're anti-war, right?
[01:26:04.017 --> 01:26:07.338]  That's the way we think of the left.
[01:26:07.338 --> 01:26:08.958]  I want to point out what's happened here.
[01:26:10.327 --> 01:26:14.032]  There's a reason Soros is funding a guy like Pierello.
[01:26:14.032 --> 01:26:14.973]  There's a reason for it.
[01:26:22.393 --> 01:26:27.078]  I mean, wow, these guys, the arrogance, the insolence.
[01:26:27.078 --> 01:26:28.499]  But here's the deal.
[01:26:28.499 --> 01:26:33.484]  McCabe, all the globalists, all these parasites that have hijacked the country, your time is coming.
[01:26:33.484 --> 01:26:36.627]  And no matter what happens, know that scumbags, we're coming for you.
[01:26:36.627 --> 01:26:39.430]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:41.272]  The Second American Revolution is now.
[01:26:41.272 --> 01:26:43.394]  Spread those links and defeat the globalists.
[01:26:45.811 --> 01:26:48.835]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[01:26:48.835 --> 01:26:53.040]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:59.729]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:26:59.729 --> 01:27:03.514]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:27:04.194 --> 01:27:18.070]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding.
[01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:23.696]  Until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:27:24.256 --> 01:27:28.379]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:27:28.379 --> 01:27:39.607]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:27:39.607 --> 01:27:44.731]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[01:27:46.374 --> 01:27:47.315]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:27:47.315 --> 01:27:47.875]  Good, brother.
[01:27:47.875 --> 01:27:49.816]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:27:49.816 --> 01:27:51.537]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:27:51.537 --> 01:27:55.599]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:27:55.599 --> 01:27:56.339]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:27:56.339 --> 01:28:00.622]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:28:00.622 --> 01:28:08.566]  Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:28:08.766 --> 01:28:12.027]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:28:12.027 --> 01:28:13.548]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:28:13.548 --> 01:28:16.489]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:28:16.489 --> 01:28:18.250]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:28:18.250 --> 01:28:20.991]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[01:28:20.991 --> 01:28:24.052]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[01:28:24.332 --> 01:28:26.094]  Or maximum potency.
[01:28:26.094 --> 01:28:36.324]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going, goes right to the source.
[01:28:36.324 --> 01:28:38.106]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:28:38.106 --> 01:28:45.053]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.

[01:28:58.805 --> 01:29:01.669]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:03.170]  It's made in the USA.
[01:29:03.170 --> 01:29:05.913]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that
[01:29:05.913 --> 01:29:09.974]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:29:09.974 --> 01:29:12.054]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:29:12.054 --> 01:29:21.756]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[01:29:43.466 --> 01:29:44.166]  With a Z-Shield.

[01:29:45.908 --> 01:29:49.931]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years?
[01:29:51.332 --> 01:29:54.636]  And still maintain its nutrition and flavor.
[01:29:54.636 --> 01:29:55.156]  That's right.
[01:29:55.156 --> 01:30:00.421]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Right's freeze dryers.

[01:30:14.672 --> 01:30:14.932]  Woo!
[01:30:14.932 --> 01:30:15.952]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:30:15.952 --> 01:30:24.696]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:30:24.696 --> 01:30:32.800]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:30:34.281 --> 01:30:37.724]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:30:37.724 --> 01:30:41.848]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:30:41.848 --> 01:30:42.908]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:30:42.908 --> 01:30:49.614]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:49.614 --> 01:30:52.276]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:07.478 --> 01:31:10.519]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:31:10.519 --> 01:31:12.179]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:12.179 --> 01:31:16.000]  Alright, I want Lee to be able to roll this out in this segment and the next.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.861]  I'm just going to sit back and listen to what he has to say here.
[01:31:17.861 --> 01:31:18.961]  I'm going to punch you out in a minute.
[01:31:18.961 --> 01:31:20.482]  Just sit back here.
[01:31:20.482 --> 01:31:24.963]  But, let me just say it from the heart.
[01:31:24.963 --> 01:31:33.165]  I fight the globalists so hard because they're so anti-human, they're so evil, they're such liars, they're such scumbags, they're such pieces of crap.
[01:31:33.797 --> 01:31:35.517]  From the chicken, you know what, dimension.
[01:31:35.517 --> 01:31:39.638]  You know the chicken, S-H, what, T, dimension.
[01:31:39.638 --> 01:31:40.458]  That's how I'll describe it.
[01:31:40.458 --> 01:31:42.419]  They're just these jerks.
[01:31:42.419 --> 01:31:46.720]  They don't play by the rules, they don't care about basic humanity.
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:54.682]  An example is, my daughters were with their mom last week, up in Connecticut, skiing, which is great.
[01:31:54.682 --> 01:32:01.043]  And they called me this morning and they said, yeah, my middle daughter was talking to some kids they were with at ski camp,
[01:32:02.063 --> 01:32:07.806]  And who their dad was, and then the dad walked over and yelled and screamed at my daughter.
[01:32:07.806 --> 01:32:12.029]  I mean, the left involves children in things.
[01:32:12.029 --> 01:32:13.569]  The Antifa beats up women.
[01:32:13.569 --> 01:32:15.150]  They just, they have no rules.
[01:32:15.150 --> 01:32:20.793]  They're scum, and they're all about guilt, though, and how they're good.
[01:32:20.793 --> 01:32:29.538]  So, I look at all this, and I pull back from it, and I want to ask Lee Stranahan this, and I'm going to punch out and let him take over.
[01:32:31.466 --> 01:32:54.320]  Why would you have a guy, State Department, who videotapes this woman getting run over, come out and file a lawsuit saying we said he killed the woman, when there's no video of that, we never said that, there's no audio, and then he heads up a company that brags in the Wall Street Journal they've got CIA contracts, we should show that to TV viewers, I can go over the headlines if folks want it.
[01:32:55.035 --> 01:32:58.196]  Iraq case sheds light on secret contractors.
[01:32:58.196 --> 01:33:02.137]  I mean, this guy's company's in secret contractor articles.
[01:33:02.137 --> 01:33:07.519]  We're not just talking about CIA analytics or, you know, some little sub.
[01:33:07.519 --> 01:33:10.740]  I mean, this is like the teeth of the CIA and all the articles.
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:15.642]  Airbnb hosts white nationalists and all of it.
[01:33:15.642 --> 01:33:20.163]  My lawyers look at this and they go, this is desperate temper tantruming.
[01:33:20.163 --> 01:33:22.424]  It doesn't mean we don't have to fund the lawsuits and deal with it.
[01:33:22.424 --> 01:33:23.244]  It just means, like,
[01:33:25.183 --> 01:33:27.787]  What's the motive of these guys?
[01:33:27.787 --> 01:33:30.270]  What's their problem, Lee?
[01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:30.911]  You're a smart guy.
[01:33:30.911 --> 01:33:37.559]  You don't speculate as a journalist, but as a personal guy being sued, they know they've got these contracts.
[01:33:37.559 --> 01:33:42.085]  We're talking about Soros and the CIA.
[01:33:42.085 --> 01:33:42.926]  I think they're saying,
[01:33:43.675 --> 01:33:46.516]  Well, there's events like this and we put a narrative out.
[01:33:46.516 --> 01:33:48.177]  We're not saying they're staging the event.
[01:33:48.177 --> 01:33:49.438]  They put their narrative out.
[01:33:49.438 --> 01:33:50.818]  Stay out of our narrative.
[01:33:50.818 --> 01:34:01.423]  That's what they're pissed about is that we're there talking about the narrative, saying, hey, let's ask questions, whether it's Charlottesville or whether it's Lakewood or Parkview or whatever the hell it is.
[01:34:01.423 --> 01:34:04.704]  They just don't like us questioning the narrative.
[01:34:04.704 --> 01:34:10.647]  I think that's it, that they're mad that we're just questioning things, not even saying what we know.
[01:34:10.647 --> 01:34:12.388]  What's got them so mad?
[01:34:12.388 --> 01:34:13.008]  Go ahead and take over.
[01:34:14.344 --> 01:34:27.813]  Well, I think what got them so mad is that Charlottesville, in some ways, was the culmination of the Black Lives Matter movement, that they had put a lot of money and effort into.
[01:34:27.813 --> 01:34:28.333]  Exactly.
[01:34:28.333 --> 01:34:34.937]  They're pissed that it blew up in their face, and then a month later, Pelosi's saying Black Lives Matter and Antifa's terrorists.
[01:34:34.937 --> 01:34:37.759]  Yes, and... So it's a failed project.
[01:34:37.759 --> 01:34:38.700]  It's a failed project.
[01:34:40.006 --> 01:34:43.848]  Well, in some ways, and Trump's election proved a failure.
[01:34:43.848 --> 01:34:50.810]  In other words, the way it really failed was it failed to stop everything they threw at him.
[01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:53.351]  The people still were like, you know what?
[01:34:53.351 --> 01:34:55.792]  I trust Trump over Hillary Clinton.
[01:34:55.792 --> 01:34:56.813]  That's it.
[01:34:56.813 --> 01:34:58.613]  And they were very upset.
[01:34:58.613 --> 01:35:00.334]  And has he not fulfilled that trust?
[01:35:00.334 --> 01:35:02.395]  What are they going to do now?
[01:35:02.395 --> 01:35:04.255]  Well, yeah, that's right.
[01:35:04.255 --> 01:35:05.736]  Well, here's what's very interesting.
[01:35:06.477 --> 01:35:15.161]  And I know it's weird to think about this, but I think the left is being victimized by George Soros.
[01:35:15.161 --> 01:35:22.223]  Soros has figured out how to use the left to promote an agenda that is really the antithesis.
[01:35:22.223 --> 01:35:24.464]  So is George Soros a leftist?
[01:35:24.464 --> 01:35:25.205]  Yes or no?
[01:35:25.205 --> 01:35:26.825]  Clearly he's a leftist.
[01:35:26.825 --> 01:35:28.326]  Is he a greedy capitalist?
[01:35:29.244 --> 01:35:31.205]  Clearly yes, right?
[01:35:31.205 --> 01:35:37.427]  And that's kind of a weird contradiction, but let's talk about... I want to correct one thing.
[01:35:37.427 --> 01:35:49.091]  The guy who's suing us, Brennan Gilmore, he's an executive in a company where the founder of the company's other company is the one who is connected to the CIA.
[01:35:49.091 --> 01:35:49.951]  Sure, sure, exactly.
[01:35:49.951 --> 01:35:53.252]  He works with the guy that created the clandestine operation group.
[01:35:53.252 --> 01:35:54.812]  We're not even saying he's CIA.
[01:35:54.812 --> 01:35:55.933]  We're just saying CIA...
[01:35:57.153 --> 01:36:08.481]  But this company itself may or may not be connected because it's the same guy who owns both of them and Gilmore's with one of those companies.
[01:36:08.481 --> 01:36:11.963]  But I just want to clarify that there are two different companies here.
[01:36:11.963 --> 01:36:12.744]  That being said.
[01:36:13.619 --> 01:36:19.481]  Does this mean that there's a CIA involvement that Brennan Gilmore has?
[01:36:19.481 --> 01:36:20.522]  I'm not saying that.
[01:36:20.522 --> 01:36:22.062]  And if I thought that, I would tell you.
[01:36:22.062 --> 01:36:23.263]  Let me give you another scenario.
[01:36:23.263 --> 01:36:25.124]  Let me give you another possibility.
[01:36:25.124 --> 01:36:27.085]  Maybe it's just a political connection.
[01:36:27.085 --> 01:36:27.885]  Why do I say that?
[01:36:27.885 --> 01:36:34.908]  Well, that's all we said was you keep getting politicos at these events like the, you know, the kids that are anti-gun on the 3000, they get all the coverage.
[01:36:34.908 --> 01:36:35.508]  That's what we said.
[01:36:37.216 --> 01:36:42.159]  And, well, what I said, no, right, and what I said also was, I don't know what's going on.
[01:36:42.159 --> 01:36:43.740]  I'm just trying to piece it out.
[01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:44.421]  Here's what we know.
[01:36:44.421 --> 01:36:46.522]  Let's talk about this guy, Dario Marquez.
[01:36:46.522 --> 01:36:51.406]  Now, again, he's the guy whose company was a Blackwater-style military contractor.
[01:36:51.406 --> 01:37:03.594]  Dario Marquez also happened to be a top donor to a PAC that was headed up by, drumroll please, Tom Perriello, Brennan Gilmore's close
[01:37:04.344 --> 01:37:05.244]  Work associate.
[01:37:05.244 --> 01:37:07.305]  Yeah, he's chief of staff of that, exactly.
[01:37:07.305 --> 01:37:07.905]  Right?
[01:37:07.905 --> 01:37:12.087]  So, Perriello had a PAC called WinVirginia.
[01:37:12.087 --> 01:37:17.108]  Now, it was supposed to be a pro-progressive PAC, okay?
[01:37:17.108 --> 01:37:31.793]  And if you look at the fundraising for that PAC, you will see that Dario Marquez, who's the same guy who's partnered with Brennan Gilmore in this other company, Dario Marquez was also a major donor
[01:37:33.061 --> 01:37:36.787]  Uh, to this Tom Ferriello headed PAC.
[01:37:36.787 --> 01:37:37.928]  You with me there?
[01:37:37.928 --> 01:37:46.501]  So, this is important because it just shows that there's another connection here, not military, not deep state, but political.
[01:37:47.242 --> 01:37:49.503]  And that very well could be what was going on.
[01:37:49.503 --> 01:37:52.964]  It could also be a personal connection.
[01:37:52.964 --> 01:37:55.665]  But let's be clear, not a correction, a clarification.
[01:37:55.665 --> 01:37:57.365]  We're not saying a woman wasn't run over.
[01:37:57.365 --> 01:38:02.387]  We're not saying this Brandon guy, you know, did this.
[01:38:02.387 --> 01:38:11.470]  What we're saying is that you've got politicos at these events, obviously in an anti-fascist rally, that are the spokespersons exacerbating it, saying Trump's Hitler.
[01:38:13.298 --> 01:38:14.500]  Exactly right.
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:19.585]  And I keep seeing Soros connections everywhere here.
[01:38:19.585 --> 01:38:24.490]  That's what I'm asking you is then, and here to take over the next segment.
[01:38:24.490 --> 01:38:26.312]  What do they think they're getting out of it?
[01:38:26.312 --> 01:38:29.495]  My lawyers just think it's the PR stunt of the lawsuit.
[01:38:29.495 --> 01:38:32.599]  And then they don't care if it gets defeated because they say there's no way this goes forward.
[01:38:32.599 --> 01:38:33.680]  This is like crap.
[01:38:34.835 --> 01:38:36.896]  Well, this is one of the points I've been making, Alex.
[01:38:36.896 --> 01:38:41.917]  If you want to really get to the motivation here, I think there's something very sneaky going on.
[01:38:41.917 --> 01:38:43.078]  Here's what it is.
[01:38:43.078 --> 01:38:49.640]  Traditionally in this country, when we think of people fighting for free speech, we think of the left, right?
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:55.101]  If you think about the 50s and 60s and... Sure, so it's the left trying to eviscerate free speech.
[01:38:55.101 --> 01:38:55.881]  That's right.
[01:38:55.881 --> 01:39:01.083]  Now, if you think about who's the anti-war movement in this country, traditionally, it's the left.
[01:39:02.094 --> 01:39:10.685]  What they're doing here, what Soros is buying for his money... No, like you said, he's getting the left to be pro-war, pro-censorship.
[01:39:10.685 --> 01:39:11.666]  They're killing the left!
[01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:13.990]  That's exactly right.
[01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:19.251]  And if you look around, usually the ACLU would be taking the side.
[01:39:19.251 --> 01:39:24.452]  Look, I remember the Illinois Nazis back in the 80s, when I was growing up.
[01:39:24.452 --> 01:39:25.372]  80s, 90s.
[01:39:25.372 --> 01:39:27.673]  And ACLU came out to defend them.
[01:39:27.673 --> 01:39:30.793]  Here, the ACLU is at a cut tail and run.
[01:39:30.793 --> 01:39:33.394]  And the reason why is Soros spreads his checks around.
[01:39:33.394 --> 01:39:34.814]  That's not a conspiracy theory.
[01:39:34.814 --> 01:39:37.054]  He funds out billions of dollars.
[01:39:37.054 --> 01:39:39.275]  He funds out every damn group you can imagine.
[01:39:39.275 --> 01:39:39.755]  That's right.
[01:39:41.158 --> 01:39:43.700]  That's what I think is going on here.
[01:39:43.700 --> 01:40:03.474]  When I looked into the groups, the Civil Rights Unit, who's suing us, and the Voting Rights Institute at Georgetown, every member of their advisory board for Voting Rights Institute, all 12 people, were directly working with organizations that are directly funded by George Soros' Open Society.
[01:40:03.474 --> 01:40:04.515]  Every single one of them.
[01:40:04.515 --> 01:40:05.736]  It's incredible!
[01:40:05.736 --> 01:40:08.418]  This guy thought he was the Messiah 30 years ago when he wrote a book.
[01:40:08.996 --> 01:40:11.778]  But in a way, he kind of is the messiah of evil.
[01:40:11.778 --> 01:40:14.340]  I mean, he's like the devil's messiah.
[01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:17.182]  It's just like, how could one guy be involved in so much evil?
[01:40:17.182 --> 01:40:18.944]  Well, he's overthrown a bunch of countries.
[01:40:18.944 --> 01:40:20.085]  He's swindled so much money.
[01:40:20.085 --> 01:40:21.586]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:40:21.586 --> 01:40:23.767]  All right, Lee Stranahan, you're doing the final segment.
[01:40:23.767 --> 01:40:24.188]  I'm leaving.
[01:40:24.188 --> 01:40:25.569]  So you intro it, you outro it.
[01:40:25.569 --> 01:40:26.069]  Great points.
[01:40:28.072 --> 01:40:30.634]  Wow, ladies and gentlemen, this is incredible.
[01:40:30.634 --> 01:40:32.935]  I mean, this is the battle for the Republic.
[01:40:32.935 --> 01:40:33.755]  Front row seats.

[01:41:50.877 --> 01:41:53.740]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:55.702]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:41:55.702 --> 01:42:00.728]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:42:00.728 --> 01:42:01.729]  Research across the
[01:42:01.749 --> 01:42:02.810]  The board is clear.
[01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:04.091]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:42:04.091 --> 01:42:09.215]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:42:09.215 --> 01:42:16.100]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:18.962]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:42:19.082 --> 01:42:22.785]  It's loaded with good halogen iodides of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:42:22.785 --> 01:42:29.690]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.

[01:42:55.452 --> 01:43:03.878]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:43:03.878 --> 01:43:08.521]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:43:52.793 --> 01:43:57.158]  This powerful combo is perfect for supporting your thyroid and health.
[01:43:57.158 --> 01:44:02.544]  BioTrue Selenium's formula is far from synthetic and is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[01:44:04.426 --> 01:44:13.075]  Our super high quality nascent iodine is an essential mineral sourced of 99.99% ultra pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[01:44:13.075 --> 01:44:20.863]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue, and organ in the body.
[01:44:20.863 --> 01:44:27.730]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain, and overall brain fog.
[01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:29.631]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:45:06.966 --> 01:45:17.614]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[01:45:17.614 --> 01:45:24.419]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:45:29.622 --> 01:45:30.302]  Hey there, everybody.
[01:45:30.302 --> 01:45:34.825]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show here at InfoWars.com.
[01:45:34.825 --> 01:45:35.965]  My name is Lee Stranahan.
[01:45:35.965 --> 01:45:38.046]  I'm an investigative reporter.
[01:45:38.046 --> 01:45:42.008]  And I want to thank Alex for trusting me to do this last segment.
[01:45:42.008 --> 01:45:54.614]  We're talking about the lawsuit that was filed this past Tuesday against Alex Jones and InfoWars, against me, against Jim Hoff, my friend over at the Gateway Pundit, Alan West, and other people.
[01:45:54.614 --> 01:45:58.136]  And this lawsuit was filed by a man named Brennan Gilmore.
[01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:01.905]  And Brennan is a State Department employee.
[01:46:01.905 --> 01:46:09.481]  He's a political Democratic chief of staff person for Tom Perriello, who's a congressman in Virginia.
[01:46:10.294 --> 01:46:27.321]  And Mr. Gilmore is also the person who happened to videotape the best shot of the car crashing into the crowd of people back in August, back on August 12th of last year in Charlottesville, killing Heather Heyer, murdering her.
[01:46:27.321 --> 01:46:33.264]  And I did a segment last year on August 15th, a few days after this,
[01:46:33.982 --> 01:46:49.708]  Where I was interviewed, and I talked about some things, and I mentioned the fact that Brennan Gilmore, who shot that video, works for the, works for the State Department, forgive me, and I mentioned that he worked for Tom Perriello.
[01:46:49.708 --> 01:46:51.829]  I did not say he worked for the CIA.
[01:46:51.829 --> 01:46:57.011]  I don't believe he works for the CIA, because I have no proof that he works for the CIA.
[01:46:57.011 --> 01:47:01.612]  I don't believe he was responsible for engineering Heather Heyer's death.
[01:47:01.612 --> 01:47:03.333]  That would be a horrible accusation to make.
[01:47:04.039 --> 01:47:06.700]  I didn't say it because I don't believe it.
[01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:13.004]  What I did say was that he worked for the State Department, he worked for Tom Perriello, and that's why I'm being sued.
[01:47:13.004 --> 01:47:18.266]  And literally, if you read the lawsuit itself, that's why I'm being sued.
[01:47:18.266 --> 01:47:32.774]  So, one of the reasons I'm actually happy that Alex Jones is my co-defendant, and Alex may not want to hear this, but I'm happy to have Alex as a co-defendant, because Alex is one of the few people out there in the media who
[01:47:33.698 --> 01:47:38.204]  When he gets hit with a lawsuit like this, he doesn't cower.
[01:47:38.204 --> 01:47:40.888]  He doesn't hide under the bed.
[01:47:40.888 --> 01:47:45.394]  And my mentor Andrew Breitbart was a little bit like that as well.
[01:47:45.394 --> 01:47:48.818]  And that's why, you know, I like someone with some fight in them.
[01:47:48.818 --> 01:47:49.900]  And I got the same fight.
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:53.342]  Myself and Jim Hoft over at Gateway Pundit.
[01:47:53.342 --> 01:47:54.442]  Same way.
[01:47:54.442 --> 01:47:59.725]  So I've said this before, but Brennan Gilmore, you picked the wrong people to sue.
[01:47:59.725 --> 01:48:00.726]  Sorry, Brennan.
[01:48:00.726 --> 01:48:02.387]  You picked the wrong people to sue.
[01:48:02.387 --> 01:48:11.612]  If you were counting on us shutting up, and with the audience that Jim has and that Alex has, this is a lot of people you're trying to shut up.
[01:48:12.558 --> 01:48:13.639]  I know you're a musician.
[01:48:13.639 --> 01:48:15.480]  I know you play bluegrass.
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:18.623]  I suggest you look into the Streisand effect.
[01:48:18.623 --> 01:48:25.849]  Anyone can look that up and you'll see that's the effect where Barbara Streisand sued some people who took a helicopter picture of her estate.
[01:48:25.849 --> 01:48:28.751]  And so what happened was everybody published the picture.
[01:48:28.751 --> 01:48:30.312]  That's called the Streisand effect.
[01:48:30.312 --> 01:48:31.293]  And Mr. Gilmore
[01:48:33.135 --> 01:48:39.177]  You're going to get it because your suit is an affront to anyone who believes in the First Amendment.
[01:48:39.177 --> 01:48:48.641]  You can't sue somebody for telling the truth just because you think one possible interpretation is that you work for the CIA.
[01:48:49.818 --> 01:48:52.380]  Let's talk about some other political connections.
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:49:01.545]  And by the way, I challenge anybody, just follow along with the facts, look up what I'm about to show you, and you'll find another interesting connection to Charlottesville.
[01:49:01.545 --> 01:49:02.725]  What does this mean?
[01:49:02.725 --> 01:49:05.367]  I don't know, but let's go ahead and take a look.
[01:49:05.367 --> 01:49:12.351]  So, I mentioned in the last segment that Tom Perriello has a PAC called WinVirginia.
[01:49:13.132 --> 01:49:18.095]  Now remember, Brendan Gilmore has worked closely with Tom Perriello as the Chief of Staff.
[01:49:18.095 --> 01:49:29.520]  This WinVirginia PAC, if you look at the fundraising numbers, the donors, you'll see the one big donor there is Dario Marquez, who I mentioned earlier.
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:39.005]  But if you look at the top donor, I believe you'll see the very two top donors are Reid Hoffman and Technology for Democracy, LLC.
[01:49:42.034 --> 01:49:46.576]  Technology for Democracy LLC is effectively Reid Hoffman.
[01:49:46.576 --> 01:49:47.656]  So who's Reid Hoffman?
[01:49:47.656 --> 01:49:51.618]  This big donor of the PAC here that Perriello is the head of?
[01:49:51.618 --> 01:49:56.920]  Reid Hoffman is a big angel investor in Silicon Valley.
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:03.342]  Perhaps you've heard of one of his things, which is LinkedIn, the big social media site for business people.
[01:50:03.342 --> 01:50:05.103]  He's the guy behind that.
[01:50:05.103 --> 01:50:09.765]  He's also one of the first investors and is still on the board of Airbnb.
[01:50:10.839 --> 01:50:11.919]  You with me?
[01:50:11.919 --> 01:50:14.620]  Airbnb, that's who Reid Hoffman is.
[01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:17.942]  Now, why do I mention Airbnb?
[01:50:17.942 --> 01:50:26.645]  If you look back to the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally that was the center of all this, remember that happened on August 12th.
[01:50:26.645 --> 01:50:28.825]  It began on August 11th.
[01:50:28.825 --> 01:50:39.109]  But if you go back to about August 8th, three days before the rally, there was already a story that Airbnb, the same company that Reid Hoffman
[01:50:39.818 --> 01:50:46.180]  Tom Perriello's big donor at his Win Virginia PAC, right?
[01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:56.463]  You'll see that Airbnb, that company, made headlines across the country by saying that they had cancelled the memberships of people at the Unite the Right rally.
[01:50:56.463 --> 01:50:58.804]  Now, I don't know if you're like me.
[01:50:59.898 --> 01:51:04.480]  My friends on the right didn't know anything about the Unite Right, the Right Rally.
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:12.363]  In other words, the people I know who read Infowars, Breitbart, Daily Caller, and so on, the people on the right were not thinking about this.
[01:51:12.363 --> 01:51:16.905]  Remember, this was like 200 largely white nationalists.
[01:51:16.905 --> 01:51:17.485]  That's who was there.
[01:51:17.485 --> 01:51:19.586]  About two, three hundred people.
[01:51:19.586 --> 01:51:21.787]  Not a big, well-attended event.
[01:51:21.787 --> 01:51:24.208]  This was not like a Tea Party rally.
[01:51:24.208 --> 01:51:24.908]  So what happened?
[01:51:26.181 --> 01:51:29.642]  Stories like this set a media narrative.
[01:51:29.642 --> 01:51:34.304]  Oh, Airbnb pulled out.
[01:51:34.304 --> 01:51:38.885]  It was making things more difficult for the people showing up to the rally.
[01:51:38.885 --> 01:51:43.487]  So here's a question I have.
[01:51:43.487 --> 01:51:49.609]  Did Reid Hoffman at Airbnb get the heads up from Tom Perriello?
[01:51:50.467 --> 01:51:52.689]  Does he know Brendan Gilmore?
[01:51:52.689 --> 01:51:53.890]  A Brendan Gilmore.
[01:51:53.890 --> 01:51:54.851]  Reid Hoffman.
[01:51:54.851 --> 01:51:56.612]  I assume he does.
[01:51:56.612 --> 01:51:57.773]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:51:57.773 --> 01:51:59.995]  But here's the beautiful thing about it right now.
[01:51:59.995 --> 01:52:01.957]  They picked the wrong people to sue.
[01:52:01.957 --> 01:52:08.022]  Because now what I get to do, since they sued me, is I get to get Brendan Gilmore in a deposition.
[01:52:08.022 --> 01:52:13.827]  And while I'm at it, I think I probably need to depose his business partner, David Marquez,
[01:52:14.207 --> 01:52:20.934]  I should probably also depose Reid Hoffman, because he has a clear connection to the Charlottesville thing.
[01:52:20.934 --> 01:52:27.040]  I don't know what it means, but now they can't duck my phone calls, they can't avoid my emails.
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:29.182]  As a reporter, I'm used to that.
[01:52:29.182 --> 01:52:34.928]  Now they have to sit in a chair while I, or someone representing me, or better yet,
[01:52:35.675 --> 01:52:36.816]  Alex Jones.
[01:52:36.816 --> 01:52:37.997]  Just picture that.
[01:52:37.997 --> 01:52:45.424]  Picture them under the bright deposition lights getting a few questions from Alex about what their role is and about what they were doing.
[01:52:45.424 --> 01:52:49.107]  That is an episode you're not going to want to miss.
[01:52:49.107 --> 01:52:52.490]  Now, again, I don't think they realized what they were doing.
[01:52:52.490 --> 01:52:55.533]  I'm not saying I know what was going on.
[01:52:55.533 --> 01:52:58.876]  The thing that drives me as a reporter is curiosity.
[01:52:58.876 --> 01:53:01.238]  But I'm saying you can look it up yourself.
[01:53:01.238 --> 01:53:01.939]  When Virginia
[01:53:02.967 --> 01:53:04.589]  Biggest donor, Reid Hoffman.
[01:53:04.589 --> 01:53:06.490]  Oh, and one other thing.
[01:53:06.490 --> 01:53:19.102]  While you're looking that up, look into a CIA tech company, an incubator, if you will, called IntelliQ.
[01:53:19.102 --> 01:53:23.566]  And if you look it up, you'll see that another investment company, the Reid Hoffman,
[01:53:24.395 --> 01:53:28.657]  Has something to do with, called Greyhawk, also has something to do with IntelliCue.
[01:53:28.657 --> 01:53:30.958]  So that's another thing you can look up yourself.
[01:53:30.958 --> 01:53:35.260]  Again, this is, I'm pointing this out not because I think it means anything.
[01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:38.342]  If I knew what it meant, I'd just tell you that.
[01:53:38.342 --> 01:53:43.284]  I'm pointing it out because as you start to lay out the beats of a story, it gets very, very interesting.
[01:53:43.284 --> 01:53:45.025]  Now, I'm going to mention one other thing.
[01:53:45.025 --> 01:53:49.507]  We mentioned in the last segment that Brennan Gilmore is in a company
[01:53:50.417 --> 01:53:54.839]  With this guy, Dario Marquez from MVM, okay?
[01:53:54.839 --> 01:54:01.082]  Now, the other person who's in that company is a man named Michael Titmas.
[01:54:01.082 --> 01:54:11.608]  And Michael Titmas has also been involved in companies that were directly involved with the NSA and the CIA, according to a filing that they did.
[01:54:11.608 --> 01:54:14.109]  So it's not just one of the partners in the company.
[01:54:15.433 --> 01:54:17.874]  That has a CIA, NSA connection.
[01:54:17.874 --> 01:54:20.634]  It's not just one, it's both of them.
[01:54:20.634 --> 01:54:22.955]  What does that mean?
[01:54:22.955 --> 01:54:24.275]  I don't know what it means.
[01:54:24.275 --> 01:54:26.476]  What it means is it's a fact.
[01:54:26.476 --> 01:54:41.479]  And one of the reasons we do something like this, and one of the reasons again, I'm very proud to be able to get a few minutes of Alex's audience's time, is to tell you we're at a point right now where you can't take anybody's word on this stuff.
[01:54:41.479 --> 01:54:43.320]  Don't take my word on it.
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:44.740]  Go look it up yourself.
[01:54:45.407 --> 01:54:49.311]  And this is exactly why they're afraid of Infowars.
[01:54:49.311 --> 01:55:00.082]  Alex has said the reason he named his company Free Speech is if he ever got sued, and you'll see that's the name of his company, Free Speech LLC, is that people were suing Free Speech.
[01:55:00.082 --> 01:55:01.244]  Well, guess what?
[01:55:01.244 --> 01:55:03.686]  That is exactly what's going on here.
[01:55:03.686 --> 01:55:05.949]  People are pursuing Free Speech.
[01:55:05.949 --> 01:55:08.051]  And they're doing it because out there they think
[01:55:08.511 --> 01:55:14.175]  You know, we live in a world where Alex Jones' daughter will get yelled at by another parent.
[01:55:14.175 --> 01:55:15.496]  That's the world we live in.
[01:55:15.496 --> 01:55:25.004]  So they know what we're up against, but the thing that they're afraid of is that you, the audience, like everyone here at Infant Force, is actually independent.
[01:55:25.004 --> 01:55:28.726]  For the Alex Jones Show, from Washington, D.C., my name's Bruce Pennington.
[01:55:28.726 --> 01:55:29.427]  Have a great weekend.
