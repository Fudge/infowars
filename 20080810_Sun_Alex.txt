[00:32.280 --> 00:34.000]  I are in USA Radio News.
[00:34.000 --> 00:35.000]  I'm Jimmy Jordan.
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.400]  George and troops are pulling out of the breakaway province of South Ossetia.
[00:39.400 --> 00:42.200]  Its force is overwhelmed by Russian firepower.
[00:42.200 --> 00:44.720]  George's government is pressing for a truce.
[00:44.720 --> 00:46.800]  James Shearer is a Russia analyst.
[00:46.800 --> 00:52.760]  Russia is now particularly determined to demonstrate what it has always stated, that Russia and
[00:52.760 --> 00:58.360]  Russia alone is the guarantor of stability and security in the region.
[00:58.360 --> 01:02.320]  And President Bush is appealing to Russia to halt its attacks on Georgia.
[01:02.320 --> 01:06.760]  White House Press Secretary Dana Perino says Bush has spoken with Russia's Vladimir Putin
[01:06.760 --> 01:12.160]  twice, but would not comment on reports of a testy exchange between the men.
[01:12.160 --> 01:16.680]  President Bush has worked hard to establish with leaders from Russia or from China and
[01:16.680 --> 01:22.000]  other places where we have complex relationships, a relationship based on trust.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.680]  And because of that, they are able to speak very candidly with one another, and very honestly.

[01:47.360 --> 01:52.120]  I was a retired teacher, and this was a wonderful way to stay home, be with my family, and
[01:52.120 --> 01:54.440]  still build that residual income each month.
[01:54.440 --> 01:56.520]  Most of our people work in their spare time.
[01:56.520 --> 02:00.480]  Many have built their businesses to a full-time income and are able to make more money than
[02:00.480 --> 02:02.320]  they could earn at a regular job.
[02:02.320 --> 02:03.960]  I don't have to leave my house.
[02:03.960 --> 02:07.760]  I don't have to pay $3.99 to $4.50 for a gallon of gas.
[02:07.760 --> 02:11.600]  I have a special needs child, and if I need to drop everything and go take care of her,
[02:11.600 --> 02:13.000]  I have that luxury.
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.720]  After five years, the Three-Stip Plant is a proven success story.

[02:26.200 --> 02:34.040]  President Bush is pressing his Olympic hosts to permit a greater political and religious
[02:34.040 --> 02:35.040]  freedom.
[02:35.040 --> 02:39.800]  Bush worshipped at a Beijing church today, and declared China has nothing to fear from
[02:39.800 --> 02:41.720]  expressions of faith.
[02:41.720 --> 02:46.000]  Later he met with Chinese leaders and again voiced his concerns.
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.120]  He also passed on enjoyment of the opening ceremonies.
[02:49.120 --> 02:51.560]  I congratulate you on the opening ceremonies.
[02:51.560 --> 02:54.560]  The tank was there was I mean it was on the 2-1.
[02:54.560 --> 02:58.200]  I'm not sure what it would look like on TV, but I can tell you what it would look like
[02:58.200 --> 02:59.200]  in person.
[02:59.200 --> 03:00.760]  It was spectacular.
[03:00.760 --> 03:06.640]  In Iraq's foreign minister says negotiations are on the brink of reaching a long-term security
[03:06.640 --> 03:08.640]  pact with the U.S.
[03:08.640 --> 03:09.640]  Here's Robert Reid.
[03:09.640 --> 03:14.840]  The Iraqis are insisting on inclusion of a clear timeline for the withdrawal of American
[03:14.840 --> 03:15.840]  forces.
[03:15.840 --> 03:20.640]  Also, he says the main sticking points have been over the authorization of military operations
[03:20.640 --> 03:23.360]  and sovereignty issues.

[03:59.560 --> 04:04.240]  With one gold medal already in his possession, Michael Phelps remains on track early in his
[04:04.240 --> 04:10.120]  quest to beat Mark Spitz's record of seven gold medals in what Olympics?
[04:10.120 --> 04:11.120]  Here's Jim Bell.
[04:11.120 --> 04:15.400]  A little more than nine hours after winning gold in the 400-meter individual medley, Michael
[04:15.400 --> 04:20.040]  Phelps was back in the pool at the WaterCube for the preliminaries of the 200-meter freestyle.
[04:20.040 --> 04:24.800]  He never led in his heat, and his time of one minute 46.48 seconds was well off the
[04:24.800 --> 04:27.600]  record he set at last year's World Championships.
[04:27.600 --> 04:31.400]  It was just the fourth fastest time overall, but there's a reason for that.
[04:31.400 --> 04:35.200]  Today was just a race again and tomorrow.
[04:35.200 --> 04:36.200]  That's all I try to do.
[04:36.200 --> 04:37.200]  I just try to conserve everything.
[04:37.200 --> 04:42.760]  Phelps is joined in the semifinals by fellow American Peter Vanderkei, Jim Bell, Beijing.
[04:42.760 --> 04:47.760]  And China has tightened security, and volleyball players have rallied around their coach after
[04:47.760 --> 04:51.480]  the shocking murder of an American in Beijing.
[04:51.480 --> 04:52.960]  Here's Warren Levinson.
[04:52.960 --> 04:57.040]  The day after U.S. men's volleyball coach Huma Cushan's father-in-law Todd Bachman was
[04:57.040 --> 05:01.600]  stabbed to death there, Chinese authorities closed the historic drum tower for the day.
[05:01.600 --> 05:06.200]  Someone left a spray of lilies and chrysanthemums, traditional Chinese flowers of mourning.
[05:06.200 --> 05:10.080]  McCutcheon was not on the bench for the team's opening win against Venezuela, Captain Thomas
[05:10.080 --> 05:11.080]  Hoffs.
[05:11.080 --> 05:15.680]  It's very hard to continue on, but obviously our first and foremost thoughts and prayers
[05:15.680 --> 05:17.640]  are with their family.
[05:17.640 --> 05:21.800]  The coach's mother-in-law, Barbara Bachman, remains in the hospital in critical but stable
[05:21.800 --> 05:22.800]  condition.
[05:22.800 --> 05:23.920]  Warren Levinson, Beijing.
[05:23.920 --> 05:25.320]  I'm Jody Jordan.
[05:25.320 --> 05:29.320]  And that's news from the Information Radio Network.
[05:29.320 --> 05:34.320]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, we need radical change if we're to avert becoming
[05:34.320 --> 05:36.000]  a third-world nation.
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.240]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical, natural, alternative health

[06:59.800 --> 07:12.280]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[07:12.280 --> 07:19.040]  It is Sunday, the 10th day of August 2008, and I was going to take off the Sunday show
[07:19.040 --> 07:26.440]  today and have Jason Bermas sit in for me, but I am here live because of pressing world
[07:26.440 --> 07:27.440]  events.
[07:27.440 --> 07:33.160]  But Jason Bermas will be riding shotgun with me here in the next two hours today.
[07:33.160 --> 07:38.800]  We'll be hearing from former Wall Street Journal editor, former head of the Treasury
[07:38.800 --> 07:45.040]  Department, under Paul Craig Roberts, an exclusive message here for us about the situation in
[07:45.040 --> 07:47.440]  Georgia with Russia.
[07:47.440 --> 07:52.160]  So Bob Chapman, who worked in military intelligence against the Russians, will be joining us coming
[07:52.160 --> 07:55.280]  up later in the second hour today.
[07:55.280 --> 08:00.000]  We will not be talking about John Edwards and his girlfriend, and does he have a love
[08:00.000 --> 08:01.000]  child?
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.200]  You will not be discussing a murder at the Olympics.
[08:05.200 --> 08:10.440]  We will not be talking about celebrity hairdos or your favorite color in the next two hours,
[08:10.440 --> 08:11.440]  ladies and gentlemen.
[08:11.440 --> 08:16.040]  We're going to be talking about one of the biggest military developments in the last
[08:16.040 --> 08:25.040]  50 years, taking place late Thursday evening, Russian time into, of course, Friday here
[08:25.040 --> 08:26.640]  in the United States.
[08:26.640 --> 08:35.080]  We are now three days into this conflict and there are a lot of important facets to this.
[08:35.080 --> 08:40.000]  Number one, I have been listening to talk radio, I've been listening to news, I've been reading
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.480]  the newspapers here in the U.S.
[08:42.480 --> 08:46.720]  I have been talking to people when I go into a convenience store to get gas.
[08:46.720 --> 08:51.640]  I've asked four or five people in stores the last day, hey, have you heard about Russia?
[08:51.640 --> 08:54.040]  Most of them haven't, and there's a huge conflict going on there.
[08:54.040 --> 09:01.880]  If they have, they said, yeah, those evil Russians, they have attacked an innocent country.
[09:01.880 --> 09:06.480]  And lo and behold, some message boards and places actually believe that the Russians
[09:06.480 --> 09:09.920]  have attacked Georgia in the south of the United States.
[09:09.920 --> 09:14.760]  On Friday, I joked on my weekday show and said, people are so dumb down here, kind of
[09:14.760 --> 09:20.200]  like Miss South Carolina at the beauty pageant who didn't even know what country she was in.
[09:20.200 --> 09:24.600]  That is a large portion of our population that only invites the type of tyranny we're
[09:24.600 --> 09:25.600]  witnessing.
[09:25.600 --> 09:27.720]  Here is the basic facts.
[09:27.720 --> 09:34.360]  In 1991, the Soviet Union reportedly collapsed Georgia, which was one of its satellite states,
[09:34.360 --> 09:40.040]  where Joseph Stalin and others were from, and been historically part of the mother Russia,
[09:40.040 --> 09:41.760]  broke away from the Soviet Union.
[09:41.760 --> 09:48.320]  They then viciously attacked several enclaves on the Russian proper border, engaging in
[09:48.320 --> 09:53.400]  ethnic cleansing of ethnic Russians.
[09:53.400 --> 10:01.960]  And since then, since 1993, Russian troops have been there with the United Nations in
[10:01.960 --> 10:09.920]  the two breakaway republics of Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[10:09.920 --> 10:18.600]  Late Thursday into early Friday, more than 10,000 Georgian troops backed up by US special
[10:18.600 --> 10:21.560]  forces from the Army and the Marines.
[10:21.560 --> 10:24.240]  This is all over foreign press, Russian, British.
[10:24.240 --> 10:26.640]  You will never hear it here in the US.
[10:26.640 --> 10:34.000]  US troops commanding launched a sneak attack on the breakaway republic of Ossetia that
[10:34.000 --> 10:40.960]  has been in total peace since the early 1990s in a United Nations ceasefire.
[10:40.960 --> 10:48.800]  They massacred thousands of civilians, hundreds of Osseti troops and Russian troops, a huge
[10:48.800 --> 10:53.960]  sneak attack blasting the capital city and taking over every other major city.
[10:53.960 --> 11:02.040]  They moved in with self-propelled rocket launchers.
[11:02.040 --> 11:07.760]  They moved in with over 100 tanks, helicopters and jets and blew the living daylights out
[11:07.760 --> 11:09.160]  of the entire region.
[11:09.160 --> 11:15.600]  Now, I go on air Friday, and it's not in any of our news.
[11:15.600 --> 11:19.880]  I'm scanning newswires all morning, seeing nothing about it for hours getting ready.
[11:19.880 --> 11:23.200]  That's the second big part of the story was the news blackout.
[11:23.200 --> 11:28.840]  Then we start reading the BBC and other reports at about 11 a.m. saying that Russia has attacked
[11:28.840 --> 11:29.840]  Georgia.
[11:29.840 --> 11:35.720]  But then in the bottom of the reports, they all admitted after Georgia snuck attack Russian
[11:35.720 --> 11:37.920]  military bases.
[11:37.920 --> 11:42.800]  On the day the Olympics start, while Putin and Bush are on stage together, a massive
[11:42.800 --> 11:47.600]  US controlled, when I say US, this isn't our government, it's not our military, this
[11:47.600 --> 11:51.280]  is the criminal new world order doing this, this is unprecedented.
[11:51.280 --> 11:54.920]  This isn't some sneak attack on Iraq or some preemptive war strategy.
[11:54.920 --> 12:01.600]  This is preemptive war against Russian forces slaughtering them in cold blood.
[12:01.600 --> 12:06.080]  Our name, if it was mud before, with all the lies and propaganda and premeditated wars
[12:06.080 --> 12:10.760]  and propaganda, now all over the world people are freaking out.
[12:10.760 --> 12:15.840]  Now, for the last two and a half days, since it's been in the press as the third or fourth
[12:15.840 --> 12:22.760]  top story, literally celebrity hairdos and John Edwards are above that, and Will Hillary
[12:22.760 --> 12:28.360]  Clinton be the VP, that's all your top stories that don't matter.
[12:28.360 --> 12:32.000]  While all of this is happening, the media, and I've got stacks of the news headlines
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.640]  that are all deceptive here in the West and the US predominantly, is saying, why won't
[12:36.640 --> 12:38.640]  the Russians stop attacking?
[12:38.640 --> 12:40.000]  Why are the Russians doing this?
[12:40.000 --> 12:41.800]  Why are they so mean?
[12:41.800 --> 12:47.160]  Meanwhile, the Georgian forces are continuing to battle and attack the Russians, and for
[12:47.160 --> 12:52.600]  two and a half days there's been house to house fighting all over northern Georgia,
[12:52.600 --> 12:54.760]  bordering Russia.
[12:54.760 --> 13:00.040]  Now Russian special forces arrive yesterday, more Russian hind helicopters and flogger
[13:00.040 --> 13:06.040]  helicopters and MiGs, they have attacked and blown out the pipeline going out to the Black
[13:06.040 --> 13:14.800]  Sea over to the US ally Turkey, and I've got the press reports here, they're using Muslim
[13:14.800 --> 13:18.840]  fighters against the Russians as usual, just like they did in Serbia, just like they did
[13:18.840 --> 13:28.160]  in Afghanistan, they are using Marines Army, and it's reported that mercenaries, quote,
[13:28.160 --> 13:32.880]  in black uniforms with American insignia are on the ground.
[13:32.880 --> 13:34.960]  Let's go, this is from Russia today.
[13:34.960 --> 13:39.560]  This is the CNN of Russia in English, the biggest international news channel, Russia
[13:39.560 --> 13:40.560]  has, play the short clip.
[13:40.560 --> 13:41.560]  Here it is.
[13:41.560 --> 13:47.480]  President's envoy Dmitry Midov calls Georgia's military actions the ultimate villainy.
[13:47.480 --> 13:52.280]  He says the Georgian army is possibly reinforced by mercenaries, as foreigners have been found
[13:52.280 --> 13:58.080]  among their bodies.
[13:58.080 --> 14:02.920]  The town looks like Stalingrad during World War II, with fallen trees, power lines, burned
[14:02.920 --> 14:07.440]  Georgian tanks all over the street, dead bodies of Georgian soldiers are lying everywhere.
[14:07.440 --> 14:12.040]  We have information that there were mercenaries among the attackers, and yesterday's most
[14:12.040 --> 14:16.160]  recent tank attack, the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by Ukrainians.
[14:16.160 --> 14:21.440]  Two unidentified bodies found today are said to be black, possibly they are Americans,
[14:21.440 --> 14:23.560]  but we can't say for sure yet.
[14:23.560 --> 14:29.800]  We'll be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests.
[14:29.800 --> 14:37.520]  Now we've got time for a break, let's play a short clip of witnesses saying yes, black
[14:37.520 --> 14:43.440]  men, US insignias, other reports of men in black uniforms with US insignias, and I have
[14:43.440 --> 14:47.640]  a stack of mainstream reports admitting a thousand US Marines were massing for a war
[14:47.640 --> 14:51.120]  game drill, hundreds of army special forces.
[14:51.120 --> 14:52.120]  Here it is.
[14:52.120 --> 15:04.320]  Of course I am, my son is in Rostov, Russia, I am alone here.
[15:04.320 --> 15:09.400]  My hand hurts a lot after I was shot, but I can't go to hospital because people are
[15:09.400 --> 15:15.720]  shooting outside, there were soldiers and tanks on the streets shooting all night long, I've
[15:15.720 --> 15:22.680]  been hiding 40 people in my bunker, I thought against the Nazis, I was not afraid then,
[15:22.680 --> 15:35.400]  but now I'm very afraid, I have never seen anything like that, we were not prepared.
[15:35.400 --> 15:36.400]  So traumatic situation.
[15:36.400 --> 15:41.040]  All right that's not the clip, we're going to come back and play that after the break
[15:41.040 --> 15:46.040]  because there's hours of this, more on the foreign troops, there is no doubt US troops
[15:46.040 --> 15:50.000]  are at least advising, the reports are dead.
[15:50.000 --> 15:56.480]  Bottom line, headline on PrismPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, the United States has launched
[15:56.480 --> 16:02.840]  a sneak attack against Russia, that's all over the Russian news, US back forces launched
[16:02.840 --> 16:07.640]  sneak attack on Russia, our media thinks we're so down they tell you that Russia attacked
[16:07.640 --> 16:08.640]  Georgia.
[16:08.640 --> 16:13.360]  It's absolutely incredible, we'll continue to cover this and what it's going to mean
[16:13.360 --> 16:15.680]  to the economy and the future of the world.
[16:15.680 --> 16:19.880]  On the other side also, aircraft carriers from the US are steaming towards Iran, preparing
[16:19.880 --> 16:29.320]  to launch attacks there, stay with us.
[16:29.320 --> 16:32.880]  Hello Ted Anderson, listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note
[16:32.880 --> 16:37.400]  and understand the risks of deficit spending, therefore with catastrophic events it comes
[16:37.400 --> 16:41.760]  as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors
[16:41.760 --> 16:46.080]  can remove from their accounts, a fractional reserve system means only a small portion
[16:46.080 --> 16:50.280]  of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal, deficit spending will skyrocket
[16:50.280 --> 16:54.640]  through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed
[16:54.640 --> 16:59.240]  by a depressed economy, a current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central
[16:59.240 --> 17:03.680]  banks to increase liquidity for depositors, however an increase in money supply without
[17:03.680 --> 17:08.120]  equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation, in order to achieve strength and
[17:08.120 --> 17:13.280]  stability I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned
[17:13.280 --> 17:18.400]  into gold and silver, while paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on
[17:18.400 --> 17:25.240]  its own has held value for over 6,000 years, for more information call 1-800-686-2237,
[17:25.240 --> 17:28.760]  that's 1-800-686-2237.
[17:28.760 --> 17:33.640]  Alabama State Code makes it illegal to drive barefoot, in Downey, California it's illegal
[17:33.640 --> 17:38.120]  to wash your car in the street, in Minnesota you can be fined for displaying that you're
[17:38.120 --> 17:43.080]  vehicle is for sale, these laws are obviously not made to protect us but instead to help

[20:30.280 --> 20:45.280]  We're going to be taking your calls coming up in the next segment at 877-590-5550.
[20:45.280 --> 20:56.360]  That's 877-590-KLBJ, named after the station we bring this show to you across the country
[20:56.360 --> 21:02.360]  out of here in Austin, Texas.
[21:02.360 --> 21:07.160]  Let me recap the top story here.
[21:07.160 --> 21:15.000]  Not celebrity hairdos, not an American is killed in Beijing, not John Edwards has a
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.320]  girlfriend and might have a baby.
[21:17.320 --> 21:19.280]  That doesn't affect our lives.
[21:19.280 --> 21:26.560]  What does affect our lives is that Georgia is the second largest contingent in Iraq,
[21:26.560 --> 21:33.200]  3,000 Georgians after the British, that's the largest contingent, British again or second,
[21:33.200 --> 21:39.680]  Georgia is number 3, US number 1, contingent of coalition of the willing forces in Iraq
[21:39.680 --> 21:42.080]  are having to evacuate those 3,000 troops.
[21:42.080 --> 21:45.720]  The United States, after the last 10 years, has been building up the Georgians, giving
[21:45.720 --> 21:48.120]  them weapons, giving them training.
[21:48.120 --> 21:54.240]  When we say US, we mean the private, global, corporate, international community, as it's
[21:54.240 --> 21:58.560]  known, that controls our government, taking our liberties, taking our freedoms as well.
[21:58.560 --> 22:02.400]  I'm not defending the Russian government or saying they're great people either.
[22:02.400 --> 22:08.120]  But in the late 90s, they funded Wahhabist, Muslim, slash communist, what a mixture, out
[22:08.120 --> 22:14.360]  of Albania to go into Kosovo and attack police stations, military bases, burned down cities.
[22:14.360 --> 22:18.800]  When the Serbs fought back, the news media, the control corporate press knew the American
[22:18.800 --> 22:22.600]  people were in willful ignorance and totally delusional.
[22:22.600 --> 22:28.560]  So they said Serbia has viciously, premeditatedly attacked the country of Kosovo.
[22:28.560 --> 22:31.840]  That's like saying that the USA has attacked Texas.
[22:31.840 --> 22:36.240]  Now it was part of Serbia, but they lied and said, knowing Americans didn't know about
[22:36.240 --> 22:40.600]  maps of the Balkans or parts of the world and said, Serbia has attacked the sovereign
[22:40.600 --> 22:45.040]  innocent nation of Kosovo and they've murdered innocent people.
[22:45.040 --> 22:48.000]  It was all total lies as usual.
[22:48.000 --> 22:51.680]  And then the bombardment and the attack started.
[22:51.680 --> 23:00.280]  Then a puppet regime was put in and they did break off Serbia and handed over to the Muslims.
[23:00.280 --> 23:01.680]  And it is the same thing here.
[23:01.680 --> 23:07.360]  They have now had the Georgians, the mainline Georgians, who have secret police and secret
[23:07.360 --> 23:08.640]  arrest and everything else.
[23:08.640 --> 23:10.920]  All this talk about democracy is pure bull.
[23:10.920 --> 23:14.840]  They launched a sneak attack Thursday night into Friday morning, attacking all the major
[23:14.840 --> 23:19.040]  towns and the capital city of Ossetia.
[23:19.040 --> 23:27.880]  They've now tried to launch attacks into Abkhazia to the west, right on the Black Sea with a
[23:27.880 --> 23:29.440]  pipeline to Turkey.
[23:29.440 --> 23:34.160]  The Russians fight back and they know the public so dumb they run headlines like AP
[23:34.160 --> 23:35.160]  did.
[23:35.160 --> 23:37.920]  Georgians say Russia attacking.
[23:37.920 --> 23:41.400]  Now that sounds to a layman like Russia has attacked Georgia, but then you read the bottom
[23:41.400 --> 23:45.920]  of the article that says, after Georgians attacked and killed premeditatedly in a sneak
[23:45.920 --> 23:50.320]  attack, Russians and 2,000 civilians, Russia fights back.
[23:50.320 --> 23:55.080]  Then they're firing rockets, helicopter attacks, tank attacks against the Russians, slaughtering
[23:55.080 --> 23:56.600]  them.
[23:56.600 --> 23:58.560]  And the media is saying, how dare Russia fight?
[23:58.560 --> 24:00.240]  How dare Russia not stand down?
[24:00.240 --> 24:04.880]  And Bush and McCain and Obama come out and give statements about how dare Russia premeditatedly
[24:04.880 --> 24:07.080]  attack Georgia.
[24:07.080 --> 24:09.440]  This is how dumb they think you are.
[24:09.440 --> 24:13.240]  And I've got people in the message board in the common area of infowars.com saying we're
[24:13.240 --> 24:18.360]  lying that the U.S. doesn't back Georgia and that Georgia didn't attack even when Georgia
[24:18.360 --> 24:19.480]  admits it.
[24:19.480 --> 24:24.040]  That is the willful delusions that we're dealing with.
[24:24.040 --> 24:28.480]  Now, again, up on infowars.com, up on prismplanet.com, we have British, we have French, we have
[24:28.480 --> 24:29.480]  Georgian.
[24:29.480 --> 24:30.480]  We have Russian.
[24:30.480 --> 24:31.480]  Go watch it all.
[24:31.480 --> 24:32.480]  Go read it all.
[24:32.480 --> 24:33.480]  Go decide for yourself.
[24:33.480 --> 24:34.480]  We put it all up there.
[24:34.480 --> 24:35.480]  Go decide for yourself what's happening.
[24:35.480 --> 24:36.480]  It's very clear.
[24:36.480 --> 24:37.480]  It's admitted what's happening.
[24:37.480 --> 24:38.480]  Here's a short clip.
[24:38.480 --> 24:41.960]  We already played you the official Russian government saying we know there are foreign
[24:41.960 --> 24:42.960]  fighters.
[24:42.960 --> 24:45.680]  Reportedly, there's blacks with American uniforms there.
[24:45.680 --> 24:48.640]  That really stands out dead on the side of the road.
[24:48.640 --> 24:52.560]  We know there's 1,000 Marines, hundreds of Army advisors at least.
[24:52.560 --> 24:55.920]  We know the U.S. has said some of our troops were cut off in there and trying to evacuate
[24:55.920 --> 24:56.920]  them.
[24:56.920 --> 25:00.120]  We know our troops in a criminal attack against the Russians.
[25:00.120 --> 25:04.000]  They got 20,000 nukes, people.
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.640]  They're not trying to start a war with us.
[25:05.640 --> 25:07.200]  This is insanity.
[25:07.200 --> 25:10.400]  But you can't even get the American people to realize what's happening.
[25:10.400 --> 25:15.240]  Here's a clip of a lady on national Russian TV, the equivalent of CNN in English, talking
[25:15.240 --> 25:20.280]  about what you just heard earlier from the German, from the Russian government reporting
[25:20.280 --> 25:21.280]  on this.
[25:21.280 --> 25:22.280]  Here it is.
[25:22.280 --> 25:27.280]  They've fled across the border, they've told us about their experiences.
[25:27.280 --> 25:33.520]  The war has been on for four or five days now.
[25:33.520 --> 25:34.520]  We are already tired.
[25:34.520 --> 25:36.800]  There are lots of bodies over there.
[25:36.800 --> 25:40.480]  Lots of people have been killed, mostly Asetians, but also Georgians.
[25:40.480 --> 25:47.160]  They had American emblems on the forearms, and they were in black uniforms.
[25:47.160 --> 25:48.160]  Are you scared?
[25:48.160 --> 25:49.800]  Of course I am.
[25:49.800 --> 25:51.640]  My son is in Rostov, Russia.
[25:51.640 --> 25:57.000]  I am alone here.
[25:57.000 --> 26:02.080]  My hand hurts a lot after I was shot, but I can't go to hospital because people are
[26:02.080 --> 26:03.080]  shooting outside.
[26:03.080 --> 26:04.080]  All right.
[26:04.080 --> 26:05.080]  That's right.
[26:05.080 --> 26:09.080]  U.S. backed forces, and I say U.S., our country's gone.
[26:09.080 --> 26:13.600]  People running our country are dismantling, running the military out, three, four tours
[26:13.600 --> 26:19.160]  destroying the dollar, destroying our borders, our sovereignty, and then now you have the
[26:19.160 --> 26:25.800]  Marine Corps mercenaries, the army, running a sneak attack against Russia.
[26:25.800 --> 26:29.640]  They wouldn't dare do this in the 80s when they used al-Qaeda to attack Russia.
[26:29.640 --> 26:30.880]  That's now declassified.
[26:30.880 --> 26:37.520]  For six months before they invaded Afghanistan, they had Afghan al-Qaeda attacking Russians
[26:37.520 --> 26:41.000]  in the neighboring states to get the Russians to come in.
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.880]  That was another lie to the American people that the Russians attacked Afghanistan.
[26:44.880 --> 26:45.880]  No.
[26:45.880 --> 26:50.320]  I bet next they'll tell us that Russia attacked Hitler, or I bet they'll tell us that Russia
[26:50.320 --> 26:51.320]  attacked Napoleon.
[26:51.320 --> 26:52.320]  No.
[26:52.320 --> 26:56.240]  Napoleon attacked Russia, Hitler attacked Russia, and the United States, the criminals
[26:56.240 --> 26:59.240]  that have hijacked our nation, they've hijacked or hijacked the plane.
[26:59.240 --> 27:00.920]  That is in a United Airlines pilot.
[27:00.920 --> 27:01.920]  That's a hijacker.
[27:01.920 --> 27:02.920]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[27:02.920 --> 27:03.920]  This isn't our military.
[27:03.920 --> 27:05.800]  This is not our government doing this.
[27:05.800 --> 27:08.920]  This is a pack of criminals.
[27:08.920 --> 27:13.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, do you want nuclear war with Russia?
[27:13.400 --> 27:14.900]  Is that what everybody wants?
[27:14.900 --> 27:19.160]  I know it's fun to pick on Arabs and attack them and go into nations that we set up and
[27:19.160 --> 27:21.640]  then told to invade Kuwait like Iraq.
[27:21.640 --> 27:25.000]  I know it's fun to act tough and not be able to find on the map, but say it's conservative
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.200]  to kill brown people.
[27:26.200 --> 27:27.800]  But do you want to mess with Russia?
[27:27.800 --> 27:32.960]  Now, I'm sorry, I have the Times of London here saying that Russia is threatening to
[27:32.960 --> 27:35.760]  use nuclear weapons against Western Europe and the US.
[27:35.760 --> 27:39.800]  They didn't do that during the Cold War.
[27:39.800 --> 27:43.600]  I have the articles here where before this happened, they said, you're encircling us
[27:43.600 --> 27:50.160]  in Georgia with troops in the Czech Republic, in Ukraine, in other areas.
[27:50.160 --> 27:51.160]  What is it?
[27:51.160 --> 27:52.160]  Nine countries.
[27:52.160 --> 27:55.120]  And the Russian Foreign Minister six months ago, then two months ago, and then again,
[27:55.120 --> 28:00.960]  Friday said, we will use any military means to protect us, including nuclear weapons.
[28:00.960 --> 28:01.960]  Okay.
[28:01.960 --> 28:10.400]  Now, can you imagine what the US would do if Russian troops attacked, say, Guantanamo
[28:10.400 --> 28:15.320]  Bay 90 miles off our coast and killed everybody?
[28:15.320 --> 28:16.320]  You never heard the end of it.
[28:16.320 --> 28:17.560]  I mean, this is the neocons.
[28:17.560 --> 28:19.200]  It's not enough to stage 9-11.
[28:19.200 --> 28:20.200]  It's not enough for Cheney.
[28:20.200 --> 28:25.360]  It comes out mainstream news last week, wanting to create fake Iranian patrol boats and have
[28:25.360 --> 28:29.840]  US Navy seals in them, attack US ships in the Strait of Hormuz off the coast of Iran
[28:29.840 --> 28:30.840]  to blame it on them.
[28:30.840 --> 28:34.360]  That's now mainstream news MSNBC reporting and we reported it before it was mainstream
[28:34.360 --> 28:35.360]  news.
[28:35.360 --> 28:37.360]  Psyhurst, New Yorker magazine, not enough.
[28:37.360 --> 28:39.320]  Now they have to attack Russia.
[28:39.320 --> 28:43.440]  And I got Jason Bermas coming back after the break to tell you, they always tell you, the
[28:43.440 --> 28:45.840]  new world order always tells you what they're going to do in advance.
[28:45.840 --> 28:48.160]  We'll talk about that and then take your phone calls.
[28:48.160 --> 28:52.880]  This is very, very serious, 877-590-5525.
[28:52.880 --> 28:58.280]  I'm sorry, we will not be talking about your favorite color, celebrity hairstyles, John
[28:58.280 --> 29:03.440]  Edwards and his girlfriend, or the Olympics, or Hillary Clinton's cat.
[29:03.440 --> 29:04.680]  We will be talking about serious issues.
[29:04.680 --> 29:08.480]  I want to hear from military that know about this going on in the buildup or a lot of Fort
[29:08.480 --> 29:11.080]  Hood troops that have already been in Georgia and rotated back.
[29:11.080 --> 29:12.080]  We'll be right back.
[29:12.080 --> 29:13.080]  Stay with us.
[29:13.080 --> 29:34.440]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis,
[29:34.440 --> 29:36.240]  fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[29:36.240 --> 29:40.080]  We are one of the 75 million Americans at the Center for Disease Control reports the
[29:40.080 --> 29:42.640]  suffering from internal parasites.
[29:42.640 --> 29:46.920]  If so, freshwater organics is proud to introduce you to a million-year-old miracle that has
[29:46.920 --> 29:51.080]  been used all over the world by health-conscious individuals seeking alternatives to chemicals
[29:51.080 --> 29:52.080]  and drugs.

[29:58.080 --> 29:59.080]  no additives.

[30:29.600 --> 30:33.680]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high
[30:33.680 --> 30:35.640]  energy and vibrant health?
[30:35.640 --> 30:40.800]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[30:40.800 --> 30:45.780]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[30:45.780 --> 30:49.760]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[30:49.760 --> 30:54.720]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping
[30:54.720 --> 30:58.200]  you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.

[31:04.400 --> 31:09.040]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[31:09.040 --> 31:10.200]  of your body.
[31:10.200 --> 31:15.280]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[31:47.800 --> 31:52.640]  Huge improvement in fuel economy typically ranges from 8 to 20 percent or more, saving
[31:52.640 --> 31:56.160]  you 30 to 80 cents on each gallon of fuel at the pump.

[32:28.120 --> 32:29.120]  Hi there.
[32:29.120 --> 32:32.440]  I want to talk to you about a dirty word, hangover.
[32:32.440 --> 32:33.800]  I know, I know.
[32:33.800 --> 32:37.560]  As the makers of drink and made hangover defense tablets, we hear it every day.
[32:37.560 --> 32:41.040]  Grown respectable adults don't get hangovers.
[32:41.040 --> 32:44.800]  Those are what you got in college when you had about 10 too many at the frat house and
[32:44.800 --> 32:48.580]  then rolled out of bed bright and early at the crack of noon the next day.
[32:48.580 --> 32:52.480]  These days, well sure, sometimes you'll have a couple drinks with dinner and sometimes
[32:52.480 --> 32:55.840]  you'll wake up with a little headache feeling just a bit queasy.
[32:55.840 --> 32:57.880]  But that's not really a hangover, is it?
[32:57.880 --> 33:01.320]  Well, call it what you want, but now you don't need to get one.
[33:01.320 --> 33:05.520]  Thanks to drink and made hangover defense, just pop one fizzy drink and made tablet
[33:05.520 --> 33:08.480]  into a glass of water just after you have a couple drinks.
[33:08.480 --> 33:13.520]  They taste great and the patented guava leaf extract formula works while you sleep.
[33:13.520 --> 33:17.640]  So you wake up with no headache, no queasiness, no hangover.
[33:17.640 --> 33:19.960]  Look for the green box at retailers everywhere.
[33:19.960 --> 33:22.960]  For a location near you, visit drinkandmade.com.
[33:22.960 --> 33:24.480]  Drink and made hangover defense.
[33:24.480 --> 33:31.800]  It's how smart, responsible people like us avoid hangovers.
[33:31.800 --> 33:40.600]  More listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[33:40.600 --> 34:00.920]  Okay, folks, no more Mr. Nice Guy, I guess people down in our country are so arrogant
[34:00.920 --> 34:08.480]  and on such incredible power trips that they build up Georgia to attack Russia for the
[34:08.480 --> 34:13.400]  last decade, publicly say they're planning to do it, blow the hell out of a bunch of
[34:13.400 --> 34:18.760]  Russian military bases, slaughter civilians by the thousands, that's all admitted, and
[34:18.760 --> 34:23.000]  then tell the idiot public in this country that Russia attacked.
[34:23.000 --> 34:29.120]  While they put it in the bottom of each story that Georgia attacked them and is still fighting.
[34:29.120 --> 34:32.440]  When Russia is saying as soon as you pull out of these areas and stop attacking, we'll
[34:32.440 --> 34:33.440]  pull out.
[34:33.440 --> 34:38.400]  There's over 40,000 refugees that have poured across the border into Russia and it's the
[34:38.400 --> 34:39.680]  same deal.
[34:39.680 --> 34:43.280]  They attack Serbia and say that Serbia attacked them.
[34:43.280 --> 34:47.200]  They attack Russia and say that Russia attacked the Afghans.
[34:47.200 --> 34:49.240]  This is back in 1979.
[34:49.240 --> 34:50.560]  It's the same story.
[34:50.560 --> 34:54.720]  It's been done this time again and you watch Russian TV and they're like, we don't know
[34:54.720 --> 34:56.920]  why the US backed this attack.
[34:56.920 --> 34:57.920]  It's terrible.
[34:57.920 --> 34:59.160]  They're up attacking us.
[34:59.160 --> 35:00.320]  We have nuclear weapons.
[35:00.320 --> 35:01.840]  We may use them.
[35:01.840 --> 35:05.680]  And the average American just out having a great time, giggling, doesn't even know where
[35:05.680 --> 35:08.880]  Georgia is, thinks it's all funny.
[35:08.880 --> 35:12.880]  Jason Bermas, who again sits in when I'm out of town on the weekday show, the maker of
[35:12.880 --> 35:16.680]  loose change, and of course the new film, Fabled Enemies, you've been watching this and
[35:16.680 --> 35:18.400]  tracking this.
[35:18.400 --> 35:22.160]  What is it like for you to watch the news and hear them say that Russia attacked Georgia
[35:22.160 --> 35:27.200]  when it was a sneak attack by US backed forces and no doubt US military were involved?
[35:27.200 --> 35:29.800]  Well, it's very much like 1984.
[35:29.800 --> 35:34.880]  I feel like black is white and white is black and they're not going to tell you the truth
[35:34.880 --> 35:39.480]  and then you look at this whole grace period, 2002, they come out and say, listen, we're
[35:39.480 --> 35:40.840]  going to start training these guys.
[35:40.840 --> 35:42.920]  US special forces are going to Georgia.
[35:42.920 --> 35:46.480]  Later on, Georgia becomes a major military help for us in Iraq.
[35:46.480 --> 35:49.320]  Again, they are the third largest amount of troops there.
[35:49.320 --> 35:52.280]  I think they have something over 3,000 troops.
[35:52.280 --> 35:57.160]  Then they start running drills where we happen to be and we send US special forces troops
[35:57.160 --> 35:58.160]  there.
[35:58.160 --> 36:01.400]  Drills all around the Russian border right where they attacked.
[36:01.400 --> 36:02.400]  Exactly.
[36:02.400 --> 36:04.920]  I think Russia didn't really want to alarm people and that's why they started to do
[36:04.920 --> 36:09.160]  their quote unquote drills because that report came out before we found out that Georgian
[36:09.160 --> 36:12.400]  troops were doing drills with US forces prior to this conflict.
[36:12.400 --> 36:15.280]  They were saying, oh, well, the Russians were building up with these drills.
[36:15.280 --> 36:18.080]  No, it turns out the Russians were probably building up with these drills because they
[36:18.080 --> 36:22.880]  saw the influx of not only US forces, but radar equipment and missile equipment.
[36:22.880 --> 36:23.880]  Ukrainian.
[36:23.880 --> 36:24.880]  Exactly.
[36:24.880 --> 36:29.400]  And it's just so bizarre to me that somebody sent me this email and I didn't believe it
[36:29.400 --> 36:31.200]  at first, but I went and checked it out.
[36:31.200 --> 36:33.760]  They literally tell you they're going to do this stuff.
[36:33.760 --> 36:37.080]  In 2001, a very popular video game Ghost Recon came out.
[36:37.080 --> 36:41.120]  Now, this is Tom Clancy, who seems to be somewhat of a prophet.
[36:41.120 --> 36:45.400]  He wrote a book about hijackers hijacking jets to fly into the World Trade Center a
[36:45.400 --> 36:51.440]  year before 9-11, Fox TV with the lone government series, and I had the star of it on.
[36:51.440 --> 36:55.240]  The CIA approached them and said, we want you to do a pilot about hijack jets being
[36:55.240 --> 36:58.600]  flown into the World Trade Center to launch a war in Afghanistan, but the government's
[36:58.600 --> 36:59.600]  really going to do it.
[36:59.600 --> 37:00.600]  Then that really happened.
[37:00.600 --> 37:04.640]  Tell us the plot, and this is off their official website, of Ghost Recon 2002.
[37:04.640 --> 37:06.840]  Yeah, this actually came out in 2001.
[37:06.840 --> 37:10.600]  It was released on Xbox in 2002, but the story took place in 2008.
[37:10.600 --> 37:12.280]  I remember reading the synopsis.
[37:12.280 --> 37:13.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[37:13.280 --> 37:18.600]  The story took place again in 2008, and it was US special forces sent to Georgia to
[37:18.600 --> 37:19.600]  combat.
[37:19.600 --> 37:20.600]  Read the game box.
[37:20.600 --> 37:27.640]  In 2008, Russians go to combat in Ossetia, and then US forces go in to help them.
[37:27.640 --> 37:33.600]  The exact place, the exact time, seven years before with Tom Clancy's video game.
[37:33.600 --> 37:34.600]  Yeah, absolutely.
[37:34.600 --> 37:36.280]  And one of the really spooky aspects of this is...
[37:36.280 --> 37:37.280]  Read the whole thing like you did during the night.
[37:37.280 --> 37:38.280]  All right, sure.
[37:38.280 --> 37:41.520]  Ghost Recon begins in 2008 with civil unrest in Russia.
[37:41.520 --> 37:45.480]  Ultra-nationalists have seized power in Moscow with plans to rebuild the Iron Curtain.
[37:45.480 --> 37:50.960]  The first step is clandestine support of rebel factions in Georgia and Baltic states.
[37:50.960 --> 37:54.920]  This is where the ghosts come in, to silence the rebellion.
[37:54.920 --> 37:58.240]  Armed with the most advanced weaponry in the world, the soldiers of Ghost Recon force and
[37:58.240 --> 38:03.280]  covertly inserted into Eastern Europe and then given specific missions to curtail the
[38:03.280 --> 38:06.600]  rebels' actions and overthrow their benefactors.
[38:06.600 --> 38:10.840]  The game storyline stems from political turmoil that can be in the light of the last few years
[38:10.840 --> 38:16.120]  in which ultra-nationalist regimes came to power and placed its leader, Dmitry Arbetov,
[38:16.120 --> 38:17.920]  as Russia's president.
[38:17.920 --> 38:22.480]  By 2007, the threat posed by Arbetov administration became clear.
[38:22.480 --> 38:27.720]  Russia forms an alliance called the Russian Democratic Union, which is made up of previously
[38:27.720 --> 38:31.400]  conquered countries of the Ukraine, Belkras, and Kazakhstan.
[38:31.400 --> 38:35.320]  Together they launch a campaign to revive the long-dissolved Soviet Union by taking
[38:35.320 --> 38:37.120]  back former Soviet republics.
[38:37.120 --> 38:41.720]  But in reality, this was taken from Russia, Russia has these small mini-republics, and
[38:41.720 --> 38:43.640]  they were the ones that were attacked.
[38:43.640 --> 38:46.560]  They've been there since 93 under a UN deal.
[38:46.560 --> 38:53.920]  So listeners, a sneak attack Thursday by Georgian US-backed military forces against Russian
[38:53.920 --> 38:59.320]  enclave, thousands dead, Russian dead troops, Russia fights back to kick them out.
[38:59.320 --> 39:03.400]  The fighting is still raging, and you turn on our news, they'll just mention, oh, Russia
[39:03.400 --> 39:08.000]  attacked Georgia, George Bush, and Barack Obama say it's terrible.
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.680]  Again, we're not even choosing sides here, but the US shouldn't be preemptively attacking
[39:13.680 --> 39:20.680]  areas of Russia, killing Russian troops, and then lying in our media telling us that Russia
[39:20.680 --> 39:22.160]  needs to stop its attack.
[39:22.160 --> 39:25.920]  And then the world leaders are hand-in-hand at the Olympics.
[39:25.920 --> 39:28.440]  It's very weird and suspicious, and I think it's also ironic.
[39:28.440 --> 39:29.440]  They started on 888.
[39:29.440 --> 39:30.440]  Yeah.
[39:30.440 --> 39:34.600]  I think it's also ironic that a lot of the younger people in special forces may have
[39:34.600 --> 39:37.720]  actually played this video game when they were 14, 15 years old.
[39:37.720 --> 39:39.000]  I mean, this was a popular game.
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  That's the preconditioner.
[39:40.000 --> 39:41.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  That's exactly what I thought.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.960]  I mean, they literally were preconditioned for this same conflict, and now they're there,
[39:45.960 --> 39:48.440]  and the remnants of that video game are in their minds.
[39:48.440 --> 39:49.440]  Well, they knew.
[39:49.440 --> 39:53.440]  I mean, just what Clancy says, quote, I get my best in plots from intelligence, just like
[39:53.440 --> 39:58.480]  the makers, Chris Carter, with ex-files and lone gummins, said, yes, they're giving us
[39:58.480 --> 39:59.640]  these plots.
[39:59.640 --> 40:03.720]  Why is the government giving them plots and saying there'll be a war with Russia started
[40:03.720 --> 40:09.960]  up in Ossetia, the very place it happened, this tiny enclave of a million people?
[40:09.960 --> 40:12.160]  This will happen in 2008, and then it happens.
[40:12.160 --> 40:13.160]  Yeah.
[40:13.160 --> 40:17.880]  And then it's the US preemptively running the attack with the Georgians as their front.
[40:17.880 --> 40:22.160]  And there's a ton of promotion in the game for things like the United Nations and NATO,
[40:22.160 --> 40:27.400]  you know, again, promoting world government, preconditioning the populace and our military
[40:27.400 --> 40:28.880]  to accept that sort of thing.
[40:28.880 --> 40:29.880]  It's normal to them.
[40:29.880 --> 40:32.960]  You know, they have been preconditioned now, Alex, for this large conflict.
[40:32.960 --> 40:37.080]  And let's hope the rest of the game doesn't come through, because this is a larger Russian
[40:37.080 --> 40:38.080]  conflict.
[40:38.080 --> 40:39.080]  This only spans larger.
[40:39.080 --> 40:40.080]  I mean, it only gets larger.
[40:40.080 --> 40:44.760]  Well, everybody's watching in the scores of nations that ring the former Soviet Union
[40:44.760 --> 40:49.960]  where NATO and the international community using US taxpayer money, we can't just say
[40:49.960 --> 40:55.120]  it's the US doing this, have moved in everywhere and have moved weapons systems in, missile
[40:55.120 --> 40:56.440]  systems, radar systems.
[40:56.440 --> 41:01.320]  They've been giving them tanks, helicopters, jets, and Russia continues to stay.
[41:01.320 --> 41:02.320]  Stop it.
[41:02.320 --> 41:03.320]  Stop it.
[41:03.320 --> 41:04.320]  Stop it.
[41:04.320 --> 41:07.920]  Meanwhile, US deplores Russian action in Georgian conflict.
[41:07.920 --> 41:11.040]  The White House said Sunday that it deplores Russian actions in the Georgia conflict is
[41:11.040 --> 41:12.800]  dangerous and disproportionate.
[41:12.800 --> 41:16.880]  Where alarm of the situation says James Jeffrey, US President George W. Bush's deputy national
[41:16.880 --> 41:21.320]  security adviser told reporters in Beijing where the president was attending the Olympics.
[41:21.320 --> 41:25.200]  Jeffrey said the United States would be very, very concerned if reports around Russian ground
[41:25.200 --> 41:27.080]  attacks in Georgia were accurate.
[41:27.080 --> 41:31.320]  See, and you read that article, they just leave out that Georgia attacked them and is
[41:31.320 --> 41:32.400]  still attacking them.
[41:32.400 --> 41:35.040]  It's like, how dare Russia be involved?
[41:35.040 --> 41:41.000]  Now let's not forget, at the end of the last Serb conflict when Clinton had the Muslims
[41:41.000 --> 41:48.800]  out of Albania attack the Slavs in the Slavic state of Serbia fight back, the media then
[41:48.800 --> 41:53.080]  said that Serbia had premeditatedly attacked Kosovo, which was part of Serbia, which is
[41:53.080 --> 41:54.080]  ridiculous.
[41:54.080 --> 42:02.640]  Then, there was the head of NATO, General Jackson, gets a call, and Wesley Clark has
[42:02.640 --> 42:07.720]  ordered US fighter bombers to bomb Russian troops who tried to take over and landed at
[42:07.720 --> 42:09.920]  the airport in Pristina, in Kosovo.
[42:09.920 --> 42:16.840]  Okay, it's back in the late 90s, and Clark had given the order to attack Russian forces
[42:16.840 --> 42:17.840]  with bombers.
[42:17.840 --> 42:21.320]  The Russians peacefully landed, took over the capital and said, you're not going to take
[42:21.320 --> 42:24.640]  part of Serbia and give it to Muslims.
[42:24.640 --> 42:27.680]  And the crazy part about this is, we're fighting the Muslims, we're fighting, no, no.
[42:27.680 --> 42:31.960]  They used the Muslims as the shock troops to take over country after country after country
[42:31.960 --> 42:35.680]  in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East.
[42:35.680 --> 42:40.440]  They overthrew secular nations in the Middle East using Muslims, so it was the same story,
[42:40.440 --> 42:44.400]  and back under Bill Clinton, they tried to launch an attack on Russians.
[42:44.400 --> 42:47.040]  Folks, we don't want to go to war with Russia.
[42:47.040 --> 42:53.240]  Okay, I mean, I know everybody's disconnected from reality in La La Land, but this is just
[42:53.240 --> 42:56.120]  absolutely insane, Jason.
[42:56.120 --> 43:00.800]  It is absolutely insane, and before the show, we were discussing motivation, and I can't
[43:00.800 --> 43:05.160]  help but think this is really to demonize Russian, maybe take the focus off of us as
[43:05.160 --> 43:10.440]  a world power in the Middle East, maybe take the focus off of us as being the sole problem
[43:10.440 --> 43:11.440]  in the world.
[43:11.440 --> 43:12.440]  And not just that.
[43:12.440 --> 43:17.240]  Two more, there's already two there, carrier attack groups are rampaging into the Gulf
[43:17.240 --> 43:22.200]  right now, according to the AP and Jerusalem Post, in a preparation to attack Iran.
[43:22.200 --> 43:25.320]  So it's getting Russia tied up in a conflict ahead of that.
[43:25.320 --> 43:28.480]  This could shape into World War III, we'll be right back.
[43:28.480 --> 43:32.560]  Hey, everybody, if you're anything like me, I'll bet you like to eat.
[43:32.560 --> 43:39.560]  I like egg scrambles for breakfast, fresh homemade bread, delicious pastas like lasagna,
[43:39.560 --> 43:41.160]  I love beef stroganoff.
[43:41.160 --> 43:46.880]  I love chicken noodle soup, I love desserts, all kinds of entrees and soups and desserts
[43:46.880 --> 43:49.160]  and breakfast, I love that stuff.
[43:49.160 --> 43:52.520]  Now food prices are skyrocketing just like gasoline prices.
[43:52.520 --> 43:56.640]  I mean, the gasoline prices have gone insanely high, probably going to go higher, grocery
[43:56.640 --> 44:00.080]  prices are right on their heels, how are people going to be able to afford to eat?
[44:00.080 --> 44:05.240]  Well, I found a way to buy really incredible foods like I just described at half the price
[44:05.240 --> 44:07.000]  of last year's grocery bill.
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.840]  For less than half of what you spent for the same amount of food last year, I can have

[46:28.600 --> 46:29.600]  It's a fact.
[46:29.600 --> 46:33.520]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States
[46:33.520 --> 46:37.040]  create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[46:37.040 --> 46:40.720]  With never ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates,
[46:40.720 --> 46:45.160]  it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to
[46:45.160 --> 46:46.160]  our creditors.
[46:46.160 --> 46:50.480]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney backed program to legally
[46:50.480 --> 46:54.680]  eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit and other unsecured debts
[46:54.680 --> 46:56.960]  which have been fraudulently created by the banks.

[47:01.120 --> 47:03.360]  ending with nothing on your credit report.

[47:22.360 --> 47:25.000]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[47:25.000 --> 47:45.120]  Visit fdrs.org today.
[47:45.120 --> 47:50.360]  I have scanned hundreds of newspapers and even the Washington Post is not reporting on the
[47:50.360 --> 47:55.720]  fact that Georgian backed U.S. backed forces attacked Russia Thursday night on the eve
[47:55.720 --> 47:56.720]  of the Olympics.
[47:56.720 --> 48:01.320]  Knowing that would be a smokescreen, U.S. troops are reportedly involved in the attack mass
[48:01.320 --> 48:08.440]  murdering Russian troops and civilians, but the Austin American statesmen did get it right.
[48:08.440 --> 48:13.480]  They have a bunch of diversions here about unlicensed bus, carried 15 to their deaths,
[48:13.480 --> 48:19.040]  the Olympics, but then under it, Russia, Georgia had a brink of war, hundreds die, it's now
[48:19.040 --> 48:21.040]  over 2,000 alone in one city.
[48:21.040 --> 48:26.240]  As breakaway Georgian province, AP, Russia dispatched an armored column to the breakaway
[48:26.240 --> 48:31.560]  Georgian enclave of South Ossetia on Friday after Georgians, a U.S. ally launched a surprise
[48:31.560 --> 48:35.560]  offensive against South Ossetian separatists, witnesses that hundreds of civilians were
[48:35.560 --> 48:36.560]  killed.
[48:36.560 --> 48:40.560]  Let me read that again, Georgia launched a surprise offensive.
[48:40.560 --> 48:45.360]  Now remember, this is a demilitarized zone, these are areas that have always been part
[48:45.360 --> 48:51.960]  of Russia, two large enclaves, nothing violent was going on, there has not been any fighting
[48:51.960 --> 49:00.360]  since 1992, Russian troops have been there in the 90 plus percent Russian enclave, and
[49:00.360 --> 49:05.320]  Georgia launches an attack to drive them out.
[49:05.320 --> 49:09.160]  Now people are asking what is all this about, why is this happening?
[49:09.160 --> 49:15.200]  The pipeline war, Russia bear goes for West jugular, UK daily mail, and of course BP owns
[49:15.200 --> 49:21.560]  that pipeline, they mention that later in the article, so again still a deceptive headline
[49:21.560 --> 49:23.280]  like Russia went for something.
[49:23.280 --> 49:27.440]  That's like if you get mugged, an old lady is getting mugged and she beats the guy away
[49:27.440 --> 49:32.400]  from her with her cane or with her umbrella, is the headline old lady attacks innocent
[49:32.400 --> 49:33.400]  man?
[49:33.400 --> 49:39.760]  No, it's old lady attacks mugger, but again Georgia has today withdrawn its troops from
[49:39.760 --> 49:45.400]  the capital of South Ossetia according to reports, and says a day after heightened international
[49:45.400 --> 49:49.720]  tensions, talks about the Russians trying to bomb the pipeline, let's go ahead and take
[49:49.720 --> 49:50.720]  some phone calls.
[49:50.720 --> 49:53.200]  Before we do that, Barman say anything else you want to add?
[49:53.200 --> 49:57.840]  Not really, I was just looking at this other story where it's now come out a CIA officer
[49:57.840 --> 50:03.560]  has said that Cheney likely ordered the forgery of the Iraq 9-11 letter, the one where they
[50:03.560 --> 50:06.640]  tried to say Muhammad Ata had met with them.
[50:06.640 --> 50:11.480]  Well maybe Cheney is reporting it's not likely, the CIA guy has said they were ordered to false
[50:11.480 --> 50:13.520]  file a letter saying Iraq launched the enter.
[50:13.520 --> 50:19.000]  Yeah, and Douglas Faith is the guy who wrote it up, I mean it's unbelievable that these
[50:19.000 --> 50:24.000]  criminals still walk around and are just adored by the public Alex, it makes me sick.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.840]  Well they're not adored by the public, it's an illusion that the public adores it, but
[50:27.840 --> 50:28.840]  man.
[50:28.840 --> 50:30.440]  I guess there's 25% that does.
[50:30.440 --> 50:33.800]  Yeah, and I feel like those that don't adore them aren't doing enough to get them out of
[50:33.800 --> 50:36.160]  power or bring them to justice, it's few and far between.
[50:36.160 --> 50:40.120]  Just come out, they ordered Robert Mueller, head of the FBI to blame the anthrax attacks
[50:40.120 --> 50:44.360]  on Iraq knowing of course they launched the attacks, they were on the separate drug that
[50:44.360 --> 50:45.880]  fought it and all the rest of the evidence.
[50:45.880 --> 50:46.880]  Prior to it being released.
[50:46.880 --> 50:53.120]  They've ordered the CIA to create fake documents with Muhammad Ata and Iraq and it just comes
[50:53.120 --> 50:57.680]  out, I mean it just came out mainstream news last week that Cheney wanted to stage attacks
[50:57.680 --> 51:00.360]  on our ships, I mean you know.
[51:00.360 --> 51:01.360]  They're cold-blooded killers.
[51:01.360 --> 51:04.000]  But a lot of the public who does support this thinks they're part of the elite and they're
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  part of the system.
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.840]  Now they're going to take your pension funds, your freedom, your dollar, your future too.
[51:08.840 --> 51:11.480]  You're not part of the elite, this criminal group's going to hurt you as well.
[51:11.480 --> 51:13.320]  And don't think Barack Obama's going to save you.
[51:13.320 --> 51:16.000]  I don't know who's first up here, who should I go to first?
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.880]  Let's go to line one, Jesse in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead Jesse.
[51:20.880 --> 51:22.560]  Hey, what's up Alex?
[51:22.560 --> 51:24.880]  On a worldwide radio show.
[51:24.880 --> 51:30.560]  Alright, I've been drinking or something there.
[51:30.560 --> 51:32.680]  Kevin in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[51:32.680 --> 51:33.880]  How you doing Alex?
[51:33.880 --> 51:34.880]  Good.
[51:34.880 --> 51:37.880]  I'm going to say as soon as you're calling us about that audit that's coming up on September
[51:37.880 --> 51:42.320]  30th from the International Bank of Settlement, I knew this was going to happen.
[51:42.320 --> 51:46.800]  I mean we had this on September 10th when they announced the $2.3 trillion missing and
[51:46.800 --> 51:47.800]  they needed the shot.
[51:47.800 --> 51:51.320]  That's right, the AP reported that someone in the Pentagon stole $1.9 trillion, it's
[51:51.320 --> 51:56.360]  now $3.9 trillion from all the military pension funds are gone and then they stage 9-11,
[51:56.360 --> 51:58.240]  two days after that came out.
[51:58.240 --> 52:01.360]  And yeah, the whole world is headed towards crises right now.
[52:01.360 --> 52:05.240]  I apologize I have an ambulance passing by.
[52:05.240 --> 52:07.760]  I can't understand you, but go ahead.
[52:07.760 --> 52:11.680]  I think it's thanks to you though that they have to at least basically start these kind
[52:11.680 --> 52:15.880]  of aggressions now and not try and pull another 9-11 because there's too many people that
[52:15.880 --> 52:21.080]  have woken up now, thanks to efforts like yours and a lot of others, but they can't
[52:21.080 --> 52:22.080]  get away with this.
[52:22.080 --> 52:26.040]  We're not going to tolerate another inside job.
[52:26.040 --> 52:28.560]  I mean I'm already packing in myself Alex.
[52:28.560 --> 52:29.880]  I hope they, I hear you.
[52:29.880 --> 52:33.840]  I hope they don't stage some new event to get us into war with Iran.
[52:33.840 --> 52:36.480]  I mean now they're going to have four aircraft carrier groups there.
[52:36.480 --> 52:40.520]  They're sending two more talking about attacking them during October.
[52:40.520 --> 52:41.720]  I mean this is insane.
[52:41.720 --> 52:45.080]  Meanwhile, Pakistan's been given nukes by our criminal government.
[52:45.080 --> 52:46.580]  Thank you so much Kevin.
[52:46.580 --> 52:48.320]  Let's talk to Josh in North Carolina.
[52:48.320 --> 52:50.160]  You're on the air worldwide Josh.
[52:50.160 --> 52:53.600]  Hey Alex, good to talk to you.
[52:53.600 --> 52:56.720]  So I have a couple points I'd like to raise.
[52:56.720 --> 53:00.760]  I had some discussions with some friends of mine in the intelligence community and some
[53:00.760 --> 53:02.560]  of the things I'd like to raise.
[53:02.560 --> 53:09.280]  First off, some of the reasons I've heard for why they did this is to test the Russian
[53:09.280 --> 53:11.480]  force and to test their Russian response.
[53:11.480 --> 53:18.520]  A couple other interesting points, since the fall of the Soviet Union, they've been quite
[53:18.520 --> 53:23.880]  successful in Russia in weeding out a lot of the CIA agents from higher places within
[53:23.880 --> 53:24.880]  their government.
[53:24.880 --> 53:28.840]  Also, it's turned out a bunch of the oligarchs they've arrested that stole all of Russian's
[53:28.840 --> 53:32.520]  wealth after it fell, turns out are British or Rothschild agents, according to the Times
[53:32.520 --> 53:33.520]  of London.
[53:33.520 --> 53:34.520]  Exactly.
[53:34.520 --> 53:35.520]  Right.
[53:35.520 --> 53:40.560]  So from what I have been told and what I understand at this point, they have a better
[53:40.560 --> 53:45.200]  idea of what we are capable of than we do them.
[53:45.200 --> 53:46.200]  The other point that they did-
[53:46.200 --> 53:48.400]  Well by the way, we keep using the term we.
[53:48.400 --> 53:49.400]  It's not our government.
[53:49.400 --> 53:50.600]  It's not our military anymore.
[53:50.600 --> 53:54.260]  It's been used to printively attack Russia and they think the American people are so
[53:54.260 --> 53:56.880]  dumb they tell us Russia did this.
[53:56.880 --> 53:59.760]  Exactly, which is really, really sad.
[53:59.760 --> 54:00.760]  Agreed there.
[54:00.760 --> 54:04.320]  Yeah, that's the big story here, is that I talk to the public everywhere and they think
[54:04.320 --> 54:06.320]  Russia attacked out of a clear blue sky.
[54:06.320 --> 54:08.720]  No, I've run into quite a few people.
[54:08.720 --> 54:12.520]  I've even actually run into somebody who thought it was the state of Russia like you've
[54:12.520 --> 54:13.520]  joked about.
[54:13.520 --> 54:14.520]  So I was-
[54:14.520 --> 54:15.520]  The state of Georgia, you mean?
[54:15.520 --> 54:16.520]  Exactly.
[54:16.520 --> 54:18.960]  Oh, you ran into someone that thought the Russians had attacked America?
[54:18.960 --> 54:19.960]  Yeah, they did.
[54:19.960 --> 54:20.960]  It was pretty funny.
[54:20.960 --> 54:22.480]  Was it Miss South Carolina?
[54:22.480 --> 54:24.320]  I'm in North Carolina, so-
[54:24.320 --> 54:25.760]  No, I mean, remember her?
[54:25.760 --> 54:27.800]  Let's pull up Miss South Carolina.
[54:27.800 --> 54:30.600]  Pull her up or she just doesn't even know what side of the planet she's on.
[54:30.600 --> 54:32.680]  Well, no, I mean, that's what's happening.
[54:32.680 --> 54:39.040]  Meanwhile, it's also a diversion, you know, launched during the Olympics, a diversion
[54:39.040 --> 54:41.160]  for the attack on Iran.
[54:41.160 --> 54:43.720]  That's exactly the point I was about to bring up.
[54:43.720 --> 54:49.400]  They're hoping that they can possibly divert Russian attention away from the attack that
[54:49.400 --> 54:51.360]  is about to occur in Iran.
[54:51.360 --> 54:56.320]  In my opinion, it's a very stupid gamble and may very well, like you've mentioned, lead
[54:56.320 --> 54:57.320]  to World War III.
[54:57.320 --> 54:59.680]  Well, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[54:59.680 --> 55:03.820]  I mean, I've got the mainstream news here of the Russian foreign minister threatening
[55:03.820 --> 55:08.560]  military action against Western Europe and the United States, but let me just dig it
[55:08.560 --> 55:09.560]  out here.
[55:09.560 --> 55:12.520]  Russia threatens military response to U.S. missile defense deal.
[55:12.520 --> 55:14.000]  When you read into-
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.680]  There's a bunch of reports going back over the last six months where they keep saying
[55:16.680 --> 55:19.840]  it, including using their nuclear arsenal.
[55:19.840 --> 55:22.080]  Hell, you know, the neocons don't care.
[55:22.080 --> 55:23.080]  Yeah.
[55:23.080 --> 55:24.080]  Here's-
[55:24.080 --> 55:29.600]  Russian polls have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the U.S. on a world map.
[55:29.600 --> 55:32.760]  Why do you think this is?
[55:32.760 --> 55:41.960]  I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out there
[55:41.960 --> 55:49.200]  in our nation don't have that, and I believe that our education, like such as South Africa
[55:49.200 --> 55:56.440]  and the Iraq everywhere, like such as, and I believe that they should- our education
[55:56.440 --> 56:02.360]  over here in the U.S. should help the U.S. or should help South Africa and should help
[56:02.360 --> 56:08.600]  Iraq and the Asian countries, so we will be able to build up our future for our children.
[56:08.600 --> 56:09.920]  And listen, we make fun of her.
[56:09.920 --> 56:11.920]  That's the average American.
[56:11.920 --> 56:14.680]  And I told you, I mean, I've seen websites and news reports.
[56:14.680 --> 56:17.040]  They think Russia attacked Georgia.
[56:17.040 --> 56:21.560]  Not only was it not Russia that attacked Georgia and the Caucasus, they're on the Black Sea.
[56:21.560 --> 56:27.080]  They're on the eastern side of the Black Sea bordering Russia, but they believe Georgia,
[56:27.080 --> 56:30.000]  with Georgia peaches, in the South was attacked.
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.120]  You know, Robert E. Lee, all that stuff, and I mean, you know, you can't help them.
[56:33.120 --> 56:38.560]  You know, they think George Bush is a conservative, Barack Obama's a good guy.
[56:38.560 --> 56:42.840]  Well, Alex, there's different levels of propaganda for everybody.
[56:42.840 --> 56:48.440]  For instance, the John Edward story was really big to try to get the politicos away from
[56:48.440 --> 56:52.280]  this story of Russia attacking Georgia, Georgia really attacking Russia.
[56:52.280 --> 56:56.960]  I heard a hardcore quote, Patriot shows, Friday, they weren't even covering this in Georgia.
[56:56.960 --> 56:57.960]  Yeah, it's insane.
[56:57.960 --> 57:01.120]  They were talking about he has sex with some woman.
[57:01.120 --> 57:06.480]  And on the other level, for the even dumb down masses, even more dumb down, it's Bernie
[57:06.480 --> 57:09.000]  Mack and now Isaac Hayes have died two celebrities.
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.160]  So there's two celebrity deaths this week.
[57:11.160 --> 57:12.880]  The media will run with that all week.
[57:12.880 --> 57:16.680]  Friday night, you saw it on Yahoo, you showed me at the office, the top stories where John
[57:16.680 --> 57:22.640]  Edward's celebrity heritage and some, the car wreck, day three of the guy in Batman.
[57:22.640 --> 57:23.640]  Yes.
[57:23.640 --> 57:24.640]  Yeah.
[57:24.640 --> 57:25.640]  Morgan Freeman, that's right.
[57:25.640 --> 57:26.640]  He was in a car wreck.
[57:26.640 --> 57:31.240]  They love this filtered, celebrity entertainment news that just mesmerizes people.
[57:31.240 --> 57:37.320]  Well, folks, the country is in trouble when the United States back forces, now they're
[57:37.320 --> 57:43.200]  reporting dead US troops attack Russia, premeditated out of a clear blue sky, terrorist attack.
[57:43.200 --> 57:45.320]  And they just tell you that it's the other way around.

[1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:36.400]  I'm Judy Jordan.
[1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:40.800]  Russia is expanding its bombing blitz against neighboring Georgia, targeting the country's
[1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:42.680]  capital for the first time.
[1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:47.280]  Meanwhile, Georgian troops are pulling out of the breakaway province of South Ossetia,
[1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:48.840]  as Russia has demanded.
[1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:53.720]  The Moscow says it now needs to verify the withdrawal before it will negotiate a ceasefire.
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:57.200]  And the White House is urging both sides to stop fighting.
[1:00:57.200 --> 1:00:58.200]  Here's Mark Smith.
[1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:02.920]  Whether or not Georgia was right to send troops into South Ossetia to retake control of the
[1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:07.680]  breakaway region, Presbyterian Dana Perino says it was wrong of Russia to hit back with
[1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:11.440]  air attacks and armor columns that went far beyond the disputed enclave.
[1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:14.240]  President Bush does think that the Russian response has been disproportionate.
[1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:19.200]  The White House warns that those attacks don't stop Russia's ties with America will be harmed.
[1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:23.560]  The president's spoken twice to Vladimir Putin here in Beijing, though Perino won't comment
[1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:26.760]  on reports the two argued at the Olympic opening ceremonies.

[1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:34.520]  In a meeting with the Chinese President today, President Bush praised the country for its
[1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:40.720]  swift response to a stabbing attack that killed the father of a 2004 U.S. Olympian while the
[1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:43.400]  man was visiting a historic site.

[1:02:55.120 --> 1:02:58.040]  terrorists, and come up empty, though the check continues.

[1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:13.640]  Curtis Gaines is a political analyst.
[1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:25.000]  If she's refusing DNA testing, he is presumed innocent until DNA proves him the father.

[1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:13.280]  fatal stabbing of the coach's father-in-law.
[1:04:13.280 --> 1:04:18.520]  We all came here to do this and it's very hard to continue on, but obviously our first

[1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:33.680]  melody.

[1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:38.600]  Phelps says seeing President Bush was a thrill.
[1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:39.600]  It was cool.
[1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:44.440]  I looked up and, you know, he weighed the flag and nodded his head and that was pretty
[1:04:44.440 --> 1:04:45.440]  cool.
[1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:49.480]  You know, pretty cool feeling to have the President say congratulations and then have

[1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:04.640]  More on Friday's Texas bus accident that killed at least 16 people.
[1:05:04.640 --> 1:05:09.560]  Police emergency call tapes released show a scene of panic and chaos with screams and
[1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:13.080]  moans heard over phone calls reporting the wreck.
[1:05:13.080 --> 1:05:16.560]  Debbie Hearnsman is with the National Transportation Safety Board.
[1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:24.760]  At the time of the accident, neither company was operating legally in interstate bus commerce.
[1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:29.440]  I'm Jody Jordan and that's news from the Information Radio Network.
[1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:34.440]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, we need radical change if we're to avert becoming
[1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:36.120]  a third world nation.
[1:05:36.120 --> 1:05:40.280]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical natural alternative health

[1:05:48.840 --> 1:05:52.960]  Oregon Electro-Medicine is the wave of the future dating back to the late 1800s.
[1:05:52.960 --> 1:05:57.640]  Wilhelm Reich-Orgon used cloud buster technology that can now be applied in your home for dramatic

[1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:12.440]  Health doesn't need to be expensive or complicated.

[1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:46.720]  Now live from Austin, Texas.
[1:06:46.720 --> 1:07:04.720]  Here's Alex Jones.
[1:07:04.720 --> 1:07:15.120]  I had our regular guest former Wall Street Journal editor, former head of the Treasury
[1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:20.160]  Department, father of economics, Dr. Paul Kirk Roberts on Friday calling this evil criminal
[1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:28.400]  action against Russia in an attempt to attest them for a wider war in Eastern Europe and
[1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:33.800]  Central Asia, United States backed forces of Georgia, premeditatedly Thursday night into
[1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:39.080]  Friday when the Olympics kicked off as a smoke screen viciously attacked a string of towns
[1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:46.200]  and cities in Southern Ossetia, the border with Russia, killing more than 2,000 civilians,
[1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:49.120]  scores of peacekeepers in at least 15 Russian troops.
[1:07:49.120 --> 1:07:53.520]  Russia responded with attacks, but this is an exclusive Dr. Roberts, not going to be
[1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:59.560]  homeless today, but he sent me his story for creator syndicate that will not be out until
[1:07:59.560 --> 1:08:06.160]  tomorrow in newspapers nationwide, and it's a long story, here's even going to some authorization
[1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:08.760]  to post this, but I'm just going to read it.
[1:08:08.760 --> 1:08:14.320]  He said in today, as I write in the liberal Washington Post that has written an editorial
[1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:19.520]  using the US to go to war with Russia, with his editorial stopping Russia as the headline,
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:23.600]  the US and its allies must unite against Moscow's war on Georgia.
[1:08:23.600 --> 1:08:28.760]  The Washington Post has established a world record for maximum number of lives and a number
[1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:33.680]  of single words, number of words, except for the Washington Post, the entire world knows
[1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:39.040]  that Georgia, the birthplace of Joseph Stalin, not Georgia USA, I made the joke with him
[1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:43.600]  on air that he better put in his article that it wasn't Georgia USA, initiated the aggression
[1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:47.880]  that killed Russian peacekeepers and hundreds of civilians just now more than 2,000 in
[1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:53.080]  South Ossetia, peacekeepers who were there for the blessing of Georgia and the international
[1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:56.080]  agreements for more than 10 years since 93.
[1:08:56.080 --> 1:09:00.200]  The true facts are available all over the world press, but the quote liberal Washington
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:07.160]  Post serves up the line that Russia has attacked Georgia and conceivably plans to conquer all
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:08.160]  of Georgia.
[1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:12.480]  This is a grave challenge in the United States and Europe, thunders the Bush regime's mouthpiece
[1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:15.200]  a.k.a. the liberal media.
[1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:19.200]  Thirsting for blood, the liberal media declares the United States and its NATO allies must
[1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:24.800]  together impose a price on Russia, and it goes on.
[1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:26.800]  That's an exclusive, this isn't even out yet.
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:30.640]  I want to go to one of our other contributors who contributes each week, and that's Bob Chapman
[1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:31.840]  of the International Forecaster.
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:37.440]  I will then get to Greg in Fort Worth, Pam in New York, Carl in Canada, Randy in Chicago,
[1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:43.280]  Mike in New Jersey, and others that are holding while Bob Chapman rides shotgun with us.
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:47.880]  Bob Chapman of course worked in intelligence against the Russians, then he became the largest
[1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:53.360]  gold and silver broker in the world and has had the largest financial newsletter out there.
[1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:57.240]  And he is also one of the granddaddies in the movement against fighting the New World Order
[1:09:57.240 --> 1:10:00.560]  the last 50 years, and Bob Chapman joins us.
[1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:06.200]  Bob, since you were on Friday analyzing what was happening, there's been a lot of new developments.
[1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:11.040]  Russia has now sent its fleet in, has been engaging, Georgian ships, the Georgians tried
[1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:18.360]  to attack another area of southern Russia as well.
[1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:24.480]  We have those reports, Abkhazia as well, and they repulsed that attack.
[1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:28.800]  The Georgians, even though they claim to cease fire, are still attacking.
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:34.720]  This is just unbelievable, and most US newspapers are saying Russia attacked Georgia, a new level
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:40.080]  of disregard of the people treating us like complete morons, but I guess we are morons,
[1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:42.080]  so why not?
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:44.000]  Bob Chapman, thanks for coming on with us.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:48.760]  Well, thank you, it's very nice to be here again.
[1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:56.480]  As I said, I guess it was on Thursday, Friday, Friday, that Russia would expand this.
[1:10:56.480 --> 1:10:59.280]  And they had no choice.
[1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:06.040]  The whole climate of relations now have changed severely between Russia, Western Europe, England,
[1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:08.080]  and the United States.
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:14.280]  And everybody who reads into this sort of thing, like Dr. Robertson myself and writes
[1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:17.920]  about it, knows that it's a setup.
[1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:20.400]  They want a Cold War.
[1:11:20.400 --> 1:11:30.120]  They want to divert attention from the horrible economic and financial condition that's going
[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:35.200]  on now in the Western world, and this is a diversion.
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:42.520]  And at the same time, they geopolitically are trying to outflank Russia by, eventually,
[1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:49.680]  hopefully, from the US standpoint, or the neocon standpoint, of bringing NATO into this
[1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:53.840]  whole thing, and NATO into Georgia.
[1:11:53.840 --> 1:12:02.400]  The fact that I got one of my people who does intelligence work for me, has been watching
[1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:12.680]  the satellite out of Moscow, and also a number of reports from Al-Jazeera, however it's
[1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:13.680]  print out.
[1:12:13.680 --> 1:12:14.680]  What is it again?
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:15.680]  Al-Jazeera.
[1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:17.320]  Al-Jazeera.
[1:12:17.320 --> 1:12:26.160]  And they reported long before the President of the United States that over 2,000 people
[1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:31.280]  have been killed, almost all of them civilians, incidentally.
[1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:39.400]  The Blackwater, and I believe it's back Blackwater, that's what they're being called, American
[1:12:39.400 --> 1:12:45.080]  Trainers, and the Israeli Mossad contractors.
[1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:46.080]  That's right.
[1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:50.880]  Israeli publications are reporting since Friday, very proudly, that 1,000 Israeli contractors
[1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:51.880]  are leading the attack.
[1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:53.400]  This is unbelievable.
[1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:54.400]  Right.
[1:12:54.400 --> 1:13:06.200]  And so the next move will be by Russia, that they will totally pacify Georgia, and move
[1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:07.720]  in there.
[1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:16.040]  And then the United States will retaliate, and then Russia will turn their nuclear weapons
[1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:19.840]  westward again toward the United States and Western Europe.
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:22.200]  Well, that's now been announced, actually.
[1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:25.080]  Well, I can't catch it all like you do.
[1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:27.480]  No, no, no, I'm saying that you're correct.
[1:13:27.480 --> 1:13:35.640]  Yeah, I came back early this morning from golfing, and I had 532 emails.
[1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:37.400]  So I had my hands full today.
[1:13:37.400 --> 1:13:42.440]  But the point is that they're gearing up for another war.
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:46.040]  I think right after the election, they're going to go for a draft.
[1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:47.040]  I think there's a good chance of this.
[1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:48.040]  Well, that's what McCain said.
[1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:51.840]  He said, quote, a World War III starts, then we'll need a draft.
[1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:56.880]  And meanwhile, Jerusalem Post, AP reporting, Friday, two U.S. aircraft carriers are indeed
[1:13:56.880 --> 1:14:00.760]  as we reported during the week with rumors from sources that they thought they were
[1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:01.760]  going there.
[1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:05.800]  Now they admit they're going to the Gulf, beefing up the other two task forces that
[1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:06.800]  are there.
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:09.960]  This on the heels of the New Yorker Magazine reporting, Dick Cheney wanted to stage terror
[1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:14.480]  attacks blowing up U.S. ships using Navy SEALs to blame it on Iran.
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:20.360]  How does this attack on Russia feed into the overall plan to attack Iran?
[1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:22.600]  You're still saying you don't think that attacks on.
[1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:26.080]  I don't know that it's part of that.
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:27.080]  It may be.
[1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:32.440]  But I don't have enough intelligence sources to give me the information that that in fact
[1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:33.440]  is so.
[1:14:33.440 --> 1:14:34.440]  Okay.
[1:14:34.440 --> 1:14:35.440]  Let's shift gears.
[1:14:35.440 --> 1:14:36.440]  Go ahead.
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:44.240]  I do know that the entire area in the Mediterranean, as well as off of the Ukraine and in that
[1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:49.160]  entire area, is alive with Russian submarines.
[1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:53.480]  And if the United States thinks that they're going to send a great flow tiller in there
[1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:58.080]  and nothing's going to happen to it, I get news for you if they start fighting me.
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:03.400]  Well, the Russians are already sinking Georgian ships right now.
[1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:04.400]  Right.
[1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:07.640]  But American ships are a different story.
[1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:11.400]  And I think that they're being led right into a trap.
[1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:19.040]  And I noticed that Ukraine said that they were no longer going to allow Russia to use
[1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:26.360]  the facilities on the Black Sea, which they have at least for 17 more years on that property.
[1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:30.880]  And I get news for the Ukraine.
[1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:33.960]  Get used to it because the Russians are going to be there.
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:36.240]  And if you argue, you've got a problem, too.
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:43.000]  You know, people don't understand how vast and the enormous amount of people are in Russia.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:56.520]  And that, you know, I've talked to a former Wehrmacht and SS people in my life of counterintelligence,
[1:15:56.520 --> 1:15:59.280]  some of them who eventually worked for the United States government.
[1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:00.960]  Yeah, when you were in Germany against the Russians.
[1:16:00.960 --> 1:16:01.960]  Right.
[1:16:01.960 --> 1:16:03.440]  Tell me what's, tell me what's, stay there.
[1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:09.440]  We got to go to, well, keep going now, we're going into breaking 30 seconds.
[1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:11.480]  Bob, you were saying, go ahead.
[1:16:11.480 --> 1:16:20.520]  They said that, that, you know, we were better trained and better equipped and our kill ratio
[1:16:20.520 --> 1:16:21.520]  is 20 to 1.
[1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:23.640]  He said, but these people just kept on coming.
[1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:24.640]  All right, stay there.
[1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:29.720]  We're going to come right back with Bob Chapman on the other side, your calls.
[1:16:29.720 --> 1:16:32.920]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial
[1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:33.920]  affairs?
[1:16:33.920 --> 1:16:38.120]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation
[1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:39.640]  of stocks and bonds.
[1:16:39.640 --> 1:16:43.680]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:45.400]  and the pursuit of happiness.
[1:16:45.400 --> 1:16:51.320]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS revenue ruling 6045 of 1984 and
[1:16:51.320 --> 1:16:55.920]  the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933, some
[1:16:55.920 --> 1:16:59.320]  precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[1:16:59.320 --> 1:17:03.240]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading
[1:17:03.240 --> 1:17:05.000]  precious metals privately.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:08.680]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed
[1:17:08.680 --> 1:17:11.600]  them by representatives to give this report out free.
[1:17:11.600 --> 1:17:15.520]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:17.840]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:22.000]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:29.600]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately, 1-800-686-2237.
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:33.440]  It is now time to rein in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:17:33.440 --> 1:17:38.400]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:42.880]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population
[1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:43.880]  of the U.S.
[1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:47.800]  Though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary
[1:17:47.800 --> 1:17:52.640]  responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate
[1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:54.880]  since they reside the world over.
[1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:59.280]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:02.040]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:06.560]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:11.200]  over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning
[1:18:11.200 --> 1:18:14.600]  of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind.
[1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:18.800]  We will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:22.480]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[1:18:22.480 --> 1:18:29.520]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G, them.com, the message of his kingdom.
[1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:30.520]  It's a fact.
[1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:34.800]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create
[1:18:34.800 --> 1:18:39.240]  money out of thin air for every single loan they issue, with never ending late fees over
[1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:43.520]  the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:47.040]  to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:51.400]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally
[1:18:51.400 --> 1:18:55.720]  eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit and other unsecured debts which
[1:18:55.720 --> 1:18:57.840]  have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[1:18:57.840 --> 1:19:02.160]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment,
[1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:04.040]  ending with nothing on your credit report.
[1:19:04.040 --> 1:19:08.000]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:09.520]  eliminated their debt.
[1:19:09.520 --> 1:19:13.240]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life
[1:19:13.240 --> 1:19:14.240]  around.

[1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:38.440]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:43.320]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are

[1:19:51.440 --> 1:19:52.440]  across America.
[1:19:52.440 --> 1:19:56.440]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[1:19:56.440 --> 1:20:00.120]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:01.120]  healthier I feel.
[1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:03.800]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:20:03.800 --> 1:20:09.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventive
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:11.520]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:43.800]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:48.960]  It is August 10th, 2008, United States-backed Georgian forces launched a sneak attack Thursday
[1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:54.520]  night into Friday morning, killing thousands of civilians, mass murdering Russian troops
[1:20:54.520 --> 1:20:59.120]  and other peacekeeping troops in the region they've been in since 1993, which has always
[1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:02.560]  been part of Russia proper.
[1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:06.640]  It's just unbelievable, Bob Chapman is the guy we went to for this because he worked in
[1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:11.720]  counterintelligence in Eastern Europe and Germany during the 1950s when the Cold War was a
[1:21:11.720 --> 1:21:12.720]  lot hotter.
[1:21:12.720 --> 1:21:16.640]  He's also an expert almost having the economy, the international forecaster.com.
[1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:20.320]  We're going to get to Mike and Greg and Pam, Carl, Randy, all of you here in just a few
[1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:21.320]  minutes.
[1:21:21.320 --> 1:21:24.440]  Bob, I'm going to have you ride shotgun with myself and Jason Bernmuss for the rest of
[1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:25.440]  the hour.
[1:21:25.440 --> 1:21:27.080]  We appreciate you being with us.
[1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:34.040]  But just briefly before we get some calls in, A, was this a miscalculation by the delusional
[1:21:34.040 --> 1:21:37.080]  chicken hawk-coward neocons?
[1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:38.280]  Or is this going well for them?
[1:21:38.280 --> 1:21:40.440]  Is this what they thought Russia would do?
[1:21:40.440 --> 1:21:46.360]  A, B, it's all over Russian national TV, international television, Russia today and others.
[1:21:46.360 --> 1:21:53.040]  CNN, that yes, Ukrainian, U.S. special forces, it's admitted in our news that marines, a
[1:21:53.040 --> 1:21:58.680]  thousand marines and others are there, but, quote, advising, but people on the ground
[1:21:58.680 --> 1:22:04.000]  are reporting dead American soldiers, both black Americans and, quote, men in black uniforms
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:06.680]  with U.S. insignia.
[1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:09.680]  You think the Russians are going to grab those bodies and use that for concessions and keep
[1:22:09.680 --> 1:22:10.680]  it secret?
[1:22:10.680 --> 1:22:13.320]  Or is more of that going to be, well, I mean, you heard both the questions.
[1:22:13.320 --> 1:22:15.320]  A, did the globalists miscalculate?
[1:22:15.320 --> 1:22:19.400]  B, what do you think about Americans being involved in this?
[1:22:19.400 --> 1:22:23.080]  I think the neocons have miscalculated.
[1:22:23.080 --> 1:22:29.480]  I think that they thought that the Russians would back up, and I think they're surprised.
[1:22:29.480 --> 1:22:35.520]  Number two, the Russians are collecting the dead, and they're doing DNA samples on them
[1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:46.240]  because they don't know of any Negroes, black people who live in Georgia, and some of them
[1:22:46.240 --> 1:22:54.040]  were quite badly mangled, if you may, and they just wanted to make sure.
[1:22:54.040 --> 1:23:00.000]  And the uniforms, the black uniforms, and we've been told it was black water who was
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:05.080]  in there, they have an American flag on their shoulder.
[1:23:05.080 --> 1:23:08.080]  And that was the insignia that's being talked about.
[1:23:08.080 --> 1:23:13.760]  So you've got 1,000 Marines which really upsets me because I don't think that our troops
[1:23:13.760 --> 1:23:15.440]  should be in there.
[1:23:15.440 --> 1:23:25.040]  You've got over 1,000 Israelis who have been in there for a long time, and you have the
[1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:31.440]  tremendous amount of hardware that was supplied by both the United States and Israel, which
[1:23:31.440 --> 1:23:35.840]  is being used by the Georgian troops.
[1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:40.320]  At this point, I see it as a no-win situation for Georgia.
[1:23:40.320 --> 1:23:44.560]  Well the top Russian general said in the press conference today that no doubt this is US-backed,
[1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:50.880]  US-funded, and that they're, quote, looking at the black uniforms, at the people of African
[1:23:50.880 --> 1:23:56.160]  descent that are dead, and as you said right now, trying to tissue sample that and see
[1:23:56.160 --> 1:23:58.640]  if they're from Eastern Europe.
[1:23:58.640 --> 1:24:09.000]  Exactly, and so I think if the United States moves forward into another war, this will
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:11.320]  be opening up a third front.
[1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:12.320]  By the way, I'm not joking.
[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:16.200]  If you think Hitler was stupid, this guy has got to be out of his skull.
[1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:20.760]  Well the neocons, some of the neocon websites are saying, Russia, I'm not joking, listeners,
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:23.800]  has attacked Georgia, US, as I predicted they would Friday.
[1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:26.760]  That's how dumb they think the public are, Bob.
[1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:31.000]  Yeah, well, I didn't see any bombs go off in Atlanta this week.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:34.480]  Well, they just know the public is completely mindless, and I don't understand.
[1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:35.480]  Unbelievable.
[1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:42.800]  I mean, I just marvel, and you know, this is a mental disease that is not only a priority
[1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:43.800]  of Americans.
[1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:46.440]  I mean, this is all over the world.
[1:24:46.440 --> 1:24:51.200]  I mean, we have subscribers everywhere, and they write us letters telling us, you know,
[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:55.920]  the school system in England is so bad, we don't know what we're going to do.
[1:24:55.920 --> 1:25:01.200]  And the same in Germany, and in South Africa, and on, and on, and on.
[1:25:01.200 --> 1:25:02.200]  And it's all about design.
[1:25:02.200 --> 1:25:04.080]  Let's go to some calls here.
[1:25:04.080 --> 1:25:05.080]  Who is up first?
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:07.400]  Who has been holding the longest?
[1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:10.360]  That would be Greg in Fort Worth, Texas.
[1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:12.160]  Thanks for holding Greg around the air with Bob Chapman.
[1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:13.160]  Hey, Alex.
[1:25:13.160 --> 1:25:14.160]  Hey, Bob.
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:15.160]  Jason, if you're there.
[1:25:15.160 --> 1:25:17.760]  Hey, I just want to say something, guys.
[1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:22.240]  I'm, for the first time in my life, I've been listening to you for a long time, Alex.
[1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:26.040]  For the first time in my life, I've called you, so, and I'm scared.
[1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:27.040]  I really am.
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:29.160]  And I'll tell you why I'm scared.
[1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:33.720]  I have realized, since you've been the guest that you've had on, that there's a lot of
[1:25:33.720 --> 1:25:41.240]  oil up there in Alaska, and it seems to me that blood is more profitable than oil.
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:43.200]  And I think that's what's going on, Bob.
[1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:44.200]  I don't know.
[1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:49.360]  Maybe you can tell me if I'm wrong about that.
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:54.320]  But I'm really, I'm really sick to my stomach right now.
[1:25:54.320 --> 1:25:59.600]  Well, not just oil and blood, but they're saying gas, the UK Daily Mail, turns out BP
[1:25:59.600 --> 1:26:04.520]  owns most of that pipeline, is climbing Russia as a tactic at the pipeline.
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:06.120]  Russia didn't attack anybody.
[1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:08.120]  I understand that.
[1:26:08.120 --> 1:26:09.680]  And they have their own pipeline.
[1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:16.360]  Well, I understand that, but what I'm saying is, is that since we can become energy-independent
[1:26:16.360 --> 1:26:20.640]  with the oil that we have on the northern slopes of Alaska, and we're not doing that,
[1:26:20.640 --> 1:26:24.880]  instead, we're going around and shooting other people, it seems to me that blood must be
[1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:27.000]  more profitable than oil.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  And that scares me.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:29.760]  No, I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:34.760]  For those that don't know, 80% of the oil taken out of Alaska goes to Asia.
[1:26:34.760 --> 1:26:36.520]  So even if they open it up, we're not getting it.
[1:26:36.520 --> 1:26:38.240]  We are the schmucks of the world.
[1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:39.280]  They think we're dumb.
[1:26:39.280 --> 1:26:44.560]  You heard us play Ms. North Carolina earlier, but you were back up again, where she doesn't
[1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:48.920]  even know which country she's in, and they know that's a green light to tyrants to do
[1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:49.920]  whatever they want with us.
[1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:50.920]  We'll play it after the break.
[1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:52.240]  Let's go to another call here.
[1:26:52.240 --> 1:26:54.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to Pam in New York.
[1:26:54.840 --> 1:26:55.840]  Pam, you're on the air.
[1:26:55.840 --> 1:26:56.840]  Hi, Alex.
[1:26:56.840 --> 1:26:57.840]  This is Pam in New York.
[1:26:57.840 --> 1:26:59.840]  I'm glad to talk to you.
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:05.960]  I've been wanting to call in and tell you listeners that I have found a place to watch
[1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:09.240]  the Russian news and the English on the Internet.
[1:27:09.240 --> 1:27:10.800]  Yes, it's Russia today.
[1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:19.760]  Yes, and there's also a place you can go called livestation.com, and you download a small program
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:23.800]  and you can actually watch their live TV right now.
[1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:28.560]  Well, just so you know, we've taken all the most important Russian newscasts, scores of
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:29.560]  them.
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:30.560]  They're all on infowars.com.
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:36.760]  I spent hours this morning watching the reports, getting the best ones boiled down from different
[1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:37.760]  video sources.
[1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:39.360]  We have links of those all up.
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:42.600]  Do you want to see the tanks, the helicopters, the dead bodies?
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:47.160]  Yes, I thought that they're showing this on the Russian TV, Russian, I guess it's like
[1:27:47.160 --> 1:27:48.160]  the Russian CNN.
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:53.960]  They're showing all this, and they also showed an American man that his wife is there visiting
[1:27:53.960 --> 1:28:04.200]  his mother and she was, they're talking genocide, Georgia was genocideing this, what are they
[1:28:04.200 --> 1:28:05.200]  talking about?
[1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:06.200]  No, that's it.
[1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:10.400]  So they attacked Ossetia and other areas and just murdered everybody, and then our media
[1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:13.120]  goes, how dare Russia not like us murdering them all?
[1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:19.800]  Well, he said that we should call all our senators and our congressmen and tell Bush
[1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:28.160]  to back off, get out of Georgia and leave it up, leave it to Russia to take care of
[1:28:28.160 --> 1:28:29.160]  this.
[1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:33.800]  But Georgia's in the USA, the Ruskies attacked it to get the peaches.
[1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:39.280]  No, I hear you, yes, watching Russian TV, you can watch European television, it's all
[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:40.280]  admitted.
[1:28:40.280 --> 1:28:44.320]  And Georgia's still attacking, they keep saying cease fire and then they attack, and
[1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:47.840]  then go, oh, they're attacking us, I mean, watching the Georgian president Friday on
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:49.720]  the news going, we've been attacked for no reason.
[1:28:49.720 --> 1:28:54.760]  Not only that, but he's calling out for American and NATO help, well, he's got it.
[1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:59.520]  It was there beforehand, so it's just deception again and again and again, Alex, it makes
[1:28:59.520 --> 1:29:00.520]  me sick.
[1:29:00.520 --> 1:29:04.640]  And again, folks, we're not defending Russia, all these governments are criminal.
[1:29:04.640 --> 1:29:09.200]  The point is, we don't need our government to be going through surrogates and sneak
[1:29:09.200 --> 1:29:12.320]  attacking Russian military bases.
[1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:16.200]  We don't need our young men and women over there fighting either.
[1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:19.200]  Bob, stay there, I want to come back and talk about whatever you think's most important
[1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:22.400]  with this situation and the economy and more phone calls.
[1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:27.080]  Everybody stay with us, 30 minutes left after this important news.
[1:29:27.080 --> 1:29:30.600]  Hey, Clyde.
[1:29:30.600 --> 1:29:31.600]  What's up, Bonnie?
[1:29:31.600 --> 1:29:35.760]  Well, I got a question about those shielded secure sleeves from Identity Stronghold.
[1:29:35.760 --> 1:29:39.200]  Yeah, the sleeves that block us from stealing account numbers from the new credit cards
[1:29:39.200 --> 1:29:40.720]  with RFID chips.
[1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:41.720]  What about them?
[1:29:41.720 --> 1:29:44.800]  Well, I mentioned them to our friends and they went in for them purchasing the secure
[1:29:44.800 --> 1:29:45.800]  sleeves.
[1:29:45.800 --> 1:29:49.960]  Oh, Bonnie, if everyone starts hearing about the secure sleeve, it'll destroy our plan
[1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:53.240]  to steal credit card numbers at the mall with my new RFID reader.
[1:29:53.240 --> 1:29:56.960]  I know, but these are our friends, Clyde, they promise not to tell anyone else.
[1:29:56.960 --> 1:29:59.960]  I guess you're right, that's what friends are for, I suppose.
[1:29:59.960 --> 1:30:03.400]  Tell them they can get a five-pack of secure sleeves that will fit credit cards and driver's
[1:30:03.400 --> 1:30:05.720]  licenses for $19.95.
[1:30:05.720 --> 1:30:11.080]  And Identity Stronghold also has a three-pack of secure sleeves for passport books for $14.95.
[1:30:11.080 --> 1:30:12.400]  And where do they buy them?
[1:30:12.400 --> 1:30:16.400]  They can buy them online or get a mail-in order form at idstronghold.com.
[1:30:16.400 --> 1:30:17.400]  idstronghold.com.
[1:30:17.400 --> 1:30:20.680]  Okay, well, what if they don't have the internet?
[1:30:20.680 --> 1:30:24.400]  They can call 1-800-610-2770.
[1:30:24.400 --> 1:30:29.480]  Thanks, Clyde.

[1:33:31.840 --> 1:33:46.080]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard hitting talk radio.
[1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:50.920]  On a world map, why do you think this is?
[1:33:50.920 --> 1:34:00.120]  I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out there
[1:34:00.120 --> 1:34:07.320]  in our nation don't have bounce and I believe that our education like such as South Africa
[1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:14.760]  and the Iraq everywhere like such as and I believe that they should our education over
[1:34:14.760 --> 1:34:21.080]  here in the U.S. should help the U.S. or should help South Africa and should help Iraq and
[1:34:21.080 --> 1:34:31.360]  the Asian countries so we will be able to build up our future.
[1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:39.000]  U.S. backed forces in Georgia led by U.S. commandos and mercenaries launched giant terror attacks
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:44.360]  Thursday night against multiple cities and towns and Russian military bases, slaughtering
[1:34:44.360 --> 1:34:52.120]  peacekeepers and cold blood and it's nowhere in the media because you have a population
[1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:57.240]  that on average is about like the lady you just heard, doesn't have a clue about anything.
[1:34:57.240 --> 1:35:03.400]  I mean it's now coming out and we have confirmed cases where high school students will ask
[1:35:03.400 --> 1:35:08.680]  adults where does the sun go at night, is it turning out, I mean I'm not joking here,
[1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:12.760]  they know nothing ladies and gentlemen, they think George Bush is a conservative, they think
[1:35:12.760 --> 1:35:17.440]  Barack Obama is a good guy, I'm about to go back to Bob Chapman and then loaded phone
[1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:22.200]  lines here but Bermas we're not joking about the complete ignorance of large sectors of
[1:35:22.200 --> 1:35:26.320]  the public and we've got the government documents for the last 100 years where they federalized
[1:35:26.320 --> 1:35:28.000]  education and did it by design.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:32.240]  Yeah, maybe people missed that last clip but she was literally saying that school rooms
[1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:36.640]  in the United States didn't have maps and that students didn't have access to maps and
[1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:38.040]  that's why they didn't know where they were.
[1:35:38.040 --> 1:35:42.560]  No, they teach you about political correctness and how to nitty and how to spy on your parents
[1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:47.840]  and how to be a thug and how to snort cocaine in the public schools and how to be mindless
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:49.320]  consumers, that's what you're talking about.
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:52.800]  Yeah, you're taught that you will achieve more if you're part of sports and you go with
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:54.800]  the quote unquote norm.
[1:35:54.800 --> 1:35:57.080]  And how to regurgitate BS out of textbooks.
[1:35:57.080 --> 1:36:01.400]  Yeah, and dress like everybody else, that's basically it, there's little to no education
[1:36:01.400 --> 1:36:03.360]  left in this country, let alone the world.
[1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:07.360]  It's very upsetting Alex, I see it more and more, I know about you.
[1:36:07.360 --> 1:36:11.640]  I guarantee you, Miss South Carolina thinks the Russians attacked Georgia USA.
[1:36:11.640 --> 1:36:16.000]  Yeah, and this is really tough for me, I have a younger sister, I have a little niece and
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:20.960]  to see them grow up in this thing, I mean my younger sister, I feel bad for her, she
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:24.120]  asked me a lot of things and she's like, well they're not teaching me this stuff in school,
[1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:25.120]  where are you getting this from?
[1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:29.520]  And I'm showing her the mainstream news sources and she's like, wow, this is incredible.
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:30.520]  And she's just like...
[1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:33.440]  Yeah, it's all out in the open, like the Houston Chronicle says they built camps for the American
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:34.440]  people.
[1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:35.440]  Yeah.
[1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:38.480]  You tell somebody and they go, there ain't no such thing, where your temple at, it's funny.
[1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:43.120]  Yeah, you know, there's no North American Union, there's no trans-Texas corridor, there's
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:48.160]  no proposal, you know, there's no European Union passing the Lisbon Treaty after it failed.
[1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:50.160]  I mean, they're just going along with it, it doesn't even matter.
[1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:52.280]  They don't even know what a treaty is, it's a good point.
[1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:53.280]  They don't know what a European Treaty is.
[1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:55.960]  They don't know what a conservative talk radio thinks they know what are going on, they're
[1:36:55.960 --> 1:36:58.760]  just another grade of propaganda.
[1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:05.320]  Bob Chapman, again, how do you see this affecting oil prices, what's happened?
[1:37:05.320 --> 1:37:13.720]  Well, I think it can't do anything but make them firmer, it perhaps higher, at least in
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:18.040]  the short term, because nobody knows where this is really going.
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:23.360]  And it is expanding, and there's no question that Russia's going to take over Georgia,
[1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:30.600]  and it's going to spank them, and it's going to absorb the two provinces in North and Georgia,
[1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:36.960]  which is used for centuries with Prado-Russia, and they will become Prado-Russia, and they
[1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:44.040]  probably will tell Georgia that they're not going to have an army anymore either.
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:50.800]  And the opposite of that is, if the U.S. moves in, we're going to lose a number of major
[1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:51.800]  U.S. cities.
[1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:52.800]  It's going to be a nuclear war.
[1:37:52.800 --> 1:37:53.800]  Well, it has been...
[1:37:53.800 --> 1:38:00.560]  Europe will be devastated, and so won't Russia, but it's going to be awful.
[1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:04.840]  There are several reports I've got here of small convoys of NATO forces that were already
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:06.480]  in the country moving north.
[1:38:06.480 --> 1:38:11.440]  I hope they don't do what Wesley Kark tried when he ordered NATO to attack the Russians
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:17.720]  in Serbia, in Pristina, in the capital of Kosovo, and thank God, General Peter Jackson,
[1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:20.000]  the head of NATO, refused that.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  Remember that?
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.200]  Yeah, I certainly do.
[1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:30.400]  Yeah, so everything is called fluid, and we don't know where it's all going to go.
[1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:31.400]  It's all bad.
[1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:33.400]  There's nothing good about it.
[1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:42.120]  Yes, it would tend to make oil prices stronger, and maybe much more so than they should be.
[1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:45.760]  The oil situation is a natural correction.
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:52.480]  There was excessive speculation, not as much as what the CFTC says, but I think it was
[1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:53.480]  about 30 percent.
[1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:58.240]  So a 30 percent haircut would bring it back to somewhere between 1 and 120.
[1:38:58.240 --> 1:38:59.840]  But you said that what happened three months ago.
[1:38:59.840 --> 1:39:02.960]  You said it would go up to about 145, it went up to 149.
[1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:07.560]  Then you said it would go down in the late summer, early fall, but back up next summer
[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:08.560]  to an all-time high.
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:10.040]  Are you still saying that?
[1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:11.040]  Yes.
[1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:14.800]  Yes, and maybe it won't be much of an all-time high.
[1:39:14.800 --> 1:39:17.200]  It all depends on the world's situation.
[1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:19.480]  These things are very difficult to call.
[1:39:19.480 --> 1:39:22.760]  There's so many things going on.
[1:39:22.760 --> 1:39:28.560]  We might have the 82nd Airborne jumping into Georgia tomorrow morning.
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:30.040]  They just don't know.
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:32.480]  Well, that's in the U.S. They want peaches.
[1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:39.040]  Okay, you know, how dare the Russians attack Georgia, the USA Americans such as, such as,
[1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:42.080]  oh my God, I'm joking about Miss South Carolina.
[1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:43.360]  Okay, let's keep going.
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:47.360]  I couldn't even make head in the tail of what she was saying.
[1:39:47.360 --> 1:39:50.720]  I mean, this girl is not too swift.
[1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:51.720]  It's unbelievable.
[1:39:51.720 --> 1:39:52.720]  Let's go ahead.
[1:39:52.720 --> 1:40:00.360]  Incidentally, my daughter teaches school, fortunately, at the fourth grade level.
[1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:08.880]  But they have their nomenclature that they have to follow, but she deviates every time
[1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:12.520]  she can and puts in the kind of information that you and I talk about.
[1:40:12.520 --> 1:40:13.520]  That's right.
[1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:16.280]  The only thing keeping anything going in this country is that there are still good teachers
[1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:20.800]  that break the rules and get off the curricula and start actually teaching.
[1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:22.800]  Carl in Canada, you're on the air.
[1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:23.800]  Go ahead, Carl.
[1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:27.800]  I had a couple of comments regarding that ghost recon.
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:29.960]  Maybe they are going to play this thing out.
[1:40:29.960 --> 1:40:34.320]  You know, if Ukraine gets involved and then Russia could kick out the Georgian government
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:38.600]  and the Ukrainian government and rebuild their empire, then the United States, they will
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:43.240]  have a new felt enemy to replace this war on terror since it's not working.
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:47.080]  Well, they've been saying they want to bring the Cold War back, but let me stop you because
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:48.360]  we talked about that last hour.
[1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:51.960]  Tom Clancy wrote a book about hijackers flying on the World Trade Center a year before.
[1:40:51.960 --> 1:41:00.760]  His ghost recon video game synopsis is where in 2008, this was done in 2001, the US-backed
[1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:06.840]  forces basically clashed with the Russians in the very region where this is now happening
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:08.320]  in South Ossetia.
[1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:10.720]  Bob Chapman, what's that sound like to you?
[1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:15.320]  I guess you've got to hold us on plans that were already put together.
[1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:19.640]  Well, we know that's right around the time US forces were massed there.
[1:41:19.640 --> 1:41:21.960]  Anything else that you want to say?
[1:41:21.960 --> 1:41:22.960]  Carl?
[1:41:22.960 --> 1:41:30.000]  No, I just still wondered if you heard about the stuff that's been forwarded to you from
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:33.320]  the lawyer from the Tehran Times covered my story.
[1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:34.320]  Yes, sir.
[1:41:34.320 --> 1:41:37.840]  I've gotten your emails hundreds of times where you're locked up in jail up in Canada.
[1:41:37.840 --> 1:41:39.160]  I appreciate your call.
[1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:42.760]  I mean, we can just repeat it over and over again, but thank you, sir.
[1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:43.760]  Okay.
[1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:45.160]  Let's jam in another phone call here.
[1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:47.000]  Let's talk to Vinny in New York.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:48.880]  Vinny, you're on the Airworld Live.
[1:41:48.880 --> 1:41:50.440]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[1:41:50.440 --> 1:41:51.440]  Good.
[1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:52.440]  I couldn't believe the story.
[1:41:52.440 --> 1:41:54.680]  I just heard about this ghost recall thing.
[1:41:54.680 --> 1:42:00.200]  I called up the local news station here, News 12, Westchester County, New York, news12.com.
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:04.880]  I spoke to somebody there, and I recently spoke to the guy Henry there about this chemtrail
[1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:05.880]  and all that.
[1:42:05.880 --> 1:42:09.040]  I said, look, you people better wake up because guess what?
[1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:10.640]  I'm not going to be here next year.
[1:42:10.640 --> 1:42:11.640]  Neither are you.
[1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:16.000]  If you don't start telling the facts, I said go to infowars.com and check it out for yourself.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:19.480]  If you want to record this show, I'll send you a copy of it, but I'd better see something
[1:42:19.480 --> 1:42:21.160]  on TV about it.
[1:42:21.160 --> 1:42:22.880]  Well, good.
[1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:27.560]  I'll tell you what, Alex, when you're in your movie, your interview with Aaron Russo,
[1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:31.360]  architecture, prison planner, how they were going to try to take over to Caspian Sea to
[1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:36.680]  put a pipeline in and all that stuff, I mean, you know, that's there for the oil as far
[1:42:36.680 --> 1:42:37.680]  as I'm concerned.
[1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:41.040]  That's what's where I'm looking at it.
[1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:42.040]  I hear you.
[1:42:42.040 --> 1:42:44.160]  They're laughing at me in the control room for people watching on TV.
[1:42:44.160 --> 1:42:45.680]  Fox News keeps calling me.
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:49.800]  I'm on Geraldo Rivera tonight, and they keep calling me over and over again, and I don't
[1:42:49.800 --> 1:42:51.120]  know they're, you never know what they're doing.
[1:42:51.120 --> 1:42:52.360]  I got to call them during the break.
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:55.320]  Now, I hear you absolutely, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[1:42:55.320 --> 1:42:56.520]  I have to multitask.
[1:42:56.520 --> 1:42:58.600]  I have a hundred things going on.
[1:42:58.600 --> 1:43:03.280]  You know, they're now saying it's a conspiracy theory if you say that cell phones radiate
[1:43:03.280 --> 1:43:06.240]  your brain and that we are crazy and wear tinfoil hats.
[1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:09.640]  That's insanity because any time you have a speaker on or you're next to a computer
[1:43:09.640 --> 1:43:12.720]  and the thing rings, you can literally hear the radio wave and frequencies.
[1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:15.600]  Well, no, there's thousands of studies admitting it gives you brain cancer.
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:19.640]  The point is there's now a website saying I'm crazy because I report that cell phones
[1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:22.160]  are bad for your brain that I wear a tinfoil hat.
[1:43:22.160 --> 1:43:24.400]  And what the hell are you people in total denial?
[1:43:24.400 --> 1:43:30.960]  I'm sorry, Georgia is in Russia, not in the U.S.
[1:43:30.960 --> 1:43:35.800]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages
[1:43:35.800 --> 1:43:38.360]  already destroying millions of American families.
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:42.440]  Food for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:46.360]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:52.520]  The only solution is to use now and store for later great flavored super bulk foods that
[1:43:52.520 --> 1:43:56.360]  cost half as much as your groceries cost last year.

[1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:50.080]  I wanted to introduce Jason Bermas, filmmaker on the InfoWars team to the Sunday audience.
[1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:59.760]  He'll be sitting in for a full week when I'm covering the DNC live from that police
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:05.360]  state situation in Denver, the 22nd of the 28th.
[1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:09.280]  He'll be in here on that Sunday as well and I'll be calling him with live reports on the
[1:48:09.280 --> 1:48:10.280]  eBubbitt here.
[1:48:10.280 --> 1:48:12.120]  Next weekend I'll be here for you.
[1:48:12.120 --> 1:48:19.160]  Bob Chapman, the International Forecaster.com is our guest and Bermas plug your website.
[1:48:19.160 --> 1:48:24.440]  It's LooseChange911.com, you've also got your MySpace, very popular websites.
[1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:31.960]  Yeah, LooseChange911.com, I, myself, occasionally Dylan, Corey, and Jonathan from We Are Changed,
[1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:32.960]  Colorado.
[1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:34.680]  I'll put up some blog posts up there every day.
[1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:35.680]  It's a nice little site.
[1:48:35.680 --> 1:48:36.840]  But what's funny about me plugging their website?
[1:48:36.840 --> 1:48:37.840]  Nothing.
[1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:38.840]  Nothing's funny about it.
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:39.840]  It's good.
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:40.840]  Thank you.
[1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:41.840]  Bermas is always a smiley guy.
[1:48:41.840 --> 1:48:42.840]  Yeah, I'm a smiley guy.
[1:48:42.840 --> 1:48:46.360]  On top of that, you're going to see some trailers for Fabled Enemies coming out this week.
[1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:48.720]  After this, you know, me and you are going back to work on that.
[1:48:48.720 --> 1:48:50.320]  And then I'm going to be on Geraldo.
[1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:54.280]  If folks don't say you're a traitor, why are you on Geraldo or why are you on CNN?
[1:48:54.280 --> 1:48:55.280]  They have me on there.
[1:48:55.280 --> 1:48:58.280]  I don't turn it down, you know, they have me on.
[1:48:58.280 --> 1:48:59.280]  Why would you?
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:00.680]  It's a chance for you to expand your audience.
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:03.480]  That's what this is all about, getting the word out, and if we have to break through
[1:49:03.480 --> 1:49:04.480]  the mainstream and use them.
[1:49:04.480 --> 1:49:07.840]  Well, new DC Madam Stuff came out with her lawyer now saying, she said, if I die, they
[1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:08.840]  killed me.
[1:49:08.840 --> 1:49:10.160]  Well, she told me that, too, and on air.
[1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:13.160]  And not only that, but I guess that there's some documents buried somewhere or something.
[1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:14.760]  Yeah, well, I'm supposedly on Geraldo tonight.
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:17.560]  They keep calling me over and over again, and I called them during the break, and yes,
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:19.040]  I'm on there tonight.
[1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:20.040]  And so what?
[1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:21.040]  Okay, here we go.
[1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:22.040]  No, it's a good thing.
[1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:23.040]  Yeah.
[1:49:23.040 --> 1:49:24.040]  I think, I mean, honestly.
[1:49:24.040 --> 1:49:26.760]  I'd rather go on there and talk about Russia being attacked, but Bob Chapman's our guest.
[1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:29.080]  I want to run through a bunch of calls here at the end.
[1:49:29.080 --> 1:49:32.760]  Just have a quick question or comment, and Bob can comment on that.
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:35.440]  Frank, in California, you're on the air worldwide.
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:37.680]  Alex, Bob, great to talk to you.
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:42.000]  This is basically genocide, what Georgia has done, and I agree with Bob.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:43.800]  Georgia didn't attack anybody with peaches.
[1:49:43.800 --> 1:49:45.120]  All right, I think we're joking.
[1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:46.120]  Go ahead.
[1:49:46.120 --> 1:49:48.080]  Well, I agree with what Bob is saying.
[1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:49.080]  This is a prelude.
[1:49:49.080 --> 1:49:53.520]  I think this is a prelude as far as going into Iran, but also, I think, another black
[1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:57.720]  op, so-called terrorist attack in the United States of America, which basically starts
[1:49:57.720 --> 1:50:02.640]  launching the nuclear holocaust and population control, and I want to know what Bob thinks
[1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:03.640]  about that.
[1:50:03.640 --> 1:50:07.200]  I think this is where we start the beginning process of annihilation.
[1:50:07.200 --> 1:50:12.480]  Well, it's a big Brazilian ski who's really running things, openly says he wants to start
[1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:17.720]  World War III by attacking Russia in the Caucasus, and he wrote that in 97 in the Grand
[1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:18.720]  Chess Board.
[1:50:18.720 --> 1:50:19.720]  Bob, and it's happening.
[1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:20.720]  Absolutely.
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:29.080]  And we reported on it, and we follow him extremely closely, and have ever since 69, when they
[1:50:29.080 --> 1:50:34.560]  started to get together, he was one of the guiding lights of the Tri-Lateral Commission.
[1:50:34.560 --> 1:50:35.560]  Presidents don't run anything.
[1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:42.040]  It's these key gophers for the big money deletes, like Brazilian ski, like Henry Kissinger,
[1:50:42.040 --> 1:50:45.320]  Mike, George Schultz.
[1:50:45.320 --> 1:50:49.200]  That's who we watch, ladies and gentlemen, the Lord Rothschild, David Rockefeller.
[1:50:49.200 --> 1:50:54.080]  We watch them very carefully while everybody else sucks their thumbs and watches the Olympics.
[1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:57.760]  Frank in California, we just went to Frank in California.
[1:50:57.760 --> 1:50:59.160]  Let's go to Mike in New Jersey.
[1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:00.160]  Mike, you're on the air.
[1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:02.600]  How are you doing, Alex, and Bob and Jason?
[1:51:02.600 --> 1:51:06.760]  Well, the gentleman that just called us a second was more or less what I was thinking
[1:51:06.760 --> 1:51:11.600]  about, like more or less what war and everything is like you talked about killing 85% of the
[1:51:11.600 --> 1:51:13.120]  population.
[1:51:13.120 --> 1:51:16.920]  And sometimes what I'm thinking is more or less that Russian, United States, and all
[1:51:16.920 --> 1:51:21.280]  the elites, I feel that they more or less, they all work together in one way.
[1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:25.880]  So if you start a war, you're killing the population anyway, but if it does turn out
[1:51:25.880 --> 1:51:32.040]  to be a big disaster and you have all these big people that are full-time billionaires
[1:51:32.040 --> 1:51:36.960]  that are leaving the United States, then you're looking for a disaster to come this way.
[1:51:36.960 --> 1:51:37.960]  Absolutely.
[1:51:37.960 --> 1:51:38.960]  Look.
[1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:42.640]  One of the things that run our country, Bill Clinton and NATO, attacked Serbia through
[1:51:42.640 --> 1:51:47.320]  their Muslim surrogates in Albania, a state up against Kosovo, south of it.
[1:51:47.320 --> 1:51:50.480]  It's the same deal here.
[1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:54.760]  And then once the Russians or the Serbs or anybody else defends themselves, it's, oh
[1:51:54.760 --> 1:51:58.440]  my God, oh, it's so horrible.
[1:51:58.440 --> 1:52:03.760]  Look at those evil Russians or those evil Serbs, or in the case of Iran, the U.S. funded
[1:52:03.760 --> 1:52:08.040]  Saddam and gave him the satellite intel and the advisers to attack Iran, and every American
[1:52:08.040 --> 1:52:11.320]  I talked to thinks Iran attacked Iraq, Bob.
[1:52:11.320 --> 1:52:12.320]  Yeah.
[1:52:12.320 --> 1:52:14.280]  Now that's understandable.
[1:52:14.280 --> 1:52:17.800]  It scares me how dumb down the population has gotten.
[1:52:17.800 --> 1:52:19.800]  Let's go to Randy in Chicago.
[1:52:19.800 --> 1:52:20.800]  You're on the air.
[1:52:20.800 --> 1:52:21.800]  Go ahead.
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:22.800]  Hey, Alex.
[1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:23.800]  How you doing, guys?
[1:52:23.800 --> 1:52:24.800]  Good.
[1:52:24.800 --> 1:52:28.000]  I wanted to add to what Jason's comment at the beginning of the show.
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:32.080]  If they're using gangs as the replace of the method, two of the gangs, you better pay
[1:52:32.080 --> 1:52:37.040]  attention to shattered unions and oil wars.
[1:52:37.040 --> 1:52:42.760]  Yeah, shattered unions where the U.N. sets off a nuke in D.C. to make the U.S. fall to
[1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:44.880]  then bring in I-4 international forces.
[1:52:44.880 --> 1:52:45.880]  Yeah.
[1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:47.920]  Go to YouTube and pull up Shattered Union.
[1:52:47.920 --> 1:52:49.640]  Let's go out of the show with Shattered Union.
[1:52:49.640 --> 1:52:51.280]  Go to YouTube, Shattered Union, get it ready.
[1:52:51.280 --> 1:52:52.280]  It's a two-minute clip.
[1:52:52.280 --> 1:52:53.280]  Go ahead.
[1:52:53.280 --> 1:52:56.680]  And Mckay is going to be the next president for Shattered Union.
[1:52:56.680 --> 1:53:00.200]  He would be the perfect, unpopular one to take out.
[1:53:00.200 --> 1:53:01.200]  God only knows.
[1:53:01.200 --> 1:53:02.200]  I know this.
[1:53:02.200 --> 1:53:06.520]  We're all got front-row seats to arm again, so let's sit back and, you know, enjoy it.
[1:53:06.520 --> 1:53:08.120]  Remember, the government loves you.
[1:53:08.120 --> 1:53:09.120]  Everything's fine.
[1:53:09.120 --> 1:53:10.120]  Okay.
[1:53:10.120 --> 1:53:14.640]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Florida, except my line, phone system's down today,
[1:53:14.640 --> 1:53:15.640]  folks.
[1:53:15.640 --> 1:53:16.640]  So it's all over the map.
[1:53:16.640 --> 1:53:18.520]  Mike is on line seven.
[1:53:18.520 --> 1:53:19.520]  Okay.
[1:53:19.520 --> 1:53:20.520]  Not line six.
[1:53:20.520 --> 1:53:21.520]  Mike, you're on the air.
[1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:22.520]  Go ahead.
[1:53:22.520 --> 1:53:23.520]  Yes.
[1:53:23.520 --> 1:53:24.520]  Hello, Alex.
[1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:27.520]  Why do they keep calling it World War Four?
[1:53:27.520 --> 1:53:29.520]  Is that to sanitize it?
[1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:30.520]  Bob, explain it to them.
[1:53:30.520 --> 1:53:33.520]  I mean, I know they're doing it because of the Cold War.
[1:53:33.520 --> 1:53:34.520]  Yeah.
[1:53:34.520 --> 1:53:35.520]  They call it World War Three.
[1:53:35.520 --> 1:53:38.520]  World War Three, so the Neocons call it World War Four.
[1:53:38.520 --> 1:53:39.520]  Bob?
[1:53:39.520 --> 1:53:47.520]  You know, it all depends on what you count the Iraq-Afghanistan affair.
[1:53:47.520 --> 1:53:50.520]  Is that World War Three or isn't it?
[1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:53.520]  The Neocons call it World War Four.
[1:53:53.520 --> 1:53:56.520]  Zabignou calls it number three.
[1:53:56.520 --> 1:54:03.520]  I personally think he's going to play and try to stay on as president and postpone
[1:54:03.520 --> 1:54:05.520]  the election and use all this.
[1:54:05.520 --> 1:54:08.520]  Why would he have put Director 51 in play last year?
[1:54:08.520 --> 1:54:11.520]  Well, they can see pass that on to another president.
[1:54:11.520 --> 1:54:12.520]  Presidents are just puppets.
[1:54:12.520 --> 1:54:16.520]  They may pass one on to Barack Obama or anybody else, for those that don't know, that makes
[1:54:16.520 --> 1:54:17.520]  the president supreme dictator.
[1:54:17.520 --> 1:54:19.520]  Go read it for yourself.
[1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:21.520]  PDD51, Congress has asked to see it.
[1:54:21.520 --> 1:54:22.520]  They're told, shut your mouth.
[1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:24.520]  You're not allowed to see the full document.
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:25.520]  Appreciate that call.
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:26.520]  Do you guys find Shattered Union?
[1:54:26.520 --> 1:54:27.520]  Good.
[1:54:27.520 --> 1:54:28.520]  Okay, we're going to play that going out.
[1:54:28.520 --> 1:54:30.520]  The two-minute mark, just roll with it.
[1:54:30.520 --> 1:54:33.520]  Let's go ahead now and jam in another call here.
[1:54:33.520 --> 1:54:36.520]  Let's talk to Scott in Georgia.
[1:54:36.520 --> 1:54:39.520]  That's in the United States, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:54:39.520 --> 1:54:40.520]  Go ahead, Scott.
[1:54:40.520 --> 1:54:41.520]  You're on the air.
[1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:42.520]  Yeah.
[1:54:42.520 --> 1:54:44.520]  Thank you for taking my call.
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:45.520]  I was a friend of...
[1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:48.520]  How are you taking the Russian attack right now?
[1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:52.520]  I'm joking because the average American thinks the Russians attacked Georgia, but go ahead.
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:54.520]  No, I know that's probably true.
[1:54:54.520 --> 1:54:57.520]  I feel that they're gauging Russia.
[1:54:57.520 --> 1:55:04.520]  In Catholic prophecy, we know that Russia is going to attack Europe.
[1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:09.520]  And that there won't be anything that the United States can do about it.
[1:55:09.520 --> 1:55:11.520]  Well, how Lindsey and all those guys, and that's Protestant stuff,
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:13.520]  said that they're going to get into fight the Middle East.
[1:55:13.520 --> 1:55:16.520]  Now, I have to say it, at least in the future, shaping up like that.
[1:55:16.520 --> 1:55:17.520]  Appreciate your call.
[1:55:17.520 --> 1:55:19.520]  Final comments on that, Bob Chapman?
[1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:21.520]  Not really, any.
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:25.520]  Again, we don't know which way this whole thing's going to go.
[1:55:25.520 --> 1:55:29.520]  All we know is that the bad stuff's in place.
[1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:31.520]  And let's see what happens.
[1:55:31.520 --> 1:55:36.520]  I think the Russians are going to take over, and I think the U.S. is going to back off.
[1:55:36.520 --> 1:55:37.520]  All right.
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:38.520]  I hope that's the case.
[1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:42.520]  We're going to have an escalation here that could potentially move into a worldwide conflict.
[1:55:42.520 --> 1:55:44.520]  Bob Chapman, the internationalforecaster.com.
[1:55:44.520 --> 1:55:45.520]  Thanks for joining us.
[1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:46.520]  Thank you.
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:47.520]  Bye-bye.
[1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:52.520]  Folks, September 1st, fabled enemies is coming out, produced by me, directed and written by Bernmuss.
[1:55:52.520 --> 1:55:55.520]  Rob Jacobson and Aaron Dice are the great job editing.
[1:55:55.520 --> 1:55:57.520]  I want to thank our old team on that during the weekday show.
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:56:01.520]  I'll be covering us all at infoawards.com and back here next Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[1:56:01.520 --> 1:56:08.520]  Yeah, here's another one of the video games where they throw in your face what are actually in federal plans and different think tank operations that we've seen.
[1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:09.520]  Here it is.
[1:56:09.520 --> 1:56:14.520]  We'll go out of the show with the video game ad for Shattered Union.
[1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:26.520]  Following a disputed election and a tie vote, the US Congress installs the most unpopular president in US history as David Jefferson Adams becomes the 44th president of the United States.
[1:56:26.520 --> 1:56:36.520]  Shortly after the election, increased unrest, rioting and a growing number of militias have given rise to ever-increasing domestic terrorism.
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:44.520]  In response, the president invokes the Homeland Security Act and declares martial law on the West Coast and other areas of the country.
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:53.520]  Though highly contested, a Supreme Court ruling sidesteps the electoral process disqualifying popular presidential candidates from several states.
[1:56:53.520 --> 1:57:02.520]  Public outrage explodes when a sham election leads to incumbent David Adams accepting a second term in office.
[1:57:02.520 --> 1:57:14.520]  During the 57th Inauguration Day ceremonies, Washington DC is struck by a low-yield nuclear weapon killing David Adams and most of the US Congress.
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:21.520]  The destruction of Washington DC effectively breaks the chain of succession, sending the nation into chaos.
[1:57:21.520 --> 1:57:30.520]  In an emergency vote, the European Union deploys peacekeepers in the greater DC area to secure international interests.
[1:57:30.520 --> 1:57:38.520]  With separatist sentiment rising, California's governor declares home rule and secedes from the Union.
[1:57:38.520 --> 1:57:47.520]  Texas follows quickly and declares sovereignty, taking neighboring states with them and forming the Republic of Texas.
[1:57:47.520 --> 1:57:55.520]  Now, the once-United States of America lie in ruin.
[1:57:55.520 --> 1:58:06.520]  The time for words has passed and the Second American Civil War now erupts as seven factions wage war across the land.
[1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:13.520]  We're out of here, ladies and gentlemen. God bless you. We'll see you at infowars.com. End of transmission.
[1:58:13.520 --> 1:58:19.520]  Build this shattered Union.
