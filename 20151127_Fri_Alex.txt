[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he

[00:35.120 --> 00:41.280]  descended upon America we're gonna show you some of the much-expected brawling and
[00:41.280 --> 00:46.320]  rioting over Darth Vader toasters and vegetable steamers that we're seeing in
[00:46.320 --> 00:51.000]  balls and stores across America today we're also going to be taking your calls
[00:51.000 --> 00:58.880]  at 800 259 92 31 that's 800 259 92 31 two guests lined up as well and these will
[00:58.880 --> 01:04.440]  be extremely interesting interviews first up Christopher Murphy this is the
[01:04.440 --> 01:09.560]  lawyer for Gregory Allen Elliot who is the artist from Toronto and we've talked
[01:09.560 --> 01:15.280]  about this story before who faces six months in prison for disagreeing with
[01:15.280 --> 01:21.040]  feminists on Twitter that was the sum of his crime his life has been completely
[01:21.040 --> 01:25.440]  ruined he's desperately trying to raise money to pay this hundred thousand
[01:25.440 --> 01:30.480]  dollar court bill and this has this has got huge implications force free speech
[01:30.480 --> 01:34.720]  not just in Canada but on the internet in general for everyone they're trying to
[01:34.720 --> 01:39.360]  create the precedent where harassing a feminist which in their mind is
[01:39.360 --> 01:44.560]  disagreeing with them is a form of harassment that you can be put away for
[01:44.560 --> 01:49.640]  for six months so that's gonna be a huge interview also CJ Pearson you've
[01:49.640 --> 01:53.040]  probably seen him in the media before over the past few months this is the
[01:53.040 --> 01:57.680]  black teen conservative activists who has already been making waves with his
[01:57.680 --> 02:05.080]  VM criticism of President Obama and black lives matter he's had a plethora of
[02:05.080 --> 02:09.720]  viral videos he's been attacked directly by White House aides because they can't
[02:09.720 --> 02:14.680]  pigeonholing into these politically correct boxes because he's a young
[02:14.680 --> 02:18.720]  black conservative and he doesn't go along with black lives matter so it's
[02:18.720 --> 02:23.880]  gonna be interesting to get his take on affairs absolute ton of news of course
[02:23.880 --> 02:27.680]  we're gonna delve into the geopolitical stuff with a shoot down of the Russian
[02:27.680 --> 02:32.800]  fighter jet but first up we're gonna talk about Black Friday because it seems
[02:32.800 --> 02:38.040]  to be declining in influence which is a good thing and yet still within hours of
[02:38.040 --> 02:42.880]  it beginning and in fact beforehand yesterday these videos were pouring out
[02:42.880 --> 02:48.400]  on the internet of people beating each other up over gods that they don't need
[02:48.400 --> 02:52.840]  and they can't afford anyway and in fact one of the top stories on Drudge
[02:52.840 --> 02:57.160]  Report right now is an in four was dot com article gonna play this video after
[02:57.160 --> 03:01.720]  the break Black Friday Americans brawl over vegetable steamers now what's
[03:01.720 --> 03:04.920]  interesting about this video which isn't the case with the other videos that
[03:04.920 --> 03:10.040]  embedded on this page some people are saying that this is fake so now the
[03:10.040 --> 03:14.440]  the desire the lust to get a viral video to get it featured on a show like you
[03:14.440 --> 03:19.320]  know Jimmy Kimmel or whatever is so vehement that people seem to be now
[03:19.320 --> 03:24.520]  staging the Black Friday brawl videos and this is the one that's gone viral so
[03:24.520 --> 03:29.560]  we're gonna look into it also again a ton of others that are not stage and
[03:29.560 --> 03:33.840]  feature basically people punching the hell out of each other to get access to
[03:33.840 --> 03:37.600]  these cheap slave goods made in China that they don't need and can't afford but
[03:37.600 --> 03:42.480]  there's a whole psychology behind Black Friday it's not just about getting the
[03:42.480 --> 03:47.560]  deals because as we will delve into Black Friday is a complete scam the
[03:47.560 --> 03:52.480]  retailers raise their prices in the months before Black Friday to then in
[03:52.480 --> 03:58.800]  comparison make the Black Friday deal seem like a bargain seem like a discount a
[03:58.800 --> 04:04.760]  great deal it's a complete scam so why do people still do it why do they brave
[04:04.760 --> 04:09.800]  these aggressive mob crowds to try and get their hands on these products which
[04:09.800 --> 04:13.840]  don't even offer much of a discount and there's a there's a psychological well
[04:13.840 --> 04:17.880]  there's a couple of psychological reasons behind it which we will touch upon
[04:17.880 --> 04:23.800]  yesterday Donald Trump came out and tweeted info wars and the liberals the
[04:23.800 --> 04:29.560]  regressive progressives went into a complete meltdown based on the very
[04:29.560 --> 04:33.520]  fact that he merely tweeted out a link to info wars dot com he then quoted
[04:33.520 --> 04:39.240]  yours truly and the but her cry baby meltdown amongst the liberals continued
[04:39.240 --> 04:43.480]  and of course that surrounded a couple of controversies that been swirling
[04:43.480 --> 04:48.680]  around Donald Trump this week regarding so-called Muslims celebrating 9 11 and
[04:48.680 --> 04:53.560]  of course his treatment of this disabled reporter will get back on it after the
[04:53.560 --> 05:00.360]  break this is the Alex Jones show live stay tuned all you pro vaccine people
[05:00.360 --> 05:04.440]  should rejoice at this news anti-vaccine parents to stop receiving child care
[05:04.440 --> 05:08.400]  benefits under Australian no jab no pay law the new changes that will take
[05:08.400 --> 05:13.080]  effect on January 1st 2016 are projected to save the Australian government
[05:13.080 --> 05:16.920]  over 500 million dollars over four years and how many children are not
[05:16.920 --> 05:20.520]  receiving their vaccines according to the Australian childhood immunization
[05:20.520 --> 05:26.120]  register it's 1.77 percent I thought all you needed was 90 percent to have heard
[05:26.120 --> 05:30.120]  immunity the government believes that by removing the non-medical exemption it
[05:30.120 --> 05:33.160]  will reinforce the importance of immunization and protecting public
[05:33.160 --> 05:36.480]  health but what this is really about is the government wants to put anything in
[05:36.480 --> 05:40.160]  your body that they want and they want to make sure you bend over and take it a
[05:40.160 --> 05:44.000]  footnote in the article is that by 2020 childless couples will overtake those

[08:28.720 --> 08:44.400]  it's the alex jones show live black friday edition
[08:44.400 --> 08:50.720]  rolling over vegetable steamers as one woman steals an item from a child for
[08:50.720 --> 09:00.840]  being physically attacked by the kids mother let's go to this clip
[09:00.840 --> 09:06.760]  they pile into this box as a vegetable steamers then you look the woman tries
[09:06.760 --> 09:10.480]  to grab it she grabs it from the child then gets in a fight with the child's
[09:10.480 --> 09:14.640]  mother and there's a slow-mo of this coming up where you can see it again so
[09:14.640 --> 09:20.700]  the lady in red grabs the box there from the child the mother then gets into a
[09:20.700 --> 09:24.800]  fight with her but some people have watched this video and if you look at
[09:24.800 --> 09:27.920]  the comments on YouTube it's quite convincing they're saying that it's
[09:27.920 --> 09:33.520]  staged because the black lady with the child appears to have the boxes in hand
[09:33.520 --> 09:38.920]  before the mob rushes towards the pile of them and then you have this incident
[09:38.920 --> 09:43.600]  with the other lady grabbing the box off the child so some people are saying that
[09:43.600 --> 09:48.040]  this is staged why would they need to stage it well simply because these
[09:48.040 --> 09:52.200]  videos go viral every single year and this is the one that has gone viral so
[09:52.200 --> 09:57.200]  far they're routinely played on all the you know the evening shows Jimmy
[09:57.200 --> 10:01.600]  Kimmel and so forth so if somebody wants to get a few million views on a
[10:01.600 --> 10:06.040]  YouTube video and you can get some decent ad commission off that then it's
[10:06.040 --> 10:11.440]  certainly worthwhile doing so the jury's still out if you then look at this
[10:11.440 --> 10:15.880]  article and scroll down there are probably five or six other videos which
[10:15.880 --> 10:21.080]  are definitely not staged of black Friday shoppers and again this started
[10:21.080 --> 10:26.960]  yesterday the day before basically plowing into each other brawling fighting
[10:26.960 --> 10:32.520]  screaming punching each other over these goods again which they probably don't
[10:32.520 --> 10:37.280]  need probably can't afford getting into more mountains of debt simply to get
[10:37.280 --> 10:41.080]  their hands on them so whereas that video might be staged the others certainly
[10:41.080 --> 10:46.720]  on and we put out the article yesterday as we make this point every single year
[10:46.720 --> 10:54.160]  black Friday is a complete scam it's proven now that the biggest retailers
[10:54.160 --> 11:00.400]  raise their prices in the months before black Friday so then in comparison make
[11:00.400 --> 11:04.240]  it look as if people are getting a discount when they're not and if you
[11:04.240 --> 11:08.200]  look at the stats which are linked in this article why black Friday is a
[11:08.200 --> 11:12.480]  complete scam Bloomberg Business Week reports that among the 15 largest US
[11:12.480 --> 11:17.600]  retailers operating margins in the holiday quarter this is 2013 where 11%
[11:17.600 --> 11:23.880]  compared with 9% in the preceding nine months so they don't take a hit for
[11:23.880 --> 11:28.560]  black Friday these large retailers they actually make more profit on black
[11:28.560 --> 11:34.080]  Friday a because these so-called discounts aren't really discounts they're
[11:34.080 --> 11:40.800]  just in comparison to the previous price rises and then B they put a 98% markup
[11:40.800 --> 11:45.040]  on other items so when people are getting the flat screen TV or whatever
[11:45.040 --> 11:50.000]  they want they're then on the way to buying this product picking up another
[11:50.000 --> 11:56.920]  item that's been marked up by 98% so the retailer still makes a huge profit this
[11:56.920 --> 12:01.200]  has been known for years and yet people are still camping outside you know
[12:01.200 --> 12:05.200]  Walmart's and Sears and wherever else to get these so-called discounts these
[12:05.200 --> 12:11.360]  bargains that aren't even bargains and then the other factor is and you can
[12:11.360 --> 12:16.880]  look at this for Amazon.com for example you can get the same product for the
[12:16.880 --> 12:21.800]  same price on Amazon.com two days before black Friday there was a big thing
[12:21.800 --> 12:26.480]  about Darth Vader toasters this is the must-have item that everybody wanted
[12:26.480 --> 12:32.360]  people are camping out for hours in some cases more than 24 hours to be the
[12:32.360 --> 12:37.120]  first to get their hands on this you know this rare item which everybody
[12:37.120 --> 12:41.480]  really really must have and is vitally important for the quality of their life
[12:41.480 --> 12:46.240]  a Darth Vader toaster which I don't remember the exact figure but they were
[12:46.240 --> 12:50.440]  gonna get it for about you know $40 they could have gone on Amazon two days
[12:50.440 --> 12:56.600]  before not wasted their time on Thanksgiving camping outside the store and
[12:56.600 --> 13:02.120]  got it for the exact same price and this is why we draw attention to this every
[13:02.120 --> 13:06.400]  year because these so-called discounts that don't just begin on black Friday
[13:06.400 --> 13:11.680]  anymore they begin on the Wednesday the Thursday Thanksgiving one two days before
[13:11.680 --> 13:17.240]  people are literally sacrificing crucial family time that they wouldn't get
[13:17.240 --> 13:22.160]  any other time of year to camp out and buy these worthless products which they
[13:22.160 --> 13:26.480]  could just sit at home and order on Amazon it's complete insanity we're
[13:26.480 --> 13:29.680]  gonna get into why they do that it's not just this idea of getting a discount
[13:29.680 --> 13:35.680]  but as he does on an annual basis now Mark dice was out there in San Diego I
[13:35.680 --> 13:41.320]  believe it was trolling these people who sacrificed crucial family time to camp
[13:41.320 --> 13:48.000]  outside to buy a Darth Vader toaster here's the clip the clause here to shame
[13:48.000 --> 13:55.960]  the Thanksgiving shoppers the center of disease control the CDC has discovered
[13:55.960 --> 14:00.400]  that tens of millions of turkeys were infected by dangerous parasites
[14:00.400 --> 14:05.000]  quickly devouring the brains of millions of Americans after Thanksgiving
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.400]  dinner no longer having any brain cells left the television took over leading
[14:11.400 --> 14:16.600]  them to retail establishments leading them outside of their families outside of
[14:16.600 --> 14:23.880]  their homes ruining the Thanksgiving holiday now waiting in line to buy more
[14:23.880 --> 14:30.160]  electronic goods to detach themselves further from reality going deeper into
[14:30.160 --> 14:36.400]  debt spending money you don't have on things you don't need happy Thanksgiving
[14:36.400 --> 14:44.800]  brother planting seeds of sanity I hope they take root tonight on the walking
[14:44.800 --> 14:51.240]  dead the zombies have congregated near retail establishments in quest of new
[14:51.240 --> 14:58.240]  televisions the vast majority of America now a complete zombie wasteland of
[14:58.240 --> 15:02.560]  corporate debt slaves ruining Thanksgiving unaware of their own
[15:02.560 --> 15:08.240]  idiocy waiting hours in line to spend money that they don't have on things they
[15:08.240 --> 15:14.240]  don't need to go deeper into debt that you will probably regret shame on you
[15:14.240 --> 15:19.600]  all these walkers confused that the doors are closed
[15:19.600 --> 15:28.720]  unaware of how to gain access to the building
[15:30.720 --> 15:34.800]  brains I need brains
[15:34.800 --> 15:44.160]  well brains brains brains brains brains brains so far no signs of walkers and
[15:44.160 --> 15:49.880]  Barnes and Noble the zombies congregating towards places that carry
[15:49.880 --> 15:56.160]  electronic devices allergic to books and knowledge alone security guard
[15:56.160 --> 16:01.360]  patrolling for the possibility of any zombies have you seen any zombies out
[16:01.360 --> 16:11.560]  here today sir any zombies today you're gonna ask me to leave I'm disrupting
[16:11.560 --> 16:15.520]  okay happy thanksgiving
[16:16.360 --> 16:26.600]  again I am the one disrupting the hordes of zombies loved by Americans now me
[16:26.600 --> 16:34.960]  long voice of sanity being expelled from the shopping center subscribe to the
[16:34.960 --> 16:42.360]  smart guy's annual trolling of Black Friday shoppers again he was kicked
[16:42.360 --> 16:47.800]  out by a security basically making the point that the zombie hordes weren't
[16:47.800 --> 16:52.600]  lined up outside Barnes and Noble but it's interesting if you delve into this
[16:52.600 --> 16:57.280]  as I just mentioned they're not even getting a good deal and a lot of people
[16:57.280 --> 17:00.720]  probably know that by now they probably know that they can just sit at home and
[17:00.720 --> 17:07.360]  buy the exact same item for the same price if not less from Amazon.com yet
[17:07.360 --> 17:12.840]  they choose to engage in this annual mob rush to get these items and as of this
[17:12.840 --> 17:17.440]  morning there are numerous videos that people brawling punching obviously more
[17:17.440 --> 17:20.760]  to come but the independent came out with an article which was interesting
[17:20.760 --> 17:26.440]  called Black Friday the signs behind why people kill each other over TVs and it
[17:26.440 --> 17:30.640]  turns out that this is not just about competition of course now that people
[17:30.640 --> 17:35.040]  are more sedentary they're not involved in as much sports this is basically the
[17:35.040 --> 17:39.360]  only kind of competition they get the competition to you know try to find
[17:39.360 --> 17:43.360]  resources that would normally be scarce if you believe the propaganda about
[17:43.360 --> 17:48.920]  artificial scarcity which the media pumps up in advance of Black Friday but
[17:48.920 --> 17:54.280]  they actually create the conditions the retailers do for this mob violence
[17:54.280 --> 18:00.320]  because they make people conform to social norms by queuing up okay so people
[18:00.320 --> 18:04.360]  think I'm after you in the queue this is when I get in this is when I get my
[18:04.360 --> 18:09.520]  turn so they've already created that condition where this social norm is in
[18:09.520 --> 18:13.640]  place and if anyone deviates from that they're going to be they're going to
[18:13.640 --> 18:19.840]  attract the hate of the mob justice so when they open the actual door on Black
[18:19.840 --> 18:24.240]  Friday what do they do they don't let people in one by one who have queued up
[18:24.240 --> 18:29.360]  in order they let everybody in at once and in fact they place the most highly
[18:29.360 --> 18:34.640]  sought-after discounted goods at the very front of the store again ensuring
[18:34.640 --> 18:40.160]  that the mob will rush in to grab those you know discounts those items that have
[18:40.160 --> 18:44.560]  been that have had artificial scarcity produced around them so the retailers
[18:44.560 --> 18:48.320]  create the very conditions for this violent behavior which we see every
[18:48.320 --> 18:53.720]  year by making people queue up and conform to this social norm and then
[18:53.720 --> 18:59.080]  instantly breaking it and allowing the mob to all rush in at once so that's why
[18:59.080 --> 19:03.880]  people get enraged with this kind of injustice that they saw the product
[19:03.880 --> 19:07.720]  first or they grabbed the product first or they were first in the line before
[19:07.720 --> 19:13.000]  that person and then it's completely tribal if you if you drill down into it
[19:13.000 --> 19:17.880]  it's the tribal rush for resources that are scarce in the minds of these
[19:17.880 --> 19:22.480]  brainwashed zombies so it's not really their fault it's the fault of the
[19:22.480 --> 19:27.840]  retailers it's the fault of the media who gin this up beforehand to create this
[19:27.840 --> 19:33.240]  very kind of violence which then of course produces great copy great video
[19:33.240 --> 19:37.680]  footage for the evening news the good news is that black friday is becoming
[19:37.680 --> 19:42.480]  less and less popular an article out of Reuters which details that today because
[19:42.480 --> 19:46.560]  people are finally beginning to realize that egg it's a scam they're not getting
[19:46.560 --> 19:50.400]  the discount they think they're getting they can buy the same product anyway on
[19:50.400 --> 19:54.960]  amazon.com without camping outside and wasting Thanksgiving we'll be back with

[23:07.480 --> 23:13.160]  lose control when this happens it will rip our country apart in ways you never

[23:17.760 --> 23:21.600]  want to protect look I've made predictions like this before a few years
[23:21.600 --> 23:26.200]  ago I warned that the housing prices would collapse before that I warned that
[23:26.200 --> 23:31.240]  dot-com companies would crash and they did those who listened had a chance to
[23:31.240 --> 23:35.560]  save themselves but this has nothing to do with the stock market this will
[23:35.560 --> 23:42.160]  affect us all I've posted a free video at dollardanger.com maybe you'll

[24:12.240 --> 24:17.680]  we're back live on the Alex Jones show Black Friday edition another amazing
[24:17.680 --> 24:21.720]  video clip has emerged out of Germany now bearing in mind Germany has just
[24:21.720 --> 24:28.480]  announced that they will begin bombing ISIS in Syria while allowing potential
[24:28.480 --> 24:34.680]  ISIS jihadists into Germany via the migrant program of course potentially
[24:34.680 --> 24:39.560]  up to millions of migrants which you know ISIS has promised hidden amongst them
[24:39.560 --> 24:44.320]  will be these jihadists again completely insane policy some checks have gone in
[24:44.320 --> 24:48.920]  place now at least but the insanity still continues and there's an article up
[24:48.920 --> 24:53.960]  on info wars dot com today pro-migrant politician celebrates demographic
[24:53.960 --> 24:59.920]  suicide of German population and I'm gonna narrate over this video clip because
[24:59.920 --> 25:04.720]  it's absolutely astounding a video clip shows German Green Party politician and
[25:04.720 --> 25:09.360]  it's it's always these left-wingers of course Stephanie von Berg giving a
[25:09.360 --> 25:15.480]  speech in which she celebrates the fact that mass migration will bring an end to
[25:15.480 --> 25:23.840]  German majority populations in cities within a few decades here's the clip so
[25:23.840 --> 25:29.600]  this is a speech in front of the Germans all
[25:29.600 --> 25:40.480]  I'll preface this by talking about Gregor Geissi now what you're hearing now is another German leftist
[25:40.480 --> 25:45.720]  politician who back in July started basically celebrating the fact that
[25:45.720 --> 25:49.240]  the German population was being replaced by these migrants
[25:49.240 --> 25:56.440]  he labeled opposition to those migrants as Nazis and he basically said quote
[25:56.440 --> 26:01.000]  every year more native Germans die than are born that is very fortunate and he
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  smacked his lips and looked very smug while he was saying this quote it's
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.520]  because the Nazis are not very good at having offspring so in Germany now
[26:08.520 --> 26:13.720]  according to this leftist politician Gregor Geissi anyone who opposes these
[26:13.720 --> 26:18.240]  German villages in some cases of you know hundred people being flooded by a
[26:18.240 --> 26:22.360]  hundred up to a thousand migrants who aren't integrated into the population
[26:22.360 --> 26:27.040]  anyone who has a problem with that is a Nazi and he's happy about it because
[26:27.040 --> 26:30.720]  German people aren't having children these migrants will be having children
[26:30.720 --> 26:34.160]  and of course they'll become dependent on the state and vote for his party
[26:34.160 --> 26:38.480]  that's why he's so pleased about it now the other clip which is that the top of
[26:38.480 --> 26:44.120]  this news article is the female German Green Party politician Stephanie von
[26:44.120 --> 26:48.240]  Berg she gave a speech in front of Parliament and this came out just a few
[26:48.240 --> 26:54.120]  days ago where she basically said the same thing quote our society will change
[26:54.120 --> 26:59.200]  our city will change radically I hold that in 20 30 years there will no longer
[26:59.200 --> 27:05.160]  be a German majority in our city well we have plenty of people and live in a
[27:05.160 --> 27:09.600]  super cultural society this is what we have in the future and I want to make it
[27:09.600 --> 27:15.040]  very clear especially to those right-wingers this is a good thing so
[27:15.040 --> 27:19.360]  again she's celebrating the fact that the German population will be replaced
[27:19.360 --> 27:25.520]  by non-Germans demographic suicide she's saying it's a good thing so
[27:25.520 --> 27:32.080]  presumably she also thinks that the wave of crime and rape which is documented
[27:32.080 --> 27:35.440]  that these migrants are already bringing to these German villages towns and
[27:35.440 --> 27:40.120]  cities we've exhaustively documented that over the past several months the
[27:40.120 --> 27:44.160]  German authorities are covering it up so as not to legitimize critics of mass
[27:44.160 --> 27:49.240]  migration they're going after people on Facebook who have concerns about this
[27:49.240 --> 27:54.600]  with the X stars the official involved in that censorship program and now this
[27:54.600 --> 28:00.600]  German Green Party politician gets up in front of the German parliament and says
[28:00.600 --> 28:07.000]  it's a good thing that in 20 to 30 years Germans will be a minority in their
[28:07.000 --> 28:12.360]  own cities and quite why they think that is a complete mystery especially given
[28:12.360 --> 28:15.320]  the fact well we know why it is because they're going to get votes from all the
[28:15.320 --> 28:20.040]  people dependent on government but even Angela Merkel herself the chancellor of
[28:20.040 --> 28:24.600]  Germany came out in 2010 said that multiculturalism has utterly failed
[28:24.600 --> 28:31.640]  because immigrants do not integrate into German society Alex Jones is on the
[28:31.640 --> 28:35.720]  phone right now with a comment on this Alex go ahead that's right Paul I want
[28:35.720 --> 28:40.800]  to comment on this as I drive take care of this day on black Friday for the
[28:40.800 --> 28:43.800]  family and just listen to you and I'm gonna come back in the next second for
[28:43.800 --> 28:47.440]  your guests elaborate on black Friday but you're absolutely right what this is
[28:47.440 --> 28:53.680]  is globalist demographics basically is not to use them but again a twisted form
[28:53.680 --> 28:58.800]  of it where any culture no matter if it's Japanese German whatever it is has to
[28:58.800 --> 29:04.480]  have other populations brought in to be put in odds in classic great game divide
[29:04.480 --> 29:09.760]  the Congress strategy presents the admit this all of them basically admit
[29:09.760 --> 29:17.000]  this this is a real admitted public sickening strategy that is being put
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.120]  in everyone's face and so it's so over the top they have to make it over the
[29:21.120 --> 29:26.320]  top and throw it in your face hiding at the plane you with the psychological
[29:26.320 --> 29:31.200]  tactic of just tricking everyone that it must be okay because of their over the
[29:31.200 --> 29:36.040]  top confidence game this is what's taught that every major university when I
[29:36.040 --> 29:40.840]  went to college here in Austin, Texas every class I was in it didn't matter if
[29:40.840 --> 29:43.920]  it was mad that matter in US history

[29:54.120 --> 29:56.640]  network
[29:58.320 --> 30:03.080]  global warming advocates are now blaming luxury condominiums for man-made
[30:03.080 --> 30:06.960]  climate change despite the record breaking snowfall which recently pounded
[30:06.960 --> 30:11.440]  the northern US the climate words for all coalition released a report claiming
[30:11.440 --> 30:15.120]  that luxury apartment buildings are the largest climate change offenders in New
[30:15.120 --> 30:19.640]  York City these are New York City's largest buildings over 50,000 square feet
[30:19.640 --> 30:23.800]  in size which primarily consists of a mixture of luxury apartments commercial
[30:23.800 --> 30:27.360]  buildings and multifamily housing developments the report stated the
[30:27.360 --> 30:31.840]  report was released just as New York was being pounded by heavy snow storms
[30:31.840 --> 30:35.800]  global warming advocates however will attempt to blame this record snowfall
[30:35.800 --> 30:40.320]  on man-made climate change even though a few years ago they were predicting that
[30:40.320 --> 30:44.040]  the earth's ice caps would have dramatically melted by now but they
[30:44.040 --> 30:47.320]  really want you to live in a tiny apartment so they can cram more people

[34:29.960 --> 34:33.520]  reach about 20 million people a week in the total aggregate that's a very
[34:33.520 --> 34:38.680]  conservative number and so MSNBC with a couple million viewers makes fun of us
[34:38.680 --> 34:44.680]  and acts like we're not legitimate they're jokes just like CNBC when they
[34:44.680 --> 34:48.880]  got laughed at a few months ago at the Republican debate they're out of bullets
[34:48.880 --> 34:52.680]  they don't have the moral authority and from Europe to Canada the United States
[34:52.680 --> 34:56.240]  they're trying to arrest people that deny man-made global warming they're
[34:56.240 --> 35:00.880]  trying to arrest people to criticize feminists the new Facebook rules say if
[35:00.880 --> 35:05.000]  you disagree with someone and take speech and it's all selectively
[35:05.000 --> 35:11.640]  enforced these are desperate to talent caring and that's why in Germany of the
[35:11.640 --> 35:16.320]  two Green Party leaders in the Bundestag in the Reichstag shank the end of
[35:16.320 --> 35:20.200]  Germans is good and they're both white German these are racist against their
[35:20.200 --> 35:24.080]  own people they say they're fighting Nazis well Nazis are just race-based
[35:24.080 --> 35:27.920]  politicians they are the race-based politicians bringing in the third world
[35:27.920 --> 35:32.040]  populations who might even not be bad people and then turning them into race
[35:32.040 --> 35:36.240]  based or religious based haters and that's what we're doing with this huge
[35:36.240 --> 35:41.640]  Muslim Arab majority in many German cities many French cities so so this is a
[35:41.640 --> 35:46.880]  planned chickening socialist leftist takeover I'm against the police take I
[35:46.880 --> 35:50.600]  criticize the bad police that the cops that are bad every day didn't mean I
[35:50.600 --> 35:55.080]  support Soros saying go out blow up and kill the cops just blame some random
[35:55.080 --> 35:58.480]  cop just shoot them in the back of the head of the gas station that is a
[35:58.480 --> 36:04.600]  literal red terror style puts like we saw in Ukraine two years ago we know
[36:04.600 --> 36:09.240]  their playbook folks we can beat up now continuing we're the real liberal we're
[36:09.240 --> 36:15.320]  the libertarians shifting years into Black Friday shifting years into that
[36:15.320 --> 36:20.080]  situation you were so eloquent earlier about how it's its tribalism it's the
[36:20.080 --> 36:23.000]  hunter-gathering it's the only way you're allowed to compete they
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.160]  psychologically set it up Jim Morrison wrote his thesis it was a UCLA film
[36:28.160 --> 36:33.200]  school about how to cause riots at stores and how to do it where you put
[36:33.200 --> 36:37.400]  people everybody at the door and then open it up with the key items up front
[36:37.400 --> 36:41.240]  it's funny that Jim Morrison of the doors actually wrote about that how to
[36:41.240 --> 36:46.080]  start riots folks can look into it so this is done to create hysteria to
[36:46.080 --> 36:50.280]  create mindlessness and then it's not even the best deal one of the worst
[36:50.280 --> 36:54.880]  years one of the worst days of the year to buy products but as you said it's
[36:54.880 --> 36:59.600]  becoming unpopular because people are becoming wise if they can shop online
[36:59.600 --> 37:03.720]  in places like a four store.com so now I'm going to do a brief one with Rob Doode
[37:03.720 --> 37:08.040]  let him elaborate on it he's in the right shot then we'll get the studios in

[38:39.040 --> 38:43.360]  pre-shipping right now and I get back to the Donald Trump situation and then
[38:43.360 --> 38:48.480]  your guest Donald Trump told the truth about radical Muslims celebrating on
[38:48.480 --> 38:52.280]  9-11 you know Muslim kids said those towers won't be there next week that
[38:52.280 --> 38:56.280]  was in thank you very much look that up then the towers were gone people
[38:56.280 --> 39:01.120]  celebrated in Palestine other groups were caught celebrating look at the two
[39:01.120 --> 39:06.000]  stadium events at the soccer games you know Channing Hall of Hog Bar God is
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.720]  great during the one minute of silence with 130 plus dead people in France so
[39:10.720 --> 39:14.200]  then the claim that radical Muslims don't celebrate terror and the claim
[39:14.200 --> 39:17.800]  profits of fraud in the cook is another inversion of reality and I'm going to
[39:17.800 --> 39:22.040]  write an article on this today calling it all downfall but super job on this

[41:47.840 --> 41:51.080]  and I thank him for holding this was a story that came to my attention
[41:51.080 --> 41:55.520]  probably back in July I think it was Christine Blatchford at the National
[41:55.520 --> 42:00.960]  Post in Canada she made a video about this trial I uploaded her comments it
[42:00.960 --> 42:06.120]  ended up getting about 600,000 views on YouTube it was viral basically at the
[42:06.120 --> 42:12.000]  time and it was pertaining to an artist out of Toronto called Gregory Alan
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.920]  Elliott who faced at the time and we'll get an update and see if it's the same
[42:16.920 --> 42:22.600]  situation now six months in prison for harassment his crime was apparently
[42:22.600 --> 42:27.320]  disagreeing with feminists on Twitter and at first it was like this is you know
[42:27.320 --> 42:31.560]  this is too shocking to be true surely he made some kind of violent threat
[42:31.560 --> 42:36.720]  against them surely he just didn't disagree with them on their politics but
[42:36.720 --> 42:40.640]  I actually drilled down into the tweets into what Mr. Elliott said and that's
[42:40.640 --> 42:45.040]  exactly how it appeared it appeared as if he was being charged with a crime of
[42:45.040 --> 42:50.360]  harassment simply for disagreeing with someone's political opinion but here to
[42:50.360 --> 42:54.640]  tell us more about this and how it has massive implications for free speech not
[42:54.640 --> 42:59.360]  just in Canada but on the internet as a whole is Christopher Murphy the lawyer
[42:59.360 --> 43:05.440]  for Gregory Alan Elliott Christopher welcome to the show thank you Paul good
[43:05.440 --> 43:10.800]  to have you here now this began as far as I can remember back in 2012 so for the
[43:10.800 --> 43:15.680]  audience explain how it began and what led to this charge of criminal harassment
[43:15.680 --> 43:22.800]  against Mr. Elliott sure so in November of 2012 the police came to Mr. Elliott's
[43:22.800 --> 43:29.080]  house in Toronto Ontario and essentially asked him to turn himself in and Mr.
[43:29.080 --> 43:33.040]  Elliott my understanding was at the time did not know the reason for the
[43:33.040 --> 43:39.400]  police's visit the Mr. Elliott attended at the police detachment and he was
[43:39.400 --> 43:46.160]  placed under arrest at that point for criminally harassing a single complainant
[43:46.160 --> 43:54.600]  named Stephanie Guthrie and so he was held in custody at that point and was
[43:54.600 --> 44:00.600]  taken the next the following day to the courthouse for a bail hearing at the
[44:00.600 --> 44:07.560]  bail hearing the prosecutor tendered essentially what I would describe as
[44:07.560 --> 44:14.080]  the most inflammatory tweets that Mr. Guthrie had sent on Twitter they had
[44:14.080 --> 44:20.000]  nothing to do actually with the complainant in the case just Mr. Elliott I
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.360]  think had sent approximately 50,000 tweets by that point so just randomly
[44:24.360 --> 44:29.080]  plucked out of those 50,000 tweets the worst tweets and of course they weren't
[44:29.080 --> 44:34.000]  in any kind of context whatsoever so the justice of the piece who was here in
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.840]  the bail hearing would have no idea to whom these tweets had been sent and what
[44:37.840 --> 44:43.040]  the context was and the crown sought Mr. Elliott's detention which means that
[44:43.040 --> 44:48.480]  they the Mr. Elliott would have sat in jail waiting for his trial so that was
[44:48.480 --> 44:52.880]  I wanted to deny him bail even though he put over some tweets when he obviously
[44:52.880 --> 44:57.520]  wasn't even a threat to anyone right right yes so so he actually spent three
[44:57.520 --> 45:02.720]  days in custody waiting for this bail hearing to be reached and then the crown
[45:02.720 --> 45:07.480]  sought to detain him so not give him bail until his trial and his trial is still
[45:07.480 --> 45:16.320]  ongoing three years later the judgment is coming down on January 22nd 2016 so
[45:16.320 --> 45:21.400]  once Mr. Elliott got bail back in November 2012 two further complainants
[45:21.400 --> 45:25.920]  came forward and Mr. Elliott was eventually charged with criminally
[45:25.920 --> 45:33.080]  harassing three individuals each of whom was extremely active in a Toronto
[45:33.080 --> 45:37.000]  political organization called Women in Toronto Politics the original
[45:37.000 --> 45:40.640]  complainant Ms. Guthrie is actually the founder of this political organization and
[45:40.640 --> 45:48.840]  so the trial lasted I think it was 15 actual court days that's just that the
[45:48.840 --> 45:53.560]  evidence portion I've done two murder trials that took less time and I'm not
[45:53.560 --> 45:59.960]  exaggerating and then there is there are applications that were brought I
[45:59.960 --> 46:05.960]  believe there are 18 or 19 total court days spent on this case and at the end of
[46:05.960 --> 46:12.440]  the day I what the defense's position was clearly was that Mr. Elliott and this
[46:12.440 --> 46:15.800]  was admitted by the officer in charge of the case and the crown attorney the
[46:15.800 --> 46:21.600]  prosecutor Mr. Elliott had never sent a tweet that was threatening in nature
[46:21.600 --> 46:27.000]  Mr. Elliott never used any sexualized language with the three complainants
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.720]  and Mr. Elliott had never seen any of the three complainants in person except on
[46:32.720 --> 46:40.320]  one occasion when months before the alleged transgressions occurred Mr.
[46:40.320 --> 46:44.760]  Elliott was actually volunteering as an artist he volunteered to make posters
[46:44.760 --> 46:48.680]  for Ms. Guthrie's political organization and he was actually he was
[46:48.680 --> 46:52.400]  actually helping the feminists with their cause in the beginning and they
[46:52.400 --> 46:57.000]  turned against him and then the other thing is this video game this is part
[46:57.000 --> 47:01.520]  of it wasn't it because there was an individual who made an online video game
[47:01.520 --> 47:06.240]  based around punching Anita Sarkeesian who is a prominent feminist in the face
[47:06.240 --> 47:10.760]  in this online video game that's right feminists as far as I understand that
[47:10.760 --> 47:15.720]  now you know the complainants against Mr. Elliott they basically wanted to wreck
[47:15.720 --> 47:20.080]  this young kids life Elliott complained about that he said it probably wasn't the
[47:20.080 --> 47:24.760]  best course of action and that's part of the case correct yes so yeah so now I
[47:24.760 --> 47:27.520]  continue through the timeline so Mr. Elliott's charge of criminally
[47:27.520 --> 47:33.040]  harassing the three complainants from sorry from August 1st 2012
[47:33.040 --> 47:41.160]  essentially till November the 16th 2012 so from April the time that Mr. Elliott
[47:41.160 --> 47:46.880]  met with Ms. Guthrie to provide art for her organization from April to July
[47:46.880 --> 47:50.480]  there there are a number of tweets that were in evidence and they're both
[47:50.480 --> 47:55.520]  they're both on each other at the same side they're both helping one another
[47:55.520 --> 48:01.360]  out Mr. Elliott's a clearly a booster for this organization he's he's attempting
[48:01.360 --> 48:05.160]  to get other women to join the organization at one point at one
[48:05.160 --> 48:11.480]  point he takes a female friend of his to the to one of their functions to get
[48:11.480 --> 48:15.760]  her involved right so he's involved with the organization to a limited degree
[48:15.760 --> 48:22.680]  but he's clearly a booster of it then in July of 2012 this person is a small
[48:22.680 --> 48:27.720]  town in northern Ontario called Sioux St. Marie so there's a 24-year-old kid
[48:27.720 --> 48:33.760]  named Bendel and Spur up in Sioux St. Marie Ontario who had I think at the
[48:33.760 --> 48:39.080]  time he had something like six or eight Twitter followers he makes this face
[48:39.080 --> 48:47.200]  punch game wherein if you hit the space bar on on your computer there would be
[48:47.200 --> 48:51.800]  a simulation of Anita Sarkeesian being punched in the face now this is not the
[48:51.800 --> 48:55.880]  first face punch game this young man had made he'd made one about a male just
[48:55.880 --> 48:59.600]  just a few months earlier but didn't get really any media attention or any
[48:59.600 --> 49:04.320]  attention at all so he makes us a neediest Anita Sarkeesian face punch
[49:04.320 --> 49:09.480]  game and you know I mean I I certainly wouldn't advocate people doing that but
[49:09.480 --> 49:17.560]  to each his own and so that at that point Ms. Guthrie does some investigative
[49:17.560 --> 49:24.600]  legwork and tracks down who this person is that the actual his real name in Sioux
[49:24.600 --> 49:30.120]  St. Marie the small town so what happens at that point is Ms. Guthrie who is the
[49:30.120 --> 49:35.240]  again the founder of this political organization literally asks her
[49:35.240 --> 49:43.000]  followers whether or not she should sick the internet on this Mr. Spur and she
[49:43.000 --> 49:50.440]  indicated that the overwhelming response was yes so at that point she does in my
[49:50.440 --> 49:54.480]  this is the defense's position does attempt to sick the internet on Mr. Spur
[49:54.480 --> 50:01.180]  and the the course that that took was Mr. Spur actually the news the local
[50:01.180 --> 50:06.080]  newspapers were contacted there were a number of suggestions that people should
[50:06.080 --> 50:11.960]  not hire Mr. Spur for any work and Ms. Guthrie testified in the trial that she
[50:11.960 --> 50:18.320]  was attempting to have real-world consequences visited upon Mr. Spur
[50:18.320 --> 50:25.120]  for making this face punch game they were trying to ruin his life as they're
[50:25.120 --> 50:30.240]  now trying to ruin Mr. Elliott's life and indeed have done over the past couple

[50:34.040 --> 50:37.800]  Murphy and we're gonna explain why this is so crucial this is not just a
[50:37.800 --> 50:42.780]  Canadian issue this is an internet free speech issue because now we have top
[50:42.780 --> 50:48.120]  feminists getting in front of UN panels and basically making the same argument
[50:48.120 --> 50:52.840]  that harassment is disagreeing with them on the internet that's what they

[54:08.440 --> 54:12.640]  we're back live on the Alex Jones show with me your host Paul Joseph Watson
[54:12.640 --> 54:17.120]  we're talking to Christopher Murphy who is the lawyer for Gregory Ellen Elliott
[54:17.120 --> 54:23.800]  who faces six months in jail in Canada for quote criminal harassment which is
[54:23.800 --> 54:28.320]  in fact sending tweets to feminists disagreeing with them why is this
[54:28.320 --> 54:33.280]  important well as I made a video about a couple of months ago Anita Sarkeesian and
[54:33.280 --> 54:37.360]  Zoe Quinn who are two prominent feminists on YouTube on the internet
[54:37.360 --> 54:42.280]  they got up in front of this UN panel and basically tried to make the argument
[54:42.280 --> 54:47.800]  that saying you suck those are the words that Anita Sarkeesian used saying you
[54:47.800 --> 54:55.320]  suck to a feminist on Twitter constitutes quote cyber violence and that the UN
[54:55.320 --> 54:59.360]  should put pressure on national governments to then put pressure on ISPs
[54:59.360 --> 55:04.200]  to censor people to kick people off the internet for saying this another
[55:04.200 --> 55:10.400]  example given by Quinn was calling Caitlyn Jenner Bruce she said that people
[55:10.400 --> 55:14.960]  who call transgender people by their pre-transition names should be part
[55:14.960 --> 55:19.880]  under the same category of having committed cyber violence and basically
[55:19.880 --> 55:25.120]  be censored and kicked off the internet now we have this trial in Canada so we
[55:25.120 --> 55:30.640]  basically got this young kid who had his life ruined by these feminists or they
[55:30.640 --> 55:36.160]  attempted to ruin his life because he made a simulated face punch game so then
[55:36.160 --> 55:39.840]  an artist from Toronto Gregory Ellen Elliott who had been friendly with these
[55:39.840 --> 55:43.920]  feminists and tried to work with them before basically came forward and tried
[55:43.920 --> 55:48.840]  to defend this kid said that it's probably not the best idea to ruin his
[55:48.840 --> 55:53.880]  life over an online video game Christopher Murphy pick up the story for
[55:53.880 --> 56:00.000]  us right so yes so just before the break so what happened was Miss Guthrie the
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.320]  complainant asked if she should stick the internet on Mr. Spur there was an
[56:03.320 --> 56:09.520]  overwhelming response she says that was yes so then Mr. Elliott as as the the
[56:09.520 --> 56:15.280]  tweet started piling on Mr. Spur this young kid up north in Ontario Mr. Elliott
[56:15.280 --> 56:19.560]  said listen these are the tweets that he said out essentially listen if this guy
[56:19.560 --> 56:25.600]  ends up killing himself this is going to do serious damage to this this feminist
[56:25.600 --> 56:29.680]  political organization because there's going to be some some blowback so that's
[56:29.680 --> 56:37.040]  when the relationship started to go south and that was in July of 2012 so now we
[56:37.040 --> 56:43.960]  fast forward to August 2012 now Mr. Elliott is being bombarded by a number
[56:43.960 --> 56:50.640]  of different people who my submission work were close to this the feminist
[56:50.640 --> 56:56.600]  political organization including the complainants themselves and he started
[56:56.600 --> 57:00.560]  sometimes people in his position when they're getting bombarded and I said I
[57:00.560 --> 57:04.400]  think the word the correct word is bullied he was being bullied sometimes the
[57:04.400 --> 57:10.280]  bullies just back down but Mr. Elliott didn't so he he defended himself he he
[57:10.280 --> 57:16.040]  wrote back to the bullies and he would tweet about their political comments so
[57:16.040 --> 57:21.400]  if they if they made a political statement about the slut walk for instance
[57:21.400 --> 57:27.720]  Mr. Elliott would tweet a very politically valid point and so the
[57:27.720 --> 57:31.760]  tweets are going back and forth this wasn't a one-sided thing and and what
[57:31.760 --> 57:35.480]  really was important is that when the complainants came forward to the police
[57:35.480 --> 57:40.360]  eventually in November of 2012 they brought in a selected portion of tweets
[57:40.360 --> 57:46.040]  the police go out arrest Mr. Elliott try to keep him in jail it wasn't until his
[57:46.040 --> 57:53.480]  trial in 2013 or sorry 2014 that the other tweets that they were sending out
[57:53.480 --> 57:58.760]  about Mr. Elliott came to life and so there is some some terrible types of
[57:58.760 --> 58:03.920]  tweets that were being sent about him just making fun of him mock Twitter
[58:03.920 --> 58:06.520]  accounts were set up with his name they're all just they're all just
[58:06.520 --> 58:10.760]  ridiculing him online and he kept defending himself and ultimately a trial
[58:10.760 --> 58:17.200]  I put to the main complaint at Ms. Guthrie something to the effect of is
[58:17.200 --> 58:22.600]  Mr. Elliott in your view Ms. Guthrie allowed to defend himself to against all
[58:22.600 --> 58:27.080]  of your tweets and she said something to the effect of he's allowed to defend
[58:27.080 --> 58:32.640]  himself he's just not allowed to defend himself to me okay we'll get back to it
[58:32.640 --> 58:36.240]  with more after the break long segment coming up this is the Alex Jones show

[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.960]  texas alex jones
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:28.880]  we're back second hour of the alex jones show live this Friday 27th of
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.560]  november edition we're talking to Christopher Murphy the lawyer for
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.840]  Gregory Ellen Elliot who of course faces jail time in Canada for
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:41.920]  disagreeing with a feminist on Twitter so we have these feminists who again they
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.320]  cry bullies this is the new term that's been coined for these kind of people
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.240]  these feminists and social justice warriors who alternate between playing
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.840]  the victim and playing the aggressor so they've obviously they've already
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.240]  publicly shamed this young man for making an online video game simulation
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:03.920]  now they go after Gregory Ellen Elliot for trying to defend him mr. Murphy
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.640]  isn't it the case this is what I read that they actually as part of this
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.200]  public shaming campaign they tried to frame him as a pedophile or at least
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:16.320]  that was in the works as one of the ideas to publicly shame mr. Elliott
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:21.400]  correct well so what happened is this is this is now later in November of 2012
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:25.360]  mr. Elliott literally has not sent a tweet about any of the complaints for
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:32.160]  over a month and a woman in Toronto tweets something to the fact of I've
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:36.920]  got a 100 square foot apartment mr. Elliott writes back to her I'd like to
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:42.480]  see it sometime she writes back something to the effect of screw you I'm
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:48.800]  13 years old you're a pedophile okay so that's that that nothing to do with the
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.720]  complainants but the complainants were somehow became aware of this series of
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:59.400]  tweets very quickly within minutes and all of a sudden they started to one of
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.600]  the complainants miss Guthrie didn't actually send the tweet out herself but
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:08.720]  he contributed to some some of the conversation sent out a tweet where in
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:14.880]  mr. Elliott identified as a pedophile and that starts going viral okay now what
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:22.080]  happens is then within an hour of that they find out that this person was not
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.600]  actually a minor but was an adult but they don't do anything to correct the
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:31.040]  record and in fact when they come into the police a few days later with the
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:37.000]  select tweets bring in the pedophilia tweets and give them to the police even
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.320]  though they knew by that point this person was an adult and mr. Elliott of
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:47.640]  course attempts to defend himself against these pedophilia ac accusations
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:53.080]  and those tweets wherein he's defending himself against false pedophilia
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:58.000]  accusations were tendered by the prosecution at mr. Elliott's trial as
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.160]  evidence that he was criminally harassing the complainants and not making
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.400]  that up so defending yourself against charges fake charges of pedophilia now
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:14.800]  constitutes harassment they were part of the crowd the prosecution's case that
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:19.200]  mr. Elliott was contacting the complainants and obviously he was
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.800]  contacting the complainants to say listen I'm not a pedophile and he was
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.960]  merely tagging them in the tweets correct yes exactly yes yeah but he wasn't
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:31.040]  mailing them he wasn't calling them up on the phone he was tagging them in a
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:37.000]  tweet for God's sake yes exactly and so the precedent from what I understand it
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.200]  that they're trying to create this precedent where if you as a feminist or
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:46.680]  as whoever fear for your safety that that constitutes proof that someone is
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.120]  threatening your safety if you just merely claim it correct well yeah I mean
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:56.880]  I believe that somebody can be criminally harassed on Twitter so Paul if I for
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.000]  instance were sending a tweet out every few minutes tracking your location and
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.080]  telling the internet what you're wearing then then whenever you go out of your
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:10.120]  house you might look over your shoulder wondering whether or not this person is
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.680]  following you and you might you might ultimately feel fearful about that and
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:18.280]  so I don't think that it's impossible to criminally harass somebody on Twitter but
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.440]  that's not the case for mr. Elliott he had never seen these people other than
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:27.640]  the one dinner six months earlier he never he never indicated that he was
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:33.800]  watching them this was just political dialogue on Twitter and everyone
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:38.080]  obviously follows their subject to the rules on Twitter and actually one of the
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:43.240]  complainants asked Twitter to suspend mr. Elliott's account Twitter wrote back and
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:47.680]  said forget it the examples you've provided us do not violate the Twitter
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.520]  rules and in fact the examples you've provided us show us that it's a two-way
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:56.240]  conversation so amazing segment with Christopher Murphy after the break this
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:01.160]  is the Alex Jones show live don't go away the DC police chief urges citizens
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:05.960]  to fight back against peristyle attackers speaking with 60 minutes on
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:10.960]  Sunday Washington DC police chief Kathy Lanier urged residents to do what's
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:15.400]  necessary to save lives in the event of a terror attack or mass shooting whether
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:20.520]  it means run hide or fight if you're in a position to try to take the gunman out
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:24.720]  it's the best option for saving lives before police can get there linear said
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.800]  while acknowledging her latest suggestion was counterintuitive to previous
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.880]  tactics the police have advised linear claim that taking action may be
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.800]  essential to prevent another massacre like the attack in Paris which left over
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:42.480]  120 people dead we always tell people don't take action call 9-1-1 don't
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.080]  intervene in the robbery linear said we've never told people take action but

[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:20.400]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:27.720]  we're back live from the Alex Jones show Black Friday edition talking to Christopher Murphy the lawyer for Gregory Allen Elliot
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:33.520]  and this case is crucial and yet it's had relatively little mainstream media
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:37.560]  attention I know Christine Blatchford with the national posters being covering
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:41.600]  it apart from that there's not really a lot of information out there in the
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.560]  mainstream media about this case despite the fact that it could have
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:51.040]  fundamental implications for free speech on the internet and again before the
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.320]  break we were talking about the definition of harassment what these
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:59.280]  feminists were claiming constituted harassment was Mr. Elliot defending
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:04.040]  himself against accusations false accusations of pedophilia and tagging
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:08.040]  them in tweets simply tagging their name in tweets no direct contact
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:13.400]  whatsoever they used that they said that was harassment so Mr. Murphy pick up
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:17.800]  the story at what point was Mr. Elliot banned from using the internet entirely
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:23.880]  so one of his bail conditions were that he was not able to use the internet so
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:28.760]  yet they appreciate that at his bail hearing the evidence that was led was
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:34.160]  was kind of one-sided because the complainants had brought in just a select
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:40.600]  number of tweets and because Mr. Elliot was in custody we weren't able to access
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:44.240]  the remaining number of tweets we accessed some of them for the bail
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:49.120]  hearing but not all of them obviously and so one of his bail conditions was that
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:53.760]  he could not access the internet that ended up being changed a couple years
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:10:01.320]  later and in Canada anyway you have to get the prosecution's consent to change
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:06.240]  bail conditions unless you go to superior court and bring a what's what's a
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:10.960]  relatively expensive application so that wasn't done we had to ultimately get
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:16.240]  the the prosecution to consent to change the bail conditions to allow him to use
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:21.360]  the internet because he's an artist right he can't without the internet right
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:25.440]  yes so about a year and a half two years later he was allowed to use the
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:32.120]  internet for work and to defend to mount the defense for his trial and that was
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:38.440]  it so he couldn't he couldn't use social media basically oh no he's still not
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:42.640]  you still not to this day still not permitted to use social media until the
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:48.680]  judgment comes down on January 22nd amazing then there's this other aspect
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:52.640]  of this I don't know whether this is true or not this is what I read supposedly
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:56.160]  there was some evidence uncovered of one of Elliot's accusers I don't know
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:01.400]  which one being friendly with someone within the Toronto Police Department do
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:06.560]  you think that that if true had any impact on his treatment I don't know so
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:13.200]  I've heard some rumblings about that as well there was a third complainant that
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:21.080]  that was named just after mr. Elliot's bail hearing the crown withdrew the
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:24.360]  charge against mr. Elliot in relation to her so she never got called as a
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:30.280]  witness so I don't know I don't know the reason why the prosecution withdrew
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:35.520]  the charge against that that individual so you know obviously if she would have
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.880]  been called as a witness she would have been subjected to cross-examination by
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:43.920]  me on some of those points you just mentioned but I never got the cross
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.720]  examiner because that charge was dropped just before just before she was
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:53.080]  supposed to testify so I don't know I don't know the answers that question so
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.520]  this this starts to get real media attention this summer was the first time
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:02.040]  I heard about it most people heard about it then a couple of months later we
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.080]  had this incident at the coffee shop tell us what happened there right so this is
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:13.040]  just this is just about a month ago so mr. Elliot he's an artist and so he
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:18.040]  frequents this area of Toronto it's kind of it's kind of a say it's almost a
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:21.640]  kind of a little bit of a hippie neighborhood lots of public markets
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:26.000]  coffee shops he's been he's been frequenting that neighborhood for years
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.400]  he hangs some of his art and the art it's not paintings these were just
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:35.640]  statements I believe one of them were related to the court of public opinion
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:41.160]  one of one of the pieces of art so a woman comes into the coffee shop and
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:48.640]  orders a cup a cup of coffee turns around and throws the coffee on two of
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:55.360]  mr. Elliot's posters and this is after sorry I kind of stepped ahead this is
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:02.760]  after there had been a backlash against the coffee shop on Twitter and on
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:08.800]  Facebook basically demanding that this art be taken off the walls because it
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:17.400]  it it made the environment unsafe for women to attend and it wasn't even
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.560]  anti-feminist or anything right no no there's nothing on nothing in the
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.960]  posters nothing in the posters that was could could be construed in any way to
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:29.880]  be anti-feminist or threatening nothing and so the coffee shop wrote a very
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:34.800]  reasoned response on Facebook saying essentially listen mr. Elliot is
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.160]  innocent improved until proven guilty he's an artist we are not going to
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:44.880]  censure artists because they've got some charges against them and then a couple
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.680]  days after that a woman comes in throws the coffee on the art and I would have
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:54.400]  thought that that would have been received negatively by the people who
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:59.120]  have been kind of bullying mr. Elliot all along but the opposite was true this
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.040]  at this was a criminal offense that this this person committed by throwing the
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:08.360]  coffee on the the artwork is the offensive mischief this was being
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:15.600]  trumpeted afterwards as some sort of accomplishment that committing a criminal
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:20.880]  offense to facing an artist's work was somehow a good thing and that to me that
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:25.040]  was when for me I just I just decided this this whole thing is just it's just
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:32.760]  ridiculous and because if this is what is lauded on the internet and mr. Elliot
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:37.760]  expressing his right to in Canada there's a constitutional right to freedom of
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:42.880]  expression much like there is in the United States mr. Elliot is discussing
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:47.720]  political opinions on the internet some of which he agrees with some of which he
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.960]  doesn't he gets charged criminally for that but a person who goes in and
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.880]  commits a criminal offense by defacing an artist's work is lauded on the internet
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:01.320]  and it just is up and up as down black as white and again it goes to the point I
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:06.360]  mean we saw it with protein world those ads being defaced of course the company
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:11.480]  simply used it to their advantage and made millions more as a result but again
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:16.160]  it's the intolerance of free expression this artwork couldn't even be construed
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:20.600]  as offensive to anyone like that was even a you know something to consider in the
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.280]  first place so what was offensive what was offensive to the to this group was a
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:29.880]  fact that his name was on the bottom of it that's what made it unsafe for them
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:35.000]  to go into this coffee shop because Gregory Allen Elliot's name was literally
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.280]  written on the bottom of his own artwork and so therefore you can't go into that
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:43.200]  coffee shop because you feel unsafe Ryan because it was basically him
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:47.760]  standing up for himself and saying you can't ruin my entire life you can't ruin
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.760]  my you know my career with these public shaming tactics they didn't like that and
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:57.120]  so they went as they did with protein world and defaced the artwork right let's
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.080]  finish up let's talk about how we can help with the crowdfunding but what will
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.680]  the consequences potentially be for free speech on the internet if mr. Elliott is
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:10.720]  found guilty I personally believe that if mr. Elliott is found guilty there could
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:15.040]  be significant consequences because like I said before he didn't do anything that
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:18.920]  was threatening there are a lot of threats made on the internet that don't
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:22.680]  go investigated by the police death threats those should be investigated if
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.560]  you threaten to kill somebody on Twitter you should expect the police to
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.720]  knock on your door and arrest you for threatening to kill somebody but if you
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:37.480]  if mr. Elliott is convicted for defending himself a and and commenting
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:41.920]  on someone else's politics be then people got to be very careful about what
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.960]  they say and then if you're very careful about what you say and all of a sudden
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:49.440]  you're you're censoring yourself you're not able to freely express your own
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:55.720]  opinions and then that starts to detract away from what Canada and the US is
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:01.160]  supposed to be all about so I think it has a kind of a very significant impact
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:07.640]  because people who express their opinions without threatening can now be
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:14.000]  subject to criminal prosecution and that's a very scary concept and that's
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.360]  why people should be up in arms about this tell us about how people can donate
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:21.800]  to the crowdfunding campaign for mr. Elliott because this this has run up a
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:26.680]  hundred grand bill so far right right you know I don't actually know much
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:31.360]  about the crowdfunding campaign I'm not involved in that so I don't believe I
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:36.080]  can give you any answers to that I'm sorry I know that I know that there is a
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:41.440]  kind of link I'm gonna put a link up on Twitter here in the next break I believe
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.400]  it's already raised over $52,000 last time I checked so that link is going to
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:49.920]  go up on my Twitter at prison planet in the next break so people can check this
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:53.760]  out just in the final two minutes any more points on this that you wanted to
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:18:00.800]  raise before we conclude here well I I think that it's it's important that the
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:07.280]  public be made aware of these issues and that that mr. Elliott is and people like
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:12.960]  him are stuck up for because again this is not something that I believe should
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:18.000]  be criminalized in any democratic country and the more people that become
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.320]  aware of the facts of this case the better for my from my perspective
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:28.960]  because the facts of this case are on mr. Elliott side and if that's if that
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:32.800]  could help mr. Elliott get on with his life then I think that's good because
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.320]  this this there's been a there has been a fair amount of media attention to this in
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:43.000]  Canada and a lot of it a lot of the social media coming from the same
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.640]  complainants in this case and and their their group is very very negative and
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:52.560]  it's had a very detrimental effect on mr. Elliott's life is mental health it's
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:56.960]  been three years now he's been fighting this for over three years and he hasn't
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:01.680]  worked since he since since this these charges were laying it's it's it's had a
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:06.880]  real that really real impact on his life and this all comes to a head in
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:13.200]  January correct January 22nd is the judgment comes comes down yes okay we'll
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:17.560]  be sure to check in with updates as we get them Christopher Murphy thanks for

[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:40.280]  disagree with them under the banner of cyber violence under the banner of
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:43.920]  harassment and if this court in Canada which should have thrown out this
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:48.880]  ludicrous case within minutes goes along with it it's gonna have massive

[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:16.800]  on the Alex Jones show I'm your house Paul Joseph Watson just tweeted out the
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:21.880]  link for you to support Gregory Ellen Elliott this is the artist out of
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:26.280]  Toronto we just spoke to his lawyer who faces six months in jail for
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:30.720]  disagreeing with feminists again let's emphasize he did not send a threatening
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:35.880]  tweet or any kind of message that was threatening in nature at all he
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:40.880]  merely disagreed with feminists in saying they shouldn't shame and ruin a
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:46.200]  young kid's life for making an online video game simulation that was his
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:50.480]  crime and for that he faces six months in jail simply because these feminists
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:55.160]  claimed that they were threatened by him disagreeing with them again this could
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:59.520]  set an absolutely horrible precedent so go and support Gregory Ellen Elliott
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.640]  the link is on my Twitter at prison planet now we're gonna go to this
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:09.000]  special black friday report from Alex Jones here's a video I obsess over win
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.400]  wins and so I think I've got four different wins here I'm gonna break down

[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:24.600]  info or store.com through black friday through the weekend and until next
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:30.320]  Monday and at the same time you can get informed by watching this video on the
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:36.480]  fact that most black friday sales are a scam companies simply raise prices the
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:40.720]  week before and then lower them the week of the normal prices and in some stores
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.080]  do give better deals on black friday but it's one of the worst days of the year
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:49.840]  to shop and this is just a classic example of how people get screwed over
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.200]  because of lack of knowledge because they're not informed but by going to
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:57.800]  info or store.com you fund the very tip of the spear in the fight for human

[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.520]  time to get in traffic jams and to watch people acting like mindless consumer
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.320]  zombies now some people when I talk about black friday say hey wait you're
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:30.640]  criticizing the consumer zombies rushing Walmart or Target for video games or
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:36.240]  whatever fighting over toilet paper but then you're talking about your own
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:41.600]  black friday well yeah that's what we do we hijack globalist operations try to
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:45.720]  educate people about them and then try to take the attention that their scams
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:51.000]  are creating and siphon it off to wake people up it's like culture jamming it's
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.840]  like when I cover Miley Cyrus or Kim Kardashian it's not because I'm trying to
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:00.200]  cover fluff it's because I'm hijacking it using their names to then expose the

[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:29.640]  on the Alex Jones show I'm gonna go to your calls here in a few minutes we got
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:33.400]  Rob do as well with news popping in now of course one of the top stories on
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:39.200]  info wars.com yesterday was Donald Trump tweeting out a link to info wars now
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:44.680]  of course that's not a huge story in and of itself I've disagreed with Trump on
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:48.480]  some issues in the past for example you know he gave a speech a couple of days
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:52.880]  ago saying how great waterboarding was and that we should torture terrorists
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:57.880]  of course we know for a fact that waterboarding and torture doesn't work
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:02.800]  it only extracts false confessions but then he said we should do it anyway
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:06.480]  because look at what they're doing to us well we've been through that argument
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:11.080]  a million times America does not stand for torturing people especially given
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:15.760]  the fact that most of those people who came out of Gitmo were basically goat
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:20.080]  herders and taxi drivers I think there's like 90% of them were proven to have no
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:24.640]  connections to terrorism whatsoever and anyway it doesn't work so why would you
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:29.680]  sacrifice the national reputation of country on that premise I mean does
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:33.680]  America wants to turn into North Korea so I've disagreed with Trump on a lot of
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:38.240]  issues I'd still find the fact that he had a phone call with Bill Clinton two
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:43.200]  weeks before he announced his run for the Republican candidacy very odd
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:47.800]  indeed so it's not as if we've been you know in this full-on worship fest for
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:52.640]  Trump as many conservatives have but he did send out this tweet because there's
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:57.560]  been a controversy surrounding him over the past few days which is he basically
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:03.280]  came out and said there were thousands of Muslims celebrating 9-11 in New York in
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:10.440]  New Jersey on September 11 2001 the media came out and fact-checked him and
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:14.520]  said that this never happened there was no evidence of this so then Trump
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:19.040]  pointed to a Washington Post article which was published on September 18th
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:24.560]  which did make reference to Middle Easterners celebrating 9-11 basically
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:29.080]  you know cheering and hollering on top of a building as the plane went into the
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:33.040]  World Trade Center now of course people who have studied that kind of
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:38.560]  information for the past 14 years know that those individuals weren't Muslims
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:42.880]  they were Israelis this was the infamous case of the Israeli art students of
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:46.840]  course speculation at the time was that they were spies they had advanced
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:51.480]  knowledge of the plot and you can debate that ad infinitum but they weren't
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:56.680]  Muslims so Trump was wrong in that regard but it's not wrong to say that
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:00.880]  there's a ton of anecdotal evidence to suggest that there were Muslims
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:06.520]  celebrating 9-11 in New York and in New Jersey on that fateful day in fact there
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:11.000]  was a hashtag that Trump drew attention to where people were giving their
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.440]  stories people who lived in New Jersey who said they personally saw crowds of
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:22.920]  people up to a hundred people Muslims celebrating 9-11 so then infowars.com
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:28.600]  publishes this story out of biz pack review which is basically the writer's
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:34.160]  story of how she also personally saw Muslims celebrating 9-11 on the day of
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:40.840]  the attacks Trump tweets it out, tweets a link to infowars.com but of
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:46.280]  course that's not the story the story is the the crybaby plot hurt frothing
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:51.560]  meltdown in the immediate aftermath which was oh my god Donald Trump tweeted
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:56.440]  out the discredited infowars.com you know like we haven't been on the
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:00.760]  drudge report for five six years like we haven't been picked up by all these
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:05.200]  massive publications the fact that Trump did it this is surely gonna be the
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:11.840]  final straw for Trump this is gonna sink him of course complete baloney and yet
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:17.400]  the likes of Gorka came out with a headline I mean how short for news do
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:22.360]  you have to be to write about the fact that Trump tweeted infowars he's talked
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:26.200]  about us before we had the drug smuggling footage out of Mexico with
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:30.960]  Josh Owens and Joe Biggs Trump mentioned that in a live speech and again
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:33.920]  people got butt hurt over that like that didn't happen all that was
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:38.360]  discredited when we got the exclusive footage so then you have the likes of
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:43.720]  Gorka who of course routinely trying to ruin people's lives and abuse inside
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.960]  sources and the whole nine yards like they're the paragon of credibility
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:54.600]  Trump tweeted an infowars.com link and the election is still 348 days away like
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:59.520]  it was some kind of cardinal sin the article reads the text of this tweet is
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:04.760]  the headline of an article published on conspiracy theory suppository infowars.com
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:08.440]  in which a New Jersey resident argues that Donald Trump's claims about Muslim
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:12.840]  Americans celebrating the destruction of the World Trade Center or not fear
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:18.240]  mongering crypto fascist lies so again they're making light of it they've
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:24.560]  devoted an entire article to the fact that Trump tweeted infowars God forbid
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:29.440]  and of course the crybaby butt hurt meltdown from liberals on Twitter then
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.360]  commenced you also had the likes of think progress coming out with this
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:38.480]  headline Trump cites 9-11 truth or website to support his false claims
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:44.640]  about 9-11 of course the claims weren't false there are numerous anecdotal
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:48.720]  reports from individuals who were in New Jersey on that day you saw Muslims
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:53.120]  celebrating 9-11 so that's not false I mean maybe to claim that there were
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:57.120]  thousands is an exaggeration but the fact is numerous people now in the
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:01.360]  aftermath of this controversy are coming out and saying they saw the same
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:06.360]  thing but isn't it interesting that think progress comes out and immediately
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:10.640]  writes a headline about this similar to how media matters which is one of their
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:16.120]  affiliated organizations basically writes an article they don't do it anymore
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:19.280]  because it became too ridiculous but they used to write an article every time
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:25.040]  drudge linked to info wars like that was evidence of some dark seedy collusion
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:29.200]  and like that discredited drudge simply because he was linking to us which you
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:33.600]  know he hasn't done probably over a thousand times in the years since and
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:38.760]  of course think progress which we documented before is basically an
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:43.200]  Obama White House front group they have weekly meetings with the Obama
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:47.600]  administration and in fact the Center for American Progress Director which is
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:52.680]  the group behind think progress Jennifer Palmeri said the organization is
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:58.400]  focused around quote driving the White House's message and agenda these are
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:03.080]  the people that are attacking info wars that are attacking Trump merely for
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:08.360]  tweeting out an info wars link an Obama front group and admitted Obama front
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:13.000]  group headed up by Bill Clinton's former chief of staff John Podesta of course
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.880]  was also head of Barack Obama's presidential transition team so this
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:23.880]  is not an independent media organization this is a mouthpiece for the White
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:28.600]  House and now once again they're attacking us because they're all but
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:33.880]  her and crying over the fact that God forbid Donald Trump tweeted out info
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:39.680]  wars Paul Paul I just want to jump in here you got this Washington Post
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:43.880]  article from 2001 and here's a quote from it which we put in our article in
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:48.280]  Jersey City within two hours within hours of two jetliners plowing into the
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:51.320]  World Trade Center law enforcement authorities detained in question a
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:55.240]  number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the tax and holding
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:41:02.240]  tailgate style parties tailgate style parties on rooftops while they watched
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:06.480]  the devastation on the other side of the river yeah and that's the article
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:10.720]  that Trump drew attention to right and then the writer of that article who is
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:16.520]  a disabled reporter tried to back away from it so as soon as Trump was getting
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:19.920]  on the offensive and the media was starting to you know backpedal as a
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:23.560]  result this reporter said oh I don't remember writing that I don't know
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:26.920]  whether that's accurate or not he actually threw himself under the boss as
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:32.120]  part of this process so then they shift the controversy and claim that Trump
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:38.280]  was doing an insensitive impression of this disabled reporter and we've got
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:42.280]  the video now actually play the video this is the the huge new controversy
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:46.160]  about Trump that's not going to sink him like the previous 15 haven't let's go
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.800]  ahead with the video written by nice reporter now the poor guy you got to
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:54.760]  see this guy oh I don't know what I said ah I don't remember he's going like I
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:59.600]  don't remember the old baby that's what I said he was 14 years ago he still they
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:04.400]  didn't do a retraction that reporter he is talking about is Serge Kovalevsky who
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.520]  now works for the New York Times as you can see right there he suffers from a
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:12.560]  chronic condition that appears movement of his arms a Thai spokesman says they
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:17.080]  find it outrageous that Trump would ridicule the man's appearance so that's
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:20.960]  CNN talking about so basically they flipped the controversy into something
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:24.480]  else well it sounds like he was ridiculing his mind Paul it's not you know I
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:28.240]  don't remember 14 years ago you know that's what it sounded like to me that
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:32.360]  is what he was doing to this exactly so then Trump came out with this statement
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:35.920]  and said he didn't even remember the physical appearance or the disability of
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:39.680]  this report so he was ridiculing ridiculing him for what he said saying
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:44.240]  it was stupid and yet they're still trying to double down on this controversy
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:49.000]  to try and you know catch Trump power haven't they learned their lesson by now
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.600]  I mean there's an article out the Daily Caller 15 times Donald Trump said
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:59.040]  something people thought would damage his campaign and it didn't this goes back
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:04.680]  to July where he said that basically John McCain was not a war hero everybody
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:08.160]  said this would this would be the end of Trump this was the end of his campaign
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:12.560]  because they seem to be under the false delusion that people who vote for Trump
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:18.720]  Trump supporters actually care about Trump making politically incorrect
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:24.160]  statements if you can even call them that they don't care so how in any way is
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:28.600]  this going to sink his campaign when his campaign is supported by people who
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:33.240]  don't give a damn when he talks about illegal immigrants that was supposed to
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:37.680]  sink his campaign how dare he be so racist you know eventually most of his
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:43.200]  support came from that stance build the wall he was talking about you know
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:47.920]  giving out Lindsey Graham's phone number that was supposedly a dastardly act
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:52.720]  that would that would publicly shame and end his campaign in tatters absolutely
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:56.320]  nothing happened the whole Megan Kelly thing you know you could see there was
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:59.880]  blood coming out of her eyes blood coming out of her wherever oh my god how
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:04.760]  dare Donald Trump the misogynistic pig this is surely gonna sink him talking
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:10.720]  about Carly Fiorina's face again nothing happened he only got more popular so I
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:14.000]  don't know why they think that this controversy is gonna end him because it's
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.280]  clearly not he's gone on the offensive again against the New York Times and
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:23.720]  basically said you owe me an apology so again he's he's learned the lesson which
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:28.840]  is what I tweeted out last night never apologize for fake controversies whipped
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:33.920]  up by the perpetually offended drive-by media that's what it's all about this
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:38.320]  public shaming culture the only people who become victims of it are the ones
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:43.360]  who back down the ones who show weakness roll over in a fetal position and
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:46.720]  apologize for something that they shouldn't even apologize for and what
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:51.960]  was interesting about that was last night Trump didn't just retweet that he
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:56.720]  actually quoted me and sent it out to all his followers and then that caused
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:01.960]  more cry baby but hurt from the liberals and from the mainstream media and
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:07.200]  there was even Matt Taibbi out of the Rolling Stone again criticizing Trump
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:12.080]  merely for quoting me so again it's controversy after controversy he's the
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:15.200]  Teflon candidate I don't even agree with him on everything but it's just funny
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:19.680]  how these these fake controversies only seem to make him stronger have you got
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:23.200]  any more comments on that Rob well you know he said some things like I think
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:26.760]  we should put monitor bracelets on Muslims and he said some things that I
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:29.960]  don't agree with I don't think a wall is going to solve anything I think what
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:33.360]  you have to do is look at the policies that make people want to come to the
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:38.160]  United States and stop giving away so many freebies and you know we got to do
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:41.960]  something with the millions of people that are here illegally you're either
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:45.480]  gonna and you know he says he wants to ship them back it just seems it's
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:49.240]  turning into this prophecy that Alex Jones talked about about these FEMA
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:52.560]  camps and that is going to happen I think in the next presidency they're
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:56.480]  either going to create camps for the Muslims that are coming in or they're
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:59.160]  going to create them for the immigrants that they want to ship out and and then
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:02.040]  once those camps are built look out people because they're going to be
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:06.480]  coming for you next all right let's go to some of these calls now because they've
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:10.560]  been holding a while let's go to Steven Pennsylvania you're on the air Steve go
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:19.640]  ahead my call I'm an oathkeeper from Pennsylvania and currently in Pennsylvania
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:25.040]  we have a governor that that does not want to listen to the constituents that
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:36.760]  elected him by bringing in these these Syrian refugees and we've we have people
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:44.960]  put out the petition 70,000 people signed it 70,000 people from Pennsylvania
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:51.800]  signed it and our governor still has a budget with the legislature still won't
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:58.480]  listen to the people so we'll plan a rally likely next week sometime next
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:05.320]  week but I'm trying to get people organized here in Pennsylvania I'm trying
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:09.400]  to get governors organized constitutionalist veterans go nine yards
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:13.920]  because we don't need to come together we can't be fighting amongst ourselves we
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:18.280]  have to come together and like like Americans instead of being this but
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:24.240]  hurt my analytical tool that the government's been using to divide and
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:30.800]  conquer okay thanks to the call yeah but I mean didn't you hear what Obama said
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:36.440]  yesterday he said the Syrian Muslim migrants are just like the pilgrims on
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:40.880]  the Mayflower right of course then he had liberals saying on the same day that
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:45.360]  the pilgrims were genocidal religious extremists that they you know scout
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:49.960]  American Indians and whatever so they couldn't quite line up what was
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:54.720]  politically correct and what wasn't but you know Obama said that he's gonna
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:58.600]  forget about you know these ISIS jihadists who were gonna sneak in via
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:03.400]  the refugee wave Obama's already got that fixed he's going to the Paris
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:08.320]  climate conference to waffle on about global warming and he said that that
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:14.200]  would be a stunning rebuke to ISIS merely because he was going there to talk
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:18.440]  about global warming I'm sure the ISIS Rob do a quaking in their boots that
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:22.520]  Obama's going to waffle on about global warming for a few days right yeah
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:26.600]  exactly and then that climate change is causing terrorism in this world like we
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:31.360]  didn't have terrorism before and you know we I had arguments with my family
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:34.760]  about climate change last night and they start talking about the polar bears
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:39.080]  stuff that's been discredited the ice melting you know we're looking at an
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:42.840]  article the ice is getting bigger there's getting there's more ice coming up
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:46.720]  there now and I just pulled up that change org petition for the refuse
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:54.600]  refugees 71,000 people have signed it they need 3700 people to to get reached
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:49:00.720]  their goal of 75,000 and that's urged the governor Tom Wolf to refuse the
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:06.400]  admittance of refugees into our state and we played a report on the infor's
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:10.640]  nightly news last week that Dambodani went and shot at Rhode Island because
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:15.640]  their governor is also for bringing in Syrian refugees she seems to be like an
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:20.520]  Obama mouthpiece that has been elected over there and it was an amazing
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:24.120]  cross-section of people he interviewed talked to a lot of state reps who were
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:29.680]  informed talking about how the FBI is not allowing these has admitted that they
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:33.240]  can't vet these people they've admitted it the head of the FBI said we cannot
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:37.400]  vet these people we're not sure if they are going to be terrorists or not yet
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:41.720]  all the uninformed people who were for this and mostly they were Syrians who
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:44.520]  were saying look we got to bring these in these people are vetted it's mostly
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:49.960]  women and children I mean it's a it's a it's definitely a conundrum but what is
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:53.680]  what is happening what is what are the policies that our government has done
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:57.960]  that has put this sort of in motion this migrant crisis that is going on and if
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:50:03.480]  you look at let's see I believe it was headed up here a second ago there that
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:09.160]  ringleader of the of the terrorist group basically came out and said it was the
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:14.080]  open borders in Europe of the group that attacked in Paris basically came out and
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:16.880]  said it's because the open borders I was allowed to go freely in and out of
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:20.400]  these countries nobody was checking my passport and was basically laughing at
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:23.960]  it's a Reuters article ringleader of Paris attacks plan more strikes mocked open
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:30.240]  borders say his bragged about it yeah I mean just so those are the policies that
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:34.840]  are allowing this stuff to happen it's open borders it's favorable conditions
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:39.720]  to give people freebies to entice them to come and and then also it's our form
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:43.720]  policy of creating wars in areas and trying to destabilize governments around
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:48.680]  the world okay we'll be back with more of your calls Sean Sherry Robert on

[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:23.640]  course we had the shoot down of the Russian jet earlier this week now we
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:28.960]  got even more evidence of Turkey being complicit in selling ISIS oil funding
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:33.440]  ISIS arming ISIS we're gonna get into those stories subsequently but Alex
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:38.000]  Jones is back to comment on this Alex go ahead that's right Paul in between
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.920]  getting chores done for the company and the family today while you're taking over
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:46.440]  on Black Friday I read Kurt Nemo's article at info wars.com your gun promises
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:53.720]  war with Russia a Russia shoot down plane over Syria because we know that your
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:58.280]  gun last three years that said more than 14 times we wrote it for about two days
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:03.440]  ago that hey we're allowed to fly into Syrian airspace they even have used
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:07.600]  artillery in the Syrian territory claiming that it's in their strategic
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:16.880]  right so total hypocrisy and now he says because of these 250 mile range supersonic plane
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:21.560]  destroying missiles we're talking fifth generation super high tech anti-aircraft
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:25.960]  missiles the size of an aircraft I mean these are super hardcore missiles
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:30.360]  basically they're just supersonic giant cruise missiles that the Russians have
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:35.000]  brought in I mean these are usually nuclear tip these are super hardcore
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.600]  of course they're not nuclear tip right now that they go and fire a bunch of
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:42.920]  missiles up the front or a bunch of shrapnel but long story short Russia has
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:47.280]  moved in super high-tech weapons designed to take on NATO in the United States
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:54.280]  into the area there in Syria right on the border with Turkey and say okay next
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:58.480]  time you fly over tearing an airspace will blow you out of the sky hey tip for
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:03.920]  dad and your gun has shed basically this will cause the unthinkable you know
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:08.440]  we're gonna respond with full war so Turkey wouldn't have done this with a
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:14.240]  full NATO backing he's been given NATO backing just like they told Saddam you
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:18.360]  know back in 1999 to go ahead and take the weight on record so they're set Turkey up
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:23.280]  I mean I don't think NATO is gonna stand with Turkey if he goes along with this
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:26.960]  you see him in the news saying your gun may have destroyed NATO and all this
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:32.000]  stuff this is over the top fact I feel guilty not even being there today even
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.480]  though I was in this morning until like 11 even though I'm working on a bunch of
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:41.160]  stuff for the company and get the word out I feel guilty like I should be there
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:47.720]  but you're doing an incredible job so is what I do but this is so crazy when you
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:52.520]  realize that this is from the official Turkish news these quotes that Kurt
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:58.360]  Nino has in his article are linked to the official presidential ministry making
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:03.080]  these statements he actually says quote you are playing twilight Turkish
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:06.800]  airspace that are shot down it is an active war and we're going to war with
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:12.400]  Russia and I will not even tell you it's not speakable over and Turkey they have
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:17.200]  US nuclear weapons and medium-range missiles double the hit Moscow it's
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:22.840]  only 500 600 miles away right there so this is all World War three five level
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:28.720]  garbage extremism saying that this is so evil because here's our government
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:33.040]  backing ISIS in al-Qaeda all what's it I just want to add again funding this
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:37.280]  operation now more than ever it's so key we're having a big effect our news
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:40.800]  getting out trying to stop this that's why we have free shipping until next
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:47.720]  Monday and 995 colloidal silver normally 1995 in stores it's 25.5
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:51.320]  the exact same colloidal silver we private label it for the biggest
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:57.600]  manufacturer in the country silver bullet 995 at import store.com and I
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:01.320]  throw in this on my Friday because I don't think this will be the end of the
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:04.960]  world but it could become that the point is the elites are getting more and more
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:09.600]  reckless every day it is totally insane and I can't believe that more media in
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:16.280]  the US isn't opposing this homicidal genocidal over-the-top idiocy look give
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:21.640]  her to sit down Russian aircraft but why the airspace for nine seconds max and
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:26.920]  keep violating Syrian airspace this is just incredible and and the president
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:33.000]  said a curtain fall said you keep supporting Syria your terrorist that's
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:37.160]  why we're doing this and there are more after the break stay tuned in

[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:34.000]  Alex Jones online of course we put out the report that Turkey warned Russia to
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:39.680]  stop bombing ISIS otherwise it would have serious consequences that came out
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:44.840]  before the downing of this Russian fighter jet now Vladimir Putin is
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:50.040]  out saying US new flight path of plane down by Turkey President Vladimir
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:54.680]  Putin said Russia had given prior information to the United States of the
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:59.800]  flight path of the plane downed by Turkey on the Syrian border they're now
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:05.880]  calling this a planned provocation Alex well of course it's planned of course
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:11.560]  the United our government is run by sworn enemies of America
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:16.600]  these literal sworn enemies of George Washington of our second amendment of
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:20.640]  private property of the incredible Reynolds on to this America they are
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:24.920]  sworn enemies all people go to their head the people that run our country have
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:29.040]  hijacked it they want to extinguish liberty Russia is trying to build up a
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:33.400]  sovereignty it's slated for destruction they blew up the main power to Ukraine
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:39.000]  last week George Soros a raving psychopath demon is always trying to
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.680]  destroy the dollar is running around bombing at the mouth and they do with
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:48.280]  those planes where they set them up they were ready I mean it took a minute for
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:51.120]  those missiles to get to them but they admit they were only in aerospace died
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:58.200]  second this is total horse when they're and the truth is Turkey has been
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:04.920]  bombarding for four years with heavy artillery the Turkish Syrian military
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:11.400]  fighting back against the al-Qaeda on those are a garbage bin so all of this is
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:15.720]  going on and now Turkey has said we're gonna fly into your country whenever we
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:20.080]  want and if you shoot us down we're going to war with Russia and this is how
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:24.160]  this come operates this is what they're up to this is what they do this is who
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:29.760]  runs our country and just God help us God help us that we run by such

[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:29.680]  radio network my final hour of the Alex Jones show will be going to your calls
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:34.760]  here in this segment breaking news up on the Drudge Report. Black Friday protests
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:38.840]  the police shooting shuts down main Chicago shopping street they're out
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:44.360]  during Black Friday the Black Lives Matter protesters demonstrating against
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:49.360]  the shooting of Laquan McDonald of course unlike Michael Brown and some of
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:53.720]  these other shootings which were the evidence suggests justified if you watch
[02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:57.960]  the video of the Laquan McDonald shooting which has caused outrage over the
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:03.400]  past few days he was basically gunned down 16 bullets gunned down like a dog
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:08.440]  and from the video footage posed no threat to the officers so this is one
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:13.720]  of these cases like Eric Garner where you can understand the outrage but of
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:17.680]  course the solution to that given the fact that the cop responsible has been
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:22.960]  charged with first-degree murder is not to go out and loot and burn down your
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:27.880]  own communities as the mainstream media would support Black Lives Matter in
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:31.600]  doing so we had the Time Magazine article back during the Ferguson
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:37.080]  protests in defense of rioting and of course then we had the Baltimore riots
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:41.320]  these people going out burning down their own communities only causing damage
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:46.400]  to other black-owned businesses which of course is not the right way to respond
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:51.680]  even though in my belief in this case the Laquan McDonald shooting that outrage
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:57.240]  is justified because it was a clear example of police brutality but we've
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:01.880]  got huge changes at the Info Wars store right now Rob do's here to explain them

[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:22.680]  you know the nepotism involved in Turkey that you know apparently the Prime
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:27.600]  Minister son it's his oil company that's benefiting from all this cheap oil being
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:32.840]  produced by ISIS and they seem to be buying it left and right and funding
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:38.600]  this ongoing terror operation yeah that's right and we've got headlines today
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:42.760]  about that and again this is not just the Syrians saying this it's not just RT
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:47.080]  it's not the Kremlin saying this zero hedge did a big report on this the other
[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:50.800]  day which I tweeted out which I encourage people to check out basically
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:55.320]  there's headline out of Sputnik today though Erdogan downed SU-24 that's the
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:12:00.920]  Russian fighter jet to revenge son's disrupted oil business Turkey shot down
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:05.120]  Russia's bomber as revenge for the destruction of oil smuggling business
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:10.040]  that belongs to receive Erdogan son a Syrian minister stated and again it's
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:13.760]  not just the Syrians saying this people have dug in they've done the research
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:19.400]  the son of the Turkish president owns these oil companies these big tankers
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:24.320]  that ship the oil out he's sending it to Japan obviously he's buying it at half
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:29.080]  the price of the normal market rate because this is black market this is
[02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:34.360]  ISIS they've stolen the oil from Syria in Iraq they're selling it to Turkey
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:38.960]  half the normal rate and of course buying weapons to carry out the kind of
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:44.440]  massacres that we saw in Paris this is all happening with the full guarantee and
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:48.840]  approval of the Turkish government this is another article out of spice.com
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:54.080]  look who's helping ISIS trade oil illegally the main source of income for
[02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:58.880]  ISIS is illegal sale of oil this finance war and terror in Syria and Iraq and
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:03.080]  terrorism abroad like in Beirut and Paris to achieve this sale they must have
[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:08.300]  help and it's fairly obvious that Turkey is the main guarantor of this and so
[02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:13.160]  basically it's come out that this the son of the Turkish president in pursuit
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:17.440]  of this neo Ottoman Empire which the Turkish president is now trying to build
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:22.480]  again by allying with ISIS he's in control of these shipping companies these
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:27.840]  maritime companies he's made agreements with companies in Europe in Asia he's
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:33.920]  shipping it to Japan he's taking the stolen looted ISIS oil putting it on
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:38.880]  these ships and sending it off to Asia he's making a profit ISIS is making a
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:42.880]  profit and of course they're using the money to buy bombs and ammunition to
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:47.880]  kill European citizens this is just another example of Turkey being allied
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:52.920]  with ISIS and again it's not just Bashar al-Assad saying that it's not just
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:58.040]  Vladimir Putin saying that we had Wesley Clark the former NATO Supreme
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:02.920]  Allied commander come out on CNN a couple of days ago and say that Turkey is
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:09.400]  allied with ISIS we had the report from Nafiz Ahmed the large cash of
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:13.760]  intelligence documents that were recovered from an ISIS safe house raid in
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:19.760]  Turkey that found quote direct dealings between Turkish officials and ranking
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:25.680]  ISIS members we also had the quote out of Newsweek a former ISIS communications
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:31.240]  technician said that part of his job was to quote connect ISIS field captains and
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:38.960]  commanders from Syria with people in Turkey on innumerable occasions ISIS
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:43.360]  commanders told us to fear nothing because there was full cooperation with
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:48.600]  the Turks so reams and reams of evidence about how Turkey is allied with ISIS and
[02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:53.000]  of course the rebel jihadists the so-called moderate rebels that aren't
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:57.880]  moderate they're also defecting to ISIS they're giving their weapons to ISIS
[02:14:57.880 --> 02:15:02.920]  Turkey supports them as well because Turkey like the United States like NATO
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:08.600]  is more concerned about destabilizing and toppling the government of Bashar al-Assad
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:13.080]  than it is about getting rid of ISIS we had the Defense Intelligence Agency
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:18.880]  documents where the Pentagon foresaw the rise of a Salafist principality they
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:23.560]  knew their actions in Syria destabilizing the government arming these jihadist
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:29.400]  groups would lead to the rise of ISIS and of course ISIS is now fighting against
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:33.880]  Bashar al-Assad so all along and in their own documents it's been in their
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:39.800]  interest to keep ISIS in the field to not destroy ISIS which is why Obama
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:47.600]  waited 15 months before bombing ISIS oil fields and ISIS oil tankers whereas the
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:52.680]  Russians did it almost immediately and in fact there's another article on that
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:58.880]  today out of Gateway pundit former CIA director Obama didn't bomb ISIS oil
[02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:04.240]  because of environmental impact former CIA director Michael Morel said Obama
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:10.160]  did not bomb ISIS's oil infrastructure because of environmental concerns and if
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:14.360]  you believe that you believe anything of course we also had the report they were
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:19.280]  dropping leaflets to these people working with ISIS driving the oil tankers
[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:25.840]  giving them 45 minutes warning to flee from the scene Russia didn't give them
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:30.480]  the same warning they're wiping out ISIS's oil infrastructure to some effect
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:35.480]  and of course the Obama administration waited 15 months because again it's in
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:40.680]  their interest to have ISIS in the region to destabilize Assad not my words
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:45.800]  the words of the Pentagon who foresaw that in the first place let's go to one
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:49.400]  of these calls Antoine you've been waiting the longest you're on the air go
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:56.840]  ahead hi yeah I was thinking about what you were saying about the war and all
[02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:02.080]  this stuff and it is insane I think that you know I don't feel safe but it's
[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:10.320]  it's not it's not really about who feels safe or not and this war is yes crazy I
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:15.200]  was thinking like you know you guys got so much information you and Alex
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:19.520]  and I was thinking you know if if all of this is as bad as you say it is
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:22.920]  somebody should cast it you know take it to the bank you know and then some of
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:27.320]  this stuff is dangerous like like the terrorist attack stuff you can't really
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:31.600]  put out the information you know about a new terrorist attack that may happen but
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:35.440]  you know stuff is gonna happen you guys know this stuff but and like it's
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:42.320]  threatening that you know we out here in this this world and you know there's
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:45.840]  there's nothing we can do about it at small people but together we can at
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:51.680]  least put a voice in and try and get behind somebody or something that's a
[02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:57.800]  that's a good idea so I mean one thing we can do is and thanks for the call we
[02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:03.680]  can prevent Obama from importing a hundred thousand Syrian refugees as the
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:08.760]  media calls them into America given the fact that we know and the Paris massacre
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:14.360]  mastermind bragged about the fact that he exploited this program this refugee
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:19.920]  red carpet to get into Europe to carry out that attack so you can oppose it on
[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:24.600]  that level of course there's a massive backlash in Europe now of people who are
[02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:27.560]  being called Nazis by their own government who are simply trying to
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:32.320]  preserve their communities and who are opposed to bringing in potential jihadists
[02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:37.040]  who will kill them while they're sitting in cafes while they're in theaters as we
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:45.560]  saw in Paris Dion in Illinois you're on the air go ahead Dion yeah after the
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:52.600]  Russian jet was shut down a day after the Russians they did airstrike in
[02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:59.400]  Turkish on convoy in northern Syria headed to ita city did you hear about
[02:18:59.400 --> 02:19:04.760]  that it killed seven yeah that was one of the reprisal attacks it wasn't really
[02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:09.000]  reported widely in the media but it did happen that Russia took that action
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:14.200]  they're also cutting off economic ties with Turkey there was a big gas pipeline
[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:19.000]  deal I believe and a big nuclear power plant deal so Russia and Putin are
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:23.640]  taking these measures of course China came out the day after the shootdown of
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:29.120]  the Russian jet and said the Kremlin may take the decision to attack Turkish
[02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:33.080]  airliners and of course as Alex was talking about in the last segment now
[02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:37.560]  Erdogan has come out and said he's pledged to start a war over Russian
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:42.680]  anti-aircraft system in Syria basically said that if Turkish jet fighters are
[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:47.920]  targeted in Syria he will declare war on Russia that's basically the context of
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:52.680]  his statement so wild times indeed we'll be back on the Alex Jones show with more
[02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:57.760]  of your calls in the next segment info wars dot com

[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:40.680]  time you can get informed by watching this video on the fact that most Black
[02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:46.640]  Friday sales are a scam companies simply raise prices the week before and then
[02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:51.480]  lower them the week of normal prices and some stores do give better deals on
[02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:55.760]  Black Friday but it's one of the worst days of the year to shop and this is
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:25:00.160]  just a classic example of how people get screwed over because of lack of
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:05.200]  knowledge because they're not informed but by going to m4store.com you fund

[02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:32.680]  traffic jams and to watch people acting like mindless consumer zombies now some
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:36.280]  people when I talk about Black Friday say hey wait you're criticizing the
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:40.160]  consumer zombies rushing Walmart or Target for video games or whatever
[02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:46.640]  fighting over toilet paper but then you're talking about your own Black Friday well

[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:04.040]  like when I cover Miley Cyrus or Kim Kardashian it's not because I'm trying to
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:09.400]  cover fluff it's because I'm hijacking it using their names to then expose the

[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:38.960]  Turkish president and the Turkish president he was he was in prison I
[02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:47.200]  think it was in 1998 or so he was in prison for provoking the citizens and
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:55.600]  he's only Turkish president who was in the prison and his son he did not serve
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:29:00.720]  his military service because they said that he had a testicle cancer later on
[02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:05.720]  he had children and this family is so corrupt he's his father the Turkish
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:14.640]  president he he had a lawsuit pending on him because he forged the theater the
[02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:23.800]  city is here their ticket and like a few months ago I think they had another
[02:29:23.800 --> 02:29:30.320]  lawsuit pending on him for a high treason and he destroys all the lawsuit
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:38.000]  and he does not allow anybody to file a lawsuit on him and recently today he
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:42.520]  locked up two journalists in Turkey yeah I'm gonna get into that after the break

[02:29:57.920 --> 02:30:02.240]  in the second Democrat debate this last weekend those last minute changed the
[02:30:02.240 --> 02:30:06.200]  day before to talk about foreign policy because of the terrorist attacks the
[02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:11.560]  Sanders campaign was furious Bernie wasn't ready to talk about terrorism the
[02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:14.320]  moderator asked him if he still thought the greatest threat to national
[02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:18.600]  security was climate change absolutely in fact climate change is directly
[02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:21.640]  related to the growth of terrorism you understand what Sanders is saying
[02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:26.360]  climate change is directly related to terrorism terrorism has nothing to do
[02:30:26.360 --> 02:30:30.720]  with wars for oil and power it's not about a clash of cultures and as every
[02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:35.280]  liberal will tell you it has nothing to do with Islam so it must be climate
[02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:41.160]  change Bernie al Qaeda and ISIS were not created to fight climate change but
[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:45.080]  there is an indirect link Bernie Sanders won't tell you however if he even sees
[02:30:45.080 --> 02:30:49.640]  it al Qaeda and ISIS are creation of the same governments and multinational
[02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:53.240]  corporations that are trying to create a global government using terrorism and
[02:30:53.240 --> 02:30:59.360]  climate change as an excuse for for wars.com I'm David Knight your liver can

[02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:44.640]  Middle East of conflict is getting out of control bare-told CNN so more
[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:49.600]  prominent officials coming forward with these quiet apocalyptic quotes about
[02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:53.760]  world war 3 we're talking about the downing of the Russian fighter jet
[02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:58.800]  we're talking about how it's come to light that the son of the president in
[02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:05.240]  Turkey is basically the main guy running the looted ISIS oil shipments from
[02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:10.320]  Syria and Iraq into Turkey and then out into Europe and Japan of course we've
[02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:14.160]  had these accusations and in fact concrete evidence that ISIS is allied
[02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:19.600]  with Turkey now it's been revealed that the guy running the stolen looted ISIS
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:24.080]  oil supplies which funds hot at least half if not more of their terror network
[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:30.000]  is the son of the president of Turkey Bilal Erdogan this has come out not just
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:34.800]  out of Syrian Russian sources zero hedge did a big article on it and in fact
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:39.520]  we're talking to Bora in Turkey and in fact sure I think it was sherry in Texas
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:43.160]  wanted to talk about Trump call back in because I want to touch on Donald Trump
[02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:48.560]  once again and that whole controversy but Bora in Turkey how is the public
[02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:53.240]  sentiment what's the reaction to Turkey's downing of this Russian fighter jet
[02:34:53.240 --> 02:34:59.360]  and their sentiment towards the government in general okay there are like
[02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:05.160]  three types of people in this country the the first type they're the add on
[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:11.600]  supporters like Obama's supporters we call them the sheeple and they they have
[02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:17.520]  to confirm with his actions and so they're cool with it they make joke even
[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:23.760]  they even make jokes when you mention about Russia cutting off the natural
[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:31.960]  gas they just they just they just cannot even they have no answer to that like
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:37.400]  because if Russia cuts natural gas we are fucked because it's gonna be winter
[02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:44.880]  soon and excuse my language but we are all screwed and the third to the second
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:49.840]  type of people are the people educated people and those people know what's
[02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:54.440]  going on in this country and our country has been hijacked by foreign
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:59.880]  foreign companies and the countries and they know what's going on but there's
[02:35:59.880 --> 02:36:03.120]  nothing they can do about it because they're not aggressive as the first
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:07.400]  type the the add on supporters and the third type there those are the those are
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:11.120]  the people who don't care about anything and they gave up already because
[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:17.000]  everything is so hard in here unemployment is so high and there are
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:23.720]  other other problems in this country and apparently his supporters are making
[02:36:23.720 --> 02:36:30.120]  a fortune out of this there are car rental there are rental companies who
[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:36.360]  can give you a car plus the gas for 750,000 a month which is really cheap
[02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:41.960]  in here and God knows where the gas is coming from and if you're his people
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:48.120]  but another point that you mentioned and of course again this is a
[02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:51.800]  completely corrupt dictatorship we've now got in Turkey you mentioned the
[02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:55.640]  fact that these journalists who report on these ties between the Turkish
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:36:59.800]  government and ISIS are either finding themselves killed in mysterious
[02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:04.520]  circumstances or put in prison we got an associated press article today two
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:08.480]  Turkish journalists have been jailed for reporting that Turkey was smuggling
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:13.240]  arms to Syrian rebels we've got another story out the independent journalist
[02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:18.640]  reporting on ISIS dies in Turkey in suspicious circumstances again another
[02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:23.560]  one of these reporters who was doing reports writing articles about the
[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:28.520]  fact that Turkish government Erdogan was tied in allied with ISIS we have
[02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:32.480]  another article here two Syrian journalists beheaded in Turkey's
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:38.800]  southeast again beheaded by ISIS within Turkey so how do people who make this
[02:37:38.800 --> 02:37:44.160]  connection get treated in Turkey judging by these headlines
[02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:51.280]  well they are threatened indeed as a matter of fact a typical citizen is
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:57.520]  threatened indeed in this country on daily basis from from your workplace to
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:02.800]  public transportation the cops harass you all the time and you have no rights to
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:09.080]  sue anybody you have no rights you have no civil rights you cannot make
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:13.040]  complaints on anything you cannot you cannot complain the government you
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:17.000]  cannot file complaints about the government you cannot be against the
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:22.040]  government and if you're if you're not Muslim you're screwed and further
[02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:28.600]  furthermore I believe that he's being threatened because I was working on a
[02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:35.600]  like an internet show like a cartoon show and after I was promoting about the
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:41.360]  show I also got threatened too it had some footage about rigid type Erdogan
[02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:46.720]  and some footage about him and it was a cartoon in it and cartoons in it and
[02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:51.520]  then later on I started getting these weird threats from people and people like
[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:57.280]  following me around and shit excuse my language so I believe that they are
[02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:02.240]  threatened and but they're doing their job because their journals that's what
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:09.640]  they do for living and they are probably they're gonna hold them in prison for a
[02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:14.680]  long time without any charges well they have some false charges but they're
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:17.720]  gonna hold them in prison for a long time after they condition that they
[02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:20.920]  conditioned them they're gonna release them because they're gonna be these
[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:24.600]  people are gonna have fear of their lives and if their family's lives that's
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:27.480]  how everything works in this country because there's there's no law there's
[02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:31.840]  no law at all it's completely lawless and corrupt and thanks for the call
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:36.400]  really fascinating stuff Bora be sure to call in when Alex is hosting on future
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:40.000]  issues because we'll be sure to revisit this topic but thanks for the call
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:45.160]  Bora from Turkey Sean in Canada we're gonna go to Shari but Sean in Canada
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:50.240]  you've been holding the longest you're on the air go ahead Sean hi Paul
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:55.000]  great to speak with you thanks for letting me on I was just wanting to
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:40:01.800]  comment about this ridiculous free speech Twitter criminal harassment case
[02:40:01.800 --> 02:40:07.840]  going on up here I've never perhaps never been more ashamed of the laws in
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:13.400]  this country and lengths that people take them to the to stifle free expression
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:21.400]  and speech is just shameful that's Gregory Allen Elliot the defendant the
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:25.200]  poor guy I really hope that once this is all done he's given reparations because
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:31.040]  these creatures that are just setting up to destroy his life have no remorse it
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:36.200]  seems and they're using the state as their personal attack dog and for some
[02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:43.480]  reason the crown the crown attorney's soft fit to allow them to do it which I'm I
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:48.000]  think it's just incredible I mean it's the main fact that it wasn't thrown out
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.120]  within minutes but the good news is you know from this having basically no
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:55.840]  attention a few months ago there were a few reports about it now he's raised
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:41:01.360]  over $52,000 this court case has cost him over a hundred thousand dollars
[02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:06.480]  already again is what his life has been completely ruined by these insane
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:12.120]  repressive cry bully feminists over tagging them in some tweets over
[02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:16.720]  defending himself over fake charges that he was a pedophile over defending a
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:20.800]  young kid whose life they tried to ruin because he made an online computer game
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:24.480]  and this is how these feminists act and they're not just ruining individual
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:28.640]  people's lives they want to ruin free speech on the internet they want to make
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:33.680]  it a criminal harassment a form of criminal harassment and a form of cyber
[02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:37.720]  violence if you merely disagree with them on Twitter that's what they got up in
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:42.160]  front of the UN and said with Anita Sarkisian and Zoe Quinn but Sean thanks
[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:46.080]  for the call really appreciate it Shari in Texas you wanted to talk about Trump
[02:41:46.080 --> 02:41:52.560]  go ahead thank you Paul this is the media versus Trump because of the media's
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:55.840]  divisiveness and their misinformation that's been going on for I don't know
[02:41:55.840 --> 02:41:59.400]  how long the media as far as I'm concerned has shut themselves in the
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:04.680]  foot and and way before Trump came on the scene and they don't see they don't
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:09.200]  get it or maybe they do I don't know that it's us against the media and then
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:15.920]  Trump comes along and he's on our side so now every time the media picks on him
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:21.320]  or fills films him under the jaunty yellow light seems to be popular now or
[02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:26.080]  every time they quote him out of context all they all they're doing really is
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:30.880]  strengthening our resolve to stand by him and then they wonder why his numbers
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:36.040]  keep going up you know well they need to look to themselves because they've they
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:41.920]  they lost our respect a long time ago is what's interesting about this the
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:46.360]  heels come out with an article GOP in panic over Trump the Republican
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:50.520]  establishment is nearing full-blown panic about Donald Trump the demise of
[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:54.200]  Trump's candidacy has been predicted by centrist Republicans and the media are
[02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:59.280]  like virtually since the day it began but there's no empirical evidence at all
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:03.720]  to suggest it's happening as you just said last month think progress collated
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:08.240]  more than 30 predictions of the business moguls imminent demise one typical
[02:43:08.240 --> 02:43:12.280]  example was the Washington Post Jonathan Capehart who said quote the
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:16.800]  beginning of the end of Trump in mid-July soon after the mogul criticized
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:21.360]  the Vietnam War record of senator John McCain so more than 30 predictions from
[02:43:21.360 --> 02:43:25.680]  these mainstream journalists stretching back nearly six months ago that these
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:30.920]  fake scandals would result in the demise of Trump and again you had this panic
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:36.840]  which makes no sense to me within the Republican Party that if Trump gets the
[02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:41.360]  domination for the Republicans he can't possibly beat Hillary Clinton and while
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:46.080]  that may have been true as recently as a few weeks ago if you actually look and
[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:51.960]  this is out of real clear politics general election Trump versus Clinton this
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:56.120]  is a hypothetical matchup between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton if they went
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:44:01.400]  head-to-head the polls from a couple of weeks ago show that Clinton was ahead at
[02:44:01.400 --> 02:44:06.800]  one point she had a 15-point lead over Trump that suddenly collapsed to one
[02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:11.440]  point and now in the aftermath of the Paris massacre which of course went a
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:15.280]  long way to proving Trump's point about these refugees three of them at least
[02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:20.400]  slipped in through Europe via this migrant red carpet now a Fox News poll
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:24.880]  shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head with Hillary Clinton Trump would
[02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:30.760]  come come out on top he's now plus five compared to Clinton being plus 15 as
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:35.560]  little as a month ago so this whole idea that you know Donald Trump can't beat
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:40.920]  Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head is beginning to be proven wrong by the
[02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:45.720]  polls whether that continues remains to be seen but I think it's completely
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:50.840]  inaccurate to say they have no chance whatsoever and that is the reason given
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:55.320]  by these establishment Republicans as to why they're trying to sink Trump and
[02:44:55.320 --> 02:44:59.960]  why they're in such a panic about him and why they try to hijack these fake
[02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:04.120]  controversies it's not just the left wing you know to try and to try and
[02:45:04.120 --> 02:45:07.200]  demonize Trump over and over again there's a daily caller article which I
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:11.000]  mentioned before 15 times Donald Trump said something people thought would
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:17.120]  damage his campaign and it didn't again example after example he is the Teflon
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:20.880]  candidate I don't agree with him on everything but the mere act of him
[02:45:20.880 --> 02:45:26.120]  daring to tweet info wars.com or quote me caused another major meltdown like
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:30.760]  that was gonna sink him again already blown over but we're gonna see more and
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:35.480]  more controversies manufactured about Donald Trump in the weeks and months to
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:39.320]  come let's go to more of these callers who's been holding the longest we got
[02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:46.520]  Robert in Missouri go ahead Robert you're on the air oh yeah my question was
[02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:54.400]  about this whole attack on language now when I was in college I learned that the
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:46:00.360]  scientific name for language in English is argument and then they I said
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:06.440]  something about it and then I was quickly shut up by the teacher you know
[02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:13.680]  that's okay and you know everything but my question was who is authority on
[02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:20.080]  making revising and editing the English language because I've asked that question
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:26.280]  so many times and tried to look it up but I haven't got any answers and I think
[02:46:26.280 --> 02:46:34.200]  one of the core things of tyranny is a control over language and not only the
[02:46:34.200 --> 02:46:40.680]  censorship but control the creation revision editing of it and I don't know
[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:49.520]  if you know who has control over our English language well of course the
[02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:53.440]  dictionary itself is not going to shrink it's not going to be like Orwell's
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:58.120]  1984 where they had the you know the annual new speak dictionary where they
[02:46:58.120 --> 02:47:03.560]  removed words for the express purpose of constraining people's ability to think
[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:08.240]  and be critical and dissent against the state what we're seeing is this
[02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:12.480]  politically correct move to denounce certain words and say that you can't use
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:17.400]  certain words such as the word retarded I mean for years these feminists these
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:20.400]  social justice warriors have been on Twitter saying you can't use the word
[02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:24.240]  retarded for anything of course if you ask most disabled people they don't
[02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:29.160]  really care it's these social justice warriors getting offended on behalf of
[02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:34.320]  other people and then they they try and redefine the meaning of words so if you
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:38.360]  talk about feminism people say oh how could you dare to disagree with
[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:42.600]  feminism it just means equality right just look it up in the dictionary it
[02:47:42.600 --> 02:47:47.640]  means equality of the sexes it doesn't matter what it says in the dictionary if
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:51.520]  you're taking that word that concepts and applying it in a completely
[02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:55.680]  different way then you're changing the meaning so feminists take feminism turn
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:48:00.240]  it into radical feminism and it becomes about the supremacy of women it becomes
[02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:04.840]  about mishandry manhating so it doesn't matter what it says in the
[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:10.320]  dictionary modern third wave feminism is not about equality based on the way
[02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:15.960]  feminists behave themselves and how they apply third wave radical feminism so
[02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:17.960]  that's how they're changing the meaning of words
[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:22.560]  dumbing us down telling us we can't say certain things and that's the new breed
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:27.080]  of political correctness that threatens free speech we've got Justin in
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:33.040]  Pennsylvania you're on the air go ahead Justin hello yeah you're on the air go
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:38.440]  ahead yes I was going on a serious situation
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:47.920]  far as Putin I what's your what what are you guys view on Putin is he um is he
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:54.960]  in with a new order or I read his new American magazines there were there were
[02:48:54.960 --> 02:48:59.880]  a number of statements I believe a couple of years ago from top elitist within
[02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:05.120]  America I think I remember writing an article about this the Putin's actions
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:09.080]  in Crimea and towards Ukraine meant that he had been basically severed kicked
[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:14.000]  out of the quote you know New World Order the Anglo-American establishment so I
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:18.840]  genuinely believe that he's trying to lead this multi-polar world in
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:23.600]  opposition to the unipolar world and that's why there's such a big clash with
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:27.560]  regard to Syria with regard to Turkey in the downing of this jet so no I don't
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:31.320]  think I don't think Putin's part of the New World Order I think he not that he's
[02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:35.000]  a good guy obviously but he stands steadfast against that based on his
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:39.480]  actions over the past couple of years we're gonna go to more of your calls
[02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:44.080]  maybe squeezing another one after the break again we were talking about these
[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:49.040]  Syrian journalists these Turkish journalists who are being put in prison
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:54.360]  beheaded killed in mysterious circumstances for criticizing the
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:50:00.040]  corrupt government of Turkey the son of the president of Turkey is the main guy
[02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:06.320]  running the ISIS the looted ISIS oil supplies that's now coming out so it's
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:10.240]  it's basically a deluge now I mean it this was rumbling before the shootdown
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:15.160]  of the Russian jet but now it's pouring out and waves the fight how deep this
[02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:20.360]  alliance runs between Turkey and ISIS another article out of the telegraph
[02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:24.800]  Barack Obama plan to defeat ISIS dismissed by US intelligence experts
[02:50:24.800 --> 02:50:29.560]  president Barack Obama's attempts to destroy ISIL has been derided by Western
[02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:33.400]  diplomats and his own former intelligence officials and again it goes to the
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:36.800]  point and the New York Times came out and said that they basically tried to
[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:42.600]  cover up the fact for 15 months that it was never designed to destroy ISIS they
[02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:48.640]  held back on bombing the oil tankers the oil fields for 15 months specifically
[02:50:48.640 --> 02:50:52.600]  because they wanted to keep ISIS in the region to overthrow Assad will be back

[02:53:05.640 --> 02:53:09.640]  have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we
[02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:12.840]  typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the
[02:53:12.840 --> 02:53:17.120]  need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking about staying
[02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:21.360]  warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will I keep my
[02:53:21.360 --> 02:53:25.400]  family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the problem
[02:53:25.400 --> 02:53:29.880]  with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another
[02:53:29.880 --> 02:53:33.760]  concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in
[02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:37.840]  times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers

[02:54:13.920 --> 02:54:17.620]  on the Alex Jones show we got the fourth hour coming up breaking news though up on
[02:54:17.620 --> 02:54:22.760]  drudge report dot com red linked active shooter situation reported near Planned
[02:54:22.760 --> 02:54:28.360]  Parenthood in Colorado Springs reports of multiple people shot an active shooter
[02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:33.720]  was reported near a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs the officers 3 480
[02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:38.680]  Centennial Boulevard scanner traffic indicated at least two officers were
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:43.000]  down one near a dumpster and another taken by ambulance to hospital a
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:48.920]  dispatcher said one patient was wounded and basically several wounded at least
[02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:54.920]  in this shooting officers down that report is just coming out of course if
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:54:58.480]  this pans out to what it looks like it's going to be the left is going to be
[02:54:58.480 --> 02:55:01.640]  gleefully rubbing its hands together we've had the whole debate about
[02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:06.920]  defunding Planned Parenthood for months now in the aftermath of this series of
[02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:10.880]  videos produced by the Center for Medical Progress which of course have
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:15.480]  completely demolished the reputation of Planned Parenthood and led to this drive
[02:55:15.480 --> 02:55:21.360]  in Congress to defund the organization Rob I'm sure you'll be picking up on
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:25.240]  that in the fourth hour what else do you have for us in the fourth hour yeah I
[02:55:25.240 --> 02:55:29.040]  just saw that as well during the break I started printing out the articles from
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:33.840]  that shooting in Colorado Springs so we'll be keeping you it looks like you
[02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:36.680]  know Planned Parenthood is going to get a chance to play the victim out of this
[02:55:36.680 --> 02:55:39.680]  saying see look at what the horrible gun owners have done so we'll see how that
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:44.520]  all plays out and wind up seeing if it's a white male that everybody's warning
[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:49.040]  us about who was the shooter or if they'll ever even find the shooter but
[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:52.080]  I'm also going to look at some a couple other things we're going to be playing
[02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:58.160]  some Black Friday reports John bound just put one up in in my email so we're
[02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:01.440]  gonna be playing that one it's a new one about the complete idiocy of Black
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:06.200]  Friday and we played this report a few days ago and I might revisit part of it
[02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:10.400]  again just we went out Liam McAdoo went out and talked to people about Black
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:14.120]  Friday and if we should change it to you know something more hospitable like
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:17.760]  gift purchasing Friday and a lot of people were thinking that Black Friday is
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:22.160]  racist and should be changed the name should be changed so I'm also going to
[02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:25.880]  be showing you guys some Hillary Clinton we're having this Hillary Clinton
[02:56:25.880 --> 02:56:29.680]  contest to make fun of Hillary because if we don't exercise our right to free
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:33.560]  speech we are going to lose it as you could see with the guests that we had
[02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:37.040]  earlier today the guy who made a tweet just saying he didn't agree with
[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:41.280]  feminists is now being attacked and sued and could face prison time so we're
[02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:45.560]  having this Hillary make fun of Hillary Clinton contest to defend the First
[02:56:45.560 --> 02:56:49.960]  Amendment I'm gonna have three examples of the contest that people have sent in
[02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:54.560]  I've been checking my email for that all weekend and some pretty funny entries so
[02:56:54.560 --> 02:56:58.840]  we're gonna show them to you guys and and then I'll take some calls so that's
[02:56:58.840 --> 02:57:02.680]  what we'll be looking at I'll definitely be on this active shooter in Colorado
[02:57:02.680 --> 02:57:06.760]  spring situation we'll see what's going on there yeah that's obvious obviously
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:11.640]  we hope that no one was seriously hurt if there are fatalities that's gonna blow
[02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:17.080]  up into a huge media narrative about how anyone who criticizes Planned
[02:57:17.080 --> 02:57:22.080]  Parenthood sides with this maniacal shooter whoever he turns out to be so
[02:57:22.080 --> 02:57:26.880]  again hope no one seriously hurt will continue to monitor that final story here
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:31.040]  out the Daily Call a Persian Muslim Gulf states have accepted no Syrian
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:35.080]  refugees while the United States and Europe argue over how many Syrian
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:41.480]  refugees to allow in the richest Persian Gulf states have accepted exactly zero
[02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:46.880]  still to this day in fact you had Saudi Arabia had the recent hodge pilgrimage
[02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:52.400]  they've got tents that can house 300,000 people that are empty for 51 weeks of the
[02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:56.960]  year and they're not using them and the reasons given for not allowing these
[02:57:56.960 --> 02:58:00.880]  refugees into these Gulf Arab states which are wealthy and rich and can take
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:05.360]  care of them is that they fear terrorism they fear that they won't be
[02:58:05.360 --> 02:58:11.520]  integrated into society meanwhile even as Germany's top police chief warns that
[02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:17.120]  ISIS is hiding among refugees entering Europe we have to accept them we have to
[02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:21.520]  roll out the red carpet without any questions whatsoever and people who
[02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:26.760]  criticize that and are being hunted down as thought criminals on Facebook by the
[02:58:26.760 --> 02:58:31.720]  German ex-starzy that's the situation that's how bad it's got fourth hour with

[03:00:37.520 --> 03:00:41.600]  Colorado Springs shoots multiple people including police officer at Planned
[03:00:41.600 --> 03:00:46.320]  Parenthood clinic now what was funny not funny about this but when we went to a
[03:00:46.320 --> 03:00:50.360]  Planned Parenthood clinic to protest which is what we are obligated to do in
[03:00:50.360 --> 03:00:56.240]  defense of the unborn child children out there we were attacked by this pack of
[03:00:56.240 --> 03:01:00.880]  communists that all joined hands together and then try to proceed to mow down
[03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:05.840]  people old people people who are disabled they pushed one guy in the
[03:01:05.840 --> 03:01:10.640]  street who you know this guy can can bear you know his trouble walking and I
[03:01:10.640 --> 03:01:13.680]  mean it's just amazing how these people just totally did not like the fact that
[03:01:13.680 --> 03:01:17.680]  we were out exercising our right to free speech we didn't bother them when they
[03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:20.600]  were putting up their signs they started making homemade signs we didn't say
[03:01:20.600 --> 03:01:25.200]  anything to them but then they started launching into us grabbing microphones
[03:01:25.200 --> 03:01:28.800]  they ripped a microphone out of Alex Jones's hand and then proceeded to run
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:34.200]  away but just distasteful tactics and is of course something like this a shooting
[03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:39.160]  at a Planned Parenthood clinic is distasteful and we definitely don't
[03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:43.040]  agree with that here at Info Wars and hopefully nobody is seriously hurt but
[03:01:43.040 --> 03:01:46.240]  it appears that the gunman may be barricaded inside and we'll be bringing
[03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:51.000]  you more information about this now amongst all this other black Friday
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:55.960]  madness I'm gonna get into some articles about weaponized drones especially
[03:01:55.960 --> 03:02:00.840]  ground drones China has unveiled armed attack robots armed with guns and
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:06.000]  grenades and this is nothing new we've seen this in the United States the army
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:11.880]  is testing remote controlled weapons towers so all these devices being built
[03:02:11.880 --> 03:02:16.920]  are gonna have their own type of command system which will either you know it's
[03:02:16.920 --> 03:02:20.040]  gonna look at things or if you don't have the right biometric if you don't have
[03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:24.160]  the right walk if they perceive any type of threat they may open fire on you
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:29.280]  whether you're you know whether you need to be open fire on or not so that is
[03:02:29.280 --> 03:02:33.960]  really concerning and that just brings to mind these Terminator robot scenarios
[03:02:33.960 --> 03:02:37.320]  that we've seen movies about and just this is the beginning of it we're now
[03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:42.480]  seeing like I guess this is the first inning of this robot situation we're in

[03:08:53.960 --> 03:08:58.680]  everybody's mobbing in to get their free goodies we have a report coming up from
[03:08:58.680 --> 03:09:01.720]  John bound black Friday is now unofficially a global holiday phenomenon
[03:09:01.720 --> 03:09:04.880]  the day after Thanksgiving that harkens the beginning of the month long
[03:09:04.880 --> 03:09:08.440]  celebration of consumerism regardless of the fact that Americans can't even
[03:09:08.440 --> 03:09:13.920]  afford the holiday system 62% have less than a thousand and savings and 21%
[03:09:13.920 --> 03:09:18.080]  don't have any savings at all and for instance the mega soul sucking Walmart
[03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:21.640]  chains deliver Chinese goods to the most depleted American population while
[03:09:21.640 --> 03:09:26.240]  slave wage Walmart employees are subsidized by our tax dollars and he
[03:09:26.240 --> 03:09:28.960]  talks about the history of this as well how it goes back to the 19th century
[03:09:28.960 --> 03:09:34.600]  gold swindling conspiracy so we're gonna get into all that and he ends it with
[03:09:34.600 --> 03:09:37.680]  of course merry Christmas zombies because there they are right there looking
[03:09:37.680 --> 03:09:43.240]  for their free goods our cheap goods I mean this is just crazy what we've
[03:09:43.240 --> 03:09:48.920]  become and how this is all just meant to condition us to buy these products that
[03:09:48.920 --> 03:09:55.000]  have a little or no significance in your life overall so that is you can watch
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:58.360]  more that just type in black Friday madness in YouTube and you can find
[03:09:58.360 --> 03:10:01.360]  other people that have put up videos so let's go now to John Bounds report and
[03:10:01.360 --> 03:10:04.440]  we're gonna go to our caller from Paris
[03:10:06.880 --> 03:10:12.880]  black Friday is now unofficially a global holiday phenomenon the day after
[03:10:12.880 --> 03:10:16.600]  Thanksgiving that harkens the beginning of the month long celebration of
[03:10:16.600 --> 03:10:21.080]  consumerism regardless of the fact that most Americans can't even afford the
[03:10:21.080 --> 03:10:26.840]  holiday season 62% of Americans have less than a thousand dollars in savings
[03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:33.320]  and 21% don't have savings at all sales expected to reach $80 billion in the
[03:10:33.320 --> 03:10:39.680]  U.S. the average Americans spending close to $400 throughout the holiday
[03:10:39.680 --> 03:10:44.160]  weekend while the mega soul-sucking Walmart chains deliver Chinese goods to
[03:10:44.160 --> 03:10:48.920]  most of the depleted American population while slave wage Walmart employees
[03:10:48.920 --> 03:10:54.040]  are subsidized by our tax dollars allowing the Scrooge-Walton family to
[03:10:54.040 --> 03:10:59.160]  rip out the heart of America and crush small business the irony is that black
[03:10:59.160 --> 03:11:04.760]  Friday stems from a 19th century gold swindling conspiracy and now in the name
[03:11:04.760 --> 03:11:09.640]  of almighty consumerism Americans are being swindled out of their last dimes
[03:11:09.640 --> 03:11:29.760]  ethics and common sense black Friday is a complete scam based around the
[03:11:29.760 --> 03:11:34.920]  manifestly provable hoax that consumers are getting huge discounts on products
[03:11:34.920 --> 03:11:39.880]  that would normally be more expensive at any other time of year in reality stores
[03:11:39.880 --> 03:11:44.360]  enjoy higher profit margins during the holiday period because retailers
[03:11:44.360 --> 03:11:50.240]  artificially inflate prices of goods in the months before black Friday in order
[03:11:50.240 --> 03:11:54.840]  to make the subsequent discounts look good in comparison as the Wall Street
[03:11:54.840 --> 03:11:58.880]  Journal highlights the idea of black Friday discounts is a complete hoax
[03:11:58.880 --> 03:12:03.080]  achieved via the process of price massaging throughout the rest of the
[03:12:03.080 --> 03:12:07.880]  year the scam also relies on shoppers impulse buying another product that has
[03:12:07.880 --> 03:12:13.920]  a 98% markup value so even if the first item represents a genuine discount the
[03:12:13.920 --> 03:12:19.520]  vastly inflated price of the impulse purchase more than makes up for in many
[03:12:19.520 --> 03:12:24.440]  cases the supposedly great deals that people will sacrifice endless hours of
[03:12:24.440 --> 03:12:29.040]  their time camping outside stores to take advantage of are already available
[03:12:29.040 --> 03:12:36.000]  online anyway and can be found for even cheaper in January but hey nothing says
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:40.560]  Christmas like bravingly cold on Thanksgiving night to rip a vegetable
[03:12:40.560 --> 03:12:45.280]  steamer out of the hands of an innocent little kid
[03:12:45.280 --> 03:12:59.960]  what is behind the horrifying phenomenon of black Friday and other extreme
[03:12:59.960 --> 03:13:07.800]  consumerist riots what is behind it is the madness of a lost society people
[03:13:07.800 --> 03:13:13.480]  that believe in hype people that believe in mainstream media lies folks that
[03:13:13.480 --> 03:13:16.520]  don't know that black Friday is one of the worst days of the year to go out and
[03:13:16.520 --> 03:13:20.920]  find sales these are the same type of crowds that believe in Obamacare and
[03:13:20.920 --> 03:13:26.160]  thought that it would really be a free ride or who go and buy lottery tickets
[03:13:26.160 --> 03:13:31.600]  that's their future business plan that's their retirement plan these are
[03:13:31.600 --> 03:13:36.480]  born suckers and statistically there are more and more of them
[03:13:36.480 --> 03:13:47.800]  merry Christmas zombies John bound for info wars calm and of course we ended
[03:13:47.800 --> 03:13:52.080]  that report with the evil racist misogynist saying of merry Christmas
[03:13:52.080 --> 03:13:55.200]  which I think is another report we're gonna go out and do talk to people about
[03:13:55.200 --> 03:13:58.440]  do they say merry Christmas do they say happy holidays do they say happy
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:02.560]  Kwanzaa do they say happy Hanukkah what do they say and if they're if someone
[03:14:02.560 --> 03:14:05.800]  approaches them with something that's not of their faith do they freak out and
[03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:11.680]  recoil and basically melt in a pool of their own ooze it just really makes you
[03:14:11.680 --> 03:14:17.000]  wonder all the political correctness we're going on and being enveloped by
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:20.600]  and crushed by by all these social justice warriors now I want to go to
[03:14:20.600 --> 03:14:24.600]  Waleed in Paris he wants to talk about or she wants to talk about the Paris
[03:14:24.600 --> 03:14:29.240]  attacks Waleed are you there I am how are you Rob I'm doing good tell us what's
[03:14:29.240 --> 03:14:34.320]  going on in Paris hey well I'm so happy to talk to you I mean I've never talked
[03:14:34.320 --> 03:14:38.440]  to you personally and I've seen that you're a great guy so but I'll just say
[03:14:38.440 --> 03:14:42.480]  that I called the other day when like it was just the next day after the
[03:14:42.480 --> 03:14:47.080]  Paris attacks and I talked to Alex he was running the show and we were just
[03:14:47.080 --> 03:14:50.400]  talking about gun control in Paris and all that stuff and Alex brought up
[03:14:50.400 --> 03:14:56.360]  Albert Pike and the planned war between Jews Christians and Muslim so first
[03:14:56.360 --> 03:15:00.920]  like I wanted to ask you Rob are you a believer in the God of Abraham am I
[03:15:00.920 --> 03:15:05.440]  and a believer the God of Abraham are you talking about the God the Christian
[03:15:05.440 --> 03:15:09.600]  God is that what you're referring to well the God of well just the guy I mean
[03:15:09.600 --> 03:15:15.240]  are you a believer in God yes definitely okay well so so I'm a listener like I'm
[03:15:15.240 --> 03:15:19.360]  I've been listening to you guys for more than seven years now so since I was a
[03:15:19.360 --> 03:15:24.640]  college student and and I'm a listener and a very frequent customer of in
[03:15:24.640 --> 03:15:31.360]  Ford's life like and I know how close you and Alex are like specifically you too so
[03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:36.480]  just please allow me to say something related to this topic of Albert Pikes and
[03:15:36.480 --> 03:15:41.760]  the war between religion is that this Rob I'm 100% certain like I've been
[03:15:41.760 --> 03:15:46.560]  following this and I'm 100% certain that Paul Joseph Watson is leading an anti
[03:15:46.560 --> 03:15:51.520]  Islam propaganda he lost the side versus out of their context and just Rob just
[03:15:51.520 --> 03:15:55.480]  please go and check the translation of the word Islam just check check it out
[03:15:55.480 --> 03:15:59.960]  it means peace and it means submission to God so I don't know what is making him
[03:15:59.960 --> 03:16:05.160]  and what is making Alex letting him do this I would love to hear an answer from
[03:16:05.160 --> 03:16:09.720]  you because I know that you could speak on behalf of Alex thank you well I can
[03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:14.640]  not speak on behalf of Alex Alex speaks on behalf of himself and I will say
[03:16:14.640 --> 03:16:19.480]  this about Islam somebody sent me a video and it was made in 2014 you guys
[03:16:19.480 --> 03:16:24.440]  might even be able to pull it up but it was in Norway and it's it's at a Muslim
[03:16:24.440 --> 03:16:27.680]  I don't know if it's a prayer meeting or get together whatever they're having it
[03:16:27.680 --> 03:16:31.560]  is a room full of people who claim to be Muslims and they're being led by a guy
[03:16:31.560 --> 03:16:35.360]  and he says you know how many of you are moderate because they're yourselves
[03:16:35.360 --> 03:16:39.480]  moderate Muslims and 90% of them raise their hands and then he talks about the
[03:16:39.480 --> 03:16:43.520]  the punishments that are listed in the Quran he talks about stoning cutting off
[03:16:43.520 --> 03:16:48.840]  limbs how many people believe in those and they raise their hands every one of
[03:16:48.840 --> 03:16:51.960]  them he goes to see you know people always complain that when we have these
[03:16:51.960 --> 03:16:56.240]  talks that we were bringing up extremist and radicals and he goes these
[03:16:56.240 --> 03:17:00.520]  people aren't extremist and radical and so that's what he's saying that their
[03:17:00.520 --> 03:17:05.120]  religion believes in I tweeted that out if yeah there's actually the the video
[03:17:05.120 --> 03:17:10.800]  right there what's the title of that video yeah the moderate Muslim and it is
[03:17:10.800 --> 03:17:17.840]  I guess took place in 2014 and I'm I'm I like to value people and look at people
[03:17:17.840 --> 03:17:23.000]  based on their actions and somewhat their words I know a lot of people say
[03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:26.960]  stuff either that they don't mean or you know in the heat of the moment but
[03:17:26.960 --> 03:17:33.560]  actions is really what I really you know judge people on so when people like the
[03:17:33.560 --> 03:17:38.840]  Islamic State are throwing people off roofs for their sexual orientation I
[03:17:38.840 --> 03:17:41.920]  think that's wrong and I don't think we should be doing that I don't think
[03:17:41.920 --> 03:17:45.560]  anybody should be doing that I think we should all be working together to make
[03:17:45.560 --> 03:17:52.280]  the species of man as good as it can be and really launching ourselves into
[03:17:52.280 --> 03:17:57.840]  areas like better technologies free energy even you know that's the areas
[03:17:57.840 --> 03:18:01.280]  that I think we should be working towards not about nitting each other over
[03:18:01.280 --> 03:18:06.360]  our religious beliefs and so but I don't speak for Alex I don't speak for
[03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:09.960]  Paul Joseph Watson but when I see videos like that the moderate Muslim and
[03:18:09.960 --> 03:18:13.240]  these people are saying you know they believe in stoning they believe in and
[03:18:13.240 --> 03:18:19.240]  death for adultery you know I don't agree with that at all and so that's I
[03:18:19.240 --> 03:18:23.160]  guess that's where I stand on that thanks for calling while lead in Paris
[03:18:23.160 --> 03:18:28.040]  next we have a dog leg in Idaho wants to talk about Fukushima do you have some
[03:18:28.040 --> 03:18:32.880]  new news about Fukushima dog leg well I kind of wanted to bring attention to a

[03:18:44.680 --> 03:18:52.360]  a man named Dana Dernford excuse me in Canada and Dana has recently been
[03:18:52.360 --> 03:19:03.080]  arrested for online threats to some scientists and what are the nature of
[03:19:03.080 --> 03:19:08.480]  the threats are they saying is Dana a guy or a girl Dana's a guy a guy
[03:19:08.480 --> 03:19:12.680]  he spent his whole life on the ocean and he went and mapped the entire BC coastline
[03:19:12.680 --> 03:19:18.960]  there recently and he says the entire ocean dead I've been seeing a lot of
[03:19:18.960 --> 03:19:23.320]  reports about that the melting starfish the dead sea life that's washing up on
[03:19:23.320 --> 03:19:26.760]  especially on the west coast people are going out to the beaches and they're
[03:19:26.760 --> 03:19:29.840]  saying they're not seeing the same wildlife that they used to see there was

[03:23:16.820 --> 03:23:20.960]  about staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how
[03:23:20.960 --> 03:23:25.120]  will I keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but
[03:23:25.120 --> 03:23:28.880]  the problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with

[03:23:32.960 --> 03:23:37.160]  smoke like in times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel

[03:24:15.080 --> 03:24:20.880]  in a while is Fukushima and the radioactive fallout and I guess this
[03:24:20.880 --> 03:24:25.760]  is seawater that you're using to cool down the the meltdown rods are it's just
[03:24:25.760 --> 03:24:29.440]  being poured back into the ocean it's leaking we've seen the plumes we've
[03:24:29.440 --> 03:24:33.200]  seen the animations of the plumes we had a caller dog leg from Idaho was talking
[03:24:33.200 --> 03:24:38.280]  about a man named Dana Dernford and I did a quick search here's an update from
[03:24:38.280 --> 03:24:44.720]  2015 of August 2000 200 kilometers Canadian the civic coastline dead zone
[03:24:44.720 --> 03:24:51.280]  devoid of 99% of all life almost all title zone species missing entirely and a
[03:24:51.280 --> 03:24:55.280]  dog leg I'm gonna let you finish up so hey this guy is being harassed by by
[03:24:55.280 --> 03:25:00.440]  other scientists are claiming he's threatening them well these so-called
[03:25:00.440 --> 03:25:04.280]  scientists they've been down playing this you know huge cover-up we all know
[03:25:04.280 --> 03:25:09.320]  this and they've you know kind of selectively taking some things he said
[03:25:09.320 --> 03:25:13.760]  online and use that to pretty much shut down his whole side and make him take
[03:25:13.760 --> 03:25:18.960]  down everything he's facing some pretty serious charges now well that's a
[03:25:18.960 --> 03:25:22.160]  problem with Canada Canada if you don't say the right things in Canada they will
[03:25:22.160 --> 03:25:25.440]  throw the book at you and they'll allow other people to attack you if they don't
[03:25:25.440 --> 03:25:30.160]  like what you say as we just had the guest earlier the lawyer for the man
[03:25:30.160 --> 03:25:34.960]  who's just disagree with some feminists on Facebook and now he's being slammed
[03:25:34.960 --> 03:25:39.920]  and looking at jail time and fines I mean it's ridiculous what's going on with
[03:25:39.920 --> 03:25:44.160]  not being able to present two sides of an opinion why can't people disagree with
[03:25:44.160 --> 03:25:48.520]  other people and we still you know get along and not have to do all this
[03:25:48.520 --> 03:25:54.040]  nonsense oh yes many many issues they're they're trying to shut down speech
[03:25:54.040 --> 03:25:57.800]  about worldwide you know yeah I totally agree do you have anything else you want
[03:25:57.800 --> 03:26:03.720]  to add I just you know the greatest lie Obama told was was Fukushima when he
[03:26:03.720 --> 03:26:08.280]  got on TV his family had already been flown to the southern hemisphere and he
[03:26:08.280 --> 03:26:12.280]  got on TV and told us it was all safe and he'd keep us informed and then
[03:26:12.280 --> 03:26:22.760]  himself and secretary to the energy secretary and the GE CEO what's his
[03:26:22.760 --> 03:26:27.040]  name they all flew down there right afterwards right after he gave that
[03:26:27.040 --> 03:26:30.040]  speech and you know stayed in the southern hemisphere till he got the all
[03:26:30.040 --> 03:26:34.680]  clear see you later everything's fine we'll be back yeah exactly it's just
[03:26:34.680 --> 03:26:39.040]  it's just crazy the thing with radiation is you don't know if it affects you
[03:26:39.040 --> 03:26:43.680]  unless you're wearing you know one of those little dosometers are you you're
[03:26:43.680 --> 03:26:48.040]  next to a you know some sort of counter that could measure the radiation that
[03:26:48.040 --> 03:26:50.440]  you're being affected with you're not going to know if that stuff's affecting
[03:26:50.440 --> 03:26:54.520]  you till five ten years down the road when all the sudden you're you know in
[03:26:54.520 --> 03:26:58.600] undated with cancer clusters we we found a report was Josh Owens and Liam
[03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:02.200]  McAdoo who went to St. Louis and met with people who were living in these
[03:27:02.200 --> 03:27:07.080]  areas where they've been storing nuclear waste next to a stream just open air and
[03:27:07.080 --> 03:27:10.440]  these kids were playing in the creek and everyone around them in their
[03:27:10.440 --> 03:27:14.680]  neighborhoods is winding up with cancer they're having autoimmune disorders so
[03:27:14.680 --> 03:27:19.960]  radiation is serious and if Fukushima you know is really dumping millions of
[03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:26.080]  gallons of toxic radiation water in to our our Pacific Ocean and it's the
[03:27:26.080 --> 03:27:29.320]  currents are carrying it this way they're carrying it to Canada they're
[03:27:29.320 --> 03:27:32.160]  carrying it to the coast of Alaska they're carrying it to our West Coast and
[03:27:32.160 --> 03:27:36.960]  if we're not straight with the people about how dangerous this really is
[03:27:36.960 --> 03:27:40.040]  we're doing everybody a disservice and that's why we sent a group of reporters
[03:27:40.040 --> 03:27:44.520]  out there when we were seeing high readings on some beaches in I believe it
[03:27:44.520 --> 03:27:48.800]  was a right around the San Francisco area appreciate the call dog leg Ken in
[03:27:48.800 --> 03:27:52.240]  Washington Info Wars Christmas you want to talk about the true meaning of
[03:27:52.240 --> 03:27:59.320]  Christmas there's a really good documentary I've seen on on YouTube or 10
[03:27:59.320 --> 03:28:04.920]  12 years ago this by a Christian ministry called Jeremiah films and the
[03:28:04.920 --> 03:28:11.960]  DVD they are the YouTube video me upload the DVD to YouTube it's called the
[03:28:11.960 --> 03:28:19.600]  unwrapping at Christmas okay and it's totally satanic Christmas is not
[03:28:19.600 --> 03:28:24.840]  it weren't Christmas it's pronounced Christ mass we see a big fat Catholic
[03:28:24.840 --> 03:28:28.840]  Santa Claus Santa Claus in the corner of the street or inside the mall saying
[03:28:28.840 --> 03:28:33.840]  ho ho ho Merry Christmas he's basically saying mocking Jesus he's saying ha ha
[03:28:33.840 --> 03:28:38.480]  ha happy is Christ death mass means the death of Christ does not mean the birth
[03:28:38.480 --> 03:28:45.440]  of Christ it's satanic it's always been satanic Catholic it's antichrist it
[03:28:45.440 --> 03:28:51.720]  as well also there's a creature called Swartz Pete also known as as Crumpus
[03:28:51.720 --> 03:28:57.080]  Crumpus is a little devil that follows this Catholic saint around mm-hmm it's
[03:28:57.080 --> 03:29:01.480]  satanic it's not I mean I understand that people want to share love and you
[03:29:01.480 --> 03:29:06.640]  know to care about their kids and all that but Bible clearly says all on earth
[03:29:06.640 --> 03:29:12.080]  will be deceived by Satan and I quit celebrating Christmas about 10 12 years
[03:29:12.080 --> 03:29:16.240]  ago because I'm not gonna mock Jesus Christ use Christ my king and Lord the
[03:29:16.240 --> 03:29:20.800]  Savior I'm not gonna celebrate these pagan state-tanic holidays it's it's
[03:29:20.800 --> 03:29:25.200]  antichrist it's a it's a what a state would they say that little jingle that
[03:29:25.200 --> 03:29:29.880]  they sing a he knows when you're good or bad you know it's like the NSA knows
[03:29:29.880 --> 03:29:33.000]  that you've been sleeping knows when you're awake
[03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:38.280]  the Catholic Pope or the saint or Santa Claus is replaced meant for Jesus Christ
[03:29:38.280 --> 03:29:43.320]  he is antichrist he is satanic and he's supposed to be this man on earth is
[03:29:43.320 --> 03:29:46.440]  supposed to know when you're good or bad hey Ken thanks for calling the
[03:29:46.440 --> 03:29:50.200]  unwrapping of Christmas we'll be back when we're on the March the Empire's on
[03:29:50.200 --> 03:29:56.400]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[03:29:58.440 --> 03:30:02.560]  while ISIS threatens to attack the US record number of legal immigrants are
[03:30:02.560 --> 03:30:05.640]  flooding into the country thanks to lax enforcement by federal authorities
[03:30:05.640 --> 03:30:10.000]  barely a week after the November 2015 ISIS attacks of Paris France the US
[03:30:10.000 --> 03:30:13.360]  Border Patrol revealed that nearly 3,000 unaccompanied children were caught
[03:30:13.360 --> 03:30:16.600]  crossing the border in the weeks leading up to the attacks but just think of how
[03:30:16.600 --> 03:30:19.440]  many more illegal immigrants were able to slip into the country without getting
[03:30:19.440 --> 03:30:22.840]  caught it's probably at least 10 times more speaking on the subject House
[03:30:22.840 --> 03:30:26.640]  Representative Duncan Hunter said quote the greatest existential threat to this
[03:30:26.640 --> 03:30:29.240]  nation right now is this administration's open border policy
[03:30:29.240 --> 03:30:33.360]  under speaking the truth ISIS is likely already exploiting President Obama's
[03:30:33.360 --> 03:30:37.160]  open border policy to smuggle their own militants into the country but here's
[03:30:37.160 --> 03:30:40.440]  something else you may not realize human traffickers are also taking advantage
[03:30:40.440 --> 03:30:44.240]  of Obama's open border stew enslave women around the world and import them as
[03:30:44.240 --> 03:30:48.280]  sex slaves into the US in other words Obama's lax enforcement immigration laws
[03:30:48.280 --> 03:30:52.680]  is fueling a war on women this is get annuals with info wars.com and be sure

[03:33:27.520 --> 03:33:33.200]  weekend and until next Monday and at the same time you can get informed by
[03:33:33.200 --> 03:33:38.800]  watching this video on the fact that most Black Friday sales are a scam
[03:33:38.800 --> 03:33:43.680]  companies simply raise prices the week before and then lower them the week of
[03:33:43.680 --> 03:33:48.400]  normal prices and some stores do give better deals on Black Friday but it's
[03:33:48.400 --> 03:33:52.320]  one of the worst days of the year to shop and this is just a classic example
[03:33:52.320 --> 03:33:57.280]  of how people get screwed over because of lack of knowledge because they're not
[03:33:57.280 --> 03:34:01.880]  informed but by going to infowarstore.com you fund the very tip of the spear in
[03:34:01.880 --> 03:34:05.040]  the fight for human liberty and defending all of our basic freedoms and
[03:34:05.040 --> 03:34:09.120]  exposing globalist criminal operations and we're having an effect on their

[03:34:13.400 --> 03:34:19.360]  same time we're exposing the fact that Black Friday itself is a big hoax
[03:34:19.360 --> 03:34:24.440]  Black Friday itself is just a great time to get in traffic jams and to watch
[03:34:24.440 --> 03:34:29.000]  people acting like mindless consumer zombies now some people when I talk
[03:34:29.000 --> 03:34:33.320]  about Black Friday say hey wait you're criticizing the consumer zombies rushing
[03:34:33.320 --> 03:34:38.640]  Walmart or Target for video games or whatever fighting over toilet paper but
[03:34:38.640 --> 03:34:43.320]  then you're talking about your own Black Friday well yeah that's what we do we
[03:34:43.320 --> 03:34:48.680]  hijack globalist operations try to educate people about them and then try to
[03:34:48.680 --> 03:34:53.040]  take the attention that their scams are creating and siphon it off to wake
[03:34:53.040 --> 03:34:57.480]  people up it's like culture jamming it's like when I cover Miley Cyrus or
[03:34:57.480 --> 03:35:00.960]  Kim Kardashian it's not because I'm trying to cover fluff it's because I'm
[03:35:00.960 --> 03:35:06.680]  hijacking it using their names to then expose the whole agenda so free

[03:38:06.360 --> 03:38:11.280]  the beer gut at bay especially as you get up in in my age I want to do a quick
[03:38:11.280 --> 03:38:15.400]  update of what's going on in Colorado apparently the government has they say
[03:38:15.400 --> 03:38:19.120]  he's shot multiple people including at least three police officers this is out
[03:38:19.120 --> 03:38:22.560]  of the independent and he's barricaded himself inside the Planned Parenthood
[03:38:22.560 --> 03:38:28.440]  Clinic the last check 15 minutes ago he was still inside there I'm sure there's
[03:38:28.440 --> 03:38:33.320]  gonna be a giant SWAT team build up and they're gonna launch in and hopefully
[03:38:33.320 --> 03:38:38.800]  no one else gets hurt in this and I just can't wait to see how this story
[03:38:38.800 --> 03:38:42.440]  unravels I mean this is obviously sickening for somebody to go on a
[03:38:42.440 --> 03:38:47.440]  shooting rampage especially when we really had Planned Parenthood up against
[03:38:47.440 --> 03:38:52.080]  the ropes exposing them non-violently through video through their own words
[03:38:52.080 --> 03:38:55.760]  destroying Planned Parenthood and what they stand for just showing them as
[03:38:55.760 --> 03:38:59.960]  baby part merchants that's what these people are now we have the Hillary
[03:38:59.960 --> 03:39:04.280]  Clinton free speech contest and I want to play this is a short video I'm gonna
[03:39:04.280 --> 03:39:09.440]  play it's actually 31 seconds long but it just goes that how short you can make
[03:39:09.440 --> 03:39:12.320]  a video to make a point and then I'm gonna show you some that are in the
[03:39:12.320 --> 03:39:15.760]  longer five-minute range because five minutes is the cutoff for that but let's
[03:39:15.760 --> 03:39:23.640]  go to this first one Hillary Clinton I think I am American info wars calm all
[03:39:23.640 --> 03:39:28.600]  right there's the countdown going down and it's gonna hit one and then it's gonna
[03:39:28.600 --> 03:39:44.040]  start I'm an American I'm running for president
[03:39:44.040 --> 03:39:48.520]  there it is that's how quick quickly you can make a point and it's not about
[03:39:48.520 --> 03:39:52.560]  either winning or losing the contest it's about making these videos and putting
[03:39:52.560 --> 03:39:57.120]  them out on YouTube and having other people click on them and start D
[03:39:57.120 --> 03:40:01.520]  programming because that's what we have to do let's go to Pete in Michigan he
[03:40:01.520 --> 03:40:05.760]  wants to tell us what he's thankful for Pete how you doing today good good I

[03:41:46.120 --> 03:41:50.560]  want to thank my governor Mike Pence he sent him an email and I thank him for
[03:41:50.560 --> 03:41:55.480]  securing our way of life our culture our freedom he put his life online to
[03:41:55.480 --> 03:41:59.920]  stand up for our state that's where the power lies in the people the school
[03:41:59.920 --> 03:42:03.240]  responsibility I asked him for fiscal responsibility and refugees will stop
[03:42:03.240 --> 03:42:07.080]  that controlled dialogue this the social media has been controlling dialogue
[03:42:07.080 --> 03:42:11.640]  people are scared to stand up they're controlling that they are censoring it
[03:42:11.640 --> 03:42:15.360]  and they make you feel guilty there's hypocrisy you know because we need to
[03:42:15.360 --> 03:42:18.720]  keep you we need to keep our family safe our country safe they didn't even talk
[03:42:18.720 --> 03:42:23.600]  about a bowl at these these refugees the prayer is working guys keep praying God
[03:42:23.600 --> 03:42:27.960]  bless you thank you I'm done well I guarantee you some of these refugees
[03:42:27.960 --> 03:42:32.800]  that are coming across are going to be carrying some sickness parasites who
[03:42:32.800 --> 03:42:37.560]  knows what they're going to be bringing across and our FBI chief has said we
[03:42:37.560 --> 03:42:43.000]  can't vet these people properly so it it's a it's a crazy situation that we're
[03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:45.960]  dealing with now and it's a situation that we help start why with all this
[03:42:45.960 --> 03:42:49.720]  regime change and going into different countries and bombing the heck out of
[03:42:49.720 --> 03:42:53.880]  them so we definitely are responsible for people wanting to leave their
[03:42:53.880 --> 03:42:57.360]  countries right now whether it's it's because of these wars or not they're
[03:42:57.360 --> 03:43:02.200]  definitely using the excuse of our bombing activities to jump ship and
[03:43:02.200 --> 03:43:06.280]  go into other places and ISIS is definitely taking advantage of that
[03:43:06.280 --> 03:43:10.000]  let's go to our I don't know if this will be our final caller but for a little
[03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:14.520]  bit this is Douglas in California at transition from sheeple to awake did you
[03:43:14.520 --> 03:43:19.080]  just recently go through that transition no it's it's been a four-year
[03:43:19.080 --> 03:43:25.720]  unbelievable awakening from CNN work your job do what you're told believe
[03:43:25.720 --> 03:43:31.960]  everything you're fed and get in line to who's Alex Jones what wait and then you
[03:43:31.960 --> 03:43:39.160]  have that that deep sense of oh no the sphere that that you can't control in
[03:43:39.160 --> 03:43:43.400]  other words you're going I've been lied to you I've been what what this can't be
[03:43:43.400 --> 03:43:48.760]  real I'm telling everyone out there I didn't even know I ended up on this list
[03:43:48.760 --> 03:43:53.440]  that the government has called the office of foreign asset control by mistake
[03:43:53.440 --> 03:43:59.440]  because my name was Douglas I have been fighting in court for four years to have
[03:43:59.440 --> 03:44:04.680]  my assets unlocked to actually work to be able to work legally in the United
[03:44:04.680 --> 03:44:08.720]  States because my middle name was Douglas and I'm I'm on the Internet so I
[03:44:08.720 --> 03:44:12.440]  know who's ever listening who they can always do a search for people that are
[03:44:12.440 --> 03:44:17.600]  on this olfactory list you'll see my name there and just recently just recently
[03:44:17.600 --> 03:44:21.400]  the Supreme Court took up my court case only because I got on my hands and knees
[03:44:21.400 --> 03:44:26.160]  and started looking for God seeking God with all my heart with all my soul and
[03:44:26.160 --> 03:44:29.920]  that's what some it's going to take to get through these evil times when you'll
[03:44:29.920 --> 03:44:32.880]  fight it we don't fight against flesh and blood we fight against principalities
[03:44:32.880 --> 03:44:37.120]  and powers these people they may not even know what they're doing but it's
[03:44:37.120 --> 03:44:42.560]  putting God first in our life over other things that's how you know I'd like to
[03:44:42.560 --> 03:44:46.160]  kind of you know wake people up you've got to be awake because there's so many
[03:44:46.160 --> 03:44:49.720]  schemes going out on out there our government I don't know what it's all
[03:44:49.720 --> 03:44:55.080]  about but I know one thing that there is a living God Jesus is Christ you know
[03:44:55.080 --> 03:45:00.360]  and even in the Surah I read the Quran and it says in the Quran okay it says
[03:45:00.360 --> 03:45:05.080]  oh Muhammad this is through Surah 33 oh Muhammad the book of truth has been
[03:45:05.080 --> 03:45:09.600]  sent down to you confirming what was before he has revealed to you the Torah
[03:45:09.600 --> 03:45:16.240]  and the gospel they had the book of truth and like men do they change things
[03:45:16.240 --> 03:45:22.080]  okay and that's what's happened we need to get back to the Bible yeah they
[03:45:22.080 --> 03:45:27.120]  changed things to suit themselves at that particular time in history thank
[03:45:27.120 --> 03:45:30.080]  you for that call Douglas and send me some information on your case you can
[03:45:30.080 --> 03:45:35.240]  anybody can email me your tips out there Rob D ro bd at info wars calm put

[03:45:40.320 --> 03:45:44.720]  and I can't always reply to you out there but I do look at your links I look at
[03:45:44.720 --> 03:45:51.400]  everything and I want to go to one more of these contests this is a Hillary
[03:45:51.400 --> 03:45:56.120]  Clinton supporter destroys info wars calm this one's about it's right it's
[03:45:56.120 --> 03:46:00.640]  four minutes 59 seconds so right under that five minute mark and this guy does
[03:46:00.640 --> 03:46:05.600]  some great stuff we played his videos in the past it's no more news which is no
[03:46:05.600 --> 03:46:10.040]  KNOW no more and that's what we all need to do and it's kind of what our
[03:46:10.040 --> 03:46:13.880]  caller just alluded to back there we have to to know more and you know you
[03:46:13.880 --> 03:46:18.880]  suddenly are awakened to what the system is when you have a confrontation with the
[03:46:18.880 --> 03:46:22.440]  system and you you realize that it's not what it's all meant to be it's not all
[03:46:22.440 --> 03:46:25.840]  mom and apple pie these people are predators coming after us so let's go
[03:46:25.840 --> 03:46:30.880]  to that video now the right-wing nutjob conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from
[03:46:30.880 --> 03:46:35.520]  info wars calm is such a racist sexist homophobic bigoted Republican you've
[03:46:35.520 --> 03:46:39.320]  probably seen his lunatic conspiracy theories exposed by various reputable
[03:46:39.320 --> 03:46:43.800]  media outlets such as salon raw story media matters or MSNBC but his latest
[03:46:43.800 --> 03:46:47.760]  stunt has taken things way too far he just announced a contest to get his cult
[03:46:47.760 --> 03:46:51.720]  minion followers to create hateful intolerant YouTube videos making fun of
[03:46:51.720 --> 03:46:55.440]  the next president of the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton just because the
[03:46:55.440 --> 03:46:58.520]  Hillary campaign threatened the laugh factory from making jokes about Ms.
[03:46:58.520 --> 03:47:01.560]  Clinton doesn't give him the right to criticize her what makes him think he
[03:47:01.560 --> 03:47:05.160]  can invade her safe space with his disgusting hate speech anyway Alex
[03:47:05.160 --> 03:47:08.240]  Jones and info wars are totally irrelevant they're just a vocal minority
[03:47:08.240 --> 03:47:11.880]  if you google top political websites and click on the first link they're only
[03:47:11.880 --> 03:47:15.360]  the seventh biggest website on the list with 13 million unique visitors to their
[03:47:15.360 --> 03:47:19.040]  website per month but look at who is above them huff poe number one in salon
[03:47:19.040 --> 03:47:22.520]  number six hashtag winning what can info wars and their fringe followers
[03:47:22.520 --> 03:47:25.760]  possibly say about Hillary anyway that she's too good of a role model too
[03:47:25.760 --> 03:47:29.560]  beautiful that her hair is too fabulous or that she's too inspirational she's
[03:47:29.560 --> 03:47:33.560]  never done anything wrong so I have a message for you mr. Alex Jones men of
[03:47:33.560 --> 03:47:36.840]  the venomous hate you spew towards Hillary will phase her at all she will
[03:47:36.840 --> 03:47:41.680]  just laugh it off with her contagious majestic laugh doesn't she sound like
[03:47:41.680 --> 03:47:45.840]  an angel I can't wait to see the hate and lies that these info warriors come up
[03:47:45.840 --> 03:47:49.320]  with they will probably try to say that she can't even keep her ma'am satisfied
[03:47:49.320 --> 03:47:52.760]  because her husband Bill Clinton cheated on her all the time with tons of women
[03:47:52.760 --> 03:47:56.280]  she's stood by her man and viciously attacked and ridiculed all the women who
[03:47:56.280 --> 03:47:59.480]  came forward about Bill's aggressive sexual abuse did you call her a
[03:47:59.480 --> 03:48:03.880]  narcissistic loony to me I am not gonna comment on what I did or did not say
[03:48:03.880 --> 03:48:07.800]  isn't she just a strong independent woman just look at her recent tweet about
[03:48:07.800 --> 03:48:11.320]  the sexual abuse of women she totally cares about the rape victims like when
[03:48:11.320 --> 03:48:14.840]  she defended a child rape as she knew was guilty in 1975 and laughed about it
[03:48:14.840 --> 03:48:18.920]  Mrs. Clinton seems to admit she knew the defendant was guilty the whole Monica
[03:48:18.920 --> 03:48:22.080]  Lewinsky scandal was just a right-wing conspiracy theory Hillary Clinton
[03:48:22.080 --> 03:48:26.600]  totally debunked it this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring
[03:48:26.600 --> 03:48:30.120]  against my husband God I hate the stupid mouth-breathing knuckle-dragging
[03:48:30.120 --> 03:48:33.600]  Republicans they're always trying to say Hillary and Bill Clinton's foundation
[03:48:33.600 --> 03:48:36.680]  took millions of dollars for private jets and that the foundation is full of
[03:48:36.680 --> 03:48:39.640]  Monsanto and giant corporate connections Fox News says the Clinton
[03:48:39.640 --> 03:48:43.000]  Foundation only gave a small percentage of money to charity but we all know Fox
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:46.080]  News is nothing more than right-wing propaganda sponsored by the cock
[03:48:46.080 --> 03:48:49.120]  brothers critics claim that the speeches Hillary gave to the big banks for
[03:48:49.120 --> 03:48:52.120]  millions of dollars were an advanced auction of stolen goods but Hillary is
[03:48:52.120 --> 03:48:55.440]  so wise and experienced she deserves that much money for her speech all right
[03:48:55.440 --> 03:49:01.360]  that's awesome there that's from no more news you can watch the rest of that I'm
[03:49:01.360 --> 03:49:05.480]  gonna get the writers to post that one up along with a couple others we have
[03:49:05.480 --> 03:49:11.000]  another one of a young lady Jenna Marbles who actually embodies Hillary
[03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:14.840]  Clinton and and I'll play that one in a second here I think we got a little bit
[03:49:14.840 --> 03:49:20.160]  a little bit of time left what time we go out to break yeah I might not have
[03:49:20.160 --> 03:49:24.000]  time for this one but I'll get them to post all three of these Jenna I just
[03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:27.560]  want to let you know put info wars.com in the title in order to be eligible to

[03:49:57.760 --> 03:50:01.640]  it's it's so funny you know he's acting like a Hillary supporter but basically
[03:50:01.640 --> 03:50:06.040]  showing everything that we've said and proven in the past about Hillary Clinton
[03:50:06.040 --> 03:50:09.200]  and how much of a demon she really is and how we need to get rid of this

[03:50:15.680 --> 03:50:19.280]  in through the White House if you look at Bush and the Bush is in the Clintons
[03:50:19.280 --> 03:50:23.240]  and how Obama's kind of a hybrid of both of them and you know we're looking at
[03:50:23.240 --> 03:50:27.040]  maybe a Jeb Bush or a Clinton Hillary Clinton for president although I think
[03:50:27.040 --> 03:50:31.560]  Jeb is really just circling the toilet bowl at this point so we're gonna be

[03:54:32.800 --> 03:54:36.880]  that I'd never really thought about it that way with racist connotations I can
[03:54:36.880 --> 03:54:43.600]  see how it could be definitely offensive to people I don't know where my
[03:54:43.600 --> 03:54:49.960]  opinion stands on it as far as that goes sorry I'm just gonna I'm not familiar
[03:54:49.960 --> 03:54:56.040]  with the historical connotations of Black Friday so I'm not sure of that
[03:54:56.040 --> 03:54:59.600]  question even applies or not like it could it could not but I just don't
[03:54:59.600 --> 03:55:02.120]  know I don't even know what the beginning of black what is like the
[03:55:02.120 --> 03:55:05.320]  beginnings of Black Friday where does like the origin of it well no one
[03:55:05.320 --> 03:55:09.600]  really knows but there are a lot of things people are alleging and it's kind
[03:55:09.600 --> 03:55:14.360]  of like a Black Lives Matter concern with this that it had something to do
[03:55:14.360 --> 03:55:17.640]  with slavery and that they would sell their slaves at a discount in order to
[03:55:17.640 --> 03:55:22.840]  you know get the plantations filled with workers for the harsh winter I think I
[03:55:22.840 --> 03:55:29.880]  did hear that before but I mean now they do it for discount items every year
[03:55:29.880 --> 03:55:34.560]  this people kind of they get a little bit offended by it and so really I didn't
[03:55:34.560 --> 03:55:38.760]  even know that there okay the problem is who is being offended like is it like
[03:55:38.760 --> 03:55:42.240]  the non-black community or is it the black community because if black community
[03:55:42.240 --> 03:55:45.880]  is offended then I would be more for changing it than if like someone who
[03:55:45.880 --> 03:55:48.760]  wasn't black was offended you know because they're the only ones who get
[03:55:48.760 --> 03:55:52.280]  to decide whether or not something has offensive connotations to them because
[03:55:52.280 --> 03:55:55.600]  there the community has lived through the historical implications do you think
[03:55:55.600 --> 03:56:05.680]  we should rename Black Friday no no why is that have you checked your
[03:56:05.680 --> 03:56:11.280]  privilege well actually I'm gonna reverse that statement I actually thought
[03:56:11.280 --> 03:56:14.640]  it through I could see where racism would come up there should definitely be a
[03:56:14.640 --> 03:56:20.080]  new name for it I'm not sure but any ideas well something that would be more
[03:56:20.080 --> 03:56:25.760]  color neutral or I mean I wouldn't go color then since that's still like race
[03:56:25.760 --> 03:56:29.720]  implied I guess no if people agree with that opinion then yeah of course it's
[03:56:29.720 --> 03:56:35.360]  it's not right but what would they change it to do any ideas African American
[03:56:35.360 --> 03:56:40.160]  Friday okay that's a good potential you gotta have something that has a ring to
[03:56:40.160 --> 03:56:44.360]  it yeah that's the thing you can't think of anything that has a ring to it at
[03:56:44.360 --> 03:56:52.000]  least then use an word the annual Walmart brawl how about that
[03:57:14.360 --> 03:57:22.840]  massive fords of zombies pouring into a Walmart and a man crying he didn't get
[03:57:22.840 --> 03:57:26.320]  his didn't get his black Friday gift everybody go it sounds like an awful
[03:57:26.320 --> 03:57:30.480]  way to spend a day getting beat up maybe they call it Black Friday because you
[03:57:30.480 --> 03:57:35.280]  have to be like a black belt in karate to you know that could be it discount day
[03:57:35.280 --> 03:57:40.880]  don't kill each other day please that's not for me to decide that's for the
[03:57:40.880 --> 03:57:43.600]  community decide what is and isn't offensive to them and what's an
[03:57:43.600 --> 03:57:51.080]  astute replacement racist or not racist not racist I think people would have to
[03:57:51.080 --> 03:57:54.560]  speak up and if people were to say something if it was something that was
[03:57:54.560 --> 03:57:57.520]  heard by the population I think people would sympathize with it if it was
[03:57:57.520 --> 03:58:03.040]  something that they felt was racist so even if it's not necessarily true though
[03:58:03.040 --> 03:58:07.240]  I see a lot on college campuses right now a lot of things are happening because
[03:58:07.240 --> 03:58:10.800]  of the way people feel because they're offended because it's all right you can
