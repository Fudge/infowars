[00:00.000 --> 00:13.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:13.680 --> 00:29.840]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:29.840 --> 00:35.800]  Well, this is it, the big distraction, the big diversion, the big sucker punch, the American
[00:35.800 --> 00:44.360]  people's stomach, the nice karate chop to the throat. It is the staged election of 2008.
[00:44.360 --> 00:55.400]  It is, of course, ladies and gentlemen, November 4th, 2008. He joins us once a month for his
[00:55.400 --> 01:05.040]  scheduled interview, and very timely, Mike Rivera, a Obama supporter, at least in a lukewarm
[01:05.040 --> 01:12.600]  fashion, joins us coming up for his once a month scheduled appearance today in one hour.
[01:12.600 --> 01:20.320]  Then Max Kaiser, monetary specialist, syndicated columnist, international television news presenter.
[01:20.320 --> 01:27.200]  Max Kaiser will be joining us from Europe, from London. And then for about 10 minutes
[01:27.200 --> 01:31.240]  during the end of the show, I'm going to have Senator Dean Barkley pop in with how that
[01:31.240 --> 01:39.280]  closely contested Senate race is going on up there with Mr. Coleman, Mr. Comedian Franken,
[01:39.280 --> 01:46.640]  and Mr. Barkley. So that is coming up as well. And I do want to take a lot of your phone
[01:46.640 --> 01:53.720]  calls today. Did a decent job of that yesterday. On any issue you wish to discuss, but I mean,
[01:53.720 --> 02:03.920]  obviously, the election itself is important. 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231 will get you
[02:03.920 --> 02:10.200]  up and on the air. Now, I have a little rant, and from that rant,
[02:10.200 --> 02:16.560]  Paul Watson is going to do a story today about what the selection really means and who Barack
[02:16.560 --> 02:22.720]  Obama really is, and the whole left-right paradigm. So I can set the record straight
[02:22.720 --> 02:31.480]  about this radio show and myself and where I stand. So that is coming up. A million thoughts
[02:31.480 --> 02:35.800]  have gone through my mind the last few days about this wanting to basically break this
[02:35.800 --> 02:41.920]  down on air, but I really haven't done it in its entirety. So I want to briefly, coming
[02:41.920 --> 02:53.300]  up in the next segment, then we'll get into all of the false spectrum hologram news dealing
[02:53.300 --> 02:58.480]  with the false reality that people live in and kind of sub-warrant beneath reality, beneath
[02:58.480 --> 03:06.280]  the true reality. Networks may call election before some polls close, that's Reuters. Rove,
[03:06.280 --> 03:09.920]  electoral prediction favors Obama when all these top Republicans are saying Obama is
[03:09.920 --> 03:16.480]  going to win. Election guide, keep an early eye on Georgia, Virginia, and Indiana. Election
[03:16.480 --> 03:20.760]  watchers won't have to wait for polls to close in West Virginia and the West to know how
[03:20.760 --> 03:25.560]  things are going. The first clues will come early when voting ends in Georgia, Indiana,
[03:25.560 --> 03:29.760]  Virginia, and the West. Democrat Barack Obama wins any of these three. He could be on his
[03:29.760 --> 03:38.760]  way to a big victory, maybe even a landslide. All over the news, Barack Obama is being described
[03:38.760 --> 03:45.560]  as a messianic leader, a top bishop at an Obama rally, described him as the great prophet,
[03:45.560 --> 03:50.760]  the great law giver, Moses, and the great change that's coming. Oh, I feel so sorry
[03:50.760 --> 03:56.120]  for you. Oh, there's change. There's change. Don't you worry. The eugenics and all of
[03:56.120 --> 04:01.960]  it will only intensify. We got a McCain memo out saying, you know, don't go off the exit
[04:01.960 --> 04:06.040]  polls. They're not accurate in the last 10 years. That's right. They were always accurate
[04:06.040 --> 04:12.000]  before, but now because of election fraud, you could have somebody winning by 15 points
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.480]  in the exit polls. But if they're an anti-establishment candidate, they'll lose by 10, 20, 30 sometimes.
[04:18.480 --> 04:22.440]  Doesn't matter. You know, suddenly polls don't matter anymore. Suddenly exit polls don't
[04:22.440 --> 04:28.560]  matter because the CIA runs our elections, ladies and gentlemen. People don't want to
[04:28.560 --> 04:33.160]  hear that. They want to be part of the big horse race and the spectacle and be sucked
[04:33.160 --> 04:36.160]  in by it. And if we don't wake up to just how bad things are, we're never getting it
[04:36.160 --> 04:42.880]  back. We're never coming back. And I'm getting criticized for posting video of Obama calling
[04:42.880 --> 04:49.840]  for a youth brigade in the U.S. to spy on Americans. Oh, God help us. We'll cover it
[04:49.840 --> 04:55.080]  all in a bunch of other key news on the economy. When we get back, I'm Alex Jones, prisonplanet.com

[05:59.960 --> 06:05.600]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Grand Tierra
[06:05.600 --> 06:09.140]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[06:09.140 --> 06:14.440]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[06:14.440 --> 06:23.400]  to tell their story. Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement that the air
[06:23.400 --> 06:28.680]  was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls
[06:28.680 --> 06:32.000]  throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.040]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off
[06:36.040 --> 06:41.040]  and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[08:02.120 --> 08:08.680]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:08.680 --> 08:24.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. All right. Paul Watson is doing an article via the
[08:24.920 --> 08:31.320]  basic analysis that I'm about to go over. He's welcome to add any points he wants to. And
[08:31.320 --> 08:36.720]  I'm not making, you know, this quote, stage election about myself. I don't normally have
[08:36.720 --> 08:45.520]  articles written dealing with myself, but this is a microcosm of the majority of the
[08:45.520 --> 08:50.480]  American people who in major polls say they don't like either party. They don't trust
[08:50.480 --> 08:55.260]  the system. They believe both parties are basically identical and work for powerful
[08:55.260 --> 09:03.760]  special interest. The Congress has a 9% approval rating. That's eight points lower than it
[09:03.760 --> 09:12.680]  had ever been in history previously. And it just continues to drop. And so I want it
[09:12.680 --> 09:18.720]  clearly on record. I don't want to be associated with the weak-minded, pathetic, sad people
[09:18.720 --> 09:25.120]  who I really feel sorry for, who are sucked in by John McCain and Sarah Palin and Barack
[09:25.120 --> 09:34.680]  Obama and Joe Biden. Do not associate me with your false paradigm, with your hologram you're
[09:34.680 --> 09:40.960]  living in, with the matrix you're living in. Get that straight. I'm not sucked into mindless
[09:40.960 --> 09:44.640]  football games that don't matter at the end of the day to my family and my future and
[09:44.640 --> 09:54.680]  the species. And I'm not sucked into these staged elections. Now, have we had legitimate
[09:54.680 --> 09:58.480]  two-party system previously? You could say to a certain extent before Kennedy was killed
[09:58.480 --> 10:04.680]  in 63, yes. Were there spectral interests? Were there robber barons? Did they try to
[10:04.680 --> 10:11.560]  buy off both parties? Yes. Did we have other legitimate third parties that became one of
[10:11.560 --> 10:19.680]  the big two parties and replaced other parties in our history? Yes. But since the 1960s and
[10:19.680 --> 10:24.920]  the assassination of Kennedy, we had the shadow government, which was officially set up in
[10:24.920 --> 10:33.520]  47, but that took over full operation of the United States. In 1963, they set up voter
[10:33.520 --> 10:38.280]  news services to steal the votes and put out fake election results at the state and federal
[10:38.280 --> 10:43.720]  level. And that's been done ever since. And I have done hundreds of radio shows, had hundreds
[10:43.720 --> 10:52.160]  of eyewitnesses and guest and congressional record on that. And remember, back when, you
[10:52.160 --> 10:55.760]  know, back 10 years ago, they had polls where only about eight, nine percent of the American
[10:55.760 --> 10:59.680]  people, you can pull these up, believe that there was systemic election fraud, not voter
[10:59.680 --> 11:05.680]  fraud. That's always there. That's badly coordinated and low level and can influence things on
[11:05.680 --> 11:10.720]  a national scale, certainly regionally. You've got local fat cats stealing elections at the
[11:10.720 --> 11:16.600]  election level fraud, not the retail voter fraud. And that's small compared to a unified
[11:16.600 --> 11:25.320]  concerted system of fraud at the top. Now, I remember 10 years ago, getting up on air
[11:25.320 --> 11:28.840]  and telling you that most elections were staged and stolen, catching the county clerk stealing
[11:28.840 --> 11:33.680]  the election. The state board admitted she falsified safety seals, broke safety seals,
[11:33.680 --> 11:38.440]  falsified signatures, double counted ballot boxes, stuffed ballot boxes. And they said
[11:38.440 --> 11:47.160]  it was an accident. We had eyewitnesses that saw her doing it, multiple eyewitnesses that
[11:47.160 --> 11:53.720]  worked for the county. Some people lost their jobs overcoming to me with this. I didn't
[11:53.720 --> 11:58.080]  just go on air and accused Denadette DuBois of stealing the election. You think I want
[11:58.080 --> 12:05.400]  to get sued? You think I like to lie? You think I like to stick my neck out there? No,
[12:05.400 --> 12:09.600]  I went public. I went to the commissioner's court in the state and I challenged that election
[12:09.600 --> 12:17.640]  and it came out. She stole that sucker stealing all sorts of races in there for Karen Sunlightner
[12:17.640 --> 12:24.760]  and others for county commissioners. So don't tell me there isn't fraud. I've caught people
[12:24.760 --> 12:32.760]  being paid out cash money in the legislature. And that's been front page of the paper and
[12:32.760 --> 12:40.200]  people have gotten in trouble with the ethics commission over it. Every time I go down to
[12:40.200 --> 12:43.720]  the Capitol, I catch them doing something. They're a pack of crooks. They get up on
[12:43.720 --> 12:49.520]  TV and violate state laws that are felonies and vote for each other and triple and quadruple.
[12:49.520 --> 12:54.160]  In some cases on camera, eight different votes. In front of news cameras, we'll sit there
[12:54.160 --> 12:59.720]  jumping all over, voting over and over again, punching buttons of different congressmen,
[12:59.720 --> 13:05.840]  legislators in the state of Texas. That could go on. You know what I'm already digressing?
[13:05.840 --> 13:13.040]  The corruption is out of control. We have a group of criminals that run the government.
[13:13.040 --> 13:18.280]  They tax you. They regulate you to take the money and invest it in their own offshore
[13:18.280 --> 13:22.920]  bank accounts, in their own investments. Your pension money, all of it, they've taken it
[13:22.920 --> 13:30.120]  and they've invested it in their own private operations. It's openly corrupt. The CIA in
[13:30.120 --> 13:36.440]  47 set up the Chicago 1313 system to take 60 plus percent of the tax money and invest
[13:36.440 --> 13:42.360]  it in offshore corporations for themselves. It's been totally corrupt since 47. That's
[13:42.360 --> 13:47.080]  when they completely took over and they've been dissolving the state power and local
[13:47.080 --> 13:51.440]  power ever since knowing that could be a backdoor to defeat them. Now they're bringing
[13:51.440 --> 14:01.360]  us under Northcom control. So let me explain something about this election. The people
[14:01.360 --> 14:04.520]  that put sodium fluoride in your water, the people that put mercury in your vaccines,
[14:04.520 --> 14:07.480]  the people that get up on TV and lie to you and tell you it's the law, you've got to take
[14:07.480 --> 14:12.720]  vaccines when there is no law. The people dissolving our borders, the same people that
[14:12.720 --> 14:16.760]  stage the terror attacks, the same people that are putting in the Pentagon surveillance
[14:16.760 --> 14:24.520]  grid over the American people. They run things, not George Bush, not Barack Obama, not John
[14:24.520 --> 14:30.640]  McCain. Instead, every time I criticize McCain on the website, we're being equal here, showing
[14:30.640 --> 14:38.080]  them. People post, you evil liberal communist, you Barack Obama supporter. Every time we
[14:38.080 --> 14:44.520]  post a story of the puppet, we always point that out, Barack Obama for carbon taxes, regulating
[14:44.520 --> 14:51.800]  your life, shutting down farms and ranches, youth brigades, spy forces domestically, hellish
[14:51.800 --> 14:56.480]  stuff historically, bad as it gets. Both of them proposing it. There's comment after
[14:56.480 --> 15:02.800]  comment going, this is a John McCain site. No, we've been the last few weeks going after
[15:02.800 --> 15:08.880]  Obama more because he's the apparent heir. He's the new emperor, the new titular head,
[15:08.880 --> 15:16.760]  the new front man, the new Caesar. He's got all the money and all the media behind him.
[15:16.760 --> 15:26.080]  So of course, so I had to deal with eight years of Bill Clinton being called a right-wing
[15:26.080 --> 15:37.800]  Nazi fascist. And now with George Bush gets in office, I've enjoyed seven and three quarters
[15:37.800 --> 15:44.560]  years being called a hardcore al-Qaeda. Yes, I've been called al-Qaeda. I've had national
[15:44.560 --> 15:48.680]  publications say that I was probably secretly trained in Afghanistan and crap like that.
[15:48.680 --> 15:52.680]  I've never even been there, never been to Central Asia. The point is now I've been called
[15:52.680 --> 16:02.640]  an al-Qaeda commie. When the two, of course, are an oxymoron, but the point is now we get
[16:02.640 --> 16:08.200]  to be called fascist again. When Barack Obama is for the banker takeover bills, the empowerment,
[16:08.200 --> 16:14.100]  the looting for trillions of dollars, he's gotten four times the Goldman Sachs money
[16:14.100 --> 16:20.120]  of John McCain, three times the Wall Street money. And I hear people that are Barack Obama
[16:20.120 --> 16:28.600]  supporters on TV, on radio saying, oh, all the big money's for McCain lying. Now it
[16:28.600 --> 16:33.480]  isn't that I'm saying either or matters. The point I'm making is that they lie within
[16:33.480 --> 16:41.920]  those control paradigms to prop up their candidate. People fix their own mental view. They ignore
[16:41.920 --> 16:46.320]  the facts just because they can associate their personal power, their identity, like
[16:46.320 --> 16:50.560]  they do with a certain brand of pickup truck or a certain brand of soft drink or beer,
[16:50.560 --> 16:59.960]  Lone Star, it's a Texas thing. They have all these little brand things. They sell you on
[16:59.960 --> 17:05.160]  it. And you watch with Barack Obama. There will be no repeal of Patriot Act one or two.
[17:05.160 --> 17:09.200]  There will be no repeal of the John Warner Defense Authorization Act. There will be no
[17:09.200 --> 17:16.320]  repeal of the overthrow of possecom and taught us to put military on the streets. There
[17:16.320 --> 17:20.880]  will be no end to war and spying on the American people and the spy satellites being used against
[17:20.880 --> 17:30.520]  the American people by local police now under federal control. There will be no reform in
[17:30.520 --> 17:35.680]  the direction the American people want, less government, less regulation, less control.
[17:35.680 --> 17:40.440]  It will be more of what the central banks, the social engineers and architects want,
[17:40.440 --> 17:44.320]  taking our money and giving it to offshore corporations. And what little is left here
[17:44.320 --> 17:48.000]  is used to regulate and control our lives where we can only get government jobs or jobs
[17:48.000 --> 17:57.240]  funded by government contracts. You know, every show I go on and every TV show I watch,
[17:57.240 --> 18:00.320]  it's the same thing. The American people want something done. They want to see something
[18:00.320 --> 18:04.480]  done by Congress. They want to, you know, they want to see more bailouts. They want
[18:04.480 --> 18:08.920]  to see more funding for government. No, they don't. In every poll, even the quote, main
[18:08.920 --> 18:15.280]  line liberals hate the banker bailout, hate the open borders, hate the war. Conservatives
[18:15.280 --> 18:23.200]  and liberals are together on almost every issue. It's Republican and Democratic parties
[18:23.200 --> 18:27.600]  that ignore the will of the people and it just so happens the will of the people that
[18:27.600 --> 18:35.040]  happens to be with the Constitution and the right states. It's common sense. But they hammer
[18:35.040 --> 18:39.480]  that in over and over and over and over again on TV. We've got to have everybody come to
[18:39.480 --> 18:44.000]  the center. The center means the globalist agenda. We've got to, we've got to have both
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.440]  parties work together. The Republicans are going to be out of the executive, the House
[18:48.440 --> 18:57.800]  and the Senate. And the Supreme Court justices generally vote with the quote, control left.
[18:57.800 --> 19:02.800]  So you are going to see carbon taxes. You are, and that's going to affect your paycheck,
[19:02.800 --> 19:12.480]  your job, your factory. Everything that uses electricity or natural gas or coal or gasoline
[19:12.480 --> 19:19.080]  oil, they openly state in all the UN documents, the club of Rome documents, the CFR that they
[19:19.080 --> 19:22.720]  want to get rid of the American middle class that were spoiled, that were bad, that will
[19:22.720 --> 19:27.800]  be more easily controlled once we're destitute. It is stated. I've heard them for 20 years
[19:27.800 --> 19:32.000]  on NPR talk about how soon we'll lower the standard of living with the carbon tax to
[19:32.000 --> 19:38.080]  control our lifestyles. It isn't about the carbon dioxide that plants breathe. It is
[19:38.080 --> 19:43.560]  about enslaving you. And he's going to do that and gun control and open borders and
[19:43.560 --> 19:48.560]  taxes and regulation and everything else. And you're going to see the whole agenda
[19:48.560 --> 19:53.080]  that George Bush was the front man for expand. Just like everything Bill Clinton was for,
[19:53.080 --> 20:01.120]  George Bush expanded. Stop being suckers. Stop being idiots. We'll be right back.
[20:01.120 --> 20:04.960]  Everyone knows that omega three should be an essential part of our daily diet with so many
[20:04.960 --> 20:09.240]  different methods of consumption. How do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your
[20:09.240 --> 20:13.680]  daily intake? The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American nutrition have the

[21:00.360 --> 21:06.080]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[21:06.080 --> 21:11.820]  against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin
[21:11.820 --> 21:15.840]  Laden. This is his M.O. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to the
[21:15.840 --> 21:20.600]  home of bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[21:20.600 --> 21:25.560]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that
[21:25.560 --> 21:31.840]  there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that
[21:31.840 --> 21:37.120]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers
[21:37.120 --> 21:41.840]  ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings
[21:41.840 --> 21:48.400]  in war games, the shadow government and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com

[22:18.400 --> 22:25.200]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11,110 was signed
[22:25.200 --> 22:29.400]  with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United
[22:29.400 --> 22:33.360]  States government in interest. With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out
[22:33.360 --> 22:37.800]  of business. The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency. However,
[22:37.800 --> 22:43.520]  the Executive Order still stands unrepealed. Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document. Call

[24:09.800 --> 24:13.760]  paradigm works, and I know most of you know this, but you better educate your neighbors.
[24:13.760 --> 24:18.760]  They're getting more informed, but not enough. They get sucked in by the pageantry, the horse
[24:18.760 --> 24:28.480]  race, ball game atmosphere of these elections, and all the endless, mindless, petty minutia
[24:28.480 --> 24:34.080]  that they get everybody to focus in on. That sucks in friends and family and neighbors
[24:34.080 --> 24:47.400]  and people I respect. It's so sad for me to see this happen. Now, I really feel sorry
[24:47.400 --> 24:52.360]  for black folks because they are talking about him being Moses. This being the greatest change
[24:52.360 --> 24:57.880]  ever. Oh, they're going to be empowered and freed. It's going to be wonderful. No. A lot
[24:57.880 --> 25:03.240]  of black folks have entered the middle class, but it's going to hurt minorities who per capita
[25:03.240 --> 25:08.560]  of the lowest incomes, even worse, under all these carbon taxes, under all these regulations.
[25:08.560 --> 25:14.760]  Kennedy cut the income tax by 50% and tax revenues doubled in his first two years in
[25:14.760 --> 25:19.080]  office into his third year when they killed him. That's a historical fact. Every time
[25:19.080 --> 25:23.960]  they cut taxes, more revenue comes in because people make more money, the economy explodes.
[25:23.960 --> 25:28.480]  This is about control. We were brought into this recession and now this deepening recession
[25:28.480 --> 25:33.960]  going into hyperinflation by design. We have the documents. We told you they would call
[25:33.960 --> 25:37.720]  for world government run by the banks. We told you they'd call for a one-world government
[25:37.720 --> 25:44.680]  currency. The UN called for that today. It's in Reuters. They're calling for it in hundreds
[25:44.680 --> 25:49.880]  of publications every day. Everything we told you. We know exactly what's happening. This
[25:49.880 --> 25:57.800]  show knows exactly what's going on. And frankly, most of the other Patriot Talk shows don't.
[25:57.800 --> 26:02.960]  The mainline liberals and mainline conservatives don't because you don't read globalist documents.
[26:02.960 --> 26:10.360]  We do. Now, why do they want Obama? Well, after eight years of Bill Clinton carrying
[26:10.360 --> 26:15.440]  the baton, carrying the ball so far, he was worn out. The public was upset and very angry
[26:15.440 --> 26:20.240]  with the Democratic Party because, again, the party is owned by foreign interests that don't
[26:20.240 --> 26:26.240]  have our interest. And so everything they do is unpopular. And so then they say, okay,
[26:26.240 --> 26:30.280]  George W. Bush will save you. And conservatives went and supported him no matter what he did
[26:30.280 --> 26:34.760]  because they were so mad at Bill Clinton. And then it took people seven years to wake
[26:34.760 --> 26:39.880]  up. Bush's approval rating went down to, what, 18% or something? Channies at nine, Congress
[26:39.880 --> 26:45.440]  at nine, Hillary Clinton at 20 something? Because both parties doing the opposite of
[26:45.440 --> 26:49.400]  what the polls say the people want. They do the opposite of what the Bill of Rights and
[26:49.400 --> 26:54.440]  Constitution says. And so they finally, with a year-long campaign, get people tied into
[26:54.440 --> 27:00.040]  it in the primaries and, okay, okay, we don't, we hope, we hope there'll be change. We hope
[27:00.040 --> 27:08.200]  he'll remake things. Barack Obama will vote for him. And what scares me about Barack Obama,
[27:08.200 --> 27:11.760]  and it wouldn't matter, again, if McCain's in the same agenda, the same policies, just
[27:11.760 --> 27:19.160]  different rhetoric, it's just that he would have no support. He would be tied to that
[27:19.160 --> 27:24.920]  dead political animal, politically dead George W. Bush, the lame duck. So the establishment
[27:24.920 --> 27:33.440]  needs Barack Obama. And they are doing something I've never seen them do even with Ronald Reagan.
[27:33.440 --> 27:37.920]  They are building him up like a messianic leader, even mainstream news saying hope, change,
[27:37.920 --> 27:41.360]  he will change the world. He is the president of the world. Newsweek is calling him the
[27:41.360 --> 27:49.880]  president of the world. And now we're going to go from the phony right-wing anti-terror.
[27:49.880 --> 27:52.800]  That's going to stay, though. All those policies are going to stay, but just now they're going
[27:52.800 --> 27:57.520]  to be quiet. They're going to depoliticize them. So it's not fashionable to fight them.
[27:57.520 --> 28:01.360]  The warrantless checkpoints, the police state, the face scanners, the thumb scanners to buy
[28:01.360 --> 28:09.120]  and sell, the federal checkpoints, the youth brigades, the Tattletale squads, the FBI, Spinaly
[28:09.120 --> 28:15.880]  American people, regular Army and Defense Intelligence, Spinaly American people. I told you that it
[28:15.880 --> 28:19.440]  was a whole bunch of brigades. If you read the bottom of the Army Times, it actually
[28:19.440 --> 28:23.840]  mentioned that the new brigade was joining all these other brigades and units. Now the
[28:23.840 --> 28:29.800]  Air Force came out two days ago at mainstreamnewsuponmfolwark.com. Paul Watson, our story about it at
[28:29.800 --> 28:34.000]  prismplanet.com, announced, oh yeah, there's all these other brigades and units now joining
[28:34.000 --> 28:41.040]  on top of all the others. They're taking battle-hardened, psycho, four or five tour troops back here
[28:41.040 --> 28:48.480]  to America. Gung Ho over the top, the most hardcore killers from the Army, the most savage,
[28:48.480 --> 28:54.360]  battle-hardened units they've got. They're bringing right into Rome. They've crossed
[28:54.360 --> 28:59.000]  the Rubicon. They've openly brought them into Rome. They threatened Congress a month ago
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.040]  with martial law. They didn't go along with it. And Barack Obama says he supports it all.
[29:04.040 --> 29:11.120]  He's going to expand it and have a million-plus youth brigade of young people in uniform spying
[29:11.120 --> 29:17.440]  on their neighbors. And now I'm a right-wing John McCain supporter because I don't like
[29:17.440 --> 29:23.040]  him doing that. I don't like John McCain proposing the same thing and proposing, oh, let's have
[29:23.040 --> 29:30.280]  a military surge to fight crime with troops in America. You people in the left-right system
[29:30.280 --> 29:37.760]  get wake up. Stop being such idiots. You understand, ladies and gentlemen? I'll tell you why else
[29:37.760 --> 29:43.160]  they want Barack Obama when we get back and then take your calls.
[29:43.160 --> 30:05.720]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right? First, I get the best parking space

[33:14.200 --> 33:24.160]  they want Barack Obama in there. But the number one reason is and by the way Roman Caesars
[33:24.160 --> 33:35.680]  would do this in Gaul, in Germania, in Judea, in Alexandria. They would send in a governor
[33:35.680 --> 33:42.520]  for four or five years who would squeeze and torture and kill and act like a buffoon. They
[33:42.520 --> 33:47.520]  would even have the Roman heralds who would cry out the news of the government, badmouth
[33:47.520 --> 33:56.320]  the governor in the name of the Caesar and then they would send the savior later and
[33:56.320 --> 34:04.000]  the public would put up with even more tyranny just because they were well spoken and would
[34:04.000 --> 34:10.000]  do a few public stunts to be nice to the public or let a few people out of prison.
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.560]  Now I didn't give you the full equation there. This is in Roman handbooks. This is in quite
[34:15.560 --> 34:18.560]  a few books. I mean I mentioned a lot. Battle for Gaul mentioned some of that but there's
[34:18.560 --> 34:24.800]  quite a few other books written on statecraft by Caesars and historians and others explaining
[34:24.800 --> 34:31.960]  how they would do this. But let's say they had rebellion in a province and they didn't
[34:31.960 --> 34:36.280]  have somebody who was hardcore enough. They would then send someone even more vicious
[34:36.280 --> 34:42.760]  to say crucify a third of the population. They would go into an area and round up tens
[34:42.760 --> 34:48.120]  of thousands of people over a year crucifying them, hanging them dead out of trees all over
[34:48.120 --> 34:55.200]  the area. They would take incredibly expensive salt and ship it in and dump it into the fields
[34:55.200 --> 35:00.080]  so they couldn't robe and then they would send again after that person had just crushed
[35:00.080 --> 35:07.360]  and slaughtered everybody the savior. These are handbooks ladies and gentlemen. There
[35:07.360 --> 35:12.320]  are slave handbooks written in Rome republished by the British and the French for the sugar
[35:12.320 --> 35:20.200]  cane colonies in the Caribbean on how to set the women up over the men. The house women
[35:20.200 --> 35:24.640]  with the men out in the barn and how to control that and how to raise the children up. It's
[35:24.640 --> 35:31.560]  a science. It was a science then, it's a science now. And they do everything they can to tell
[35:31.560 --> 35:35.760]  you government's inept and doesn't know what it's doing and they couldn't tie their shoelaces.
[35:35.760 --> 35:43.880]  You know how complex a factory is, just an average factory that say makes glass? All
[35:43.880 --> 35:49.760]  the huge systems are a steel mill. How about NASA? How about the CIA? How about operations
[35:49.760 --> 35:56.680]  they carry up? Now down at the low level they do have slimy red tape bureaucracy but that's
[35:56.680 --> 36:04.400]  only to capture you, not them. Alright, I'm digressing and I want to go to your calls.
[36:04.400 --> 36:14.880]  So here comes Obama, shiny face, smiling, well-spoken, all the right mannerisms and gestures. And
[36:14.880 --> 36:19.800]  the media does everything they can to build him up and oh, grandma gets sick right on
[36:19.800 --> 36:25.640]  time and grandma dies. Tell you that stinks, folks. It's like Clinton's mother was shooting
[36:25.640 --> 36:29.080]  her mouth off, bye-bye mommy right when he got elected. Well, she died the day before
[36:29.080 --> 36:37.920]  he got elected. But whatever. The point is, here comes the savior and they tell the world
[36:37.920 --> 36:41.520]  he loves you, Europe. He doesn't turn your back on you. He doesn't turn your back on
[36:41.520 --> 36:46.720]  you Arabs. Yeah, the America wants to be friendly but we are going to stand up to Iran and we
[36:46.720 --> 36:52.040]  are going to go ahead and go into Pakistan and we are going to encircle Russia and Joe
[36:52.040 --> 36:56.360]  Biden and others say he's going to do some really unpopular stuff for the left. We're
[36:56.360 --> 37:02.160]  going to cut teacher pay and we're going to increase the defense spending by a trillion
[37:02.160 --> 37:09.120]  dollar defense budget, 400 billion bigger than the last one, that's not big enough. And we're
[37:09.120 --> 37:17.160]  going to do all these things and open borders and national ID cards and all of it, worker
[37:17.160 --> 37:22.360]  visas for all. And they're going to have the House, the Senate and the executive. They're
[37:22.360 --> 37:27.360]  going to have the legislative and the executive and they're going to have a media firmly behind
[37:27.360 --> 37:32.040]  him and they'll probably stage a terror attack very soon after he's elected within the first
[37:32.040 --> 37:36.680]  year so he can grandstand and bomb some third world country and conservatives will go, I
[37:36.680 --> 37:43.120]  didn't like him before but I like him now. Because the good old boys will be getting
[37:43.120 --> 37:48.640]  homeland security jobs as they convert the economy over to that. Oh, it's going to be
[37:48.640 --> 37:53.600]  government make work but it's not going to be building dams and bridges and rest stops
[37:53.600 --> 38:02.960]  and planting orchards. No, it's going to be. They say it's going to be domestic spies.
[38:02.960 --> 38:07.520]  By the way, Obama didn't come up with that. That was set up by George Bush, started by
[38:07.520 --> 38:10.800]  Bill Clinton but actually executed. I'll never forget the Philadelphia Daily News and other
[38:10.800 --> 38:20.920]  papers describing freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors in high schools across the country
[38:20.920 --> 38:25.040]  training and warrant service checkpoints, writing dossies on their parents and at the
[38:25.040 --> 38:32.200]  shooting range shooting M16s with the Army, the FBI and the BATF. They're already all
[38:32.200 --> 38:38.200]  around you. Just like the 26,000 preachers hired to tell their flocks to accept martial
[38:38.200 --> 38:44.480]  law and turn their guns in. This is a huge military operation by the foreign banks looting
[38:44.480 --> 38:50.720]  everything so they're talking about change. Yes, we've had one leg hacked off. They're
[38:50.720 --> 38:54.080]  going to hack another leg off and let us bleed out. They're going to take the tourniquets
[38:54.080 --> 39:02.580]  off our legs. You have so folks, you're going to see change like you never saw. I remember
[39:02.580 --> 39:08.200]  going on there when George Bush was elected and saying, get ready, folks. Get ready. You're
[39:08.200 --> 39:14.100]  going to see tyranny. You're going to see stage terror. You're going to see a new world
[39:14.100 --> 39:19.760]  order because it's their job. Republicans and conservatives were at the point of rebellion
[39:19.760 --> 39:24.240]  over Bill Clinton. Here comes George Bush to pacify him. Then the liberals are at the
[39:24.240 --> 39:30.120]  point of rebellion over George Bush. The whole country woke up doing, not just liberals.
[39:30.120 --> 39:38.400]  Here comes the liberal savior. And of course, we've seen massive election fraud in the Supreme
[39:38.400 --> 39:41.920]  Court appointing Bush and then John Kerry taking the dive and people going to prison
[39:41.920 --> 39:46.520]  for killing the election in 2004. Oh, but now see Barack Obama will be elected to landslide
[39:46.520 --> 39:51.520]  proving the machines are safe and work. Meanwhile, stealing all the local elections from people,
[39:51.520 --> 39:56.520]  the new older doesn't like stealing governorships, stealing legislative seats in the States,
[39:56.520 --> 40:02.120]  unifying, cementing, quieting the debate about the voting machines where we've gone from
[40:02.120 --> 40:08.920]  90 plus percent, not believing there's fraud to over 90% in major polls believing there
[40:08.920 --> 40:13.960]  is systemic top down election fraud. That'll kind of save that. And I've even heard the
[40:13.960 --> 40:18.320]  pundits say, oh, he'll bring people back into trusting government, back into working together
[40:18.320 --> 40:23.120]  as a country, but we're not working together as a country. We're going under their control.
[40:23.120 --> 40:29.720]  When people wake up in four to eight years, they'll give us another sniveling fake Republican,
[40:29.720 --> 40:35.120]  but lots of conservative talk who will then triple the size of the government again, like
[40:35.120 --> 40:40.280]  George Bush did and triple the size of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
[40:40.280 --> 40:45.280]  Triple the size of the Department of Education. Sign on to UNESCO and the UN treaties.
[40:45.280 --> 40:53.800]  All right. I've, I've ranted enough. I want to go to your calls. Max Kaiser is coming
[40:53.800 --> 40:57.280]  up. Mike Rivera is coming up and trying to get all the Webster tarp. I want to get him
[40:57.280 --> 41:01.400]  on for 20 minutes or so to debate with Rivera that make for good radio. Interesting thought
[41:01.400 --> 41:10.920]  provoking. You know Rivera, guy, I really respect. He has fallen to his knees before Lord Obama.
[41:10.920 --> 41:15.280]  See that'll create friction between us. I like him. I got him a show on Genesis. I promote
[41:15.280 --> 41:18.600]  him. I think he's a great guy. And, uh, but I have to come out and say when I think he's
[41:18.600 --> 41:27.160]  wrong. I notice my stories aren't linked on his website anymore, but that's fine. Maybe
[41:27.160 --> 41:32.320]  I haven't seen him lately. The point is, is that I have to tell the truth. I have to come
[41:32.320 --> 41:36.840]  out and say it, tell it like it is. And I will not be suckered into giving Aiden Comfort
[41:36.840 --> 41:45.360]  to Barack Obama, who's going to quote, bankrupt the coal industry. You know how many close
[41:45.360 --> 41:55.240]  to a million jobs coal industry provides conservatively. You know what that's going
[41:55.240 --> 42:03.320]  to do? 49% of our power, but McCain was going to do it too. Jamal in Cleveland, Ohio. You're
[42:03.320 --> 42:12.360]  on the air, sir. Yes, sir. Yeah, I've been trying to call your radio station for a long
[42:12.360 --> 42:17.200]  time. I kind of purposely waited for radio that for a nice one day. I'm a fan of your
[42:17.200 --> 42:23.680]  website to a certain degree, but I have a very different opinion of how you feel about Barack
[42:23.680 --> 42:28.040]  Obama. And I hope you give me time to express it. But first, I want to clear something up.
[42:28.040 --> 42:33.200]  That you said, along with back in the primary, you was talking about what was on the Jeremiah
[42:33.200 --> 42:37.760]  right when the whole situation was going on. And you had played a clip on your show of
[42:37.760 --> 42:41.600]  Reverend Jeremiah White, what he was saying about the American government and about them
[42:41.600 --> 42:46.400]  to create an A-virus. Yeah, and I said that I actually agree with him and seen the notice
[42:46.400 --> 42:52.400]  the media attacked Obama for the wrong reasons through issues like that. Right, right. I
[42:52.400 --> 42:56.680]  didn't get to say the same thing, but I agree that I'm going to ask me a big fan of Jeremiah
[42:56.680 --> 43:00.680]  White, but you said something that was totally wrong. And I have to clear that up before
[43:00.680 --> 43:04.520]  I go on to my point about Obama. And that's what we're going to do is real quick. You
[43:04.520 --> 43:10.400]  said that Al Sharpton was new world order and that Al Sharpton had denounced Reverend
[43:10.400 --> 43:13.840]  Jeremiah White. Now, I'm listening to Al Sharpton. So every day, big man, Al Sharpton.
[43:13.840 --> 43:17.680]  What did I say? Now, hold on. Your phone's a little echoey. What did I say?
[43:17.680 --> 43:24.960]  You said that Al Sharpton had denounced Jeremiah White after Barack Obama had denounced Jeremiah
[43:24.960 --> 43:28.000]  White and you said that Al Sharpton was new world order.
[43:28.000 --> 43:33.200]  Hey, I saw Al Sharpton do it on Fox News and I don't lie, sir. Hold on. Hold on. I don't
[43:33.200 --> 43:38.400]  lie. I did seem to say that and I said he's new world order because he goes on TV with
[43:38.400 --> 43:43.680]  Pat Robertson pushing for a global carbon tax. Al Sharpton has definitely sold out to
[43:43.680 --> 43:45.760]  the system. I mean, he's all over TV now.
[43:45.760 --> 43:50.560]  Well, this is because somebody do a commercial for me in a new world order. But first, but
[43:50.560 --> 43:56.160]  I want to say I was listening to Al Sharpton's radio. So the day that, matter of fact, at
[43:56.160 --> 44:01.480]  the moment that he puts out different messages on different venues, my friend, can I please
[44:01.480 --> 44:02.480]  send it?
[44:02.480 --> 44:05.040]  Yeah, but yeah, but you're saying he didn't say it and I saw him say it.
[44:05.040 --> 44:10.560]  Let me, if you let me finish. I've seen the Fox News and I don't know what you called
[44:10.560 --> 44:15.360]  denouncing somebody, but I don't know. Maybe you misinterpreted what he said, but at the
[44:15.360 --> 44:21.600]  moment that Barack Obama was denouncing Reverend Wright, Al Sharpton said, and I listen to Al
[44:21.600 --> 44:25.760]  Sharpton every day. I'm very complex. I'm very impressed with the black community and
[44:25.760 --> 44:31.040]  Al Sharpton practices black liberation theology. At the moment that Barack Obama was denouncing
[44:31.040 --> 44:35.760]  Reverend Wright, Al Sharpton, his exact words were this, I'm not going to denounce Barack
[44:35.760 --> 44:40.400]  Obama, but I agree with Reverend Wright. This is his exact words. I agree with Reverend
[44:40.400 --> 44:46.320]  Wright. I practice black liberation theology and he said on the air, three television networks
[44:46.320 --> 44:51.280]  just called me and asked me to come on TV and denounce Barack Obama.
[44:51.280 --> 44:55.840]  Okay. Let me just stop you. Let me just stop you. I saw him on Fox News. I'm going from
[44:55.840 --> 44:58.800]  memory. I might have been CNN. The point is he's on there all the time. So I doubt we
[44:58.800 --> 45:02.880]  saw the same program and he said, you know, I don't think it's good, but look, look,
[45:02.880 --> 45:06.960]  look, sir, I'm not going to sit here and debate all this. It doesn't even matter. It doesn't
[45:06.960 --> 45:13.440]  even matter. You know what? I want to see black leaders, but I didn't. I saw a black state
[45:13.440 --> 45:17.120]  attorney out there telling black folks it was the law to line up and take shots and then
[45:17.120 --> 45:19.840]  I had him on the show and he said, well, I don't give my own children the shots and it's
[45:19.840 --> 45:24.960]  not the law. And so I supported Reverend Wright and saying that the AIDS virus was engineered
[45:24.960 --> 45:28.360]  and I talk about real issues. Let me tell you something. You're not going to hear Barack
[45:28.360 --> 45:32.280]  Obama come out against that. You're not going to hear him come out against Planned Parenthood.
[45:32.280 --> 45:36.200]  He's actually for it. Just like Margaret Sanger went and we have the documents went and hired
[45:36.200 --> 45:41.480]  black folks to sell blacks on going along with eugenics. And so just like white folks
[45:41.480 --> 45:46.440]  buying into, you know, the propaganda, black folks are doing the same thing. Just watch
[45:46.440 --> 45:51.160]  and see and just, just see what happens, my friend. Let me make my point because I'm
[45:51.160 --> 45:55.960]  going to get into that also, but the outside interview was on female. He was on Larry King
[45:55.960 --> 46:00.680]  show that night and I was on a bunch of TV. I vaguely remember what you're talking about.
[46:00.680 --> 46:04.560]  Talking about Al Sharpton coming out against Reverend Wright and I wouldn't have said it
[46:04.560 --> 46:07.720]  if I hadn't saw it. Look, I got to go. I got to go to other callers, sir. I appreciate
[46:07.720 --> 46:10.960]  your calling. It doesn't matter. Don't worry. They're going to keep spraying the skies
[46:10.960 --> 46:14.720]  with aluminum oxide. They're going to keep putting poison in your water. They're going
[46:14.720 --> 46:18.600]  to keep on shooting your kids up full of mercury. They're going to keep those death mills going
[46:18.600 --> 46:23.040]  in your community. They're going to continue the wars. They're going to continue the taxes
[46:23.040 --> 46:27.700]  and the regulation, but it won't matter. We can all get into the fake football game of
[46:27.700 --> 46:35.040]  Rock Obama versus McCain. Okay. God help us. Oh my gosh. Patrick in North Carolina here
[46:35.040 --> 46:36.040]  on the air.
[46:36.040 --> 46:37.040]  How's it going?
[46:37.040 --> 46:38.040]  Pretty good. Go ahead.
[46:38.040 --> 46:44.080]  Well, I want to talk about two things today. The first thing was fluoride. I was at my
[46:44.080 --> 46:50.120]  dentist the other day and I was asking them where fluoride came from and the first usage
[46:50.120 --> 46:55.400]  of fluoride. And she didn't know where the first usage of fluoride was, but she said
[46:55.400 --> 46:59.280]  fluoride came naturally in water and the soil.
[46:59.280 --> 47:05.240]  Yeah. Total lies. Calcium fluoride, stop. Calcium fluoride does in small amounts of
[47:05.240 --> 47:11.080]  its needed. You need small amounts of arsenic. Sodium fluoride's deadly enough, but it's
[47:11.080 --> 47:13.840]  a cover name for a bunch of other poisons. Go ahead.
[47:13.840 --> 47:20.000]  But yeah, what they were saying on the National Cancer Institute's website was sodium fluoride
[47:20.000 --> 47:24.520]  is found, but it's in such trace amounts that it's nothing. They have to add it to
[47:24.520 --> 47:33.000]  the water by usage of, what is it? Phosphorus, I think it is. Extracts. I'm sort of a...
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.360]  No, no. Look, they take the total toxic waste.
[47:36.360 --> 47:37.960]  It's a fertilizer though.
[47:37.960 --> 47:42.520]  From fertilizer and aluminum manufacturing and they dump it in your water.
[47:42.520 --> 47:43.520]  Yeah.
[47:43.520 --> 47:48.040]  And it's not even really what you'd call sodium fluoride. That's a misnomer. It's a group
[47:48.040 --> 47:54.000]  of three different... Look, I've had top scientists on. Just go, folks, go research it for yourself.
[47:54.000 --> 47:59.480]  It's deadly poison. But we're not going to worry about that. We're getting changed. Just
[47:59.480 --> 48:04.200]  like we got with George Bush. Anything else?
[48:04.200 --> 48:05.200]  No.
[48:05.200 --> 48:10.160]  So she told you that it was calcium fluoride and wonderful fluoride and then what did you
[48:10.160 --> 48:11.160]  say to her?
[48:11.160 --> 48:14.160]  No. She didn't tell me it was wonderful for me or anything like that. I was just asking
[48:14.160 --> 48:16.400]  her questions. She was giving me answers.
[48:16.400 --> 48:18.320]  Well, remember, most dentists, most doctors...
[48:18.320 --> 48:22.160]  I like to go around and ask general people questions because I like to get what...
[48:22.160 --> 48:23.160]  No.
[48:23.160 --> 48:28.440]  They're compartmentalized. That dentist isn't bad lady. Doctors aren't. They're compartmentalized.
[48:28.440 --> 48:33.200]  They're compartmentalized. They don't know why diabetes is up several thousand percent
[48:33.200 --> 48:37.240]  or cancers from one in 33 to one in two with males, one in three with females. They don't
[48:37.240 --> 48:41.680]  know why they've gone from one in 25,000 with autism to one in 87. They don't know why there's
[48:41.680 --> 48:46.520]  kids dying all over the place. But we do because we go and read what the research scientists
[48:46.520 --> 48:49.720]  are saying. What the governments say. They knew when they approved cell phones in the
[48:49.720 --> 48:51.320]  80s they were going to give you brain cancer.
[48:51.320 --> 48:55.920]  Have you heard of get you home dot gov?
[48:55.920 --> 48:56.920]  Yes.
[48:56.920 --> 49:02.040]  Yeah. It's a new thing. It's like the new NAU push that they've got going on.
[49:02.040 --> 49:06.760]  They're taking over all the major roads to tax. That'll be the taxing authority to travel
[49:06.760 --> 49:11.160]  for the North American Union. It's all publicly announced and the public is told it doesn't
[49:11.160 --> 49:15.640]  exist. But don't worry. You're going to have change. You're going to have Barack Obama.
[49:15.640 --> 49:18.120]  In your passport to get to these places?
[49:18.120 --> 49:25.960]  Yes. You're going to have a North American Union. It's a North American Union ID. That's
[49:25.960 --> 49:31.960]  what they call it. And then on all the major 83 interstate federal highways, you will have
[49:31.960 --> 49:34.640]  to have that card to travel and you'll be taxed.
[49:34.640 --> 49:36.320]  Yeah. That's exactly right. Yep.
[49:36.320 --> 49:40.840]  Oh, they got TV ads saying it now. Everything I told you is right out of government documents.
[49:40.840 --> 49:46.200]  Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. The bankers run it. The bankers run it. Barack Obama and George
[49:46.200 --> 49:50.360]  Bush don't run squat. How long have I been saying Bush is a puppet?
[49:50.360 --> 49:51.360]  Forever.
[49:51.360 --> 49:56.360]  And being called a commie. Okay. When he tripled the size of the government, now I'm going
[49:56.360 --> 50:02.600]  to be a fascist racist. So sick of it. So sick of the public being so weak-minded.
[50:02.600 --> 50:08.960]  No, but really people should get, take a look at get you home.gov. If you really want to
[50:08.960 --> 50:10.440]  see a hardcore push for them, you'll see them.
[50:10.440 --> 50:15.720]  John, a month ago I sent you, thanks. I appreciate your call. John, a month ago I sent you for
[50:15.720 --> 50:22.120]  three weeks ago. I sent you the National ID card, North American Union ID card. I sent
[50:22.120 --> 50:28.440]  you a TV news ad for that. I actually sent you a government ad for that. You'll never
[50:28.440 --> 50:33.240]  find it. I don't remember the title. I think it was something like North American ID, North
[50:33.240 --> 50:39.640]  American Travel Pass. That's what it's called. Oh, help me. You know what travel passes mean.
[50:39.640 --> 50:49.800]  It's on what you exhale. The Club of Rome and the CFR say the state is organizing itself
[50:49.800 --> 51:02.240]  under a war economy to wage war on the individual and the family. Mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday.
[51:02.240 --> 51:06.720]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty? What are you going to do once your
[51:06.720 --> 51:12.720]  food is gone? What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?

[52:01.000 --> 52:06.280]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[52:06.280 --> 52:12.000]  against this country. The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin
[52:12.000 --> 52:16.320]  Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin
[52:16.320 --> 52:21.040]  Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[52:21.040 --> 52:25.760]  to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that
[52:25.760 --> 52:32.000]  there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that
[52:32.000 --> 52:37.280]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers'
[52:37.280 --> 52:42.040]  ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings
[52:42.040 --> 52:47.120]  in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at
[52:47.120 --> 52:53.360]  infowars.com. Or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[52:53.360 --> 53:01.040]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[53:01.040 --> 53:05.120]  Phase 1 of the Insider's Plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent
[53:05.120 --> 53:10.040]  bailout. International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create
[53:10.040 --> 53:14.920]  a new currency and a new world bank to act as saviour. But we've only seen the beginning.
[53:14.920 --> 53:19.600]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times. Shortages
[53:19.600 --> 53:24.000]  and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land. The insiders have discovered
[53:24.000 --> 53:29.400]  that they must control two things to seize total power. Phase 1 is a one world currency
[53:29.400 --> 53:33.960]  which we are currently being prepared to accept. Phase 2 of their insidious plan is complete
[53:33.960 --> 53:43.360]  control of our food supplies. Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details. That's www.foodshortageusa.com

[54:03.800 --> 54:21.560]  Each bounding down loaded up and trucking. The global issues tribalism and divide and
[54:21.560 --> 54:50.360]  drifts
[54:50.360 --> 54:53.900]  They were saying that Al Gore wouldn't be able to get the New World Order agenda through
[54:53.900 --> 54:57.320]  because people were wise to him because of Bill Clinton.
[54:57.320 --> 55:01.000]  They were like, you traitor, you coming.
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  Now I got black folks emailing me going, how much we liked you, how come you don't like
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  black people?
[55:08.000 --> 55:13.600]  Oh man, I don't even care what people think about me anymore.
[55:13.600 --> 55:15.560]  I know I'm right.
[55:15.560 --> 55:19.840]  All I do is study this and I'm not a sucker and I'm not going to be a sucker.
[55:19.840 --> 55:25.920]  So you're going out there, all you liberal, well-meaning idiots, black folks, everybody
[55:25.920 --> 55:26.920]  else.
[55:26.920 --> 55:27.920]  Go vote for Barack Obama.
[55:27.920 --> 55:31.520]  If the establishment didn't want him, he wouldn't win today.
[55:31.520 --> 55:33.720]  There's election fraud.
[55:33.720 --> 55:34.720]  You remember that.
[55:34.720 --> 55:39.760]  When they didn't want Al Gore or John Kerry in there, they lost even though they won.
[55:39.760 --> 55:41.760]  You just remember that.
[55:41.760 --> 55:51.120]  All right, I want to go to Ed, Francis, Jake, Scott, and others, but I just can't help
[55:51.120 --> 55:52.120]  it.
[55:52.120 --> 55:53.120]  I got to play this last part.
[55:53.120 --> 55:56.480]  Make no mistake, folks, the New World Order is on your tail.
[55:56.480 --> 55:57.480]  They are poisoning you.
[55:57.480 --> 56:03.520]  Oh, he's got their ears on, and he's hot on your trail, and he ain't going to rest in
[56:03.520 --> 56:08.480]  New York jail, so you've got to dodge him, you've got to duck him, you've got to keep
[56:08.480 --> 56:14.480]  that piece of truck in, so get that hammer down and give him hell.
[56:14.480 --> 56:17.480]  Yeah, we're not going to stop.
[56:17.480 --> 56:21.960]  We're not going to get fooled by the presidential topics, legitimizing the fraud machines.
[56:21.960 --> 56:25.080]  We're not going to get scammed by the New World Order.
[56:25.080 --> 56:33.480]  That Bev Harris popping in later, Max Kaiser, Senator Dean, Mark Lee, Mike Rivera.
[56:33.480 --> 56:40.000]  Here's a couple of your TV ads, but here they are about your North American Union travel
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.000]  card.
[56:41.000 --> 56:45.480]  Oh, your North American travel card, here it is.
[56:45.480 --> 56:55.600]  Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain, for purple mountain majesties,
[56:55.600 --> 56:58.160]  above the brooded plain.
[56:58.160 --> 57:04.040]  On June 1st, 2009, new document requirements will make getting home from Canada, Mexico
[57:04.040 --> 57:07.440]  and the Caribbean by land or sea more efficient.
[57:07.440 --> 57:09.760]  Now, isn't that beautiful, America?
[57:09.760 --> 57:15.960]  Learn more about the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative at GetYouHome.gov.
[57:15.960 --> 57:20.320]  When you go to the site, it's called the North American Travel Pass, it's like a driver's
[57:20.320 --> 57:21.320]  license.
[57:21.320 --> 57:23.600]  Now, that's the one they're going to give all the illegal aliens to make them legal.
[57:23.600 --> 57:26.680]  See, they're going to end the illegal alien problems, they're going to make it all legal.
[57:26.680 --> 57:29.520]  That's going to be illegal for you to go down there and back and forth.
[57:29.520 --> 57:35.680]  No border, baby, nothing but those toll roads, taxing the daylight side of you.
[57:35.680 --> 57:39.680]  Every agenda of George Bush is going to be followed by Barack Obama because it wasn't
[57:39.680 --> 57:44.080]  George Bush or Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan's agenda.
[57:44.080 --> 57:48.560]  It was the New World Orders agenda, it was the corporate bankers, every way they can
[57:48.560 --> 57:53.680]  tax you, every way they can regulate you, every way they can cheat you.
[57:53.680 --> 57:59.480]  Oh, man, all those years have been called a right winger under Clinton now to be called
[57:59.480 --> 58:06.640]  a hardcore commie for the last eight years, and now I'm going to be a racist.
[58:06.640 --> 58:10.920]  Because the public is drinking the Kool-Aid, and again, it's only about, what, 35%, 40%,
[58:10.920 --> 58:15.840]  they're saying 80% turnout, so I guess about 40% of the country are more is going to be
[58:15.840 --> 58:16.840]  voting for Obama.
[58:16.840 --> 58:21.360]  So that's quite a group, suckered back in, 9% approval rating for that Congress.
[58:21.360 --> 58:25.000]  You can figure out there a pack of criminals, a thousand to one phone calls against the
[58:25.000 --> 58:30.480]  banker takeover, but they passed it, I thought Obama was bringing change, he was the biggest
[58:30.480 --> 58:35.560]  guy out there pushing it, when 95% of us didn't matter what color you were, we're against
[58:35.560 --> 58:36.560]  it.
[58:36.560 --> 58:42.440]  We'll get ready for a lot more.
[58:42.440 --> 58:47.440]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:47.440 --> 58:52.440]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[58:52.440 --> 58:58.240]  I've come with a message of information, 9-11 was an inside job.
[58:58.240 --> 58:59.240]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[58:59.240 --> 59:00.880]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[59:00.880 --> 59:05.520]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage, was engineered by you, David
[59:05.520 --> 59:17.800]  Rockefeller, that's all out of our commission to see for.
[59:17.800 --> 59:18.800]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of just
[59:18.800 --> 59:19.800]  criticism to grow at our own door.
[59:19.800 --> 59:20.800]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[59:20.800 --> 59:21.800]  An inside job?
[59:21.800 --> 59:22.800]  How dare you?
[59:22.800 --> 59:23.800]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:23.800 --> 59:24.800]  All hell is breaking loose on 6-11.
[59:24.800 --> 59:25.800]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:25.800 --> 59:26.800]  All hell is breaking loose on 6-11.
[59:26.800 --> 59:35.800]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:35.800 --> 59:47.800]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:47.800 --> 59:48.800]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[59:48.800 --> 59:49.800]  If the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary
[59:49.800 --> 59:50.800]  of that.
[59:50.800 --> 59:51.800]  Please rise.

[59:52.800 --> 59:53.800]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[59:53.800 --> 59:55.800]  Waging war on corruption.
[59:55.800 --> 1:00:05.800]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.800 --> 1:00:06.800]  Big Brother.
[1:00:06.800 --> 1:00:07.800]  Mainstream media.
[1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:08.800]  Government cover-ups.
[1:00:08.800 --> 1:00:09.800]  You want answers?
[1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:10.800]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:15.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:15.800 --> 1:00:20.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:20.800 --> 1:00:25.800]  The amazing Max Kaiser joining us in one hour.
[1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:26.800]  Don't know who he is.
[1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:27.800]  You'll find out.
[1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:30.800]  Mike Rivera joining us in about eight minutes.
[1:00:30.800 --> 1:00:31.800]  Club of the phones.
[1:00:31.800 --> 1:00:32.800]  Lev Harris popping in.
[1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:37.800]  Senator Dean Bartley popping in with the Senate raise up in Minnesota.
[1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:42.800]  It's all coming up here on election day.
[1:00:42.800 --> 1:00:43.800]  And you know, I'm tempted.
[1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:49.800]  I'm already staying up here at the office to go on international Iranian TV, international
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:52.800]  British radio out of London.
[1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:53.800]  And some other news.
[1:00:53.800 --> 1:01:00.800]  I might as well just maybe do a special report tonight on prisonplanet.tv and only on the
[1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:01.800]  internet streams.
[1:01:01.800 --> 1:01:02.800]  Won't be on the AM and FM dial.
[1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:03.800]  I don't know.
[1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:06.800]  I guess I could talk to Ted and have another board up coming in.
[1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:09.800]  I guess I could go live in my rebroadcast slot on the network.
[1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:10.800]  Cover the election.
[1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:12.800]  See if we can make that happen.
[1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:13.800]  All right.
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:15.800]  Let's take a few more calls.
[1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:19.800]  Ed in Colorado, go ahead, sir.
[1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:23.800]  Sean is a big supporter of you and he's in trouble.
[1:01:23.800 --> 1:01:25.800]  He's in Thailand.
[1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:27.800]  Who's a big supporter?
[1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:29.800]  My son, Sean Fitzgerald.
[1:01:29.800 --> 1:01:35.800]  He's a member of the 911 Colorado 911 fisheries, visionaries and weird change.
[1:01:35.800 --> 1:01:36.800]  Yeah, they're great folks.
[1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:37.800]  What's up?
[1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:38.800]  What's happening?
[1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:43.240]  Well, he's in Thailand and he's been chased by paramilitary police and he's taken refuge
[1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:50.240]  in a medical clinic in Mysot, Thailand and he called me and asked me to call you.
[1:01:50.240 --> 1:01:54.240]  He called me about an hour ago and I've been on, I called you immediately.
[1:01:54.240 --> 1:01:57.240]  Well, how are we going to help him in Thailand or in a medical clinic?
[1:01:57.240 --> 1:02:01.240]  He thought maybe there's some way you could call attention to his.
[1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:03.240]  I got a snicket suspicion.
[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:06.240]  He was videotaping things in a country that isn't so free.
[1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:07.240]  No.
[1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:12.240]  He's a stay-at-home dad with his wife.
[1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:14.240]  No, I'm not saying your son's bad.
[1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:17.240]  I'm trying to imagine why they're after him.
[1:02:17.240 --> 1:02:18.240]  Yeah.
[1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:21.240]  Is there anything that anyone can do to...
[1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:24.240]  Well, I mean, what's the specifics?
[1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:32.240]  He said that last night he was chased by some paramilitaries and got injured and then was
[1:02:32.240 --> 1:02:37.240]  taken into the medical clinic where his wife works and now he's afraid to go out of there
[1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:38.240]  because...
[1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:41.240]  Yeah, he was chased by the youth corps, I guess, or one of their local militia brigades.
[1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:42.240]  Yeah.
[1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:46.240]  Well, you want to tell people where the clinic is?
[1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:49.240]  I mean, have you called the U.S. Embassy?
[1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:51.240]  No, I haven't.
[1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:55.240]  He asked me to call you first, but I think I'll call them next.
[1:02:55.240 --> 1:02:57.240]  Well, listen, I would like to help your son.
[1:02:57.240 --> 1:02:58.240]  Now, what's his name again?
[1:02:58.240 --> 1:03:05.240]  Sean, S-E-A-N Fitzgerald, F-I-T-Z-G-E-R-A-L-D.
[1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:08.240]  What line of work is he in Thailand?
[1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:14.240]  His wife is a senior administrator for the medical clinic for Dr. Sentius.
[1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:20.240]  Well, it's a well-known foundation and he stays home and takes care of his seven-year-old son
[1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:24.240]  and he teaches some English and those other things, but...
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:26.240]  Yeah, Thailand's totally brainwashed.
[1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:29.240]  They worship their king and queen total police state.
[1:03:29.240 --> 1:03:30.240]  Yeah.
[1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:35.240]  He was doing fine for a year and then I don't know what happened, but...
[1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:40.240]  Well, people ask why I haven't left the U.S. One reason I'm gonna stay in fight in the Info War,
[1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:43.240]  but the second reason is there's not a lot of places to run.
[1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:45.240]  Yeah.
[1:03:45.240 --> 1:03:48.240]  Well, how do we help him? What do we do?
[1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:52.240]  Well, I'll call the embassy. Can I email you about this?
[1:03:52.240 --> 1:03:53.240]  Sure.
[1:03:53.240 --> 1:04:01.240]  Okay, then I'll email on your website and I'll get more information and stay in touch, okay?
[1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:04.240]  Okay, thank you. You need to call the embassy?
[1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:09.240]  And that's the first thing I do. Okay, getting off the election there for a minute,
[1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:11.240]  but I'd love to be able to help you out.
[1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:20.240]  We're gonna take more calls from Francis and Jake and Scott and many others that are patiently holding a 1-800-2599-231.
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:23.240]  It is November 4th, 2008.
[1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:30.240]  Americans are lining up thinking that they're actually gonna have some change with Barack H. Obama.
[1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:34.240]  They would have gotten identical agendas, just different rhetoric from both men.
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:38.240]  This will legitimize the electronic fraud machines.
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:43.240]  And this will sucker the public, I guess, for four to eight years again,
[1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:47.240]  as the carbon taxes, the youth brigades, all of it unfolds.
[1:04:47.240 --> 1:04:50.240]  All these people are saying, well, let's see if that's just rhetoric from Obama.
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:53.240]  Now, Obama doesn't run anything. What are you talking about?
[1:04:53.240 --> 1:05:00.240]  We'll be right back. It's not gonna run anything.
[1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:07.240]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:05:07.240 --> 1:05:11.240]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:13.240]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:16.240]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:05:16.240 --> 1:05:24.240]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:05:24.240 --> 1:05:30.240]  Some U.S. investigators believe that they're Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:34.240]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:41.240]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:46.240]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[1:06:01.240 --> 1:06:07.240]  Hello, I'm Steve Sheik. Many have been afraid they needed their food supplies before the election.
[1:06:07.240 --> 1:06:14.240]  The inauguration, not the election, is the deadline given by the Obama insiders for completing your food supplies.
[1:06:14.240 --> 1:06:21.240]  Joe Biden and Colin Powell both stated that shortly after the inauguration, possibly the 21st or 22nd of January,
[1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:27.240]  the new president would be forced by an international incident to make some unpopular decisions.
[1:06:27.240 --> 1:06:32.240]  This functions as an important deadline for getting any food you intend to have.
[1:06:32.240 --> 1:06:40.240]  The unpopular presidential decisions will likely affect restriction of transportation and availability of food distribution.
[1:06:40.240 --> 1:06:46.240]  Order any remaining food needed no later than four weeks before the inauguration to allow for shipping.
[1:06:46.240 --> 1:06:50.240]  Late orders cannot be guaranteed delivery by this deadline for disaster.
[1:06:50.240 --> 1:07:01.240]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, eFoodsDirect.com, 800-409-5633.

[1:07:04.240 --> 1:07:09.240]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective spray.
[1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:11.240]  The reflection blinded our camera.

[1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:20.240]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.

[1:08:00.240 --> 1:08:04.240]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:31.240]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:37.240]  Okay, I want to be clear about this because it's become quite an issue on the Internet.
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:41.240]  Mike Rivera is a great guy. I really respect his political mind.
[1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:44.240]  You know, I was teasing him earlier about, hey, not linking to my stories, but he actually has been.
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:49.240]  He told me Watson hadn't been sending him as many as someone chastising over at whatreallyhappened.com.
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:55.240]  But it is these types of political fights that do get friends, family, neighbors at each other's throats.
[1:08:55.240 --> 1:09:01.240]  And that hasn't happened with Mike and I. It's just that he gets emails trying to stir stuff up between myself and him and others.
[1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:10.240]  I get emails and constant comments on the infowars.com pages about why is Mike Rivera supporting Barack Obama?
[1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:16.240]  Why is he pushing his campaign on a show? Why is he pushing on his website?
[1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:21.240]  And look, I just want to make this point.
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:24.240]  He's a smart guy and he's been right about a lot of things.
[1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:29.240]  And my whole point is, is that I'm not supporting John McCain.
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:33.240]  But I do agree with Webster Tarpoli that John McCain would be a total lame duck.
[1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:35.240]  He would have no support.
[1:09:35.240 --> 1:09:40.240]  And then you'd have a Democratic House and Senate and that would be a separation of powers.
[1:09:40.240 --> 1:09:49.240]  And then he wouldn't be able to get any of his agenda through, which is almost identical to Obama's on more wars and carbon taxes and all these other bad things.
[1:09:49.240 --> 1:09:54.240]  So I've had callers calling in, you know, one earlier kind of mad at me for not supporting Obama.
[1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:58.240]  And I had people emailing me asking if I'm a racist because I'm not supporting Obama.
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:06.240]  Folks, I can't do it. Just like I couldn't support George Bush or Al Gore in 2000, or either one of them in 2004,
[1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:10.240]  John Carrier or George Bush, I made a film about it called American Dictators.
[1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:12.240]  I just can't do it.
[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:20.240]  And I've got my reasons for saying that. I know Mike's got his reasons for saying he thinks Obama's a lesser of two evils.
[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:24.240]  He says there's going to be no honeymoon. He'll immediately start going after Obama.
[1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:30.240]  But when I see him being the heir apparent and the media being behind him and all of this, it really sticks to high heaven.
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:35.240]  So we have to be able to agree to disagree and not to send on each other.
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:43.240]  Though I do want to have Tarpley pop in about 20 minutes because that makes for lively debate and radio to have a discussion with the very first and foremost
[1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:51.240]  because it'll be very thought provoking. But Mike, you've got the floor. I mean, why are you supporting Obama?
[1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:57.240]  Well, again, it's not so much that I'm supporting Obama because after he started moving centrously,
[1:10:57.240 --> 1:10:59.240]  he started saying a lot of things I disagreed with.
[1:10:59.240 --> 1:11:08.240]  It's, as you said earlier, I see him as the lesser of two evils. It's really more being opposed to John McCain,
[1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:14.240]  aka Bush Light, and I had a caller into my own show who really kind of nailed it.
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:22.240]  What's really turned off a lot of people was the manner in which McCain ran his campaign, avoiding the issues, going for the personal attacks,
[1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:29.240]  the flood of emails that probably you've been getting as well as I do, that Obama's real father was Malcolm X,
[1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:34.240]  and just this kind of nonsense, and I think future history is going to look back at the McCain campaign
[1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:41.240]  and really point out the choosing of Sarah Palin was the big mistake
[1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:45.240]  because it really made a lot of people question McCain's ability to make good decisions,
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:47.240]  and that's what we pay the president to do.
[1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:52.240]  And I'll be honest, and I've said this on my own show, if McCain had picked Ron Paul to be his vice president,
[1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:56.240]  I probably would have supported him over Obama.
[1:11:56.240 --> 1:12:01.240]  Like that, in the heat of the moment, then he cannot be relied on to make the right decision
[1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:04.240]  if something really bad starts happening to the United States.
[1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:09.240]  He'll lose his temper, he'll go with his first gut call, and that's a really bad way to run a country.
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:15.240]  But that's what the system did. They ran a political corpse, a guy who statistically will be dead in a few years.
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:19.240]  Most people don't even live a few years. He's lived nine after that cancer on average.
[1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:22.240]  90-plus percent diet for ten years. He's had a relapse.
[1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:27.240]  I mean, they ran like Bob Dole against Bill Clinton, who you hated in 1996.
[1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:28.240]  You fought against Clinton.
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:34.240]  And so, I mean, I see them running this political corpse by design
[1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:37.240]  because they see Barack Obama as their heir apparent.
[1:12:37.240 --> 1:12:42.240]  I mean, Mike, you're against the carbon taxes. You're a Ron Paul supporter.
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:48.240]  You were against Bill Clinton. I mean, what's scary is they're going to have the House, the Senate, and the executive.
[1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:51.240]  They're going to be able to ram through whatever they want.
[1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:54.240]  Yeah, you know, it's not a perfect situation.
[1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:59.240]  And again, just like you and I don't agree 100% on everything that we talk about,
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:02.240]  there was no candidate out there that I 100% agreed with.
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:06.240]  So it really came down to, you know, a numbers game.
[1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:11.240]  And again, I think the reason we're seeing the election results that we're seeing start to emerge across the country,
[1:13:11.240 --> 1:13:15.240]  it's not so much that people were for Barack Obama.
[1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:19.240]  They were just tired of what we've had for the last going on 30 years.
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:22.240]  And change really was the buzzword.
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:27.240]  Of course, the economy is starting to fall apart a little earlier than the Republicans hoped it would.
[1:13:27.240 --> 1:13:28.240]  And that's 28 years.
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:29.240]  That was a major factor.
[1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:32.240]  Just to interrupt, and we'll go back to the economy.
[1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:39.240]  28 years since we haven't had a Bush or a Clinton on the ticket.
[1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:43.240]  So yes, people are saying, we want a change.
[1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:51.240]  The problem is the very same interest that control those other two families are clearly in control of Barack Obama.
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:54.240]  I'm not sure how clearly in control they are.
[1:13:54.240 --> 1:14:00.240]  I know Obama's a professional politician and he says whatever he thinks he needs to say to win.
[1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:07.240]  But you know, if you look at the various issues that are kind of a push for both of them, it really comes down to enthusiasm.
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:15.240]  And whereas Barack Obama talks about war in Iraq and Iran, although he's talking about bringing the troops home a lot sooner than McCain was,
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:23.240]  I really got a sense that McCain enjoys the idea of being commander-in-chief and sending people off to war.
[1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:27.240]  Whereas Barack Obama, I think, is willing to do it if he perceives it's necessary.
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:30.240]  But he's not as in love emotionally with the idea.
[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:39.240]  And the bottom line is that I keep going back to Lyndon Johnson and this famous meeting he had with Dr. Martin Luther King in the White House
[1:14:39.240 --> 1:14:44.240]  where we brought Dr. King and said, OK, how are we going to get this civil rights thing to work?
[1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:50.240]  And Dr. King, after realizing that Lyndon Johnson wasn't kidding him, said, you know, Mr. President, forgive me,
[1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:55.240]  I'm gratified to hear you making some serious plans about civil rights in this country.
[1:14:55.240 --> 1:14:58.240]  But it's so at odds with what you said during your campaign.
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:03.240]  And Lyndon Johnson said, well, then I was campaigning and I had to make my supporters happy.
[1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:06.240]  And now I'm the president and I can do what I feel is right.
[1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:11.240]  And you know that old Negro spiritual, free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, I'm free at last.
[1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:19.240]  And, you know, I hate to be making my political choices on the basis of who I think is actually hedging a little bit more.
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:27.240]  But I think when Barack Obama finally gets into that oval office, I think he's going to be more inclined to follow his own lead
[1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:31.240]  and a little less do as he's told.
[1:15:31.240 --> 1:15:38.240]  And I think that's one of the reasons there was such, you know, a vocal opposition to him coming from a lot of the vested interests.
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:44.240]  Now, as far as McCain being put up there in order to lose against Obama, I don't think that was the case.
[1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:53.240]  I mean, McCain was all but God when Joe Lieberman came in and said, I support him and all the money and the media attention came in.
[1:15:53.240 --> 1:16:01.240]  And I think the Republicans had a strategy that they were going to run McCain against Hillary and that they could beat Hillary.
[1:16:01.240 --> 1:16:04.240]  And I think McCain would have beat Hillary.
[1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:11.240]  But I think that both Republican and Democrat strategists were paying so much attention to Ron Paul,
[1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:18.240]  they weren't really studying Barack Obama until he had already got himself a good solid foundation.
[1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:24.240]  And the bottom line is that McCain just keeps making mistake after mistake, after mistaken his campaign.
[1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:31.240]  Not only just Sarah Palin, but the way they approached the negative campaigning, the way they tried to manage the Internet
[1:16:31.240 --> 1:16:43.240]  with this top-down sponsored website approach versus Barack Obama got right into the social networking and just really comprehended how that was all working.
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:57.240]  And again, it really comes down to, if you look at the speeches that we saw at the two conventions, Barack Obama does have the ability to inspire his audiences with the idea that it's possible.
[1:16:57.240 --> 1:17:07.240]  Yeah, and to sell us on a whole agenda of tyranny after eight years of Bill Clinton, Republicans wed themselves in George Bush, supported everything he did,
[1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:09.240]  and brought us all that tyranny.
[1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:14.240]  It's dangerous. That's why they staged 9-11, was to get all of this political support.
[1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:22.240]  You've got Joe Biden clearly involved with the head of Pakistani intelligence, clearly involved intimately in the 9-11 attacks.
[1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:25.240]  It's the same military-industrial complex that's in real control.
[1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:33.240]  You don't see Barack Obama saying, repeal the Patriot Act, stop the torture, put Posse Commentaris back into place.
[1:17:33.240 --> 1:17:40.240]  Contrary to that, he's saying he wants a million-man domestic spy force. I mean, Mike, it just doesn't fit.
[1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:47.240]  Well, there is no ideal solution in this race since Ron Paul got blocked out.
[1:17:47.240 --> 1:17:53.240]  And I've not been shy about saying that. When Ron Paul was running, I absolutely supported and backed him.
[1:17:53.240 --> 1:17:57.240]  But Mike, that's not the point I'm making. I understand you're saying you're going with what you've got.
[1:17:57.240 --> 1:18:03.240]  My whole point is, we have a 9% approval rating for Congress, and people are finally getting it all controlled.
[1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:07.240]  I mean, you always say the best way to bring down a dictator is to make you act like a dictator.
[1:18:07.240 --> 1:18:11.240]  Instead, you're going to have 40% of the public that's going to end up voting for Barack Obama,
[1:18:11.240 --> 1:18:17.240]  a record 80-plus percent turnout, who will now support whatever he says because he's their man,
[1:18:17.240 --> 1:18:23.240]  and they had a tightly contested race and are wedded to him psychologically. It's going to be horrible.
[1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:29.240]  Well, I don't see it that way. Obviously, I mean, we saw the same phenomenon when Bush got into power.
[1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:35.240]  But, you know, obviously, I think because of alternative radio, because of shows like yours and our websites,
[1:18:35.240 --> 1:18:39.240]  I think the political honeymoon for Barack Obama is going to be a heck of a lot shorter
[1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:45.240]  because the American people are very upset. And Barack Obama's coming in at a time when the economy is in serious trouble.
[1:18:45.240 --> 1:18:50.240]  You know, if he doesn't show positive results for everybody in the first couple of weeks,
[1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:54.240]  he's going to have a miserable, miserable life. Mike, that's the thing.
[1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:58.240]  He actually was against giving any of the bailout money to the American people.
[1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:02.240]  And I'm against socialism, but if you're going to only give it to foreign banks, might as well give it to the people.
[1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:08.240]  And he is for even bigger banker takeovers here. So that's what I'm saying.
[1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:14.240]  I mean, he's doing everything that's actually unpopular with the public.
[1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:18.240]  They're just hoping things are going to be different. Stay there, Mike.
[1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:22.240]  We'll continue to discuss this and take phone calls and have Webster tartly pop in with you.
[1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:27.240]  That should be some lively debate and discussion when we get back into this quick break with Mike Rivera.
[1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:32.240]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:34.240]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:36.240]  I can't find my wallet.

[1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:34.240]  Join the info war today.
[1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:38.240]  I am so frustrated I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:39.240]  What?
[1:21:39.240 --> 1:21:41.240]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[1:21:41.240 --> 1:21:43.240]  I read something and forget.
[1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:44.240]  I forget people's names.
[1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:48.240]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:50.240]  Okay, slow down.
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:52.240]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:59.240]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum and deodorants, genetically modified foods the way the education system taught you.
[1:21:59.240 --> 1:22:01.240]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:04.240]  You know, I can remember everything now, even entire books.
[1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:05.240]  What? How?
[1:22:05.240 --> 1:22:08.240]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:12.240]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.

[1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:28.240]  Wow, what's the website?
[1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:32.240]  Now, don't forget, it's pmemory.net.
[1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:34.240]  The letter P, memory.net.
[1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:42.240]  Here's a startling fact, the New World Order wants you dead.
[1:22:42.240 --> 1:22:52.240]  Chemicals and toxins are in the air, bio warfare, drugs and unknown substances, foods with no vitamins, fast food for obesity, fluoride in our water.
[1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:53.240]  How do we fight back?
[1:22:53.240 --> 1:22:54.240]  What do we do?
[1:22:54.240 --> 1:22:56.240]  Make a life change decision.

[1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:38.240]  Don't be deceived by the bullies of the trade.
[1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:42.240]  Let's go right back to Mike Rivera.
[1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:46.240]  Mike, you're a smart guy.
[1:23:46.240 --> 1:23:49.240]  You know about the globalist agenda.
[1:23:49.240 --> 1:23:54.240]  All I'm saying is that he's a front man for the same interest.
[1:23:54.240 --> 1:24:01.240]  Carbon taxes, domestic spy forces, banker takeover, the empowerment.
[1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:04.240]  I mean, it's all the same thing.
[1:24:04.240 --> 1:24:07.240]  And we've got the Democrats are going to be in control of everything.
[1:24:07.240 --> 1:24:13.240]  We'll be going into some of the numbers and exit polls that are coming out in the next segment.
[1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:19.240]  And then we're going to have a bunch of people, 40% of the public, that are going to suddenly support it.
[1:24:19.240 --> 1:24:22.240]  Because all the police state stuff put in, oh, that was George Bush.
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:24.240]  But then Barack Obama won't repeal any of it.
[1:24:24.240 --> 1:24:27.240]  I mean, what are you going to do when he doesn't repeal any of this?
[1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:33.240]  Well, basically what you're saying about Barack Obama can also be said about John McCain.
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:36.240]  It is a push between the two of them.
[1:24:36.240 --> 1:24:40.240]  And so what you need to do is look at the places where they're going to be different.
[1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:47.240]  And as I said before, the reason I started pulling away from McCain and leaning toward Obama was that, yes,
[1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:52.240]  they're both in contact with the same movers and shakers.
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:54.240]  It's a question of enthusiasm.
[1:24:54.240 --> 1:24:58.240]  And McCain, I don't sense any hesitation on his part at all.
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:00.240]  He'll just do as he's told.
[1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:05.240]  And I think that Obama, once he's in office, he will drag his heels a lot more.
[1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:10.240]  And I know that's a very subtle difference on which to base a choice like this.
[1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:15.240]  But when you talk about all this new World Order stuff and the influence and the buying of the politicians,
[1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:17.240]  it's on both sides of the aisle.
[1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:20.240]  It's on both sides of the campaign.
[1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:22.240]  So you have to just say it's a push.
[1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:23.240]  It's a push.
[1:25:23.240 --> 1:25:24.240]  Where are they different?
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:26.240]  And let's look at that.
[1:25:26.240 --> 1:25:34.240]  Now, again, I'm going to have an inaugural bombing to make him look like a tough guy.
[1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:38.240]  He's going to invade some country, probably Pakistan.
[1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:40.240]  I got a bad feeling.
[1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:42.240]  Again, I'm not saying vote for McCain.
[1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:44.240]  I'm just pointing out, get ready, folks.
[1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:46.240]  We're going to get changed.
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:48.240]  It's going to be tyranny.
[1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:51.240]  Well, I hope you're wrong, obviously.
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:54.240]  But at time, we'll solve that mystery.
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:59.240]  The bottom line is I'm convinced that McCain, because of the way he ran his campaign,
[1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:01.240]  that's the way he's going to run the country.
[1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:05.240]  And we're getting all these reports about vote fraud from across the country.
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:10.240]  People going into voters' lines and telling Democrats they're supposed to vote tomorrow.
[1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:12.240]  We're getting this from all across the country.
[1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:15.240]  This election is not the study in foregone conclusions.
[1:26:15.240 --> 1:26:17.240]  The media is trying to pretend it is.
[1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:19.240]  But I'm a great believer.
[1:26:19.240 --> 1:26:23.240]  How the candidate runs his campaign is how they're going to run the country.
[1:26:23.240 --> 1:26:27.240]  And looking at the way McCain ran his campaign, it's not a pretty picture.
[1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:30.240]  Well, all I'm saying looks like Barack Obama's going to win.
[1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:35.240]  And so let's just start now saying we want to demand they repeal the warrantless spying on American people.
[1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:39.240]  They've announced a bunch of other brigades that are going to be joining the homeland.
[1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:44.240]  We need to tell Mike, you're not suddenly for troops on the streets because it's Obama, right?
[1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:46.240]  No, I'm absolutely not.
[1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:51.240]  And again, these new troops that are joining the current ones on the street,
[1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:53.240]  that's coming out of the Bush White House.
[1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:58.240]  And remember, even if Obama wins today, and it's out of your in my hand anyway,
[1:26:58.240 --> 1:27:00.240]  the voters are going to the polls.
[1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:01.240]  We've got three months more.
[1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:02.240]  We've got three months more.
[1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:04.240]  Yeah, we've got three months more of Bush.
[1:27:04.240 --> 1:27:12.240]  And he is, you know, if Obama wins, he's going to want to set things up so that Obama and the Democrats take a huge, huge fall.
[1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:19.240]  So, you know, we could see the corporate giveaways go until there's just absolutely nothing in the Treasury when the Democrats...
[1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:21.240]  Wait a minute. Barack Obama has been...
[1:27:21.240 --> 1:27:25.240]  He helped get it passed in the House a month ago on that Friday.
[1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:27.240]  He went in there.
[1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:28.240]  He went on TV.
[1:27:28.240 --> 1:27:31.240]  He said, I'm the champion of the bailout.
[1:27:31.240 --> 1:27:33.240]  Mike, let me ask you this question.
[1:27:33.240 --> 1:27:36.240]  Who's gotten more Wall Street money three to one?
[1:27:36.240 --> 1:27:38.240]  At the moment, Barack Obama.
[1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:43.240]  But the reason for that is it's been obvious to a lot of insiders that he is likely to win,
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:47.240]  and everybody wants to give money to the winners so that they're owed the favors.
[1:27:47.240 --> 1:27:51.240]  The same people who gave money to Barack Obama also gave it to John McCain.
[1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:57.240]  And originally, when Barack Obama was just starting out, most of his funding came from the grassroots,
[1:27:57.240 --> 1:28:02.240]  and the big money people were going to Hillary, and they were going to John McCain.
[1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:06.240]  As soon as Obama won the primary and took it away from Hillary,
[1:28:06.240 --> 1:28:09.240]  that's when all the Wall Street people said, oh, this guy could really do it.
[1:28:09.240 --> 1:28:11.240]  We better get on his good side.
[1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:17.240]  And, you know, the whole rationalization for allowing funding of the candidates
[1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:23.240]  instead of a flat public grant for the campaign is the ability to raise money
[1:28:23.240 --> 1:28:26.240]  is supposed to be a measure of popular support.
[1:28:26.240 --> 1:28:30.240]  And it's crooked, and it's corrupt, and there's a lot of problems with it.
[1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:33.240]  But that's my next question, Mike.
[1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:40.240]  We know there's election fraud coast-to-coast going on by different, you know, local vice-fraud,
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:44.240]  and there's also fraud orchestrated nationally by how they announced their results
[1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:47.240]  through voter-news services now under a new name.
[1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:50.240]  This is going to cement people's minds.
[1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:53.240]  The left has seen it as they've been cheated.
[1:28:53.240 --> 1:28:58.240]  So if it was really George Bush who stole two elections, how come they can't steal it again
[1:28:58.240 --> 1:29:04.240]  for John McCain? Won't that be an endorsement by the electronic fraud system of Barack Obama?
[1:29:04.240 --> 1:29:09.240]  Vote fraud only works when the races are close. It can't reverse a landslide, or it's too obvious.
[1:29:09.240 --> 1:29:12.240]  And I think that's what everybody believes is going to happen today.
[1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:15.240]  The margin is going to be too great to reverse it, and the courts are in the machine.
[1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:19.240]  And regardless, it's going to legitimize the voting system
[1:29:19.240 --> 1:29:21.240]  and people that were awake are going to go to sleep,
[1:29:21.240 --> 1:29:26.240]  and we'll all just dance down the yellow brick road with our savior, our Lord Barack Obama.
[1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:29.240]  On the march, the empire's on the run.
[1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:57.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:59.240 --> 1:30:05.240]  This is also why sanctuary cities have been established for illegal felons called aliens.
[1:30:05.240 --> 1:30:11.240]  Make no mistake about it, it's an invasion of America without a shot being fired.
[1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:14.240]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening,
[1:30:14.240 --> 1:30:20.240]  by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[1:30:34.240 --> 1:30:37.240]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:30:37.240 --> 1:30:41.240]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:30:41.240 --> 1:30:43.240]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:45.240]  But who is the enemy?
[1:30:45.240 --> 1:30:46.240]  Bin Laden.
[1:30:46.240 --> 1:30:47.240]  This is his MO.
[1:30:47.240 --> 1:30:48.240]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:30:48.240 --> 1:30:50.240]  We have to look to the Psalm of Bin Laden.
[1:30:50.240 --> 1:30:53.240]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[1:30:53.240 --> 1:30:57.240]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:30:57.240 --> 1:31:00.240]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[1:31:00.240 --> 1:31:04.240]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:31:04.240 --> 1:31:08.240]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:10.240]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA.
[1:31:10.240 --> 1:31:12.240]  The hijackers' ties to the FBI.
[1:31:12.240 --> 1:31:13.240]  The Saudi Arabian connection.
[1:31:13.240 --> 1:31:15.240]  The Israeli intelligence network.
[1:31:15.240 --> 1:31:16.240]  Warnings and war games.
[1:31:16.240 --> 1:31:17.240]  The shadow government.
[1:31:17.240 --> 1:31:18.240]  And much, much more.

[1:31:36.240 --> 1:31:39.240]  Longtime survivalist author Ragnar Benson wrote,
[1:31:39.240 --> 1:31:43.240]  A survival retreat is a place you go to live, not die.
[1:31:43.240 --> 1:31:45.240]  It is a place out of the mainstream of events
[1:31:45.240 --> 1:31:48.240]  that contains the means to survive without outside support.
[1:31:48.240 --> 1:31:53.240]  A place where you find shelter, protection, food, water, medicine and warmth
[1:31:53.240 --> 1:31:55.240]  you prepared for yourself.
[1:31:55.240 --> 1:31:58.240]  It is defensible and is put together with a realistic understanding
[1:31:58.240 --> 1:32:00.240]  of what the dangers will be.
[1:32:00.240 --> 1:32:02.240]  Ragnar Benson also said,
[1:32:02.240 --> 1:32:03.240]  Why retreat?
[1:32:03.240 --> 1:32:08.240]  This is a question that 90% of our population cannot and will not answer.
[1:32:08.240 --> 1:32:11.240]  If they could, that same 90% would have to admit
[1:32:11.240 --> 1:32:14.240]  that things may not continue on as they are now.
[1:32:14.240 --> 1:32:16.240]  They would also have to admit that they will need a retreat.
[1:32:16.240 --> 1:32:20.240]  Something completely impossible for the average American to do.
[1:32:20.240 --> 1:32:22.240]  Act now before it's too late.
[1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:26.240]  In order to find your new, high-security, self-sufficient,
[1:32:26.240 --> 1:32:28.240]  off-grid, beautiful retreat property,
[1:32:28.240 --> 1:32:30.240]  visit survivalproperty.com.

[1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:55.240]  Front porch sitting in an old rockin' chair
[1:32:55.240 --> 1:33:01.240]  The sun is hot in the Texas sky
[1:33:01.240 --> 1:33:07.240]  Garden growing, clothes out on a line
[1:33:07.240 --> 1:33:13.240]  A dusty road when a car goes by
[1:33:13.240 --> 1:33:19.240]  Story telling a days long ago
[1:33:19.240 --> 1:33:26.240]  And the only place she'd ever been
[1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:31.240]  Singing softly, this world is not my home
[1:33:31.240 --> 1:33:33.240]  Alright folks, we are back live.
[1:33:33.240 --> 1:33:37.240]  Thank you for joining us.
[1:33:37.240 --> 1:33:42.240]  Let me introduce our two guests with this piece of audio
[1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:45.240]  for everybody out there
[1:33:45.240 --> 1:33:49.240]  who is tuning in to us today.
[1:33:49.240 --> 1:33:54.240]  Millions watching on RTL.
[1:33:54.240 --> 1:34:07.240]  Let's get ready to rumble!
[1:34:07.240 --> 1:34:10.240]  Listen, it's always thought provoking to have someone of a debate
[1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:12.240]  and I just put this together today.
[1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:15.240]  I finally got a hold of Webster Tartley about 30 minutes ago.
[1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:18.240]  I wasn't even sure I was going to have him pop in with Mike Rivera today.
[1:34:18.240 --> 1:34:20.240]  Mike's a great guy who I really respect.
[1:34:20.240 --> 1:34:22.240]  You know, I met with Willie Nelson for about four hours
[1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:24.240]  with Jesse Ventura.
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:26.240]  Ventura's against both candidates
[1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:28.240]  and the false left-right paradigm.
[1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:30.240]  But you know, even Willie Nelson,
[1:34:30.240 --> 1:34:32.240]  who's anti-New World Order, has a lot of courage.
[1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:34.240]  He's just so sick of George Bush, he says,
[1:34:34.240 --> 1:34:36.240]  well, let's just give Obama a try.
[1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:38.240]  Let's see what happens.
[1:34:38.240 --> 1:34:41.240]  And then he turns out Bab will come out against him.
[1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:43.240]  He wants to support a black guy.
[1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:45.240]  He wants to have good civil rights.
[1:34:45.240 --> 1:34:47.240]  He wants to see black folks have that pride.
[1:34:47.240 --> 1:34:49.240]  He wants to see wars in.
[1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:51.240]  He wants to hope.
[1:34:51.240 --> 1:34:53.240]  I'm just sorry, what I see from Barack Obama
[1:34:53.240 --> 1:34:55.240]  is actually the whole New World Order agenda
[1:34:55.240 --> 1:34:57.240]  that every president for 40 years
[1:34:57.240 --> 1:34:59.240]  has been following for 45 years
[1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:01.240]  intensifying and the Republican
[1:35:01.240 --> 1:35:03.240]  that comes after him, it'll be even worse.
[1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:05.240]  So I wanted to bring up Webster Tartley
[1:35:05.240 --> 1:35:07.240]  for the next 30 minutes, maybe five minutes
[1:35:07.240 --> 1:35:09.240]  for the next hour or both of them.
[1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:11.240]  So I wanted to bring up Webster Tartley,
[1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:13.240]  who is, of course, what I'd call a progressive,
[1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:15.240]  kind of a mainline liberal
[1:35:15.240 --> 1:35:17.240]  in the whole system and thought
[1:35:17.240 --> 1:35:19.240]  of Mr. Roosevelt
[1:35:19.240 --> 1:35:21.240]  during the Depression,
[1:35:21.240 --> 1:35:23.240]  which I actually really disagree with overall.
[1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:25.240]  But I respect him as well.
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:27.240]  So I disagree with both these men
[1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:29.240]  fundamentally on some issues,
[1:35:29.240 --> 1:35:31.240]  but I also respect them and believe
[1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:33.240]  that they have a great intellect
[1:35:33.240 --> 1:35:35.240]  and positions that need to be looked at
[1:35:35.240 --> 1:35:37.240]  to have a full debate, not be closed-minded.
[1:35:37.240 --> 1:35:39.240]  So let's bring up Webster Tartley.
[1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:41.240]  We've had Mike Rivera on
[1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:43.240]  for the last 25 minutes or so
[1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:45.240]  telling us why he's for Obama,
[1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:47.240]  that he's not giving him a honeymoon,
[1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:49.240]  but he hopes.
[1:35:49.240 --> 1:35:51.240]  Tartley, just in a nutshell,
[1:35:51.240 --> 1:35:53.240]  I want to go back and forth with you and Mike Rivera
[1:35:53.240 --> 1:35:55.240]  of whatreallyhappen.com, of course.
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:57.240]  We have Webster Tartley of the unauthorized biography
[1:35:57.240 --> 1:35:59.240]  of George H. W. Bush
[1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:01.240]  and the authorized biography of Barack H. Obama.
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:03.240]  He dislikes both of them.
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:05.240]  Tell us what we're really dealing with here
[1:36:05.240 --> 1:36:07.240]  and it looks like a huge landslide
[1:36:07.240 --> 1:36:09.240]  for what is being called
[1:36:09.240 --> 1:36:11.240]  the new president of the world,
[1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:13.240]  the savior of Earth by mainstream media, Barack Obama.
[1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:15.240]  Alex,
[1:36:15.240 --> 1:36:17.240]  you have to stop calling me a liberal.
[1:36:17.240 --> 1:36:19.240]  I'm not a liberal in any sense of the word.
[1:36:19.240 --> 1:36:21.240]  Liberal means two things,
[1:36:21.240 --> 1:36:23.240]  that you think that bankers rule the world.
[1:36:23.240 --> 1:36:25.240]  I don't.
[1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:27.240]  And you think there's no such thing as right and wrong.
[1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:29.240]  And I don't agree with that either.
[1:36:29.240 --> 1:36:31.240]  I am an American system traditionalist.
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:33.240]  You want to call me something?
[1:36:33.240 --> 1:36:35.240]  Well, I understand the Hamiltonian.
[1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:37.240]  My goodness.
[1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:39.240]  Alexander Hamilton.
[1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:41.240]  The American mainline.
[1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:43.240]  I know Alexander Hamilton.
[1:36:43.240 --> 1:36:45.240]  Whatever. You support Roosevelt.
[1:36:45.240 --> 1:36:47.240]  In my book, that's plastic
[1:36:47.240 --> 1:36:49.240]  mainline
[1:36:49.240 --> 1:36:51.240]  U.S. Democrat.
[1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:53.240]  This has nothing to do with somebody like Pelosi.
[1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:55.240]  In other words, Roosevelt and Pelosi
[1:36:55.240 --> 1:36:57.240]  are polar opposites.
[1:36:57.240 --> 1:36:59.240]  And that's also the problem with Obama.
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:01.240]  Roosevelt is somebody who fought
[1:37:01.240 --> 1:37:03.240]  and defeated them repeatedly.
[1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:05.240]  He got re-elected four times
[1:37:05.240 --> 1:37:07.240]  by the American people.
[1:37:07.240 --> 1:37:09.240]  This indicates something profound.
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:11.240]  Obama, of course,
[1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:13.240]  is a puppet carefully prepared
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:15.240]  by the trial lateral commission
[1:37:15.240 --> 1:37:17.240]  in the Bilderberg group.
[1:37:17.240 --> 1:37:19.240]  One of the reasons he was chosen
[1:37:19.240 --> 1:37:21.240]  is that his blackness
[1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:23.240]  gives a kind of cover.
[1:37:23.240 --> 1:37:25.240]  Left cover.
[1:37:25.240 --> 1:37:27.240]  I want to get into an argument
[1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:29.240]  over little issues.
[1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:31.240]  But fine, American traditionalists
[1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:33.240]  have said that.
[1:37:33.240 --> 1:37:35.240]  And absolutely, he's got the heavy hitters.
[1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:37.240]  He's got the real global elite behind him.
[1:37:37.240 --> 1:37:39.240]  Finish up. You've got two minutes and I'm going to go to Mike.
[1:37:39.240 --> 1:37:41.240]  I think Obama is the most dangerous
[1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:43.240]  presidential candidate that we've seen.
[1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:45.240]  He is in the same tradition as Jimmy Carter.
[1:37:45.240 --> 1:37:47.240]  But he's about 100 times worth.
[1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:49.240]  He is similar to Carter
[1:37:49.240 --> 1:37:51.240]  in the sense that he was a carefully chosen
[1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:53.240]  creature of the trial lateral commission
[1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:55.240]  Bilderberg group brand corporation.
[1:37:55.240 --> 1:37:57.240]  We have decades and decades
[1:37:57.240 --> 1:37:59.240]  of right-wing reactionary rule
[1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:01.240]  in this country punctuated every now and then
[1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:03.240]  by these abortive interludes
[1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:05.240]  where we have a left-wing demagogue
[1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:07.240]  who comes in and uses slightly different slogans,
[1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:09.240]  generally human rights slogans
[1:38:09.240 --> 1:38:11.240]  to try to relaunch imperialism
[1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:13.240]  in the world.
[1:38:13.240 --> 1:38:15.240]  This is what Obama will do.
[1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:17.240]  Try to give imperialism a face lift.
[1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:19.240]  Try to convince people that American imperialism
[1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:21.240]  is not what they've learned that it is,
[1:38:21.240 --> 1:38:23.240]  but rather that it's something fresh and new
[1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:25.240]  and progressive. His main tasks
[1:38:25.240 --> 1:38:27.240]  will be kicking the Chinese out of Africa
[1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:29.240]  if he can, and courting
[1:38:29.240 --> 1:38:31.240]  confrontation with Russia and China.
[1:38:31.240 --> 1:38:33.240]  And naturally, since Big New Brzezinski
[1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:35.240]  is running the show,
[1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:37.240]  they will be using proxies.
[1:38:37.240 --> 1:38:39.240]  They'll be using pawns and puppets
[1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:41.240]  and kamikaze states
[1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:43.240]  in the same way that they used Georgia
[1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:45.240]  against Russia. They'd like to use Iran
[1:38:45.240 --> 1:38:47.240]  for that and really any other
[1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:49.240]  place that they can dupe
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:51.240]  and mobilize on the internal front.
[1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:53.240]  And really all I'm saying is what Joe Biden
[1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:55.240]  said in Seattle. Biden said two things.
[1:38:55.240 --> 1:38:57.240]  There'll be a confrontation
[1:38:57.240 --> 1:38:59.240]  with Russia in the first six months.
[1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:01.240]  The righteousness of the U.S.
[1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:03.240]  position will be in doubt.
[1:39:03.240 --> 1:39:05.240]  It means that Obama reopens the door
[1:39:05.240 --> 1:39:07.240]  to false flag operations
[1:39:07.240 --> 1:39:09.240]  for them.
[1:39:09.240 --> 1:39:11.240]  And then also supporting aggression
[1:39:11.240 --> 1:39:13.240]  like Sakash Vili. The other perspective
[1:39:13.240 --> 1:39:15.240]  that Biden gave in Seattle was a 12-month
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:17.240]  perspective that Obama
[1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:19.240]  will be so hated because of his
[1:39:19.240 --> 1:39:21.240]  economic decisions, which will be those
[1:39:21.240 --> 1:39:23.240]  of draconian crushing
[1:39:23.240 --> 1:39:25.240]  brutal austerity.
[1:39:25.240 --> 1:39:27.240]  Not to redistribute the wealth.
[1:39:27.240 --> 1:39:29.240]  The Republican propaganda is crazy
[1:39:29.240 --> 1:39:31.240]  on this point. Obama's not going to
[1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:33.240]  redistribute the wealth to the little people.
[1:39:33.240 --> 1:39:35.240]  The wealth goes to his owners
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:37.240]  to Rockefeller, Soros,
[1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:39.240]  Goldman Sachs, the people who
[1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:41.240]  pay for him. He is a Wall Street deployment
[1:39:41.240 --> 1:39:43.240]  in every way. Two other things.
[1:39:43.240 --> 1:39:45.240]  In terms of
[1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:47.240]  fascism, you have to think about
[1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:49.240]  human rights in this country.
[1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:51.240]  In other words, free speech.
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:53.240]  Will we be able to broadcast under
[1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:55.240]  Bruce Cheney? I don't know about others,
[1:39:55.240 --> 1:39:57.240]  but I've been broadcasting, and I know
[1:39:57.240 --> 1:39:59.240]  Alex has, and I think Michael
[1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:01.240]  they've been openly discussing
[1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:03.240]  and Democratic senators and House members are on record
[1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:05.240]  talking about the fairness doctrine.
[1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:07.240]  We have the Obama police in Missouri
[1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:09.240]  on record themselves saying, if you lie
[1:40:09.240 --> 1:40:11.240]  about Obama, we'll arrest you. Stop there.
[1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:13.240]  I really want to go to Mike Rivera.
[1:40:13.240 --> 1:40:15.240]  Mike, you want to go back and forth here?
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:17.240]  Well, I want to respond to some of the things
[1:40:17.240 --> 1:40:19.240]  that Webster was saying, and
[1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:21.240]  my first comment is that
[1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:23.240]  the Bilderbergers
[1:40:23.240 --> 1:40:25.240]  and the trilateralists, and for that
[1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:27.240]  matter, the CFR, and the rest of those
[1:40:27.240 --> 1:40:29.240]  group, they played the game
[1:40:29.240 --> 1:40:31.240]  very much like the Wall Street and financiers.
[1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:33.240]  They
[1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:35.240]  tend to back all of the people they think
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:37.240]  have the potential of pulling off
[1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:39.240]  a run for the White House. So it's not
[1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:41.240]  a case that they're in a position to say,
[1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:43.240]  okay, you're it, and you will automatically
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:45.240]  win.
[1:40:45.240 --> 1:40:47.240]  You know, the whole country
[1:40:47.240 --> 1:40:49.240]  right now is really badly factionalized.
[1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:51.240]  And there
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:53.240]  is no one group that is unquestionably in power.
[1:40:53.240 --> 1:40:55.240]  As you say, you've got the Rockefellers
[1:40:55.240 --> 1:40:57.240]  on one side, and they're fighting
[1:40:57.240 --> 1:40:59.240]  against this group over here, and they war
[1:40:59.240 --> 1:41:01.240]  amongst themselves, and we get to sit on the sidelines
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:03.240]  and watch it. So the bottom line is
[1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:05.240]  my read of the situation
[1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:07.240]  was that the groups that Webster
[1:41:07.240 --> 1:41:09.240]  is talking about really did pin their
[1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:11.240]  initial hopes on Hillary Clinton
[1:41:11.240 --> 1:41:13.240]  because she was a woman, she was going to carry
[1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:15.240]  the women's vote, and we saw
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:17.240]  a lot of vote fraud during
[1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:19.240]  the Democratic primaries
[1:41:19.240 --> 1:41:21.240]  that was favoring
[1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:23.240]  Hillary. So I think
[1:41:23.240 --> 1:41:25.240]  if you get into the realm of secret
[1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:27.240]  backers, I think they were leaning
[1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:29.240]  really more toward Hillary than Obama.
[1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:31.240]  But Obama pulled off an upset
[1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:33.240]  in the primaries, and at that point
[1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:35.240]  everybody started saying, well, let's
[1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:37.240]  get on his good side, let's buy his interest.
[1:41:37.240 --> 1:41:39.240]  Now that's not to say that Barack Obama
[1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:41.240]  is not owing a lot of favors to a lot
[1:41:41.240 --> 1:41:43.240]  of the same people that Bush did,
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:45.240]  Hillary did, and McCain does.
[1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:47.240]  But I don't think
[1:41:47.240 --> 1:41:49.240]  he was the number one choice
[1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:51.240]  of the people behind the
[1:41:51.240 --> 1:41:53.240]  scenes. And again, this gets
[1:41:53.240 --> 1:41:55.240]  back to the issue that once
[1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:57.240]  he's in office, he may very much
[1:41:57.240 --> 1:41:59.240]  turn out to be like John Kennedy.
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:01.240]  John Kennedy went into office owing
[1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:03.240]  a lot of favors. He owed a lot of favors
[1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:05.240]  to organized crime for Chicago.
[1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:07.240]  He owed a lot of favors to various other groups,
[1:42:07.240 --> 1:42:09.240]  and once he was in office, he said,
[1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:11.240]  okay, I don't have to really
[1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:13.240]  take care of them anymore. And he sicked
[1:42:13.240 --> 1:42:15.240]  his younger brother at the Justice Department
[1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:17.240]  against organized
[1:42:17.240 --> 1:42:19.240]  crime. He basically started
[1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:21.240]  saying, okay, I don't need the CIA anymore.
[1:42:21.240 --> 1:42:23.240]  And he really angered a lot of people,
[1:42:23.240 --> 1:42:25.240]  which unfortunately led to the tragedy in Dallas.
[1:42:25.240 --> 1:42:27.240]  But we don't see that
[1:42:27.240 --> 1:42:29.240]  coming out of Obama. He's talking about
[1:42:29.240 --> 1:42:31.240]  youth brigades, supporting groups
[1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:33.240]  in America, supporting
[1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:35.240]  this whole agenda. But
[1:42:35.240 --> 1:42:37.240]  Tarpley, what about his point that they did
[1:42:37.240 --> 1:42:39.240]  clearly in New Hampshire, and we had
[1:42:39.240 --> 1:42:41.240]  eyewitnesses there and people that were
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:43.240]  nonpartisan covering it. They did
[1:42:43.240 --> 1:42:45.240]  cheat Paul, and they did cheat
[1:42:45.240 --> 1:42:47.240]  Barack Obama. They tried to cheat him
[1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:49.240]  in New Hampshire.
[1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:51.240]  Vote fraud all the time by all sides,
[1:42:51.240 --> 1:42:53.240]  and the result of the election is a
[1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:55.240]  vector sum of vote fraud, as I said
[1:42:55.240 --> 1:42:57.240]  at the time. Today,
[1:42:57.240 --> 1:42:59.240]  the biggest vote fraud is in favor of Obama.
[1:42:59.240 --> 1:43:01.240]  The intelligence community is
[1:43:01.240 --> 1:43:03.240]  pro-Obama. The FBI and the CIA
[1:43:03.240 --> 1:43:05.240]  love Obama, and they will go
[1:43:05.240 --> 1:43:07.240]  on the line for Obama, because that is
[1:43:07.240 --> 1:43:09.240]  the order coming out of Wall Street.
[1:43:09.240 --> 1:43:11.240]  However, the idea that Obama
[1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:13.240]  is some kind of a free agent with free
[1:43:13.240 --> 1:43:15.240]  will, I think is tragically
[1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:17.240]  wrong. My finding is that
[1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:19.240]  Obama has been brainwashed,
[1:43:19.240 --> 1:43:21.240]  if you will. He has been
[1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:23.240]  fostered and prepared
[1:43:23.240 --> 1:43:25.240]  since his time at Columbia,
[1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:27.240]  1981 to 1983,
[1:43:27.240 --> 1:43:29.240]  which is likely when he was picked up by
[1:43:29.240 --> 1:43:31.240]  his big new bridge. Yeah, he's been under deep
[1:43:31.240 --> 1:43:33.240]  globalist tutelage. Absolutely.
[1:43:33.240 --> 1:43:35.240]  And probably when he met Bill Ayers
[1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:37.240]  and Bernardine Dorn, the weatherman
[1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:39.240]  terrorist bomber killer. Which again
[1:43:39.240 --> 1:43:41.240]  are foundation protected.
[1:43:41.240 --> 1:43:43.240]  Pardon me? Foundation
[1:43:43.240 --> 1:43:45.240]  creations. Yeah, these are funded
[1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:47.240]  operations of the foundations. If you look
[1:43:47.240 --> 1:43:49.240]  at Obama, everybody in his personal
[1:43:49.240 --> 1:43:51.240]  life is a provocateur of some kind.
[1:43:51.240 --> 1:43:53.240]  You've got the foundation-funded
[1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:55.240]  racist provocateurs, Jeremiah
[1:43:55.240 --> 1:43:57.240]  Wright and Flager and Meeks
[1:43:57.240 --> 1:43:59.240]  and Dwight Hopkins
[1:43:59.240 --> 1:44:01.240]  and Otis Moss at this so-called
[1:44:01.240 --> 1:44:03.240]  church. You've got criminal
[1:44:03.240 --> 1:44:05.240]  elements. Of course, you've got Resco,
[1:44:05.240 --> 1:44:07.240]  Archie and Al Samari in this
[1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:09.240]  stew of corruption that Obama
[1:44:09.240 --> 1:44:11.240]  has created. Yeah, but that's only his
[1:44:11.240 --> 1:44:13.240]  foundation left cover as well
[1:44:13.240 --> 1:44:15.240]  because of where he came from.
[1:44:15.240 --> 1:44:17.240]  Well, he's also then got the fact that the
[1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:19.240]  foundations are his family business. His mother
[1:44:19.240 --> 1:44:21.240]  worked for the Ford. He's from the
[1:44:21.240 --> 1:44:23.240]  Gamaliel, DeJoyce, the Woods and the
[1:44:23.240 --> 1:44:25.240]  Annenberg, above all, and his friend
[1:44:25.240 --> 1:44:27.240]  Bernardine Dorn gets- But let me ask you this
[1:44:27.240 --> 1:44:29.240]  and go back to Mike here.
[1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:31.240]  These guys with conscience. I mean, I mean,
[1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:33.240]  bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, I ran
[1:44:33.240 --> 1:44:35.240]  McCain stumbling around, paling
[1:44:35.240 --> 1:44:37.240]  the entire shoelaces. Which is
[1:44:37.240 --> 1:44:39.240]  the stronger imperialist? In other words,
[1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:41.240]  which is the more formidable imperialist
[1:44:41.240 --> 1:44:43.240]  enemy? In other words, you're going to be fighting
[1:44:43.240 --> 1:44:45.240]  out- No, I agree. They're going to be able
[1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:47.240]  to get a lot more through on Obama. 40
[1:44:47.240 --> 1:44:49.240]  plus percent of the country, it looks like,
[1:44:49.240 --> 1:44:51.240]  it's actually going to vote for him, and that's
[1:44:51.240 --> 1:44:53.240]  a total of 80 plus percent turnout.
[1:44:53.240 --> 1:44:55.240]  And then they're not ever going to want to admit
[1:44:55.240 --> 1:44:57.240]  they were wrong. Now, now, Mike,
[1:44:57.240 --> 1:44:59.240]  he's wrong. I mean, Mike has said he's going
[1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:01.240]  to come out against Obama. Mike?
[1:45:01.240 --> 1:45:03.240]  I'm sorry. Yeah,
[1:45:03.240 --> 1:45:05.240]  if once Obama is in the White House,
[1:45:05.240 --> 1:45:07.240]  he can't expect any favors from
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:09.240]  me, because, you know, I'm
[1:45:09.240 --> 1:45:11.240]  going to hold him right to the fire and say,
[1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:13.240]  okay, you're in there, you got to do what
[1:45:13.240 --> 1:45:15.240]  you promised you were going to do, and only what you
[1:45:15.240 --> 1:45:17.240]  promised you were going to do. Oh my god. He's already
[1:45:17.240 --> 1:45:19.240]  put a different promise than he's ever made.
[1:45:19.240 --> 1:45:21.240]  I'll be for the election. Now, I want
[1:45:21.240 --> 1:45:23.240]  to go back and talk
[1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:25.240]  about a couple of things. First of all, the
[1:45:25.240 --> 1:45:27.240]  vote fraud that is being reported,
[1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:29.240]  at least to my show and my website,
[1:45:29.240 --> 1:45:31.240]  and certainly on the media, is overwhelmingly
[1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:33.240]  going
[1:45:33.240 --> 1:45:35.240]  from the Democrats to the Republicans at this point.
[1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:37.240]  How about Acorn?
[1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:39.240]  Acorn,
[1:45:39.240 --> 1:45:41.240]  that has come and gone
[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:43.240]  as an issue. Now, I want to get back to this
[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:45.240]  other issue here about
[1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:47.240]  the, whether
[1:45:47.240 --> 1:45:49.240]  Obama is a puppet, or whether he'd be
[1:45:49.240 --> 1:45:51.240]  his own person like Kennedy was.
[1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:53.240]  If Obama wins with a
[1:45:53.240 --> 1:45:55.240]  significant landslide, he's going
[1:45:55.240 --> 1:45:57.240]  to look at that surplus of popular
[1:45:57.240 --> 1:45:59.240]  support and figure that he can
[1:45:59.240 --> 1:46:01.240]  take it out for a test drive, and
[1:46:01.240 --> 1:46:03.240]  that will give him the political
[1:46:03.240 --> 1:46:05.240]  strength to be able to go out and say, okay,
[1:46:05.240 --> 1:46:07.240]  let's renegotiate what the
[1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:09.240]  plan was going to be.
[1:46:09.240 --> 1:46:11.240]  And, you know, again, this is going back to
[1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:13.240]  what Kennedy did. Do you have any evidence
[1:46:13.240 --> 1:46:15.240]  of any such thing ever once in his entire life,
[1:46:15.240 --> 1:46:17.240]  or is he not a completely controlled
[1:46:17.240 --> 1:46:19.240]  puppet, 1,000% owned and controlled
[1:46:19.240 --> 1:46:21.240]  by these financiers?
[1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:23.240]  It's impossible to say at this point
[1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:25.240]  until he's in office.
[1:46:25.240 --> 1:46:27.240]  So you have no evidence whatsoever?
[1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:29.240]  That's the example of the
[1:46:29.240 --> 1:46:31.240]  establishment? Every
[1:46:31.240 --> 1:46:33.240]  time we put a new president
[1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:35.240]  in the office, we put him in on the basis
[1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:37.240]  of the promises that are given to us by the
[1:46:37.240 --> 1:46:39.240]  mainstream media, and then we have
[1:46:39.240 --> 1:46:41.240]  to see what they're actually going to do.
[1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:43.240]  Mr. Carpley,
[1:46:43.240 --> 1:46:45.240]  let him finish for one minute, and we'll
[1:46:45.240 --> 1:46:47.240]  go back to you for two minutes. Go ahead.
[1:46:47.240 --> 1:46:49.240]  Yeah, I don't cut you off, and please
[1:46:49.240 --> 1:46:51.240]  record me the same result.
[1:46:51.240 --> 1:46:53.240]  The bottom line is I agree
[1:46:53.240 --> 1:46:55.240]  when we elect a president
[1:46:55.240 --> 1:46:57.240]  we're not really going to know what they're going to
[1:46:57.240 --> 1:46:59.240]  do until they are in office.
[1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:01.240]  Sometimes it's a very unfortunate
[1:47:01.240 --> 1:47:03.240]  shock, as it was in the case of George Bush.
[1:47:03.240 --> 1:47:05.240]  Sometimes it's a pleasant surprise
[1:47:05.240 --> 1:47:07.240]  like it was with Kennedy. The bottom
[1:47:07.240 --> 1:47:09.240]  line is when they walk through that door of the
[1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:11.240]  Oval Office and realize for the first time
[1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:13.240]  it's theirs. It's going to have
[1:47:13.240 --> 1:47:15.240]  an effect on them.
[1:47:15.240 --> 1:47:17.240]  And, you know, with McCain
[1:47:17.240 --> 1:47:19.240]  the sense that I get is that he's perfectly
[1:47:19.240 --> 1:47:21.240]  happy with the world as it is right now.
[1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:23.240]  He voted along with George Bush,
[1:47:23.240 --> 1:47:25.240]  you know, 95% of the time
[1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:27.240]  with Barack Obama
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:29.240]  coming in from a less
[1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:31.240]  than traditional background in American politics.
[1:47:31.240 --> 1:47:33.240]  I think the possibility
[1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:35.240]  is definitely going to be there that he may
[1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:37.240]  just sit there and say, okay,
[1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:39.240]  we promised change, what can we
[1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:41.240]  change, and
[1:47:41.240 --> 1:47:43.240]  it's a very, okay, Webster's turn.
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:45.240]  This reproduces all of
[1:47:45.240 --> 1:47:47.240]  the pathetic illusions and delusions
[1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:49.240]  about the presidency that people have had.
[1:47:49.240 --> 1:47:51.240]  The U.S. presidency is a puppet position
[1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:53.240]  and if you don't want to be a puppet
[1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:55.240]  you've got to fight for it and you've got to have some
[1:47:55.240 --> 1:47:57.240]  track record. Obama is controllable.
[1:47:57.240 --> 1:47:59.240]  The Resco indictments,
[1:47:59.240 --> 1:48:01.240]  the Chicago
[1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:03.240]  Illinois bipartisan
[1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:05.240]  combine, mean that he can be put in jail
[1:48:05.240 --> 1:48:07.240]  within 72 hours at any time.
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:09.240]  He's also not born in the United States.
[1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:11.240]  He's born in Kenya, naturalized
[1:48:11.240 --> 1:48:13.240]  into Indonesia.
[1:48:13.240 --> 1:48:15.240]  He could be
[1:48:15.240 --> 1:48:17.240]  thrown out of the country and put
[1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:19.240]  in jail at any time.
[1:48:19.240 --> 1:48:21.240]  Therefore, the control mechanisms are clear.
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:23.240]  I think you're blinded by hatred
[1:48:23.240 --> 1:48:25.240]  of Hillary Clinton and you're so blinded
[1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:27.240]  by hatred of Bush and Cheney, which I can
[1:48:27.240 --> 1:48:29.240]  understand, that you're not able to see
[1:48:29.240 --> 1:48:31.240]  what Obama actually represents. It's like you
[1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:33.240]  have a desire to be duped.
[1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:35.240]  You're inventing stories that have
[1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:37.240]  absolutely no basis in evidence.
[1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:39.240]  In fact, we do know what Obama will do.
[1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:41.240]  We know exactly what he'll do because we can
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:43.240]  tell him about his body, his backers,
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:45.240]  his controllers, the people
[1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:47.240]  who make policy for him.
[1:48:47.240 --> 1:48:49.240]  We can tell what Richard Holbrook will do
[1:48:49.240 --> 1:48:51.240]  at the State Department, what Mark
[1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:53.240]  Brzezinski will do at the National Security
[1:48:53.240 --> 1:48:55.240]  Council, and so on down the line.
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:48:57.240]  Then there is this question of fascism.
[1:48:57.240 --> 1:48:59.240]  The Obama supporters, the Kool-Aid drinkers,
[1:48:59.240 --> 1:49:01.240]  the Lemmings, the cultists, and the personality
[1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:03.240]  freaks of the closest
[1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:05.240]  thing to an actual fascist mass
[1:49:05.240 --> 1:49:07.240]  movement we've ever had in the United States.
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:09.240]  They come with left cover. People
[1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:11.240]  understand fascism. They think it's top
[1:49:11.240 --> 1:49:13.240]  down. It's not top down. It's grassroots
[1:49:13.240 --> 1:49:15.240]  and bottom up.
[1:49:15.240 --> 1:49:17.240]  We had Schumer this morning saying
[1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:19.240]  talk radio is pornography.
[1:49:19.240 --> 1:49:21.240]  Pornography is regulated.
[1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:23.240]  We're going to regulate talk radio.
[1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:25.240]  That means they're going to come after-
[1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:27.240]  By the way, I saw that on the
[1:49:27.240 --> 1:49:29.240]  stair stepper. They're going to come
[1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:31.240]  and try to come after people like us.
[1:49:31.240 --> 1:49:33.240]  The situation of civil liberties under Obama
[1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:35.240]  will be dramatically worse.
[1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:37.240]  Okay, let's just stop there. Stop.
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:39.240]  After the break and try to be even here
[1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:41.240]  with the time, this is all very informative
[1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:43.240]  and thought provoking. Yeah, Mike,
[1:49:43.240 --> 1:49:45.240]  the Fairness Doctrine, it's on record
[1:49:45.240 --> 1:49:47.240]  they've got a whole nest of top
[1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:49.240]  Democrats saying they're coming after talk radio.
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:53.240]  I can imagine the issue
[1:49:53.240 --> 1:49:55.240]  is the Fairness Doctrine has not been
[1:49:55.240 --> 1:49:57.240]  enforced for quite a long time.
[1:49:57.240 --> 1:49:59.240]  I'm trying to remember
[1:49:59.240 --> 1:50:01.240]  when that was actually rescinded.
[1:50:01.240 --> 1:50:03.240]  I think we need to get the Fairness
[1:50:03.240 --> 1:50:05.240]  Doctrine back in. That's the reason
[1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:07.240]  why Rush Limbaugh
[1:50:07.240 --> 1:50:09.240]  and Michael Savage dominate the airway
[1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:11.240]  Mike, it's all selectively enforced.
[1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:13.240]  They don't allow anybody to have
[1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:15.240]  a real editorial
[1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:17.240]  program. It's all just got to be milk toes
[1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:19.240]  reporting what AP says.
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:21.240]  You understand
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:23.240]  this is targeted at us, bro.
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:25.240]  Well, I'm not
[1:50:25.240 --> 1:50:27.240]  feeling that. I mean, I think the Fairness Doctrine,
[1:50:27.240 --> 1:50:29.240]  if it went back in, would open up
[1:50:29.240 --> 1:50:31.240]  opportunities for the rest of us
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:35.240]  to stay there. Stay there. We got a break. Stay with us.
[1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:03.240]  Give for the health conscious person in your family

[1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:09.240]  is you. For a limited time, receive

[1:51:33.240 --> 1:51:35.240]  for the new year.
[1:51:35.240 --> 1:51:37.240]  On September 11th, 2001
[1:51:37.240 --> 1:51:39.240]  along with hundreds of my fellow troops
[1:51:39.240 --> 1:51:41.240]  I went to ground here
[1:51:41.240 --> 1:51:43.240]  and we knew what to do
[1:51:43.240 --> 1:51:45.240]  or at least we thought we did.
[1:51:45.240 --> 1:51:47.240]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11
[1:51:47.240 --> 1:51:49.240]  film that finally gives first responders
[1:51:49.240 --> 1:51:51.240]  a platform to tell their story.
[1:51:51.240 --> 1:51:53.240]  Whitman
[1:51:53.240 --> 1:51:55.240]  EVA director
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:57.240]  on the AG made a statement
[1:51:57.240 --> 1:51:59.240]  that the air
[1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:01.240]  was safe to breathe.
[1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:03.240]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11
[1:52:03.240 --> 1:52:05.240]  Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[1:52:05.240 --> 1:52:07.240]  take action against their global masters.
[1:52:07.240 --> 1:52:09.240]  He had his hand over the radio
[1:52:09.240 --> 1:52:11.240]  while he was getting the countdown.
[1:52:11.240 --> 1:52:13.240]  He takes his hand off in year 3, 2, 1
[1:52:13.240 --> 1:52:15.240]  and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:17.240]  This is an emergency
[1:52:17.240 --> 1:52:19.240]  transmission worldwide.

[1:52:33.240 --> 1:52:35.240]  and bring in martial law.
[1:52:35.240 --> 1:52:37.240]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[1:52:37.240 --> 1:52:39.240]  For the past several months
[1:52:39.240 --> 1:52:41.240]  folks have constantly asked me to give them the date
[1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:43.240]  as to when they should be finished
[1:52:43.240 --> 1:52:45.240]  stocking up on food.
[1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:47.240]  We've been so beaten up by stock market
[1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:49.240]  banking, housing and unemployment crashes
[1:52:49.240 --> 1:52:51.240]  that were desensitized and frozen and active
[1:52:51.240 --> 1:52:53.240]  like the frog being unknowingly cooked
[1:52:53.240 --> 1:52:55.240]  and gradually increasingly hot water.
[1:52:55.240 --> 1:52:57.240]  We'll snap out of it. We now have a deadline.
[1:52:57.240 --> 1:52:59.240]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[1:52:59.240 --> 1:53:01.240]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell
[1:53:01.240 --> 1:53:03.240]  went on CBS Meet the Press
[1:53:03.240 --> 1:53:05.240]  and pointed to about January 22
[1:53:05.240 --> 1:53:07.240]  as the time a major international incident
[1:53:07.240 --> 1:53:09.240]  would force the new president
[1:53:09.240 --> 1:53:11.240]  to make unpopular decisions.
[1:53:11.240 --> 1:53:13.240]  While I take the general at his word
[1:53:13.240 --> 1:53:15.240]  my best advice is to have your food
[1:53:15.240 --> 1:53:17.240]  in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[1:53:17.240 --> 1:53:19.240]  Contact eFoodsDirect.com
[1:53:19.240 --> 1:53:21.240]  for your supplies
[1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:23.240]  prior to this deadline for disaster.
[1:53:23.240 --> 1:53:25.240]  Ask yourself is it better to have too much too soon
[1:53:25.240 --> 1:53:27.240]  or too little too late?
[1:53:27.240 --> 1:53:29.240]  Call 800-409-5633
[1:53:29.240 --> 1:53:53.240]  or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:53:53.240 --> 1:53:59.240]  With the woman and the stallion and the wind
[1:53:59.240 --> 1:54:03.240]  and the sun is going to burn into a cinder
[1:54:03.240 --> 1:54:07.240]  and the sun is going to burn into a cinder
[1:54:07.240 --> 1:54:09.240]  before we ever pass this way again.
[1:54:09.240 --> 1:54:11.240]  Before we ever pass this way again.
[1:54:11.240 --> 1:54:13.240]  I was out on Willie Nelson's deck last week
[1:54:13.240 --> 1:54:15.240]  or we were going to have to go
[1:54:15.240 --> 1:54:17.240]  on a mountaintop overlooking Central Texas
[1:54:17.240 --> 1:54:21.240]  and I looked at him and I said that line to him
[1:54:21.240 --> 1:54:23.240]  and he had these seashells
[1:54:23.240 --> 1:54:25.240]  in the walls of his log cabin.
[1:54:25.240 --> 1:54:29.240]  Seashells dug up from the limestone
[1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:31.240]  and I said seashells from right here
[1:54:31.240 --> 1:54:33.240]  and he said yeah.
[1:54:33.240 --> 1:54:35.240]  I said from 15 million years ago
[1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:37.240]  when this mountain you live on
[1:54:37.240 --> 1:54:39.240]  was a coral reef in a shallow sea
[1:54:39.240 --> 1:54:41.240]  and that was quite a moment
[1:54:41.240 --> 1:54:43.240]  talking about the sun will burn into a cinder
[1:54:43.240 --> 1:54:45.240]  and maybe I should tell more of that story
[1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:47.240]  some other time.
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:49.240]  It was a very long time
[1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:51.240]  with both our guests.
[1:54:51.240 --> 1:54:53.240]  We just ended up, I believe
[1:54:53.240 --> 1:54:55.240]  at the end of the last segment
[1:54:55.240 --> 1:54:57.240]  with Tarpley talking
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:54:59.240]  when we're going to keep Tarpley a little bit
[1:54:59.240 --> 1:55:01.240]  Mike has to leave
[1:55:01.240 --> 1:55:03.240]  so don't accuse me folks of cutting him short.
[1:55:03.240 --> 1:55:05.240]  He has to leave here.
[1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:07.240]  I'm going to keep Tarpley about 10-15 minutes
[1:55:07.240 --> 1:55:09.240]  the next hour, the next Kaiser.
[1:55:09.240 --> 1:55:11.240]  Mike, closing two-minute comment here
[1:55:11.240 --> 1:55:13.240]  before we go back to Tarpley.
[1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:15.240]  Well, I just want to go back
[1:55:15.240 --> 1:55:17.240]  and remind everybody that there's been a lot
[1:55:17.240 --> 1:55:19.240]  of controversy in this campaign
[1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:21.240]  and the one that I can personally deal with
[1:55:21.240 --> 1:55:23.240]  is this idea that Barack Obama
[1:55:23.240 --> 1:55:25.240]  was not born in Hawaii.
[1:55:25.240 --> 1:55:27.240]  Now about a week ago, a week and a half ago
[1:55:27.240 --> 1:55:29.240]  WorldNet Daily ran a story by Jerome Corsi
[1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:31.240]  that said the governor of Hawaii had
[1:55:31.240 --> 1:55:33.240]  sealed Obama's birth certificate
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:35.240]  to prevent anybody from looking at it.
[1:55:35.240 --> 1:55:37.240]  Now I live here in Hawaii.
[1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:39.240]  I know Governor Linda Lingle who by the way
[1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:41.240]  is a Republican, not a Democrat
[1:55:41.240 --> 1:55:43.240]  not likely to be covering anything up
[1:55:43.240 --> 1:55:45.240]  and she basically her office issued a statement
[1:55:45.240 --> 1:55:47.240]  that Jerome Corsi article was completely fraudulent.
[1:55:47.240 --> 1:55:49.240]  She did not seal Barack Obama's
[1:55:49.240 --> 1:55:51.240]  birth certificate.
[1:55:51.240 --> 1:55:53.240]  All birth certificates are confidential
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:55.240]  because of the problem of identity theft
[1:55:55.240 --> 1:55:57.240]  but she set it up so that any media
[1:55:57.240 --> 1:55:59.240]  that want to contact a state official
[1:55:59.240 --> 1:56:01.240]  I forget which one she designated
[1:56:01.240 --> 1:56:03.240]  will confirm the birth certificate for them
[1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:05.240]  in terms of the content in there.
[1:56:05.240 --> 1:56:07.240]  We found the birth announcement
[1:56:07.240 --> 1:56:09.240]  in both Honolulu newspaper archives.
[1:56:09.240 --> 1:56:11.240]  We've located a witness who saw the family there
[1:56:11.240 --> 1:56:13.240]  at the hospital at the correct time.
[1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:15.240]  We know has been an absolute
[1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:17.240]  complete fraud.
[1:56:17.240 --> 1:56:19.240]  Does it really make sense that the Democratic National Committee
[1:56:19.240 --> 1:56:21.240]  would let Barack Obama
[1:56:21.240 --> 1:56:23.240]  get into the presidential
[1:56:23.240 --> 1:56:25.240]  contest at all without
[1:56:25.240 --> 1:56:27.240]  checking the bottom?
[1:56:27.240 --> 1:56:29.240]  Briefly, Tarpley, you say it's true
[1:56:29.240 --> 1:56:31.240]  he was born in Kenya.
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:33.240]  To me it's a bit nebulous.
[1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:35.240]  They do have his grandmother saying he was born there.
[1:56:35.240 --> 1:56:37.240]  The birth certificate, if I am Obama
[1:56:37.240 --> 1:56:39.240]  I am asking to get my hands on the
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:41.240]  thermonuclear button.
[1:56:41.240 --> 1:56:43.240]  In 1976 was a catastrophe
[1:56:43.240 --> 1:56:45.240]  and now we've got Barkey who
[1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:47.240]  and we don't even know where he comes from
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:49.240]  if Obama had any regard
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:51.240]  a scintilla of respect
[1:56:51.240 --> 1:56:53.240]  for the American people he would say
[1:56:53.240 --> 1:56:55.240]  American people here is the
[1:56:55.240 --> 1:56:57.240]  full detailed vault copy
[1:56:57.240 --> 1:56:59.240]  in other words the answer to all of this is
[1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:01.240]  where is his birth certificate?
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:03.240]  He doesn't publish it.
[1:57:03.240 --> 1:57:05.240]  He doesn't have it.
[1:57:05.240 --> 1:57:07.240]  He's allowed.
[1:57:07.240 --> 1:57:09.240]  Let's end the show with Mike.
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:11.240]  You've got the last minute.
[1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:13.240]  It's been on the web for weeks.
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:15.240]  The people who are trying to
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:17.240]  They keep saying it's a fake.
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:19.240]  It's a fake.
[1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:21.240]  It's a return to the Napoleonic Code.
[1:57:21.240 --> 1:57:23.240]  They keep saying the birth certificate
[1:57:23.240 --> 1:57:25.240]  he's provided is a fake.
[1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:27.240]  He has to prove that he didn't fake it.
[1:57:27.240 --> 1:57:29.240]  That's the Napoleonic Code.
[1:57:29.240 --> 1:57:31.240]  If you want to be president
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:33.240]  you want to get your hands on the
[1:57:33.240 --> 1:57:35.240]  You're going to have time in a minute.
[1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:37.240]  Mike, finish up.
[1:57:37.240 --> 1:57:39.240]  Okay, basically
[1:57:39.240 --> 1:57:41.240]  Barack Obama has provided his birth certificate
[1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:43.240]  this is a non-issue
[1:57:43.240 --> 1:57:45.240]  by a campaign that doesn't want to talk about
[1:57:45.240 --> 1:57:47.240]  the wars doesn't want to talk about the
[1:57:47.240 --> 1:57:49.240]  economy and I think what has really
[1:57:49.240 --> 1:57:51.240]  turned off most voters in the United States
[1:57:51.240 --> 1:57:53.240]  it's not that they're voting for Obama
[1:57:53.240 --> 1:57:55.240]  they're just sick of politics as usual
[1:57:55.240 --> 1:57:57.240]  they're sick of swift voting they're sick of Carl
[1:57:57.240 --> 1:57:59.240]  Rove style campaigning
[1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:01.240]  and it's turned them off.
[1:58:01.240 --> 1:58:03.240]  It's certainly a rejection of the neocons
[1:58:03.240 --> 1:58:05.240]  and the stage chair and the rest of it
[1:58:05.240 --> 1:58:07.240]  we'll just see what happens with this new bunch
[1:58:07.240 --> 1:58:09.240]  and we'll be there together.
[1:58:09.240 --> 1:58:11.240]  Mike Rivera, whatreallyhappened.com
[1:58:11.240 --> 1:58:13.240]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[1:58:13.240 --> 1:58:15.240]  My website's infowars.com
[1:58:15.240 --> 1:58:17.240]  Back in one minute.
[1:58:17.240 --> 1:58:19.240]  You are listening to GCN.
[1:58:19.240 --> 1:58:25.240]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:25.240 --> 1:58:27.240]  A day unlike any other
[1:58:27.240 --> 1:58:29.240]  in the long course of American history
[1:58:29.240 --> 1:58:31.240]  a terrorist act of war
[1:58:31.240 --> 1:58:33.240]  against this country.
[1:58:33.240 --> 1:58:35.240]  It's dark America on September 11th
[1:58:35.240 --> 1:58:37.240]  but who is the enemy?
[1:58:37.240 --> 1:58:39.240]  bin Laden. This is his M.O.
[1:58:39.240 --> 1:58:41.240]  We have to look to the Middle East
[1:58:41.240 --> 1:58:43.240]  we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:58:43.240 --> 1:58:45.240]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:58:45.240 --> 1:58:47.240]  to take a close look at the terrorist
[1:58:47.240 --> 1:58:49.240]  ties to intelligence networks
[1:58:49.240 --> 1:58:51.240]  inside the United States.
[1:58:51.240 --> 1:58:53.240]  Some U.S. investigators believe that
[1:58:53.240 --> 1:58:55.240]  there are Israelis again very much
[1:58:55.240 --> 1:58:57.240]  engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:58:57.240 --> 1:58:59.240]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[1:58:59.240 --> 1:59:01.240]  have been detained.
[1:59:01.240 --> 1:59:03.240]  The CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI
[1:59:03.240 --> 1:59:05.240]  the Saudi Arabian connection
[1:59:05.240 --> 1:59:07.240]  the Israeli intelligence network
[1:59:07.240 --> 1:59:09.240]  warnings in war games, the shadow government
[1:59:09.240 --> 1:59:11.240]  and much much more. Fabled enemies
[1:59:11.240 --> 1:59:13.240]  get the DVD at infowars.com
[1:59:13.240 --> 1:59:15.240]  or see it in super high quality

[1:59:17.240 --> 1:59:19.240]  at prisonplanet.tv
[1:59:19.240 --> 1:59:21.240]  Either you are with us
[1:59:21.240 --> 1:59:31.240]  or you are with the terrorists.
[1:59:52.240 --> 1:59:54.240]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[1:59:54.240 --> 1:59:56.240]  Alex Jones
[2:00:03.240 --> 2:00:05.240]  Max Kaiser joining us from Paris
[2:00:05.240 --> 2:00:07.240]  coming up in about 15 minutes
[2:00:07.240 --> 2:00:09.240]  Webster Tarbley is our guest
[2:00:09.240 --> 2:00:11.240]  Webster
[2:00:11.240 --> 2:00:13.240]  I like Mike and I've tried to build him up
[2:00:13.240 --> 2:00:15.240]  and tried to, you know, we got him a show here on Genesis
[2:00:15.240 --> 2:00:17.240]  this is I invited you over here
[2:00:17.240 --> 2:00:19.240]  a long time ago but the point is
[2:00:19.240 --> 2:00:21.240]  that
[2:00:21.240 --> 2:00:23.240]  it scares me that he's giving
[2:00:23.240 --> 2:00:25.240]  Barack Obama so much of a benefit of the doubt
[2:00:25.240 --> 2:00:27.240]  when clearly
[2:00:27.240 --> 2:00:29.240]  they're saying they're going to stage some big event for him
[2:00:29.240 --> 2:00:31.240]  he's going to do things that are unpopular with the Democrats
[2:00:31.240 --> 2:00:33.240]  he's talking about cutting teacher pay
[2:00:33.240 --> 2:00:35.240]  my point is he isn't, you know, the mainline liberal
[2:00:35.240 --> 2:00:37.240]  he claims he is, he's saying
[2:00:37.240 --> 2:00:39.240]  bigger corporate bailouts
[2:00:39.240 --> 2:00:41.240]  I mean McCain was for actually bailing out
[2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:43.240]  Ford and GM
[2:00:43.240 --> 2:00:45.240]  he is against it just like Bush is
[2:00:45.240 --> 2:00:47.240]  Barack Obama is
[2:00:47.240 --> 2:00:49.240]  out of the money going to the American people
[2:00:49.240 --> 2:00:51.240]  he has four times the
[2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:53.240]  Goldman Sachs money, three times the Wall Street
[2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:55.240]  and
[2:00:55.240 --> 2:00:57.240]  when I bring that up to Mike
[2:00:57.240 --> 2:00:59.240]  Mike just based
[2:00:59.240 --> 2:01:01.240]  I've heard him on his own show saying that
[2:01:01.240 --> 2:01:03.240]  McCain's gotten more money and today he had to admit
[2:01:03.240 --> 2:01:05.240]  that wasn't the case, I mean, this is an example
[2:01:05.240 --> 2:01:07.240]  of people
[2:01:07.240 --> 2:01:09.240]  hating George Bush for eight years
[2:01:09.240 --> 2:01:11.240]  and then not understanding
[2:01:11.240 --> 2:01:13.240]  that at a primitive level
[2:01:13.240 --> 2:01:15.240]  they're just being manipulated
[2:01:15.240 --> 2:01:17.240]  here and like you said, Obama is a complete puppet
[2:01:19.240 --> 2:01:21.240]  I think it's partly being blinded by hatred
[2:01:21.240 --> 2:01:23.240]  hatred of Bush, Cheney and the Neocons
[2:01:23.240 --> 2:01:25.240]  and again, this is all understandable
[2:01:25.240 --> 2:01:27.240]  but it's never good to be blinded by hatred
[2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:29.240]  Christianity actually has a good
[2:01:29.240 --> 2:01:31.240]  point on these things
[2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:33.240]  the other thing would be hatred of Hillary Clinton
[2:01:33.240 --> 2:01:35.240]  which also he seems to think
[2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:37.240]  we're back in the primaries and not
[2:01:37.240 --> 2:01:39.240]  not in the general election
[2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:41.240]  I tend to agree with him that she was the anointed one
[2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:43.240]  she's the one Limbaugh tried to get elected
[2:01:43.240 --> 2:01:45.240]  the one River Murdoch gave money to
[2:01:45.240 --> 2:01:47.240]  they did want to have Hillary in there
[2:01:47.240 --> 2:01:49.240]  look at the mainline trilateral
[2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:51.240]  Bilderberger ran corporation
[2:01:51.240 --> 2:01:53.240]  Rockefeller Soros
[2:01:53.240 --> 2:01:55.240]  that was Obama the entire time
[2:01:55.240 --> 2:01:57.240]  naturally they have to bet on several horses
[2:01:57.240 --> 2:01:59.240]  because there is this problem of getting
[2:01:59.240 --> 2:02:01.240]  through the primaries and so forth
[2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:03.240]  it does scare me as I'm getting threats and things
[2:02:03.240 --> 2:02:05.240]  and people saying I'm a racist
[2:02:05.240 --> 2:02:07.240]  because I don't like Obama
[2:02:07.240 --> 2:02:09.240]  and that has nothing to do with it
[2:02:09.240 --> 2:02:11.240]  I mean I post the video of his youth brigades
[2:02:11.240 --> 2:02:13.240]  and
[2:02:13.240 --> 2:02:15.240]  people call up saying what's wrong with youth brigades
[2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:17.240]  and then you heard Mike what's wrong with
[2:02:17.240 --> 2:02:19.240]  the fairness doctrine
[2:02:19.240 --> 2:02:21.240]  where you can't have any political editorial
[2:02:21.240 --> 2:02:23.240]  comments on any radio I mean
[2:02:23.240 --> 2:02:25.240]  I found that astounding look there are two things
[2:02:25.240 --> 2:02:27.240]  working the arguments
[2:02:27.240 --> 2:02:29.240]  about the Obama
[2:02:29.240 --> 2:02:31.240]  birth certificate again the only thing I want to see
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:33.240]  is the full detailed vault copy
[2:02:33.240 --> 2:02:35.240]  of Obama's birth certificate until
[2:02:35.240 --> 2:02:37.240]  until I see that he is
[2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:39.240]  an illegal alien and Phil Burg
[2:02:39.240 --> 2:02:41.240]  is still waiting for his response
[2:02:41.240 --> 2:02:43.240]  from just I disagree
[2:02:43.240 --> 2:02:45.240]  with you that
[2:02:45.240 --> 2:02:47.240]  that
[2:02:47.240 --> 2:02:49.240]  that that's the biggest issue
[2:02:49.240 --> 2:02:51.240]  for me it's the carbon
[2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:53.240]  tax the eugenics there are many issues
[2:02:53.240 --> 2:02:55.240]  we could we would go through you know we need
[2:02:55.240 --> 2:02:57.240]  several hours to name all the issues and we can do them
[2:02:57.240 --> 2:02:59.240]  in priority order here's the question
[2:02:59.240 --> 2:03:01.240]  it's the annenberg
[2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:03.240]  fact check that is out there
[2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:05.240]  arguing that Obama has put this issue
[2:03:05.240 --> 2:03:07.240]  to rest now annenberg you work for him
[2:03:07.240 --> 2:03:09.240]  this is a foundation
[2:03:09.240 --> 2:03:11.240]  and that is that is what bill is worked
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:13.240]  for the the main power inside the annenberg
[2:03:13.240 --> 2:03:15.240]  is the terrorist bomber bill
[2:03:15.240 --> 2:03:17.240]  airs and again these weathermen
[2:03:17.240 --> 2:03:19.240]  don't go away so easily for me
[2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:21.240]  I saw them destroy sds
[2:03:21.240 --> 2:03:23.240]  I saw them destroy the student
[2:03:23.240 --> 2:03:25.240]  movement I saw them destroy the peace
[2:03:25.240 --> 2:03:27.240]  movement other foundation
[2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:29.240]  provocateurs destroyed the
[2:03:29.240 --> 2:03:31.240]  Martin Luther king movement after king and been
[2:03:31.240 --> 2:03:33.240]  assassinated these are records
[2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:35.240]  these are the grave diggers of any
[2:03:35.240 --> 2:03:37.240]  popular movement and if you put somebody
[2:03:37.240 --> 2:03:39.240]  like Obama into a position
[2:03:39.240 --> 2:03:41.240]  of leadership he will destroy
[2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:43.240]  any potential he's already destroyed
[2:03:43.240 --> 2:03:45.240]  the impeachment movement and the peace
[2:03:45.240 --> 2:03:47.240]  movement of Obama has already accomplished
[2:03:47.240 --> 2:03:49.240]  that so I want to say Alex
[2:03:49.240 --> 2:03:51.240]  I don't get money from any foundation
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:53.240]  I think it might be useful for people to make a
[2:03:53.240 --> 2:03:55.240]  formal declaration are you foundation
[2:03:55.240 --> 2:03:57.240]  funded because a lot of our left liberal
[2:03:57.240 --> 2:03:59.240]  friends right a lot of the people who write about
[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:01.240]  fascism right the various Naomi
[2:04:01.240 --> 2:04:03.240]  wolves and Naomi clients of the world
[2:04:03.240 --> 2:04:05.240]  these are people who I believe are
[2:04:05.240 --> 2:04:07.240]  funded by foundation certainly

[2:07:50.460 --> 2:08:05.460]  From Max Kaiser on international television will join us for an hour. We're going to have Beth Harris pop in briefly and then of course we're going to have pop in briefly. I mean I said I'd take phone calls. We'll definitely take your calls from Max Kaiser. I promise.
[2:08:05.460 --> 2:08:11.460]  I just got so many guests so much analysis that I will take your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231
[2:08:11.460 --> 2:08:17.460]  But I hope it's on the economy or the wars of the election and you know not on Chibacabra's or anything.
[2:08:17.460 --> 2:08:26.460]  Webster, I agree with you. I see the whole establishment behind behind Barack Obama. I see him announcing
[2:08:27.460 --> 2:08:41.460]  Total carbon taxes bankrupting our energy systems. Those are his words. He represents the club of Rome, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission. He's surrounded by insiders. He is slick.
[2:08:41.460 --> 2:08:52.460]  They use Bush as kind of their bad guy, their front guy, use the neocons as their birdcage liner. They're getting all the liberals ready for huge quote disappointments.
[2:08:52.460 --> 2:09:02.460]  He's saying massive increases in defense budget. So they're going to have the right wing supporting him and all the war mongering and the main line limousine left, the poverty pimp supporting him.
[2:09:02.460 --> 2:09:13.460]  Let's play this clip. This is the audio, not just it in the Chicago Tribune, but the audio. First time they were endorsed a Democrat by the way. See their establishment. They're Wall Street.
[2:09:13.460 --> 2:09:26.460]  They're the mercantile. They endorsed him. All the big boys. So let's go ahead and play this clip of the youth brigades and you read the fine print of this. You can read more into it.
[2:09:26.460 --> 2:09:33.460]  This is literally domestic spies in uniform spying on you. Here it is.
[2:09:33.460 --> 2:09:49.460]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[2:09:49.460 --> 2:10:00.460]  Now, let's stop right there. $1 trillion, $55 billion defense budget this year. It's actually bigger than that, but that's the supplemental in the main package.
[2:10:00.460 --> 2:10:11.460]  $1 trillion, $55 billion. Now, he said just as big, just as strong domestic. Well, that's what they've been setting up since continuity of government in 1984, even before that.
[2:10:11.460 --> 2:10:21.460]  And then the youth brigades as part of Secure Corps, part of AmeriCorps, and Neil McCain proposed similar things. The point is, is that folks, you're going to get changed.
[2:10:21.460 --> 2:10:32.460]  It's going to be hellish. And it wasn't Webster Tarpley who said this. It wasn't Phil Burke. It wasn't Alex Jones. I tried to stay out of this until I just couldn't ignore the facts anymore.
[2:10:32.460 --> 2:10:43.460]  It's amazing. And don't, don't think we're trying to get him to win today. I don't tarply hope so. Like, it doesn't matter. The point is, maybe we need total tyranny. Maybe this is the medicine all you idiot liberals need.
[2:10:43.460 --> 2:10:50.460]  We're going to suddenly love wiretaps and police state and torture. All the things he's going to continue in more wars, not less.
[2:10:50.460 --> 2:10:57.460]  They're just going to depoliticize it and not make it left, right anymore in the world, just be forgotten about. That's what they said they're going to do.
[2:10:57.460 --> 2:11:04.460]  But this is true fascism that I see materializing as Webster saw before I did.
[2:11:04.460 --> 2:11:10.460]  And it's coming in the form of a black man. He isn't going to run a single thing. He's going to be the titular head, the figurehead.
[2:11:10.460 --> 2:11:21.460]  Webster, I can rant about this all day, the own people on my own info wars.com. In the stories we post about him calling for this giant, and if you read more, it's a youth brigade.
[2:11:21.460 --> 2:11:27.460]  They're on their sink. So what? What's wrong with that? What's wrong with the fairness doctrine? What's wrong with having spies everywhere?
[2:11:27.460 --> 2:11:39.460]  I mean, my God! People are so sold out to Hating Bush, just like they were sold out to Hating Clinton. They supported Bush. Now it's the same psychology, but worse tarply.
[2:11:39.460 --> 2:11:57.460]  Now, paid bloggers from Bangalore, India, and the Gaza Strip, their third world sweatshop bloggers that Obama has hired to send in. Now, obviously one of the things that fascism does is it says that the one party state is going to control everything.
[2:11:57.460 --> 2:12:11.460]  The political party, the trade union, the women's group, the sports club, the bowling league, all of this has to be brought under the national fascist party. And then you have a youth organization, Mussolini had one called Balila.
[2:12:11.460 --> 2:12:20.460]  Of course, the Squadristi, right, was how he got into power. Hitler had the Sturma Heilungen. He had this other organization, Hayat, Hitler Jugend.
[2:12:20.460 --> 2:12:34.460]  We're going to see if Naomi Wolfe and others suddenly don't like the police state when Obama gets in. Because they're all saying, martial law under Bush, no, no, no. Martial law through the continuum of the military industrial complex system.
[2:12:34.460 --> 2:12:53.460]  I would say it's fascism through a gutter movement of hooligans, thugs, fervently idealistic students, and hysterical crazed left liberals. And the way out of it is defeat Obama today, defeat anybody who voted for that bailout, come out of this with divided government.
[2:12:53.460 --> 2:13:12.460]  You have two gangs. One is more powerful than more dangerous than the other. The only hope is to play one gang against the other, institutionalize that for four years, and try to get a breathing space to work out an actual programmatic alternative, which in my view is going to have to be new deal measures to crush Wall Street and bring on an economic recovery.
[2:13:12.460 --> 2:13:24.460]  There isn't going to happen. Their Messiah, they're calling him President of the World in Newsweek. The Messiah, the leader, Jesus, they're calling him Moses.
[2:13:24.460 --> 2:13:43.460]  I'll tell you why I know he's going to win and why I know he's the establishment man. Fox News for two days when I watch him on the treadmill, on the stair step in the garage, keeps saying, well, I guess Palin's going to be back home now. She's going to be happy. Well, you know, he's going to lose. And they have Rove coming out saying he's going to lose.
[2:13:43.460 --> 2:13:56.460]  They have McCain. They have all these other strategists. You know, the focus group people have been caught staging him, saying no way McCain can win. And then so, so I see the neocons even supporting Obama.
[2:13:56.460 --> 2:14:01.460]  Of course, they're a bunch of unemployed adventurers and they're trying to attach themselves to Obama for jobs and careers.
[2:14:01.460 --> 2:14:04.460]  But how can the left not see that?
[2:14:04.460 --> 2:14:18.460]  Because of what I said before, the joining a fascist mass movement fulfills immediate emotional needs which these individuals have. They feel that they're alienated. They feel that they're isolated.
[2:14:18.460 --> 2:14:29.460]  And they feel that by becoming a part of the mystical body of the nation and partaking of the mystical authority of this charismatic leader, that they can somehow become whole.
[2:14:29.460 --> 2:14:39.460]  That's what gives the government the springtime was we have broken souls and it is the Messiah Obama who can touch our broken souls and make us whole again.
[2:14:39.460 --> 2:14:41.460]  In other words, we can overcome alienation.
[2:14:41.460 --> 2:14:49.460]  Now, this is right out of mind comp. There's an entire likely a chapter in mind comp that talks precisely about this.
[2:14:49.460 --> 2:14:51.460]  So nothing new under the sun.
[2:14:51.460 --> 2:15:03.460]  That's what Hitler did as he energized the grassroots. But Webster, you're absolutely right. I mean, even mainline news is implying he's world leader now and he's looting everything, stealing everything.
[2:15:03.460 --> 2:15:08.460]  But because he's the anti-bush, it's okay when he's really lockstep with all of it.
[2:15:08.460 --> 2:15:15.460]  Yeah, look, the idea that Bush is the worst that the world holds is a very, very superficial point of view.
[2:15:15.460 --> 2:15:23.460]  People should let their imaginations run wild a little bit and think about how things could get 10 times worse than Bush, 100 times worse than Bush.
[2:15:23.460 --> 2:15:39.460]  One is under Obama, Brzezinski, we go to confrontation with Russia and you get a topol MICBM Daniel Stack, which so far under Bush you have not had, and forced labor and hyperinflation and kinds of economic sacrifice with this cap and trade,
[2:15:39.460 --> 2:15:49.460]  idiocy, this global warming hoax, things that Bush and the neon kinds never dreamed of. Bush said, go to the shopping mall and buy things and support your country that way.
[2:15:49.460 --> 2:15:58.460]  The Obama's would say that was obscene, that was a scandal. They want austerity, sacrifice. They want to cut the standard of their living in half.
[2:15:58.460 --> 2:16:03.460]  Remember, you can't take the government where you want it, you can't have the car you want.
[2:16:03.460 --> 2:16:11.460]  They put the police state apparatus in under Bush, now they're bringing in the savior, and I feel so sorry for everybody because folks, it's going to get bad.
[2:16:11.460 --> 2:16:21.460]  I really feel sad for black folks that are trying to have some pride in this and I don't blame them, but they have no idea. This is a eugenicist, this is a evil, very, very, very wicked system.
[2:16:21.460 --> 2:16:26.460]  Webster, I want to get you back up tomorrow for about 30 minutes of the aftermath of all this.
[2:16:26.460 --> 2:16:28.460]  When is it good for you tomorrow?
[2:16:28.460 --> 2:16:33.460]  You tell me, at any time, like the same time as today, if you like.
[2:16:33.460 --> 2:16:42.460]  Let's just have you on at noon for 30 minutes tomorrow, and the anointed one's going to be put in one way or the other with the voting machines, and then that will cement to the left that the voting machines are supposedly legitimate.
[2:16:42.460 --> 2:16:49.460]  It's just on every front, this is it, this is New World Order trickery 101. Webster Tarpley, thanks for talking to us.
[2:16:49.460 --> 2:16:57.460]  I wouldn't count the American people out just yet, but remember, Obama the postmodern coup and Barack H. Obama the unauthorized biography at Amazon.com as well as at your store.
[2:16:57.460 --> 2:17:00.460]  I'll see you at the North Pole, Tarpley, when we're up here in a FEMA camp.
[2:17:00.460 --> 2:17:02.460]  North Pole Alaska, I've actually been there.
[2:17:02.460 --> 2:17:05.460]  Take care, pal.
[2:17:05.460 --> 2:17:08.460]  Oh man, unbelievable.
[2:17:08.460 --> 2:17:14.460]  I went through this four years, eight years ago with the Bush thing, all these Republicans, we thought you were good, we hate you now.
[2:17:14.460 --> 2:17:19.460]  Now the liberals, we thought you were a liberal. What's wrong?
[2:17:19.460 --> 2:17:21.460]  Oh, come on, folks.
[2:17:21.460 --> 2:17:24.460]  I mean, what is there not anything you won't buy?
[2:17:24.460 --> 2:17:30.460]  Let's go ahead and play Max Kaiser, part of it on international television. We'll come back to him after the break. Here it is.
[2:17:30.460 --> 2:17:35.460]  Well, joining me now on the phone is Max Kaiser, the journalist and broadcast, alive from Paris in France.
[2:17:35.460 --> 2:17:38.460]  Max Goldman and Morgan now subject to regulation.
[2:17:38.460 --> 2:17:45.460]  Isn't this what critics of their highly geared dealing have been demanding for years?
[2:17:45.460 --> 2:17:51.460]  I'm not so sure, Ashton. I think this is a great way for them now to hide any close examination of their books.
[2:17:51.460 --> 2:18:02.460]  I think this is actually in the cards from the beginning because, as you know, Morgan and JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have been involved in a tremendous amount of,
[2:18:02.460 --> 2:18:05.460]  let's call it, euphemistically, money laundering over the years.
[2:18:05.460 --> 2:18:14.460]  And now by becoming a commercial bank, I believe that this is going to insulate themselves from any real close examination because they're going to be behind the firewall,
[2:18:14.460 --> 2:18:16.460]  behind Hank Paulson's firewall.
[2:18:16.460 --> 2:18:22.460]  Hank Paulson has effectively hijacked the U.S. financial system. He's no different than the 9-11 hijackers, as far as I'm concerned.
[2:18:22.460 --> 2:18:33.460]  He's a financial terrorist and he's taken the U.S. banking system to the edge of the abyss all for the benefit of the shareholders and his cronies at Goldman and JP Morgan,
[2:18:33.460 --> 2:18:36.460]  the U.S. taxpayer, the U.S. citizen, unfortunately, is going to get the short end of the stick.
[2:18:36.460 --> 2:18:45.460]  But doesn't the new regulatory provision, because they will now be holding companies, mean that we can expect loads of SEC, U.S. Treasury officials all flying around the world
[2:18:45.460 --> 2:18:51.460]  to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs' offices checking all the records, interviewing the staff, checking on property?
[2:18:51.460 --> 2:19:01.460]  Yes, but at the same time as this coup d'etat has taken place and given Hank Paulson dictatorial powers to determine what is, in fact, the information that should be disclosed or not disclosed,
[2:19:01.460 --> 2:19:07.460]  combined that with Bush's dictatorial powers to declare the state of emergency at the drop of a hat.
[2:19:07.460 --> 2:19:11.460]  I don't think we're going to see any of this information is going to see the light of the day.
[2:19:11.460 --> 2:19:22.460]  It's just like, you remember, Building 7 on 9-11 is where they had all those Enron records and those Twin Towers collapsing was kind of a cover to keep those records from being examined.
[2:19:22.460 --> 2:19:26.460]  You know, these guys will stop at nothing to keep their dirty laundry a secret.
[2:19:26.460 --> 2:19:30.460]  Even all the auditing companies, all the auditing companies...
[2:19:30.460 --> 2:19:34.460]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with Max Kaiser himself.
[2:19:34.460 --> 2:19:39.460]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[2:19:39.460 --> 2:19:44.460]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[2:19:44.460 --> 2:19:49.460]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver,
[2:19:49.460 --> 2:19:55.460]  who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[2:19:55.460 --> 2:20:01.460]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level,
[2:20:01.460 --> 2:20:06.460]  and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[2:20:06.460 --> 2:20:11.460]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper,
[2:20:11.460 --> 2:20:14.460]  with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[2:20:14.460 --> 2:20:22.460]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[2:20:36.460 --> 2:20:43.460]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:20:43.460 --> 2:20:47.460]  The enemies start America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[2:20:47.460 --> 2:20:48.460]  Bin Laden.
[2:20:48.460 --> 2:20:49.460]  This is his MO.
[2:20:49.460 --> 2:20:52.460]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:20:52.460 --> 2:20:59.460]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:20:59.460 --> 2:21:06.460]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:21:06.460 --> 2:21:10.460]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:21:10.460 --> 2:21:17.460]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:21:17.460 --> 2:21:20.460]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.

[2:21:36.460 --> 2:22:04.460]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power
[2:22:04.460 --> 2:22:07.460]  and lend money to the United States government in interest.
[2:22:07.460 --> 2:22:10.460]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[2:22:10.460 --> 2:22:13.460]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[2:22:13.460 --> 2:22:16.460]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[2:22:16.460 --> 2:22:19.460]  Midas has the Kennedy v. Fed document.

[2:22:38.460 --> 2:22:39.460]  You wear your seatbelt.
[2:22:39.460 --> 2:22:42.460]  You do things to ensure your family's future and protection.
[2:22:42.460 --> 2:22:43.460]  But why?
[2:22:43.460 --> 2:22:44.460]  Just in case?
[2:22:44.460 --> 2:22:47.460]  With the current state of affairs, ask yourself, am I ready?

[2:23:54.460 --> 2:23:58.460]  He's a TV presenter, radio host, entrepreneur, broadcaster and journalist.

[2:24:03.460 --> 2:24:08.460]  He's also the host of a weekly radio show, The Truth About Markets.
[2:24:08.460 --> 2:24:13.460]  And he's been listening for the last hour while we've been attacking Lord Obama.
[2:24:13.460 --> 2:24:17.460]  And I was talking to him in the break. I said, let me guess what your whole view on this is.
[2:24:17.460 --> 2:24:22.460]  It doesn't matter. It's the big international banks running at all and presidents are basically puppets.
[2:24:22.460 --> 2:24:26.460]  But we'll get his specific take on that right now.
[2:24:26.460 --> 2:24:28.460]  Max Kaiser, thanks for coming on with us.
[2:24:28.460 --> 2:24:31.460]  Alex Jones. Nice to be here.
[2:24:31.460 --> 2:24:35.460]  You bet. We're going to be talking for the next hour and we're opening the phones up in 20 minutes, I promise.
[2:24:35.460 --> 2:24:43.460]  But Max, your whole take on this, I mean, you're against the bailout, the bank or takeover, Lord Obama's for it.
[2:24:43.460 --> 2:24:51.460]  Yeah, Alex. I mean, you know, before you get into the Obama thing, you know, let's look at the economy for a second.
[2:24:51.460 --> 2:24:56.460]  You know, since I was on your show last time, there's been some news events.
[2:24:56.460 --> 2:25:05.460]  You know, the thing about it in the U.S. is you have to understand that it's a different kind of a gulag than a gulag or used to.
[2:25:05.460 --> 2:25:10.460]  You know, when people think of gulag, they think Chinese gulag, they think forced labor.
[2:25:10.460 --> 2:25:15.460]  But the American gulag is forced consumption.
[2:25:15.460 --> 2:25:25.460]  70% of the economy is consumption. It's a forced consumption. It runs on people overindulging and it runs on cheap money.
[2:25:25.460 --> 2:25:34.460]  Now, this whole banking crisis that started a year and a half ago was the result of that cheap money spigot being cut off for a number of reasons.
[2:25:34.460 --> 2:25:44.460]  And we've had a period now of this so-called deflation, which is really just a hoax, if you will, a deflation hoax.
[2:25:44.460 --> 2:25:55.460]  And just as past few days, Alex, I don't know if you've seen this or not, but the inflation spigot is being turned on once again to fuel the consumption gulag in America.
[2:25:55.460 --> 2:26:03.460]  We've got something like 500 billion in new U.S. Treasury notes that have to be sold immediately to fund the deficit.
[2:26:03.460 --> 2:26:20.460]  So the hyperinflation that, you know, you were talking about 18 months ago when Peter Schiff was talking about and Jim Reider was talking about, you know, there was a break, there was a pause during this deflationary period when we saw oil collapse from 147 down to the $60 range.
[2:26:20.460 --> 2:26:27.460]  But now that's all going to reverse. And we're going to go back to this hyperinflationary scenario, which is horrible for the U.S. dollar.
[2:26:27.460 --> 2:26:37.460]  It's horrible for the American consumer. And lastly, you know, sign up to this casino gulag consumption state, as I'd like to think of it or refer to it as.
[2:26:37.460 --> 2:26:40.460]  So those are all those bets are back on the table.
[2:26:40.460 --> 2:26:49.460]  So going forward, just so your listeners keep that in mind, the idea of buying gold and silver to protect yourself, that's still very much in playing.
[2:26:49.460 --> 2:26:58.460]  And don't get fooled by this big deflation that we've seen in the last couple of months. And the reason for it has to do with the big geopolitical workings out there.
[2:26:58.460 --> 2:27:02.460]  You know, Russia invaded Georgia. Russia was getting too big for its boots.
[2:27:02.460 --> 2:27:09.460]  And they decided that, you know what, you might be making a lot of money, but we don't want Russia making much money or Venezuela making a lot of money.
[2:27:09.460 --> 2:27:14.460]  They took these markets down. They took these markets down in anticipation of trying to help the Republicans.
[2:27:14.460 --> 2:27:25.460]  Let's face it, the Republicans are supported in part by big oil. But now that the inflation and now that the election looks like it's finished, basically, today you saw oil spike.
[2:27:25.460 --> 2:27:34.460]  Seven dollars in a single day. That's an historic spike because they can't hold the, they can't keep the genie in the bottle anymore.
[2:27:34.460 --> 2:27:43.460]  The hyperinflation story is very much back in play. You haven't talked about it recently, Alex, because you had a fake rally in the dollar, but I think that's fake rally in the dollar is coming to a close.
[2:27:43.460 --> 2:27:56.460]  Yeah, that was other currencies falling. And then also not just manipulation, you had a lot of speculators dumping their stocks, dumping things liquidating so that they could cover their margins.
[2:27:56.460 --> 2:28:06.460]  That's another reason we saw some of the bubbles burst, but you're right. They've signaled only a total devaluation of the dollar. So how fast do you see the hyperinflation setting in?
[2:28:06.460 --> 2:28:15.460]  Well, it's going to happen with a big bang because they are, they're the big of the money supply numbers, M3, M2, M1, or MZM, which is money at zero maturity.
[2:28:15.460 --> 2:28:23.460]  These numbers in the last two weeks and three weeks have absolutely historically skyrocketed. So it doesn't take long for that to filter away into the general economy.
[2:28:23.460 --> 2:28:35.460]  And you know, the story that you've carried on your show with guys like Peter Schiff and others, and that's that primary story of the hyperinflation that was interrupted by, as you point out,
[2:28:35.460 --> 2:28:42.460]  the currencies were dumped and there was a, a spat of what's being called deflation. But that's, that's ridiculous.
[2:28:42.460 --> 2:28:48.460]  All that's going to happen is that all the bankers that got bailed out with your taxpayer money in America, they've got your money.
[2:28:48.460 --> 2:28:57.460]  Now they're going to buy gold. So you're going to be left with, without any gold because you were challenged, you were, you maybe had weak hands, maybe you sold some of your gold.
[2:28:57.460 --> 2:29:00.460]  And now who's going to be buying that gold at the cheaper price?
[2:29:00.460 --> 2:29:11.460]  Exactly. We have gold dropping while people can't buy it hardly anywhere. Talk about free market. This thing's totally rigged where people are grabbing it and snatching it up worldwide.
[2:29:11.460 --> 2:29:19.460]  You can't find it, but its price is plunging. Max Kaiser, let's talk about that with you when we get back. He's also a former Wall Street broker.
[2:29:19.460 --> 2:29:26.460]  I mean, this guy has just been involved in everything and we're really honored to have him with us. And your phone call, stay with me.
[2:29:26.460 --> 2:29:33.460]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:33.460 --> 2:29:44.460]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[2:29:44.460 --> 2:29:47.460]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[2:29:47.460 --> 2:29:54.460]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAFR?
[2:29:54.460 --> 2:30:03.460]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of just criticism to grow at our own door.
[2:30:03.460 --> 2:30:08.460]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:30:08.460 --> 2:30:13.460]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:30:13.460 --> 2:30:19.460]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:30:19.460 --> 2:30:28.460]  This whole hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.

[2:32:52.460 --> 2:33:01.460]  Here's Max Kaiser on international television talking about 9-11 and the financial dictatorship.
[2:33:01.460 --> 2:33:08.460]  Yes, but at the same time as this coup d'etat has taken place and given Hank Paul some dictatorial powers
[2:33:08.460 --> 2:33:12.460]  to determine what is in fact information that should be disclosed or not disclosed,
[2:33:12.460 --> 2:33:18.460]  combined that with Bush's dictatorial powers to declare the state of emergency at the drop of a hat.
[2:33:18.460 --> 2:33:20.460]  I don't think we're going to see any of this information.
[2:33:20.460 --> 2:33:22.460]  We're just going to see the light of day.
[2:33:22.460 --> 2:33:26.460]  It's just like, you remember, Building 7 on 9-11 is where they had all those Enron records
[2:33:26.460 --> 2:33:33.460]  and those Twin Towers collapsing was kind of a cover to keep those records from being examined.
[2:33:33.460 --> 2:33:37.460]  These guys will stop at nothing to keep their dirty laundry a secret.
[2:33:37.460 --> 2:33:48.460]  Even all the auditing companies, all the auditing companies that now these banks will have to be scrutinized by under federal law.
[2:33:48.460 --> 2:33:53.460]  To what auditing companies? The ones that have been discredited for the last 10 years
[2:33:53.460 --> 2:33:57.460]  and going out of business like Arthur Anderson who was auditing Enron, for example.
[2:33:57.460 --> 2:34:01.460]  The auditing companies, the rating agencies, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Bank.
[2:34:01.460 --> 2:34:04.460]  This is a criminal syndicate. This should be investigated under RICO.
[2:34:04.460 --> 2:34:07.460]  These guys are wholesale thieving of trillions of dollars.
[2:34:07.460 --> 2:34:13.460]  Alright, that's Max Kaiser. Max, let's get into what's really happening with the economy and Wall Street.
[2:34:13.460 --> 2:34:20.460]  The reason I bring up Obama is because he's certainly in their hip pocket. So, John McCain, do you see any changes in policies?
[2:34:20.460 --> 2:34:24.460]  Yeah, Alex, I'm going to have to ask you again.
[2:34:24.460 --> 2:34:29.460]  I mean, if we could just pick up on this thread for a second on the gold and silver market.
[2:34:29.460 --> 2:34:35.460]  Just as we went to break, you were talking about how the physical gold prices double with the paper gold prices.
[2:34:35.460 --> 2:34:39.460]  And the paper prices have been manipulated down by the so-called deflationistas.
[2:34:39.460 --> 2:34:46.460]  And you can't get gold and silver for anything less than 50, 60, and sometimes 100% premium.
[2:34:46.460 --> 2:34:48.460]  Now, this is what I hear is going to happen in December.
[2:34:48.460 --> 2:34:53.460]  My understanding, Alex, is that in December, the COMEX in New York is going to be busted.
[2:34:53.460 --> 2:34:57.460]  The COMEX in New York is short, gold and silver, beyond what they can deliver.
[2:34:57.460 --> 2:35:03.460]  Come December, there's going to be a raid on the COMEX for some very large international players.
[2:35:03.460 --> 2:35:05.460]  And as you know, we do a lot of international press, you know, all over the world.
[2:35:05.460 --> 2:35:10.460]  I'm hearing this from a lot of people around the world. They're going to do a raid on the COMEX
[2:35:10.460 --> 2:35:15.460]  and bust the COMEX and demand delivery of silver that they do not have at the COMEX.
[2:35:15.460 --> 2:35:19.460]  They've sold short bullion that they do not have.
[2:35:19.460 --> 2:35:24.460]  When that happens, when that story gets out, gold will double in a day.
[2:35:24.460 --> 2:35:26.460]  Gold will double in a day.
[2:35:26.460 --> 2:35:30.460]  If you don't have the gold now, it'll be too late because it'll be doubled in a day.
[2:35:30.460 --> 2:35:38.460]  And I'm hearing this in December. There's going to be a massive, and I'm hearing it might come from Russia
[2:35:38.460 --> 2:35:44.460]  because Russia is not happy with how this Bush administration has manipulated the price of oil
[2:35:44.460 --> 2:35:48.460]  down to the $60 level to help their buddy McCain.
[2:35:48.460 --> 2:35:51.460]  And they're hurting. Now they're saying, okay, what the hell with you?
[2:35:51.460 --> 2:35:55.460]  We're going to bust open the COMEX in December because we know they're short, silver and gold.
[2:35:55.460 --> 2:35:58.460]  They can't deliver. They've sold short more than they could possibly deliver.
[2:35:58.460 --> 2:36:00.460]  They're going to shut that market down.
[2:36:00.460 --> 2:36:03.460]  And that's going to be a massive dislocation of these markets.
[2:36:03.460 --> 2:36:06.460]  So again, I urge people, position yourself ahead of that.
[2:36:06.460 --> 2:36:08.460]  The dollar is absolute toast.
[2:36:08.460 --> 2:36:15.460]  Now, on that clip that you just played, you know, that whole Building Number 7,
[2:36:15.460 --> 2:36:18.460]  you know, the COMEX, Building Number 7, all that stuff down on Wall Street
[2:36:18.460 --> 2:36:22.460]  is completely corrupt to the bone, to the absolute core.
[2:36:22.460 --> 2:36:26.460]  You know, it's ironic about the whole thing, about the 9-11 event,
[2:36:26.460 --> 2:36:29.460]  is that I was talking to brokers two weeks before the event
[2:36:29.460 --> 2:36:32.460]  and they had heard the rumor of exploding airplanes
[2:36:32.460 --> 2:36:36.460]  and they were buying puts on airline companies.
[2:36:36.460 --> 2:36:39.460]  So you've got brokers who are actually working in the Twin Towers
[2:36:39.460 --> 2:36:42.460]  who are speculating on exploding airlines.
[2:36:42.460 --> 2:36:45.460]  I mean, that's what these bankers are all about.
[2:36:45.460 --> 2:36:46.460]  Max Kaiser, let me stop you.
[2:36:46.460 --> 2:36:47.460]  They don't speculate on their own demise.
[2:36:47.460 --> 2:36:49.460]  Max Kaiser, let me stop you right there.
[2:36:49.460 --> 2:36:50.460]  I mean, you're a prominent guy.
[2:36:50.460 --> 2:36:53.460]  You know, the International Television Show, International Radio Show,
[2:36:53.460 --> 2:36:56.460]  very popular website. You don't make stuff up.
[2:36:56.460 --> 2:36:57.460]  I've been following you for a long time.
[2:36:57.460 --> 2:37:00.460]  I know that you've always been very, very accurate in what you say.
[2:37:00.460 --> 2:37:03.460]  Specifically, you were on Wall Street.
[2:37:03.460 --> 2:37:06.460]  You were working where as much detail as you can
[2:37:06.460 --> 2:37:08.460]  because we have a lot of other mainstream reports
[2:37:08.460 --> 2:37:11.460]  where people on Wall Street were warned the towers were going to be blown up.
[2:37:11.460 --> 2:37:13.460]  There was going to be a disaster.
[2:37:13.460 --> 2:37:15.460]  There was a FEMA drill there the night before.
[2:37:15.460 --> 2:37:17.460]  You're just another one of these witnesses.
[2:37:17.460 --> 2:37:19.460]  Tell us specifically.
[2:37:19.460 --> 2:37:22.460]  The rumors are out there two weeks in advance
[2:37:22.460 --> 2:37:24.460]  and you see it in the trading pattern on the airlines.
[2:37:24.460 --> 2:37:25.460]  No, no, no, I understand.
[2:37:25.460 --> 2:37:27.460]  There were a lot of blood options against America and United.
[2:37:27.460 --> 2:37:30.460]  You specifically go back to where you were
[2:37:30.460 --> 2:37:32.460]  and what these people said to you.
[2:37:32.460 --> 2:37:34.460]  Well, if you look at those options,
[2:37:34.460 --> 2:37:37.460]  they were skyrocketing in a private volume.
[2:37:37.460 --> 2:37:39.460]  There was a boomer on the street
[2:37:39.460 --> 2:37:43.460]  and these options were taking as if the airplane had already blown up.
[2:37:43.460 --> 2:37:46.460]  So there was a rumor. How can that be?
[2:37:46.460 --> 2:37:48.460]  There's no airplanes that have blown up.
[2:37:48.460 --> 2:37:49.460]  Now, you do a little research
[2:37:49.460 --> 2:37:52.460]  and you find out that a lot of these contracts
[2:37:52.460 --> 2:37:56.460]  are going through the offices of Alex Brown
[2:37:56.460 --> 2:37:58.460]  down in Maryland in Maryland.
[2:37:58.460 --> 2:38:00.460]  Who was that Alex Brown in Maryland?
[2:38:00.460 --> 2:38:02.460]  Oh, a guy named Budgie Crongaard.
[2:38:02.460 --> 2:38:04.460]  Budgie Crongaard then moved over to CIA,
[2:38:04.460 --> 2:38:06.460]  worked with George Tennant.
[2:38:06.460 --> 2:38:08.460]  So now as a pipeline with the CIA,
[2:38:08.460 --> 2:38:10.460]  Alex Brown, where all these puts were traded
[2:38:10.460 --> 2:38:12.460]  two weeks before the event,
[2:38:12.460 --> 2:38:13.460]  and I used to work at Alex Brown.
[2:38:13.460 --> 2:38:14.460]  I worked there in 1990.
[2:38:14.460 --> 2:38:16.460]  I know, I met these guys.
[2:38:16.460 --> 2:38:18.460]  I was working on Wall Street at the time.
[2:38:18.460 --> 2:38:20.460]  Max Kaiser, not just the puts.
[2:38:20.460 --> 2:38:23.460]  Specifically, you're saying you were on Wall Street
[2:38:23.460 --> 2:38:25.460]  and you heard guys in offices going,
[2:38:25.460 --> 2:38:27.460]  yes, something about exploding airplanes.
[2:38:27.460 --> 2:38:29.460]  Let's put puts, not just on airlines,
[2:38:29.460 --> 2:38:31.460]  specifically on America and United.
[2:38:31.460 --> 2:38:33.460]  What did you hear?
[2:38:33.460 --> 2:38:35.460]  At the time, I was in Europe.
[2:38:35.460 --> 2:38:37.460]  I talked to brokers all day long.
[2:38:37.460 --> 2:38:39.460]  There was a rumor on the street
[2:38:39.460 --> 2:38:41.460]  that all the action that put options
[2:38:41.460 --> 2:38:43.460]  was getting people to sit down
[2:38:43.460 --> 2:38:44.460]  and they said,
[2:38:44.460 --> 2:38:49.460]  that all the action that put options was getting people to tension.
[2:38:49.460 --> 2:38:51.460]  And looking at it afterward,
[2:38:51.460 --> 2:38:54.460]  you see that all this action went through Alex Brown.
[2:38:54.460 --> 2:38:56.460]  Alex Brown is a stone throw from Washington.
[2:38:56.460 --> 2:38:59.460]  If you look, type up Budgie Crongaard on Google,
[2:38:59.460 --> 2:39:03.460]  and the story starts to come into focus.
[2:39:03.460 --> 2:39:06.460]  There was information out there two weeks in advance
[2:39:06.460 --> 2:39:08.460]  about a lot of...
[2:39:08.460 --> 2:39:10.460]  Look at the puts.
[2:39:10.460 --> 2:39:12.460]  I understand what you're saying specifically.
[2:39:12.460 --> 2:39:14.460]  Look at the action
[2:39:14.460 --> 2:39:16.460]  and the action and the puts themselves.
[2:39:16.460 --> 2:39:18.460]  We know about all that.
[2:39:18.460 --> 2:39:20.460]  The 9-11 report says,
[2:39:20.460 --> 2:39:22.460]  based on the puts,
[2:39:22.460 --> 2:39:24.460]  the volume in these puts,
[2:39:24.460 --> 2:39:26.460]  it suggests that there was insider trading.
[2:39:26.460 --> 2:39:28.460]  However, we are not going to pursue that
[2:39:28.460 --> 2:39:30.460]  in any great detail.
[2:39:30.460 --> 2:39:32.460]  Well, why not?
[2:39:32.460 --> 2:39:34.460]  It's a clear case of insider trading.
[2:39:34.460 --> 2:39:36.460]  When you see action, anytime there's a merger
[2:39:36.460 --> 2:39:38.460]  or insider trading, there's a huge spike
[2:39:38.460 --> 2:39:40.460]  in the volume of the puts.
[2:39:40.460 --> 2:39:42.460]  It's either the options or the stock.
[2:39:42.460 --> 2:39:44.460]  And that's investigated immediately
[2:39:44.460 --> 2:39:46.460]  because that's a tell-tale sign
[2:39:46.460 --> 2:39:48.460]  of insider trading.
[2:39:48.460 --> 2:39:50.460]  If you look at the action on those options,
[2:39:50.460 --> 2:39:52.460]  it's a tell-tale sign clearly
[2:39:52.460 --> 2:39:54.460]  of information above and beyond random information.
[2:39:54.460 --> 2:39:56.460]  I understand it was record put options.
[2:39:56.460 --> 2:39:58.460]  Record put options on American and United.
[2:39:58.460 --> 2:40:00.460]  We're very well versed.
[2:40:00.460 --> 2:40:02.460]  I put a film out six months after the attacks
[2:40:02.460 --> 2:40:04.460]  that covers that.
[2:40:04.460 --> 2:40:06.460]  I'm asking you as a financial analyst,
[2:40:06.460 --> 2:40:08.460]  as a financial consultant,
[2:40:08.460 --> 2:40:10.460]  as an expert, you yourself say,
[2:40:10.460 --> 2:40:12.460]  you remember asking,
[2:40:12.460 --> 2:40:14.460]  hey, why are there record puts on United American
[2:40:14.460 --> 2:40:16.460]  and your colleagues said something
[2:40:16.460 --> 2:40:18.460]  about blowing up airplanes?
[2:40:18.460 --> 2:40:20.460]  That was the rumor.
[2:40:20.460 --> 2:40:22.460]  That was the talk.
[2:40:22.460 --> 2:40:24.460]  It makes sense because you think about it.
[2:40:24.460 --> 2:40:26.460]  It's because they acted
[2:40:26.460 --> 2:40:28.460]  like you saw after an explosion.
[2:40:28.460 --> 2:40:30.460]  That's where the volume
[2:40:30.460 --> 2:40:32.460]  and the price action was after an explosion.
[2:40:32.460 --> 2:40:34.460]  So the comment you heard was,
[2:40:34.460 --> 2:40:36.460]  well, why would it happen
[2:40:36.460 --> 2:40:38.460]  like this now? There's no explosion.
[2:40:38.460 --> 2:40:40.460]  You see?
[2:40:40.460 --> 2:40:42.460]  People were asking that question, why now?
[2:40:42.460 --> 2:40:44.460]  And then you talk to brokers
[2:40:44.460 --> 2:40:46.460]  and they just be ridiculous and absurd
[2:40:46.460 --> 2:40:48.460]  thing is that you're talking
[2:40:48.460 --> 2:40:50.460]  to actual brokers on the street
[2:40:50.460 --> 2:40:52.460]  who were speculating
[2:40:52.460 --> 2:40:54.460]  on openly what became their own demise.
[2:40:54.460 --> 2:40:56.460]  Amazing.
[2:40:56.460 --> 2:40:58.460]  Okay, let's get back to gold.
[2:40:58.460 --> 2:41:00.460]  They're admittedly
[2:41:00.460 --> 2:41:02.460]  manipulating and suppressing it.
[2:41:02.460 --> 2:41:04.460]  Why are they so afraid of gold?
[2:41:04.460 --> 2:41:06.460]  Gold is
[2:41:06.460 --> 2:41:08.460]  the banker's
[2:41:08.460 --> 2:41:10.460]  worst enemy because
[2:41:10.460 --> 2:41:12.460]  gold represents
[2:41:12.460 --> 2:41:14.460]  real money and it's
[2:41:14.460 --> 2:41:16.460]  a limited supply and you can't
[2:41:16.460 --> 2:41:18.460]  run up huge multi-billion
[2:41:18.460 --> 2:41:20.460]  trillion-dollar debts
[2:41:20.460 --> 2:41:22.460]  like you can with a fiat money currency
[2:41:22.460 --> 2:41:24.460]  if you have a gold standard.
[2:41:24.460 --> 2:41:26.460]  It's a check and balance
[2:41:26.460 --> 2:41:28.460]  that would prevent the bankers
[2:41:28.460 --> 2:41:30.460]  in the world
[2:41:30.460 --> 2:41:32.460]  from engaging in what we've just seen
[2:41:32.460 --> 2:41:34.460]  over the past 20, 30 years.
[2:41:34.460 --> 2:41:36.460]  This huge Ponzi scheme
[2:41:36.460 --> 2:41:38.460]  based on fiat money and debt.
[2:41:38.460 --> 2:41:40.460]  Everyone has seen that money
[2:41:40.460 --> 2:41:42.460]  is debt. Everyone understands
[2:41:42.460 --> 2:41:44.460]  I think now that the Federal Reserve
[2:41:44.460 --> 2:41:46.460]  and Treasury they simply issued
[2:41:46.460 --> 2:41:48.460]  trillions of dollars worth of debt.
[2:41:48.460 --> 2:41:50.460]  It's not money in the sense that it has any value
[2:41:50.460 --> 2:41:52.460]  and this creates wage slaves
[2:41:52.460 --> 2:41:54.460]  or the casino consumer gulag
[2:41:54.460 --> 2:41:56.460]  state in America where people are
[2:41:56.460 --> 2:41:58.460]  wage
[2:41:58.460 --> 2:42:00.460]  and cheap money and right now
[2:42:00.460 --> 2:42:02.460]  the economy
[2:42:02.460 --> 2:42:04.460]  after being going through a heart attack
[2:42:04.460 --> 2:42:06.460]  because of the credit seizure from 18 months ago
[2:42:06.460 --> 2:42:08.460]  they have ramped up another
[2:42:08.460 --> 2:42:10.460]  half a trillion, trillion, two trillion, three trillion
[2:42:10.460 --> 2:42:12.460]  five trillion dollars with a fresh credit
[2:42:12.460 --> 2:42:14.460]  fresh debt
[2:42:14.460 --> 2:42:16.460]  and it's going to restart the consumers
[2:42:16.460 --> 2:42:18.460]  and they're going to be back buying their iPod
[2:42:18.460 --> 2:42:20.460]  and back buying their cheap food
[2:42:20.460 --> 2:42:22.460]  at cheap prices and they're going to get that
[2:42:22.460 --> 2:42:24.460]  consumer gulag casino state
[2:42:24.460 --> 2:42:26.460]  ramped up again and
[2:42:26.460 --> 2:42:28.460]  this is going to take the value of the dollar
[2:42:28.460 --> 2:42:30.460]  down as it was going down
[2:42:30.460 --> 2:42:32.460]  up until six months ago.
[2:42:32.460 --> 2:42:34.460]  The dollar index was sitting post World War II
[2:42:34.460 --> 2:42:36.460]  low, it got down to 70 on the index
[2:42:36.460 --> 2:42:38.460]  now it had this
[2:42:38.460 --> 2:42:40.460]  this rally, a bear market rally
[2:42:40.460 --> 2:42:42.460]  into the 85-86 range
[2:42:42.460 --> 2:42:44.460]  it's topping out now
[2:42:44.460 --> 2:42:46.460]  it's going to resume its downward trend
[2:42:46.460 --> 2:42:48.460]  breakthrough 70
[2:42:48.460 --> 2:42:50.460]  and it had a lot lower
[2:42:50.460 --> 2:42:52.460]  and you know I'm
[2:42:52.460 --> 2:42:54.460]  you've had a guy in your show, Peter Schiff
[2:42:54.460 --> 2:42:56.460]  he's an excellent analyst, he's an excellent writer
[2:42:56.460 --> 2:42:58.460]  and I would also
[2:42:58.460 --> 2:43:00.460]  point out that Peter Schiff has said something
[2:43:00.460 --> 2:43:02.460]  let's get into the Obama situation a little bit
[2:43:02.460 --> 2:43:04.460]  if I might
[2:43:04.460 --> 2:43:06.460]  go ahead, that's okay
[2:43:06.460 --> 2:43:08.460]  the Obama
[2:43:08.460 --> 2:43:10.460]  situation
[2:43:10.460 --> 2:43:12.460]  Obama coming on as president
[2:43:12.460 --> 2:43:14.460]  of the United States
[2:43:14.460 --> 2:43:16.460]  even guys like Peter Schiff who are fiscal conservatives
[2:43:16.460 --> 2:43:18.460]  I think is a fair statement
[2:43:18.460 --> 2:43:20.460]  he has suggested something
[2:43:20.460 --> 2:43:22.460]  and I want to bring it up with you
[2:43:22.460 --> 2:43:24.460]  and I agree with Peter Schiff on this
[2:43:24.460 --> 2:43:26.460]  you know, millions of Americans out there
[2:43:26.460 --> 2:43:28.460]  have been shafted by the bankers
[2:43:28.460 --> 2:43:30.460]  and they're sitting on negative equity in their homes
[2:43:30.460 --> 2:43:32.460]  right now there's a legislation in America
[2:43:32.460 --> 2:43:34.460]  to convert
[2:43:34.460 --> 2:43:36.460]  non-recourse mortgages
[2:43:36.460 --> 2:43:38.460]  into recourse mortgages
[2:43:38.460 --> 2:43:40.460]  in other words, instead of being able to walk away from your negative equity home
[2:43:40.460 --> 2:43:42.460]  after having this predatory loan forced on your throat
[2:43:42.460 --> 2:43:44.460]  by unscrupulous bankers
[2:43:44.460 --> 2:43:46.460]  you're not going to be able to walk away from that loan anymore
[2:43:46.460 --> 2:43:48.460]  because of a non-recourse loan
[2:43:48.460 --> 2:43:50.460]  it's going to be converted to a recourse loan
[2:43:50.460 --> 2:43:52.460]  which means you're going to be on the hook
[2:43:52.460 --> 2:43:54.460]  you're going to have your pay garnish
[2:43:54.460 --> 2:43:56.460]  you're going to be in debtor's prison
[2:43:56.460 --> 2:43:58.460]  you're going to have to face that mortgage debt
[2:43:58.460 --> 2:44:00.460]  head on
[2:44:00.460 --> 2:44:02.460]  what Peter Schiff is saying and I agree with him is
[2:44:02.460 --> 2:44:04.460]  people should just walk away from that debt anyway
[2:44:04.460 --> 2:44:06.460]  and stage a massive civil disobedience
[2:44:06.460 --> 2:44:08.460]  stage a massive civil disobedience
[2:44:08.460 --> 2:44:10.460]  let me just stop you Max Kaiser
[2:44:10.460 --> 2:44:12.460]  because you're great at breaking down the basics
[2:44:12.460 --> 2:44:14.460]  we have this international consortium
[2:44:14.460 --> 2:44:16.460]  of private banks and intergroup
[2:44:16.460 --> 2:44:18.460]  they terrorize the public
[2:44:18.460 --> 2:44:20.460]  and they threaten Congress with martial law
[2:44:20.460 --> 2:44:22.460]  for the executive
[2:44:22.460 --> 2:44:24.460]  that if they don't pass it
[2:44:24.460 --> 2:44:26.460]  they say we've got to have the money this week
[2:44:26.460 --> 2:44:28.460]  now a month later they haven't given any of it out
[2:44:28.460 --> 2:44:30.460]  to any troubled mortgage securities
[2:44:30.460 --> 2:44:32.460]  instead the banks are on record
[2:44:32.460 --> 2:44:34.460]  in the New York Times bragging
[2:44:34.460 --> 2:44:36.460]  we're keeping the money and giving each other bonuses
[2:44:36.460 --> 2:44:38.460]  tens of billions of bonuses
[2:44:38.460 --> 2:44:40.460]  at Goldman Sachs alone
[2:44:40.460 --> 2:44:42.460]  in each division in each country
[2:44:42.460 --> 2:44:44.460]  I mean just no transparency
[2:44:44.460 --> 2:44:46.460]  corruption like we've never
[2:44:46.460 --> 2:44:48.460]  seen before
[2:44:48.460 --> 2:44:50.460]  before
[2:44:50.460 --> 2:44:52.460]  and
[2:44:52.460 --> 2:44:54.460]  and then as you said
[2:44:54.460 --> 2:44:56.460]  they've changed the law so we can't declare bankruptcy
[2:44:56.460 --> 2:44:58.460]  they're moving to try to say
[2:44:58.460 --> 2:45:00.460]  we can't get out of mortgages and we can't even
[2:45:00.460 --> 2:45:02.460]  walk away
[2:45:02.460 --> 2:45:04.460]  I mean this is unbelievable
[2:45:04.460 --> 2:45:06.460]  I mean how much do they plan on squeezing us so
[2:45:06.460 --> 2:45:08.460]  give the listeners from your expertise
[2:45:08.460 --> 2:45:10.460]  the basic breakdown of what we're dealing with
[2:45:10.460 --> 2:45:12.460]  well
[2:45:12.460 --> 2:45:14.460]  you're dealing with
[2:45:14.460 --> 2:45:16.460]  did the banking establishment
[2:45:16.460 --> 2:45:18.460]  has
[2:45:18.460 --> 2:45:20.460]  really
[2:45:20.460 --> 2:45:22.460]  gotten full of itself beyond anything
[2:45:22.460 --> 2:45:24.460]  I think anyone could have possibly imagined
[2:45:24.460 --> 2:45:26.460]  even during the most excessive
[2:45:26.460 --> 2:45:28.460]  period even during the Mike Milken phase
[2:45:28.460 --> 2:45:30.460]  even during the corporate
[2:45:30.460 --> 2:45:32.460]  rater phases even during
[2:45:32.460 --> 2:45:34.460]  the greatest excesses of banking
[2:45:34.460 --> 2:45:36.460]  largesse
[2:45:36.460 --> 2:45:38.460]  the JP Morgan phase going back a century
[2:45:38.460 --> 2:45:40.460]  this is really the most unbelievable wealth
[2:45:40.460 --> 2:45:42.460]  confiscation by a small group of bankers
[2:45:42.460 --> 2:45:44.460]  on Wall Street that we probably
[2:45:44.460 --> 2:45:46.460]  ever seen in the American history
[2:45:46.460 --> 2:45:48.460]  and quite possibly you know look up
[2:45:48.460 --> 2:45:50.460]  I've looked through history in other countries
[2:45:50.460 --> 2:45:52.460]  in other periods this is this rank as one
[2:45:52.460 --> 2:45:54.460]  of the most unbelievably egregious
[2:45:54.460 --> 2:45:56.460]  wealth confiscations by
[2:45:56.460 --> 2:45:58.460]  confiscation by a small group of bankers
[2:45:58.460 --> 2:46:00.460]  really and they're just getting started
[2:46:00.460 --> 2:46:02.460]  well they have
[2:46:02.460 --> 2:46:04.460]  it's very difficult
[2:46:04.460 --> 2:46:06.460]  for America this is why this is my point
[2:46:06.460 --> 2:46:08.460]  with Obama and okay
[2:46:08.460 --> 2:46:10.460]  you know the the point is this
[2:46:10.460 --> 2:46:12.460]  American people no matter who
[2:46:12.460 --> 2:46:14.460]  is going to be president tomorrow morning
[2:46:14.460 --> 2:46:16.460]  it's still incumbent upon the American
[2:46:16.460 --> 2:46:18.460]  people to take action for themselves
[2:46:18.460 --> 2:46:20.460]  and I say you know they say Obama is going to
[2:46:20.460 --> 2:46:22.460]  be tested is it going to be a showdown
[2:46:22.460 --> 2:46:24.460]  with Iran is it going to be a showdown with this country
[2:46:24.460 --> 2:46:26.460]  the showdown for Obama is a showdown
[2:46:26.460 --> 2:46:28.460]  with the American people the American
[2:46:28.460 --> 2:46:30.460]  people still need to
[2:46:30.460 --> 2:46:32.460]  stand up and as people
[2:46:32.460 --> 2:46:34.460]  have suggested including shift I think
[2:46:34.460 --> 2:46:36.460]  this is a great campaign there should be
[2:46:36.460 --> 2:46:38.460]  mass civil disobedience mass
[2:46:38.460 --> 2:46:40.460]  walking away from these mortgages
[2:46:40.460 --> 2:46:42.460]  and sticking to the bankers
[2:46:42.460 --> 2:46:44.460]  say look we're not going to pay these bankers
[2:46:44.460 --> 2:46:46.460]  that's why they're putting Obama in as a
[2:46:46.460 --> 2:46:48.460]  puppet so that everybody
[2:46:48.460 --> 2:46:50.460]  thinks there's been change when the very same
[2:46:50.460 --> 2:46:52.460]  financial institutions that really run things
[2:46:52.460 --> 2:46:54.460]  are going to continue so for Obama
[2:46:54.460 --> 2:46:56.460]  lovers you need to realize he's a puppet
[2:46:56.460 --> 2:46:58.460]  just so your precious Obama doesn't get
[2:46:58.460 --> 2:47:00.460]  the blame I agree he's a puppet
[2:47:00.460 --> 2:47:02.460]  and he's not going to deserve the blame that's coming
[2:47:02.460 --> 2:47:04.460]  but Max I agree
[2:47:04.460 --> 2:47:06.460]  that the financial crisis is the biggest thing we face
[2:47:06.460 --> 2:47:08.460]  but what do you think Biden and Powell
[2:47:08.460 --> 2:47:10.460]  and all of them
[2:47:10.460 --> 2:47:12.460]  Brown, Merkel
[2:47:12.460 --> 2:47:14.460]  Barroso
[2:47:14.460 --> 2:47:16.460]  what is the crisis with them naming the date
[2:47:16.460 --> 2:47:18.460]  the 21st to 22nd
[2:47:18.460 --> 2:47:20.460]  Powell on Meet the Press it sounded like a
[2:47:20.460 --> 2:47:22.460]  financial crisis with all the others it sounds
[2:47:22.460 --> 2:47:24.460]  like a military crisis you've got your ear
[2:47:24.460 --> 2:47:26.460]  to the ground in a lot of high places
[2:47:26.460 --> 2:47:28.460]  what are you getting told
[2:47:28.460 --> 2:47:30.460]  I'm hearing about a
[2:47:30.460 --> 2:47:32.460]  currency devaluation
[2:47:32.460 --> 2:47:34.460]  the US dollar gets devalued
[2:47:34.460 --> 2:47:36.460]  the US dollar
[2:47:36.460 --> 2:47:38.460]  the US dollar gets devalued
[2:47:38.460 --> 2:47:40.460]  in one shot
[2:47:40.460 --> 2:47:42.460]  just like you saw in other South American
[2:47:42.460 --> 2:47:44.460]  Latin American countries
[2:47:44.460 --> 2:47:46.460]  and they've been holding out for the election
[2:47:46.460 --> 2:47:48.460]  which would show the establishment really was for McCain
[2:47:48.460 --> 2:47:50.460]  well
[2:47:50.460 --> 2:47:52.460]  you know
[2:47:52.460 --> 2:47:54.460]  that's one narrative
[2:47:54.460 --> 2:47:56.460]  you know I just look at the numbers
[2:47:56.460 --> 2:47:58.460]  and the numbers are that the US dollar
[2:47:58.460 --> 2:48:00.460]  can no longer function as a world reserve currency
[2:48:00.460 --> 2:48:02.460]  our creditors in America
[2:48:02.460 --> 2:48:04.460]  are demanding payment in their own currency
[2:48:04.460 --> 2:48:06.460]  Chinese Yuan
[2:48:06.460 --> 2:48:08.460]  Japanese Yen
[2:48:08.460 --> 2:48:10.460]  explain that to people
[2:48:10.460 --> 2:48:12.460]  explain that to the listeners because you're
[2:48:12.460 --> 2:48:14.460]  you're international you're in Paris right now
[2:48:14.460 --> 2:48:16.460]  you're covering all this
[2:48:16.460 --> 2:48:18.460]  the billions that the shareholders
[2:48:18.460 --> 2:48:20.460]  are getting and the billions that the CEOs are getting
[2:48:20.460 --> 2:48:22.460]  per company
[2:48:22.460 --> 2:48:24.460]  in the bailout money for themselves as bonuses
[2:48:24.460 --> 2:48:26.460]  they're converting that to other currencies
[2:48:26.460 --> 2:48:28.460]  they're buying real assets aren't they
[2:48:28.460 --> 2:48:30.460]  well there's two questions
[2:48:30.460 --> 2:48:32.460]  number one
[2:48:32.460 --> 2:48:34.460]  that's right I think this pullback in gold and silver
[2:48:34.460 --> 2:48:36.460]  have given those people who are
[2:48:36.460 --> 2:48:38.460]  mass who are taking the bailout money
[2:48:38.460 --> 2:48:40.460]  and they've basically
[2:48:40.460 --> 2:48:42.460]  crashed the precious
[2:48:42.460 --> 2:48:44.460]  metal markets and I think they're going to be the biggest buyers of precious metals right now
[2:48:44.460 --> 2:48:46.460]  with America's bailout money
[2:48:46.460 --> 2:48:48.460]  so as they devalue the currency
[2:48:48.460 --> 2:48:50.460]  and that could be the big news coming
[2:48:50.460 --> 2:48:52.460]  out in two weeks time is that
[2:48:52.460 --> 2:48:54.460]  okay the US dollar gets devalued
[2:48:54.460 --> 2:48:56.460]  that means that stuff like precious metals
[2:48:56.460 --> 2:48:58.460]  are going to be jumping in price
[2:48:58.460 --> 2:49:00.460]  and guess who's now going to own all the precious metals
[2:49:00.460 --> 2:49:02.460]  that got scared by the deflation scare
[2:49:02.460 --> 2:49:04.460]  sold out I don't know
[2:49:04.460 --> 2:49:06.460]  I own a ton of gold and silver I myself
[2:49:06.460 --> 2:49:08.460]  was questioning my own
[2:49:08.460 --> 2:49:10.460]  belief in in my own work
[2:49:10.460 --> 2:49:12.460]  because the sell-off was so bad
[2:49:12.460 --> 2:49:14.460]  I mean and I've been looking at it for 25 years
[2:49:14.460 --> 2:49:16.460]  thinking of all the people out there
[2:49:16.460 --> 2:49:18.460]  who are not you know professional
[2:49:18.460 --> 2:49:20.460]  who are thinking god this metal
[2:49:20.460 --> 2:49:22.460]  story is not going to work getting out of it
[2:49:22.460 --> 2:49:24.460]  going to go back into the dollar
[2:49:24.460 --> 2:49:26.460]  going to go back into some of these other things and now they're going to get wiped
[2:49:26.460 --> 2:49:28.460]  they're going to get their clocks cleaned
[2:49:28.460 --> 2:49:30.460]  the dollar gets devalued
[2:49:30.460 --> 2:49:32.460]  and these metals go a lot higher
[2:49:32.460 --> 2:49:34.460]  the other question you're talking about
[2:49:34.460 --> 2:49:36.460]  I think you're asking about is the role of the dollar
[2:49:36.460 --> 2:49:38.460]  at the world reserve currency
[2:49:38.460 --> 2:49:40.460]  is that another question?
[2:49:40.460 --> 2:49:42.460]  alright so since World War II
[2:49:42.460 --> 2:49:44.460]  since Brentwood and you hear leaders all over the world
[2:49:44.460 --> 2:49:46.460]  saying we want a new Brentwood
[2:49:46.460 --> 2:49:48.460]  what does that mean? that means a new world
[2:49:48.460 --> 2:49:50.460]  currency order backed by gold
[2:49:50.460 --> 2:49:52.460]  but since World War II
[2:49:52.460 --> 2:49:54.460]  Brentwood has established a system
[2:49:54.460 --> 2:49:56.460]  where all the world's currencies
[2:49:56.460 --> 2:49:58.460]  are convertible into the dollar
[2:49:58.460 --> 2:50:00.460]  and the dollar was convertible into gold
[2:50:00.460 --> 2:50:02.460]  this went on until 1971
[2:50:02.460 --> 2:50:04.460]  and then all the currencies became free-floating
[2:50:04.460 --> 2:50:06.460]  and they all became fiat currencies
[2:50:06.460 --> 2:50:08.460]  but still all the world commodities
[2:50:08.460 --> 2:50:10.460]  like gold
[2:50:10.460 --> 2:50:12.460]  but oil for another
[2:50:12.460 --> 2:50:14.460]  they're priced in dollars
[2:50:14.460 --> 2:50:16.460]  so if you live in another country
[2:50:16.460 --> 2:50:18.460]  you live in China, you live in Japan, you live in Venezuela
[2:50:18.460 --> 2:50:20.460]  you live in any other country in the world
[2:50:20.460 --> 2:50:22.460]  stay there Max Kaiser got a break
[2:50:22.460 --> 2:50:24.460]  so when they announce
[2:50:24.460 --> 2:50:26.460]  the military system which the UN
[2:50:26.460 --> 2:50:28.460]  and the IMF have announced
[2:50:28.460 --> 2:50:30.460]  they will then announce it's no longer the dollar
[2:50:30.460 --> 2:50:32.460]  that will be the signal
[2:50:32.460 --> 2:50:34.460]  and then we will be completely enslaved
[2:50:34.460 --> 2:50:36.460]  and totally bankrupt
[2:50:36.460 --> 2:50:38.460]  with the days getting shorter
[2:50:38.460 --> 2:50:40.460]  and the nights getting longer
[2:50:40.460 --> 2:50:42.460]  being out after dark increases
[2:50:42.460 --> 2:50:44.460]  your odds of being mugged, assaulted
[2:50:44.460 --> 2:50:46.460]  or even worse
[2:50:46.460 --> 2:50:48.460]  studies show 45% of violent crimes
[2:50:48.460 --> 2:50:50.460]  happen after dark
[2:50:50.460 --> 2:50:52.460]  no matter where you are

[2:51:48.460 --> 2:51:50.460]  we have to look to the Middle East

[2:53:32.460 --> 2:53:34.460]  do it now or become
[2:53:34.460 --> 2:53:36.460]  property of the new world order
[2:53:38.460 --> 2:53:40.460]  alright look I want to go to your calls
[2:53:40.460 --> 2:53:42.460]  on the election
[2:53:42.460 --> 2:53:44.460]  and what's happening on the economy
[2:53:44.460 --> 2:53:46.460]  max guys are going to speak to all of it
[2:53:46.460 --> 2:53:48.460]  well versed kind
[2:53:48.460 --> 2:53:50.460]  but max
[2:53:50.460 --> 2:53:52.460]  they are going out to break
[2:53:52.460 --> 2:53:54.460]  do you think they are going to announce the 21st
[2:53:54.460 --> 2:53:56.460]  or 22nd
[2:53:56.460 --> 2:53:58.460]  I guess they are already announcing it
[2:53:58.460 --> 2:54:00.460]  they see a new world order run by the banks
[2:54:00.460 --> 2:54:02.460]  off the dollar the very banks that engineered it now
[2:54:02.460 --> 2:54:04.460]  I guess they bought up the world
[2:54:04.460 --> 2:54:06.460]  with our currency and they want to leave us holding the bag
[2:54:06.460 --> 2:54:08.460]  I guess they want to pay for it in taxes
[2:54:08.460 --> 2:54:10.460]  and inflation
[2:54:10.460 --> 2:54:12.460]  and I guess we will just be left with Obama's youth
[2:54:12.460 --> 2:54:14.460]  brigade to make sure we pay up
[2:54:14.460 --> 2:54:16.460]  yeah
[2:54:16.460 --> 2:54:18.460]  it looks like the talk
[2:54:18.460 --> 2:54:20.460]  around the world and in Europe
[2:54:20.460 --> 2:54:22.460]  is you keep hearing this phrase
[2:54:22.460 --> 2:54:24.460]  a new Brentwood
[2:54:24.460 --> 2:54:26.460]  that means a new monetary order
[2:54:26.460 --> 2:54:28.460]  to
[2:54:28.460 --> 2:54:30.460]  they have to accommodate
[2:54:30.460 --> 2:54:32.460]  they have to
[2:54:32.460 --> 2:54:34.460]  incorporate the fact that the
[2:54:34.460 --> 2:54:36.460]  dollar is just
[2:54:36.460 --> 2:54:38.460]  too weak
[2:54:38.460 --> 2:54:40.460]  they have to recalibrate the global economy
[2:54:40.460 --> 2:54:42.460]  in such a way
[2:54:42.460 --> 2:54:44.460]  that the dollar is going to be the big loser
[2:54:44.460 --> 2:54:46.460]  because there are too many of them
[2:54:46.460 --> 2:54:48.460]  the money supply
[2:54:48.460 --> 2:54:50.460]  is too great
[2:54:50.460 --> 2:54:52.460]  there is no production in America
[2:54:52.460 --> 2:54:54.460]  there is no jobs in America
[2:54:54.460 --> 2:54:56.460]  the bankers took our money
[2:54:56.460 --> 2:54:58.460]  devalued it to buy up real goods and services for themselves
[2:54:58.460 --> 2:55:00.460]  build their new world order
[2:55:00.460 --> 2:55:02.460]  and now they are going to leave us holding the bag
[2:55:02.460 --> 2:55:04.460]  Max Kaiser how bad is it going to get
[2:55:04.460 --> 2:55:06.460]  well I mean
[2:55:06.460 --> 2:55:08.460]  the U.S.
[2:55:08.460 --> 2:55:10.460]  in terms of what
[2:55:10.460 --> 2:55:12.460]  in terms of
[2:55:12.460 --> 2:55:14.460]  how bad is it going to get
[2:55:14.460 --> 2:55:16.460]  think about it
[2:55:16.460 --> 2:55:18.460]  the money in your pocket
[2:55:18.460 --> 2:55:20.460]  the value is going to be cut in half
[2:55:20.460 --> 2:55:22.460]  so you can do the math
[2:55:22.460 --> 2:55:24.460]  figure it out yourself
[2:55:24.460 --> 2:55:26.460]  notice GM is
[2:55:26.460 --> 2:55:28.460]  about to go under their saying
[2:55:28.460 --> 2:55:30.460]  and the government says no money for you
[2:55:30.460 --> 2:55:32.460]  but all these foreign bankers
[2:55:32.460 --> 2:55:34.460]  are going to be
[2:55:34.460 --> 2:55:36.460]  well they just
[2:55:36.460 --> 2:55:38.460]  they are simply the way that they are going to get out of this
[2:55:38.460 --> 2:55:40.460]  the way that they are going to approach this
[2:55:40.460 --> 2:55:42.460]  with this new Brentwood agreement
[2:55:42.460 --> 2:55:44.460]  is going to effectively devalue the currency
[2:55:44.460 --> 2:55:46.460]  look at the history of countries like Argentina
[2:55:46.460 --> 2:55:48.460]  for example
[2:55:48.460 --> 2:55:50.460]  America is going to go through the same thing
[2:55:50.460 --> 2:55:52.460]  America has been telling the world
[2:55:52.460 --> 2:55:54.460]  to the IMF and the World Bank
[2:55:54.460 --> 2:55:56.460]  and all these organizations how to run their economy
[2:55:56.460 --> 2:55:58.460]  accept these conditions
[2:55:58.460 --> 2:56:00.460]  accept the us managing your economy
[2:56:00.460 --> 2:56:02.460]  these are the resources and they destroy their economies
[2:56:02.460 --> 2:56:04.460]  now it's going to
[2:56:04.460 --> 2:56:06.460]  the chickens are coming home to roost
[2:56:06.460 --> 2:56:08.460]  now the world is telling America
[2:56:08.460 --> 2:56:10.460]  we don't want your stink in U.S. territory
[2:56:10.460 --> 2:56:12.460]  government bonds anymore
[2:56:12.460 --> 2:56:14.460]  we don't want your dollars anymore
[2:56:14.460 --> 2:56:16.460]  if you want to borrow money
[2:56:16.460 --> 2:56:18.460]  you're going to have to borrow it in Chinese or Japanese
[2:56:18.460 --> 2:56:20.460]  or European currencies
[2:56:20.460 --> 2:56:22.460]  we're not going to take any more of your dollars anymore
[2:56:22.460 --> 2:56:24.460]  Max Couser
[2:56:24.460 --> 2:56:26.460]  the bottom line is it's going to get crazy
[2:56:26.460 --> 2:56:28.460]  go ahead
[2:56:28.460 --> 2:56:30.460]  I have been developed over the post-world world war 2 era
[2:56:30.460 --> 2:56:32.460]  it's coming to a close
[2:56:32.460 --> 2:56:34.460]  because
[2:56:34.460 --> 2:56:36.460]  getting back to the world reserve currency
[2:56:36.460 --> 2:56:38.460]  how it works
[2:56:38.460 --> 2:56:40.460]  is that the U.S.
[2:56:40.460 --> 2:56:42.460]  when the U.S. needs money
[2:56:42.460 --> 2:56:44.460]  they sell these countries bonds
[2:56:44.460 --> 2:56:46.460]  and then when the interest is due on the bonds
[2:56:46.460 --> 2:56:48.460]  they simply sell them more bonds
[2:56:48.460 --> 2:56:50.460]  so it's like you got a checkbook
[2:56:50.460 --> 2:56:52.460]  anytime you want something you write a check
[2:56:52.460 --> 2:56:54.460]  but the deal is the person who you wrote the check to
[2:56:54.460 --> 2:56:56.460]  never cash with the check
[2:56:56.460 --> 2:56:59.580]  going on for decades now the rest of all the time wait a minute wait a minute
[2:56:59.580 --> 2:57:02.460]  wait a minute we're not taking your bad money anymore you can't voucher check
[2:57:02.460 --> 2:57:06.780]  anymore we've been in Hollywood movies we we we know what you're about now we
[2:57:06.780 --> 2:57:10.540]  don't want to their bad money but not one layer higher let's go one layer
[2:57:10.540 --> 2:57:15.180]  higher stick let's all of them going a new world order the international banks
[2:57:15.180 --> 2:57:21.300]  will set the world's you know prices the currencies the stock rules the banking
[2:57:21.300 --> 2:57:25.100]  rules the brokerage rules they're the ones that engineered all this and used
[2:57:25.100 --> 2:57:29.580]  America as their engine as their bad guy and as their muscle and then they're
[2:57:29.580 --> 2:57:34.660]  all they're smiling like Cheshire cats posing as savers when they engineered it
[2:57:34.660 --> 2:57:40.460]  all right well that's why I'm saying to the people in America who listen to
[2:57:40.460 --> 2:57:46.000]  your show you know why why not stage a revolt you know it did work in the
[2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:51.460]  1776 period Washington did happen again you know as the as Jefferson said
[2:57:51.460 --> 2:57:55.980]  democracy has to be refreshed every 50 or 60 years you know no matter what it
[2:57:55.980 --> 2:58:00.940]  takes and I'm saying everyone should sit together and say you know what we're
[2:58:00.940 --> 2:58:04.740]  not going to pay our mortgages to the bankers we're going on a strike what I
[2:58:04.740 --> 2:58:08.420]  pay in these mortgages to help you stay there Max Kaiser we're going to be back

[3:02:42.820 --> 3:02:43.620]  alex
[3:02:43.620 --> 3:02:44.520]  go ahead sir
[3:02:44.520 --> 3:02:47.520]  yeah like what i actually got a statement um...
[3:02:47.520 --> 3:02:52.020]  with uh... regards to mccain and uh... obama
[3:02:52.020 --> 3:02:54.340]  if mccain uh... if the oil is
[3:02:54.340 --> 3:02:56.860]  what your guest is saying is uh... start to shoot up
[3:02:56.860 --> 3:02:59.280]  do you see it going back up because i remember uh...
[3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:03.300]  uh... the prediction of uh... i can't remember his name right now saying that
[3:03:03.300 --> 3:03:06.700]  will go down to fifty dollars lindsay william said three months ago will go
[3:03:06.700 --> 3:03:07.940]  down to sixty
[3:03:07.940 --> 3:03:09.780]  and it has
[3:03:09.780 --> 3:03:13.380]  it did from a buck forty down to sixty and uh...
[3:03:13.380 --> 3:03:17.340]  it will you're seeing it he said it will go back up again
[3:03:17.340 --> 3:03:20.140]  because mccain's probably not going to get it but they also said mccain was
[3:03:20.140 --> 3:03:20.900]  their man
[3:03:20.900 --> 3:03:24.540]  and and i'm trying to figure it out one-sided mccain's got the oil company
[3:03:24.540 --> 3:03:25.380]  supporting them
[3:03:25.380 --> 3:03:27.260]  and obama's got the bankers but
[3:03:27.260 --> 3:03:27.860]  you know
[3:03:27.860 --> 3:03:29.780]  uh... he's got uh...
[3:03:29.780 --> 3:03:33.020]  terry kiffinger back at him which is ran by rockefeller
[3:03:33.020 --> 3:03:34.120]  and rockefeller runs
[3:03:34.120 --> 3:03:38.940]  chase they're on both of them what you have a question for max keiser
[3:03:38.940 --> 3:03:41.620]  yeah basically uh... do you see that going up
[3:03:41.620 --> 3:03:44.820]  back up to where it was yes okay let's get that question we're gonna skip this
[3:03:44.820 --> 3:03:48.220]  break to a max keiser max
[3:03:48.220 --> 3:03:49.220]  yeah the uh...
[3:03:49.220 --> 3:03:53.740]  you are still well going up because of money supply now started to be jacked up
[3:03:53.740 --> 3:03:57.980]  so well like we're saying before the break is price in dollars just like all
[3:03:57.980 --> 3:03:59.660]  commodities in the world
[3:03:59.660 --> 3:04:02.980]  and as the uh... supply dollars increases
[3:04:02.980 --> 3:04:04.500]  oil price goes up
[3:04:04.500 --> 3:04:06.780]  as part of the inflation that comes with
[3:04:06.780 --> 3:04:10.700]  oil with uh... oil price going up now with the devaluation coming which will
[3:04:10.700 --> 3:04:11.500]  make the
[3:04:11.500 --> 3:04:15.340]  uh... value the dollar even more precarious you're going to see oil even
[3:04:15.340 --> 3:04:16.940]  take another leap up
[3:04:16.940 --> 3:04:20.340]  well a lot of analysts say a hundred back up to a hundred bucks a barrel
[3:04:20.340 --> 3:04:23.780]  by next summer i'm gonna skip this break the internet audience with max keiser
[3:04:23.780 --> 3:04:25.260]  thanks for the call
[3:04:25.260 --> 3:04:28.740]  will be right back on it take more calls
[3:04:28.740 --> 3:04:33.020]  okay let's talk to jake in new york you're on the air with max keiser go
[3:04:33.020 --> 3:04:38.020]  ahead jake
[3:04:38.020 --> 3:04:39.340]  jake
[3:04:39.340 --> 3:04:40.860]  go ahead you're on the air
[3:04:40.860 --> 3:04:44.180]  on the air yes we're going to let you go in a moment
[3:04:44.180 --> 3:04:48.780]  my my uh... question for you about barack obama is his link to the council
[3:04:48.780 --> 3:04:53.780]  inform relations and why that has not been brought to more light and why the
[3:04:53.780 --> 3:04:58.500]  police state continues to look like it looks like like in in new york where i
[3:04:58.500 --> 3:05:00.860]  live we're having mobilization
[3:05:00.860 --> 3:05:05.540]  all mobilization units walking around the car driving in the excuse to have
[3:05:05.540 --> 3:05:08.940]  riot police out any excuse to sell us that were slaves
[3:05:08.940 --> 3:05:11.300]  any excuse to go taping up they have
[3:05:11.300 --> 3:05:16.300]  they have fans with eight video cameras on them driving into crowded areas
[3:05:16.300 --> 3:05:19.380]  yeah they're going to bankrupt america and take everything we've got no matter
[3:05:19.380 --> 3:05:21.580]  who gets elected these men are just puppets
[3:05:21.580 --> 3:05:23.660]  and so this is the long dark winner
[3:05:23.660 --> 3:05:26.740]  that america is going into this is what we're getting as we were spoiled
[3:05:26.740 --> 3:05:30.660]  rotten and stupid and let tyranny grow max keiser
[3:05:30.660 --> 3:05:33.220]  no one i have a question of
[3:05:33.220 --> 3:05:35.140]  that is that all
[3:05:35.140 --> 3:05:39.060]  every everybody on i i guess a lot of people that have been coming on the show
[3:05:39.060 --> 3:05:41.580]  have been talking about how great all
[3:05:41.580 --> 3:05:46.660]  fdr was and i wanted to know what your views on that word being is that he
[3:05:46.660 --> 3:05:49.460]  uh... abolished the gold standard and
[3:05:49.460 --> 3:05:52.420]  uh... yes some people i listen i appreciate your call we're going to
[3:05:52.420 --> 3:05:53.940]  go ahead and let him comment now
[3:05:53.940 --> 3:05:57.060]  uh... yeah a lot of people are saying we need a fdr style bailout
[3:05:57.060 --> 3:06:00.060]  instead of just paying everything directly the bankers but either way it
[3:06:00.060 --> 3:06:03.780]  devalues the currency in the end doesn't max
[3:06:03.780 --> 3:06:07.260]  yeah pretty much the currency is going to suffer in the end i mean at the fdr
[3:06:07.260 --> 3:06:11.220]  package certainly putting money bypassing the banking system
[3:06:11.220 --> 3:06:14.580]  uh... would have been uh... probably a way to put it directly in the hands of
[3:06:14.580 --> 3:06:15.380]  people
[3:06:15.380 --> 3:06:18.220]  uh... as far as it relates to gold because fdr
[3:06:18.220 --> 3:06:19.940]  as a part of the car point out
[3:06:19.940 --> 3:06:21.340]  to spend it is out of gold
[3:06:21.340 --> 3:06:22.940]  we're going to see this type of thing
[3:06:22.940 --> 3:06:26.220]  where gold sales this is why people need to really be aware of the whole gold
[3:06:26.220 --> 3:06:27.180]  situation
[3:06:27.180 --> 3:06:28.940]  and if at all possible get
[3:06:28.940 --> 3:06:33.060]  on some gold outside of the uf that that option is available with different
[3:06:33.060 --> 3:06:34.020]  services
[3:06:34.020 --> 3:06:37.300]  if you do a little research you can find services that allow you to buy gold and
[3:06:37.300 --> 3:06:39.580]  have it all outside of the uf
[3:06:39.580 --> 3:06:43.340]  because it has a dollar devaluation program comes in the possibility of
[3:06:43.340 --> 3:06:44.620]  confiscating gold
[3:06:44.620 --> 3:06:45.740]  will once again
[3:06:45.740 --> 3:06:47.380]  uh... that rear-tugly head
[3:06:47.380 --> 3:06:51.660]  so you should have your gold app and bully outside the uf people always say
[3:06:51.660 --> 3:06:53.820]  why should i hold all they can just take it
[3:06:53.820 --> 3:06:57.020]  that's better than having a just be money in a bank that they're devaluing or
[3:06:57.020 --> 3:07:00.260]  they can seize
[3:07:00.260 --> 3:07:03.420]  but i mean it that we're going to be
[3:07:03.420 --> 3:07:05.620]  having gold bullion and uh...
[3:07:05.620 --> 3:07:09.260]  it's a real issue it's definitely a real issue that's why
[3:07:09.260 --> 3:07:11.900]  there are services that allow to own it
[3:07:11.900 --> 3:07:13.340]  outside of the uf
[3:07:13.340 --> 3:07:15.540]  and and that should really should be looked at
[3:07:15.540 --> 3:07:17.540]  there's a couple of ways on the internet
[3:07:17.540 --> 3:07:19.700]  you know i'm not going to give a free advertisement
[3:07:19.700 --> 3:07:22.220]  but there are a couple of services on the web
[3:07:22.220 --> 3:07:24.220]  well there's more than a couple there's thousands
[3:07:24.220 --> 3:07:26.500]  you can keep it in lexenberg or wherever
[3:07:26.500 --> 3:07:30.340]  okay we're going back to the full audience here we go
[3:07:30.340 --> 3:07:33.060]  he's the t-rex of political talk
[3:07:33.060 --> 3:07:37.660]  alex jones on the gc n radio network
[3:07:37.660 --> 3:07:41.460]  international uh... bloodcaster financial expert max kaiser we're taking
[3:07:41.460 --> 3:07:44.500]  your phone calls are all over the map that's fine that's what i expected
[3:07:44.500 --> 3:07:47.340]  one eight hundred two five nine nine two three one before the show ends will
[3:07:47.340 --> 3:07:48.340]  give you the latest
[3:07:48.340 --> 3:07:50.940]  election numbers coming in from around the country obviously
[3:07:50.940 --> 3:07:53.540]  looks very good for barack obama
[3:07:53.540 --> 3:07:55.380]  uh... but uh...
[3:07:55.380 --> 3:07:57.420]  there are police all over the country
[3:07:57.420 --> 3:07:59.780]  treating the entire public like enemies
[3:07:59.780 --> 3:08:02.220]  uh...
[3:08:02.220 --> 3:08:06.140]  in case there was some type of rioting over the election
[3:08:06.140 --> 3:08:09.140]  there are lots of other things happening there are reports of black
[3:08:09.140 --> 3:08:12.980]  panthers this is uh... up on drudge and fox so it's questionable
[3:08:12.980 --> 3:08:15.980]  blocking white people from getting into polling places
[3:08:15.980 --> 3:08:19.020]  but there is also such a worship of barack obama who knows it may be true
[3:08:19.020 --> 3:08:20.940]  they've got video
[3:08:20.940 --> 3:08:23.220]  so lots of insanity going on
[3:08:23.220 --> 3:08:26.780]  uh... as uh... people fight over the two puppets max kaiser i want to go back
[3:08:26.780 --> 3:08:29.340]  to the calls here in this final segment but right now
[3:08:29.340 --> 3:08:30.580]  your analysis
[3:08:30.580 --> 3:08:34.740]  your take on how they were able to have physical gold dry up where you can
[3:08:34.740 --> 3:08:35.780]  hardly buy it
[3:08:35.780 --> 3:08:37.980]  or if you could it was a thirty forty fifty
[3:08:37.980 --> 3:08:40.620]  hundred percent markup that's mainstream news
[3:08:40.620 --> 3:08:43.060]  how did these international institutions
[3:08:43.060 --> 3:08:46.900]  creatives and we know they can play a manipulate markets but to have it were
[3:08:46.900 --> 3:08:49.060]  golds dropping two hundred bucks an ounce
[3:08:49.060 --> 3:08:51.180]  or two hundred fifty bucks an ounce now going back up
[3:08:51.180 --> 3:08:52.180]  dropping
[3:08:52.180 --> 3:08:55.700]  while you physically can't get it demands at all time highs how do they do
[3:08:55.700 --> 3:08:57.380]  that
[3:08:57.380 --> 3:08:58.900]  what's the paper market out
[3:08:58.900 --> 3:09:02.780]  i mean the gold is trade on the come back as a features contract the people
[3:09:02.780 --> 3:09:05.180]  who buy and sell it are taking physical delivery
[3:09:05.180 --> 3:09:08.820]  and just like they can make the price of anything else on the paper markets go
[3:09:08.820 --> 3:09:11.300]  in any direction they want to they can make the price of gold
[3:09:11.300 --> 3:09:15.660]  go down if they wouldn't want the price of gold a cell gold contract short
[3:09:15.660 --> 3:09:17.860]  they sell contracts
[3:09:17.860 --> 3:09:21.100]  the new you sell something the price goes down and here's the here's the
[3:09:21.100 --> 3:09:24.220]  incredible thing they have sold more contract short
[3:09:24.220 --> 3:09:26.780]  in the call max is any hope of ever delivering
[3:09:26.780 --> 3:09:30.420]  and this December from what i'm hearing it is going to be a crash of the call
[3:09:30.420 --> 3:09:34.260]  max because people are going to demand their physical delivery of the golden
[3:09:34.260 --> 3:09:37.980]  silver they will not be able to fill that transaction will not be able to
[3:09:37.980 --> 3:09:40.100]  deliver it'll be a failed delivery
[3:09:40.100 --> 3:09:43.060]  and you're going to see huge dislocation and the call max is being
[3:09:43.060 --> 3:09:43.980]  targeted
[3:09:43.980 --> 3:09:47.340]  by people you know by investors there's actually individual investors united
[3:09:47.340 --> 3:09:48.300]  states were saying
[3:09:48.300 --> 3:09:51.420]  who are staging a revolt against call max in the silver market they say we want
[3:09:51.420 --> 3:09:52.420]  physical delivery
[3:09:52.420 --> 3:09:54.860]  and we're going down there we go we want our gold
[3:09:54.860 --> 3:09:57.300]  and it's also here in the international community because
[3:09:57.300 --> 3:10:01.340]  this is the complex is destroying the reserves for mining and mining companies
[3:10:01.340 --> 3:10:02.260]  all over the world
[3:10:02.260 --> 3:10:06.660]  in russia in in in canada you know these mining companies are having a shut
[3:10:06.660 --> 3:10:10.300]  down because call max is driving the price down artificially
[3:10:10.300 --> 3:10:11.660]  and now they're saying that what
[3:10:11.660 --> 3:10:15.260]  tell you we're going to we're going to bust call max and that physical prices
[3:10:15.260 --> 3:10:17.180]  that the paper price is going to be destroyed
[3:10:17.180 --> 3:10:20.100]  you're going to see the true black market prices and assert itself
[3:10:20.100 --> 3:10:22.180]  gold is trading in the black market it
[3:10:22.180 --> 3:10:23.580]  a lot higher prices
[3:10:23.580 --> 3:10:27.140]  and that's going to be the market as well i know nobody can buy it you know
[3:10:27.140 --> 3:10:29.060]  seven fifty or whatever
[3:10:29.060 --> 3:10:32.580]  uh... to then be able to sell it to people what they claim spot is
[3:10:32.580 --> 3:10:34.260]  i mean it's just absolutely
[3:10:34.260 --> 3:10:37.180]  absolutely not i mean i can't get gold in paris
[3:10:37.180 --> 3:10:39.660]  i can't get black gold bullion in paris
[3:10:39.660 --> 3:10:40.980]  for less than
[3:10:40.980 --> 3:10:43.500]  you know eleven twelve hundred dollars
[3:10:43.500 --> 3:10:46.820]  you know down there to gold bullion deal in in in you know
[3:10:46.820 --> 3:10:50.580]  uh... if i go in there off the street if i'm buying inside obviously i can
[3:10:50.580 --> 3:10:52.100]  negotiate a better deal
[3:10:52.100 --> 3:10:53.420]  but the spot price
[3:10:53.420 --> 3:10:55.620]  it but you can see today though alex as
[3:10:55.620 --> 3:10:57.700]  the news is coming out of washington now that they're going to have to
[3:10:57.700 --> 3:11:00.020]  refinance a half a trillion dollars worth of
[3:11:00.020 --> 3:11:02.460]  bad debt because of the bailout packages
[3:11:02.460 --> 3:11:04.940]  and because of all the money went to the bankers and then go into the system
[3:11:04.940 --> 3:11:07.700]  they got to go back to the top of the half a trillion
[3:11:07.700 --> 3:11:09.460]  now the and and with the rumor
[3:11:09.460 --> 3:11:11.060]  uh... getting louder
[3:11:11.060 --> 3:11:14.100]  of a devaluation of the dollar you see that golden oil
[3:11:14.100 --> 3:11:16.180]  are saying that with this we're going higher
[3:11:16.180 --> 3:11:19.340]  because it's going to be a lot of inflation coming through the pipeline
[3:11:19.340 --> 3:11:23.660]  golden golden the oil are going higher to reflect this to the part of the story
[3:11:23.660 --> 3:11:27.620]  yeah go ahead primary full story of inflation is very much in place
[3:11:27.620 --> 3:11:29.180]  people should not be fooled by it
[3:11:29.180 --> 3:11:31.660]  you know owning real assets is what that's going to save you through this
[3:11:31.660 --> 3:11:35.340]  inflationary period don't believe inflationary hype that's out there you
[3:11:35.340 --> 3:11:36.140]  know even
[3:11:36.140 --> 3:11:38.980]  uh... wall street journal newsweek time to talk about
[3:11:38.980 --> 3:11:40.380]  although inflation care
[3:11:40.380 --> 3:11:43.300]  it's impossible but what we have happening is
[3:11:43.300 --> 3:11:46.260]  a depression and contraction in the real economy
[3:11:46.260 --> 3:11:48.580]  with a bunch of manipulation on top of it
[3:11:48.580 --> 3:11:51.820]  by governments institutions to drive commodities down
[3:11:51.820 --> 3:11:55.780]  knowing that it's an attempt to get control of hyperinflation so they could
[3:11:55.780 --> 3:11:56.820]  try to block it
[3:11:56.820 --> 3:11:58.140]  before the election
[3:11:58.140 --> 3:12:00.420]  and clearly it's like a beach ball trying to hold it
[3:12:00.420 --> 3:12:01.580]  underneath the water
[3:12:01.580 --> 3:12:05.540]  uh... let's talk to stephanie in new york you're on the air with max geyser and

[3:12:44.300 --> 3:12:45.900]  and i'm not going to vote
[3:12:45.900 --> 3:12:47.580]  for my king obviously i'm sorry
[3:12:47.580 --> 3:12:50.780]  well well well well well well we're in the same boat
[3:12:50.780 --> 3:12:53.100]  it's a moral decision people
[3:12:53.100 --> 3:12:56.540]  are told about like a horse race who thinks can win the race or if you know
[3:12:56.540 --> 3:12:58.780]  bandwagon uh... going for a
[3:12:58.780 --> 3:13:00.660]  going for a football team
[3:13:00.660 --> 3:13:03.420]  once you think they're in the playoffs and uh... and you know on the
[3:13:03.420 --> 3:13:05.180]  championship of the super bowl
[3:13:05.180 --> 3:13:07.260]  i would vote for
[3:13:07.260 --> 3:13:10.580]  the constitution party or i would vote for the ralph nader
[3:13:10.580 --> 3:13:11.340]  uh... yeah
[3:13:11.340 --> 3:13:16.620]  well they have never had even know that there was people on
[3:13:16.620 --> 3:13:18.900]  uh... running for president
[3:13:18.900 --> 3:13:20.620]  until yesterday
[3:13:20.620 --> 3:13:24.380]  until yesterday and i looked it up and you google it once you couldn't get it
[3:13:24.380 --> 3:13:26.740]  once well and it's not that nader
[3:13:26.740 --> 3:13:28.860]  well it's not that nader or
[3:13:28.860 --> 3:13:31.860]  or check balvin are going to win the whole point is
[3:13:31.860 --> 3:13:35.860]  so much attention is put on this and people think they're going to get changed
[3:13:35.860 --> 3:13:37.300]  with obama they're not
[3:13:37.300 --> 3:13:40.380]  and they're not going to get changed with john mccain their own by the same
[3:13:40.380 --> 3:13:41.500]  people so
[3:13:41.500 --> 3:13:44.460]  you know i know you're saying you want to ask me how you should vote and i'm
[3:13:44.460 --> 3:13:47.660]  and i'm and i'm honored by that stephanie but but i have to morally tell
[3:13:47.660 --> 3:13:49.180]  you i can't tell you
[3:13:49.180 --> 3:13:50.220]  how i think
[3:13:50.220 --> 3:13:51.580]  uh... you should vote
[3:13:51.580 --> 3:13:53.420]  all i can tell you is
[3:13:53.420 --> 3:13:57.020]  that barack obama is in the hip pocket of the very bankers looting us
[3:13:57.020 --> 3:13:58.820]  now i don't know max keiser
[3:13:58.820 --> 3:14:01.500]  i don't like to you know get these political footballs because he knows the
[3:14:01.500 --> 3:14:02.940]  bankers are above both
[3:14:02.940 --> 3:14:05.700]  obama and mccain so it doesn't matter to the day but i mean do you have a
[3:14:05.700 --> 3:14:08.540]  comment max
[3:14:08.540 --> 3:14:10.460]  to the caller or you know
[3:14:10.460 --> 3:14:13.100]  the people who would you vote for obama
[3:14:13.100 --> 3:14:15.420]  but my position on obama
[3:14:15.420 --> 3:14:17.220]  is that uh...
[3:14:17.220 --> 3:14:22.100]  i i i support obama you know because uh... and i'm gonna i feel here's what
[3:14:22.100 --> 3:14:23.220]  i'm gonna do alex
[3:14:23.220 --> 3:14:25.860]  you know when bush came into office in two thousand
[3:14:25.860 --> 3:14:29.500]  i left the united states of america because i knew the guy
[3:14:29.500 --> 3:14:32.740]  was going to just be a horrible president to live in america
[3:14:32.740 --> 3:14:35.260]  uh... here's what i put my here's what i'm thinking about
[3:14:35.260 --> 3:14:39.380]  uh... the problem takes office i may be moving back to america i may be moving
[3:14:39.380 --> 3:14:41.860]  back to america because i want to test them
[3:14:41.860 --> 3:14:45.620]  i want to test them with with with some of the civil disobedience ideas
[3:14:45.620 --> 3:14:48.860]  i want to test them to see what this guy could really do for us and if he
[3:14:48.860 --> 3:14:50.140]  doesn't pass the test
[3:14:50.140 --> 3:14:53.620]  then it's time for us to take back our country in the in the most serious way
[3:14:53.620 --> 3:14:56.020]  where you're saying you're saying give him a shot
[3:14:56.020 --> 3:14:58.260]  see if he gets the troops out of iraq
[3:14:58.260 --> 3:15:02.860]  uh... see what he does see if he ends some of the illegal wiretapping and then
[3:15:02.860 --> 3:15:03.940]  if he doesn't
[3:15:03.940 --> 3:15:07.860]  you know uh... morally then you're going to go after in political
[3:15:07.860 --> 3:15:08.980]  absolutely
[3:15:08.980 --> 3:15:12.020]  that's my that's my constitutional responsibility it doesn't the
[3:15:12.020 --> 3:15:13.980]  constitution quite clearly
[3:15:13.980 --> 3:15:18.620]  that if in fact a tyrant isn't in control and we had a tyrant already
[3:15:18.620 --> 3:15:22.140]  but if it gets to the point where it's going absolutely bonkers even more
[3:15:22.140 --> 3:15:26.220]  tyrant all max then what what what what we max we have met max seven eight
[3:15:26.220 --> 3:15:29.660]  months ago when he was saying he take all the troops out in the wiretapping
[3:15:29.660 --> 3:15:31.060]  i went hey
[3:15:31.060 --> 3:15:34.660]  darryl my rights right about the age virus maybe obama's
[3:15:34.660 --> 3:15:39.460]  it you know is you know you know is a rogue and against the system and
[3:15:39.460 --> 3:15:43.180]  you know who hillary's trying to change in new hampshire maybe he's good
[3:15:43.180 --> 3:15:46.940]  uh... but then since then he's he he's gone back on everything
[3:15:46.940 --> 3:15:53.620]  so you know it it's it's up to you stephany to make up your own mind okay
[3:15:53.620 --> 3:15:54.740]  she's still there
[3:15:54.740 --> 3:15:56.860]  yet hello yes go ahead
[3:15:56.860 --> 3:15:58.540]  yes um...
[3:15:58.540 --> 3:16:00.460]  i don't want to put my vote
[3:16:00.460 --> 3:16:03.100]  for pop up a person that i know
[3:16:03.100 --> 3:16:04.340]  is a puppet
[3:16:04.340 --> 3:16:06.660]  so i would feel guilty
[3:16:06.660 --> 3:16:11.020]  even though i'm one of the minority in new york city and i'm in the urban
[3:16:11.020 --> 3:16:11.900]  setting
[3:16:11.900 --> 3:16:14.420]  i would feel so guilty knowing
[3:16:14.420 --> 3:16:16.540]  what i listen to you
[3:16:16.540 --> 3:16:17.120]  and
[3:16:17.120 --> 3:16:20.700]  i really respect you and i honor what you say
[3:16:20.700 --> 3:16:23.140]  and just for me hearing your word
[3:16:23.140 --> 3:16:29.420]  your spoken word it was even a mission to me to even hear your wisdom words
[3:16:29.420 --> 3:16:32.020]  i'm not going to put my vote on obama
[3:16:32.020 --> 3:16:36.080]  or mccain that's why i want to independent or another person
[3:16:36.080 --> 3:16:37.340]  that i will put
[3:16:37.340 --> 3:16:40.860]  that's right about to and the point is you've done the moral thing thank you
[3:16:40.860 --> 3:16:43.740]  and if more people did what stephanie's doing
[3:16:43.740 --> 3:16:46.300]  and voted who they really thought was the best person
[3:16:46.300 --> 3:16:48.460]  with the best ideas
[3:16:48.460 --> 3:16:52.020]  this non-status non-centralization you know control
[3:16:52.020 --> 3:16:54.260]  then we would have people like ron paul
[3:16:54.260 --> 3:16:55.620]  we would have people
[3:16:55.620 --> 3:16:57.340]  uh... you know like ralph nader
[3:16:57.340 --> 3:16:58.900]  or a sythia mckinney
[3:16:58.900 --> 3:17:02.580]  and uh... you know i mean even vote for sythia mckinney you know over over them
[3:17:02.580 --> 3:17:05.820]  but thank you so much i would take more calls later but i'm gonna let
[3:17:05.820 --> 3:17:07.940]  max keiser have the final comments

[3:17:19.420 --> 3:17:20.640]  the way to power out
[3:17:20.640 --> 3:17:21.740]  in los angeles

[3:17:25.300 --> 3:17:26.460]  bush
[3:17:26.460 --> 3:17:30.940]  yeah he said that uh... if if obama when he's going to move to canada
[3:17:30.940 --> 3:17:33.580]  so we may be passing each other on the airplane
[3:17:33.580 --> 3:17:34.500]  we'll be leaving
[3:17:34.500 --> 3:17:36.100]  with it between his legs
[3:17:36.100 --> 3:17:40.740]  and i'll be i'll be coming back to uh... you know do to to you know basically
[3:17:40.740 --> 3:17:41.440]  uh...
[3:17:41.440 --> 3:17:42.660]  fight for
[3:17:42.660 --> 3:17:46.260]  uh... what i believe everyone should be fighting for which is a uh... an
[3:17:46.260 --> 3:17:47.100]  equitable
[3:17:47.100 --> 3:17:51.100]  uh... and representation of uh... we are the people
[3:17:51.100 --> 3:17:53.820]  steven baldwin is a classic case of a useful idiot
[3:17:53.820 --> 3:17:56.660]  he really means well he's a good christian person
[3:17:56.660 --> 3:17:57.780]  he goes around
[3:17:57.780 --> 3:18:01.780]  brainwashing people to join the military brainwashing kids love bush
[3:18:01.780 --> 3:18:04.740]  when bush is being visited nightly by gay porn stars
[3:18:04.740 --> 3:18:07.620]  i'm not even attacking for that point is a total hypocrite
[3:18:07.620 --> 3:18:11.060]  and i mean you couldn't get more corrupt in george w bush
[3:18:11.060 --> 3:18:13.100]  uh...
[3:18:13.100 --> 3:18:17.820]  uh... so i mean i just feel sorry for steven baldwin i mean what a sucker
[3:18:17.820 --> 3:18:20.820]  they're not for a long time he's uh... he's obviously got a very strong
[3:18:20.820 --> 3:18:25.020]  belief uh... and they eat he put his money you know we eat he does he act on
[3:18:25.020 --> 3:18:25.860]  a belief
[3:18:25.860 --> 3:18:29.460]  so i can't fault him for a week you know acting on a belief i'm just saying that
[3:18:29.460 --> 3:18:30.260]  if i act
[3:18:30.260 --> 3:18:34.580]  on my beliefs on a situation you know i feel that uh... we
[3:18:34.580 --> 3:18:37.820]  you know what i thought this is an opportune time you know this is could be
[3:18:37.820 --> 3:18:42.380]  uh... this could be a moment history well could be very and those carbon

[3:19:23.940 --> 3:19:25.140]  hold on one second
[3:19:25.140 --> 3:19:27.620]  we're gonna skip this break on the internet so so we can finish up with a
[3:19:27.620 --> 3:19:29.980]  story
[3:19:29.980 --> 3:19:33.900]  yeah max i haven't really built you up properly for the audience out there that

[3:19:35.420 --> 3:19:39.340]  uh... guy and and that that's also scary about you talking about
[3:19:39.340 --> 3:19:42.020]  devaluing the dollar devaluing the currency
[3:19:42.020 --> 3:19:44.860]  going to a britain wood system so the few minutes we've got left with you this
[3:19:44.860 --> 3:19:46.900]  is just for the internet audience but it's millions
[3:19:46.900 --> 3:19:49.860]  uh... tell folks more about the tv show
[3:19:49.860 --> 3:19:52.980]  more about your website what you do how folks in your radio show
[3:19:52.980 --> 3:19:54.300]  and and and then a
[3:19:54.300 --> 3:19:55.700]  few minutes about
[3:19:55.700 --> 3:19:59.420]  what that new currency is gonna look like and then we'll let you go
[3:19:59.420 --> 3:20:02.020]  okay
[3:20:02.020 --> 3:20:04.460]  we're all there right now go ahead
[3:20:04.460 --> 3:20:06.060]  oh yeah i uh...
[3:20:06.060 --> 3:20:10.580]  right we've got this new show working on uh... bbc world it's going to be a
[3:20:10.580 --> 3:20:12.700]  hopefully starting up in january
[3:20:12.700 --> 3:20:15.660]  and uh... they mentioned alec is uh... producer on the show it's called the
[3:20:15.660 --> 3:20:16.540]  oracle
[3:20:16.540 --> 3:20:19.260]  i'm taking all these prediction market better out there now that have come
[3:20:19.260 --> 3:20:21.060]  after the holiday stock exchange
[3:20:21.060 --> 3:20:24.220]  and uh... as you point out in the introduction i invented the whole idea
[3:20:24.220 --> 3:20:26.580]  prediction markets and event of the technology of it
[3:20:26.580 --> 3:20:30.460]  so we're gonna have a panel of experts and guests kind of figure out what the
[3:20:30.460 --> 3:20:32.580]  future is going to be so issue like
[3:20:32.580 --> 3:20:33.740]  with this brand would
[3:20:33.740 --> 3:20:37.340]  accord will have a couple of experts will have a couple of uh...
[3:20:37.340 --> 3:20:40.620]  non-experts to try to pick it apart and we'll try to figure out and we'll look
[3:20:40.620 --> 3:20:41.580]  at the market
[3:20:41.580 --> 3:20:45.020]  because the market for generally anticipated discount future events
[3:20:45.020 --> 3:20:46.300]  more accurately
[3:20:46.300 --> 3:20:49.900]  then any news pundit if you notice the prediction markets on sites like in
[3:20:49.900 --> 3:20:51.220]  trade dot com
[3:20:51.220 --> 3:20:53.780]  have predicted an obama victory now for months
[3:20:53.780 --> 3:20:54.740]  they predicted
[3:20:54.740 --> 3:20:58.180]  uh... all of the tutorial and how to representative victory is much more
[3:20:58.180 --> 3:20:59.140]  accurately
[3:20:59.140 --> 3:21:01.460]  then you have the polling of the pundits
[3:21:01.460 --> 3:21:04.180]  so this is a show that's based on that concept
[3:21:04.180 --> 3:21:07.260]  and bringing those prediction markets to a global audience
[3:21:07.260 --> 3:21:08.660]  on bbc world
[3:21:08.660 --> 3:21:10.660]  and i mentioned before the break
[3:21:10.660 --> 3:21:14.260]  uh... it'd be great to have you on the show of course because your insights
[3:21:14.260 --> 3:21:18.300]  into how these uh... various world pieces work together
[3:21:18.300 --> 3:21:20.140]  on on the brand would issue
[3:21:20.140 --> 3:21:21.660]  this is something that
[3:21:21.660 --> 3:21:22.980]  if you just look at it
[3:21:22.980 --> 3:21:26.780]  uh... from any kind of perspective other than the myopic
[3:21:26.780 --> 3:21:29.820]  inside the u s perspective
[3:21:29.820 --> 3:21:33.500]  you'll see that quite clearly the appetite of the global community for u
[3:21:33.500 --> 3:21:35.060]  s dollars is diminishing
[3:21:35.060 --> 3:21:38.900]  and at the u s rolls over trillions of dollars with the paper every single
[3:21:38.900 --> 3:21:41.660]  quarter if they can't refine at the paper
[3:21:41.660 --> 3:21:44.380]  uh... the u s would immediately go bankrupt
[3:21:44.380 --> 3:21:46.060]  the only way to get a piece
[3:21:46.060 --> 3:21:47.420]  these foreign creditors
[3:21:47.420 --> 3:21:51.540]  is to give them formal bone either that either they devalue the dollar
[3:21:51.540 --> 3:21:53.700]  or they have to give them california
[3:21:53.700 --> 3:21:56.420]  you know they have to give them something so what will that new piece
[3:21:56.420 --> 3:22:00.860]  what will that new currency max keiser look like
[3:22:00.860 --> 3:22:02.500]  but that that
[3:22:02.500 --> 3:22:06.660]  well uh... you know that the new dollar currency and i know that there's a lot
[3:22:06.660 --> 3:22:10.560]  of talk about that the amir of course the north american currency
[3:22:10.560 --> 3:22:13.700]  i'm i'm i'm not certain that's what's gonna happen
[3:22:13.700 --> 3:22:15.460]  first but you know that
[3:22:15.460 --> 3:22:17.820]  i think before we see something like that
[3:22:17.820 --> 3:22:19.060]  you're going to see
[3:22:19.060 --> 3:22:22.980]  a simply uh... you know that the u s has gotten very very good at you know
[3:22:22.980 --> 3:22:25.780]  issuing these new currencies in the last couple years remember they just came
[3:22:25.780 --> 3:22:29.220]  out of peach colored currency uh... and yes colored five people
[3:22:29.220 --> 3:22:32.500]  and they keep saying we we need it for the security but basically they're just
[3:22:32.500 --> 3:22:33.700]  it's a dry run
[3:22:33.700 --> 3:22:37.060]  the conditioning has to accept a new color and you look young
[3:22:37.060 --> 3:22:40.580]  exactly so this is just a dry one of the needs of the issue of new curfew
[3:22:40.580 --> 3:22:42.960]  uh... with the frequency that they do
[3:22:42.960 --> 3:22:46.300]  they're just a detestable technology and they're getting us ready to recall all
[3:22:46.300 --> 3:22:47.540]  the old notes and
[3:22:47.540 --> 3:22:51.140]  everybody's got a mattress to wait to say that they're worthless
[3:22:51.140 --> 3:22:53.980]  you know exactly that i was sure during the year i had a year old
[3:22:53.980 --> 3:22:56.140]  in one day yet a french frank
[3:22:56.140 --> 3:23:00.060]  it's no good yet that you have to have a year old will max do this obviously i'd
[3:23:00.060 --> 3:23:01.820]  be honored to come on your show
[3:23:01.820 --> 3:23:05.500]  anytime we're really honored and and very respectful appreciative of your

[3:23:14.020 --> 3:23:17.900]  here on the show so maybe maybe you can help us set that up to promote of the
[3:23:17.900 --> 3:23:20.700]  tv show when it's coming up
[3:23:20.700 --> 3:23:24.100]  well uh... you know we're gonna focus on the tv show and as you know we're
[3:23:24.100 --> 3:23:25.900]  also share a venue

[3:23:35.740 --> 3:23:38.220]  excellent value press tv as you point out today
[3:23:38.220 --> 3:23:40.820]  it's an international audience it's based in
[3:23:40.820 --> 3:23:44.140]  iran but you know there's a lot of going back to the full audience i'm gonna say
[3:23:44.140 --> 3:23:51.140]  about you here to the full audience here we go

[3:24:09.660 --> 3:24:11.540]  max kaiser in closing
[3:24:11.540 --> 3:24:15.060]  fire your website again and tell us if you think uh... this country's ever gonna
[3:24:15.060 --> 3:24:16.300]  emerge
[3:24:16.300 --> 3:24:19.820]  in the next decade out of what we're facing
[3:24:19.820 --> 3:24:21.900]  right max kaiser dot com
[3:24:21.900 --> 3:24:26.940]  m-a-x-k-e-i-s-e-r there's a link also to the radio show that we do i do a pod
[3:24:26.940 --> 3:24:28.500]  show with stacey
[3:24:28.500 --> 3:24:32.900]  who's uh... my uh... my significant other i guess you could call her my love of
[3:24:32.900 --> 3:24:33.780]  my life
[3:24:33.780 --> 3:24:37.500]  and we do a daily show plus we have a weekly show on residents one of four
[3:24:37.500 --> 3:24:38.380]  point four
[3:24:38.380 --> 3:24:39.740]  the truth about markets
[3:24:39.740 --> 3:24:41.300]  but the uh...
[3:24:41.300 --> 3:24:44.460]  the question about the future of the dollar in the currency as we were just
[3:24:44.460 --> 3:24:45.620]  discussing it
[3:24:45.620 --> 3:24:50.540]  it's not that hard to simply reissue a currency and to give the uh... and and
[3:24:50.540 --> 3:24:53.420]  it has a different value different serial numbers we've already seen new
[3:24:53.420 --> 3:24:57.020]  issues new currencies issued in the u.s. a few times over the past few years
[3:24:57.020 --> 3:25:00.140]  different colors different can can figure it out is ready bottom line get
[3:25:00.140 --> 3:25:03.300]  into gold now because you're saying you you think all the evidence shows is
[3:25:03.300 --> 3:25:07.780]  going to double by win
[3:25:07.780 --> 3:25:11.060]  when it does double for the two points when it does double
[3:25:11.060 --> 3:25:14.620]  i have a very strong belief that it'll happen so fast
[3:25:14.620 --> 3:25:17.820]  that you don't already own it you won't be able to buy it it'll be too late you
[3:25:17.820 --> 3:25:20.220]  can buy right now
[3:25:20.220 --> 3:25:25.060]  well yeah well i mean you can buy it just a print and you can buy for example
[3:25:25.060 --> 3:25:29.180]  all uh... you know i think if you go to a site like gold money dot com okay
[3:25:29.180 --> 3:25:30.740]  gold money dot com
[3:25:30.740 --> 3:25:35.220]  uh... you go to that site you can buy gold and it's stored in either london or
[3:25:35.220 --> 3:25:40.060]  switzerland it's allocated gold in your name held outside the united states you
[3:25:40.060 --> 3:25:43.220]  can go collect the gold if you want any time you want to it's uh... i know
[3:25:43.220 --> 3:25:46.900]  gold money dot com is one by going to james turk he's a reputable guy the
[3:25:46.900 --> 3:25:50.700]  fact i have an account there myself he's offended you know full disclosure he's a
[3:25:50.700 --> 3:25:55.140]  fantastic guy he holds the gold if you get the current price you know that's it
[3:25:55.140 --> 3:25:59.420]  you now have some gold it gives you peace of mind and these currencies
[3:25:59.420 --> 3:26:04.460]  unfortunately all the banking fraud that it happened in the last twenty five
[3:26:04.460 --> 3:26:05.940]  years
[3:26:05.940 --> 3:26:09.780]  going to start with mike milking mike looking really ushered in the nineteen
[3:26:09.780 --> 3:26:12.100]  eighties a period of
[3:26:12.100 --> 3:26:15.860]  that has just built up over twenty five years in the long-term capital
[3:26:15.860 --> 3:26:19.780]  management with another huge chapter now it's all coming to a head max let's
[3:26:19.780 --> 3:26:23.220]  i get you back up in the in the near future i appreciate you coming on with
[3:26:23.220 --> 3:26:25.380]  us and we'll talk to you soon
[3:26:25.380 --> 3:26:26.580]  but i think that
[3:26:26.580 --> 3:26:30.860]  you better goes max kaiser boy that guy is something else he's involved in just
[3:26:30.860 --> 3:26:34.500]  so he really did invent a bunch of uh... some of the most modern systems that are
[3:26:34.500 --> 3:26:35.580]  used today
[3:26:35.580 --> 3:26:37.940]  he's got his fingers and everything
[3:26:37.940 --> 3:26:40.900]  as he's got his fingers in this show now we're glad to have our fingers in what
[3:26:40.900 --> 3:26:43.580]  he's doing very very interesting person uh...
[3:26:43.580 --> 3:26:45.980]  and i think it's fine in dandy if you live in europe to have it one of their
[3:26:45.980 --> 3:26:48.460]  vaults and i've got vaults in the u.s. but he's right
[3:26:48.460 --> 3:26:51.140]  gold has been confiscated before people always ask me this
[3:26:51.140 --> 3:26:53.740]  well then why would you hold gold
[3:26:53.740 --> 3:26:56.940]  whether buried in the field or in a safety deposit box
[3:26:56.940 --> 3:27:01.060]  point is it's better than the money in a bank they can just sees or money they
[3:27:01.060 --> 3:27:02.260]  can devalue
[3:27:02.260 --> 3:27:06.300]  there's nothing better than holding gold and silver physically and you heard
[3:27:06.300 --> 3:27:09.420]  him you know gold's at seven fifty or whatever right now it's actually going
[3:27:09.420 --> 3:27:10.780]  up today
[3:27:10.780 --> 3:27:15.180]  just like oil shot up seven bucks today
[3:27:15.180 --> 3:27:18.260]  when it does go up and it will because the dollar devaluation they've only
[3:27:18.260 --> 3:27:19.900]  manipulating things right now
[3:27:19.900 --> 3:27:23.060]  you know where you can can hardly buy it well there's a huge premium when you
[3:27:23.060 --> 3:27:24.780]  can find there's a premium
[3:27:24.780 --> 3:27:27.020]  but then gold was dropping just like oil
[3:27:27.020 --> 3:27:28.580]  this is manipulation
[3:27:28.580 --> 3:27:30.780]  uh... but uh...
[3:27:30.780 --> 3:27:34.260]  when it finally does go back up which law of
[3:27:34.260 --> 3:27:36.860]  supply and demand says they can suppress it forever
[3:27:36.860 --> 3:27:39.660]  it is good to physically hold it and sure i mean the government can come take
[3:27:39.660 --> 3:27:42.220]  your housing and take your life and come take your guns
[3:27:42.220 --> 3:27:45.500]  i'm still going on guns by more guns even if they're gonna try to come take
[3:27:45.500 --> 3:27:46.060]  them
[3:27:46.060 --> 3:27:47.980]  whole point is you don't give it up
[3:27:47.980 --> 3:27:50.340]  whole point is you don't have it in the state you're in
[3:27:50.340 --> 3:27:53.460]  the whole point is uh... that uh... let's bring ten Anderson up for this
[3:27:53.460 --> 3:27:55.300]  segment of the next and i'm gonna
[3:27:55.300 --> 3:27:59.140]  get uh... dean barkley to pop in and then your phone calls
[3:27:59.140 --> 3:28:02.460]  tell you because you've been in this business so long you have gold and
[3:28:02.460 --> 3:28:03.220]  silver
[3:28:03.220 --> 3:28:04.580]  and you have it at
[3:28:04.580 --> 3:28:08.100]  below the prices it's selling at instead of giant premiums and
[3:28:08.100 --> 3:28:10.940]  i agree with max keiser people are insane
[3:28:10.940 --> 3:28:14.740]  if they don't get gold but i wouldn't trust really any bank or any fault i
[3:28:14.740 --> 3:28:15.940]  would hold it
[3:28:15.940 --> 3:28:18.940]  you're right about that you should have it in your possession plus also one of
[3:28:18.940 --> 3:28:22.220]  the things you have to remember alex that most of the european countries
[3:28:22.220 --> 3:28:24.780]  confiscated illegalized gold as well
[3:28:24.780 --> 3:28:27.780]  as a matter of fact the united states was one of the first nations to make
[3:28:27.780 --> 3:28:29.140]  gold legal to own
[3:28:29.140 --> 3:28:31.940]  and if you had gold traveling through other countries you had to be very
[3:28:31.940 --> 3:28:32.860]  careful
[3:28:32.860 --> 3:28:34.620]  because you'd be breaking their laws
[3:28:34.620 --> 3:28:36.300]  we are actually one of the more
[3:28:36.300 --> 3:28:39.780]  believe it or not liberated states still are countries in you know about
[3:28:39.780 --> 3:28:40.940]  all engulf
[3:28:40.940 --> 3:28:44.060]  at this time i'm sure that those countries if anybody's going to
[3:28:44.060 --> 3:28:46.540]  confiscate gold it's going to be europe first
[3:28:46.540 --> 3:28:49.060]  i'm sure the soviet blocks gonna follow
[3:28:49.060 --> 3:28:52.460]  and uh... yeah you got you gotta be careful with these nations because
[3:28:52.460 --> 3:28:55.460]  i trust them less than i trust the united states and i don't trust this
[3:28:55.460 --> 3:28:58.380]  place very much at all
[3:28:58.380 --> 3:29:01.380]  john i want you to get dean barkley on about eight afterwards can do five
[3:29:01.380 --> 3:29:04.580]  minutes of them i want to hold head over and talk about what he's seeing as
[3:29:04.580 --> 3:29:06.700]  thirty years in the golden silver market
[3:29:06.700 --> 3:29:09.780]  twelve years was thirteen years with the modest resources
[3:29:09.780 --> 3:29:12.460]  what he's seeing happen right now because it's even admitted
[3:29:12.460 --> 3:29:15.460]  mainstream news that they are manipulating the golden silver market
[3:29:15.460 --> 3:29:19.460]  and you know things are only set to go back up the skies the limit
[3:29:19.460 --> 3:29:24.420]  i'm gonna skip this break the input i want to keep talking to tell john okay
[3:29:24.420 --> 3:29:27.220]  they said
[3:29:27.220 --> 3:29:31.260]  is a tad since he's in studio they're able to hear me when i skip breaks john
[3:29:31.260 --> 3:29:33.900]  that we should go ahead already run off
[3:29:33.900 --> 3:29:36.900]  they tell you there
[3:29:36.900 --> 3:29:39.380]  and go on there and get it put a set back on
[3:29:39.380 --> 3:29:42.340]  he's going back in studio right now okay great
[3:29:42.340 --> 3:29:44.020]  anyways uh...
[3:29:44.020 --> 3:29:49.940]  folks i do believe in owning golden silver and i see this down market though
[3:29:49.940 --> 3:29:52.140]  it's going back up right now the last few days
[3:29:52.140 --> 3:29:53.460]  as all commodities are
[3:29:53.460 --> 3:29:56.100]  i mean wheat selling at what four times what was a year ago
[3:29:56.100 --> 3:29:58.940]  i see this is a buying opportunity
[3:29:58.940 --> 3:30:00.860]  and i think people are insane
[3:30:00.860 --> 3:30:03.660]  if they don't buy golden silver and we're gonna we're gonna pitch folks on this
[3:30:03.660 --> 3:30:04.380]  tad
[3:30:04.380 --> 3:30:05.660]  when we get back
[3:30:05.660 --> 3:30:08.860]  and the blusher sleep good at night knowing that because i bought gold was
[3:30:08.860 --> 3:30:10.860]  two hundred eighty bucks an hour out
[3:30:10.860 --> 3:30:14.380]  i bought it was a thousand dollars an ounce i bought it was six hundred dollars an ounce
[3:30:14.380 --> 3:30:15.860]  uh... and uh...
[3:30:15.860 --> 3:30:19.820]  people psychologically only tend to buy what's going up all it is going up
[3:30:19.820 --> 3:30:22.260]  today but nothing like it can be going up in the future
[3:30:22.260 --> 3:30:24.620]  if any common sense or any reality
[3:30:24.620 --> 3:30:27.540]  range in the world
[3:30:27.540 --> 3:30:30.620]  ted kaiser was talking about gold doubling
[3:30:30.620 --> 3:30:33.740]  if they do a new britain woods agreement and kill the dollars the world
[3:30:33.740 --> 3:30:35.260]  reserve currency
[3:30:35.260 --> 3:30:38.660]  well he's right about that and i don't know how they cannot do that because the
[3:30:38.660 --> 3:30:40.700]  united states is so far
[3:30:40.700 --> 3:30:42.340]  beyond repair
[3:30:42.340 --> 3:30:45.700]  and the value of the united states currency nobody trusted
[3:30:45.700 --> 3:30:48.780]  i mean nobody trust what we're doing here in the united states this bailout
[3:30:48.780 --> 3:30:49.420]  thing
[3:30:49.420 --> 3:30:52.780]  is really bad for the united states and the value
[3:30:52.780 --> 3:30:54.500]  the value of its currency
[3:30:54.500 --> 3:30:57.580]  the value of the institutions that are out there i mean that you just can't
[3:30:57.580 --> 3:30:58.300]  trust
[3:30:58.300 --> 3:30:59.940]  the united states to be
[3:30:59.940 --> 3:31:03.140]  uh... you know it to be uh... conservative
[3:31:03.140 --> 3:31:07.620]  and and uh... economically sound because we're gonna bail out every single
[3:31:07.620 --> 3:31:09.500]  problem now that comes along
[3:31:09.500 --> 3:31:13.100]  every time there's a big company but it's not bailouts they're only giving it
[3:31:13.100 --> 3:31:17.140]  to those themselves we have the jp morgan had another saying we're just
[3:31:17.140 --> 3:31:20.740]  giving ourselves five hundred million dollar bonuses apiece and laughing in
[3:31:20.740 --> 3:31:21.740]  front of reporters
[3:31:21.740 --> 3:31:24.980]  i mean he's arrogant bastard is not enough to steal five trillion from us
[3:31:24.980 --> 3:31:27.060]  that's what it's already is five trillion
[3:31:27.060 --> 3:31:30.860]  well i think that's not enough to add they have to rub it in and brag about it
[3:31:30.860 --> 3:31:31.860]  in front of everybody
[3:31:31.860 --> 3:31:35.700]  i know it and and that's the thing about that's why there's so little trust left
[3:31:35.700 --> 3:31:38.420]  i mean what if you're sitting outside of this nation
[3:31:38.420 --> 3:31:39.860]  and you're investing in
[3:31:39.860 --> 3:31:45.060]  u s dollar and you watch the united states government come in and sign a bill
[3:31:45.060 --> 3:31:49.100]  that's going to create another trillion dollars to be injected into the system
[3:31:49.100 --> 3:31:50.360]  and then you see the
[3:31:50.360 --> 3:31:55.220]  the elites or the the uh... the c e o's and all the freezing the credit market
[3:31:55.220 --> 3:31:56.620]  so they can consolidate
[3:31:56.620 --> 3:31:57.380]  yeah it's
[3:31:57.380 --> 3:32:01.020]  it's a yet they're they're they're playing right into the hand of uh... you
[3:32:01.020 --> 3:32:03.260]  know that the people united states were
[3:32:03.260 --> 3:32:07.740]  were right we should not have done that bailout everybody nobody wanted it
[3:32:07.740 --> 3:32:10.540]  and for some reason our politicians did it
[3:32:10.540 --> 3:32:15.380]  and i i i i i hope every single person that voted for that bill is voted on
[3:32:15.380 --> 3:32:18.820]  office and i said we're gonna go back to the full audience in ten seconds
[3:32:18.820 --> 3:32:21.740]  right now we're on prison planet dot tv in the info or streams
[3:32:21.740 --> 3:32:23.340]  but i don't want to waste any time
[3:32:23.340 --> 3:32:26.020]  uh... did did you call dean barkley john
[3:32:26.020 --> 3:32:29.380]  now you know what time you want to let uh... thirty eight after you just call
[3:32:29.380 --> 3:32:31.100]  him and say we're calling in five minutes
[3:32:31.100 --> 3:32:38.100]  okay and i'm gonna take some final calls here we go
[3:32:41.700 --> 3:32:46.700]  saraswamy
[3:32:46.700 --> 3:32:52.700]  baby's great-grandchildren believe you could live to a hundred and three
[3:32:52.700 --> 3:32:59.060]  a hundred and three is forever when you're just a little kid
[3:32:59.060 --> 3:33:03.220]  saraswamy forever
[3:33:03.220 --> 3:33:04.780]  gravedigger
[3:33:04.780 --> 3:33:08.660]  there goes the republic up in flames
[3:33:08.660 --> 3:33:15.660]  a lot of work
[3:33:16.020 --> 3:33:18.180]  don't uh... usually smoke up
[3:33:18.180 --> 3:33:20.660]  cut it back to almost nothing but i figured
[3:33:20.660 --> 3:33:24.140]  kind of as a symbol of the country going up in smoke burning away as the public
[3:33:24.140 --> 3:33:24.740]  is
[3:33:24.740 --> 3:33:27.820]  suckered one more time to support uh... rock obama
[3:33:27.820 --> 3:33:31.620]  fire up a cigarette here on air
[3:33:31.620 --> 3:33:35.260]  this is okay if i was a fake christian conservative and killed a million and a
[3:33:35.260 --> 3:33:37.220]  half iraqi's in the last
[3:33:37.220 --> 3:33:38.540]  six years
[3:33:38.540 --> 3:33:45.460]  but if i smoke a cigarette i'll go to hell
[3:33:45.460 --> 3:33:48.740]  let's go back to uh...
[3:33:48.740 --> 3:33:51.860]  ted anderson and we're gonna get dean barkley on
[3:33:51.860 --> 3:33:54.500]  then some of your phone calls here at the end of some of the latest election
[3:33:54.500 --> 3:33:55.460]  news
[3:33:55.460 --> 3:33:57.500]  as it uh... comes in
[3:33:57.500 --> 3:33:59.780]  for everybody
[3:33:59.780 --> 3:34:02.700]  uh... ten years and we were running and raving on the internet behind the scenes
[3:34:02.700 --> 3:34:04.500]  portion of the show
[3:34:04.500 --> 3:34:08.500]  uh... they're about the banker takeover uh... and we were talking about is the
[3:34:08.500 --> 3:34:09.980]  open arrogance
[3:34:09.980 --> 3:34:11.500]  the biggest looting ever
[3:34:11.500 --> 3:34:13.500]  offshore corporations
[3:34:13.500 --> 3:34:16.140]  and they're openly manipulating the gold market
[3:34:16.140 --> 3:34:19.700]  and uh... now the hyperinflation is kicking back off again ten
[3:34:19.700 --> 3:34:22.700]  yeah uh... we're gonna see an awful lot of that because we all know that we're
[3:34:22.700 --> 3:34:24.500]  gonna have inflation you can't sit
[3:34:24.500 --> 3:34:27.180]  and injected other trillion dollars into the system
[3:34:27.180 --> 3:34:30.700]  without having a devaluation the money that already exists out there
[3:34:30.700 --> 3:34:32.460]  we have earned it we've worked for it
[3:34:32.460 --> 3:34:34.100]  and now they're printing money
[3:34:34.100 --> 3:34:37.420]  for nothing and they're given away to these
[3:34:37.420 --> 3:34:40.820]  these ceo's or whatever these big corporations and they're taking these
[3:34:40.820 --> 3:34:41.580]  big
[3:34:41.580 --> 3:34:44.180]  these big uh... distributions
[3:34:44.180 --> 3:34:47.180]  and you know they're walking away with all this profit they're using it to buy
[3:34:47.180 --> 3:34:49.340]  up all the small institutions that are
[3:34:49.340 --> 3:34:51.260]  that are struggling in the marketplace
[3:34:51.260 --> 3:34:53.420]  they're creating huge monopolies
[3:34:53.420 --> 3:34:56.060]  and what we we the people did it
[3:34:56.060 --> 3:34:59.180]  i mean we should wake up here i mean i don't know what the heck i mean like i
[3:34:59.180 --> 3:34:59.820]  said
[3:34:59.820 --> 3:35:03.460]  if we're voting for the people that voted for that bailout right now
[3:35:03.460 --> 3:35:07.140]  uh... you know and so help me i mean i i i gotta tell you
[3:35:07.140 --> 3:35:11.260]  that that there should not be another there should not be a politician going
[3:35:11.260 --> 3:35:12.900]  back to washington dc
[3:35:12.900 --> 3:35:16.220]  that for this bailout package that was one of the worst things i've ever done
[3:35:16.220 --> 3:35:16.820]  to us
[3:35:16.820 --> 3:35:19.020]  and that and they said a precedence
[3:35:19.020 --> 3:35:20.580]  that now every time
[3:35:20.580 --> 3:35:23.380]  one of these big corporations are gonna have a problem
[3:35:23.380 --> 3:35:26.700]  they're gonna be dumping money into their you know they'll create problems
[3:35:26.700 --> 3:35:29.940]  so they can have this money i mean it's like free money to them and it's just
[3:35:29.940 --> 3:35:31.300]  creating a huge
[3:35:31.300 --> 3:35:34.980]  monstrous monopoly that's just going to come crashing down
[3:35:34.980 --> 3:35:39.100]  and and the people of taxpayers the people that actually struggle them make
[3:35:39.100 --> 3:35:41.940]  a living in this world of the ones that end up paying the bill
[3:35:41.940 --> 3:35:45.820]  it did it really burns my but i can tell you had to look at the market into
[3:35:45.820 --> 3:35:49.780]  things as a gold broker silver broker
[3:35:49.780 --> 3:35:52.140]  what's it like right now and i'm seeing a lot of places still saying they're
[3:35:52.140 --> 3:35:55.260]  sold out of gold and silver there's huge premiums
[3:35:55.260 --> 3:35:58.140]  mainstream press reports talking about fifty percent premiums you've actually
[3:35:58.140 --> 3:35:58.860]  got it
[3:35:58.860 --> 3:36:00.180]  at the price it is
[3:36:00.180 --> 3:36:03.260]  tell folks about those numbers yes sure i can tell you right now i locked into a
[3:36:03.260 --> 3:36:05.980]  whole bunch of it here at one gold was at seven twenty
[3:36:05.980 --> 3:36:09.840]  and uh... silver was sitting there right around was it was at nine dollars and
[3:36:09.840 --> 3:36:12.940]  eighty seven cents an ounce right in there when i was picking it up
[3:36:12.940 --> 3:36:16.620]  uh... right now yeah the premiums are way up there ridiculous with especially
[3:36:16.620 --> 3:36:18.660]  like silver eagles and that kind of thing
[3:36:18.660 --> 3:36:22.100]  i just ran into a nice group of philharmonics if you're interested in those you
[3:36:22.100 --> 3:36:23.140]  can get those
[3:36:23.140 --> 3:36:25.220]  but i could but what i picked up here
[3:36:25.220 --> 3:36:29.080]  is that i picked up a whole bunch of those uh... the the uh...
[3:36:29.080 --> 3:36:32.380]  the dimes because i mean you watch the economy and the way that things are
[3:36:32.380 --> 3:36:32.860]  going on
[3:36:32.860 --> 3:36:36.100]  the dimes right now are cheap you can get them at a buck sixty
[3:36:36.100 --> 3:36:39.660]  they're trading close to a buck eighty a piece here just a few months ago
[3:36:39.660 --> 3:36:44.980]  my goodness gold is up forty one dollars today it is i hadn't even looked i was
[3:36:44.980 --> 3:36:47.420]  it's at seven sixty three
[3:36:47.420 --> 3:36:50.060]  and ten cents silver is way up
[3:36:50.060 --> 3:36:52.780]  so so ted you locked in at gold at seven
[3:36:52.780 --> 3:36:56.020]  twenty one you said well that's the thing alex and then you were at what
[3:36:56.020 --> 3:36:58.700]  the service of the folks the coins you've got right now yeah right now i've
[3:36:58.700 --> 3:37:02.020]  got the british sovereign coin that coin right now is trading at two hundred and
[3:37:02.020 --> 3:37:05.580]  forty one i picked up the franks i was able to get those down below two hundred
[3:37:05.580 --> 3:37:07.700]  i've got them now at one ninety eight
[3:37:07.700 --> 3:37:11.140]  uh... that is not going to stay there because the gold prices just jumped up
[3:37:11.140 --> 3:37:14.420]  again another sixty bucks okay and you bought at the bottom
[3:37:14.420 --> 3:37:18.220]  it's up since you bought it uh... forty something bucks
[3:37:18.220 --> 3:37:21.060]  uh... regardless ladies and gentlemen this isn't like your dollar
[3:37:21.060 --> 3:37:24.460]  where they they're openly announcing brettan woods a new global currency run
[3:37:24.460 --> 3:37:25.460]  by the bankers
[3:37:25.460 --> 3:37:28.300]  that engineered all this all the financial experts are saying
[3:37:28.300 --> 3:37:30.100]  that is going to destroy the dollar
[3:37:30.100 --> 3:37:32.940]  whatever manipulation they do in the short term
[3:37:32.940 --> 3:37:36.860]  all of the history all the basic monetary fact shows golden silver
[3:37:36.860 --> 3:37:39.100]  and other commodities are only going to explode
[3:37:39.100 --> 3:37:42.900]  uh... and you do have to have physical delivery of alex and yes we do have it
[3:37:42.900 --> 3:37:46.180]  right here sitting in my safe in stock ready to deliver
[3:37:46.180 --> 3:37:47.700]  and and you know i i
[3:37:47.700 --> 3:37:51.460]  i have some people that set up ira's they put it into these institutions that's
[3:37:51.460 --> 3:37:52.180]  fine
[3:37:52.180 --> 3:37:56.340]  if you're going to speculate if you're so afraid of paying the taxes by taking an
[3:37:56.340 --> 3:37:59.180]  early distribution it's better than not having it
[3:37:59.180 --> 3:38:03.180]  but they have your gold and silver stored away and having a certificate
[3:38:03.180 --> 3:38:04.100]  that says that
[3:38:04.100 --> 3:38:05.620]  you will go somewhere
[3:38:05.620 --> 3:38:09.220]  and you have an economic meltdown like this i mean it's like having a picture
[3:38:09.220 --> 3:38:12.980]  of well tell them the gold coins in the silver coins you've got it way below their
[3:38:12.980 --> 3:38:16.260]  current price yeah right now we have again it's the a frank coin that's
[3:38:16.260 --> 3:38:19.340]  trading at one hundred ninety eight dollars per coin
[3:38:19.340 --> 3:38:21.900]  and then in addition to this we also have
[3:38:21.900 --> 3:38:25.180]  the british sovereign which is at two hundred and forty one both of those are
[3:38:25.180 --> 3:38:27.940]  just a fabulous buy at this particular time
[3:38:27.940 --> 3:38:30.260]  and the silver right now one sixty nine
[3:38:30.260 --> 3:38:32.820]  and everybody knows that the silver's been
[3:38:32.820 --> 3:38:36.580]  twenty maybe twenty five dollars an ounce to buy physical silver
[3:38:36.580 --> 3:38:40.420]  you're able to get the stuff at a really good price the market is getting hot
[3:38:40.420 --> 3:38:42.940]  again and you're not going to be able to buy it it's a
[3:38:42.940 --> 3:38:46.820]  there was a time here alex just a short time ago where you could want to any
[3:38:46.820 --> 3:38:49.980]  coin dealer across the united states and it's probably still true
[3:38:49.980 --> 3:38:54.220]  you're not going to be able to fill any order of any just significant size
[3:38:54.220 --> 3:38:57.820]  i mean you gotta be a big player in this business to get any kind of volume
[3:38:57.820 --> 3:39:00.100]  and uh... and that's just the way it is and i
[3:39:00.100 --> 3:39:03.380]  i hate to say it i mean it's not really fair but i'm gonna be out there buying
[3:39:03.380 --> 3:39:04.860]  every time i see a dip
[3:39:04.860 --> 3:39:05.940]  and uh...
[3:39:05.940 --> 3:39:08.100]  you know stocking up as much as i can
[3:39:08.100 --> 3:39:10.920]  because i want my my customers to get this stuff
[3:39:10.920 --> 3:39:14.060]  i mean this is the thing that's going to bail them out we have the kind of
[3:39:14.060 --> 3:39:15.420]  economy right now
[3:39:15.420 --> 3:39:18.580]  that you everybody knows there's a credit implosion going on
[3:39:18.580 --> 3:39:20.980]  so they're trying to print money like crazy just to you know
[3:39:20.980 --> 3:39:22.620]  and the inflation is coming
[3:39:22.620 --> 3:39:24.100]  ten let me explain what you do
[3:39:24.100 --> 3:39:25.900]  you buy gold
[3:39:25.900 --> 3:39:27.220]  when it's down
[3:39:27.220 --> 3:39:30.300]  people have an emerald to buy gold and silver unless they're buying it in bulk
[3:39:30.300 --> 3:39:34.380]  so you also pass on that discount like max keiser was saying
[3:39:34.380 --> 3:39:37.780]  you know uh... it's like eleven twelve hundred dollars an ounce for gold
[3:39:37.780 --> 3:39:39.780]  even though it says it's seven sixty
[3:39:39.780 --> 3:39:41.180]  in paris right now
[3:39:41.180 --> 3:39:45.180]  where he broadcast from where he lives so you're not paying those big premiums
[3:39:45.180 --> 3:39:47.020]  because ted is buying in bulk
[3:39:47.020 --> 3:39:51.460]  he is passing that savings on to you these are lost leaders for ted
[3:39:51.460 --> 3:39:54.580]  they have the british sovereign they have the french and swiss francs they
[3:39:54.580 --> 3:39:55.300]  have
[3:39:55.300 --> 3:39:59.900]  uh... the different silver coins from the u.s one eight hundred six eight six
[3:39:59.900 --> 3:40:01.420]  two two three seven
[3:40:01.420 --> 3:40:03.500]  one eight hundred six eight six
[3:40:03.500 --> 3:40:05.380]  two two three seven
[3:40:05.380 --> 3:40:07.140]  the brokers are there now ted
[3:40:07.140 --> 3:40:10.340]  gold is up forty one dollars and ten cents and climbing
[3:40:10.340 --> 3:40:11.820]  today how long
[3:40:11.820 --> 3:40:15.260]  can you hold the gold at forty plus dollars
[3:40:15.260 --> 3:40:18.540]  uh... below what it is selling for in the open market well i can tell you right
[3:40:18.540 --> 3:40:21.860]  now alex i'm gonna hold it till midnight tonight and i and i'll just
[3:40:21.860 --> 3:40:25.580]  honor every transaction amount of what gold does and i wouldn't be surprised if
[3:40:25.580 --> 3:40:26.900]  it's up again tomorrow
[3:40:26.900 --> 3:40:29.340]  right now i remember we're fishing around
[3:40:29.340 --> 3:40:31.980]  i knew that there was a sell-off that was occurring we're trying to find the
[3:40:31.980 --> 3:40:33.380]  bottom of the marketplace
[3:40:33.380 --> 3:40:35.620]  i believe we found that at seven twenty
[3:40:35.620 --> 3:40:38.740]  i think that we're going to be seeing gold and silver prices going up
[3:40:38.740 --> 3:40:42.060]  as as we go on here i know we talked about regardless it can't be completely
[3:40:42.060 --> 3:40:43.660]  devalued like paper money
[3:40:43.660 --> 3:40:47.340]  and it's the oldest uh... you know true wealth out there eight hundred six eight
[3:40:47.340 --> 3:40:50.740]  six two two three seven take advantage of this today
[3:40:50.740 --> 3:40:54.020]  forty something bucks under what it's even selling for when most people can't
[3:40:54.020 --> 3:40:57.260]  even find it or get it or paying huge premiums you can't beat this deal eight
[3:40:57.260 --> 3:41:00.820]  hundred six eight six two two three seven ted thanks for coming on yeah thanks
[3:41:00.820 --> 3:41:03.340]  for having me up again alex you bet uh... absolutely you know we
[3:41:03.340 --> 3:41:05.380]  know people buy gold when the markets up
[3:41:05.380 --> 3:41:08.340]  but ted has the best of both worlds he bought it when it was cheaper and is
[3:41:08.340 --> 3:41:11.860]  still offering it to you for that when everybody else is not just selling it
[3:41:11.860 --> 3:41:15.300]  for what it's currently selling at they're tacking on huge margins
[3:41:15.300 --> 3:41:18.540]  this deals great eight hundred six eight six two three seven
[3:41:18.540 --> 3:41:20.340]  i'll tell you what that's putting on these coins
[3:41:20.340 --> 3:41:22.140]  putting about three and a half percent on them
[3:41:22.140 --> 3:41:24.820]  just to pay for the transaction
[3:41:24.820 --> 3:41:27.180]  eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[3:41:27.180 --> 3:41:28.260]  cannot beat the deal
[3:41:28.260 --> 3:41:30.780]  i'm not going to keep him long just about five minutes a really busy day of
[3:41:30.780 --> 3:41:33.180]  radio and TV interviews he got on CNN
[3:41:33.180 --> 3:41:34.740]  they're calling it a close race
[3:41:34.740 --> 3:41:37.100]  with thirty seven percent undecided in minnesota
[3:41:37.100 --> 3:41:39.900]  they're deciding right now he was appointed by governor jessie ventura
[3:41:39.900 --> 3:41:43.220]  outgoing when senator wellstone died in the tragic crash
[3:41:43.220 --> 3:41:46.540]  so we can currently be called uh... you know technically a former senator but
[3:41:46.540 --> 3:41:50.140]  he was there for a month we want to send him back for six years a full term
[3:41:50.140 --> 3:41:53.740]  he's on the independent party in minnesota dean barkley wants to think the
[3:41:53.740 --> 3:41:54.580]  audience
[3:41:54.580 --> 3:41:59.380]  here you got major tv buys for his ad you can uh... watch at senator barkley
[3:41:59.380 --> 3:42:00.900]  dot com we also have it
[3:42:00.900 --> 3:42:03.820]  up at info wars dot com you help finish producing it
[3:42:03.820 --> 3:42:06.820]  and getting it on the air late last week and right through to today
[3:42:06.820 --> 3:42:10.740]  so i want to just bring dean barkley up for five minutes uh... dean good to have
[3:42:10.740 --> 3:42:11.660]  you here
[3:42:11.660 --> 3:42:13.340]  on that to be on alex
[3:42:13.340 --> 3:42:16.020]  i tell you i just want to thank my audience and i know you want a chance
[3:42:16.020 --> 3:42:17.140]  again to thank him
[3:42:17.140 --> 3:42:20.620]  uh... because regardless of what happens it was another example of taking action
[3:42:20.620 --> 3:42:23.580]  the way they came in and and and gave the campaign
[3:42:23.580 --> 3:42:26.860]  well absolutely i mean your listeners gave our campaign the boost
[3:42:26.860 --> 3:42:29.820]  we needed we've been up on the air since last thursday
[3:42:29.820 --> 3:42:33.580]  uh... the ads are going over very very well it's just a boost i needed
[3:42:33.580 --> 3:42:36.460]  and who knows what's going to happen today about the minnesota voters are
[3:42:36.460 --> 3:42:37.500]  going to
[3:42:37.500 --> 3:42:41.820]  in the future they want
[3:42:41.820 --> 3:42:43.260]  dean uh...
[3:42:43.260 --> 3:42:46.940]  i mean what info can you give us uh... i mean the polls are all over the map it
[3:42:46.940 --> 3:42:49.580]  shows you've narrowed in some of them but regardless you have all of the
[3:42:49.580 --> 3:42:51.300]  ventura was eight points behind
[3:42:51.300 --> 3:42:53.940]  on election day and then one by what three points
[3:42:53.940 --> 3:42:54.980]  i mean
[3:42:54.980 --> 3:42:56.300]  uh... but
[3:42:56.300 --> 3:42:59.580]  as the results are coming in when are they saying we're going to hear
[3:42:59.580 --> 3:43:03.420]  in minnesota some of the results i know it's going to be the reported record
[3:43:03.420 --> 3:43:05.300]  turnout in minnesota
[3:43:05.300 --> 3:43:08.940]  uh... we already heard from early exit polling from the actually the early
[3:43:08.940 --> 3:43:10.380]  voting we had minnesota
[3:43:10.380 --> 3:43:14.140]  and we're doing phenomenally well in the early voting we're in the low thirties
[3:43:14.140 --> 3:43:17.460]  in the in the exit polling and that was in the metropolitan minneapolis area
[3:43:17.460 --> 3:43:19.260]  which is very strong democratic
[3:43:19.260 --> 3:43:22.300]  territory and that's in a three-way race that's in a three-way
[3:43:22.300 --> 3:43:24.900]  right that's in the three-way race i'm in position here
[3:43:24.900 --> 3:43:28.020]  anything that happened we're gonna have a record turnout minnesota
[3:43:28.020 --> 3:43:30.900]  they're predicting over eighty percent voter turnout
[3:43:30.900 --> 3:43:33.780]  and that means about forty percent of those people showing up have not been
[3:43:33.780 --> 3:43:37.140]  pulled they haven't been counted in depending on what those forty percent
[3:43:37.140 --> 3:43:40.140]  do they're gonna elect the next uh... senator from in a photo i'm very
[3:43:40.140 --> 3:43:40.980]  confident
[3:43:40.980 --> 3:43:44.940]  we may shock the world here again every ten years of so we need a shock
[3:43:44.940 --> 3:43:47.860]  it's a big deal to send somebody to the u.s senate you've been there before you
[3:43:47.860 --> 3:43:50.820]  need to go back this time for a full term as i said earlier
[3:43:50.820 --> 3:43:52.460]  the only thing that may kill you
[3:43:52.460 --> 3:43:55.180]  anything i'm worried about is mindless
[3:43:55.180 --> 3:43:57.540]  party voting straight ticket voting
[3:43:57.540 --> 3:44:01.500]  where somebody just lazily clicks for a whole party republican democrat i hope
[3:44:01.500 --> 3:44:04.500]  they take the time out to go through all those races
[3:44:04.500 --> 3:44:08.500]  and i hope they vote a split ticket and i hope they vote for dean barkley
[3:44:08.500 --> 3:44:11.540]  well you know i know a lot of people in minnesota now are thinking they like me
[3:44:11.540 --> 3:44:13.860]  they like what i'm saying they want to vote for me
[3:44:13.860 --> 3:44:17.060]  but they're afraid that if they vote for me they might get either franken or
[3:44:17.060 --> 3:44:17.820]  colman
[3:44:17.820 --> 3:44:20.540]  i'm saying vote for your first choice out of what you want
[3:44:20.540 --> 3:44:23.300]  not out of your second choice out of fear of the third choice
[3:44:23.300 --> 3:44:25.740]  you know for what you know i vote for who you want to do
[3:44:25.740 --> 3:44:28.980]  or who you want to send there and if they do that i will go if they don't i
[3:44:28.980 --> 3:44:31.540]  want it that simple if they vote their heart
[3:44:31.540 --> 3:44:34.860]  of what they really want then i'll be your next to a senator but i don't know
[3:44:34.860 --> 3:44:37.060]  what the minnesota border they're going to do but i have confidence they're
[3:44:37.060 --> 3:44:38.100]  going to do the right thing
[3:44:38.100 --> 3:44:41.700]  well it's like governor ventura always says don't vote like it's a horse race
[3:44:41.700 --> 3:44:44.180]  for who you think the winner will be vote for the person
[3:44:44.180 --> 3:44:47.820]  they'll say no to the bailout no to the war no to the war on drugs
[3:44:47.820 --> 3:44:50.940]  no to the new world order dean barkley will do all of that
[3:44:50.940 --> 3:44:52.900]  and uh... regardless of what happens
[3:44:52.900 --> 3:44:56.260]  uh... want to get you back up the next few days talk about the aftermath when
[3:44:56.260 --> 3:44:57.420]  loser draw
[3:44:57.420 --> 3:45:01.220]  and regardless we win by taking action so i salute the listeners

[3:47:19.340 --> 3:47:19.940]  uh...
[3:47:19.940 --> 3:47:21.980]  with that being said uh...
[3:47:21.980 --> 3:47:25.900]  uh... there are some of the echo like uh... being that the new orders predominantly
[3:47:25.900 --> 3:47:27.420]  predominantly white
[3:47:27.420 --> 3:47:28.340]  uh...
[3:47:28.340 --> 3:47:32.020]  what do you think their plans are for the black leaders they used to do whatever
[3:47:32.020 --> 3:47:32.980]  they do
[3:47:32.980 --> 3:47:36.020]  with a long-term plan for those uh... well i agree in fact that's a point i
[3:47:36.020 --> 3:47:39.620]  meant to make in the first hour for an article we're writing about this
[3:47:39.620 --> 3:47:40.900]  uh...
[3:47:40.900 --> 3:47:41.780]  this
[3:47:41.780 --> 3:47:45.900]  barack obama is coming into office when the economy is imploding when everything's
[3:47:45.900 --> 3:47:48.700]  falling apart when the dollar is dying
[3:47:48.700 --> 3:47:51.900]  and so there's going to be a honeymoon and then he's going to get blamed for all
[3:47:51.900 --> 3:47:52.700]  of it
[3:47:52.700 --> 3:47:55.580]  and the image in people's minds is going to be okay
[3:47:55.580 --> 3:47:57.980]  hundred and forty years after slavery was abolished
[3:47:57.980 --> 3:48:01.140]  we get a black president look what happens when the guys a puppet and did
[3:48:01.140 --> 3:48:02.820]  none of it runs none of it
[3:48:02.820 --> 3:48:05.300]  and they're going to all this evil in his name
[3:48:05.300 --> 3:48:07.740]  and then blacks are going to blame for that just like
[3:48:07.740 --> 3:48:12.980]  texans got blamed for george bush when he's not from texas
[3:48:12.980 --> 3:48:16.260]  and why is it that the black path is you've mentioned mentioned that the black
[3:48:16.260 --> 3:48:19.860]  path is a blocking white from floating what is that about well no i i i just
[3:48:19.860 --> 3:48:22.100]  reported it is the top of the drugs report
[3:48:22.100 --> 3:48:23.820]  and i said it's from fox news
[3:48:23.820 --> 3:48:26.520]  so i said it may not be true
[3:48:26.520 --> 3:48:27.820]  all okay
[3:48:27.820 --> 3:48:31.020]  and also uh...
[3:48:31.020 --> 3:48:31.900]  uh... if
[3:48:31.900 --> 3:48:33.460]  if the if the dollar
[3:48:33.460 --> 3:48:36.020]  completely collapsed about the economy completely collapsed
[3:48:36.020 --> 3:48:38.280]  do you think that that means the complete
[3:48:38.280 --> 3:48:40.300]  end of america
[3:48:40.300 --> 3:48:43.940]  it means a hardcore police state government control of jobs
[3:48:43.940 --> 3:48:46.700]  hellish consolidation all by design
[3:48:46.700 --> 3:48:49.880]  and it will be up to the people whether we ever get out of it or not uh... the
[3:48:49.880 --> 3:48:52.420]  government needs confidence it needs to have leaders
[3:48:52.420 --> 3:48:54.580]  that's like a lot of third world countries are being loaded
[3:48:54.580 --> 3:48:58.140]  they'll have another president every six months like all change change change
[3:48:58.140 --> 3:49:01.600]  just to stall the people all the bankers are stealing everything
[3:49:01.600 --> 3:49:03.660]  and and that's pretty much what i see
[3:49:03.660 --> 3:49:07.300]  brock obama as is just stalling people trying to fool on
[3:49:07.300 --> 3:49:10.860]  so that they think there's a change when the same international banks run and
[3:49:10.860 --> 3:49:11.780]  own it all
[3:49:11.780 --> 3:49:14.140]  they're the ones doing it
[3:49:14.140 --> 3:49:17.900]  but they're announcing more brigades for the american people more army on the
[3:49:17.900 --> 3:49:22.300]  streets that's going to continue under obama that would continue under mccain
[3:49:22.300 --> 3:49:24.020]  these men are puppets
[3:49:24.020 --> 3:49:26.060]  and as soon as we start realizing that
[3:49:26.060 --> 3:49:29.220]  then we can start getting some real change
[3:49:29.220 --> 3:49:33.460]  yet because um... you know alchemy and jesse jackson with his rainbow push
[3:49:33.460 --> 3:49:35.260]  coalition all they want me not
[3:49:35.260 --> 3:49:38.060]  you know when you talk about the water in the lead i mean a little water i'm
[3:49:38.060 --> 3:49:41.260]  sorry and the vaccine shots and all that stuff none of these guys i don't
[3:49:41.260 --> 3:49:42.300]  hate them
[3:49:42.300 --> 3:49:46.060]  but none of them have done anything i've taken any steps to inform
[3:49:46.060 --> 3:49:48.980]  the uh... the community to claim the rep you know about some of these things
[3:49:48.980 --> 3:49:52.860]  that's what i'm saying we're under attack the government's been taken over
[3:49:52.860 --> 3:49:57.860]  it's a military industrial complex were under martial law already basically
[3:49:57.860 --> 3:49:59.620]  with the culture in the media
[3:49:59.620 --> 3:50:02.820]  and congress being threatened with martial law that didn't submit
[3:50:02.820 --> 3:50:04.540]  and so
[3:50:04.540 --> 3:50:06.100]  all we can do
[3:50:06.100 --> 3:50:10.580]  is talk about the real issues instead of these diversions about hope and change
[3:50:10.580 --> 3:50:12.940]  and then meanwhile barack obama's owned and
[3:50:12.940 --> 3:50:14.020]  paid for
[3:50:14.020 --> 3:50:15.940]  by the very same people that
[3:50:15.940 --> 3:50:17.620]  own john mccain and george bush
[3:50:17.620 --> 3:50:19.340]  that's all i'm pointing out
[3:50:19.340 --> 3:50:21.740]  is that people are going to see change more the new world order
[3:50:21.740 --> 3:50:23.940]  i'm gonna skip this break to swing finish up
[3:50:23.940 --> 3:50:26.540]  come back with more calls and cover what's happening with the election will be
[3:50:26.540 --> 3:50:28.300]  tracking all the election fraud and
[3:50:28.300 --> 3:50:31.340]  any crises that unfold as well ionic zone
[3:50:31.340 --> 3:50:35.380]  okay let me go back and we're still on prison planet dot tv on the info wars
[3:50:35.380 --> 3:50:37.340]  dot com streams mike
[3:50:37.340 --> 3:50:40.260]  uh... you know this hurts me
[3:50:40.260 --> 3:50:41.980]  you're still there right mike
[3:50:41.980 --> 3:50:46.820]  yet because because i'm so angry with the government the engineers the eugenicist
[3:50:46.820 --> 3:50:48.620]  the new world order crowd
[3:50:48.620 --> 3:50:53.860]  that i know a racist i know we're evil i know put a hiv in the in the back scenes
[3:50:53.860 --> 3:50:56.780]  not just in africa but that's where they really focus things
[3:50:56.780 --> 3:50:58.940]  i know they hate black people
[3:50:58.940 --> 3:51:00.780]  especially for some reason
[3:51:00.780 --> 3:51:04.500]  and so then i see him with barack obama and then i see him bought and paid for
[3:51:04.500 --> 3:51:05.740]  by the same people
[3:51:05.740 --> 3:51:07.020]  and then i see
[3:51:07.020 --> 3:51:10.220]  you know compared to bush he looks great he's you know seems nicer friendlier
[3:51:10.220 --> 3:51:11.220]  smarter
[3:51:11.220 --> 3:51:13.940]  you know i'm so sick of george bush i love seeing somebody that at least can
[3:51:13.940 --> 3:51:16.420]  talk nice because it you know that doesn't make me feel like a
[3:51:16.420 --> 3:51:20.100]  like i'm being insulted with some stuttering drug addict moron like george
[3:51:20.100 --> 3:51:21.060]  bush
[3:51:21.060 --> 3:51:22.940]  but at the same time i know
[3:51:22.940 --> 3:51:26.220]  that he's new world order and i know it's going in bad
[3:51:26.220 --> 3:51:29.540]  and i got so many black folks and white liberals in emails when you're just
[3:51:29.540 --> 3:51:33.540]  racist you don't like president i could care less number one i know
[3:51:33.540 --> 3:51:36.140]  presidents are puppets so i was a white racist
[3:51:36.140 --> 3:51:38.300]  why would i care if there's some black puppet
[3:51:38.300 --> 3:51:41.380]  it and and and especially if i was a white racist i want your take on this
[3:51:41.380 --> 3:51:43.860]  i would love it that they're going to be setting him up
[3:51:43.860 --> 3:51:47.180]  and blame him for everything that's going to happen
[3:51:47.180 --> 3:51:50.980]  well i agree because then if if they do blame him as a bouquet yet a black i
[3:51:50.980 --> 3:51:53.820]  did it or either happened to his watch title
[3:51:53.820 --> 3:51:54.620]  so i can see it
[3:51:54.620 --> 3:51:57.780]  definitely go that going that route but what i don't get you know even though
[3:51:57.780 --> 3:52:02.100]  i'm a follow-up i'm i'm pretty sure we have some differences in our ideology
[3:52:02.100 --> 3:52:04.780]  i just think folk should focus we should focus on
[3:52:04.780 --> 3:52:08.900]  the things that we do agree on and that is that you have an elite out there
[3:52:08.900 --> 3:52:11.260]  who's so purposeful carlton
[3:52:11.260 --> 3:52:13.140]  do all the people are created
[3:52:13.140 --> 3:52:15.500]  unstable environment that it that they
[3:52:15.500 --> 3:52:18.580]  think that they can do that's it what's the name of the nation is long the
[3:52:18.580 --> 3:52:21.220]  final call of the trumpet what is it
[3:52:21.220 --> 3:52:24.820]  well that yeah that's the uh... paper the final call yeah but i mean that the
[3:52:24.820 --> 3:52:27.860]  i mean i remember reading eustace mullins you know ads for books about the
[3:52:27.860 --> 3:52:29.420]  private federal reserve
[3:52:29.420 --> 3:52:32.220]  don't take vaccines and don't use drugs
[3:52:32.220 --> 3:52:35.900]  the man shipping a man and be strong and have strong families
[3:52:35.900 --> 3:52:38.540]  i totally agree with all of that
[3:52:38.540 --> 3:52:40.860]  because i want all communities to be strong
[3:52:40.860 --> 3:52:45.100]  i'm a moral person i don't like seeing people do bad i'm not in race politics
[3:52:45.100 --> 3:52:46.420]  but then i see
[3:52:46.420 --> 3:52:49.220]  lewis ferrican come out and endorse obama
[3:52:49.220 --> 3:52:51.740]  but but i mean what do you expect him to do if he didn't do that
[3:52:51.740 --> 3:52:53.660]  have his congregation would quit
[3:52:53.660 --> 3:52:57.580]  uh... so i think i don't i don't i don't agree with him on that i don't i don't
[3:52:57.580 --> 3:52:58.300]  think we should
[3:52:58.300 --> 3:52:59.100]  one
[3:52:59.100 --> 3:53:00.780]  that that
[3:53:00.780 --> 3:53:02.740]  that backs up policies that are
[3:53:02.740 --> 3:53:04.700]  but that's your mental to black people
[3:53:04.700 --> 3:53:08.340]  or anybody look like what white folks love the police state in black
[3:53:08.340 --> 3:53:10.700]  neighborhoods the racist whites about thirty percent whites
[3:53:10.700 --> 3:53:13.460]  they love it don't they know that's training for their neighborhood
[3:53:13.460 --> 3:53:16.340]  i mean i mean my god if i don't have empathy for a black child being killed
[3:53:16.340 --> 3:53:17.820]  with an hiv injection
[3:53:17.820 --> 3:53:19.660]  through a polio shot cover
[3:53:19.660 --> 3:53:21.660]  i mean how would i not empathize
[3:53:21.660 --> 3:53:23.140]  i mean how would i not care
[3:53:23.140 --> 3:53:27.020]  i mean i mean the people think we can kill iraqi children but
[3:53:27.020 --> 3:53:28.700]  but then that won't happen to us
[3:53:28.700 --> 3:53:31.460]  here at home but go ahead you got the floor sir let's look
[3:53:31.460 --> 3:53:34.660]  let's go back to the full audience here
[3:53:34.660 --> 3:53:37.220]  uh...
[3:53:37.220 --> 3:53:40.340]  uh... we're back live ladies and gentlemen my sdn line is cut out we
[3:53:40.340 --> 3:53:41.780]  reconnected there

[3:53:45.780 --> 3:53:47.500]  you finish up with what i was just saying
[3:53:47.500 --> 3:53:52.900]  in the behind the scenes talk
[3:53:52.900 --> 3:53:56.740]  uh... might drop off okay mike uh... mike uh... dropped off yeah and john
[3:53:56.740 --> 3:53:59.420]  that's what we've got to keep both i sdns connected they're both constantly
[3:53:59.420 --> 3:54:00.660]  dropping now
[3:54:00.660 --> 3:54:02.740]  uh... let's take a few final calls
[3:54:02.740 --> 3:54:04.300]  uh... no pun intended
[3:54:04.300 --> 3:54:07.220]  uh... who's up after uh... mike
[3:54:07.220 --> 3:54:12.820]  borough and in minnesota borough and in minnesota you're on the air go ahead
[3:54:12.820 --> 3:54:14.620]  hello mike how are you
[3:54:14.620 --> 3:54:16.420]  good uh... go ahead here
[3:54:16.420 --> 3:54:19.060]  yeah my name is alice we go ahead yeah
[3:54:19.060 --> 3:54:22.820]  yeah i i i i just want to comment on the
[3:54:22.820 --> 3:54:25.500]  people that people said and uh...
[3:54:25.500 --> 3:54:28.820]  uh... really matter who is going to be office
[3:54:28.820 --> 3:54:31.780]  they both pretty much the same and it won't won't make a difference because
[3:54:31.780 --> 3:54:33.540]  they're both old
[3:54:33.540 --> 3:54:35.700]  but i think that the problem is uh...
[3:54:35.700 --> 3:54:37.340]  but uh...
[3:54:37.340 --> 3:54:39.220]  couple lists uh...
[3:54:39.220 --> 3:54:43.220]  so uh... you know i'm going to hear people getting uh...
[3:54:43.220 --> 3:54:46.860]  really excited about what i'm going to do this or what i'm going to do that
[3:54:46.860 --> 3:54:49.220]  well i don't know what you know
[3:54:49.220 --> 3:54:52.820]  you know that there's not been approved if you just go to the top half the
[3:54:52.820 --> 3:54:54.420]  uh... actually the
[3:54:54.420 --> 3:54:57.580]  the freedom to do all the things that he wants because
[3:54:57.580 --> 3:55:00.660]  is not exactly what he was told to do
[3:55:00.660 --> 3:55:02.020]  uh...
[3:55:02.020 --> 3:55:02.740]  anyways
[3:55:02.740 --> 3:55:04.380]  the uh...
[3:55:04.380 --> 3:55:08.020]  whole idea is to get all the people to go and vote
[3:55:08.020 --> 3:55:11.100]  and uh... recently i came across an interesting book
[3:55:11.100 --> 3:55:12.220]  that uh...
[3:55:12.220 --> 3:55:14.380]  of a gentleman that uh...
[3:55:14.380 --> 3:55:16.220]  has a really in-depth good
[3:55:16.220 --> 3:55:19.220]  work on the constitution and uh...
[3:55:19.220 --> 3:55:22.060]  process of uh...
[3:55:22.060 --> 3:55:23.660]  voting
[3:55:23.660 --> 3:55:25.260]  basically uh...
[3:55:25.260 --> 3:55:27.660]  you mentioned previously that uh...
[3:55:27.660 --> 3:55:31.420]  when people sometimes get stopped pulled over uh...
[3:55:31.420 --> 3:55:33.580]  they can get arrested for being citizens
[3:55:33.580 --> 3:55:37.500]  in the west but they're not citizens they just left alone
[3:55:37.500 --> 3:55:41.020]  uh... the whole thing is that the keyword here is citizen
[3:55:41.020 --> 3:55:45.380]  and uh... uh... this book that i'm talking about is uh... called the
[3:55:45.380 --> 3:55:47.300]  the red amendment
[3:55:47.300 --> 3:55:48.860]  it was written by
[3:55:48.860 --> 3:55:50.260]  by a person
[3:55:50.260 --> 3:55:52.300]  who spent a lot a lot of time
[3:55:52.300 --> 3:55:56.060]  uh... researching the
[3:55:56.060 --> 3:55:58.900]  that's the kind of stuff i deal with here on air that's the great thing about
[3:55:58.900 --> 3:56:00.660]  the behind-the-scenes stuff
[3:56:00.660 --> 3:56:04.260]  they got these headphones blaring so i can hear that low-collar and then that
[3:56:04.260 --> 3:56:05.660]  comes in
[3:56:05.660 --> 3:56:06.780]  uh...
[3:56:06.780 --> 3:56:07.340]  well
[3:56:07.340 --> 3:56:10.180]  yeah color i'm gonna let you go i'm i'm gonna let you go we're having technical
