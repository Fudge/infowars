[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.000 --> 00:23.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:23.000 --> 00:34.000]  Only 27 days out from the historic election, we are in the final countdown. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:37.000 --> 00:44.000]  I talk about an information overload quickening. It has officially happened in between InfoWars.com and DrudgeReport.com alone.
[00:44.000 --> 00:58.000]  I was up till one in the morning researching last night. I got up at 6am, didn't even work out today, so I could just focus on all that's coming out with WikiLeaks and my head is spinning.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  WikiLeaks has redeemed itself. They have released incredible information.
[01:04.000 --> 01:24.000]  And interestingly enough, Paul Watson is the guy up in the middle of the night every night turning this out. Out of the hundreds of huge pieces of news I have, the two top ones are emails that we first targeted and broke, which I'm very proud of Paul Watson.
[01:24.000 --> 01:37.000]  This latest data dump happened late last night. Paul's been on it all night long. Notice it's the top link on Drudge. Hates everyday Americans. That is in the email.
[01:38.000 --> 01:49.000]  We have it in her email that she hates everyday Americans. We already knew that. The better clingers that Obama talks about, the basement dwellers, the baristas that she talks about.
[01:49.000 --> 02:00.000]  And now, WikiLeaks bombshell, Hillary Clinton hates everyday Americans. Classic.
[02:01.000 --> 02:13.000]  We'll show TV viewers a document cam if you can right here. There is Hillary in her famous witch hat. And it really wasn't tongue-in-cheek yesterday when I said she's a literal demon, but I don't mean she physically came out of hell and isn't a human.
[02:13.000 --> 02:24.000]  I'm saying she acts like a demon-possessed creature, like Adolf Hitler. I mean, you know, these are evil, dark people. You can see it. You see it in their actions, but just the energy field around them.
[02:25.000 --> 02:37.000]  And the media has made a huge, big joke out of that. But everybody who's close to Hillary is horrified of her. And the emails all show that. She throws constant fits. She's vindictive. She's vicious. There's a trail of death behind her.
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  And she, quote, hates everyday Americans. We're going to get into that in a great detail.
[02:43.000 --> 02:52.000]  That article by Paul Joseph Watson with the WikiLeaks from April 2015, how much she hates Americans, is another one that broke last night.
[02:53.000 --> 03:00.000]  The Drudge Report had top story as well. Clinton campaign emails outlines effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[03:00.000 --> 03:09.000]  Now, I want to explain something to you, folks. That is a quote. It actually says, we have an effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  Remember what Gruber said? Thank God they don't pay attention. They're so stupid.
[03:13.000 --> 03:27.000]  These are the people that have filed the Clinton campaign to fake with fake names, not Jane Doe, but totally fake names.
[03:28.000 --> 03:40.000]  Trump raped me suits, and now the same people with new Jane Doe names have filed another one. And the Trump campaign says, great. We hope we get served this time, because we're going to have sanctions on the people that bring this forward, the lawyers.
[03:40.000 --> 03:49.000]  This is totally fake, and they're spamming it all over the New York Times, you name it, and they're calling it Trump bragging about sexual assaults.
[03:50.000 --> 04:02.000]  He said, no, these women come after you so hard, you could just grab them and they don't even get mad. It's a figure of speech saying they're, I mean, you look at these videos, the women glomming on them, they're just throwing themselves like it's Elvis Presley.
[04:02.000 --> 04:15.000]  You know, he first got big in the 1950s, and women are just throwing themselves with the Beatles. I mean, I'm not some Mr. Superstar, but let me tell you, it's actually not fine.
[04:16.000 --> 04:25.000]  I'm a family person, and it's craven out there, because folks will then throw themselves at you, and then later, you know, say that you're throwing yourself at them.
[04:25.000 --> 04:36.000]  So it's a very, very dangerous road, and it's what gets every great man in trouble in history, generally. But comparing what Trump's done to this is just not even the same universe.
[04:37.000 --> 04:46.000]  Hillary's orders and orders and orders of magnitude worse, and the reason I keep plugging drugs is, Info Wars and Drudge are the reason and Breitbart, we're even knowing about these leaks.
[04:46.000 --> 04:57.000]  Hillary, it's come out in new articles, WikiLeaks Crisis Continues, has ordered the media not to cover it, and most of them aren't. They're picking some little sad issue and focusing on that to deceive their viewers.
[05:16.000 --> 05:34.000]  Clinton's defenders. These are crimes terrified of enabler Hillary. In an exclusive video interview with the presidential suite of the historic Watergate Hotel, the victims of Bill Clinton's alleged sexual assault, Juanita Broderick, Kathleen Wiley, and Paula Jones got together for the first time in person to express their personal fear of Hillary Clinton,
[05:34.000 --> 05:48.000]  and to warn voters that Clinton does not stand for women's issues. Something we've been saying since day one. She doesn't care about you women. Why? Because she's a pander. She gets rapists off. She lives with a rapist. She enables rapists.
[05:49.000 --> 05:59.000]  So, on November 8th, make sure you get up off your couch and go and vote for the man who will make America great again. This has been Joe Beggs with Infowars.com.

[08:15.000 --> 08:25.000]  The news is out from the most important election in modern history, an election that may decide the fate not just of our republic but the world.
[08:30.000 --> 08:43.000]  Waging war on corruption, crashing for the lies and disinformation. I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of globalist occupied Texas, now under FEMA Region 6.
[08:43.000 --> 08:51.000]  The United Nations is now publicly taking control of major police departments and local governments under Justice Department command.
[08:52.000 --> 09:05.000]  Open World Government is being announced. The last vestiges of sovereignty are being swept away. Obama this week is ratifying on his own without Congress, the Global Carbon Tax Treaty.
[09:05.000 --> 09:20.000]  You say you can't do that. They are doing it. And the permanent bureaucracy and the regional FEMA Governors, not just here but in every other state controlled, has similar regional Governors, are now in control.
[09:21.000 --> 09:30.000]  The UK discovered this in the last decade that they were being taken under the control of the unelected group. They have begun to pull out and economic terrorism is being used against them as we speak.
[09:30.000 --> 09:37.000]  Russia has begun to pull out in the last 20 years and has been under total economic and covert military attack.
[09:38.000 --> 09:48.000]  And now the United States is entering into the same position as we battle for the life of this republic. Make no mistake, the stakes could not be higher.
[09:48.000 --> 10:05.000]  And the globalists will call any nationalist, any patriot, a traitor to their country and claim that we're agents of some other foreign power when we're fighting a foreign globalist corporate combine that is dissolving the nation states as we speak.
[10:05.000 --> 10:17.000]  Okay, get ready. There is an information overload. As I said in the first segment, if you missed it, my head is spinning at this point. It's been reported in Politico, Fox News, you name it.
[10:18.000 --> 10:31.000]  It's all linked up on info wars dot com and drugs report dot com has undoubtedly the best coverage and easiest to find across the board when it comes to the actual news videos and articles to see if yourself and the WikiLeaks themselves.
[10:31.000 --> 10:39.000]  Armies of reporters pouring through them are reporters and researchers and investigative journals pouring through it. Paul Watson's already found just incredible information.
[10:40.000 --> 10:51.000]  I'm going to get to in a moment. But first off, the White House is involved. So is Hillary campaign. They are publicly telling media do not treat this as a foyer.
[10:51.000 --> 11:01.000]  Freedom Information Act. Do not treat this. No, of course, they ignore most of the four years now. So notice people just go to hacking. This is illegal and they're implying it's criminal.
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  If you cover WikiLeaks that started 10 years ago and WikiLeaks first started leaking information.
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  And they were saying if you carry it, you know, you're going to be arrested. Well, folks in mass ignored them. And that's the essence of freedom.
[11:13.000 --> 11:21.000]  When you see something criminal, when you see globalists doing really bad things and they're using national security to hide what they're doing, they must be exposed.
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  That is our duty. So WikiLeaks releases another 1100 emails from John Podesta in third data dump in just five days. Good.
[11:30.000 --> 11:42.000]  And imagine this strategy is incredible. 27 days left. Now, the word is, WikiLeaks is going to start hitting like water torture every day. Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[11:43.000 --> 11:53.000]  It is a feeding frenzy. And then right up to the election day, 10 data leaks. I mean, that's what I'm the pattern I'm seeing. It's an exponential growth curve.
[11:53.000 --> 12:00.000]  It shows WikiLeaks has some really smart advisors. I've got to say, I kind of blew up last week and everybody being trolled.
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  But I get the fact he wasn't trolling us. He was trolling the MSM.
[12:05.000 --> 12:14.000]  Now continuing. Here's two of the big ones right now. WikiLeaks bombshell. Hillary Clinton hates everyday Americans.
[12:14.000 --> 12:23.000]  Close quote. Campaign manager John Podesta in shocking admission. This is unbelievable. It's on infowars.com right now.
[12:24.000 --> 12:32.000]  This is the article. Send to everyone you know. This is what my crew needs to be focused on. I rarely give a directive.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  But I'm saying we need to focus obviously on WikiLeaks and we need to focus on the fact that we're better clingers.
[12:39.000 --> 12:45.000]  We're horrible baristas. What's wrong with that? That's a pretty high paying blue collar job. I know baristas make 100 grand a year.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  They're good and charming at the right place. It's a hard job too.
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  The point is, is that it's insulting.
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  These folks say you can't have cars. You can't have air conditioning with their own jumbo jets.
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  These are the ultimate elitists that want to make you poor so they can disdain you. They're the ultimate classist.
[13:02.000 --> 13:09.000]  And it goes on and ties into everything else she and Obama and others have said. These are nasty people.
[13:10.000 --> 13:18.000]  Real libertarians. Real constitutionalists want to make you wealthy. We want to build a prosperous nation. That's what America was about.
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.000]  This isn't new elites keeping money and land away from the general public to control them. It's called feudalism.
[13:25.000 --> 13:33.000]  And it's been practiced by every culture from ancient Africa to ancient Japan to ancient China to ancient Europe to ancient Mesoamerica.
[13:34.000 --> 13:42.000]  It's the same thing. And every time you get a centralized class in, the Renaissance that built the structure then starts unraveling.
[13:43.000 --> 13:51.000]  And then there's a long decline. I mean when there were over 100,000 Aztec warriors, when a couple hundred Cortez's men showed up and they just killed them.
[13:51.000 --> 13:59.000]  And it's because they were so decadent, so out of their minds, so completely out of control. And it's the same syndrome.
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.000]  WikiLeaks bombshell. Hillary Clinton hates everyday Americans. Campaign manager John Podesta in shocking admission.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  New WikiLeaks. Folks, I have hundreds of these. I don't know how I'm going to do this.
[14:10.000 --> 14:18.000]  The new WikiLeaks email released just moments ago includes a shocking admission by Clinton campaign manager John Podesta that Hillary Clinton has begun to hate everyday Americans.
[14:18.000 --> 14:27.000]  Wow. See, even their own people. We have Secret Service tell us this. High-level Democrats that have told me that they don't know why.
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  I kind of made a joke about it. So she's a demon. The media took it literal because I made the joke literal. Like literally Hitler.
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  And I said the word is she stinks. She's falling down all the time. She's meaner than ever yelling, screaming.
[14:39.000 --> 14:46.000]  That's what two Secret Service agents say. An FBI agent say. And the emails of everybody that know her says this woman is psychotic.
[14:46.000 --> 14:55.000]  The whistleblower organization dumped part three of its Podesta email release today. And this has to be the most jaw-dropping revelation yet.
[14:56.000 --> 15:07.000]  Amen to that. The email sent by Podesta of just April last year contains a discussion of what talking points Hillary should use in framing her candidacy for president in order to get a good head start.
[15:07.000 --> 15:16.000]  I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans, but I think we should use it once the first time she says I'm running for president because you know everyday Americans need a champion.
[15:17.000 --> 15:28.000]  And it goes on from there. Just like Biden. As bad as he is, I don't think he's a literal psychopath. I mean he's bad. He's just a mobster.
[15:28.000 --> 15:36.000]  When he's speaking, he says I know why you don't like Hillary. I get it. Because everybody knows she stole it from Bernie Sanders.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  But go ahead and vote for her. She's better than Trump.
[15:40.000 --> 15:48.000]  What have I told you thousands of times the last year in this campaign season? Hillary doesn't want you to be prosperous. She hates you.
[15:48.000 --> 15:57.000]  Donald Trump loves average people and is an average in the street kind of guy.
[15:58.000 --> 16:05.000]  That's what everybody's told me behind the scenes for years. Give me the shirt off his back. If you mess with him, he'll turn on you very, very quickly.
[16:06.000 --> 16:16.000]  That's it. That's all that's going on with Trump. With Hillary, she doesn't give tips. She loves to get little people fired. She doesn't give Christmas presents.
[16:16.000 --> 16:24.000]  She treats everybody around her horribly. And that's the good Hillary. Not the missile secrets to China and funding jihadis and all the weirdness.
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.000]  These are bad people. Now this goes on from here. I've got to move quick. This is bombshell that goes email after email in here.
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  Just go read it for yourself. How much she hates you and your family.
[16:34.000 --> 16:39.000]  You've got David Brock and the White House run Media Matters. And the Soros Fund of Media Matters attacking me every day.
[16:39.000 --> 16:48.000]  Every day saying, Jones says Hillary hates you and your family. Jones says Hillary has it out to get you. Ha ha ha. Look, I'm dead on.
[16:49.000 --> 17:01.000]  I've been covering this woman for 21 years. I've interviewed the state police, the mistresses, the rape victims. I know Hillary Clinton.
[17:01.000 --> 17:16.000]  Okay, let's continue. Clinton campaign, this is almost as big. It might be bigger. Clinton campaign email outlines effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry just like they live.
[17:17.000 --> 17:28.000]  Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep. Put you in a trance state. You think you're part of a winning team even though Hillary wants to make you poor to control you and end the middle class for pure diamonds.
[17:28.000 --> 17:34.000]  Clinton campaign email outlines effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry and then it goes on.
[17:35.000 --> 17:42.000]  A Clinton campaign email released as part of the WikiLeaks data dump earlier today talks about the need to maintain political power by producing an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[17:43.000 --> 17:48.000]  Close quote. Producing an unaware and compliant citizenry. Close quote.
[17:48.000 --> 17:59.000]  What do we tell you every day? They want you unconscious, kind of halfway, thinking you're, you know, in charge and your lady's going to win and yeah, we're trendy and yeah, we're on the winning team.
[18:00.000 --> 18:11.000]  You're on the chump team. You're like somebody at Jim Jones' Guiana compound drinking the grape kool-aid or the cherry kool-aid when it's full of cyanide.
[18:11.000 --> 18:18.000]  You're like people in cults giving their kids over to be sacrificed. I mean, you're under mind control.
[18:19.000 --> 18:27.000]  I don't have any illusions about Trump being perfect or the, some of the bad Republicans that are around him and the rest of it, but listen, he isn't out to get us. Okay.
[18:28.000 --> 18:37.000]  That could be his campaign. Trump Pence not out to get you. I mean, that's all.
[18:37.000 --> 18:43.000]  You, you, you, I've never heard of someone this evil about to be president. Just saying.
[18:44.000 --> 18:52.000]  The email was sent to Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, my former Clinton administration official, Bill Ivy on March 13th, 2016. Folks, this is nothing new.
[18:53.000 --> 18:58.000]  I've read books by the current White House science star, John P. Holdren. I've read books by, this is a big to Brzezinski.
[18:58.000 --> 19:08.000]  I've read books by Carol Quigley, the head of Georgetown political science, was written for the State Department, where they say we want a compliant public basically in a trance.
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  So that's what we've got happening here.
[19:14.000 --> 19:21.000]  And it goes on to say in the email Ivy outlines the panic amongst some Democrats that Donald Trump's celebrity politics persona cannot be matched by Hillary.
[19:21.000 --> 19:31.000]  He is not an entertainer, not a celebrity of the Trump Kardashian mold. And then it just goes into, as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content.
[19:32.000 --> 19:43.000]  To demean government, drop civics in general conspired to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. He writes, see, they've all conspired to distract you, divert you as a permanent ruling class.
[19:43.000 --> 20:03.000]  That's why you see the State Department spokesperson and that's why you see the lawyers for the White House on Charlie Rose, which is a quote, intellectual show on PBS, just for insiders and want to be insiders to watch where they celebrate and make fun of everybody and talk about how dumb the underclass is.
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.000]  And go, thank God they believed it when we said we could keep their doctor.
[20:08.000 --> 20:14.000]  In fact, we have a compilation of those videos. We can play them again if you like.
[20:15.000 --> 20:18.000]  Dude, I know you made a long slick one, and so did McBrink. Can I just have them raw?
[20:19.000 --> 20:24.000]  You know, Gibbs saying, I was told to tell the public there's no drone program. Years after it publicly exists.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  And Rubber saying, thank God the public doesn't pay attention is dumb.
[20:28.000 --> 20:31.000]  And Charlie Rose, White House lawyers calling us dumb.
[20:32.000 --> 20:35.000]  And the State Department out going ahead saying, thank God we're so evil and horrible.
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.000]  I mean, it goes on and on. This is what they do. I've been around them.
[20:41.000 --> 20:50.000]  I had the head of the Kissinger group eight years ago during breaks saying, Alex, come to New York, Alex, come on, you're one of us.
[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  You can, you know, you're already, you know, the leader of people that question her thinking you're not one of the public.
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  You can't help them. Come up here.
[20:59.000 --> 21:00.000]  And I'm like, no.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  And he's like, I can't believe this. Well, whatever that I'm not going to complete the interview.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  I go, no, don't be a coward. Do one more segment.
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  John Herman running the show right now in my ear.
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  He's the guy. He's been on the show. He's talking about it. Heard it all.
[21:13.000 --> 21:27.000]  He's heard top people at the army and Navy joint, you know, strike laboratories from their war colleges come on during the breaks.
[21:27.000 --> 21:33.000]  I mean, like, you'll never defeat our world governor Jones. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we really should record people during the breaks, but I don't do that.
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  I'm show chivalrous, but they're so nasty. I mean, the stuff Harman's heard over the years is incredible.
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  Behind the scenes, like, you'll never defeat us.
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  Whoa. I mean, exactly nice on the air.
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  And during the break, it's like to use the Star Wars analogy where Senator Palpatine says, Hi, everybody. I'm so sweet. Oh, yeah.
[21:50.000 --> 21:56.000]  On the scene, you'll never beat us. The power of the world gather that is unstoppable. You're like, whoa.
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.000]  I told you, Gary Johnson was in here.
[22:00.000 --> 22:06.000]  I think it was earlier this year, last year he was last in studio and just acting like a lunatic during the breaks.
[22:07.000 --> 22:17.000]  And you notice if he doesn't like reporters now, he just goes, I don't care if the trolls take that a context and make fun of me, whatever.
[22:17.000 --> 22:21.000]  I don't care. That makes us bigger. People feel, oh, who's this clown? And they come find the real show.
[22:22.000 --> 22:25.000]  I'm showing you what Gary Johnson was doing during the break. I said, well, it was good to see. He's like, yeah.
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  Like, like, like, like, like he was a muppet out of the dark crystal.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  I mean, I don't know. It's like they're possessed by space aliens or something, man.
[22:34.000 --> 22:46.000]  I don't mean that literally, but they don't act like humans. Hillary, Gary Johnson, I mean, I've been around it enough where they'll be acting totally normal and totally nice.
[22:47.000 --> 22:54.000]  And then just snap. I mean, I'll build up and get mad sometimes, but they'll just have this little fake face on them just instantly go from zero to 100 flipping out.
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.000]  I'm sorry. I've only got two of the stories. I'm sorry. But how am I supposed to do this? I have probably, I'm not going to exaggerate.
[23:00.000 --> 23:06.000]  This is probably 300 articles today. Hundreds of leaks. I don't even know what to say at this point. Okay.
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.000]  Yes, he was doing that to me in the studio, what we have on screen.
[23:11.000 --> 23:19.000]  Just total disdain, total delusion. I'm in charge. I'm a God. Everybody I've run into that's super arrogant and thinks they're a God is actually a mental midget.
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.000]  And the Bible talks about a great delusion. That's what it is. These people are already tuned into a virtual reality or something.
[23:24.000 --> 23:29.000]  I don't know what, what, what planet they come from, but man, it didn't earth.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  And I mean, that is a parable, not, not literal New York times.
[23:35.000 --> 23:40.000]  So here we go. Clinton campaign email outlines effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.000]  By the way, some of these emails came out two days ago, more came out today.
[23:44.000 --> 23:54.000]  We already knew this short of been caught lying to Congress a bunch, but well, the reason he said indigable is, and I've got that in the stack is it's clearly Chelsea,
[23:55.000 --> 24:01.000]  who they're calling a brat, but she's the one going, this is illegal. I'm the head of this and I have people, I paid $6 billion a year.
[24:02.000 --> 24:11.000]  I have people telling me, give me access on this $9 billion lawsuit, you know, how to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and make this call and shut down this lawsuit.
[24:11.000 --> 24:17.000]  And they're openly telling me, Hey, I gave millions of dollars. You're supposed to do this, Chelsea. You know, Bill Clinton told me so.
[24:18.000 --> 24:24.000]  And she's like, I don't want to go to jail. We have all the emails. I was reading them this morning. It's total overload.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  And guess what? They got those deals. They want it.
[24:29.000 --> 24:35.000]  And they're like, Chelsea's going to make our staff members commit suicide because she's a spoiled brat. It is doing her job.
[24:35.000 --> 24:42.000]  No, Chelsea's actually has some soul, I think. She's in the earlier emails, you know, saying, I'm really worried.
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.000]  You know, these kids are dying of cholera. We're taking all the money. Dad, mom, what the hell?
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.000]  Now, you're still living in the $10 million penthouse. You should leave your evil family. You should expose them.
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  There's another Darth Vader analogy, but I'm not going to use it as a secret service to show up.
[24:58.000 --> 25:08.000]  I don't think she should literally throw them down the reactor shaft. But if you want to get reprieved, you need to politically throw your parents down the reactor shaft.
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  There's still time, Chelsea. You know, Webster Hubbell, it is evil as Bill. You ought to be proud he's not your daddy.
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.000]  And then it goes on. There's other staffers going, we're really hurting people. Why are we doing this? Shut up.
[25:22.000 --> 25:28.000]  I mean, he goes on and on and on and on and Hillary blowing up and Hillary flipping out and Hillary calling everyone scum.
[25:31.000 --> 25:40.000]  But meanwhile, as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  Unaware and compliant. That's the name of the game.
[25:44.000 --> 25:57.000]  The unawareness remains strong, but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, strong thinking and not just pole driven, demographically inspired messaging.
[25:58.000 --> 26:09.000]  That means race war. That's what's in all the latest emails from Soros says our plan is to bring in incompatible groups, cause disturbances and then bring in a strong central government to deal with the problem.
[26:09.000 --> 26:23.000]  And in the same accent, Brzezinski is, I concur with your analysis, launch operations, 10 billion per year, 100 billion per decade, launch operations, operation chaos, directive.
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.000]  I mean, this is beyond a James Bond movie. They all have James Bond villain voices. They all have James Bond villain past.
[26:29.000 --> 26:39.000]  The new James Bond villain that runs specter is the quantum group. That's the literal name of his criminal organization.
[26:40.000 --> 26:47.000]  And I was told by a former high level CIA person retiree who won't come on the show anymore. He just says humanity's lost and won't come on.
[26:47.000 --> 26:59.000]  He told me 50 years ago, cause his dad had been high level CIA, that specter was real and that the symbol is a hydra.
[27:00.000 --> 27:06.000]  See, that's art imitating life folks, not the other way around. And I'm just, we're sitting here with hydra running things, trying to start a war with Russia.
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.000]  Hydra's got operatives in Russia too, folks. Don't think for a minute, playing us off against each other. That's what the Rothschilds have always done.
[27:13.000 --> 27:19.000]  And we're living in a real life comic book nightmare, Armageddon. You know, the new comic book by Marvel, Armageddon.
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.000]  You know, the powerful Lord Soros prepares for global race war and nuclear war. Meanwhile, the public watches football.
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.000]  I mean, I don't need to read comic books, folks. We're in it. And we have all the proof.
[27:32.000 --> 27:39.000]  An operational directive to keep them in a trance state has been holding, but we're beginning to lose the control. They're coming out of the trance, your lordship.
[27:39.000 --> 27:50.000]  We must launch demographic operations immediately. I concur with your analysis. I mean, it's here. James Bond meetings, hundreds of them.
[27:51.000 --> 28:01.000]  All concurring with everything. You see them on the news. You see it. There's been like 50 movies about black people being tortured and killed by evil white people the last four or five years.
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.000]  Sometimes I go to the movie theater trying to see a movie like two of the movies are race war movies.
[28:05.000 --> 28:14.000]  Two of the movies are white people doing evil things to black people to conjure up a race war. I mean, Hollywood has been ordered. This is the season. Launch it.
[28:15.000 --> 28:23.000]  And here it is. We can't hold them. The trance has fallen. They're going to find out about our plan. Their plan is fluoride in the water.
[28:23.000 --> 28:41.000]  John P. Holdren wrote in 1974 the year I was born for eco science for the major global combines of UNESCO that we are going to add atoms in the water to calm and make the public servile.
[28:41.000 --> 28:55.000]  Servile. Okay, I've hit two. I literally have two hundred and ninety something left. It just goes on and on. There's more. I mean, this is just two of them. I haven't even covered them properly.
[28:56.000 --> 29:05.000]  People have so much energy. This is epic. Ladies and gentlemen, we have them. We have them now. They are in our political gun sites. Fire at will.
[29:05.000 --> 29:16.000]  You take this. I went and ate this morning at a little liberal diner in East Austin, and I had all the liberals coming over saying, you're right. You're right.
[29:17.000 --> 29:22.000]  Hillary's really scary. She's evil. Well, is Trump okay? And I go, well, he's probably a narcissist like anybody, you know, who's high powered like that.
[29:23.000 --> 29:29.000]  But I said, look, we know Hillary's pure evil. And I said, you got to get past all the trendiness and you just got to tell everybody we've got to support Trump.
[29:29.000 --> 29:38.000]  They're like, no, no, nobody's been saying that. You're right. You're on a, yeah, yeah. I mean, people need to know, man, you think Trump's involved in all this crap, all this subterfuge?
[29:39.000 --> 29:48.000]  He does whatever he wants. There's no subterfuge with Trump. There's no unless you just straight shooting. He didn't listen to hardly anybody but straight shooting.
[29:48.000 --> 29:59.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:18.000 --> 30:27.000]  Because they can't possibly fed all those refugees. Yeah, we know you can't vet them all. And yet you want to allow 55,000 Syrians to come in annually un-vetted.
[30:28.000 --> 30:40.000]  But you're going to go to this private luncheon and tell them that it's probably a bad idea to take in refugees because of the fact there could be some extremists to get in there and then come over here to America and possibly chop off our head.
[30:40.000 --> 30:49.000]  We've been saying that since day one. We need to secure the border. We need someone like Donald Trump to come in here and make America great again because the Clintons have done nothing but fell their entire political career.
[30:50.000 --> 30:59.000]  And I'm sick and tired of it. So November 8th, get your butt to the polls. Go out there. Vote. Make America great again. Let's secure those boards. This has been Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[30:59.000 --> 31:09.000]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say, secret 12-act two, supermale, brain force, prostagart, silver bullet. I use them all. They're phenomenal. They work. Buy info.
[31:10.000 --> 31:12.000]  Thank you, brother. Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[31:13.000 --> 31:18.000]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[31:19.000 --> 31:20.000]  Welcome to the Info War.
[31:21.000 --> 31:26.000]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War at the same time.
[31:26.000 --> 31:30.000]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Nacin.com.
[31:31.000 --> 31:33.000]  Why? God, let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[31:34.000 --> 31:35.000]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[31:36.000 --> 31:37.000]  What products are you taking? Are you taking?
[31:38.000 --> 31:45.000]  Everything from, uh, supermale to, uh, brain force to winter sun, uh, X2. Even got a little, uh, DNA force.
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[31:53.000 --> 31:58.000]  That's infowarslives.com or call 888-253-3139.
[32:23.000 --> 32:24.000]  Orange peel, zeolites, and others.
[32:25.000 --> 32:26.000]  Deep cleanse doesn't hold back.
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.000]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products,
[32:31.000 --> 32:35.000]  we use decades-old scientific research that puts together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[32:36.000 --> 32:42.000]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary SpyJurex herbal processing technique.
[32:43.000 --> 32:46.000]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research,
[32:47.000 --> 32:49.000]  and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[32:49.000 --> 32:54.000]  If you wish to find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing, visit infowarslives.com.
[32:54.000 --> 33:19.000]  That's infowarslives.com or call 888-253-3139.
[33:19.000 --> 33:26.000]  All right, folks, I want to open the phones up, and I'll just call them here at the time.
[33:27.000 --> 33:28.000]  I want to get your response to these WikiLeaks.
[33:29.000 --> 33:32.000]  There's hundreds and hundreds of them, and they can spend this however they want.
[33:33.000 --> 33:33.000]  Daily Caller has it.
[33:34.000 --> 33:34.000]  Infowars has it.
[33:35.000 --> 33:35.000]  WikiLeaks bombshell.
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.000]  Hillary Clinton hates everyday Americans.
[33:38.000 --> 33:39.000]  The way they're spinning it, though, is she hates to use that term.
[33:40.000 --> 33:43.000]  No, that's what she basically means from my view, but you can interpret it the other way.
[33:44.000 --> 33:45.000]  How about, though, when you get into this email I just mentioned?
[33:45.000 --> 33:50.000]  Clinton campaign email outlines effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[33:51.000 --> 33:52.000]  Here, let's read this.
[33:53.000 --> 33:58.000]  As I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics,
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  and, in general, conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[34:03.000 --> 34:07.000]  Okay, this is Ivy, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts,
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  and, of course, one of the top advisors talking to Clinton.
[34:10.000 --> 34:18.000]  He writes, as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government,
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  drop civics, and, in general, conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  Remember the New York Times articles where they say we should all work together
[34:28.000 --> 34:28.000]  basically to lie about Trump?
[34:29.000 --> 34:29.000]  You know, that's ethical.
[34:30.000 --> 34:30.000]  It goes on.
[34:31.000 --> 34:32.000]  The unawareness remains strong.
[34:33.000 --> 34:33.000]  How about the public?
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.000]  But compliance, that submission, is obviously fading rapidly.
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.000]  This problem demands some serious, serious thinking, and not just pull-driven,
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  demographically inspired messaging.
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.000]  They want racial control, and Soros says it plain out.
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  We're going to bring in Muslims that are incompatible.
[34:54.000 --> 34:55.000]  We're going to have people be put in their groups.
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  We're going to then stir them up to cause a bunch of trouble so that the population
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  then starts disliking them, and now you have divide and conquer.
[35:04.000 --> 35:05.000]  They're creating racism.
[35:05.000 --> 35:10.000]  They're creating resegregation at the high schools and colleges,
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  with the minority saying we don't want to be integrated.
[35:14.000 --> 35:19.000]  The opposite of Martin Luther King, a total betrayal of all that, whatever you thought of it.
[35:20.000 --> 35:25.000]  Now look what they're doing, and they're calling it anti-racism as they attack the language,
[35:26.000 --> 35:27.000]  the culture, everything.
[35:27.000 --> 35:35.000]  Looking at Drudge, Assange, drones, Hillary, releases another 1,000 emails from Podesta.
[35:36.000 --> 35:43.000]  How Podesta is obsessed with UFOs, how Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS,
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  which they've always known that Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding it.
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.000]  So is Hillary and Obama and NATO.
[35:49.000 --> 35:50.000]  Boom, that's big news.
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.000]  And it should be translated how Hillary worked Saudi Arabia and ISIS to fund it.
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  I mean, we've always known that, we broke that.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  Everybody knows that General Flynn, the head of defense intelligence, went public and said it last year.
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  Univision chief, Erj Clinton, to hit harder, yes, than all the race-baiting.
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  CNN Jake Tapper, and graduated Podesta.
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.000]  CNBC John Harwood, advises Tian Payne, and he was a debate moderator.
[36:16.000 --> 36:23.000]  New York Times gave Hillary veto power on quotes while running the New York Times.
[36:24.000 --> 36:25.000]  That's the real headline.
[36:26.000 --> 36:27.000]  She's the editor-in-chief of the New York Times.
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.000]  Boston Globe coordinated to max her presence in paper.
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  She was told when to smile.
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  Aid calls Chelsea, spoiled brat.
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.000]  Notice she was told when to smile.
[36:39.000 --> 36:40.000]  They have to handle her now.
[36:41.000 --> 36:42.000]  She's degenerated so much mentally.
[36:43.000 --> 36:44.000]  She was an amazing mind.
[36:44.000 --> 36:45.000]  Brazil busted.
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  DNC chief shared CNN town hall questions.
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  Oh, caught rigging the debates, caught rigging the town halls.
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  Yeah, you got actors and actresses too.
[36:55.000 --> 36:56.000]  Boom, caught.
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.000]  Confirmed.
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.000]  Leaked Sanders' dirt to herding.
[37:01.000 --> 37:02.000]  Directed the media against Sanders.
[37:03.000 --> 37:04.000]  Clinton, we already knew that, but just more proof.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  Clinton campaign had discussions with DOJ.
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  Oh, how to not go after her.
[37:11.000 --> 37:12.000]  Totally illegal.
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  Their campaign had discussions with the head of the justice
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.000]  department, Loretta Lynch.
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  And Bill Clinton had illegal discussions on the airplane,
[37:22.000 --> 37:23.000]  but it's okay because they're the bosses now.
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  We the bosses, we the bosses, just as State Department
[37:27.000 --> 37:28.000]  coordinated email release.
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.000]  So as they coordinated the email release,
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  they were coordinating with the DOJ.
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.000]  And it's come out.
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.000]  That's coming up next.
[37:37.000 --> 37:38.000]  It's come out, ladies and gentlemen,
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  that indeed there were illegal emails.
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  There were people asking for favors saying,
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  hey, I've given money.
[37:47.000 --> 37:48.000]  Now shut down this lawsuit.
[37:49.000 --> 37:50.000]  Give me this deal.
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.000]  Introduce me to the Chinese president.
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.000]  It's all here.
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of pages.
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.000]  Thousands more emails coming out every day.
[37:59.000 --> 38:00.000]  Individual emails sometimes are 20 pages long.
[38:01.000 --> 38:02.000]  We're trying to go through it all here.
[38:03.000 --> 38:04.000]  This is mind blowing.
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.000]  800-25-99-231.
[38:06.000 --> 38:07.000]  Again, Game Changer.
[38:08.000 --> 38:09.000]  New WikiLeaks confirms Hillary deliberately
[38:10.000 --> 38:11.000]  criminally deleted emails.
[38:12.000 --> 38:13.000]  That is broken down at infowars.com.
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.000]  Hillary in linked emails.
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.000]  Saudi Arabia, Qatar, funding ISIS.
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.000]  Just mentioned that, but there it is.
[38:20.000 --> 38:21.000]  There's another weird one.
[38:22.000 --> 38:23.000]  Hillary Clinton literally croaks like a frog.
[38:24.000 --> 38:25.000]  That's coming up later.
[38:26.000 --> 38:27.000]  Now, let's get into some of these other WikiLeaks.
[38:27.000 --> 38:39.000]  Man, I tell you, this is just blowing my mind.
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  It's blowing my mind that things have gotten this,
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  this crazy in this country.
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.000]  And as you just look at these unfolding,
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  it makes the head spin.
[38:48.000 --> 38:49.000]  I mean, how much more has to come out
[38:50.000 --> 38:51.000]  until she gets in trouble?
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  She can't get in trouble.
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.000]  They've got the FBI, the FBI,
[38:55.000 --> 38:56.000]  director that used to do their taxes,
[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  and from their law firm.
[38:59.000 --> 39:00.000]  They've got Loretta Lynch,
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  literally their minion.
[39:03.000 --> 39:04.000]  They've got a judge they appointed,
[39:05.000 --> 39:06.000]  Obama appointed with these reportedly
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.000]  made up child rape,
[39:09.000 --> 39:10.000]  teenager rape stories on Trump
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.000]  from 22 years ago.
[39:13.000 --> 39:14.000]  They have got their people
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  in every major agency.
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.000]  And they're saying,
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.000]  J. Johnson, all of them
[39:22.000 --> 39:23.000]  are openly coming out now with Loretta Lynch
[39:23.000 --> 39:24.000]  saying we're going to start censoring talk,
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.000]  radio, the Internet,
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  the Federal Elections Commission,
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.000]  the FCC.
[39:31.000 --> 39:32.000]  There are board members on both of them
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  that are not globalists and they're saying,
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  they're openly saying they're going to start
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  shutting everybody down.
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  And as soon as Hillary gets in,
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  she said the alt-right does not have a right to exist.
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  And folks, are you stupid out there?
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  If there was a Republican and he said,
[39:47.000 --> 39:48.000]  Michael Moore doesn't have a right to exist.
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.000]  I would say that's wrong.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  Michael Moore on many issues,
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.000]  he has a First Amendment right
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.000]  and then this president needs to be impeached
[39:57.000 --> 39:58.000]  if he makes any moves towards free speech.
[39:59.000 --> 40:00.000]  I mean, I would, 100%,
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  with so-called left, the fascist left,
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  praised Dinesh D'Souza,
[40:07.000 --> 40:08.000]  who got four friends to give a few thousand dollars
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  and didn't fill out the right pack information
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.000]  and he was sent to prison.
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.000]  And Hillary can get money from the
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.000]  communists, Chinese and Saudi Arabians,
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  that's totally illegal and it's just fine.
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  They celebrate that.
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  They call him a crook.
[40:24.000 --> 40:25.000]  They say he deserves it, blah, blah, blah.
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  I've read these different federal election rules.
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.000]  They're impossible to follow.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  It's all selectively enforced
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  and that's what they've set us up in.
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  The essence of tyranny is when it's selective enforcement,
[40:36.000 --> 40:37.000]  there's laws making everything illegal
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  except they don't follow the laws or they get waivers.
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.000]  Just like Obamacare.
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.000]  Thousands of big companies were giving Obamacare waivers.
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.000]  They don't have to get Obamacare.
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  They can keep their employees at minimum wage
[40:48.000 --> 40:49.000]  and not do it, but then everybody else does
[40:50.000 --> 40:51.000]  and guess what they do?
[40:52.000 --> 40:53.000]  They downsize or shut down and that's fine
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  because the other part of the economy that's exempt,
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.000]  it grows.
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  That's what this is.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  That's what's unfolding here
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.000]  and you've got David Brock openly run by the White House
[41:07.000 --> 41:08.000]  and run by the Clinton campaign
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  in these super packs giving money to himself
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  as a pass-through.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  They say that's illegal, but hey, so what?
[41:15.000 --> 41:16.000]  He doesn't go to jail because he's got fake Einstein here
[41:17.000 --> 41:18.000]  and as long as you're with the Democrats
[41:19.000 --> 41:20.000]  and have fake Einstein here
[41:21.000 --> 41:22.000]  and act like you're intellectual, everything's okay.
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.000]  Now let's continue here, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  800-25-99-231.
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  I've got a bunch of clips I want to get to
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  and then we're going to start going to your phone calls
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.000]  but here's some of the other news I haven't gotten to.
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.000]  Jerry Falwell Jr. said this yesterday,
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  thinks the GOP establishment leaked the Trump tape.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  It might even have been a conspiracy.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  Well, I know this and Trump knew it was too sophisticated
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  because quite from the public's dumb down on average,
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.000]  he didn't go there.
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  It's highly edited.
[41:54.000 --> 41:55.000]  He's being led on in discussions.
[41:56.000 --> 41:57.000]  I have people do this to me and try to edit it
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  and a few times even kind of halfway try to blackmail
[42:02.000 --> 42:03.000]  it's like, oh, we got this tape you saying this.
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.000]  I'm like, yeah, that's clearly edited.
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  It never gets released and, of course, it never gets released
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.000]  because it's edited.
[42:11.000 --> 42:12.000]  It's all mixed together.
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  You listen to it clearly.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  He's talking about she's married and when he found that out
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.000]  then he, you know, oh, then she's married
[42:20.000 --> 42:21.000]  so you can tell they cut there.
[42:22.000 --> 42:23.000]  He's like, yeah, they'll let you do anything.
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  He means like they're up in his face on him
[42:26.000 --> 42:27.000]  and then he can grab them.
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.000]  It's crude, it's not good.
[42:30.000 --> 42:31.000]  But compared to Bill Clinton, it's nothing.
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  He apologized.
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  Anything? No.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  The public's told to selectively only get upset
[42:39.000 --> 42:40.000]  about this in mind control.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  So Jerry Falwell Jr.
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.000]  this is GOP establishment leaked the Trump tape.
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.000]  Absolutely.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  You know why?
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  Some of the decent folks that are left and Christian right
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  are finally woken up to how evil the Republican establishment is
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  and they realize that Trump's got a lot of really good patriots
[42:57.000 --> 42:58.000]  like General Flynn and others around him
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  that are advising him who really do want to try to fix this country
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  and aren't out to wreck the nation.
[43:05.000 --> 43:06.000]  Continuing.
[43:07.000 --> 43:08.000]  This came out today.
[43:09.000 --> 43:10.000]  Did Paul Ryan's top advisor leak the Trump tape?
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.000]  And then it goes on to people connected high-level media
[43:15.000 --> 43:16.000]  saying, no, indeed, that is the source of it.
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  Was the infamous Trump tape in which the Republican candidate,
[43:20.000 --> 43:21.000]  well, yeah, it came from the Bushes,
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  made lewd remarks about women leaked by Dan Sr.
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.000]  Paul Ryan's top advisor.
[43:28.000 --> 43:29.000]  That's the story swirling around the Internet
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.000]  after Sr's wife, former NBC reporter,
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  Campbell Brown, appeared to confirm the claim.
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  Brown quoted a tweet and said,
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  Rumblings that Campbell Brown and Dan Sr.
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  were behind the Trump tape leak
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  and then replied, yep, still having fun after all these years,
[43:48.000 --> 43:49.000]  key to a happy marriage.
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  He himself later denied the claims.
[43:55.000 --> 43:56.000]  So there you go.
[43:56.000 --> 43:58.000]  The point is, is it's all a dirty trick,
[43:59.000 --> 44:00.000]  ladies and gentlemen, continuing.
[44:01.000 --> 44:02.000]  But here's the most important part I'm getting to
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.000]  in just one moment.
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  I even have friends and family that I know are smart
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.000]  on most occasions who just get into the mind control
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.000]  and they go, but the New York Times says Hillary's winning
[44:16.000 --> 44:17.000]  in early voting.
[44:18.000 --> 44:19.000]  And then you read the article and it's not even true.
[44:20.000 --> 44:21.000]  They just say it in the headline.
[44:22.000 --> 44:23.000]  I mean, they were the ones saying 94% chance of winning
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  in our algorithm. Now it's 87.
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  It's there to create the perception.
[44:29.000 --> 44:34.000]  I mean, CNN admits that they sample 46% Democrats
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  to 22% Republicans in one another.
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  Was it 42 to like 27?
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.000]  I mean, they're basically double sampling Democrats
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  and then saying Hillary wins by 15 points.
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  Well, of course, of course,
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.000]  if you've got basically double the Democrats in the sample,
[44:56.000 --> 44:57.000]  she's going to win.
[44:58.000 --> 44:59.000]  But if that's to the math, what that poll tells you
[45:00.000 --> 45:01.000]  is Trump's 10, 15 points ahead.
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  And that's why they're in abject total panic mode.
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  I read that email earlier by one of their top campaign
[45:08.000 --> 45:09.000]  advisors saying, we've kept the public in a trance.
[45:10.000 --> 45:11.000]  We've kept them in the dark,
[45:12.000 --> 45:13.000]  but they're starting to break out of it
[45:14.000 --> 45:15.000]  and we've got to do something here.
[45:16.000 --> 45:17.000]  They know you're breaking out.
[45:18.000 --> 45:19.000]  People are seeing through the facade
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  because it was Hillary's turn.
[45:22.000 --> 45:23.000]  And she's this half living,
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  obviously corrupt and evil person
[45:27.000 --> 45:28.000]  that represents the establishment
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  and they're so arrogant they try to sell us something old.
[45:32.000 --> 45:33.000]  And people know the economy's in trouble.
[45:34.000 --> 45:35.000]  They know when they say it's the greatest economy ever.
[45:36.000 --> 45:37.000]  That's what Obama said last year.
[45:38.000 --> 45:39.000]  That's a lie.
[45:40.000 --> 45:41.000]  They know all this.
[45:42.000 --> 45:43.000]  They know and they're learning more
[45:44.000 --> 45:45.000]  and the establishment's panicking.
[45:46.000 --> 45:47.000]  So what are they going to pull?
[45:47.000 --> 45:48.000]  And all they've got to do is convince you
[45:49.000 --> 45:50.000]  that it's not happening and have some scandal
[45:51.000 --> 45:52.000]  that, well, after the big scandal,
[45:53.000 --> 45:54.000]  you know, Hillary won.
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  They're just convincing you to believe it now.
[46:00.000 --> 46:01.000]  I'm on the streets of Austin, Texas,
[46:02.000 --> 46:06.000]  which is like San Francisco of Texas in many areas.
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  And almost every liberal I talk to
[46:10.000 --> 46:11.000]  is awake and really concerned and upset
[46:12.000 --> 46:13.000]  about what's happening and says, yeah,
[46:14.000 --> 46:15.000]  Hillary really freaks me out.
[46:15.000 --> 46:16.000]  You know, Trump's racist and now all this,
[46:17.000 --> 46:18.000]  yeah, but Trump's racist.
[46:19.000 --> 46:20.000]  They'll actually say, but, you know,
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.000]  he did say all Mexicans are rapists
[46:23.000 --> 46:24.000]  and he didn't ever say that.
[46:25.000 --> 46:26.000]  It's crazy.
[46:27.000 --> 46:28.000]  And I'll pull the clip up and show them
[46:29.000 --> 46:30.000]  they go, oh, I guess he didn't say that.
[46:31.000 --> 46:32.000]  They just don't want to vote for a racist
[46:33.000 --> 46:34.000]  because that's their identity that they're not a racist.
[46:35.000 --> 46:36.000]  It's all mind control.
[46:37.000 --> 46:38.000]  Somebody said that here in just a second.
[46:39.000 --> 46:40.000]  We are going to be ending a special today
[46:42.000 --> 46:43.000]  that is 23% off DNA force.
[46:43.000 --> 46:44.000]  That incident at midnight.
[46:45.000 --> 46:46.000]  It's our flagship product.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  Bio PQQ CoQ 10.
[46:52.000 --> 46:53.000]  It's got a bunch of other compounds
[46:54.000 --> 46:55.000]  that help you absorb it.
[46:56.000 --> 46:57.000]  Look at what bio PQQ does.
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.000]  And this is the true life based system.
[47:01.000 --> 47:02.000]  It's not, it's not synthetic.
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  And it's amazing as 175 clinical studies
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  extremely hard to secure.
[47:13.000 --> 47:14.000]  It has the same amount.
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  The bio PQQ serving in each pill of four
[47:19.000 --> 47:20.000]  giant.
[47:21.000 --> 47:22.000]  I guess it's bushels.
[47:23.000 --> 47:24.000]  It calculates up to like 50 cartons of blueberries.
[47:25.000 --> 47:26.000]  Just do the math yourself.
[47:27.000 --> 47:28.000]  Research it DNA force.
[47:29.000 --> 47:30.000]  It supports the broadcast.
[47:31.000 --> 47:32.000]  Thank you for all your support.
[47:33.000 --> 47:34.000]  We have an amazing formula
[47:35.000 --> 47:36.000]  of antioxidant systems
[47:37.000 --> 47:38.000]  that are all fused in
[47:38.000 --> 47:39.000]  the DNA force.
[47:40.000 --> 47:41.000]  We also have the biome defense
[47:43.000 --> 47:44.000]  probiotic.
[47:45.000 --> 47:46.000]  It's available at info wars.
[47:47.000 --> 47:48.000]  Life.com
[47:49.000 --> 47:50.000]  and we have it in regular strength
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.000]  and extra strength.
[47:53.000 --> 47:54.000]  Again, that's biome defense 25 billion
[47:55.000 --> 47:56.000]  live and active culture supports healthy flora
[47:57.000 --> 47:58.000]  23 probiotic strains or the 50 billion
[47:59.000 --> 48:00.000]  live and active cultures.
[48:01.000 --> 48:02.000]  23 different strains.
[48:03.000 --> 48:04.000]  And so one is half the price the other
[48:05.000 --> 48:06.000]  for whoever's on a budget.
[48:06.000 --> 48:07.000]  We have it available at info wars.

[48:56.000 --> 48:57.000]  female vitality.
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.000]  All of it funds this operation 888 2533139.
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.000]  And listen, we make mistakes.
[49:01.000 --> 49:02.000]  We jump the gun.
[49:03.000 --> 49:04.000]  We get things wrong.
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  Maybe 2% of the time 3% of the time
[49:07.000 --> 49:08.000]  sometimes worse when we're doing 24
[49:09.000 --> 49:10.000]  hour broadcasts or whatever.
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  But we're trying to tell the truth.
[49:13.000 --> 49:14.000]  We have a good grasp of history.
[49:15.000 --> 49:16.000]  We have an amazing spectrum of guests
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.000]  dedicated investigative journalists
[49:19.000 --> 49:20.000]  and we're one of the main clearing
[49:21.000 --> 49:22.000]  houses now of leaks and video
[49:23.000 --> 49:24.000]  and information that exposes the
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  new world order.
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  And we're not just letting the global
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  world know that force.
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.000]  We're partially guilty.
[49:33.000 --> 49:34.000]  All of us were going along with it.
[49:35.000 --> 49:36.000]  But we're pointing out though that
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  America has been swallowed and been
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  captive and it's being used as a
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.000]  power slave basically to take over
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  the world.
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.000]  And I'm saying not in our name.
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  So I want peace.
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  I want justice.
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.000]  I don't want to fight with the
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  Muslims.
[49:55.000 --> 49:56.000]  I want the radical Orthodox Wahhabis
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  but I want to defend the unborn.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  I want to promote sovereignty.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  I want to promote private property.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  I just want prosperity and justice
[50:04.000 --> 50:05.000]  just like you do.
[50:06.000 --> 50:07.000]  And we're coming together and Info

[50:18.000 --> 50:19.000]  spear.
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  Everybody says the tip of the spear
[50:22.000 --> 50:23.000]  and I wish they were.
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  Also the Hillary for President
[50:25.000 --> 50:26.000]  shirt in 27 days.
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  I'm not going to sell it anymore.
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.000]  That's it.
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.000]  We have a limited edition of

[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  America.

[51:01.000 --> 51:02.000]  Stay with us.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson of the
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  Genesis Communications Network.
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  Over the 30 plus years I've been
[51:09.000 --> 51:10.000]  in finance, I can see that the
[51:11.000 --> 51:12.000]  world economy is now at a critical
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  point.
[51:15.000 --> 51:16.000]  Unlimited money creation and
[51:17.000 --> 51:18.000]  runaway debt could trigger a
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  debt reduction or even deflation.
[51:21.000 --> 51:22.000]  Investment rarities has put
[51:23.000 --> 51:24.000]  together a survival bag of 200
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.000]  silver quarters.
[51:27.000 --> 51:28.000]  These 90% silver quarters are
[51:29.000 --> 51:30.000]  dated 1964 and earlier.
[51:31.000 --> 51:32.000]  Each quarter is worth almost $5.
[51:33.000 --> 51:34.000]  If a quarter has already reached
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.000]  $5, the trend is obviously on
[51:37.000 --> 51:38.000]  your side.
[51:39.000 --> 51:40.000]  These survival bags sell for 895
[51:41.000 --> 51:42.000]  delivered.
[51:43.000 --> 51:44.000]  Call 800-328-1860 to order today.
[51:45.000 --> 51:46.000]  Not only can these quarters be
[51:46.000 --> 51:47.000]  sold for $5, they have the
[51:48.000 --> 51:49.000]  potential to appreciate 5 to 10
[51:50.000 --> 51:51.000]  times.
[51:52.000 --> 51:53.000]  Call 800-328-1860.
[51:54.000 --> 51:55.000]  Get one for each member of your
[51:56.000 --> 51:57.000]  family.
[51:58.000 --> 51:59.000]  Call 800-328-1860.
[52:00.000 --> 52:01.000]  That's 800-328-1860.
[52:02.000 --> 52:03.000]  Why be held hostage by your
[52:04.000 --> 52:05.000]  wireless carrier for two years?
[52:06.000 --> 52:07.000]  What if you had no contract, no
[52:08.000 --> 52:09.000]  activation fees, no hidden costs,
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.000]  tracking, tracing, harvesting
[52:12.000 --> 52:13.000]  customer data or draconian
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  information?
[52:16.000 --> 52:17.000]  Call 800-328-1860.

[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  plans or build your own.

[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  Members can share up to 100% of
[52:47.000 --> 52:48.000]  necessary medical expenses,

[52:51.000 --> 52:52.000]  treatments.
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  Find out how you and your family
[52:55.000 --> 52:56.000]  can contain health care costs
[52:57.000 --> 52:58.000]  without giving up your freedom.

[53:01.000 --> 53:02.000]  That's libertyoncall.org.
[53:03.000 --> 53:04.000]  Water is the single most
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.000]  important thing your body needs,
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  so you want to be sure it's the
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  most important thing you need.
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.000]  The number of people who have
[53:13.000 --> 53:14.000]  access to the water is
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.000]  1,000,000,000 have depended on
[53:17.000 --> 53:18.000]  Burkey purified water.

[53:44.000 --> 53:45.000]  Go to drivendvd.com.
[53:46.000 --> 53:47.000]  Drivendvd.com.
[53:48.000 --> 53:49.000]  Oil spills, air pressure
[53:50.000 --> 53:51.000]  is never enough to store.
[53:52.000 --> 53:53.000]  What are you going to do
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.000]  when the zombies at your door
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.000]  are new men, new men,
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  run organically.
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.000]  America made just for you
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  whose stores you'll love to eat.
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  I really am talking about
[54:06.000 --> 54:07.000]  miles an hour.
[54:08.000 --> 54:09.000]  I should probably come in
[54:10.000 --> 54:11.000]  at the start of the show
[54:12.000 --> 54:13.000]  at least each hour and tell
[54:14.000 --> 54:15.000]  you what we got on the plate.
[54:16.000 --> 54:17.000]  I have not hit, but about
[54:18.000 --> 54:19.000]  one-twentieth of the news.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  And I'm not kidding.
[54:23.000 --> 54:24.000]  I mean, it gets crazier from
[54:25.000 --> 54:26.000]  there on out.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  There are so many people
[54:29.000 --> 54:30.000]  confronting the Clintons.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  I've been on the campaign trail
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  for 20 days.
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.000]  She's now suddenly emerged.
[54:37.000 --> 54:38.000]  First time she emerges,
[54:39.000 --> 54:40.000]  a guy is in the stands behind
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  her, takes off his shirt.
[54:43.000 --> 54:44.000]  He's a black American
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  and he's got the Hillary
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.000]  for
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  Freudian slip, Hillary for
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  prison.
[54:53.000 --> 54:54.000]  He has the Bill Clinton rape
[54:55.000 --> 54:56.000]  shirt on and then he walks
[54:57.000 --> 54:58.000]  down behind her and they take
[54:58.000 --> 54:59.000]  off.
[55:00.000 --> 55:01.000]  He gets $5,000 just for the
[55:02.000 --> 55:03.000]  courage of doing this, being in
[55:04.000 --> 55:05.000]  that proximity and he didn't
[55:06.000 --> 55:07.000]  really get Hillary's rapist out
[55:08.000 --> 55:09.000]  because they drug him away, but
[55:10.000 --> 55:11.000]  he definitely shook them up big
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  time.
[55:14.000 --> 55:15.000]  And we're going to end up paying
[55:16.000 --> 55:17.000]  out.
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.000]  It looks like the whole $100,000
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  on this.
[55:22.000 --> 55:23.000]  I'll get this gentleman on the
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  show.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  This is, she has covered up for
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.000]  Bill Clinton's rapes.
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.000]  She has covered up for pedophiles
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  and Joy Behar of the View.
[55:35.000 --> 55:36.000]  She got up there
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  yesterday and said that,
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.000]  well, these women are tramps.
[55:43.000 --> 55:44.000]  One of these women that was on
[55:44.000 --> 55:45.000]  the stage that she's talking
[55:46.000 --> 55:47.000]  about in the full clip
[55:48.000 --> 55:49.000]  was 12 years old and was
[55:50.000 --> 55:51.000]  almost beaten to death and was
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.000]  in a coma.
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  I mean, other women had
[55:55.000 --> 55:56.000]  witnesses, they were bleeding
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.000]  and I mean, Bill Clinton's done
[55:57.000 --> 55:58.000]  for this and I just cannot
[55:59.000 --> 56:00.000]  believe what Democratic Party
[56:00.000 --> 56:01.000]  operatives they were.
[56:02.000 --> 56:03.000]  When I went on Joy Behar's
[56:03.000 --> 56:04.000]  show on CNN after I've been on
[56:05.000 --> 56:06.000]  The View that same morning, she
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.000]  said, come over and be on my
[56:07.000 --> 56:08.000]  show.
[56:09.000 --> 56:10.000]  She was so, it's thinking I was
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.000]  a Democrat that, and I don't
[56:12.000 --> 56:13.000]  find her that attractive.
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.000]  She's an old lady, but I mean,
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.000]  the sex appeal
[56:16.000 --> 56:17.000]  in the room with her before we
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.000]  take the show was just
[56:20.000 --> 56:21.000]  like, oh, wow.
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  I mean, it was actually very
[56:23.000 --> 56:24.000]  alluring.
[56:24.000 --> 56:25.000]  Even though I didn't find her
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  physically attractive, it was
[56:26.000 --> 56:27.000]  just pouring the female,
[56:28.000 --> 56:29.000]  oh, I really like what you're
[56:29.000 --> 56:30.000]  doing.
[56:30.000 --> 56:31.000]  It's so sexy.
[56:31.000 --> 56:32.000]  Oh, we're about to take this.
[56:33.000 --> 56:34.000]  What are you doing later?
[56:34.000 --> 56:35.000]  I mean, it was like, and then I
[56:35.000 --> 56:36.000]  see her up there calling these
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.000]  women these names.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  I don't even dislike Joy Behar
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.000]  just because she was so
[56:42.000 --> 56:43.000]  inviting.
[56:43.000 --> 56:44.000]  Even though I disagree with her
[56:44.000 --> 56:45.000]  politics, she came off as so
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  nice and then she's so nasty
[56:49.000 --> 56:50.000]  to these women.
[56:50.000 --> 56:51.000]  It's just despicable.
[56:51.000 --> 56:52.000]  It makes me hate her.
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.000]  And the reason I tell that
[56:53.000 --> 56:54.000]  story is
[56:56.000 --> 56:57.000]  she was very, let's just say,
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.000]  had a lot of hospitality.
[57:00.000 --> 57:01.000]  And that's all that happened,
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.000]  but she was pouring it out at
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  me because she thought I hated
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  the Bushes because I went on
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  TV and talked about 9-11
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  being an inside job.
[57:07.000 --> 57:08.000]  That's the globalists.
[57:08.000 --> 57:09.000]  That's the Saudis.
[57:09.000 --> 57:10.000]  That's the criminal groups that
[57:10.000 --> 57:11.000]  Clintons are involved with as
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.000]  well.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  But that's just how
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  party driven they are to give
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  you an idea
[57:18.000 --> 57:19.000]  that I've been at dinners with
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  like the biggest Hollywood
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  people there were,
[57:21.000 --> 57:22.000]  all because I put out these
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  films that were pro-gun,
[57:24.000 --> 57:25.000]  anti-New World Order,
[57:26.000 --> 57:27.000]  but because they talked bad
[57:27.000 --> 57:28.000]  about the globalists at the
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  Bushes, they'd sit there at
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  parties and watch them in
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  Hollywood and pat me on the
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.000]  back
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.000]  just because I was attacking
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.000]  the Bushes.
[57:38.000 --> 57:39.000]  Obliquely.
[57:39.000 --> 57:40.000]  Again, why I'm saying this is
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  not the name drop stories.
[57:42.000 --> 57:43.000]  These people are in a cult.
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.000]  If Donald Trump starts going
[57:45.000 --> 57:46.000]  sideways and doing a bunch of
[57:46.000 --> 57:47.000]  bad stuff, I'll come after him
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  in two seconds.
[57:51.000 --> 57:52.000]  I mean, I'm not in some cult
[57:52.000 --> 57:53.000]  of Donald Trump or the
[57:53.000 --> 57:54.000]  Republican Party.
[57:54.000 --> 57:55.000]  I hate the Republican Party.
[57:55.000 --> 57:56.000]  The Republican Party establishes
[57:56.000 --> 57:57.000]  it is totally after them.
[57:58.000 --> 57:59.000]  Here's a shorter clip as we're
[57:59.000 --> 58:00.000]  going to break of Behar
[58:00.000 --> 58:01.000]  yesterday.
[58:01.000 --> 58:02.000]  Very, very shameful.
[58:02.000 --> 58:03.000]  Here it is.
[58:04.000 --> 58:05.000]  That's why when he brought up
[58:05.000 --> 58:06.000]  these allegations,
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  I wonder if she missed the
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  opportunity to address it in a
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  way that the public would
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  understand that that's just
[58:14.000 --> 58:15.000]  not how you behave.
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  What's the big issue?
[58:17.000 --> 58:18.000]  I would like to apologize to
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  those tramps that have slept
[58:20.000 --> 58:21.000]  with my husband.
[58:21.000 --> 58:22.000]  Maybe she could have said
[58:22.000 --> 58:23.000]  that.
[58:24.000 --> 58:25.000]  So when we come back,
[58:25.000 --> 58:26.000]  we do have the audio of Hillary
[58:26.000 --> 58:27.000]  calling for an intervention
[58:27.000 --> 58:28.000]  and for them to stop the guy
[58:28.000 --> 58:29.000]  with the right shirt.
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  With only 27 days left until
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  the election, we have entered
[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  the final stretch.
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[58:37.000 --> 58:41.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:45.000 --> 58:47.000]  BrainForce, it's completely
[58:47.000 --> 58:48.000]  different.
[58:48.000 --> 58:49.000]  Try a bottle of it.
[58:49.000 --> 58:51.000]  Rob Doe joins us.
[58:51.000 --> 58:52.000]  You worked, I guess,
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  like 20 plus hours.
[58:54.000 --> 58:55.000]  Tell us what BrainForce did.
[58:55.000 --> 58:56.000]  I'd been working all day.
[58:56.000 --> 58:57.000]  I took a couple hours off
[58:57.000 --> 58:58.000]  coaching basketball.
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  I get in here at 8.30.
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  I was kind of run down.
[59:02.000 --> 59:03.000]  You know, I just didn't feel
[59:03.000 --> 59:04.000]  like I was running out of time.
[59:04.000 --> 59:05.000]  You know, I was running out of
[59:05.000 --> 59:06.000]  time.
[59:06.000 --> 59:07.000]  You know, I just didn't feel
[59:07.000 --> 59:08.000]  like I was going to make it.
[59:08.000 --> 59:09.000]  And I really wanted to do a good
[59:09.000 --> 59:10.000]  job on the interview.
[59:10.000 --> 59:11.000]  I got my bottle of BrainForce
[59:11.000 --> 59:12.000]  right there.
[59:12.000 --> 59:13.000]  I popped two of them.
[59:13.000 --> 59:14.000]  And about 20 minutes later,
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  it's like, everything just kind
[59:16.000 --> 59:17.000]  of clears up.
[59:17.000 --> 59:18.000]  It's got four and a half stars.
[59:18.000 --> 59:19.000]  People really love it.
[59:19.000 --> 59:20.000]  Read about it.
[59:20.000 --> 59:21.000]  Find out why third-party
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  nutraceutical sites give it
[59:23.000 --> 59:24.000]  such high praise,
[59:24.000 --> 59:25.000]  because it really does have
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  the best organic-based systems
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  that will blow your socks off.
[59:29.000 --> 59:30.000]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter
[59:30.000 --> 59:31.000]  like that in a while,
[59:31.000 --> 59:32.000]  but I probably could not have
[59:32.000 --> 59:33.000]  done it without BrainForce.
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  I went home about 6.45 this
[59:35.000 --> 59:37.000]  morning, took three hours of
[59:37.000 --> 59:38.000]  sleep, got up, took two more
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  BrainForce and came in.
[59:40.000 --> 59:41.000]  You will find BrainForce and
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.000]  other game-changing products
[59:43.000 --> 59:45.000]  at infowarslife.com,
[59:45.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  or call 888-253-3139.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  live from the front lines of
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  the info war.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  Alright, I want to go to Luke
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  and Jason and Gary and Zach
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  and Sherry and others.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  The toll-free number to join
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  us is 800-259-9231.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  Obviously, I need to take a breath,
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  because the last hour was just
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  incredible how much we covered.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  I've got a bunch of clips I want
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  to get to how they're planning
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  to try to steal the election.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  We've got a clear vision now
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  of what they're preparing the
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  public mind for, and it's the
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  preconditioning that's the tell
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  on one of their major attack
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  profile strategies.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  We've got Hillary should be
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  indicted, but she can't be.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  Basically, she could probably,
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  like I said, kill children in
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  the White House lawn with a
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  battle axe, and they would say
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  she was giving blood to Mother
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  Earth because she controls the
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  Justice Department, and that's
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  what comes out in the email.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  She's coordinating the Justice
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  Department, telling them what to
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  do, telling the State Department
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  what to do.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  Even after she's out of office,
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  she's running the whole show.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  She's got her people in there,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  and it's them paper play,
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  foreign governments, individuals,
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  people getting $9 billion
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  lawsuit shut down, you know,
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  giving her money.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  It's all in the new emails.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  They're up on infowars.com,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  prisonplanet.com.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  Incredible.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  I'm going to start your calls
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  now, but I'm going to go back to
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  this Joy Bayhart thing, calling
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  the women that were there at the
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  event tramps.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  I guess that includes the little
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  lady that was raped when she was
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  12 and in a coma for what, five
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  days?
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  The Hillary representative?
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  She or she represented the
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  pedophile?
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  And she sat there and said,
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  you liked it, you wanted it,
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  didn't you?
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  I mean, there's no way I could be
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  a defense attorney.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  And represent pedophiles when
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  you know they're guilty, which
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  she later admitted, and she got
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  the guy off, it was just on
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  probation, but her light
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  sentence, I'm going to go back
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  to the history of it, but like
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  giggling and laughing about it
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  and then sitting there and
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  telling a little girl on the
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  stand, you wanted it, you wanted
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  it, didn't you?

[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  creepy.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  She's a creepy weirdo with flies
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  landing on her, and she ribits
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  and barks like a dog, and stings
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  like a dog, and stings like a
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  dog, and stings like a dog, and
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  stings like a dog, and stings

[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  dog, and stings like a dog,

[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  dog.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  And she's all creepy looking and
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  acts creepy.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  She's a creepy weirdo with flies
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  landing on her, and she
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  ribits and barks like a dog,
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  and stings reportedly.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  Secret service says it smells
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  like sewer.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  Jason in Texas, you're on the
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  air.

[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  Hey Alex, how you doing man?
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  Good my friend.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  Oh man, I've been trying to get
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  on there since the RNC, man.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.480]  getting here lately it's awesome well to be clear the network that I'm on that I
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:13.360]  use as a satellite carrier with the Ray John Harmon up there in Minnesota just to
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.480]  be clear since you brought this up it has six phone lines we have 15 phone
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:23.240]  lines potentially it's digital we got 23,000 phone calls the other night that
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.520]  came out of the system go ahead sorry yeah just real quick I know a while back
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:34.760]  you's talking about the the copyright make America so great again Bobby bones
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:41.240]  is a radio show host out of Tennessee or out of Nashville his producer put a
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:46.360]  $1,000 bet down on Trump winning the election last year when it was 50 to 1
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:51.520]  and so if Trump wins he's gonna get $50,000 well Bobby bones found out that
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.920]  make America great again was not copyrighted so he copyrighted it and
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:04.240]  held it for ransom to Donald Trump to get a donation to St. Jude so y'all want
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:10.640]  to check that out that's the backstory of that then Hillary Clinton hates all of
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:16.200]  us which we know and her hate is nothing but just a summary of the hate of the
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.280]  people that are pulling the puppet strings she's just doing what the bigger
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.600]  haters are doing and that's why I got a plea for Mr. Trump I've been wanting to
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:30.680]  talk to him if I could Mr. Trump I'm a 37 year old husband of 15 years to an

[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:41.440]  the only one that works and it is a struggle I've been watching Trump since
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:46.120]  I was 10 years old and he's been a champion to me since I first met him
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.440]  through the WWE watching him on TV brother that's awesome God bless you I

[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.360]  personal fear of Hillary Clinton and to warn voters that Clinton does not stand

[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:12.480]  the guy named Alex Jones Alex Jones from info wars yeah Alex Jones Alex Jones
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:19.720]  one of those guys who believes a big foot was responsible for 9-11 claims that
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:25.120]  9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs the conspiracy du jour
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.720]  Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition you just had to keep
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.720]  digging didn't you Alex?
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:38.520]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:43.040]  but kids against algorithm the very stories like the Clinton's body count
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:46.800]  stories that's according to website info wars and this really this is so
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:54.360]  disgusting. The juice of these pickles is on you Alex Jones. It goes right now
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:58.600]  Jones and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth. Hillary Clinton created ISIS with
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:03.240]  Obama. The very fringe of the conspiracy movement like Alex Jones are being kind
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:07.560]  of incorporated into the campaign. If Trump gets elected he's gonna be secretary
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:12.440]  of defense. I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic. Move bitch! Get out of the way!
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:17.640]  Bill Clinton is a rapist at info wars.com. Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:22.040]  Bill Clinton is a rapist. info wars.com. info wars.com. Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:26.040]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:33.560]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:40.680]  Now here's the huge news on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and it's out
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.680]  of Bloomberg, it's out of the Daily Caller, it's Associated Press, this is
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:52.120]  this is confirmed in the data dump. The latest by WikiLeaks just in State
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:56.520]  Department is coordinating email release when the Clinton campaign had
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:02.360]  discussions with the DOJ. Again that's Clinton with the DOJ of the State
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:07.360]  Department. An agency she's never been in and another agency she formerly headed
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:14.800]  getting directives from her. Totally illegal and we've got the emails to the
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.560]  media and emails to comedians and all the rest of them. Now remember? Remember
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:28.440]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz. And then you've got the new chair of the DNC. That's in
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:33.560]  the new emails that have come out. Remember she cryptically said I've
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.720]  taken over to finish the job we started. They don't even hide it. They said the
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:42.960]  public of course the DNC wasn't rigged for Hillary. Then they say of course it's
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:46.800]  rigged and then we have the emails out of the New York Observer breaking DNC
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:53.800]  chief. Donna Brazil leaked Sanders info to Clinton campaign. Of course they were
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.800]  all in there working against him. They stole the delegates. They created the
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:03.320]  superdelegates. They admitted it. Sanders was winning by 70-80 percent in
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:06.600]  almost every state. It was ridiculous. He'd have 20,000 people. She'd have a
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:11.320]  hundred, 200. She's got a couple hundred now when she has events. There's more
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:17.640]  people on the stage behind her than there are in front of her. And now one of
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.560]  our listeners got up behind yesterday Hillary. She wasn't going to do any
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:27.840]  rallies but she just showed up. Clinton suggests intervention for protester
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.760]  wearing Bill Clinton rape shirt. Now for TV viewers you can see this radio
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.600]  listeners I'll describe it. First we'll show the video shot on a cell phone of
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:38.600]  him right behind Hillary when he's taken up by the police. Then she says we need
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:48.040]  to have a intervention out in the parking lot for this poor man. See there's
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.240]  no way he could be deplorable. I mean he's a black man and they belong to the
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:57.600]  party of the KKK. You're not getting off her plantation so she says that he's
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.200]  drugged out by the police and I thought the police are all evil Hillary but now
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.080]  you called on them to have him taken out. Imagine if we had a black man being
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:09.400]  taken out of Trump rally for doing a disturbance. See the media is like what
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:13.720]  Jones is doing is so horrible doing this. You people at the DNC and George
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:18.600]  Soros sent folks in to be violent. It came out in the emails of the Blaine
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.600]  Bernie Sanders. I'm not even doing a third of what you're doing. What I'm
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:27.400]  doing is legal and lawful. We're up like $30,000 I got to pay out now. It's
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.240]  bittersweet. We don't have a big extra budget but I knew that they were going to come out
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:34.480]  and say that Trump was a racist. We knew this a year ago. I knew that they were
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.720]  going to come out and say that he was a rapist. All these are words. I knew he was
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:41.480]  going to pull all this so we've just been attacking this whole thing with the
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:47.840]  truth. I tell you it's perfect timing with all the Bill Clinton rape stuff
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:54.360]  coming out. Oh singing in says it's a conspiracy theory that Bill Clinton
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:13:01.800]  ever sexually assaulted women. He settled cases. I've interviewed at least four
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:07.640]  women that say he raped them. I mean these are women like in the governor's
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:13.240]  mansion, in the US Capitol. I mean he'll come in a cloak room, lock the door,
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:17.000]  shove you up against the wall and rape you. There it is CNN panels. Bill Clinton's
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.600]  sexual abusers are conspiracy theory which the Clintons again in their own
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:26.320]  emails tell the media to say. Remember it's a conspiracy theory that her email
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:30.920]  was even hacked. Remember just what was it? Six, seven months ago one of our
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:35.800]  reporters asked her about her email and said it was reportedly hacked. Our
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:39.800]  source said and she said oh no it was never hacked. When she knew it was hacked
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:44.160]  notice it's all come out. She was hacked. It came out in July. Oh something else we
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:50.200]  told you about. Something else we had sources on that were correct and we were
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:56.680]  told by a federal source on the road look to hear that her emails been hacked.
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:03.320]  Look for that. Look for ramps on a black ambulance. Look for her falling down. Look
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:07.400]  for her at a medical tent. We went, we looked, we found. You found. You looked,
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.920]  you found. Just questioning these liars and we have in the emails their
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.160]  high-level campaign staff meeting saying the public is waking up. The public,
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.520]  what's the exact words? I covered it like a bunch in the last hour. I'm gonna give you
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.640]  the exact words. It's up on inforwars.com. How they want to keep us in a
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:27.040]  sleeping, sleeping state. Alright let's forget some clips and write back to your
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:32.160]  phone calls. There's so many of these. Let's, let's play Hillary on the
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:53.640]  intervention. So.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:10.400]  I do hope somebody follows that gentleman out and stages an intervention. He
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:17.640]  clearly has not been following this election very closely. Okay so there are
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:21.240]  info warriors taking action, getting the info out. It's so funny. Bill Clinton's a
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:26.200]  rapist. Let's have the intervention. Not for the rapists, not for all your crimes,
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:30.240]  not for you finding jihadis, but for him. Now let's go ahead and get big
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.920]  confidence games up there smiling, you know. Notice in the debates you had to
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.760]  sit down most of the time. Since I've mentioned it here it is. CNN
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:42.440]  panelists, Bill Clinton's sexual abusers are conspiracy theorists and that ties
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:47.600]  into this huge new bombshell. New York City Democratic Election Commissioner.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:53.240]  This isn't a commission member. This is the commissioner at a Democratic Party
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:16:00.200]  gala bragging about how they bust people around and have them vote at each polling
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:05.720]  place. What did Larry Nichols used to do this in Arkansas with Clinton? Say they
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:09.560]  do. They love bunch of homeless people. They feed them the names of dead people
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.240]  or folks they don't aren't voting. They walk up in a Democrat controlled
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:18.480]  precincts and they vote over and over again generally 10 times in a day. Takes
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:21.880]  50, 20 minutes to vote and they drive you another place. They feed you meals and
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:29.440]  they give you 50 to 100 dollars. Sometimes they give people liquor. Remember
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:32.800]  what happened with Veritas, Project Veritas that got this as well, James O'Keefe?
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.760]  When they walk into Akron and go, I'm running child sex slaves. How do I do
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.520]  that? Oh well, just make sure you pay your taxes and you can run that sex
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:45.480]  slave. Let us help you set that up right now. And then you went to facility at
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:49.960]  facility. This is what we're dealing with. Our people that are just, it's just
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:54.280]  lawlessness and it's just out in the open and this guy is just talking about it
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:59.240]  like it's no big deal. This is the head of it. But first, Bill Clinton's sexual
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:06.280]  abusers are conspiracy theorists. CNN, here it is. So Jackie, the irony is
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:10.000]  that with Bill Clinton you have him never acknowledging any of those
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.160]  allegations. You had Donald Trump in his own words, you know, admitting that he had
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:18.960]  done the kinds of things he's accusing Clinton of. Does that work with anybody
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:26.240]  outside the people who will never vote for anyone but Trump? No. Bill Clinton
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.480]  is not on the ballot. Hillary Clinton is on the ballot. A lot of the things
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.880]  Trump says about the 90s about Bill Clinton comes straight out of
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:41.360]  conspiracy theory land. Things that are in Ed Klein's book. Things that
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:49.840]  Roger Stone says. So no, I don't think it matters. She was co-president. That's
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:56.160]  admitted. Now she's gonna be back in. They vacation with the Bushes. She is the
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:59.680]  Bembo eruption expert that went out and suppressed the women. Just like
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:06.760]  Bayhards bullying him, calling him tramps. You guys are shameful. Trump in an
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.640]  edited tape shot his mouth off about how women were throwing themselves on him.
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:12.760]  He could do whatever he wanted. He wasn't saying, I'm going out to salty women. He
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.240]  said, they throw themselves on you. You can just do that. They don't even
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:19.440]  kick you. And it's untasteful. I don't like it. But we're dealing with the
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.000]  Clintons here who absolutely hate him and the whole world government for a good
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.600]  reason. Now let's let's start playing part of this project Veritas piece. The
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.040]  full things on infowars.com. We'll go out to break her in a minute and a half.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:37.720]  New York City Democratic Election Commissioner Alan Schuckelin, how do
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:42.280]  you pronounce that, is caught on camera at the United Federation of Teachers
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:45.400]  Holiday Party admitting there is widespread voter fraud in New York City.
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:19:06.400]  I think there's a lot of voter fraud. Like I say, people don't realize certain neighborhoods in particular, they bust people around to vote. They do what? They bust them around. They put them in a bus. They go to the police site. The police site. Like what kind of neighborhoods? I don't want to spy on them.
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:18.400]  That's Alan Schuckelin. Oh, like minority neighborhoods? Like black neighborhoods and Hispanic neighborhoods?
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:25.400]  Chinese, too. Why do they do that? Just to get more votes for Democrats?
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:40.400]  They get buses. They move people around. Well, New York doesn't have voter ID laws, right?
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:50.400]  They can't ask for voter ID. Why's that? They can't.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:56.400]  You know, I don't think it's too much to have somebody to show some kind of ID.
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.400]  See, I don't even think this guy's probably in pause. We're going to break.
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:14.400]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson of the Genesis Communications Network. Over the 30 plus years I've been in finance, I can see that the world economy is now at a critical point. Unlimited money creation and runaway debt could trigger a collapse of the financial system.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:23.400]  It's imperative that you protect yourself in case of hyperinflation or even deflation. Investment Rarities has put together a survival bag of 200 silver quarters.
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:34.400]  These 90% silver quarters are dated 1964 and earlier. Each quarter is worth almost $5. If a quarter has already reached $5, the trend is obviously on your side.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:49.400]  These survival bags sell for $8.95 delivered. Call 800-328-1860 to order today. Not only can these quarters be used for barter in a brief period of hyperinflation, they have the potential to appreciate 5 to 10 times.

[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:09.400]  Think about this. Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines,
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:17.400]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants. And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:30.400]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey water filter. New NSF EPA certified lab tests show Big Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:41.400]  All forms of fluoride and much more. Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market. The gold standard in water purification and our filters last three years at less than 2 cents per gallon.

[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:12.400]  Today I became a bio-photon woman. I put a tablespoon of the Andreas 5-seat oil in my morning one-world-way drink and was still happy and energized at 3 p.m. Normally I feel tired and spacey at the end of the day.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:21.400]  But today I felt energy and very clear. My friend at the farmers market asked what I was on. She said my eyes look bright and I had unusual energy for that time of afternoon.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:29.400]  I told her there was a magical oil that enabled my body to absorb the sun's energy as if I were a plant. She said I want some.
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:39.400]  A second one-world-way shake with the oil when I got home took me to bedtime with that wonderful abundant energy. I couldn't believe how much I got done and how great I felt.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:49.400]  The combination of one-world-way and 5-seat oil produced a significant health event in my life. The kind that makes you feel you've been given your life back with a bonus. And I'm 64.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:58.400]  5-seat oil in one-world-way for your fantastic health. Call 888-988-3325 or visit sacredseedoils.com.

[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:57.400]  American Maine food stores all love to eat. Yum!
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:23.400]  So, it's a conspiracy theory, huh? That there's election fraud. It doesn't exist, but now they've got to federalize the elections to stop the Russians and Alex Jones and Trump stealing it.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:35.400]  Mr. Skorkin, who is the Election Commissioner in New York, I'm not saying he's involved in fraud. I'm saying the Democrats he's talking about are, and he's admitting he thinks you should have an ID and there's total fraud going on, but that he doesn't want to say it on camera.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:41.400]  Well, you got caught on camera. And he goes into the fact that it's just over the top.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:57.400]  Elections officials caught on video blasting the Blasio's ID program. Well, just admitting there's total election fraud. Total voter fraud. Now, you can say, well, retail fraud as individuals, but this is election fraud when you organize people en masse to engage in fraud.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:05.400]  That is election fraud, not voter fraud. Voter fraud is one person. Election fraud is electronic or organized individuals with list.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:14.400]  So that's electronic too. Of dead people or folks you know have not been voting in a while, but you vote in their stead and they don't know they're out voting for you.
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:21.400]  And it's happening all to the battleground states. Now, we're about to break some really, really big news here.
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:31.400]  I tell you, a lot of times with big news, I will choose to let another outlet put it out just because if I think they have more credibility on the subject, I will let them put it out.
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:39.400]  I've been sitting on this for a week and waiting for other folks and we put up through somebody else and then I was told it's being put out for someone else now.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:46.400]  So we've been asked to go ahead and put it out. We're going to put it out the start of the next segment. The article is going up on info wars.com in the next minute.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:51.400]  So you'll need to hit refresh that we're going to add some background to the story, but we're going to go ahead and put it out right now.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:26:04.400]  And that is the untold story of Danny Williams banished, who was told his whole life that Bill Clinton was his father, Bill Clinton set $700 a month doing, sent him presents till Hillary showed up at the house and told the mother,
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:15.400]  I'll have you put in prison if you don't stop doing this. And so this is the untold story of Danny Williams coming up a little bit later in this hour.
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:22.400]  But the video will be posted in the next minute or two to info wars.com and prison planet.com will tweeted out at real Alex Jones.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:29.400]  And you will also want to obviously share this with others because they're going to try to probably take it down.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.400]  In fact, it just went live. It went live so fast. I was told her the last break that.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:42.400]  Oh, that's the one from a few days ago. Yes, Hillary Clinton had bills mixed race, son banished African American voters will go to Trump in droves after Clinton is exposed.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:58.400]  I have another former chef of the Clintons who heard them heard her calling black people the n word. And again, I've only heard the n word out of Democrats behind closed doors.
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:05.400]  It's like something they do. It's really weird. They'll say, Hey, want some of these and you learn stuff from them.
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:13.400]  I didn't know you call these nuts n word toes. Or you'll argue with some Democrat. They'll go, Don't you talk to me like it?
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:18.400]  I mean, it's happened to me over and over again, black Democrats, white Democrats. It's like, whoa.
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:25.400]  But I guess that's where the KKK came from. I just everything is so upside down. I just I don't even know what to think anymore.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:36.400]  I grew up so blind to the racism stuff because it just wasn't going on in my family. I mean, I just that's the reason I'm so annoyed by it by races, black people and others and Hispanics that say I'm back as I'm white.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:46.400]  It's just a mess. It's a total mess. Your calls are coming up. I'll get to all of this. But the Danny Williams is going up here in just the next few minutes to info wars.com.
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:52.400]  His statement on his father wanting to get to know Bill Clinton wanted to have a DNA test.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:57.400]  We're going to push some other things today as well and big surprises tomorrow and the next day.
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:02.400]  So just look for that here at info wars.com and the syndicated radio broadcast.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:12.400]  But let's go out to break with the head of elections, the head of commissioner in New York City talking to project Veritas, the full clips on info wars.com.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:23.400]  You know, I don't think it's too much to have somebody to show some kind of idea. Yeah, I mean, why not? I mean, you have to show an ID for everything else.
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:34.400]  Well, you're the Democratic, you're the commissioner, you said of the Democratic election commissioner. So if you think there's voter fraud and you think there should be voter ID, why don't people listen to you?
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:42.400]  Well, that's because the New York state legislature makes the laws. I don't think so. And you're saying there's a lot of absentee ballots for us too.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:51.400]  Oh, there's thousands of absentee ballots. I know where they came from. Yeah, but that's the thing, like Hillary Clinton doesn't support voter ID laws.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:56.400]  I know. That's why I'm not always crazy about everything the Democrats do either.
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:08.400]  Let's stop right there. That's where I was going next after calls. Think about this. Look at the article at info wars.com. Paul that claims Hillary 11 point ahead run by Clinton ally paid off by her super PAC.
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:15.400]  But that's nothing. Look at this little sweetie pie. New York Times early voting could hand election to Hillary Clinton well before November 8.
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:20.400]  This does two things. It makes you think there's no hope because he's now going to lose Florida with no evidence.
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:27.400]  They say preliminary info shows she's a little bit ahead. Yeah, all the absentee voting, all the dead people voting, the buses driving around.
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:34.400]  So here's the perception he's losing and then gets you ready for the theft while in New York, Florida and other areas.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:43.400]  All these absentee ballots to show up with all these names on them, magically stuffed by the Democratic Party machine that's famous for this.
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:50.400]  So how do we fight back against the theft of our republic in front of us in broad daylight? Stay with us. The Danny Williams info coming up March.
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:30:17.400]  The empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:21.400]  Refugees because they can't possibly fed all those refugees. Yeah, we know you can't vet them all.
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:27.400]  And yet you want to allow 55,000 Syrians to come in annually on the bed.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:40.400]  But you're going to go to this private luncheon and tell them that it's probably a bad idea to take in refugees because of the fact there could be some extremists to get in there and then come over here to America and possibly chop off our head.
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:49.400]  And say that since day one, we need to secure the border. We need someone like Donald Trump to come in here and make America great again because the Clintons have done nothing but fell their entire political career.
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:31:10.400]  And I'm sick and tired of it. So November 8th, get your butt to the polls, go out there, vote, make America great again. Let's secure those boards. This has been Joe Biggs with info wars dot com.

[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:37.400]  I'm here to warn people you keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game speech. Can anything be done is stop the hatred. I think Alex was the one who took the pro gun position.
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:50.400]  I don't want that man to have a gun. Alex Jones is a 9 11 truth or that conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories. That's an internet talk show called info wars.
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:34:03.400]  I heard that on Alex Jones. So it's true. I heard it Alex Jones. So I know you're making some very serious allegations against the US government saying that they stage attacks. They allow them to occur in the United States against us.
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:15.400]  Let's be classified. Alex Jones may sound crazy. I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic. That man threatened this country. He is a conspiracy theorist. Deeply I think racist. I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:26.400]  And considered legit among the crazy. Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match. Show up with a semi automatic that you got legally and pop them. I'd love to see that in uniform.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:33.400]  Keep shoving lies at your audience jackasses. I like that guy. That is the best.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:10.400]  We have a fog that is descended on our entire nation. The globalists are going to blow stuff out of the land on the east. Hillary's the one who runs the cover up. Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to unfold in triplicate spades.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:30.400]  This is real good. I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me. To Matt it's over for you. They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law. You're out of there. You want it baby. You're about to get it.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:43.400]  We did meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant and see how many guns or what kind of guns they came to take. We met them at Concord Bridge and we blew their punk ass brains out.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:55.400]  Info Wars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation, blow the criminal cover of operatives more than any other institution out there of freedom. And I'm so proud of that.
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:36:03.400]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women. No, Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:13.400]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:26.400]  These people are of the devil. Let's be very glad about this. Raise hell and demand accountability. It is the most corrupt, degenerate criminal government in American history.
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:35.400]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:42.400]  We're proud of now moving forward toward the barrier. The police have been telling everybody they're going to shoot if we don't move back.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:47.400]  Their defeat will be ultimately a crushing one.
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:56.400]  Alex Jones here in studio. We're halfway into this worldwide broadcast. Your calls are coming up. We have guests joining us as well a little bit later in the next hour.
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:05.400]  Owen Schreuer in FullWars.com reporter who just got back from the debates the other night with incredible triggering of leftist and the fact that they have no common sense.
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:13.400]  And we're basically unable to defend their positions except a few of them to admit that they know Hillary Clinton covered up for Bill and as a predator and a criminal.
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:19.400]  It's just that Trump's a racist because he said all Mexicans are rapists.
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:28.400]  Isn't that interesting when he said a lot of criminals and rapists and robbers are coming over just like criminals from the U.S. run to Mexico.
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:35.400]  He never said that. But this is how they operate. This is what they do. So we're going to be breaking all of that down coming up.
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:43.400]  But first, top story on DrudgeReport.com. Clinton's son speaks.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:53.400]  And we're writing a larger article around this right now. We have been working with folks closely associated with Mr. Williams.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:38:02.400]  And we're going to hold off until tomorrow with this. But there's a lot of things obviously going on and things afoot.
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:09.400]  And so we were told drop the hammer now. So this was 10 minutes ago talking to Williams and others and let you know that.
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:26.400]  And so, boom, this is his testimony. First ever seen and it brings tears to my eyes because listen, when I go see a movie like Kill the Messenger about Gary Webb who won all those big awards for exposing CIA drug dealing,
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:34.400]  who's been exonerated, it was nauseating because I knew him well. He was going to come on the show and break his new book.
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:42.400]  I was talking to him weeks before he died. I know they killed him. They shot him twice in the head. And the media said it was a suicide.
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:51.400]  So, I mean, I've lived this and I've lived 20 years ago having guests on about Danny Williams and the state police delivering $700 a month.
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:59.400]  And Bill Clinton having Christmas presents delivered in Hillary coming and saying, when he was a teenager, you know, you can't talk to Bill or get money anymore.
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:06.400]  I'll have you thrown in prison. So they've been speaking out since then and it fits into all the other abused women and the rest of it.
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:21.400]  So I believe Mr. Williams' story. He looks like Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton is known to have a penchant for ladies across the board and it fits into the entire paradigm.
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:30.400]  And so this is important. Now, they famously, in a newspaper, Al of the Democratic Party, claimed that they had supplied a DNA test in the mid-90s.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:37.400]  They did not do that. Then they said, oh, here's a test, but then it wasn't a DNA test. It was just completely made up.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:49.400]  So we're about to premiere this nine minute video where his reported son, alleged son, Danny Williams, is trying to reconnect with his father, Bill Clinton.
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:53.400]  He's banished. The untold story of Danny Williams' search for his father.
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:59.400]  He's a father himself, hardworking man with a good record.
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:07.400]  And Black Lives Matter unless you're Bill Clinton's illegitimate black son.
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:15.400]  And this goes back to criticisms of, you know, Thomas Jefferson not making, you know, the kids he had with black ladies, you know, his kids.
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:21.400]  So I guess he is William Jefferson Clinton, but not in a good way.
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:26.400]  You know, there was the good part of Jefferson, Thomas Jefferson, not the good part of William Jefferson.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:32.400]  But Owen Troyer is here with us. Just a quick snapshot of this in your view of this about to break.
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:39.400]  And then we're about to premiere this for everybody. Again, it's powerful. What do you think?
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:45.400]  Well, I think we can see really the fear in Bill Clinton right now. I mean, he's acting very neurotic.
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:48.400]  He's acting like he's really freaked out about all this.
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:53.400]  Oh, yeah, let's put the creepy rapester shot from the other night up there.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:56.400]  Yeah, you've got that. You've got how he acts during his speeches.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:01.400]  You've got even things that he's saying when he talks about Obamacare, about Hillary Clinton.
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:05.400]  It regularly happens where she faints. Oh, wait, no, it's not a regular thing.
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:11.400]  We had that weird email he sent out where there's an acronym, a secret message on the side that says Stop Her.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:13.400]  So it's very strange what's going on with Bill Clinton.
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:19.400]  And this is kind of an approach that I take to all of this, Alex, that I don't understand why we wouldn't be seeing more of this.
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:26.400]  If you, I mean, this is huge. If someone's accusing me of having an illegitimate son that's false, guess what?
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:29.400]  I'm going to do everything I can to put that to rest immediately.
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:32.400]  I'll go do a DNA test right now. I'll meet with you right now.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:37.400]  Let's clear the air on this right now. Complete silence from the Clinton campaign.
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:50.400]  Nothing from Bill Clinton on this. And I think that Donald Trump should bring Danny Williams to the next debate as his special guest if Clinton does not address this before then.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:59.400]  Absolutely. Trying to go over the thousand plus emails and WikiLeaks is now actually releasing stuff that will get her indicted if there's any justice where they are saying he's giving us a million bucks.
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:06.400]  We've got to shut down this $9 billion lawsuit. And then, OK, well, Chelsea's mad saying this is illegal.
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:08.400]  And it's Chelsea in here going, this is illegal. I don't want to do this.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.400]  They're like, shut up, brat. I mean, the other Democratic Party operatives, it's all there.
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:18.400]  And then high-level Democratic Party meetings where they're saying the public's starting to wake up.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:21.400]  We've got to keep them in the dark. I mean, this is powerful stuff.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:33.400]  Yeah. And this Danny Williams thing is so powerful because it puts to rest or I guess it even sheds a light on all the double standards coming from the left, specifically Hillary Clinton supporters or Black Lives Matter.
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:39.400]  You know, Hillary Clinton, again, it's like she said multiple times, any woman who says that they've been sexually abused need to be heard.
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:40.400]  She ignores all of that.
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:47.400]  And then Joy Bayhard getting the same talking points, calls them tramps, including a girl that was 12 years old, raped into a coma.
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:52.400]  And Hillary Clinton represented the guy knowing he was guilty and then told the little girl she was a liar and liked it.
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:58.400]  Now, we're going to go to this piece. It's up on infowars.com. If you're a radio listener, you're going to hear the audio of Danny Williams.
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:04.400]  If you're a TV viewer at infowars.com forward slash show and cable and UHFVF stations that are picking us up, you can see it.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:11.400]  But the video is at infowars.com. It went live just a little while ago on Danny Williams' new channel.
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:18.400]  And we're about to premiere it here. It's on infowars.com. That's where it was first posted.
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:24.400]  And you can go see it, share it, get it out to folks, copy it to your channel, whatever.
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:28.400]  The point is we need to spread this. We need to put this on Facebook right now as well.
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:35.400]  So spread this to the forewinds. It's the pop link at drudgereport.com. That's the easiest place to find it and share it.
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:39.400]  We're going to play this in this entirety. Come back, comment on it and go right to your calls.
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:44.400]  I know you've been holding. We had to pre-empt you, obviously, callers for something this big happening today.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:48.400]  And just to be clear, we got a lot of background info we're about to publish as well.
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:56.400]  Talking to folks. I was told this was coming out today or tomorrow because I'm talking to these folks, but I'm obviously not in the mechanics of it all.
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:00.400]  They said, no, no, now's the time. Go ahead. So that's why we are putting this out there.
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:05.400]  I didn't want to scoop anybody. We were just told that we've been decided that of all the media and the Daily Mail and everybody else,
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:11.400]  the world meant Daily, that they wanted to give it to us. So we're doing it. And so we're just following his wishes.
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:20.400]  So Mr. Williams wanted us to put it out. We're putting it out right now. Here it is, premiered at infowars.com and drudgereport.com. Here it is.
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:26.400]  Banished is the name. The whole story of Danny Williams.
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:33.400]  I have no doubt that I am Bill Clinton's son. It was common knowledge. Everyone in Arkansas knew.
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:37.400]  Everywhere I went, they pointed Bill Clinton's son right there. He looked like him, don't he?
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:47.400]  The ears, the mouth, the chin, the teeth, the eyes, the nose. I see him, hear me. You can see a black Bill Clinton.
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:52.400]  I brush my hair. I can see Bill Clinton with waves in his head.
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:45:01.400]  I always feel bad about him not wanting to be in my life. Was it because I was black? Was it something wrong with me?
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:09.400]  Why he don't want to be a part of me? It made me think of even sometimes suicide.
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:16.400]  It's not fair. And it has been hurtful. He still refused to acknowledge me.
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:23.400]  Well, time was very hard. And my mom was a working girl on the streets. She was heavy on drugs.
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:31.400]  My name is Lucy Avalton. My sister is following the lead. She was standing with his mother.
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:38.400]  She's a profiteur. You know, all around on the streets, I was talking to a man. She ran him on the streets.
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:41.400]  I was told that she was with him on 13 occasions.
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:50.400]  Nobody. No, nobody. I was talking to him all the time. You know, they didn't intervene because she was afraid about you.
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:59.400]  My mom went to prison and lost custody of us. My aunt Lucy stepped up and gained guardianship of us.
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:05.400]  She raised us in Little Argosau. At the time, we was from group home to house to house.
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:13.400]  My aunt Lucy wanted to have a father in my life. As a small child, she took me to the government.
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:21.400]  There was a car coming out the front gate, right? And the gate swings open. I ran up in there and ran behind the gate. Okay?
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:25.400]  She was trying to get him to accept me and notice me.
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:30.400]  When I got to the door, I asked her if the door was slammed in my face.
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:35.400]  It's not a door in her face. This is Bill's son. He had the black son out here.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:39.400]  He used to go by and came out the side of the place.
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:43.400]  Hillary and she had guys to chase him off the property.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:57.400]  I read history. Basically, it goes back to the slave owners. When they have a child with one of their slaves and the wives try to have them banished off the plantation.
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:00.400]  What century is this? It just wasn't right.
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:07.400]  Every child in this state is somebody because we're going to give them every chance we can.
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:11.400]  Honestly, we were needing child support at the time. My mom was in prison.
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:18.400]  We was poor, okay? We had nothing. Who almost listened to us? Really?
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:20.400]  My aunt and sister was working at a gas station.
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:26.400]  We had no money to pay noise. They just shut us up.
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:30.400]  My mom told me on a few occasions what she was threatening.
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:34.400]  He didn't talk to the lady in my life or anything. I'm almost missing.
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:39.400]  She was also pushed out of the two-story window where she got a mother plate in her foot.
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.400]  To this day, she still feels scared of speaking.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:49.400]  I was trying to get information about the woman's voice so they can hear her. I guess, of course, mine.
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:55.400]  In fact, my mother did receive $700 bills a month in the mailbox.
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:00.400]  Even presents on Christmas that was delivered to my home by state troopers.
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:07.400]  So I felt he was trying to be a part of my life. And then when he became president, everything stopped.
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:15.400]  In 1995, when my father was president of the United States, the state of Arkansas put us in foster care.
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:23.400]  I lived in foster homes. It made me feel horrible because I know his child, Chelsea, was well-taken care of.
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:31.400]  And we was house-to-house, home-realized. And to know that my father was the president, it hurts.
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:41.400]  Try to imagine that your own father refused to love you, refused to say that you exist.
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:49.400]  Knowing who my father was and that he was so close yet so far away, made my pain unbearable.
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:57.400]  Growing up in Little Rock School district system, it was difficult because you got gang memories, drug activities at the schools.
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:02.400]  And I wanted more to life. I didn't want to end up dead in the streets for nothing.
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:06.400]  Moving from home to home, not having a stable place to go.
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:12.400]  It came to a point in high school where I had to drop out to take care of my little sisters and brothers
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:16.400]  and make sure they were stable and able to go to school every day.
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:22.400]  I got a job full-time at a donor shop my 11th grade year to support my sisters and brothers.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:29.400]  If I had the love and support of my father that stayed on me, made sure I had the best education,
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:36.400]  I feel I would have had a better life. In 1999, they tried to sweep me under the rug with Bill Clinton's friend
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:40.400]  publishing this phony DNA test. It never was a DNA test.
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:44.400]  Roger Altman. Roger is a longtime friend of mine.
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:49.400]  Just think about it. It was published in the tabloid owned by a donor, Bill Clinton.
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:57.400]  Even to this day, Megan Kelly, Howard Kirk, they continue to quote this bogus DNA test and it really hurts.
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:04.400]  I would love to see the DNA test done. Several times, I tried to reach out to the Clintons.
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:09.400]  People say all the time, you gonna get yourself killed dealing with the Clintons.
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:15.400]  I wrote letters to his library, I wrote letters to addresses I got off the internet,
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:22.400]  even emailed them from Facebook on his Facebook pages that I never got any response back.
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:29.400]  Once in Little Rock, Arkansas, I visited the Clinton Library. I wanted to see how it felt to be his president and he was speaking.
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:38.400]  But by the time we made it there, he was already gone. We took a tour through the library and just to see all the things he'd done in the world
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:47.400]  pepping other kids and Haiti and, you know, all the other places. It just saddened me because I never received any help from him.
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:52.400]  Henry started running for president. She visited Little Rock at one of her campaign stops.
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:58.400]  I put myself right in front of the podium where she spoke. She was looking right at me, eye contact.
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:11.400]  I met with a small group of the Black Lives Matter activists.
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:16.400]  It made me wonder if she says Black Lives Matter, why I don't matter to her.
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:18.400]  And I just felt for them.
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:24.400]  I was gonna introduce myself as Danny Williams, her husband's son and her stepson.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:27.400]  You know, I am a new grandmother in case you haven't heard.
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:31.400]  I had these or questions to ask, you know, why?
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:34.400]  We're gonna do everything we can to make sure she has every opportunity.
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:39.400]  Soon as she spoke, she got out of there. I didn't get to talk to my stepmom.
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:43.400]  I could never imagine having a child and not acknowledging.
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:47.400]  As I know how I feel to not have a parent in your life.
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:53.400]  I work construction. I am a person of faith. I take my kids to church every Sunday.
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:52:01.400]  I teach my sons how to keep that language out your mouth, how to speak properly with yes sir and yes ma'am.
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:06.400]  Recently I've been telling my kids that their grandfather was the president of the United States.
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:09.400]  And they are amazed by it. They're like, no, you know, is it for real?
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:12.400]  I tell them yes, you know, that is my father.
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:15.400]  And I'm gonna make sure you get to meet him one day.
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:20.400]  Hillary, please do not deny I exist.
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:25.400]  I am your stepson. Chelsea is my sister and Bill is my father.
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:28.400]  Super predators. We have to bring them to heal.
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:33.400]  I feel bad when Hillary called black people super predators and that we need to be brought to heal.
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:41.400]  I'm black. I'm real. I am her stepson and I deserve the love that she has given Chelsea.
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:47.400]  We hear my stepmother tells the nation every day we're stronger together.
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:50.400]  They know who I am and I know who I am.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:57.400]  I have to meet my father. I have to know that he's willing to even accept me.
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:05.400]  I have to know that he, like any child, I want to know my dad and I want him to know me.
[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:09.400]  I'm his only son in the world and he's my only dad.
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:13.400]  We have to come together. We have to.
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:21.400]  If black lives truly matter to you, please contact me.
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:24.400]  At Danny underscore Williams.
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:29.400]  And we're gonna put his Facebook up obviously that broke a few weeks ago as he went public there.
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:34.400]  We're gonna link that in the article that's up on drugsreport.com. We're gonna add that to there.
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:37.400]  I am the son of Bill Clinton.
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:43.400]  It's up on infowars.com. It's the top story on drugsreport.com.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:47.400]  Clinton's son in quotes speaks.
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:52.400]  And I've talked to on record and off record to the state police.
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:57.400]  People, by the way, have been killed for snipping around about this story and others just so you know.
[01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:02.400]  So Mr. Williams, I think is in danger. I think everybody does. These are very dangerous people.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:08.400]  I came, I saw he died in hundreds of thousands of people in North Africa. That's Hillary for you.
[01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:15.400]  And Joy Behar, you know, and the view we're calling the rape victims and people tramps for daring to go to the debate.
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:21.400]  At the end of the clips that we have up on infowars.com from the view a few days ago, yesterday morning.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:28.400]  They put a cherry on top and say it doesn't matter. You know, Hillary would never have been with Bill if she knew about all this.
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:37.400]  She was in charge of it. She chose him because he was flawed and she could control him. She's always been the boss.
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:47.400]  She has him under control. That's why she didn't defend him the other night. People couldn't believe it because it's all true.
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:56.400]  So we're going to play a short clip here of Joy Behar just just to give you an idea about the attack the victims and what they do. Here it is.
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:08.400]  When he brought up these allegations, I wonder if she missed the opportunity to address it in a way that the public would understand that that's just not how you behave.
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:16.400]  I would like to apologize to those tramps that have slept with my husband. Maybe she could have said that.
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:21.400]  And then the New York Times calls Donald Trump saying women throw themselves at me. I'm such a big star.
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:26.400]  I'm not a narcissistic American. I don't like it. Trump said he's grown a lot the last 11 years, but whatever.
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:32.400]  You're not selling missile stickers to the Communist Chinese and putting jihadis in to kill 200,000 Christians and sell five-year-olds into sex slavery.
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:40.400]  They're not making failed states everywhere. They're not sleeping in the same room with a daughter or the woman that runs basically the feminine side of the caliphate.
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:46.400]  I mean, you cannot make this up. And all the new emails about keeping us in the dark, creating race war, creating division.
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:53.400]  Right on the shotgun, I'm going to come back and take some of your calls. I had some big guests today, veterans that are here with a movie coming out about battles that happened and stuff.
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:59.400]  I've got to move them to the fourth hour if they can do it. They're also being interviewed by Joe Biggs, but that's got to be preempted and invite them back because just too much is breaking.
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:08.400]  This was supposed to break tomorrow. And again, I'm not even in the soup. I was just told they wanted me to have one of the exclusives because they, you know, Danny likes the show.
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:11.400]  It's been in contact with Joe Biggs. Actually, he likes Joe Biggs working my work.
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:18.400]  And so this, and I just kind of a hands off guy. If something falls in our lap, it does. I've known about the story 20 years since he was like 10 years old.
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:25.400]  Williams knows that. And so look for more exclusives tomorrow. I'm just going to leave it at that for you.
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:32.400]  What's more exclusive than a video of Danny Williams? Everybody can maybe do some math and what two plus two equals.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:39.400]  But briefly, this is an expensive operation to run. We just sent Owen up there with a crew to cover the big debates and got huge coverage.
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:48.400]  Really important intel back to you and your family. We're your probe droids. We're, we're out there around the world, around the country, ferreting, working, running around like madmen.
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:58.400]  And so, you know, a lot of folks say that Hilary works like a demon. Bill says that. Well, we work. We work like a, I don't know, like dynamos around here.
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:03.400]  And I'm so proud of the crew and the work they're doing and you, the listeners that help us and support us with the info and more.
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:11.400]  So briefly, I'm going to throw this out to folks. We use your support and we're ending a big special today.
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:16.400]  A 23% off on our flagship product, DNA force, cleans out the cells, the mitochondria.
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:21.400]  You can actually say that there's 175 studies just on BioPQQ. It's an amazing formula.
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:31.400]  It looks like it's expensive. Leading competitors are $400, $500, you know, four or five times this because just what's in a bottle costs us 40 to 50 bucks just for one of the ingredients.
[01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:35.400]  So our products usually have 60, 70, 80, 100% markup. That helps fund us.
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:39.400]  The average industry has a three, four, five or even six or seven markup.
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:43.400]  So no one can get something like this because it'd be 600 bucks. We don't do that.
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:49.400]  The only place they sell things similar are, again, our medical clinics. They're not prescription, but people won't spend that money unless it's a doctor.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:52.400]  The only place you get the next level of nutraceuticals is at a doctor's office.
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:58:01.400]  We've decided to just go after the high end clinics, offer stuff even better at one third or one fifth or one sixth the price.
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:29.400]  M4WarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139. We can answer all your questions. Take your order. Our new Biome Defense. Amazing probiotics out.

[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:34.400]  With only 27 fleeting days left until the election, we have entered the final countdown.
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:39.400]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:49.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:49.400 --> 01:59:01.400]  More than two years ago, M4Wars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ.
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:09.400]  And how the government, knowingly, started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:19.400]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:32.400]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:34.400]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:41.400]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[01:59:41.400 --> 02:00:04.400]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at M4WarsLive.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:27.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:42.400]  All right, Ellen Schroyer is riding the shotgun with me. I had a couple of great veteran patriots coming in today that are also going to be on the Mountain News at Biggs tonight.
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:51.400]  The whole Danny Williams thing has been percolating here for years. We've had Danny contacting myself, contacting Biggs.
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:01:01.400]  He works two jobs. He's got several kids. He's been with the same lady the whole time, church guy, whole nine yards.
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:06.400]  He's a really credible person, and I've been covering his story since he was 10 years old.
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:15.400]  I've seen the Clintons put out a fake DNA test. They got caught. It was fake. That's in the article. This is amazing.
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:22.400]  They were having a whole bunch of other media hammering them to let us put it out first, let us put it out first. I sat back and I said, fine, let them put it out first.
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:26.400]  I don't care. That's fine. And then for some reason at the end, they said, no, we want you to put it out first.
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:33.400]  And I don't want to obsess over that. I can just tell a lot of folks out there get really pissed because this is like one of the big October surprises.
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:45.400]  And I don't know. I'm chomping at the bit once I'm on air, but when it comes to stuff and hosting people and breaking news, I kind of get just ice water in my veins. And that's how we continue to get the big stories.
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:50.400]  All I care about is getting justice for this young man. I believe he's Bill Clinton's illegitimate son.
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:56.400]  Clinton was known for banging every hooker in Little Rock, every hooker in Hot Springs. His real mother wasn't a nurse. She was a prostitute.
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:02:05.400]  He's probably a Rockefeller son. That's why the Kennedy visited with him. The Rockefellers helped him while he cries. There's only two people believe I could be president when I was 16 years old.
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:16.400]  And that was my mama and David Rockefeller. We can find out David Rockefeller. He can find that tape. Bill Clinton thanks David Rockefeller.
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:22.400]  And of course, it was Governor Rockefeller that's his dad. It's just that Rockefeller took him under his wing.
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:27.400]  That's not the first time these big, powerful robber barons have that bunch of illegitimate kids they put in positions of power.
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:38.400]  That's what you're supposed to do. Danny Williams got just thrown to the curb, but there's a lot of chief executives out there and powerful men that their right-hand guy when they're 75 is their 40-year-old son from a mistress.
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:42.400]  And it's a really trashy thing to throw your kid under the bus like that. What do you think?
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:52.400]  Well, I think, again, it's amazing that he just completely ignores it. I don't know why you wouldn't want to clear the record on this. And I think the reason why you say, oh, you know, I don't need to break this story.
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:58.400]  Maybe we can break it. It doesn't matter to you. But you already broke the story. Alex, you broke the story 10 years ago. You broke the story 20 years ago.
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:06.400]  It's the same thing with all of these email leaks that we're getting from WikiLeaks. Like, okay, this is great. Like, I mean, obviously, like, I mean, this is where the rubber meets the road.
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:13.400]  This is the proof. I mean, we got them. We caught them red-handed. But we've been saying this for years. There's nothing in these emails that we didn't already report on.
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:19.400]  There's nothing in these emails that we didn't already try to tell you. So it does confirm everything we've said and what Drudges said and what WorldNet Daily said.
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:27.400]  And look at this. Diller, the big Democrat, Trump presidential run is an evil miracle. I've got a dark heart. We're evil. We're an evil miracle.
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:33.400]  No, that's what that's who they are. I mean, did you see these emails where they're discussing, we got to keep the public in the dark or starting to wake up?
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:40.400]  And Alex, what is their response? I have it in the video at WashU at the debate. What is their response?
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:48.400]  I don't care. Literally. They don't care. They don't care that their candidate has been caught talking bad about them.
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:52.400]  They don't care that their candidate got caught rigging the election. They don't care that their candidate...
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:55.400]  I heard an audio of Trump saying, I hate the American people. I'm done.
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:04:06.400]  But no, the truth is that people have done him a long time. He gets really sentimental and weird around the American people and poor people and really, really wants to like build prosperity.
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:13.400]  Well, I don't know if you happen to see any of his rally at Wilkes Pennsylvania yesterday. Amazing. Amazing.
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:23.400]  I would say this to people, if you're on the fence, even if you don't like Donald Trump, if you watch that rally, it shows that this is not about Donald Trump.
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:25.400]  This truly is a movement.
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:27.400]  He is what we've been waiting for.
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:32.400]  I'm going to be honest. Ten years ago, I saw some of his shows. I thought he was an arrogant, narcissist, probably a liberal.
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:40.400]  I don't like golden airplanes and all this stuff. I mean, I don't mind his hot wife or whatever the point is. That's not my style, okay?
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:42.400]  And I'm pretty conservative.
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:48.400]  But the guy I've seen the last few years and stuff he did even 20 years ago on Afternoon Gap, there was a battle of two Trumps.
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:55.400]  And he's really transformed and is touched by all this and understands he's in history and has become much more humble under the attack.
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:05:18.400]  And folks, he's gone through hell too. Don't forget that. We'll be right back.
[02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:35.400]  It includes details of Badowski's exchange with someone in the media who told him that there are people close to the Clintons who say William Jefferson Clinton's sex life could be damaging to her.
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:46.400]  Although Badowski stresses his view that the more Bill Clinton the better for Hillary, he adds that there were people purportedly close to the Clintons pushing the line that the less Bill Clinton the better.
[02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:54.400]  Whoever is peddling this crap from somewhere within the Clinton camp is having the effect of encouraging the media to give the issue more prominence complains Badowski.
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:59.400]  You can find more reports like this as we expose the Clintons at infowars.com.
[02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:33.400]  There are 299% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:34.400]  The day of doom is here.
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:44.400]  Full sedum and his mountain of power, atop it sits, his king, George Soros, launching divisions, civil war and death.
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:58.400]  But the American people and others across the globe are scaling the mountains and are now in the mountain, engaging the forces of the snake.
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:02.400]  You haven't seen Conan the Barbarian. I'm doing an allegory of what's happening currently with that.
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:10.400]  Full sedum and his mountain of power. Is there a dagger such as this? For me? Good movie.
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:18.400]  You know who wrote it? Oliver Stone. Now the next one was super cheesy and horrible and unwatchable Conan the Destroyer.
[02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:24.400]  Conan the Barbarian is a real classic shot in Spain. Amazing. Can't watch the movie enough.
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:26.400]  So I need to, is that my assignment?
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:29.400]  Yeah, I may have to fire you. You don't like that thing?
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:33.400]  You hear that, Rob do? I got to go home right after this and I got to go watch Conan the Barbarian.
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:35.400]  Have ladies in bikinis while you're watching.
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:38.400]  The day of doom is here.
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:43.400]  The day of doom is here, Alex. And I'm hoping that it's the day of doom for the Clinton crime syndicate.
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:45.400]  That's what I'm hoping. Not for us.
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:48.400]  Full sedum and his mountain of power.
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:50.400]  Not for pretty good Max Von Setout imitation.
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:52.400]  Not for Drudge and Infowars.
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:53.400]  Do you know who Max Von Setout is?
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:54.400]  No.
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:55.400]  You're getting more troll by the minute.
[02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:56.400]  Oh boy.
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:00.400]  I'm being serious. I got a little excited about Fight the New World Order.
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:06.400]  I want to go to phone calls. You've been incredible champs, Quincy and Scott and Matt and Sherry.
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:13.400]  Probably just as big as this, though, is the fact that we have the New York commissioner of elections
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:19.400]  caught in a Christmas party 10 months ago, 11 months ago, saying, I don't like it.
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:24.400]  The Democrats bus around the candidates, these buses, the poor people to all the different polling places
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:28.400]  and have them vote over and over again with dead people and folks' names.
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:30.400]  We'll say it on camera. Oh no, I don't want to do that.
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:36.400]  Meanwhile, they don't want to have any voter ID. Listen, I'm anti-police state, but we've lost that battle.
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:38.400]  Showing IDs here, there, there.
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:41.400]  If I'm going to show up for everything, including wiping my rear end, you should have to show it.
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:44.400]  You're a citizen and that you're in the right spot, vote in the right place.
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:46.400]  You would think that'd be, you know, how to keep the rig on.
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:48.400]  Well, there's an old phenomenon where folks go to vote and they can't.
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:49.400]  We've already voted.
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:51.400]  That happened to me like 10 years ago.
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:53.400]  I didn't realize what was happening.
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:55.400]  What was happening is someone had voted in my name.
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:11:00.400]  Isn't that, isn't that, this is the perfect illustration of what these, how these people think.
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:03.400]  It's like, oh, there's no conspiracies. Oh, there's no rigged elections.
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:07.400]  We don't need voter IDs. It's not a problem. Just go vote. Just say your Eminem.
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:09.400]  Say your Marshall matters. I'm going to go vote. I'll say.
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:11.400]  Oh, that's right. People went and voted.
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:13.400]  Veritas, they went and voted as Eminem.
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:14.400]  Yeah. Yeah.
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:16.400]  So who, why do you need an ID to vote?
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:19.400]  Stole Eminems in his district stole his identity.
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:21.400]  There's no voter fraud. What's a rigged election?
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:24.400]  By the way, the feds were talking about charges on him for that.
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:26.400]  They want to leave it open. So it can be stolen.
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:28.400]  The investigator that exposes it, they want to charge you.
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:30.400]  Everything is awesome.
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:33.400]  We have that at the bottom of the hour.
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:35.400]  I'm going to sing along to the Lego.
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:38.400]  I mean, it's, it's sadly illustrative though of how these,
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:40.400]  you know, that is the average Democratic voter.
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:43.400]  They literally, I mean, Republican voters, they got some problems,
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:46.400]  but man, the Democratic voter is like that Lego character in there.
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:48.400]  Well, and it's crazy because Hillary just blew up all countries.
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:50.400]  It's awesome. She's so liberal.
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:54.400]  And all of these Republicans now it's like you're either, you're either for Trump
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:56.400]  or you're against Trump. Paul Ryan, he can't decide.
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:58.400]  He wants to dip his toes in the water.
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:00.400]  Paul Ryan is a globalist operative.
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:05.400]  But what you're seeing is Donald Trump and whoever is supporting him.
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:08.400]  In this case, we're going beyond the Republican party.
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:10.400]  Well, don't panic in calling him the evil miracle.
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:13.400]  Because they know in real polls, he's 10 points ahead, baby.
[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:14.400]  It's not even close.
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:17.400]  It's like 15 though. This is about five points.
[02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:19.400]  Listen to this though, Alex.
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:23.400]  Well, we've obviously documented the rallies and who's dominating at the rallies.
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:25.400]  I think if you added up the attendance at the rallies,
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:28.400]  Trump might win by hundreds of thousands of people.
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:31.400]  If you go on the internet, YouTube, whatever, Hillary videos,
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:33.400]  don't get half the views.
[02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:35.400]  Most of the, it's dislikes.
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:37.400]  You'll never find a video with more dislikes.
[02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:41.400]  It'll be 10,000, you know, dislikes, 25 likes.
[02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:42.400]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:43.400]  Only on a Hillary video.
[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:46.400]  But our videos are like 20,000 likes, 200 dislikes.
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:48.400]  Same with the Trump rally video.
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:49.400]  It gets almost 100,000.
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:52.400]  And conservatives generally are not seen as being as tech active.
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:54.400]  So it's even worse.
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:59.400]  And now what I'm seeing, and this is not something that I saw up until honestly,
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:01.400]  just the last couple of weeks.
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:05.400]  I like to typically monitor C-SPAN because it's a good place to actually see what
[02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:09.400]  people in the government are saying and see what other people who are calling in think too.
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:11.400]  It is now not even close.
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:14.400]  It used to be about 50-50 with pro-Trump, anti-Trump.
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:18.400]  It's nine out of 10, eight out of 10, every morning you listen to C-SPAN,
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:22.400]  people calling in saying they want Donald Trump.
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:25.400]  They can't, we cannot let them steal this election.
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:28.400]  Hillary has an average of about 100 people, Trump about 20,000.
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:30.400]  And they usually turn away tens of thousands.
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:33.400]  I mean, in Austin, there were traffic jams two and a half, three miles away.
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:34.400]  Couldn't even get in.
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:36.400]  They got 20,000 in, turned away 20,000.
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:41.400]  Yeah, the video, I mean, the St. Louis rally where we found AIDS Skrillex in that video.
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:43.400]  I wanted to go to the Trump rally inside that day.
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:45.400]  I got there two hours early.
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:48.400]  I didn't even bother getting in line because the line was two miles long.
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:49.400]  It would have been pointless.
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:53.400]  By the way, this is like discovering the wheel or fire or combustion engine.
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:55.400]  You and Rob do discovered AIDS Skrillex.
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:57.400]  Well, it was actually Josh Owens.
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:13:58.400]  It was Josh Owens.
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:13:59.400]  I got it all mixed up.
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:03.400]  Josh Owens, you guys deserve like at the end of episode four Star Wars,
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:06.400]  everybody salutes you and you get like golden amulets.
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:08.400]  Everybody salutes you.
[02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:09.400]  You know what?
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:12.400]  I don't want that, but actually I've thought we should do it.
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:14.400]  We should actually have an alternative news.
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:19.400]  I already have offered 10,000 each of those guys to the ultimate social justice warriors to come on.
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:21.400]  And I know we discovered where they live.
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:22.400]  We should go there.
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:25.400]  Well, I won't get, I can't, we won't get too into that.
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:26.400]  Lovingly though.
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:27.400]  We love Miriam Flowers.
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:28.400]  Gold.
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:29.400]  We won't get too into that.
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:30.400]  Frankincense, Murr.
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:31.400]  I will say though, you know what?
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:33.400]  You have, you've made a great crew here.
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:35.400]  Everybody that I've worked with has been great.
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:38.400]  But me and Josh, when we go out for whatever reason, we find gold.
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:39.400]  Oh, you guys came back.
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:40.400]  Oh, you guys have it already.
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:41.400]  We found the gold.
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:42.400]  See, I don't pay attention to what you're doing.
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:44.400]  I mean, it's not that I'm micromanaging or not caring.
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:46.400]  It's that I literally just let you guys fire torpedoes.
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:48.400]  I didn't realize we just revealed, oh my God.
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:49.400]  No, no, no, no.
[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:50.400]  Well, hold on.
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:51.400]  I knew you were, oh my God.
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:53.400]  There's nothing we can reveal right now.
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:54.400]  Oh my God.
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:55.400]  But there is.
[02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:56.400]  Oh my God.
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:58.400]  I forgot you guys were kind of visiting when you were there.
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:14:59.400]  See.
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:00.400]  Do you want me to talk about it?
[02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:02.400]  Do you want me to tell you what happened?
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:03.400]  He doesn't even know about this, folks.
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:04.400]  He doesn't even know about this.
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:05.400]  I would be telling you.
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:07.400]  I'm too busy dealing with October surprise.
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:08.400]  Well, okay.
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:09.400]  So here's what happened.
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:11.400]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:12.400]  Do you have footage of this?
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:15.400]  We've got some footage, but it's nothing that we want to show yet.
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:17.400]  It's nothing we can show yet.
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:18.400]  You know what?
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:21.400]  I mean, we could show it, but I don't want you to tell me what happened.
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:22.400]  Okay.
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:23.400]  I'll keep you.
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:24.400]  I'll keep you in the dark on this one.
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:25.400]  We're working on it.
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:26.400]  We're working on it.
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:28.400]  But usually we want you to come on the show, man.
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:29.400]  We don't hate you.
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:30.400]  We don't hate you, dude.
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:31.400]  We're offering you money.
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:34.400]  We actually feel bad that you've been brainwashed.
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:35.400]  This happened to you.
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:41.400]  We want to lovingly deprogram you, take you water surfing, take you hanging out.
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:42.400]  Shoot a gun.
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:43.400]  We'll go shoot guns.
[02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:44.400]  Absolutely.
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:45.400]  Go have a steak dinner.
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:47.400]  We want to explain what we're doing.
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:49.400]  We want renaissance.
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:51.400]  We are the liberals.
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:53.400]  Trust us.
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:55.400]  What you're getting into is not liberal.
[02:15:55.400 --> 02:15:57.400]  It's a false paradigm.
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:15:59.400]  And we don't want to make fun of you.
[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:04.400]  We want to even halfway get you to be happy and friendly with us and then kind of de-escalate
[02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:08.400]  attacking you and have a real discussion where you don't scream we're f-ing white males when
[02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:11.400]  you're an f-ing white male and actually rehabilitate you.
[02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:13.400]  And I don't mean that condescendingly, but come on.
[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:14.400]  I mean, really.
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:18.400]  And have a loving moment here, like we did with the Obama phone lady.
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:23.400]  And here's what I've said to people like Age Skrillex or people I've had on the show that
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:24.400]  have different point of views.
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:26.400]  You know, we could have a panel.
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:29.400]  We can bring in people with different views from us.
[02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:30.400]  We can bring in Hillary supporters.
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:31.400]  He can be one of them.
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:32.400]  They never want to come on.
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:33.400]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:35.400]  It doesn't matter how much money you offer them.
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:36.400]  It doesn't matter.
[02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:37.400]  And they'll go on the street.
[02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:38.400]  I'm a lesbian.
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:39.400]  I bet you don't like that.
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:43.400]  And I'll just go, did you ever hear me attack you in any way?
[02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:45.400]  They want to go on the street for a cause.
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:47.400]  For a cause, right?
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:51.400]  They're moved by this cause of theirs that they're going to go on the street, but then
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:52.400]  when you ask them a new platform.
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:54.400]  And they're projecting on to us that we hate them.
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:56.400]  And they don't want to go on your platform.
[02:16:56.400 --> 02:16:57.400]  No, you hate us.
[02:16:57.400 --> 02:16:58.400]  Why won't they come on your platform?
[02:16:58.400 --> 02:17:00.400]  He's like explaining that Donald Trump was against the war.
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:02.400]  And he goes, shut up, you f-ing white male.
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:04.400]  It's the same dynamic as Bill Clinton.
[02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:05.400]  I've got to hang out with Carl DeKalb.
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:07.400]  Not taking a DNA test.
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:10.400]  This guy could be a TV star.
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:11.400]  I mean, he already is.
[02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:12.400]  He could be on.
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:14.400]  These guys are ridiculous.
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:16.400]  They could be on info wars.
[02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:22.400]  They don't realize how much raw, raw energy they've got.
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:25.400]  And they could be sitting right here next to me telling me why they feel this way.
[02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:29.400]  Sticking up for Hillary, sticking up for the Democratic platform.
[02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:32.400]  I've got to go to calls.
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:35.400]  And I want to get to the video of the latest kind of boil down of St. Louis.
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:41.400]  If you just joined us, drudgereport.com, infowars.com, it's all up there.
[02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:46.400]  It is the big exclusive banished, the untold story of Danny Williams.
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:47.400]  Search for his father.
[02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:49.400]  We permitted here last hour.
[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:53.400]  The video you can see it is on infowars.com, presidentplanet.com.
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:55.400]  And I hope it's been sent to Facebook as well.
[02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:58.400]  Because we were going to have a big article written about this and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:00.400]  We want to pin that to the top.
[02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:02.400]  Everyone ran with the Trump video.
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:04.400]  You think they'll run with this?
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:06.400]  I think you're going to see this video on every mainstream news.
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:07.400]  No, but here's the good news.
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:16.400]  They think they can sit there on Fox, on CNN, on MSNBC, and only show her wobble to begin to have the convulsion.
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:20.400]  I'm just giving this network break to begin to have the convulsion and then not fall down.
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:23.400]  And they go conspiracy theorist claims she fell down.
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:24.400]  All she did was stumble.
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:25.400]  I have Fox host.
[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:26.400]  I have CNN host.
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:27.400]  I have MSNBC host.
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:28.400]  I have MSNBC host.
[02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:33.400]  You're lying when everyone saw her fall on her face having a convulsion and putting the black ambulance.
[02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:35.400]  She drives around in a fricking ambulance.
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:37.400]  Like you dragging me across the floor right now.
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:38.400]  And then everyone's saying, what?
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:40.400]  Alex was just helping him walk out of here.
[02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:44.400]  Yeah, they sit there and think they can just deceive everybody.
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:46.400]  Drudge has billions of visitors a month.
[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:49.400]  Hundreds of millions of folks come, but over and over again, so it's billions.
[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:51.400]  We have millions and millions every day.
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:52.400]  Tens of millions every week.
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:54.400]  Our videos, I mean, I'm not exaggerating.
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:56.400]  When I say 30 million viewers and listeners a week, that's conservative.
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:58.400]  It was like 26 million a few months ago.
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:00.400]  It's just straight up.
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:04.400]  And of course, even on big shows like The Daily Show, which does have four, five, six million viewers, you know,
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:06.400]  entertainment is really brainwashing.
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:08.400]  Brainwashing news, masquerading is entertainment.
[02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:10.400]  They get in a happy mode and know you're not being critical.
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:13.400]  Then they go, look at these conservatives and libertarians.
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:14.400]  This lady's got 68 million.
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:15.400]  This guy's got 25 million.
[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:16.400]  Just one video.
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:17.400]  This next few has 5 million.
[02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:18.400]  12 million, 20 million.
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:19.400]  Let's go.
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:22.400]  This poll watch has got 20 million, 50 million, 18 million, 19 million, 5 million.
[02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:23.400]  And they're like, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:25.400]  You know, you've got millions of views on your videos.
[02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:27.400]  I mean, they're just dilute.
[02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:28.400]  No one wants to watch you.
[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:30.400]  They know you're a fop.
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:32.400]  It's, it's lazy is what it is.
[02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:33.400]  It's laziness.
[02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:35.400]  You just, you know, click on it.
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:41.400]  No one wants to hear the same variance of talking points with a bunch of talking heads acting like they're debating and acting like they're
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:43.400]  intellectual, but they do.
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:46.400]  Hillary didn't really fall down.
[02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:48.400]  The racist Alex Jones said she did.
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:50.400]  Drudge got caught lying again.
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:53.400]  He says there's a penalty if you don't get Obamacare.
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:57.400]  Everybody then gets the penalty and they go, the media's lying.
[02:19:57.400 --> 02:20:01.400]  Well, I heard Donald Trump say he wants to grab women in an inappropriate place.
[02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:03.400]  He's a, I can't vote for him.
[02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:04.400]  It's clearly all edited together.
[02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:06.400]  It's like, these women throw themselves at you when you're a star.
[02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:08.400]  You just grab them and they wouldn't care.
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:09.400]  It's like the, I mean.
[02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:10.400]  They're grabbing you.
[02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:11.400]  Stupid.
[02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:12.400]  Here's the thing.
[02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:14.400]  All of these people, who's buying, who's buying.
[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:15.400]  Hotel room.
[02:20:15.400 --> 02:20:16.400]  Door opens, woman jumps on you.
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:17.400]  I think, what was it?
[02:20:17.400 --> 02:20:20.400]  100 million copies sold to 50 Shader of Gray.
[02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:21.400]  Who bought those books?
[02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:22.400]  Men didn't buy those books.
[02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:23.400]  I guarantee you that.
[02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:26.400]  I guarantee you men didn't buy 100 million copies of 50 Shader of Gray.
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:28.400]  Women act more like men ever did.
[02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:31.400]  It's, it's like, it's like running around like piranhas.
[02:20:31.400 --> 02:20:34.400]  I, you know, it was a sexual assault when a woman, you know,
[02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:36.400]  a sister whistles at you and says, Hey baby.
[02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:40.400]  And all of these movie stars that all of these trendy liberals probably follow on Twitter.
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:44.400]  Oh, Hillary hangs out with the worst horrible rappers that objectify women down to property.
[02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:46.400]  Look, I'm, I'm sure you've been around this.
[02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:47.400]  If you're around.
[02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:49.400]  I'm not defending what Trump did.
[02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:55.400]  The point is you have a giant mountain of evil, Hillary, and then this obviously sneak attack from 11 years ago.
[02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:57.400]  It's hypocrisy on PCP.
[02:20:57.400 --> 02:20:58.400]  We got to go to the calls.
[02:20:58.400 --> 02:21:00.400]  I appreciate Quincy holding.
[02:21:00.400 --> 02:21:01.400]  I appreciate to Scott holding.
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:05.400]  I appreciate every Matt and Sherry and Decker and Kebler and everybody else.
[02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:06.400]  Quincy in Ohio.
[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:11.400]  You're on the year with Owen Schroyer and Alex Jones, the Danny Williams info dropped.
[02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:14.400]  Hey, Alex, thanks for, thanks for taking my call.
[02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:16.400]  Actually, just call me to, if you would.
[02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:17.400]  All right.
[02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:21.400]  Hey, thanks for putting your life on the line for this movement.
[02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:24.400]  You're a true patriot and you're in my prayers.
[02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:26.400]  I'm sure you're in everybody's prayers.
[02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:28.400]  There's a couple of things I wanted to talk about.
[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:29.400]  Number one was WikiLeaks.
[02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:31.400]  That was what we started with.
[02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:33.400]  The second thing is voter fraud.
[02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:34.400]  Yes, sir.
[02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:41.400]  As it relates to WikiLeaks, one of my concerns, I'm glad to see it's coming out, but it's coming out towards the end.
[02:21:41.400 --> 02:21:46.400]  I just feel like we're being deluged with information and I'm afraid it's going to get polluted.
[02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:50.400]  I hear you, but I kind of see they knew Hillary would launch her attacks late.
[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:55.400]  And so I want to say Assange, I mean, I was wrong.
[02:21:55.400 --> 02:21:58.400]  I mean, he did crawl everybody.
[02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:04.400]  So people understand why I did it, but I just want to be a man and say that Assange is really delivering now.
[02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:05.400]  So I appreciate that.
[02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:07.400]  His GPA went back up.
[02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:08.400]  Absolutely.
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:10.400]  I give him a 3.8 right now with you.
[02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:11.400]  Yeah.
[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:16.400]  I think we've had him down at like the 3.2 and now he's back up at a 3.8.
[02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:19.400]  And by the way, I'll give him myself a 3.0.
[02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:21.400]  He's modest.
[02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:22.400]  Let's call her.
[02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:23.400]  Go ahead.
[02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:24.400]  Sorry.
[02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:26.400]  I'm sure he's going to hit 4.0 before the end of the month.
[02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:28.400]  So he'll give us the information we need.
[02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:36.400]  You know, the second thing we were talking about, you know, earlier, talking about voter fraud, you know, you know, we've got to actually have voter fraud where there are multiple votes.
[02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:37.400]  There's dead people voting.
[02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:41.400]  You have, you know, you have the head of the New York Election Commission saying it.
[02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:45.400]  Yes, I saw the video this morning on Drudge.
[02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:46.400]  It's really interesting.
[02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:50.400]  There's the proof right there, but you're not going to get the people to the right people to watch it.
[02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:52.400]  We need the independence and some of the Democrats.
[02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:58.400]  Well, that's why all of us have to reach out to these people lovingly and give them the info.
[02:22:58.400 --> 02:22:59.400]  Absolutely.
[02:22:59.400 --> 02:23:02.400]  You know, and, you know, you talk about voter fraud, you talk about election fraud.
[02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:13.400]  One thing that really concerns me is the electoral college, you know, there's particular people that I think that the top people in our government can reach out to on Election Day and sway their vote.
[02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:22.400]  You know, if it's just if it's something close and Trump has got a particular district or an area and I believe these people can be, you know, can be swayed.
[02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:23.400]  Absolutely.
[02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:25.400]  And beyond that, everybody's like, what's a big country?
[02:23:25.400 --> 02:23:27.400]  Where do you go to catch the fraud?
[02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:40.400]  If citizens go out in the early morning on November 8th and you go out to the polling places in the key battleground areas in Democrat districts, they're going to be there cramming ballots with fake names.
[02:23:40.400 --> 02:23:42.400]  They're putting through dead people.
[02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:44.400]  Folks they know haven't voted in 20 years.
[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:45.400]  This is what they do.
[02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:46.400]  You catch that on tape.
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:47.400]  You catch somebody doing it.
[02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:48.400]  That will devastate them.
[02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:50.400]  We get 20, 30 videos of this nationwide.
[02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:55.400]  It will have public opinion on the side for a recount and then it'll come out Trump one.
[02:23:55.400 --> 02:23:56.400]  Let me tell you, they're freaking out.
[02:23:56.400 --> 02:23:58.400]  Trump's going to fight.
[02:23:58.400 --> 02:23:59.400]  He knows he's ahead.
[02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:03.400]  His internal polls and they're going to pull something big.
[02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:13.400]  But but expanding what you said, we've got to go in and look, I put my mouth is you need to go to Democratic areas and go into Democrat bar and talk to them.
[02:24:13.400 --> 02:24:14.400]  But I'm saying what's going to happen.
[02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:19.400]  You're going to find out they agree with you and don't like Hillary.
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:20.400]  That's what I'm telling you.
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:21.400]  That's why the fraud so big.
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:23.400]  Most Democrats aren't supporting him.
[02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:34.400]  You go to buffoon area colleges and buffoon area trendy areas, young idiots that never had a job in their life and are on their third, you know, third deal at college because there is no future and they're still getting rope adoped.
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:35.400]  They're victims.
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:37.400]  They are going to hiss and attack you.
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:42.400]  But if you go talking to working class or middle class liberals or quote minorities, they're not stupid.
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:45.400]  They know the economy is falling apart.
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:46.400]  They know Hillary's a damn witch.
[02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:47.400]  Go ahead.
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:57.400]  Well, the gravity of this election is so powerful that what we're seeing is, OK, so let's say 50% of the population is politically involved and informed and 50% isn't.
[02:24:57.400 --> 02:24:59.400]  So these other 50% they're paying attention to sports.
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:00.400]  They're paying attention to this.
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:01.400]  That's the other thing.
[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:05.400]  Well, the gravity of this election is so powerful that now they're being drug in this direction.
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:06.400]  Yes.
[02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:07.400]  That's what we want to do.
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:08.400]  It's waking them up.
[02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:16.400]  And what I've experienced, in fact, just on this trip alone after this debate, I heard multiple people who said, Hey, you know,
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:19.400]  just in conversation, whatever, around the airport, around the bus station, all this.
[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:20.400]  Hey, you see that debate last night?
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:21.400]  Yeah.
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:22.400]  Yeah.
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:25.400]  And they're saying, wow, I'm shocked, but Donald Trump was actually really good.
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:26.400]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:27.400]  He actually came.
[02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:28.400]  He surprised.
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:29.400]  I actually think I like Donald Trump.
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:32.400]  So there's this untapped voters out there.
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:33.400]  And that's why they're panicking.
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:36.400]  You got a lot of these areas, half the people going into Hispanic.
[02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:37.400]  We have rallies.
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:39.400]  It's like there's like 40% black people there.
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:40.400]  I love that.
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:41.400]  I mean, I love it.
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:42.400]  It's breaking through.
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:45.400]  The Democrats see that and panic because they always said, don't go to a patriot meeting.
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:46.400]  You're not wanted.
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:49.400]  So they get hugged and taken to dinner and it's all real.
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:54.400]  And that's what's panicking everyone because it's, it's, it's lowering the facade.
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:58.400]  And exactly a lot of folks go, I'm not sure about Trump, but I'm going to go see when
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:25:59.400]  they come out.
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:00.400]  They go, wow, that was great.
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:01.400]  Yeah.
[02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:02.400]  I'm going to support Trump now.
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:04.400]  And that's what's got him panicking their whole parent folks.
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:05.400]  It's a route.
[02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:07.400]  He was going to win by a landslide.
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:10.400]  All these dirty tricks, lying polls saying he's way behind.
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:13.400]  That's getting some weak minded people to pull their support.
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:15.400]  So now his lead has narrowed.
[02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:17.400]  I'm going to be honest, five, 10 points.
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:22.400]  But just the fact that the whole mainstream media has had to go to thermal meltdown to
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:25.400]  even have this effect shows they're on fumes.
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:26.400]  They're running out.
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:27.400]  Their days are numbered.
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:28.400]  Go ahead, Quincy.
[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:29.400]  Cube.
[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:30.400]  Oh, they're running scared.
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:31.400]  What about verification?
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:36.400]  I mean, if you look at, if you look back at the, for example, 2012 with Romney in Ohio
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:40.400]  here, I could drive down the road and find 20 to one Romney signs to Hillary Clinton.
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:41.400]  But of course he lost.
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:42.400]  Of course.
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:43.400]  This is him.
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:44.400]  But he lost.
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:48.400]  But if you look at the, you can go back and look at the election results and you can look
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:49.400]  at it by district.
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:57.320]  When you look at it by district, you'll see that it was Romney, 861 votes, Obama, 873.
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:05.120]  The next district, Romney, 970 votes, Obama, 992.
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:11.200]  Every district it seems that you look at, it always shows that it just, it just smells
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:15.120]  of fraud that they went in there and they always, either they flipped it or they just
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:18.200]  wanted to always make it where Obama just had a few more.
[02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:23.240]  If you had a verification process, you know, I mean, you listen to Trump and I love listening
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:24.240]  to him.
[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:26.840]  Every speech seems to be different, but he's just getting the message out.
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:30.440]  He's very powerful in his speaking, in his message, but he's always saying, this is an
[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:34.680]  America movement, America, America, this is a movement, this is a movement.
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:38.640]  Alex, I own the domain, America movement.
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:42.320]  I would, I would love to work with you on, on putting together some kind of an app or
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:44.920]  I hear you brother, we're believing, we're trying, we appreciate it.
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:45.920]  Just go do it.
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:47.400]  If it's great, we'll hook Lincoln with you.
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:48.400]  We need the help.
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:50.200]  We just came in court in our own operation, but I hear you.
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:51.720]  God bless you too.
[02:27:51.720 --> 02:27:52.720]  We got to move quick.
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:53.720]  We'll never get these calls here.
[02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:54.720]  I'm horrible.
[02:27:54.720 --> 02:27:55.720]  Scott in Texas.
[02:27:55.720 --> 02:27:56.720]  You're on the air.
[02:27:56.720 --> 02:27:57.720]  Go ahead.
[02:27:57.720 --> 02:27:58.720]  Hi Alex.
[02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:00.720]  Yeah, good to talk to you.
[02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:08.520]  Down here in Houston, we think Trump needs a blockbuster October surprise of his own.
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:09.920]  Backing Hillary is great.
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:14.720]  This is, it's just that is swinging some votes, but he needs issues that will put him over
[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:16.220]  the top.
[02:28:16.220 --> 02:28:18.720]  Something along the line of bail out the people.
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:19.720]  Oh, that's good.
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:21.840]  Well, you know, you bail them out.
[02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:22.840]  You do what Kennedy did.
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:26.560]  He cut taxes in the main bracket, 50% to the rich 30%.
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:30.160]  Tax receipts more than doubled within one year.
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:33.920]  They paid off the debt that was small then brought all the money.
[02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:38.760]  Some was Reagan cut taxes, more money came in, but they just balloon spending.
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:40.160]  Republicans were part of that too.
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:44.280]  But I mean, we know you cut taxes, more money comes in because more money gets spent.
[02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:45.280]  The economy booms.
[02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:46.640]  The globalists don't want a boom economy here.
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:47.640]  They want it in China.
[02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:49.800]  And so I think he's given those speeches.
[02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:52.140]  It's just the media doesn't, doesn't ever carry it.
[02:28:52.140 --> 02:28:56.040]  So how do you get that through to people that really believe they can only get ahead
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:28:57.040]  with the government handout?
[02:28:57.040 --> 02:28:59.040]  How do you do that, Scott?
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:00.040]  Okay.
[02:29:00.040 --> 02:29:01.040]  Here's a blockbuster idea.
[02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:06.080]  They forgive all bank issues, loans to the people, people owned their houses, they owned
[02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:09.480]  their land, they owned their cars, and the banks are out penalized.
[02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:12.120]  They take it off the asset side and the liability side.
[02:29:12.120 --> 02:29:15.480]  Well, I mean, I gotta be honest with you, I don't like the big banks and loan sharking
[02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:16.760]  and payday loans and stuff.
[02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:21.520]  But I mean, if somebody goes and gets a 20 year mortgage on a house and they've been
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:25.880]  paying on it a year, you think it's fair for them to just get the house free?
[02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:29.240]  We're down to the last days, Alex.
[02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:32.320]  Well, I guess he would get all the communists to vote for him that way and we'd win.
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:34.800]  But then he'd, then we'd become what we're fighting.
[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:36.680]  You know, I hear you.
[02:29:36.680 --> 02:29:37.680]  Very interesting.
[02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:38.680]  God bless you, Scott.
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:39.680]  Very interesting point.
[02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:42.960]  We're going to come back with Matt and Sherry and Tony and Luke, everybody else.
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:43.960]  Yeah.
[02:29:43.960 --> 02:29:44.960]  You know, I hear you.
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:48.600]  You know, I say if a company did criminal loans and sold the mortgage more than once,
[02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:49.600]  I say give them the house.
[02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:50.920]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.920 --> 02:29:53.320]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.320 --> 02:30:00.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:05.560]  New WikiLeaks emails, Clinton campaign insiders fear bill sex life could sink Hillary.
[02:30:05.560 --> 02:30:09.960]  They should shut the hell up about this, Podesta told article up by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:30:09.960 --> 02:30:14.600]  The revelation is a particular note because it dovetails with Trump holding a press conference
[02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:18.840]  yesterday before the debate with three up cleanse sexual abuse victims.
[02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:23.120]  The email, which is marked confidential, was sent to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta
[02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:25.920]  by prominent left-wing journalist Brent Badausky.
[02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:30.120]  It includes details of Badausky's exchange with someone in the media who told him that
[02:30:30.120 --> 02:30:34.120]  there are people close to the Clintons who say William Jefferson Clinton sex life could
[02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:35.640]  be damaging to her.
[02:30:35.640 --> 02:30:40.200]  Although Badausky stresses his view that the more Bill Clinton, the better for Hillary,
[02:30:40.200 --> 02:30:44.640]  he adds that there were people purportedly close to the Clintons pushing the line that
[02:30:44.640 --> 02:30:48.920]  the less Bill Clinton, the better whoever is peddling this crap from somewhere within
[02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:53.760]  the Clinton camp is having the effect of encouraging the media to give the issue more prominent
[02:30:53.760 --> 02:30:55.280]  complaints Badausky.

[02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:40.240]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces
[02:31:40.240 --> 02:31:44.520]  who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment
[02:31:44.520 --> 02:31:45.520]  agendas.
[02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:50.440]  Infowars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.
[02:31:50.440 --> 02:31:55.760]  So download Infowars Live today at infowars.com and learn what's really going on instead of
[02:31:55.760 --> 02:31:58.440]  being spoon-fed lies by the mainstream media.
[02:31:58.440 --> 02:32:03.680]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:06.560]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:32:06.560 --> 02:32:12.600]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:32:12.600 --> 02:32:17.560]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking
[02:32:17.560 --> 02:32:22.480]  Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[02:32:22.480 --> 02:32:27.640]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[02:32:27.640 --> 02:32:29.360]  you can to purify your air.
[02:32:29.360 --> 02:32:34.360]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[02:32:34.360 --> 02:32:37.360]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:39.560]  The general public doesn't.
[02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:43.480]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:32:43.480 --> 02:32:47.120]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:32:47.120 --> 02:32:50.640]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[02:32:50.640 --> 02:32:53.840]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:32:53.840 --> 02:33:11.280]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today, and then fullwarstore.com.
[02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:36.240]  And now, the Democrats all over the country from Florida to New York are being caught
[02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:41.800]  announcing that they're going to have busloads of people voting over and over and over again.
[02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:46.240]  The Democratic Party officials and the candidates on the buses with them, in many cases, driving
[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:50.280]  around running everything in giant fraud, according to the head of the New York Election
[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:57.600]  Commission and others, massive, massive, you know, Jane Doe votes going on in Florida on
[02:33:57.600 --> 02:33:58.600]  the ballot.
[02:33:58.600 --> 02:33:59.600]  New York Times saying why?
[02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:00.600]  Preliminary.
[02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:04.880]  Election officials tell us it looks like Hillary's winning in preliminary early voting where
[02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:06.600]  they do the special stuffing.
[02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:09.160]  So get ready for the recounts, get ready for the battle.
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:11.160]  Trump is not rolling over.
[02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:12.160]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:13.680]  I want to go right back to your calls.
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:15.480]  Oh, and Shroyer is here with us.
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:19.000]  Clinton suggests intervention for protesters wearing Clinton rape shirt.
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:20.000]  More of those happening.
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:24.760]  Video African-American man kicked out of Hillary rally for wearing Bill Clinton rape T-shirt.
[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:28.680]  A U.S. Navy destroyer comes under attack off Yemen.
[02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:29.680]  Pentagon.
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:34.440]  U.S. and U.H. and U.S. actively participating in Saudi war crimes targeting the civilians
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:35.440]  in Yemen.
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:39.520]  The U.S. had just dangerously closer to war with Russia.
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:43.040]  What you're not being told off on infowars.com.
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:49.360]  No mentions of ISIS genocide by Christians during the presidential debate.
[02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:53.680]  General Boykin, how does transgender integration help military fight and win wars?
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:57.720]  I think we should have people dressed up in high red eye heels and, you know, training
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:34:59.920]  outfits running around driving the tanks.
[02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:00.920]  Why not?
[02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:01.920]  My confused the enemy.
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:05.640]  So, exactly how go ahead and do it, whatever, man.
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:06.640]  Totally normal.
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:08.440]  Anyways, not a way to shut down our military thing.
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:09.440]  It's not sabotage the country.
[02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:11.440]  You know, we have all the emails admitting sabotage.
[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:12.440]  No.
[02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:13.440]  They're sabotaging the culture.
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:15.600]  They admit screwing everybody over.
[02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:16.600]  It's okay, though.
[02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:17.600]  Creating race war.
[02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:18.600]  trendy.
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:22.400]  Poll that Hillary Clinton's 11 points ahead is run by Clinton, the ally, paid off by
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:23.400]  Super PAC.
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:24.400]  It's all admitted.
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:29.480]  I mean, again, CNN's put out two polls where they'll sample 40-something, just because
[02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:30.480]  they vary.
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:35.840]  Look it up, just CNN caught running another fake poll or rig poll.
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:37.880]  You can read their own methodology screenshots.
[02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:43.960]  They tell you, we sampled 40-something percent Democrats, 20-something Republicans, and then
[02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:47.000]  20-something percent independents, which are really Democrats.
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:50.440]  So it's really like 60-percent Democrats and 20-something percent Republicans.
[02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:51.840]  And then she only wins by 15 points.
[02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:54.840]  I mean, a three-year-old could figure this out.
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:55.840]  Josh?
[02:35:55.840 --> 02:35:56.840]  We found out.
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:35:57.840]  We found out.
[02:35:57.840 --> 02:36:03.360]  This is what happens when you've got 500 stories on your desk, Alex, literally.
[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:04.360]  But here's the thing.
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:08.360]  We found the most recent claimed poll that CNN is running, everybody's running with the
[02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:12.480]  Wall Street Journal, all these people saying Clinton is up by 11 points.
[02:36:12.480 --> 02:36:13.480]  You can find it.
[02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:14.480]  It's public information.
[02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:16.480]  We found who they polled.
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:21.080]  It's more than a quarter staunch Democrats, okay?
[02:36:21.080 --> 02:36:25.120]  And then they go down the list and then it's normal Democrats and then it's independents
[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:28.120]  and then it's strong Republicans and then, you know, kind of Republicans.
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:31.280]  And of course, by and large, it's not even close.
[02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:36.120]  The percentage, if you want to pull up the document camera, yeah, let's go to his phones.
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:37.120]  We can see this.
[02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:38.640]  You can pull up this document.
[02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:39.640]  That methodology is crooked.
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:42.880]  That when you're doing 40-something percent Democrats, 20-something percent Republicans,
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:44.800]  what the hell do you think is going to happen?
[02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:45.800]  Exactly.
[02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:46.800]  And like you said, she's still a win.
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:52.600]  If I have a scale and I put 40-something rocks of the same weight in it, is it going to be
[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:55.920]  heavier than the same size, each weight, 20-something?
[02:36:55.920 --> 02:36:58.560]  Which one's heavier, 40-something or 20-something?
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:03.520]  And she still barely wins, 11 points.
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:11.040]  This is like, I mean, I wonder, if you actually just pulled Democrats, I wonder what the results
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:12.040]  are.
[02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:13.040]  Absolutely.
[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:14.040]  Here's one.
[02:37:14.040 --> 02:37:15.040]  Politico busted with a rig poll against Trump.
[02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:17.040]  So we're cutting him in FullWars.com.
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:19.200]  And then it goes over how they did this as well.
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:25.080]  After a recent conduct by Politico, which sampled 2,001 registered voters, 42% thought
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:28.280]  Hillary Clinton was the winner of the debate compared to 28%.
[02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:32.840]  Although large sample size may make the poll seem seemingly accurate to some, the methodology
[02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:33.840]  tells a different story.
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:38.480]  According to the polls methodology, 37% of those samples are Democrats compared to 30%
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:40.080]  who consider themselves Republicans.
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:43.720]  The remaining 33% are independents, and that's where they really get you because they sample
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:44.720]  in the demographic.
[02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:47.480]  Just like CNN says, oh, you're a Democrat, you're a Republican.
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:48.480]  We'll call you back.
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:52.000]  Well, who's been given the number of 500 respondents to call back?
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:57.560]  And then CNN admits they pull, again, 40-something percent Democrats over 20-something percent
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:37:58.560]  Republicans.
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:37:59.560]  This is ridiculous.
[02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:02.120]  This is, I mean, what type of idiot would believe this?
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:08.360]  The oversampling of Democrats indicates a built-in 7%, so this is more fair by Politico.
[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:12.760]  They only put a 7% more in, which, I mean, that's like a football game.
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:16.480]  If you said, well, the Cowboys, we're going to lose by three points, but we gave them
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:17.480]  an extra seven.
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:18.560]  So it's okay they won.
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:20.200]  It's okay they just cheated by 7%, right?
[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:21.200]  Yeah, that's fine.
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:22.680]  We don't mind that.
[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:24.600]  We don't want a fair match.
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:26.600]  Why would we want a fair match?
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:27.600]  This is an American election.
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:31.160]  There's no rigged election going on here, according to Barack Obama, even the Department
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:32.680]  of Justice is going to investigate.
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:34.680]  Well, and then it goes into more, exactly.
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:38.080]  It goes into more of how they skew other stuff in the same poll.
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:40.840]  But just 7% is one way they do it, and then they do it other ways.
[02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:41.840]  Now, let me ask this question.
[02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:42.840]  Who's getting pulled, though?
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:44.360]  Who are these people being pulled?
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:45.360]  I've never been pulled.
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:46.520]  Have you been pulled?
[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:49.080]  Has anyone of the staff ever been pulled in one of these?
[02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:55.680]  I've had one phone call years ago, and as soon as I said I was a libertarian, the computer
[02:38:55.680 --> 02:38:56.680]  hung up.
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:38:57.680]  As soon as I punched that number.
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:38:58.680]  That's also how they skew it.
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:38:59.680]  They pre-program these, a lot of them.
[02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:02.560]  This has come out in the news, where if it isn't what you want, a certain percentage
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:07.000]  of Republicans or libertarians, they hang up on and claim, oh, it disconnected to resample
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:08.840]  till the computer gets the number it wants.
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:12.080]  So you put an algorithm in, then the computer will just call people until it gets what it
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:13.080]  wants.
[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:14.080]  Yeah, you're just getting the desired result.
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:16.880]  It'll call and call and call until it gets what it wants.
[02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:19.920]  And that's how hacking, that's how a hacking program works.
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:22.680]  They don't like go in after the election and do it.
[02:39:22.680 --> 02:39:24.760]  They put an algorithm in.
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:26.800]  What are we going to do when they steal this election?
[02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:28.920]  You know, we should have the next 27 days.
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:29.920]  I mean, seriously.
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:30.920]  I mean, just only talk about that.
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:31.920]  We should probably only talk about that.
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:32.920]  This is what I mean.
[02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:33.920]  This is what I'm going to do.
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:35.240]  People ask what the October surprise is.
[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:36.240]  It's the truth.
[02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:38.520]  They stole other elections.
[02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:40.840]  They're actively stealing this one.
[02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:42.560]  I told Trump, other people had it.
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:43.560]  He's smart.
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:44.560]  He went public.
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:45.560]  There's election fraud.
[02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:46.560]  They came out and said, no such thing exists.
[02:39:46.560 --> 02:39:48.440]  And they said, oh my God, it's so bad.
[02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:49.680]  We've got to federalize it.
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:51.000]  Homeland Security's in there right now.
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.960]  The Democrats are running around stealing the election.
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:54.960]  What do we do?
[02:39:54.960 --> 02:39:57.520]  I don't know if you've heard about this, but what do you think about?
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:03.760]  I call for all Donald Trump voters on November 8th to be decked out in red.
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:08.080]  And then if you go to the polling place, everyone's wearing red, not even close.
[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:09.320]  And then they claim it's Hillary.
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:10.760]  We will have caught them.
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:11.760]  It's a great idea.
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:13.680]  They're the liberals and loving, it's okay that they cheat.
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:17.880]  And we've kind of gotten on the point where we know they're cheating, do we start cheating?
[02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:18.880]  And that's fair.
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:19.880]  That's not cheating though.
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:21.640]  There's nothing illegal about that.
[02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:23.960]  I mean, I've gotten to the point where they'll call it cheating though.
[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:24.960]  They will.
[02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:26.200]  Well, I don't want to stoop to their level.
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:29.880]  I want to expose them for cheating and stop it.
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:36.920]  But if they get rid of the ballot box, then I guess they're going to force people into
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:37.920]  the cartridge box.
[02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:41.480]  And I don't want the cartridge box, but they actively want to come arrest us, put us in
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:43.360]  prison, shut us down.
[02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:48.680]  So at a certain point, I guess the candy asses want to dance.
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:54.960]  I mean, unless they wake up and realize what's going on, I don't know what else we can do.
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:55.960]  What am I supposed to do?
[02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:57.880]  Here's the thing, Alex.
[02:40:57.880 --> 02:40:59.080]  We're fighting for America.
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:00.480]  We're fighting for freedom.
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:03.800]  And we don't want these social justice warriors in our way.
[02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:05.080]  They're actually on our team.
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:07.960]  Unfortunately, they're scoring for the other team, but they're on our team.
[02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:08.960]  I don't want to have to run down.
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:10.120]  They're getting screwed over by the New World Order.
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:11.120]  They're getting screwed over.
[02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:12.120]  Absolutely.
[02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:13.120]  I don't want to run them over.
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:14.720]  I don't want to fight with you.
[02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:15.720]  You're in my way.
[02:41:15.720 --> 02:41:16.720]  Move, bitch.
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:17.720]  Get out the way.
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:18.720]  That's what it is.
[02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:19.720]  You see them headlights.
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:20.720]  But that's what it is.
[02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:21.720]  I mean, again, age groups, you're not my enemy.
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:22.720]  I'm like a curtain now.
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:23.720]  Carl Cook, you're not my enemy.
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:30.920]  All these people I talked to at the wash you outside that don't like Donald Trump.
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:31.920]  You're not my enemy.
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:32.920]  Okay.
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:36.160]  We need to be united in this election.
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:38.880]  And I'm telling you, I don't get it.
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:43.920]  No one agrees, media is corrupt, government's corrupt, yet where do they go for their answers
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:44.920]  in this election?
[02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:49.720]  The mainstream media and Hillary Clinton, who's been in the government for 30 years.
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:54.000]  Because the big mommy media told him so, so they're like three of them are like, um, you're
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  in trouble.
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:56.520]  I'm paddling.
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:00.320]  Even Megan Kelly debuted the Trump video, even Megan Kelly.
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:05.040]  Oh my goodness, even her did you read people magazine?
[02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:06.040]  I want to play some of us.
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:07.040]  But we got to go to calls.
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:09.320]  So, briefly, folks, this is lizard supported broadcast.

[02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:40.080]  We send them the highest quality info wars, life.com, info wars, store.com or 888-253-33139.
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:43.680]  We'll stop selling the Hillary for prison shirt that we coined a year and a half ago
[02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:45.800]  in T minus 27 days.
[02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:50.360]  All right, Sherry holding for a while from the great state of Texas, Sherry, you're on
[02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:51.360]  the year worldwide.
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:52.360]  Go ahead.
[02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:53.360]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:59.320]  Here's an example of how important WikiLeaks is to us, and it also helps further explain
[02:43:59.320 --> 02:44:00.320]  why the authorities moved.
[02:44:00.320 --> 02:44:01.320]  So it's so important.
[02:44:01.320 --> 02:44:02.320]  I want you to get off speakerphone.
[02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:03.320]  I know you've been holding a while.
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:04.320]  You're a sweetheart.
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:07.440]  I'm going to send you a free Hillary for prison shirt because you held so long in your name
[02:44:07.440 --> 02:44:08.440]  and address.
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:13.720]  Or you can have the new one that's the Gadsden flag, lock her up shirt, by the way, but ma'am,
[02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:15.720]  please get off speakerphone.
[02:44:15.720 --> 02:44:16.720]  Okay.
[02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:17.720]  Here I am.
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:18.720]  Good.
[02:44:18.720 --> 02:44:19.720]  You got me?
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:20.720]  Good.
[02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:21.720]  All right.
[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:22.720]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:23.720]  Good.
[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:24.720]  Good.
[02:44:24.720 --> 02:44:30.000]  Here's an example of how important WikiLeaks is to us, and it further explains what you
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:35.640]  were talking about the other day about why the authorities wanted to remove Gandhi statue
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:38.080]  from a churchyard.
[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:39.080]  Are you with me, Alex?
[02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:41.840]  Ma'am, I am absolutely with you.
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:43.080]  I just wanted you to get off speaker.
[02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:44.280]  Just to make sure.
[02:44:44.280 --> 02:44:45.520]  I am off the speaker.
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:47.080]  No, I know you are.
[02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:48.080]  I know.
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:49.080]  And then I said, so we can hear you clearly.
[02:44:49.080 --> 02:44:51.920]  I said, just jump off speaker and we hear you clear and you hear me clear.
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:52.920]  Not right.
[02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:53.920]  Okay.
[02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:54.920]  Yeah.
[02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:55.920]  I got you.
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:56.920]  I was my mistake.
[02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:57.920]  I'm sorry.
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:44:58.920]  I forgot I had it off.
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:44:59.920]  It's okay.
[02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:00.920]  Okay.
[02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:01.920]  Thanks.
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:06.040]  It also answers how we can fight back, at least in my opinion, the best way.
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:08.720]  Last month I decided to see a movie I had taped a long time ago.
[02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:16.600]  It's the night of the movie, Gandhi, the 1982 movie, Gandhi, with Ben Kingsley as the star.
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:19.200]  And I started taking notes immediately.
[02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:26.480]  He was a simple lawyer, as people know, and he became the leader of India and a symbol
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:28.080]  of peace and all this.
[02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:31.800]  At the time when the British administration had taken over the country, they were going
[02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:38.080]  through exactly what we are going through and will go through if things keep going.
[02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:39.080]  Sure.
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:43.320]  And well, look, I mean, whether you love Gandhi or don't, you're right that they want to take
[02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:47.240]  a statue down because, notice, one day it's a confederate general, now it's Gandhi.
[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:51.880]  Now at major colleges, they want Martin Luther King taken down because he said, all God's
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:53.600]  children of every color.
[02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:54.600]  Take him to the major.
[02:45:54.600 --> 02:45:57.640]  Well, let the United States transgender or gay, how the hell are you supposed to?
[02:45:57.640 --> 02:45:59.360]  They want the power to control language.
[02:45:59.360 --> 02:46:00.520]  It's not liberal.
[02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:01.840]  It's scientifically directed.
[02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:02.840]  Go ahead.
[02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:07.520]  Gandhi had some things to say to the British administration, and I made a point of three
[02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:08.520]  things.
[02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:12.040]  He said the people cannot tolerate injustice from Hitler or anyone.
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:13.040]  That's a quote.
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:16.920]  And to combat injustice, make the injustice visible.
[02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:18.760]  That's pretty common to a lot of people.
[02:46:18.760 --> 02:46:19.860]  But he went on.
[02:46:19.860 --> 02:46:24.680]  He was also questioned about the poor and about combating poverty.
[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:31.080]  And he said, quote, poverty can be removed if his people's skills can be revived.
[02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:36.880]  In other words, no direct Wall Street connection, no, of course, he knew that a lot of stuff
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:37.880]  he said was good.
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:43.280]  And he, by the way, because Hitler was into Eastern mysticism and into Buddhism and things.
[02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:47.320]  I know Gandhi was a Hindi, but the point is they were pen pals because Hitler was like
[02:46:47.320 --> 02:46:51.880]  Mr. America, good guy at our news and you, Genesis, Gandhi started talking to Hitler
[02:46:51.880 --> 02:46:52.880]  a lot in letters.
[02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:56.200]  And there's famous letters, he wrote them at the end saying, I can't support you.
[02:46:56.200 --> 02:46:58.880]  You're really being bad doing this and you're going to get destroyed.
[02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:00.000]  Germany will fall.
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:01.000]  You're crazy.
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:02.000]  Gandhi was really smart.
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:06.000]  Some of the stuff he was into was a little weird, but hey, whatever, he was a visionary,
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:07.000]  a trailblazer.
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:08.000]  I agree with you.
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:13.440]  Gandhi University, them pulling down his statue is again about every symbol hurts somebody's
[02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:14.440]  feelings.
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:15.440]  Let's get rid of it.
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:16.440]  I appreciate your call, Sherry.
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:19.720]  And now they've got control over the internet and the UN level.
[02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:24.720]  So what are you going to do when they try to block you or say that you're starting and
[02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:27.240]  as soon as Hillary gets in, I'm sure the UN will answer.
[02:47:27.240 --> 02:47:30.000]  I'm sure if you try to reach out to the UN, they'll get right back to you with that.
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:31.480]  There'll be no problems there.
[02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:33.360]  That's amazing.
[02:47:33.360 --> 02:47:35.320]  Let's go ahead and go to a mat in Maryland.
[02:47:35.320 --> 02:47:36.520]  Thanks for holding her a trooper.
[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:41.080]  I'm going to send you a free Hillary for prison or the limited edition.
[02:47:41.080 --> 02:47:42.080]  Lock her up.
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:47.760]  Gadsden flags, snake, actually suppressing Hillary's unheard and it's lovingly coiled
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:48.760]  up around her.
[02:47:48.760 --> 02:47:51.120]  And if I was liberal, I'd say the snake's not hurting her in the photo.
[02:47:51.120 --> 02:47:53.000]  It's lovingly giving her a warm.
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000]  That's what bow constrictors do.
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:48:00.320]  Giant rattlesnake bow constrictors that are just as real as Obamacare being free.
[02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:01.320]  That's Sherry.
[02:48:01.320 --> 02:48:03.320]  So we're going to send you that for holding for an hour and a half.
[02:48:03.320 --> 02:48:04.320]  Go ahead.
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:05.320]  Well, thanks.
[02:48:05.320 --> 02:48:10.000]  Well, I was online yesterday and I've seen this video going around.
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:15.760]  It's of a local New York news station, WPIX 11.
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:22.040]  It's got three news anchors on there and they're goofing around with one of those
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:29.720]  old turn camera, digital cameras that you snap, I mean, disposable ones.
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:35.160]  Disposable ones and they were snapping pictures of each other with the flash coming across.
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:40.400]  And then one anchor said, yeah, these are banned from all, we're taking a service that
[02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:48.240]  we're not allowed to use these because of bringing on Hillary Clinton's seizure.
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:49.680]  And I mean, he was probably being tongue-in-cheek.
[02:48:49.680 --> 02:48:51.280]  They have told, don't have flash around her.
[02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:52.280]  That is going on.
[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:53.280]  She does have seizures.
[02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:58.400]  But were they just pointing that out to their audience or that it actually happened to them?
[02:48:58.400 --> 02:48:59.400]  One error.
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:01.880]  I actually had the video I'll record and put on YouTube.
[02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:02.880]  Wow.
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:03.880]  Great.
[02:49:03.880 --> 02:49:05.680]  What's the name of the YouTube channel or the name of the video?
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:07.400]  We'll pull it up.
[02:49:07.400 --> 02:49:12.400]  Well, the name of the video is Secret Service Bans Cameras with Flash.
[02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:14.200]  And it's the second video.
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:15.200]  Well, that's big.
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:16.200]  We need to get that.
[02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:17.200]  That's certainly newsworthy.
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:18.200]  That's why it's so important you called in.
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:20.920]  I haven't gotten to this yet and I should have.
[02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:25.120]  We actually have a clip of Hillary and the N-word.
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:31.400]  Hillary described using the N-word, W-B-E-N, 9.30 a.m., Buffalo, New York.
[02:49:31.400 --> 02:49:37.240]  And this is the chef, Tracy Martin, on the show.
[02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:38.520]  He's talking about during Clinton's first term.
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:40.440]  He describes her using the N-word in an interview.
[02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:42.720]  We're going to play that coming up.
[02:49:42.720 --> 02:49:47.080]  But listen, it's well known Hillary uses that term.
[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:51.520]  I've talked to folks that were basically her handler.
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:53.880]  She's very racist.
[02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:56.200]  And again, it's all about betrayal.
[02:49:56.200 --> 02:50:02.840]  I mean, if I'm going to use the N-word, which I never have, I'll use it to your face.
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:08.680]  It's just Democrats are like the plantation managers, folks, over everybody.
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:10.080]  They see us all as their slaves.
[02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:15.080]  Well, the boa constrictor keeps you warm and the Democrats want to rebuild the inner cities.
[02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:16.080]  That's obvious.
[02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:19.680]  But I know these info warriors, they're so active out there, they're going to make you
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:23.440]  go broke with all these Bill Clinton rape shirts getting on the mainstream news.
[02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:25.920]  But I think we might have another challenge now, Alex.
[02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:29.880]  How about we get info warriors to go to Hillary Clinton rallies?
[02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:33.440]  She's got four coming up before the next debate and start taking pictures.
[02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:34.440]  Get the flash out.
[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:35.440]  Take a picture.
[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:36.440]  I don't want you to induce a seizure.
[02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:37.440]  I'm not saying that we want Hillary to.
[02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:39.400]  The bigger service might arrest you for assault.
[02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:43.400]  Expose how she's sick and that you can't even have a flash at a rally because she's
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:44.400]  so sick.
[02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:47.080]  But you consciously, but they can say, no, she does have epilepsy from the brain tumor.
[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:48.840]  You're consciously trying to make her have a seizure.
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:49.840]  That is a form of assault.
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:50.840]  But I get your point.
[02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:51.840]  They say she doesn't have it.
[02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:52.840]  So it's not a problem.
[02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:53.840]  So we'll expose it.
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:56.840]  Everybody should try to get into rallies with it and get them recorded with audio saying
[02:50:56.840 --> 02:50:58.640]  you can't have a flash camera.
[02:50:58.640 --> 02:51:00.720]  Thank you so much, Matt, great point.
[02:51:00.720 --> 02:51:04.880]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better
[02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:08.440]  than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood
[02:51:08.440 --> 02:51:11.560]  sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:15.160]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives and you could be one of
[02:51:15.160 --> 02:51:16.160]  them.
[02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:17.760]  It's called heart and body extract.
[02:51:17.760 --> 02:51:22.000]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of heart and body extract, talks about the positive effects
[02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:23.480]  of heart and body extract.
[02:51:23.480 --> 02:51:27.720]  What happens with the formula heart and body extract is it's giving the body the necessary
[02:51:27.720 --> 02:51:32.640]  vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients, so the body will heal
[02:51:32.640 --> 02:51:33.640]  itself.
[02:51:33.640 --> 02:51:38.000]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol,
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:39.440]  clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:45.280]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics, so the body is an amazing thing.
[02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:48.520]  It simply needs some help, so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:51:48.520 --> 02:51:50.880]  Heart and body extract gets results.

[02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:00.440]  Think about this.
[02:53:00.440 --> 02:53:04.520]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated
[02:53:04.520 --> 02:53:09.720]  with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines,
[02:53:09.720 --> 02:53:12.520]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[02:53:12.520 --> 02:53:17.520]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:21.040]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey water filter.
[02:53:21.040 --> 02:53:26.880]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show Big Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals,

[02:54:20.840 --> 02:54:25.400]  It's the top story on infowars.com, it's the top story on prisonplanet.com, we've been
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:29.720]  discussing it here live and in all the other insanity going on with the head of New York
[02:54:29.720 --> 02:54:34.640]  elections saying, oh, the party, people, the Democrats, who's a Democrat, bust people around
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:37.240]  to vote over and over again, but we're not going to stop it, you know, I don't like it,
[02:54:37.240 --> 02:54:40.920]  but it's just the way it is, and yeah, you know, there's stuff in the ballots, you know,
[02:54:40.920 --> 02:54:44.920]  right now in Florida for Hillary to win, but you know, that's being reported in Florida.
[02:54:44.920 --> 02:54:49.720]  Meanwhile, Banished, the untold story of Danny Williams' search for his father.
[02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:53.040]  He tries to reconnect with his reported father, Bill Clinton.
[02:54:53.040 --> 02:54:56.160]  That's the headline I gave at KIT Post, he did a great job, but we probably should just
[02:54:56.160 --> 02:55:02.280]  go with Drudge, he's so good at, you know, headlines and really condensing all of this
[02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:10.480]  down to what it really is, it's, Bill Clinton's son speaks out, so we'll probably just retweet
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:19.040]  that Facebook that with Bill Clinton's son in quotes, speaks out, asked for a DNA test,
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:22.080]  even a more powerful headline, because that's what's going on.
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:27.360]  We're taking phone calls, we've got Owen Schroyer here, one of our co-hosts with us.
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:30.960]  We're going to ride a little bit the next hour with David Knight, play a boil down of
[02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:36.000]  some of the craziness that he saw at the debate in St. Louis, and continue with your calls,
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:39.240]  and we've got some patriots coming in today as well, and we've got the night news coming
[02:55:39.240 --> 02:55:41.760]  up tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:46.920]  Other big surprises tomorrow, you'll want to tune in.
[02:55:46.920 --> 02:55:51.800]  We support the broadcast, as I mentioned earlier, DNA force, 23% off at sell ins tonight, a

[02:55:55.480 --> 02:56:00.400]  order, $50 or more, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, the whole world goes around because you're
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:02.600]  supporting us, you are the info war, I salute you.
[02:56:02.600 --> 02:56:04.840]  Anything you want to add before we go to Luke in Florida?
[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:09.240]  Again, I think we should all wear red on November 8th to make sure they don't steal the election
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:15.040]  from us, and the rally, Trump rally in Wilkes, Pennsylvania last night almost had me in tears,
[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:16.040]  it was so powerful.
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:19.080]  Well, we need to post that whole rally, and maybe have you do the highlights of it or
[02:56:19.080 --> 02:56:20.840]  something for the news, you know, get some clips.
[02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:27.000]  The whole thing, man, I mean, it's just, if Donald Trump is for real folks, he is the
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:32.320]  greatest American hero in hundreds of years.
[02:56:32.320 --> 02:56:33.320]  And he's gone through living hell.
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:34.320]  He's the man in the arena.
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:39.280]  He is going through public torture right now for this country in every debate and every
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:40.520]  day in the mainstream news.
[02:56:40.520 --> 02:56:42.040]  Let's go back to these great callers, Alex.
[02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:45.400]  I was telling him, tip the camera down, I'm not telling you to stop, I just-
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:46.400]  No, no, I know.
[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:50.320]  I have this headroom obsession being too much headroom, I'm here directing the show while
[02:56:50.320 --> 02:56:51.320]  we're doing things.
[02:56:51.320 --> 02:56:52.320]  Hold on.
[02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:53.320]  Hold on, the Russians are giving orders.
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:54.320]  There's a lot of me here.
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:55.320]  Okay.
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:56.320]  What's that?
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:56:57.320]  The Jews are in my ear.
[02:56:57.320 --> 02:56:58.320]  Hold on, you've got too many news facts on your desk.
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:56:59.320]  I don't know the facts in my head.
[02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:00.320]  Hey, they did it.
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:03.400]  As if anyone could direct the circus.
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:06.880]  You didn't even know the reports that we were working on in St. Louis, I tell you, give
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:07.880]  me complete freedom.
[02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:08.880]  Well, how can I?
[02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:09.880]  I'm busy with the October surprises.
[02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:10.880]  I don't know, Alex.
[02:57:10.880 --> 02:57:13.880]  You've only got, let's see, 5,000 news stories on your desk.
[02:57:13.880 --> 02:57:15.720]  I've got about 110 of them today.
[02:57:15.720 --> 02:57:18.680]  There's like 300, I didn't get to, I mean, it's just, you know.
[02:57:18.680 --> 02:57:23.800]  Well, you've got like every WikiLeak, we have the total proof she lied again to Congress
[02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:26.840]  and was being paid by foreign governments, but she won't get locked up because the damn
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:29.480]  criminal put all her people in.
[02:57:29.480 --> 02:57:34.800]  I don't know who could do this, but if somebody can get a piece of Bill Clinton's hair or
[02:57:34.800 --> 02:57:39.960]  dead skin or something, we can run the DNA test independently with Danny Williams, prove
[02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:40.960]  that Bill Clinton-
[02:57:40.960 --> 02:57:44.080]  No, I'm the Providence in the evidence chain, wasn't I?
[02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:49.880]  Imagine this, Alex, Web Hubbell gets a DNA test with Hillary, or with Chelsea, and Danny
[02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:52.280]  Williams gets a DNA test with Danny Williams.
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:57.240]  By the way, reportedly, for whatever reason, the Israelis wanted a blackmail bush or something,
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:57:59.560]  and others, whenever he would go to foreign countries, they were having people get in
[02:57:59.560 --> 02:58:02.960]  the sewer, and then we're guessing, Tom, he went to the bathroom and then opened the
[02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:04.040]  surpipes to get the-
[02:58:04.040 --> 02:58:05.040]  I'm not suggesting anybody-
[02:58:05.040 --> 02:58:06.040]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:58:06.040 --> 02:58:07.040]  And Bush-
[02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:11.000]  You might want to look at- Pardon me?
[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:12.800]  I said Monica has a dress that-
[02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:13.800]  Oh, Monica has a dress.
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:14.800]  Oh, Monica's dress.
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:20.440]  Exactly, but expanding on that, Bush started having a portable toilet taken with him.
[02:58:20.440 --> 02:58:21.760]  He had to bring a toilet along with him?
[02:58:21.760 --> 02:58:22.760]  No, I'm not kidding.
[02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:23.760]  You can do it.
[02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:26.320]  I'm surprised he's not just crapping in a bag or something.
[02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:27.320]  Throwing it at each other.
[02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:28.320]  More flies.
[02:58:28.320 --> 02:58:29.320]  Oh, that's Bohemian Grove.
[02:58:29.320 --> 02:58:30.320]  That's Bohemian Grove.
[02:58:30.320 --> 02:58:31.320]  No, that's Scullin' Bones.
[02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:33.680]  Like, pee on each other at Bohemian Grove.
[02:58:33.680 --> 02:58:35.720]  Scullin' Bones is like wallow in the feces.
[02:58:35.720 --> 02:58:39.120]  I'm sorry, folks, it's a child, you know, children's show or whatever, but family show,

[03:00:24.200 --> 03:00:25.320]  Alright, I got a bunch of clips.
[03:00:25.320 --> 03:00:27.800]  I played a little junk piece with Hillary ribbiting now.
[03:00:27.800 --> 03:00:28.800]  She does ribbits.
[03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:32.200]  And then all her other stuff mixed in.
[03:00:32.200 --> 03:00:33.200]  That's coming up.

[03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:42.080]  through the milleniality news tonight as well.
[03:00:42.080 --> 03:00:47.080]  Danny Williams' information, the reportedly illegitimate son of Bill Clinton.
[03:00:47.080 --> 03:00:50.000]  That exclusive, his message to his father.
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:51.000]  Very powerful.
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:52.000]  It's on infowars.com.
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:53.680]  It's a top story on dredgerport.com.
[03:00:53.680 --> 03:00:55.160]  Please get that out.
[03:00:55.160 --> 03:01:00.680]  And you will want to tune in tomorrow live during the show for more October surprises.
[03:01:00.680 --> 03:01:03.480]  Let's go ahead and go to look in the floor to look.
[03:01:03.480 --> 03:01:04.480]  Thanks for holding.
[03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:05.480]  Hello.
[03:01:05.480 --> 03:01:06.480]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:06.480 --> 03:01:13.480]  Hey, I just wanted to bring up observation from the debate.
[03:01:13.480 --> 03:01:20.880]  I was curious, why do you think Hillary Clinton had a second microphone or what looked like
[03:01:20.880 --> 03:01:28.760]  a microphone on her jacket when her and Trump both had handheld microphones?
[03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:29.760]  Trump had a lob too.
[03:01:29.760 --> 03:01:31.760]  That's just backup so they don't have problems.
[03:01:31.760 --> 03:01:32.760]  All right.
[03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:33.760]  I was just wondering.
[03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:37.920]  But it's admitted that she's got to have somebody in her ear during speeches telling
[03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:38.920]  her what to do.
[03:01:38.920 --> 03:01:39.920]  That's in the new WikiLeaks.
[03:01:39.920 --> 03:01:45.200]  Because I also noticed that she had a nice comb over her ear with her hair.
[03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:46.200]  I noticed that too.
[03:01:46.200 --> 03:01:47.200]  Well, it looks like she had an earpiece before.
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:50.320]  Hell, she's got a secret service agent buyer when somebody says something.
[03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:51.320]  It's okay.
[03:01:51.320 --> 03:01:52.320]  Keep going.
[03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:53.320]  It's all right.
[03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:54.320]  It's all right.
[03:01:54.320 --> 03:01:57.120]  I mean, she's definitely losing some of her mental capacities when she has these strokes,
[03:01:57.120 --> 03:01:58.120]  when she has these convulsions.
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:01.480]  She's out of it for a few days, then she gets better.
[03:02:01.480 --> 03:02:02.480]  Yeah.
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:13.640]  The other thing was, I'm down here in the skin tag of the United States, Florida, and
[03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:18.040]  I was wondering, I want to put up some banners.
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:22.760]  What do you think is a good thing to put on banners that's short and sweet and that might
[03:02:22.760 --> 03:02:27.160]  encourage people to look into something?
[03:02:27.160 --> 03:02:28.160]  Bill Clinton.
[03:02:28.160 --> 03:02:30.040]  Hillary Clinton are criminals.
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:34.200]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:02:34.200 --> 03:02:37.080]  Websites and FullWars.com, what do you think?
[03:02:37.080 --> 03:02:42.400]  You could use their own kind of brainwashing movements against them, and you could put
[03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:47.360]  up like a picture of Danny Williams and say, Black Lives Matter, look at Danny Williams.
[03:02:47.360 --> 03:02:48.920]  Look at the crimes against Danny Williams.
[03:02:48.920 --> 03:02:49.920]  Black Lives Matter.
[03:02:49.920 --> 03:02:54.040]  Exactly, hashtag Black Lives Matter, Danny Williams, and everybody comes and sees our
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:57.600]  story and our video and him trying to get back with his father.
[03:02:57.600 --> 03:03:04.120]  Yeah, because I was just trying to think of something that would, you know, get people
[03:03:04.120 --> 03:03:09.040]  to at least, you know, if somebody spends 15 minutes, you know, just looking into stuff
[03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:13.120]  with, you know, outside their echo chamber, you know, they're going to wake up.
[03:03:13.120 --> 03:03:19.560]  You just have to get those people, you know, to spend just 15, 20 minutes looking into
[03:03:19.560 --> 03:03:24.480]  something real instead of listening to the same propaganda from their friends on Twitter.
[03:03:24.480 --> 03:03:29.680]  Well, that's it, they try to segregate libertarian conservatives, people ethnically, you name
[03:03:29.680 --> 03:03:33.200]  it, liberal, whatever, into little groups where you get fed your own echo chamber.
[03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:37.200]  We need to do raids into the brainwashed areas.
[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:38.200]  Really great points, Luke.
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:39.200]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:39.200 --> 03:03:43.920]  We're going to go to Bright, come back and play a few other clips, recap some things,
[03:03:43.920 --> 03:03:44.920]  and then move forward.
[03:03:44.920 --> 03:03:50.000]  But I have to tell you, I want to assure you, I agree with you.
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:55.800]  We have to focus front and center on election fraud, on the fact that it's happening.
[03:03:55.800 --> 03:04:00.240]  But to say, listen, don't give up because the fraud's happening, the landslide is what
[03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:01.440]  opposes it.
[03:04:01.440 --> 03:04:06.600]  But the establishment is so evil that they're trying to block Trump and his populist movement.
[03:04:06.600 --> 03:04:07.760]  That's why you should be for Trump.
[03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:13.560]  The foreign, communist, Chinese, the Pope, the evil Saudi Arabians, every criminal group
[03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:17.920]  is against him because they know his MO, he's his own person, he's a nationalist, and whether
[03:04:17.920 --> 03:04:22.080]  he's perfect or not, they've already hijacked the country.
[03:04:22.080 --> 03:04:25.080]  With this two-party dictatorship and the whole systems against him, we haven't supported
[03:04:25.080 --> 03:04:26.080]  him.
[03:04:26.080 --> 03:04:28.640]  So we've got 26 days basically, 27 is long on the tooth.
[03:04:28.640 --> 03:04:32.520]  We've got to decide how are we going to fight this, what are we going to do, how are we
[03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:37.040]  going to counter it, because we've got election, the head of elections New York saying it's
[03:04:37.040 --> 03:04:38.120]  total fraud.
[03:04:38.120 --> 03:04:42.720]  This is our country, and this is our right to vote for our next leader.
[03:04:42.720 --> 03:04:47.400]  I'm not going to let the fake lying media and the fake politicians steal this one from
[03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:48.400]  me.
[03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:50.920]  But you're laughing white males, we have to vote five times against you.
[03:04:50.920 --> 03:04:55.040]  I'll be a transvestite, will you count my vote then?
[03:04:55.040 --> 03:04:56.040]  Maybe.
[03:04:56.040 --> 03:04:57.040]  Maybe that's what we do.
[03:04:57.040 --> 03:04:59.040]  We all change genders, then they'll count our vote.
[03:04:59.040 --> 03:05:03.280]  Hey, it's another story by the Lord of the Flies, Hillary Clinton.
[03:05:03.280 --> 03:05:07.600]  Hillary worried about Jihadist entering with refugees in private speech.
[03:05:07.600 --> 03:05:10.080]  I'm not loving it.
[03:05:10.080 --> 03:05:14.600]  We can occult you that in a private 2000 speech, Hillary Clinton worried about the risk of
[03:05:14.600 --> 03:05:18.960]  Jihadist entering Jordan with legitimate refugees because they can't possibly vet all those
[03:05:18.960 --> 03:05:19.960]  refugees.
[03:05:19.960 --> 03:05:24.960]  Yeah, we know you can't vet them all, and yet you want to allow 55,000 Syrians to come
[03:05:24.960 --> 03:05:25.960]  in annually, un-evented.
[03:05:25.960 --> 03:05:31.760]  But you're going to go to this private luncheon and tell them that it's probably a bad idea
[03:05:31.760 --> 03:05:36.560]  to take in refugees because of the fact there could be some extremists to get in there and
[03:05:36.560 --> 03:05:40.120]  then come over here to America and possibly chop off our heads.
[03:05:40.120 --> 03:05:42.880]  We've been saying that since day one, we need to secure the border.
[03:05:42.880 --> 03:05:46.360]  We need someone like Donald Trump to come in here and make America great again because
[03:05:46.360 --> 03:05:50.080]  the Clintons have done nothing but fail their entire political career, and I'm sick and
[03:05:50.080 --> 03:05:51.080]  tired of it.
[03:05:51.080 --> 03:05:55.280]  So November 8th, get your butt to the polls, go out there, vote, make America great again,
[03:05:55.280 --> 03:05:56.280]  let's secure those boards.
[03:05:56.280 --> 03:05:59.680]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[03:05:59.680 --> 03:06:03.000]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:08.520]  Keep Clintons by InfowarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocoloidal zeolites and

[03:07:59.160 --> 03:08:12.120]  It's Tuesday, October 11th, 2016.
[03:08:12.120 --> 03:08:20.240]  We are now only 27 short days out on the most important election in modern history, an election
[03:08:20.240 --> 03:08:26.840]  that may decide the fate not just of our republic, but the world.
[03:08:26.840 --> 03:08:33.040]  Before listening to the Alex Jones Show, I'm your host, Alex Jones, on Shroyer's Right
[03:08:33.040 --> 03:08:34.040]  to Shotgun with me.
[03:08:34.040 --> 03:08:35.920]  We've got about 10, 15 minutes.
[03:08:35.920 --> 03:08:40.440]  We've got Rob Doe coming in from the other studio, a whole bunch of breaking news and
[03:08:40.440 --> 03:08:41.440]  information.
[03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:44.120]  Speaking of breaking news and information, there are thousands of emails being gone
[03:08:44.120 --> 03:08:50.360]  through with the third data dump of the week by WikiLeaks, and it's now paid her.
[03:08:50.360 --> 03:08:58.560]  It's Hillary getting money from foreign governments, pay-per-play, espionage, knowing stuff's classified,
[03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:03.360]  Chelsea freaking out saying, they want us to settle a $9 billion lawsuit, they just paid
[03:09:03.360 --> 03:09:07.840]  us money, and they're ordering me around, we're gonna get in trouble, this is illegal.
[03:09:07.840 --> 03:09:12.360]  It's all there.
[03:09:12.360 --> 03:09:18.160]  To quote Tulsa Doom, the old round and lakes of blood, instead the old round and lakes
[03:09:18.160 --> 03:09:19.640]  of WikiLeaks.
[03:09:19.640 --> 03:09:25.200]  Hillary Clinton bragged about being invited to Putin's inner sanctum, Breitbart.com, going
[03:09:25.200 --> 03:09:26.680]  up on Infowars.com.
[03:09:26.680 --> 03:09:33.680]  The big clearinghouse for all of this is Rudgerport.com right now, shortly after being revealed,
[03:09:33.680 --> 03:09:38.000]  or relieved of her duties as Secretary of State, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary
[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:43.040]  Clinton reportedly gave a series of speeches in which she described Russian President Vladimir
[03:09:43.040 --> 03:09:50.800]  Putin as a very interesting conversationalist, who she said had gotten to know, including
[03:09:50.800 --> 03:09:58.240]  a visit to her, or his private inner sanctum, to discuss wildlife conservation.
[03:09:58.240 --> 03:09:59.760]  So let's go over this.
[03:09:59.760 --> 03:10:05.720]  Right before she was on to Secretary of State, the presidential nominee Hillary Clinton reportedly
[03:10:05.720 --> 03:10:10.120]  gave a series of speeches in which she described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a very
[03:10:10.120 --> 03:10:16.360]  interesting conversationalist, who she had gotten to know, including a visit, and she
[03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:24.280]  vomited green balls on him, to his private inner sanctum, to just, I don't think Putin
[03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:27.640]  wants to be around her private sanctum, or I don't think there'll be any grabbing from
[03:10:27.640 --> 03:10:28.640]  Trump.
[03:10:28.640 --> 03:10:36.560]  To discuss wildlife conservation, Clinton, who, you know, you got Santa, you got Crumpus,
[03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:39.280]  the bad Santa, and you got Trumpus, it's a super good Santa.
[03:10:39.280 --> 03:10:40.280]  Is this the good Santa?
[03:10:40.280 --> 03:10:41.280]  Trumpus, dude.
[03:10:41.280 --> 03:10:45.640]  If Trumpus comes, he's really good stuff, like your tass is cut in half.
[03:10:45.640 --> 03:10:47.720]  I'd love to be visited by Trumpus.
[03:10:47.720 --> 03:10:49.160]  Trumpus is checking Hillary's list twice.
[03:10:49.160 --> 03:10:50.160]  Have you been a good patriot?
[03:10:50.160 --> 03:10:51.800]  You've checked in the WikiLeaks twice.
[03:10:51.800 --> 03:10:53.640]  I'm gonna lock your ass up, lady.
[03:10:53.640 --> 03:10:56.320]  We're like, it's fascism, not if she's a criminal.
[03:10:56.320 --> 03:10:57.800]  Oh, here's Hillary.
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:11:00.000]  Putin's bad, Putin's bad, Putin's bad.
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:03.000]  Hillary's emails, I was in with Putin, I'm good.
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:07.840]  Meanwhile, she got 35 mil, and her cheat was staffed to give him one-fifth our uranium.
[03:11:07.840 --> 03:11:12.440]  And the Russians are trying to advance their aims, they're not, they're certainly involved
[03:11:12.440 --> 03:11:13.440]  in stuff.
[03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:14.440]  The thing is, it's with her.
[03:11:14.440 --> 03:11:18.120]  That's what I mean, our husbands are raping people, settling cases, they're accusing Trump
[03:11:18.120 --> 03:11:19.120]  of it.
[03:11:19.120 --> 03:11:23.920]  It's like everything they say, like, Trump has evil magics, the New Democrat Party statement.
[03:11:23.920 --> 03:11:25.560]  No, you are evil.
[03:11:25.560 --> 03:11:30.160]  How about this, outside of the realm of truth, let's just look at these stories for what
[03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:32.240]  they are in existence.
[03:11:32.240 --> 03:11:35.240]  They don't cover the bad Hillary stories.
[03:11:35.240 --> 03:11:36.240]  Never.
[03:11:36.240 --> 03:11:39.800]  You know, many times worse, people are like, but Alex, Trump's really talking about, you
[03:11:39.800 --> 03:11:43.280]  know, women are jumping on me, you can just grab them, they love it, yeah.
[03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:47.600]  Yeah, when a woman's jumping on you, that's the whole point.
[03:11:47.600 --> 03:11:50.840]  As Tiger Woods about that, he's had a little, it's not sexual assault if they're throwing
[03:11:50.840 --> 03:11:52.200]  themselves at you.
[03:11:52.200 --> 03:11:56.520]  And again, look, woman's cheeks turn red, they grab you, that means get to work.
[03:11:56.520 --> 03:11:57.520]  I don't have to defend you.
[03:11:57.520 --> 03:12:01.880]  I mean, you know, if you're a mammal, you know, God made us this way, I'm not, they've
[03:12:01.880 --> 03:12:04.480]  got all the fake Christians thinking sex is the only bad thing out there.
[03:12:04.480 --> 03:12:05.480]  And you know what?
[03:12:05.480 --> 03:12:07.520]  I'm gonna stand up for some unborn babies, I'd be happy.
[03:12:07.520 --> 03:12:10.440]  Here's something that I just realized having this conversation with you.
[03:12:10.440 --> 03:12:14.000]  Fake Christians, once you get the abortion ban, you can start talking about sex being
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:15.000]  evil all day.
[03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:16.000]  And I get it.
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:17.000]  Sex is important.
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:20.520]  You need to stay with your family and kids and it's all good, but that's all you harp
[03:12:20.520 --> 03:12:24.120]  on because you know everybody's having sex, you want to make us all feel guilty like a
[03:12:24.120 --> 03:12:25.120]  bunch of Pharisees.
[03:12:25.120 --> 03:12:28.600]  Where's Christ when you need him with a bullip to beat you upside the head?
[03:12:28.600 --> 03:12:32.520]  They tell us these stories that we evolved from primates that were, you know, primal
[03:12:32.520 --> 03:12:37.120]  animals essentially, but then they want us to reject all of our primal animal instincts
[03:12:37.120 --> 03:12:39.120]  and demonize us for having them.
[03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:40.280]  You can't have it both ways.
[03:12:40.280 --> 03:12:44.640]  No, in the words of up and smoke, when they get the pizza at the end and you know, generals
[03:12:44.640 --> 03:12:50.000]  to Dinkus or Lieutenant Stinkus goes, go with it, ah, the pizza, can we get that video
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:51.000]  please?
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:55.200]  The end of up and smoke when they eat the pizza and we just go, uh-oh, Alex, I've been told
[03:12:55.200 --> 03:12:57.400]  I got to try to keep you on the rails here in the fourth hour.
[03:12:57.400 --> 03:13:00.360]  All right, you're thinking about up and smoke now, all right, but this isn't the Hillary
[03:13:00.360 --> 03:13:02.240]  campaign up in smoke.
[03:13:02.240 --> 03:13:03.240]  That's what it should do.
[03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:07.520]  I don't smoke marijuana, but I like Stacey Keach and that's a funny part of the movie.
[03:13:07.520 --> 03:13:08.520]  Didn't, uh-
[03:13:08.520 --> 03:13:11.400]  There's the vans on fire and all the pots getting the cops high.
[03:13:11.400 --> 03:13:13.680]  You know, the whole pizza and the cops go crazy.
[03:13:13.680 --> 03:13:17.120]  Is that the one when they're in the back of the van and it keeps moving up and down and
[03:13:17.120 --> 03:13:18.400]  everyone's like, what is going on?
[03:13:18.400 --> 03:13:19.680]  And then the woman walks out.
[03:13:19.680 --> 03:13:22.120]  That's probably what Trump's tour van looks like.
[03:13:22.120 --> 03:13:28.640]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, here it is.
[03:13:28.640 --> 03:13:29.640]  Hey.
[03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:33.600]  Jihadi's killing 200,000 Christians and cutting women's generals off and selling five-year-olds
[03:13:33.600 --> 03:13:37.920]  into sex slavery and 100 Jihadi's raping a six-year-old till she dies.
[03:13:37.920 --> 03:13:38.920]  That's not an issue.
[03:13:38.920 --> 03:13:42.120]  Us making jokes, that is, so stop it right now.
[03:13:42.120 --> 03:13:46.240]  And you know, Donald Trump talking with his, uh, whether Billy Bush is his friend or not,
[03:13:46.240 --> 03:13:48.520]  I don't know, but having a locker room coverage.
[03:13:48.520 --> 03:13:49.520]  Did you see the new one?
[03:13:49.520 --> 03:13:52.040]  Oh, I've talked to athletes.
[03:13:52.040 --> 03:13:53.360]  That's not how they talk in the locker room.
[03:13:53.360 --> 03:13:55.280]  Actually, I've worked in professional media.
[03:13:55.280 --> 03:13:59.600]  I can personally tell you that, yes, athletes do talk like that in the locker room.
[03:13:59.600 --> 03:14:01.960]  What goes on in the football locker room?
[03:14:01.960 --> 03:14:02.960]  You don't want to know.
[03:14:02.960 --> 03:14:07.840]  I mean, there's so much cussing and sex talk and all this stuff that it's a crescendo of
[03:14:07.840 --> 03:14:11.200]  noise and all you want to do is get in the showers and get the hell out of there.
[03:14:11.200 --> 03:14:12.200]  It's true.
[03:14:12.200 --> 03:14:13.200]  Hey, guys.
[03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:14.200]  Especially as a media member.
[03:14:14.200 --> 03:14:17.000]  One of the things that I thought was really interesting about it is that, you know, the
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:25.800]  left has been like the champion of open sexuality and, you know, liberal views towards sexuality.
[03:14:25.800 --> 03:14:29.040]  And then now they're the ones coming back and saying, oh, no.
[03:14:29.040 --> 03:14:32.480]  Did you hear what Donald Trump said about women?
[03:14:32.480 --> 03:14:37.040]  Oh, it's like the new Victorian age, but it's double think they can do whatever they want.
[03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:39.280]  Teach your five year old how to do horrible stuff.
[03:14:39.280 --> 03:14:41.280]  But then if you're an adult, go ahead.
[03:14:41.280 --> 03:14:46.760]  You are like secretly recording an entity's tape or the doll, the stuff that Gore Vidal
[03:14:46.760 --> 03:14:47.960]  was putting out.
[03:14:47.960 --> 03:14:52.920]  Oh, he put movies out where trainees are raping people and sexually liberated.
[03:14:52.920 --> 03:14:55.680]  They're allowed to rape everyone and it's loving.
[03:14:55.680 --> 03:15:00.440]  And Gore Vidal's been on the show and wrote some good stuff, too, and I mean, I'm attacking
[03:15:00.440 --> 03:15:04.480]  him on every front, but he wrote some stuff that I read, which is like he's advocating
[03:15:04.480 --> 03:15:06.800]  a tranny running around raping people.
[03:15:06.800 --> 03:15:08.000]  That's not right.
[03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:10.560]  But because it's liberating for the tranny, it's okay.
[03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:11.560]  Right?
[03:15:11.560 --> 03:15:14.240]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's that's the whole point is the double thing.
[03:15:14.240 --> 03:15:16.480]  Like you just said, I can do it.
[03:15:16.480 --> 03:15:17.480]  I can do it.
[03:15:17.480 --> 03:15:21.640]  But then, oh, I preach tolerance until you have a differing view.
[03:15:21.640 --> 03:15:22.640]  Now I'm not tolerant.
[03:15:22.640 --> 03:15:25.640]  I'm tolerant of everything and everyone and anyone and everything's great.
[03:15:25.640 --> 03:15:26.640]  I can judge you.
[03:15:26.640 --> 03:15:27.640]  Oh my God.
[03:15:27.640 --> 03:15:29.040]  Wait, wait, you're disagreeing with me?
[03:15:29.040 --> 03:15:30.040]  Shut them down.
[03:15:30.040 --> 03:15:31.040]  He's racist.
[03:15:31.040 --> 03:15:34.200]  I'm going to be just joined as banished the untold story of Danny Williams, search for
[03:15:34.200 --> 03:15:40.480]  his father exclusive info wars.com Danny tries to reconnect with reported father Bill Clinton.
[03:15:40.480 --> 03:15:41.480]  That's my headline.
[03:15:41.480 --> 03:15:42.480]  I did with Kit.
[03:15:42.480 --> 03:15:43.480]  Kit is awesome.
[03:15:43.480 --> 03:15:44.480]  I'm going to change it, though.
[03:15:44.480 --> 03:15:46.200]  His drudge has got it right.
[03:15:46.200 --> 03:15:52.840]  Bill Clinton's son in quotes, the son part in quotes, Bill Clinton's son.
[03:15:52.840 --> 03:15:55.600]  Search for DNA test.
[03:15:55.600 --> 03:15:56.600]  From Bill Clinton.
[03:15:56.600 --> 03:15:58.080]  That's basically it.
[03:15:58.080 --> 03:15:59.080]  Do the test, Bill.
[03:15:59.080 --> 03:16:00.080]  Why would he go?
[03:16:00.080 --> 03:16:01.080]  Bill another thing.
[03:16:01.080 --> 03:16:02.720]  Bernie Sanders used to write smut as well.
[03:16:02.720 --> 03:16:03.720]  Nobody ever brought that right.
[03:16:03.720 --> 03:16:04.720]  That was not a big deal.
[03:16:04.720 --> 03:16:08.880]  Well, I mean, listen, Bill Obama's real father reason they did the whole Kenya thing and
[03:16:08.880 --> 03:16:11.120]  his Harvard review and every other publication said, I'm from Kenya.
[03:16:11.120 --> 03:16:12.120]  I'm from Kenya.
[03:16:12.120 --> 03:16:13.120]  We're like, you say you're from Kenya.
[03:16:13.120 --> 03:16:14.120]  Stop lying.
[03:16:14.120 --> 03:16:17.600]  You know, that was all to hide the fact his father was Frank Marshall Davis and then they
[03:16:17.600 --> 03:16:18.600]  write.
[03:16:18.600 --> 03:16:19.600]  He writes in his dreams of my father.
[03:16:19.600 --> 03:16:22.000]  I spent summers with Frank Marshall Davis.
[03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:24.720]  I had grandfather's best friend because it's your daddy.
[03:16:24.720 --> 03:16:30.920]  He looks exactly like who was a communist funding himself with porn and I don't mean
[03:16:30.920 --> 03:16:31.920]  soft core.
[03:16:31.920 --> 03:16:33.680]  I mean, Betty Page stuff.
[03:16:33.680 --> 03:16:34.680]  It pretty good taste.
[03:16:34.680 --> 03:16:35.680]  Well, I'm sorry.
[03:16:35.680 --> 03:16:37.000]  Anyways, here's another thing.
[03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:42.000]  They've got these kids so brainwashed and mind controlled yesterday when Owen was interviewing
[03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:46.560]  people or day before the guy said, Trump said he liked kissing pretty girls.
[03:16:46.560 --> 03:16:48.080]  Oh my God.
[03:16:48.080 --> 03:16:49.880]  Oh, it's like, really?
[03:16:49.880 --> 03:16:52.280]  The humans, the humans are together.
[03:16:52.280 --> 03:16:53.760]  The humans love each other.
[03:16:53.760 --> 03:16:54.760]  They want to have babies.
[03:16:54.760 --> 03:16:55.760]  Are these like aliens?
[03:16:55.760 --> 03:17:00.720]  We must reduce their population, teach them that if this is bad, the slurlard, we have
[03:17:00.720 --> 03:17:01.720]  them not producing.
[03:17:01.720 --> 03:17:02.720]  It was so.
[03:17:02.720 --> 03:17:03.720]  The job bomb you are.
[03:17:03.720 --> 03:17:04.720]  What?
[03:17:04.720 --> 03:17:05.720]  Yeah.
[03:17:05.720 --> 03:17:06.720]  Totally ridiculous.
[03:17:06.720 --> 03:17:07.720]  But that's what they've done to our culture.
[03:17:07.720 --> 03:17:09.000]  They've been ingrained.
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:13.480]  That's why these young kids, there is no racism because they've, you know, literally beat it
[03:17:13.480 --> 03:17:14.480]  out of them.
[03:17:14.480 --> 03:17:15.560]  There is no anything.
[03:17:15.560 --> 03:17:16.560]  There is.
[03:17:16.560 --> 03:17:17.560]  Follow what the state says.
[03:17:17.560 --> 03:17:18.560]  Yeah.
[03:17:18.560 --> 03:17:19.560]  We're the article I asked for again.
[03:17:19.560 --> 03:17:22.120]  It's wrong and everything is racist except what we say.
[03:17:22.120 --> 03:17:23.120]  I agree, dude.
[03:17:23.120 --> 03:17:24.120]  We're going back to you.
[03:17:24.120 --> 03:17:25.880]  I just want to play two clips and I'm out of here.
[03:17:25.880 --> 03:17:27.080]  But let me show you this article.
[03:17:27.080 --> 03:17:29.840]  One of the WikiLeaks, infowars.com.
[03:17:29.840 --> 03:17:36.840]  Clinton campaign email outlines effort to quote, practice an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[03:17:36.840 --> 03:17:39.040]  Now, I just quoted this.
[03:17:39.040 --> 03:17:43.720]  Clinton email outlines effort to practice an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[03:17:43.720 --> 03:17:46.800]  Here, let me read this to you.
[03:17:46.800 --> 03:17:50.560]  A Clinton campaign email released a part of WikiLeaks down at home earlier today that
[03:17:50.560 --> 03:17:54.440]  talks about a need to maintain political power by producing a quote, unaware and compliant
[03:17:54.440 --> 03:17:55.440]  citizenry.
[03:17:55.440 --> 03:17:56.520]  But the quote gets better.
[03:17:56.520 --> 03:17:58.800]  Get ready for this.
[03:17:58.800 --> 03:17:59.800]  The email.
[03:17:59.800 --> 03:18:02.840]  Because this doesn't look like an alien would say, you're the one that is under, say it
[03:18:02.840 --> 03:18:03.840]  in an NPR voice.
[03:18:03.840 --> 03:18:04.840]  So it's okay.
[03:18:04.840 --> 03:18:05.840]  You are overpopulated.
[03:18:05.840 --> 03:18:06.840]  You are no longer reading.
[03:18:06.840 --> 03:18:07.840]  Okay.
[03:18:07.840 --> 03:18:08.840]  Sure.
[03:18:08.840 --> 03:18:09.840]  Calm.
[03:18:09.840 --> 03:18:12.840]  The email was sent to Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta by former Clinton
[03:18:12.840 --> 03:18:20.640]  administration official, Bill Ivy, on March 13, 2016, trust us, love us, sleep, sleepy
[03:18:20.640 --> 03:18:26.920]  time, free doctors, we're liberals.
[03:18:26.920 --> 03:18:31.160]  Ivy was appointed chairman of the National Entomology Arts during Bill Clinton's second
[03:18:31.160 --> 03:18:32.160]  term.
[03:18:32.160 --> 03:18:36.640]  According to his bio, Ivy is the trustee of the Center for American Progress at Clinton
[03:18:36.640 --> 03:18:41.400]  campaign front and was a team leader in Barack Obama's presidential transition.
[03:18:41.400 --> 03:18:46.360]  In the email, Ivy outlines a panic among some Democrats that Donald Trump's quote celebrity
[03:18:46.360 --> 03:18:52.280]  politics persona cannot be matched by Hillary, who is quote, not an entertainer and not a
[03:18:52.280 --> 03:18:56.640]  celebrity in the Trump Kardashian mold close quote, continuing to quote from the email
[03:18:56.640 --> 03:19:01.160]  in the latest WikiLeaks data.com, I'm never gonna see I talk like this, it means I'm
[03:19:01.160 --> 03:19:02.160]  intellectual.
[03:19:02.160 --> 03:19:04.160]  Not reading talking points.
[03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:05.160]  Money isn't.
[03:19:05.160 --> 03:19:06.160]  Let me get back.
[03:19:06.160 --> 03:19:07.160]  I'm sorry.
[03:19:07.160 --> 03:19:08.160]  Let me just be real condescending and I'm a total genius.
[03:19:08.160 --> 03:19:14.520]  I don't have a slow IQ, but I'm channeling these people, channeling them, I'm a parasite.
[03:19:14.520 --> 03:19:15.800]  Money isn't.
[03:19:15.800 --> 03:19:23.120]  Money isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the election process.
[03:19:23.120 --> 03:19:25.120]  So they admit he's hijacking it.
[03:19:25.120 --> 03:19:26.840]  Trump masters TV.
[03:19:26.840 --> 03:19:32.200]  TV, TV called news picks up the repeats and repeats to the death.
[03:19:32.200 --> 03:19:41.920]  Skip the break, guys, to the optimized blowhard and his harebrained ideas free floating discontent
[03:19:41.920 --> 03:19:47.000]  attaches to the seeming strongman and we're off and running, complains Ivy and he's got
[03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:48.000]  the psychology.
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:51.440]  We're looking for somebody to just take the government back, follow constitution, take
[03:19:51.440 --> 03:19:55.480]  the handcuffs off, don't let shine everybody else have double sided deals with these little
[03:19:55.480 --> 03:19:56.920]  slimmers that get it.
[03:19:56.920 --> 03:20:00.080]  Notice everything you're hearing from them is what I tell you word for word every day,
[03:20:00.080 --> 03:20:01.960]  but from the perspective of liberty.
[03:20:01.960 --> 03:20:02.960]  I'm telling you how they work.
[03:20:02.960 --> 03:20:03.960]  Let me get back in the mode.
[03:20:03.960 --> 03:20:04.960]  It's hard to talk like these people.
[03:20:04.960 --> 03:20:12.400]  But when behind the scenes, they just hop over and they're like, I'm going to get you
[03:20:12.400 --> 03:20:17.080]  and murder you once we're in control and they go, oh, liberal, non-threatening, it's all
[03:20:17.080 --> 03:20:18.080]  their camera.
[03:20:18.080 --> 03:20:23.920]  I'm wearing different color socks and I'm wearing a, I'm wearing a Hindi necklace.
[03:20:23.920 --> 03:20:28.200]  Now you are under rock control.
[03:20:28.200 --> 03:20:29.200]  Excuse me.
[03:20:29.200 --> 03:20:30.200]  Oh, let me get back into character.
[03:20:30.200 --> 03:20:37.080]  I'm a fake liberal, I'm a fake, oh, peace brothers, hold on.
[03:20:37.080 --> 03:20:44.080]  And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics
[03:20:44.080 --> 03:20:50.520]  and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.
[03:20:50.520 --> 03:20:56.840]  The higher caste leader says, now here's the most important part.
[03:20:56.840 --> 03:21:03.720]  The unawareness remains strong, the unawareness remains strong.
[03:21:03.720 --> 03:21:08.320]  Keep them in sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.
[03:21:08.320 --> 03:21:15.840]  The unawareness remains strong, but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.
[03:21:15.840 --> 03:21:22.320]  They're unaware, but their animal instinct, their gut, their spirit, their subconscious
[03:21:22.320 --> 03:21:27.400]  knows and it's not complying.
[03:21:27.400 --> 03:21:32.800]  The unawareness remains strong, but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.
[03:21:32.800 --> 03:21:40.440]  This problem demands some serious, serious thinking and not just pull-driven, demographically
[03:21:40.440 --> 03:21:43.560]  inspired messaging, race war.
[03:21:43.560 --> 03:21:47.520]  So I guess that's some admitting that they rigged the polls to try to provide fake optics
[03:21:47.520 --> 03:21:49.200]  to try to help rig this thing.
[03:21:49.200 --> 03:21:50.200]  They don't rig.
[03:21:50.200 --> 03:21:56.240]  They don't speak with that scratchy voice, provincial.
[03:21:56.240 --> 03:21:57.240]  What is that, racist?
[03:21:57.240 --> 03:21:58.240]  What?
[03:21:58.240 --> 03:21:59.240]  I don't have to, just racist.
[03:21:59.240 --> 03:22:00.240]  I'm done.
[03:22:00.240 --> 03:22:03.760]  I've been trumped by your comment calling me a racist, but that's what they actually
[03:22:03.760 --> 03:22:04.760]  did.
[03:22:04.760 --> 03:22:05.760]  Racist.
[03:22:05.760 --> 03:22:06.760]  Racist.
[03:22:06.760 --> 03:22:07.760]  Racist.
[03:22:07.760 --> 03:22:10.120]  How do you deal with such intellectual strategy?
[03:22:10.120 --> 03:22:14.080]  Folks, people say this all the time, we want Owen on the streets doing this more often.
[03:22:14.080 --> 03:22:15.080]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[03:22:15.080 --> 03:22:18.080]  I didn't want to execute them, felt I owed it to them.
[03:22:18.080 --> 03:22:21.600]  Buy the products, okay, that's how you send me to these events, Alex.
[03:22:21.600 --> 03:22:23.880]  Oh yeah, let's play the event tape.
[03:22:23.880 --> 03:22:26.080]  Here you go, here you go, here you go.
[03:22:26.080 --> 03:22:27.560]  No, no, set it up.
[03:22:27.560 --> 03:22:30.400]  Well basically, so these are the people that we deal with.
[03:22:30.400 --> 03:22:31.720]  We've exposed these people.
[03:22:31.720 --> 03:22:34.600]  I don't know how many videos I have exposing these people.
[03:22:34.600 --> 03:22:39.920]  It shows the difference, the dynamic difference between how informed a Trump voter is versus
[03:22:39.920 --> 03:22:40.920]  a Hillary voter.
[03:22:40.920 --> 03:22:41.920]  Go ahead.
[03:22:41.920 --> 03:22:42.920]  Go ahead.
[03:22:42.920 --> 03:22:49.920]  Oh, sexual assault that he admitted to.
[03:22:49.920 --> 03:22:52.920]  He lost a billion dollars in one year.
[03:22:52.920 --> 03:22:53.920]  He's a moron.
[03:22:53.920 --> 03:22:54.920]  Go to Steve Jobs.
[03:22:54.920 --> 03:22:55.920]  Who lost?
[03:22:55.920 --> 03:22:56.920]  Are you one of the rapists in the White House?
[03:22:56.920 --> 03:22:57.920]  Oh, he wants a rapist in the White House.
[03:22:57.920 --> 03:22:58.920]  Who is the rapist?
[03:22:58.920 --> 03:22:59.920]  Who is the rapist?
[03:22:59.920 --> 03:23:00.920]  Who has Donald Trump raped?
[03:23:00.920 --> 03:23:01.920]  I'm saying that.
[03:23:01.920 --> 03:23:02.920]  Oh, it's okay.
[03:23:02.920 --> 03:23:03.920]  I can touch a woman because I'm a woman.
[03:23:03.920 --> 03:23:04.920]  Who has Donald Trump raped?
[03:23:04.920 --> 03:23:05.920]  He's a woman.
[03:23:05.920 --> 03:23:06.920]  Name one woman.
[03:23:06.920 --> 03:23:07.920]  Name one woman.
[03:23:07.920 --> 03:23:08.920]  Name one woman.
[03:23:08.920 --> 03:23:09.920]  Name one woman.
[03:23:09.920 --> 03:23:10.920]  Nobody.
[03:23:10.920 --> 03:23:12.920]  He's a moron.
[03:23:12.920 --> 03:23:13.920]  Donald Trump's a moron.
[03:23:13.920 --> 03:23:14.920]  This guy's made billions of dollars.
[03:23:14.920 --> 03:23:16.920]  One of the most successful businessmen in the world.
[03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:18.920]  His daddy gave him everything.
[03:23:18.920 --> 03:23:19.920]  His daddy gave him everything.
[03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:21.920]  If you got one million dollars and turned it...
[03:23:21.920 --> 03:23:22.920]  Fourteen.
[03:23:22.920 --> 03:23:23.920]  Fourteen.
[03:23:23.920 --> 03:23:24.920]  Okay.
[03:23:24.920 --> 03:23:28.920]  If you got a hundred million dollars and turned it into six billion, would that be a success?
[03:23:28.920 --> 03:23:29.920]  No.
[03:23:29.920 --> 03:23:31.920]  Because I get you better in an index fund.
[03:23:31.920 --> 03:23:32.920]  No.
[03:23:32.920 --> 03:23:33.920]  No.
[03:23:33.920 --> 03:23:34.920]  That's not a success.
[03:23:34.920 --> 03:23:35.920]  Turning millions into billions.
[03:23:35.920 --> 03:23:39.920]  Hillary created the derivatives with Larry Summers and Clinton that has 2.2 quadrants.
[03:23:39.920 --> 03:23:41.920]  That has 2.2 quadrillion.
[03:23:41.920 --> 03:23:44.920]  A hundred times all the wealth in the world were totally screwed.
[03:23:44.920 --> 03:23:46.920]  It never had a real job in life.
[03:23:46.920 --> 03:23:50.920]  But suddenly they don't like it because you have some ventures.
[03:23:50.920 --> 03:23:52.920]  Like I've done films that did not make money.
[03:23:52.920 --> 03:23:53.920]  Only a few.
[03:23:53.920 --> 03:23:54.920]  But each one has a corporation.
[03:23:54.920 --> 03:23:57.920]  I don't declare bankruptcy, but it's a write-off towards everything else.
[03:23:57.920 --> 03:23:58.920]  That's what you do.
[03:23:58.920 --> 03:24:00.920]  A new hotel, a new golf course, an adventure.
[03:24:00.920 --> 03:24:02.920]  He's had four or five bankruptcies.
[03:24:02.920 --> 03:24:03.920]  That's normal.
[03:24:03.920 --> 03:24:06.920]  Warren Buffett's had thousands with his subsidiaries.
[03:24:06.920 --> 03:24:08.920]  He's been billed out by the government.
[03:24:08.920 --> 03:24:10.920]  Four hundred to something billion in the bailout.
[03:24:10.920 --> 03:24:11.920]  I know.
[03:24:11.920 --> 03:24:13.920]  I'll go back to it.
[03:24:13.920 --> 03:24:16.920]  Turning millions into billions is not a success.
[03:24:16.920 --> 03:24:18.920]  This is right out of Austin Powers.
[03:24:18.920 --> 03:24:21.920]  Why make billions when we can make millions?
[03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:23.920]  This is what we're dealing with out here.
[03:24:23.920 --> 03:24:24.920]  Hold on.
[03:24:24.920 --> 03:24:26.920]  Donald Trump is kicking ass.
[03:24:26.920 --> 03:24:27.920]  Have you seen a Hillary Clinton rally?
[03:24:27.920 --> 03:24:28.920]  No, I haven't.
[03:24:28.920 --> 03:24:29.920]  Exactly.
[03:24:29.920 --> 03:24:30.920]  Because nobody goes.
[03:24:30.920 --> 03:24:33.920]  Donald Trump has killed people.
[03:24:33.920 --> 03:24:35.920]  Why don't you like Trump?
[03:24:35.920 --> 03:24:36.920]  Because he's a bird.
[03:24:36.920 --> 03:24:39.920]  This guy just blew my mind with his intellect.
[03:24:39.920 --> 03:24:41.920]  You like Jill Stein?
[03:24:41.920 --> 03:24:43.920]  Do you think she has a chance?
[03:24:43.920 --> 03:24:45.920]  She's got no chance, but it's okay.
[03:24:45.920 --> 03:24:46.920]  Hey, you know what?
[03:24:46.920 --> 03:24:48.920]  At least you're not supporting Hillary.
[03:24:48.920 --> 03:24:49.920]  I've never really understood that.
[03:24:49.920 --> 03:24:51.920]  Could you explain that to me?
[03:24:51.920 --> 03:24:54.920]  I think it's just that...
[03:24:54.920 --> 03:24:57.920]  I'm not well spoken.
[03:24:57.920 --> 03:24:59.920]  Someone just gave it to me.
[03:24:59.920 --> 03:25:01.920]  I've been carrying it around.
[03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:03.920]  You don't really care much about the sign.
[03:25:03.920 --> 03:25:05.920]  I'm just here to get free stuff.
[03:25:05.920 --> 03:25:06.920]  So did you like Bernie Sanders?
[03:25:06.920 --> 03:25:07.920]  Yes, I did.
[03:25:07.920 --> 03:25:09.920]  Hillary supports love and Trump does not.
[03:25:09.920 --> 03:25:10.920]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:25:10.920 --> 03:25:11.920]  Because Trump's racist.
[03:25:11.920 --> 03:25:13.920]  What has he done that's racist?
[03:25:13.920 --> 03:25:16.920]  Just everything that comes out of his mouth.
[03:25:16.920 --> 03:25:18.920]  Well, not hiring, but some of the common city makes
[03:25:18.920 --> 03:25:21.920]  regarding different genders and different races
[03:25:21.920 --> 03:25:23.920]  and just anyone who doesn't consider a true American
[03:25:23.920 --> 03:25:25.920]  when she defines the white male.
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:27.920]  When did he do that?
[03:25:27.920 --> 03:25:29.920]  I don't want to talk to you anymore.
[03:25:29.920 --> 03:25:32.920]  Well, I feel like Donald Trump does a lot of things
[03:25:32.920 --> 03:25:35.920]  that could be construed as evil.
[03:25:35.920 --> 03:25:36.920]  Can you name one?
[03:25:36.920 --> 03:25:39.920]  How about the video that was just released?
[03:25:39.920 --> 03:25:40.920]  How can you support Trump?
[03:25:40.920 --> 03:25:41.920]  I just don't...
[03:25:41.920 --> 03:25:42.920]  Because I want to save America personally.
[03:25:42.920 --> 03:25:44.920]  Do you want a rapist in the White House?
[03:25:44.920 --> 03:25:46.920]  Hillary is running for president.
[03:25:46.920 --> 03:25:48.920]  So is Bill not going to go to the White House then?
[03:25:48.920 --> 03:25:49.920]  Bill will be in the White House.
[03:25:49.920 --> 03:25:50.920]  So do you want a rapist in the White House?
[03:25:50.920 --> 03:25:52.920]  Donald Trump would be in the White House.
[03:25:52.920 --> 03:25:54.920]  Do you want a rapist in the White House?
[03:25:54.920 --> 03:25:55.920]  Hillary is running for president.
[03:25:55.920 --> 03:25:56.920]  You're not answering the question.
[03:25:56.920 --> 03:25:58.920]  Do you want a rapist in the White House?
[03:25:58.920 --> 03:25:59.920]  Bill is not a rapist.
[03:25:59.920 --> 03:26:01.920]  Do you want a rapist in the White House?
[03:26:01.920 --> 03:26:06.260]  Hillary is running for president won't answer the question you made it an issue about women
[03:26:06.260 --> 03:26:09.900]  You made it an issue about women. So if you're gonna call out Trump's rhetoric against women
[03:26:09.900 --> 03:26:13.340]  Why don't you call out Bill's actual rape because Bill has nothing to do with this election?
[03:26:13.340 --> 03:26:19.300]  This is settled versus Donald Trump. Go ahead. This should be about Trump's policies versus Hillary's. I agree
[03:26:19.820 --> 03:26:24.860]  Specifically, I'm referring to the video from 2005. What do you think about the email leaks that show who Hillary really is?
[03:26:24.860 --> 03:26:25.900]  I don't care
[03:26:25.900 --> 03:26:31.480]  Donald Trump said on this video that he likes kissing pretty women and that you don't
[03:26:32.320 --> 03:26:34.320]  Sir, let me can I finish?
[03:26:36.320 --> 03:26:41.140]  Email leaks have shown how Hillary Clinton has called her own supporters dumbasses
[03:26:41.660 --> 03:26:49.020]  Donald Trump like you said that Mexicans are rapists and murderers never said that never said that he said illegal immigrants
[03:26:49.020 --> 03:26:57.660]  No, we shouldn't that's your logic. Donald Trump is saying that all Mexicans are rapists and murderers. How ever said that?
[03:26:58.780 --> 03:27:00.780]  All right, that's powerful
[03:27:01.140 --> 03:27:05.940]  Obviously folks these people I'm not being mean to them, but they all look very weak
[03:27:06.620 --> 03:27:08.380]  very pale
[03:27:08.380 --> 03:27:10.380]  like total followers and
[03:27:10.620 --> 03:27:16.540]  Then they keep on the news like he was looming behind Hillary. He may have attacked her experts say you were making a joke
[03:27:16.540 --> 03:27:20.620]  I was eating real quick. I'm doing a break. You know, that's aggressive. You're triggering me eating that food real fast
[03:27:21.180 --> 03:27:25.300]  Like a whoa, like a whoa. I gotta eat here. I haven't eaten since like six eight seven a.m.
[03:27:25.300 --> 03:27:29.740]  So all this is going on and it's literally like they're just these little
[03:27:32.220 --> 03:27:34.720]  This country is literally producing
[03:27:35.180 --> 03:27:37.980]  Piles of jellyfish. I mean, I'm sorry folks
[03:27:37.980 --> 03:27:41.020]  We're done and those of us that produce and are not jellyfish
[03:27:41.020 --> 03:27:47.180]  We've got to break away from these people and just stop submitting to them and them trying to hand pack us how to talk and what to do
[03:27:47.180 --> 03:27:48.940]  I want to show some video here
[03:27:48.940 --> 03:27:53.420]  Going out to break, you know a final comment that we shot of a Bayhar, you know attacking
[03:27:53.740 --> 03:27:58.740]  The women calling them trams 12 year old girls. They got brutally raped. You know guy got convicted Hillary how to stop it
[03:27:59.300 --> 03:28:04.740]  She said she knew was innocent and then it just feeds into her vomiting green balls and this new riveting thing
[03:28:04.740 --> 03:28:06.740]  She did yesterday and then it cuts into
[03:28:06.740 --> 03:28:14.380]  Actually a shot of her literally being a severed alien head. I believe she is a literal spider from outer space walking around eating people
[03:28:14.380 --> 03:28:20.540]  I'm being sarcastic. I'm trolling the media, but here it is several of those women slept with him knowing he was a married man
[03:28:24.980 --> 03:28:30.380]  Again, she is the victim here. What difference at this point does it make?
[03:28:30.380 --> 03:28:38.260]  She's the victim here and and they were saying that she attacked some of those women. They're lucky
[03:28:38.260 --> 03:29:01.260]  Hillary's a good leader. I trust Hillary
[03:29:09.060 --> 03:29:10.260]  We're going to wear the gas
[03:29:10.260 --> 03:29:11.260]  Yes, yes
[03:29:11.260 --> 03:29:15.260]  Oh, yes. Thank you
[03:29:15.260 --> 03:29:16.260]  Thank you
[03:29:16.260 --> 03:29:17.260]  Thank you
[03:29:17.260 --> 03:29:19.260]  I just got this knife
[03:29:19.260 --> 03:29:20.260]  Oh, it's better to be over
[03:29:20.260 --> 03:29:21.260]  Oh, my God
[03:29:21.260 --> 03:29:22.260]  This is real fun
[03:29:22.260 --> 03:29:23.260]  Oh, thank you
[03:29:23.260 --> 03:29:25.260]  Oh, this is going to be it
[03:29:25.260 --> 03:29:26.260]  Oh, thank you
[03:29:26.260 --> 03:29:27.260]  Oh, my God
[03:29:27.260 --> 03:29:28.260]  Thank you
[03:29:28.260 --> 03:29:29.260]  Oh, it's better to be over
[03:29:29.260 --> 03:29:30.260]  Oh, it's going to be it now
[03:29:30.260 --> 03:29:31.260]  Oh, there we go
[03:29:31.260 --> 03:29:32.260]  She's hooked up
[03:29:32.260 --> 03:29:33.260]  I'm gonna have it again
[03:29:33.260 --> 03:29:33.260]  Oh, yes
[03:29:33.260 --> 03:29:34.260]  I'm gonna make it
[03:29:34.260 --> 03:29:35.260]  Oh, yes
[03:29:35.260 --> 03:29:36.260]  Oh, yes
[03:29:36.260 --> 03:29:37.260]  Thank you
[03:29:37.260 --> 03:29:42.860]  I mean apparently Hillary grabs more, you know what, than Trump does.
[03:29:42.860 --> 03:29:45.020]  That's actually Hillary in the footage.
[03:29:45.020 --> 03:29:47.020]  Oh, they're taking over.
[03:29:47.020 --> 03:29:50.860]  Let's put the full video up at the end of this video.
[03:29:50.860 --> 03:29:52.580]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.580 --> 03:29:53.580]  Danny what?
[03:29:53.580 --> 03:29:54.580]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:54.580 --> 03:29:55.580]  Danny Williams, inclusive.
[03:29:55.580 --> 03:29:57.580]  Bill Clinton's son, reportedly in FullWars.com.
[03:29:57.580 --> 03:30:05.260]  In the second presidential debate, Donald J. Trump came out and really called out Bill
[03:30:05.260 --> 03:30:10.460]  Clinton for his rapes and how Hillary Clinton enabled him and helped cover it up and also
[03:30:10.460 --> 03:30:12.620]  threatened people in the process.
[03:30:12.620 --> 03:30:17.140]  Now we have an article by Breitbart.com, exclusive video, Clinton's Defenders.
[03:30:17.140 --> 03:30:20.180]  These are crimes terrified of enabler Hillary.
[03:30:20.180 --> 03:30:24.780]  In an exclusive video interview with the presidential suite of the historic Watergate Hotel, the
[03:30:24.780 --> 03:30:29.500]  victims of Bill Clinton's alleged sexual assault, Juanita Broderick, Kathleen Wiley and Paula
[03:30:29.500 --> 03:30:34.100]  Jones got together for the first time in person to express their personal fear of Hillary
[03:30:34.100 --> 03:30:35.100]  Clinton.
[03:30:35.100 --> 03:30:39.380]  There are foreign voters that Clinton does not stand for women's issues.
[03:30:39.380 --> 03:30:43.060]  Something we've been saying since day one, she doesn't care about you women.
[03:30:43.060 --> 03:30:44.060]  Why?
[03:30:44.060 --> 03:30:45.060]  Because she's a pander.
[03:30:45.060 --> 03:30:46.060]  She gets rapists off.
[03:30:46.060 --> 03:30:47.060]  She lives with a rapist.
[03:30:47.060 --> 03:30:48.580]  She enables rapists.
[03:30:48.580 --> 03:30:54.380]  So on November 8th, make sure you get up off your couch and go and vote for the man who
[03:30:54.380 --> 03:30:56.660]  will make America great again.
[03:30:56.660 --> 03:31:00.260]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.

[03:32:04.380 --> 03:32:06.660]  to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:32:06.660 --> 03:32:08.940]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:32:08.940 --> 03:32:13.540]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in
[03:32:13.540 --> 03:32:19.020]  this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:32:19.020 --> 03:32:22.300]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[03:32:22.300 --> 03:32:25.420]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:32:25.420 --> 03:32:28.260]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your
[03:32:28.260 --> 03:32:32.580]  vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional

[03:33:22.500 --> 03:33:32.220]  All right, got about 30 minutes left in the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:32.220 --> 03:33:33.780]  We are deep into overdrive.
[03:33:33.780 --> 03:33:40.300]  I'm your host, Rob Dew, sitting in the Situation Room, and I've got in the other studio, Big
[03:33:40.300 --> 03:33:45.620]  Studio, Joe Big sitting down with a couple Army Rangers, Nate, Self, and Joel Carpenter.
[03:33:45.620 --> 03:33:49.300]  And we're going to talk a little bit about that, actually, Joe did an interview with
[03:33:49.300 --> 03:33:53.340]  him earlier today, he's going to premiere on the nightly news tonight.
[03:33:53.340 --> 03:33:58.460]  But these guys have written a book, and they've also worked, by working in special ops, they've
[03:33:58.460 --> 03:34:00.380]  had to deal with different types of classified material.
[03:34:00.380 --> 03:34:06.260]  So we're going to talk a little bit about how Hillary gets away with this leaking of
[03:34:06.260 --> 03:34:10.620]  classified material, not maintaining it, not keeping control of it, while people like them,
[03:34:10.620 --> 03:34:13.460]  if they were to do the same thing, they would be roasted.
[03:34:13.460 --> 03:34:17.980]  But before we go to them, I want to play just a couple short clips.
[03:34:17.980 --> 03:34:23.940]  We had a caller earlier talking about the PIX 11 news footage where they're talking
[03:34:23.940 --> 03:34:27.660]  about the, basically, they were trying to divert your attention.
[03:34:27.660 --> 03:34:31.780]  They were trying to hide the fact that Hillary Clinton got trounced in the debate.
[03:34:31.780 --> 03:34:34.780]  So they're talking about the cardboard cameras people were holding, and they're talking about
[03:34:34.780 --> 03:34:39.300]  the big guy who asked the question about coal, energy wearing the red sweater, he's the big
[03:34:39.300 --> 03:34:42.460]  winner of the debate, because they can't admit that Trump won.
[03:34:42.460 --> 03:34:45.340]  So they have to do all this obfuscation.
[03:34:45.340 --> 03:34:49.740]  And then they let the cat out of the bag that the reason the Secret Service banned cell
[03:34:49.740 --> 03:34:55.260]  phone footage or cell phone cameras, okay, the reason they banned it is because they
[03:34:55.260 --> 03:35:00.820]  were afraid if you had stuff like this going on, let's see, let's put my foot, my flash
[03:35:00.820 --> 03:35:04.140]  on, of course, now it's not going to work.
[03:35:04.140 --> 03:35:08.380]  If you had the cell phone flashes working, it was going to give Hillary a seizure.
[03:35:08.380 --> 03:35:12.580]  So let's go to that PIX 11 clip now, and here's, oh, oh, I could give her a seizure
[03:35:12.580 --> 03:35:13.580]  right there.
[03:35:13.580 --> 03:35:14.580]  So here we go.
[03:35:14.580 --> 03:35:18.820]  Those of you who watched to the bitter, bitter end of this, did you catch this?
[03:35:18.820 --> 03:35:24.180]  The comeback of the cardboard camera, holy 80s, driving to the photo mat, Batman.
[03:35:24.180 --> 03:35:28.420]  We thought it was like a Secret Service thing, banning the cell phones, but then there was
[03:35:28.420 --> 03:35:33.060]  this whole nice diversion that was happening on Twitter too, Ken Bone winning the Twitter
[03:35:33.060 --> 03:35:34.060]  award.
[03:35:34.060 --> 03:35:35.060]  I know.
[03:35:35.060 --> 03:35:36.060]  Look at this.
[03:35:36.060 --> 03:35:37.060]  You got the Ken Bone costume.
[03:35:37.060 --> 03:35:38.060]  Costume.
[03:35:38.060 --> 03:35:39.060]  Already.
[03:35:39.060 --> 03:35:40.060]  I'm GQ.
[03:35:40.060 --> 03:35:45.340]  The number one most retweeted tweet of the night, more than 67,000 times from CUNY's
[03:35:45.340 --> 03:35:49.980]  own Bayoumi Mustafa, a professor there, I'm a Muslim and I would like to report a crazy
[03:35:49.980 --> 03:35:53.660]  man threatening a woman on a stage in Missouri.
[03:35:53.660 --> 03:35:54.660]  So what do you say, guys?
[03:35:54.660 --> 03:35:56.660]  This would get rid of the selfie, right?
[03:35:56.660 --> 03:36:03.460]  Nobody ever did a selfie, so this is the reason why it was banned, apparently, because the
[03:36:03.460 --> 03:36:07.260]  Secret Service did not trust people to disable the flashes on their cameras.
[03:36:07.260 --> 03:36:08.260]  So interesting.
[03:36:08.260 --> 03:36:14.180]  We're afraid it would sort of inspire Hillary's seizure disorder that you have a problem with
[03:36:14.180 --> 03:36:15.180]  that again.
[03:36:15.180 --> 03:36:16.180]  Yes, you could turn it off.
[03:36:16.180 --> 03:36:17.180]  Right.
[03:36:17.180 --> 03:36:18.180]  Wow.
[03:36:18.180 --> 03:36:19.180]  She just said seizure disorder.
[03:36:19.180 --> 03:36:20.940]  But I thought Hillary's in perfect health.
[03:36:20.940 --> 03:36:23.740]  She was, you know, Bill Clinton said she works like a demon.
[03:36:23.740 --> 03:36:29.980]  Tim Cain says he can barely keep up with her, but we can't have flash photography around
[03:36:29.980 --> 03:36:33.380]  her or we have to have this old 80s technology because she's used to that.
[03:36:33.380 --> 03:36:38.380]  I want to go to one more quick clip before we bring in our guest with Joe Biggs over in
[03:36:38.380 --> 03:36:40.180]  the war room.
[03:36:40.180 --> 03:36:43.180]  CNN voters, or CNN tells voters what to say.
[03:36:43.180 --> 03:36:48.980]  This is a CNN host who is, you can actually hear her coaching the voter, it's the black
[03:36:48.980 --> 03:36:49.980]  lady sitting down.
[03:36:49.980 --> 03:36:52.580]  You can hear her saying exactly what to say.
[03:36:52.580 --> 03:36:53.580]  So check this out.
[03:36:53.580 --> 03:36:56.860]  This is how they try to fool you by staging everything.
[03:36:56.860 --> 03:37:01.300]  And you notice CNN was one of the only polls that had Clinton winning the debate.
[03:37:01.300 --> 03:37:03.620]  Here you go.
[03:37:03.620 --> 03:37:07.300]  That America already is great, but we are great because we are good.
[03:37:07.300 --> 03:37:09.300]  America is great.
[03:37:09.300 --> 03:37:10.300]  All right.
[03:37:10.300 --> 03:37:15.820]  So I want to ask you, what was it about Hillary Clinton's argument that resonated with you
[03:37:15.820 --> 03:37:19.020]  following Donald Trump's defense of the video?
[03:37:19.020 --> 03:37:21.420]  She stated that America is already great.
[03:37:21.420 --> 03:37:25.420]  And I tend to agree with that, though we are slow in progressing in number of areas we
[03:37:25.420 --> 03:37:28.540]  are progressing when we continue the momentum.
[03:37:28.540 --> 03:37:32.460]  Like a train seal, she tells her what to say, then she repeats it.
[03:37:32.460 --> 03:37:34.780]  And then we pretend that it's actual news.
[03:37:34.780 --> 03:37:37.300]  That's what they're doing over at CNN.
[03:37:37.300 --> 03:37:38.300]  What was that?
[03:37:38.300 --> 03:37:41.300]  I didn't hear you.
[03:37:41.300 --> 03:37:44.340]  I heard somebody say something in my ear, but I don't know if they're giving me direction
[03:37:44.340 --> 03:37:45.340]  or not.
[03:37:45.340 --> 03:37:49.740]  So I was too busy clapping like a seal, performing like they tell me to do at CNN because that's
[03:37:49.740 --> 03:37:50.740]  what they do.
[03:37:50.740 --> 03:37:53.340]  They want you to perform for the camera.
[03:37:53.340 --> 03:37:57.420]  I'm not going to have time to go to this video, but we just posted this from Millennial
[03:37:57.420 --> 03:38:02.780]  Millie, one of our info wars reporters traveling around, just doing a great job shooting reports.
[03:38:02.780 --> 03:38:07.180]  And she went to a rally in Pennsylvania, I think it was Ambridge, Pennsylvania, talked
[03:38:07.180 --> 03:38:11.180]  to Trump supporters and Clinton supporters.
[03:38:11.180 --> 03:38:14.780]  And you know, I'm going to let you judge the difference and those people, but you can
[03:38:14.780 --> 03:38:15.780]  check out that.
[03:38:15.780 --> 03:38:17.300]  It's on info wars.com right now.
[03:38:17.300 --> 03:38:22.860]  Trump supporter, Trump Patriots versus Looney protesters at PA post debate rally.
[03:38:22.860 --> 03:38:23.860]  And it's amazing.
[03:38:23.860 --> 03:38:27.380]  She interviews a guy says it's not a big deal that Clinton raped those women because that's
[03:38:27.380 --> 03:38:28.380]  in the past.
[03:38:28.380 --> 03:38:29.380]  That's in the past.
[03:38:29.380 --> 03:38:30.380]  But it's a big deal.
[03:38:30.380 --> 03:38:33.100]  Bill Cosby raped him because that's in the past too, but it's Bill Cosby and we're going
[03:38:33.100 --> 03:38:37.580]  to go after him because we don't like him for some reason because he was calling, he
[03:38:37.580 --> 03:38:40.820]  was calling out, I think young black men for wearing their pants down to their ankles
[03:38:40.820 --> 03:38:42.220]  and they don't like that.
[03:38:42.220 --> 03:38:44.740]  They like to keep that image going.
[03:38:44.740 --> 03:38:50.020]  So before we go to our guests, real quick, if you're not supporting us at info wars store.com,

[03:39:26.260 --> 03:39:30.780]  all these Trump rallies we've been going to being able to hire more staff.
[03:39:30.780 --> 03:39:34.420]  So we could do these long, these live events that happened.
[03:39:34.420 --> 03:39:38.460]  You know, I don't know if people noticed, but last week we did the wiki leaks and then
[03:39:38.460 --> 03:39:41.460]  the VP debate pretty much in a 24 hour span.
[03:39:41.460 --> 03:39:45.300]  We were doing two live events plus the show plus the nightly news.
[03:39:45.300 --> 03:39:49.020]  So and this is just the crew that we have.
[03:39:49.020 --> 03:39:53.900]  Some of the crew members were standing up here, 12, 13, 15 hours amazing stuff.
[03:39:53.900 --> 03:39:59.060]  So let's go to the war room where we have Joe Biggs standing by with Nate self and Joe
[03:39:59.060 --> 03:40:00.060]  Carpenter.
[03:40:00.060 --> 03:40:05.700]  These are two army Rangers and guys, let's get into Clinton's use of classified emails
[03:40:05.700 --> 03:40:11.100]  and how you guys have basically been entrusted with the same type of information.
[03:40:11.100 --> 03:40:15.780]  Not that she was getting but classified information and you're not allowed to just willy nilly
[03:40:15.780 --> 03:40:19.220]  put it on servers in your bathrooms, are you?
[03:40:19.220 --> 03:40:20.220]  No, not at all.
[03:40:20.220 --> 03:40:23.660]  I mean, me and Nate and Joel were talking back in the green room and we're talking about
[03:40:23.660 --> 03:40:28.100]  how it's interesting that, okay, you know, classifications, you know, things can change
[03:40:28.100 --> 03:40:29.420]  over time, right?
[03:40:29.420 --> 03:40:33.340]  Something can go from not being classified to classified, but you brought up a good point.
[03:40:33.340 --> 03:40:38.300]  It's not the fact that it went from not being classified to classified is the fact that she
[03:40:38.300 --> 03:40:46.060]  used her personal email server, her personal computer to do work stuff on and that is the
[03:40:46.060 --> 03:40:47.060]  big no.
[03:40:47.060 --> 03:40:48.060]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:40:48.060 --> 03:40:53.540]  Joe, I think back to being in Afghanistan in late 2001 and the protocols we were given
[03:40:53.540 --> 03:40:57.380]  to call home to our family members and I remember talking to my wife on the phone and just telling
[03:40:57.380 --> 03:41:00.020]  her pretty much a bunch of nothing.
[03:41:00.020 --> 03:41:04.220]  Just I love you because we knew that people were listening to the phones friendly and enemy
[03:41:04.220 --> 03:41:06.660]  and it wasn't worth the risk at that time.
[03:41:06.660 --> 03:41:09.700]  I couldn't even tell her what time of day it was because they didn't want to give away
[03:41:09.700 --> 03:41:15.980]  to anyone, what part of the world we were in and all the way down to our lowest privates
[03:41:15.980 --> 03:41:20.140]  who had hadn't didn't have that much time in the Army or in special operations.
[03:41:20.140 --> 03:41:25.100]  They knew that every channel that we had that wasn't specifically classified was off limits
[03:41:25.100 --> 03:41:26.380]  for talking about work.
[03:41:26.380 --> 03:41:31.220]  Yeah, I mean, and that's what people understand like Hillary Clinton knew that this was happening.
[03:41:31.220 --> 03:41:35.380]  We have the proof from the FBI that this was going on and yet they come out and say, oh,
[03:41:35.380 --> 03:41:37.620]  there's nothing we can do about it, no one's going to prosecute it.
[03:41:37.620 --> 03:41:41.340]  But if it were you or I or Joel and we did something like that, we would be in Leavenworth
[03:41:41.340 --> 03:41:42.820]  right now.
[03:41:42.820 --> 03:41:47.780]  And she has this political privilege that she's able to go and do whatever she wants and it's
[03:41:47.780 --> 03:41:48.780]  fine.
[03:41:48.780 --> 03:41:51.780]  Bill can do whatever he wants and treat women like crap and it's okay and we're talking
[03:41:51.780 --> 03:41:53.300]  in the green room as well.
[03:41:53.300 --> 03:41:56.820]  Another interesting point is the fact that everyone's hammering Trump right now on the
[03:41:56.820 --> 03:42:01.740]  fact that these Trump tapes came out and that he said some things in the back while he thought
[03:42:01.740 --> 03:42:02.740]  he was off camera.
[03:42:02.740 --> 03:42:06.460]  Don't tell me a single guy out there who has never said something like that or a female
[03:42:06.460 --> 03:42:09.300]  who has never said something like that because I've been out with my girlfriend on her girl
[03:42:09.300 --> 03:42:11.860]  nights and I've heard women talk before.
[03:42:11.860 --> 03:42:16.340]  They say just as bad things, but Joel was bringing up a good point about the 50 Shades
[03:42:16.340 --> 03:42:17.340]  of Grey thing.
[03:42:17.340 --> 03:42:23.660]  Yeah, so I just find it interesting that everybody hops on the bandwagon kind of and talks about
[03:42:23.660 --> 03:42:29.300]  how horrible it is, whatever Trump has said when we have movies that come out like 50
[03:42:29.300 --> 03:42:30.300]  Shades of Grey.
[03:42:30.300 --> 03:42:31.300]  Objectifying women.
[03:42:31.300 --> 03:42:37.300]  Exactly, and then it sold 125 million copies worldwide and it made a half a billion dollars
[03:42:37.300 --> 03:42:38.660]  of the box office.
[03:42:38.660 --> 03:42:42.980]  So who's buying these books and who's going to see the movie to drive that sort of box
[03:42:42.980 --> 03:42:48.900]  office and do they feel the same way about 50 Shades of Grey as they do about what Trump
[03:42:48.900 --> 03:42:49.900]  said?
[03:42:49.900 --> 03:42:52.700]  Yeah, Trump said something, Bill Clinton did something.
[03:42:52.700 --> 03:42:57.140]  Hey guys, if I could jump in real quick, any Kevin Smith movie you've ever watched has
[03:42:57.140 --> 03:42:58.660]  language worse, way worse.
[03:42:58.660 --> 03:43:04.140]  I mean, you just look at what we throw out in our landscape in media.
[03:43:04.140 --> 03:43:07.460]  It's cursed this, it's cursed that, sexual innuendos, the rap music.
[03:43:07.460 --> 03:43:11.420]  So it's, for one reason, I'm not surprised that Trump would use this kind of language.
[03:43:11.420 --> 03:43:14.860]  That doesn't really surprise me that anyone would use this type of language.
[03:43:14.860 --> 03:43:20.140]  But then to just say that he's the only person in the world to ever use the P word, Hillary
[03:43:20.140 --> 03:43:22.660]  Clinton called all black people super predators.
[03:43:22.660 --> 03:43:23.660]  Right.
[03:43:23.660 --> 03:43:25.620]  But no one's going to say anything about that.
[03:43:25.620 --> 03:43:27.380]  No one's mad about that.
[03:43:27.380 --> 03:43:30.860]  They're mad because Trump said he was going to fondle a lady.
[03:43:30.860 --> 03:43:35.780]  I've been in locker rooms, I've been in the military, I've heard way worse talk before.
[03:43:35.780 --> 03:43:40.900]  And the fact that the Bush has held on to this for so long, they're using this for political
[03:43:40.900 --> 03:43:41.900]  purposes.
[03:43:41.900 --> 03:43:44.060]  They don't care because they've all said the same stuff.
[03:43:44.060 --> 03:43:48.620]  If we were to dig into any one of these Bush guys, I guarantee you, especially George W.
[03:43:48.620 --> 03:43:51.060]  Bush, we would probably hear far worse things.
[03:43:51.060 --> 03:43:53.180]  But hey, let's not focus on that.
[03:43:53.180 --> 03:43:55.180]  Let's go after the one guy who's actually going to do something.
[03:43:55.180 --> 03:43:58.540]  He's flushed their minion down the toilet now that Billy Bush performed and he was like,
[03:43:58.540 --> 03:44:01.380]  oh, I remember I talked to Trump about this and they got the stuff together.
[03:44:01.380 --> 03:44:02.380]  Now he's gone.
[03:44:02.380 --> 03:44:04.060]  He's been suspended from the Today Show.
[03:44:04.060 --> 03:44:06.060]  So that's what happens when you work with these people.
[03:44:06.060 --> 03:44:10.060]  They will flush you down the toilet when they're done working with you or kill you, whoever
[03:44:10.060 --> 03:44:11.060]  comes first.
[03:44:11.060 --> 03:44:14.260]  So I'm here to hear a studio now with Nate Self and Joe Carpenter.
[03:44:14.260 --> 03:44:17.740]  They were in the first battalion 75th Ranger regiment.
[03:44:17.740 --> 03:44:22.900]  And today we actually had an opportunity to talk about the book that Nate wrote, My Two
[03:44:22.900 --> 03:44:29.060]  Wars, and he was part of a very intense battle in Afghanistan called the Battle of Thakur
[03:44:29.060 --> 03:44:30.060]  Ghar.
[03:44:30.060 --> 03:44:33.340]  And tell us about that, you know, go into a little detail about that a lot of people might
[03:44:33.340 --> 03:44:36.140]  have never heard about that, but it's very interesting.
[03:44:36.140 --> 03:44:37.620]  Thanks, Joe.
[03:44:37.620 --> 03:44:43.060]  Yeah, I was privileged enough to serve with the 75th Ranger regiment, which is one of
[03:44:43.060 --> 03:44:46.500]  our most elite army forces, infantry forces.
[03:44:46.500 --> 03:44:54.420]  And I went to Afghanistan shortly after 9-11, and we assumed the mission to kill or capture
[03:44:54.420 --> 03:44:57.100]  Al-Qaeda's top leaders when we were there.
[03:44:57.100 --> 03:45:02.580]  And you know, early in the war, that was a pretty difficult thing to do to find exactly
[03:45:02.580 --> 03:45:04.460]  where they were.
[03:45:04.460 --> 03:45:09.580]  But daily we were flying on missions trying to find, you know, people that were responsible
[03:45:09.580 --> 03:45:12.020]  for attacking us on 9-11.
[03:45:12.020 --> 03:45:16.660]  And a couple of months into that deployment, we had a specific pocket of Al-Qaeda fighters
[03:45:16.660 --> 03:45:23.460]  that were in the southeastern part of Afghanistan, and we made a decision to go in after them.
[03:45:23.460 --> 03:45:28.140]  And part of that operation, which came to be known as Operation Anaconda, we had a SEAL
[03:45:28.140 --> 03:45:34.820]  team that was going in to land in this enemy-held area, and they were going to occupy a mountain
[03:45:34.820 --> 03:45:39.180]  top called Thakur Ghar, which is literally translated Tall Mountain.
[03:45:39.180 --> 03:45:44.780]  And they were going to go in there and basically report and call in close air strikes on the
[03:45:44.780 --> 03:45:46.300]  enemy.
[03:45:46.300 --> 03:45:53.380]  And as they were infiltrating, they essentially landed in an enemy position, came under fire,
[03:45:53.380 --> 03:45:58.540]  and as the pilot flew away, one of the SEAL team members fell out of the back of the helicopter
[03:45:58.540 --> 03:46:04.220]  into enemy hands, essentially surrounded, cut off alone as his helicopter flew away.
[03:46:04.220 --> 03:46:08.300]  His name is Neil Roberts, member of SEAL Team 6.
[03:46:08.300 --> 03:46:14.580]  And after one failed rescue attempt, my team was called to come in and try to find him,
[03:46:14.580 --> 03:46:17.900]  and we were also shot down in the same mountain.
[03:46:17.900 --> 03:46:22.460]  So if I'm not correct, you said it was you, it was 10 people on the helicopter, right?
[03:46:22.460 --> 03:46:27.100]  So it was 10 rangers in that first wave, then you had another wave that was coming in afterwards.
[03:46:27.100 --> 03:46:28.580]  You guys came in separately.
[03:46:28.580 --> 03:46:33.100]  Your helicopter was shot down, and from there, you guys were in a pretty intense battle for
[03:46:33.100 --> 03:46:34.100]  quite some time.
[03:46:34.100 --> 03:46:37.900]  Tell us about what happened once the helicopter went down, what you guys did, and how that
[03:46:37.900 --> 03:46:38.900]  unfolded.
[03:46:38.900 --> 03:46:42.100]  Well, the assault team was two teams of rangers across two helicopters, and I was on the lead
[03:46:42.100 --> 03:46:45.260]  helicopter, and when we went in, it was just before sunup.
[03:46:45.260 --> 03:46:47.380]  We got shot down in the same landing zone.
[03:46:47.380 --> 03:46:53.020]  The SEALs had been shot up in, and as soon as we hit the ground, it was very intense
[03:46:53.020 --> 03:46:54.020]  gunfire.
[03:46:54.020 --> 03:46:58.100]  Rocket, Hulker, Nades, and machine gunfire coming through both sides of the aircraft.
[03:46:58.100 --> 03:47:00.700]  Yeah, everything they had was thrown at us.
[03:47:00.700 --> 03:47:06.180]  We were essentially in a kill zone of an ambush on our landing zone, and kind of trapped inside
[03:47:06.180 --> 03:47:07.180]  the helicopter.
[03:47:07.180 --> 03:47:11.540]  So as we started to get out of the back of the helicopter, several other rangers were
[03:47:11.540 --> 03:47:15.660]  wounded or killed getting off the aircraft, and frankly, none of us should have gotten
[03:47:15.660 --> 03:47:18.620]  out of the aircraft alive.
[03:47:18.620 --> 03:47:23.900]  But my team, along with the air crew, that started to fight also, that was more than
[03:47:23.900 --> 03:47:29.740]  the 10, but we had many wounded and killed at that point, began to fight just before
[03:47:29.740 --> 03:47:36.900]  sunup, knee deep snow on top of this mountain, about 10,000 feet above sea level, and just
[03:47:36.900 --> 03:47:43.740]  started to try to take the fight to the enemy, and called in close air support, nearly on
[03:47:43.740 --> 03:47:50.060]  our own position for several hours as we tried to inch our way towards the enemy, and after
[03:47:50.060 --> 03:47:54.980]  a few hours we were able to take the mountain, and then we found Neil Roberts and secured
[03:47:54.980 --> 03:48:02.900]  him, and he had already been killed, and John Chapman, a member of his team, that was part
[03:48:02.900 --> 03:48:07.780]  of a first rescue attempt of his original SEAL team, they went up there and tried to find
[03:48:07.780 --> 03:48:11.620]  him, couldn't find him, and John Chapman was killed up there as well.
[03:48:11.620 --> 03:48:19.260]  So five men on board my aircraft were killed, laying down their lives to bring one home.
[03:48:19.260 --> 03:48:20.760]  Yeah, that's intense.
[03:48:20.760 --> 03:48:26.380]  I mean, think about this, you hear today in these new leaked emails that in one of them,
[03:48:26.380 --> 03:48:31.500]  it says that Hillary hates everyday Americans, everyday Americans who go out there and lay
[03:48:31.500 --> 03:48:37.620]  down their life to fight for freedom, to fight for America, to me that pisses me off.
[03:48:37.620 --> 03:48:41.740]  You are a true hero, but she calls us deplorables.
[03:48:41.740 --> 03:48:46.700]  That's the kind of political environment we are in right now, that we have someone who
[03:48:46.700 --> 03:48:51.340]  wants to bring back true Americana patriotism, that it's okay to have a flag, that it's okay
[03:48:51.340 --> 03:48:57.260]  to say the pledge of allegiance, and then we've got one lady who just hates America.
[03:48:57.260 --> 03:48:58.260]  What do you think about that?
[03:48:58.260 --> 03:49:06.220]  Well, those are strong words, and it's difficult to watch what's happened to our country in
[03:49:06.220 --> 03:49:11.900]  a situation of security, and even domestically, the situation of security, but abroad as well,
[03:49:11.900 --> 03:49:17.420]  what's happened since we all were over there fighting those wars, and those brothers and
[03:49:17.420 --> 03:49:25.580]  sisters that we have that are still over there and deploying to feel that level of disrespect.
[03:49:25.580 --> 03:49:28.380]  That's a tough one to take.
[03:49:28.380 --> 03:49:33.500]  Yeah, it's interesting, and we've seen the military move in such a direction that's just
[03:49:33.500 --> 03:49:39.340]  out of this world over the last eight years under Obama, we have these, now the military
[03:49:39.340 --> 03:49:44.220]  is going to pay for people to have these transgendered surgeries, but we have homeless veterans
[03:49:44.220 --> 03:49:49.100]  on every street corner under every overpass that are sitting there, they need help.
[03:49:49.100 --> 03:49:52.900]  The VA is allowing people to die in many areas, they're on wait lists.
[03:49:52.900 --> 03:49:58.660]  It's horrible, but you want to pay some guy that's confused to chop something off.
[03:49:58.660 --> 03:50:05.180]  We want to take $8 million a year to take care of the.03% of the people that deal
[03:50:05.180 --> 03:50:10.500]  with transgenderism, but we want to ignore the mass amounts of Americans, men and women
[03:50:10.500 --> 03:50:12.780]  who are willing to fight for their country.
[03:50:12.780 --> 03:50:18.900]  Yeah, unfortunately, Joe, the after combat story is one that I've lived personally,
[03:50:18.900 --> 03:50:27.100]  and it wasn't a pretty one for me, although I'm surviving and thriving now with the support
[03:50:27.100 --> 03:50:32.140]  of my family and the community and other veterans.
[03:50:32.140 --> 03:50:37.420]  It is sad to see the rate of veteran suicide, the rate of soldier or service members suicide
[03:50:37.420 --> 03:50:42.700]  that we've seen over the last decade or so, we just have to do more.
[03:50:42.700 --> 03:50:47.340]  I mean, they say there's 22 a day, I think it's even higher, I mean, I know three within
[03:50:47.340 --> 03:50:54.460]  this year alone, you know, three really good friends who are struggling, and I've known
[03:50:54.460 --> 03:50:58.980]  people who've gone at the VA time and time again in tears, crying, asking for help, and
[03:50:58.980 --> 03:51:01.300]  we just can't get it, can't get it.
[03:51:01.300 --> 03:51:05.820]  And it literally is a tougher battle back here sometimes, and it is when you're over
[03:51:05.820 --> 03:51:09.020]  there, because sometimes it was a lot easier, you had your friends around you, everyone
[03:51:09.020 --> 03:51:12.780]  knew what was going on, when you get out, you're alone, almost essentially, you feel
[03:51:12.780 --> 03:51:16.740]  like you're the only one dealing with that, and you have this government that could really
[03:51:16.740 --> 03:51:21.020]  care less about you anymore because you're no longer serving, so to say.
[03:51:21.020 --> 03:51:24.100]  So they wanted to do everything they could for you while you're in, but once you get
[03:51:24.100 --> 03:51:27.940]  out, it's like, eh, you've got other things to worry about, we need to make sure our soldiers
[03:51:27.940 --> 03:51:32.300]  are wearing high heels so they can walk every day, you know, a mile and women's shoes, and
[03:51:32.300 --> 03:51:35.900]  those are the kind of training things that we see time and time again that are popping
[03:51:35.900 --> 03:51:36.900]  up.
[03:51:36.900 --> 03:51:39.740]  I mean, I want to commend both you guys for all this stuff, but is there anything else
[03:51:39.740 --> 03:51:43.060]  you'd like to say about that as well, how the Army's changing the direction that's going
[03:51:43.060 --> 03:51:44.060]  in?
[03:51:44.060 --> 03:51:49.860]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I personally have never suffered from a PTSD or anything, but I did
[03:51:49.860 --> 03:51:55.860]  have a difficult transition when I got out, you know, even continues in some ways today,
[03:51:55.860 --> 03:52:01.140]  but I think what you just were speaking of is that when you get out, you're on your own.
[03:52:01.140 --> 03:52:06.380]  Something that I started looking at was, you know, when you're brought into the military,
[03:52:06.380 --> 03:52:11.700]  there's an indoctrination, and there has to be, and we're taught to, you know, live a
[03:52:11.700 --> 03:52:20.020]  collective model, and it works, it works in the military, but, you know, in other environments,
[03:52:20.020 --> 03:52:24.220]  it doesn't necessarily work, but, you know, you put your heart into that, and basically
[03:52:24.220 --> 03:52:29.500]  everything is shared, so it's ammo that's shared, food is shared, water is shared, and
[03:52:29.500 --> 03:52:34.980]  then when you get out, just like you said, now you're on your own, so there's an indoctrination,
[03:52:34.980 --> 03:52:40.540]  there's not necessarily an outdoctrination, you know, where somebody's looking at the
[03:52:40.540 --> 03:52:45.060]  psychological aspects of maybe someone who doesn't understand that, hey, wait a second,
[03:52:45.060 --> 03:52:52.300]  I lived, and I was indoctrinated into a collective mentality, now I'm an individual again, and
[03:52:52.300 --> 03:52:56.740]  just for me to recognize that that's what happened, you know, a lot of times I would
[03:52:56.740 --> 03:53:01.660]  always be just completely perplexed at, you know, okay, well, wait a second, that guy,
[03:53:01.660 --> 03:53:05.300]  when I knew him in the military, he wasn't that squared away, and now he's flourishing
[03:53:05.300 --> 03:53:08.820]  on the outside, and I think about it, and I'm thinking, okay, well, wait, maybe because
[03:53:08.820 --> 03:53:14.940]  he never really invested into the collective of the military and the brotherhood of combat,
[03:53:14.940 --> 03:53:18.300]  and that's the reason why he wasn't that good at that, but then when he got out, he was
[03:53:18.300 --> 03:53:22.980]  very good at being an individual and becoming an entrepreneur in some of the things that
[03:53:22.980 --> 03:53:28.340]  maybe veterans find challenging, yeah, exactly, so.
[03:53:28.340 --> 03:53:33.460]  So before we end the show today, tell us about your website, tell us about the book, your
[03:53:33.460 --> 03:53:36.380]  upcoming projects, and what we can look forward to, Nate.
[03:53:36.380 --> 03:53:42.060]  Yeah, well, I have a personal website called NateSelf.com, which is my name, the business
[03:53:42.060 --> 03:53:47.620]  that I lead is called Previous.com, that's P-R-A-E-V-I-U-S, it's Latin meaning to lead
[03:53:47.620 --> 03:53:54.420]  the way, or to come before, and we generally do leadership training and leader development
[03:53:54.420 --> 03:53:55.420]  work.
[03:53:55.420 --> 03:54:00.060]  Joel and I have, he approached me a few years ago, and he had been really passionate about
[03:54:00.060 --> 03:54:05.260]  the story of what happened on that mountain almost 15 years ago, and he had already begun
[03:54:05.260 --> 03:54:11.260]  adapting my book and what he knew about the story into a screenplay, and so we've partnered
[03:54:11.260 --> 03:54:15.420]  on trying to bring this story to the rest of America in a way that they could really
[03:54:15.420 --> 03:54:17.460]  experience it.
[03:54:17.460 --> 03:54:25.500]  So if you guys, what was I going to say, what are some of the things that you really find
[03:54:25.500 --> 03:54:31.740]  interesting right now that's going on in this political atmosphere with the upcoming election
[03:54:31.740 --> 03:54:34.860]  on November 8th, what do you want to tell some of these people out there that might be
[03:54:34.860 --> 03:54:37.900]  on the fence, or anything out there like that?
[03:54:37.900 --> 03:54:45.540]  Well, my perspective on it is that you're going to hear more stuff on both sides.
[03:54:45.540 --> 03:54:49.540]  We're not done hearing about both candidates, there's going to be a lot more, I think we're
[03:54:49.540 --> 03:54:56.420]  only going to see more information about both of them, really juicy information, but I think
[03:54:56.420 --> 03:55:03.820]  what you see here is two candidates, one who is living out a career in politics, and we
[03:55:03.820 --> 03:55:11.220]  generally know what we're going to get more of the same, and in a way, to me, seems as
[03:55:11.220 --> 03:55:14.260]  if rules don't apply.
[03:55:14.260 --> 03:55:20.460]  Going back to the just one example with the emails, double standard, practically speaking,
[03:55:20.460 --> 03:55:27.020]  most employees in our great U.S. companies would be facing serious disciplinary action
[03:55:27.020 --> 03:55:31.660]  or firing if they had used personal email for sensitive business matters, and we're
[03:55:31.660 --> 03:55:35.140]  talking about the Commander-in-Chief, potentially.
[03:55:35.140 --> 03:55:40.180]  I think that that's egregious, I think that there's no excuse for it, and it's absolutely
[03:55:40.180 --> 03:55:49.020]  a double standard, it's pretty simple stuff, and if that's an indication for a disregard
[03:55:49.020 --> 03:55:55.140]  for the law, I don't expect it to change moving forward.
[03:55:55.140 --> 03:55:59.180]  On the other hand, you have someone who is absolutely an outsider, who's willing to take
[03:55:59.180 --> 03:56:07.140]  on status quo and willing to challenge the Clintons, frankly, and I think that the people
[03:56:07.140 --> 03:56:12.220]  that are willing to sign up politically to challenge the Clintons, it's a pretty small
[03:56:12.220 --> 03:56:13.220]  list of people.
[03:56:13.220 --> 03:56:15.460]  And it's a pretty dangerous task.
[03:56:15.460 --> 03:56:20.420]  Yeah, it is, because as you see, more stuff will come out, and I think we should just
[03:56:20.420 --> 03:56:24.300]  expect that, and take it in stride on both sides.
[03:56:24.300 --> 03:56:25.300]  Joel?
[03:56:25.300 --> 03:56:32.860]  I just think it's interesting, even as today, where we see on some of the WikiLeaks where
[03:56:32.860 --> 03:56:39.700]  they're talking about the removal of civics from teaching, and for me personally, I found
[03:56:39.700 --> 03:56:47.180]  myself where I enlisted after 2001, in September or October timeframe, and I wanted to go fight
[03:56:47.180 --> 03:56:48.180]  for the country.
[03:56:48.180 --> 03:56:53.980]  I wanted to do all these things out of patriotism, but then after I'd ETS'd and gotten out,
[03:56:53.980 --> 03:56:59.060]  I'd realized that I'd done all these things that I'd never even actually read our Constitution,
[03:56:59.060 --> 03:57:05.620]  which sounds crazy, because I was 26 years old, and I went back and read it.
[03:57:05.620 --> 03:57:13.300]  So I know that when I was being brought up, that wasn't something that was put in front
[03:57:13.300 --> 03:57:16.900]  of us in our schools and stuff like that, so I think it's really important, and I think
[03:57:16.900 --> 03:57:21.460]  that part of the reason that we're suffering so much today is because of that, which is
[03:57:21.460 --> 03:57:25.100]  evidenced by even in that email, they like it that way.
[03:57:25.100 --> 03:57:29.740]  When we're ill-informed, we don't know what's going on, we don't know what rights are being
[03:57:29.740 --> 03:57:35.700]  violated, it's kind of like it's left up to circumstance at that point.
[03:57:35.700 --> 03:57:39.180]  It's left up to our controllers, guys, and I wholeheartedly agree.
[03:57:39.180 --> 03:57:40.300]  I think it's great.
[03:57:40.300 --> 03:57:44.180]  It's never too late to read your Constitution and educate yourself on the Bill of Rights,
[03:57:44.180 --> 03:57:48.020]  and I think that's a great lesson to end with today, because we are running up.
[03:57:48.020 --> 03:57:52.700]  On the end of the four-hour Alex Jones show, this is the fourth hour of Overdrive, I've
[03:57:52.700 --> 03:57:58.460]  been Rob Do Your Host, I've got Joe Biggs, and let's see, Nate Self and Joe Carpenter
[03:57:58.460 --> 03:58:03.660]  to Army Ranger Veterans to bring their perspective to this show, and I kind of, I want to end
[03:58:03.660 --> 03:58:08.980]  it with just a little thing I tweeted out earlier this morning, about 3 a.m., it's Crackhead
[03:58:08.980 --> 03:58:12.660]  Dave Chappelle, y'all got any more of them, Hillary Super PAC funded polls, that's right,
