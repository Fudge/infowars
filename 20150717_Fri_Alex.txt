[01:26.280 --> 01:30.480]  effect last night I thought about doing this when I went to bed and I got up this morning and
[01:30.480 --> 01:36.320]  thought about it and was mulling and around my mind and then right as I went live right as we
[01:36.320 --> 01:46.160]  went live we're talking a minute and a half ago I said you know what I'm doing it so if you want
[01:46.160 --> 01:50.960]  to destroy the tyranny that is political correctness that is designed to in free speech and

[02:19.440 --> 02:24.720]  Watson is going to be joining me obviously to discuss at the bottom of the hour the Chattanooga
[02:24.720 --> 02:32.720]  shooting we got four dead three wounded the fifth person dead of course is a purported
[02:32.720 --> 02:36.560]  shooter there's a lot of witnesses I don't think this is a false flag
[02:39.200 --> 02:45.840]  and you notice I'm right again hundreds of times if you're a regular listener you know this but
[02:45.840 --> 02:54.000]  we played the clubs hundreds of times I've said Islamic State is real Islamic State is a real terror
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.840]  threat Islamic State is not controlled by the west Islamic State is a bag of black widows that the
[03:01.840 --> 03:11.520]  globalist basically allowed to breed funded protected shepherded and now have allowed to come
[03:11.520 --> 03:18.560]  into the west they've foiled more attacks on French military bases today on July 4th they had to
[03:18.560 --> 03:27.280]  canceled July 4 celebrations in the UK for US troops on base and I'm on record hundreds of
[03:27.280 --> 03:33.520]  times in the last few years saying they'll attack recruiting offices military bases guard gates
[03:33.520 --> 03:42.000]  shopping malls Christian schools Jewish schools and other facilities now I'm the guy that wrote
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.920]  the book on exposing false flag and I mean I'm proud of the fact got inside job and synthetic
[03:47.920 --> 03:57.360]  attack and terms like false flag into the nomenclature into the common parlance because Al Qaeda
[03:57.360 --> 04:02.240]  itself is a Saudi Arabian synthetic operation with criminals in our government allowing it to
[04:02.240 --> 04:12.880]  operate but very small mainly a PR front ISIS is a western funded protected not run it's like
[04:12.880 --> 04:19.200]  having wild dogs in a pit you feed raw meat they don't follow your orders but you're you've you've
[04:19.200 --> 04:24.880]  gotten them ready it's like a wild bull they release on a matador nobody controls that bull on
[04:24.880 --> 04:29.360]  the stalls it's kept wild and vicious but there are people that tend to take care of it then you
[04:29.360 --> 04:36.800]  know open the gate and turn it loose the same thing and they're going to use this to take our
[04:36.800 --> 04:41.200]  liberties which they're now doing house committee pass legislation to create special domestic
[04:41.200 --> 04:45.520]  terror unit the day before Chattanooga shooting and they say their main mission is gun owners

[04:59.040 --> 05:03.520]  helm kicked off Wednesday and the establishment media went with the angle that it's just the
[05:03.520 --> 05:09.440]  conspiracy nuts thinking martial law is imminent but what they won't explain about jade helm and
[05:09.440 --> 05:16.560]  what we exposed months ago is mastering the human domain in military terminology the human domain
[05:16.560 --> 05:22.960]  or human domain analytics refers to the global understanding of anything associated with people

[05:34.960 --> 05:40.640]  more than a simple military exercise if you understand the technologies you'll see that jade
[05:40.640 --> 05:47.040]  helm is more an intelligence operation using geospatial intelligence mapping the battlefield

[08:38.240 --> 08:45.440]  2015 i am your host alex jones we have several very important guests joining us today
[08:45.440 --> 08:52.080]  we're going to break down the tragic chattanooga shootings that left four marines dead three
[08:52.080 --> 09:00.880]  wounded and the soul gunman reportedly dead i am going to be breaking down for you here today
[09:01.520 --> 09:08.640]  exactly what i think about this situation and what is going to come in the aftermath
[09:08.640 --> 09:17.200]  we have a house committee that passed legislation to create a special domestic terror unit
[09:19.360 --> 09:22.560]  the day before the chattanooga shooting
[09:25.840 --> 09:31.680]  that homeland security and the fbi say their main target is gun owners veterans
[09:31.680 --> 09:38.480]  conservatives christians libertarians that's on record so they're going domestic we told you
[09:38.480 --> 09:44.640]  after 9 11 it would be used to overturn the bill of rights and constitution 9 11 has definitely
[09:44.640 --> 09:56.480]  done that 15 years after 9 11 roughly we have a 200 000 plus person army ranging around the
[09:56.480 --> 10:02.640]  middle east overthrowing our allies murdering christians murdering non radical extremist
[10:02.640 --> 10:09.600]  muslims and attacking multiple times in france multiple times in north africa all over collate
[10:10.640 --> 10:16.960]  and now two attacks inside the united states the attack of course in garland a month and a
[10:16.960 --> 10:28.720]  half ago and now the attack in chattanooga tennessee now that said in the political correct world
[10:28.720 --> 10:35.040]  that we live in and that the average american is bombarded with
[10:35.040 --> 10:48.560]  when a deranged young man on amnesic drugs goes into a charleston south carolina church
[10:48.560 --> 10:55.200]  and brutally murders nine innocent black people at point blank range because they were black
[10:57.280 --> 11:03.280]  and he shows photos of himself with a confederate flag they have pulled it down in multiple states
[11:03.280 --> 11:10.720]  they are banning it off of most stores they are banning people from selling it on ebay
[11:10.720 --> 11:15.440]  they are demonizing it they're calling for taking down statues of confederate generals
[11:16.640 --> 11:19.200]  they're calling for getting rid of the maryland state song
[11:22.080 --> 11:26.640]  separately all over the u.s they're removing the word boy and girl in school saying it's
[11:26.640 --> 11:32.160]  hurtful to people that aren't boys or girls they're removing the name father or mother
[11:32.160 --> 11:36.640]  in california and other states or husband or wife because the fact that someone could be a
[11:36.640 --> 11:41.600]  husband and wife and they're not included well it has to be banned well you know what what if you
[11:41.600 --> 11:47.520]  feel it's hurtful that record numbers of muslims are being brought in from countries known to be
[11:47.520 --> 11:56.960]  radicalized and to hate westerners to hate liberals to hate gays to hate women being free
[11:56.960 --> 12:05.840]  and who want to attack u.s military installations and who want to attack soft targets ices is
[12:05.840 --> 12:12.240]  a real multi hundred thousand person army 15 years after 9 11 giving up so many of our liberties
[12:12.240 --> 12:19.280]  did we get more security no and our borders wide open because the terror threats are being used
[12:19.280 --> 12:26.960]  to take our freedoms the patriot act is used 99 plus percent of the time against non-terror related
[12:26.960 --> 12:34.480]  cases to overturn the bill of rights and constitution now that said political correctness if anything
[12:34.480 --> 12:41.520]  is hurtful to anyone they're saying it's banned that's totalitarianism so what we need is some
[12:41.520 --> 12:50.000]  strong medicine to force the logical point to force the debate to have the controlled
[12:50.720 --> 12:56.160]  trader media attack us for making this point and then to have the american public have a
[12:56.160 --> 13:02.800]  logical discussion now they will take what i'm about to say out of context this is a big announcement
[13:02.800 --> 13:14.080]  but it's not done satirically it's done at a level of logical discussion if we're going to ban paper
[13:14.080 --> 13:19.440]  bags that are brown in seattle government because someone might be hurt that they're brown bags
[13:19.440 --> 13:24.080]  no one ever said brown bags anything to do with racism they just say it to set the precedent
[13:24.080 --> 13:28.080]  they can ban or restrict whatever they want if we're going to tell kids nationwide and public
[13:28.080 --> 13:33.120]  schools under no child left behind your purple penguins you can't be a boy or girl it might hurt
[13:33.120 --> 13:39.120]  someone that doesn't identify as a boy or girl if you can't have your identity because it might
[13:39.120 --> 13:45.280]  hurt someone else that is the greatest form of oppression psychologically i could imagine that's
[13:45.280 --> 13:58.400]  the wildest cult programming that i could ever even envision in my mind period so to assault these
[13:58.400 --> 14:02.960]  people we have to point out that what they're doing is unconstitutional it's tyrannical it's
[14:02.960 --> 14:10.080]  totalitarian it's oppressive it's cultic but also it can't be selectively enforced it can't be
[14:10.080 --> 14:18.640]  discriminatory and so if we have radical muslims being brought in by the hundreds of thousands
[14:18.640 --> 14:34.880]  a year from everywhere from Turkey Saudi Arabia Kuwait areas of northeastern Africa like Somalia
[14:34.880 --> 14:41.120]  who are then constantly getting caught trying to carry out attacks or who are carrying out attacks
[14:42.160 --> 14:47.520]  against soft targets well if it's hurtful to people they're doing that and if we blame all
[14:47.520 --> 14:53.280]  white people for the shooter in Charleston the deranged shooter and if we blame the confederate
[14:53.280 --> 15:00.960]  battle flag for that then i'm calling for all muslim symbols to be removed and i'm calling for
[15:00.960 --> 15:07.680]  all mosques in the united states to be shut down and i'm calling for all self-identifying muslims
[15:07.680 --> 15:13.600]  of any type to be deported to their original country of origin even if it was if they've
[15:13.600 --> 15:22.960]  been here 200 years i want all muslims deported now and i want all muslims to have their mosque
[15:22.960 --> 15:30.080]  shut down and their minarets removed and their symbols removed and anyone wearing a crescent
[15:30.080 --> 15:37.520]  moon around their neck i want them arrested because we've got police showed up at swap meets
[15:38.400 --> 15:43.120]  you know saying they're there to arrest people selling rebel flags total tyranny hardcore
[15:43.120 --> 15:49.680]  oppression well then let's see it let's see if the controlled left won't just edit what i just
[15:49.680 --> 15:56.080]  said and we'll take it in context because the truth is most muslims aren't radicals most muslims
[15:56.080 --> 16:02.800]  aren't terrorists the truth is that in general the people coming to this country just want to work
[16:02.800 --> 16:08.880]  and be successful and are fleeing the oppression of radical islam i know a lot of muslims i went to
[16:08.880 --> 16:14.800]  school a lot of muslims i don't support blaming all muslims for what just happened but you know what
[16:15.600 --> 16:20.800]  there have been a lot of muslim groups allied with the left who are calling to remove the
[16:20.800 --> 16:27.360]  confederate flag and who are getting into this whole anti anglo-saxon anti white garbage and so
[16:27.360 --> 16:34.400]  it's time for white people and anyone else that doesn't want to be oppressed to say i'm not going
[16:34.400 --> 16:42.720]  to be blamed for what somebody else does but if you want to play by that game we know statistically
[16:42.720 --> 16:51.440]  over 95 percent of terrorism in the world is carried out by islamic extremists the rest by
[16:51.440 --> 16:57.840]  criminal groups who want ransoms they'll point towards oklahoma city that's come out mainstream
[16:57.840 --> 17:04.080]  news was as phony as a three dollar bill totally shut up southern poverty law center running the
[17:04.080 --> 17:14.480]  white supremacist compound but separate from that this is the logic this is what they're pushing and
[17:14.480 --> 17:26.800]  so if one man killing nine people one degenerate white person who couldn't even get the clan to
[17:26.800 --> 17:34.800]  following committed that heinous act then ladies and gentlemen we have to remove the confederate
[17:34.800 --> 17:39.040]  flag next to the american flag now they're calling to remove mount rushmore you know what
[17:41.120 --> 17:46.000]  let's remove every symbol somebody uses in a wrong way if somebody runs over somebody with
[17:46.000 --> 17:52.960]  a ford truck i want ford to change the symbol change its name and i want by law every ford
[17:52.960 --> 17:57.200]  symbol removed and if you don't ten thousand dollar fine and there have been people that have
[17:57.200 --> 18:02.880]  used chevy cars to kill people in crowds i want chevy band there have been people that have used
[18:02.880 --> 18:08.400]  toyotas to run down crowds one guy remember in california it was killed like 16 people i want
[18:08.400 --> 18:18.480]  that i want toyota banned right now and if a smith and wesson gun is used sue smith and wesson shut
[18:18.480 --> 18:24.560]  him down that's what's happening right now bushmasters being sued by bloomberg groups by this logic
[18:26.240 --> 18:30.720]  if anyone that works for bloomberg ever commits a crime he needs to be arrested as well you see
[18:30.720 --> 18:35.680]  totalitarianism works that way if your neighbor or a guy down the street committed a crime in
[18:35.680 --> 18:41.520]  nazi germany or in soviet russia you would get in trouble too and that's how this works
[18:42.320 --> 18:46.640]  someone's offended by an american flag so now all over the country they tell kids don't wear american
[18:46.640 --> 18:53.120]  flags at school on sinko demyre or whatever i mean that's a joke this is divide and conquer
[18:57.440 --> 19:05.920]  so now ladies and gentlemen we stand at the crossroads and if we have to blame all whites for what
[19:05.920 --> 19:13.440]  the shooter did in south carolina and everybody from cnn to msnbc to saline to raw story said that
[19:13.440 --> 19:19.120]  all whites are guilty all whites you know are basically deserve you know to be ashamed of themselves
[19:19.120 --> 19:23.760]  mtv has shows about white people and and and you know how inherently bad they are
[19:24.960 --> 19:28.480]  even though most white people aren't related to by the ever had slaves most white people came here
[19:28.480 --> 19:35.200]  after slavery doesn't matter just white people are guilty well then fine all muslims are guilty
[19:35.200 --> 19:41.840]  for the latest shooting and they need to be deported to their country of origin and their
[19:41.840 --> 19:50.080]  symbols need to be banned and we need to put up tape around all the mosque and ban all their books
[19:50.080 --> 19:56.720]  as well burn them burn all their books burn the caran get rid of all of it it's racist it's hateful
[19:56.720 --> 20:02.400]  it's murderous everybody's guilty it's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the

[23:03.360 --> 23:07.520]  heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing 10 years ago I
[23:07.520 --> 23:11.280]  created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking
[23:11.280 --> 23:16.640]  about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID I felt having to broadcast
[23:16.640 --> 23:21.520]  my personal information was an invasion of privacy soon after it was also announced that credit
[23:21.520 --> 23:26.880]  cards debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate
[23:26.880 --> 23:32.240]  RFID it was then I formed id stronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the
[23:32.240 --> 23:37.360]  world there are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID I encourage everyone to get
[23:37.360 --> 23:42.960]  informed and get protected please go to id stronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet sleeves

[23:52.320 --> 24:11.280]  as though the protection is free visit id stronghold.com today Alex Jones here back live this broadcast
[24:11.280 --> 24:19.200]  is straight talk on steroids you can't have your cake and eat it too you can't say we're a free
[24:19.200 --> 24:27.680]  society but then we ban every symbol and persecute Christians and say that white people are inherently
[24:27.680 --> 24:33.760]  bad and are guilty of crimes that other white people commit but then say that black people
[24:33.760 --> 24:40.320]  aren't guilty for the crimes that other black people commit or it's racist to want to stop
[24:40.320 --> 24:46.400]  criminals fleeing Latin American justice coming up here when it's a fact that's happening and so
[24:46.400 --> 24:53.600]  I don't say it tongue-in-cheek I want to be clear I say it along the twisted logic of the controlled
[24:53.600 --> 25:00.000]  fascistic left that wants to remove freedom of speech that you can't have your cake and eat it too
[25:01.200 --> 25:06.960]  if you want to sue bushmaster because somebody supposedly used a bushmaster in a crime
[25:07.760 --> 25:15.760]  when it's legal to sell those guns well then you've got to ban the car companies and the cars
[25:15.760 --> 25:20.720]  that are used in crime and you got to ban knives that's your twisted logic and if you want to say
[25:20.720 --> 25:25.600]  that word father or mother is hurtful and ban it well it's hurtful to get shot and killed if you're
[25:25.600 --> 25:31.360]  former range and just instinctively I would never go out and attack a government facility
[25:32.240 --> 25:38.800]  offensively but but just hypothetically I would go out and look for another group of armed people
[25:38.800 --> 25:45.520]  to engage but see that's just the innate chivalry that I have and that's why I'm against these drones
[25:45.520 --> 25:51.040]  and the rest of it and robots killing people because it takes the humanity and the empathy out of it
[25:51.040 --> 25:56.240]  it's very dishonorable and we will end up facing these drones as well and the west has done terrible
[25:56.240 --> 26:03.200]  things with the middle east the most terrible is funding and protecting Saudi Arabia and giving them
[26:03.200 --> 26:09.200]  the weapons and then allowing them to carry out 9-11 and then covering it up and the deal Saudi
[26:09.200 --> 26:14.800]  Arabia gets is they get to take over Iraq they get to take out Iran they get to launch their proxy
[26:14.800 --> 26:20.960]  armies funded by them publicly to take over the Middle East and now their proxy armies and their
[26:20.960 --> 26:29.520]  fellow travelers their bots start attacking soft targets here and they go oh we've set up a new
[26:29.520 --> 26:34.240]  domestic extremist group their main focus is veterans gun owners and people like that and
[26:34.240 --> 26:38.880]  Christians and conservatives and the White House is persecuting Christians and veterans and libertarian
[26:38.880 --> 26:45.360]  groups you see you see how I told you hundreds of times the last four years they would use the
[26:45.360 --> 26:49.840]  Free Syrian Army to equip a new al Qaeda base because that's who they are they changed the
[26:49.840 --> 26:56.000]  name to Islamic State and ISIS they launch attacks domestically they launch attacks all over the
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.920]  world and government uses that to get more funding and more power while leaving the borders open
[27:01.920 --> 27:10.320]  and bringing in unskilled radical Muslims who are now on the streets in Michigan and in London
[27:11.280 --> 27:18.080]  in the news coming up and beating up people drinking at outside bars and telling women put
[27:18.080 --> 27:25.040]  on longer skirts you're in a Muslim area and then it's on local news but nowhere else they're
[27:25.040 --> 27:32.000]  bringing in intolerant people that have a stone age version of Islam you can debate all day whether
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.680]  is Islam is warlike or peaceful I've read both the Koran and the Bible the Bible's got passages
[27:37.680 --> 27:43.360]  about war and exterminating everybody so does the Koran so people that just quote violent parts of
[27:43.360 --> 27:49.760]  the Koran are taking out a context but it is a book of war and conquest so are sections of the
[27:49.760 --> 27:55.520]  Bible there is a time for peace a time for war a time to laugh a time to cry a time to so a time to
[27:55.520 --> 28:05.200]  reap what part of that is this isn't proverbs or is it in Psalms that has some great rock band made
[28:05.200 --> 28:11.520]  a song about it time of the season see if you can find that song we'll play it coming in but the
[28:11.520 --> 28:17.600]  truth is Islam is being radicalized by Saudi Arabia the ones that created a whole empire out of it
[28:17.600 --> 28:23.120]  a couple hundred Bedouin bank robbers basically people that robbed the caravan got funded by
[28:23.120 --> 28:27.840]  British intelligence in 1901 and went from a couple hundred square miles to what is the kingdom of
[28:27.840 --> 28:34.880]  Saudi Arabia they even took over Turkey for a while they now are being funded and allowed to
[28:34.880 --> 28:41.440]  take over by the west as part of their deal because the Saudis buy over 50 billion dollars in weapons
[28:41.440 --> 28:48.720]  alone a year from the United States 50 billion dollars they invest hundreds of billions a month
[28:49.280 --> 28:58.160]  in different western companies they have invested trillions a year they are one of the richest
[28:58.160 --> 29:03.040]  countries in the world and while everybody's obsessed on Israel or the Vatican which certainly
[29:03.040 --> 29:07.280]  both those countries are involved in intrigue and power plays and I have major problems with
[29:07.280 --> 29:12.480]  both those power blocks but when you look at Saudi Arabia it's the political correct group you're
[29:12.480 --> 29:17.600]  not supposed to talk about they quarterback 9 11 our criminal government stands down
[29:18.720 --> 29:23.840]  their arch enemy Iraq it's taken out and blamed and Saddam gets up and gives speeches and says
[29:23.840 --> 29:29.760]  that and they call him a liar and laugh at him and have HBO movies about how evil he is so all
[29:29.760 --> 29:36.720]  these stupid geopolitically inept geopolitically illiterate people can sit around and go there's
[29:36.720 --> 29:43.040]  the bad man say good night to the bad man which Saddam Hussein never did jack crap to the United
[29:43.040 --> 29:48.880]  States and was a CIA officer put in control of that country to launch a war against Iraq
[29:49.440 --> 29:54.800]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[34:59.520 --> 35:07.200]  violin it's time to stop being idiots now i have given many breakdowns especially on Monday
[35:07.200 --> 35:13.920]  the fact that i want to unify humanity around a basic code of libertarian ideas of renaissance
[35:13.920 --> 35:22.880]  of acceptance of human freedom obviously i do not want to deport all muslims obviously i do not
[35:23.760 --> 35:29.360]  want to have a clash of civilizations and a war between the west and the east that is meant to
[35:29.360 --> 35:36.400]  bring in the planetary government but they're launching the war they're bringing in the radicals
[35:36.400 --> 35:49.520]  they're protecting him the reported shooter Mohammed yosef abu abdu lazeez Mohammed yosef abdu lazeez
[35:53.440 --> 35:56.880]  had gone to kawaii a bunch of times that's where his family's from he wasn't born here
[35:58.080 --> 36:05.200]  he didn't fit in he was good at sports he was a nice guy people said but he was very stoic and
[36:05.200 --> 36:10.160]  very freaked out here in this culture and let me tell you i get freaked out in a wild culture
[36:10.160 --> 36:15.600]  a little bit as well but i'm not going to go out and start shooting people i didn't support our wars
[36:15.600 --> 36:20.240]  in the middle east i knew they were fraudulent i knew they were to take out non-radical regimes
[36:20.240 --> 36:24.480]  and put radicals in i knew they wanted to destabilize that area of the world to get the resources
[36:25.120 --> 36:32.720]  i knew it was evil but i don't blame the marines or the army that bought into the propaganda
[36:32.720 --> 36:36.880]  and followed their orders just like if i don't like the militarization of police
[36:36.880 --> 36:42.560]  and some cops doing bad things i don't support nationwide movements to go shoot cops in their
[36:42.560 --> 36:47.440]  patrol cars or shoot them off the backs of motorcycles plus i can go to the statistics
[36:47.440 --> 36:54.480]  and see that the truth is police violence isn't actually up we are just seeing more of it because
[36:54.480 --> 37:00.080]  of cameras and that does not say it's good we're not going to reform the police having a war with
[37:00.080 --> 37:05.360]  them we're going to reform them by getting involved and supporting the good ones because when you
[37:05.360 --> 37:10.080]  don't support any of them then the bad ones are the ones that can take control and that's why
[37:10.080 --> 37:16.240]  george soros and mtv and all these tv channels make it sexy to attack the police for young people
[37:16.240 --> 37:21.200]  demographics for older folks oh the cops can do no harm so older folks think cops and the
[37:21.200 --> 37:25.440]  government's perfect younger people think they're the devil need to be overthrown can you see how
[37:25.440 --> 37:32.320]  that works keep older people from reforming the police haven't become corrupt so good men and
[37:32.320 --> 37:38.480]  women won't get involved and then have the george soros groups wind up crowds that are angry using
[37:38.480 --> 37:46.480]  a few tragedies that have happened to start a race war on this country to change the subject
[37:46.480 --> 37:51.280]  off of the economic conquest and degradation we're under and the fact that there's a planetary
[37:51.280 --> 37:57.680]  depression that we've been in for some time that is now intensifying and beginning to come to the
[37:57.680 --> 38:03.040]  united states spain has basically outlawed all basic freedoms it wasn't since they were under
[38:03.040 --> 38:09.440]  franco that they were a fascist tyranny spain is a socialist system with fascist style government
[38:09.440 --> 38:13.680]  it's been announced that there's no free speech criticize the government you're arrested in any
[38:13.680 --> 38:21.120]  way report on the government you're arrested i mean it's just over the top italy's putting
[38:21.120 --> 38:32.480]  similar laws in place now europe is collapsing you can read the article it's from zero hedge 1984
[38:32.480 --> 38:37.760]  comes to europe the end of freedom of speech in spain even jokes about royals are illegal
[38:37.760 --> 38:44.960]  if you do a cartoon about won carlos the king being a degenerate or are being a fat pig you get
[38:44.960 --> 38:52.000]  arrested tweeting information of a organized protest
[38:58.160 --> 39:06.400]  they're using the islamic radical threat to take our freedoms and then they have movies
[39:06.400 --> 39:13.760]  that are put out on hbo and stuff where they have the left defending radical islam
[39:13.760 --> 39:17.440]  and saying you know that i'm an insane racist
[39:20.800 --> 39:28.880]  because i don't like radical islam i mean i i'm a liberal folks i'm a real liberal like
[39:28.880 --> 39:32.480]  thomas jefferson i mean i believe you can do what you want as long as you don't hurt me
[39:32.480 --> 39:37.120]  i believe in private property all the way i believe in laze fair capitalism i believe in
[39:37.120 --> 39:42.960]  sovereignty i believe in parenthood i believe that do what you want as long as you're not in
[39:42.960 --> 39:52.080]  somebody else's business and these people are not liberals these people are control freaks
[39:53.280 --> 40:01.280]  the sickening socialist left and communist left i'll see them marching with radical islamic groups
[40:01.280 --> 40:07.200]  connected to isis here in austin just because they're evil and nasty they get off on it just
[40:07.200 --> 40:13.120]  because stalin is evil and nasty and mal the these college kids that have rich parents get into it and
[40:13.120 --> 40:17.360]  then they end up being like hillary clinton being co-president and secretary of state
[40:19.120 --> 40:22.960]  i mean the controlled left loves radical islam
[40:26.720 --> 40:31.920]  that chops women's genitals off and puts bags over their heads and in prisons women that get
[40:31.920 --> 40:36.400]  caught driving and the third time they execute women in saudi arabia they get caught driving
[40:36.400 --> 40:42.880]  and i never heard anything on a gloria steinham's fat mouth i mean i am fundamentally threatened
[40:42.880 --> 40:50.240]  by a society that treats women like that i mean i like my women happy powerful and spoiled and
[40:50.240 --> 40:58.320]  taking care of me not chained up in some damn dungeon excuse me but i'm getting tired of it
[40:58.320 --> 41:02.960]  i'm getting tired of a bunch of weirdo control freaks sitting up there saying they're the
[41:02.960 --> 41:08.160]  renaissance they're the liberals trying to ban every form of free speech in this country but the
[41:08.160 --> 41:16.720]  most radical violent crud and nobody's going to walk up to me and tell me what i'm going to do on
[41:16.720 --> 41:21.360]  the street when i don't care if it's a cop or if it's a radical islamicist or the military or who
[41:21.360 --> 41:26.000]  it is i'm going to engage in the first amendment i'm going to engage in the second amendment you
[41:26.000 --> 41:33.760]  ban having firearms in san antonio open carry when they're when the state law says that i can

[42:31.440 --> 42:34.800]  9 11 was staged with saudi arabia and criminals in our government
[42:35.840 --> 42:42.480]  it was not a real organization isis just blew up a egyptian ship yesterday
[42:42.480 --> 42:49.520]  they just took over egypt for a year and killed tens of thousands of people
[42:50.640 --> 42:54.560]  and our government supported it and cnn got up there with anderson cooper who is central
[42:54.560 --> 42:58.560]  intelligence agency on record and said it was a wonderful thing that was happening
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.240]  six months into the burning christians upside down and crucifying everyone ever
[43:05.120 --> 43:09.760]  the our news i would sit there and watch anderson cooper praise it and they praise the libya take
[43:09.760 --> 43:17.520]  over and they praise the syria situation and so they pre-deployed a bunch of us weapons and
[43:17.520 --> 43:24.080]  warehouses and had them resupply into iraq let them come in and their convoys didn't take any of them
[43:24.080 --> 43:38.640]  out let them behave in whatever type of activity they wanted and now their operatives who are
[43:38.640 --> 43:43.200]  allowed to be recruited online i mean i told you i've seen isis stuff in demonstrations in austin
[43:43.200 --> 43:48.160]  i've seen at the white house i've seen it my reporters have seen it in ferguson i told you
[43:48.160 --> 43:53.840]  this is real and i'm not pushing the narrative oh my gosh there's terrorists under every table
[43:53.840 --> 43:58.640]  let's give our rights up no i said they will let them take over the middle east and much of africa
[43:58.640 --> 44:02.960]  they'll then start attacking europe the united states in the uk and then the answer will be
[44:02.960 --> 44:09.680]  take our rights away and have checkpoints to go in the mall and more tsa on the streets
[44:09.680 --> 44:12.720]  to counter a threat they're bringing in
[44:17.920 --> 44:21.680]  so you're going to ban the name mother and father or husband and wife as it hurts somebody's
[44:21.680 --> 44:25.600]  feeling or boy or girl those are mainstream articles mainstream bills and it's been done in
[44:25.600 --> 44:30.400]  many states totally unconstitutional but we just yes you said this is how i'm supposed to talk
[44:30.400 --> 44:35.120]  so i'll follow your orders now i apologize paul watchens on the line with us i want to get
[44:35.120 --> 44:43.280]  his breakdown on all of this but i am calling for all muslims converts you name it to be deported
[44:44.160 --> 44:50.400]  to the radical extremist third world old world hellhole dungeon of their choice
[44:52.640 --> 44:57.600]  recently colonized hellholes like libya or areas of syria you want to go be slaves
[44:57.600 --> 45:02.800]  you want to go hang out with people that uh openly say pedophilia is okay and i mean that's
[45:02.800 --> 45:08.400]  what these radical islamists are really of a demonic group of people if that's what you want
[45:08.400 --> 45:13.760]  you will be deported and your symbols are banned now that's the logic ban the confederate flag
[45:13.760 --> 45:19.120]  ban mother and father ban mount rushmore ban the american flag it's hurtful well this symbol now
[45:19.120 --> 45:24.080]  in the hands of radicals is hurtful to me and the non radical muslims being killed by it all over
[45:24.080 --> 45:32.880]  the world having their non radical areas taken over the curds the i mean there's a bunch of
[45:32.880 --> 45:36.720]  subgroups that are not radical and don't have a history of hurting people and have a history of
[45:36.720 --> 45:42.560]  work and when those are the areas iraq syria those are the areas taken down those are the
[45:42.560 --> 45:47.920]  areas annihilated we're gonna go to paul watchen briefly we have free shipping at info war store

[46:58.240 --> 47:06.560]  springing this on you paul joseph watchen i'm springing this on you i'm springing this on
[47:06.560 --> 47:11.440]  everybody but following their logic i'm not being satirical following the logic of banning
[47:11.440 --> 47:15.840]  the word mother or father because it's hurtful to someone or boy or girl gotta be purple penguins
[47:15.840 --> 47:20.000]  will put those articles on screen for new viewers or listeners i'm not joking uh banning brown
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.760]  paper bags in seattle because they might be hurtful if anyone says it's hurtful you can ban
[47:23.760 --> 47:28.560]  anything you want anytime well undoubtedly radical islamicists are pouring in they're
[47:28.560 --> 47:32.800]  attacking all over europe all over the united states they just killed former range and wounded
[47:32.800 --> 47:40.240]  three people i mean you can't have your cake and eat it too uh i mean i have a cnn headline
[47:40.240 --> 47:45.920]  will put on screen they since changed it they asked the question why did he do it and then
[47:45.920 --> 47:51.920]  they have this big long article where they say we don't know why he did it well he was following
[47:51.920 --> 47:56.640]  jihad from isis and went and did what they ordered to attack targets
[47:59.840 --> 48:03.200]  if you go to my twitter we'll do it this way because they've since changed the headline
[48:03.200 --> 48:08.240]  if you go to info wars dot com i'll go there and i'll go to our twitter and you go to some of the
[48:08.240 --> 48:17.280]  tweets i'll put it up on screen over here uh that i sent out last night i tweeted uh this out yes
[48:17.280 --> 48:23.680]  why would he do this well i'm telling you why he did it and you go to my twitter
[48:24.880 --> 48:28.480]  because it was a soft target where guns weren't allowed we're going to skip this network break
[48:28.480 --> 48:34.720]  to give paul more time i'm just so angry he went and he picked a place where he could attack people
[48:34.720 --> 48:40.720]  that didn't have weapons to fight back against him and i guess if from a dishonorable perspective
[48:40.720 --> 48:44.880]  that's how you wage war from an honorable perspective that's not what i would do but i
[48:44.880 --> 48:50.080]  wouldn't do that to begin with i mean what if somebody goes and shoots up a radical mosque
[48:50.080 --> 48:56.080]  oh it'll be a white guy an anti muslim we've got a band being anti islam i england has already done
[48:56.080 --> 49:01.040]  this where you can't criticize islam in any way or call it radical or your band from traveling
[49:01.040 --> 49:07.280]  there or you get arrested paul joseph watson from london what do you think of my idea my movement
[49:07.280 --> 49:13.920]  to hey let's ban everything let's ban the american flag let's ban uh uh let's ban islam let's ban
[49:13.920 --> 49:19.120]  christianity let's just all wear gray uniforms and not even speak uh should we launch this movement
[49:19.120 --> 49:26.640]  paul joseph watson well within a couple of days salon dot com will probably write an article
[49:26.640 --> 49:32.400]  saying that you're going to lead to muslims being murdered like they said that your anti pc rants
[49:32.400 --> 49:37.280]  would mean that gay people would start being killed but it's interesting you know alex because
[49:37.280 --> 49:42.160]  i put out a video after those isis attacks a few weeks ago in tunisia and france and q8
[49:42.160 --> 49:48.720]  basically drawing attention to the to the parts in the caran where it directly orders them to kill
[49:48.720 --> 49:54.160]  people you know smite them at their necks kill the unbelievers which is in the can which is why
[49:54.160 --> 49:59.360]  these people are doing this these horrific acts over and over again that's the foundation of their
[49:59.360 --> 50:05.120]  motivation and yet obama's scared to even say the term islamic extremism david camera and every
[50:05.120 --> 50:09.440]  time there's an attack says let's just not call it islamic that's their primary concern
[50:09.440 --> 50:15.520]  but it's funny because after i made that video talking about these violent passages in the
[50:15.520 --> 50:20.640]  caran somebody responded to it this muslim on youtube first he said there are no violent
[50:20.640 --> 50:26.560]  passages in the caran that's nonsense and then he said stop entering into affairs of muslims
[50:26.560 --> 50:33.760]  otherwise you will be killed that's a direct quote so radical islam and islam itself the caran
[50:33.760 --> 50:39.200]  is not violent but don't say that it is violent otherwise we'll kill you and then i put that
[50:39.200 --> 50:45.520]  on facebook and got accused of being intolerant i'm i'm the one getting the death threat but i'm
[50:45.520 --> 50:51.360]  also intolerant if you can work that one out so then we move on to the shooting yesterday
[50:51.360 --> 50:57.920]  after the charleston massacre salon dot com came out and said quote white america must answer for
[50:57.920 --> 51:03.040]  the charleston church massacre which is somewhat different from what they said after the boston
[51:03.040 --> 51:09.360]  bombings which was quote muslims don't need to apologize for the saunayevs and again rachel
[51:09.360 --> 51:15.360]  madow she came out after charleston and and blamed conservatives the gop this subgroup
[51:15.360 --> 51:22.320]  for inspiring the charleston shooting yesterday on a show last night she slammed the ignorant
[51:22.320 --> 51:28.640]  scramble for answers after the chattanooga attack so apparently attempting to get answers about the
[51:28.640 --> 51:36.160]  motives of the killer is only ignorant if he's not white this is the politically correct insanity
[51:36.160 --> 51:41.600]  that we see time and time again after these shootings there was a cnn guest last night
[51:41.600 --> 51:48.480]  after they had announced and confirmed the shooter's name as muhammad yusef abdul aziz
[51:48.480 --> 51:54.480]  they confirmed that he was called muhammad yusef this cnn analyst gets up and says well we don't
[51:54.480 --> 51:59.280]  even know if he's muslim how can we even start to speculate about his motive the guy's called
[51:59.280 --> 52:05.520]  muhammad yusef and he's saying he doesn't even know if he's muslim so again you compare that to the
[52:05.520 --> 52:11.520]  frothing reaction to the charleston massacre the rampage against confederate flags that
[52:11.520 --> 52:18.000]  sensorious attitude that has dominated the past several weeks to this where today salon dot comes
[52:18.000 --> 52:24.480]  from page they they're not even talking about the shooting yesterday they're attacking bill o'reilly
[52:24.480 --> 52:29.040]  you have to scroll way down the page before you even find out they're not even talking about
[52:29.040 --> 52:34.960]  five six days into it plant parenthood subdirector creamily talking about selling body parts and
[52:34.960 --> 52:40.560]  trying to chop the babies up in in larger pieces to keep the organs deliciously fresh
[52:40.560 --> 52:46.400]  for sale this ghoulish display from hellraiser is no big deal i have an idea
[52:46.400 --> 52:51.840]  yeah how about all the folks that we're tolerant of and quite frankly don't care what they're doing
[52:51.840 --> 52:57.440]  in their bedroom um rachel madow and all the twinkies and everybody over at salon how about
[52:57.440 --> 53:02.480]  they dress up and prance around and try to go find some wine bars in areas of syria where they're
[53:02.480 --> 53:05.920]  murdering and raping all the christians how about they go to areas of iraq where they're
[53:05.920 --> 53:11.440]  murdering and and raping with turkish women uh and the and the kurdish women how about they
[53:11.440 --> 53:16.800]  go live in hell that they're trying to export over here because they have such a beef with what
[53:16.800 --> 53:21.760]  made america great the truth is these are mentally ill people that want to just urinate all over
[53:21.760 --> 53:29.840]  what's going on america and they have even no idea the the the hell pits that they're promoting as
[53:29.840 --> 53:36.880]  sexy i mean the left thinks hookahs and and and and radical islam is the sexiest things in sliced
[53:36.880 --> 53:42.080]  bread well they would grab one of these spoiled rotten feminists taken care of by their rich daddy
[53:42.960 --> 53:47.840]  they're growing up driving brand new Mercedes Benz they would take you and rape you for six months
[53:47.840 --> 53:53.600]  and make you a slave before they walk you outside and blow your filthy head off and then you sit here
[53:53.600 --> 53:59.680]  and get mad at the west and the men that made you the freest women in the world and how dare you
[53:59.680 --> 54:05.520]  come between men and women and our relationships and our families you will never break the bronze
[54:05.520 --> 54:11.440]  family you will never destroy humanity you scum you've got a good job but humanity's waking up i
[54:11.440 --> 54:18.480]  mean these people are demons paul they are the scum of the earth go ahead and you know a lot of
[54:18.480 --> 54:23.760]  their sacred cows about radical islam are completely collapsing and again we've opposed the wars in
[54:23.760 --> 54:27.680]  the middle east that's why a lot of people on the right who are making these points attacking
[54:27.680 --> 54:32.480]  political correctness don't really have much credibility because they supported the wars
[54:32.480 --> 54:37.600]  that created these radical islamists in the first place we oppose those wars so we're saying that
[54:37.600 --> 54:44.160]  those were bad uh the attack on iraq you know george bush said god told him to attack that's bad
[54:44.160 --> 54:50.880]  but also being radicalized by violent passages in the quran which do exist is bad so another sacred
[54:50.880 --> 54:57.040]  cow is that these radical islamists are from poor backgrounds and their socioeconomic status
[54:57.040 --> 55:02.400]  is a primary motivational factor for why they carry out these attacks well look at the whole
[55:02.400 --> 55:09.840]  of the chattanooga shooter in england it would be treated as a mansion it's definitely upper middle
[55:09.840 --> 55:16.800]  class for america swimming pool huge house you know he was a an engineering graduate came from a
[55:16.800 --> 55:22.960]  wealthy family by all for all intents and purposes was living the the american dream so he didn't
[55:22.960 --> 55:29.760]  come from this poor socioeconomic background he wrote in his own blog quote life is short and bitter
[55:29.760 --> 55:35.600]  and the opportunities to submit to ala may pass you by but again we're told over and over again
[55:35.600 --> 55:42.640]  this has nothing to do with islam we're told that radical islam is supported by a tiny tiny
[55:42.640 --> 55:50.160]  minority of muslims when if you look at the actual polls uh in the west 16 percent of french
[55:50.160 --> 55:57.840]  citizens support isis that was reported by newsweek and to put it into perspective only about 27 percent
[55:57.840 --> 56:04.480]  of french citizens voted for president alon in the 2012 elections then you can look at britain
[56:05.040 --> 56:11.920]  9 percent in a recent icm poll said they were sympathetic with or supported isis only 17 percent
[56:11.920 --> 56:18.400]  of brits voted for david cameron in the election a couple of months ago so when you've got those
[56:18.400 --> 56:25.360]  kind of figures it's no longer a tiny infantesimal minority it's a significant number of people
[56:25.360 --> 56:30.880]  that support these acts of terror which is why we get death threats from their supporters on a routine
[56:30.880 --> 56:37.360]  basis and they'll say how dare you say we're violent we're going to kill you yeah that's what
[56:37.360 --> 56:44.880]  one of them said to me yesterday it's totally insane but again you know white people have to
[56:44.880 --> 56:53.200]  apologize when one nutcase goes postal in a church but god forbid don't even suggest that there might
[56:53.200 --> 56:59.600]  be some violent passages in the quran when these islamists are killing people over and over again
[57:02.400 --> 57:08.560]  well paul we need to really make this point and force the issue and say look if you want to ban the
[57:08.560 --> 57:13.840]  term mother and father because it's hurtful um and yeah and you want to ban confederate flags
[57:13.840 --> 57:19.280]  because one guy had one omni did something then then let's just ban islam i mean that makes a lot
[57:19.280 --> 57:25.360]  more sense than what they're calling for well there was actually a guy in london a couple of days
[57:25.360 --> 57:31.760]  or in fact the day before the 10th anniversary of 7 7 it was literally stood across the street from
[57:31.760 --> 57:37.520]  the houses of paulman waving a huge isis flag and then he in fact wore it and started walking down
[57:37.520 --> 57:44.240]  the street the police did absolutely nothing you compare that to the confederate flag flap now people
[57:44.240 --> 57:49.360]  are literally getting invaded in their homes and guns pointed at them for flying the confederate
[57:49.360 --> 57:54.640]  flag on their own property so again there's a huge disconnect there's a huge hypocrisy
[57:54.640 --> 58:00.240]  between what's politically correct and what's hate speech with people now even calling for
[58:00.240 --> 58:05.760]  washington dc to be renamed black city because washington owned slaves you know you saw the
[58:05.760 --> 58:12.560]  mark dies video the other day destroy mount rushmore obama supporters uh fully advocated that
[58:12.560 --> 58:19.200]  though they want to dig up confederate generals paul we're gonna go to break and come back for five
[58:19.200 --> 58:23.040]  more minutes with you then we've got peter schiff on the economy world events with a 30-minute
[58:23.040 --> 58:28.800]  update and more calls and news and then we have another extremely informative guest joining us

[58:55.280 --> 59:00.960]  website info wars dot com because the companies i've been approached by were not the highest
[59:00.960 --> 59:06.640]  quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so i refused probably 30 40 firearms
[59:06.640 --> 59:13.040]  manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms

[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:15.520]  government cover-up mohammed yosef you want answers abdul aziz well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:24.080]  radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones mohammed yosef abdul aziz corporate
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:29.520]  controlled media is still saying was it a terror attack was the iraq allies muslim he'd become
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:35.760]  increasingly interested in islam he was a muslim from cuwait born there a devout muslim
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:40.880]  muslim listening to what he believed god was you know telling him in the korean to carry out this
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:46.880]  attack now brown paper bags are banned in seattle and in city government because they're hurtful i
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:52.560]  think we should ban islam because a percentage of islam is radical and terroristic and we should
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:56.720]  deport all the islamists actually i don't believe that i don't think you blame a whole group for
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:03.200]  one person does but there comes a point where ideologies get completely taken over like the
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:08.480]  nazi ideology was bad do we agree or soviet ideology was bad i mean you'd say don't tolerate that
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.640]  now i know the media will misdirect what i've done and take it out of context but
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:19.760]  i'm doing this for the second debate following their logic all muslims should be deported or
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:28.400]  arrested i mean isn't that pretty much it paul the other issue is you know the mosque in chattanooga
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:35.520]  where the shooter went to do his prayers they cancelled their ramadan celebrations in honor
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:43.040]  of the dead marines and all credit to them unlike obama who before even making a statement or paying
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:49.760]  tribute to the dead marines issued a statement basically lecturing americans on how they should
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:55.760]  respect islam now obviously i'm sorry i should have led the show with that i totally apologize
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:01.120]  i want you to hold five more minutes to the next hour and then we'll get shift on i want you to
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.920]  flesh this out i forgot to even get into this or go ahead and cover it now and then i'll cover it
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.880]  with a shift coming up he did this on purpose describe what obama did the stories on info
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:17.200]  wars dot com well for hours after the chattanooga shooting and it was ours there was no comment
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.920]  whatsoever from the white house and you can go on the white house twitter and see the timeline on
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:28.400]  this they released this huge statement brach and michelle basically lecturing americans about how they
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:35.360]  need to respect islam before they even commented on the shooting or paid tribute to the marines
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:41.040]  and you can go and look in the response to the to the tweet by the white house people were absolutely
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:48.320]  furious at this obviously this is all the direct this brand of islam cuts the heads off gaze they
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:55.120]  would cut obama's head off helary's a lesbian they chop her head off i mean it's insane he so we
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:00.640]  should respect people that that were that that are mad that he goes to bath houses but if this state
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.440]  if this statement was released in a vacuum fine but somebody had to make that decision obviously it
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.400]  wasn't obama but somebody at the white house had to make that decision to release a statement about
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:16.320]  how great islam is i think it was literally an hour or less before they commented on the dead
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.600]  marines and you can go in the comments of this tweet and people are apoplectic about this i'm
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:25.200]  surprised it hasn't got more attention it's meant to rub it in it's it's meant to break our will
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.560]  yeah it almost seems deliberate i mean it almost seems there is just a little insanity
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:36.160]  they're all about optics up there this is a victory letter to the islamist saying i am here good job
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:41.760]  run ops run ops now bring in my boyfriend you know it's i mean that's what this is insane
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:48.640]  and of course the other aspect is you know you look at garland texas uh numerous responsible
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:55.680]  people with guns you look at this military recruitment center a gun-free zone so again
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:00.960]  they're not going to be able to exploit this for gun control propaganda simply because of that fact
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:05.840]  but i mean yeah this story about obama releasing this statement or the white house releasing it
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:12.720]  from my family to yours eed mubarak basically celebrating the end of ramadan which has been
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:18.640]  characterized by muslim terror attacks across the world with dozens and dozens of people dead
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:23.440]  that's how they like to celebrate ramadan so the headline should be obama celebrates shooting
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.000]  and terror attacks worldwide and ships being blown up uh with a celebration saying submit to the will
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:35.040]  it's it's almost that bad and the reaction was so intense i'm so i'm surprised this isn't a biggest
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:40.720]  scandal already well no i mean they'll probably have salon call out i mean they've already called
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.480]  for me to be shut down on the air they'll probably call for me to be taken to saudi arabian beheaded
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:50.400]  and then for my daughters to be delivered to al qaeda for mutilation i mean that's what's liberal
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.720]  paul and i'm not kidding i mean it's just it's so liberal that you know have a bag over your head
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:02.240]  thank you paul in the wake of the chattanooga shooting here's what we now know the gunman
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:07.440]  muhammad yusef abdelziz blatantly disregarded the no firearms sticker placed on the front of the
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:13.600]  recruitment office that's right people he knew where to go and where to find unarmed victims
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.080]  second it's now come out that he's made numerous trips to the middle east and his father was even
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:23.360]  being investigated by the fbi for possible ties to foreign terrorist organizations this harkens
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:28.000]  back to the boston bombing where the fbi had investigated and even interviewed one of the
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.560]  bombers and his mother but then claimed not to know who he was when they showed pictures at a press
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:38.400]  conference third our own president took time to issue a tweet wishing people a happy ramadan and
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:43.280]  this is after the shootings took place it was only after he lectured us on respecting the muslim faith
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:48.240]  that he actually took time to issue a statement on the four dead marines twitter was in an uproar
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.480]  over this action and you can read the tweets in the article obama honors islam before dead
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:58.400]  marine killed by islamic terrorist americans furious rob do reporting for info wars nightly news

[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:18.960]  cnn asked why would mohammed yosef abdulaziz carry out this attack g because he was a nice
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:27.040] est follower and said he was doing it for a la cnn had the headline all muslims are to blame
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:34.400]  for this attack like you said all white people are to blame for the charleston shooting i don't
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.760]  blame all muslims for this but our governments all over the west are bringing in groups of radical
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:46.720]  muslims and then saying we've got to submit to all of their ways while separately submitting
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:56.560]  to the most radical homosexual agenda that is it loggerheads with the muslims it's a broken
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:02.320]  tower of babel is what they want and they've now announced they're going to use the attack
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:07.200]  for a new domestic homeland security group to go after extremists before they commit crimes
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:10.800]  and they admit oh we're not worried about muslims they're not going to say this was a muslim terror
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:18.880]  attack now they're saying he was it connected to muslims g g again is a bear in the woods i mean
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:29.680]  it's just g is the sun yellow i mean you know g is obama a traitor i don't want to get called
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:37.680]  names i i better not say anything bad about radical islam and then the big story is up on
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:46.720]  info wars dot com obama honors islam before dead marines killed by islamic terrorist americans
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:52.160]  furious he waited hours and hours after it was known he was a radical islamist and the rest of it
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:10:00.800]  to issue a bizarre end of ramadan statement praising islam and saying that americans need to be tolerant
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:09.440]  i mean this is bizarre but it's all the clash of civilizations and again
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.720]  they say you can't have the name mother or father on government documents it's eight fuller boy or
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:19.600]  girl uh you got a band the confederate flag that had nothing to do with slaver but whatever
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:27.600]  take down mount rushmore well then deport the muslims ban their symbols and i'm not saying do that
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:35.920]  but this is the logic of where this is going and i don't particularly like the host of
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:43.280]  real time bill marr on a lot of his gun issues and things but where he is consistent as a liberal
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:48.080]  being hey let's be you know libertarian people can do what they want sexually whatever
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.360]  live the way you want as long as you don't hurt somebody else then he goes but radical islam is
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:59.840]  taking over islam and is super dangerous and why won't we say it all the rest of the left will not
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:07.280]  go there they will not go there and it's it's dangerous i mean it radical islamists are not
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:14.320]  compatible with the west and when you get sworn as a citizen can you guys give me the oath of
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:18.640]  citizenship because i never had to take it because i was born here because some of the best people
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.320]  out there immigrant some of the hardest working coolest people from all over the world very race
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.160]  color creed religion i know a lot of muslims went to college and i still with the really nice people
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:34.400]  very you know friendly smart hard-working folks but that's not who's taking over via saudi arabia
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:41.520]  and then now 15 years after the fake war on terror there's hundreds of thousands of these jihadis
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.240]  they're recruiting in the middle of a global depression now i had daughters of rome coursey
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:52.160]  he was a top financial analyst he's a consultant the largest banks in the world not just a
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:59.920]  three-time number one new york times bestseller and he said we're going into a global depression
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.160]  he believes by the winner that's a and he's been coming on for a decade or more he's never made
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:10.400]  bold predictions like that so many other guests are saying this is it chef has been very accurate
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:15.200]  in his previous predictions i think he might have predicted some stock market problems a
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:21.520]  little early but who could imagine it could keep getting this big so i want to get into that with
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:25.360]  him till about 40 after then i'm going to give the number out and take your calls on the shooting
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:34.160]  and give you the latest on that front but peter schiff is with euro pack dot com and he manages
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:39.920]  billions successfully he also is host of the peter schiff shows a frequent guest on foxy and ms mbc
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:45.280]  you name it uh and this transmission and he ran for the senate in 2010 he was ron paul's chief
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:52.960]  presidential advisor on economics in his first campaign as well and he's a school he's a proponent
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:57.280]  of the austrian school of economics which is i would just call the theory of economic reality
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:02.800]  it's prima facia or on its face peter i don't really get into politics a lot but you're a smart
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:10.000]  guy i want your take on we can't say we're boys and girls we're purple penguins i'm not kidding
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.040]  in public schools because it's hurtful to be a boring girl for somebody that doesn't know what
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.600]  they are and we're going to ban the confederate flag and blow up mount rushmore and you know all
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:24.400]  this political correctness but no one can criticize radical islamists that have now had multiple attacks
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:29.920]  inside the u.s. attack you know blew up a ship yesterday in the Mediterranean are just running
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.800]  wild and obama puts out a bizarre congratulation before he even says anything about the dead
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:40.080]  marines what is going on here in your view well you know it's all about political correctness it's
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:45.440]  about form over substance i mean we don't want to address the real issues or the real problems
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.040]  so we want to talk in sound bites about things that you know make us feel good about ourselves
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:56.320]  or you know tug at the heartstrings and and so i i think there's a political agenda here at work
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:02.960]  it's a lot uh stronger than the need for uh you know national security or anything that would actually
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:07.840]  help the u.s. economy in the long run it's more about uh making us feel good in the short run
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:12.640]  we can pretend everything is okay now i know you're down in Puerto Rico right now investigating
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:17.440]  they're saying it's the next shoot a drop do you agree with that and what's your takes as we talked
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:23.200]  two weeks ago about what's happened since you were a china's degenerating things are getting worse
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.360]  that's what you were predicting others were predicting what do you see happening i don't
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.920]  know if it's a shoot a drop i think it's a problem and i think it's a it's a look into our future
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:37.840]  because Puerto Rico has borrowed a lot of money we've encouraged that uh by enticing all the debt by
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:43.040]  making it triple tax-free in the united states you know we made it tax-free to invest in the
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:47.840]  government but not in the private sector so what we did with Puerto Rico is we helped them grow the
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:53.120]  government not the private sector and that's to the detriment of Puerto Rico meanwhile we enticed
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:57.840]  all their residents under the welfare roles we made it very difficult for people to get jobs
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:02.800]  by subjecting them to a minimum wage that is effectively double what it is in the u.s mainland
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:09.600]  so we wiped out entry-level jobs only 40 of the population is employed wow press live on welfare
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:14.000]  so you know we've we've hurt this economy tremendously with all these liberal you know
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:20.560]  programs that are being prescribed for the united states and look at how sick that medicine made
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:28.320]  Puerto Rico why would we want to do it here it's crazy where do you see all this going what's your
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:33.440]  take on the china situation a lot of predictions about smart people that this winner is going to
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:39.680]  be hellish on markets uh bond markets you name it i mean give us your analysis of that well i'm
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.560]  most people are optimistic i think on the market certainly the u.s market i don't i don't share that
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.160]  i don't think the market's going to collapse though because i don't think the federal reserve
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.720]  will allow it to collapse i don't believe that the federal reserve is going to raise interest
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:57.760]  rights like everybody thinks in fact if you look at the testimony of janet yelling this week she
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:03.040]  testified up on capitol hill all the headlines were about how she's about to raise rates how she
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.920]  reaffirms that the fed's going to raise rates this year that helped the dollar that sent bold
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:12.720]  to a new low for the year but if you actually look at what she said she didn't say she was going to
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:19.280]  raise rates all she said was that if the economy evolves the way they expect which is a big if
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:23.120]  because it never evolves the way they expect they would say that for two years if it gets
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:26.720]  better they're going to raise them yeah but they didn't even say they're going to raise them all
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:33.040]  she said is if the economy evolves as they expect it may be appropriate to raise rates not that it
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:38.160]  will be appropriate but that it might be and even if it is appropriate to raise them that doesn't
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:42.160]  mean the fed will raise them i mean the fed could say well it's appropriate but we're not going to
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.640]  do it because we don't want to i mean it's been appropriate to raise rates for years and they
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:51.600]  haven't done it in fact it wasn't appropriate to lower than the zero this is not about propriety
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:57.280]  this is about experience and i think the fed will keep interest rates at zero regardless of what's
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:05.280]  appropriate now i always ask the questions when you come on but but but what's on your radar screen
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:10.560]  economically what's peter schiff looking at right now both positive and negative
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:16.880]  look i just look in in amazement at how many people can be fooled by this gigantic bubble and it's
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:23.360]  almost as if the bigger the bubble the fewer people can see it because in my mind this is worse
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:28.640]  than the bubble that led to the financial crisis of 2008 it's certainly worse than the bubble that
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:35.120]  led to this dot com debacle in 2000 2001 yet everybody is so sanguine everybody thinks the
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:40.080]  osa economy is a great shape they think janet yellen did a great job just like they thought alan
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:46.560]  greenspan did a great job he did a disastrous job we live through the 2008 financial crisis that was
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:52.400]  the payback for what the mistakes that greenspan made except there wasn't payback enough because
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:57.760]  ben bernacky and now janet yellen came in to delay the full day of reckoning we still haven't
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:03.040]  really dealt with all the consequences because we've postponed them with more quantitative
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:08.080]  easing more zero percent interest rates but i think the economic crisis that we're heading for the
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:14.640]  currency crisis is going to dwarf as far as the economic pain for average americans and investors
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:24.560]  than anything that happened in 2000 or 2008 wow what do you expect the politicians to do when
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:31.600]  that happens blame capitalism you know blame a lack of regulation blame the speculators who knows
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:36.160]  they're going to point the finger everywhere but at themselves but hopefully because the talk shows
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:41.600]  like yours uh enough information will get out there that more people will know to blame the
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:46.880]  government to blame the bankers and the politicians for these problems because capitalism didn't
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:51.520]  cause them had we had capitalism we wouldn't have the problems it's government interference with
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:59.280]  capitalism that is the cause of all these problems now we're going to go to break and come back i've
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:04.160]  got a bunch of economic questions i want to go over with you but what are some of the other big
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.960]  things on your radar you're going to cover well look at the economic data that keeps coming out
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:15.360]  look at personal uh spending numbers that came out horrible uh this week and again we keep getting
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:20.720]  more and more bad economic data and everybody just the glosses over it as if it never even came out
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:25.920]  or they just dismiss it and they just assume it's going to get better based on what based on hope
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:30.560]  just based on jenny yellow saying she thinks the economy is going to improve i mean who cares what
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:35.040]  she thinks she's never been right and even if she thought the economy was going to get worse
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:40.720]  that's the last thing she's doing but she does look like a cave creature from that movie the descent
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:46.240]  so she can get a job in uh in in in hollywood i mean sarcastic we come back also want to look at
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.240]  greece and how they voted but then it didn't matter the government went ahead and handed over the
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:55.920]  resources sure greece is insolvent but what about the big mega banks too aren't they the biggest
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:03.520]  welfare heads out there we've all heard the news stories another shooting and they're getting

[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:32.400]  anybody so it's just a bunch of confusion and craziness but i go out there and see the real
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:39.680]  economy it's in trouble and then i see cash controls capital controls 50 billion and in
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:47.760]  in assets being handed over to especially germany and then i see the american people signed on to
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:53.280]  the big banks that are too big to fail that's my concern peter schiff from euro pacific capital
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:25:01.680]  dot com my concern is that what about all the corporate welfare how do we stop that again
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:08.240]  euro pack dot com's your website how do we how do we educate people about this alliance between
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:14.400]  crony capitalist and socialist lawmakers to domesticate us because it seems like when the
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:18.400]  next crisis comes they're just going to bring us deeper into the same thing that got us here
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:23.920]  yeah you know in some of the biggest recipients of the corporate welfare are the big donors to
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:31.200]  the democrats i mean they make a big deal about about how they you know want to redistribute wealth
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:36.720]  or how they want more equality but they are giving a lot of money to politicians to prevent that
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:41.680]  from happening at least when it comes to preserving some of their corporate welfare or some of their
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.960]  special tax breaks that most people don't get and what we have to do is take the power away from
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:51.280]  washington so they can't dole out special treatment to their friends they need to treat everybody
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:56.400]  equally i'd like to abolish the income tax entirely and everybody will be on a level playing field
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:02.560]  and let's just have a small government that operates based on excise taxes you just mentioned
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:07.200]  consumer prices and real income and i noticed that we got the cpi today which of course is the
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:11.840]  government's version which is you know really uh doesn't tell a whole story but even if you accept
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:17.040]  their numbers uh june consumer prices were up three tenths of a percent and if you look at the
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:22.240]  annualized uh real wages you you alluded to that real what wage growth now is at the slowest it's
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:27.200]  been in seven months and it's not like it's been pretty fast during the past seven months but if
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:32.800]  janet yon is looking for you know the economy to evolve the way she expects that's not what's
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:37.040]  happening in fact even the housing starts numbers that came out today the news is talking about
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:42.080]  oh you know we beat the estimates but if you actually look at the numbers there was a drop
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:47.040]  in single family home construction the only reason we had all these housing starts is because of
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:51.920]  apartments and and the reason that we're building somebody apartments is because the renters are too
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.800]  poor to buy but you have all these cheap money sloshing around wall street looking for a return
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:01.360]  and so they're building all these rental units but if the fed actually raised interest rates
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:05.440]  you'd see a collapse in that market and i think they're over building the rental market
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:10.160]  because the bad news is not only can't people afford to buy they can't even afford to rent
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:16.560]  and so they bring more unskilled third world labor in who then immediately get signed up for
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:23.680]  welfare that just sounds like a disastrous combination yep us and you know we had other
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:27.680]  numbers out we had the philly fed you know they were all excited because there was a bounce in
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:33.360]  june well it plunged back down in july and the employment component of the philly fed that was
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:38.240]  the lowest expense since january even the uh weekly unemployment claims that came out on
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:44.480]  thursday the moving average now is now the highest in in three months so everything seems to be
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:49.360]  going the other direction industrial production came out i mean it's year over year we just got
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:55.360]  industrial production for june it's the slowest increase year over year since february 2010
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:01.360]  and auto production collapsed five and a half percent in june which is probably a good sign
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:06.880]  that that automobile bubble is popping you know we have a big bubble in subprime auto lending
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:11.040]  and so that could be coming to an end as well and if the fed were to raise interest rates it would
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:19.680]  only hasten the demise of that bubble peter if you were president what would you do to try to
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:24.800]  restore our country with greatness i mean i think donald trump's saying a lot of things that i agree
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:31.840]  with uh but he's not giving a lot of specifics yeah well i'd probably have to wake up from my dream
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.680]  because i that's probably my only chance of being president is somehow if i dreamt it
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:40.560]  but you know if there was any way i could be president i'm assuming i'd have a sympathetic
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:44.480]  congress in there with me because anybody that would vote petership president i'm assuming they're
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:50.080]  voting uh for the right guys in congress so we could do a lot in fact even if i was president
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:55.360]  somehow if you just stuck me in the oval office with the current congress there's a lot i could do
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:00.160]  with my veto pet probably the most important thing i would do is i would i would veto every single
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:04.880]  bill that congress passed including raising the debt ceiling and any attempt to get around that
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:09.680]  to try to force the government to cut spending and i know president obama has accomplished a lot to
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:14.400]  grow government uh through executive order i would try to do whatever i could to shrink and
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:20.000]  abolish government agencies and departments through the same executive order so i try to do a lot
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.280]  to disrupt the government and free up sure i mean i mean we could also say if ryan paul got
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.520]  elected major treasurer secretary what would you advise the president to do so let's come back and
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:36.720]  walk through more of that because it's these ideas set up as the solution that will be out there juxtaposed
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:43.200]  against the policy now that we know is making a tiny group ultra rich making everybody else poor
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:52.320]  we'll be back with peter schiff stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run alex
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:30:02.160]  jones and the gcn radio network jade helm kicked off wednesday and the establishment media went
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:07.600]  with the angle that it's just the conspiracy nuts thinking marshal law is imminent but what they won't
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:14.560]  explain about jade helm and what we exposed months ago is mastering the human domain in military
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:20.800]  terminology the human domain or human domain analytics refers to the global understanding
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:26.400]  of anything associated with people mastering the human domain means obtaining total information
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:32.880]  awareness on a mass scale this means who you are what you do who you know and any other contextual

[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:43.840]  about the shooting yesterday and the political correctness where the media even though the guys of
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:50.800]  muslim clearly did it uh as a jihad attack they won't even say it was for a muslim extremist
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:57.680]  reasons and obama won't call it muslim terrorism i mean if a christian went in and boosted up
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:02.880]  saying they were a christian to be called christian terrorism but all whites were blamed by msnbc
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:08.160]  salon and others saying all whites are to blame that was the headlines uh for the degenerate
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:16.240]  shooter i am not to blame how dare you and i don't think muslims should be blamed in general
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:20.240]  most muslims in this country that i know and have run into and the studies i've seen
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:24.640]  just want to make money and be happy and live in a free country and you know if they moved here and
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:30.800]  were sworn in as citizens they read this oath that i'm gonna be reading so uh if you're not following
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:35.600]  your oath uh you know it it means something and hey you know if you are radical muslim want to live
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:40.000]  in a dirt floor deal and rape women and put bags on their heads and sexually mutilate people and
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.320]  you know blow up churches and stuff go to one of your hellholes and do it but see our government
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:52.080]  blamed iraq for 9 11 took them out and now radicals have been put in and the country's been divided
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:56.720]  in three effectively so america was wrong to do that and i apologize i tried to stop it so
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:02.160]  to peter schiff said iran paul but still i will say as an american i'm sorry to iraq but i will not
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:06.400]  sit here and watch our government fund isis running around committing stuff and then act like they
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:12.400]  don't know what's happening and and and and i am very angry right now and we're going to be talking
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:19.600]  about that uh peter schiff is our guest mcdonald's franchises have never been uh this depressed and
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:25.200]  again i see that as people voting with their dollars not that the economy's so bad people
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:29.040]  can't afford mcdonald's i think that's part of it as schiff has said but the other part is people
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:35.120]  are trying to buy healthier food by the way we're not going to announce this till next hour our facebook
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:41.520]  has been suspended and then we made a few phone calls and noticed that other libertarian sites
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:47.920]  were suspended um not expelled not shut down but if you get three of them in a year they shut you
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:55.280]  down they've been giving them to us for just nothing and uh we think it's clearly for criticizing
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:00.800]  the shooter but we're trying to ferret it out right now and doing some testing but uh i'm not
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:05.760]  going to apologize for saying the guy was wrong to shoot the former range i know i'm racist and bad
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:10.960]  it's like a liberal sacrament to blow a marine's head off when they're unarmed i get it you're
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:16.880]  the good guys i'm the bad guy and everything but you're sick freaks and zuckerberg's a sick freak
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:23.920]  peter schiff uropack.net peter you got about seven minutes left i know you got to go i appreciate
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:30.160]  you coming on um i consider and ask my economic questions all day the greece situation any more
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:35.920]  on that uh what else are you looking at and then what's some good news well before i even mentioned
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:39.920]  greece as long as you're talking about mcdonald's and restaurant sales you know we and the retail
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:46.320]  sales numbers that came out this week we actually had a drop in restaurant bar sales by 0.2 that's
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:53.360]  the biggest decline since january of 2014 and you know the problem is you know uh college grads need
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:57.200]  to vibrant their restaurant business because that's that's where they get their jobs you know you
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:01.200]  you graduate from college and then you can land a job at mcdonald's and so that's going to be
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:08.080]  problematic for our you know our college grads um but as far as greece is concerned unfortunately
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:12.800]  right greece is going to make a deal with the devil they're going to stay in the eurozone
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:17.200]  but they're going to borrow even more money to do it so the greek people are going to go deeper
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:21.760]  into debt because the greek government didn't want to deal with the consequences of abandoning
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:27.520]  socialism you see they need europe's money to continue to make payments to greek voters even
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:33.040]  if they have to deliver some bad news and tell uh you know greek pensioners and government workers
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:37.040]  that they're going to have to take some cuts they would have to take much bigger cuts if they
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:42.160]  actually left the eurozone but that would actually be a good thing because what we need is less
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:47.120]  government in greece and more freedom instead they're going to agree to higher taxes they're
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:51.760]  going to continue to keep people on the dole and ultimately there's going to be some kind of violent
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:59.040]  revolution in greece because this is not going to work uh what's going on is this about western
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:03.840]  governments in the robber baron class living for the day and and and just robbing the bank
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:08.000]  trying to build their armored redoubt you know in some faraway place as they're now doing
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.800]  headed for the exits but there really isn't a big conspiracy they kind of had a big global
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:18.240]  government talk to to to act like they had an exit plan but really their exit plan is the collapse
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:23.280]  of civilization with all the stealing and the socialism and the redistribution because they
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:28.880]  never back off the socialism or the or the corporate welfare they seem to only double down
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:33.760]  and if you study history i mean i was reading yesterday the london telegraph and also uh
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:39.920]  in several other papers they they say roam is a rotting festering rat hole now just 10 years ago
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:44.960]  it was nice other mega cities are falling apart i was back in new york recently it looked like
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:51.040]  a third world country it was looked nice 10 years ago i go to la it looks scary except in
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:56.720]  certain areas i go to dalas i grew up there it looks scary what is going on yeah well first
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:01.760]  you know it was a mistake for the european countries to have come together in a union it was
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:06.000]  you know because of politicians that wanted more power that they sold it to the people
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.520]  uh but it wasn't a good deal uh not because it's forced it's preventing greece from printing more
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:16.480]  money right the problem is it's putting all these countries together is just growing the
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:22.240]  government and i know germany couldn't afford to allow the moral hazard of forgiving the greek debt
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:26.880]  so they have to keep them in there just so they can send a message uh to everybody else but you
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:32.240]  know it was a mistake now looking back for our states to have come together you know the 12
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:36.640]  initial colonies you know given where we are today we would be better off had they never
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:41.920]  formed a central government and had they stayed uh independent states uh maybe had we operated under
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:47.040]  the articles of confederation instead of the constitution because what the original framers
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:52.720]  intended was a very small federal government with very little power that would only tax us in times
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:58.000]  of war and it would only deal with disputes between the states yeah and now we have an all
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:03.520]  powerful federal government i think most states would be better off just seceding from the union
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:07.520]  if the average state would be better off if he wasn't part of the united states if it was a separate
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:12.400]  country and it can operate with a lot less money but now we're stuck together in this very imperfect
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:18.960]  union well i agree with you and you know i've said we could have the states secede under the
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:26.080]  declaration of independence and then reform with a real limited federal government because we saw
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.160]  what happened last time they tried that there were some southern states that tried that and we had
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:34.640]  you know the civil war so it didn't work out so well and then as a result of the civil war we got
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:39.440]  paper money we got the income tax we got all kinds of other bad things but see you're a smart guy you
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:44.800]  know the real history of that nothing it had nothing to do with slavery until the end and
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:49.040]  two percent of the south had slaves it's a total red herring it was all about western expansion
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:53.760]  all about tariffs in the north on southern goods and then they just tell the public no it was about
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:59.040]  hating black people when in truth that's why uh robert e lee was the top general in the north
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:02.720]  the common daughter west point they wanted him to be the head of the northern forces
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:06.960]  and he said i don't want to do this but this is illegal what you're doing i have to go join
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:12.480]  the south and robert e lee hated slavery yeah i mean first of all i mean slavery was bad no
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:16.480]  question about it at least the one good thing that came out of the civil war was that it ended
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:21.600]  yes it would have ended anyway eventually but you know there was more racism in the north and
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:27.760]  there wasn't the south you know but the reality was that lincoln didn't free the slaves until the
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:33.120]  emancipation proclamation in 1863 we were two years into the war and the reason he did that
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:37.200]  was because france was threatening to come to the aid of the south and so lincoln had a
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:42.320]  making about slavery rather than about something else so it ended up that we got to free the
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:48.800]  slaves but that's not why the war started but again you're you read books you read history
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:53.680]  which makes you a racist uh yeah i'm being sarcastic because with the new political correctness
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:58.160]  they just trump our facts with just claiming we're racist we're right wing we're hateful
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:02.160]  i mean i don't think you call yourself right wing what do you call yourselves just a free market
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:06.960]  guy yeah look i would have loved it if thomas jefferson had had his way and the original
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:12.240]  declaration of independence emancipated the slaves but we wouldn't have had the document they had a
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:16.640]  cave in and you have just because i understand the true history of the civil war doesn't mean
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:22.800]  a pro-slavery no exactly horrible and the fact is it's bad economics that's why it was dying out
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:27.200]  all over the world there's only i think maybe one other nation in the world that's fought a war
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:32.240]  to end slavery every place else that had it you know it went away on its own and it would have
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:36.400]  gone away it might have taken another 20 years but you know we wouldn't have had jim pro we wouldn't
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:42.000]  have had a lot of the the problems and the animosity that existed following that civil war
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  uh and so i think ultimately this the descendants of slaves would have been much better off had
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.400]  we not fought that war they would be free today uh but i think and the nation would have we would
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:58.000]  have saved millions of lives the economic damage that resulted from that war was horrific and the
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:03.040]  government used the war to usurp all sorts of powers i mean i think if we never fought that
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:07.120]  civil war we wouldn't have the ecotact today we might not have the federal reserve we might
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:11.840]  still be on a gold standard and we wouldn't have any slaves so we'd all be a lot freer
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:16.320]  well plus if they do the background most americans that came here of any color
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:22.560]  their ancestors came here after the civil war most white people have no connection to slavery
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:28.560]  and so it's it's just asinine well of course not and of course very few whites owned slaves
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:32.880]  in fact there were even some blacks that owned slaves so you know it wasn't like you know it
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:37.200]  was only white but look i don't want look it was a terrible thing slavery is the worst no no i
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:42.320]  totally agree that i mean the issue is we're here watching the country in deep trouble and this is
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:48.240]  still the biggest issue out there that they use as a diversion it is a diversion and you look look
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:53.040]  i'm jewish i mean you know there were there were jews that were enslaved at one point too but i'm
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:58.000]  not you know i don't i'm not owed anything as a result of it we have real economic problems and
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.800]  we have modern slavery so the Babylonians and the Egyptians don't owe you anything no we're all
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:07.760]  slave to the u.s. government the way i look at it this is one big giant plantation and the government
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:12.480]  takes half of everything i earn and then they try to control everything that i do you know the slave
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:18.160]  owner only got 10 of his slaves production so the u.s. government gets a lot more from me economically
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:23.200]  than any plantation owner got out of its slave that's right and so we have to we have to get rid
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:28.080]  of these chains you know we have to free ourselves emancipate ourselves from this current system and
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:32.560]  we have to go back to what the founders envisioned not just for us but for all the people
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:37.600]  of the united states black white sure whoever it is we all need to be free i agree peter schiff
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:45.680]  powerful point uh in 60 seconds closing how do we launch a peaceful global slave revolt worldwide
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:51.360]  to stand up and say we're paying 60 70 percent in france 80 90 percent to a bunch of corrupt
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:56.160]  government bureaucrats that are above the law and tax exempt in most cases that's the most
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:01.760]  incredible part about it is that we are truly slaves how do we become free again peter schiff
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:06.480]  you know i don't know i mean my dad tried it you know he's 87 years old and he's still in jail
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:11.280]  because he stood up for the constitution and and and wasn't paying by the way your dad is in prison
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:17.680]  for writing a book well writing books and advocating that people follow the law the way he sees it
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:22.560]  and and not pay taxes so you can't just stop paying unless you're willing to risk going to jail
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:27.680]  like my father i mean look we can vote we can vote for ran paul you know we can vote for people who
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:32.080]  profess to support the constitution and stand for liberties but it is very difficult and you
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:37.440]  know we've got an army of americans now who are beholden to the federal government they they they
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:42.400]  divvy up the loot that the government steals outvote us so it's very difficult you know we
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:47.680]  are enslaved by democracy you never and the founding fathers you know also didn't like democracy
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:53.440]  to save us from democracy by creating a republic but the republic has collapsed and we're living
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:57.680]  under the tyranny of democracy well let me show a forbes article about your dad erwin schiff who
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:01.920]  i was pretty good friends with intervening in person probably 15 times spoke on the lecture
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:07.840]  circuit with a really cool guy uh forbes headline ninth circuit rules 85 year old tax protester
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:11.920]  should stay in jail i followed your father's case closely obviously not as much as you but
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:16.480]  i remember it being in the los vegas review journal with a straight face they reported
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:22.400]  that the judge said okay i'm gonna you're not gonna go to prison don't put your book out anymore
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:27.680]  yeah and your dad said no you put the book out and went to president he's been in there how
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:32.880]  i mean that he is a political prisoner i'm your dad's a hero his book i think other than lolita
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:36.880]  it was like the only book that the government's ever banned his book the federal mafia you know
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:41.600]  if you haven't read his economic books you know they really influenced me i still have copies
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:46.400]  you know the biggest con kable malls i mean if anyone goes to you know my schiff radio
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:50.800]  dot com i have a bookstore there you can art you can order these books i don't have that many left
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:56.400]  but they're you know i got him in my garage but you know he really influenced my my economic
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:00.960]  way of thinking wow i didn't know you were selling these banned books how evil but let's put a minute
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:04.000]  two on your dad and i'll let you go because i never want to bring your dad it was i know it's
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:09.120]  private i should have asked you but you brought him up what a cool guy how much energy he's got
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:14.800]  how is he doing after a decade in prison look he's still alive most of his friends aren't you know
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:19.040]  none of his sisters are still alive you know it's a lot of people that haven't made it to 87 and
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:23.360]  you know he's relatively healthy i think he'd be in better shape if he was in a real hospital and not
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:27.520]  a government prison but he only has a couple years left in his sentence so hopefully he'll
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:32.400]  stay healthy long enough to get out so he can see his grandchildren and spend some time you know
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:38.160]  with his family you know before you know he meets his maker but you know he he really believed in
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:43.920]  what he did and it's unfortunate but you know the principles that he stood for they're they're
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:48.800]  vibrant they're it's still alive and in a lot of people's minds and you know a lot of the forecast
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:52.880]  that he made in his book the biggest con that's the one i you know i still sell that he wrote in
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:59.360]  1972 1973 all this stuff is coming true you know his book was very prescient but it was obviously
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:03.440]  very early because a lot of the things that he forecast are happening now much of this stuff
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:07.920]  happened later in the 1970s now your dad battled the federal reserve the new world order everything
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:13.520]  and uh he did it for gosh like your dad's been around 40 years and longer doing this
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:17.840]  and he's somebody we don't talk about in prison right now i remember reading the thing
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:23.840]  judge sentences seem to look long term for republishing book i mean that is just but meanwhile
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:29.920]  people can run around at shopping malls with ices flags uh incredible peter shiv euro pack.net
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:33.920]  look forward to talking to you again in two weeks sir and say hi to your dad next time you talk to him
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:39.440]  i will all right thank you yeah i mean i just forget his dad is a real live political prisoner
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:47.760]  ladies and gentlemen a real live political prisoner i mean go research it they tried to put
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:53.440]  he was here in studio two weeks ago or a week and a half ago they tried to put joe banister
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:49:00.240]  highly decorated seven years as a treasury agent armed treasury agent and he heard a radio show
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:05.120]  said the federal reserve's private the irs never got ratified the income tax he didn't believe it
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:09.920]  he set out to disprove it for two years found it was true went to his superiors and they said
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:15.760]  he said i'm gonna have to resign if you can't tell me this isn't true and they said listen
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:22.560]  the fact you even looked into this resign and then now his buddies call him and apologize and
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:28.720]  now all know it's true but they tried to put him in jail not once but twice in the last five years
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:36.240]  and he got jury trials and the juries would go out and tell the news it's like they proved his case
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:40.320]  and all he was doing was giving speeches as the cpa
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:47.840]  look how lowest learners trying to put everybody in prison and she didn't get in trouble i mean
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:54.160]  folks this is nazi or soviet level i mean this is chilling i just got chills so i'm saying chilling

[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:29.920]  you know my dad's dad was named jerry jones
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:36.160]  if i have another son i thought i might name him jerry jones but i think jerry jones with
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:44.560]  the cowboys has kind of ruined that people be like you're named after jerry jones no not that jerry jones
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:50.400]  i see i'm not big on naming sons after myself but after a grandfather i think it's pretty cool
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:52.560]  but then i'd have to
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:01.280]  i'd have to name a son clied because that was my mom's dad's name i don't know if clied sounds that
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:08.560]  modern old jerry read though he just died a few years ago you know i said i'd go to your phone
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:14.400]  calls but usually two hours on the show being so serious i start looking further afield to
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:21.920]  psychological distractions coming up i want to give the united states oath of allegiance
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:27.680]  that you have to give when you become a citizen and a lot of these people attacking us are not
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:32.960]  citizens and it's because they hate this country and i don't know why they'd want to come here
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:39.280]  to be in a liberal country and by liberal means just a lot of freedom that's what real liberalism is
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:44.000]  and then they want to get angry about it just you know i'm sorry not going to work so i want to
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.680]  go to your calls just briefly because i mentioned it um we do have a lot of specials running right

[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:58.240]  support in many ways garret in texas uh you're on the air go ahead uh yes alex uh i i actually
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:02.800]  have a couple of questions for you if you'd like to hit a few points but i'm a stranger call you're
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:08.720]  on the air right now okay excellent um well number one i wanted to talk about the economy and it seems
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:14.160]  like the major transition into the more unionized government it seems like it's going to go with
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:18.480]  north american first as we predicted although we already know that nafta's in place so it's kind of
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:24.400]  softly in place um it seems like to me the easiest way for it to be done when i talk to my parents
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:29.680]  people in the um in society i'm a waiter so i talk to a lot of people from all different kinds of
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:35.600]  backgrounds it seems to me that um it's going to be very easy for them to transition over to it and
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:41.600]  accept it if the dollar devaluates and really all the money in their bank accounts and all their
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:47.360]  retirement especially old folks who have you know have to rely on the the government for their
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:52.240]  retirement and other sources when all of that's worth nothing and the answer is we'll switch over
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:55.680]  to this new currency and that's the only way you're going to get your money back in yeah that's
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:59.920]  what they're going to do crash the global economy and steps bring in the new global currency you'll
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:05.120]  still have it localized but it'll be pegged to the new global str that is one of the main plans
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:09.360]  they're kicking around not saying that's what's going to happen but that's openly being debated by
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:16.800]  some very wicked cold-blooded scumbags right and so that seems like the the main facet as far as
[01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:21.040]  people not actually being able to fight against that because they've put so much into it already
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:27.600]  now i want to tie into the iran deal real quick if you'll let me um it seems to me and i got this
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:31.360]  idea actually from one of the guests that were on your show and i wanted to kind of bring it back

[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:37.120]  so the mayor of kansas city came out and celebrated the fact that the city is majority
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:42.240]  minority it's celebrated everywhere that whites are about to be the minority right as the left
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:49.280]  energizes minorities with racial hatred and the most popular name in london or in england period
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:54.800]  is now mohammed because europeans don't have children and then the liberals go please sexually
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:59.200]  mutilate me put a bag on my head radical muslims i love you basically don't criticize it
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:03.840]  but you know it's it's an honor to be shot by a radical islamist and alex jones is evil
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:10.320]  people want to be poor in a collapsed society because they've had it good so long they just
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:15.360]  lust to destroy themselves it's self-destructiveness okay garret i gotta get to other callers finish
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:22.320]  your other points real quick yet one about iran okay okay so iran it seems to me um that basically
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:28.960]  he made that deal just to kind of put on paper the hey if you do this then we have the excuse to
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:34.480]  attack and that's going to give israel the excuse to attack iran he knew he knows they're going to
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:39.280]  create nuclear weapons he knows that they probably already have a few it's not more than that that
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:43.440]  this is going to be the hey if you do this this gives us the excuse to attack in the moral high
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:49.920]  ground for the world now crossing over it seems that um they're escalating not in force into the
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:54.960]  american people that you normally see in movies that concern things like this but it seems to me
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:02:00.000]  that they're forcing more and escalating more in the propaganda aspect that's why it's getting so
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:06.080]  crazy just keep us paranoid and keep us going crazy over in fighting with the propaganda while
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:10.800]  in the meantime the economy is going to implode they're using all the stuff in the middle east
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:15.520]  to confine that region to get rid of anybody who could have been a threat any of the dictators
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:19.120]  over there that could have actually fought back then they're going to put them all on the central
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:24.080]  banking system unionize that area that's what they're imploding the EU and it's all tied together
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:27.440]  i'll let you get sure they're going to merge the middle east with the EU yeah that's part of the
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:32.640]  plan the points care i get to hear from you deon in illinois you're on the air go ahead
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:42.080]  hey alex have you read the book a day of rouse no uh it's a book about a coordinated
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:49.360]  coordinated isis attacks in the united states that occur in american highways and american
[02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:53.440]  schools well why are you being racist against it it's a sacrament of holy liberalness to have
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:56.880]  a radical muslim blow your head off you are you white you deserve it
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:04.400]  well uh well i'm concerned because of what happened in tennessee so i'm thinking this might
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:11.760]  be a beacon for a coordinated attack uh like in schools or highways there's going to be a big one
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:17.040]  coming on george solis is trying to finance a race war absolutely versus being sarcastic
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:21.760]  you know saying anybody deserves it it's just totally sick i mean are you seeing the left today
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:27.120]  paper over this and say it wasn't terrorism i mean it's just they're just completely sick
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:34.560]  yeah a local newspaper by me they're calling it a gunman when we know it was a domestic terrorism
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:40.720]  and they're gonna but they are setting up a domestic terrorism outfit but that's only for patriots
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:50.160]  i agree with you alex uh they're not labeling the terrorist uh domestic terrorism even the
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:55.840]  patriots the method that's that's the plan the on good to hear from you steve you're on the air go
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:04:04.160]  ahead hello yes sir go ahead oh okay he said there was another steve yeah uh good afternoon
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:11.040]  i called in to talk about war what you were talking about yesterday and specifically
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:15.920]  psychological warfare but before that i just want to say i think i've come up with a perfect
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:22.240]  solution to your dilemma with being demonized by the media and always attacked and misrepresented
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:28.880]  and you were talking about the banning well i suggest that we ban the name alex jones and
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:37.040]  change your name to what they want it to be which is alexa and matrix jones town that way you'll
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:43.600]  fall right in line with them you know they say you're promoting false information and tell us stay
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:49.200]  there yeah no i mean i could have an alternate character i could be alexis uh jones like the
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:56.320]  other guys queenie jenner whatever her name is its name is uh and then i could do that no i could
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:03.840]  in the wake of the chattanooga shooting here's what we now know the gunman muhammad yusef abdelziz
[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:08.480]  blatantly disregarded the no firearm sticker placed on the front of the recruitment office
[02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:14.720]  that's right people he knew where to go and where to find unarmed victims second it's now come out
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:19.360]  that he's made numerous trips to the middle east and his father was even being investigated by the
[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:24.240]  fbi for possible ties to foreign terrorist organizations this harkens back to the boston
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:29.600]  bombing where the fbi had investigated and even interviewed one of the bombers and his mother but
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:34.080]  then claimed not to know who he was when they showed pictures at a press conference third our
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:39.280]  own president took time to issue a tweet wishing people a happy ramadan and this is after the
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:43.840]  shootings took place it was only after he lectured us on respecting the muslim faith that he actually
[02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:49.040]  took time to issue a statement on the four dead marines twitter was in an uproar over this action
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:53.680]  and you can read the tweets in the article obama honors islam before dead marine killed by islamic

[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:23.840]  war things would be a heck of a lot easier if this is a dictatorship just so long as i'm the
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:30.720]  dictator that was george w bush in 2003 and obama basically has made the same statement
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:37.760]  two times that we know of well here's the info wars graphic made by curtain demo i believe on the
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:45.040]  front page of info wars dot com with an image of obama at the lectern and it says we have to get a
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:51.840]  debate going about the fact we're pretty much a dictatorship now even mainline constitutionalist
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:09:00.800]  lawyers and scholars on both sides say that alex jones i completed my quotes remember what i actually
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:08.000]  said i think hurt edited for brevity but that's a fact i mean we're pretty much a dictatorship
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:16.400]  now in europe even mainline articles are going is going into dictatorial modes and it's really
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:21.360]  scary because with that comes economic degradation and war corrupt governments always act the same
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:27.120]  look at this headline rome is on the verge of collapse and needs urgent repair leaders warn
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:29.440]  this is globalism
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:38.880]  now the headlines are on info wars dot com i'd ask you to send both these articles out to everybody
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:46.480]  you know one of them is alex jones calls for deportation of all muslims the other is obama
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:52.080]  honors islam before dead marines killed by islamic terrorist americans furious that's a good headline
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:58.320]  by paul but it's worse than that hours after we knew it was a radical islamist obama lectured
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:02.320]  americans to be tolerant of islam he means radical
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:10.160]  and didn't speak about the marines i mean this is the rubbing it in that you're going to take it
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:13.120]  you're going to take it you're going to be overwritten you're going to accept it
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:19.600]  because it's about mob lul now i want to race through some calls and finish up as we're going
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:23.120]  to have trekk Baldwin on hearing about four or five minutes for the balance of the hour
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:29.520]  pastor trekk Baldwin former head of the constitution party and he writes a syndicated column
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:35.840]  good friend of mine i wanted to get his take on his editorial he wrote about why we should
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:40.160]  raise the confederate flag and he's got some good points about that just illustrating what's not
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:44.320]  about what they say it is and a challenge to political correctness but then we're going to
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:49.200]  shift gears into shooting and radical islam i know there are a lot of muslims that aren't radical
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:57.520]  but what's driving islam today is a conquering spirit uh colonialism europe was almost colonized
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:04.480]  and taken over spain was um spaniards were blonde-haired blue-eyed germanic country
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:11.920]  in caesar's day um looked like the russell crone in gladiator though people said that got
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:20.240]  along a spanish oh that's what spanish actually looked like uh that was taken over by north africans
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:25.200]  and now the head of e u security last week said we should accept political islam and let it take
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:30.640]  over and she's not even a muslim so there's this weird leftist plan hey we'll just merge
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:36.000]  with radical islam in the middle east i mean this is just well napoleon converted to islam for a
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:42.480]  while this has been going on for a while to conquer and take stuff over the new pope will not talk about
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:50.320]  plant parent openly selling baby parts i mean where's the new pope on baby parts he won't even
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:56.240]  be against abortion now he wants world government i mean this is true apostasy and i'm no preacher but
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:04.480]  it's sick and and everybody's showing who they really are now so i'm gonna take a few calls
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:08.880]  and i'll go back to more calls after we've been talking to chuck some i want to finish up with
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:14.240]  steve uh in florida he was saying i should be politically correct and changed my name to a lexus
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:21.280]  jenner jones and now what are you getting out here steve well you know you just got to go with
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:26.800]  the flow alex you can't make waves because otherwise you're criticized and you know god forbid that
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:33.040]  that should be the case because you're standing up for what's right true you know but uh the main
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:38.000]  reason i called in you were talking about warfare yesterday and you know that we're continually
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:44.240]  subjected to psych warfare and i don't know if you've ever seen this you probably are aware
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:50.640]  there's a woman named capron collard griggs k griggs she was the wife of colonel george griggs
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:57.280]  who was the head of special operations and nato yeah i've never sat through all six hours or
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:03.680]  whatever it is um but her claiming that there was weird homosexual cult the military that's
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:08.880]  how they control people high up i don't know about the marines but i know congress the catholic
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:12.720]  church a lot of Protestant leaders uh the republican leadership democrats of certain
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:19.040]  extent as well um the democrats tend to be into like weird occult heterosexual orgies
[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:24.480]  republicans it's like occultism and and and homosexual activity but the democrats are into
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:29.920]  that big time as well they're just not closeted uh and i'm not saying every gay person or
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:35.120]  homosexuals involved in the occult i'm just saying what what this group does and it's just so bizarre
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:42.880]  skull and bones i mean they get in big pools of feces and urinate on each other i mean that's even in
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:50.880]  the movie uh the good shepherd produced and directed by um robert inero who gave speeches
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:56.240]  and said no this is based on what really goes on and folks have broken in repeatedly we knows
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:01.440]  what goes on it's a germanic death cult people then say oh alex says there's a germanic death
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:07.920]  cult runs the world no i did i've interviewed you know uh tony sutton and other people that
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:13.520]  weren't got the documents the daughter of a famous colon bones man uh charlotte is there be
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:19.200]  that's what it is is a germanic death cult so it's just a bunch of weirdo wizard death cults
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:23.680]  into every form of weirdness you can imagine uh and they're taking stuff over steve i appreciate
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:30.080]  your call i'm going to go back to uh matt in tennessee sherry in tennessee and texas omega in
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:36.800]  indiana steve and florida's up next when we go to calls because uh pastor chuck baldwin's
[02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:41.440]  talk show host in his own right so he can certainly uh ride shotgun with us after we've talked to him
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:46.720]  a while and take your questions and comments to both of us so we'll get to your calls but joining
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:52.160]  us now is pastor chuck baldwin chuck baldwin live as his website we can put his article up
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:58.000]  on screen that we posted at info wars last week uh paraphrasing i forget the exact headline but it
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:03.040]  was basically you know it's time to raise there it is the confederate flags the confederate flag
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:09.280]  needs to be raised not lower so we'll get him to break down what he's getting at from that perspective
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:16.320]  in a moment uh but before we go there i wanted to get his take on the chattanooga situation
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:22.480]  and the fascist fake left media bending over backwards to say this isn't connected to the
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:28.240]  religion of peace islam i've fired a major shot across the bow they're banning the
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:33.680]  name father and mother and the names boy and girl and husband and wife and california and
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:38.160]  oregon and other areas and saying that the fact that heterosexuals exist is hurtful
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:43.360]  and that christian churches need to be banned and that all whites are responsible for the
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:51.680]  wicked shooter at the church uh in charleston then then we should say all of islam's evil and
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:58.000]  and get rid of all their symbols uh and deport all muslims now i i'm actually not an islamophobe
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:03.440]  i was against those wars targeting non radical countries uh it was actually meant to radicalize
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:08.560]  and turn the middle east over to radicals in a secret deal with the globalist uh and uh
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:15.360]  saudi arabia so i've been against their whole program of just total wickedness uh but if we
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:22.480]  follow the logic of the fascistic left uh then and if salon another said that charleston church
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:28.320]  massacre the violence what america must answer for if whites are collectively guilty and uh
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:35.920]  and christians are for every crime going on well then pastor should we then say clearly
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:41.200]  we can say islam is calling for violence uh but i don't expect the left to pick that up
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:47.680]  why does the left in your view it's an undisputed love affair have a love affair with radical islam
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:53.440]  and why is obama overthrowing any non radical country uh that's working with the west or
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:59.040]  trying to not cause problems and who lets christians live in peace uh like syria uh
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:04.080]  saudi arabia of course is running that running the attack on egypt running the attack on libya
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:10.400]  uh running the attack on iraq the courage why is the left uh targeting targeting non radical
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:16.320]  muslims and what's your view of the situation well first of all thanks for letting me come on
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:20.800]  your show again it's good to talk to you as i thank you and i really appreciate what you're
[02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:26.080]  doing i think you're an allergy that you just made uh you know relative to two shootings
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:30.560]  and how that as a result of the first one the confeder flag has got to come down
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:36.960]  they're digging up the remains of the nathan bedford forest in memphis tennessee removing
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:42.400]  the the monument there they're you know making an effort to remove anything that is remotely
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:47.040]  considered confederate throughout the united states all as a result of the shooting that
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:52.320]  you referred to and then at the same time absolutely no response whatsoever in regards
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:59.280]  to the fact that this was obviously a radical muslim uh extremists who had personal vendettas
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:04.560]  against the united states and its military and yet there's no connection to that whatsoever no
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:10.560]  fallout no ramification you know there's no call in congress to remove all things islam
[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:15.760]  etc etc etc your analogy is perfect i you know i think we understand and that was the point
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:22.000]  of my column about the confeder flag was that this is not about the confeder flag this is not about
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:28.720]  you know the the slavery or the war between the states it's not about any of that it's about
[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:35.680]  expunging the principles upon which uh america was founded and upon which the confederate states
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:42.640]  of america was founded and that is the position of liberty and decentralized government and that's
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:47.760]  the thing that's been lost in this whole debate relative to confeder flag and the confederacy
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:55.600]  in general is that the war was fought over the centralization of power lincoln was a a unionist
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:19:01.440]  in the strictest form in other words he did not believe in a voluntary union jefferson and
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:07.520]  washington the founding fathers believed that we were a voluntary union of states and that was
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:13.520]  the predominant view until lincoln came along and his idea was no we are not a voluntary union we
[02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:19.680]  are a forced union you do not have the right to secede you must be forced to stay in the union
[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:24.000]  now you know i hear people say okay well that's true you know the states don't have the right
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:28.640]  to secede okay really well then that means that the colonies did not have the right to secede
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:36.960]  from great britain how can we laud independent stage july 4th 1776 and celebrate the declaration
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:42.080]  of independence from great britain which was nothing more than states or colonies seceding
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:46.480]  from great britain and that's what the declaration of independent states is our right
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:52.480]  and our duty and so i even have a states we go with the view of lincoln you're absolutely right
[02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:56.640]  and we're skipping this break go ahead yeah so and then turn around and say that the southern
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:01.920]  states did not have the right to secede in 1861 i mean either either both are right or both are
[02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:06.800]  wrong you can't have one right and one wrong another thing that's lost in this whole debate is that
[02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:13.920]  lincoln hated andrew jackson's anti central banking policy you remember andrew jackson was
[02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:19.200]  the last president that we had that really was willing to take on the central bankers
[02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:25.760]  and root him out you know i mean he just had a a a hatred against the whole central and they
[02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:32.000]  love to demonize him all day because he was so tough he was a runner in the first war and the
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:36.480]  war for independence his brother and mother died in a concentration camp his dad died working
[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:40.720]  himself to death i think it was in south carolina i've read several books on him i haven't spent
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:46.960]  years and then um he was he was wounded in all these battles defeated the british when he was a
[02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:52.400]  colonel uh was in all these dual shots stabbed over and over again i mean that guy they call him
[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:57.520]  old hickory because he was skinny but unbeatable andrew jackson was like just just probably even
[02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:02.720]  tougher than somebody like george washington that's why nobody even knows about him and yeah he did a
[02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:08.640]  lot of bad things in modern views because at that time the native americans by the hundreds of thousands
[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:14.160]  with modern weapons with the french would pour down out of canada through illinois
[02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:21.360]  and smash through uh the midwest killing tens of thousands a day whole cities were burned
[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:25.600]  we only see indian native american movies out west when they'd already been mopped up
[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:29.440]  and they were being mowed down and killed at wounded knee and stuff but the reason that was
[02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:36.400]  going on was because most those soldiers parents had been killed in indian wars where where almost
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:42.480]  everyone was killed but there's no movies about that no one even knows what went on or how much of
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:46.720]  jackson's family that he had left was killed i mean they just have he was just a fighter
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:51.120]  and and he was an american and he more than anybody is the reason we even have the country
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:57.360]  today go ahead sorry no no problem the the yeah jackson was the last president we had to fight
[02:21:57.360 --> 02:22:03.120]  the central bankers and he literally rooted them out as as much as he could and they despised him
[02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:08.720]  and they vowed to undo everything that he had done against them and by the time lincoln came along
[02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:14.160]  if you go back and read the speeches of lincoln before became president he was bold in his
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:20.080]  assessment that jack jackson had you know ruined the country and he was against the
[02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:24.560]  central national bankers and you know we had to we got to bring back that institution into the
[02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:29.360]  country and that was pretty much the platform of lincoln the platform of lincoln had really
[02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:35.920]  nothing to do with slavery in fact lincoln himself was was a racist to the nth degree
[02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:40.320]  and that's not just a uh i know i've read his letters and i haven't even gotten into it people
[02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:46.080]  are childlike i don't want to read it oh i know it but but it's a fact racist and he was a racist
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:52.480]  he he built it basically said that the uh the blacks were inferior to the whites they would
[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:57.600]  never achieve equality even if they were not slaves that the whites were the superior race
[02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:02.800]  he wanted to take all of the blacks and and and ship them all off to you know back back to europe
[02:23:02.800 --> 02:23:09.120]  or africa or someplace so he you know he he had a disdain against the black people himself
[02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:13.200]  and that's something that people don't have forgotten about ibrahim lincoln his whole
[02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:19.920]  platform was to is to bring about a forced union and to centralize the banking system
[02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:24.880]  yes but it is true just to throw in and that the abolitionists were christians in the republican
[02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:30.880]  party and did spearhead trying to get rid of uh slavery and their pressure by the end or the
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:36.400]  middle of the war finally got him to do it well virtually everyone in the country with the exception
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:41.360]  of a very few people saw the handwriting on the wall relative to slavery look look the other
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:48.800]  nations in europe and in south america like brazil and so forth had already ended slavery and here's
[02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:55.600]  the key word peacefully peacefully england was absolutely go ahead sorry yeah there wasn't
[02:23:55.600 --> 02:24:02.800]  there wasn't a shot fired there was no war they did it peacefully america could have done it peacefully
[02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:08.080]  the vast majority of the country north and south recognized that slavery was a dying institution
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:14.560]  farm machinery was coming into existence it wasn't economically feasible the cotton gin killed
[02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:22.320]  slavery it was not even economically feasible to continue slavery the farms and the plantations
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:27.200]  that would for some reason or other want to maintain slavery as a means of production
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:32.800]  of their crops etc would be losing money big time everybody knew it everybody knew the moral evil
[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:37.920]  of it they wanted to get rid of slavery let's remind everybody too to alex that it was the
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:45.120]  british empire that forced the colonies to accept slavery they wouldn't let us have a manufactured
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:52.560]  goods we could only have agrarian that's why people like uh washington hated them so much
[02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:56.560]  and and then people say thomas jefferson on slaves thomas jefferson put in the first declaration
[02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:01.760]  of independence to end it the people at his house were like his family and he was he was against the
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:07.680]  institution but he couldn't even get rid of it he tried to and then they invert that and say that
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:13.120]  thomas jefferson was a horrible racist yeah that that's such a distortion of of history and such a
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:18.720]  mischaracterization of thomas jefferson if these men most of our founding fathers at that point
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:24.080]  were involved in various abolitionist societies they were already involved in means by which
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:28.800]  slavery could be exterminated in our country in fact let's not forget that the that the trade
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:36.480]  of the trading of slaves ended in 1808 that whenever the constitution was drafted it did the
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:44.320]  article was was in place in it that the slave trade would end in 1808 and it did the slave
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:51.520]  trade ended there were no more trading of slaves after 1808 and all of the the flags that flew on
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:57.920]  the slave ships most of them were british they flew the union jack some were portuguese some
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:04.400]  were dutch some were spanish not one single slave ship flew the confederate flag to make that to make
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:10.800]  the war between the states primarily about slavery is the most mischaracterization of history that
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:17.200]  i can possibly think of well you're right and again it's this inversion of reality but it's
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:22.720]  like when they say the n r a is the new clan when the n r a on record was an anti-slavery
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:28.560]  institution and helped arm blacks in the south they just invert every reality and yeah there are a
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:33.280]  lot of racist and criminal motorcycle gangs and people that like the confederate flag because
[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:39.600]  it's a powerful symbol it's been picked up as a symbol of rebellion uh and but it wasn't really
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:45.120]  even about that it was about following the constitution to the greatest extent right i wish
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:50.000]  the south wouldn't have been manipulated into the war though as you know it almost happened
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.880]  during andrew jackson's period but he was able to stop it now let's not forget what the what the
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:27:01.600]  nature of the confederate flag is all about the confederate flag is designed around st andrew's
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:07.120]  cross let me just give a little history here about the flag the flag but you know it was not a racist
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:12.160]  flag it was not about bigotry and hatred and racism or anything such as that it was the st
[02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:18.800]  andrew's cross all right st andrew of course was the brother of simon peter the apostle of christ
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:28.720]  he was hung on an x shaped cross at about the age of 90 and as a result that x shaped flag
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:35.120]  was a symbol of of andrew the apostle of christ who was who was crucified on an x shaped cross
[02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:41.520]  andrew was the patron saint of russia he's the patron saint of scotland the the saint andrew's
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:49.120]  cross on the on the confederate battle flag was designed after the scottish flag and in honor of
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:57.920]  st andrew let's not forget that about 75 percent of the southerners in 1860 were of scotch or scotch
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:28:03.920]  irish descent they were largely scotch irish yeah that's where jackson came from as well
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:08.880]  and so that's why they when they when they designed the flag they designed it around
[02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:17.360]  the scottish flag and the st andrew's cross which of course is a picture of christ and that's why
[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:22.240]  you know for example years and years ago whenever men were not able to write their signatures and
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:28.160]  there was an x official document they put an x why did they put an x that was st andrew's cross
[02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:34.240]  they were saying i'm vowing under god that i'm signing this document this is me i'm taking
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:40.320]  a vow to god and that's why they put the x when people said mary x must you know or they wrote it
[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:47.520]  mary x must but what was the x the x was a was a meaning christ it was a symbol of of christ and
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:52.560]  the st andrew's cross so they were saying mary christmas you know there wasn't anything derogatory
[02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:58.240]  about that it was it was a respectful reflection of the st andrew's cross and a meaning a typical
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:29:04.320]  meaning of of christ so the history of this has nothing to do with racism nothing to a slavery
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:10.880]  nothing to do with bigotry and the whole essence here was we will not be dominated abraham lincoln
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:16.880]  co-authored a 13th amendment before the real 13th amendment that we know today was ever
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:22.880]  enacted after the war between the states they they co-authored lincoln and and three others
[02:29:23.520 --> 02:29:30.800]  a 13th amendment which would have forever codified into the constitution and permanently
[02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:36.320]  ensconced slavery now think about that abraham let's come back and finish with that and then go

[02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:40.160]  in there's how that snuck into the mix oh that's linard skinnerd of course the real linard skinnerd

[02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:50.320]  linard skinnerd but they can sure play the old stuff good uh we have pastor chuck baldwin joining
[02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:55.760]  us i want to go to phone calls for folks that have been patiently holding on a host of issues
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:02.000]  chuck baldwin live.com is where he can read some of his excellent commentaries but i wanted to briefly
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:08.880]  talk about the supreme court and the rulings we've been hearing i'm a libertarian pastor but i'm also
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:17.280]  a a a a a christian and i understand that there is an attempt at not tolerance but at conquering
[02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:23.040]  um the church and now they're saying hey don't preach the old testament like they do in europe
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:28.560]  or canada everything we said would come uh they're now saying we will teach your children what we want
[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:34.480]  we will have boys go in the girls bathroom it's just a an attempt to overthrow the natural order
[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:41.360]  an attack on the species and that's a fact and it fits into the larger globalist plan it's so
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:49.040]  diabolical it's it's not of this world i mean it just as an anthropologist or a sociologist
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:53.360]  looking at it scientifically if i was an alien species and i was in control of the leadership
[02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:58.800]  of the planet i would do all the things they're doing to break down society and destroy the
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:03.120]  species i mean i walk on the hike and bike trail and i see men and women with their kids
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:07.120]  and the men and the women working together and loving each other and it's just that great
[02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:12.720]  institution it's what mammals do it's what higher mammals do we're above the higher mammals
[02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:17.840]  obviously look at what we've done made the image of god but imagine if they said it's sexist that
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:22.960]  male killer whales just want female killer whales we need to teach baby killer whales that you know
[02:36:22.960 --> 02:36:28.080]  not to get milked from their mommy i mean you'd say you're trying to kill the species and the russians
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:33.920]  say they're trying to kill our species um but but then i'm not saying it's space aliens it's what the
[02:36:33.920 --> 02:36:39.840]  christians have said it's what revelation says how could where they would turn the family upside
[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:46.400]  down break up the family the pope's calling for world government carbon taxes it's biblical so
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:55.040]  either the bible's right or the globalists are using it as a blueprint now we all know the bible's
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:37:03.360]  correct but but and how is that so fantastical that we're on a planet in the middle of space
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:09.280]  with other dimensional entities that want to destroy god's creation and hate us that resonate
[02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:17.280]  with his dark force and that god wouldn't send someone to warn us and then the fact that all that
[02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:22.240]  information has come forward but then i look at how i've told people you've told people what was
[02:37:22.240 --> 02:37:27.760]  going to happen so much of it comes true they listen to us we again are a tiny reflection
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:34.800]  of what christ did telling people exactly what would come and i'm kind of all over the map here
[02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:39.440]  today it's just that it makes my faith get that much stronger not that i needed to get stronger
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:44.960]  but but but not just can being convinced but totally convicted that we're fighting an evil
[02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:49.520]  spiritual force that wants to just flat out kill us can you speak to that pastor and we'll go to
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:55.280]  some calls yeah no no question alex but let me let me put this try to give perspective on this
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:01.760]  let's put the blame where it really belongs the blame does not truly belong at the supreme court
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:09.120]  level or or any other tyrannical tyrannically inspired government churches exactly the pastors
[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:17.600]  and the churches are to blame look in 1954 the church committed spiritual adultery when it took
[02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:26.080]  the 501c3 nonprofit tax exempt status from the irs and at that point became a creature of the state
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:32.960]  it was no longer a church that part of the body of christ the bride of christ it's now a creature
[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:39.840]  of the state the church has been living in hordom with the state ever since 1954 for the most part
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:45.760]  very few exceptions and now it's beginning little goblin babies well yeah what do you expect to
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:50.960]  happen you know whenever you do when you when you get in bed with government and you give to
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:57.920]  government the authority that only god is supposed to have god is a jealous god and he's not going
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:04.400]  to let his bride sleep with the enemy without being without there being repercussion so what
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:10.400]  has happened i think with this decision this Hodges decision is basically inevitable it is the
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:16.240]  fruit of the church that got in bed with the government and and from that point onward once
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:25.040]  it got that 501c3 nonprofit tax exempt status it was neutered and and muted and made impotent
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:31.680]  you can't get pastors to talk about anything controversial they won't address any issue
[02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:38.160]  that might would offend someone or jeopardize their tax exempt status alex the church has been on the
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:48.320]  canvas comatose cold stone dead as far as speaking out and taking a stand for decades the result is
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:55.280]  the enemy has taken the field that the church has fled and into that vacuum comes you can't call
[02:39:55.280 --> 02:40:01.360]  yourself a boy or girl now in thousands of school districts you're a purple penguin and and i mean
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:06.560]  this is i mean who could imagine that this is a imagine a space cult you know like the heavens
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:10.720]  gate people that cut off their genitals imagine if they said we're gonna have heavens gate come in
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:16.480]  this week and teach you kids and you can't call yourselves boy or girls i mean this is this is
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:22.160]  cult level wacko aid okay but here's my question to the listeners right now not many of your
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:26.560]  listeners go to church not all of them of course but many of them do so my question to all these
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:31.680]  church attending listeners right now is okay we're going on three weeks or so since this Hodges
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:40.640]  decision how many of you have heard your pastor get up in the pulpit and say a word about this
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:46.240]  in your church how many of you have heard a word i would venture to say that the vast majority of
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:51.040]  the people that are listening to this conversation right now who went to church last sunday and the
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:57.600]  sunday before that have not heard a word about it from their pulpits the pastors are not willing to
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:02.960]  address it because they're afraid of losing their tax share latest and listen they're pulling crosses
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:10.720]  out of catholic churches methodist churches liberal baptist churches and actually putting uh
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:17.520]  you know uh husband and wife teams up there that all they do is push democratic party propaganda
[02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:22.720]  they're accelerating the coup and the church is going from being stone cold on the ground
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:29.600]  knocked out to now being a ringwraith uh like the supreme court nine that will put behind me on tv
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:36.720]  that are doing this i mean this is on and and and now they're saying band husband band wife
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:42.320]  band boy band girl notice none of this quenches the thirst of those that wish to overturn the
[02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:47.520]  basic biological system no it's not going to quench this or it's insatiable and this is just the
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:52.800]  beginning i mean right now where i live in montana which is you know i i i think it's a fantastic
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:58.080]  state and in many ways it's it's better than most but you know even here in my state the school
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:03.440]  district is is having meetings right now the factor having their final meeting in a couple of weeks
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:10.080]  uh making the decision on adding transgender curriculum in this into the schools and transgender
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:16.000]  bathrooms into the schools this is in montana i mean this is not new york this is not california
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:21.440]  this is montana but this is coming down from the federal department of education all of the school
[02:42:21.440 --> 02:42:25.760]  districts are going to be considering the same thing but the question is what are the pastors
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:32.400]  going to do look we have sat back as preachers for the last 50 years and said nothing you know we
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:38.240]  said nothing whenever the the freedom and the god-given duty of self-defense was made a a
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:44.000]  license by the government in 1968 we said virtually nothing when prayer in the bible reading were
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:49.840]  taken out of schools in 62 we said basically nothing whenever roe v wade was passed and and
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:55.200]  abortion on demand became the law of the land killing unborn babies under the law most pastors
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:43:00.800]  in church have said nothing you know whenever we started this police state uh in 2001 and the
[02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:06.400]  orwellians began to take over our our government in our state and it's been going on ever since
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:11.680]  2001 what did the pastor said about that our liberties are going constant surveillance we've
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:16.160]  lost our constitutional governor fourth amendment rights etc the pastors have sat back and said
[02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:22.960]  nothing alex the problem is the churches and the pastors of america have sat back and done nothing
[02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:27.840]  they're scared to death of losing their tax exempt status that the globalists have held
[02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:33.360]  that over their heads since 1954 and so now we are getting what we deserve the chickens have come
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:39.040]  home to root that's right and notice that right as all this happens the prosperity all of it is
[02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:45.760]  leaving us and all that is spreading is corruption and i can get being tolerant i don't hate anybody
[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:53.440]  but that's not what was being asked for this is a conquering this is a takeover this is this this
[02:43:53.440 --> 02:44:01.200]  this this is a alien attack i mean this is a satanic attack and i'm not even saying the people that
[02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:07.360]  are under this control themselves are bad people or or or in their hearts want to be bad but clearly
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:15.280]  you see it's a takeover it never stops there's never enough it is slavery to follow and do what
[02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:21.200]  these people are telling us they want and with the whole lifestyle system they're pushing that just
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:28.240]  comes with this in history when a society gets ready to collapse uh you know even uh you know
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:34.800]  lesbian feminists like camille paglia gets that i mean this is a historical fact that all of this
[02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:41.520]  comes with a collapse there's never been a civilization in the history of the world
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:50.640]  that has officially embraced promoted and legitimized uh the homosexual lifestyle that has
[02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:57.280]  survived that is simply a matter of historical record but in america i think for what what
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:02.400]  we're looking at here is twofold we're looking at a spiritual issue with the pastors and the
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:09.520]  churches unwilling to take a stand number two we're looking at the abolishment of our our
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:16.400]  fundamental rights under god including the right of conscience well this is saying you don't have
[02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:23.680]  the right to believe a certain way you must accept our belief system it's more than just
[02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:30.720]  okay we want equality that's not equality we demand that you submit your conscience to us
[02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:36.400]  that's a huge difference you know the american ideal has always been i may disagree with what you say
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:41.120]  but i'll fight to the death for your right to say it and and that has historically been what america
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:45.440]  is all about that's what the freedom of speech is all about it's what the freedom of association
[02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:51.680]  and so that's right about but nowadays the the these these the these tyrants of the lefties
[02:45:51.680 --> 02:45:59.360]  these people who want to invoke their uh ideology upon every area and facet of our lives are saying
[02:45:59.360 --> 02:46:04.640]  to us you don't have the right of conscience you don't have the right to believe it's not you can't
[02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:11.440]  say this or that you know one of these cnn reporters got up here just recently and and said well now
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:17.760]  since the supreme court decision what that means is judge napolitano cannot get on on on television
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:24.000]  say the things that he said in the past really a supreme court justice doesn't have the right to get
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:30.880]  on public television and and voice his opinion about a subject i mean well that's what this has
[02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:35.600]  come down to is how far this is gone they flipped from saying it was tolerance to going no we're
[02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:39.760]  taking over and we're going to arrest you for your speech i i want to take some phone calls
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:44.240]  with pastor chuck ball when they're all over the map sherry matt omega dennis josh will go to all
[02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:50.240]  of you thinking for holding sherry in texas you're up first on the subject of ban everything idea uh go
[02:46:50.240 --> 02:46:57.680]  ahead thank you alex yes in my opinion uh this all or nothing attitude it keeps coming up and it
[02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:04.880]  has for a long time now it's exploitation and and for a purpose though it's it's a way to take
[02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:10.960]  what was originally a good idea to take down one flag and use it against the people in order to
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:17.360]  rile them up and make them vulnerable to violence it's like pulling our strings it's pushing our
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:23.040]  buttons and pushing our buttons and yes we can be free and we can't we don't have to submit
[02:47:23.040 --> 02:47:31.120]  to be taken over we we can we can we can let things break down and come back if if we are aware
[02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:39.280]  this is all exploitation used against us and to stay away from any kind of knee jerk reaction
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:44.000]  and realize like it was wonderful guy named danie brinkley once said be the difference
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:49.120]  a love can make because there is something that i think they can never dictate against
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:54.960]  and that's our ability to share our abundance with one another and absolutely sherry because
[02:47:54.960 --> 02:48:00.560]  they want all of us fighting with each other so they exacerbate differences take away our basic
[02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:05.680]  rights and replace it with faux rights go ahead and finish your comment we should never forget
[02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:10.640]  where we came from the one thing that pushes my buttons the worst is that they took out the racial
[02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:16.880]  slurs in driving miss daisy the movie's driving miss daisy that the what those police said to miss
[02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:22.800]  daisy miss daisy and her chauffeur were at the very heart of what the whole movie was about
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:27.200]  and we must never forget no i hear you i hear you i appreciate your call yeah they're even
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:31.120]  removing historical things that did happen that were racist because it might be hurtful they're

[02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:11.600]  years ago i created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials
[02:53:11.600 --> 02:53:16.960]  started talking about issuing a national id card with a built-in radio chip called rfid i felt having
[02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:21.680]  to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy soon after it was also
[02:53:21.680 --> 02:53:26.560]  announced that credit cards debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even transit passes
[02:53:26.560 --> 02:53:31.520]  would all soon incorporate rfid it was then i formed id stronghold to share my inventions
[02:53:31.520 --> 02:53:36.160]  and blocking rfid signals with the world there are a lot of misconceptions out there today about

[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:17.680]  not just our facebook that's banning it it's all the other facebook's we've talked to other folks
[02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:23.200]  that have tried to post any comment on it uh this just shows how controlled zuckerberg and facebook
[02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:31.280]  are will continue to operate on facebook to reach the sheeple i want to go to omega in indiana
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:38.320]  uh and i want to go to matt in tennessee he's actually first and others uh but but pastor
[02:54:38.320 --> 02:54:45.120]  chuck baldwin what did you make of her just just enjoying i mean it's sickening to watch somebody
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:49.280]  talk about you know their mercedes men's and how it's the best in the world you know just to see
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:54.560]  the fact that they're worshiping it just for what it is but but but talk about baby parts like she's
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:54:59.600]  talking about cutlets of filet mignon and all the money they're going to get truly sickening
[02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:05.920]  yeah and the thing is we've been talking about this for a long time you know we you and i and
[02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:11.280]  others have been trying to warn the american people as to what was really going on relative to abortion
[02:55:11.280 --> 02:55:17.280]  and the industry that came into being as a result of it and the selling of body parts etc nobody would
[02:55:17.280 --> 02:55:22.880]  listen to us they all thought we were exaggerating etc but now we've got you know the evidence from
[02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:29.120]  the people involved themselves as you say bragging about it i think it just demonstrates how confident
[02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:36.240]  they are that they will not have repercussion in any shape manner or form to what they're doing and
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:42.800]  i think you know what the scripture says about the conscience being seared as with a hot iron i
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:50.240]  think these people have a seared conscience they no longer feel the basic human empathy okay i mean
[02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:55.920]  it's it's hard to imagine that somebody could stand up and brag about cutting up children
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:02.640]  and selling their body parts for profit and then they're on a pedestal because they're liberal
[02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:08.800]  and they support jenner because so that makes it all okay yeah again i think it's it just goes back
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:15.120]  to aid the seared conscience that they have and secondly the brazen boldness that they have that
[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:19.440]  this is not going to be uh there's not going to be ramifications for this this you know this is
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:27.200]  acceptable to society i mean so now we've gone from that to you know the the forced acceptance
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:35.040]  of a perverse lifestyle homosexuality legally officially in our country and now it's going to
[02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:42.320]  translate culturally into you know unisex bathrooms in our schools and and and transgender curriculum
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:47.360]  in the in the schools and well i mean even dave chappelle whose kids go to a rich you know liberal
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:52.720]  private school said that in the articles on info wars said he's tired of the lesbians that have
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:58.640]  kids they're bossing him around and make and trying to make all the men feel weird and like uh
[02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:05.040]  what's the exact quote he uses uh here uh and that he has to participate in their self image
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:11.680]  see he gets that it's their culture is aggressive taking him over yeah and let's let's remember
[02:57:11.680 --> 02:57:16.320]  this too i i want to i want to get this on the show before i leave out because it's important
[02:57:16.320 --> 02:57:25.840]  that we understand that marriage until the the mid to late 19 uh 1900s and early 20th century
[02:57:26.960 --> 02:57:32.800]  marriages were were never performed with a state license never i mean that in terms of western
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:37.840]  civilization almost you know 2 000 years of western civilization it's only been the last hundred
[02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:44.480]  in a few years it's an ancient human private ceremony of the species so old it goes back
[02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:49.360]  to the beginning of us being a true species under god's creation and that's why they want
[02:57:49.360 --> 02:57:56.960]  to destroy it well the point is is that the pastors have surrendered the authority of christ
[02:57:56.960 --> 02:58:04.080]  over marriage whenever they allowed the state to license marriage just like the roman 13 just like
[02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:09.040]  the 501c3 all of it absolutely and and that's the correlation that i make and that's what i'm
[02:58:09.040 --> 02:58:14.000]  making now in my presentations and in my speeches and sermons and everything i'm trying to show the
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:20.000]  correlation between the acceptance of the license of the 501c3 church categorization of
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:26.720]  non-profit status in 1954 and the accepting of the marriage license by the state a little bit
[02:58:26.720 --> 02:58:31.840]  earlier i think now that brings state dog my end of the church yeah i i've made the decision
[02:58:31.840 --> 02:58:37.760]  as fast or alex and i will not marry anyone heterosexual or homosexual if they have a state
[02:58:37.760 --> 02:58:43.600]  license great idea it needs christians need to take the back it's our institution first amendment
[02:58:43.600 --> 02:58:50.400]  you have no jurisdiction chuck balvin great job alex jones here to tell you about how you can

[02:59:53.120 --> 03:00:07.760]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[03:00:07.760 --> 03:00:16.160]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network we are back live breaking censorship news and it shows
[03:00:16.160 --> 03:00:22.320]  how covert it is and why zuckerberg goes to bill berg and is on such an inside track with the tpp
[03:00:22.320 --> 03:00:26.960]  with his pump and dump operations facebook anthony gutti already has the breaking report
[03:00:26.960 --> 03:00:32.160]  from info wars dot com this is really really disturbing stuff because for the first time
[03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:37.040]  that i'm aware of talking to some of the developer experts we talk to some of the seo people that
[03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:43.120]  have ties with google this is the most blatant attempt at censorship that i've ever seen from
[03:00:43.120 --> 03:00:49.440]  facebook because it's not just blocking all of info wars it's blocking one article on numerous
[03:00:49.440 --> 03:00:53.520]  platforms and so yesterday night and then we check with other people with their facebook
[03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:56.720]  so they can't do it either exactly so we're going to show you some images it's all on info
[03:00:56.720 --> 03:01:01.200]  wars dot com right now so there's an article that i wrote called this new bill could ban gmo
[03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:07.040]  labeling for good it's about hr 1599 it's been called the monsanto protection act on steroids
[03:01:07.040 --> 03:01:11.840]  and what it would do is it would literally ban gmo labeling in the united states and as you can see
[03:01:11.840 --> 03:01:17.360]  on screen if you're a radio listener i tried to share this article on facebook and i received an
[03:01:17.360 --> 03:01:22.880]  update that this message contains content has been blocked by our security systems and it says you
[03:01:22.880 --> 03:01:26.080]  know if you think this is a mistake let us know and i thought well this is a weird glitch because
[03:01:26.080 --> 03:01:30.720]  i'm not immediately going to say oh they're censoring me right so i kind of left it alone
[03:01:30.720 --> 03:01:34.880]  then i started getting about a hundred emails that it was blocked on facebook and then i heard
[03:01:34.880 --> 03:01:38.960]  from another major group march against monsanto which has millions of followers they couldn't
[03:01:38.960 --> 03:01:43.440]  share it tens of thousands people were not unable to share it and here's what the crazy part is
[03:01:43.440 --> 03:01:48.880]  so i'm going to show you this as well you try to share this article and you get this crazy thing a
[03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:55.280]  security check you know obviously they know that all these platforms are are free of viruses now
[03:01:55.280 --> 03:02:00.160]  they're playing along acting like you've done something just because they don't want americans
[03:02:00.160 --> 03:02:04.800]  to know about legislation exactly and you know what it's looking like is a lot of people are
[03:02:04.800 --> 03:02:11.040]  saying they were blocking tpp related articles this is now a per article blocking that's because
[03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:17.360]  the word is that's in tpp expanding gmo labeling so because it's connected to tpp with congress
[03:02:17.360 --> 03:02:21.840]  it's being killed right and to be clear this isn't just some glitch uh we've had everybody look into
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:25.520]  this develop i mean i know what i'm doing development wise too but we've had others look
[03:02:25.520 --> 03:02:30.480]  into this in the back end there's no errors there's no security issue there are no viruses and to make
[03:02:30.480 --> 03:02:35.360]  it even more clear it is blocked on info wars dot com as a feature story but you can share other
[03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:40.720]  feature stories this is 100 blacked out across the board and on other platforms too it is
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:45.840]  blacked out you cannot share this post we've tried everything we've tried changing the title the url
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:49.680]  it is blacked out it'll work for five minutes after we switch it out and then it'll be blocked again
[03:02:49.680 --> 03:02:54.080]  well the answer is everybody's going to take this live five minutes we'll put the video up
[03:02:55.360 --> 03:03:02.720]  and call it monsanto loves you and your family uh and or this video is not censored to see what
[03:03:02.720 --> 03:03:07.600]  they do or call it puppy dogs and kittens and then all we're doing is and then they're going to ban
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:11.760]  the video right but they're just testing what they can get away with it's pretty amazing
[03:03:12.480 --> 03:03:16.320]  it is amazing and it ties into some other the news that we've seen too in these past few weeks
[03:03:16.320 --> 03:03:20.720]  like swiss is this article apple mind control news is on the way where they feature what you're
[03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:24.560]  allowed to read and what you're not and then facebook changes news feed algorithm to affect
[03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:30.000]  media content social media giant admits post reach and referral traffic could potentially decline oh
[03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:35.840]  yeah the fix is in folks better not take info wars or drudge reporter world net daily for granted
