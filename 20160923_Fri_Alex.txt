[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  It's the final countdown, only 45 days left, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14.240 --> 00:21.360]  It's already Friday, the 23rd day of September, 2016 on your host Alex Jones, we have a massively
[00:21.360 --> 00:24.480]  jam-packed global transmission set up for you today.
[00:24.480 --> 00:27.000]  Please tell everybody you know to tune in, this is an information war.
[00:27.000 --> 00:35.520]  Without receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, it's Alex Jones.
[00:35.520 --> 00:39.160]  And it's the American people, the people of the world, waking up and taking action.
[00:39.160 --> 00:44.840]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this worldwide Friday edition.
[00:44.840 --> 00:51.360]  The top story up on DrudgeReport.com has been given directly to Drudge, three days ahead
[00:51.360 --> 00:57.720]  of the historic debate that may have more viewers in the Super Bowl, and that information
[00:57.720 --> 01:05.600]  is that she will not be allowed any breaks, no commercials, no breaks, 90 minutes straight.
[01:05.600 --> 01:08.520]  And we're going to be here actually taking the feed, licensing the feed, carrying the
[01:08.520 --> 01:13.600]  feed, not just analyzing it in live time, but basically carrying it with limited interruptions.
[01:13.600 --> 01:19.160]  But we'll give a live analysis before and after as well this Monday in FullWars.com
[01:19.160 --> 01:23.880]  for its last show, the medical doctors are piling on, Democratic doctors are piling
[01:23.880 --> 01:27.800]  on, Rand Paul, medical doctors come out and said that she looks like she's got serious
[01:27.800 --> 01:29.200]  neurological problems.
[01:29.200 --> 01:33.640]  As we've pointed out, the eye is not pointing the right direction, shows serious neurological
[01:33.640 --> 01:37.440]  problems, she wasn't doing this previously, now medical doctors are coming out and seeing
[01:37.440 --> 01:38.440]  that.
[01:38.440 --> 01:43.160]  I shot this video last night, I talked to people in the Democratic Party and also in law enforcement
[01:43.160 --> 01:46.800]  over the last few days, and they say the word is with the Democrats that if Hillary
[01:46.800 --> 01:52.120]  Clinton can't make this debate or has problems during it, the Democrats will force her out.
[01:52.120 --> 01:56.560]  So this is an incredibly historic time to be alive, it's the final countdown.
[01:56.560 --> 02:03.160]  Here is a very important report I filed last night on this subject.
[02:03.160 --> 02:09.520]  In mid-August, the Secret Service leaked exclusively to FullWars.com that Hillary Clinton was basically
[02:09.520 --> 02:14.280]  having convulsions every hour and falling down if they didn't keep her drugged up.
[02:14.280 --> 02:20.440]  It was at the RNC three and a half weeks ago when it kicked off that Joe Biggs and I and
[02:20.440 --> 02:25.000]  others were able to talk to the Secret Service quite a bit off record, and we were told that
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.000]  in the next month or so, get ready for some very powerful information concerning Hillary
[02:31.000 --> 02:32.000]  Clinton.
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.520]  We said more leaks, more emails, and they said no, dealing with her health.
[02:36.520 --> 02:40.720]  So yes, from the source that I was contacted by in the Secret Service, this gentleman came
[02:40.720 --> 02:46.600]  out and said that they know that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson's disease.
[02:46.600 --> 02:49.040]  Now think about that, that makes a lot of sense.
[02:49.040 --> 02:53.920]  The fact that she's had multiple concussions, we've seen these seizure-like symptoms from
[02:53.920 --> 02:59.520]  her where she starts uncontrollably twitching, and that could lead her to fall, which could
[02:59.520 --> 03:03.600]  give her those concussions, which has also led to the blood clots and so forth and so
[03:03.600 --> 03:04.600]  on.
[03:04.600 --> 03:07.800]  So it makes a lot of sense to see how this is starting to unfold.
[03:07.800 --> 03:12.560]  Even just three weeks later, on September 11th, Hillary Clinton collapsed.
[03:12.560 --> 03:17.840]  The media tried to cover it up, but an amateur photographer actually got the video.
[03:17.840 --> 03:25.000]  In the week after her collapse, the DNC met in New York, NDC, to decide who her potential
[03:25.000 --> 03:26.800]  replacement would be.
[03:26.800 --> 03:32.480]  Now, the word is that Hillary has cancelled any appearances through Monday and is only
[03:32.480 --> 03:38.240]  talking to people via satellite or Skype, no personal appearances.
[03:38.240 --> 03:42.840]  How will she stand up for 90 minutes against Donald Trump when she already had to come
[03:42.840 --> 03:46.680]  out late at one of the previous debates against other Democrats?
[03:46.680 --> 03:47.880]  Will she collapse?
[03:47.880 --> 03:49.480]  Will she have a coughing fit?
[03:49.480 --> 03:53.120]  Too much to say.
[03:53.120 --> 03:56.320]  Now that you have the background, here's the new information.
[03:56.320 --> 04:01.920]  Multiple high-level sources have confirmed to Infowars.com that if Hillary Clinton cannot
[04:01.920 --> 04:06.760]  make this debate on Monday, the schedule to be the biggest in history with 100 million
[04:06.760 --> 04:11.800]  viewers that the Democrats are going to try to force her to drop out of the race.
[04:11.800 --> 04:17.720]  She effectively is throwing in the towel if she can't take the field against Donald Trump.
[04:17.720 --> 04:22.760]  Everything is on the line in the countdown over the next four days.
[04:22.760 --> 04:30.280]  And Infowars.com will be covering the debate live, taking the feed before, during and after.
[04:30.280 --> 04:35.920]  Join us at Infowars.com forward slash show or download our new app that has video and
[04:35.920 --> 04:43.240]  live audio feeds, news alerts, you name it, at Infowars.com forward slash app, everyone.
[04:43.240 --> 04:46.920]  Not just Americans, but people across the world are on the edge of their seat.
[04:46.920 --> 04:52.160]  And Infowars is going to be chronicling what unfolds and giving you the inside scoop right
[04:52.160 --> 04:56.840]  through this debate and right through the 2016 historic election.
[04:56.840 --> 05:06.200]  Hillary didn't come to Charlotte, she didn't see what happened, instead of playing a calming
[05:06.200 --> 05:11.480]  role as a leader should, Hillary chose to act as a demagogue, inciting violence by
[05:11.480 --> 05:15.320]  her tweet, hurling racism charges like a Molotov cocktail.
[05:15.320 --> 05:20.440]  Hillary tweeted out, another unarmed black man was shot in a police incident.
[05:20.440 --> 05:21.440]  She called it intolerable.
[05:21.440 --> 05:25.280]  But a witness photographed the man with the gun, cooperating the police version of what
[05:25.280 --> 05:29.520]  happened, that he was armed and ignored repeated verbal commands to drop his handgun.
[05:29.520 --> 05:34.040]  Hillary saying an unarmed black man has been shot again was a dog whistle from black lives
[05:34.040 --> 05:35.800]  matter to get whitey.
[05:35.800 --> 05:39.080]  Even though it was a black cop who shot the black man, working for a black police chief
[05:39.080 --> 05:41.080]  in a city run by Democrats.
[05:41.080 --> 05:46.240]  Now we have seen fires, doors looted, white people dragged, beaten, begging for mercy.
[05:46.240 --> 05:51.440]  Yet even as these facts and photos emerge, Hillary refuses to walk back the statement
[05:51.440 --> 05:53.440]  or to try to calm the situation.
[05:53.440 --> 05:57.280]  Hillary, I guess rioters and looters are stronger together.
[05:57.280 --> 05:58.280]  One thing's for sure.
[05:58.280 --> 05:59.280]  They're with her.
[05:59.280 --> 06:01.560]  For info wars.com, I'm David Knight.
[06:01.560 --> 06:07.960]  We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce
[06:07.960 --> 06:11.280]  about a group you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[06:11.280 --> 06:14.720]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[06:14.720 --> 06:16.920]  it's very, very important.
[06:16.920 --> 06:23.040]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres,
[06:23.040 --> 06:25.800]  telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[06:25.800 --> 06:27.880]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[06:27.880 --> 06:32.200]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[06:32.200 --> 06:35.080]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[06:35.080 --> 06:36.760]  It works like an antioxidant.
[06:36.760 --> 06:39.560]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[06:39.560 --> 06:42.840]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[06:42.840 --> 06:43.880]  It's in powder form.
[06:43.880 --> 06:46.560]  We have so many five star reviews.
[06:46.560 --> 06:47.560]  I take this.
[06:47.560 --> 06:52.080]  This is this is the product that I take info wars life.com and the profit we make.
[06:52.080 --> 06:53.080]  We fight the global.

[07:01.960 --> 07:07.200]  years ago info wars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine
[07:07.200 --> 07:08.200]  conspiracy.
[07:08.200 --> 07:12.160]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[07:12.160 --> 07:17.360]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[07:17.360 --> 07:21.080]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family into the water.
[07:21.080 --> 07:26.680]  They took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened
[07:26.680 --> 07:30.920]  as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your
[07:30.920 --> 07:31.920]  family.
[07:31.920 --> 07:37.160]  Now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[07:37.160 --> 07:42.960]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[07:42.960 --> 07:44.600]  ever concerning iodine.
[07:44.600 --> 07:46.520]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[07:46.520 --> 07:50.800]  This is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to
[07:50.800 --> 07:52.840]  any optimum health regimen.
[07:52.840 --> 08:01.520]  Stock up on survival shield x2 today at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[08:01.520 --> 08:21.400]  It's Friday, September 23rd, 2016, only 45 days till the November 8th election, the final
[08:21.400 --> 08:22.400]  countdown.
[08:22.400 --> 08:36.080]  And we are live on your host Alex Jones, infowars.com and PrismPrize.com are our websites.
[08:36.080 --> 08:41.360]  All of our major third party platforms are under massive censorship attack and Paul Watson
[08:41.360 --> 08:44.840]  has had one of his viral videos shut down.
[08:44.840 --> 08:49.640]  YouTube is announcing that they are going to have socialist brigades of social justice
[08:49.640 --> 08:58.400]  warriors that they actually call hero brigades, military groups in the terminology they use
[08:58.400 --> 09:04.200]  who will swarm and complain about things and then your video will be shut down, you will
[09:04.200 --> 09:10.080]  be demonetized or you will be blocked as Paul Watson's latest viral video what really
[09:10.080 --> 09:15.320]  happened in Charlotte got hit with in the early morning hours today.
[09:15.320 --> 09:18.960]  And the reason that's important is they've announced their style of censorship.
[09:18.960 --> 09:24.760]  It's the Chinese style, it's where they have these communities that complain about you
[09:24.760 --> 09:30.040]  and have basically the certifications they're given, the more they tattle and then their
[09:30.040 --> 09:35.120]  vote counts three to five to ten times more than yours.
[09:35.120 --> 09:39.080]  But libertarians and patriots, we don't tend to go out and complain about things and try
[09:39.080 --> 09:41.280]  to pull down free speech, they do.
[09:41.280 --> 09:46.000]  So they also have that leg up on us as well.
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.480]  So this is the new model that Facebook and Twitter and YouTube are now officially launching
[09:51.480 --> 09:52.480]  today.
[09:52.480 --> 09:55.400]  Paul Watson has a story about it up on info wars.com.
[09:55.400 --> 10:03.760]  Here's another one, YouTube gamifies censorship, recruits army of trolls to mass flag videos
[10:03.760 --> 10:06.800]  and they're going to quote fight the trolls with their trolls and people are emailing
[10:06.800 --> 10:11.760]  Paul, emailing us saying we're going to get you, we're going to shut you down.
[10:11.760 --> 10:17.840]  But don't worry, the public schools allow them to put on the Satan Club for your children
[10:17.840 --> 10:18.840]  after school.
[10:18.840 --> 10:21.640]  Satan Club must be allowed to proceed.
[10:21.640 --> 10:27.360]  That's being reported on out of the Associated Press and others and we have more articles.
[10:27.360 --> 10:31.960]  George Soros is funding Ferguson protest, hopes to spur civil action.
[10:31.960 --> 10:38.240]  The Washington Times hundreds and millions more have been given and they now admit the
[10:38.240 --> 10:46.800]  police have gotten the numbers we have a report here 70% at least of the people in Charleston
[10:46.800 --> 10:51.960]  and the people in other areas of the country where we've seen these type of things unfolding
[10:51.960 --> 11:00.640]  in North Carolina and places like Ferguson and all over the nation.
[11:00.640 --> 11:03.680]  They are being brought in by outside groups.
[11:03.680 --> 11:09.640]  So every major city has these people being brought in, whether it's in Charlotte, North
[11:09.640 --> 11:14.800]  Carolina or whether it's in other areas and they're engaging in this type of activity
[11:14.800 --> 11:18.680]  to just stir everybody up and it doesn't matter if a black guy shoots a black protester, it's
[11:18.680 --> 11:20.160]  white people's fault.
[11:20.160 --> 11:25.320]  It doesn't matter if a black cop shoots a black guy that's got a gun in his hand, it's
[11:25.320 --> 11:27.120]  the white people's fault.
[11:27.120 --> 11:30.000]  But when it is a white person's fault, they get charged with manslaughter.
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.240]  The female police officer that shot the unarmed black man who had his hands up on video because
[11:36.240 --> 11:40.320]  she said she was, quote, scared, has been charged with manslaughter and I said two days
[11:40.320 --> 11:47.320]  ago and I said yesterday, looks like manslaughter to me and again I'm no prosecutor but if it
[11:47.320 --> 11:53.400]  isn't 100% intentional or you're scared or it's not premeditated, you get manslaughter.
[11:53.400 --> 11:56.360]  I think that's the minimum charge there and it's not that I'm out to get the police, it's
[11:56.360 --> 12:00.440]  just that this is a tough job, I know you get scared, bad things happen but you killed
[12:00.440 --> 12:06.680]  this guy and quite frankly, this type of stuff goes on where people get out of their car
[12:06.680 --> 12:09.680]  with their cell phone in their hand, the cop instinctively has been trained and shoots
[12:09.680 --> 12:14.120]  them and I think a lot of this training does save police officers lives but at the expense
[12:14.120 --> 12:19.240]  of you guys are like quick draw McGraw or something where before I could even blink,
[12:19.240 --> 12:23.320]  you got your guns out and then you're pulling triggers and I'm just sorry, you just can't
[12:23.320 --> 12:24.320]  do that.
[12:24.320 --> 12:26.440]  Is this the number one issue in the country?
[12:26.440 --> 12:33.800]  It's been made the number one issue in the country artificially but it's not statistically
[12:33.800 --> 12:36.760]  it's way down the line.
[12:36.760 --> 12:45.800]  Third night of protest in U.S. city amid heavy security, Charlotte, North Carolina, protesters
[12:45.800 --> 12:50.400]  took the streets for a third night in the city of Charlotte on Thursday amid heavy
[12:50.400 --> 12:54.800]  security aimed at preventing more clashes over the fatal police shooting of a black
[12:54.800 --> 12:55.800]  man.
[12:55.800 --> 12:59.680]  Why do they say he's a black man if you don't say it's a black guy that shot him?
[12:59.680 --> 13:03.040]  Hundreds marched to the city police station carrying signs saying stop killing us and
[13:03.040 --> 13:07.960]  resistance is beautiful but the atmosphere was far calmer than previous two nights.
[13:07.960 --> 13:12.880]  Joe Biggs got tear gas there when he was covering folks that had blocked a road and you know
[13:12.880 --> 13:19.800]  I'd say 60, 70% of the people out there are social justice warrior white people that are
[13:19.800 --> 13:24.000]  basically egging the whole thing on and just adding to all the mental illness and the insanity.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.560]  I see these signs saying white violence must stop.
[13:27.560 --> 13:32.920]  It'll always be some weird woman or some weird white guy and then some of them are getting
[13:32.920 --> 13:38.920]  beaten up though by the KKK style black gangs that just see white people and they beat them
[13:38.920 --> 13:39.920]  up.
[13:39.920 --> 13:43.200]  It doesn't matter how much you beg, how much you plead, how much you say you hate yourself,
[13:43.200 --> 13:46.360]  you're getting beat up, you're getting thrown in fires, you're getting you know drug out
[13:46.360 --> 13:50.040]  of the middle of the street, you're getting your tennis shoes stolen off of you because
[13:50.040 --> 13:55.800]  this is just criminals using this as an excuse to rob stores, rob cars, engage in these types
[13:55.800 --> 13:59.600]  of activities period.
[13:59.600 --> 14:04.960]  But Paul Watson puts probably his most powerful video out ever and by the way Paul Watson's
[14:04.960 --> 14:09.920]  videos end up getting aired on Michael Savage's show that reaches upwards of six, seven million
[14:09.920 --> 14:11.920]  people a day.
[14:11.920 --> 14:15.560]  His pieces get aired on radio stations all over the country not just here.
[14:15.560 --> 14:17.920]  My pieces do as well, our other reporters do.
[14:17.920 --> 14:21.520]  We're known in media that you can play our stuff copyright free, please play it.
[14:21.520 --> 14:23.360]  I just want to get the word out.
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.800]  And so this is a guy that is reaching with his average video, let's be conservative,
[14:27.800 --> 14:29.800]  four or five million people that we know of.
[14:29.800 --> 14:34.040]  I mean he routinely gets a million, two million, three million, four million, five million,
[14:34.040 --> 14:35.880]  six million, seven million.
[14:35.880 --> 14:39.720]  Paul has gotten 10 million views on some of his videos.
[14:39.720 --> 14:41.520]  His record video has 10 million.
[14:41.520 --> 14:45.280]  My record video has 50 million.
[14:45.280 --> 14:49.160]  My next record is 15 million just on one version of the Obama deception.
[14:49.160 --> 14:54.520]  But the point I'm getting at is mainstream media cannot compete with that and is dwarfed
[14:54.520 --> 14:56.560]  by it.
[14:56.560 --> 15:04.600]  So he puts up a video, the truth about Charlotte and what happens?
[15:04.600 --> 15:06.160]  Charlotte riots, what they're not telling you.
[15:06.160 --> 15:11.360]  On the website it's the truth about Charlotte and it gets 249,000 views, probably gonna
[15:11.360 --> 15:12.560]  get over a million.
[15:12.560 --> 15:17.200]  And boom, they won't let you look at it, they put a age restriction on it.
[15:17.200 --> 15:20.360]  This video may be inappropriate for some users, you gotta log in.
[15:20.360 --> 15:24.240]  That immediately, most people don't want to do that, it kills it.
[15:24.240 --> 15:28.160]  That's how you kill a video, that's how you censor it and there's nothing un-age-appropriate
[15:28.160 --> 15:29.160]  on it.
[15:29.160 --> 15:32.800]  This is all the same stuff on the news, but we show how they are conflicting with each
[15:32.800 --> 15:36.320]  other, how they're contradicting each other and the point I'm getting at here is I have
[15:36.320 --> 15:41.120]  a stack of news of massive censorship being announced.
[15:41.120 --> 15:48.000]  It's only against conservatives, it's only against libertarians, it's only against patriots.
[15:48.000 --> 15:54.080]  When you get thousands of, in many cases, racist black people out there randomly robbing
[15:54.080 --> 15:58.240]  and killing and looting with other criminal white people that just want to go out and
[15:58.240 --> 15:59.240]  break stuff.
[15:59.240 --> 16:03.680]  And you've got Rachel Maddow saying these people are peaceful, this is good, this is
[16:03.680 --> 16:08.840]  terrible and then never mentioning it was a black cop that's been highly decorated in
[16:08.840 --> 16:11.960]  his community and his community, I've been reading about him, loves him, he's done a
[16:11.960 --> 16:18.120]  lot of great stuff, community stuff for kids, he's got a lot of courage and there's a black
[16:18.120 --> 16:22.440]  guy with a big criminal record waving a gun around, they tackle him, he's got the gun
[16:22.440 --> 16:26.480]  in his hand, he won't let go of it, they say drop it, drop it, drop it, oh yeah let's
[16:26.480 --> 16:36.640]  play his brother, let's play this, I mean, I don't care, that's right, saying all white
[16:36.640 --> 16:40.280]  cops and all white people are devils, but it was a black guy who killed your brother,
[16:40.280 --> 16:45.080]  in fact, let's play that clip in its entirety right now because this is so important to
[16:45.080 --> 16:49.560]  understand ladies and gentlemen that I don't care if it's white trash or black trash, you
[16:49.560 --> 16:53.840]  know thugs when you're in a parking lot with your family, whether they're white or black,
[16:53.840 --> 16:58.320]  they are Hispanic, they've all got this thuggish, immature look, they're trying to scare you,
[16:58.320 --> 17:02.720]  they're you know, you got a problem, you want something, I mean, I grew up in Dallas around
[17:02.720 --> 17:07.160]  a bunch of trash, okay, and let me tell you, there was plenty of them in every color and
[17:07.160 --> 17:11.280]  I'm telling you, it's people that don't work, they're lazy, they're entitled, they think
[17:11.280 --> 17:16.840]  that you owe them something, I don't care what color they were, I could be out in the
[17:16.840 --> 17:23.480]  country at a Dairy Queen with a girlfriend and you'd see a truck of white trash pull
[17:23.480 --> 17:27.880]  up with four or five you know teenage guys in it and I'd say let's just get out of here
[17:27.880 --> 17:33.440]  and they'd come in smart mouthed people shooting their mouths off, if there were you know kind
[17:33.440 --> 17:37.360]  of some black thugs in the store, I saw stuff like that, they'd kind of get along with the
[17:37.360 --> 17:42.160]  white thugs and then oh but they saw one guy with a nice truck and a good looking girlfriend
[17:42.160 --> 17:46.280]  what are you doing punk, yeah you want something and back when I was younger I'd say listen
[17:46.280 --> 17:50.200]  let's go outside, I'm gonna rip your heads off, there's nothing worse than cowards like
[17:50.200 --> 17:55.200]  you and sometimes they went outside but I must understand I'm tough, I just you get
[17:55.200 --> 17:59.440]  four or five guys threatening me starts flipping some switches, I'm skipping this network break
[17:59.440 --> 18:03.680]  just like global government tyranny and forced inoculation flips my switch so I'm here on
[18:03.680 --> 18:08.400]  air fighting it and effectively fighting it with you because you've had your switch flipped
[18:08.400 --> 18:15.080]  but to watch a bunch of spoiled rotten social justice warrior trash of every male, I haven't
[18:15.080 --> 18:20.440]  seen really any Hispanics out at this latest thing in North Carolina but I mean there's
[18:20.440 --> 18:25.640]  a bunch of trashy people with their drawers hanging down you know do you know what 30-40
[18:25.640 --> 18:30.120]  years ago it meant if you had your drawers hanging down over your butt down below your
[18:30.120 --> 18:35.240]  butt it meant you were a punk and in prison that means a male person that operates as
[18:35.240 --> 18:40.520]  a female who gets passed around and usually gets HIV by the way I mean I'm just letting
[18:40.520 --> 18:47.160]  you know that MTV and the rappers and the culture as a joke sold you something the jail guard
[18:47.160 --> 18:50.680]  a freeway Rick Ross you know the guy that took the name of the real freeway Rick Ross
[18:50.680 --> 18:55.240]  he walks around with a big fat belly in his underwear sticking out and his pants down below
[18:55.240 --> 19:03.200]  as a joke on you to get your kids to dress like a sex slave in prison people think it's
[19:03.200 --> 19:09.800]  cool to walk around with sex slave outfits on with Gimp outfits on bring out the Gimp
[19:09.800 --> 19:14.920]  Gimp sleeping well you just got to wake him up now don't you let's go ahead and play
[19:14.920 --> 19:21.960]  the the punk thug brother saying all white people and all white cops are devils here
[19:21.960 --> 19:23.880]  it is I know guys is there anything we should
[19:23.880 --> 19:29.400]  know no we just know that all white people are f***ing devils it makes you hear that
[19:29.400 --> 19:34.440]  word all white cops are f***ing devils and white people
[19:37.800 --> 19:41.720]  now I've got to hand it to him I mean he's acting like a thug to me but his pants aren't
[19:41.720 --> 19:46.760]  hanging down over showing off the good so I'm gonna skip this break now it's only one
[19:46.760 --> 19:50.520]  today though no others are allowed to be skipped I'm gonna behave myself better that's a network
[19:50.520 --> 19:57.480]  break I can do it we've got all that going on meanwhile Tulsa cop who shot Terrence Crutcher
[19:57.480 --> 20:03.240]  charged with first-degree manslaughter and I understand she needs to be charged she clearly
[20:03.240 --> 20:07.800]  the evidence looks like she did just just killing out of fear that's exactly what the prosecutor
[20:07.800 --> 20:12.440]  says is that she panicked and was hysterical but still that's manslaughter just like Donald
[20:12.440 --> 20:17.160]  Trump said it yesterday just like I said two days ago you can clearly the common sense see
[20:17.160 --> 20:20.840]  this woman was scared and it's part of the hype probably is part of the racism
[20:21.480 --> 20:25.640]  that George Soros is invoking on both sides that you know there's a big black guy running
[20:25.640 --> 20:29.400]  around pissed off in the heat I'd be mad too your cars broke down the middle of the street
[20:29.400 --> 20:32.360]  that'll get you a little bit hysterical the middle of the highway when your car breaks down
[20:33.800 --> 20:36.920]  I mean I've had a broke down car before trying to change the tire and a cop pulls up says what
[20:36.920 --> 20:41.400]  are you doing and you know you just cut your finger and I'm like I'm fixing my tire okay whatever
[20:41.400 --> 20:45.080]  the point is I mean I've been rude to cops before they asked me what I'm doing fixing a car and I go
[20:45.080 --> 20:50.120]  what do you think I'm doing you know back when I was younger I've learned to control myself you
[20:50.120 --> 20:53.960]  know these days a little bit better but that's what he reportedly did she runs up he's like
[20:53.960 --> 20:57.640]  ignoring her trying to fix the car and she goes get your hands up and he goes okay I'm just trying
[20:57.640 --> 21:07.560]  to fix the car is she just shooting no criminal record happy father with kids just got executed but
[21:07.560 --> 21:13.480]  the point is statistically it's incredibly rare and the cop got indicted and they cop shoot white
[21:13.480 --> 21:18.200]  people too folks white cop shoot white people a black cop shoot black people just like we just saw
[21:18.200 --> 21:29.000]  unfold in Charlotte let me see this happen in so many other places now here's the big news I want
[21:29.000 --> 21:34.760]  to shift gears out of this for now and I want to get into the debate and the latest is up on
[21:34.760 --> 21:42.680]  drudgerport.com for posterity we are copying this article up to info wars.com as well debate rules
[21:42.680 --> 21:51.560]  no coughing breaks exclusive Friday September 23rd this broke at 11 30 and 40 seconds eastern time
[21:51.560 --> 21:57.640]  so little under an hour ago if presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton slips into a coughing fit
[21:57.640 --> 22:02.840]  or any other medical crisis during monday's high stakes debate she will have to power through the
[22:02.840 --> 22:06.680]  drudgerport is learned exclusively there are no commercial breaks a commission source explains
[22:06.680 --> 22:14.040]  period despite moderator lez holt does not have the authority to cut away from the stage during
[22:14.040 --> 22:17.320]  the epic 90-minute showdown that's set to have more viewers I should have in the Super Bowl
[22:18.360 --> 22:22.120]  and microphone audio for either of the candidates is not to be manipulated
[22:22.760 --> 22:27.160]  man finally a real debate this is awesome Clinton has experienced severe coughing episodes
[22:27.160 --> 22:30.600]  throughout her election year yeah her last appearance in public was on monday she had a
[22:30.600 --> 22:35.320]  coughing fit and just hadn't seen since she had a coughing fit at the end during a labor day campaign
[22:35.320 --> 22:39.800]  stops she suffered again a four-minute choking marathon and she was in a medical temper 45
[22:39.800 --> 22:45.000]  minutes before that we were there our reporters and the media did not pick that up monday's
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.200]  throwdown could top out at 100 million viewers making it the biggest political event in history
[22:50.200 --> 22:56.680]  and bigger than even the biggest tv show mash in this 1983 final final show I should add editors note
[22:56.680 --> 23:02.040]  the presidential debate commission settled an early flashpoint when clinton demanded a step stool
[23:02.040 --> 23:07.400]  at the podium so she can lean on it to add height to her 5-4 frame campaign chairman
[23:07.400 --> 23:12.760]  john podesta expressed concern that hillary would be dwarfed by 6-2 trump well that's just
[23:12.760 --> 23:17.080]  how it looks and go with reality the request was quickly rejected the commission is allowing
[23:17.080 --> 23:22.760]  for a custom-made podium which will accommodate the difference in stature so she'll have her little
[23:22.760 --> 23:29.080]  podium it'd be like if I went to a suit shop and said this suits for a 6-3 man I'm only 5-11 I demand
[23:29.080 --> 23:35.640]  you only have suits that are my size I mean it's just it's crazy absolutely crazy and we
[23:35.640 --> 23:40.040]  have ran paul this is on info wars dot com steve watson ran paul questions clinton's health says
[23:40.040 --> 23:45.240]  she could have neurological problems senator says americans don't buy dishonesty of hillary's
[23:45.240 --> 23:49.240]  pneumonia yes she's been sick far too long hillary clinton slam suggestions she needs
[23:49.240 --> 23:53.640]  neurological test despite bizarre video showing her eyes moving out of sync pointing the wrong
[23:53.640 --> 23:57.240]  directions doctors are now coming out saying when I said days ago it's common sense that's
[23:57.240 --> 24:02.040]  neurological problems I talked to medical doctors about it uh clinton's eyes a window into her health
[24:02.040 --> 24:06.920]  issues another article out of the hill breaking down it shows she's got serious problems voters
[24:06.920 --> 24:11.240]  think trump has more stamina than clinton that's like saying you think the north pole is colder than
[24:11.240 --> 24:18.520]  say Sri Lanka so a lot of that coming out we've got new polls showing an even bigger margin of
[24:18.520 --> 24:23.480]  victory for trump right now so will they stage false flags what are they going to do are they
[24:23.480 --> 24:27.560]  going to have sorrows intensify the black lives matter using any excuse they can to get riots
[24:27.560 --> 24:31.960]  going we know he's given hundreds of millions more the Ford Foundation gave a hundred million
[24:31.960 --> 24:37.160]  three weeks ago you're seeing the effects this is the destabilization program that's all coming up
[24:37.160 --> 24:43.880]  but first talking to our sources this is this is very very very important
[24:46.120 --> 24:51.080]  if hillary does drop out of this or has a bad showing and and has problems the democrats see
[24:51.080 --> 24:57.080]  this is her maker to break it point demarcation line they are going to pressure her to step down
[24:57.080 --> 25:00.680]  they've already been doing it asking her if she thinks it's a good idea but she does really run
[25:00.680 --> 25:06.040]  the democrats she is a puppet of the globalist but but in in power to a great extent but the word
[25:06.040 --> 25:11.720]  is if she doesn't make it she's 100 out the the dnc's going to move against her if she has problems
[25:11.720 --> 25:15.640]  they're going to really push her and the question is who's going to come in after that so the big
[25:15.640 --> 25:21.560]  secret of the trump versus hillary debate revealed it's another report i filed last night it's up on
[25:21.560 --> 25:26.280]  info wars dot com but let me add a point here they're trying to censor us and everybody else
[25:26.280 --> 25:30.760]  that promote liberty because they're losing the fight and they admit now they're coming in the
[25:30.760 --> 25:35.720]  censor if we take the giant audience we have and drudge has and a few other great outlets have
[25:35.720 --> 25:40.920]  and if everybody promotes those even harder and sends links and send stories and retweets drudges
[25:40.920 --> 25:46.520]  tweets and our tweets and and takes our videos and articles and gets them out to everybody we will
[25:46.520 --> 25:51.480]  break the back of the globalist and they will not be able to censor but if we self censor because
[25:51.480 --> 25:56.120]  they're going to start coming in and pressuring us and nudging us they're going to win now is the
[25:56.120 --> 26:01.000]  time for maximum effort send everyone you know the link to info wars dot com forward slash show
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.600]  for our live debate coverage and again this is going to be pretty much wall to wall we're not going
[26:06.600 --> 26:11.400]  to be interrupting and except during pauses we'll have analysis before for an hour and for two hours
[26:11.400 --> 26:17.160]  after that's coming up this monday just three days out it's historic spread that link info wars
[26:17.160 --> 26:24.120]  dot com forward slash show here is the special report it's almost here you can cut the tension
[26:24.120 --> 26:31.960]  with a knife the first real debate for 90 minutes head to head hosted a university in new york next
[26:31.960 --> 26:39.080]  monday at eight o'clock central until 9 30 central and info wars dot com we'll be covering it live
[26:39.080 --> 26:45.240]  on the scene and with our own feeds as well as live commentary and analysis at info wars dot
[26:45.240 --> 26:50.440]  com forward slash show a few weeks ago i made the point that this could be bigger than the super
[26:50.440 --> 26:55.800]  bull because the american people are really starting to wake up and guess what top media
[26:55.800 --> 27:01.240]  analysts have now come out and looked at the early numbers coming in and it appears there could be as
[27:01.240 --> 27:08.520]  many as 100 million viewers that has never happened in history and will be bigger than any tv show
[27:08.520 --> 27:15.000]  including the super bowl that the united states has ever broadcast but i wouldn't hold your breath
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.400]  something tells me there's less than a 50 50 chance hillary's gonna show up to this debate in fact
[27:21.400 --> 27:27.720]  she's only doing like one event a week and isn't doing any events now right through next monday
[27:27.720 --> 27:33.080]  that tells you how incredibly sick she is and as trump begins to surge in the polls
[27:33.080 --> 27:38.440]  you would expect her to be out on the street redoubling her efforts but she's not so even if she
[27:38.440 --> 27:43.960]  makes it to the debate next monday night how is she going to be able to stand up there for 90
[27:43.960 --> 27:51.560]  minutes so i wonder what the numbers are if i was a betting man on her collapsing or having a
[27:51.560 --> 27:58.120]  coughing fit and having to cut the debate short and don't forget there's precedence for this during
[27:58.120 --> 28:03.000]  one of the democrat debates they had to pause for like 10 minutes because she wouldn't come out
[28:03.000 --> 28:08.040]  after the quote commercial break ladies and gentlemen you talk about edge of your seat
[28:08.040 --> 28:12.120]  i don't care about sports and stuff like that because it doesn't matter it doesn't affect my life
[28:12.120 --> 28:17.160]  or my children's future but this does i'm proud to see the american people so excited about this
[28:17.160 --> 28:22.040]  debate and it's because we're finally getting somebody real to go up against the establishment
[28:22.040 --> 28:28.600]  represented by hillary clinton this isn't sports this is reality we're not just spectators watching
[28:28.600 --> 28:34.440]  some basketball or football game we're actually in the arena this is our country this is our world
[28:34.440 --> 28:40.120]  and the sleeping giant is awakening and info wars will be on the field at the event in new york

[30:03.560 --> 30:07.880]  clevenger has fallen under heavy scrutiny after two tweets he made thursday in response to the
[30:07.880 --> 30:12.040]  events in charlotte north carolina wednesday night but he went further than just the charlotte
[30:12.040 --> 30:16.920]  riots and said this black people beating whites when a thug got shot holding a gun by a black
[30:16.920 --> 30:22.600]  officer this cracks me up keep kneeling for the anthem regardless that what he tweeted is true he
[30:22.600 --> 30:29.640]  is white so he is racist and he must apologize he also tweeted blm is pathetic obama is pathetic
[30:29.640 --> 30:34.600]  everyone involved should be locked behind bars like animals now he is just sharing his opinion
[30:34.600 --> 30:39.800]  though i think the animals common is what triggered people but again he's not allowed that opinion
[30:39.800 --> 30:44.520]  because he's white you could actually read those tweets and they could come from a black person
[30:44.520 --> 30:50.360]  or a white person because there is no racism just objective fact and opinion don't worry though
[30:50.360 --> 30:56.040]  the seattle mariners are very disappointed this proves once again you're either with the left
[30:56.040 --> 31:02.760]  or you're a racist shut up be sure to download the new app at info wars dot com slash app not a group

[31:18.680 --> 31:24.600]  dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a
[31:24.600 --> 31:30.840]  host mechanism right now with all the refugees uh spreading disease around we have biological warfare

[32:50.280 --> 32:55.160]  to autofill visit info wars lives dot com to read the information and research and to see the
[32:55.160 --> 33:04.760]  reviews for yourselves that's info wars lives dot com or call 888-253-3139
[33:04.760 --> 33:14.360]  uh
[33:19.160 --> 33:26.680]  we now take you live to the central texas command center in the heart of the resistance it's alex
[33:26.680 --> 33:37.320]  john's now there's a way to get around the censorship once we've already embedded a video
[33:37.960 --> 33:45.000]  that they then block for being shared as long as you already had it embedded on your web page
[33:45.000 --> 33:50.680]  like info wars dot com it's still able to be seen we just can't share the video anymore
[33:50.680 --> 33:55.720]  without somebody logging in with credentials to youtube and again if a video had quarter million
[33:55.720 --> 34:00.680]  views in a couple hours that means it would have gotten over a million views maybe five million
[34:00.680 --> 34:05.560]  maybe ten million uh you never know but it was going for a million and then when it gets a million
[34:05.560 --> 34:11.400]  it gets picked up by national news and then it gets played by national radio shows let me just
[34:11.400 --> 34:15.240]  one example is michael savage plays poll watching stuff all the time he's welcome to
[34:15.240 --> 34:19.880]  like we asking to uh i mean i don't care if shon had a original inbaud did you can even
[34:19.880 --> 34:25.800]  cut info wars off of it not give us credit that's why we only say info wars visually at the end
[34:25.800 --> 34:29.880]  so that people that are in competition with us not so much savage but others don't have to clip
[34:29.880 --> 34:34.440]  us out because i don't want any credit i want to defeat the new world order they're coming with
[34:34.440 --> 34:39.400]  forced inoculations they're coming with our uh for our guns they're starting wars they're creating
[34:39.400 --> 34:46.360]  total racial division it's horrible uh they are forcing gmo food on us they are establishing a
[34:46.360 --> 34:51.320]  private corporate planetary government there's another washington post article out today and a
[34:51.320 --> 34:57.080]  financial times of london publication those are as elite as it gets for putting out propaganda
[34:57.960 --> 35:02.840]  financial times of london new york times washington post uh the economist
[35:04.520 --> 35:08.360]  all of them in the last few months write articles every few days but two are out today
[35:10.040 --> 35:14.280]  saying global government is in trouble the liberal world order is in trouble
[35:14.280 --> 35:17.880]  we've got to defeat trump we've got to prop up hillary we're in a crisis
[35:19.480 --> 35:23.080]  i know i've covered this a lot but they're back in the news saying it again
[35:23.080 --> 35:27.800]  and they're saying we've got to censor these people and youtube is upping the censorship so
[35:27.800 --> 35:32.680]  i want to play this video in a moment but listen people say well if they're censoring you so much
[35:32.680 --> 35:37.000]  get out of these electronic ghettos and matt drudge is absolutely right we've got to visit our own
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.320]  sites we've got to build our own video sites we've got to build our own news sites we've got to build
[35:41.320 --> 35:46.200]  our own tv networks i'm trying and when drudge says that and he's a smart guy he's not lecturing
[35:46.200 --> 35:51.080]  he's telling everybody don't support facebook don't support you know these platforms and and i get
[35:51.080 --> 35:55.160]  that but drudge is on twitter too we share his stuff on facebook what he's saying is
[35:55.720 --> 36:01.880]  and i agree do not rely on them i use them to get our information out but more and more
[36:01.880 --> 36:06.200]  remain censored and i've had to do stuff like file lawsuits and i don't want to get into the whole
[36:06.200 --> 36:12.120]  back story but there's a reason we're on facebook there's a reason we're on youtube they know i go
[36:12.120 --> 36:17.080]  get the heavy hitter lawyers and we start writing the letters and we go file the lawsuit and then
[36:17.080 --> 36:21.640]  suddenly the vice president of a company calls you up and here let's fix this because i'm gonna
[36:21.640 --> 36:25.320]  haul you in before a jury i'm gonna show you're violating your terms of use i'm gonna show you're
[36:25.320 --> 36:30.760]  letting people have killed donald trump facebook pages for two years and you know uh you know kill
[36:30.760 --> 36:37.320]  christian pages and and do all this and then we've got a site simply pointing out real information
[36:38.360 --> 36:43.880]  and you want to say it's racist it's hateful it's evil but now they want to be able to say oh
[36:43.880 --> 36:50.680]  to judges we have communities we had thousands of people say this paul joseph watson video was racist
[36:52.360 --> 37:00.120]  and so because they say so you lose your speech that's called democracy we're not a democracy
[37:00.120 --> 37:05.400]  we are a constitutional republic let me explain how this works to new listeners in a republic
[37:06.920 --> 37:12.520]  we have a representative democracy a limited democracy little l in a pure democracy if 51
[37:12.520 --> 37:22.680]  percent vote to kill the other 49 it happens or they at least try or if 51 votes that another
[37:22.680 --> 37:27.240]  group in the country let's say some minority group are no longer humans they actually had votes in
[37:27.240 --> 37:31.000]  this country back when they operated like a democracy it violated our republic people pointed
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.320]  that out that's why i got overturned later saying you know blacks are two-thirds so their votes count
[37:35.320 --> 37:40.760]  as two-thirds in apportionment to two states in the electoral college i mean this has been done before
[37:41.560 --> 37:46.840]  okay so this is the route we're going so when you hear the democrats and people pushing we're a
[37:46.840 --> 37:53.320]  democracy look out we have a bill of rights and constitution that says private property religious
[37:53.320 --> 37:58.600]  rights on and on and on is protected no matter what people vote or what people say and that's
[37:58.600 --> 38:03.720]  being overthrown right now and they are organizing themselves under leftist cover
[38:05.160 --> 38:09.960]  to absolutely censor and it's happening so what do you do you don't take our videos and
[38:09.960 --> 38:13.880]  our articles for granted and by the way you're not doing that thank you but you redouble your
[38:13.880 --> 38:18.680]  efforts sending them out to everybody reposting them putting them out start your own local radio
[38:18.680 --> 38:23.960]  show start an access show start your own youtube channel because they can't censor all of us we
[38:23.960 --> 38:29.240]  are winning we're taking action but they're trying because we're defeating them hillary told congress
[38:29.240 --> 38:35.800]  four years ago we're losing the info war close quote she came out three weeks ago and so we've
[38:35.800 --> 38:45.320]  got to shut down alex jones darkheart i mean that's amazing we've got to shut down the alt media
[38:45.320 --> 38:53.640]  bright bart has no right to exist and of course when they're saying that they know drudge is
[38:53.640 --> 39:00.440]  way more popular in our sites combined but drudge even has a more popular view with people
[39:01.160 --> 39:07.640]  and by popular he's even less polarized because he's so reclusive it's a stroke of genius and
[39:08.280 --> 39:11.800]  show that i mean in their internal reports and congressional hearings they say drudge drudge
[39:11.800 --> 39:15.480]  drudge drudge and the federal elections commission they say drudge drudge drudge drudge talk radio
[39:15.480 --> 39:19.720]  talk radio but then when they get ready to try to do it they go over two of the biggest
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.920]  organizations that are seen as bare knuckles like bright bart steven bannon and yours truly alex
[39:24.920 --> 39:31.480]  jones and paul watson they are after him so bad because let me explain something almost everyone
[39:31.480 --> 39:37.960]  i know that has high school and middle school students do you know who they watch every day
[39:37.960 --> 39:44.360]  day and i mean i go to people's plays i go to barbecues i don't even know people and and like
[39:44.360 --> 39:48.760]  you know some 14 year old walks over boy girl goes oh i watch paul watson i learned about
[39:48.760 --> 39:54.200]  you through paul watson or they say steven crowder or they say uh gavin mcginnis
[39:56.600 --> 40:02.280]  i mean ladies and gentlemen paul watson himself has tens of millions of people that watch him
[40:02.280 --> 40:08.920]  every week racial matter doesn't have that in the months so they want to shut us down okay and i
[40:08.920 --> 40:13.480]  explained to watson recently i said you're gonna just have to move here he wants to anyways not
[40:13.480 --> 40:17.640]  to be in a big studio with our lawyers with everything we've got you've got to go ahead to
[40:17.640 --> 40:21.800]  show folks you're not just at you know at your house with a map behind you you're doing a great
[40:21.800 --> 40:27.640]  job because when we go to court and things it won't be perceived as evil as it really is but if
[40:27.640 --> 40:32.360]  it's a major media organization in multi-million dollar studios we're gonna win and i've already
[40:32.360 --> 40:36.600]  been talking to all the lawyers i mean it's we have to get big or be destroyed we're already
[40:36.600 --> 40:41.000]  bigger than they are we have to finally act like we're bigger than they are because these arrogant
[40:41.000 --> 40:46.120]  crooks know we're killing them politically so they want to just sit here and wall sit and
[40:46.120 --> 40:51.800]  start shutting down talk radio and taking our sponsors and knocking people out and going after
[40:51.800 --> 40:57.480]  folks and infiltrating organizations and bringing down fox news when they brought down fox news
[40:57.480 --> 41:03.800]  two months ago i told you get ready okay i've got all this other news but the point is censorship
[41:03.800 --> 41:08.360]  here it's time to support the broadcast it's time to support our local m&f affiliates it's time to
[41:08.360 --> 41:13.720]  put up a billboard it's time to get aggressive trump made it okay to be politically incorrect
[41:13.720 --> 41:18.200]  and tell the truth everybody now is going through that wedge it's getting much larger we're beginning
[41:18.200 --> 41:24.520]  to win but the enemy is going to counter offensive so let's just redouble our efforts now everyone
[41:24.520 --> 41:29.560]  should go to info or store.com and look at the thousands of shortwave radios non-gmo seeds
[41:29.560 --> 41:36.120]  incredible books films molon lobby hillary for prison t-shirts come and take it the best lowest

[42:10.520 --> 42:16.360]  doing it they're cool folks because we're selling more than they do now but the point is is that

[42:23.480 --> 42:29.720]  of melatonin that we have in this is the same price with leading uh other high quality brands

[42:55.000 --> 43:01.480]  products are are are just so incredibly low priced uh and are total game changers because it's just

[43:06.760 --> 43:12.600]  just doesn't have filler for the same price as just the melatonin we do that's just an example
[43:12.600 --> 43:17.880]  of what we do folks info wars life dot com or info wars store dot com is the umbrella cider

[45:51.720 --> 45:55.640]  it's exciting it's fun i can feel the spirit of liberty rising and a big part of that is
[45:55.640 --> 46:01.080]  supporting the broadcast financially and getting great products you need it's a 360 win all right
[46:01.080 --> 46:07.720]  let's go ahead and go to paul watson's report it's up on info wars dot com the article is titled

[46:23.400 --> 46:27.480]  could be like sex if it's liberal you know and people naked and it's okay but none of that on this
[46:27.480 --> 46:32.920]  no cussing no nothing they still block it out but that's that kills it going viral but still you
[46:32.920 --> 46:37.560]  can share the page we have that it's embedded on so i'm going to retweet the censored video
[46:37.560 --> 46:42.280]  with the info wars page the next five minutes at real alex jones i'm going to repost it to facebook
[46:42.280 --> 46:46.760]  and point out it's being censored and we jump between censored platforms and censored platforms
[46:46.760 --> 46:53.400]  when youtube wouldn't let us show you the video of hillary falling down um sunday night we went
[46:53.400 --> 46:58.120]  and uploaded on facebook they got like five million views they panic and had to reinstate our videos
[46:58.120 --> 47:03.000]  we're hitting them and hitting them hard we're jumping like going across lava on rocks jumping
[47:03.000 --> 47:08.120]  jumping jumping like a cat you know and using their big you know enemy operations to get into the
[47:08.120 --> 47:12.200]  matrix and and wake people up uh let's go to paul watson's censored report here it is
[47:14.840 --> 47:20.120]  harmonious black lives matter activists staged a peaceful protest in charlotte last night but
[47:20.120 --> 47:26.440]  were brutally teargassed by racist cops oh wait a second physically attacking reporters is not a
[47:26.440 --> 47:33.160]  legitimate form of protest shooting each other is not a legitimate form of protest stealing and looting
[47:33.160 --> 47:39.720]  cash registers from local businesses is not a legitimate form of protest trying to set journalists
[47:39.720 --> 47:46.040]  on fire is not a legitimate form of protest throwing rocks off bridges at passing vehicles full of
[47:46.040 --> 47:53.640]  families is not a legitimate form of protest beating up innocent people in underground parking lots
[47:53.640 --> 47:58.840]  because they're white is not a legitimate form of protest smashing up apartment windows where
[47:58.840 --> 48:05.240]  black people live to protest in favor of black lives matter is not a legitimate form of protest
[48:05.240 --> 48:11.160]  smashing up buses that poor black people rely on to get to their jobs is not a legitimate form
[48:11.160 --> 48:16.600]  of protest looting the charlotte hornets team store so you can steal basketball merchandise
[48:16.600 --> 48:22.280]  is not a legitimate form of protest stealing sneakers is not a legitimate form of protest
[48:22.280 --> 48:28.440]  attempting to hijack cars and terrify their innocent occupants is not a legitimate form of protest
[48:28.440 --> 48:35.400]  but how did msnbc report on all this by calling the rioters peaceful the people that are out here
[48:35.400 --> 48:41.720]  protesting they're hugging and they're like they're being very peaceful we were following this crowd
[48:41.720 --> 48:47.720]  that was largely peaceful mostly peaceful we've also seen some sweet scenes of protesters uh
[48:47.720 --> 48:53.000]  hugging one another and praying mostly a group of peaceful protesters peaceful peaceful peaceful
[48:53.000 --> 48:59.080]  peaceful peaceful and that's why 94 percent of americans don't trust the mainstream media what's
[48:59.080 --> 49:07.560]  unfolding in charlotte is objectively manifestly provably not a protest it's a violent unjustified
[49:07.560 --> 49:15.080]  riot by criminals gang members and thugs why is the media giving it legitimacy by still
[49:15.080 --> 49:22.360]  referring to it as a protest if mobs of white supremacists were looting stores setting fires
[49:22.360 --> 49:29.400]  attacking journalists and shooting guns would the media call it a protest but maybe i'm wrong
[49:29.400 --> 49:35.320]  maybe all this was completely justified because another racist white police officer killed an
[49:35.320 --> 49:41.480]  innocent unarmed black man who was merely carrying a book oh wait he was actually killed by a black
[49:41.480 --> 49:48.040]  cop all white people are devils but what kind of book was he carrying paperback hardcover
[49:48.040 --> 49:54.600]  oh no it was a nine millimeter gun well imagine my shock so a black cop shoots an armed black
[49:54.600 --> 50:01.320]  thug with a criminal record and then a black protester shoots another black protester yeah
[50:01.320 --> 50:06.280]  must be white people's fault i guess it's my fault for not checking my privilege and how did
[50:06.280 --> 50:12.760]  de facto black lives matter leader d rey mckesson respond to the riots the looting the bloodshed
[50:12.760 --> 50:19.400]  the mayhem the violence by tweeting we stand with you because nothing says justice like
[50:19.400 --> 50:25.160]  destroying your own city and living up to the very stereotype about black people
[50:25.160 --> 50:31.560]  that you constantly complain about barack obama also stands with this group while billionaire
[50:31.560 --> 50:37.080]  white elitist george soros bank rolls it to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars
[50:37.080 --> 50:42.920]  hillary clinton has promised to change laws for them they advocate killing cops
[50:46.280 --> 50:53.560]  they've inspired mass murderers who have killed black cops their ideological guru is a convicted
[50:53.560 --> 50:59.960]  cop killer on the fbi's most wanted terrorist list they've built an entire movement based around
[50:59.960 --> 51:06.360]  the completely fraudulent narrative that there's a racist war against black people being waged by
[51:06.360 --> 51:13.800]  cops it's manifestly provably not true this is what they're protesting against while none of them
[51:13.800 --> 51:21.560]  give a damn about this thanks to black lives matter more black people are killing each other
[51:21.560 --> 51:28.360]  because cops refuse to patrol these areas black lives matter is poison it's doing incredible
[51:28.360 --> 51:35.160]  harm to race relations in america it's giving gang member thugs an excuse to carry out criminal
[51:35.160 --> 51:42.440]  rampages and it's resulting in more black people being killed by other black people how many more
[51:42.440 --> 51:50.120]  cities need to burn before this reality is realized peaceful peaceful peaceful peaceful peaceful
[51:51.320 --> 51:55.800]  hillary clinton has no health problems hillary clinton doesn't fall down alex jones says hillary
[51:55.800 --> 52:00.040]  clinton falls down four days later she falls down in front of everybody with a convulsion
[52:00.040 --> 52:05.080]  that's rachel madow the name in deception whatever she says just flip it the opposite and then
[52:05.080 --> 52:15.480]  you know the truth and why did they censor that video because it was the truth because it was
[52:15.480 --> 52:25.640]  said in a polite focused way and because it wasn't profane because it was on target because
[52:25.640 --> 52:31.960]  in three minutes 20 seconds it destroyed their lives and they're not going to let us sit there
[52:31.960 --> 52:35.960]  and have free space well guess what we knew you were coming with censorship and that's why we are
[52:35.960 --> 52:42.760]  so evenly distributed over so many different media outlets terrestrial radio terrestrial tv

[53:46.520 --> 53:51.480]  things i've ever said that i should talk a lot more about and i'm going to be the globalist
[53:51.480 --> 53:57.160]  no we can end their lie overnight that's why they always say be nice be calm don't be angry don't
[53:57.160 --> 54:07.400]  be upset they want to keep us in a trance state if we reach out to people and we explain that hey
[54:07.400 --> 54:12.600]  if you go shop for organic food pretty soon that's all they'll be is organic because no one's buying
[54:12.600 --> 54:18.680]  the poison food that's already started to happen we're starting to win hey if you always boycott
[54:18.680 --> 54:23.720]  companies and groups that use self-driving cars and trucks and factories and you say i want to buy
[54:23.720 --> 54:27.720]  a vehicle i bought a Ford truck about five years ago six years ago because i knew it was one of the
[54:27.720 --> 54:32.840]  last assembly lines that was people running almost everything and that the trucks were known for being
[54:32.840 --> 54:39.160]  much better then they quit making that truck on that assembly line and i heard the truck fell apart
[54:39.160 --> 54:46.120]  and had big problems i bought the first Ford Raptor when it came out it was made by people
[54:46.120 --> 54:49.720]  even had the whole sticker we need to build a culture like that ladies and gentlemen
[54:52.680 --> 54:59.000]  and because because it was an earlier when people knew it and i've been offered as much money as i
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.560]  bought it for just a few weeks ago because people know oh that's the one made by humans that's the
[55:03.560 --> 55:07.320]  one that works so well it doesn't break that's the one that's so see i mean it's incredible we
[55:07.320 --> 55:12.520]  build a culture where we value each other just like fair trade and then that's how we defeat this
[55:12.520 --> 55:17.720]  system and we boycott these people that's why they want controlled economies they use height to drive
[55:17.720 --> 55:22.040]  us into these systems of acceptance and then we with our own money build our own prison
[55:23.640 --> 55:30.840]  now i want to play uh todd walther the charlotte mecklenburg fraternal order of police uh union
[55:30.840 --> 55:35.400]  had said 70 percent of protesters are from out of town well they're not protesters most of them are
[55:35.400 --> 55:40.040]  violent idiots that have been signaled by the media that it's good to act like this these are
[55:40.040 --> 55:46.600]  the equivalent of white and black modern liberal kkk gang members it's just a gang the kkk is a
[55:46.600 --> 55:52.360]  gang this is a race-based gang it's a joke and the media tries to cover up all the attacks on
[55:52.360 --> 55:57.320]  white people it's shameful how about we don't attack anybody unless they already attack us
[55:58.040 --> 56:01.640]  the female cop that shot the black guy she's clearly in the wrong she just got charged with
[56:01.640 --> 56:06.920]  manslaughter okay and i'm not just defending the cops the point is they want a civil war people
[56:06.920 --> 56:13.080]  so let's play where the attacks are really coming from here it is i've been very proud of our officers
[56:13.080 --> 56:18.360]  our men and women that are out on the streets i've been very proud of my members the eternal
[56:18.360 --> 56:25.480]  order police and their conduct out there how they're handling themselves uh i still say that this
[56:25.480 --> 56:30.920]  is not charlotte that's out here these are an outside entities that are coming in and causing
[56:30.920 --> 56:38.120]  these problems these are not protesters these are criminals protesters fight for a cause they sit
[56:38.120 --> 56:44.040]  down discuss it these are protesters that commit crime they're criminal they're out here for a
[56:44.040 --> 56:49.160]  different purpose they're not here to to resolve issues and resolve problems they're out here for
[56:49.160 --> 56:53.080]  their own good all right so you're saying that all the people on the streets are not from charlotte
[56:54.680 --> 57:00.040]  well i'm not saying all the people but we've got the instigators that are coming in from the outside
[57:00.040 --> 57:05.400]  i mean you've heard reports even last night they were coming in on buses from out of state
[57:06.200 --> 57:11.800]  if you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night i about say that probably
[57:11.800 --> 57:16.120]  70 percent of them had out of state ids they're not coming from charlotte there's like 90 percent
[57:16.120 --> 57:19.720]  in Ferguson's and listen we we've had our reporters there which is joe biggs is there he's coming up

[57:43.960 --> 57:49.560]  it's a fact that move on dot org george soros the ford foundation the ford foundation gave
[57:49.560 --> 57:56.040]  100 million dollars three weeks ago you're seeing that money billions have been given
[57:56.040 --> 58:02.200]  how did they overthrow your crane three years ago anti police riots and are there some bad cops
[58:02.200 --> 58:05.880]  is there bad stuff you can show absolutely is that mean you then overthrow the government
[58:05.880 --> 58:11.240]  and then put in whatever you want and it's some un globalist system it's simple they're discrediting
[58:11.240 --> 58:16.840]  protest right now when they're done folks they're gonna hang the the the the the the the dupes out

[1:00:40.440 --> 1:00:47.640]  three and a half years i was on local access tv i was known on talk radio then within 20 years ago

[1:00:53.080 --> 1:00:58.200]  years ago it was syndicated on limited syndication but you couldn't stop me i was like i'm on this
[1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:02.920]  little syndicator on 10 or 15 stations and i want to buy time on shortwave you mean well sir

[1:01:12.040 --> 1:01:16.280]  from my own show and i was out there selling selling selling because i'd take that money and buy
[1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:22.520]  shortwave radio and buy cameras and buy computers i was in a war you weren't gonna stop me i knew
[1:01:23.240 --> 1:01:27.160]  we had to warn everybody but i always thought i'm gonna warn everybody and then these other
[1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:30.680]  people are gonna rise up and be leaders and defeat it that's finally happening with trump
[1:01:30.680 --> 1:01:37.560]  but it ended up that i was one of the main leaders which i don't even want it's like crazy it's
[1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:41.960]  biblical i didn't want it i would always say i'm looking for leaders who's gonna stand up where are
[1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:45.960]  you you know this is happening here's the documentation i just thought i'd alert alert
[1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:52.040]  we're under attack the drawbridge is down alert alert and turned out i had to climb down there and
[1:01:52.040 --> 1:01:56.040]  take on the globalist as well but you know who was right beside me in front of me at my heart
[1:01:56.040 --> 1:02:02.840]  and behind me it was you it was always you just like they say in v for vendetta the cops asking v
[1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:07.320]  he goes why didn't you take action years ago and he goes i didn't have enough people i was waiting
[1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:12.680]  for you wait for somebody good on the inside i was waiting for you inspector inspector goes
[1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:19.800]  v goes yeah i was waiting for you the thing says oh i must meet with v at that point figure out
[1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:26.920]  he's meeting with v because we're all v and they tell us we're just animals and we're solos and
[1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:31.000]  just join evil big deal everybody's dumb but the globalists don't want to be run over they don't
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:35.160]  want to be dominated they want you to sit there and take it it's not fulfilling to be a slave
[1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:40.440]  master it's not fulfilling to be a slave let's really be free and lift each other up i genuinely
[1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:44.120]  don't like seeing this race for stuff the first day of charlotte i ignored it even though it was
[1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:50.120]  the top story because i'm sick of it you know i don't want to sit there and laugh at these idiots
[1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:56.600]  oh the cry i mean i just it makes me sick i mean if you saw a bunch of white people
[1:02:56.600 --> 1:03:00.600]  beating up black people because a black cop shot a white person you'd say that's ridiculous
[1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:05.960]  and it's we have to you know they've had congress people come out and
[1:03:05.960 --> 1:03:10.440]  say this is racist against white people and then and then apologize later it is a race movement
[1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:16.200]  it's being funded by a guy who uses sociology no matter where he's at in africa the middle east
[1:03:16.200 --> 1:03:24.200]  or europe eastern europe to play groups off catholic against orthodox suny against shiai
[1:03:25.480 --> 1:03:32.840]  tutu against tootsie i mean you know it's what they do they they admit it learn about it admit
[1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:37.320]  you've been conned i'm not talking to our audience i know you've got it we have a
[1:03:37.320 --> 1:03:41.320]  disproportionate amount of black americans that listen that have got it more than i got
[1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:46.520]  it's just it's such a pair and we need to find those folks i hear them calling in and give them
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:51.000]  shows or get them to do shows and get them on air people say start a spanish show to reach out to
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:56.920]  folks i want the money i need the funding i want to do it i i'm trying i'm trying believe me we
[1:03:56.920 --> 1:04:01.640]  got a lot of stuff on the drawing board but it comes down to financial support go buy the products
[1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:05.960]  go buy the supermail vitality the x2 the the brain force the lung cleanse the colloidal silver

[1:08:30.680 --> 1:08:49.240]  we're going to talk to harry dent and his book the sale of a lifetime how the great bubble burst
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:55.400]  of 2017 can make you rich hey i'd like to know that because that's about next year be right on my
[1:08:55.400 --> 1:09:01.320]  timeline to get rich so uh i'm interested in talking to harry about this and of course uh he's
[1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:06.520]  been known as the demographics guy but he's talking about something else in this book he's
[1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:12.360]  talking focusing really on bubbles joining us now is harry dent welcome harry nice to be here
[1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:17.400]  davin you know when we talk about bubbles uh the first thing i think about for some reason is the
[1:09:17.400 --> 1:09:23.000]  federal reserve you know because we were sold this whole idea of a central bank because they told us
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  that it was going to stop the business cycle this destructive business cycle and they did that a
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:32.600]  little bit before the great depression so what they have uh done is taken control of our society
[1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:37.800]  of our economy uh but they haven't ended the bubbles just recently and i want to get your
[1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:43.800]  comment on this just recently uh jenny yellen head of the fed said she's not going to raise
[1:09:43.800 --> 1:09:49.160]  interest rates at this point and trump came out and said well you're working for hillary your if he
[1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:53.720]  would raise the interest rates it would have had immediate negative consequences in the stock market
[1:09:53.720 --> 1:09:57.640]  and it would have scared a lot of people so you're working for them and of course uh george hw
[1:09:57.640 --> 1:10:04.440]  bush accused uh ellen greenspan of keeping interest rates high to benefit bill clinton uh
[1:10:04.440 --> 1:10:08.520]  what's your opinion on that do you think she made the right decision do you think the fed is
[1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:13.480]  manipulating politics like they manipulate our economy well first thing that there's no accident
[1:10:13.480 --> 1:10:18.840]  when the federal reserve was created in 1913 that we had the greatest bubble back then in history
[1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:22.840]  in the roaring twenties and then the great depression to follow it the federal reserve
[1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:28.520]  prevents recessions does not allow the economy to rebalance constantly stimulates through lower
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:33.640]  and lower interest rates and that that will cause bubbles or make whatever bubbles are happening
[1:10:33.640 --> 1:10:39.240]  worse so so the fed has made the wrong decision from the beginning she can't lower into a raise
[1:10:39.240 --> 1:10:44.200]  interest rates now because they've got the economy so hooked on low interest rates and zero interest
[1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:49.720]  rates and stock buybacks and and all this sort of stuff that they can't afford to raise them at all
[1:10:49.720 --> 1:10:54.920]  without the stock market getting in a tantrum and reacting and then that will reverse the wealth
[1:10:54.920 --> 1:11:01.160]  effect they've created so this whole rally since 2009 has been artificial and people keep worrying
[1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:05.640]  about whether all this money printing is going to cause inflation and i say hey the problem is
[1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:11.880]  not inflation the problem is that we create bubbles even bigger than the last one and when
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:17.320]  those bubbles burst our economy is going to be in worse shape than ever well we've got a bubble here
[1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:22.600]  and the question i guess is when are they going to hit it with a pen or when is it going to burst
[1:11:22.600 --> 1:11:27.480]  of its own accord and and what do you think is going to happen when that bubble that they have
[1:11:27.480 --> 1:11:32.600]  created burst well you know i mean this chart is a great example people keep telling me oh harry
[1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:36.840]  we're not really in a bubble and they give all types of reasons i say look you gotta agree that
[1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:43.720]  the late 94 to early 2000 tech bubble was a bubble and everybody agrees on that and say okay let's
[1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:47.800]  look at this stock bubble versus that one and of course they lay right over each other they
[1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:52.840]  look exactly identical the only difference this one is stretched a year and a half longer six and a
[1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:58.040]  half years instead of the normal five years which means it's even more stretch and it's going to
[1:11:58.040 --> 1:12:04.600]  burst even harder so so you know this is what happens when you make money free people will
[1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:09.880]  speculate companies will buy back their stocks people will feel a little richer and spend more
[1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:15.480]  or borrow a little more but it doesn't create real fundamental growth bubbles to beat themselves
[1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:20.840]  so what you said earlier david yes this bubble is going to burst on its own governments aren't
[1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:25.160]  going to stop lowering interest rates until they feel the economy's strong and this will never
[1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:30.920]  happen again they're not going to stop stimulating it's going to be the italian debt crisis hits like
[1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:35.480]  grease did and they're impossible to bail out can be the fracking industries defaulting in the
[1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:40.840]  united states as oil prices continue to fall as we've been forecasting for years china bubble
[1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:44.680]  is the biggest in the world that's going to burst i look at all the bubbles around the world
[1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:51.080]  in this book we've never seen such a global bubble and we've never seen it in all sectors
[1:12:51.080 --> 1:12:57.800]  commodities stocks you know emerging markets developed countries real estate it's everywhere
[1:12:57.800 --> 1:13:02.440]  and then we've got a whole bubble model it says look these are not black swans when they burst
[1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:07.880]  they they they build exponentially predictably over a certain number of years and then when
[1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:13.080]  they peak they're going to correct stocks are going to correct twice as fast as the bubble burst
[1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:19.000]  and usually in the first three months the stock market will make half of that big crash so the
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:23.880]  people that wait to see if the bubble is going to burst is going to be too late we tell people get
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:28.760]  out now we're getting close and by by you know we have this election coming up it's going to be
[1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:34.280]  volatile for the economy at first but i think the big thing is now that the fed did pause and did
[1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:39.640]  not raise in september they're going to have to raise in december or look like they're never ever
[1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:46.120]  going to raise and lose credibility and italy is going to be a default problem by early next year
[1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:50.840]  and there's no way europe can deal with that no way wow now you're talking about people not being
[1:13:50.840 --> 1:13:57.240]  able to see the bubble i want to uh if you guys can get a document cam here of uh illustration out of
[1:13:57.880 --> 1:14:02.680]  peri dense book here why we can't see bubbles and so you've got a bell shaped curve here
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:09.000]  and you say at we're at different points in this bell shaped curve as it's going up people are very
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:14.360]  optimistic they say we won't have any recessions anymore we get to the top and it levels out and
[1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:18.280]  it gets kind of soft and it's not doing anything and even maybe a little bit of a downturn people
[1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:23.640]  say well there's going to be a soft landing but you pointed out as you just said people are going
[1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:29.000]  to see the massive amount of value lost in just a short period of time and that's what you see with
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:34.280]  this bubble a massive falloff that is far worse than anybody said then you get to the trough
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:40.920]  and people say things are so bad they'll never improve i've seen this many times many times on
[1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:45.080]  many different issues that's absolutely that's a perfect illustration and you know david real
[1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:49.320]  quick that what's behind this and this is something we address in this book and all of my books but
[1:14:49.320 --> 1:14:54.680]  especially this book we want to think that things go up linearly and incrementally and just get better
[1:14:54.680 --> 1:14:59.560]  better better better better better and then you kind of go to heaven and stay there life everything
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:04.280]  goes in cycles and and so we're projecting in straight lines and so that's why the better
[1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:09.480]  things get the better we think they're going to get a smart investor understands the longer a market
[1:15:09.480 --> 1:15:15.240]  goes up and the higher it gets the more downside and risk there is and again when it starts to flatten
[1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:20.040]  out we say oh well the government will do this or this will happen and we'll have a soft landing
[1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:24.520]  we're just projecting the slowdown in a straight line and then when it starts heading down and gets
[1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:29.480]  deeper we say oh my gosh it's going to go down forever this is human nature we're really good
[1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:34.840]  at a lot of things david we're terrible at forecasting it's because we don't accept the
[1:15:34.840 --> 1:15:38.840]  ups and downs and the good and bad of life we want all the good all the boom but none of the
[1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:42.920]  bust and and that's what the federal reserve wants the federal reserve wants us to grow at
[1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:47.720]  three to four percent a year with one to two percent inflation and never have a recession
[1:15:47.720 --> 1:15:51.960]  that would be the worst thing that could ever happen to economy because economy
[1:15:51.960 --> 1:15:56.840]  actually works off the opposite dynamics of boom and bust and inflation and deflation and
[1:15:56.840 --> 1:16:02.440]  innovation and creative destruction that's what free market capitalism is about the central banks
[1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:06.920]  have destroyed free market capitalism by taking over the markets and setting interest rates and
[1:16:06.920 --> 1:16:13.240]  asset prices and special interests have taken over democracy because they now decide who gets
[1:16:13.240 --> 1:16:17.400]  elected or not and and all the money and stuff they shouldn't be able to have these super packs and
[1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:23.320]  stuff and influence primaries and elections so we need a big reset and we're going to get one in my
[1:16:23.320 --> 1:16:30.520]  indicators say and i got four powerful indicators that all point down in the next three years together
[1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:36.520]  which only happened in the mid 70s and that giant crash and in the early 30s the great depression
[1:16:36.520 --> 1:16:42.280]  so so basically this is destined to happen and no i don't care who gets elected nobody's going
[1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:47.400]  to be able to prevent this next bubble burst the bubble bubbles always burst of their own extremes
[1:16:47.400 --> 1:16:53.560]  it doesn't matter what causes them the difference is in this book i can map out bubbles in different
[1:16:53.560 --> 1:16:58.920]  stages tell you where you are approximately and how much downside there is and and how long it's
[1:16:58.920 --> 1:17:03.400]  going to take because bubbles are actually quite predictable you know when the bubbles that you
[1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:08.840]  mentioned is a china bubble and you talk about that in depth in your book you talk about the the
[1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:16.360]  fact that they are looking at an aging demographic that is even worse than our baby boomer demographic
[1:17:16.360 --> 1:17:20.120]  as well as of course we're also aware of what they've done with their real estate market
[1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:25.640]  ridiculously inflating that so both of these trends that are very disturbing in the u.s market
[1:17:25.640 --> 1:17:30.200]  are even more disturbing in the chinese market i remember economists going back and drawing
[1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:35.480]  parallels to the great depression saying you know at the time the preeminent economy was the british
[1:17:35.480 --> 1:17:40.760]  economy and america really was a secondary economy but it was but we were growing very quickly
[1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:46.920]  kind of the situation that you still see with the u.s and china where they are we're still kind of
[1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:51.960]  the older but more predominant economy and they're the ones that are growing rapidly and it's when
[1:17:51.960 --> 1:17:59.400]  that rapidly growing upstart has a problem and a burst that really brings on the greater depression
[1:17:59.400 --> 1:18:03.560]  is that what you see happening with the china bubble bursting yeah let me give you an example
[1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:08.600]  china is is the greatest bubble in modern history precisely because the government is driving their
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:14.360]  economy from the top down centrally planned now that's not socialism that is communism that's what
[1:18:14.360 --> 1:18:19.640]  failed in russia and we didn't learn or at least china didn't learn the lesson from that the shanghai
[1:18:19.640 --> 1:18:25.960]  market which he showed the real estate market has gone up eight times 900 percent since 2000
[1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:33.080]  our real estate market went up 2.3 times and then crashed 34 percent and it's got more to go so
[1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:40.680]  you can't even compare these bubbles china has 250 million people they've pushed in the last
[1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:46.680]  two decades into urban areas and they're not even registered citizens they got low skills
[1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:51.560]  they're building stuff for nobody that's what china's government does they force and guarantee
[1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:57.160]  loans down at the local levels and then the local communist governments give contracts to crony
[1:18:57.160 --> 1:19:02.040]  businesses to build stuff for nobody to keep taking these people in from the rural areas
[1:19:02.040 --> 1:19:07.080]  that's how they're growing so fast they've got these massive ghost cities that nobody even lives in
[1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:13.160]  i mean what that's absolute perfect example of essentially planned economy for the benefit
[1:19:13.160 --> 1:19:19.080]  of cronies within that who are doing the planning isn't it it's not just and they do have empty cities
[1:19:19.080 --> 1:19:25.560]  up to a million sitting empty but worse than that in their major cities 27 percent of the condos or
[1:19:25.560 --> 1:19:31.560]  homes are empty they're on electricity and not not using any so this is an independent survey you
[1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:36.360]  can never listen to the government china they'll never tell you the truth and so they so overbuilt
[1:19:36.360 --> 1:19:41.000]  it's great all right we got to go to a commercial break we're talking to harry dent his book is
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:46.600]  sale of a lifetime now the great bubble burst of 2017 can make you rich we're going to be right back
[1:19:46.600 --> 1:19:58.040]  with more of harry dent stay with us

[1:24:14.680 --> 1:24:20.440]  i'm david night and we're talking to harry dent about his book sale of a lifetime how the great
[1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:26.920]  bubble burst of 2017 can make you rich and in the very first paragraph let me read you what he says
[1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:31.880]  in the introduction he says some call me the demographics guy others call me that crazy guy
[1:24:31.880 --> 1:24:37.480]  but at the heart of it i'm a cycles guy and we're in a time of extreme cycles it's the times that
[1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:44.600]  are crazy not me and i think that's an interesting way to start the book because harry uh you have
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:49.400]  written a lot about demographics and there's a lot of demographics information in this book as well
[1:24:50.760 --> 1:24:55.480]  but uh you can't separate these things they don't exist independently of each other you
[1:24:55.480 --> 1:24:59.560]  know the demographics drive cycles and so forth and there's a lot of things that that drive the
[1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:04.200]  cycles you talk about past bubbles you talk about cycles that are coming through here
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:08.520]  and finally you talk about profiting from it i'm looking at this it's like okay with everything
[1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:13.800]  crashing uh you know how do we how do we make money out of this and and let me ask you too about
[1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:19.720]  the uh the time frame uh tell us why you're you're saying that this is going to happen in 2017 because
[1:25:19.720 --> 1:25:25.240]  this year we've we saw massive decreases uh in oil beginning uh the you know about a year ago
[1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:30.600]  or whatever and uh continued to go down but now oil is going back up we've seen uh gold go up about
[1:25:30.600 --> 1:25:36.600]  $200 this year why are you certain of the time frame of 2017 and how do we profit from this
[1:25:37.720 --> 1:25:41.400]  well well remember one of one of the key indicators i've i've discovered in the last
[1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:46.760]  so many years ned davis was a cycle guy very good guy who had this decennial cycle that said you
[1:25:46.760 --> 1:25:52.280]  know what most the big stock crashes and recessions or downturns or crises come in the first two and
[1:25:52.280 --> 1:25:57.720]  a half three years of every decade and i tell you that worked like a charm in the 60s 70s 80s 90s
[1:25:57.720 --> 1:26:03.400]  and early 2000s but it didn't work in 2010 to 12 when it should have and so when something doesn't
[1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:09.880]  work i say hey what's wrong and what i found is what's behind that cycle is sunspot cycles
[1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:15.960]  which may average 10 years but they come anywhere from 8 to 13 and only the best scientists can
[1:26:15.960 --> 1:26:22.120]  predict these things so now i study these scientists and and this basically the last sunspot cycle was
[1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:28.600]  very stretched and we had two major crises the tech rec and then the great financial crisis 2008
[1:26:28.600 --> 1:26:34.600]  2009 in the down cycle of the last one which was extraordinarily long and then we had this up cycle
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:40.360]  and then in 2014 it turned down again as the scientists predicted and ever since the stock
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:46.360]  market's gone down i mean gone nowhere with more volatility now this cycle points down for the next
[1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:51.720]  three years and of course the last three years of this cycle as predicted by scientists should be
[1:26:51.720 --> 1:26:59.640]  the worst so 2007 to 19 is when the greatest danger period is our demographic cycles point down
[1:26:59.640 --> 1:27:05.240]  into 2020 before they flatten out and don't turn up for a few years after that our geopolitical
[1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:12.040]  cycle since 9-11 still points down into early 2020 and our innovation cycle with the peaking of the
[1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:18.360]  internet and Moore's law and computers has peaked and doesn't turn around for a long time so all of
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:23.880]  our cycles point down at the same time but it's this sunspot cycle that most allows us to pinpoint
[1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:31.240]  danger periods and that is 2017 to 19 also i mean they've stretched this so far yes the markets have
[1:27:31.240 --> 1:27:36.360]  no longer been going up in the last few years but they're not going down because of endless
[1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:42.200]  stimulus well again i'm just waiting on one thing to go wrong like an italy default or a
[1:27:42.200 --> 1:27:47.880]  threatening default in italy or this chinese i mean the chinese stock bubble already started to burst
[1:27:47.880 --> 1:27:54.120]  in 2015 and guess what it was down just like typical 45 percent in the first three months even
[1:27:54.120 --> 1:27:58.760]  though it's eventually going to be down 80 or 90 percent but that china bubble has been propped up
[1:27:58.760 --> 1:28:03.880]  by the government buying their own stock market it's only gone sideways when that next leg drops
[1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:08.200]  on stocks then the chinese investors are going to worry about real estate and you saw that real
[1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:14.600]  estate bubble earlier chinese have 75 percent of their net worth in real estate versus 28 percent
[1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:19.640]  in the u.s their real estate is so overvalued compared to their economy compared to ours
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:24.840]  when that bubble burst it's going to take the entire world down it's going to make the subprime
[1:28:24.840 --> 1:28:30.840]  crisis in the u.s last time around look like nothing so so we're just waiting for something
[1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:35.560]  to go wrong i'm just telling people look the stock market now is is fighting headwinds
[1:28:35.560 --> 1:28:40.840]  even all of our cycles and when something finally goes wrong the first wave down is going to be
[1:28:40.840 --> 1:28:46.200]  down 30 40 50 percent in a matter of months you're better to get conservative now the key
[1:28:46.200 --> 1:28:51.400]  to what you first asked how do you take advantage of these big crashes you have to protect your
[1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:55.800]  money now you have to take your money out of these bubbles in real estate and commodities
[1:28:55.800 --> 1:29:01.240]  and stocks and note these bubbles don't all peak at the same time and they won't bottom at the same
[1:29:01.240 --> 1:29:07.160]  time so commodities have already largely crashed oil has already been down 80 percent iron ore
[1:29:07.160 --> 1:29:13.880]  80 steel overall commodities are down 70 percent corns down 70 percent they may have some more to
[1:29:13.880 --> 1:29:18.840]  go but those bubbles are probably going to bottom earlier stocks will come next and in emerging
[1:29:18.840 --> 1:29:24.120]  countries first and then down the road in real estate real estate takes the longest for bubbles
[1:29:24.120 --> 1:29:28.440]  to burst and to turn around so we're going to be looking we look in this book but i'll be looking
[1:29:28.440 --> 1:29:33.880]  in my newsletters and stuff when is the time when have we erased enough of these bubbles that you
[1:29:33.880 --> 1:29:38.600]  can invest long term again and that brings us back to the bubble models we know we'll have to stop we'll
[1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:42.680]  have to stop there we're out of time fascinating book and if you want to know how to get rich we
[1:29:42.680 --> 1:29:46.600]  didn't have time for him tell us all of it you can get the book sale of a lifetime by harry

[1:29:57.240 --> 1:30:06.600]  seattle mariners catcher steve clavinger has fallen under heavy scrutiny after two tweets he made
[1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:10.920]  thursday in response to the events in charlotte north carolina wednesday night but he went further
[1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:15.720]  than just the charlotte riots and said this black people beating whites when a thug got shot holding
[1:30:15.720 --> 1:30:20.920]  a gun by a black officer this cracks me up keep kneeling for the anthem regardless that what
[1:30:20.920 --> 1:30:28.040]  he tweeted is true he is white so he is racist and he must apologize he also tweeted blm is pathetic
[1:30:28.040 --> 1:30:33.320]  obama is pathetic everyone involved should be locked behind bars like animals now he is just
[1:30:33.320 --> 1:30:38.200]  sharing his opinion though i think the animal's common is what triggered people but again he's
[1:30:38.200 --> 1:30:43.160]  not allowed that opinion because he's white you could actually read those tweets and they could
[1:30:43.160 --> 1:30:49.320]  come from a black person or a white person because there is no racism just objective fact and opinion
[1:30:49.320 --> 1:30:55.000]  don't worry though the seattle mariners are very disappointed this proves once again you're either
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:31:01.400]  with the left or you're a racist shut up be sure to download the new app at info wars dot com slash

[1:33:22.840 --> 1:33:29.640]  friday september 23rd 2016 i'm david night and we're going to have an interview with joel
[1:33:30.360 --> 1:33:35.480]  gilbert who uh wrote dreams of my real father and there's no place like utopia he's also the guy
[1:33:35.480 --> 1:33:43.960]  behind the massive times square billboard that got millions of dollars of publicity for 25 000
[1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:49.560]  dollars they did donald trump as superman got so much attention absolutely amazing now he's got a
[1:33:49.560 --> 1:33:54.680]  viral video called a meraphobia we have an article about that up at info wars dot com we're going to
[1:33:54.680 --> 1:34:02.120]  be talking to him in the next hour he's going to describe for us what a meraphobia is and how
[1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:07.640]  hillary clinton is suffering from it we also uh have a clip that we're going to play in just a
[1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:14.520]  moment of an interview that alex jones had just a day or so ago with william benny talking about
[1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:20.840]  about the real role of the nsa and of course william benny was the technical head of the nsa
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:28.360]  for decades and he was one of the key whistleblowers uh right after 9 11 uh william benny thomas
[1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:34.280]  drake and others were very key whistleblowers and it was looking at what they said and how
[1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:38.760]  the u.s government specifically the obama administration went after them because it wasn't
[1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:43.800]  the obama it was the obama administration that went after thomas drake trying to put him
[1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:51.080]  in jail for decades saying that he had emails and documents that were not classified but
[1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:54.600]  they should have been classified and he should have known that they should have been classified
[1:34:54.600 --> 1:34:59.480]  does that sound familiar except that the documents that he had were nothing at all and they were
[1:34:59.480 --> 1:35:05.320]  not classified and they did drop that it was totally made up but that's the amazing double
[1:35:05.320 --> 1:35:10.680]  standard but when ed snowden saw the way they treated thomas drake that's when he did what he
[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:14.760]  did the way that he did it it was because of what he saw and you can see that in the snowden film
[1:35:14.760 --> 1:35:19.560]  and of course william benny was not only former technical head of the nsa but he was also a
[1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:26.280]  consultant to oliver stone on the movie snowden excellent film if you haven't seen it take people
[1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:29.960]  who don't understand what this is about take them to that film you will have an amazing
[1:35:29.960 --> 1:35:35.400]  conversation afterwards hopefully it'll enlighten them as well in the film they show you ed snowden's
[1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:40.440]  life and probably like me you don't know too much about ed snowden's life and it's interesting to
[1:35:40.440 --> 1:35:45.960]  see some of the details of his life but as they're going through his journey and his awakening
[1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:54.200]  they show you how uh basically as you walk through him in a dramatic film like this

[1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:53.720]  at infowarslife.com let's go to the William Benny clip now there's an article that we have up on
[1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:58.920]  infowars.com whistleblower says and that's what that's another capacity of William Benny he's
[1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:04.840]  been former technical head of the SA whistleblower and consultant himself to the Snowden film he
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:13.480]  says the NSA is the backbone of world surveillance state here's that clip what about a larger plan
[1:38:13.480 --> 1:38:17.400]  I mean I know it's about looting and making money hundreds of billions of dollars you know globally
[1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:24.120]  a year by these companies but what's the master strategy on building this technocracy I mean do
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:34.040]  they have one I think it's a a well this is my impression okay certainly it is the population
[1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:40.760]  control it's not just of any given country but of the world and so what they're after and directed
[1:38:40.760 --> 1:38:47.240]  and I think the Obama has stated this from various points that he wanted a world community
[1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:53.160]  so I think that's probably what they're after in order to do that they have to be able to control
[1:38:53.160 --> 1:38:57.880]  the people of the world so in order to do that you have to have knowledge of them to know who's
[1:38:57.880 --> 1:39:04.360]  doing what so you can stop it or manipulate it any way you want William Benny that is the most
[1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:09.400]  profound thing I think I've ever heard you say you've said a lot of profound things this is the key
[1:39:09.400 --> 1:39:15.400]  for a technocracy world government program and Davos admits that's their plan but here you are
[1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:20.440]  the former leader of the national security agency telling us that that's what they're building a
[1:39:20.440 --> 1:39:26.440]  beast system if you're not a Christian it almost makes you undone it yeah amazing interview you need
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:33.080]  to watch that interview as well that Alex had with William Benny William Benny always spot on he
[1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:40.040]  understands this better than anybody and he is an honest patriot he and people like Thomas Drake and
[1:39:40.040 --> 1:39:46.120]  the other NSA whistleblowers they were concerned about the Constitution they were concerned about
[1:39:46.120 --> 1:39:51.560]  individual liberty and one of the things that William Benny said in the interview with Alex Jones
[1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:56.360]  another reason you should watch it don't have a clip of that but he talked about how it's becoming
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:02.520]  mercenary how it is being outsourced to corporations and of course that was one of the key things
[1:40:03.400 --> 1:40:08.200]  at the time that they left they said look we've got a program that was written by people who worked
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:14.520]  for the NSA we got a program that will go through and find people that are dangerous and narrow
[1:40:14.520 --> 1:40:20.920]  this search down but you went outside of the NSA and you paid a tremendous amount of money to a
[1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:26.520]  corporation that gave you a system that if it works creates a bigger haystack to try to find that
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:31.480]  needle in and you're actually making it more difficult to find people and you spent a great
[1:40:31.480 --> 1:40:38.280]  deal of money to do that and it was in that struggle that you of course you can see a forester
[1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:44.360]  gets demoted and and he's in the in the Snowden movie but it's through that struggle that they
[1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:49.480]  gradually began to realize some of the other issues and the dragnet surveillance it was
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:55.400]  by making that haystack larger they also violated the constitution and so when they're outsourcing
[1:40:55.400 --> 1:41:01.800]  this increasingly to private corporations and of course at Snowden was working for one of these
[1:41:01.800 --> 1:41:07.160]  private corporations that they outsourced it to as they do that understand that what is happening
[1:41:07.880 --> 1:41:15.320]  is that you're getting a mercenary intelligence system people who were for sale to the highest
[1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:22.920]  bidders and it's replacing citizens and patriots who are working for the NSA you understand it's
[1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:30.680]  like the army I'm concerned about a standing army and I don't like a draft either I don't want people
[1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:38.200]  being forced to into military service perhaps the best example would be something like they have
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:42.280]  in Switzerland we have some required training what they're doing in Switzerland is they're
[1:41:42.280 --> 1:41:46.440]  creating a citizen militia they have people there who know how to use firearms you have
[1:41:46.440 --> 1:41:51.080]  required training but they don't necessarily enslave people and they certainly don't send
[1:41:51.080 --> 1:41:55.160]  their troops off to fight in foreign wars Switzerland doesn't do that that's one of the
[1:41:55.160 --> 1:42:01.560]  reasons why they've been isolated in peace even during World War II they had a citizenry that
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:09.640]  was capable of defending itself and they they set up those borders there but when you go from a
[1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:16.600]  militia and a citizen army to a professional army that becomes increasingly mercenary that's how
[1:42:16.600 --> 1:42:21.560]  they can use them for these different purposes and if you it gets even worse when you talk about
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:27.080]  a professional mercenary intelligence system because now those people can come in and they
[1:42:27.080 --> 1:42:34.600]  can be more interested in looking at emails of people who might give them insights into the
[1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:40.280]  stock market or grabbing corporate secrets from all over the world things that would personally
[1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:45.960]  enrich them and not only that but because their fundamental loyalty is to the almighty dollar
[1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:52.600]  or gold or the franc or whatever it is that they can cash it in at the given time because
[1:42:52.600 --> 1:42:57.400]  they're mercenaries they're not interested in protecting you so this whole thing that is
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:02.600]  being sold to us that you have to give up your freedom for the promise of security
[1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:08.920]  goes away doesn't it and of course it was a lie to start with to the degree that you give up your
[1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:13.400]  freedom you become a slave and they always want to come in and say just a little bit of slavery
[1:43:13.400 --> 1:43:19.080]  just a little bit of slavery but it's an incremental bargain and to the degree that you're a slave
[1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:24.360]  you're not free you will never be free slaves are never free slaves are never safe they are
[1:43:24.360 --> 1:43:29.880]  never protected they're never prosperous okay so to the degree that you give up that freedom to
[1:43:29.880 --> 1:43:34.120]  the degree that you enslave yourself to this system because they promise you that they'll make you
[1:43:34.760 --> 1:43:40.280]  safe for the you'll be more prosperous or whatever to that degree you become a slave and slaves are
[1:43:40.280 --> 1:43:45.800]  never free slaves don't own anything as a matter of fact and when we're talking about that I think
[1:43:45.800 --> 1:43:53.480]  you know when we look at the global system we've seen a lot of stories and this is accelerating
[1:43:53.480 --> 1:43:57.640]  in this last week because the federal government has come in and said we're going to regulate
[1:43:57.640 --> 1:44:02.760]  these self-driving cars we've talked about the technology behind it before we've talked about
[1:44:02.760 --> 1:44:08.520]  the lie that these things are so safe that nobody is ever going to die again from an automobile
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:13.560]  accident you know I look at that line that's being sold by Volvo and other people like
[1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:19.400]  that I remember when nuclear power was sold to us and we were told it's going to be so cheap
[1:44:19.400 --> 1:44:23.720]  you won't even have to put electric meters out there and don't worry about any of the safety
[1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:31.240]  issues okay there are always issues with any technology but when we started seeing this
[1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:36.200]  last week the kind of articles that are coming out about self-driving cars what you need to
[1:44:36.200 --> 1:44:44.520]  understand is that this is now coming becoming very quickly about agenda 21 about agenda 2030
[1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:50.040]  those UN agendas where they want to keep you in the city how are they going to keep you down on
[1:44:50.040 --> 1:44:55.720]  the farm what you've seen gay puree perry how they're going to keep you locked downtown after
[1:44:55.720 --> 1:45:00.040]  you've seen the suburbs and the exerbs and the rural areas that you would prefer to live in
[1:45:00.600 --> 1:45:05.880]  because people typically don't like to be packed into little tiny boxes like rats but that's what
[1:45:05.880 --> 1:45:12.200]  agenda 21 agenda 2030 the agenda for sustainable development that's being sold to us by the UN
[1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:17.560]  they want you to live closely packed into the cities and the 200 square foot apartments
[1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:22.360]  and of course we've seen the map of the united states where they have the areas where people are
[1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:29.000]  going to live a few mega cities and the rest of the united states where it's off limits
[1:45:29.800 --> 1:45:33.560]  and you might ask yourself wow they could never never keep us out of there well it's all about
[1:45:33.560 --> 1:45:38.920]  transportation and when you look at these stories that have come out here's a couple that are on
[1:45:38.920 --> 1:45:44.600]  drudge report today bloomberg robot rides may force air prone human motorists off the road
[1:45:44.600 --> 1:45:49.240]  because you know we're dangerous and the cars are just perfect they say new roles for the road
[1:45:49.240 --> 1:45:52.760]  for robot cars coming out of washington this week could lead to the eventual extinction of one of
[1:45:52.760 --> 1:45:58.680]  the most defining archetypes of the past century the human driver see because cars should not serve
[1:45:58.680 --> 1:46:04.520]  what they're really telling you is cars should not serve the needs of the public cars should serve
[1:46:04.520 --> 1:46:13.320]  the needs of the globalist few people like lyft people like uber will control all transportation
[1:46:13.320 --> 1:46:17.960]  working with the government as their chosen partners because the government sees this as
[1:46:17.960 --> 1:46:24.360]  a way to keep you tied down to shut off your mobility and then when you do have it to tax and
[1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:31.640]  to track to tax you and track you everywhere you go but understand also that the government
[1:46:32.600 --> 1:46:37.960]  wants to participate in this as they point out in bloomberg they're saying regulators are accelerating
[1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:43.720]  the shift yeah they're accelerating the shift see this isn't even regulatory capture this
[1:46:43.720 --> 1:46:49.160]  isn't even the kind of crony capitalism that we've seen in the past this truly is agenda 21
[1:46:49.160 --> 1:46:56.680]  agenda 2030 because what they want to do and it is the essence of their business model i talked
[1:46:56.680 --> 1:47:02.680]  about this on monday night's nightly news there was a blog post that was put out by the co-founder
[1:47:02.680 --> 1:47:10.360]  of lyft the current president john zimmer and in it he spent so much time he said it was the third
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:17.480]  transportation revolution the first one being trains the second one being the car as we know it
[1:47:17.480 --> 1:47:24.680]  and the third one being what i would call toll cars toll cars do you like toll roads i don't
[1:47:24.680 --> 1:47:30.360]  like toll roads as a matter of fact toll roads people just like toll roads so much that the
[1:47:30.360 --> 1:47:35.640]  toll road that they put here in texas is going bankrupt but this is not a state story when we
[1:47:35.640 --> 1:47:41.720]  talk about toll roads this is a national story because this toll road the bankers who backed it
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:46.120]  and the foreign corporation central which is a spanish corporation that owns it and owns many
[1:47:46.680 --> 1:47:50.280]  of the toll roads throughout america as a matter of fact in north carolina where i came from
[1:47:50.280 --> 1:47:55.800]  that same company is trying to do the same deal in north carolina even as this one here is going
[1:47:55.800 --> 1:48:02.840]  bankrupt and they play games you may not realize if you don't look at this the games that are
[1:48:02.840 --> 1:48:07.320]  being played here in texas as they built that toll road you may have heard they got the speed
[1:48:07.320 --> 1:48:16.440]  limit up to 85 well that was on the toll road and just as crony capless always do and these
[1:48:16.440 --> 1:48:21.480]  private public partnerships oh partnerships you know like trans specific partnership the trans
[1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:26.920]  atlantic partnership is when the government and multinational corporations get together and they
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:32.920]  do something wonderful they consolidate their wealth and power they shut you out they turn
[1:48:32.920 --> 1:48:37.080]  you into a renter because they're going to own everything so you're going to rent the roads
[1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:41.400]  but they've got an even better plan for you you're not even going to have your own car you're going
[1:48:41.400 --> 1:48:46.920]  to rent the road and the car from them and one of the things that they do that they did here in texas
[1:48:46.920 --> 1:48:53.320]  is they raised the speed limit up to 85 on the toll road and at the same time they worked out
[1:48:53.320 --> 1:48:58.280]  a deal with the texas department transportation to lower the speed limits on adjacent roads from
[1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:06.040]  65 to 55 how's that so you don't try to force you onto their road not only that but they got a deal
[1:49:06.040 --> 1:49:11.560]  put in where they banned any improvements to the adjacent roads and any new construction adding
[1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:18.120]  any new roads around there and then they also have traffic lights over and over and over again on
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:22.280]  feeder roads around they've increased the number of traffic lights drop the speed limit so forth
[1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:28.520]  and so on but you know what people still won't ride these things many people like me object to them
[1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:35.400]  on principle so what they are doing is they're going out of they're going bankrupt and they're
[1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:42.520]  taking this system the the bankrupt system is really underwritten more by federal loans than it is
[1:49:42.520 --> 1:49:47.240]  by state loans so even if you're not in texas or north carolina or new jersey in new york
[1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:52.120]  you're going to pay for those as well but that is the model of ownership i've got alex uh on the
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:58.920]  phone right now alex go ahead oh okay he's uh he was on the phone and we just lost him but as we
[1:49:58.920 --> 1:50:02.360]  look at this what is going to say about the transportation revolution he really wasn't
[1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:08.760]  talking so much about transportation but he was talking about cities and you have to understand
[1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:16.440]  this is why i say this is about agenda 21 about agenda 2030 as you look at this blog post from the
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:21.400]  Lyft co-founder and president the vision that you get from him and the vision you get from all these
[1:50:21.400 --> 1:50:25.800]  people are that cities are wonderful we should all be living in the cities and you know what if you
[1:50:25.800 --> 1:50:30.440]  like cities that's fine go ahead and live there but they want to coerce you into the cities and
[1:50:30.440 --> 1:50:36.040]  so to do that they tell you that cars are the problem so cities are the solution and cars are the
[1:50:36.040 --> 1:50:43.240]  problem no we have known throughout history the cities have been the center of plagues of disease
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:48.440]  of oppression of overcrowding thomas jefferson said their plague to to the health the wealth and
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:54.680]  liberties of man no cities are the plague cars are the solution the suburbs are not a problem
[1:50:54.680 --> 1:51:03.640]  people went there to escape the city say what this will be right back you know about rvs you've
[1:51:03.640 --> 1:51:10.440]  heard about bunkers but surviving is not recreation and men wasn't made to live underground

[1:54:11.160 --> 1:54:15.160]  heard me talking about self-driving cars and he's actually on the road but i he's not in a self-driving
[1:54:15.160 --> 1:54:21.080]  car he's he's actually driving the car himself uh joining us now is alex go ahead alex well
[1:54:21.080 --> 1:54:25.160]  absolutely you know we attack these self-driving cars as they're constantly crashing and having
[1:54:25.160 --> 1:54:29.800]  problems they tell us they're perfect but the globalist admit as you said it's about taxing
[1:54:29.800 --> 1:54:34.680]  us by the mile it's about taking humans out of their environment basically capturing us totally
[1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:41.080]  controlling us making us uh be domesticated uh everything that we see is about not having
[1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:46.120]  lemonade cans not having omics not having farmers markets if we i'm starting a movement
[1:54:46.120 --> 1:54:50.120]  the next few weeks and even a foundation where we're going to basically start putting labeling
[1:54:50.120 --> 1:54:55.400]  on saying humans were involved in its productions humans delivered it humans actually you know you
[1:54:55.400 --> 1:55:00.520]  know uh we're we're paid for being involved in it the globalist that's a great idea back to mouth
[1:55:00.520 --> 1:55:05.480]  this you hear me David yeah that's a great idea i was gonna say better than made in the usa made
[1:55:05.480 --> 1:55:11.400]  by humans absolutely so going back it's not the work of technology it's it's what the globalist
[1:55:11.400 --> 1:55:16.280]  admit going back the time of mouth us almost 300 years ago he said everybody in compact cities
[1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:21.880]  it will be horrible they're all subhuman the whole guy you know the world will collapse by 1800
[1:55:21.880 --> 1:55:28.680]  it didn't happen and so eugenics then got picked up and that's all this is is rama manual's brother
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:32.040]  you know saying we're going to have a monopoly and you won't even be able to drive your car it
[1:55:32.040 --> 1:55:38.120]  will be our software it'll be our cars this is a group of criminals trying to regulatorily take
[1:55:38.120 --> 1:55:43.720]  over and then just take humans out of the equation uh completely and put us into this
[1:55:43.720 --> 1:55:49.560]  you know automated uh control grid but the answer is exposing what it is you know they
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:54.200]  come out with arrogant statements like within five years you know the feds say they're going to make
[1:55:54.200 --> 1:55:59.240]  the roads only for driverless cars well we're not going to let them do that okay we're we're going
[1:55:59.240 --> 1:56:03.880]  to say no to this we understand it but they try to make it sound like you will be assimilated
[1:56:03.880 --> 1:56:10.520]  we are the board nothing can stop us this is the board so ai that is globalist directed
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:15.240]  and and and and and monopoly driven just like they stage the stock market the interest rates
[1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:19.720]  and the currency rates must end what's what william benney said yesterday not just that
[1:56:19.720 --> 1:56:25.000]  there's a global surveillance grid he said it's a global government the surveillance grid
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:30.120]  is the corporate world government a corporate world government is financing the surveillance
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:35.560]  grid getting all the countries to tie into it to quote have the surveillance power giving rings of
[1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:42.040]  power to the dwarves the elves and to the men who lost after power beyond anybody else but then in
[1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:49.240]  secrecy forces one ring one ring to rule them all and in the darkness find them this is the base
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:53.640]  system it is the technocracy we're not against technology folks but we're against just like we're
[1:56:53.640 --> 1:56:58.440]  not against guns but we're against how this is being deployed and who wields it baby you're doing a
[1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:02.680]  great job god bless you back to you thank you alex and you know when you talk about one ring to rule
[1:57:02.680 --> 1:57:09.240]  them all it's one technology to bind them in the cities you know we can talk about the privacy issues
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:13.880]  we can talk about the safety issues but when i look at this and as alex mentioned the article
[1:57:13.880 --> 1:57:18.760]  it's up on the dredge report human drivers could soon be banned from the roads and this is a very
[1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:23.960]  specific road interstate five between seattle and vancouver this is what the politicians want to do
[1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:30.040]  and they will be able to cut you off and keep you in the cities if we allow them to do it
[1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:35.320]  this is why it is very important for us to understand where the long-term plan is for this
[1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:39.800]  we've talked about agenda 21 for so long they changed the name they changed it to agenda 2030
[1:57:39.800 --> 1:57:46.520]  they got more specific i said you know agenda 21 was just a 21st century sometime now it's 2030
[1:57:46.520 --> 1:57:50.760]  and they talk about it being sustainability it hasn't changed they've just put a more firm
[1:57:50.760 --> 1:57:56.440]  timeframe on it but understand that the issue is to keep you in the cities and one of the ways
[1:57:56.440 --> 1:58:01.400]  that they do that is to say well we're not going to let you have cars in the city one of these
[1:58:01.400 --> 1:58:04.920]  articles where i said only there's going to be a lot of cities that are going to come in and the
[1:58:04.920 --> 1:58:09.080]  only cars that they will allow be self-driving cars and then two paragraphs down they say well a lot
[1:58:09.080 --> 1:58:13.240]  of these cars won't be able to drive very well they won't drive very quickly they won't be able
[1:58:13.240 --> 1:58:18.120]  to drive in bad weather so what will you be doing you'll be walking in bad weather they're going to
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:21.800]  narrow the roads they're going to widen the sidewalks they're going to keep you on foot and
[1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:26.440]  locked in the cities that's the plan if you understand it you can fight it stay with us we're
[1:58:26.440 --> 1:58:32.200]  going to become a guy with uh joel gilbert will be joining us in the next hour will america awaken

[2:00:06.920 --> 2:00:16.040]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:00:25.480 --> 2:00:29.320]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night in the next segment we're going to be joined
[2:00:29.320 --> 2:00:36.920]  by joel gilbert documentarian author and he has a new viral video we're going to talk about a
[2:00:36.920 --> 2:00:42.760]  maraphobia and if you can see the article at info wars dot com a very very funny video but
[2:00:42.760 --> 2:00:48.280]  we're going to talk to him about the whole concept of a maraphobia there's a very famous person that
[2:00:48.280 --> 2:00:54.280]  suffers from it's a matter of fact quite a few people suffer from the public eye but in this
[2:00:54.280 --> 2:01:00.040]  segment before we come back with joel gilbert i want to finish up on what i was talking about with
[2:01:00.040 --> 2:01:05.160]  the agenda 21 aspects and of course the thing that really troubled me is to see how quickly this is
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:10.360]  coming i think they're they're accelerating this quickly enough and people don't really understand
[2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:16.120]  what is behind it and now they've got a very specific 150 mile stretch of interstate five
[2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:22.200]  between seattle and vancouver and they're saying that they're going to ban that from humans it's
[2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:28.520]  going to be a driver-free zone they're going to ban human motorists from carpool lanes on this in
[2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:33.160]  this area and that's the way it begins folks i think one of the things we need to understand is
[2:01:33.160 --> 2:01:40.280]  we need to stop calling these things self-driving cars you know an automobile was self-mobility
[2:01:40.280 --> 2:01:46.280]  that's where the name comes from right it was about self-mobility and we controlled it ourselves
[2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:50.600]  and so we go back to this whole idea that the lift president was trying to sell us you know first
[2:01:50.600 --> 2:01:57.080]  we had trains but then we got autonomous capability to go wherever we wanted to go without the
[2:01:57.080 --> 2:02:01.400]  government really having any control over that and they don't like that for a number of reasons
[2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:07.320]  obviously okay they're they're desperate to try to put us back into trains even if that means
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:12.120]  that the trains are going to be controlled on a literal information highway that they're going to
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:17.240]  have the highway and the cars all linked together they're telling us that they're
[2:02:17.240 --> 2:02:22.840]  self-driving cars you know we need to come up with a better uh pejorative term that we can use
[2:02:22.840 --> 2:02:26.520]  something that describes it better and that is also pejorative so i thought well you know
[2:02:26.520 --> 2:02:31.000]  botmobiles no it sounds too much like a batmobile that's just too cool i think we should call them
[2:02:31.640 --> 2:02:36.520]  toll cars because that's the way they're going to be used so within this last week
[2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:41.960]  as the federal government came down on their side doing the same thing for these companies
[2:02:41.960 --> 2:02:48.680]  that they did for the big aggro companies you know we had all these different state regulations
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:52.840]  that were coming up said you know we want to know if there's gmo's in the food and the products
[2:02:52.840 --> 2:02:57.560]  that we've got here so we're going to uh mandate that there's labels put on there so people can
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:03:04.360]  make those decisions and if the industry wants to put gmo in genetically modified things inside
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:10.040]  your food or other products then sell us on the benefits of that tell us how that's a good thing
[2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:17.800]  don't hide the fact that it's there okay so they were enacting state legislation or at least fighting
[2:03:17.800 --> 2:03:21.880]  them all across uh the communities all across the united states so what they do they went to the
[2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:26.600]  federal government and they said let's shut this thing down in violation of the ninth amendment
[2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:31.080]  violation of the tenth amendment of the constitution they came out and said you know what uh and we've
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:37.480]  called it the dark act it was passed by congress obama signed it and what it says is uh you can't
[2:03:37.480 --> 2:03:43.080]  have legislations telling people uh that that mandate that people have to know what's in their
[2:03:43.080 --> 2:03:46.840]  food they shut that whole thing down that's what they're doing with cars right now
[2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:52.200]  as they people started having experience with these cars they saw some of the safety issues
[2:03:52.200 --> 2:03:56.920]  they realized they were being sold a bill of goods on the safety issues then some regulations
[2:03:56.920 --> 2:04:00.760]  started coming along in various communities especially california because they were first
[2:04:00.760 --> 2:04:05.720]  ones to see the self-driving cars they saw the number of accidents now we've seen uh several
[2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:10.840]  people uh couple at least a couple of people die in these self-driving Tesla vehicles and remember
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:17.000]  the guy who died here in america they covered that up with the assistance of the federal government
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:22.760]  for two months while they played the stock market now the sec is investigating it he's being sued by
[2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:29.400]  stockholders because that was a very negative thing for them they were touting the autopilot feature
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:34.200]  as a big selling point and then when somebody dies they they covered that up they've covered it up
[2:04:34.200 --> 2:04:39.800]  in china for eight months there was somebody there in china who died in self-driving mode
[2:04:39.800 --> 2:04:44.040]  and they've covered that up for eight months and remember they lied to us when it first came out
[2:04:44.040 --> 2:04:49.560]  they said oh it wasn't in self-driving mode well it turns out it actually was stay with us when we
[2:04:49.560 --> 2:04:58.040]  come back we're going to talk to joel gibbert we'll be right back
[2:04:58.040 --> 2:05:06.840]  the white house confirmed this week that president obama will veto any legislation that allows the
[2:05:06.840 --> 2:05:13.560]  families of the victims of 9 11 to sue the government of saudi arabia as one texas representative
[2:05:13.560 --> 2:05:19.080]  points out lewis gomart it shows where the president's loyalty truly lies he's standing
[2:05:19.080 --> 2:05:24.760]  with the kingdom and not with us citizens the veto announcement will arguably lay the groundwork
[2:05:24.760 --> 2:05:30.200]  for a showdown with obama and congress as this bill has bipartisan support on the hill
[2:05:30.200 --> 2:05:36.680]  and gained final approval today in the house the 28 pages of the heavily redacted 9 11 commission
[2:05:36.680 --> 2:05:43.080]  report implicate saudi arabia both clandestine and government complicity occurred in 2001
[2:05:43.080 --> 2:05:49.000]  in the attack that killed thousands of americans in york dc in pennsylvania the president's
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:53.880]  participation in blocking justice for these families reflects how he truly feels despite
[2:05:53.880 --> 2:05:59.160]  speeches and fancy toast honoring those that died that day i'm margaret hell reporting for

[2:08:41.480 --> 2:08:45.720]  a sports event but there's a lot of analogies that could be drawn to it we're going to talk about
[2:08:45.720 --> 2:08:50.680]  that later but if you want to think of it in a sporting terms okay we're going to have a live
[2:08:50.680 --> 2:08:55.480]  commentary we're not going to get in the way we're going to be carrying the actual debate here but
[2:08:55.480 --> 2:09:01.240]  we will have some comments on the side kind of like commentators do for the football games occasionally
[2:09:02.040 --> 2:09:06.760]  but we will also have instant replays when there's something very big and i think this is going to
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:12.360]  be a momentous event everybody is talking about it everybody is looking forward to it again we're
[2:09:12.360 --> 2:09:18.360]  going to be covering that live monday night here on the info wars nightly news and joining us now
[2:09:18.360 --> 2:09:25.000]  is joel gilbert and he we talked to joel about a week ago because of the viral billboard campaign
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:31.400]  that was going on in time square joel had a billboard that they had purchased for i think
[2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:34.600]  is about a week in time square new york city he can correct me if that's wrong it was a digital
[2:09:34.600 --> 2:09:41.400]  billboard that was animated and they did a kind of a cartoon name there of donald trump as superman
[2:09:41.960 --> 2:09:46.360]  pointing out how he's jetting all over the country essentially uh but you know that not even making
[2:09:46.360 --> 2:09:50.120]  that point i mean it was just a visual it didn't say anything but it went viral they only spent
[2:09:50.120 --> 2:09:57.000]  25 000 and they got millions of dollars of publicity people all over the world were contacting joel
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:01.960]  and saying what is this about and he got to talk to them about why he would choose to put
[2:10:01.960 --> 2:10:05.640]  donald trump in there as superman but he's got another viral video and that's what we want to
[2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:11.080]  talk to him about today this is up on info wars dot com you can see the video link there the title
[2:10:11.080 --> 2:10:16.120]  of the article is hillary clinton promotes a maraphobia and so we want to talk to joel about
[2:10:16.120 --> 2:10:21.160]  this latest viral video thank you for joining us joel hey great to be back thank you you know
[2:10:21.880 --> 2:10:27.720]  the the left is always saying you're this phobic and that phobic and so forth and so on right
[2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:32.600]  i mean phobia was a uh psychological term said you were afraid of something or you just liked
[2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:36.920]  something or whatever so this is a great idea because we've got people who are afraid of america
[2:10:37.480 --> 2:10:43.080]  who hate america and so so tell us a little bit about uh maraphobia you know what what are these
[2:10:43.080 --> 2:10:47.400]  americabs like what do they believe we just go down your your points here in the article that you
[2:10:47.400 --> 2:10:54.600]  wrote here okay thanks well we we all saw the recent attacks on the american people by uh barack obama
[2:10:54.600 --> 2:11:01.880]  when he was in laos uh he told his audience that uh americans have a latent racism gene and that when
[2:11:01.880 --> 2:11:08.920]  we're low on cash we become xenophobic we start to dislike other people and people around us when
[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:15.240]  we get low on cash we saw hillary clinton's attack on half of america by saying that donald trump
[2:11:15.240 --> 2:11:22.680]  supporters were xenophobic islamic phobic homophobic is like one long word of phobias now
[2:11:22.680 --> 2:11:29.160]  the left is very comfortable smearing people uh saying they have a mental disorder and there it
[2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:34.920]  goes back in history a little bit because it really started installing this russia when when
[2:11:34.920 --> 2:11:41.480]  stalin's mad scientist decided that anyone who doesn't conform to collectivism and doesn't agree
[2:11:41.480 --> 2:11:46.920]  to the collective and that stalin is god on earth you get to be condemned to a psychiatric hospital
[2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:51.800]  because you have a mental disorder and of course by definition you'd be crazy to criticize stalin
[2:11:51.800 --> 2:11:57.000]  right so there you go it's circular this this is where it comes from so left ever since then
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:04.200]  the left has gleefully uh condemned anyone who doesn't agree with them as uh meeting psychiatric
[2:12:04.200 --> 2:12:11.560]  health so if you uh like barack obama up until 2012 barack obama was homophobic apparently
[2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:17.720]  if you uh according to obama if you don't support the progressive candidate you're xenophobic pretty
[2:12:17.720 --> 2:12:23.080]  soon if you're a woman who doesn't like men in your lady's room you're going to be transphobic
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:28.680]  you're going to have a bad case of transphobia yeah so uh you know i think pretty much we're all
[2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:35.960]  sick of this and uh sick of being smeared even the uh you know the birther and birtherism this was
[2:12:35.960 --> 2:12:40.680]  against people who simply asked the questions and so obama said he was born in kenya in his book
[2:12:41.640 --> 2:12:47.240]  pamphlet he said he grew up in indonesia and his father's from kenya people ask a logical question
[2:12:47.240 --> 2:12:51.560]  well why don't you release your birth certificate and your college records and he said no so you get
[2:12:51.560 --> 2:12:58.200]  smeared as if you're crazy you know anyway he releases a forged document like uh sheriff our pile
[2:12:58.200 --> 2:13:03.080]  pointed out hey you release a forged document it's got multiple layers here like photoshop
[2:13:03.080 --> 2:13:09.160]  it's obviously uh photoshopped it's got anachronisms and terms that are there it's got uh fonts that
[2:13:09.160 --> 2:13:14.520]  don't match that are anachronistic as well uh this is obviously a forgery so please explain that to
[2:13:14.520 --> 2:13:18.920]  us i mean we just want an explanation you know that's why they call us uh conspiracy theorists
[2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:23.560]  we're not conspiracy theorists we just don't uh we're not gallible we won't take anything that
[2:13:23.560 --> 2:13:28.040]  you put out there simply because your authority figures we're going to look at it and say is
[2:13:28.040 --> 2:13:33.320]  does this add up uh no no two plus two is not equal to five and so then they call us conspiracy
[2:13:33.320 --> 2:13:37.800]  theories you know a lot of people questioned when we saw hillary clinton feigning saw people on social
[2:13:37.800 --> 2:13:44.280]  media say uh did she actually uh have an overexposure of patriotism because it wasn't really that hot
[2:13:44.280 --> 2:13:50.600]  that day you know it was just overexposed patriotism on the anniversary of 9-11 right she affected her
[2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:56.040]  well look uh the progressors like to present a fantasy the Stalin's fantasy of soviet Russia
[2:13:56.040 --> 2:14:00.920]  was the government would own all the property uh would control everything and you would go to work
[2:14:00.920 --> 2:14:04.840]  in these factory jobs that don't produce anything and you're going to be the happiest people on
[2:14:04.840 --> 2:14:09.960]  earth if you don't buy into the fantasy you get sent to the psychiatric court you must be crazy
[2:14:09.960 --> 2:14:15.320]  same thing with obama's uh birth certificate that he eventually produced it was a fantasy it was a
[2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:20.760]  forgery and if you don't believe it you're a birther so that's the that's the mo so anyway
[2:14:20.760 --> 2:14:25.720]  i i realized that when you really look at what these people believe and their their thought
[2:14:25.720 --> 2:14:30.280]  process i thought it would be good to to brand it brand them with the term and i thought of
[2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:36.840]  a marophobia that uh because progressivism is the only real mental illness to speak up
[2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:41.560]  so when the democrats banish american flags from their convention as they did
[2:14:41.560 --> 2:14:47.080]  or condemn the police uh i came up with an idea let's just point our finger at them
[2:14:47.720 --> 2:14:55.160]  and uh scream and yell a marathon you're a marophobic that's great uh you know i guess you
[2:14:55.160 --> 2:15:00.440]  know they they they fear america but they like certain things right they like globalism maybe
[2:15:00.440 --> 2:15:07.240]  we should call them global files they're marophobic and global affiliate here what let me run down
[2:15:07.240 --> 2:15:12.280]  with a what they like and don't like first of all they really have disdain for american values
[2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:17.640]  they believe our character is racist and selfish rather than tolerant and generous
[2:15:17.640 --> 2:15:22.360]  they're very uncomfortable in the presence of the american flag and they do consider themselves
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:28.360]  morally superior uh americabs also blame america for all international conflicts
[2:15:28.360 --> 2:15:33.880]  even in remote regions of the world they think america is the culprit uh they believe we were
[2:15:33.880 --> 2:15:38.600]  a big colonial power and we still are even though we were actually a british colony
[2:15:39.400 --> 2:15:45.480]  marophobes deify globalism and they hate when our allies act independently like britain and the
[2:15:45.480 --> 2:15:50.440]  and the brexit vote or israel defending themselves from from terrorism the things that
[2:15:50.440 --> 2:15:57.080]  marophobes like they love people who conform they love united nations uh international
[2:15:57.080 --> 2:16:03.720]  criminal court they love uh government agencies that highly regulate americans like the epa
[2:16:04.360 --> 2:16:11.880]  irs fema fda and americabs trust government and government elites over their own judgment
[2:16:12.520 --> 2:16:18.360]  and the reason for all of this is they they believe in the fantasy of an imaginary utopia
[2:16:18.360 --> 2:16:23.720]  and when america falls short of this fantasy of this perfect society this perfect collective
[2:16:23.720 --> 2:16:29.480]  they conclude while america is evil and so we want to bring it down we want to turn it upside down
[2:16:30.040 --> 2:16:35.240]  they want a society where truth and lies are indistinguishable and that's why they promote
[2:16:35.240 --> 2:16:40.840]  blatant falsehoods against the police uh americabs also believe in open borders because it's our
[2:16:40.840 --> 2:16:46.680]  boundaries that protect our hated american character and independent national identity
[2:16:46.680 --> 2:16:54.840]  uh so these are the the very backwards ideology of amerifos but you can see how this amerophobia
[2:16:55.480 --> 2:17:00.360]  i talk about it in my article on info wars it really was introduced into the u.s almost as a
[2:17:00.360 --> 2:17:06.120]  mental disease in the 1930s uh common turn communist international through their affiliated
[2:17:06.120 --> 2:17:12.360]  chicago cp usa communist party usa they realized that the marxist philosophy of total government
[2:17:12.360 --> 2:17:17.240]  control and collectivism was completely incompatible with the american way of life
[2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:24.280]  of free markets individual rights and and open government so they started a disinformation
[2:17:24.280 --> 2:17:30.760]  campaign disinformation and they promoted it through their chicago office the united states
[2:17:30.760 --> 2:17:38.120]  is oppressive unjust and corrupt and over the years this amerophobia permeated our entertainment
[2:17:38.120 --> 2:17:44.920]  business universities and journalism finally finding its way into a mainstream political party
[2:17:44.920 --> 2:17:52.040]  and today the uh democrat party is a radical amerophobic socialist party their entire platform
[2:17:52.040 --> 2:17:56.680]  their presidential candidates everything about them is amerophobic you know you mentioned
[2:17:56.680 --> 2:18:01.560]  entertainment and it reminds me of the movie hails cesar by the cohen brothers uh my favorite
[2:18:01.560 --> 2:18:09.080]  filmmakers and uh central to that they go back to the 1950s and and i i really it didn't do really
[2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:13.160]  well at the movie theaters but i thought it was really funny my wife and i both enjoyed it because
[2:18:13.160 --> 2:18:18.120]  it went back to all the different uh almost stereotypes of hollywood back in the 1950s but
[2:18:18.120 --> 2:18:25.240]  at the core of the plot are all these communist writers in hollywood who see it as their mission
[2:18:25.800 --> 2:18:31.080]  to change america to a communist country by using movies and that's originally you know there was a
[2:18:31.080 --> 2:18:37.720]  truth at the a very very hard truth a very large truth at the bottom of the search for communist
[2:18:37.720 --> 2:18:42.280]  you know they always want to say well macartheism is a witch hunt and so forth and so on but at the
[2:18:42.280 --> 2:18:47.400]  at the core they really were a communist in hollywood who really saw it as their mission
[2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:53.720]  to change america and to use the movies to do that well today uh in my article i say well how
[2:18:53.720 --> 2:19:00.280]  can a person possibly become a marophobic now i'm from a small town in east tennessee i never grew
[2:19:00.280 --> 2:19:06.680]  up with uh any a marophobic people we we believed in uh you know god and country and hard work
[2:19:06.680 --> 2:19:13.400]  and most of america believes in that but people that grew up in a marophobic families uh red
[2:19:13.400 --> 2:19:18.040]  diaper babies like barack obama you've seen my film dreams of my real father where i show his real
[2:19:18.040 --> 2:19:23.880]  father was a communist party soviet agent named frank marshall davis david axelrod both parents
[2:19:23.880 --> 2:19:32.680]  communist party members valerie jared communist family uh so people that watch today the millennials
[2:19:32.680 --> 2:19:38.200]  and generations since the 70s if you grow up watching us news media if you study at a us
[2:19:38.200 --> 2:19:44.200]  university you're going to be exposed to hollywood movies and tv that are all controlled by liberals
[2:19:44.760 --> 2:19:49.640]  and promote a marophobic messages yeah absolutely stay with us we're going to be right back with
[2:19:49.640 --> 2:19:55.880]  joel gilbert has a great article at info wars dot com hillary clinton promotes a marophobia she's
[2:19:55.880 --> 2:20:01.080]  probably the best example of this new term he coined i think it's a great term she's a marophobic

[2:22:11.160 --> 2:22:16.280]  oxygen deficiency dr. Joanna budwig built upon the work of dr. warburg and discovered how to
[2:22:16.280 --> 2:22:21.000]  feed the cells to overcome this oxygen deficiency she found that it was a sulfur in the cottage
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:25.560]  cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax oil that the flax oil would become emulsified
[2:22:25.560 --> 2:22:30.440]  and more readily absorbed flax oil delivered in this manner was able to restore oxygen transfer

[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:18.680]  welcome back to the alex joneshaw and david and we're talking to joel gilbert he has an
[2:24:18.680 --> 2:24:24.760]  article on info wars dot com today hillary clinton promotes a mera phobia a great new term that
[2:24:24.760 --> 2:24:30.600]  joel coined uh because they're always talking about we have this phobia that phobia is xenophobic
[2:24:30.600 --> 2:24:37.800]  homophobic so forth uh they're afraid of america and they hate america that's the bottom line it's a
[2:24:37.800 --> 2:24:43.720]  great term to use you know joel when i look at this i and and we look at how obama is promoting a
[2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:48.280]  trans agenda with the bathrooms and other issues you know the federal government coming in and
[2:24:48.280 --> 2:24:54.920]  telling us how we're going to structure bathrooms in private and private property even you know in
[2:24:54.920 --> 2:25:00.280]  churches and and so forth not even on limiting themselves to uh public bathrooms but you know
[2:25:00.280 --> 2:25:04.360]  i look at this i think maybe we should start calling these people trans nationalists because
[2:25:04.360 --> 2:25:08.920]  they were born american or british or german but they see themselves as globalists you know
[2:25:10.520 --> 2:25:16.600]  let's give it to them they're trans nationalists well because of their dislike for america they
[2:25:16.600 --> 2:25:23.720]  start to look abroad to see where the perfect society might be in the 30s and 40s 50s uh
[2:25:23.720 --> 2:25:27.640]  there wasn't a whole lot of news reporters in stalinist russia where they were throwing people
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:32.360]  in in gulags and collective farms and starving people to death and murdering 20 million of
[2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:38.760]  their own people in peacetime so you had american communists including the the black bolsheviks out
[2:25:38.760 --> 2:25:43.320]  of chicago which obama's father frank marshall davis was one of them they believe that the
[2:25:43.320 --> 2:25:48.360]  soviet union was this perfect society they're always looking elsewhere whether it's uh an
[2:25:48.360 --> 2:25:54.600]  imaginary utopia or or uh heaven on earth the communist system which is in fact a complete
[2:25:55.800 --> 2:26:01.240]  disaster that leads to economic failure and biological destruction of all the societies
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:07.720]  that have adopted this also in the article there's a video which uh is hillary clinton is an
[2:26:07.720 --> 2:26:13.240]  americope it's a four-minute animated video which uh yes and that's a great video we didn't play it because
[2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:17.560]  it's difficult the the joke is difficult to get across on radio because what it is it's word
[2:26:17.560 --> 2:26:22.680]  association and when you come through you've got hillary clinton and a padded cell and an insane
[2:26:22.680 --> 2:26:27.480]  asylum and they're saying we're going to try to help you with this americobia as they throw up images
[2:26:28.200 --> 2:26:32.840]  she tells you what she thinks of that particular image and it's hilarious it's a great but all
[2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:37.160]  you hear if we played on the radio is just her saying her comment and you don't get the visual
[2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:41.880]  joke which is which is really funny people really need to watch that that's embedded in the article
[2:26:41.880 --> 2:26:47.000]  on info wars hillary clinton promotes the merifobia right so you'll it's kind of like a rorschach test
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:52.680]  we we show we show a guy holding two ducks he's a hunter he's holding two ducks and hillary yells at him
[2:26:53.400 --> 2:26:59.800]  mass shooter we we have sat there's santa claus on his sleigh in the snow and she yells climate
[2:26:59.800 --> 2:27:05.720]  denier exactly that's great it it goes on it it goes on and on so it's it's really going viral so
[2:27:05.720 --> 2:27:10.440]  people should check that out on info wars dot com oh yeah yeah that that's an awesome video well
[2:27:10.440 --> 2:27:15.960]  you know we look at this and we we talk about how they don't like america they love other countries
[2:27:15.960 --> 2:27:21.560]  there's a story on politico uh joel obama in an awkward twist they say becomes saudi arabias
[2:27:21.560 --> 2:27:28.200]  defender and i'm looking at this it's like becomes saudi arabia this guy began by literally bowing
[2:27:28.200 --> 2:27:33.880]  and scraping to these people and he's going to go out that way as well but it's that's what it's
[2:27:33.880 --> 2:27:39.720]  going to be well we remember you know recently we had obama doing a press conference in cuba with
[2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:46.760]  raul castrow the butcher and the a few reporters at least one reporter said hey uh to obama hey
[2:27:46.760 --> 2:27:52.120]  what about all the oppression and deprivation here in cuba and he said oh well they have a different
[2:27:52.120 --> 2:27:58.520]  system yeah imagine imagine imagine instead of saying they have an inferior system that oppresses
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:04.680]  has oppressed it people oppressed people and caused the cuban people and their economy and life to be
[2:28:04.680 --> 2:28:10.600]  miserable for the past 60 years uh he makes excuses and they got different system it's a system of
[2:28:10.600 --> 2:28:14.440]  oppression which i want to bring to you by the way but the good news is they have all these classic
[2:28:14.440 --> 2:28:19.000]  cars because they haven't been working in new cars since the 1950s right that's going to be the the
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:24.840]  gym and the economy when they sell those things off worldwide right well this is the fantasy it's
[2:28:24.840 --> 2:28:29.960]  the leftist fantasy of some perfect society that's not america they're just absolutely ignorant if
[2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:35.240]  they would look at the facts and compare america to the reality of the rest of the world uh they would
[2:28:35.240 --> 2:28:40.440]  conclude that america is the greatest country possibly in the history of the world but they're so
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:47.000]  miserable looking for this perfect utopia they want uh to reject everything great about america
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:53.960]  our flag our freedoms our right to bear arms our free speech and uh hillary by the way uh
[2:28:53.960 --> 2:28:58.920]  wanted to add something a little different that i'm convinced that if she becomes incapacitated
[2:28:58.920 --> 2:29:05.960]  as president in any way uh i believe huma abedin will be the acting essential president hillary
[2:29:05.960 --> 2:29:11.240]  will hold up in the white house and huma will essentially uh run the country i think it's a
[2:29:11.240 --> 2:29:16.680]  very real possibility if they if uh if hillary wins well she's kind of a muslim brotherhood
[2:29:16.680 --> 2:29:20.200]  mole that's been in there for quite a while but you know it's i guess she would see herself
[2:29:20.200 --> 2:29:25.800]  in the role of as first lady kind of like hillary was to bill clinton when hillary tried to usurp
[2:29:25.800 --> 2:29:32.920]  authority there uh very very great article and a great video go to uh you can see that hillary
[2:29:32.920 --> 2:29:38.920]  clinton promotes a marifobia another viral video by joel gilbert hilarious video you have to see
[2:29:38.920 --> 2:29:42.520]  it we can play it on the radio for you because the joke doesn't work in the radio but pass it
[2:29:42.520 --> 2:29:46.920]  around to your friends they all need to see this thank you so much joel another a great job i'm
[2:29:46.920 --> 2:29:51.000]  putting together a viral video stay with us we'll be right back when we talk about the hatred
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:57.720]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:30:01.720 --> 2:30:06.360]  seattle mariners catcher steve clavinger has fallen under heavy scrutiny after two tweaks he
[2:30:06.360 --> 2:30:10.920]  made thursday in response to the events in charlotte north carolina wednesday night but he went further
[2:30:10.920 --> 2:30:15.720]  than just the charlotte riots and said this black people beating whites when a thug got shot holding
[2:30:15.720 --> 2:30:21.080]  a gun by a black officer this cracks me up keep kneeling for the anthem regardless that what he
[2:30:21.080 --> 2:30:28.040]  tweeted is true he is white so he is racist and he must apologize he also tweeted blm is pathetic
[2:30:28.040 --> 2:30:33.320]  obama is pathetic everyone involved should be locked behind bars like animals now he is just
[2:30:33.320 --> 2:30:38.440]  sharing his opinion though i think the animal's common is what triggered people but again he's not
[2:30:38.440 --> 2:30:43.560]  allowed that opinion because he's white you could actually read those tweets and they could come from
[2:30:43.560 --> 2:30:49.560]  a black person or a white person because there is no racism just objective fact and opinion don't
[2:30:49.560 --> 2:30:54.680]  worry though the seattle mariners are very disappointed this proves once again you're

[2:33:20.520 --> 2:33:28.200]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight and joining us now
[2:33:28.920 --> 2:33:33.560]  we're going to be going to him in just a moment is uh joe begs our reporter and charlotte he's
[2:33:33.560 --> 2:33:39.160]  going to tell us what happened last night and you know when i look at this uh it's
[2:33:39.160 --> 2:33:44.360]  disturbing to me on a number of different levels we've had the tulsa officer who shot
[2:33:44.360 --> 2:33:50.520]  terrence crutcher charged now a first degree manslaughter and i i agree with that and i think that
[2:33:50.520 --> 2:33:56.200]  you know for too long we have seen the police who used to be referred to as peace officers who
[2:33:56.200 --> 2:34:02.600]  used to walk the beat now we see them being used as meter maids instead provoking conflicts and then
[2:34:02.600 --> 2:34:08.760]  when uh there is a conflict they're not trained properly to deal with it or not physically capable
[2:34:08.760 --> 2:34:13.480]  of dealing with it they're fearful they act like a barney fife and that's i believe uh what was in
[2:34:13.480 --> 2:34:19.960]  get involved in this shooting in tulsa but on the other side of this we've got hillary clinton
[2:34:20.520 --> 2:34:26.680]  tweeting out about the police shooting in tulsa as the situation was developing in charlotte
[2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:32.360]  using that like a dog whistle essentially throwing a molotov cocktail into charlotte
[2:34:32.920 --> 2:34:40.120]  where is the leadership so all we've seen from obama is division divide and conquer for political
[2:34:40.120 --> 2:34:45.080]  purposes and that's what we're seeing from hillary clinton she is willing to burn the city down
[2:34:45.640 --> 2:34:50.040]  as a demagogue so for her own personal benefit just like a nero i'm going to go to joe bigs
[2:34:50.040 --> 2:34:55.240]  in just a moment before we do real quickly i want to remind you that we have extended our sales
[2:34:55.240 --> 2:35:01.480]  for secret 12 as well as supermail vitality at info wars life dot com both of those are 20
[2:35:01.480 --> 2:35:07.240]  percent off again supermail vitality you've heard tim kennedy talk about how valuable that has been
[2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:13.160]  for his training you can read the reviews the five-star reviews about supermail vitality at info
[2:35:13.160 --> 2:35:19.960]  wars life dot com and also same thing with secret 12 our vitamin b12 formulation there are over a
[2:35:19.960 --> 2:35:24.840]  thousand reviews now of b12 because that's one of secret 12 that's one of our earlier products
[2:35:25.400 --> 2:35:32.360]  and uh 4.8 out of 5 read what people say about that read how it helps them and of course if you
[2:35:32.360 --> 2:35:38.680]  don't understand the benefit of vitamin b12 do some research on your own as well see the forms
[2:35:38.680 --> 2:35:44.360]  that we have of this and again it's in liquid form no painful injections required to get a b12
[2:35:44.360 --> 2:35:50.440]  supplementation and we have put secret 12 our b12 formulation as well as supermail vitality both of
[2:35:50.440 --> 2:35:54.760]  those are still 20 off we've extended those sales but they're not going to be we're not going to be
[2:35:54.760 --> 2:36:00.040]  able to extend those very much longer and still meet the commitments that we have to our people
[2:36:00.040 --> 2:36:05.000]  who have signed up for auto ship who and if you do sign up for auto ship then you never run out of
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:09.240]  supply and you get a 10 discount when you sign up for that we have a lot of people who do that
[2:36:09.240 --> 2:36:14.040]  that's why we have to end this sale soon so we can meet those demands for that again both of
[2:36:14.040 --> 2:36:19.800]  these products 20 off at info wars life dot com that will be ending very shortly now joining us
[2:36:19.800 --> 2:36:26.600]  now is joe biggs and charlotte welcome joe hey thanks for having me on david before we get into
[2:36:26.600 --> 2:36:30.440]  what happened last night i'd like to really talk about some of the events that unfolded today
[2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:40.120]  we have the wife of pete lamont scott she has released footage now of her from her cell phone
[2:36:40.120 --> 2:36:45.400]  before and leading up to the fact when her husband is shot and killed now in the footage you can hear
[2:36:45.400 --> 2:36:51.080]  her scream or hear the police screaming drop your gun drop your gun but meanwhile during that entire
[2:36:51.080 --> 2:36:55.160]  time she's commenting as well going he doesn't have a gun he doesn't have a gun and i believe
[2:36:55.160 --> 2:37:02.040]  she says something about how he has tbi and he just took his medication so this video only fuels
[2:37:02.040 --> 2:37:06.920]  the flames just like with what hillard clinton said you know she wants this place to blow up
[2:37:06.920 --> 2:37:11.160]  essentially because it's going to take heat off of her coming into this first debate and take the
[2:37:11.160 --> 2:37:15.400]  eyes off of her so she could care less if charlotte burns to the ground she'll sit there and spark
[2:37:15.400 --> 2:37:20.840]  more racism just to go ahead and use that as a way to hide under that for a while so she can
[2:37:20.840 --> 2:37:25.400]  not get any kind of negative media coverage which is what she's been getting a lot of lately you
[2:37:25.400 --> 2:37:30.200]  know and with this video coming out today i think that's really going to spark stuff up the minnesota
[2:37:30.200 --> 2:37:35.000]  vikings will be flying into town today and all of their fans and they're playing the carolina panthers
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:39.880]  here at home sunday now the nfl has been talking about whether or not to move or postpone this game
[2:37:39.880 --> 2:37:43.720]  due to the tensions that have been going on but the chief of police has come out and begged
[2:37:43.720 --> 2:37:46.920]  him to stay and it looks like it's going to continue to happen so you're going to have a lot
[2:37:46.920 --> 2:37:51.800]  of people coming in from out of state a lot of people that are coming up here in this area that's
[2:37:51.800 --> 2:37:56.760]  already hot and i'm standing at the epicenter where it is a building that is usually very vibrant
[2:37:56.760 --> 2:38:02.440]  there's bars there's restaurants there's movie theaters cvs is you know food stores all this
[2:38:02.440 --> 2:38:06.680]  different stuff and it's all shut down right now it's all being repaired and right behind me over
[2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:11.720]  my right shoulder is the omni hotel where the second night of protests really sparked and
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:16.520]  turned into violent chaos here on the streets and that's where a man was shot and killed and
[2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:21.320]  they actually caught that guy with cctv footage that the police was able to gather from cameras in
[2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:27.160]  the surrounding area so with that being done i was out last night with the protesters walking
[2:38:27.160 --> 2:38:32.360]  around they all believe that this was a cop who shot this guy well the police have now found
[2:38:32.360 --> 2:38:36.920]  footage that shows that it was a civilian a protester who shot this guy and killed him
[2:38:36.920 --> 2:38:42.520]  and now we have rumors going around still that uh kiefelman scott had no gun that this was only
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:47.160]  a book and now this footage comes out where you can't see the gun but you hear the cops screaming
[2:38:47.160 --> 2:38:52.440]  she had or he has a gun and she's saying he doesn't own a gun so i think it's going to make tonight
[2:38:52.440 --> 2:38:57.480]  just really very unpredictable last night wasn't really bad but it definitely got crazy at one
[2:38:57.480 --> 2:39:03.080]  point in time when protesters took to uh 277 it's an interstate right over here to my right
[2:39:03.080 --> 2:39:07.240]  and they ascended down in the road stopped the traffic just before midnight right police came
[2:39:07.240 --> 2:39:11.880]  in started shooting pepper bullets and then they charged it myself in a group of people
[2:39:11.880 --> 2:39:16.520]  pushed us up a giant embankment and i started getting pepper sprayed in the face my skin is
[2:39:16.520 --> 2:39:21.560]  still burning and uh my eyes were swollen till about eight o'clock this morning so definitely
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:26.280]  heated up for a little bit last night but we were told in the national press that everything was
[2:39:26.280 --> 2:39:31.560]  just really calm last night they said there were small groups out but i mean there were thousands
[2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:35.560]  of people out at one point and they were walking around it was funny the video you're seeing right
[2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:40.840]  now is of outside of the prison that's downtown as protesters were marching down this road
[2:39:40.840 --> 2:39:44.760]  cellmates inside were flicking their lights on and off banging on the windows screaming at the
[2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:49.640]  protesters i'm assuming in solidarity or something like that glad that they're out there you know
[2:39:49.640 --> 2:39:53.960]  marching against you know this police brutality that they're out here for but you know at the end
[2:39:53.960 --> 2:39:57.640]  of the day we keep getting these false narratives that are spun up on social media and then it
[2:39:57.640 --> 2:40:02.200]  becomes truth and everyone takes to the streets and they're fighting and they're becoming violent
[2:40:02.200 --> 2:40:06.600]  and they're assaulting people white people are being beaten and dragged through parking lots because
[2:40:06.600 --> 2:40:12.360]  they thought this was a racist issue and it's not a racist issue it is a black cop who shot a black
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:16.600]  man the police say he has a gun there's no definitive evidence of that yet they have not released the
[2:40:16.600 --> 2:40:22.280]  footage that's important right there it was a black cop who shot a black man the chief of police
[2:40:22.280 --> 2:40:28.120]  is black the mayor of the city is a democrat and yet they've turned this into a race riot and when
[2:40:28.120 --> 2:40:32.760]  we look at hillary clinton absolute silence for at least uh 24 i don't know if she's still i haven't
[2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:39.320]  looked uh at her at her twitter feed lately but she was silent for at least uh uh 24 36 hours after
[2:40:39.320 --> 2:40:45.160]  this except for the tweet about the situation in tulsa saying yet again a black man has been shot
[2:40:45.160 --> 2:40:51.320]  by an unarmed black man has been shot by a cop making it a racial issue that's what she wants is a
[2:40:51.320 --> 2:40:56.360]  race war and that's how she is uh portraying this now you know when you're looking at this and we
[2:40:56.360 --> 2:41:00.840]  got that video that's come out have the police released any video of uh from their perspective
[2:41:00.840 --> 2:41:05.880]  from their cameras because i guess if the if the if the wife is saying he hasn't got a gun he hasn't
[2:41:05.880 --> 2:41:10.760]  got a gun but we've seen a third party eyewitness say you know he took a picture of the gun that
[2:41:10.760 --> 2:41:16.040]  was there on the sidewalk i don't know if that was a drop gun but again that wouldn't be a racial
[2:41:16.040 --> 2:41:20.760]  issue that would still be a police issue uh nobody is talking hillary's not talking about any
[2:41:20.760 --> 2:41:25.000]  concrete reforms that they would do about the police she wants to have a race war here but
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:29.240]  how does it have the police released any video of their own well here's a critical part of the
[2:41:29.240 --> 2:41:33.560]  whole thing uh the police have not released the footage but what they did is they allowed the
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:39.400]  family of people more scott to come in and witness the footage for themselves and i got this information
[2:41:39.400 --> 2:41:43.640]  from some journalists who have been here for the last few days who know people here locally within
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:48.680]  the police force and they said that they sat down they let them watch this footage and at the very
[2:41:48.680 --> 2:41:55.000]  end they said do you think that our shooting justifies based off the footage you shot and the
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:59.560]  family looked at the the police officers and said no comment and just walked away so that kind of
[2:42:00.200 --> 2:42:03.720]  makes you kind of think well maybe they didn't see what they wanted to see you know because
[2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:09.640]  when you look at this uh the wife's footage she's back away and all she all you can see is the cops
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:13.800]  yelling or hear them yelling and then she finally moves up after he's been shot and is on the ground
[2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:18.440]  so there's still a lot left you know a lot left to be unseen we don't know what's really going on
[2:42:18.440 --> 2:42:23.480]  yet but based off of the family's reaction the fact that i don't know man i think tonight's
[2:42:23.480 --> 2:42:29.000]  still going to be it's gonna it's going to pop up again a little bit i would like to see if
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:34.520]  hillary says that she wants to be a president to everyone i would like to see her try to diffuse
[2:42:34.520 --> 2:42:39.720]  this situation instead of using it for political gain because it's the racism narrative there we
[2:42:39.720 --> 2:42:46.040]  have police that are engaged in unjustified violence and excessive use of force and shootings and so
[2:42:46.040 --> 2:42:51.400]  forth and that needs to be investigated she should call for calm until it is investigated i mean we've
[2:42:51.400 --> 2:42:57.160]  seen a picture of the gun on the ground i don't know uh if he had a gun that was registered to him
[2:42:57.160 --> 2:43:01.320]  or if they're saying that was an unregistered gun if it's an unregistered gun uh and they're
[2:43:01.320 --> 2:43:05.160]  saying that he didn't have it i mean they need to work that out we need to see the footage from
[2:43:05.160 --> 2:43:10.360]  all the different angles and that really i think is is something that the uh city government they're
[2:43:10.360 --> 2:43:14.920]  really ought to do is put out their footage and say here's our cards let's let's stop the riot but
[2:43:14.920 --> 2:43:21.160]  meanwhile she is using this and black lives matter is using this to promote a race war every time we
[2:43:21.160 --> 2:43:26.760]  have a situation like this especially if they're saying ambiguity they always seize on those particular
[2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:31.720]  issues and build those up because that's the narrative that they want is that the police
[2:43:32.280 --> 2:43:37.000]  are against uh against black people and so therefore you ought to go out and attack
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:41.880]  unarmed white people who don't have anything to do with the police that's the solution this is
[2:43:41.880 --> 2:43:47.960]  this has already been a battleground for lgbt rights you know uh the nba playoffs or whatever
[2:43:47.960 --> 2:43:51.000]  they pulled out they're not going to be doing that stuff anymore because of the transgender
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:56.680]  bathroom laws you know but they're moving joe they're moving those games to places where they
[2:43:56.680 --> 2:44:00.520]  don't have homosexual marriage where they don't have rights for transgenders where they don't have
[2:44:00.520 --> 2:44:05.880]  rights for homosexuals that's where they're moving these games down into the virgin islands and and
[2:44:05.880 --> 2:44:10.600]  other islands where they're trans or they're they're transferring these basketball games so
[2:44:10.600 --> 2:44:15.400]  so forth they're moving them to those areas uh and they have less legal protection there than
[2:44:15.400 --> 2:44:21.240]  they do in uh north carolina by far yeah i mean that it doesn't make sense why this is all happening
[2:44:21.240 --> 2:44:26.280]  but you know for some reason this place has been chosen to be the next Ferguson and you know from
[2:44:26.280 --> 2:44:30.200]  what we've seen the first two nights it's definitely been worse because people have been shot and
[2:44:30.200 --> 2:44:37.480]  killed now you know uh the the interesting thing about charlotte is the amount of false narratives
[2:44:37.480 --> 2:44:43.320]  that are being pushed on social media and how they're becoming so they're becoming truth in fact
[2:44:43.320 --> 2:44:46.920]  and people last night were screaming and i could hear the rhetoric and everyone's like
[2:44:46.920 --> 2:44:52.760]  he had a book and you know this and that and you know that the guy wasn't shot by a protester the
[2:44:52.760 --> 2:44:57.160]  other night he was shot by a cop with a rubber bullet and i'm like well a rubber bullet doesn't
[2:44:57.160 --> 2:45:02.040]  kill anybody that sure as hell doesn't leave a puddle of blood all over the ground so these people
[2:45:02.040 --> 2:45:07.400]  are completely believing this false narrative and they're willing to come out here and be violent
[2:45:07.400 --> 2:45:13.320]  and fight for it yeah basically what what they're doing is they're creating a they're creating a
[2:45:13.320 --> 2:45:20.200]  mob mentality and hillary clinton is involved very deep in this and i can't believe well i can't
[2:45:20.200 --> 2:45:24.520]  believe that conservative media isn't calling her out more on it i know that cnn and the mainstream
[2:45:24.520 --> 2:45:27.800]  media aren't going to call her out on that but one of the things that i thought was interesting was
[2:45:27.800 --> 2:45:33.160]  the fact that 70 percent of the people that have been arrested as we learned today 70 percent are
[2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:38.360]  from out of town out of state i think yeah i got people from uh south Carolina and then i heard a
[2:45:38.360 --> 2:45:43.240]  large number of these people came in from Atlanta george as well people came in on buses and some
[2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:47.960]  of the trains there's a train that comes through here and uh you know that's been the word so far
[2:45:47.960 --> 2:45:51.720]  so one of the guys that works for the police department here made a statement and said when
[2:45:51.720 --> 2:45:56.520]  they ran all the ids they believe that you know most of these people from out of town
[2:45:56.520 --> 2:46:00.920]  only to come here to start violence and like that that's one of the main reasons why i said tonight
[2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:05.320]  i believe might pop off again because you have a lot more out of towners coming in for this football
[2:46:05.320 --> 2:46:10.200]  game you know a lot of people are scared to be out so it's pretty dead at night time this the
[2:46:10.200 --> 2:46:14.280]  epicenter right now has a few restaurants that are open to my right but they have to close everything
[2:46:14.280 --> 2:46:19.320]  down at four everything's boarded up most of the banks are closed down there's only a few businesses
[2:46:19.320 --> 2:46:24.280]  that are out most people that are downtown right now are journalists uh or people from out of town
[2:46:24.280 --> 2:46:28.520]  who want to take pictures of all the chaos that's happened and construction crews trying to rebuild
[2:46:28.520 --> 2:46:32.920]  everything really quickly before you know it gets out of hand again so they're boarding up all these
[2:46:32.920 --> 2:46:37.080]  windows i mean it definitely doesn't have the vibe that charlotte that he used to when i lived here
[2:46:37.640 --> 2:46:42.280]  and of course we have uh rachel madel and others saying that they're just cleaning the streets
[2:46:42.280 --> 2:46:46.840]  they're not real looters they're they're protesters and not only that they're street cleaners at the
[2:46:46.840 --> 2:46:51.720]  same time what kind of destruction have you seen there because we've we've seen that they've uh
[2:46:52.280 --> 2:46:57.480]  you know burned down some buildings they looted even the nascar museum that was there in charlotte
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:47:02.280]  have you taken any pictures or any reports about what you see in that area what can you tell us
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:07.240]  yeah a lot of the businesses have been boarded up um right here to my right is a place called
[2:47:07.240 --> 2:47:11.960]  the epicenter and like i said a lot of nightclubs uh gas state or not gas stations like convenience
[2:47:11.960 --> 2:47:17.560]  stores they're all boarded up on the inside the outside part here is this is a mexican cantina
[2:47:17.560 --> 2:47:23.960]  it's not boarded up yet but on the inside all those places are boarded up there's a street down here
[2:47:23.960 --> 2:47:28.200]  further away about a block down and then off to the right almost every business is boarded up
[2:47:28.200 --> 2:47:33.080]  where it was busted in and it's pretty sporadic because the police were moving them around different
[2:47:33.080 --> 2:47:37.400]  sections and then as they were able to lose the police they would just start riding in that area
[2:47:37.400 --> 2:47:41.400]  and breaking into buildings so you've got a lot of action that happened down this way the front
[2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:46.680]  windows were busted out in the omni hotel right over here as well so i mean it definitely does
[2:47:46.680 --> 2:47:52.920]  not look like uh my charlotte that i grew up in that i'm from it definitely looks like a war zone
[2:47:52.920 --> 2:47:58.840]  it looks like the gaza strip almost now we we've talked about how the people that have been arrested
[2:47:58.840 --> 2:48:05.160]  the majority of them 70 have been uh even out of state what about peaceful protesters uh i'm sure
[2:48:05.160 --> 2:48:09.160]  you've seen some peaceful protesters there what are they saying that they want or are they just
[2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:15.400]  talking about this in terms of uh black lives matter and making this a racism uh issue or are
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:20.200]  they talking about doing some real reforms for everybody they had a lot of local community
[2:48:20.200 --> 2:48:24.360]  leaders that were in town last night leading some of these marches uh at the beginning of the night
[2:48:24.360 --> 2:48:29.320]  it started off as like sporadic little marches here and there and eventually around 11 o'clock
[2:48:29.320 --> 2:48:33.240]  at night i believe they all came together there was thousands of people out here in the streets
[2:48:33.240 --> 2:48:39.800]  and they had some uh older uh black gentlemen that were community leaders that were leading more like
[2:48:40.360 --> 2:48:45.720]  black lives matter type protests they kept screaming hands up don't shoot uh resistance or revolution
[2:48:45.720 --> 2:48:51.080]  is beautiful but really nothing about how to fix anything or any of the issues they did everything
[2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:55.960]  they could at every intersection to keep the peace with all the uh the younger individuals that were
[2:48:55.960 --> 2:49:00.760]  in the the crowd protesting but these guys that were still in the crowd were still throwing water
[2:49:00.760 --> 2:49:05.320]  bottles at the police officers that were on their bicycles and trying to spark something so you still
[2:49:05.320 --> 2:49:09.640]  have agitators in these groups they're trying to set something off because they know once it happens
[2:49:09.640 --> 2:49:12.920]  and they'll be able to run around again i've already had three or four people approach me
[2:49:12.920 --> 2:49:17.080]  going hey i think it's going to pop off again tonight make sure if it does go inside the stores
[2:49:17.080 --> 2:49:21.480]  and get as much as you can you know so that's definitely the mentality right now that's happening
[2:49:21.480 --> 2:49:25.160]  here you know you've got some people that want to make it all about race and then you've got some
[2:49:25.160 --> 2:49:28.920]  that just want to come out here and take advantage of the situation and release anger that they've
[2:49:28.920 --> 2:49:32.440]  had pent up for a long time and they know they're not going to be caught you know nine times out
[2:49:32.440 --> 2:49:35.560]  of ten or anything's going to happen to them and they're going to run back and play on their new
[2:49:35.560 --> 2:49:40.680]  tv so i don't see anybody really trying to do anything to fix anything i just see more continuation
[2:49:40.680 --> 2:49:44.680]  of what's been going on around the country and i don't see this ending anytime soon yeah you know
[2:49:44.680 --> 2:49:48.440]  breaking out a window and grabbing a television set and running that's not that's just that's not
[2:49:48.440 --> 2:49:53.960]  looting that's just a protest one of the things that we saw was a clean out the store that he did
[2:49:53.960 --> 2:50:01.160]  the new inventory he's doing them a favor store cleaners um we saw the video the guy uh the black
[2:50:01.160 --> 2:50:04.680]  guy who was going around and saying free hugs and hugging the police we saw the people who
[2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:09.560]  criticized for what you're describing there is that even sounds like even the uh most of the
[2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:16.280]  peaceful protesters other than some individuals like like that individual many of the so-called
[2:50:16.280 --> 2:50:22.200]  peaceful protesters are really kind of inciting this kind of racist hatred amongst the people
[2:50:22.200 --> 2:50:26.600]  even if they're not actually throwing stuff or doing violence himself would you characterize it
[2:50:26.600 --> 2:50:30.920]  that way or is that an unfair characterization there there was a i would say out of what i saw
[2:50:30.920 --> 2:50:37.000]  last night maybe up to five individuals uh protesters uh you know african-american females
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:41.880]  that were walking up to uh the police and especially the head of the police department
[2:50:41.880 --> 2:50:47.000]  that's here in downtown the uptown area of charlotte and he was walking around in the
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:51.160]  protest amongst the people and people would come up there was a a girl i have one of the

[2:54:24.360 --> 2:54:31.640]  what is some of the things that we've got here uh which is again this article uh that uh we were
[2:54:31.640 --> 2:54:36.600]  talking about with uh joel gilbert amerophobia you know when i look at that he talks about how
[2:54:37.160 --> 2:54:43.000]  the left hates america this interesting article on the hill by armstrong williams
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:48.520]  to himself is black and he says nationalism is the new n word and that really does describe
[2:54:48.520 --> 2:54:54.360]  it that is the hate that is being engendered as we see even as we see racial division being
[2:54:54.360 --> 2:54:59.960]  fermented by hillary clinton on our streets i want to get to uh the news and just a moment
[2:54:59.960 --> 2:55:05.240]  but before we do i want to remind you that we have a free app that launched this week and

[2:56:09.800 --> 2:56:16.600]  dot com that's not going to last much longer now when we're talking to uh Joel Gilbert
[2:56:16.600 --> 2:56:22.680]  i mentioned this article about obama in an awkward twist becomes saudi arabia's defender
[2:56:22.680 --> 2:56:27.800]  do you understand what he's defending saudi arabia from they expect that he's going to veto
[2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:34.440]  the ability of 9-11 families to sue the Saudis so even though they were telling us that the
[2:56:34.440 --> 2:56:39.160]  Saudis were behind it they put this whole narrative out there even had some documents
[2:56:39.160 --> 2:56:43.720]  that made its way into the official report telling us that there were officials within the Saudi
[2:56:43.720 --> 2:56:47.640]  government and the ambassadors that were helping to fund the people that they said brought down the
[2:56:47.640 --> 2:56:55.080]  towers even as they're doing that they're saying to americans for 15 years no you can't sue them
[2:56:55.080 --> 2:56:59.560]  that all blew up didn't it why did it blow up it blew up because donald trump said
[2:57:00.120 --> 2:57:05.960]  released the 28 pages it finally got traction even though you had the people who had the senators
[2:57:05.960 --> 2:57:10.840]  who had headed the 9-11 commission were saying we need to release these pages to the american
[2:57:10.840 --> 2:57:15.880]  public they remained hidden why because they didn't want this to blow up in the way that it's blown
[2:57:15.880 --> 2:57:22.920]  up so now you've got obama in an awkward position he has to choose sides the Saudis or the american
[2:57:22.920 --> 2:57:28.280]  people guess which side he went with the Saudis of course of course he went with the Saudis
[2:57:28.280 --> 2:57:31.960]  he's not he's going to tell them he doesn't want this to go any further you know if they start getting
[2:57:31.960 --> 2:57:38.600]  sued and a lot of money is involved the Saudis might give up some more information that they know
[2:57:38.600 --> 2:57:44.440]  about what happened on 9-11 you know if you're going to throw us under the bus they say for 9-11
[2:57:44.440 --> 2:57:50.920]  maybe we'll maybe we'll turn stool pigeon and get some immunity here by talking about the
[2:57:50.920 --> 2:57:55.320]  people who are higher up they were really involved in this can't have that can't have that so
[2:57:55.880 --> 2:58:00.360]  that'll be interesting to see how that develops and that's going to be coming up pretty soon he's
[2:58:00.360 --> 2:58:04.760]  going to have to just make a decision one way or the other now of course on money night we're going
[2:58:04.760 --> 2:58:09.560]  to have the debate first time that hillary clinton and donald trump have faced off against each other
[2:58:09.560 --> 2:58:15.800]  but really you know what this is going to be the first time that we've had an american facing the
[2:58:15.800 --> 2:58:20.200]  globalists and i think it's going to be huge as donald trump would say i think it's going to be
[2:58:20.200 --> 2:58:25.480]  like the very first super bowl we've never seen the two football leagues play each other we have
[2:58:25.480 --> 2:58:30.840]  never seen anybody defending the american position in our lifetime against the globalists with that
[2:58:30.840 --> 2:58:35.720]  on many nights for the first time stay with us to be right back 45 days left to the general election
[2:58:35.720 --> 2:58:40.520]  can the united states pull out of the new world order as russia and the uk have begun to do

[3:00:15.880 --> 3:00:18.920]  from the front lines of the information war
[3:00:18.920 --> 3:00:27.720]  for its alex jones
[3:00:28.600 --> 3:00:33.320]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night but already in the batting box we've got lienne
[3:00:33.320 --> 3:00:39.640]  macadoo ready to take over in the next segment you know on monday night we're going to really
[3:00:39.640 --> 3:00:45.240]  have a start to say at the end of that last segment something that we haven't seen our entire life
[3:00:45.240 --> 3:00:51.240]  and that is a match up between an american point of view and the globalist point of view
[3:00:52.120 --> 3:00:56.760]  it was last put out there by robert taft the last american who would actually
[3:00:56.760 --> 3:01:02.280]  say that uh we should not surrender to the globalist i think it's going to be very big i think it's
[3:01:02.280 --> 3:01:08.040]  going to be like i said the equivalent to the very first super bowl you know we have people who get
[3:01:08.040 --> 3:01:12.920]  very involved in fantasy football league and everything understand this and i felt is all
[3:01:12.920 --> 3:01:18.920]  fantasy football okay it's not the real world this is the real world series these debates this
[3:01:18.920 --> 3:01:25.800]  election it's real world okay it's the one that really matters you may not be interested in politics
[3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:29.240]  but you know the politicians are going to be interested in you no matter what you do you
[3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:34.920]  can't escape these people so start getting involved one way the other to get into this you know i
[3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:39.800]  we've had for the longest time we like i said we haven't had an american versus a globalist
[3:01:39.800 --> 3:01:48.440]  matchup we've had this republican conference we've had a democrat conference but they've
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:54.040]  all been playing for the globalist league really okay it's a very small distinction without any
[3:01:54.040 --> 3:01:58.600]  real difference so this is the first time in my lifetime we've ever really even fielded a team
[3:01:58.600 --> 3:02:04.600]  and now we see on the dredge report that there's not going to be a break for hillary clinton that's
[3:02:04.600 --> 3:02:09.880]  big news she also needs to have a podium there i guess she can't wear high heels that would be really
[3:02:09.880 --> 3:02:15.880]  dangerous as wobbly as clinton has been if she were to wear high heels and i guess there's nothing
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:21.800]  in there about her getting any pillows or handicap rails on the podium or the steps to get up on her
[3:02:22.520 --> 3:02:26.920]  stool that she's going to stand on to try to look like she's as tall as donald trump
[3:02:26.920 --> 3:02:30.760]  the question is is she going to be able to make it of course there's another couple of articles
[3:02:30.760 --> 3:02:35.880]  that are up on the dredge report uh this one from the hill clinton's eyes a window into her health
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:41.720]  issues i just start out by talking about the 2014 conan o brian spoof of hillary clinton
[3:02:41.720 --> 3:02:47.240]  with an interview and when i saw that real video of her with a lazy eye that that she couldn't get
[3:02:47.240 --> 3:02:54.680]  to focus uh my wife and i were laughing about it it's like that thing has that's real i mean as
[3:02:54.680 --> 3:02:58.440]  though was what did they know that that was really going to happen did they do that to kind of give
[3:02:58.440 --> 3:03:04.760]  her a uh kind of put that out as predictive programming so that when people saw what was
[3:03:04.760 --> 3:03:08.280]  really happening with her eyes they would say oh it's not real there there it is right there
[3:03:08.280 --> 3:03:12.200]  they're showing it if you're watching the video feed there it's a going in every direction but
[3:03:12.200 --> 3:03:17.080]  they really are going in different directions uh we've got doctors even like ram paul saying hey
[3:03:17.080 --> 3:03:21.880]  there's there's something going on here this is not pneumonia folks okay not pneumonia it's been
[3:03:21.880 --> 3:03:26.440]  going on for a long time that's why i wondered if conan o brian uh some of the people who had
[3:03:26.440 --> 3:03:30.600]  talked with her privately because she loves to meet privately with people in hollywood i wonder
[3:03:30.600 --> 3:03:35.880]  if they had noticed the eyes going in different directions and i did that to kind of help her
[3:03:35.880 --> 3:03:41.560]  a lot of people i'm sure that the democrats don't believe that that's real and she keeps insisting
[3:03:41.560 --> 3:03:46.280]  she doesn't need a brain test you know she is ain't no way tired is uh i guess what she's
[3:03:46.280 --> 3:03:51.160]  telling people who say uh maybe we need to uh to examine you pat bucanon had an interesting
[3:03:51.160 --> 3:03:57.000]  reading editorial that was up on the dredge report from w&d talking about when he was running for
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:04:02.040]  president and the advice that he got was uh you don't need to win this thing you just need to do
[3:04:02.040 --> 3:04:07.880]  better than people expect and when he talks about that this is uh the article how trump
[3:04:07.880 --> 3:04:14.440]  wins the debate and he points out that what has been sold to the public is a cartoon version of
[3:04:14.440 --> 3:04:20.360]  donald trump we've already seen donald trump a real donald trump as he met with the president
[3:04:20.360 --> 3:04:28.360]  of mexico as he went down to louisiana uh where hillary clinton was unable to or uh too sick to go
[3:04:28.360 --> 3:04:34.520]  or too disinterested to go uh to talk to people down there if we see a presidential donald trump
[3:04:34.520 --> 3:04:39.800]  then he wins he doesn't need to win all the little policy wonk issues he doesn't need to go real deep
[3:04:39.800 --> 3:04:45.400]  on the details get down in the weeds people don't want that what they want to see is is he real
[3:04:46.520 --> 3:04:49.640]  can he be presidential and i think that's what they're going to see on monday night
[3:04:49.640 --> 3:04:51.960]  stay with us we'll be right back with leon macadoo
[3:05:01.720 --> 3:05:06.440]  the white house confirmed this week that president obama will veto any legislation that
[3:05:06.440 --> 3:05:13.080]  allows the families of the victims of 9 11 to sue the government of saudi arabia as one texas
[3:05:13.080 --> 3:05:19.000]  representative points out lewis comart it shows where the president's loyalty truly lies he's
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:24.440]  standing with the kingdom and not with us citizens the veto announcement will arguably lay the
[3:05:24.440 --> 3:05:30.520]  groundwork for a showdown with obama and congress as this bill has bipartisan support on the hill
[3:05:30.520 --> 3:05:36.920]  and gained final approval today in the house the 28 pages of the heavily redacted 9 11 commission
[3:05:36.920 --> 3:05:43.240]  report implicate saudi arabia both clandestine and government complicity occurred in 2001
[3:05:43.240 --> 3:05:49.160]  in the attack that killed thousands of americans in york dc in pennsylvania the president's
[3:05:49.160 --> 3:05:54.040]  participation in blocking justice for these families reflects how he truly feels despite
[3:05:54.040 --> 3:05:59.320]  speeches and fancy toast honoring those that died that day i'm margaret hell reporting for

[3:08:46.680 --> 3:08:51.480]  some of the questions that we hope to hear at this debate as well as some possible solutions
[3:08:51.480 --> 3:08:56.280]  maybe we'll send a little tips out for for trump and hillary hopefully she got that
[3:08:56.280 --> 3:09:01.240]  package of lung cleanse that we sent her so she can actually make it through this debate you know
[3:09:01.240 --> 3:09:06.360]  they've already said they're not going to give her a stool to stand on so we'll see i i guarantee
[3:09:06.360 --> 3:09:12.680]  my my bet is that she is going to be pumped full of all of the life extension technology that the
[3:09:12.680 --> 3:09:18.440]  globalists have at their disposal but we will see so i want to go ahead and and throw to a video
[3:09:18.440 --> 3:09:25.000]  that alex shones put together talking about the big secret of this trump versus hillary debate
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:29.480]  kind of give you the lowdown on how you can watch the debate with info wars dot com so do
[3:09:29.480 --> 3:09:41.400]  you guys have that video ready to go all right it's almost here you can cut the tension with a knife
[3:09:41.400 --> 3:09:48.920]  the first real debate for 90 minutes head to head hosted a university in new york next monday
[3:09:48.920 --> 3:09:55.720]  at eight o'clock central until 9 30 central and info wars dot com will be covering it live on the
[3:09:55.720 --> 3:10:02.040]  scene and with our own feeds as well as live commentary and analysis at info wars dot com
[3:10:02.040 --> 3:10:07.240]  forward slash show a few weeks ago i made the point that this could be bigger than the super bowl
[3:10:07.240 --> 3:10:12.600]  because the american people are really starting to wake up and guess what top media analysts have
[3:10:12.600 --> 3:10:19.640]  now come out and looked at the early numbers coming in and it appears there could be as many as 100
[3:10:19.640 --> 3:10:25.400]  million viewers that has never happened in history and will be bigger than any tv show including
[3:10:25.400 --> 3:10:31.720]  the super bowl that the united states has ever broadcast but i wouldn't hold your breath something
[3:10:31.720 --> 3:10:38.200]  tells me there's less than a 50 50 chance hillary's gonna show up to this debate in fact she's only
[3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:44.600]  doing like one event a week and isn't doing any events now right through next monday that tells
[3:10:44.600 --> 3:10:50.440]  you how incredibly sick she is and as trump begins to surge in the polls you would expect her to be
[3:10:50.440 --> 3:10:56.520]  out on the street redoubling her efforts but she's not so even if she makes it to the debate next
[3:10:56.520 --> 3:11:03.320]  monday night how is she going to be able to stand up there for 90 minutes so i wonder what the numbers
[3:11:03.320 --> 3:11:11.240]  are if i was a betting man on her collapsing or having a cocking fit and having to cut the debate
[3:11:11.240 --> 3:11:16.280]  short and don't forget there's precedence for this during one of the democrat debates they had to
[3:11:16.280 --> 3:11:21.960]  pause for like 10 minutes because she wouldn't come out after the quote commercial break ladies
[3:11:21.960 --> 3:11:26.520]  and gentlemen you talk about edge of your seat i don't care about sports and stuff like that because
[3:11:26.520 --> 3:11:31.640]  it doesn't matter it doesn't affect my life or my children's future but this does i'm proud to see
[3:11:31.640 --> 3:11:36.040]  the american people so excited about this debate and it's because we're finally getting somebody
[3:11:36.040 --> 3:11:42.600]  real to go up against the establishment represented by hillary clinton this isn't sports this is
[3:11:42.600 --> 3:11:47.640]  reality we're not just spectators watching some basketball or football game we're actually in
[3:11:47.640 --> 3:11:53.560]  the arena this is our country this is our world and a sleeping giant is awakening and info wars

[3:13:12.520 --> 3:13:19.160]  pivotal moment in our country for our country so i i know all eyes are going to be on that debate
[3:13:19.160 --> 3:13:23.880]  and i'm super excited about our new app it's just in phase one right now we've got some really
[3:13:23.880 --> 3:13:28.120]  exciting things coming down the pipeline for that app so make sure you download it right now
[3:13:28.840 --> 3:13:34.680]  info wars dot com forward slash app now with the rest of the segment i wanted to talk to you
[3:13:34.680 --> 3:13:39.080]  a little bit about something kind of frightening that's going on we're seeing censorship
[3:13:39.080 --> 3:13:46.280]  hammering down in all directions at this point now you'll recall just the beginning of this month
[3:13:46.280 --> 3:13:51.400]  youtube started demonetizing people's videos anything really that has news content in it or
[3:13:51.400 --> 3:13:57.800]  something that someone deems offensive or if it has offensive language or content that makes people
[3:13:57.800 --> 3:14:03.240]  uncomfortable it could be demonetized it's just sort of an arbitrary thing well now this censorship
[3:14:03.240 --> 3:14:08.360]  is coming at all angles now first i kind of want to back it up a little bit because whistleblower
[3:14:08.360 --> 3:14:13.640]  william bitty was on the show the other day with alex jones and of course you know he worked with
[3:14:13.640 --> 3:14:20.200]  the nsa worked to help develop a lot of these programs that are helping control us keep track of us
[3:14:20.200 --> 3:14:26.200]  surveil us and of course he programmed them in a way that was in alignment with the constitution
[3:14:26.200 --> 3:14:30.840]  and then they sort of got altered a little bit to be more befitting of what the globalist
[3:14:30.840 --> 3:14:36.280]  design had in mind so let's go ahead and play this clip william bitty warning alex jones and all of
[3:14:36.280 --> 3:14:42.200]  us about the one world government that's being constructed right now what about a larger plan
[3:14:42.200 --> 3:14:46.120]  i mean i know it's about looting and making money hundreds of billions of dollars you know globally
[3:14:46.120 --> 3:14:52.840]  a year by these companies but what's the master's strategy on building this technocracy i mean do
[3:14:52.840 --> 3:15:02.760]  they have one i think it's a a well this is my impression okay certainly it is the population
[3:15:02.760 --> 3:15:09.480]  control it's not just at any given country but of the world and so what they're after and direct
[3:15:09.480 --> 3:15:15.960]  and i think the obama has stated this from various points that he wanted a world community
[3:15:17.640 --> 3:15:21.880]  so i think that's probably what they're after in order to do that they have to be able to control
[3:15:21.880 --> 3:15:26.600]  the people of the world so in order to do that you have to have knowledge of them to know who's
[3:15:26.600 --> 3:15:33.000]  doing what so you can stop it or manipulate it any way you want william bitty that is the most
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:37.320]  profound thing i think i've ever heard you say and you've said a lot of profound things this is the
[3:15:37.320 --> 3:15:43.960]  key for a technocracy world government program and davos admits that's their plan but uh here you
[3:15:43.960 --> 3:15:48.120]  are the former leader of the national security agency telling us that that's what they're building
[3:15:48.120 --> 3:15:52.760]  a beast system if you're not a christian it almost makes you one doesn't it
[3:15:53.880 --> 3:15:59.080]  so that was a nsa whistleblower william bitty obviously exposing the fact that the nsa is
[3:15:59.080 --> 3:16:04.440]  being set up for total population control of the entire globe of course he helped oliver
[3:16:04.440 --> 3:16:08.680]  stone with the latest movie snowden to make sure that it was super accurate that's a really great
[3:16:08.680 --> 3:16:14.280]  movie but we've we've learned through these snowden revelations how the giant tech companies
[3:16:14.280 --> 3:16:20.520]  were in collusion with the nsa helping to scoop up all of that metadata so let's talk about how
[3:16:20.520 --> 3:16:25.880]  these tech companies have become such a vital part of the control apparatus they're almost a public
[3:16:25.880 --> 3:16:33.080]  utility at this point and more powerful than a lot of countries in some cases so these tech
[3:16:33.080 --> 3:16:39.320]  companies are now consolidating at a record pace google is actually now looking to scoop up twitter
[3:16:39.320 --> 3:16:45.000]  as we speak facebook buys up just about anyone that pops up to be their potential competition
[3:16:45.000 --> 3:16:51.400]  on consolidation equals monopoly and why we need to be concerned about that is because if the
[3:16:51.400 --> 3:16:58.680]  trans-pacific partnership passes this is going to give those consolidated tech giants so much power
[3:16:58.680 --> 3:17:03.480]  if we're talking about these corporate tribunals these corporate tribunals are going to take over
[3:17:03.480 --> 3:17:09.960]  the adjudication of disputes so if a country decides that it doesn't want to import gmos for
[3:17:09.960 --> 3:17:15.960]  instance or toxic pesticides these corporate tribunals can decide whether or not to allow
[3:17:15.960 --> 3:17:21.480]  that country to have its own sovereign laws or whether it's going to you know have to import
[3:17:21.480 --> 3:17:25.480]  these corporate products who do you think they're going to decide the sovereignty of the nation or
[3:17:25.480 --> 3:17:30.360]  in favor of the mega corporate interests so that's why these monopolies are very concerning
[3:17:30.360 --> 3:17:35.720]  especially when you consider how these tech giants are really backing this move to
[3:17:37.240 --> 3:17:44.360]  have the us turn over control of the internet and this is obama's one last push his one last thing
[3:17:44.360 --> 3:17:50.680]  that he wants to do before he gets out of office to help the globalist agenda and now youtube in
[3:17:50.680 --> 3:17:55.640]  addition to their little move they just recently made to demonetize any videos they don't like
[3:17:55.640 --> 3:18:01.640]  like now they've unveiled a new program it's called the heroes program and they're basically
[3:18:01.640 --> 3:18:08.520]  going to be fighting trolls by hiring an army of volunteer trolls to take down videos that they
[3:18:08.520 --> 3:18:15.800]  disagree with it's so ridiculous it's it's like the brown shirts all over again and so
[3:18:15.800 --> 3:18:20.360]  they only allow people in who are accepted into the program and you have to go through all sorts
[3:18:20.360 --> 3:18:27.960]  of training but each level that you kind of level up in this program you get to mass flag
[3:18:27.960 --> 3:18:33.880]  videos that you do not like so you can take videos down they can moderate the site they can make
[3:18:33.880 --> 3:18:40.600]  comments on other people's videos and do you see this getting out of hand at any at any moment
[3:18:40.600 --> 3:18:45.960]  i certainly do because you know the demographics on youtube it was most like 15 year old kids
[3:18:45.960 --> 3:18:51.960]  but these are people who can flag any video that they don't like and this is how youtube is going
[3:18:51.960 --> 3:18:59.080]  to be um leveling the playing field this is what the founder of jigsaw which is a subsidiary company
[3:18:59.080 --> 3:19:04.840]  of google and youtube he said that they're setting this up on all of their platforms all of google
[3:19:04.840 --> 3:19:11.160]  and jigsaw's new platforms to be able to quote level the playing field because these voices these
[3:19:11.160 --> 3:19:16.760]  dissident voices have gotten so powerful like paul joseph watson's channel for instance has gotten
[3:19:16.760 --> 3:19:21.880]  so much power that they say they want to level the playing field but of course what is he talking
[3:19:21.880 --> 3:19:28.440]  about that's code for leveling the playing field and giving that power restoring it back to the
[3:19:28.440 --> 3:19:34.920]  dinosaur media who has become wholly ineffective and that's what they mean they don't want these
[3:19:34.920 --> 3:19:41.320]  um dissenting voices to have so much power so much sway over the population because we can see how
[3:19:41.320 --> 3:19:47.800]  we've even um been able to really knock the pegs down off hillary clinton she was inevitable to
[3:19:47.800 --> 3:19:51.640]  win at this point and now people are thinking she's not even gonna make it through the next debate
[3:19:52.200 --> 3:19:56.680]  well stick around because we're gonna be talking about some more things going on in the country
[3:19:56.680 --> 3:19:59.240]  and then owens shroyer will be joining me right after this

[3:24:39.400 --> 3:24:46.520]  students name is now considered a microaggression what isn't considered a microaggression at this
[3:24:46.520 --> 3:24:51.320]  point in this day and age i mean i am just so thankful that i'm not in school right now i
[3:24:51.320 --> 3:24:56.120]  feel for all of you out there that are still in school and for all of you who have children
[3:24:56.120 --> 3:25:01.960]  growing up in school you're a really uh really being tried right now but this is a campaign
[3:25:01.960 --> 3:25:07.560]  initiated by the national association for bilingual education and the santa clara county
[3:25:07.560 --> 3:25:13.000]  office of education they say a teacher who mispronounces a student's name is causing a
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:19.880]  negative emotional state that can lead to poor academic success now i do not even have that
[3:25:19.880 --> 3:25:26.280]  difficulty of a name and my name was beat up all the time in school and yeah you know i can
[3:25:26.280 --> 3:25:31.720]  i remember growing up kids told me i had a boy's name because my first name is lee le and they
[3:25:31.720 --> 3:25:35.640]  would tease me that i was oh that's a boy's name and yeah you know might hurt my feelings a little
[3:25:35.640 --> 3:25:41.160]  bit but my goodness i was like a freaking genius student that they wanted to move to the smarter
[3:25:41.160 --> 3:25:45.960]  classes and stuff if anything it just turned me into a reader because i didn't want to go hang out
[3:25:45.960 --> 3:25:51.240]  with all the mean kids that told me i was supposed to be a boy like what is going to happen in this
[3:25:51.240 --> 3:25:56.680]  country when these people graduate and they have been cushioned and padded and pillowed at every
[3:25:56.680 --> 3:26:02.200]  single turn there aren't coloring books on every single corner there aren't little squishy squeezy
[3:26:02.200 --> 3:26:07.880]  toys when you go to work and you have a tough day i mean it's just it we've got a tough and up here
[3:26:07.880 --> 3:26:13.000]  people anything that's just going to help them build some character now i know david night is
[3:26:13.000 --> 3:26:19.560]  always railing about the demise of the driver and how it's going to be taking away our freedoms
[3:26:19.560 --> 3:26:26.520]  when they want to do away with a personal vehicle ownership well i would like to do away with the
[3:26:26.520 --> 3:26:33.400]  people who are the troublemakers who are driving these globalists to take away all of our freedoms
[3:26:33.400 --> 3:26:39.480]  because they think we can't handle it here's another headline uber drivers are using zombie
[3:26:39.480 --> 3:26:46.520]  profile pictures to rack up cancellation fees so these are uber drivers in china and so the way
[3:26:46.520 --> 3:26:51.160]  that they're scamming riders into paying a cancellation fee is that they're they're changing
[3:26:51.160 --> 3:26:56.520]  their profile photo to these terrifying zombie pictures so that when the people are trying
[3:26:56.520 --> 3:27:01.400]  to catch the ride they're like whoa no i don't i don't want to get a ride with that guy and so
[3:27:01.400 --> 3:27:07.400]  then they cancel the the fare and so that will automatically give a few dollars to the driver
[3:27:07.400 --> 3:27:13.560]  since they got canceled on i mean my goodness if this is not going to be just one more reason for
[3:27:13.560 --> 3:27:20.680]  uber to do away with real actual human drivers it's that at every turn people figure out how
[3:27:20.680 --> 3:27:27.640]  to scam the system there were even stories out recently about some uber drivers faking faking
[3:27:27.640 --> 3:27:31.960]  that people threw up in their car and saying that they had some drunk person they picked up a drunk
[3:27:31.960 --> 3:27:38.360]  person and they vomited in their vehicle and they go so far as to take a picture of fake whatever
[3:27:38.360 --> 3:27:44.040]  you know pea soup or who knows and then uber pays them like a couple hundred dollars to go get their
[3:27:44.040 --> 3:27:49.480]  car cleaned and so they figure out how to totally scam the system and this is why uber wants to do
[3:27:49.480 --> 3:27:55.400]  away with humans and it's also why you see the the globalist elite want to do away with humans as
[3:27:55.400 --> 3:28:00.040]  well because why are there people on this earth who just they cannot help themselves they've
[3:28:00.040 --> 3:28:04.680]  got to figure out how to scam the system how to ruin it for the rest of us how to make it so that
[3:28:04.680 --> 3:28:09.720]  the surveillance state has to be so overreaching because none of us can be trusted with these
[3:28:09.720 --> 3:28:17.720]  freedoms my goodness and here's another one that i i really was proud of there's a video it's on the
[3:28:17.720 --> 3:28:24.200]  daily mail moment a woman rushes out of bed and opens fire on three armed burglars who broke into
[3:28:24.200 --> 3:28:32.040]  her home she shoots one dead the other two i guess they might have escaped but this is the cops release

[3:30:06.360 --> 3:30:13.000]  allows the families of the victims of 9 11 to sue the government of saudi arabia as one texas
[3:30:13.000 --> 3:30:19.000]  representative points out lewis gohmart it shows where the president's loyalty truly lies he's
[3:30:19.000 --> 3:30:24.440]  standing with the kingdom and not with us citizens the veto announcement will arguably lay the
[3:30:24.440 --> 3:30:30.440]  groundwork for a showdown with obama and congress as this bill has bipartisan support on the hill
[3:30:30.440 --> 3:30:36.840]  and gained final approval today in the house the 28 pages of the heavily redacted 9 11 commission

[3:30:49.160 --> 3:30:54.120]  participation in blocking justice for these families reflects how he truly feels despite

[3:33:19.640 --> 3:33:30.920]  welcome back to the alex jones show this is overdrive and i am leon macadoo joining me
[3:33:30.920 --> 3:33:39.000]  now is oh and shroyer and we are going to break down the debate what do we predict what are some
[3:33:39.000 --> 3:33:43.320]  rumors we've been hearing about as well as you know what would we like to hear about this is our
[3:33:43.320 --> 3:33:50.680]  big shot to see hillary versus trump right there on the stage um hopefully this time around they
[3:33:50.680 --> 3:33:56.520]  won't let hillary clinton say things like i never sent any classified information and just case
[3:33:56.520 --> 3:34:01.240]  closed they'll leave it there hopefully they'll actually challenge her on something like that
[3:34:01.240 --> 3:34:09.160]  because as we know uh based on the fbi inter investigation that was released indeed she did
[3:34:09.160 --> 3:34:17.320]  send classified information at least a hundred times and she also blamed her 2012 head injury her
[3:34:17.320 --> 3:34:22.360]  concussion on why she didn't know what that c marking meant because she couldn't remember getting
[3:34:22.360 --> 3:34:29.560]  her training to help her understand what classified information was but even in lieu of that she's
[3:34:29.560 --> 3:34:36.520]  still to the face of that veteran said i never sent classified information and i always did my best
[3:34:36.520 --> 3:34:41.960]  it reminds me of the time when she said i try not to lie yeah i try to tell the truth i will lie
[3:34:42.840 --> 3:34:48.520]  yeah well she tries apparently not hard enough right because she continues to be caught lying
[3:34:49.080 --> 3:34:52.680]  and actually donald trump is doing internal polling i don't know if you've seen any of this but
[3:34:53.240 --> 3:35:00.360]  he's asking his voters what issues they want to see him bring up do they want him to stay on
[3:35:00.360 --> 3:35:06.120]  political policy do they want him to attack hillary do they want him to go after the emails the
[3:35:06.120 --> 3:35:12.520]  lies and when i took the vote i said you know what let's let's stick to policy i think that for you
[3:35:12.520 --> 3:35:17.000]  in these debates the best thing would be to stick to policy but then inevitably
[3:35:17.000 --> 3:35:21.480]  hillary clinton's going to tell a lie and you can just go ahead and tackle on the lie right there
[3:35:21.480 --> 3:35:26.040]  so is this a poll that he is conducting via his twitter page or where is it at these are polls
[3:35:26.040 --> 3:35:31.160]  that i've been getting in emails i'm uh i i'm imagining i'm on the official donald trump email
[3:35:31.160 --> 3:35:36.280]  page or whatever it is and i get these polls i've seen like three or four of them um they don't show
[3:35:36.280 --> 3:35:43.960]  the results but they do ask you uh what you want and my guess is he's using this to kind of steer
[3:35:43.960 --> 3:35:49.400]  his debate rhetoric steer the debate uh topics and issues where he wants them to go i think
[3:35:49.400 --> 3:35:54.280]  he's very smart i haven't heard um i haven't heard hillary doing anything like this because she's
[3:35:54.280 --> 3:35:59.000]  sleeping well right where is he and you know i'm sorry not to get off track but you know you said
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:05.480]  that where is barack obama what where is barack obama we have riots going on in charlie i'm sorry
[3:36:05.480 --> 3:36:10.760]  lian i know i'm getting off base here but barack obama has been silent he hasn't been in the streets
[3:36:10.760 --> 3:36:15.560]  of charlie has been doing nothing you know what he did he licked his finger he tried to figure out
[3:36:15.560 --> 3:36:19.160]  which way the wind is blowing and then as soon as he knows what he can say that's going to appease
[3:36:19.160 --> 3:36:23.800]  everyone he's going to speak but i'm sorry to get off track he's only just got a few 45 more days
[3:36:23.800 --> 3:36:28.440]  really to push through his globalist agenda so he's there hobnobbing with all of his buddies at the
[3:36:28.440 --> 3:36:33.000]  un that's where he is he doesn't care about this country and black people he does not care about
[3:36:33.000 --> 3:36:38.200]  you i think he's made that evident over and over and over again look at the dire conditions you are in
[3:36:38.200 --> 3:36:44.600]  versus before that man got elected to office which leads us to one of the rumors that we're hearing
[3:36:44.600 --> 3:36:49.560]  if if hillary does actually collapse or can't make it to the debate or if something happens
[3:36:49.560 --> 3:36:54.760]  people are actually saying that they will replace her with michelle obama yeah what do you think about
[3:36:54.760 --> 3:36:59.320]  that well actually i have to give credit to one of our reporters here margaret howell who predicted
[3:36:59.320 --> 3:37:05.720]  this weeks ago i scoffed at her i thought that was completely uh unreal no way but now the rumors
[3:37:05.720 --> 3:37:10.440]  are starting to surface you know i'm not sure if this is something that's going to manifest or not
[3:37:10.440 --> 3:37:17.160]  but if it does doesn't that just show you how the whole thing is controlled well think about this
[3:37:17.160 --> 3:37:21.880]  if you're a democratic voter and you voted for hillary or you voted for bernie okay either one
[3:37:21.880 --> 3:37:28.040]  you're vote didn't count not at all never counted they're just going to insert michelle obama in there
[3:37:28.040 --> 3:37:33.240]  and of course why i think it's because they see that the black vote you know we have to talk about
[3:37:33.240 --> 3:37:38.120]  this vote that trump has started to take over i was on twitter all day today looking um and i
[3:37:38.120 --> 3:37:44.360]  retweeted a couple things of this black people are becoming more outspoken for trump than even
[3:37:44.360 --> 3:37:51.080]  white people to an extent where i've never set up a pose or set up a stage where i've got a sign
[3:37:51.080 --> 3:37:57.240]  a hat a shirt signs behind me just everything that's trump trump republicans done with the
[3:37:57.240 --> 3:38:01.880]  democrats and we're seeing this happen all over social media um from from black people who are
[3:38:01.880 --> 3:38:07.480]  either leaving the democratic voting plantation or they've just seen what trump is doing heard what
[3:38:07.480 --> 3:38:11.240]  he said and they really believe in him i've never seen this phenomenon before so yeah it's pretty
[3:38:11.240 --> 3:38:15.960]  powerful so that would be why i think they want to bring in a michelle obama right well and you
[3:38:15.960 --> 3:38:21.160]  know a lot of people like michelle obama i i like her she seems like she's a good mom a good wife
[3:38:21.160 --> 3:38:25.960]  or whatever and as she famously pointed out in 2008 she knows how to run her household
[3:38:29.000 --> 3:38:33.800]  run the white house we have we have we can't get past that you like michelle obama i don't
[3:38:33.800 --> 3:38:38.840]  dislike the woman it may it hurts my heart when and when alex says she's an attractive man
[3:38:38.840 --> 3:38:45.960]  well look i don't think i i can't stand michelle obama she comes off like a pompous arrogant
[3:38:45.960 --> 3:38:52.600]  person to me telling me what my kids need to be eating well then again you know with that whole
[3:38:52.600 --> 3:38:56.840]  school program it's not like she was going to get in here and go against all of those huge
[3:38:56.840 --> 3:39:01.000]  food corporations that have got their tentacles in our school system so you don't think michelle
[3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:08.280]  obama has a codpiece i have never been inside of her pants i don't know what sort of fish
[3:39:08.280 --> 3:39:13.960]  filet he's working it but beyond that though i mean i think that you know what i don't know if
[3:39:13.960 --> 3:39:18.760]  they're gonna i think hillary's gonna she'll she'll she'll go on and she could be five minutes from
[3:39:18.760 --> 3:39:24.040]  death and the doctor could say hillary you're gonna die if you go on that stage and try to debate
[3:39:24.040 --> 3:39:29.320]  and she's gonna you know give him the finger and go out on that stage listen matt rudge was here in
[3:39:29.320 --> 3:39:35.160]  this studio and he predicted it he said the american voters they don't even care and they the they the
[3:39:35.160 --> 3:39:40.600]  rulers or whatever think we're so stupid that we don't even need a real body we could have hillary
[3:39:40.600 --> 3:39:45.160]  clinton's brain in a jar that's what he said yeah head on the stick was that what he said her brain
[3:39:45.160 --> 3:39:49.800]  in a jar in a jar on the desk there in the oval office so they could just roll someone out at the
[3:39:49.800 --> 3:39:53.960]  last minute who hasn't been vetted who has no plan who hasn't gone to the debates who hasn't
[3:39:53.960 --> 3:39:59.880]  done anything to state their case to the american people to decide if or the american people to
[3:39:59.880 --> 3:40:03.960]  decide if they want this person representing them or not and that just goes to show you yes how
[3:40:03.960 --> 3:40:09.560]  controlled it is and also how much of a puppet the president usually is which is why they're so
[3:40:09.560 --> 3:40:15.080]  afraid of trump because he's not bought out by anyone yet and we are gonna hold your feet to
[3:40:15.080 --> 3:40:20.440]  the fire and now his latest campaign strategy is he's gonna donate two dollars to every dollar
[3:40:20.440 --> 3:40:25.320]  donated to his campaign in one final push but you know you talk about the controlled race
[3:40:25.320 --> 3:40:29.800]  what would the outrage be i mean that's what i that's what i would be curious to me if they
[3:40:29.800 --> 3:40:34.760]  just bring in a michelle obama okay with no vote with nothing they just decide they're
[3:40:34.760 --> 3:40:38.440]  going to go with the michelle obama will they'll where there'll be any outrage from the bernie
[3:40:38.440 --> 3:40:43.640]  supporters from the hillary supporters or will they just oh yeah we like her yeah and lemma
[3:40:43.640 --> 3:40:48.280]  what do you think about this leon because um drudge report matt drudge actually in a rare
[3:40:48.280 --> 3:40:54.600]  exclusive talked about the rules that we're going to be enforced or not enforced coming up
[3:40:54.600 --> 3:40:59.800]  in this first presidential debate and it doesn't seem like hillary's going to have any advantages
[3:40:59.800 --> 3:41:04.760]  that she might have thought that she was going to have i was kind of shocked i know she i mean
[3:41:04.760 --> 3:41:09.480]  do you think that she at all is beginning to feel the heat like wow i thought i had everything in
[3:41:09.480 --> 3:41:17.080]  my pocket they told me this was my time and now even they can't even wheel uh weekend at bernie's
[3:41:17.080 --> 3:41:22.520]  clinton around anymore even they're saying wow i'm sorry you know you've collapsed on video it was
[3:41:22.520 --> 3:41:27.080]  no quote unquote pneumonia well and we're in disregard even some of these debate rules well
[3:41:27.080 --> 3:41:31.800]  disregard even the videos we've seen where she clearly has health issues whether it be her eyes
[3:41:32.360 --> 3:41:39.640]  staggering or seizing up or falling over coughing the list goes on and on this is such a joke
[3:41:40.360 --> 3:41:46.760]  the glasses i mean it's on and on the fbi investigation admitted uh concussion trauma
[3:41:46.760 --> 3:41:54.440]  but you know you said this is what's amazing to me okay they're they've said they're going to go
[3:41:54.440 --> 3:41:58.280]  90 minutes they said they're not going to give her the stool they're not going to do any coughing
[3:41:58.280 --> 3:42:05.160]  breaks so and the mics are going to be hot the mic will be hot the whole time so if anything happens
[3:42:05.160 --> 3:42:09.880]  if anything happens what what is she going to do is she going to walk off the stage is she going
[3:42:09.880 --> 3:42:15.320]  to try to save face you know i mean it's it's it's going to be a very interesting situation
[3:42:15.320 --> 3:42:20.840]  and i think that you asked me do i think she's panicking do i think she's feeling the heat
[3:42:21.400 --> 3:42:26.680]  i think that the video that she did where she's like why aren't i winning by 50 points
[3:42:26.680 --> 3:42:32.440]  i can't believe i'm not up 50 points if you look at her in that video she looks like a criminally
[3:42:32.440 --> 3:42:37.400]  insane human being so insane can you imagine her being our dictator oh my god she would be the
[3:42:37.400 --> 3:42:42.440]  leader that is what we're gonna have to listen to and every single weekly address why are you doing
[3:42:42.440 --> 3:42:47.480]  this like oh i'm i'm leaving that's my prediction leah macadoo is moving out of this country if that
[3:42:47.480 --> 3:42:52.200]  woman wins and there's a video right there just look at that that is the face of a criminally
[3:42:52.200 --> 3:42:58.600]  insane person right there and she's angry you know why she's angry folks because her little slaves
[3:42:58.600 --> 3:43:04.360]  her little constituents aren't doing what she wants them to do hillary's slaves the voters
[3:43:04.360 --> 3:43:09.080]  she thinks should be rushing to the polls and voting for her en masse and they're not she's
[3:43:09.080 --> 3:43:13.800]  getting her tail whipped so there she is going criminally insane why aren't the slaves voting
[3:43:13.800 --> 3:43:22.680]  for me they were supposed to vote for me vote for me slave that's why the video is only about a
[3:43:22.680 --> 3:43:26.600]  minute long because you know that's about all the energy she could muster up for that minute but
[3:43:26.600 --> 3:43:31.640]  that was a bad day for her you know i talked to a lady i talked to a lady who is at that rally okay
[3:43:32.520 --> 3:43:36.200]  this is the weirdest thing i've never heard of this is presidential campaign folks okay you're
[3:43:36.200 --> 3:43:40.840]  trying to be the president of the united states hillary clinton goes to a small venue okay there's
[3:43:40.840 --> 3:43:46.040]  two rooms in this venue one that could hold 600 people one that could hold about a hundred people
[3:43:46.040 --> 3:43:51.320]  she goes to the room that could hold a hundred people she locks it down for media and vip people
[3:43:51.320 --> 3:43:55.640]  only there were some disabled people she had in there and then everybody else the people who
[3:43:55.640 --> 3:44:01.800]  actually went to see her the actual voters were put in the overrun or the overflow room and they
[3:44:01.800 --> 3:44:08.040]  watched hillary speak on a television screen okay plenty of room in the room to have everybody in
[3:44:08.040 --> 3:44:13.240]  there and have her on the stage and she doesn't do it and then after that rally she goes and does
[3:44:13.240 --> 3:44:17.960]  the video that we just played going criminally insane why aren't the slaves voting for me i think
[3:44:17.960 --> 3:44:22.760]  i think she is feeling the heat lian yeah because she can't control the fact that other people are
[3:44:22.760 --> 3:44:27.240]  able to get footage that they're uploading to twitter right away showing the actual size of her
[3:44:27.240 --> 3:44:33.560]  campaign rallies where she has her operatives going in and photoshopping in a bigger crowd to make it
[3:44:33.560 --> 3:44:36.840]  appear as though she has a bigger crowd and then people are like well wait a minute that's not what
[3:44:36.840 --> 3:44:42.120]  i have on my picture right here which is i was there in person and then let's let's look at these
[3:44:42.120 --> 3:44:47.320]  other dirty tricks that they're up to um so this is up at info wars dot com cliford cunningham has a
[3:44:47.320 --> 3:44:54.920]  story dhs rubber stamping citizenships prior to the election so the dhs is approving as many
[3:44:54.920 --> 3:45:01.160]  citizenship applications as possible in an effort to directly influence the presidential election
[3:45:01.160 --> 3:45:07.160]  so in every single way we got facebook google with all their algorithms and and twitter recommending
[3:45:07.160 --> 3:45:12.120]  who you should follow on twitter even if you're a trump follower it says you should follow hillary
[3:45:12.120 --> 3:45:17.320]  or obama or ted cruise and if you go to obama's page or hillary's it doesn't say follow trump i
[3:45:17.320 --> 3:45:23.640]  mean it's all totally biased and here now they're even really working overtime to get people um
[3:45:23.640 --> 3:45:28.520]  to become citizens of this country before they even know what's up before they even have any idea of
[3:45:28.520 --> 3:45:34.040]  of how this country works or if they're proud of the way you know being here no assimilation
[3:45:34.040 --> 3:45:38.680]  given the right to vote right away and we need you to vote democrat by the way well and let's be
[3:45:38.680 --> 3:45:44.200]  perfectly clear this is not because the democrats care about these people this is not because the
[3:45:44.200 --> 3:45:50.920]  democrats have a big heart uh you know this is because the democrats want a voter block okay in
[3:45:50.920 --> 3:45:56.040]  fact i i've done a report on this before the way the democrats have been rigging elections in recent
[3:45:56.040 --> 3:46:01.560]  years is they have voter blocks in the inner cities if you actually go out and you look at how the
[3:46:01.560 --> 3:46:05.720]  counties and the districts break down and then the electoral college you're going to find something
[3:46:05.720 --> 3:46:12.040]  astounding folks the only blue areas on the map are in the inner cities that's it if you had a
[3:46:12.040 --> 3:46:18.280]  county by county breakdown of the entire united states it would almost be entirely red except in
[3:46:18.280 --> 3:46:22.120]  the inner city so this is where they established their voter block and now as you're talking about
[3:46:22.120 --> 3:46:26.120]  lienne they're trying to establish a new voter block because i think they're starting to lose
[3:46:26.120 --> 3:46:30.680]  some of those votes i think they're realizing that the heat is on they need to bring in these
[3:46:30.680 --> 3:46:35.240]  immigrants they need to bring in these refugees they need to rubber stamp them the right to vote
[3:46:35.240 --> 3:46:38.760]  and then of course what are they gonna say well we're gonna give you a handout we're gonna give
[3:46:38.760 --> 3:46:41.800]  you a place to stay we're gonna give you a bus pass we're gonna give you a meal and this is the
[3:46:41.800 --> 3:46:45.960]  democrats if you want this to continue make sure you vote hillary if you want to be shipped out
[3:46:45.960 --> 3:46:51.960]  you better not vote trump so this is clearly an effort to create a voter block and rig this upcoming
[3:46:51.960 --> 3:46:59.560]  election right well it's just like in a lot of minority communities you they'll have the christmas
[3:46:59.560 --> 3:47:04.840]  ham or the thanksgiving turkey come out you know oh you got a vote here's your big turkey dinner
[3:47:04.840 --> 3:47:09.560]  you know we're going to give you this big giant turkey to feed your whole family just sign your
[3:47:09.560 --> 3:47:15.240]  name right here vote for this guy keep your local mayor in office or someone who hasn't been doing
[3:47:15.240 --> 3:47:20.200]  anything for you at all for a hundred years in these democrat run cities we're gonna go ahead
[3:47:20.200 --> 3:47:25.400]  and just throw you literally throw you a bone chicken bone or turkey bone or whatever it happens to
[3:47:25.400 --> 3:47:29.240]  be so you can feed your family and this is this is kind of the carrot that they're dangling in
[3:47:29.240 --> 3:47:35.000]  front of these people keeping them year after year locked in these dire situations that they're in
[3:47:35.000 --> 3:47:39.960]  not educating them on how they should really be voting or how they're really being held back and
[3:47:39.960 --> 3:47:44.760]  how voting for this constant welfare state isn't actually helping them get ahead it just maybe
[3:47:44.760 --> 3:47:50.280]  helping them barely scrape by in the present moment it's really sad to see and it's going to be kind
[3:47:50.280 --> 3:47:54.440]  of the same in the future because with this redistrict redistricting redistricting and new
[3:47:54.440 --> 3:47:58.360]  voting blocks with the gerrymandering that's something else that's really going on in the
[3:47:58.360 --> 3:48:05.960]  future i mean they're playing the long game here so someone gets in that can shake shake the etch
[3:48:05.960 --> 3:48:11.560]  a sketch i think and these are the political games that get played throughout these election cycles
[3:48:11.560 --> 3:48:16.200]  that i think people are finally starting to understand other than info wars people are
[3:48:16.200 --> 3:48:20.600]  starting to shed light on these things and i think that's a great analogy with the carrot on the stick
[3:48:21.480 --> 3:48:26.440]  it's like they put the carrot on the stick and you know you keep moving to the carrot and they
[3:48:26.440 --> 3:48:31.720]  say oh well there'll be more carrots it'll be more carrots and what have we seen and
[3:48:31.720 --> 3:48:36.040]  donald trump talks about this what the inner cities haven't gotten any better i'm from the
[3:48:36.040 --> 3:48:41.960]  city of st lewis okay uh inner cities run by democrats and this has been a declining city
[3:48:41.960 --> 3:48:47.160]  they've had the i mean they've had some things come along and come and go but the city itself
[3:48:47.160 --> 3:48:54.200]  never seems to grow it never seems to really i don't know experience any sort of a positive
[3:48:54.760 --> 3:48:58.760]  reaction from the new projects they bring in they bring in the new projects they promise you
[3:48:58.760 --> 3:49:01.800]  that it's going to be different and then it's not different it's still the same they end up
[3:49:01.800 --> 3:49:06.520]  getting run down it still say it still says the same city so but these are democrat run cities and
[3:49:06.520 --> 3:49:11.480]  this is again i think that the reason they're freaking out is because they're losing the faith
[3:49:11.480 --> 3:49:15.080]  in the people they've been relying on yeah because people are finally getting their information
[3:49:15.080 --> 3:49:19.320]  from these alternative means which is why they really want to crack down on the internet and
[3:49:19.320 --> 3:49:23.480]  quote-unquote level the playing field for these strong voices that are out there but look at what
[3:49:23.480 --> 3:49:29.800]  a slap in the face it is to say the people of detroit for instance where they have been crying
[3:49:29.800 --> 3:49:36.840]  begging for help for all these years living below poverty level their their city is in ruins
[3:49:37.560 --> 3:49:44.760]  no jobs and what do they say literally come out and say we are going to give the homes the jobs to
[3:49:44.760 --> 3:49:50.440]  the searing in refugees we're going to bring in refugees and allow them to take over this city
[3:49:50.440 --> 3:49:54.840]  and let them flourish let them do this no we're not going to help the people that were there that
[3:49:54.840 --> 3:49:59.080]  have been begging us for assistance all this time and have been paying whatever little they could
[3:49:59.080 --> 3:50:04.360]  in taxes to try to get their streets fixed or their homes or whatever what have you i mean
[3:50:04.360 --> 3:50:08.600]  what a slap that's how they really feel about you that's what they really think about you so
[3:50:08.600 --> 3:50:12.920]  when they make all these political promises you have to look at the track record what have they
[3:50:12.920 --> 3:50:18.280]  actually done for you and don't just fall into the identity politics of always the first black
[3:50:18.280 --> 3:50:22.680]  president or always the first female president they're globalists at the end of the day that's
[3:50:22.680 --> 3:50:28.280]  what they are they have an agenda and just like the the members of their party look at the track
[3:50:28.280 --> 3:50:33.480]  record of how they have taken care of your cities and your states and how they've destroyed them
[3:50:33.480 --> 3:50:37.800]  and how you're paying astronomical tax rates and that's right out of the clinton camp too that's
[3:50:37.800 --> 3:50:42.760]  syrian comment rebuilding detroit with syrians that's right out of the clinton camp i mean
[3:50:42.760 --> 3:50:47.880]  let's put americans first is that so outrageous i mean and that's exactly what trump said like
[3:50:47.880 --> 3:50:54.920]  let our children be dreamers too give them the opportunities so we are going to be right back

[3:54:52.760 --> 3:54:58.760]  wars dot com as well as our youtube channel and the brand new app if you want to watch it on your
[3:54:58.760 --> 3:55:04.360]  phone so now let's talk a little bit about what's going on in charlotte i know we've got our reporter
[3:55:04.360 --> 3:55:10.600]  joe bigs on the ground there but we've seen all sorts of things it was much worse than what happened
[3:55:10.600 --> 3:55:15.640]  in ferguson we were seeing reporters getting attacked and tackled just like our guys were
[3:55:15.640 --> 3:55:23.720]  where cnn msnbc when when jacari or joe bigs was actually getting sprayed with pepper spray or hit
[3:55:23.720 --> 3:55:29.080]  with rubber bullets they came out immediately saying oh no they didn't and we're like uh yes
[3:55:29.080 --> 3:55:33.720]  we did we have the evidence right here well now their reporters are getting tackled getting tear
[3:55:33.720 --> 3:55:41.640]  gassed but there's also a video which i don't think we have time to play it but msnbc was actually
[3:55:41.640 --> 3:55:47.560]  as we're watching everything roll out on the video they're saying that these rioters are peaceful
[3:55:47.560 --> 3:55:52.760]  and they're just hugging each other cleaning up the streets they're just cleaning up trash and and
[3:55:52.760 --> 3:55:58.200]  i saw another frame where it was saying neighbors visit their local police department
[3:55:59.560 --> 3:56:03.880]  just a friendly little they thought the friendly gathering needed a little upgrade of their police
[3:56:03.880 --> 3:56:09.560]  vehicles and that's why they were smashing them to bits it was a uh it was a it was a makeover
[3:56:09.560 --> 3:56:14.040]  they were just giving the city a makeover upgrade but i remember you know i was in ferguson um
[3:56:14.040 --> 3:56:19.640]  with with those guys and i we always talked about how that was the craziest thing we'd ever seen
[3:56:19.640 --> 3:56:24.520]  that was the most tense atmosphere we'd ever been in and i wasn't in charlotte but just watching it i
[3:56:24.520 --> 3:56:30.120]  could tell that it was much worse uh much more violent uh it's very sad but you know there were
[3:56:30.120 --> 3:56:34.440]  some things in common a lot of the people that were caught were not from the charlotte area
[3:56:34.440 --> 3:56:40.120]  that was a similar thing to what we saw in ferguson and i think that you can explain that by one of
[3:56:40.120 --> 3:56:45.560]  two things they're either funded by george soros to go there and cause chaos or these are just
[3:56:45.560 --> 3:56:51.640]  criminals these are just lowlifes who just want to take advantage of a situation and go loot or rob
[3:56:51.640 --> 3:56:57.880]  or just be on tv um whatever it is it'll be really interesting to see what happens um i guess the
[3:56:57.880 --> 3:57:02.760]  game the football game this sunday that's going to be in charlotte is still on so it'll be very
[3:57:02.760 --> 3:57:08.120]  interesting to see if if anything happens then i'm sure there's going to be some peaceful protesters
[3:57:08.120 --> 3:57:13.800]  outside uh but get to this article i think um i think you know what it is and i think that i have
[3:57:13.800 --> 3:57:18.760]  the solution right here okay you know we we got these protests going on we got police brutality
[3:57:18.760 --> 3:57:25.880]  well bloomberg.com has the solution to all of it want to slow climate change stop having babies
[3:57:25.880 --> 3:57:30.760]  folks i'm quoting this this is this is an article from bloomberg i'm reading directly carbon dioxide
[3:57:30.760 --> 3:57:37.400]  doesn't kill climates people do and the world would be better off with fewer of them oh my god
[3:57:37.400 --> 3:57:42.040]  where have we heard this before well of course ted talks when bill gates you know talks about using
[3:57:42.040 --> 3:57:48.200]  his vaccines to get the population down to zero this is real okay the eugenicists are taking the
[3:57:48.200 --> 3:57:54.440]  mask off they hate you they hate you this is bloomberg who is bloomberg's audience this is already
[3:57:54.440 --> 3:57:59.720]  people who maybe even have one child but they wait so long to have a child because they're overly
[3:57:59.720 --> 3:58:03.400]  educated and they might decide to have one kid but then they can't because they wait it's like an
[3:58:03.400 --> 3:58:08.200]  idiocracy yeah it's like yeah so you're basically telling your audience who's already taken the
[3:58:08.200 --> 3:58:13.000]  advice of the globalist from back in the 70s to stop having children can you imagine leon if info
