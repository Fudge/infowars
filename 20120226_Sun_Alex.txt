[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.360 --> 00:09.360]  Waging war on corruption
[00:11.400 --> 00:17.480]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:21.800 --> 00:26.040]  Well, we are live ladies and gentlemen coming to you from the
[00:26.040 --> 00:31.960]  Orlando Hollis Center than it is decades and decades of history has never sold out
[00:35.280 --> 00:37.600]  How many hey folks
[00:38.720 --> 00:43.560]  You know what we come back from break in the next time because some stations don't carry this segment I'll ask that question
[00:43.560 --> 00:46.280]  But I'm curious. How many years has this been here?
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.280]  50 plus years it's never sold out and it is a sellout crowd here tonight
[00:53.280 --> 00:59.280]  We've got the doors open and people starting to file in we're about two hours away from the kickoff
[00:59.720 --> 01:05.340]  Of my speech in a documentary film. I'm in a premiere and a lot more here in Orlando
[01:06.400 --> 01:11.400]  810 and the great crew that's here. I really enjoy all the shows that are on the air here
[01:11.400 --> 01:13.520]  I really like this affiliate and I like the fact that the
[01:14.120 --> 01:19.800]  Program director and station manager Carl actually is the type of guy that'll actually call people up and talk to him
[01:19.800 --> 01:24.080]  So he's an interesting fellow. I had to come out here and meet him in about six months ago or so
[01:24.080 --> 01:27.120]  I said y'all come out there and I'll speak to you guys and
[01:27.840 --> 01:33.120]  Because he asked and now it's got me in trouble because we've got over a hundred AM and FM affiliates now
[01:33.120 --> 01:38.640]  They're all saying you will come to our town, you know, we're on in Tampa. We're on three or four other stations in Florida
[01:38.640 --> 01:40.640]  They're all like, why are you not coming here?
[01:41.040 --> 01:44.840]  Well, I will not allow the TSA when I was my family to grab their genitals
[01:44.840 --> 01:51.240]  That's I'm un-American in America. The new American flag will be someone's genitals being squeezed. I guess no
[01:51.240 --> 01:56.320]  I'm serious like an ostrich having his genitals squeezed. Excuse me. I'm not trying to be funny. It's disgusting
[01:56.960 --> 01:58.960]  And so I I'm driving in an RV
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.040]  So I barely got enough time to then race back to Austin
[02:02.080 --> 02:05.000]  So I spoken down with them speaking here is kind of a beta test
[02:05.120 --> 02:10.680]  But I do intend to try these trips every two months or so and try to visit five or six affiliates on each swath
[02:11.440 --> 02:12.960]  through the country
[02:12.960 --> 02:17.880]  But the future I probably won't bring my children with me on every trip because let me tell you that turns into a three-ring circus
[02:17.880 --> 02:21.200]  Your wife your three children and the two French Bulldogs
[02:21.920 --> 02:29.960]  Hurdling down the road. All right in the next two hours. I plan on getting some of the local talk show hosts and also we are change
[02:31.320 --> 02:33.320]  activist group from
[02:33.480 --> 02:39.240]  Right here in Florida who they're in Pinellas County a million people in that county just got the floor
[02:39.240 --> 02:45.000]  I've taken out last year. I plan to try to get them to pop in some of the folks that were coming through
[02:46.440 --> 02:48.560]  Coming up in the second hour today
[02:48.560 --> 02:51.840]  And I will be giving my speech blueprint to defeat the New World Order
[02:51.840 --> 02:57.440]  But after the break, I'm going to get into the news. Here it is out of the Jerusalem Post also winet news
[02:58.120 --> 03:04.840]  It's also in Harat's over in Israel or Harit's people always correct me potato potato Harit's Harat's whatever
[03:04.840 --> 03:09.000]  But here it is. You asked to announce aerial blockade of Syria
[03:10.320 --> 03:14.120]  Now we heard it that eight nine months ago. It wasn't a war
[03:14.240 --> 03:18.880]  It was just drones and jet aircraft blowing up the country and putting al-Qaeda in charge
[03:18.880 --> 03:23.460]  And I'm told that I love the Muslim extremists because I don't want to put al-Qaeda in charge. That's
[03:24.280 --> 03:26.280]  common sense would show insane
[03:26.560 --> 03:31.800]  But we're going to be breaking that down today. It's a big deal. It's another war and
[03:31.800 --> 03:37.280]  And what happens is the corrupt interests that run our country sinned in proxy armies
[03:37.280 --> 03:42.840]  basically Saudi Arabian terrorists and others the Wahhabist and they then attack
[03:43.360 --> 03:49.760]  They then attack these countries like Libya and Syria and I'm not saying could offer you a shot or good people
[03:49.760 --> 03:54.040]  the point is those were stable regimes that were even working with the West in many cases and
[03:54.240 --> 04:00.500]  Then they put the extremists in and destroy the country and start ethnic and religious cleansing and the Christians get thrown out
[04:00.500 --> 04:05.900]  And that's what al-Qaeda has said in Syria. They said we're gonna kill the Christians. We're not going to just kick you out
[04:05.900 --> 04:09.560]  We get you we're gonna kill you of course Christians have been there since the time of Paul
[04:09.700 --> 04:16.180]  He was on the road to Damascus and getting knocked off his horse. That's 2,000 years ago roughly, but no more
[04:16.580 --> 04:22.780]  No more because we have to put al-Qaeda in to kill the Christians because we're fighting the Muslim extremists
[04:23.380 --> 04:25.180]  And again, I'm
[04:25.180 --> 04:30.000]  Erica because I don't want the TSA going in my pants, and I don't like al-Qaeda, but there you go
[04:30.100 --> 04:34.740]  So we're gonna be breaking that down huge news another giant war ahead of an attack on
[04:35.540 --> 04:40.940]  Iran as well with the cover and then after the break also World Bank wants to control the high seas
[04:41.340 --> 04:44.140]  And this is just a 21 over the oceans
[04:44.340 --> 04:48.100]  We're gonna be breaking that down and also all over the US England Canada you name it
[04:48.340 --> 04:54.340]  Parents from being arrested if their children draw images of guns the nanny state is the enslavement state
[04:54.340 --> 04:57.020]  It's all coming up today the 26th of
[04:58.020 --> 05:00.020]  February this Sunday stay with us
[05:00.300 --> 05:02.020]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones
[05:02.020 --> 05:09.180]  And I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[05:09.180 --> 05:12.580]  Into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs
[05:13.100 --> 05:19.220]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator
[05:19.220 --> 05:27.340]  Infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano particles
[05:27.660 --> 05:33.180]  Instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products
[05:33.260 --> 05:38.540]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator
[05:38.820 --> 05:44.940]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to
[05:44.940 --> 05:51.660]  www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator
[05:51.660 --> 05:54.660]  That's www.silverlungs.com
[06:02.900 --> 06:07.220]  You are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report
[06:07.220 --> 06:13.740]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[06:21.060 --> 06:25.300]  From deep in the heart of FEMA region 6 Austin, Texas
[06:26.380 --> 06:29.540]  Transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[06:29.540 --> 06:40.540]  But I'm not coming to you from FEMA region 6 as my Sunday radio show liner introduces me that's Texas under the
[06:40.860 --> 06:48.660]  6th region of the FEMA command system of the New World Order and North com that is over the United States
[06:48.660 --> 06:54.820]  Now I come to you from deep in the heart of Florida or Lando where they've got the
[06:56.300 --> 06:58.300]  Where they've got the big NASCAR
[06:58.300 --> 07:00.900]  Race going on right now
[07:01.620 --> 07:06.700]  And they've also got Obama here for the NBA all-star game, but I am here
[07:07.100 --> 07:11.300]  To give a speech after the radio show to a capacity crowd of over
[07:12.220 --> 07:14.220]  1,000 people
[07:16.620 --> 07:18.420]  They tell me that this
[07:18.420 --> 07:24.100]  Orlando highlight facility was built in the late 1950s more than more than 50 years ago
[07:24.100 --> 07:28.620]  And that it is never sold out this very nice auditorium
[07:29.420 --> 07:32.020]  In here, but tonight is different in fact
[07:32.020 --> 07:38.620]  They're even selling overflow tickets to the spoke to the broadcaster sports boxes up above us
[07:38.620 --> 07:44.580]  So that shows that liberty and freedom are popular and you can't suppress the signal of human
[07:44.580 --> 07:52.900]  Destiny and human desire to not be slaves just like even if they engage in election fraud and block Ron Paul
[07:53.860 --> 07:57.100]  It doesn't matter. He really is still winning
[07:58.860 --> 08:03.780]  Even if he doesn't win the presidency he wins by getting the word out now again
[08:03.780 --> 08:07.180]  We just opened the doors and I don't know a few hundred people have come in so far to
[08:07.620 --> 08:11.180]  Hear the radio broadcast and see it in the flesh
[08:11.180 --> 08:18.060]  And we're gonna again watch this fill up the next two hours or so before I give my speech and we are broadcasting to
[08:18.660 --> 08:25.420]  Millions of people right now as well and also simulcasting video at prisonplanet.tv
[08:26.260 --> 08:29.380]  I want to say the great folks here at the
[08:29.820 --> 08:31.340]  Big 810
[08:31.340 --> 08:37.360]  Talker in Orlando are just wonderful folks. I've met much of the crew many of the talk show hosts the local talk show
[08:37.360 --> 08:41.300]  I was wonderful people are gonna have some of them popping in in the second hour
[08:41.820 --> 08:47.220]  And I want to say something here about all of our affiliates before I get into the news. I don't talk enough about the fact
[08:48.380 --> 08:50.020]  Several issues here
[08:50.020 --> 08:56.300]  That we are on over a hundred AM and FM stations despite how quote radical and dangerous
[08:56.620 --> 09:02.100]  I am as much of the corporate prostitute media has said it shows that
[09:02.100 --> 09:07.020]  Freedom is an idea whose time has come that more and more stations are picking us up
[09:07.020 --> 09:11.620]  But still to put it somebody on the radio that once the bill of rights and Constitution
[09:11.940 --> 09:14.780]  It will defend the Republic 110 percent
[09:15.460 --> 09:22.220]  That is unprecedented and so there there is courage with our AM and FM affiliates to put this on the air
[09:22.220 --> 09:27.060]  Just like there's courage in the last two years for XM channel 166 to put the weekday show on
[09:27.060 --> 09:33.220]  Because as Mark Twain said in the beginning a patriot is a scarce and feared man
[09:34.220 --> 09:41.380]  Hated and scorned but in a time when his cause succeeds the timid join him because then it cost nothing
[09:41.820 --> 09:46.460]  To be a patriot and that is certainly the case and I just want to say the people that are here tonight
[09:47.140 --> 09:53.660]  Are the type of folks that are actually looking for liberty and freedom and who are involved and I salute you for being here
[09:53.660 --> 09:59.860]  You're awesome now I salute you I salute you
[10:00.620 --> 10:08.780]  Now I want to get into some of the news just huge news all of it is obviously off the charts and unfortunately is exactly
[10:09.060 --> 10:14.740]  What we've predicted would happen, but I do want to thank all of our AM and FM affiliates
[10:14.740 --> 10:19.340]  I do want to thank all of our sponsors our listeners the program directors out there
[10:19.340 --> 10:26.740]  I mean take somebody like Mark Caesar in Austin, Texas who now for over six years has had us on 590 a.m. That
[10:27.580 --> 10:32.100]  Used to be owned by President Lyndon Baines Johnson. You know that shows how far
[10:32.620 --> 10:37.060]  The American spirit has come that our message of liberty is
[10:37.620 --> 10:44.420]  Resonating across this country and we are now reaching more than 15 million people in the aggregate every week
[10:44.420 --> 10:52.860]  That is not a testament to Alex Jones. That is a bellwether a gauge a yardstick a measurement of the incredible
[10:53.540 --> 10:55.540]  Awakening taking place
[11:01.580 --> 11:03.580]  Now some of the news coming up
[11:03.900 --> 11:07.340]  US to announce aerial blockade of Syria
[11:07.580 --> 11:12.540]  That's all over the Israeli all over the Arab all over the European and in some of the US news
[11:12.540 --> 11:20.420]  Remember just four months ago. Hillary Clinton said, oh, we'll never attack Syria and now they're saying this is not a
[11:21.700 --> 11:27.500]  War no, this is not a war. We're just gonna start bombing them
[11:28.100 --> 11:36.740]  Because bombing people is not a war remember what happened eight months ago. Well, Obama said to Congress. Hey, I don't need your approval to
[11:37.580 --> 11:38.620]  liberate
[11:38.620 --> 11:44.700]  Libya dropping 2,000 pound bombs all over the country and blowing up their cities and now killing at least 35,000 people
[11:44.700 --> 11:47.700]  They admit nothing cleansing and putting al Qaeda in he said
[11:47.700 --> 11:51.300]  I have the UN's authority and put out a public statement
[11:51.860 --> 11:58.060]  Saying I get my authority from the UN and I do this for the credibility of the United Nations
[11:58.060 --> 12:05.140]  Even if you were for the war at least call it a war and get congressional approval and Congress said we love war
[12:05.140 --> 12:11.140]  We want to vote for this, but you've got to come dust for authorization and he told him go to where the sun
[12:11.540 --> 12:20.340]  Doesn't shine. I'm going to the UN if that isn't treason. I don't know what is he's saying our Congress isn't even a doormat
[12:20.660 --> 12:22.660]  Our Congress is vestigial
[12:23.340 --> 12:26.340]  ceremonial and doesn't even exist
[12:27.620 --> 12:29.620]  Does that make you angry out there?
[12:29.620 --> 12:34.940]  Let me hear your war growl
[12:40.940 --> 12:42.940]  Let me hear it
[12:45.700 --> 12:48.220]  That's not good enough private Joker
[12:49.220 --> 12:52.380]  Now we're doing lines from full metal jacket
[12:52.380 --> 12:59.140]  I can't wait in the next hour and 45 minutes as this thing fills up of the kickoff at seven
[12:59.140 --> 13:01.140]  We get over a thousand people in here and roar
[13:01.900 --> 13:03.900]  on three I
[13:04.500 --> 13:08.540]  Want to say death to the new world order death to tyranny
[13:09.780 --> 13:11.780]  We will defend liberty
[13:11.980 --> 13:15.940]  So we're gonna say death the new world order on three one two three
[13:15.940 --> 13:21.820]  Two three death to the new world order. Yeah
[13:25.860 --> 13:27.860]  System doesn't like that
[13:28.700 --> 13:35.100]  By the way, I heard doc Holliday who has the show on before me mornings here on a 10 our great affiliate
[13:35.620 --> 13:38.300]  In Orlando by the way, I forgot to mention
[13:39.140 --> 13:45.280]  The instant ratings. I love those now that the instant ratings are coming in the people
[13:45.280 --> 13:48.600]  You know meters where people agree to have a little meter in their car
[13:48.600 --> 13:53.600]  They've also got billboards because all receivers actually transmit if they're am or fm and
[13:54.440 --> 13:58.360]  Since he's been going in the last few years everywhere. We're on even little stations
[13:58.360 --> 14:02.200]  They tense, you know big blowtorch and always had you know pretty good ratings
[14:02.680 --> 14:06.840]  That's why we took it from like number three or four to number one in the last
[14:07.800 --> 14:11.600]  Instant ratings number one across the board. What do you think of that?
[14:11.600 --> 14:16.400]  You know why is this not those stupid diaries that quite frankly?
[14:16.400 --> 14:20.520]  The big industry secret is only the illegals fill up because they need the money. I'm not blaming them
[14:20.520 --> 14:22.080]  I understand they need the money
[14:22.080 --> 14:27.240]  But it's just that's why all the stations, you know went to basically Spanish five or six years ago
[14:27.240 --> 14:31.600]  Because that was the only folks on average filling out the diaries now that they have the instant meters in there
[14:31.600 --> 14:35.040]  Actually finding out what people actually listen to and we absolutely
[14:36.040 --> 14:40.240]  annihilated Lord Limbaugh right up against him live head to head
[14:40.240 --> 14:48.200]  Dominating and smashing him and we'll do it everywhere. We're on if they'll put me on the field on big stations like 810
[14:48.200 --> 14:51.920]  I will dominate neocon fake rhinos every day
[14:53.080 --> 14:55.080]  And the system knows it
[14:56.400 --> 15:00.560]  Let me tell you about neocon right wing gatekeepers folks and again
[15:01.080 --> 15:04.280]  Rush Limbaugh helped wake me up 20 years ago. I'm not even saying he's a bad guy
[15:05.280 --> 15:10.120]  But he you know says there's no new world order no world government while the head of the UN two weeks ago
[15:10.120 --> 15:15.600]  Called for world government world taxes over everything jet travel gasoline money transfers
[15:15.600 --> 15:18.320]  It's all over that the Economist magazine
[15:18.640 --> 15:20.640]  Davos Switzerland and
[15:20.640 --> 15:28.200]  He and others still make fun of anybody that talks about it like I pick up the Economist or I play clips of the head of the EU
[15:28.200 --> 15:33.800]  Calling for world government or Obama calling for global government or his or his staff is his and they're like
[15:33.800 --> 15:40.520]  Oh, that's that kooky guy that gets angry about sovereignty and wants to keep his guns. You know
[15:40.520 --> 15:45.640]  We're gonna start really defeating tyranny when we stop letting the left and right gatekeepers control us
[15:45.640 --> 15:50.840]  And the good news is even though the left and right told us there wasn't a world government forming
[15:50.880 --> 15:55.880]  We were able to expose that it was happening and now we've got a good chance of beating it
[15:55.880 --> 16:00.280]  I want to give you some good news straight ahead and then huge news your daughter draws a gun
[16:00.280 --> 16:05.680]  You enjoyed everything I'd cut back the amount of food. I was eating. I was lifting weights and jogging
[16:05.680 --> 16:06.880]  But nothing was working
[16:06.880 --> 16:13.720]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I
[16:14.240 --> 16:19.120]  Immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied now
[16:19.120 --> 16:22.000]  There are hundreds of great products at info wars team.com
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.240]  But I want to point out the three that have helped me lose
[16:26.400 --> 16:29.320]  37 pounds in just two months
[16:29.320 --> 16:37.640]  Products like beyond tangy tangerine pollen burst and rebound when I started taking the tangy tangerine and other products every day
[16:37.640 --> 16:42.120]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months now. That's results
[16:42.120 --> 16:48.880]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to info wars team.com and to order just three of their products

[20:01.160 --> 20:07.920]  Coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[20:14.080 --> 20:20.360]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[20:20.360 --> 20:25.440]  And we are back coming to you from beautiful Orlando, Florida
[20:28.840 --> 20:31.000]  And this reminds me why I like Florida
[20:32.120 --> 20:37.680]  And we're staying just at some little hotel by the edge of a golf course and if you go outside and there's like
[20:38.000 --> 20:45.400]  Tropical birds hopping around and flowers everywhere. I like this. I like central, Texas Austin's great, but it's been in a drought
[20:45.400 --> 20:50.280]  It's kind of like living in the middle of a Western movie or something. This is more like living in a jungle
[20:50.280 --> 20:54.320]  So I love it good to be here with everybody under the loving eye of Disney
[20:54.840 --> 20:59.160]  All right, I need to start getting into the news for all of our listeners out there, but
[20:59.840 --> 21:04.280]  Getting into positive news. We have to stop and I'm gonna talk about this in my speech tonight
[21:04.800 --> 21:11.720]  Letting the gatekeepers just because they've got a fancy teleprompter in a fancy suit or though the big talk show host authority
[21:11.720 --> 21:15.560]  dictate reality to us and
[21:16.080 --> 21:21.160]  And say you can't talk about this you can't question authority or you're a conspiracy theorist
[21:21.160 --> 21:25.880]  If you question known government liars that have been caught lying thousands of times
[21:26.560 --> 21:32.680]  If you don't trust big mega giant corporations that are in control of governments worldwide today
[21:33.600 --> 21:38.560]  Then you're a bad person for questioning them. No, that's what makes me so proud
[21:38.560 --> 21:44.880]  You're a bad person for questioning them. No, that's what made America great was questioning and not trusting government
[21:44.880 --> 21:46.760]  What did George Washington say?
[21:46.760 --> 21:49.320]  government is like fire a
[21:50.040 --> 21:54.680]  dangerous servant and a fearful master now
[21:56.160 --> 22:01.680]  They've said that the Southern Prairie Law Center and others would demonize somebody like George Washington today if he was alive
[22:01.920 --> 22:04.040]  Well, they don't do it just because he's
[22:05.040 --> 22:07.040]  Alive in our hearts and minds
[22:07.040 --> 22:09.760]  They do it FEMA the rest of them
[22:09.760 --> 22:16.400]  I have the videos and films like road to tyranny that the police officers and others have sent me where it shows FEMA actually
[22:16.960 --> 22:21.520]  Demonizing the founding fathers and they had articles in Philadelphia newspaper
[22:22.320 --> 22:24.720]  Just a few months ago and BBC picked it up
[22:25.280 --> 22:30.280]  Asking the question is the Declaration of Independence illegal and they said yes
[22:30.280 --> 22:34.200]  It is because it says you have a right to overthrow a corrupt government
[22:34.200 --> 22:37.080]  And the government now says you don't have that right because they're God
[22:37.240 --> 22:43.080]  It's about government dictating to you and Madison Avenue and this whole manufactured plastic culture
[22:43.440 --> 22:47.400]  Telling you what to think how to how to dress how to speak
[22:48.040 --> 22:50.040]  Try and turn you into a plastic person
[22:50.040 --> 22:57.160]  And so on the left and the right these big globalist Foundation controlled shows have told you there's no corruption
[22:57.240 --> 23:03.720]  That's a conspiracy theory. Don't be involved. There's no global government. There's no CFR. There's no new world order
[23:03.720 --> 23:11.880]  There's no plan. Oh for international banks to take over now. They admit open world private government taking over Europe
[23:12.760 --> 23:15.160]  Buy mega banks that put their people in charge of those countries
[23:15.560 --> 23:20.520]  Now talk about this at nauseam because it's the key open world government being announced
[23:20.760 --> 23:26.920]  And because we didn't care about being attacked for decades exposing what the the real agenda was and because Ron Paul
[23:26.920 --> 23:33.480]  Didn't mind being attacked because we all knew as it came out in the open as it as this agenda expanded
[23:33.720 --> 23:38.440]  People would then finally listen and now because it's out in the open people are
[23:39.160 --> 23:44.760]  Listening and we're moving into check and the next move is checkmate against the globalist
[23:45.000 --> 23:50.600]  But that doesn't mean that they can't put us in check or checkmate as well. We're in the fight
[23:51.080 --> 23:53.640]  That's the good news that I can give you here today
[23:53.640 --> 23:58.360]  Let me give you one example of this. I'm going to move on to contemporary important big breaking news right now
[23:59.800 --> 24:06.120]  You remember 15 16 17 18 years ago or so. I remember when I was first politically active 20 years ago
[24:07.240 --> 24:09.240]  the the mainstream media
[24:09.320 --> 24:12.360]  Uh would come out to people like Pat Buchanan and others
[24:12.920 --> 24:19.320]  And say you shouldn't be running for president on defending the second amendment. Nobody wants to take your guns
[24:19.320 --> 24:23.000]  Remember back when they would say no one wants to take your guns
[24:23.160 --> 24:30.040]  We just want to ban all the semi-automatics and make you turn them in and and and have waiting periods and make you lock them up
[24:30.040 --> 24:33.160]  In your house and not have one in the house if you've got children
[24:33.400 --> 24:38.920]  How many people remember 20 years ago back when the mainstream media who's not even mainstream anymore?
[24:39.000 --> 24:46.600]  They're the dead dinosaur media would say. Oh, we just want reasonable gun control. We don't want to take your guns. Remember that
[24:46.600 --> 24:48.600]  Yeah
[24:48.680 --> 24:53.400]  You remember it. Okay, exactly everybody remembers it and they still try it some today
[24:54.040 --> 24:59.800]  But all the quotes of the brady center and and and the handgun control groups and all these people
[25:00.200 --> 25:07.560]  They all bragged in their own documents that it was the individual abolition of firearms ownership the un on july 7th
[25:07.800 --> 25:10.760]  2000 put out an official report in new york at a convention
[25:10.760 --> 25:17.400]  They had a meeting a conference a conclave and they put it into un law that their goal is global
[25:18.040 --> 25:20.040]  disarmament of the public here's the quote
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.160]  civilian ownership of any firearm threatens the legitimate
[25:25.960 --> 25:33.640]  power monopoly of the state they believe a power monopoly of government over you absolute dictatorship of the state is
[25:34.360 --> 25:35.480]  legitimate
[25:35.480 --> 25:41.560]  But the point is they want your guns and they're saying total abolition of individual ownership of guns
[25:41.720 --> 25:45.960]  And the minute people stopped having debates about oh, just be reasonable
[25:46.040 --> 25:50.600]  Let us restrict it some and then come back a year later. Let us restrict it some more
[25:51.080 --> 25:57.480]  Oh, no as soon as we got angry and took action. They're even repealing gun laws now in canada
[25:57.720 --> 26:00.520]  They just repealed the long rifle or
[26:00.520 --> 26:05.000]  Or a long gun registry last week
[26:05.640 --> 26:10.040]  Because they passed a gun registration and started using it to confiscate guns
[26:10.280 --> 26:15.960]  And the public got angry and took action in a system that's much harder to affect change
[26:16.040 --> 26:21.000]  And it was the first major gun law in the world outside of the u.s
[26:21.320 --> 26:28.680]  Reversed in the last hundred years that I know of an nra and gun owners of america should the exact same thing
[26:28.680 --> 26:35.640]  The first victim disarmament piece of legislation reversed in a century outside of the united states
[26:36.440 --> 26:42.680]  Think about that. We've reversed a few things here, but the first one outside of america. That's what I call
[26:43.640 --> 26:45.640]  1776 worldwide
[26:47.480 --> 26:50.200]  If we're going to be free we got to have freedom worldwide
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.480]  And the idea of freedom is so cool so sexy so hot so awesome so
[26:57.480 --> 27:01.160]  So fantastic so powerful so alluring
[27:01.800 --> 27:08.280]  That when you stack it up against tyranny and corruption and insider crony anti free market capitalism
[27:09.400 --> 27:14.760]  When you stack freedom up against that we win so everybody that thinks it's impossible to defeat the globalist
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.960]  It's impossible to lose win good men and women stand up and take action
[27:20.120 --> 27:26.680]  I cannot stress that enough to you that we have got to take action more of that coming up in my speech
[27:26.680 --> 27:32.440]  We're having so many victories every time people stand up and bring the real medical literature
[27:32.840 --> 27:36.600]  About fluoride in our water and the seven-fold increase in bone cancer
[27:36.760 --> 27:39.320]  And the fact that the government's own scientists say take it out
[27:39.560 --> 27:46.040]  But the special eugenics interest wanted added to increase cancer and reduced fertility in every city where people resist
[27:46.280 --> 27:48.440]  And resist and resist for at least three years
[27:48.680 --> 27:55.080]  It's removed and just a few miles away from us in in panellas county right at a million people
[27:55.080 --> 28:00.920]  Tampa is in that county. They removed fluoride from all of the water supplies
[28:03.240 --> 28:08.200]  60 years of globalist spending money millions of sometimes to get that into the water
[28:09.160 --> 28:13.800]  Because they love you so much and all over the country all over the world in in in calgary canada
[28:13.800 --> 28:20.600]  They just removed it in areas of england in europe. They're removing it. They're removing it all over now. The globalists have struck back
[28:20.600 --> 28:25.880]  The globalists came in with millions of dollars in new jersey and arkansas
[28:26.520 --> 28:29.640]  And they're trying it in every state right now and have now passed mandatory
[28:30.200 --> 28:35.720]  Fluoridation by law, but now it's not just a recommendation or a contract now
[28:35.800 --> 28:40.840]  They're demanding it now it becomes a civil rights issue a forced medication of the public
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.440]  And so they're going to lose in court now and now government openly wants lithium in the water and statins
[28:46.440 --> 28:50.360]  We told you that was in documents years ago and showed you now. They're openly pushing it
[28:50.680 --> 28:58.120]  We'll be right back with the build-up towards war with syria and iran and a lot more stay with us live in orlando florida
[29:00.280 --> 29:01.880]  A little over a year ago
[29:01.880 --> 29:07.400]  I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving
[29:07.560 --> 29:13.720]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states
[29:13.720 --> 29:18.920]  And across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[29:19.400 --> 29:25.240]  Minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy
[29:25.400 --> 29:31.400]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered young jevity

[34:32.760 --> 34:34.120]  Amazing
[34:34.120 --> 34:38.360]  Liberty is popular by the way. I'm gonna have again a local talk show host in here
[34:38.360 --> 34:40.520]  He was telling me about this a few days ago
[34:41.240 --> 34:45.320]  I was a guest on his show and I went and looked up the news articles and it turned out it was true
[34:45.320 --> 34:51.800]  But I still found it shocking a doc holiday was telling me that they have whole highways shut down for the nba all-star game
[34:52.120 --> 34:54.120]  And that they have checkpoints
[34:54.120 --> 35:00.040]  Uh, even in the business districts and that uh, they're blocking off the local businesses. So they can't get any of the
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  Traffic and that they have motorcades
[35:04.040 --> 35:08.840]  For the mba people. I actually saw one driving over here
[35:12.520 --> 35:15.720]  I'm somebody forking pig. It's I'm speechless here
[35:16.920 --> 35:18.920]  There were probably 10 or more
[35:18.920 --> 35:24.520]  More motorcycle police like it was the president or something for a bus of nba people
[35:24.760 --> 35:30.840]  Driving down the highway like it's the road warrior and the citizens are going to attack them if they weren't there protecting
[35:31.640 --> 35:34.120]  Meanwhile our tax money is paying for it
[35:34.680 --> 35:38.280]  Um, I checked our your tax money here is paying for it
[35:38.280 --> 35:42.600]  Just like you pay for the billion dollar sports stadiums and then you're charged overpriced tickets
[35:42.600 --> 35:45.240]  You're treated like garbage and you pay for the motorcade
[35:45.240 --> 35:51.080]  Uh protection from you who's paying for them to look and act important. That's what this is all about
[35:51.320 --> 35:57.640]  I've seen presidents like when obama comes to town. They shut down whole highways. There's I've seen him with like 50 cars
[35:58.200 --> 36:00.200]  protecting him like he's
[36:01.240 --> 36:08.680]  God or something landing in town. It's absolutely ridiculous and all of it is done so that you
[36:10.200 --> 36:13.160]  See these leaders as actually leaders and not the puppets
[36:13.160 --> 36:17.560]  They are all the real power elite like the Rothschilds the Rockefellers and others
[36:17.800 --> 36:22.040]  Do everything they can to hide their wealth every time every Rockefeller gets up to give a speech
[36:22.040 --> 36:25.000]  He goes, I'm just an old retired banker
[36:26.360 --> 36:29.400]  I'm so honored that you're giving me this award
[36:29.960 --> 36:32.760]  And you find out he set up every globalist organization out there
[36:33.320 --> 36:39.560]  I set up all the eugenics organizations and I want to reduce the population. I'm just a little banker
[36:39.560 --> 36:42.920]  All right continuing here
[36:43.640 --> 36:45.800]  Do you remember eight months ago? Well a year ago?
[36:46.040 --> 36:48.040]  They overthrew hazing lubaric
[36:48.120 --> 36:52.280]  The dictator that the banks that run this country because I don't want to say we put in
[36:52.520 --> 36:58.680]  But the people that took us over for the banking and government system the folks that put him in charge that torture and kill tens of thousands
[36:58.680 --> 37:00.040]  And all the rest of it
[37:00.040 --> 37:06.280]  I'm not saying hazing lubaric's a good guy the point is the crooks that run our country the foreign banks that have hijacked our nation
[37:06.280 --> 37:11.960]  They put him there. They they they would send people there for him to torture
[37:12.040 --> 37:19.640]  Including american citizens at the quote black sites secret sites ghost sites as they call and then they overthrow him
[37:19.880 --> 37:23.880]  They send in the cia and state department people to overthrow him a year ago
[37:24.120 --> 37:30.200]  They put the muslim brotherhood in and they actually put al-qaeda connected groups in and now they're taking women's rights
[37:30.280 --> 37:36.040]  Christians are being persecuted and lecturing me that i've got to have the government take my rights
[37:36.040 --> 37:37.400]  spy on me
[37:37.400 --> 37:44.600]  Grab my genitals it must stops and train stations now not just the airports and take all my rights because al-qaeda is such a threat
[37:44.760 --> 37:49.640]  While the stinking criminal banker occupied government is putting al-qaeda in
[37:50.600 --> 37:56.440]  But they didn't stop in egypt getting out their old dictator and putting something in even worse. Did he stabilize the country?
[37:58.200 --> 38:03.640]  Then they go into libya start bombing it for six seven months killing over 35 000 people
[38:03.640 --> 38:11.480]  They bring in real al-qaeda. They fly up al-qaeda flags al-qaeda is with the special forces calling in the airstrikes
[38:11.800 --> 38:18.520]  They now admit it's al-qaeda at real al-qaeda and now they're sending them into syria with three proxy armies attacking Assad
[38:18.760 --> 38:25.000]  Who again? I don't like mubarak. I don't like qaddafi. I don't like Assad. These are guys all that started working with the west
[38:25.640 --> 38:29.640]  That's why they got set up. It shows this the globalist went total destabilization
[38:29.640 --> 38:35.000]  And and and craziness to then have new wars with the al-qaeda forces. They put in later
[38:35.400 --> 38:40.600]  This is full spectrum dominance where the globalists launch these wars so they can take the rights of the arabs
[38:41.000 --> 38:46.200]  And of the american people you see the banks sit above it playing both sides off against each other
[38:46.920 --> 38:53.560]  This is such a classic tactic of divide and conquer of of divide and rule of balkanization
[38:53.560 --> 39:00.920]  And now they are announcing u.s. To announce aerial blockade of syria harats jerusalem post
[39:01.800 --> 39:04.840]  winet news, they're all reporting u.s. Ready's for possible
[39:05.480 --> 39:08.680]  a possibility of intervention without u.n resolution
[39:09.320 --> 39:10.360]  Oh
[39:10.360 --> 39:13.960]  Last time they got the u.n resolution for the peace action like the u.n's the boss
[39:14.520 --> 39:20.040]  Of course, that's a puppet the bankers set up to begin with and it goes on a site in u.s. Military official
[39:20.040 --> 39:28.600]  Planned to include humanitarian aid to syria refugees on turkish border so so an invasion is not a war
[39:29.480 --> 39:31.720]  Tens of thousands of bombs dropped
[39:31.720 --> 39:34.120]  Blowing up apartment buildings shooting people
[39:34.760 --> 39:38.360]  Ethnic cleansing of the of the black living ins that they that the media now admits
[39:38.520 --> 39:46.840]  We first reported that when webster tarpoli was willing to actually go over there under bombardment and drive in out of tunisia
[39:46.840 --> 39:51.160]  Under bombardment. I mean I had him on the show when air raid sirens are going
[39:56.920 --> 39:58.440]  He's off the air
[39:58.440 --> 40:01.880]  And he's there going there killing black people everywhere mowing them down on the streets
[40:02.040 --> 40:06.920]  You know, they're taking over three months later la times new york magazine all of them
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.040]  Oh, yeah, they lined them up and shoot them in the head or hacked their heads off the machetes
[40:10.680 --> 40:12.520]  They're like it's liberal
[40:12.520 --> 40:18.520]  You know give your rights up, you know a support world government or you hate black people but murder them and you're liberal
[40:19.160 --> 40:24.920]  And again love al-qaeda murder black people. It's it's trendy fight al-qaeda by putting al-qaeda in charge
[40:25.240 --> 40:26.920]  This is the complete
[40:26.920 --> 40:32.600]  Psycho out of control crazy garbage that i'm talking about. I'm not that smart folks
[40:32.600 --> 40:37.400]  This is all common sense in your face. All you've got to do is start paying
[40:37.960 --> 40:41.320]  Attention to how crazy this is and now they're about to do it again
[40:41.320 --> 40:45.480]  Now they've got al-qaeda nbc reported two weeks ago
[40:45.480 --> 40:52.040]  But we already knew al-qaeda attacking and blowing up bases and assassinating people and throwing magnet mines
[40:52.760 --> 40:55.720]  onto people's cars all over iran
[40:56.600 --> 40:59.640]  And killing them trying to get iran to respond militarily
[41:00.280 --> 41:03.880]  And then our news tells us but iran works with al-qaeda
[41:04.200 --> 41:10.040]  But al-qaeda actually works with the criminals that run our government and is attacking iran and attacking syria
[41:10.040 --> 41:15.800]  And now they're going to start the love bombs again and congress isn't needed the un isn't needed now
[41:16.520 --> 41:20.120]  Now it's just going to be the bankers themselves. Oh, we can't get a fake un approval
[41:20.280 --> 41:24.440]  We can't get congressional approval because we won't go to them and act like they're actually the boss
[41:24.840 --> 41:29.080]  We'll just we won't even say where it's coming from and we won't even call it a war
[41:30.120 --> 41:33.720]  You see they told you there's no gun control. We don't want to take your guns
[41:34.600 --> 41:39.400]  And as soon as we said you do want to take our guns and got the reports of them saying we're bitter clingers
[41:39.400 --> 41:42.840]  And they're going to get our guns as soon as we said no you are trying to take them
[41:43.320 --> 41:48.760]  Everybody woke up now their gun grab is in deep trouble everywhere gun laws are being reversed everywhere
[41:49.400 --> 41:52.120]  Okay, real gun control of hitting the target is now coming in
[41:52.600 --> 41:54.120]  It's the same thing on world government
[41:54.200 --> 41:59.000]  They denied world government existed forever and made fun of us and attacked us and demonized anybody that talked about it
[41:59.080 --> 42:01.880]  Does it work anymore world governments now out in the open and they
[42:02.520 --> 42:07.640]  This whole al-qaeda hoax when the cia created it use it against the russians then the serbs
[42:07.640 --> 42:10.600]  On and on and on and on libya
[42:11.480 --> 42:18.840]  Syria i ran al-qaeda al-qaeda al-qaeda al-qaeda and the biggest goofiest lie in the world is hiding in plain view
[42:19.320 --> 42:23.400]  It's hiding completely in plain view in front of all of us
[42:24.040 --> 42:30.280]  That al-qaeda is a banker controlled system. They want to invade a country call al-qaeda freedom for fighters invade the nation
[42:31.880 --> 42:34.920]  You want to take americans liberty blow some stuff up say al-qaeda is doing it
[42:34.920 --> 42:38.040]  Have a few dual, uh, you know agents you set up and kill
[42:38.600 --> 42:41.000]  On and on and on this is how they do it and now they're going to start a new
[42:41.640 --> 42:45.880]  Love bomb attack and and blockades and other things that are acts of war
[42:46.200 --> 42:49.480]  Until you it's not war and you're supposed to go. Oh carl rove

[44:07.320 --> 44:14.120]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and across the
[44:14.120 --> 44:18.680]  Industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[44:19.160 --> 44:25.000]  Minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy

[48:14.840 --> 48:23.640]  And Marvin the Martian coming in out of the red corner a hardcore global communist eugenesis held bent on destroying the planet earth
[48:24.280 --> 48:30.120]  And in the blue corner weighing over 65 trillion tons the colossus of liberty
[48:30.440 --> 48:35.960]  The people of planet earth who will stop marvin the martian into atomic dust
[48:36.760 --> 48:38.760]  Oh dear
[48:38.760 --> 48:44.040]  I didn't write up any comedy, but I'm just having some fun here ladies and gentlemen
[48:44.680 --> 48:48.760]  You know, it's good for me to get out there. There's always there in the command bunker
[48:49.400 --> 48:53.560]  Walking around griping and you know firing info weapons at the enemy
[48:53.880 --> 48:57.240]  It's good to actually be out here on the front lines with you and I love you and it's awesome
[48:57.320 --> 49:00.200]  It was fun storming the texas capital not once but twice. It's like
[49:01.160 --> 49:06.040]  It's impossible that must not be real video of hundreds of people storming the capital
[49:06.040 --> 49:09.720]  They would have arrested him after all he didn't have a permit
[49:10.520 --> 49:17.240]  But see government doesn't know how to deal with that. It's it's about this illusion that it's all powerful and you're scum
[49:17.480 --> 49:21.640]  It's not true. The people have the power
[49:24.280 --> 49:26.600]  I'm like a kid with a mr. Microphone here today
[49:27.560 --> 49:30.360]  You know, I actually do this at the office when I'm like voicing ads and stuff
[49:30.360 --> 49:35.480]  So sometimes I'm sitting there kind of like going this is fine. You know, I was like a little kid again
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  All right, all right, I'm gonna stop it
[49:40.440 --> 49:42.440]  Oh boy
[49:43.080 --> 49:46.760]  You got to try to have a little bit of fun sometimes though when they're trying to start world war three
[49:48.280 --> 49:54.760]  And when the same interests that want to destroy iran want to destroy the liberties and freedoms here in america and they wrap their treason
[49:55.720 --> 49:57.720]  In patriotism. It's just flat wrong
[49:57.720 --> 50:01.880]  Now I've covered the fact that they're about to launch a new bombing campaign
[50:02.440 --> 50:04.680]  But it's freedom though, and it's not violent
[50:05.320 --> 50:12.360]  Because they said so remember carl row told the new york times washington post and a whole bunch of other reporters the cocktail party six years ago
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.720]  They were bringing up lies of the administration. He said it doesn't matter. We control reality
[50:17.720 --> 50:22.360]  We are history's actors. We tell you what to say you will then report that new reality
[50:22.360 --> 50:26.280]  And they actually said yeah, you're you're pretty much god. He said that's right
[50:26.280 --> 50:34.280]  That's why he got your job. Well, see I don't play like that. I'm sorry. I'm an extremist, you know, you lie to me and
[50:36.280 --> 50:42.920]  I catch you lying and you say but it doesn't matter. I'm gonna lie to you because I'm the authority figure. I say
[50:44.280 --> 50:46.280]  Get out of my way
[50:46.280 --> 50:49.800]  It is pathetic. It is a mind game and we have to stop
[50:49.800 --> 50:58.440]  Trusting and supporting and groveling to the system. It is so pathetic and without further ado before I get into a global governance
[50:59.240 --> 51:00.520]  report
[51:00.520 --> 51:02.200]  of the
[51:02.200 --> 51:11.080]  Greatest import World Bank wants control of the high seas and and notice it's the corporate mega bank interest at the World Bank
[51:11.480 --> 51:14.280]  Want a global government run by the UN?
[51:14.280 --> 51:22.200]  Gen to 21 on every waterway, not just the oceans to globally tax and control your water and it's all the links to worldbank.org
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  Calling for global governance
[51:25.720 --> 51:29.640]  run by mega banks that you pay your money to and
[51:30.600 --> 51:34.760]  These same groups then fund organizations to demonize you and say it doesn't exist
[51:34.760 --> 51:38.600]  They appear disdain for you acting like these documents don't exist
[51:38.600 --> 51:43.960]  But then they'll have the controlled right wing go. Yeah, that's you know, that's you know, that's you know, that's you know
[51:43.960 --> 51:47.960]  That you in trying to take over. We're gonna fight them our government
[51:48.520 --> 51:51.480]  Run by the Federal Reserve created the UN
[51:51.880 --> 51:58.120]  It's creating the law the sea treaty in agenda 21 to say it's another group and then criminally
[51:58.520 --> 52:04.280]  Sign our authority and our law over to it like Obama says I go to the UN now for war
[52:04.760 --> 52:09.720]  Or I go to the UN for agenda 21 or your city goes to the UN for its zoning rules
[52:09.720 --> 52:13.880]  You see and they criminally transfer it over, but it's still illegitimate
[52:14.520 --> 52:19.480]  I mean, it's so obvious that once we see how big the fraud is
[52:20.440 --> 52:23.560]  I remember growing up and reading history books that Hitler quote
[52:24.040 --> 52:27.160]  About the bigger the lie the more people will believe it
[52:27.160 --> 52:31.000]  But he actually went on to explain something communist and how they would do it
[52:31.000 --> 52:34.120]  But he also did the big lie. He was saying yes the bigger the lie
[52:34.120 --> 52:40.920]  It's so big that everybody buys into it, and then they don't want to admit. They've been conned and the whole power structure starts defending it
[52:40.920 --> 52:45.560]  And that's how these big lies just get pushed and pushed and pushed whether it's the private fellow
[52:46.360 --> 52:53.560]  Slavery fluoride in the water deadly vaccines. It's such a big lie and it gets institutionalized that nobody wants to admit
[52:53.560 --> 52:59.000]  They've been conned we have to get to the point of like look I may have been conned before but I'm gonna get informed
[52:59.240 --> 53:01.240]  I'm gonna get focused. I'm gonna get angry
[53:01.240 --> 53:06.200]  And I'm gonna stand up against this because things get too horrible if you don't
[53:07.320 --> 53:09.320]  And I'm trying to find the article here
[53:10.600 --> 53:16.920]  Out of out of Canada here it is now talk about groveling and I want to try to get this guy on I'm sure it's a nice fellow
[53:18.840 --> 53:22.840]  But this is out of the record it's out of Quebec Canada, but the same stuff happens here
[53:22.840 --> 53:28.600]  You've seen it in the news, you know, we're seven year old arrested eight year old arrested for plastic knife to spread butter
[53:28.600 --> 53:36.440]  Or valovictorian loser's diploma last day of school because had box of plastic and knives and forks
[53:37.000 --> 53:42.440]  In the front of her car. We've all seen those are child draw stick figure with gun arrested
[53:43.160 --> 53:45.160]  okay, and
[53:45.240 --> 53:47.240]  You can read this article
[53:47.320 --> 53:52.360]  At the record I've shot a video about it. It's linked up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com as well
[53:52.360 --> 53:58.680]  But listen to this man shocked by arrest after daughter draws picture of gun at school a
[53:59.880 --> 54:04.280]  Kitchener father is upset that the police arrested him and his children's school Wednesday
[54:04.600 --> 54:11.240]  Halled him down to the station and strip searched him all because his four-year-old daughter drew an image of a gun at school
[54:12.120 --> 54:15.960]  Now remember they go on in this article and say we'll do it again. This is reasonable
[54:16.680 --> 54:20.680]  And what did she say they said why'd you draw a gun? My daddy kills monsters with it
[54:20.680 --> 54:24.600]  And by the way, I checked the laws that guns not even illegal there
[54:25.960 --> 54:29.480]  But they said he might be planning something with it since she was drawing images
[54:29.640 --> 54:32.120]  So they came and arrested him and the cps took his kids
[54:32.200 --> 54:37.240]  Turns out he's a counselor in the community in the school and even tried to hire him before to be a counselor there
[54:38.040 --> 54:39.320]  Okay
[54:39.320 --> 54:43.000]  And this goes on here as well. This is what we don't want to become
[54:43.720 --> 54:48.360]  By the way, the canadiens are mad about this. They're waking up. I was in shock. This is completely insane
[54:48.360 --> 54:51.960]  My daughter drew a gun on school a piece of paper at the school
[54:52.440 --> 54:56.600]  Now they have a new article out saying hysteria caused by plastic gun
[54:56.600 --> 54:58.600]  It was a toy gun at the house that she'd seen
[54:59.000 --> 55:04.280]  No, the hysteria was caused by the control freak nanny state who doesn't care about the violence on tv
[55:04.520 --> 55:10.520]  Or the arm to the teeth government but sees the image of a slave even drawing a gun and they go
[55:11.320 --> 55:13.320]  Slave with a gun
[55:13.320 --> 55:17.320]  That's what they're scared of
[55:20.520 --> 55:25.240]  I mean, it'd be like in Rome 2,000 years ago. He walked out in the slave pin. One of them had a sword
[55:26.520 --> 55:27.960]  It's the same thing
[55:27.960 --> 55:34.680]  Or it'd be like in the south or something 200 years ago. They walked out, you know, they're in the slave quarters and got weapons upraising
[55:35.720 --> 55:37.720]  I mean, that's what this is really all about
[55:37.720 --> 55:43.800]  The the the the British government was treating it subjects like slaves 1776. They came to confiscate the guns
[55:43.960 --> 55:49.160]  You can't have slave rabble with weapons. This is what our country was founded over
[55:50.040 --> 55:51.800]  continuing
[55:51.800 --> 55:59.160]  The school principal police and child welfare officials not servants. They're officials. You're an idiot slave citizen
[55:59.480 --> 56:01.480]  That pays their salary
[56:01.480 --> 56:08.760]  However, listen the school principal police and child welfare officials who in the u.s. Are five times more likely to abuse you than the other group
[56:08.760 --> 56:13.480]  But ignore that's fine. I'll be building all stand by their actions. Oh, they're proud of it
[56:14.200 --> 56:16.200]  They said they had to investigate
[56:16.200 --> 56:18.840]  Determined whether there was a gun a gun
[56:20.200 --> 56:23.880]  In his house that children had access to because if they'd seen one
[56:24.360 --> 56:28.360]  My dad had a newspaper editor. He went to college where I've known for many years. Nice guy
[56:28.360 --> 56:32.040]  He works up in Dallas. I said his name anybody in Dallas know who he is
[56:32.680 --> 56:34.280]  And I and this is back when I was in college
[56:34.280 --> 56:38.680]  I they have a gun safe and I was going deer hunting and shooting and my guns were at my parents house
[56:38.680 --> 56:40.680]  And I just came walking through the house
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.120]  out
[56:42.120 --> 56:45.400]  And they were in the the dining room and he barely saw it and I heard
[56:47.640 --> 56:50.120]  And I was like and and and he's like
[56:51.560 --> 56:53.560]  And my dad's like it's okay. It's okay
[56:53.560 --> 56:59.880]  It's like a money python skit or like the fish called wonder where the guy eats the fish the guy stutters
[57:00.280 --> 57:03.480]  And I walked in and I said look I'm going to shoot and range. It's unloaded. He's like
[57:06.360 --> 57:08.200]  And I was like no listen, it's
[57:08.200 --> 57:12.280]  It's not that big of a deal. You want to hold it get over your fear. Look at it both, you know, it's unloaded
[57:13.400 --> 57:16.680]  And I learned he pretty much freaked out and you know had to leave
[57:17.560 --> 57:21.400]  But he sees a cop with the gun. He's like, oh the government with the gun properly
[57:21.400 --> 57:28.040]  So anyways the whole article the whole article just goes on and on and I think about these domesticated people
[57:28.440 --> 57:32.440]  You know, they love to send their wives and daughters out without guns rape killed. They love it
[57:32.440 --> 57:34.440]  It's like a sacrament of idiocy
[57:34.840 --> 57:39.720]  We'll tell you more about this coming up and a ton of other news and your calls and guests in here

[1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:07.960]  From his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[1:00:07.960 --> 1:00:14.840]  It's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:18.760]  See having having all these people staring at me here
[1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:23.640]  It kind of makes me want to blush so i feel like i have to self deprecate with some joking around a little bit here
[1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:28.520]  Uh after this break i am going to start getting some people in here to talk with us
[1:00:28.840 --> 1:00:33.080]  In fact, why don't you come in next segment doc holiday and talk about the royalty
[1:00:33.080 --> 1:00:39.080]  The royalty that's here in town and and shutting down all the highways for the nda
[1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:44.520]  I mean it's like a wide open highway and there's all these cops acting like god has arrived
[1:00:45.240 --> 1:00:47.320]  Again, you have to protect them from the rabble
[1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:49.880]  But the rabble who paid for it
[1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:56.040]  So coming up about five minutes. We're going to cover it. So i'm just just be on standby there in your public green room
[1:00:56.840 --> 1:01:01.320]  It's almost like when the politicians have their families standing behind them. I have a little radio station behind me
[1:01:01.320 --> 1:01:07.560]  I'm getting back to this article that reads like satire, but it's not it's it's it's it's knitting about oh
[1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:15.560]  They stand by it a strip searching him government taking his children because their daughter drew a gun and said that daddy kills monsters
[1:01:15.560 --> 1:01:19.080]  And we had to make sure there was a gun. Why did they have access?
[1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:23.160]  They went to his house without a warrant don't need does anymore
[1:01:24.440 --> 1:01:28.600]  From a public safety point of view any child drawing a picture of a gun
[1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:31.640]  And from now on just say guns guns
[1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:37.320]  I'm sorry. I've overdone that and say it's fun to do though and saying there's guns in the home
[1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:39.640]  Would warrant some further conversation
[1:01:40.280 --> 1:01:45.400]  With the parents and child said allison scott executive director of family and children services
[1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:48.120]  Yes, it would it would warrant a talk
[1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:56.200]  Grabbing you at the school in front of everyone keeping you for today strip searching you taking your children. That's what we call talking to you
[1:01:56.200 --> 1:01:58.200]  We're the guys reasonable
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:05.480]  Our handbooks and training for cps say we're going to break up the family and it's a disease and we're a eugenics cult
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:10.600]  Shut up in 1915 in north america across the continent to break up the family
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:15.800]  But it's just we're going to talk to you. It's not a big deal. We're just here to train your kids for prison
[1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:18.840]  We have the biggest prison population in north america as well
[1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:25.320]  So continuing waterloo regional police in sep kevin faller
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:33.160]  Said there was a complaint from forest hills public school that a firearm was in a residence and children had access to it
[1:02:33.160 --> 1:02:35.160]  See the gun's not illegal
[1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:40.760]  But they said the children had access a child draws a gun that they could see on tv anywhere
[1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:48.680]  You're guilty without a court and you don't have a warrant and you get strip search and your kids get taken
[1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:54.040]  I mean how many of us drew images of guns as children in school? I know I did
[1:02:55.560 --> 1:02:57.560]  How many people
[1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:00.520]  I'm seeing a lot of hands raised here a lot
[1:03:01.400 --> 1:03:03.400]  But after I look at the lights, I can't see anymore
[1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:06.200]  Big big spots there
[1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:08.200]  trying to read here
[1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:11.240]  So so there there you have it waterloo regional police
[1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:18.680]  Inspector I guess nsp is inspector inspector inspecting the enemy and the canadian people
[1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:26.760]  Said there was a complaint from forest hill public school government training camp that a firearm was in a residence and children had access to it
[1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:32.600]  We had every concern based on this information that the children were in danger
[1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:38.600]  Their concern wasn't based on the drawing alone. No, it gets worse
[1:03:39.240 --> 1:03:45.400]  The child who made the drawing also made comments about it that raised more flags
[1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:48.120]  Wait daddy shoots monsters
[1:03:49.320 --> 1:03:51.960]  He said he went to the school Wednesday afternoon to pick up the three children
[1:03:52.680 --> 1:03:56.680]  But see they don't tell you what the flag was because they want to just let it linger like it was really bad
[1:03:56.760 --> 1:03:58.760]  They don't tell you until later
[1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:00.920]  It's all written for propaganda purposes
[1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:05.800]  No, this is how they operate. This is a propagandist writing this. He said he went to the school Wednesday
[1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:08.360]  Afternoon to pick up the three children. He was
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:13.800]  Summoned by the government training camp. I mean to the principal's office were three police officers
[1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:19.720]  You mean globalist enforcement family destructive new eluder servant minions were let me go back to that. I was translating it
[1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:22.520]  He said he went to the government training camp. I'm sorry
[1:04:22.600 --> 1:04:26.360]  He said he went to the school Wednesday afternoon to pick up his three children
[1:04:26.360 --> 1:04:30.360]  And he was summoned to the principal's office where three police officers were waiting
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:34.200]  They said he was being charged with possession of a firearm
[1:04:35.320 --> 1:04:37.960]  He was escorted from the school and put in the back of the cruiser
[1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:40.040]  Then it goes on the strip search
[1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:45.960]  And what was the next flag that they asked the young girl and she said daddy shoots monsters with it
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:49.560]  Don't worry about monsters. I have the toy gun. Oh good daddy
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:55.000]  Will be right folks. I play gun with my kids all the time, you know running around playing

[1:07:46.760 --> 1:07:48.280]  You were on my show a couple days ago
[1:07:48.280 --> 1:07:52.920]  And you were telling me about how just in the lead-up to the all-star game and lord obama landing when he's not
[1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:57.080]  Shipping guns in mexico to blame the second member narcotics back in the united states or bombing countries on congressional approval
[1:07:57.320 --> 1:08:02.920]  You were telling me that our lord ship who goes to the u.n. To launch wars because he says it's for their credibility
[1:08:03.080 --> 1:08:07.560]  Right, mr. Treason who sat at the head of the u.n. Security council violating article one section nine
[1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:09.480]  I don't just use treason lightly
[1:08:09.480 --> 1:08:14.920]  He you told me they shut down highways roads motorcades part of downtown total lavishman
[1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:19.080]  taxpayer funded shutting down local businesses god has arrived
[1:08:19.080 --> 1:08:25.400]  Uh, and I've actually seen this while I'm here. I shot a youtube driving in of just you know
[1:08:26.120 --> 1:08:29.720]  Turbuses with police escorts and just everything lavishman
[1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:35.240]  Tell us tell us what's going on here. Well, you know, I was funny because I I would tell us I say look
[1:08:35.560 --> 1:08:39.800]  You don't even realize how strange it's become. It became a racially
[1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:43.800]  divisive issue. Oh, yeah, because he's running ads saying
[1:08:43.800 --> 1:08:51.000]  Uh, acquitting himself with martin wither king when he signed the ndaa to abolish the bullet rights and and and and saying african-americans for obama
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:54.360]  Yeah, right and those are running here and he's in the oval office. It's it
[1:08:54.760 --> 1:09:00.200]  It's a campaign ad saying churches vote for me too, right and so i'm gonna erupt this morning. No, no, no, it's okay
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:04.040]  You can interrupt me. I'm gonna do it again. I'm used to it all the time my listeners are gonna get more of it
[1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:07.800]  I'm sorry. It's okay. Tell him to interrupt me. It's all right. It's a joke go ahead
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:12.440]  No, no what I said was I said you knew be surprised you're coming here to Orlando
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:18.200]  And I know the nba all-star game is here, but obama came in and he flew in with an agenda
[1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:24.680]  And what no they and I it was a big agenda then they started running that ad and we emailed you the ad
[1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:29.400]  He's thinking for himself. No government has an agenda. That's a conspiracy. It was horrible
[1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:35.320]  And then the media started showing it was horrible. They would go to ethnic americans
[1:09:35.400 --> 1:09:41.320]  God bless you no matter what you are and saying, what do you think they're trying to create division in the name of creating division?
[1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:44.920]  Yeah, they created the vision in the media and then everyone said yeah
[1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:48.200]  NBA all-star weekend is us obama's here
[1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:53.320]  I don't know who he's going to relate to to be totally honest my point is that's great for him to be reaching out to whatever
[1:09:53.400 --> 1:09:58.040]  Ethic grip that's fine. My issue is that it's like i'm going to give you a free house
[1:09:58.360 --> 1:10:00.360]  He lied to everybody. He's a puppet
[1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:03.800]  There's a one bush. There's a woman in Tampa right now
[1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:09.960]  Who still is waiting for her free house and her mortgage to be paid in 2008?
[1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:14.200]  She said can i have a can i get my house paid for because i'm about to get thrown out and he's like
[1:10:14.200 --> 1:10:19.400]  Yeah, i'll take care of it. Who would say over and over again? Oh, thank you. Mr. President remember that guy that was in florida
[1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:23.960]  He goes i want to i want to my car paid for obama goes you'll get it you'll get it
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:30.040]  And that poor woman was like oh lordy lordy's paying my mortgage and i want somebody go down and tell her
[1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:34.360]  He's lying by the way, they do have those mortgage renegotiation deals
[1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:39.480]  But it doesn't even really help you i've looked at him and had the experts on and when you sign that agreement you wave all your rights
[1:10:39.480 --> 1:10:45.320]  Well, they closed down the roads here in orlando. They built lanes for obama's vip
[1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:50.200]  Obama came in to get a traffic is horrible and people tell me it's not normally like that
[1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:53.240]  Oh, no, it's not that bad and you saw what i was telling you
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:59.080]  Well, first i run into this giant traffic jam and they've got cops i didn't get that parkers i pulled my phone out after
[1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:03.800]  They had cops all over the side of the highways partially blocking so we're almost late getting here
[1:11:03.800 --> 1:11:07.560]  You know, we only got here like 45 minutes before it said like an hour and a half right all the stuff we had to do
[1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:09.400]  And i'm like what is this?
[1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:13.320]  And and it's just like the highways shut down and there's these cops and then it's these royal buses
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:17.560]  They were like blocking the road for them to enter the royal road you can't drive
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:23.000]  Anywhere around here because the elitists are here now. That's okay. It's an all-star game
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:30.200]  Whatever but it became a racial issue because in the Daytona 500 which is being run right now over in
[1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:36.280]  You know in Daytona obviously and then you have the nba all-star game and obama came in and favored the all-star game
[1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:43.560]  Would not go to the Daytona 500 and made it a huge issue and then they started running the ad that we sent you
[1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:46.920]  They ran the ad when they brought up slavery
[1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:51.640]  They brought up all kind of stuff mark the point is the point is it my big issue is
[1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:56.040]  Remember bush started getting booed at baseball games and stuff and started hiding so obama
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:11:59.320]  I don't blame him not going to the nascar deal just because that you know crowd
[1:11:59.480 --> 1:12:03.160]  I mean good folks bad folks like any other crowd who knows what they do
[1:12:03.160 --> 1:12:06.920]  So I understand now that obama's so unpopular kind of like bush has got to hide out
[1:12:07.160 --> 1:12:10.440]  But when you sent me the video what I went crazy on and I meant to play it today
[1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:12.520]  I played it a few days ago as everybody knows
[1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:16.120]  And I think the title of it is like a million and a half views on youtube
[1:12:16.280 --> 1:12:19.320]  It's airing on tv here is something like obama announces
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:26.040]  African americans for obama 2012 african americans for obama, but listen in it in it not whites
[1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:32.920]  Not anybody only african americans for obama, but my issue is he says in the church is set up vote teams
[1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:36.280]  Your churches must vote for me now. Wait a minute. They tell people don't have
[1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:39.640]  Political stuff in your church or organize it as a political group
[1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:41.640]  Which you actually have the rights to in the first amendment
[1:12:41.720 --> 1:12:44.920]  But they lie and tell conservative or libertarian churches you can't do that
[1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:48.920]  But here's obama saying you use the churches to get people elected and no
[1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:53.240]  Media coverage of this saying get your church to get out the ballot for me
[1:12:53.800 --> 1:13:00.120]  That video was run on the big scoreboard inside the amway arena during an nba game
[1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:05.480]  And how is that supposed to make people feel how does that make the white guy feel versus
[1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:11.800]  Whatever that he is trying to appeal to I mean, let's face it. I'm blacker than obama
[1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:17.720]  You're blacker than obama and you know what don't play the race card unless you can back it up
[1:13:17.960 --> 1:13:21.720]  So he played the race card and I thought to myself and that's why we sent it to you
[1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:23.960]  It's running all over tv
[1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:29.400]  So he happens to you know land and he wants to do the nba thing and he wants to hang out with people that he has
[1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:34.840]  No idea what their names are and all he did was cause divisiveness because the media
[1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:37.160]  Well, here's my issue suddenly take that
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:41.000]  I'm sick of paying for formula one tracks and billion dollars for stadiums
[1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:47.560]  And i'm sick of bush obama anybody with like 50 60, you know cavalcade deal shutting down roads
[1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:51.800]  I'm tired of it period. I mean, you know, they need to act like public servants and not god
[1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:59.800]  That's what i'm tired of but you know what what it was is that they deliberately shut down part of interstate four only for obama's
[1:13:59.960 --> 1:14:03.000]  VIPs and it caused a lot of problems
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:08.440]  Yeah, so now it's not just the president that shuts down highways. It's the vips. Well, it's the wrappers
[1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:11.080]  It's these guys that get arrested. They got the gold teeth
[1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:12.840]  They've got all kinds of problems
[1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:17.080]  You got all kinds of people here with drug raps and we're supposed to be emulating these people
[1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:22.680]  And we think honestly that people are looking at it the wrong way by the way
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:27.080]  They put a big wall up around the amway arena
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:35.320]  So the local businesses could not do a lick of business because the vips didn't want to be bothered
[1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:41.000]  With dealing with local people. Hello. Why is the NBA all starting here? Listen? Why is it here?
[1:14:41.080 --> 1:14:45.400]  This shows the elitism and they get the mayor's everybody like formula one in austin
[1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:47.400]  and taxpayers pay for it
[1:14:48.120 --> 1:14:49.640]  and then
[1:14:49.640 --> 1:14:53.080]  We're all going to be basically blocked off from it and it's going to screw up the city
[1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:56.040]  But because the mayor gets invited what I love is because
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:00.200]  This political system a lot of times people sell out not even for money
[1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:02.600]  They sell out just to be invited to the party
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:06.200]  You couldn't pay me to go to a formula one. You like it fine
[1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:09.560]  You couldn't pay me to go to an NBA game and I like basketball
[1:15:09.560 --> 1:15:16.600]  It's just going there and the checkpoints and the people and all of it. I mean, it's just ridiculous and it's the way they build it up
[1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:18.920]  Like it's the end all be all
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:23.480]  Meanwhile, you're a weirdo if you care about freedom. You know, I told folks about the bill of rights and constitution
[1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:28.040]  Sometimes they're like, man, that's kind of weird. I'm like, well, that's what makes america america
[1:15:28.120 --> 1:15:31.080]  But we paid four hundred million dollars for an arena
[1:15:31.560 --> 1:15:36.760]  Because they said they were going to have an all-star game here that the city finally was going to be able
[1:15:36.760 --> 1:15:42.760]  And now they use it to shut down dock holiday big a 10 here in Orlando. You're awesome folks. We're going out to break

[1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:01.640]  Little over a year ago
[1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:07.240]  I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving

[1:19:05.320 --> 1:19:09.320]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[1:19:09.560 --> 1:19:15.000]  Our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:19.880]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:28.360]  Number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:35.000]  Number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[1:19:35.080 --> 1:19:40.360]  Onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:19:40.360 --> 1:19:45.480]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[1:20:04.200 --> 1:20:09.640]  You're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[1:20:17.960 --> 1:20:21.800]  We were discussing the national security state by the way, we're back live
[1:20:22.440 --> 1:20:25.160]  Big 8 10 events speaking to a capacity crowd
[1:20:25.800 --> 1:20:27.800]  Here at the Orlando Highlight Center
[1:20:28.920 --> 1:20:32.840]  What is the big 8 10 a.m. Dot com? I forget the url
[1:20:32.840 --> 1:20:34.840]  What's the great radio stations url?
[1:20:36.120 --> 1:20:40.120]  Big 8 10 a.m. Dot com, baby. You folks are awesome
[1:20:42.360 --> 1:20:44.360]  Yeah
[1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:48.520]  I'm gonna give him a speech and premiering a 40 minute documentary coming up here
[1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:52.760]  And they said hey, why don't you do your show from their lives? So we are doing it here
[1:20:53.560 --> 1:20:56.760]  And I don't know the weekend sunday show four to six p.m. Central
[1:20:56.760 --> 1:21:02.280]  It has about 67 stations their show picking it up weekday show a little over a hundred now and we're on xm
[1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:09.400]  For over two years now and reaching. We had the internet and everything else together in the podcast and the youtube's every week 15 million people
[1:21:10.200 --> 1:21:16.280]  Again a testament to the underdog when you've got the truth when you've got the information and when you're willing to resist tyranny
[1:21:16.680 --> 1:21:18.680]  And we'll be talking about solutions and victories
[1:21:18.680 --> 1:21:24.840]  We've had in my speech coming up tonight before I get into a big globalist power grab that ties into agenda 21
[1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:29.960]  We start to get a lot of attention because uh cities all over the country are fighting against un takeover
[1:21:29.960 --> 1:21:31.960]  Swartz and anger whenever he
[1:21:32.680 --> 1:21:39.480]  Was at the Copenhagen event two years ago or so and they were calling for global governance and global taxes out there with al gore
[1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:42.200]  In this global treaty
[1:21:42.120 --> 1:21:45.640]  When it failed to get the countries to sign on and waive their sovereignty
[1:21:46.520 --> 1:21:49.560]  Uh failed. Yeah, see we move this mic and that's what's doing that
[1:21:50.600 --> 1:21:53.880]  Um as I was saying whenever that started
[1:21:53.880 --> 1:22:01.640]  Swartz today or he looked us up in us today. He said what we're going to do now is we're going to go to the county cities of states
[1:22:02.120 --> 1:22:04.120]  And that is the agenda 21
[1:22:04.200 --> 1:22:09.320]  And we will implement the carbon tax and the sustainable development through your local community
[1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:13.320]  In other words, we'll engage in treason and try to take over your sovereignty from within
[1:22:13.640 --> 1:22:16.280]  You should have his big fat steroid head locked up
[1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:22.600]  Now just like obama should be locked up for saying the un gives him the authority to blow up countries and not congress
[1:22:22.600 --> 1:22:26.680]  This is the incredible scuffs. I'm going to get into some of that agenda 21, but I wanted
[1:22:27.400 --> 1:22:34.200]  To talk to matt from tampa. He came down here with us some folks from we are change tampa and they're in panellas counting
[1:22:34.520 --> 1:22:40.440]  Yeah, that's about a million people right at a million people you heard last year. They pulled the so-called fluoride
[1:22:40.440 --> 1:22:42.920]  It's really even more deadly than that out of the water
[1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:49.720]  And they did it with the scientific facts that are out there sevenfold increase in cancer hundreds of chemicals in the so-called fluoride
[1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:56.120]  A toxic waste byproduct grignard reagents and they got it removed and it's happening all over the world
[1:22:56.680 --> 1:22:59.640]  When you come forward with the information and keep doing it year after year
[1:22:59.800 --> 1:23:04.280]  So so so so tell folks what it is why you got involved and what you and your group did
[1:23:05.480 --> 1:23:10.760]  Go ahead. Well, uh, basically we have to thank our panellas county commissioner norm roach
[1:23:11.320 --> 1:23:13.960]  And uh, he was the one that actually got the ball rolling for us
[1:23:15.560 --> 1:23:17.720]  He was wanting to do it as a budget cut
[1:23:17.720 --> 1:23:20.280]  He was wanting to do it as a budget cut
[1:23:21.480 --> 1:23:25.400]  I don't know if they can hear me. Yeah, they can hear you. I mean the bigger issue here is
[1:23:25.640 --> 1:23:31.240]  I understand your county commissioners are great guys. Tell us about fluoride. All right. Well, the problem was they don't even use fluoride
[1:23:31.240 --> 1:23:36.120]  They use what's called hydrofluosilic acid and thanks to fluoride free austin
[1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:41.800]  We got a document from mosaic that showed that hydrofluosilic acid was a poison
[1:23:41.880 --> 1:23:45.880]  And it said right on the poison label that we had in hand not to ingest
[1:23:45.880 --> 1:23:49.480]  So we asked them why it is that the poison label says not to ingest it
[1:23:49.480 --> 1:23:52.920]  What they put in your water has a label saying if you breathe any of this you're dead
[1:23:53.080 --> 1:23:58.200]  Yeah, with skull and crossbones. It says right on the label. Did you know your baby fluoride baby water?
[1:23:58.280 --> 1:24:02.360]  Yeah, tell folks what it really is. Uh, well, it's it's a uh, you know
[1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:07.960]  Waste byproduct is hydrofluosilicic acid and that's what they actually put into the water
[1:24:07.960 --> 1:24:14.760]  They the propaganda is the fluoride, but what they're actually putting in it is is uh, you know waste byproduct and stuff
[1:24:14.760 --> 1:24:19.480]  So they came in there with dentists and 88 people and they said, you know that it's for the children
[1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:20.920]  It's for the children
[1:24:20.920 --> 1:24:26.280]  But we showed them the facts and showed them that you know the facts are you know the chemical industry on average gives the
[1:24:26.280 --> 1:24:28.680]  America Dental Association about 20 million a year
[1:24:28.840 --> 1:24:32.520]  Oh, yeah, you know why because then cities like austin pay about a million a year for it
[1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:38.040]  Imagine how much they're making they're making billions off selling you toxic waste. They'd have to pay the store
[1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:42.840]  No, they use us as human filters basically because they can't dump it into the ocean
[1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:47.240]  So the only way they can get rid of it is to use us as human. They don't put your bones. Yeah, exactly
[1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:49.160]  I think
[1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:51.160]  But we did it with a budget cuts
[1:24:51.880 --> 1:24:55.640]  We said uh, why pay for this poison when we our budgets are
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:24:59.240]  Upside down and they're all you know in massive debt. So we got it cut out
[1:24:59.640 --> 1:25:03.400]  Uh, that way. So that's the way for other people to also do it. Uh, bring it to your
[1:25:04.520 --> 1:25:06.520]  Bring it
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:15.160]  Go to your county commissioners and ask them why you're why you're spending $200,000 of your tax dollars on poison to put in the water
[1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:19.720]  And again when that hoax falls when all the hoaxes fall they're going down this shows
[1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:25.880]  We're on the march and you know, what's happening all over the world now, right? Right? Well, I'm glad and I feel healthier already
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:28.120]  They took it out on the first. So
[1:25:28.120 --> 1:25:30.120]  Hey, you're incredible
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:34.680]  But again, it's an example of taking action now. Tell us about your buddy over here. We're gonna bring him in there
[1:25:34.680 --> 1:25:38.280]  He says he says he's got some stuff. He wants to say come on over here. What's his name?
[1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:44.200]  Chris, you know, we work together on uh getting the information to the commission and stuff. So I'll let him
[1:25:44.440 --> 1:25:46.440]  All right, chris jump in here
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:51.960]  Come on in here and just we only got a few minutes, but tell folks your whole view on fluoride and the tide getting turned here
[1:25:52.760 --> 1:25:56.760]  Thank you, alex. So well, thank you for your help in getting this victory
[1:25:57.400 --> 1:26:02.840]  You know, thank me brother. I don't want my kids getting poisoned. I wanted to beat the enemy crush them
[1:26:02.840 --> 1:26:09.320]  And we shall murdering scum. They're poisoning you. They're the enemy. See who they are
[1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:11.960]  subtle mighty
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:14.600]  And we're learning we're seeing what's going on
[1:26:14.680 --> 1:26:19.160]  I mean that we have a commissioner susan latvala who fought us since 2009
[1:26:19.640 --> 1:26:23.640]  And I need to also thank a friend of mine who couldn't be here today named frank hobson
[1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:30.520]  Who's been attending these county commission meetings and uh, she this commissioner told both he and I in a private meeting
[1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:34.600]  That what big phosphate wants big phosphate gets
[1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:41.320]  When I confronted her about this, she tried to sidestep it and tap dance and say why they mine most of that in florida
[1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:47.000]  So they're big here in the phosphate industry. Absolutely. Most of the phosphate comes from mosaic phosphate mining company
[1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:51.320]  Uranium mining as well. That's why there's all uranium and what they put in your water
[1:26:51.480 --> 1:26:53.960]  Oh, what's wrong with real with uranium?
[1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:59.400]  Well, it says right on the water quality analysis that it's industrial discharge and it's from
[1:26:59.400 --> 1:27:03.560]  Uh, they we have alpha beta photon emitters and this is discharge
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:06.200]  You mean radiation?
[1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:11.400]  Absolutely, and it's since I've heard it exposing this in the last decade. They have newscast people go look they go
[1:27:11.640 --> 1:27:16.120]  We don't know why there's radiation in there because the stinking cities are paying to add it
[1:27:17.320 --> 1:27:21.160]  Yep, yeah, and and we have this commissioner latvala
[1:27:21.240 --> 1:27:26.760]  I tell you when she was confronted by this she tried to say that well big what big phosphate wants big phosphate gets
[1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:31.480]  Maybe in other counties, but not our county what they're going to get to revolution and they're going to go to prison
[1:27:31.640 --> 1:27:34.680]  Yes, yeah, yep running scared running scared
[1:27:35.480 --> 1:27:42.600]  But people's children need photon emitters and radon and and and uranium. So are you saying uranium's not good for children's teeth?
[1:27:43.400 --> 1:27:46.520]  Well, I to those I would say they need to have a hair blood and
[1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:53.000]  And uh and skin and hair blood and nail analysis to see what their long-term exposure is to this toxin
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:58.040]  Anybody who's pro fluoride needs to be asked if they have the courage of their convictions
[1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:03.800]  And while they're at it, they should also test those who they were to treat the guys of of medication
[1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:08.280]  It's not force medication. It's force toxification under the guys of medication
[1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:13.480]  And they also have to have their supplementation tested new through nutritional blood analysis
[1:28:13.720 --> 1:28:16.680]  If they believe it ought to be on the rda and that's my next point
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:20.600]  We need to start suing them when scum like the austin city council doesn't remove it
[1:28:20.600 --> 1:28:24.920]  We've had scientists and doctors down there and 90 plus percent of the epa's don't scientists have gone public
[1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:28.520]  So take it out to congress when the when the when the mayor and people laugh at us
[1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:35.400]  It's time for lawsuits. They pay they pay to have tons of toxic chemicals. What's the website for we are change Tampa

[1:33:20.200 --> 1:33:36.840]  I hear the american people and the people of the world getting angry at tyranny and awakening and saying we're not your slaves
[1:33:37.400 --> 1:33:43.800]  And the globalist certainly hear that awakening is a big number since a few years ago said the world is waking up the global elites
[1:33:43.880 --> 1:33:48.680]  And they're in trouble his new book says the biggest challenge they face the awakening of their system
[1:33:48.680 --> 1:33:51.880]  They can't just tell us like we're children, you know go away shut up
[1:33:52.440 --> 1:33:59.720]  The new world order hears you all of you out there listening on amfm you name it and they certainly hear the people who are here in
[1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:03.400]  Orlando as things fill up to over a thousand people
[1:34:04.280 --> 1:34:06.280]  Yeah
[1:34:06.360 --> 1:34:08.360]  Here let them hear you
[1:34:08.360 --> 1:34:12.920]  Man, I love that sound
[1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:19.080]  And I've gotten kind of reclusive except when I occasionally storm the capital there go out and do whatever
[1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:23.720]  But I need to get out more. This is this is fun. I can really feel the energy
[1:34:25.320 --> 1:34:28.280]  It is so good to be here around people that are
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:33.400]  Looking for freedom looking for liberty and realize the world's going in the wrong direction
[1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:40.040]  Listen, the world's always going in the wrong direction. It's also going in the right direction always. There's a lot of complex things happening in our world
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:44.840]  And it's always up to good people versus bad people who is going to
[1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:52.040]  Direct the direction of society and we're simply here saying hey, we've let you little central banker experts run things long enough
[1:34:52.600 --> 1:34:57.640]  And now you're not just going to be able to pat us on the head and have us shut up
[1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:00.200]  We're awake. We're sleeping
[1:35:00.200 --> 1:35:04.520]  And have us shut up. We're awake. We're staring and we're
[1:35:06.120 --> 1:35:14.200]  Gathering data and we're getting more information and we're reaching out to others and we are coming for the new world order
[1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:16.600]  period
[1:35:20.280 --> 1:35:22.280]  You know, I would take calls today, but
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:24.600]  All the radio
[1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:30.200]  Audience, you know is hearing is me talking and people cheering and then because it would feed back
[1:35:30.280 --> 1:35:33.400]  We're not running the feed of the audio out to this big auditorium
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:36.200]  So that you would not be able to hear the callers
[1:35:37.240 --> 1:35:39.240]  and as a triple whammy
[1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:43.560]  We have a special phone number for the sunday show and I haven't even memorized that
[1:35:44.440 --> 1:35:47.800]  The last six years giving it out. I guess because they changed it a few months ago. That's probably why
[1:35:48.280 --> 1:35:51.720]  But I probably should write that number down and give it out and take a few calls
[1:35:51.720 --> 1:35:55.560]  And I know there was probably a few other people I might want to get on air. They want to come on with us
[1:35:56.280 --> 1:35:57.160]  but
[1:35:57.160 --> 1:35:59.640]  I'd actually have to go over there and talk to some of the other talk show hosts during the break
[1:35:59.720 --> 1:36:04.920]  It's only talked to a few people before I went live here on air and I've got all this other news here in front of me
[1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:11.080]  We've got a comical video. I did french bulldogs caught working for al cia
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:18.680]  And trust no one but our loving government is the sub headline of that video also a biometric
[1:36:18.680 --> 1:36:20.680]  Biocratic
[1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:26.440]  Feeding frenzy economists and biologists weigh in this is the point. I want to raise right now
[1:36:26.520 --> 1:36:28.920]  I saw some really incredible news friday and
[1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:34.600]  Forgot to cover it for whatever reason because I've covered it so much in the past. It's now come to fruition
[1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:40.040]  But I've covered it so much in the past that even though now it's a big news story
[1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:42.200]  I didn't cover it but I want to cover it right now
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:47.560]  And that's something I'm going to talk about in my speech more tonight is real threats facing humanity
[1:36:47.560 --> 1:36:51.560]  We defeat the new world order by realizing just how crazy and out of control they are
[1:36:51.880 --> 1:36:58.680]  It's not just that they're dictatorial people. They also aren't really in control. They're able to blow stuff up takeover dominate
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:04.760]  But they're not really in control of everything. They're trying to get in control of everything, but they're not even in control of themselves
[1:37:05.880 --> 1:37:07.880]  And the u.s. Government has decided
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:14.920]  With major u.s. Universities to go ahead and start publishing all of the weaponized bird flu
[1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:17.640]  Weaponized airborne Ebola
[1:37:18.680 --> 1:37:24.520]  Weaponized you name it all of the hundreds of different variants of flu Ebola
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:30.520]  All sorts of other nasty nasties. They're going to start publishing how they made it
[1:37:31.400 --> 1:37:33.400]  This is all in defense, of course
[1:37:34.200 --> 1:37:39.880]  Hundreds and hundreds of level four bio weapons facilities under the bio shield program
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:45.560]  But but it's under defense kind of like bombing Libya is defense or not even defense. It's peace
[1:37:46.120 --> 1:37:52.120]  It's better than defense. It's not even defending yourself. It's not even violence drop a 2000 pound bomb on an apartment building
[1:37:52.760 --> 1:37:56.600]  So it's not war. It's it's it's it's defense research
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:01.160]  To create quote thousands of gallons of liquid death
[1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:06.520]  That was the baltimore sun many years ago when they first launched this latest phase in 2002
[1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:13.240]  The latest in them. They launched another one last year to build more of these and they put level four bio weapons labs
[1:38:13.560 --> 1:38:16.520]  In level two facilities where you just wear a mask and do a swipe card
[1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:21.000]  And they're on the coastlines like galveston, texas. I've talked a lot about that. But now
[1:38:21.640 --> 1:38:23.640]  It was like six seven years ago
[1:38:23.640 --> 1:38:24.600]  us
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:26.600]  scientists and australian scientists
[1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:31.960]  Separately released their mouse pox finding and for just a few hundred thousand dollars
[1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:37.880]  Uh any lab that could replicate this for humans or any other mammal they wish and it kills
[1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:43.320]  98 to 99 of the mammals that you tailor it for so you release this
[1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:49.720]  It kills over 90 percent. That's nine out of ten people on your block. Deader than a doornail
[1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:52.280]  Go to the police station
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:54.600]  That's 90 of the cops are more dead
[1:38:55.480 --> 1:38:59.560]  Go to an auto parts store 90 percent of the workers dead go to your church 90 percent of them dead
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:02.120]  You got ten children nine of them are dead
[1:39:03.640 --> 1:39:09.160]  And they just got all these in level two facilities everywhere. And but that's not enough they're going to release
[1:39:10.680 --> 1:39:14.920]  Because they had a debate about this whatever was five six years ago seven years ago about the mouse pox
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.720]  You're gonna look it up. Well now they're having a debate about weaponized airborne bird flu
[1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:24.200]  Oh, we we're always hyping how it's going to get you and the government dug up the
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:30.680]  uh swine flu that killed 30 40 50 million they debate how many had killed and they and they've spliced all those together and
[1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:36.040]  Oh, don't worry. This bird flu is only killing 80 something percent of the people that comes in you know contact from their projections
[1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:42.040]  Uh and and and the airborne Ebola 90 something wasn't 92 they estimate they got that and they got weaponized
[1:39:42.600 --> 1:39:48.360]  Limes disease and weaponized rabies and weapons just everything just your tax money building it
[1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:53.720]  And they they they declassified in 2000 the Marine Corps freaked out and demanded to be reclassified
[1:39:53.960 --> 1:39:58.280]  Marine Corps studies on helicopters delivering different sprays over us populations
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:04.200]  And and of course now they have the drones to do that even the military knew what was in the canisters on the helicopters or drones
[1:40:04.520 --> 1:40:06.920]  Now it doesn't matter because they'll just have the drones do it
[1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:12.920]  And you know, this is the type of stuff i'm concerned about not somebody who might blow up an airplane
[1:40:13.400 --> 1:40:16.600]  You know every five years. Okay, it's scary. It's in movies
[1:40:16.600 --> 1:40:19.960]  They teach me to be scared of it. No, i'm scared of stuff that
[1:40:20.520 --> 1:40:27.000]  Saw an article a few years ago was at washington post where they admitted a weaponized bird flu of this type is estimated to kill
[1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:32.920]  Between they don't know how how bad it would get 500 and 3 billion people. I don't know
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:39.800]  Excuse me 500 million or 3 billion people. I mean 500 million sounds pretty bad, but you see
[1:40:40.840 --> 1:40:44.600]  Is there a group who has been caught in the past?
[1:40:44.600 --> 1:40:51.560]  Who we might worry about releasing something like this. Yes, the global elite that we have running things
[1:40:52.600 --> 1:40:54.600]  Are a group of people
[1:40:55.560 --> 1:41:01.800]  Who have been caught over and over again saying they want to reduce world population saying that they want to
[1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:06.280]  Do this and then reemerge from their bunkers with some heavenly new future world
[1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:11.720]  Without the general ugly public as they call us and they're they're putting big seed vaults underground
[1:41:11.720 --> 1:41:15.720]  They're a big big dna vaults of every animal species underground on record
[1:41:16.680 --> 1:41:20.760]  I talked about it 10 years ago and you know be called a crazy. Could now it's just mainstream ish
[1:41:21.080 --> 1:41:26.920]  So they're obviously getting ready and considering releasing this so I can joke around I can make jokes
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:30.120]  I can see let's get ready to rumble a lot of that is gallows humor
[1:41:31.400 --> 1:41:33.720]  I'm sorry. This is the reality, but it's a fact
[1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:39.080]  And they're clearly proliferating the ingredients and and and the recipes for this
[1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:43.320]  So that when it gets leaked out they can blame it on research scientists or whatever
[1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:47.480]  For the official histories after our population is reduced
[1:41:47.960 --> 1:41:51.240]  And I have to tell you there is a uh strong chance
[1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:55.320]  I can't put a number on it, but it is strongly being considered and pre
[1:41:55.880 --> 1:42:03.640]  Programmed and pre tested and beta tested and rolled out and the public's being conditioned for a post human world a post
[1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:08.760]  Civilization world we're being told how beautiful and wonderful it'll be on discovery channel and history channel
[1:42:08.760 --> 1:42:10.920]  And at grocery stores I go to for two years
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:17.480]  There's little in caps about the world after humans and magazines and dvds and books on tape and and oh
[1:42:17.560 --> 1:42:19.640]  It's going to be so cool. We're all dead
[1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:24.440]  So we're just being taught how wonderful it is and they're building bunkers and building seed vaults and
[1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:30.920]  The elite are all racing to island redoubts with bunkers. I don't know if they're planning to release it
[1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:37.400]  Uh, you know they talk about how they may dick chaney writes about race specific bio weapons in the september 20th
[1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:40.600]  2000 PNAC documents, but I think this is a bigger issue
[1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:45.960]  Uh than giving up all our rights because al-qaeda is so scary. We'll be right back for more lando. Stay with us

[1:44:00.360 --> 1:44:01.880]  A little over a year ago
[1:44:01.880 --> 1:44:07.400]  I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving
[1:44:07.560 --> 1:44:13.720]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states
[1:44:13.800 --> 1:44:18.920]  And across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[1:44:18.920 --> 1:44:25.240]  Minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy
[1:44:25.400 --> 1:44:31.480]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered young jevity

[1:45:20.440 --> 1:45:28.600]  Number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[1:45:28.760 --> 1:45:35.320]  Number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:32.440]  seven to eight free radical orlando dot coms the website and uh, i'm
[1:48:32.920 --> 1:48:38.520]  I'm more of an activist. I consider myself an activist who just happens to have a radio show at the moment
[1:48:38.520 --> 1:48:43.880]  Uh, because I just found this radio show because I found myself getting arrested too much doing
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:48.040]  Other types of activism. I got upset with the police brutality happening orlando
[1:48:48.280 --> 1:48:51.720]  So I founded a group called the orlando cop watch orlando cop watch dot com
[1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:57.560]  Where we'd go out film police brutality during one such incident. I was arrested and uh, they threw me in a cage for a while
[1:48:57.640 --> 1:49:00.600]  So I gave that up. I did a lot of jury outreach
[1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:06.920]  Letting people know they had the right to people on a jury have the right to vote people not guilty if they disagree with the law
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:11.880]  And uh, some of my good friends got thrown in the cage for 150 days for doing that kind of outreach
[1:49:12.200 --> 1:49:16.360]  So I decided I was having a family and everything was happening. I need to change directions
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:24.200]  So I got the radio show free radical radio and we talk about liberty issues local local liberty issues the criminality and stupidity of government
[1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:29.320]  And uh, some of my show prep comes right from your website info wars dot com. Well, I'll tell you what's beautiful
[1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:35.320]  I'll tell you what's beautiful about what you're doing is you having your first amendment violated
[1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:37.560]  And so you took action you upped
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:43.320]  Your activism by getting on the air and that's what everybody should do and that's what the globalists can't stand
[1:49:43.560 --> 1:49:46.600]  If everybody starts a youtube channel or gets a local radio show
[1:49:46.840 --> 1:49:50.520]  It's not as hard as you think to get a local radio if you've got passion and talent
[1:49:50.680 --> 1:49:54.600]  I mean i'm just another average person that got tired of tyranny and took action as well
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:58.280]  Tell folks about some of the stuff that's happened here. Look locally to your first amendment
[1:49:58.280 --> 1:50:06.440]  Yeah here locally for example, uh at the orange county courthouse judge belvin perry will stick you in a case for a 150 days
[1:50:06.600 --> 1:50:09.720]  If you hand out information, uh regarding jerry's rights
[1:50:10.280 --> 1:50:16.120]  100 no jury no trial no nothing judge perry will stick you in a case for 150 days sounds like he thinks he's god
[1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:20.680]  He does think he's god, you know, this is a this is a guy who uh, he stuck julian hyphen in the cage
[1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:25.880]  Well julian hyphen is a great activist and he actually was on the front lines of the civil rights movement
[1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:29.880]  If julian hyphen hadn't done what he'd done judge perry might not be a judge right now
[1:50:30.200 --> 1:50:34.440]  So it's ridiculous. Uh, for example, you're not allowed to feed homeless people in orlando
[1:50:34.440 --> 1:50:37.400]  They throw you in a cage for that. We've all seen those incredible videos
[1:50:37.480 --> 1:50:41.480]  But again, this is tyranny when a judge says you can't give people jury nullification
[1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:45.480]  By the way, we give a packet of that away with every order we have that's our citizen rule book
[1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:50.840]  That you judge the law as well as the facts. I mean, that's what juries are supposed to do. It's like northern juries
[1:50:50.840 --> 1:50:58.440]  Uh, who who wouldn't put people that that protected folks? Uh, I know because we're doing the radio show folks
[1:50:58.520 --> 1:51:01.640]  And some of this wasn't hooked up right. We're barely on air right now. Okay
[1:51:02.440 --> 1:51:04.440]  Now listen going back
[1:51:04.440 --> 1:51:09.400]  Crowd can't hear us because I'm having to just move microphones back and forth here. The point is is that they had
[1:51:10.600 --> 1:51:16.120]  People who protected black slaves who were running away and northern juries would let the people off
[1:51:16.120 --> 1:51:23.400]  Even though there were northern laws against helping people because it's bull laws that are unconstitutional and unconscionable are bull
[1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:29.240]  That's what the declaration of independence says. We're done playing games. Who is this tyrant judge?
[1:51:29.720 --> 1:51:33.800]  That's chief judge belvin parry. Many people may know him as the casey anthony judge
[1:51:33.960 --> 1:51:40.360]  He's the chief judge of orange nausea of counties and uh, yeah, he just he wrote he wrote a executive or a judicial order
[1:51:40.360 --> 1:51:46.280]  That said you cannot there is no first amendment at the courthouse. I will stick you in a cage for 150 days
[1:51:46.360 --> 1:51:52.040]  No jury no trial. No nothing. You're going to a cage because he's god. We've got a lot of these petty dictators
[1:51:52.120 --> 1:51:57.320]  No, they are not our gods. Yeah, absolutely judge parry. By the way is up for reelection. So
[1:51:58.280 --> 1:52:03.480]  Get out there. Don't let this guy be a judge any longer. He's a tyrant. There's judicial tyrants all over the place
[1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:08.360]  Absolutely, uh, for example also here. I mean, I was arrested for filming a police officer
[1:52:08.360 --> 1:52:14.760]  The police officer lied said I assaulted him stole my camera destroyed the evidence and they stuck me in a cage for 30 days
[1:52:14.840 --> 1:52:18.920]  Well, that's that's happening all over the place now when another camera tapes it like when they shot the guy in the back
[1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:22.280]  In handcuffs and said he was attacking him, but somebody else had videotaped it
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:25.880]  That's why they're trying to put people in lock in in jail for life
[1:52:26.760 --> 1:52:28.680]  Now, all right, man. Thanks for talking to us. Thank you
[1:52:29.640 --> 1:52:33.880]  Yeah, the system is now trying to put people in jail for life
[1:52:34.680 --> 1:52:36.680]  uh for life
[1:52:36.680 --> 1:52:43.080]  All right, let's kill this other mic now. Okay, let's kill this one. I can just get on every one of the microphones here
[1:52:47.560 --> 1:52:52.200]  All right, man, it is fun being on the road. This is basically like our beta test
[1:52:52.920 --> 1:52:57.880]  Here ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna say great job to my crew great job to 810
[1:52:58.680 --> 1:53:00.680]  The big 810 were number one
[1:53:01.640 --> 1:53:04.360]  Noon to 3 p.m. Eastern 11 to 2 central
[1:53:04.360 --> 1:53:06.360]  Uh here in town
[1:53:08.040 --> 1:53:14.280]  Again, I just want to say great job to all of you because you are here because you're tired of the tyranny
[1:53:14.440 --> 1:53:17.640]  You're not the system slave and you're standing up and saying
[1:53:18.040 --> 1:53:25.320]  We don't have a first amendment or property rights or the second amendment because you give us permission
[1:53:25.320 --> 1:53:34.680]  We got it because it was earned with blood and it's ours
[1:53:34.680 --> 1:53:41.960]  And anybody that says it isn't our right is a tyrant of the worst order. That means a government
[1:53:42.520 --> 1:53:43.800]  criminal thug
[1:53:43.800 --> 1:53:45.800]  They're trying to dominate you
[1:53:47.320 --> 1:53:52.360]  And all over this country, I've seen them try to put people in prison for life in illinois
[1:53:52.360 --> 1:54:00.520]  That's right. In fact, what was the guy's first name something allison guys looked that up illinois man faces life in prison
[1:54:01.320 --> 1:54:03.320]  for filming police
[1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:07.000]  Looked that up. Give me allison's first name. I keep forgetting it. It's driving me crazy
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:12.600]  It's like a splinter in my brain and the state came down to the county and did an ambiguous brief saying yes
[1:54:12.680 --> 1:54:16.680]  We want life in prison for him taping police towing cars from his house
[1:54:16.680 --> 1:54:22.920]  Okay, it's not wiretapping to tape the police and it's not anti-police police
[1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:26.040]  You are americans too
[1:54:26.920 --> 1:54:32.040]  You have a bill of rights and constitution. They're there for a reason
[1:54:32.280 --> 1:54:36.680]  They're there to protect your rights and your future as well
[1:54:37.400 --> 1:54:41.080]  All of these cop shows all these movies. I see now as I monitor it
[1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:47.000]  The constitution is the enemy and the good guy cops talk about about the constitution
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:51.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're trying to turn us against each other and police
[1:54:52.040 --> 1:54:56.600]  You're the one kram and cameras down our throats all the time in public saying no perception of privacy
[1:54:56.680 --> 1:54:57.800]  And that's true
[1:54:57.800 --> 1:55:05.000]  Then don't put people in jail and try to have kept juries put people in prison for simply exercising their first amendment
[1:55:05.320 --> 1:55:10.200]  This country is turning into a fascist police state as I have said for years
[1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:16.520]  And now as ron paul has said and we've got to reach out to the military and the police
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:18.600]  Who are americans as well?
[1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:23.560]  Who are starting to wake up because they will be the instruments just like they've been in every other tyranny
[1:55:23.960 --> 1:55:30.280]  Against the people they are the groups that the new world order plans to use against the population
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:34.360]  So we've got to reach out to them and we've got to work hard
[1:55:34.520 --> 1:55:37.880]  Well, the internet is still free and open to keep it free and open
[1:55:37.880 --> 1:55:44.120]  And we've got to use it now because they could shut it down with a fake cyber attack or other system
[1:55:44.280 --> 1:55:46.280]  We have got to work now
[1:55:46.600 --> 1:55:50.680]  Just the 1100 people are so that are here tonight
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:54.680]  I can go anywhere in the country and get a thousand two thousand people out
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  That's because ladies and gentlemen
[1:55:57.160 --> 1:56:03.640]  Liberty is popular and we are the majority and we have right on our side
[1:56:03.640 --> 1:56:07.960]  And the hoax that is the new world order is coming down
[1:56:12.200 --> 1:56:14.360]  So I salute all of you
[1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:18.600]  For being out here this evening and I salute carl

[1:56:36.360 --> 1:56:43.000]  Because more and more i'm hearing the message of liberty and awakening and sophisticated political thought
[1:56:43.240 --> 1:56:49.240]  That transcends left right paradigm and gets down to right and wrong liberty versus tyranny
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:57.000]  Freedom versus slavery and we've got to simply put that choice out and the people will choose liberty every single time
[1:56:57.240 --> 1:57:01.320]  But the battle is on now the war is on now
[1:57:02.600 --> 1:57:06.600]  For radio listeners, that's about it. We're about to go out and in the show, but I'll be back
