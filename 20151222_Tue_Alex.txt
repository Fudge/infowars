[00:00.000 --> 00:14.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.200 --> 00:24.680]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones if you want to know the model
[00:24.680 --> 00:31.520]  of internet censorship and how the globalists are gonna control every facet of life we're gonna
[00:31.520 --> 00:35.920]  be covering it coming up the start of the next segment Rand Paul and her this is a bill to kill
[00:35.920 --> 00:42.400]  Obama gun control there is just so much coming up today but first off John Bown as we open so many
[00:42.400 --> 00:47.760]  shows is another powerful report on the type of stuff they've tucked into the omnibus bill not
[00:47.760 --> 00:52.520]  just open borders not just bringing in the Syrian refugees not just all this pork barrel but
[00:52.520 --> 00:57.800]  censoring and controlling the internet in the name of cyber security more NSA spying here's that
[00:57.800 --> 01:05.240]  report back in April of 2015 55 civil society organizations security experts and academics
[01:05.240 --> 01:11.840]  signed a letter opposing CISA then in October of 2015 the Senate passed the Cyber Security
[01:11.840 --> 01:18.600]  Information Sharing Act by a vote of 74 to 21 that act quietly slipped its way into the government
[01:18.600 --> 01:24.560]  funding omnibus bill that was recently signed into law by President Obama however the CISA
[01:24.560 --> 01:31.080]  privacy provisions added to the omnibus stripped even more privacy protections than the October
[01:31.080 --> 01:36.880]  version they took a bad bill and they made it worse says Robin Green Policy Council for the
[01:36.880 --> 01:42.920]  Open Technology Institute essentially warrantless searches of anyone's private information will
[01:42.920 --> 01:48.560]  be shared between third-party companies and a whole new host of federal agency portals local
[01:48.560 --> 01:54.920]  police fusion centers and as a side effect foreign hackers wired reports the earlier bill had only
[01:54.920 --> 02:00.740]  allowed that back channel use of the data for law enforcement in cases of imminent threats while
[02:00.740 --> 02:06.120]  the new bill requires just a specific threat potentially allowing the search of the data
[02:06.120 --> 02:14.960]  for any specific terms regardless of timelines fact is not every bill with cyber security in
[02:14.960 --> 02:25.360]  the title is necessarily a good idea I believe this bill will do little to make Americans
[02:25.360 --> 02:34.360]  safer but will potentially reduce the personal privacy of millions of Americans in a very
[02:34.360 --> 02:44.520]  substantial way the groups that I'm talking about are ones with members who have companies
[02:44.520 --> 02:53.120]  with millions and millions of customers and they're saying they can't support this bill at this
[02:53.120 --> 03:02.760]  time I think I know why these companies who didn't have a problem with previous kinds of versions
[03:02.760 --> 03:10.600]  of this legislation are saying they don't support it these companies Mr. President are hearing from
[03:10.600 --> 03:17.640]  their customers and they're worried that their customers are saying this doesn't look like it's
[03:17.640 --> 03:23.920]  going to protect our privacy of course we want to be safe we also want to have our liberty and
[03:23.920 --> 03:29.800]  Franklin famously said anyone who gives up their liberty to have security really doesn't deserve
[03:29.800 --> 03:37.400]  either in 2013 declassified documents revealed that the NSA had been scooping up thousands of emails
[03:37.400 --> 03:43.480]  of citizens it wasn't allowed to target simply put if the government has any concern whether real
[03:43.480 --> 03:50.040]  or imagined about John Q public they can easily raid any and everything Mr. Public shares online
[03:50.040 --> 03:57.000]  and there is nothing John Q can do about it emails financial information political philosophy all of
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.720]  this done in the name of the CIA's blockbuster fail the interview after Americans were sold the
[04:02.720 --> 04:08.960]  propaganda that North Korea had hacked Hollywood Americans are now surveilled from the skies wire
[04:08.960 --> 04:14.600]  tapped through their cell phones energy usage is gathered by smart meters for the inevitable carbon
[04:14.600 --> 04:21.160]  taxation coming and all personal documents and information are devoured online without Americans
[04:21.160 --> 04:27.520]  consent this makes the East German secret police the Stasi look like the Cub Scouts completely

[08:16.480 --> 08:30.520]  a dizzying array of incredible information hopefully I'll get to 10% of it here today
[08:30.520 --> 08:37.840]  where to begin where to start Nico came in this morning one of the main producers of
[08:37.840 --> 08:45.360]  the radio slash TV transmission and he said I know you've mentioned this but um buckling
[08:45.360 --> 08:50.520]  my cousin who helped found info wars 20 years ago is on vacation right now he said buckling
[08:50.520 --> 08:54.560]  is sending me all these text messages and emails and freaking out about this and says
[08:54.560 --> 09:00.240]  you want to cover it so I guess buckling just discovered this and I say that in a good way
[09:00.240 --> 09:05.760]  because I mentioned it a few times six months ago I talked about it when Zuckerberg had
[09:05.760 --> 09:10.720]  the head of Chinese internet censorship to the United States for two weeks of intensive
[09:10.720 --> 09:14.880]  meetings about how to censor the internet better you then of course met with Merkel
[09:14.880 --> 09:20.480]  and was caught on a hot mic saying he would do that and then I'm glad that buckly's freaking
[09:20.480 --> 09:27.320]  out about this because this is something that we should freak out about because when you
[09:27.320 --> 09:32.520]  understand this and you understand Chinese government censorship is the model and the
[09:32.520 --> 09:37.800]  testing ground for the rest of the world because it is an open to Talitarian state there's
[09:37.800 --> 09:43.120]  no if fans are bucks about it and they execute you for your political views there and the
[09:43.120 --> 09:47.360]  fact that our media won't even talk about that today shows you just how authoritarian
[09:47.360 --> 09:54.440]  the mindset is of our leaders but when you wonder what all the NSA and corporate spying
[09:54.440 --> 09:59.680]  and the fusion of all that information is about and the algorithms that can predict
[09:59.680 --> 10:06.760]  what you're going to purchase online weeks before you do it it's bigger than just predicting
[10:06.760 --> 10:15.160]  the future in mass trends down to basically one one hundredth of a percent it's about
[10:15.160 --> 10:24.160]  then guiding future trends by manipulating stimuli
[10:24.160 --> 10:29.440]  when you get seven million plus people wired into the internet and you're tracking all
[10:29.440 --> 10:34.760]  the different metrics from energy usage to keystrokes to what people are buying where
[10:34.760 --> 10:39.240]  they're going what they're saying and you feed that all into giant supercomputers you
[10:39.240 --> 10:46.880]  get basically godlike predictive powers you want to know why the leader on such a power
[10:46.880 --> 10:54.120]  trip this is why and just in the last few days I've talked to a very successful well
[10:54.120 --> 10:58.880]  known director and producer in person I've known for years and I've talked to other
[10:58.880 --> 11:05.800]  people that I've known for more than a decade who have said yeah okay sixteen seventeen
[11:05.800 --> 11:09.000]  years ago I thought you were funny thought a lot of what you said was true but thought
[11:09.000 --> 11:17.680]  you were a crazy cook it's all true now I basically listen all the time but I'm going
[11:17.680 --> 11:21.800]  to just go along with the system now and not even talk about any of these issues that
[11:21.800 --> 11:28.560]  I had talked about a little bit because I'm afraid for my family that's separate from
[11:28.560 --> 11:37.080]  the producer director but the producer director was pretty much at that point because in Hollywood
[11:37.080 --> 11:44.480]  and in New York and the big media centers in DC and Chicago they openly call people
[11:44.480 --> 11:48.760]  into boardrooms now and tell them you're either with the world government and the totalitarian
[11:48.760 --> 11:54.760]  takeover or you're going to be left behind with the rest of the unwashed masses.
[11:54.760 --> 11:59.800]  We are turning off the resources we're saving the planet from the scourge of humans you get
[11:59.800 --> 12:09.920]  on board or you're going to be cut off and they're calling the military in from basically
[12:09.920 --> 12:18.440]  captains and above especially in special operations in giving them the same six speeches and it's
[12:18.440 --> 12:25.320]  kind of having a paradoxical effect that it makes what we do just have incredible credibility
[12:25.320 --> 12:35.040]  in the power structures just just frightening influence the show has I believe me I'm not
[12:35.040 --> 12:42.080]  bragging folks I knew we had a lot of influence a long time ago but man it's like thunderbolt
[12:42.080 --> 12:50.320]  level I cannot believe I am in this position I look at my reporters and I tell them I mean
[12:50.320 --> 12:58.920]  do you understand the position you're in how important what you cover this what you do
[12:58.920 --> 13:12.760]  the eyes of the world are on you and then you know even finding out super prominent
[13:12.760 --> 13:23.200]  conservative icons are afraid for their kids and don't think humanity is up to the challenge
[13:23.200 --> 13:29.320]  of taking on the new world order and they listen to this show and they say we really
[13:29.320 --> 13:37.280]  appreciate the job you're doing but we're not going to take this on just to talk about
[13:37.280 --> 13:42.120]  the Hollywood producer and director I talked about this other big media personality and
[13:42.120 --> 13:51.200]  then I was talking about another famous movie star just now who just is basically going
[13:51.200 --> 13:58.760]  to hide out and do some things against tyranny but just kind of do it at impulse speed kind
[13:58.760 --> 14:05.760]  of life support speed and we're not going to turn anything around without attitude and
[14:05.760 --> 14:16.640]  I'm not up here criticizing anybody I am just so committed to this and I talked to famous
[14:16.640 --> 14:25.600]  special forces people from the ground level right up to generals they're scared and they
[14:25.600 --> 14:35.760]  ask me why I'm not more scared I'm scared of the globalist winning I can't give up
[14:35.760 --> 14:44.040]  my fight right as so many people are waking up you see there's a realization taking place
[14:44.040 --> 14:48.560]  that we're in the hands of true scientific evil and a lot of people think they're just
[14:48.560 --> 14:53.360]  going to keep their head down and make it out of this keeping our heads down got us
[14:53.360 --> 15:03.600]  into this position I don't have much more proving what I've warned of here on air I
[15:03.600 --> 15:08.720]  mean it's really pointless it's almost like just giving a weather report in the middle
[15:08.720 --> 15:14.880]  of winter and telling you you know that it's below zero in Michigan or Minnesota I mean
[15:14.880 --> 15:27.000]  everybody knows that but I just can't believe the mind trick that they've run on men in
[15:27.000 --> 15:35.280]  this country to believe that they don't have the power to change the world and to believe
[15:35.280 --> 15:49.280]  that they should just capitulate to evil I mean as the evil intensifies I know that for
[15:49.280 --> 15:53.040]  every action there's an equal and opposite reaction Newtonian physics to spiritual rule
[15:53.040 --> 16:03.240]  as well and I can feel the power of liberty rising I can feel the strength the discernment
[16:03.240 --> 16:09.920]  the focus the will and a lot of men feel that as well but they're scared of it they need
[16:09.920 --> 16:16.560]  to embrace it and they need to commit to their destiny to fight tyranny because tiny one
[16:16.560 --> 16:26.840]  percent five percent measures against evil will not buy you a ticket out of hell and
[16:26.840 --> 16:32.000]  I mean hell on this planet not hell after you die and your children will be brought
[16:32.000 --> 16:40.680]  into bondage and will be destroyed by the globalist if you don't as men stand up against
[16:40.680 --> 16:52.480]  this system you see all these men out there that acts so tough boy somebody's dog craps
[16:52.480 --> 16:55.920]  in their yard they'll get in their face somebody takes their parking spot at the mall they'll
[16:55.920 --> 17:03.800]  get in their face they got courage up against other men but when it comes to social conditioning
[17:03.800 --> 17:16.840]  and fear of the media they shake in their boots it is a congressional medal of honor
[17:16.840 --> 17:23.240]  to be attacked and demonized and lied about by the establishment media it is not a mark
[17:23.240 --> 17:35.000]  of shame when these enemies lie about you but most people are in careers where they
[17:35.000 --> 17:41.600]  come out of entertainment they're not disciplined in that they're always immersed in what's
[17:41.600 --> 17:51.320]  going on and so they really don't understand the power of the individual overall and they
[17:51.320 --> 17:57.560]  really buy in to the overall bluster and bark of the New World Order you know the Bible
[17:57.560 --> 18:14.040]  says that Satan goes about like a lion roaring seeing who he may devour
[18:14.040 --> 18:21.200]  and people fall down before the devil in fear and they think that's going to protect them
[18:21.200 --> 18:30.040]  from the lion when you can run the spirit truth right into that beast and it'll turn
[18:30.040 --> 18:44.680]  tail and run so fast it'll make your head spin
[18:44.680 --> 18:56.360]  victory against evil is in our hands and all we need is a few good men who aren't afraid
[18:56.360 --> 19:03.460]  and who aren't afraid to fail so many great men and they are great men want to figure
[19:03.460 --> 19:14.960]  out the perfect lever the perfect button the perfect move the perfect plan to move the
[19:14.960 --> 19:34.340]  content it's the action it's the struggle that together will cause ripple effects that
[19:34.340 --> 19:55.220]  a
[19:55.220 --> 19:59.940]  and create electronic gulags, literal.
[19:59.940 --> 20:03.220]  Chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair and compromise your
[20:03.220 --> 20:06.580]  immune system, making you more vulnerable to all diseases.
[20:06.580 --> 20:10.900]  Since poor diet, injuries or stress are all contributing factors, many people suffer from
[20:10.900 --> 20:11.900]  inflammation.
[20:11.900 --> 20:15.740]  Your body's number one means of neutralizing inflammation and the pain that it may be causing
[20:15.740 --> 20:16.740]  is glutathione.
[20:16.740 --> 20:20.380]  Glutathione is the body's number one peptide to neutralize free radicals and thus stop
[20:20.380 --> 20:21.380]  inflammation.
[20:21.380 --> 20:25.900]  Hi, my name is Jason. I'm 44 years old. For 10 years, I had been suffering from chronic
[20:25.900 --> 20:30.260]  pain in my abdomen and groin that radiated down into my feet.
[20:30.260 --> 20:34.780]  After three weeks on one roadway, the pain in my feet reduced by 50% and the overall
[20:34.780 --> 20:37.380]  pain in my body reduced significantly as well.
[20:37.380 --> 20:39.940]  I ran out of one roadway and the pain returned.
[20:39.940 --> 20:45.100]  I got another container and again after three weeks, the pain reduced significantly throughout
[20:45.100 --> 20:46.100]  my body.
[20:46.100 --> 20:50.460]  I'd highly recommend one roadway to anyone dealing with chronic pain due to inflammation.

[24:21.100 --> 24:31.100]  Have yourself a merry little Christmas. Evil Charlie Brown song.
[24:31.100 --> 24:37.340]  I don't even play Christmas music but the war on Christmas is completely open and naked
[24:37.340 --> 24:42.740]  now. Colleges all over are banning it. They're banning. I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[24:42.740 --> 24:48.440]  saying it's racist. I'm not kidding that's in the stack today. They really are turning
[24:48.440 --> 24:57.500]  us into a big Soviet style gulag. It really is crazy and a lot of folks think complying
[24:57.500 --> 25:04.980]  is going to protect them. Now it's going to destroy us. I look at every news channel
[25:04.980 --> 25:11.940]  and all they show is police brutality videos by design to harness all the anger at the
[25:11.940 --> 25:16.980]  government and focus it at the police so the globalists can come in and federalize and
[25:16.980 --> 25:22.940]  globalize the local police. We have three different TV networks on the control room,
[25:22.940 --> 25:28.180]  another network on in the coffee room and every channel I just looked at as I walk
[25:28.180 --> 25:36.020]  through was police bashing. And you go Alex you're the guy that wrote the book literally
[25:36.020 --> 25:41.620]  and made the films literally on the corruption of police and the takeover of police. Yes
[25:41.620 --> 25:46.260]  that was to stop the globalists from taking them over and setting them up. This is a covert
[25:46.260 --> 25:55.140]  takeover. Now they're preparing to overthrow state and local governments and bring in UN
[25:55.140 --> 26:04.580]  thought crime reconciliation commissions and turn the police into pure political commissars
[26:04.580 --> 26:11.260]  to come after veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians and Christians that aren't on
[26:11.260 --> 26:22.500]  the government system. Period. This is a war. Do I like seeing some crazy cop taser some
[26:22.500 --> 26:27.020]  old lady. I like seeing some nut cop shoot some guy in the back. No, but that is the
[26:27.020 --> 26:31.940]  tiny minority of police and the police have been corrupted and have been twisted. So
[26:31.940 --> 26:39.460]  is society. But that is separate from the globalist trying to take over the police
[26:39.460 --> 26:44.300]  and running a war on the police. They got the police running their fake drug war on
[26:44.300 --> 26:50.700]  the public. That's something Congress brought in. That's something the CIA put in place.
[26:50.700 --> 26:55.380]  We change it at that level. We don't blame the police for it. They are the grass roots
[26:55.380 --> 27:01.380]  proletariat. There were the rubber meets the road. And when they've been bullied into submission
[27:01.380 --> 27:09.500]  and taken over, they're going to come and arrest your truly. You can guarantee that's
[27:09.500 --> 27:16.980]  where all this is going. I said I'd get into all the news and I will China social credit
[27:16.980 --> 27:23.260]  Beijing sets up huge system. There's the BBC reporting on it like it's no big deal. We're
[27:23.260 --> 27:26.900]  going to break down exactly what China announces and what they're setting up and going an informational
[27:26.900 --> 27:31.460]  video on this in a moment because this is the model. This is what Sopa and Syspa and
[27:31.460 --> 27:37.340]  all of this is about. This is what Zuckerberg and others admit they're doing. This is their
[27:37.340 --> 27:42.660]  plan. This is how they're going to do it. And they are calling in all the media people
[27:42.660 --> 27:49.620]  across this country from local talk radio to national talk radio to Hollywood and telling
[27:49.620 --> 27:55.420]  them you toe the line with what's going to come down with carbon taxes, forced inoculations,
[27:55.420 --> 27:59.260]  everything and you'll be left alone and you won't be enforced on. You won't have to do
[27:59.260 --> 28:04.580]  all this stuff. You'll get a get out of jail free card. But if you don't, we're going to
[28:04.580 --> 28:13.400]  come after you. I mean, they're, they're giving people these speeches now. Last year they
[28:13.400 --> 28:18.580]  legalized the CIA running domestic operations in propaganda and infiltration. And what do
[28:18.580 --> 28:21.980]  you think they do now? They put their people over every major media outlet and they sit
[28:21.980 --> 28:29.540]  there and they point blank, threaten everyone. They come to Matt Drudge and they go as a
[28:29.540 --> 28:36.340]  friend as a Supreme Court justice, you're done. They're going to shut you down. Implied
[28:36.340 --> 28:46.980]  you better roll over. And it's so crazy to hear the corrupt, compromised US government
[28:46.980 --> 28:54.100]  say that and the rogue central intelligence agency run by foreign interest that most Americans
[28:54.100 --> 29:02.980]  crap their pants. I don't. It's outrageously illegal. It's totally un-American. George
[29:02.980 --> 29:07.860]  Washington would just say fixed bayonets go right at that. That's what we're doing
[29:07.860 --> 29:11.980]  in the info war. These people do not have the moral high ground. They are hijackers
[29:11.980 --> 29:16.740]  of our country, hijackers of these agencies. And don't forget I have a special report coming
[29:16.740 --> 29:21.820]  up on this. There is a mutiny in the brass against this. That's why they tried to purge
[29:21.820 --> 29:30.180]  so many. I'm not lionizing the military for no reason. They are the only major group holding
[29:30.180 --> 29:38.580]  back so much of this. You think about that. That's why they want to take out the military,
[29:38.580 --> 29:42.820]  take out the police, take out local government, take out the state houses. This is a globalist
[29:42.820 --> 29:48.580]  takeover. America has been invaded. We are under attack. This is a red alert. We're
[29:48.580 --> 29:59.420]  on the March. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Thanks to
[29:59.420 --> 30:03.420]  the Federal Reserve system, America's economy is in a terminal decline. And according to
[30:03.420 --> 30:07.420]  economic expert Michael Snyder, here's eight facts that reveal just how bad the economy
[30:07.420 --> 30:12.500]  really is. Number one, majority of all American workers bring home less than $30,000 a year
[30:12.500 --> 30:17.220]  in wages. Number two, the poorest 40% of all Americans now spend most of their incomes
[30:17.220 --> 30:21.540]  just on food and housing. Number three, at least 50% of Americans who rent their homes
[30:21.540 --> 30:25.860]  spend more than a third of their incomes on the rent. Number four, incomes keep declining
[30:25.860 --> 30:30.340]  for a large majority of the US population. Number five, the price of ground beef has
[30:30.340 --> 30:35.260]  more than doubled since 2009. Number six, the rate of home ownership in the US has been
[30:35.260 --> 30:40.060]  declining for at least seven years in a row. It's now the lowest that has been in 20 years.
[30:40.060 --> 30:43.500]  Number seven, almost half of all Americans are not saving their money, and it's been
[30:43.500 --> 30:48.460]  estimated that 62% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Number eight, one third
[30:48.460 --> 30:52.300]  of all Americans with student loans are currently behind on their student loan debt. Check out

[33:21.060 --> 33:27.940]  The globalists are our enemies and we do the opposite of what they do. They sneak in by
[33:27.940 --> 33:33.180]  stealth brainwashing our children, adulterating our food and water, destroying our language,
[33:33.180 --> 33:43.540]  our sovereignty, attacking the family. They attack in the dead of night. We attack in
[33:43.540 --> 33:50.820]  frontal assaults to create spectacles, to open up the enemy, to draw them out and to
[33:50.820 --> 33:57.660]  run them over because they want the population to believe they're powerful and invincible.
[33:57.660 --> 34:03.420]  They are weak. I was just telling Rob, dude, some of the big names I've been talking to
[34:03.420 --> 34:09.900]  that are scared of the New World Order. Rob, dude, he's got so much courage in the reports
[34:09.900 --> 34:13.700]  and things he's done over the years. He doesn't act like a tough guy, but he is. He said they're
[34:13.700 --> 34:19.340]  weak every time we stand up. They fold. They're going to get us if we cower. That's when
[34:19.340 --> 34:26.340]  we lose. He said, look at Bundy Ranch with David Knight and Josh Owens. There went a
[34:26.340 --> 34:33.100]  thousand people. Many of them on horseback. None of them aiming guns at the feds except
[34:33.100 --> 34:37.660]  one guy for a media op. And the feds were saying, we're going to shoot you. We're going
[34:37.660 --> 34:40.580]  to shoot you. We're going to shoot you if you come across the fence. Of course they
[34:40.580 --> 34:47.180]  didn't. That was America's Tiananmen Square. And it shook the government and the criminals
[34:47.180 --> 34:51.860]  and Harry Reid to his core. He said, Homeland Security will get you. We're coming after
[34:51.860 --> 34:58.260]  you. You are domestic terrorist. No, Harry Reid, you're the terrorist terrorizing our
[34:58.260 --> 35:02.140]  Bill of Rights and Constitution, voting to bring in the real terrorists to attack us
[35:02.140 --> 35:10.860]  so you can then pass laws, taking more of our freedoms. Ladies and gentlemen, it's not
[35:10.860 --> 35:17.220]  that I don't have fear. I know how the world works and I have logic and I know history.
[35:17.220 --> 35:22.180]  I'm afraid of us rolling over and losing. And then they come and pick us all off one
[35:22.180 --> 35:31.260]  by one. I know we haven't lost. I know we're close to winning. And the enemy knows that.
[35:31.260 --> 35:34.700]  That's why they're so scared folks. They have pulled out the stops. I don't even have time
[35:34.700 --> 35:38.540]  to do it. But last night I spent about two hours just so I could really analyze it after
[35:38.540 --> 35:47.740]  the children went to bed at the computer, just scanning hundreds of articles yesterday
[35:47.740 --> 35:53.060]  with four or five talking points in all of them and looking how it was written by somebody
[35:53.060 --> 36:00.460]  else. They were given papers and this is admitted. This was definitely Justice Department, Southern
[36:00.460 --> 36:06.500]  Parvy Law Center or the CIA or a mix of them. But it was all to different publications,
[36:06.500 --> 36:13.420]  big ones, small ones, little ones, all saying the same lies to assassinate my character.
[36:13.420 --> 36:20.020]  And it felt so good. It was so exciting because that means we are directly over enemy targets
[36:20.020 --> 36:27.740]  right now. We are absolutely having devastating victory right now. We're devastating the enemy
[36:27.740 --> 36:36.500]  right now. And in a frontal assault, if I get blown to bits politically or they set me up
[36:36.500 --> 36:41.700]  or whatever the case is, it doesn't matter. Why do you think they haven't moved openly?
[36:41.700 --> 36:45.420]  Instead they use co- and teleprooperative infiltrators and things like that and we
[36:45.420 --> 36:49.580]  know all their tricks. And I literally just pray to God to protect us and it's just miraculous,
[36:49.580 --> 36:53.580]  the providence that happens to our enemies. And that's all behind the scenes stuff, but
[36:53.580 --> 37:02.020]  it's unbelievable. I hit my knees and within 24 hours my enemies are, I mean it's not
[37:02.020 --> 37:05.700]  just the internet, the new world order. It's not just this stuff with the globalist playing
[37:05.700 --> 37:13.060]  God. There's a whole other wireless internet. It's called the spirit. And you know who
[37:13.060 --> 37:19.060]  rules that? That's right. The devil wants to become that. The devil wants to be God.
[37:19.060 --> 37:23.500]  The devil isn't God. And if you don't even believe in a physical devil, the Carl Jung
[37:23.500 --> 37:29.580]  allegory, the art type, that's who the new order are. They have all the manifestations,
[37:29.580 --> 37:35.460]  all the characteristics, all the behaviors of what we would call the old serpent. There
[37:35.460 --> 37:42.940]  it is. Just like Ray Kurzweil said, I don't believe in God yet. I'm going to become God.
[37:42.940 --> 37:48.580]  And the God they're becoming isn't the God of the Bible. It's the God of this world,
[37:48.580 --> 37:56.740]  this little world. Hundreds of millions of galaxies photographed by the Hubble system.
[37:56.740 --> 38:01.940]  Millions of what are the believed habitable earth-like world, some of them only 25 light
[38:01.940 --> 38:10.900]  years away. And these people would have you believe that they're the gods of the universe.
[38:10.900 --> 38:15.000]  That's why everything they do is to shudder your consciousness and not let you see what's
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.220]  really all around you. I want to read this and then I'm going to get into all the pieces
[38:19.220 --> 38:25.380]  I've been mentioning. I do this maybe once a year. I should do it more often. There was
[38:25.380 --> 38:35.780]  a cocktail party with the New York Times, Washington Post and others at it in 2003.
[38:35.780 --> 38:39.500]  And they had just invented Iraq and lied about it. Everybody knew it was a lie. They've been
[38:39.500 --> 38:45.100]  told a lie. And they went over to Carl Rubb and they said, aren't we losing credibility?
[38:45.100 --> 38:48.580]  I mean, isn't there good and evil in the world? You can read the full articles. It was kind
[38:48.580 --> 38:51.740]  of like the Gospels. It was from different perspectives and different newspapers, how
[38:51.740 --> 38:54.820]  the reporters saw it. It was pretty much the same thing. Three articles were written about
[38:54.820 --> 38:59.260]  it. And I say like, you know, different perspectives, the different articles that were written,
[38:59.260 --> 39:04.140]  but it was the same, same quotes. And they go, you know, isn't there good and evil?
[39:04.140 --> 39:09.460]  I mean, really just a blow up Iraq when clearly Saudi Arabia is involved in 9-11 and Iraq's
[39:09.460 --> 39:13.660]  archenemies and they don't have WMDs. Why are we doing this? Why are we? I mean, because
[39:13.660 --> 39:22.100]  these reporters were going along with their orders. And Carl Rove looked at him and said,
[39:22.100 --> 39:26.660]  I control reality and you will do whatever I tell you. It doesn't matter how many lies
[39:26.660 --> 39:31.180]  there are. We that run the government are history's actors now and you will just follow
[39:31.180 --> 39:36.940]  that. He said, you don't control your destiny. You're a slave. And they still bucked him
[39:36.940 --> 39:41.460]  and didn't, you know, use his name for the first few years, but they put the article
[39:41.460 --> 39:46.740]  out. I read another article one time about a beautiful reporter. She was at one of these
[39:46.740 --> 39:53.620]  cocktail parties and Richard Pearl was there. And he was walking around to different women
[39:53.620 --> 39:59.540]  saying, you know how many people I've killed? I'm powerful. I don't kill people physically.
[39:59.540 --> 40:03.980]  The big giant black circles around his eyes looks like a crossing the penguin in Nosferatu
[40:03.980 --> 40:14.500]  meets Count Dracula, meets Frankenstein, meets Lardass. And the women were just repulsed
[40:14.500 --> 40:21.180]  by it. But he didn't seem to know that women weren't impressed by a guy walking around
[40:21.180 --> 40:25.940]  talking about, I command forces and I kill people. I imagine he's walking around, I
[40:25.940 --> 40:30.980]  kill people. I kill people. I mean, Vladimir Putin has killed people with his bare hands.
[40:30.980 --> 40:36.900]  He hasn't run around going, I killed people. I killed people. I am powerful. I mean, what
[40:36.900 --> 40:57.580]  a joke. This is who rules us. It's just they're so wicked and so pathetic. We just hand over
[40:57.580 --> 41:07.900]  our authority to them and just grovel. Let me read you the actual Carl Rowe quotes.
[41:07.900 --> 41:14.060]  The aid said that guys like me were in what we call the reality based community. This
[41:14.060 --> 41:19.380]  is Carl Rowe talking to them. In what we call the reality based community, which he defined
[41:19.380 --> 41:24.940]  as people who believe that solutions emerge from your judicial study of discernible reality.
[41:24.940 --> 41:32.820]  I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles. He cut me off. That's not the
[41:32.820 --> 41:37.140]  way the world really works anymore. He continued. We're an empire now and when we act, we create
[41:37.140 --> 41:40.660]  our own reality. And while you're studying that reality, judiciously as you will, we'll
[41:40.660 --> 41:45.500]  act again, creating other new realities, which we can study too. And that's how things will
[41:45.500 --> 41:50.620]  sort out. We're history's actors now and you, all of you, will be left just to study what
[41:50.620 --> 41:59.340]  we do. And you see that with the neocons running the Obama administration to a great extent.
[41:59.340 --> 42:02.540]  They're now threatening to break off, create their own party of your own front. It's the
[42:02.540 --> 42:07.460]  nomination to give it to Hillary. Of course they run her. This is exposing the one party
[42:07.460 --> 42:12.380]  system right now. Even Paul Craig Roberts has come out in support of Trump. Now he gets
[42:12.380 --> 42:25.060]  it. And you look at this and you look at where society's going and you see Obama saying two
[42:25.060 --> 42:31.980]  plus two equals five. I mean, that's in common core. And you didn't build your business and
[42:31.980 --> 42:36.140]  raising the debt doesn't raise the debt. And you can keep your doctor and the healthcare
[42:36.140 --> 42:46.780]  is free. And we're not coming after your guns.
[42:46.780 --> 42:52.540]  That's them telling you that reality doesn't matter. When Winston Smith, for the Ministry
[42:52.540 --> 42:57.900]  of Truth, he's a propagandist, is at the Ministry of Love where they torture people to death.
[42:57.900 --> 43:06.620]  Up is down, down is up, 1984. And O'Brien, one of the chief technicians, one of the party
[43:06.620 --> 43:13.100]  heads enjoys his work torturing people because he is a priest of power attacking the human
[43:13.100 --> 43:19.420]  beauty and trampling it forever in a ritual human sacrifice. They had a top Russian Duma
[43:19.420 --> 43:25.820]  member come out on Russian TV two days ago and say, basically the people running America
[43:25.820 --> 43:32.020]  are Satanist and they want to sacrifice America. And then there were other quotes about its
[43:32.020 --> 43:39.100]  ritual sacrifice in the debates talking about blowing up Russia. See, it's not that Russia's
[43:39.100 --> 43:45.780]  so good, it's that we're so bad. They've already been through the depths of hell. And so they're
[43:45.780 --> 43:53.740]  clawing at the surface wanting air. We're told sitting down here on the bottom turning
[43:53.740 --> 44:01.700]  blues fun. And that's why you watch any sitcom, any drama, any movie, reality and things making
[44:01.700 --> 44:07.820]  sense are under attack to scramble people's brains so they will accept this globalist
[44:07.820 --> 44:18.780]  cultural spiritual genetic overwrite that's happening right now. There is no escaping
[44:18.780 --> 44:26.700]  this but by resisting it. There's a spirit of the new world order. It says, row, row,
[44:26.700 --> 44:35.140]  row your boat gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily life is but a dream.
[44:35.140 --> 44:39.060]  And they teach that you manifest by what you believe. And so you just believe something
[44:39.060 --> 44:44.580]  that's going to happen. No, you become delusional and frame reality to your delusion. The secret
[44:44.580 --> 44:51.980]  is a fraud. When you have the tools, the research, the background, the capacity and the developmental
[44:51.980 --> 45:05.420]  time humans can manifest were made in the image of God. But it's not done instantaneously.
[45:05.420 --> 45:14.660]  And I've had multiple people in the system recite to me like they were out of a space
[45:14.660 --> 45:21.460]  cult. Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
[45:21.460 --> 45:27.340]  life is but a dream. They are choosing as members of the successful class, not the ruling
[45:27.340 --> 45:34.900]  class, but the pampered class, the last class to be destroyed, but already being rotted
[45:34.900 --> 45:45.900]  from within because evil can only move against something that's already fallen unless goodness
[45:45.900 --> 45:52.740]  gives itself up to be destroyed. I mean, these are the deep secrets, ladies and gentlemen.
[45:52.740 --> 46:04.060]  The enemy doesn't want you to know. Abject doom is where the new order takes us. It's
[46:04.060 --> 46:14.660]  what it does. The devil and its spirit is a spoiled rotten punk that if they can't be
[46:14.660 --> 46:19.660]  God, they're going to wreck everything else and wreck everybody else's free will and wreck
[46:19.660 --> 46:27.620]  everybody else's capacity to grow in God's plan to things that our eyes and ears and
[46:27.620 --> 46:42.300]  minds that cannot even see or hear or imagine. Let me go ahead and get into this situation
[46:42.300 --> 46:47.940]  with China since I mentioned it. Not a bunch of articles here. Oh, China's social credit,
[46:47.940 --> 46:51.300]  Beijing sets up huge system. That's because England's coming in where they arrest you
[46:51.300 --> 46:58.180]  for your speech, even if it's nonviolent. It says most countries, the existence of a
[46:58.180 --> 47:03.040]  credit system isn't controversial. Oh, see, it's not controversial. Past financial information
[47:03.040 --> 47:06.340]  is used to predict whether individuals will pay their mortgages or credit card bill in
[47:06.340 --> 47:12.940]  the future. But China is taking the whole concept a few steps further. Oh, see, they
[47:12.940 --> 47:16.100]  just roll it out like it's no big deal. Then we actually have the proposal. The Chinese
[47:16.100 --> 47:23.380]  government is building an omnipotent, oh, that's not dangerous, social credit system
[47:23.380 --> 47:28.620]  that is meant to rate each citizen's trustworthiness. And of course, who enters the data? You always
[47:28.620 --> 47:34.460]  hear from these UN supported, New York Times supported zeitgeist folks and their dumb down
[47:34.460 --> 47:39.580]  followers on average who just want to hear something, some easy fix. Hey, we got spaceships,
[47:39.580 --> 47:43.780]  big plastic cities, it'll be heaven. You won't have to work. A big computer will decide what
[47:43.780 --> 47:48.500]  job you get and what you do. Oh, great, it's impartial. Oh, really? Like the Nazi IBM
[47:48.500 --> 47:53.420]  machines were impartial? What are you talking about? They're programmed for what they want
[47:53.420 --> 48:06.380]  to happen out of it. Within the next four years, China will enroll the entire country,
[48:06.380 --> 48:14.180]  companies, infrastructure, everything by law, fed in to their NSA style systems, minor
[48:14.180 --> 48:21.580]  traffic violations, friends of yours that don't have good social rating. What you've
[48:21.580 --> 48:26.820]  said about the government, everything will be fed into it and the BBC reports it like
[48:26.820 --> 48:32.140]  it's a good thing. Now, what's that tell you? See, that's even more of the story, isn't
[48:32.140 --> 48:36.900]  it? Let's continue to anti-media breakdown that actually quotes from the Chinese government
[48:36.900 --> 48:45.100]  announcement. China, as if further proof were needed of Orwell's dystopia is now upon us,
[48:45.100 --> 48:52.940]  China has now gamified obedience to the state. Though that is every bit as creepy, terrifying
[48:52.940 --> 48:57.060]  as it sounds, citizens may still choose whether or not they wish to opt in, which gives you
[48:57.060 --> 49:02.180]  a basically horrible score. That is until the program becomes compulsory. Going under the
[49:02.180 --> 49:09.820]  innocuous name of Sesame Credit, China has created a score for how good a citizen you
[49:09.820 --> 49:15.020]  are, explains extra credits video about the program. The owners of China's largest social
[49:15.020 --> 49:20.540]  networks have partnered with the government to create something akin to the US credit
[49:20.540 --> 49:24.700]  score, but instead of measuring how regularly you pay your bills, it measures how obediently
[49:24.700 --> 49:30.940]  you follow the party line. And then it goes over all of it. And here's the rest of the
[49:30.940 --> 49:42.020]  story. This is being set up here. China's working with Microsoft and others to beta test everything
[49:42.020 --> 49:49.580]  there where they have no laws protecting people to then roll it out completely here. And that's
[49:49.580 --> 49:54.340]  why you look at SOPA, SysPen, all these other acts, cybersecurity garbage, it meshes with
[49:54.340 --> 50:02.700]  this. And a lot of folks will say, well, I better go along with the system. I'd go along
[50:02.700 --> 50:07.220]  with helping the farmers market. And I'd go along with giving local police officers videos
[50:07.220 --> 50:10.460]  and books and material to wake them up. I'd go along with running for city council and
[50:10.460 --> 50:16.540]  state house. I'd work with your state. But the federal government's been seized. Just
[50:16.540 --> 50:22.340]  like Vici France. And you go along with this, you are a collaborator. Now, that doesn't
[50:22.340 --> 50:25.820]  mean everybody's perfect and that you're not going to buy some corporate stuff or go along
[50:25.820 --> 50:29.260]  with some stuff at times. Everybody does what you have to, but just be conscious of it and
[50:29.260 --> 50:37.060]  realize that this isn't a game. And they're going to use this in cultural shunning where
[50:37.060 --> 50:41.220]  people won't associate because, oh my gosh, my digital score will be lowered. Then I can't
[50:41.220 --> 50:46.980]  get loans. I can't get online. I can't get jobs. That creates electronic systems that
[50:46.980 --> 50:56.660]  will manifest true ghettos or virtual concentration camps is what this is for your political and
[50:56.660 --> 50:59.500]  spiritual beliefs. Mark of the Beast.

[54:05.180 --> 54:08.540]  By the way, I just walked in the control room during the break. Everybody had some pretty
[54:08.540 --> 54:12.220]  serious solemn looks on their faces. That's because they sit in there and read all the
[54:12.220 --> 54:20.740]  same stuff, see the same video clips I see. They know I'm not making this stuff up. And
[54:20.740 --> 54:25.140]  yes, Matt was saying, man, that's one of the darkest segments in a long time. It's one
[54:25.140 --> 54:30.260]  of the brightest segments in a long time because they don't want you to know they're pushing
[54:30.260 --> 54:36.780]  darkness and evil and creeping up on you. We are firing flares into the night and we're
[54:36.780 --> 54:42.260]  not the ones that are showing, you know, we're not the ones manifesting the evil, the darkness.
[54:42.260 --> 54:50.500]  We're showing it. So see, we're not dark. We're being real with you folks to hopefully
[54:50.500 --> 54:59.380]  not scare you, but motivate you to say no to this. Because the end game of this whole
[54:59.380 --> 55:05.460]  plan is to get us into electronic ghettos where we don't have jobs or easily control
[55:05.460 --> 55:11.180]  or rapport. And then they're going to put us in physical ghettos. The British government
[55:11.180 --> 55:14.540]  is openly announced and other ones, we've played the newscast that in the future, if
[55:14.540 --> 55:17.700]  you don't take microchips, you don't let the computer direct your life. When you get
[55:17.700 --> 55:21.100]  it meet where you work, what you do, you'll still be free. You're going to be put in a
[55:21.100 --> 55:31.380]  physical ghetto. In my God, they're really doing it. They're really doing it, people.
[55:31.380 --> 55:33.980]  And then you'll beg for the ghettos because they're going to flood us with so many thermal
[55:33.980 --> 55:38.380]  populations that are collapsing who I care about. The globalist blocked their development.
[55:38.380 --> 55:43.780]  The globalist literally engineered this, admitted it all in the late 40s. But it doesn't matter.
[55:43.780 --> 55:50.300]  It's still a weapon system. God help us. That's why you see somebody like Vladimir Putin
[55:50.300 --> 55:54.780]  who I've been very critical of in ways over the years trying to be balanced. But basically
[55:54.780 --> 56:00.380]  he opposes everything the new world order is doing. And a lot of cold warriors who didn't
[56:00.380 --> 56:08.700]  trust Putin are now changing their mind. You can look at Putin. He doesn't look like what
[56:08.700 --> 56:14.660]  he looked like 10 years ago. And I've been told by people high up in the Russian media
[56:14.660 --> 56:17.700]  and Russian government and other systems that I was told this years ago and didn't believe
[56:17.700 --> 56:24.980]  it. Now I know it. Putin actually watches my films, listens to the show. We've been
[56:24.980 --> 56:29.540]  invited out to Russia one time. I didn't go and it was, I'm not going to get into it.
[56:29.540 --> 56:37.420]  But the point is, is that if I get invited again, I'm going to go. I need to see this
[56:37.420 --> 56:50.660]  for myself. But humanity is in trouble, folks. We're in a lot of trouble. Matt and Nico,
[56:50.660 --> 56:52.700]  you guys didn't even want to come on here, but I want to drag you on here. I want to
[56:52.700 --> 56:58.100]  get you guys on air more. And all of you, anybody wants to pop in here. But just briefly,
[56:58.100 --> 57:02.580]  I mean, your take on this, because we know that the U.S. and Europe are adopting the
[57:02.580 --> 57:08.420]  Chinese censorship model. And this is so draconian. This is, you can buy and or sell without
[57:08.420 --> 57:12.700]  the mark, the digital marked, you're a good little digital slave. This is it. And you're
[57:12.700 --> 57:15.940]  not going to hear a word out of the churches about this because they're so controlled.
[57:15.940 --> 57:18.780]  Nico, Matt.
[57:18.780 --> 57:23.060]  So I haven't really done much research on it until this morning, whenever Buckley sent
[57:23.060 --> 57:28.340]  me that article, and I've been reading up on it. And people over there are on all ends
[57:28.340 --> 57:31.920]  of the spectrum. Some people know about it and they think it's good because their social
[57:31.920 --> 57:37.020]  credit score allows them to book hotels without paying a deposit and whatnot. But if you have
[57:37.020 --> 57:42.020]  a bad score, they encourage people to push anybody else who has a bad score away from
[57:42.020 --> 57:45.500]  you because any friends that you associate with have a bad score will bring your score
[57:45.500 --> 57:46.500]  down and that will.
[57:46.500 --> 57:49.220]  And the government can put it arbitrarily in there. It's not like it's some private
[57:49.220 --> 57:51.980]  society you opt into like the credit system.
[57:51.980 --> 57:57.500]  Well, currently it's opt in quote unquote, and then it'll be mandatory 2020 moving forward.
[57:57.500 --> 58:01.180]  And the way that they're going to implement this is if you have a good score, then you
[58:01.180 --> 58:05.980]  get perks. If you have a bad score, then it's hard for you to, you're limited in the number
[58:05.980 --> 58:06.980]  of jobs you can get.
[58:06.980 --> 58:10.460]  And then they can change the stimuli with more and more control to keep your good score
[58:10.460 --> 58:13.900]  and get you to do anything they want. And as Matt pointed out, the gamification with
[58:13.900 --> 58:17.780]  all these video games and online stuff, that's priming everybody. Stay there, Nico. I didn't
[58:17.780 --> 58:20.780]  mean to cut you off, but you're absolutely on target. Stay there. Come back with Nico.
[58:20.780 --> 58:24.660]  Come back with Matt. Then William Benny, former technical director of the National Security
[58:24.660 --> 58:30.260]  Agency, the biggest NSA whistleblower in history, technically even bigger than Snowden. It's
[58:30.260 --> 58:38.260]  all coming up. I've signed my John Hancock. If you take action, folks, you only live once.

[59:18.660 --> 59:22.100]  Brain force is here. Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months. You
[59:22.100 --> 59:26.100]  probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because
[59:26.100 --> 59:53.600]  of brain force.
[59:56.100 --> 01:00:09.600]  It's 2 a.m. when the hitman comes. He knows that he's been cheated, that he's killing
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.600]  himself and his whole family.
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:28.120]  It's easy to serve evil. It's easy to worship that twisted flame. It's easy to bow at that
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:35.440]  altar. It's hard to give life. It's hard to lay down your life. It's hard to stand up
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:43.280]  against the criticism. Till you step across that line, then you know it was all an illusion.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:50.360]  All a fraud. You've now stepped out of the domain of this world. You realize what a sick
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.280]  joke it is that humanity could have been free any time they made the conscious decision
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:05.800]  to do so when the bullet hits the bone.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:11.800]  All right, Daniels wants to pop in. I want to get Matt to pop in with their point. They
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.960]  were making these points during the break and I basically came in and repeated their
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.040]  point saying, hey, you tell them what you said and then I said it. But this is really
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.320]  revealing the mark of the beast, how it's going to work. Everybody always knew this,
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.480]  a digital number, your face print, your thumb print. It's your social media that if you
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:31.960]  don't behave and do what they say, you don't get the mark. I mean, this is it. The China
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:38.480]  globalist model, Zuckerberg's rolling it out the whole nine yards. It's like Facebook
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:41.840]  goes, oh, here we're giving you this Facebook message. You can reach millions with it. We
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:49.040]  hope you're nice. Hope that doesn't get taken away if you're not. See, this is how it all
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:55.720]  works. Play ball, Alex. It's fun. Go along with it. Yeah, I get the people down at the
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:02.200]  mid level and the higher levels are nice folks that sold out. Wink, wink. I ain't doing it.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:08.400]  Because I know who runs the show at the top and boy, he doesn't like life. Get Daniels,
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.400]  your comments on this.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:16.400]  Well, the whole control over the population, what's more important than having money is
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:21.960]  having the control over creation of money and how people engage. And now this won't
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.120]  let you use it. Now you won't have other economies. That's why they're shutting down the farmers
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:29.360]  markets and eliminate stands. Exactly. They can't have anything that isn't box stores
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:34.480]  and you've got to go to it to get your food. The Soviet model on PCP and a high tech grid.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.560]  Go ahead. Sorry. When you have a tiny elite that has control over the money supply, they
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:42.960]  have control over human energy because think about it. You and me and millions of other
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:49.960]  people in America, they're hardworking Americans. They go out and they spend their expense, their
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:52.040]  energy in order to make a paycheck.
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:55.160]  Oh yeah. Now the banks are saying they're going to charge to keep money on them.
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:03:01.120]  Yeah. So, I mean, it's basically all it comes down to is this total control over the population.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.320]  And we won't organize. We won't stand up for each other. So we're going to get screwed
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.320]  big time. But it's okay because there's a black guy up there who's liberal and Hillary,
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:12.280]  he's taking care of us. Doesn't matter if they allow loan sharking loan rates all across
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:16.320]  the country. Doesn't matter if they're screwing everybody over with Obamacare. We feel like
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.480]  we're winners. So it's okay. And the Republicans at the top are all part of it. So they won't
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.960]  expose it either. That's why we're in so much trouble. Go ahead. Sorry.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.920]  Yeah. I mean, I'm sorry for laughing. It's really not even that funny when you think
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:33.160]  about it. But yeah, it's like it just goes back to lust for power that's been going on
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.160]  for thousands of years.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.560]  Yeah. The lust to screw everybody over.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:42.240]  Yeah. And the easiest way now for the elite to have gained power is through controlling
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:49.160]  money and controlling the money supply. Because once you control money and its creation and
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:54.720]  how it's spent and how it's saved, you have control over everything. And that's just sadly,
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.720]  that's just the way it is.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.320]  And then people say, oh, it's just the elite. They want world peace. It's okay. Let them
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:02.240]  have control. No, they want to genetically engineer everything and kill everybody.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.240]  Yeah.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.360]  You cannot give these psychos control folks.
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.980]  Yeah. Look at it this way. I mean, think about how they are putting all these controls
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:14.520]  over money and capital control saying, oh, we're using this to fight terrorism to track
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:18.680]  the money through ISIS and whatnot, but they're the ones that created ISIS. It's just another
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:19.680]  false flag.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.440]  It's totally naked. Totally obvious. Matt, quick comment. Do you want to come on and
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.840]  make your point about game realism?
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:25.840]  Sure. Yeah.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.040]  That 30 seconds. Go ahead.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:35.040]  Gamification is indoctrination. I'm looking at the definition. I've got it up here on
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:41.040]  my computer. And the end of that right there, typically as an online marketing technique
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:46.600]  to encourage engagement in a product or service while sucking you into a false reality. After
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.960]  Benny leaves and the wind, Benny's on, I'm going to bring you up halfway in to give you
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.760]  a few minutes early, lay this out and get his take on it. This is one of the smartest
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:59.840]  people when it comes to mathematics out there. Stay with us.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:05.040]  The website, the Daily Beast has accused info wars of putting on a mock mass shooting that
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:10.160]  we had nothing to do with. Their article is titled conspiracy theorists terrorized our
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:16.480]  town in which they write info wars, worse humans invaded Texas to stage a mass shooting.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:21.880]  We counter protested being the author and his friends outnumbering them 20 into one.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:27.600]  They still don't believe that Sandy Hook ever happened. As far as the Sandy Hook accusation,
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:33.480]  we discussed that in great detail on the December 21st, 2015 edition of the Alex Jones show.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:38.000]  So I'll focus on the rest of the article. The author, who took great pride in making
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.560]  fart noises like a seven year old child, went on to accuse us of stringing the media along
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:48.160]  and then hosting the event in an area with no cameras. Once again, we did report on the
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:52.920]  event like dozens of other news agencies, but we had nothing to do with it. You can
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:06:01.920]  find more reports on info wars.com. In the 15 year history of prisonplanet.tv,

[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:23.600]  Thank you for joining us. We're now well into the second hour the 22nd day of December 2015
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:30.560]  on this Tuesday edition. I am your host Alex Jones. The news websites are infowars.com
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:35.560]  prisonplanet.com and please don't take for granted the fact that you can still visit
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:41.400]  these websites. There are all sorts of moves to censor the internet. The FCC chair who
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:48.120]  sought to regulate drudge slams colleagues is dysfunctional. There are open moves to
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:53.200]  censor the internet. Again, Matt drudge when he visited us a few months ago was told point
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.400]  blank by a Supreme Court justice who he told me about privately but didn't say the name
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:00.320]  on air that they've been told next year they're going to try to pass laws and regulations
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:05.320]  to censor the internet and free speech and call it political speech and try to tax it.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:09.360]  The power to tax is the power to destroy so much happening. I want to get William Benny's
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.440]  take today, former technical leader for the intelligence within national security agency,
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:19.960]  the developer of any of the systems we see and use today, according to major defense
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:25.160]  publications, probably one of the greatest code breakers ever, not just living. But I
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:29.880]  want to get his take on China just launched the most frightening game ever and it will
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:34.120]  be mandatory. We've talked about this some but now it's official. They're going to force
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:39.120]  everyone in the next four years in China to adopt it. It goes online next year. All your
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:44.000]  purchases what you do, what you say about the government will be put into a social
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  credit score. You won't be able to get hotels, won't be able to travel, won't be able to
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.360]  leave the country if you haven't been a good party member or if you haven't towed the
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:56.800]  party line. This is the mark of the beast. Even if you don't believe in God the devil
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:02.400]  whatever they're using it as an owner's manual where all your data goes in and this is what
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.800]  Zuckerberg's been meeting with the head of the Chinese censorship bureau who set up this
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:13.960]  infrastructure. This is the model and it's incredibly dangerous. It's over the top. We've
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:18.740]  got all these omnibus bills and surveillance bills being rammed through always happening
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:23.680]  around the Christmas season when people are distracted. There's so much discussed with
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:28.360]  William Benny. He's the former technical leader for intelligence for the NSA before becoming
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:32.920]  a whistleblower in late 2001 privately to Congress. Nothing was done. After more than
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:37.160]  30 years with the agency, Benny has been described as one of the best analysts and code breakers
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:41.400]  in NSA history, but he continues to speak out about the NSA's data collection policies
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:46.000]  and continues interviews in the media regarding his experiences and they got the new big movie
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.240]  coming out. Of course that Oliver Stone's putting out that has a big character playing
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:56.000]  the part of William Benny in it. He's testified in affidavit that the NSA is a deliberate
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.840]  violation of the U.S. Constitution. Exposed facts.org has a lot of his writings. He of
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:09.600]  course has physically come and been interviewed by us here and it's important to understand
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.800]  he's made the statement. This is about total social control of the general public, not
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:18.280]  about protecting us from terrorists. Notice they let the Syrian refugees in who are really
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:24.560]  mainly Sunni invaders, homesteaders, pilgrims trying to come in and take over Syria out
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.680]  of Saudi Arabia, other countries. That's a minute, 80 percent, the Pentagon admits,
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:33.400]  80 percent roughly. The EU says that as well. Fake passports, you name it. Large percentages
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.320]  of Jihadis are now being brought in. Clearly. So when they attack, they'll say it's not
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:40.960]  Muslim terror, but we got to take your guns. We got to restrict your rights. We got to
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:46.640]  reauthorize all the NSA spying. We've got to expand it. So this is what we're dealing
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:53.360]  with. They're not protecting us. Fourteen years after 9-11, Al Qaeda has turned into
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:57.960]  the giant ISIS organization with hundreds of thousands. How is that? With Hillary Clinton
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:03.840]  and others openly funding them with the weapons. It's clear. Saudi Arabia gets to take over
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.280]  the Middle East with its fighters. They play along with their anti-American, get a few
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:12.000]  targets, wind up some of their operatives who don't know what they're doing to attack
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  us. And then Western governments can set up totalitarianism. And it came out a few months
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.480]  ago in NSA reports. And it's also come out. CIA has admitted it. ISIS puts out in their
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:29.600]  official magazine that we're not CIA. We're not working with the West. Don't listen to
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.300]  that. And that's the one thing hurting their recruitment is that young Muslims can't be
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:38.240]  wound up by them to go and shoot up and blow stuff up because they're understanding this
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:43.640]  has meant to cause a clash of civilizations and more invasions in the Middle East to knock
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:48.400]  out countries like Syria that aren't against the United States. Just like Saudi Arabia is
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:54.560]  involved attacking us on 9 11. That's now in the 28 pages. We know that. And we attack
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:59.320]  Iraq. So there's such an awakening. This is incredible. Now, when I wanted to bring
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:03.440]  up to William Benning was a new book called military to military, the London review of
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:07.820]  books covered yesterday, as well as the Newarker magazine, where Sy Hurst, the two time Pulitzer
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:12.680]  prize winner, breaks down what we already know from Colonel Schaefer and our other
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:17.280]  contacts that we broke three and a half, four years ago with Benghazi. I'm just setting
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:23.360]  the table here with William Benning. It was the rest of the hour that our own military
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:31.640]  from majors, captains, master sergeants, you name it, on up to two star generals, like
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:39.480]  the former head of defense intelligence, Michael Flynn coming out and saying, we are ordered
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:43.480]  to create this ISIS group and to fund them. This is a willful plan. And I don't know
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:47.640]  why they're doing it. Well, it's so they can take American freedoms and European freedoms
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:53.240]  away. But we have a lot of top generals now that have just quit or been fired going public.
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:57.840]  So there is what I would call a soft counter coup, not a coup by the military, which I
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:03.560]  don't support very dangerous, normally goes bad, but a literal soft coup. And it's coming
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:09.960]  out in the news, but then getting spun. So William Benning spent years testifying secretly
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:14.000]  to Congress behind closed doors, and he was rewarded with a SWAT team raid while he was
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.160]  in the shower. They waited till that to drag him around naked in his house. That's what
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:21.720]  they do to demoralize you.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:27.800]  With for testifying to Congress as the former technical director, that's a guy running the
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:34.400]  actual show. Because he exposed, they could have stopped Al Qaeda, they could have all
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:39.880]  of it. And they tried to set him up. They tried to set up Drake and others. I mean, the guys,
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:45.040]  this is a true hero. And he doesn't want to be called that. We need to recognize who
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.640]  the heroes are. It's not people putting basketballs and hoops or people, you know, hitting golf
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:53.520]  balls and hole on ones. It's people that stand up for what's right and really try to protect
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.520]  this country as well.
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:59.560]  Now I'm done with my five minute preface, Mr. Benning. I've set a lot of stuff out there,
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:04.000]  the latest bills, the legislation, all of it. But just to go from 10 years ago, them denying
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.200]  there was any illegal NSA spying to now admitting it all and trying to codify it in law and
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:12.280]  then admitting it's being used against Congress and political enemies. And now they want to
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:17.320]  merge with China with a system that socially tracks everything you do to not let you buy
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:24.360]  or sell or live a digital black bull that I warned of 20 years ago. I mean, this is
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:29.520]  unprecedented, the conscious evil nature of this, sir. You can start anywhere you wish.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.520]  I appreciate you joining us.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:37.480]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex. I'm glad to be back with you. Yes, you've said an
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:44.240]  awful lot there. I mean, I guess the real point is that the intelligence agencies of
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:48.920]  the world are kind of banding together to do this kind of monitoring of everybody on
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:54.360]  the planet, and it's spreading. And they're using different... They're lying to the public
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:16:00.200]  and giving them disinformation about, for example, the latest lies are about they couldn't
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:04.160]  stop Paris or San Bernardino because they were encrypting.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:08.480]  Well, when the evidence comes out, you find out that that's just another lie. It's another
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:14.040]  disinformation program where they want people to believe it's one thing when in fact it's
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:19.120]  another. So their whole objective there is to get rid of encryption or be able to be
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:23.360]  able to read into any encryption on the network anywhere, and that's what they're trying to
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:29.120]  use to justify it. But again, the real problem is their bulk acquisition of data. That's
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.400]  always been the problem, and it continues to be even internally in NSA and the various
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:40.440]  agencies they're telling them, we're overpowered by overload, and we're in analysis paralysis
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:43.160]  because we can't focus because of all the massive amounts of data.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.360]  Which is what the dark actors really want. This is the fog for what I would like in the
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:50.120]  specter of these global corporations to just take over.
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:54.720]  Yeah, that's right. And what it really does is it gives them all that power, having all
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:59.720]  that knowledge, then they now know how or who they have to deal with in their societies
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:05.960]  to be able to control the outcomes. That's really what I've been saying for several years
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:10.840]  is that their whole idea is population control, and in order to do that, you have to have
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:15.720]  knowledge about the population, and that's what this is giving them.
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:23.200]  What an amazing statement by you, the former technical director of the NSA that global
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:28.160]  intelligence agencies, I guess other than Russia, are merging right now, and Zuckerberg
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:32.440]  and others admit we're going with the Chinese model because they can beta test illegal stuff
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:37.560]  on a mass scale. Can you speak directly to China's systems of control, feeding all the
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:42.000]  data in, and saying, if you say something bad about the party, we're going to phase
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.080]  it in where you can't buy or sell? I mean, this is the ultimate nightmare in my view.
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:51.120]  Yeah, I think it's taking off a bit on the model that's already been built between, for
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:58.560]  example, the industry and the NSA, CIA, FBI, primarily. Those are the ones who were involved
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:01.960]  in setting it up internally in the US, and that's now the model they're going to try
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:06.280]  to export to China. I guess it sounds like they're going to be trying different things
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:10.360]  on top of that model to see if they can expand on it or improve it.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:16.800]  Basically a security clearance to live. A security clearance to even be able to function
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:22.480]  and have a job, even in the private sector. I mean, this is beyond Hitler's best dreams,
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:30.720]  isn't it, sir? Oh, it's well beyond Orwell's in 1984, too. I mean, it's just getting into
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:34.440]  not only the things that you're doing and who you're working with and who you do those
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:39.080]  things with, but also what you're thinking, and that's really where this is heading.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:44.200]  And then openly blackmailing you to submit and do everything you're told, or they will
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:48.480]  lower your social score so you can't operate in society and can't travel.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:52.680]  Yeah, and if they can't get to you, they'll get to somebody you care about, just like
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:55.320]  the KGB did. So it's no different than that.
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:58.960]  And they admit it's going to be a no-fly list just because your score is low. No judge,
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:03.400]  no jury, just a big algorithm, now you can't travel. And so many high-powered people I've
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:07.520]  talked to have been openly told now. This is coming here, you better get in line, and
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.960]  they're rolling over, Mr. Benny. Don't they know that will ensure that the Salatarian
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:17.040]  takeover? Well, I think that that's basically what they're all aiming for. I mean, that's
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:24.360]  really the underlying effort that they're aiming at. That's what they want to achieve.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:29.040]  Good God. Well, sir, I'm here just very emotional about this because I scan it every day. You're
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:32.760]  the true expert on it. You've got the floor the next 10 minutes. What's most important?
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:36.640]  What should people know with the highest level NSA whistleblower of all time here with us
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:45.920]  on here? The point is that everything coming out of the government is distorted in one
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:50.400]  form or another, not really coming and being honest with anybody in the public anymore.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.600]  You can't trust them at all. And you cannot, even the government inside the government,
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.880]  they can't even trust what the intelligence agencies are telling them or what their law
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:03.480]  enforcement agencies are telling them anymore. They're distorting what's being presented
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:08.520]  in the courts of law. I mean, they're destroying all our founding principles. And I've been
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:13.640]  basically on television saying that this is basically treason against the founding principles
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:20.720]  of this nation. And we as people have to stop and say, we're not going to tolerate this
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:26.760]  anymore. And if they can't, if they don't start subscribing to getting back to the
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:34.800]  principles of under under the constitution of personal rights by individuals, then then
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:40.440]  I think we need to fire everyone that's involved in that. And I would argue we need to fire
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:45.840]  everyone in DC right now, because they have no common sense about how things are proceeding.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:50.640]  I don't seem to understand the consequences of the things they're doing. I mean, it just
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:56.640]  seems that they're they believe for one reason or other. And I think it's because they're
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:02.240]  being bamboozled by the intelligence people that they have to do these things or else
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:08.560]  the sky is going to fall, right? When in fact, that's just an outright lie. And it's a distortion
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:12.920]  to try to manipulate people to do what they want. And they're falling for it. Well, sir,
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:16.960]  our politicians are falling for it. Sir, your record was impeccable. You know, you were
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:21.600]  holding a rank of a general at the NSA. They didn't they needed to not come in directly
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.160]  try to buy you off for threatening you because they knew you had such integrity. That's why
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:30.360]  you were there from a kind of an old guard system was more based on that. With people
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:34.800]  in Congress and the general public who are more modern and more decadent, they point
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:38.040]  blank either offer to buy them off for threaten them. I mean, I'm talking to more and more
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:42.800]  prominent people where I'm sure you saw last year when they legalized CIA propaganda domestically
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:50.040]  and quote the CIA and the Pentagon engaging in in in in social operations domestically,
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:55.680]  they're actually sending CIA you name it people into businesses, into companies, even at the
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:01.440]  mid level now, and basically either offering them stuff or threatening them to go along
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:04.680]  with this takeover. Sir, this is the equivalent. I'm sure you're familiar with how the Germans
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:11.720]  for five years quietly infiltrated France and got the top general staff to stand down.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:15.080]  The Blitzkrieg was a joke. It really didn't even fight the French. They fought the British
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:21.920]  Expeditionary Force, pushed them to Dunkirk. And I liken this to a infiltration operation
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:26.760]  where they've actually this foreign globalist coup, this corporate coup has already I know
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:29.720]  I said, I'm giving the floor and I'm jumping in here. I want you to comment on this has
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:33.960]  already come in and basically infiltrated and taken over. They just don't come and tell
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:37.400]  you something like that because they know how much integrity you have.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:43.240]  Yeah, it's getting back to the idea of, you know, how many people can you manipulate and
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:50.960]  coerce or force in one form or another by blackmail or any other means to do the things
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:57.960]  you want done? I mean, that's basically what's going on. And it seemed to, it just to me,
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:02.200]  I just can't envision my country ever going this route. I mean, I could never have thought
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:06.800]  that this would ever happen here. But it has, you know, you can't go around saying things
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:12.840]  like this cannot happen here. Like in the, in the 30s, when, when the Nazis took over,
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:17.280]  when the communists took over or whenever, you know, all these different power struggles
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:23.040]  have gone down through history. I mean, it can happen here. That's the whole point.
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:28.200]  And if we aren't vigilant, I mean, I keep saying democracy is not a spectator sport.
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:32.080]  You have to participate. You've got to get out there and keep the fight to keep it. I
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:37.920]  mean, this is something that people, people try to down through history, full of regimes
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:41.680]  that have tried to do this, just take the power away from the people and consolidate
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:47.280]  it and become the kind of dictator or death spot that controls everything. I mean, that's
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:52.960]  just really what's going on. This is our struggle. It has never changed down through history.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:58.240]  Absolutely. And sir, look at the fact that a lot of dictators were bad, but they just
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.440]  wanted to control everything. Some of them were egomaniacs and actually built big things,
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:06.440]  started universities, did some good. I mean, I'm not endorsing dictatorship, but this
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:12.920]  dictatorship of these social engineers is really anti-family, anti-human, anti-individual.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:18.480]  It's anti-renaissance. It's like, it's like a corporate Borg. It's so alien that just
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:24.320]  my very, very genetic code says resist this with everything you've got.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:29.600]  Yeah, it says, it basically says you will have no freedoms except those that we grant
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:38.160]  you. That's basically what their whole program is going to end up doing.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.560]  Unbelievable. Unbelievable. William Benny, former technical director of the National Security
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:52.240]  Agency is our guest. We'll take some calls coming up in the next segment, 800-259-9231-800-2599231.
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:57.680]  Looking at these bills, looking at the legislation, looking at the things that are being done,
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.680]  what is your overall view of the announcements that are being made, the things that are being
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:01.680]  engaged in?
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:05.640]  Well, I mean, some of the things they're trying to pass, like the FISBOT putting it
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:10.160]  into this big funding bill and burying it in there and passing it through is just another
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:17.280]  way of corrupting the process and getting it through under basically the cover of a
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:22.200]  massive bill. Those are the kinds of things they're sneaking through, and they're doing
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.960]  it by the leadership of our Congress is doing. Republicans and Democrats are all supporting
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:33.840]  this. They're no different, really. And they're doing it because they know they can't stand
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:39.160]  out in the open and say the things they want to say in a bill. So they've got to do it
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:45.000]  in some kind of under the cover or kind of in a sneaky way to get it through. And so
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.800]  that gives them, and then they say that authorizes them to power to do whatever they want to
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:56.000]  do, which in fact, I can test. None of that is constitutional. And any time it reaches
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.680]  in a constitutional test, it will fail.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.520]  And they were caught doing it all in secret and lying to the public and using it against
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:05.320]  political targets. It's all a fraud.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:12.560]  Exactly. Right. And they're afraid of having constitutional tests when, in fact, that is
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:16.600]  the true test of a law. Does it really conform to the Constitution or not? If it doesn't,
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.200]  it's not a law.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:21.960]  Well, clearly, if they can get away with this, they can get away with anything. I have been
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:26.200]  talking to a lot of big Hollywood people, a lot of big government people, and they are
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:31.080]  just terrified. They say, oh, I thought you were crazy about the NSA 15 years ago, Alex,
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:35.040]  but now it's all admitted. And I'm scared I'm not going to speak out. So that chilling
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:40.920]  effect is kind of working. Don't these people understand giving into the fear is what ensures
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:44.200]  that the real next phase of oppression comes in?
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:50.840]  Yeah, that's the whole point that I was making, too, by saying if you act, we ask in democracy,
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:57.440]  you'll lose it. So you've got to stand up and fight. That's what the people in democracy
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:02.440]  are supposed to do. You're supposed to stand up for your rights.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:06.320]  I know you never talked to colleagues at the NSA anymore because they'll try to indict
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:13.280]  you. I know they've been harassing a lot of your other colleagues and folks, but isn't
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.920]  there a sense of shame? I mean, I know there is, because look at all the leaks that they're
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:22.360]  having to fix intelligence, that they're funding Al Qaeda and ISIS. I mean, I am seeing a lot
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:27.160]  of good signs. What I mentioned earlier, and what Sy Hersh is reporting, that there's basically
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:32.960]  a soft counter coup inside the military going on against a lot of this stuff.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:39.840]  Yeah, I think you're right because there's some other whistleblowers like the four fellows
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:46.040]  who came out to blow the whistle on the droning and basically the random slaughter going on
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:51.680]  there. So there's that, too. Plus, I know internally, well, they're still so afraid
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:57.360]  of going into a court of law to be constitutionally challenged that it tells you that they're
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:02.440]  afraid of sunshine, shining the light on... It's like picking up a rock and watching.
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:06.000]  I draw the analogy, when you pick up a rock, you can see all the bugs and worms squirm
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:13.400]  to get out of the sunlight. Well, that's basically what our political leaders are doing now,
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:16.680]  and I'm not differentiating between any of the parties. They're all seem to be a part
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:23.000]  of it, so I just throw them all together. If anybody does this kind of support for things
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.320]  that are simply taking away our rights and assembling knowledge in the central government
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.800]  about the people in the country, I mean, that's fundamentally what our constitution was supposed
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.320]  to stop, and it was designed that way. The people were supposed to know what the government
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.520]  was doing. The government was not supposed to know what they were doing unless they
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:48.760]  had probable cause. Instead, they open the borders up, don't check anybody, but stick
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.360]  a magnifying glass down our throats. I mean, it really is the breaking of the will of the
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:58.120]  American people, and I just can't believe how many men I know that are scared now
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:02.040]  to know we have a tyrannical government. You know, the whole thing's not tyrannical,
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.720]  though. There are a lot of good people in the government and in the corporations that
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:08.800]  are trying to stop this. We all have to speak out and get involved now, and we can turn
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:11.280]  the tide against this, and you're doing that.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:16.160]  That's my point, yeah. I think the more people who stand up against this, the better chance
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:21.600]  we have of stopping it here initially, and then trying to initiate a stop around the
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:26.240]  world, because we started this infection, and it went through the British now, GCHQ,
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.480]  the Germans, the BND, and various other countries around the world.
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:32.480]  Let's talk about that national debate, sir. We've got a break. William Benning, exposefacts.org.
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:36.880]  I want to wish you a Merry Christmas as well, sir. What a super patriot we've got on the
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:41.880]  line. And also have a dinner with this guy. Unbelievable fourth, fifth, six-dimensional
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:45.840]  level thinking. You can tell why. He pretty much built the NSA that's there today, folks.
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:48.480]  He is the master.
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:59.160]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:04.720]  GOP presidential hopeful ran Paul as introduced legislation intended to block any effort by
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:10.120]  the incumbent president to enforce gun control by executive action. Paul's legislation, named
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:14.520]  the separation of powers, restoration, and Second Amendment Protection Act, would render
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:20.080]  any action on gun legislation by the president, which circumvents Congress as advisory only
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:25.040]  in nature. Paul's bill would apply to any executive action on gun control that either
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:29.760]  infringes upon congressional authority or potentially violates the Second Amendment.
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:35.000]  The bill then mandates that once an executive action has been classified as advisory only,
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  it would require Congress to pass it in order for it to take effect. The bill also outlines
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.880]  that it is within their power for a state official, member of Congress, or a person affected
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:50.200]  by an executive action on gun control to launch a civil lawsuit. The legislation will be fast
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:54.720]  tracked through the Senate and is expected to be made priority after the Christmas recess.

[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:25.080]  This is Alex Jones. Our whole modern world has been about coddling, making sure we never
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:39.120]  have experiences that make us empowered individuals. Pentagon ran major scyop operation. This summer,
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:46.040]  Jade Helm. Day one, we said it wasn't a military takeover or gun confiscation. We said it was
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:50.240]  a conditioning operation for troops on the streets of America for civil unrest and to
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:57.840]  also practice in the United States but also overseas using databases of information to
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:03.800]  roll in and out of cities undetected and to master the human domain. And the commanding
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:09.240]  general of it gave a slideshow that we played parts of admitting it's about mastering the
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:19.000]  human domain and controlling the population. I then ran into some special forces people.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.640]  One of them very well known but I'm not going to say his name. He'll probably end up being
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:27.120]  on the show. And they said, look, we all saw right through that and the scyop they ran
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:31.120]  saying that this was this weekend saying that you said we were coming to take over. Believe
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:41.400]  me, Alex, no one in SF Army, Marines, Navy, no one buys any of it. And we know that's
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:45.280]  why they're rolling out with autonomous drones, robots, all of it. We get it. We know you're
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:51.280]  dead on. So again, I'm not lionizing the military. I've always been critical of it being used
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.280]  and just worshiped mindlessly, you know, where the military's paying for them to, you know,
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:59.280]  have patriotic stuff at the Super Bowl. That's to sell the state as if it's the military
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:07.160]  was stolen glory. But they've got a big problem in that the boots on the ground, right up
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:11.600]  to the generals, they're trying to put all these weird pencil pushers in and all these
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:18.360]  weird politicos who've never even been involved in combat. They're putting, you know, guys
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:24.720]  that are political hacks in especially under Obama. That it really endangers us against
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:29.600]  foreign governments, the delusion of the Hillary Clinton, the Obama's, the neocons, none of
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:36.120]  them have been in the military to go start these wars with Russia. I mean, it's not just
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:40.680]  what William Minney was about to get into, former technical director of the NSA with
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:46.240]  the situation with all these different governments and all the different systems spying and there's
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:53.360]  too much data. So it makes everybody blind. It's beyond that. It's that they're starting
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:36:00.320]  wars with Russia. They're starting wars in Syria. They're doing unprecedented bad stuff.
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:05.600]  And even our top generals go, it's immoral. Why overthrow a country and have al-Qaeda
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:11.800]  come in? That's what ISIS is and murder the Christians. I mean, it's just so nasty. And
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:16.680]  it's not even Machiavelli because it doesn't bring down Iran, their regime. It actually
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:24.000]  makes them look moral. I mean, it's hubris, it's arrogance, but you could also look at
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.760]  it like they're globalists running this. They want to discredit America. William Minney,
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:32.840]  I want you to get back to the points that you got cut off at the break on, but separately,
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:37.960]  being at the highest levels of the NSA, I know there's a method to some of the madness,
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:41.640]  clearly they're running things, but also there's a lot of hubris and arrogance. And it really
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:47.600]  is scary to see a bunch of chicken hawks playing God. And Hillary saying she came to Libya,
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:52.280]  she saw Gaddafi died when the woman couldn't fight her way out of a wet paper bag. There's
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:59.840]  something obscene about a lazy politico shooting her mouth off about killing people. It just
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:05.080]  reeks of classic, classic flaming megalomania, sir.
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:11.360]  Yes. And in fact, I've been amazed at the arrogance of the intelligence community, even
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:16.800]  to our own government. I mean, they just seem to have them all wrapped around their finger,
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:22.720]  much like J. Edgar Hoover did with most of the politicians in the House and Senate and
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:29.200]  the White House back when he was the director of the FBI for, you know, 40 years or so.
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:35.000]  So, I mean, he had information and knowledge about them. And if they didn't know that
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:40.240]  he did, they believed he did. So that's how he kept his power. And this is going, getting
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:46.320]  very similar to that, but on a much larger scale. And I would point out that what's happening
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:54.040]  now is what we impeached and indicted Richard Nixon for only he was only doing a minor minuscule
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:56.680]  amount compared to what they're doing now.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:04.720]  Yes, sir. Don't the elites know that historically every time bringing in an oppression, a tyranny,
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:08.880]  a Panopticon system like this will always end up destroying them that they're going to be
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:14.760]  the number one targets of what they've created. They've dug a pit for us. Won't they be the
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:16.680]  ones that fall into it historically?
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:23.080]  Well, I think if it gets really violent, like in World War II and so on, yes, they would
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:26.720]  be the ones to pay for it. But essentially, I think they're banking on the fact that this
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:31.440]  will be a long drawn out thing. And so they'll be able to pass it on to their successors
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:36.560]  and that they won't have to pay anything directly for it. So in other words, they'll be able
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:41.360]  to get by through their lifetime without having suffered any consequences, but their successors
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:44.040]  will be the ones to suffer that.
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:47.400]  And by then, they believe technology will outrace that and they'll be secure or they'll
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:50.480]  dump the public down enough to do it. You're absolutely right. They are building a lot
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:55.880]  of redoubts, though, in different circuitous areas around the world right now hedging their
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:56.880]  bets.
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:04.440]  Yes. And, you know, I personally like to get right in their face because they shrink away
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:08.440]  every time. It's a matter of, you know, again, it's the idea of sunlight. They're afraid
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:13.440]  of sunlight because then they will be the ones to suffer the consequences and the results
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:16.440]  of what they've done.
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.960]  That's what they're trying to avoid.
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:22.440]  Like Carl Rove said, they control reality. No, they don't. They just avoid reality. It's
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:27.080]  called being delusional. William Benny, incredible to have you here. Other technical things people
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:31.000]  need to know about what's happening in the world right now, sir.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:40.520]  Well, it's basically the... I think the greatest threat is to allow companies to continue to
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:44.200]  manage and have this kind of information about people because then they have the ability,
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:48.600]  like we were talking about China, then they have the ability to go to China and see and
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:53.720]  then influence them in a way that would be very similar of accumulating information on
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:59.400]  individual citizens, I mean, in their countries. So the companies, then they're international
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:05.160]  companies. So this is getting spread internationally accelerated through that process. And I think
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:09.640]  that's probably one of the major things that we really should be dealing with here in this
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:15.080]  country and in Europe. I know the Europeans are trying to deal with it now and I'm trying
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:21.160]  to give my two cents and contributions to them and hopefully they'll start a worldwide
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:26.520]  effort that might be able to turn this around.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:31.640]  But I think holding companies are responsible for the information they're holding is... And
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:36.440]  in fact, probably even denying them the legal right to hold that data might be the best option
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:37.440]  eventually.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:42.640]  Well, if folks... And of course, when I have you on, sir, you're so influential, you have
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.080]  so much courage. I mean, it's just true. I don't normally gux like this with guests unless
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:49.960]  they deserve it. You're out there doing so many interviews. I've gone through so much
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:54.240]  to warn people. I try to mount stuff off of you, obviously, to see if you think it's
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:58.760]  accurate from my perspective. And it is even more frightening that pretty much always you
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:04.400]  concur with my basic analysis of it, just as a layperson looking at the larger geopolitical
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:09.640]  and cultural ramifications. But we know why they're trying to ban white Christmas and
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:14.280]  brown paper bags and saying, if you serve Chinese food at a school lunch program, it's
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:18.680]  racist. They're projecting all these things that don't exist that aren't really racist
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:23.520]  or discriminatory because we're all being discriminated against by this new technocratic
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:28.280]  system being set up, where if you're not a good little new world order person, you won't
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:34.000]  be able to have a job or live or get a hotel room or travel. They're announcing all this.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.520]  This is classical discrimination and oppression. And so they want us to define all these phantom
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:47.040]  menaces now while the greatest acts of institutionalized tyranny the world's ever seen are being
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:53.800]  codified into a physical surveillance grid that, as you said, is beyond any fantastical
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:55.600]  dream of George Arwell.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:02.240]  Yeah. So I just liken this to the case of the Wizard of Oz. This is the scenario. Their
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:07.200]  painting is basically pay no attention to the man behind the curtain when in fact the
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:12.120]  man behind the curtain is them and they're doing some very bad things.
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:18.560]  Well, I think it's very important for the establishment to realize, let me ask you this
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:25.360]  being up there at the highest levels. I know that the people at the mid-level and even
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:30.160]  high-level that are patriots, I mean, I actually abashed the government a lot. They've called
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:34.120]  me anti-government because I'm a libertarian. I'm not, but I've actually been impressed
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:37.680]  as I've gotten a higher level, gotten to really know a lot of influential people across the
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:45.280]  board that I find in government, actually, more moral people, more awake people, more
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:49.320]  concerned people, especially when you get higher up. It's very strange. Not at the very
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:53.520]  top, but that next to the top. They're the ones that are freaked out and want to do something.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:56.640]  They got into this to really defend the country. I mean, somebody like you could have made,
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:59.840]  you know, $10 million a year with your science and mathematics, but you would, you know, take
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:06.000]  a pay cut and work at the NSA. So it's kind of a paradox that government's got so many
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.280]  problems, but then the corporations are just as bad, and then we tend to just either see
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:16.200]  it as good or bad. Are you for the government or against the government? It's more sophisticated
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.200]  than that.
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:24.000]  Yeah, it's not the black or white, for sure. And it's a matter of, you know, whether or
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:30.320]  not you agree with the underlying principles of why we formed this nation and got rid of
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:37.320]  George III or you don't. And the point is, more and more, people over time, I guess,
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:44.000]  were becoming so comfortable in our living standard that we're losing what it took to
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.920]  get here. You know, we're failing to realize that in order to have all these freedoms,
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:55.760]  we had to work very hard and sacrifice a lot to get here. And that's what the, you know,
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:00.160]  people who fought World War II have told Tom Drake when he did interviews with them. They
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:05.160]  were saying things like, what did we fight for? You know, take, given the current circumstance
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:11.320]  of where we're headed. I mean, we're not, we didn't fight for an omnipresent, you know,
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:16.160]  government to monitoring everything the country, the people in the country are doing. That's
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:20.840]  not, that's not freedom. And they were asking him and those questions, even when he was
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:26.960]  doing interviews for the, for the National Archives as a part of his court settlement.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:33.680]  Amazing. So I mean, it's really, I mean, that's really, that's really a disturbing statement
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:44.400]  from, from veterans of World War II. Well, my grandfather, he was deeply concerned because
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:47.800]  living here in Texas, they brought a lot of the rat line Nazis to Texas and New Mexico
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:51.720]  and in the areas where he worked, he would have to run into them all the time. And he
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:54.880]  was always pretty calm when I was a little kid, stand there for a week or so in the summer,
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:59.640]  but he would rant about all the damn Nazis. And he had a lot of friends obviously killed
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:04.320]  them World War II and all the positions in government they were in, and that he was concerned
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:07.720]  that we were going to go that way. And, you know, my mom would say, oh, you're, you know,
[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:12.120]  my dad's eccentric. And my dad would say, no, no, he's smart. But, you know, I just,
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:15.440]  I don't know what he would think saying this today, William Benning.
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:25.920]  Yeah, I don't, yeah, I understand what you're saying. My dog's getting a little upset here.
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:29.200]  I understand you want to let the dog out, sir? And then we can. No, no, no, I'm fine.
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:33.880]  He's okay. He just wanted to be petted. That's all. What kind of dog is he?
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:38.720]  German Shepherd. He's a pretty big boy. He's about 125, 30 pounds, something like that.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:41.760]  He's a big boy. Well, I'm glad he survived the SWAT team,
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:47.000]  right? Yeah. Well, he wasn't here at the time. That was good, you know? Otherwise,
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.800]  you don't know what they would have done. When you looked at this federal SWAT team
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:55.200]  that came in on you, I know they had probably their faces covered. Were they proud of themselves
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:58.840]  while they were throwing your house around and grabbing on you out of the shower?
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:06.560]  No, I think they were a bit, it seemed to me that most of them seemed a bit disturbed
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.920]  as to why they were there. That's good. That's what I've been finding.
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:16.240]  Yeah. And that's basically most of them, the only one who wasn't there, who wasn't disturbed
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:23.080]  was the guy who signed the warrant, the senior special agent, Paul Marek. He was already
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:28.240]  cleared into the program and he knew why he was there. He was there to get us, to get
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:33.440]  basically keep the cover up going on the programs that they were running that we knew about
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:38.640]  and that we were complaining to Congress about. So he knew that and the rest of them didn't.
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:43.720]  So yeah, how dare you go to Congress as you're supposed to do by law when the law is being
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:48.680]  broken and secretly testify? How horrible. Let's send a, I mean, imagine that guy getting
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:54.280]  promotions because he would engage in things like this. What a dishonorable person.
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:47:00.880]  Yes. That's, you know, that's hard for me to imagine people like that looking themselves
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:04.280]  in the mirror when they're shaving in the morning.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:07.000]  I want to go to some phone calls. I'm not going to play the club because of time, but
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.400]  Apple's Tim Cook, their CEO, has come out on 60 Minutes and said they don't want to
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:15.720]  go along with these different bills, that it's an invasion of privacy. You notice I
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:20.720]  don't want to glorify Steve Jobs, but he held off on letting them in to the Apple encryption
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:25.440]  and one week after he died, Apple gave up the codes. Do you think that's lip service
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:29.000]  by Apple for customers or do you think it's real?
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:36.360]  I think for Steve Jobs, it was probably real for sure. But for the rest of them, I think
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:40.160]  Steve, the problem is they also, they also get paid for all this information in this
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:45.760]  access. So it adds to their bottom line with no additional effort on basically on their
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:46.760]  part.
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:51.520]  Well, that's another question. Why put up NSA and FBI stingrays, tens of thousands
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:55.160]  of them, stealing all the cell phone data when it already runs through all the hubs
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:58.600]  and they can just have it sorted there and then bulk batch it is because they don't want
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:02.320]  a record that it was grabbed off the hubs. What is the point of that?
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:07.840]  Well, that's part of it. The other part is that it adds to a greater program that they're
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:12.200]  putting together, which is called Treasure Map. That's the one where they're going to
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:15.880]  be monitoring where you are every minute of the day.
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:17.280]  So it's a physical tracker.
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:22.560]  Yeah. It's a contributor to that. It's another aspect of it that they may pick up missing
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:25.440]  information that they didn't get from other sources, you know.
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:30.200]  Sure. Interlapping fields of fire. In fact, that's what I was told by some insiders that
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:35.000]  are pretty high up, is that they also might want to bring in an internet kill switch during
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.840]  a civil emergency or martial law and they're putting in an alternate government internet
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:39.840]  right now.
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:44.800]  I think they've pretty much already had that all along.
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:45.800]  Yes.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:49.840]  But they're going operational to command and control the local police.
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:53.080]  Yeah. That's another disturbing part, you know.
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:57.560]  Good God. You could just take over. Hillary said, I want it to be a Manhattan project
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:01.760]  to protect us from terrorists on the internet. I've always called it a giant secret Manhattan
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:05.640]  project takeover. And now she's calling it that, sir.
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:06.640]  Yeah.
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:12.600]  Well, I think that's fundamentally what it is. We're becoming a very effective police
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:19.080]  state, much more than any other totalitarian state or system has ever developed.
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:24.800]  Absolutely. Let's talk to Brandon in FEMA Region 3. I've got about a minute and a half
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:27.800]  to break. Oh, that was your question, Brandon, for William Benny.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:36.280]  Hey, I wanted to get Mr. Benny's opinion on the FBI, NSA, and even the CIA coming out
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:41.000]  and saying that they're capping people's phones without warrant and that it's to protect
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.760]  us. But if, but I actually know a cop who did it and had a warrant and he was later
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:51.040]  indicted and thrown under the passport. But if the fed, if the feds do it, it's perfectly
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:54.040]  okay. Can you maybe get into that and break down?
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:58.840]  Yeah, what about the hypocrisy of a parallel construction, the rest of it? But if a local
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:01.960]  gets caught doing it, it's federal or state prison time.
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:07.920]  Well, you know, it's the it's the it's the arrogance of the intelligence. I mean, NSA,
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:14.520]  CIA, FBI are really at the core of this, just like they were at the core of the, the material
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:20.040]  that was used to indict, to impeach and indict Richard Nixon. These are the these are the
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:26.880]  main players in the central collection and acquisition and use of material, like all
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:32.480]  the emails, phone calls, financial transactions and so on, that are being collected primarily
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:37.320]  by NSA. They're becoming basically the central repository and processor for all this information.
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:43.840]  So, but they've all been in it together from the beginning. That goes back even to shortly
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:48.600]  after World War II, when CIA and FBI or NSA were created.
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:51.680]  Thank you, Brandon. William Benny, stay there, sir. Come back and finish that comment. We'll
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:55.880]  take more calls. Websites, exposefacts.org folks, don't take an interview like this for
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:59.080]  granted. Spread this to everybody you know.

[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:32.160]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year. Just this past August
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:36.560]  was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River. I loved my dad. But boy was he stubborn.
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:41.720]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years. His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:46.720]  He wasn't a rich man by any means. At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would
[01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:52.120]  have been the perfect alternative for my father. Don't wait. Go to LibertyOnCall.org right
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:54:03.120]  now for not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones. Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:08.640]  Welcome back, folks. Alex Jones here, live. Mr. Benny will be with us five minutes the
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:12.080]  next hour. I'm going to cover news and continue with your phone calls. Special reports as
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:21.960]  well. Folks, we know all the stuff that's happening is illegal. We know it's been used
[01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:26.360]  everywhere else to oppress people. There is a global race for surveillance of all these
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:31.160]  different countries and companies. They've broken all the rules. They've set up an economy
[01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:36.280]  based on gaming things, based on manipulation now, the stock markets, the interest rates.
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:41.680]  It's all fake. And it's ended the free market. It's ending capitalism. And then they're
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:47.280]  blaming capitalism for the standard of living beginning to slide. No, this is like a rigged
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:57.320]  casino. Casino is not capitalist. It's a con game. And the elites have no bottom now, it
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:02.960]  seems. They'll do anything. Because after all, Karl Rove said they control reality. Hitler
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:08.120]  and Napoleon thought that too. William Benning, former NSA technical director is our guest.
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:15.040]  We're taking phone calls for him right now. Let's go ahead and talk to Jeremy in Kansas.
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:19.000]  Oh, no, I'm sorry. Mr. Benny got caught off by the break. What was the point you were
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  making, sir?
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:25.200]  Well, it was just that they're so arrogant now about even violating all the fundamental
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:31.400]  principles of our country that they think they can get away with anything. So, I mean,
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:35.320]  they don't seem to be afraid of anything when in fact, I think that's when we need to start
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:39.680]  standing up and making it clear that we're going to come after them for what they're
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:40.680]  doing.
[01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:44.920]  That's right. They want to normalize all their activities. Jeremy in Kansas, go ahead.
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:51.080]  Yes, amen to the theme of today's show, which is about moral courage, even or especially
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:56.840]  when it's scary and unpopular. So, I want to ask a question about our necessary political
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:56:04.480]  strategy to restore and rejuvenate our inherent natural rights by asserting that the precursor
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:09.520]  to moral courage is intellectual courage or epistemological courage and that the way that
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:16.200]  we're going to overcome the falsified left-right paradigm and overcome the perception managers
[01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:21.200]  is by going to the heart of what is actually being used against us, which is terrorism,
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:27.400]  state-sponsored terrorism. And we see the manifestation of this after September 11th
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:28.400]  rolling out in Paris.
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:31.720]  Sure. Let me get William Benny's take on that as we get to other collars, but it's a good
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:36.280]  point. They're opening the borders. They're letting terrorists in bare minimum. They are
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:40.600]  stand-downs on 9-11. They are not letting the NSA do its job against real terrorists
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:45.000]  that's constitutionally protected. I mean, it's so obvious they're letting the terrorism
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.280]  take place to take our rights. How do we shatter that paradigm? It seems like we are, as it
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:51.480]  comes out, the government's running ISIS.
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:57.320]  Well, yeah, I think that exposure is certainly the key. I think that's the sunlight part
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:01.720]  of it. But that collars, that's absolutely right. I mean, what they're doing is they're
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:06.000]  using, first of all, they say they have to do bulk acquisition that buries their analysts.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.680]  They can't figure anything out. They can't focus. So, that means that more terrorist
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:15.160]  attack occurs. And every time one does, they go into their data and they find out, oh, yeah,
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:19.640]  we knew about these fellows, but they didn't do anything before to stop it, you see. So,
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:25.160]  they use now that terrorist attack to add lobby for more money, more control, more information,
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:30.280]  more knowledge, for example. I would point to the French in their example, their experience,
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:38.560]  too. I mean, the previous, earlier this year, the attack in Paris, that sponsored the acquisition
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:44.240]  of more money, more knowledge, more information, more analysts and so on, for the French, but
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:49.040]  it didn't do them any good, even though they had this bulk acquisition system there again.
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:53.320]  Because again, their people could not focus. And then another Paris attack occurs, you know.
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:59.960]  And so, now they're starting to do, this time, it looks like they've changed their approach.
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:04.600]  And they're focusing on what they know about people and using that. And that's a focus
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:09.800]  that disciplines the attack. They're profiling. Yeah, they're doing basically, they're looking
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:15.360]  at the behavior, which is a profile, right, of people who do bad things. And they've got
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:19.040]  all that information already. It's just that they aren't acting on it until after the
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:21.960]  attack. Absolutely. Stay there when we come back for a final segment, sir. We're honored
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:26.760]  for your time. I want to take it to the next level, though. The good people in government
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:31.040]  can't do anything because of the fog of all the data, but the bad ones behind the scenes,
[01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:36.360]  they sent the feds down to stop the FBI from stopping the San Bernardino shooters two years
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:42.320]  ago. So there's even more there. They're actually protecting them at one level. It's even worse.

[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:35.640]  Haggard. So the story ends, we're told.
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:51.080]  William Benning is with us for this final segment. Our government's breaking all the
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:58.560]  rules. Every time governments do this, hell on earth comes. Mr. Benning, I want to take
[02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:02.880]  a call or two in closing, have you had any other points, but knowing history like you
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:09.680]  do, being able to run so many major operations successfully, you know, shutting down terrorists,
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:15.240]  you name it, defeating the Soviets, what you I know are a big part of. You don't toot your
[02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:23.320]  horn about that. But watching all these little men and women play, play warrior when they
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:32.160]  are just egomaniacs, I really fear for the future of the planet with people like this
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:36.800]  running things. And I don't know how the other elites, though I know, aren't perfect, but
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:44.160]  I don't know why they want to let something so dangerous get into place.
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:51.000]  Yeah, I certainly agree with that. I mean, I was on Reddit when I was in Copenhagen,
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:55.400]  and one of the questions they'd asked me was, what is the greatest threat to the people
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:02:01.480]  of the public in the United States? And I said, well, it's the U.S. government. And
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:04.960]  the reason I said that is that, you know, any number of things that have happened, we've
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:10.960]  gotten into wars that are not justified, and people die. We have maimed, you know, the
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:15.720]  part that gets me is that the veterans who are forced to go over and in the military
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:20.440]  and go over and fight these wars and either die or come back maimed and so on are now
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:24.800]  mistreated when they get back here. And that's really, that's really criminal. And it's
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:30.080]  like the arrogance of those in the positions of power throwing them out there, they don't
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:34.480]  pay for any of this. They don't have any consequences. It's all the people who are ordered to do
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:41.320]  things by them. They're the ones who suffer. And that's the part about the, you know, democracy
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:45.840]  is supposed to, that's why our founders, I think, set it up the way they did to try
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:51.840]  to have knowledge about the government and what it was doing on our behalf and with some
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:56.040]  reasonable sense of truth, which is not, we've not been getting truth here.
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:03:00.560]  Well, there was goodwill out of our fellow bearers. They wanted a new renaissance. They
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:04.760]  believed in humanity. They were fans of humanity. And the people we have running things are
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:11.000]  just fans of fraud and gangs. And the good news is history shows, as you know, sir, that
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:16.160]  when you show the wind, you reap the whirlwind. And I know a lot of globalists want to cause
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:21.160]  a civil war in America, a soft civil war where they can go after all the patriots. They are
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:25.480]  so stupid. I mean, that actually happens with the military and the police as awake as they
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:29.640]  are. It doesn't matter what narrative they put out, Soros trying to have this war on
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:33.040]  police and all the rest of it. It's just going to blow up in their face. I think we're going
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:37.960]  to find that the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray. What do you have to say
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:38.960]  about that?
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:42.520]  No, I think you're absolutely right because there are too many good, decent people in
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:47.160]  this country who are so patriotic and concerned about these issues. They're not going to be
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:51.720]  able to push this through. I just believe that that, I believe that that's the case.
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:56.520]  I really do because I've met so many people in this country who are really feeling that
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:00.680]  our government is not doing the same thing. Even some of the polling, they say our country
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:05.040]  is going the wrong direction. Well, it's because these people, police, fraudulent things, and
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:11.840]  we know what they're doing. We know they're corrupt in D.C. And so it's all a matter of
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:17.520]  resisting this and how you do that. And my ways to stand up there and speak all this,
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:21.880]  try to accuse them of the things that they've been doing, like treason against the founding
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:27.680]  principles of this nation and so on, and doing it on public radio here with your show and
[02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:32.000]  also on television and so on. That's my way of doing it. Others can choose their own way,
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.560]  whichever way they feel comfortable with. But my point is you have to stand up to defend
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:39.280]  democracy or we're all going to lose it.
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:43.280]  Well, we are losing our republic right in front of our eyes. Have a great Christmas
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:48.200]  serve, exposefacts.org. Thank you so much for standing up for my family and everybody
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:53.160]  else's. Thank you, William Benning. Well, thank you for having me. Amazing individual. I
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:56.880]  wonder if it freaks the globalist out to have the guy that ran the NSA against the Soviets
[02:04:56.880 --> 02:04:59.800]  now fighting them.
[02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:05.120]  The website The Daily Beast has accused InfoWars of putting on a mock mass shooting that we
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:10.880]  had nothing to do with. Their article is titled, Conspiracy Theorists Terrorized Our Town,
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:16.400]  in which they write, InfoWars worst humans invaded Texas to stage a mass shooting. We
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:22.160]  counter-protested, being the author and his friends, outnumbering them 20 to 1. They still
[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:28.040]  don't believe that Sandy Hook ever happened. As far as the Sandy Hook accusation, we discussed
[02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:33.600]  that in great detail on the December 21st, 2015 edition of the Alex Jones Show, so I'll
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:35.680]  focus on the rest of the article.
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:40.840]  The author, who took great pride in making fart noises like a 7-year-old child, went on
[02:05:40.840 --> 02:05:45.440]  to accuse us of stringing the media along and then hosting the event in an area with
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:50.740]  no cameras. Once again, we did report on the event like dozens of other news agencies,
[02:05:50.740 --> 02:06:06.120]  but we had nothing to do with it. You can find more reports on InfoWars.com and it's
[02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:07.400]  that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical
[02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:12.640]  formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus. All of our children are
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:18.120]  hit with modern mind control, television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:22.520]  Children's humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily
[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:27.400]  by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put
[02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:29.560]  on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:33.760]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:37.600]  that children would actually like and take. We worked with the leading manufacturer in
[02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:41.400]  nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and

[02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:27.800]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:33.880]  I think about Patrick Henry's famous, give me liberty or give me death speech. He says
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:38.000]  the cowards, okay, forget that you are our countryman. Crouch down and lick the hand
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:46.040]  that feeds you. May your chains set lightly upon you. But for those of us that know what's
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:49.360]  going on and happening, the war has already begun in the north. You can already hear the
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:55.440]  clash of arms. Men may cry peace, peace, but there is no peace. The next gale from the
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:09:03.400]  north will bring war. I don't know what course others are going to take. But as for me, give
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:16.040]  me liberty or give me death. It's not even a question. I was just thinking about Donald
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:27.320]  Trump during the break. He's made some big mistakes. He is super confident. His body
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:33.440]  language is he's not on a power trip. It's just that he doesn't like what's going on
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:40.240]  in this country. He doesn't like the country being deliberately shut down. He's bought
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:46.360]  into the American dream and he's pissed. And I think about him trying to tax the big tax
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:51.960]  exempt brokerage firms and make them bring their money back in the U.S. Huge. Defending
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:55.440]  the Second Amendment, defending our borders, saying don't let Muslims come in until they
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:59.440]  screen who's coming in to make sure they're not a terrorist. That's all he's saying.
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:03.840]  The outrageous move is leaving the border open and not even screening people and then
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:12.160]  letting the refugees just disappear. But it's this war against reality. And then the biggest
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:18.720]  thing he does that makes the system hate him is he says, I want to turn our power plants
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:25.040]  back on. I want to have lower taxes to bring the jobs back here. I want to make it where
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:30.440]  companies can't bring their companies offshore and get tax exemption. Absolutely. That's
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:37.040]  a no brainer. Look at how we got screwed over deliberately. The globalists are shutting
[02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:46.320]  our country down. They're bankrupting us. And Donald Trump is saying all the right things
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:55.760]  when it comes to that. And I know, I mean, it's not even hidden what's going on behind
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:11:00.480]  the scenes with Trump, but the mainstream media is not picked up on it. And I don't
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:06.600]  even know if I want to get into it here on air. And then the NSA is, they don't just
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:13.960]  have computers listening to me, folks. They got whole teams on me. And I see it as a badge
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:21.000]  of honor. I love it. I mean, I take it seriously. I don't I don't laugh at it. But it's just
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.880]  you know, that's what I came to do with stand up against these people. And this is a good
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:29.440]  sign. And they put their people in the field against me. That's good. Let me tell you,
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:36.560]  I run into their people on the street and they are embarrassed. So the globalists should
[02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:44.760]  know that the people you're sending, they don't like their job. They don't like what
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:50.120]  they're doing. You may have some mentally ill informants and people some wind up toys
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:59.520]  you got out there and they'll be dealt with. I mean, you don't think they're going to run
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:02.600]  federal operations against us that are controlled by the globalists. I'm not going to have other
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:07.960]  people on the inside blow your operations wide open. I don't have to do a thing. There's
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:12.240]  no conspiracy here. No racketeering here. I don't even know what's going on outside
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:17.480]  the sphere of my life and the analysis I do. But I'm not stupid enough to not understand
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:25.520]  that I wouldn't be here if I wasn't being protected. I got pulled over speeding the
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:31.400]  other day by an Austin cop. He didn't give me a ticket. And he said, he said, Alex, I
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:34.080]  listen to your show all the time. You can drive a little bit safer, but you're going
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:38.400]  to pick your kids up to school. He asked me where I was going. I said, you can go. You're
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:42.720]  not too fast over speed limit. And he said, but you know, I remember your protest and
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:47.080]  stuff 20 years ago and you'd get in our faces and stuff. You know, why did you change your
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:50.520]  attitude towards us? And I said, listen, I just knew the globalists were taking over
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:56.120]  the police, the military and was threatened by it historically knowing. And so I was
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:13:00.760]  just trying to be aggressive to get the police to wake up. But now I found since this takeover
[02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:04.200]  is happening, the police and military are resisting it more than the public. And so
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:11.560]  I admire that you sit there nodding his head. The cop even got a tear in his eye. Motorcycle
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:19.160]  cop. Because he loves this country. And I said, and one more thing. The last time Arde
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:21.760]  Savetta was here a couple of years ago, I haven't asked him to come on. We should call
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:30.680]  and get him back on. Interesting police chief Cuban refugee like Ted Cruz. And he said,
[02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:34.360]  man, you know, they sent somebody came here to kill you. He goes, you don't know about
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:41.840]  that. And I said, no. And he goes, we got to look into it. And he goes, but you know,
[02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:45.360]  we had people on that and we stopped them and took them in, but then they had to be
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:50.360]  released. But I can't get into it because of court stuff. And then I got sent this whole
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:59.480]  file and call by a detective at LA where this guy came here and went to all my known last
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:04.240]  locations and was staked out to kill me. And because you can argue all this NSA stuff,
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:07.840]  that was their argument. Well, we were following their social networks and stuff. They came
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:11.080]  and they stopped them. That's the other side of this. But it wasn't illegal stuff. They
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:15.360]  were looking at public stuff. They stopped them. And then they were going to basically
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:21.800]  indict the guy in California. They sent state police and he killed one of them. And they
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:29.400]  killed him. But I mean, literally a police officer was killed in California trying to
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:37.760]  protect me. And there's some type of primitive level you get to where you, not the police
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:43.480]  in general or any of it, but when you, when people do that, even though it's their job
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:15:01.640]  to do it, still you just can't piss on it. And it goes beyond that. I just wish the general
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:05.760]  public knew and understood how much danger they were in. And I guess a lot of people
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:13.720]  I'm finding tune into the show now. And they thought I was a cook 20 years ago or 10 years
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:19.920]  ago. And now I just scare the daylights out of people. Listen, if you've got, as I've
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:26.640]  said a thousand times, black widows in your basement and you say, look out when you're
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:32.080]  down there cleaning that out to say a electrician or whatever, there's a lot of spiders down
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:36.320]  there. It's not fear mongering. There are black widows down there. I remember my dad
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:44.480]  when I was working one summer doing some exterminator work when I was like 13 years old. Why let
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:49.840]  me do that? Well, I'm sure that wasn't good for me. Going underneath houses for those
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:55.560]  bugs, ones that eat the wood, the termites. And he said, okay, he's Texas has got a lot
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:58.840]  of black widows. So any old boxes or anything in there, they're going to be in there just
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:02.800]  in everything. I mean, spiders, it'll kill you. And it's the same deal, folks. I'm just
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:07.680]  saying, man, we got spiders all over the place. Okay. And that's not fear mongering. It's
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:18.160]  good to know they're there. That's positive. And I always thought the global should only
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:22.080]  run America down so much. I always thought they'd still use us as the core of the empire.
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:27.080]  No, they want to mount our head on the wall. They want to overthrow every local government,
[02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:31.120]  every government state government, they're going to put in literal UN Justice Department
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:37.640]  bodies. They're building from LA to New York to DC to you name it, new UN buildings that
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:43.520]  quote monitor media and the police. I mean, and I told Dr. Paul Robert said he goes, all
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:47.480]  the UN is not taking over and I'm going to wait a minute. It's not the UN. It's the globalist
[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:54.640]  building parallel new government systems and giving them power. It's happening. And then
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.960]  I've analyzed it and the only thing I've been wrong about is they really do plan on bringing
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:07.440]  this country down. And they really do plan on turning every police department basically
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:15.080]  into a politically correct communist operation. I mean, good God. So that's why I can walk
[02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:19.600]  through my control room and see every new channel showing the handful of out of control
[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:26.440]  police to project it onto the rest of police to make the whole revolution. Congress with
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:31.320]  9% approval rating all of it about them and the feds will come in and overthrow them and
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:35.400]  take over. And I know I keep repeating that because that's the emergency beacon. That's
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:38.880]  one of the clearest areas. You can see the attack profile. They did the same thing in
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:43.000]  Ukraine. They ran all these TV shows run by the West about the police being bad, the government
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:47.920]  being bad over through the elected government took it over and started a war. I mean, they're
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:54.120]  running an exact operation against us. So I'm against the spying. I'm against illegal
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:59.600]  checkpoints. I'm against, you know, crazy cops on power trips. Absolutely. We do reports
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:08.200]  on them, but I'm not stupid enough to then just roll in to George Soros's operation.
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:14.220]  And I'm going to tell the police and military something. I hear the late great Jack McClam
[02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:17.400]  say that the new old order will come to your door in a uniform, whether it's good or bad.
[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:24.680]  We need to target the police. But it's so true. We need to target them with the truth
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:30.480]  because they've never been more ready to listen to military. I mean, it's scary how
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:38.800]  awake they are. That's not really a job to do anymore. The police are accelerating their
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:48.040]  awakening. The globalists are scared. I'm going to skip this network break. And we are
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:55.240]  just in the middle of an epic battle right now. It's so epic now that I can't even stop
[02:18:55.240 --> 02:19:01.720]  working. I just, I just work all the time. I've never been a big drinker in my life.
[02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:07.440]  But I mean, some of those got a home to drink a six pack just to forget about all this stuff.
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:11.480]  Because I just cannot turn it off, folks. I dream about this stuff. I live it always.
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:15.360]  I know it's real. It's all out in the open. And man, these people that are taken over
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:23.000]  are really bad. I mean, it's like being, it's like I'm chained up in the back of a van being
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.240]  driven around with perverts driving it. And I've got to watch them learn little kids in
[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:31.000]  all day into the van. I got to sit there and watch them get away with it. And I got to
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:39.240]  watch them. I'm skipping the network break. I've got to watch them sit there and basically
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:46.600]  chop these kids up in front of me. And so I get why people don't want to admit this
[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:50.840]  is going on. We're getting swallowed like by a boa constrictor. Like I eat some baby
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:57.560]  pig here. I mean, this is bad. But we're not going to get out of this without standing
[02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:06.160]  up. And I'll tell you what shakes me. You couldn't write a book or a comic book more
[02:20:06.160 --> 02:20:13.760]  fantastical with, you name it, the tough guys of America. So you'd imagine her listeners
[02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:23.640]  of this show, right? And they're afraid. And maybe that's the way it is. But you know,
[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:34.840]  some of their sons aren't. A lot of these folks think surviving is winning. Not when
[02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:40.640]  the whole culture and the whole civilizations on the line. This system is about ending human
[02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:46.200]  survival and breaking the continuity of our species. This is about weirdo control freak
[02:20:46.200 --> 02:20:53.040]  perverts manipulating our genetics. Real perversion is not a guy in a dress, folks. Real perversion
[02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:57.920]  is putting salmon in the sea that grow three times faster and are twice as big as regular
[02:20:57.920 --> 02:21:04.760]  ones that will extinct all of their salmon and are part insect. That's blasphemy. That's
[02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:11.880]  evil. Let's go to this piece that I shot for the nightly news last night where I break
[02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:17.080]  down the fact that there is mutiny, good mutiny, against the globalist takeover. In fact, the
[02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:25.840]  war is not mutiny because it's not mutiny. It's illegitimate hijacking. And I just can't
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:29.920]  believe we're going to let the globalist actually run a communist takeover model in
[02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:35.920]  America for a bunch of offshore banks. I mean, that's just too rich. Are you really going
[02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:39.320]  to let them do that? I mean, they've weaponized the media with all this race baiting and sex
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:48.040]  stuff and articles, folks. I mean, every few minutes coming out saying, ball face lies
[02:21:48.040 --> 02:21:56.280]  about me. Both. I mean, Alex Jones ran a protest terrorized Austin with guns and a scare everyone
[02:21:56.280 --> 02:22:00.200]  and he was there and they were running around with giant dildos waving them. I mean, actually
[02:22:00.200 --> 02:22:07.360]  says that in Newsweek. Daily Beast. If you're a new listener and I just said that, I'm not
[02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:23.240]  joking. This is what they do. Conspiracy theorists terrorized our town. And they say I ran it.
[02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:30.120]  I did it. All this, all ice. We were critical of this demonstration overall because we didn't
[02:22:30.120 --> 02:22:32.800]  think it was smart, but it's their first event right to do it. We have a right to say we don't
[02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:39.080]  think it's a smart way to do it. Gary Jackson came to me a week before and said, this stinks.
[02:22:39.080 --> 02:22:43.160]  This looks like it could be connected to some stuff. I said, yeah, stay away from it. You're
[02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:50.400]  right. Good instincts. And again, that's just one microcosm example of how they've told
[02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:56.480]  them go for broke. We're not worried about being sued. Attack. And I guess a lot of men
[02:22:56.480 --> 02:23:00.160]  see that attack. I think I don't want to be attacked by that. That's what men are supposed
[02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:05.720]  to do is go out and confront the evil. Let's go ahead and go to this piece on the soft
[02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:11.000]  coup against the global takeover of America as some areas of our military struggle to save
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:16.400]  America as it's being strangled to death. Here it is. Your agency was saying, quote,
[02:23:16.400 --> 02:23:20.960]  the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving
[02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:26.200]  the insurgents in Syria. In 2012, the US was helping coordinate arms transfers to those
[02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:30.840]  same groups. Why did you not stop that? It was a decision. I think it was a willful decision,
[02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:34.040]  a willful decision to go support an insurgency that had Salafist al-Qaeda.
[02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:40.560]  Right. A willful decision to do what they're doing, which you have to really ask the president,
[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:42.280]  what is it that he actually is doing?
[02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:46.480]  Let's stop there. That was general. It's an eight minute video. I skipped the break.
[02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:52.640]  I went too late. I have to play it next time. Let's go to some phone calls right now.
[02:23:52.640 --> 02:24:03.560]  Man, they really do hate us folks. I mean, they, they send in teams all over Africa and
[02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:08.400]  all over the Middle East and they're doing it in Asian areas and they kill whole villages
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:14.160]  of peaceful Christians. The people that run our government literally can't get our own
[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:24.040]  military to kill Christians. So they use al-Qaeda to do it. I just can't believe it. I mean,
[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:31.200]  I know evil stuff goes on, but man, you talk about crazed, dirty, stinking filth. When I
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:37.440]  look at Obama, I just imagine he, I can just smell the evil. I don't know how to describe
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:40.720]  it. I just, I just, I just, my body doesn't want to be in his presence. I can't hardly
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:48.280]  look at Hillary Clinton anymore because it makes me feel pathetic, demoralizes me that
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:25:01.600]  this sack of weak, murderous filth, I mean, she's the author of Syria folks, hundreds
[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:08.120]  of thousands of people, women into sex slavery, all of it. I mean, Obama in the TPP, Daniels
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:15.360]  is the story about it. And then full wars.com allows human trafficking of slaves. They have
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:33.000]  slave labor all over the world at sweatshops, trafficked by China and North Korea and others.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:36.880]  I mean, I'm not defending Putin, but actually saw statements he made about a year ago. He
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:41.000]  says, we use some North Korean labor on our borders with them to try to have relations,
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.720]  try to give them money to help their people. We do not like the conditions these workers
[02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:49.800]  are in. And we have our own workers who are attempting to try to give aid so that more
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:54.080]  people don't die. At least Russia said like, it was like when I say, I've got an iPhone
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:26:00.400]  made by slaves. I'm a hypocrite, but at least I admit it. I've got to hear about white Christmas
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:05.960]  is racist. And if you have different menus at a college, it's racist. If you've got
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:11.520]  southern food or Chinese food, what that sounds like a great, great, great selection. Again,
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:17.720]  they just make stuff that isn't bad, bad. And then Obama brags the reporters, they talk
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:25.480]  about him shipping a ball into the hole to make him more human. Obama brags reporters.
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:30.640]  I'm an excellent leader. Obama claims TPP, which expands slavery is an example of his
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:36.240]  American leadership. Yeah, that Congress couldn't even see and the people couldn't see, but
[02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:44.920]  they all do it like con artists out in the open. And they're using our money to build
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:53.520]  this giant prison grid around us. All they laugh at us. I'm going to go to break, come
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:57.360]  back, play this clip and go to your calls. We want to hold. We got Patriot in Africa.
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:00.840]  I'm sorry, but hold for 27 minutes. I'll go to you first. Since you're probably calling
[02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:06.600]  on your own diamond, I'll get to others. Here's another article. Global warming 51 Fahrenheit
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:10.960]  temperature recorded in Colorado. Other areas of the globe are also experiencing extreme
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:17.160]  cold. Another kid Daniels article, very prolific writer. I'm going to go to this call in Africa.
[02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:23.680]  Patriot, what country are you calling in from? We're calling in from the Zambia Alex. Well
[02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:29.960]  concerned. I was just driving, driving between cities today. I'm just seeing the devastation
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:34.720]  of the poverty. I mean, I was just getting so upset at the globalists. And then I remembered
[02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:39.000]  it's because we do nothing. And we just let them get away with all of this. I mean, they
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:45.240]  are their father, the devil, and it's up to us to stand up against them. It's sick. They
[02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:51.120]  want to make everybody poor. What's your take? All the things happening, my friend. It's
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:58.520]  just out of control. Just cloud and pivot, the, the technology, just the NSA spying.
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:03.560]  I mean, we have to have our national ID cards hooked up to our SIM cards in our phone here.
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:09.480]  So just everything is down there. And it's just, it's just over the top. And I know in
[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:14.000]  Africa, the government's doing everything they can to harass the farmers that are self-sufficient.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:19.520]  It's all about consolidating. Yeah, no, we're just going to get the GMO seeds and then I
[02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:23.160]  will solve everything. Yeah, they tell you, we'll give you billions
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:28.600]  in aid, which is only given to select corporations in your country to build command bases. But
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:36.560]  you've got to plant only GMO and you got to take these shots. Yeah, I mean, the vaccines
[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:41.000]  are just jacked with all sorts of stuff. I mean, you know, the kinds of viruses God knows
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:46.680]  what else to put in there. In Africa, I know folks are really awake. You've had a lot of
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:50.840]  your government's tests, the vaccines and find the Steriline Senate. But then they block
[02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:56.360]  industrialization, which would make you not have kids to begin with. How awake are people,
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:03.160]  would you say, in Zambia? Unfortunately, not very, Alex. I mean, I
[02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:08.840]  haven't met a single enforcement listener while I've been here. But people know that
[02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:13.480]  something is wrong. They know that the governments are corrupt and they know that I'd like the
[02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:17.840]  IMF and foreign banks are trying to just loot us.
[02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:22.600]  Well, they admit, I mean, it's not my opinion. People like to scapegoat Africa, although
[02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:26.120]  they can't get their act together. They just blew up Libya that was jacking the whole system
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:29.760]  up. They blew up South Africa. I'm not saying that they wasn't bad, but they replaced it
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:35.520]  with something worse, so that they can get everything totally cheap and control everybody.
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:38.840]  And they've got all the white papers, the Royal Commission on Population 49, you name
[02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:43.560]  it. They knew they could industrialize Africa and make it a jewel and reduce population,
[02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:48.280]  but they didn't. They instead funded a giant explosion population in squalor.
[02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:59.040]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:04.640]  GOP presidential hopeful ran Paul as introduced legislation intended to block any effort by
[02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:10.040]  the incumbent president to enforce gun control by executive action. Paul's legislation named
[02:30:10.040 --> 02:30:14.760]  the separation of powers restoration and Second Amendment Protection Act would render any
[02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:20.000]  action on gun legislation by the president, which circumvents Congress as advisory only
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:24.960]  in nature. Paul's bill would apply to any executive action on gun control that either
[02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:29.720]  infringes upon congressional authority or potentially violates the second amendment.
[02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:34.920]  The bill then mandates that once an executive action has been classified as advisory only,
[02:30:34.920 --> 02:30:39.920]  it would require Congress to pass it in order for it to take effect. The bill also outlines
[02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:44.800]  that it is within their power for a state official, member of Congress, or a person affected
[02:30:44.800 --> 02:30:50.120]  by an executive action on gun control to launch a civil lawsuit. The legislation will be fast
[02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:54.640]  tracked through the Senate and is expected to be made priority after the Christmas recess.

[02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:15.360]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:36.920]  to Alex Jones, the death machine ain't slowing down. It's growin' pound for pound. All you
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:46.240]  can trust is the love in your mother's eyes.
[02:33:46.240 --> 02:34:09.800]  Shoulder Jennings career took off after he started coming on this show. And then of course
[02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:19.240]  you know what they told him. As if we would need someone to come on our show to be successful.
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:24.200]  Pretty much everyone I know and meeting it from low level to high level gets phone calls
[02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:29.400]  and told do not associate with Alex Jones. Don't you think Donald Trump was told that?
[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:37.160]  You think he just accidentally came on this show? And you know it really freaks the system
[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:40.920]  out. I wonder how freaked out they're gonna be in the next few months when we get some
[02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:51.880]  even bigger interviews. See it takes their pleasure away when we're not afraid of them.
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:35:00.280]  Yeah we're locked up in the room with vampires. We got weapons. At the truth. And their bark
[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:04.720]  is a lot bigger than their bite. There's a reason they target us when we're little.
[02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:10.200]  It's a reason they target us when we're children with the media and the culture. We're afraid
[02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:22.960]  we grow into men and women. This is the animating contest of liberty. This is the destiny of
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:32.960]  our species being decided. You are alive. You have the programming. You have the will.
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:37.880]  You have the spirit. Even if you've been under bondage to break free from this. God gave
[02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:50.680]  you the antenna that is your soul to break free from this.
[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:54.520]  Nico and everybody was rightfully saying hey man you haven't plugged anything all day. You
[02:35:54.520 --> 02:36:00.000]  didn't really do it yesterday. Why aren't you doing it? When I really get focused, when
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:10.900]  I get centered, I need energy. I need money to fund this operation. But it's really hard
[02:36:10.900 --> 02:36:15.480]  to get up here and talk about how great the products are and push them when I'm getting
[02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:20.760]  into such serious issues. Most talk shows us plug every segment and they need to. But
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:25.240]  we're talking radio is going bankrupt. Advertising is shot. The economy is in shambles. We plug
[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:30.560]  about once an hour. We do everything a little bit different. We mainly sell our own products.
[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:43.600]  We still have sponsorship. But I'm so not neurotic. I just have so much trouble with
[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:47.240]  sponsors making sure they're great, making sure they're right, making sure their quality
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:52.560]  stays the same that I went two years, three years almost without having a water filter
[02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:58.160]  company because I just couldn't find anything really good. Stuff that had been good in my
[02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:03.840]  opinion. We had a lot of complaints. It wasn't as good as we were. I just couldn't do it.
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:08.200]  People are like you're going to not do this? Why? I'm just, I know I'm not. And I just
[02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:12.600]  can't believe in this world that's like so special. I don't want to be screwed over.
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:23.160]  I mean, is it really weird that I want a fair shake? Is it really weird I care about people?
[02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:42.320]  And I realize a lot of people just aren't even really alive. We have a bunch of products
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:49.880]  and they're all really good. You know, I say we have the best deals on shortwave radios.
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:53.720]  And then I had this big pain of conscience driving home the other day. I went, I made
[02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:59.520]  that deal on those radios 10 years ago to get the best deals in on the best quality.
[02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:07.600]  Have I even checked the prices or that it is the latest and best and everything so that
[02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:13.040]  I actually say that and it's true. Everything else I know is just top of the line best.
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:16.040]  And I called Weldon up and he said, no, yeah, no, they're they're a great company. They're
[02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:19.240]  always giving us the latest and the best deals. It's all built in boss. Don't worry about
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:23.400]  it. It's just good to have people like that that over there working on it. But see, imagine
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:29.040]  having a conscience and really wanting to really certify what I say being accurate versus
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:34.320]  these people that just hop around lying all day to everybody. Let me tell you something.
[02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:38.160]  You start lying to people. You start lying to yourself and I'm not going to be part of
[02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:44.520]  that. I don't even plug in the shortwave radios or AMFM weather radios. You name it crank
[02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:50.240]  powered solar power, whatever. Yeah, I like having a strong good house with a gate on
[02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:58.080]  it. I like having a car that reliable and fun or the few pleasures I have, but I don't
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:02.720]  worship money. And I realized that when they used to intimidate me and say, how dare you
[02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:06.160]  try to make money? That was their big attack 10 years ago. Alex Jones is about money and
[02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:09.920]  I was giving my films out for free and, you know, would live in a modest house and if
[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:14.560]  I made more money, I'd hire more crew and try to expand the operation. I was more happy
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:20.560]  than two. They'd send stalkers to my house and the rest of us had to move and then they
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:23.640]  would try to come after me and take everything I had to shut the company down. I realized
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:26.560]  this is dumb. They're afraid I'm going to grow. They're afraid I'm going to build a
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:32.680]  larger network. I didn't want to be the leader. I wanted to put the word out like Paul Revere
[02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:35.640]  and then, you know, they have the continental Congress and George Washington get comes out
[02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:44.080]  and we, you know, and I'm just a part of it. That's just not how it works. It's the opposite
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:49.720]  of a power trip. Looking around this world, looking around this country and I ain't George
[02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:52.600]  Washington folks. I'm far from it. And let me tell you, I'm the closest thing to George
[02:39:52.600 --> 02:40:03.920]  Washington there is in this country. That didn't brag and that's the truth. That's scary.
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:14.560]  The modern world of information warfare, I am a general and I need other men and women
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:18.040]  out there, CEOs, corporate people, you name it, not to call me, not to call some great
[02:40:18.040 --> 02:40:22.800]  master plan. You need to take action. You know what to do. Speak out. Say no. Start
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:31.880]  your own show. Get involved. But whatever you do, take action because it's almost become
[02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:39.600]  like a fascinating, fun thing to sit around. You know, be sitting around with special forces
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:43.520]  people or billionaires or whatever rocket scientists that are all absolutely right.
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:48.040]  Oh my God, it's terrible. What are we going to do? Do we leave? Do we run a New Zealand
[02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:52.600]  and all that stuff? We're going to stay here and fight once it gets really bad, but it's
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:41:00.880]  already got bad. So whether it's the nutraceuticals or whether it is all the other products at

[02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:15.320]  an effect and they really are. Things like the nasa nine is so powerful that I say consult
[02:41:15.320 --> 02:41:20.960]  a physician because it isn't a joke. Nobody else has got this. I mean, I went out and
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:28.280]  sought out the real game changing stuff. It's real. Try it. How about the coming here and
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:36.000]  plug for 30 seconds a day and find our operation and then shut up about it. Try brain force.

[02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:59.760]  donate money to them, put a billboard up, get aggressive. Everybody trying to protect
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:04.320]  themselves and hold it in and be small and keep their head down. I mean, so many people
[02:42:04.320 --> 02:42:10.880]  that have money just hoard it and shit on it. You're going to lose all that money and
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:15.720]  you're going to lose everything you got if you don't invest now in freedom. There's a
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:27.640]  war. Did anybody tell you about that? All right, let's go to this piece and I'm gonna
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:31.720]  skip this break too. It's coming up for Christmas. My Christmas present. I say, send the money
[02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:35.960]  in when you money. By the way, skip half the breaks and pick up the radio where they told
[02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:40.320]  me I can't. I just can't help it. I mean, I am GCN so it doesn't matter. I'm not bragging
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:44.240]  and I don't say that to be aggressive. It's like we're under attack people. That's why
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:49.520]  I'm telling you how big we are. I've known this for a while, but we're under globalist
[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:57.720]  attack because we're hurting them and I mean to go on standing up to them. I need your
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:04.600]  help. I need your prayers and let me tell you, it's the opposite of a power trip as
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:08.800]  the evil rises against you and your family and myself. Everybody's going through transformations
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:15.880]  right now. This is a critical time in history. Everybody feels it, but I have to pray to
[02:43:15.880 --> 02:43:21.760]  God every day to be able to control the discernment, the understanding. It is so incredible to
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:30.200]  be enlightened and awake. And then I just see sad people unaware of what's going on.
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:33.520]  And they had their whole lives stolen from them, their whole destiny stolen from them.
[02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:43.920]  It's so sad. They were messed with from childhood with all these chips on their shoulders and
[02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:55.440]  false ideas and twisted garbage. And I just want people to realize the power you have.
[02:43:55.440 --> 02:43:59.160]  Let's go ahead and go to this piece on the incredible developments with the military
[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:02.800]  starting out with the head of defense intelligence. I played this 30 or 40 times. I keep telling
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:06.000]  you it's a huge deal and it happened two months ago. More generals are doing it. They're saying
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:10.160]  we're backing Al Qaeda. It's wrong. It's evil. Something should be done. And then now Sy
[02:44:10.160 --> 02:44:14.860]  Hersh, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, has more intel that just confirms everything we
[02:44:14.860 --> 02:44:26.240]  said here first, but I'm not bragging. It's crazy that they authorize high level intelligence
[02:44:26.240 --> 02:44:31.280]  operatives to come on this show like Colonel Schaefer, who's in very secretive high level
[02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:37.280]  groups in Congress and in the UK. And he used to come on and get in big trouble. Now they
[02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:45.480]  go, go ahead, go on. Tell me what's going on. Ambassador Stevens was murdered. I really
[02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:49.920]  meet with Navy SEAL families. I really have met with Navy SEALs days after they blow up
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:59.120]  the helicopter. I was driving home from that meeting that day and trying to shoot a YouTube
[02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:05.520]  video and upload it. And my body was burning. I had to pull over and I had to throw up.
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:13.520]  It wasn't because I was scared. It was that I wanted to fight these people so hard that
[02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:21.080]  I was like a race car engine about to blow. I mean, it takes a lot of will to put 20-something
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:25.360]  Navy SEALs on a helicopter because they know the bin Laden raid was fake and blow them up.
[02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:29.360]  And then to know the families all know, we've had them on the air, some of the families
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:34.280]  as well, but this is, this is when it happened. You try hitting the barbed wire first every
[02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:40.120]  time and then watching a bunch of cowards point their finger at you. People that I've
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:43.440]  known a long time admit, no, no, man, I make fun of you and stuff because I'm scared. I
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:55.160]  know you're right. I want to be protected. How dishonorable is that? Good God. Good
[02:45:55.160 --> 02:46:07.840]  God. To actually know it's all evil and happening and then join with it. I had, who's that TV
[02:46:07.840 --> 02:46:14.200]  movie star guy who writes a bunch of conspiracy theory books, you know, he comes on. He had
[02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:19.720]  Christopher Walken came on the show with him. Richard Belzer, and I'm not knocking
[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:24.440]  Belzer. I'm going to have him back on the show. And I was bashing George Soros in his Nazi
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:27.560]  collaboration. He said, no, no, be careful, be careful. Cause you know, Soros is the left
[02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:30.560]  and all that. He goes, be careful. You know, he had to do that or he'd have been killed
[02:46:30.560 --> 02:46:36.840]  by the Nazis. And I said, Belzer, you could put a gun to my head and tell me go round
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:43.120]  up kids hiding in basements. And I'd say, pull that trigger, you son of a bitch. Or I'd probably
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:46.080]  say, Oh, absolutely. Let me work with you. And then as soon as they put the gun back
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:51.520]  on the holster, I'd, I'd kill him. And folks that didn't talk. People need to understand
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:47:00.040]  I'm for real. Okay. The government knows that they know. Okay. And the reason I'm talking
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:05.760]  about me here is not from some position of narcissism. It's from a position of I have
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:12.560]  Americana flame. You have Americana flame. If we spread the brush fires and the minds
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:24.560]  of men and women, we can win. I am 1776. And so are you. Let's, let's go to the peace
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:28.880]  for a round of time. David, nice coming up for that. Here it is.
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:33.640]  Your agency was saying, quote, the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood and al Qaeda in Iraq
[02:47:33.640 --> 02:47:39.520]  are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria. In 2012, the US was helping coordinate
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:43.840]  arms transfers to those same groups. Why did you not stop that? It was a decision. I think
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:47.920]  it was a willful decision, a willful decision to go support an insurgency that had Salafist
[02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:52.840]  al Qaeda, a willful decision to do what they're doing, which, which you have to really have
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:58.400]  to really ask the president, what is it that he actually is doing? That was General Michael
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:06.200]  Flynn several months ago on Al Jazeera talking about the fact that President Obama gave them
[02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:12.240]  orders to basically build up ISIS and al Qaeda and that that was the set policy. And the
[02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:15.920]  interviewer says, oh, you mean they didn't know what was happening? He says, no, they
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:20.760]  consciously told us to do that. Well, this is the information we had three years ago
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:26.480]  from military high level and low level, giving us the same information. And the fact that
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:32.960]  General Dempsey on the eve of air strikes against Syria went to the White House and
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:37.280]  said the military from the brass on down are not going to be al Qaeda's air force. And
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:42.880]  we saw Senator Ted Cruz go public. We saw Senator Rand Paul go public and make similar
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:48.040]  statements that our military and our people do not want to be al Qaeda's air force. Now,
[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:55.040]  since then we've had the schizophrenic or helter skelter or oxymoronic policies, a better
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:49:02.280]  term of Turkey and other countries funding ISIS and al Qaeda and al Nazra and the West
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:07.560]  giving them weapons, toe missiles, Stinger missiles, you name it, Hillary Clinton, namely,
[02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:13.760]  Benghazi was just one part of that. It's ongoing at the same time that the United States military
[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:20.080]  and sitcom has been given intel to the Russians, giving intel to the Syrians, giving intel
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:25.240]  to other people that are actually fighting ISIS. Now, we've known this we've had CIA whistleblowers
[02:49:25.240 --> 02:49:29.600]  on like Tosh Plumlee, we've had Colonel Shaefer on to talk about it. Info wars has been at
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:35.880]  the very forefront of exposing it. But now in a review of Seymour Hirsch, the two time
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:40.880]  Pulitzer Prize winning journalist's new book, military to military, London review of books.
[02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:45.480]  It's also in other publications like New Yorker have excerpts of his new book interviewing
[02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:50.720]  other generals as well as Flynn breaking all this down. I mean, this is incredible and
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:56.880]  mainstream media almost spends it like it's not a counter coup happening with the military
[02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:02.320]  saying no to treason arming al-Qaeda and ISIS, but that's what it is. And so then the State
[02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:07.200]  Department separately, just as Tosh Plumlee exposed three years ago, has to use its import
[02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:13.560]  export power to order weapons transfers as even above the Pentagon and the CIA. The military
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:17.960]  may have its problems and certainly, you know, aren't perfect, but they don't want to arm
[02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:23.440]  al-Qaeda to murder every Christian group in Syria. They don't want to overthrow our allies
[02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:28.440]  in Egypt and put the Muslim Brotherhood in the South kind of light. They understand this
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:32.640]  is directly against America's interest and it's a war crime. And again, it doesn't even
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:37.280]  help our country or even our own elites. Why are they doing this? Well, the argument is
[02:50:37.280 --> 02:50:41.440]  of Assad's an enemy of the West, even though he tried to help us on 9-11 and other events,
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:46.440]  but still this is terrorist. If he's a supposed enemy, take him down regardless, but you don't
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:51.080]  take him down and then put people in that are 50 times worse. So there's a major fight
[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:54.880]  going on for the heart and soul of America. And I got to tell you, I'm always hearing
[02:50:54.880 --> 02:50:58.640]  this talk about let's have a military coup, let's stop the globalists that way. Military
[02:50:58.640 --> 02:51:04.960]  coups almost always turn out worse than what you already had. But with the situation in
[02:51:04.960 --> 02:51:11.600]  World War II in 1944, when the German high command knew that what Hitler was doing was
[02:51:11.600 --> 02:51:15.080]  going to destroy Germany, that they lose millions of more people, that the Soviets were going
[02:51:15.080 --> 02:51:21.360]  to occupy, that the Russians were going to come in, they moved to eliminate Hitler. Now,
[02:51:21.360 --> 02:51:25.480]  I'm not saying anybody should go after Obama because he's just a puppet, but the neocon
[02:51:25.480 --> 02:51:29.720]  globalist groups that he represents and the Clintons and others are steering this country
[02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:34.000]  towards World War III, not just in Syria, but in Ukraine against Russia. They are clear
[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:40.760]  and present danger. And I can only liken what's happening to a soft valkyrie or a soft counter
[02:51:40.760 --> 02:51:45.560]  coup, because it's not a coup. We already have foreign globalist corporate hedge fund
[02:51:45.560 --> 02:51:50.120]  interest and their front people who aren't even military playing with stuff that could
[02:51:50.120 --> 02:51:56.040]  cause World War III very easily. And it's our own military that's usually pushing for
[02:51:56.040 --> 02:52:00.840]  war in the days of Curtis LeMay wanting nuclear war with the Russians and L.L. Emmitzer. Usually
[02:52:00.840 --> 02:52:05.640]  I'm like, let's have the statesman hold back some of the war hawks at the Pentagon. It's
[02:52:05.640 --> 02:52:12.400]  the war hawks at the Pentagon time and time again, quietly trying to stop what is leading
[02:52:12.400 --> 02:52:16.720]  most analysts say towards a larger confrontation with Russia that could easily lead to thermal
[02:52:16.720 --> 02:52:21.320]  nuclear war. They called the Cold War World War III. So really, this is World War IV,
[02:52:21.320 --> 02:52:25.920]  a hot war that we're on the verge of. And World War I started in proxy wars. World
[02:52:25.920 --> 02:52:30.120]  War II started in that as well. We are going down a very, very dangerous path, but the
[02:52:30.120 --> 02:52:35.240]  good news is the globalists have gone too far. They've jumped the shark. I mean, it takes
[02:52:35.240 --> 02:52:40.360]  a lot of nerve. They've got to think we're really stupid to try to openly overthrow all
[02:52:40.360 --> 02:52:45.320]  these Middle Eastern countries, including our allies, create failed states and places like
[02:52:45.320 --> 02:52:51.520]  Libya and Syria. And then Hillary gets in the Democratic debates two weeks ago and says,
[02:52:51.520 --> 02:52:57.160]  oh, you know, Libya and Syria are right where they're supposed to be, a failed state, breaking
[02:52:57.160 --> 02:53:02.240]  them up in pieces and then giving part of it to the radical Wahhabist out of Saudi Arabia.
[02:53:02.240 --> 02:53:08.540]  That is working with terrorists. That is opening the door to them. And that brings us into
[02:53:08.540 --> 02:53:13.120]  part two of this. Why would they bring in millions of jihadis, invaders out of Syria,
[02:53:13.120 --> 02:53:17.280]  people that came in to invade Syria, into Europe, hundreds of thousands in the U.S.,
[02:53:17.280 --> 02:53:21.280]  knowing they're going to attack? Well, they think we're so stupid that when the jihadis
[02:53:21.280 --> 02:53:26.640]  do attack, they'll take our guns, our liberties, our freedoms. Instead of stopping the flow
[02:53:26.640 --> 02:53:30.920]  of the folks that are attacking us, they're going to use this threat. And MSNBC, the Morning
[02:53:30.920 --> 02:53:36.440]  Joe just today, came out and said, don't worry about the Islamic threat. Worry about
[02:53:36.440 --> 02:53:40.240]  white gun owners. They're the big crime rate. Despite the fact, and we'll show some of these
[02:53:40.240 --> 02:53:46.280]  on screen, crime rates are down over 50 plus percent since 1991. And white males consist
[02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:51.600]  of the lowest crime rate of any male group. Look it up for yourself. But oh, there's
[02:53:51.600 --> 02:53:56.720]  an epidemic of white males killing everyone. This is an inversion of reality. You're telling
[02:53:56.720 --> 02:54:02.040]  Muslim Americans that all need to come out and talk about the tiny percentage of their
[02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:08.880]  community that has kind of quite frankly wreaked havoc. But yet you look at the data of white
[02:54:08.880 --> 02:54:14.080]  men with guns wreaking havoc on this country. Why aren't white men all coming forward? Why
[02:54:14.080 --> 02:54:19.400]  don't you call on them to do that? I actually am doing a lot of things. And finally, in
[02:54:19.400 --> 02:54:23.120]  the hypocrisy department, Hillary Clinton during the Democratic debate this weekend
[02:54:23.120 --> 02:54:28.120]  said that Donald Trump's being used in ISIS recruiting videos. The entire media checked
[02:54:28.120 --> 02:54:32.800]  it. It's not true. Turns out the Clintons are being used in ISIS recruiting videos. Turns
[02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:37.720]  out the Clintons have been giving weapons through Benghazi to ISIS and on other occasions.
[02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:42.760]  So this shows how dumb they think we are. Hillary out Brian Williams, Brian Williams
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:48.160]  years ago claiming that she'd been in Bosnia, Herzegovina, Serbia and had been shot at in
[02:54:48.160 --> 02:54:52.720]  the air, shot it on the ground. And then they cut to the CBS footage. Nothing happened that
[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:58.800]  day when she got off the tarmac on the red carpet. She's a liar. So why is she allowed
[02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:03.840]  to blame Donald Trump for ISIS when out of everybody that's involved in this, she as
[02:55:03.840 --> 02:55:09.080]  the head of the State Department literally quarterbacked the operation? What difference
[02:55:09.080 --> 02:55:14.720]  at this point does it make? Now David Nye's going to break down more excerpts of Sy Hersh's
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:20.800]  book here in just a moment right here in the studio. But we wanted to really focus on this
[02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:25.360]  tonight because it's a big deal. This is going on behind the scenes and it gives me a lot
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:29.640]  of faith that there's still a lot of good people in our government and in our system.
[02:55:29.640 --> 02:55:33.480]  But they need us, we the people to stand up and support what they're doing as well because
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:39.880]  if the fact that criminals have hijacked our government, our funding terrorists and letting
[02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:43.240]  them into our country to destabilize this ever gets out of the general public, it could
[02:55:43.240 --> 02:55:49.080]  cripple the globalist forever. We are at a key point now, ladies and gentlemen, and
[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:53.680]  this is not a coup because the globalists have already taken over. They're illegitimate.
[02:55:53.680 --> 02:56:00.720]  The military is engaged in a stealth, very moderate counter coup against what the establishment's
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:06.000]  doing. And it is a big, big deal. And truth is strange with the fiction. I've never imagined
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:10.760]  that we'd see resistance to this tyranny coming from these quarters, but it is happening.
[02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:18.240]  Alex Jones, signing off for info wars.com. Now, that's just part of the report. And if
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:24.040]  you're a TV viewer to understand where I come from, no makeup, I'm sweating. I was totally
[02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:30.640]  exhausted yesterday evening and I just gutted up and said, I've got to do this report. And
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:34.360]  so the reason I point out that it doesn't even look perfect is stop thinking you've
[02:56:34.360 --> 02:56:38.840]  got to look perfect to take action. You've got to have all the answers. Just do the right
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:43.680]  thing, speak up, get involved. And I'm telling you, God will carry you the rest of the way.
[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:51.360]  I've experienced Providence the last 20 plus years that is miraculous, but it doesn't exist
[02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:56.200]  unless you take action. In every case in the Bible and in history, George Washington wrote
[02:56:56.200 --> 02:57:00.440]  about this extensively. When you put everything on the line for the right reason and ask God
[02:57:00.440 --> 02:57:05.320]  to carry the rest of the way, God will. You don't just say, oh, I believe in the secret,
[02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:14.280]  new age, I'm going to get everything given to me. God gives to people that have a mission
[02:57:14.280 --> 02:57:19.560]  to help others. And that means protecting you and you being rewarded as well, but only
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:28.640]  so that you're strong.
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:38.920]  We can defeat the new world order with God's help, but it's going to take humbling ourselves
[02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:43.240]  and seeking God's face and repenting. And if you can find a good church, most of them
[02:57:43.240 --> 02:57:47.520]  are taken over by the feds. Good luck to the denominations, but there are some good ones
[02:57:47.520 --> 02:57:51.880]  out there this Christmas holiday coming up. I just want you to know, I love you viewers.
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:57.640]  I love you listeners. I am super humbled by your kind words and by your support. That's
[02:57:57.640 --> 02:58:03.560]  why I should please stop it because it isn't about me. But it's become about me in the
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:08.560]  media, just like Donald Trump now represents conservatism, whether he is or not. So we
[02:58:08.560 --> 02:58:13.120]  do have to then actually say who we are so that folks understand what we stand for and
[02:58:13.120 --> 02:58:18.440]  what we go through and what we feel versus who they claim we are. And it may be ugly
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:22.960]  sometimes the way I fight. It's because, you know, it's real. It comes from the gut and
[02:58:22.960 --> 02:58:28.160]  I get exhausted and I throw fits and I stumble through the day sometimes. But at the end
[02:58:28.160 --> 02:58:32.600]  of the day, my heart is pointed towards justice. I'll do five more minutes and I'm going to
[02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:36.120]  go a little bit in with David Knight coming up in the fourth hour. I hope your stations
[02:58:36.120 --> 02:58:41.640]  carry it. Merry Christmas to everybody and a happy new year and peace on earth. And thank
[02:58:41.640 --> 02:59:06.640]  you for our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, Father. Thank you for his sacrifices.
[02:59:06.640 --> 02:59:25.980]  Thank-you for

[03:01:34.280 --> 03:01:41.080]  promised liabilities that they cannot fund them so they have to get rid of us
[03:01:41.080 --> 03:01:45.440]  somehow some way well that's it that's it and they and they also don't want to
[03:01:45.440 --> 03:01:49.600]  share the resources with the public or the life extension and they want to get
[03:01:49.600 --> 03:01:53.000]  everything organized before they supposedly launch off or colonies and
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.400]  they've made the decision that humans are obsolete they're gonna merge the
[03:01:55.400 --> 03:01:58.480]  machine so they're just taking over the future they're stealing the future
[03:01:58.480 --> 03:02:02.440]  back that's what the this segment's called that they've stolen future the

[03:02:18.200 --> 03:02:22.720]  noticing something here in southeast Wisconsin they've been mounting boxes
[03:02:22.720 --> 03:02:27.160]  about the size of a lunchbox maybe a little smaller and they're colored white
[03:02:27.160 --> 03:02:36.080]  and there's a 11 or 12 inch square antenna mounted on these things that
[03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:41.320]  are configured like a diamond they're pointing in different directions I've
[03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:45.840]  seen them in the site small towns down here and I've got Google programs we
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:48.840]  could take a photo of that and then it'll tell you what it is but they're
[03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:53.040]  putting in all sorts of GPS trackers all sorts of license plate readers they've
[03:02:53.040 --> 03:02:58.640]  got tracker chips and all the new cars they're putting in antenna systems to
[03:02:58.640 --> 03:03:01.960]  steal your passcodes record everything you're doing I mean it is just like
[03:03:01.960 --> 03:03:06.200]  Hillary said it's a Manhattan project how many times that I call this a hundred
[03:03:06.200 --> 03:03:09.960]  times the Manhattan project that's what the world government is geoengineering
[03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:14.400]  total tracking poison the food and water I mean what we know is it's just so
[03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:19.440]  jacked up it'll blow your mind brother I mean it is crazy well I don't know if
[03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:24.160]  you said it but I heard somewhere that some states are putting are putting

[03:03:37.600 --> 03:03:40.440]  and that we're tracking you know oh you're tracking our phones we're just not
[03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:43.200]  gonna say we're just tracking we know right we're at just total fourth of it
[03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:49.040]  they didn't have a warrant track where they were at they just did it but they
[03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:52.920]  can't stop the radicals coming into attack us no we're gonna go to break
[03:03:52.920 --> 03:04:03.760]  thank you John David Knights coming up a new senator lectures us on the dangers
[03:04:03.760 --> 03:04:07.800]  of supporting executive orders out of partisan loyalty he's gonna get into
[03:04:07.800 --> 03:04:11.880]  update on jury notification what's happening in the country GOP gone

[03:04:42.240 --> 03:04:46.160]  why it's just hard to see other people sitting around in the trance having no

[03:08:32.160 --> 03:08:36.480]  phones we go to those it's up to him but not we can let folks go apologize for
[03:08:36.480 --> 03:08:41.880]  not getting to all of you I've been talking a lot about the fact that this
[03:08:41.880 --> 03:08:48.400]  radio show this TV show our media platform info wars dot com is reaching
[03:08:48.400 --> 03:08:53.120]  conservatively 20 million people a week I mean that is a very conservative number
[03:08:53.120 --> 03:08:58.360]  I can walk through those it's actually I mean I mean really reaching people
[03:08:58.360 --> 03:09:05.120]  actually tuning into the broadcast on podcast or AM and FM or YouTube and all
[03:09:05.120 --> 03:09:10.960]  other platforms and the great part about it is the good news all this bad news is
[03:09:10.960 --> 03:09:14.720]  we can see the IP addresses we ought to do this sometime just show all the IP
[03:09:14.720 --> 03:09:18.560]  addresses that are coming in by the millions every month from government
[03:09:18.560 --> 03:09:24.160]  computers foreign state governments military installations you name it and
[03:09:24.160 --> 03:09:26.680]  what do you think it did when they tell the military under Clinton and then
[03:09:26.680 --> 03:09:30.720]  again later under Obama you know you can't go to info wars dot com on base
[03:09:30.720 --> 03:09:35.760]  and everybody wants to go to info wars dot com so I'm not here to our horn I'm
[03:09:35.760 --> 03:09:39.600]  giving you good news in the info war that we're reaching more people all the
[03:09:39.600 --> 03:09:45.320]  time and the military and people in government we call up many times to get
[03:09:45.320 --> 03:09:48.400]  a congressman on or somebody they go listen the congressman will cut me up
[03:09:48.400 --> 03:09:51.280]  call us back or whatever I'm a big listener but I politically don't want
[03:09:51.280 --> 03:09:55.480]  to do it I heard the show yesterday by the way or we get you know a congressman
[03:09:55.480 --> 03:09:57.880]  on from Tennessee or wherever and never had him on before like yeah I was just
[03:09:57.880 --> 03:10:04.080]  listening yesterday I mean it's a big responsibility and I keep going back to
[03:10:04.080 --> 03:10:08.880]  that that is exponential right now and we're just one group doing this there's
[03:10:08.880 --> 03:10:13.000]  many other people many other organizations and I want to caution
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:17.200]  and folks starting up new websites are new radio shows and stuff once you get
[03:10:17.200 --> 03:10:21.600]  a little bit of traction you'll immediately have people they'll try to get
[03:10:21.600 --> 03:10:25.680]  you in fighting or make some about you don't respond to it move on those are
[03:10:25.680 --> 03:10:30.160]  admitted governmental tactics they legalize the CIA operate domestically
[03:10:30.160 --> 03:10:36.080]  and its formulas that they outsource to basically federal informants and people
[03:10:36.080 --> 03:10:42.360]  to try to just mess with you and then and then to get you into the whole soap
[03:10:42.360 --> 03:10:45.760]  opera of fighting with them and their allegations and all the rest of it
[03:10:45.760 --> 03:10:50.080]  ignore it all move forward no one's listening to them they don't have an
[03:10:50.080 --> 03:10:53.800]  audience if you talk about all this stuff on air people think you're talking
[03:10:53.800 --> 03:10:57.800]  you know you're a space alien I only occasionally put these messages out as
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:11:01.800]  inside baseball to activists to understand when you're attacked it's
[03:11:01.800 --> 03:11:07.480]  good I mean I'll take maybe one out of 50 articles that attack us every day and
[03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:10.880]  it's more than that it sounds ridiculous say 200 300 and just say look at this
[03:11:10.880 --> 03:11:15.160]  lie this is what they do but it's an illustration of how they deceive not
[03:11:15.160 --> 03:11:25.160]  about defending ourselves truth doesn't need any defense and we have people that
[03:11:25.160 --> 03:11:27.840]  are bankrupt psychologically and spiritually that want to rule the world
[03:11:27.840 --> 03:11:34.760]  right now and they need us to be bankrupt
[03:11:34.760 --> 03:11:39.560]  psychologically and spiritually actually what's happening now is a good
[03:11:39.560 --> 03:11:45.800]  thing overall because every generation every culture every society every age
[03:11:45.800 --> 03:11:50.120]  particularly there's seasons within seasons and then seasons goes through
[03:11:50.120 --> 03:11:54.920]  crises and faces different hardships ours is having incredible entertainment
[03:11:54.920 --> 03:12:01.640]  decadence drugs the distractions but so much knowledge at the same time water
[03:12:01.640 --> 03:12:05.600]  water everywhere not a drop to drink so many ignorant people in the midst of the
[03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:13.000]  greatest knowledge ever and if we can transcend these great tests then we can
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:21.000]  be judged by God to go to the next level and everything I'm noticing the
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:28.560]  universe is repeated of course there's a triune of God it just all resonates the
[03:12:28.560 --> 03:12:32.960]  more knowledge you get you genetically are your ancestors living on through you
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:37.920]  a spliced mix of all of them with instincts crystallized that you can
[03:12:37.920 --> 03:12:41.600]  tap into and then they're like full recordings the elite know about this is
[03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:44.080]  why they keep their bloodlines together but they got a bad movie they're
[03:12:44.080 --> 03:12:49.400]  watching we have to counter them with our knowledge race memory I mean wow man
[03:12:49.400 --> 03:12:53.600]  you know come on George Lucas admitted his Star Wars films are trying to tap
[03:12:53.600 --> 03:13:00.720]  into race memory a long time ago in a galaxy far far away whatever I'm not
[03:13:00.720 --> 03:13:07.320]  gonna go any further there the point is that this is the animating contest of
[03:13:07.320 --> 03:13:12.600]  liberty and those of us that burns so bright against the tyranny have to
[03:13:12.600 --> 03:13:16.440]  remember that like a race car driver you can't rev it up to 9,000 RPMs all the
[03:13:16.440 --> 03:13:21.240]  time and I'm the same way and I have to literally pray to God to let me stop
[03:13:21.240 --> 03:13:24.720]  thinking about this and turn it off and just enjoy myself and watch a goofy
[03:13:24.720 --> 03:13:28.920]  movie with the kids or play board game or take them swimming or hiking or
[03:13:28.920 --> 03:13:34.240]  whatever and so I know why a lot of people can't handle this stuff because
[03:13:34.240 --> 03:13:41.600]  it is real it is real and that's why they at one end try to create infighting
[03:13:41.600 --> 03:13:47.000]  demonizes the national press inject disinfo ridiculous conspiracies where
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:51.520]  every shootings a hoax and everybody's a crisis actor and Alex Jones's Bo
[03:13:51.520 --> 03:13:54.560]  Bridges and Bill Hicks and all this stupidness and they have major
[03:13:54.560 --> 03:13:59.200]  newspapers call me like it's serious and are you Bill Hicks to fan the flames of
[03:13:59.200 --> 03:14:04.880]  that mental illness I mean let's just say I'm Bill Hicks which I'm not it's very
[03:14:04.880 --> 03:14:12.960]  maybe 60 years old or something let's just say I'm Bill Hicks what are you
[03:14:12.960 --> 03:14:16.280]  doing to fight the New World Order they're trying to forcibly inoculate
[03:14:16.280 --> 03:14:19.320]  everybody now all over the world these vaccines are deadly read the inserts
[03:14:19.320 --> 03:14:22.000]  let's do something about that let's do something about GMO let's do something
[03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:25.040]  about the open borders let's do something about the moves to shut off our
[03:14:25.040 --> 03:14:29.480]  power plants and deindustrializes real simple you give us cheap electricity the
[03:14:29.480 --> 03:14:34.080]  jobs will all come here period that's why I harp on stuff I want to see you
[03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:38.400]  win I want to see innovation I want to see the clean energies I want to have
[03:14:38.400 --> 03:14:44.160]  life extension for myself and my family and you I want us to share the bounties
[03:14:44.160 --> 03:14:54.520]  of the future together but cowards will not inherit the kingdom of heaven
[03:14:54.520 --> 03:15:03.360]  selling out to this beast system going along with it only means that you will be
[03:15:03.360 --> 03:15:09.360]  destroyed David Knight I've been quite philosophical today but these are the
[03:15:09.360 --> 03:15:13.600]  times that try men souls you've you've been here three and a half years pulled
[03:15:13.600 --> 03:15:17.120]  up stakes in North Carolina souls your house brought your family down here an
[03:15:17.120 --> 03:15:22.560]  engineer think tank activists exposing major stories on your own up there you've
[03:15:22.560 --> 03:15:25.800]  been here you know you've seen the inside of it we now see it everywhere
[03:15:25.800 --> 03:15:30.680]  there's an explosive awakening happening right now the establishments
[03:15:30.680 --> 03:15:33.880]  turning up the heat with their lives I mean it's really discrediting I think I
[03:15:33.880 --> 03:15:36.960]  don't but I guess they're just trying to set the precedent where they can do
[03:15:36.960 --> 03:15:40.880]  anything they want what is your gut feeling on the state of the Union the
[03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:45.880]  state of the world as we move towards Christmas well Alex things are getting
[03:15:45.880 --> 03:15:48.640]  better and they're getting worse you know it's the best of times it's the
[03:15:48.640 --> 03:15:51.960]  worst of times we're seeing people with integrity like William Benny that you
[03:15:51.960 --> 03:15:56.720]  talked to earlier come out we've seen integrity on the part of the people at
[03:15:56.720 --> 03:16:01.320]  the Pentagon who are opposing Obama working with Al Qaeda working with ISIS
[03:16:01.320 --> 03:16:05.240]  funding them so we see that kind of opposition people trying to work within
[03:16:05.240 --> 03:16:08.840]  the system eventually coming out as whistleblowers as we see now these
[03:16:08.840 --> 03:16:12.280]  retired generals coming out so that's a very important thing I think we need to
[03:16:12.280 --> 03:16:15.600]  understand that it is all coming to a head I thought it's very interesting when
[03:16:15.600 --> 03:16:18.840]  you talked to William Benny and you asked him about stingray said why would
[03:16:18.840 --> 03:16:21.600]  they need this in addition to all the monitoring that they're doing with our
[03:16:21.600 --> 03:16:25.000]  phones and our internet communication and he used the term I'd never heard
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:28.560]  before he called it treasure map now when we were looking at the Jade Helm
[03:16:28.560 --> 03:16:32.240]  situation remember the subtitle of that was mastering the human domain that's
[03:16:32.240 --> 03:16:35.360]  something that's been talked about what they've had massive treasure map
[03:16:35.360 --> 03:16:39.240]  intersects it live time with the tracker chips in the cars exactly it's
[03:16:39.240 --> 03:16:42.920]  geospatial intelligence it's an entire field and of course they want to tell
[03:16:42.920 --> 03:16:46.280]  us oh metadata is all we're collecting metadata is not important metadata is
[03:16:46.280 --> 03:16:50.360]  the most important thing because that's how they track you that's how they map
[03:16:50.360 --> 03:16:53.120]  you that's what treasure map is about we talked about activity based
[03:16:53.120 --> 03:16:57.080]  intelligence we talked about human domain analytics that is all part of
[03:16:57.080 --> 03:17:01.560]  mastering the human domain it's an entire field geospatial intelligence and
[03:17:01.560 --> 03:17:06.160]  of course James Clapper has been in that field gave has been a keynote speaker
[03:17:06.160 --> 03:17:10.920]  for the trade conference for that year after year for about 15 years now so
[03:17:10.920 --> 03:17:16.040]  that's a conspiracy stealing our tax money lying to us and then not
[03:17:16.040 --> 03:17:19.320]  protecting us with it if you want to think of this was pointed outside the
[03:17:19.320 --> 03:17:23.000]  country it's pointed at us I'm gonna hand the baton to you my friend great
[03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:26.560]  job I just want to say it's amazing working with colleagues like you and
[03:17:26.560 --> 03:17:29.280]  the rest of crew and I know you're about to go to break come back with all the
[03:17:29.280 --> 03:17:32.920]  serious news but it's been a little time this Christmas season talking about
[03:17:32.920 --> 03:17:36.240]  info wars talking about the listeners and and and what this fight means to you
[03:17:36.240 --> 03:17:38.800]  and what your experience has been like because the listeners really like to
[03:17:38.800 --> 03:17:42.240]  hear that personal perspective David Knight and I'll see you soon my friend
[03:17:42.240 --> 03:17:45.480]  well thank you Alex and it's really been a pleasure to be here to work with you
[03:17:45.480 --> 03:17:49.040]  to see you up close and personal a lot of people wonder what that's like it
[03:17:49.040 --> 03:17:52.640]  really you can really see the commitment of Alex here and we can't do it
[03:17:52.640 --> 03:17:57.960]  without your help and certainly it's it's absolutely essential that you
[03:17:57.960 --> 03:18:00.880]  understand that people who are in the military people who are intelligence
[03:18:00.880 --> 03:18:04.080]  community people who have the possibility of be whistleblowers to stand up to do
[03:18:04.080 --> 03:18:07.280]  the right thing just as Alex was saying before if somebody tells you to go round
[03:18:07.280 --> 03:18:11.400]  up kids we're going to send them to an execution chamber you say just kill me
[03:18:11.400 --> 03:18:15.360]  we're not going to do that you have to understand that if you bow down to this
[03:18:15.360 --> 03:18:18.560]  it's only going to get worse that's the reason I came here I'm sure that's the
[03:18:18.560 --> 03:18:22.080]  reason jacari Jackson came here jacari is going to talk with us when we come back
[03:18:22.080 --> 03:18:27.040]  we want to get into some detail on this one minute report that jacari you've
[03:18:27.040 --> 03:18:31.600]  probably heard cycling through the radio program today that of course is some
[03:18:31.600 --> 03:18:36.800]  people some Republicans in the Senate that are preemptively moving to shut
[03:18:36.800 --> 03:18:42.280]  down Obama's executive orders on gun control of course he's looking back at
[03:18:42.280 --> 03:18:45.640]  all of his wonderful accomplishments and New York Times is listing his
[03:18:45.640 --> 03:18:49.280]  Trans-Pacific Partnership that hasn't technically passed yet but you watch
[03:18:49.280 --> 03:18:51.680]  they're going to do that they're going to do that before the end of the year
[03:18:51.680 --> 03:18:56.360]  this is going to be a midnight Christmas Eve gift or New Year's Eve gift like the
[03:18:56.360 --> 03:19:01.200]  NDA was when he did that or like the Federal Reserve coming in that's the
[03:19:01.200 --> 03:19:04.160]  type of thing that's going to happen of course they paved the way for that with
[03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:07.480]  the trade promotion authority so that's just going to be a formality that's
[03:19:07.480 --> 03:19:10.840]  going to come through but he's looking back at what he's done over the last
[03:19:10.840 --> 03:19:15.160]  several years over seven years he's got one more year left and of course he's
[03:19:15.160 --> 03:19:19.080]  said on multiplications and the press has said on multiplications the one thing
[03:19:19.080 --> 03:19:23.600]  that he hasn't done yet that he wants to get done is massive gun control and
[03:19:23.600 --> 03:19:26.200]  of course he's not going to get that through Congress so if he's going to
[03:19:26.200 --> 03:19:29.200]  push that he's going to push it by executive order so jacari is going to
[03:19:29.200 --> 03:19:33.880]  break down for us the move by senators to push back against that and we have an
[03:19:33.880 --> 03:19:37.840]  amazing video we're going to play for you of a new senator Ben Sass I think is
[03:19:37.840 --> 03:19:43.200]  the way his name is pronounced he talks about what it means to sacrifice the
[03:19:43.200 --> 03:19:48.720]  rule of law allowing executive orders just for partisan politics Democrats and
[03:19:48.720 --> 03:19:53.880]  Republicans need to hear what he has to say stay with us we'll be right back

[03:24:10.960 --> 03:24:14.600]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show this fourth hour news roundup I'm David
[03:24:14.600 --> 03:24:18.280]  Knight and joining me right now is Jakari Jackson if you've been listening to the
[03:24:18.280 --> 03:24:22.800]  show you've heard Jakari's spot talking about how some senators and Republican
[03:24:22.800 --> 03:24:28.240]  senators are moving to preemptively shut down Obama's anticipated move to enact
[03:24:28.240 --> 03:24:33.280]  gun control by executive order ignoring the laws ignoring the Congress of people
[03:24:33.280 --> 03:24:36.200]  who make the laws and of course ignoring the Second Amendment I'm gonna take some
[03:24:36.200 --> 03:24:39.960]  of your calls those of you who are still holding I will get back to your calls
[03:24:39.960 --> 03:24:44.560]  but in this segment I want to talk to Jakari tell us what's going on in the
[03:24:44.560 --> 03:24:48.280]  Senate Jakari well senators like Rand Paul have introduced a bill to kill
[03:24:48.280 --> 03:24:52.120]  Obama's gun control because as you alluded to Obama is trying really hard
[03:24:52.120 --> 03:24:55.480]  to push through some executive gun control before he leaves office of
[03:24:55.480 --> 03:24:59.400]  course we're not talking about gun control for al-Qaeda or ISIS or Mexican
[03:24:59.400 --> 03:25:03.720]  drug cartels no border control no border patrol but for the citizens here in the
[03:25:03.720 --> 03:25:08.080]  United States in the article reads by Steve Watson Paul's legislation named
[03:25:08.080 --> 03:25:12.080]  the separation of powers restoration and Second Amendment Protection Act would
[03:25:12.080 --> 03:25:15.920]  render any action on gun legislation by the president which circumvents
[03:25:15.920 --> 03:25:20.920]  Congress as advisory only in nature the bill also outlines that it is within the
[03:25:20.920 --> 03:25:25.000]  power for a state official member of Congress or person affected by an
[03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:29.000]  executive action on gun control to launch a civil lawsuit and I think this is
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:33.160]  very important this very about the civil lawsuit because we'll see people I'm
[03:25:33.160 --> 03:25:36.880]  sure there will be many good police officers good shares of federal agents
[03:25:36.880 --> 03:25:40.040]  who say hey we don't want to go along this gun confiscation or whatever it is
[03:25:40.040 --> 03:25:44.120]  that you have planned so now they actually have a way to follow a lawsuit
[03:25:44.120 --> 03:25:48.640]  against the powers that be that's absolutely right you know it's amazing
[03:25:48.640 --> 03:25:53.160]  that we haven't seen the Congress stand up and do anything there they're a do
[03:25:53.160 --> 03:25:55.960]  nothing Congress on so many issues except with a few exceptions like
[03:25:55.960 --> 03:25:59.680]  Rand Paul who will constantly introduce this type of legislation to get them to
[03:25:59.680 --> 03:26:02.200]  do something and of course I say now we don't want to do it so they pass it off
[03:26:02.200 --> 03:26:06.440]  to these bureaucracies that are their own little fiefdoms they write their own
[03:26:06.440 --> 03:26:09.720]  laws they have their own police forces their own judiciary where they enforce
[03:26:09.720 --> 03:26:14.200]  this law the president is doing his executive orders and Congress just sets
[03:26:14.200 --> 03:26:17.800]  there and allows people to do that that's why we have to shut this thing down
[03:26:17.800 --> 03:26:21.120]  from the outside we have to shut it down with state nullification we have to
[03:26:21.120 --> 03:26:24.160]  shut it down at the individual level with jury nullification I've got some
[03:26:24.160 --> 03:26:28.160]  stories coming up on that but I think this is a very important move for them
[03:26:28.160 --> 03:26:31.120]  to preemptively say look we're gonna put some measures in here that are gonna
[03:26:31.120 --> 03:26:36.160]  put some teeth into the the entire process a constitutional process I
[03:26:36.160 --> 03:26:41.840]  think that's very important and I want to play what a new senator Ben Sasse said
[03:26:41.840 --> 03:26:45.640]  about these kinds of executive orders because he was talking to people and
[03:26:45.640 --> 03:26:49.480]  putting it in a partisan situation I'll let him talk about it and we'll comment
[03:26:49.480 --> 03:26:53.080]  when we come back to Karina let's play that clip from Ben Sasse talking about
[03:26:53.080 --> 03:26:58.760]  the dangers of partisanship in supporting executive orders imagine
[03:26:58.760 --> 03:27:03.360]  President Trump has been propelled into the White House with 300 electoral
[03:27:03.360 --> 03:27:08.640]  votes having one mainly by the force of his personality by calling BS on this
[03:27:08.640 --> 03:27:14.440]  town and by his promise to get things done by acting unilaterally the first
[03:27:14.440 --> 03:27:20.320]  hundred days are huge he signs an order that turns the Peace Corps into stone
[03:27:20.320 --> 03:27:25.240]  masons to build the southern wall he shutters the Department of Education and
[03:27:25.240 --> 03:27:29.480]  by executive order he turns the Department of Interior into the
[03:27:29.480 --> 03:27:36.600]  classiest oil company the world has ever known what happens next with those
[03:27:36.600 --> 03:27:40.440]  who've stayed silent about executive overreach over the last seven years
[03:27:40.440 --> 03:27:45.520]  suddenly find religion after years of legislative atrophy would Congress
[03:27:45.520 --> 03:27:49.920]  bring into action and remember its supposed power of the purse and what
[03:27:49.920 --> 03:27:54.680]  about Republicans after having raged against a supposedly lawless president
[03:27:54.680 --> 03:27:59.240]  would many suddenly find that they're actually okay with a strongman president
[03:27:59.240 --> 03:28:04.000]  so long as he's wearing the same colored jersey they are exactly as long as
[03:28:04.000 --> 03:28:06.960]  he's wearing the same colored jersey you go along with it and we've seen this
[03:28:06.960 --> 03:28:10.640]  happen so many times haven't with your car yeah because you think about how many
[03:28:10.640 --> 03:28:13.320]  people hated Bush you know the Democrats they hate Bush all the things that he
[03:28:13.320 --> 03:28:17.400]  stands for then you have Obama comes in he is supposedly supposed to be anti-
[03:28:17.400 --> 03:28:20.880]  war he's launching all these conflicts he's sending drones overseas blowing up
[03:28:20.880 --> 03:28:24.240]  innocent people but it's okay when Obama does it yeah and you got the
[03:28:24.240 --> 03:28:27.800]  Republicans going against Obama but now when you get if you get a Republican
[03:28:27.800 --> 03:28:30.920]  back in office are they still going to voice those same concerns do you remember
[03:28:30.920 --> 03:28:34.360]  how you constantly heard the Democrats complaining about Bush is acting
[03:28:34.360 --> 03:28:37.400]  unilaterally he's acting unilateral now they didn't really have a problem that
[03:28:37.400 --> 03:28:41.000]  he wasn't getting the okay of our elected representatives they wanted him to
[03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:45.560]  get the okay of the UN okay but you know it was still a unilateral issue but
[03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:49.480]  they're the ones who are demanding that Obama act unilaterally yeah so this
[03:28:49.480 --> 03:28:53.480]  senator Ben Sasse and I hope I'm pronouncing his last name correctly did a
[03:28:53.480 --> 03:28:57.880]  great job of laying this out and saying look you know imagine and this is why
[03:28:57.880 --> 03:29:00.840]  it's important we've said this all along when we're talking about Obama
[03:29:00.840 --> 03:29:06.200]  imagine that there's somebody that comes in Democrats who is on the other side
[03:29:06.200 --> 03:29:09.760]  of the issue that all these issues that you think are very important and he
[03:29:09.760 --> 03:29:14.720]  just comes in and starts issuing edicts and commands like a dictator okay are
[03:29:14.720 --> 03:29:18.000]  you gonna be okay with that because we've had the Republicans now
[03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:21.880]  complaining about this and you know very well and he knows as well too mm-hmm
[03:29:21.880 --> 03:29:25.560]  that when you get a Republican coming in as it that's why they have laid down for
[03:29:25.560 --> 03:29:29.200]  this because they say well it's gonna be my turn to be dictator next yes we're
[03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:33.000]  gonna be a dictator so I don't want to take this dictator down so both people
[03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:37.720]  on both sides of the aisle both parties need to understand they are setting up
[03:29:37.720 --> 03:29:41.240]  a very dangerous precedent when they encourage this type of action thank you
[03:29:41.240 --> 03:29:46.560]  jacar we write back with your phone calls and some more breaking news

[03:35:25.600 --> 03:35:31.320]  I'm big listener to show so I appreciate the take out a call my first
[03:35:31.320 --> 03:35:39.040]  question is my only question is but all of this it's going on in the world you
[03:35:39.040 --> 03:35:45.520]  know the geoengineering chemtrails and you know the globalists taking over
[03:35:45.520 --> 03:35:51.680]  with everything that's hitting the fan right now I had a question that I wanted
[03:35:51.680 --> 03:35:58.000]  to post to Alex as to we is just normal ordinary everyday citizens that our
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:07.120]  taxpayers how would we go about taking on Obama and these you know big
[03:36:07.120 --> 03:36:12.280]  political figures of the people behind the scenes to really get something done
[03:36:12.280 --> 03:36:17.160]  because I mean I really feel like I got earlier you know it scared the death
[03:36:17.160 --> 03:36:20.360]  like I'm scared to death I wake up every day thinking you know it's today the day
[03:36:20.360 --> 03:36:24.000]  that the first shot gonna be fired and you know the UN people are gonna
[03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:29.960]  distribute Islam out and then you know start taking on you know I'm scared
[03:36:29.960 --> 03:36:35.360]  death so you know can an ordinary everyday American go get a federal
[03:36:35.360 --> 03:36:40.400]  attorney and then try to bring charges on you know a president of the United
[03:36:40.400 --> 03:36:44.320]  States or you know these people behind there well in general I think they're
[03:36:44.320 --> 03:36:46.840]  gonna shut that down they're gonna say that you don't have standing even though
[03:36:46.840 --> 03:36:50.160]  you do have an interest in this they will play those types of games so that's a
[03:36:50.160 --> 03:36:55.120]  very difficult route to go and I would also say then understand just how biased
[03:36:55.120 --> 03:36:58.960]  the court system is you know most of these judges especially the appeals level
[03:36:58.960 --> 03:37:05.320]  are federal appointees so we've seen things like the the FAA overreaching
[03:37:05.320 --> 03:37:09.520]  itself on drone regulations going all the way down to a toy planes that are a
[03:37:09.520 --> 03:37:12.840]  half a pound saying if you don't register this just for not registering it
[03:37:12.840 --> 03:37:17.480]  they could find you 27 and a half thousand dollars and I think that began
[03:37:17.480 --> 03:37:21.560]  yesterday as a matter of fact if you didn't register your drone by the 21st now
[03:37:21.560 --> 03:37:26.000]  you better do it with them or if they catch you they will try to assess that
[03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:29.760]  as a civil penalty they won't even give you due process in court only if they
[03:37:29.760 --> 03:37:34.200]  come after you as a criminal operation so that was something that people had
[03:37:34.200 --> 03:37:38.480]  complained about they point out this is absurd and of course in a trial case you
[03:37:38.480 --> 03:37:43.000]  had a judge who struck that down the FAA's attempts to do that on a plane that
[03:37:43.000 --> 03:37:46.360]  was larger than that even though it was made out of styrofoam it was a larger
[03:37:46.360 --> 03:37:51.400]  plane wait a little bit more and yet an appeals court of federally appointed
[03:37:51.400 --> 03:37:55.080]  judges struck that down struck down what the judge said the judge said this is
[03:37:55.080 --> 03:37:59.160]  absolutely ridiculous that you would try to extend this kind of control down to
[03:37:59.160 --> 03:38:05.600]  toy planes but then the NTSB board political appointees on appeal said
[03:38:05.600 --> 03:38:09.920]  no you're not going to do that so I would say Seth that that is not the route
[03:38:09.920 --> 03:38:12.920]  that I would go here's what I would suggest that you do and it's a more
[03:38:12.920 --> 03:38:16.240]  difficult thing to do and it's hard to get the information because you know
[03:38:16.240 --> 03:38:20.360]  we're a national news organization we do get into detailed stories at
[03:38:20.360 --> 03:38:24.440]  individual levels to give you an idea of what's going on in places as a template
[03:38:24.440 --> 03:38:28.560]  when they have a an application that is national we talk about those local
[03:38:28.560 --> 03:38:32.240]  stories but there's a lot that's happening at the local level that it
[03:38:32.240 --> 03:38:35.240]  takes a little bit more groundwork to get involved with it we all like to
[03:38:35.240 --> 03:38:39.040]  follow the presidential campaigns and yeah they're important at a large at on
[03:38:39.040 --> 03:38:42.880]  several different levels they're very important but it can be a distraction to
[03:38:42.880 --> 03:38:46.480]  paralyze you from doing anything at the local level so there are things that you
[03:38:46.480 --> 03:38:51.280]  can do at the local level knowing when there are honest people and that's an
[03:38:51.280 --> 03:38:55.040]  easier thing to determine when it's a smaller sphere of influence and you're
[03:38:55.040 --> 03:38:58.440]  closer to those people and then getting behind that person working with them
[03:38:58.440 --> 03:39:02.640]  supporting them getting them into office your local sheriff can be very very
[03:39:02.640 --> 03:39:06.640]  powerful to stand up for your rights so that's a very important thing to do the
[03:39:06.640 --> 03:39:09.360]  other thing you can do is at the state level if you get some good state
[03:39:09.360 --> 03:39:14.720]  legislators some good state executives they can exert legal and constitutional
[03:39:14.720 --> 03:39:17.800]  state nullification to shut down overreach of the federal government and
[03:39:17.800 --> 03:39:22.200]  then at the individual level you have a lot of power if you do get on to a
[03:39:22.200 --> 03:39:26.400]  jury now that's something that requires some information and that's where we
[03:39:26.400 --> 03:39:29.480]  have to work I think to get this information out there if we get one
[03:39:29.480 --> 03:39:33.400]  person out of 12 on a jury to shut down unjust laws whether those things are
[03:39:33.400 --> 03:39:37.000]  coming at the federal level the state level or the local level one person on
[03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:42.400]  the jury can shut that down the problem is most people see the juries as
[03:39:42.400 --> 03:39:47.000]  rubber stamps and so they don't really have any confidence in the jury system
[03:39:47.000 --> 03:39:51.920]  anymore because it's been so destroyed and so we have this catch 22 of trying
[03:39:51.920 --> 03:39:57.440]  to get people to put themselves on the line and and try for an honest jury
[03:39:57.440 --> 03:40:01.840]  trial when this whole process is rigged and so we have to restore the integrity
[03:40:01.840 --> 03:40:07.680]  of the judicial system that is a massive educational issue and I'm glad that you
[03:40:07.680 --> 03:40:13.400]  asked because there was an update today about jury nullification we've talked to
[03:40:13.400 --> 03:40:16.960]  Keith Wood actually we talked to his lawyer David Coleman this is a case
[03:40:16.960 --> 03:40:20.240]  that's coming out of menace Michigan and I'll talk about that but let me get
[03:40:20.240 --> 03:40:24.400]  your feedback on that what do you think is is the thing that you can do do you
[03:40:24.400 --> 03:40:30.240]  agree with me that that you're going to have more effect at a local level okay
[03:40:30.240 --> 03:40:34.360]  I think Seth is gone so well let me go through and I'll tell you everybody else
[03:40:34.360 --> 03:40:39.120]  what's happened now with this case that is out of Michigan this is a situation
[03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:45.200]  this is a 39 year old former pastor he found out what juries are really for he
[03:40:45.200 --> 03:40:48.680]  found out what juries were really intended for you know our power it has
[03:40:48.680 --> 03:40:52.800]  been said comes out of a few boxes it comes out of the ballot box it comes out
[03:40:52.800 --> 03:40:58.920]  of the jury box and it comes out of the cartridge box as a last resort well for
[03:40:58.920 --> 03:41:02.220]  to come out of the jury box we have to understand what juries are for the
[03:41:02.220 --> 03:41:06.720]  juries are there not just to judge the facts of the case they're also there to
[03:41:06.720 --> 03:41:10.640]  judge the law and how it is going to be applied if they feel the penalties are
[03:41:10.640 --> 03:41:16.160]  draconian they can and should and it is their duty to shut it down they did this
[03:41:16.160 --> 03:41:20.280]  with alcohol prohibition it got to the point where in many areas of the country
[03:41:20.280 --> 03:41:25.840]  they could not get any enforcement on anything that there was a country a the
[03:41:25.840 --> 03:41:33.040]  town and the name of it escapes me right now that is now the first town to have a
[03:41:33.040 --> 03:41:38.800]  majority Muslim council and they are enacting alcohol prohibition selectively
[03:41:38.800 --> 03:41:43.240]  around mosques in that town and they pointed out that they never had
[03:41:43.240 --> 03:41:46.400]  prohibition during alcohol prohibition because nobody would convict their
[03:41:46.400 --> 03:41:50.560]  neighbors for violating alcohol prohibition so that's an effective way to
[03:41:50.560 --> 03:41:54.320]  shut this down of course it's a way that people could shut down that kind of
[03:41:54.320 --> 03:41:59.560]  quasi soft sharia law that's being imposed on people in that town is with a
[03:41:59.560 --> 03:42:03.880]  jury nullification so it's a very very important tool to shut down now you had
[03:42:03.880 --> 03:42:07.320]  this guy's 39 year old former pastor he's got I think five children's got a
[03:42:07.320 --> 03:42:10.840]  large family he was handing out pamphlets from the fully informed jury
[03:42:10.840 --> 03:42:15.720]  association and the judge saw this pamphlet was so outraged that he had
[03:42:15.720 --> 03:42:18.920]  him arrested and this was just before Thanksgiving he intended to keep him in
[03:42:18.920 --> 03:42:22.600]  jail over the Thanksgiving weekend the magistrate worked to give him an
[03:42:22.600 --> 03:42:29.840]  excessive bail $150,000 for handing out pamphlets on the sidewalk and of course
[03:42:29.840 --> 03:42:33.360]  there was no jury in session but they charged him with jury tampering and so
[03:42:33.360 --> 03:42:37.480]  his attorney who's representing him and I talked to him on the nightly news he
[03:42:37.480 --> 03:42:42.520]  said when he first was contacted by Keith Wood he thought this guy is really
[03:42:42.520 --> 03:42:46.280]  exaggerating the situation what he's telling me can't be true this can't be
[03:42:46.280 --> 03:42:49.880]  true and he said he went down and looked at and he goes nobody's telling me
[03:42:49.880 --> 03:42:54.520]  really is true it's absolutely amazing they arrested him for handing out a
[03:42:54.520 --> 03:42:58.680]  pamphlet on the sidewalk in front of the courthouse and what this pamphlet is
[03:42:58.680 --> 03:43:02.640]  doing is talking in general terms about the rights and the obligations and the
[03:43:02.640 --> 03:43:07.480]  duties of jurors talking about the history of trials in America and going
[03:43:07.480 --> 03:43:11.320]  all the way back to English common law as well because that established the
[03:43:11.320 --> 03:43:15.920]  basis for what is in many constitutions here in many state
[03:43:15.920 --> 03:43:19.760]  constitutions in the United States nevertheless he's running through this
[03:43:19.760 --> 03:43:24.440]  thing and of course now they have he's put out a motion and I just got a an
[03:43:24.440 --> 03:43:28.920]  update from mr. Coleman he makes four points number one it's impossible to
[03:43:28.920 --> 03:43:33.360]  tamper with a jury that is not existing does not exist jury tampering cannot be
[03:43:33.360 --> 03:43:35.960]  charged as felony obstruction of justice they're coming after him for
[03:43:35.960 --> 03:43:40.280]  obstruction of justice as well as jury tampering and they say the prosecution
[03:43:40.280 --> 03:43:44.360]  of mr. Wood violates his first amendment right to free speech and said the
[03:43:44.360 --> 03:43:47.960]  prosecutors trying to scare everyone into believing that if we allow freedom
[03:43:47.960 --> 03:43:51.200]  of speech more specifically if we allow jurors to vote their conscience that
[03:43:51.200 --> 03:43:55.760]  we'll live in a lawless nation yet we have lived in such a nation for over
[03:43:55.760 --> 03:44:01.240]  200 years and it did not turn us into a lawless nation no that is the
[03:44:01.240 --> 03:44:07.440]  fundamental responsibility of the jurors now in a parallel case it just came
[03:44:07.440 --> 03:44:12.920]  out a couple of days ago a Colorado judge has on multiple occasions arrested
[03:44:12.920 --> 03:44:15.920]  people who were doing the same thing in Denver outside of a Denver courthouse
[03:44:15.920 --> 03:44:19.720]  they did go to a federal judge and this is something that they're considering
[03:44:19.720 --> 03:44:24.680]  that David Coleman and his his client Keith Wood are considering a federal
[03:44:24.680 --> 03:44:30.080]  case and what these people in Colorado did at Denver they did make a federal
[03:44:30.080 --> 03:44:33.600]  case out of it you had two activists who are arrested and charged with seven
[03:44:33.600 --> 03:44:37.640]  counts of jury tampering back in July of this year when they were arrested they
[03:44:37.640 --> 03:44:41.960]  took their matters to as a federal lawsuit against the city of Denver for
[03:44:41.960 --> 03:44:45.400]  violating their first amendment right to free speech and in a civil federal
[03:44:45.400 --> 03:44:50.080]  lawsuit a US district judge ruled in their favor and said that if you pass out
[03:44:50.080 --> 03:44:54.680]  pamphlets on public property that's free speech yeah of course it is of course it
[03:44:54.680 --> 03:44:59.960]  is now they even went as he even went as far as to tell this judge Martinez told
[03:44:59.960 --> 03:45:04.400]  the Denver police and the sheriff's deputies to stop arresting people for
[03:45:04.400 --> 03:45:10.120]  first amendment protected activity on public property so yes you can win we
[03:45:10.120 --> 03:45:14.400]  have seen this happen over and over again if you fight them on this you they
[03:45:14.400 --> 03:45:20.440]  will lose and you have the capability of acting as a juror and exercising your
[03:45:20.440 --> 03:45:24.240]  conscience as a matter of fact we've talked about the case of a New Jersey
[03:45:24.240 --> 03:45:28.920]  weed man who acted as his own attorney he knew that most people would not send
[03:45:28.920 --> 03:45:33.680]  him to jail for these draconian measures for having marijuana he knew from
[03:45:33.680 --> 03:45:38.960]  public polls that most people did not support the criminalization of marijuana
[03:45:38.960 --> 03:45:42.360]  so he thought well I'm going to argue for a jury nullification he couldn't get
[03:45:42.360 --> 03:45:45.320]  an attorney who would do that for him so he represented himself and in the
[03:45:45.320 --> 03:45:50.720]  first trial he held up the New Jersey Constitution that says that jurors have
[03:45:50.720 --> 03:45:56.480]  a right and a duty to judge not only the facts of the case but the law and he
[03:45:56.480 --> 03:46:00.320]  got and when he put that up the judge said put that down I'm gonna hold you
[03:46:00.320 --> 03:46:05.320]  in contempt but it was too late the jurors had already seen it and so seven
[03:46:05.320 --> 03:46:09.000]  of them voted to acquit him now the prosecutor came after him a second time
[03:46:09.000 --> 03:46:13.240]  second time he got a different judge that judge allowed him to keep that sign
[03:46:13.240 --> 03:46:18.000]  up and he just left it up on the table in front of him he got acquitted 12 to
[03:46:18.000 --> 03:46:22.040]  nothing that's the power of jury nullification that's the way we can
[03:46:22.040 --> 03:46:25.840]  shut these people down and I think that's a very important way to tackle
[03:46:25.840 --> 03:46:28.880]  this let's go to Tim and Wyoming Tim you've been hanging on a long time to
[03:46:28.880 --> 03:46:34.920]  talk about an essay go ahead yeah hi David thanks for taking my call I was
[03:46:34.920 --> 03:46:38.800]  actually wanting to talk to you what David or excuse me William Vinnie when
[03:46:38.800 --> 03:46:44.760]  he was on because I wanted to ask about how the NSA collects information just
[03:46:44.760 --> 03:46:50.480]  as a drag net as you've said as Alexis said I said before drag net
[03:46:50.480 --> 03:46:54.600]  surveillance they just collect whatever they can collect and I'm wondering now
[03:46:54.600 --> 03:47:00.960]  when a person wants to start a new media enterprise let's say just a small
[03:47:00.960 --> 03:47:05.120]  radio show like I was actually thinking about doing it myself and now as I'm
[03:47:05.120 --> 03:47:09.680]  hearing more and more about the NSA's draconian measures I don't know that I
[03:47:09.680 --> 03:47:15.520]  really want to try it but I'm actually going to anyway no matter what but they
[03:47:15.520 --> 03:47:20.440]  are if they can if they have an internet kill switch if they actually have some
[03:47:20.440 --> 03:47:24.640]  way of shutting things off now I know that Alex brought that the way I listen
[03:47:24.640 --> 03:47:31.280]  to the show Alex the Alex Jones show is over the internet I listened to it
[03:47:31.280 --> 03:47:35.760]  through the cellular system over the internet but at the same time when I'm
[03:47:35.760 --> 03:47:40.240]  listening to it I'm thinking well all they have to do is just cut one link
[03:47:40.240 --> 03:47:45.520]  somewhere all they do is cut one just flip one little switch and everything's
[03:47:45.520 --> 03:47:50.920]  turned off and then what happens is those alternative media sources such as
[03:47:50.920 --> 03:47:54.920]  Alex or other people who broadcast over the internet and listen to quite a few
[03:47:54.920 --> 03:47:58.720]  shows on GCN and and they all do the same thing they all broadcast over the
[03:47:58.720 --> 03:48:03.760]  internet the same way now all that all it has to happen is one little switch or
[03:48:03.760 --> 03:48:09.240]  one little wire gets cut or one one relay gets knocked down or whatever happens
[03:48:09.240 --> 03:48:14.480]  I understand yeah well I can tell you don't don't give up you know don't give
[03:48:14.480 --> 03:48:19.160]  up your pen and paper don't give up your DVDs you know we have ways to pass
[03:48:19.160 --> 03:48:22.360]  information around they had committees of correspondents during the American
[03:48:22.360 --> 03:48:25.960]  Revolutionary War just because they remove this technology it will make
[03:48:25.960 --> 03:48:30.000]  things slower but it will make the messages that go around all the more
[03:48:30.000 --> 03:48:34.280]  powerful yes they can pull those plugs we've seen China enact what they call
[03:48:34.280 --> 03:48:37.960]  the Great Firewall of China where they selectively shut down traffic from a
[03:48:37.960 --> 03:48:43.080]  given area they think this coming in or selectively set shut down websites is
[03:48:43.080 --> 03:48:47.120]  one of the reasons that I was so concerned when Donald Trump talked about
[03:48:47.120 --> 03:48:51.400]  selectively shutting down parts of the internet that is an incredibly dangerous
[03:48:51.400 --> 03:48:55.880]  thing that he's playing with so we do not want a Chinese style censorship we
[03:48:55.880 --> 03:48:59.200]  do not want the Great Firewall but we understand that yes the government
[03:48:59.200 --> 03:49:03.880]  created the internet that was something that was a DARPA invention that goes
[03:49:03.880 --> 03:49:07.960]  back to their intention and you know who invented it it was a psychologist that
[03:49:07.960 --> 03:49:12.680]  was working for DARPA it was set up as a control technique but we took control of
[03:49:12.680 --> 03:49:16.480]  it they never expected for freedom to break out in the way that it has and so
[03:49:16.480 --> 03:49:20.280]  it's been a massive tool of free speech of people being able to go back and look
[03:49:20.280 --> 03:49:24.640]  at the archives see what has been said in the past compare that to what they're
[03:49:24.640 --> 03:49:28.280]  telling you now talk to each other communicate with each other set up that
[03:49:28.280 --> 03:49:32.280]  kind of correspondence person to person so we have gone around their control
[03:49:32.280 --> 03:49:36.640]  grid and we will go around whatever kind of control grid they want to set up and
[03:49:36.640 --> 03:49:41.040]  that's the important thing to understand I'll say to you Tim don't be afraid of
[03:49:41.040 --> 03:49:44.440]  the fact that they're tracking you yes they are tracking you and if you if you
[03:49:44.440 --> 03:49:49.000]  let that intimidate you you will lose when you stand up to them you will win so
[03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:54.880]  do not let that intimidate you go ahead right right now I agree I agree a hundred
[03:49:54.880 --> 03:50:00.240]  percent now I I mean I'm nervous about it but I'm also I mean as I said yes
[03:50:00.240 --> 03:50:05.680]  you're saying slightly afraid about it too but at the same time I know that the
[03:50:05.680 --> 03:50:10.400]  freedom fight has to go on no matter if if it's one greenest and or an entire
[03:50:10.400 --> 03:50:15.200]  truckload of sand being dumped on the globalist of truth I mean as far as
[03:50:15.200 --> 03:50:20.960]  dissemination of information we need to be able to do that in a timely manner
[03:50:20.960 --> 03:50:23.960]  we need to be able to do it okay something happened we need to tell
[03:50:23.960 --> 03:50:29.120]  people about this as soon as possible okay but if it takes a few weeks to get
[03:50:29.120 --> 03:50:33.440]  the information out to people sometimes the information is lost it's lost its
[03:50:33.440 --> 03:50:37.800]  strength it's lost its ability to change anything yes thank you Tim and we got to
[03:50:37.800 --> 03:50:40.800]  break but I'll just tell people real quickly when the wake-up situation was
[03:50:40.800 --> 03:50:43.920]  happening we I didn't have internet we had bulletin boards and you would have
[03:50:43.920 --> 03:50:47.960]  to log on to some guy's bulletin board pull the messages that were there and
[03:50:47.960 --> 03:50:51.720]  then you would kind of pass it like a bread crumb down to another bulletin
[03:50:51.720 --> 03:50:55.000]  board and so it would do this daisy chaining I wasn't in Texas like Alex
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:58.960]  Jones Alex Jones went there but I was getting my information that way I still
[03:50:58.960 --> 03:51:03.360]  got the information we'll be right back on whiskey and at 42 years old I suffered
[03:51:03.360 --> 03:51:07.560]  a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my
[03:51:07.560 --> 03:51:14.320]  life what did I do I created Extendivite a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs

[03:54:12.880 --> 03:54:25.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show we've got one more segment here and I want to continue with what we were talking about with the last caller and that is how they try to intimidate us and to not opposing them and of course that's a very.
[03:54:25.880 --> 03:54:32.880]  openly overtly stated goal of unconventional warfare if you look at what the.
[03:54:32.880 --> 03:54:43.880]  The military does in terms of their psyops they talk about unconventional warfare is essentially to try to identify people who will resist you intimidate them into standing down and so we have to not.
[03:54:43.880 --> 03:54:55.880]  Give into that I want to get back to that before I do I want to let you know real quickly that if you want to get a subscription prison planet TV and support our operation right now we are giving you.
[03:54:55.880 --> 03:55:06.880]  Six months for free that's the best special we've ever had at the end of year Alex always does an end of year special for prison planet TV usually it's been four months or five months this time it's six months that works out to just 10 cents a day.
[03:55:06.880 --> 03:55:14.880]  Now that supports our operation it supports reporters like me jacquard jackson leon macadoo rob do dare McBreen all of us and all the support crew behind the scenes.
[03:55:14.880 --> 03:55:24.880]  But it also gives you access to all of Alex Jones's documentaries that's a great way to wake people up if you want to get people give them a perspective as to what's going on because we can only.
[03:55:24.880 --> 03:55:30.880]  Cover bits and pieces of this as we're going through to get a real background on a particular topic.
[03:55:30.880 --> 03:55:36.880]  It's great to have a documentary and so Alex has got a lot of documentaries there you can see all those documentaries in HD.
[03:55:36.880 --> 03:55:52.880]  You can get the ebooks of special reports that are there and of course you can watch that even on Roku and boxy and HD as is happening on prison planet TV and get the archives all of that for just 10 cents a day and you support our operation at the same time.
[03:55:52.880 --> 03:56:02.880]  Now getting back to what we were just talking about the way they're intimidating people and Alex talked about this a good bit earlier and this whole thing that's going on in China the fact that they would give you a credit score.
[03:56:02.880 --> 03:56:11.880]  Remember when you're in school they always say you know that's going to put that on your your permanent record be careful you know oh my permanent record oh please don't do that.
[03:56:11.880 --> 03:56:24.880]  That kind of intimidation they're always trying to do that so now they're going to give you a credit score but they're also going to credit give you a credit score for not just whether you pay back what you borrow but the kinds of things that you buy.
[03:56:24.880 --> 03:56:38.880]  You know do you buy video games or do you buy things that they want you to buy like durable goods and that sort of thing they credit score credit that differently they also will give you a different kind of a score if you start talking about politics but here's the most insidious part of it.
[03:56:38.880 --> 03:56:50.880]  If you have friends who are putting out information and political opinions that they don't like that will impact your score see that intimidating you making you guilty by association.
[03:56:50.880 --> 03:57:06.880]  You know when I started seeing this about yeah this this is so much what I've seen in Asian societies even a freer society like Japan we have a lot of Asian friends back in North Carolina and one of them from Japan and she said they had a an expression there.
[03:57:06.880 --> 03:57:25.880]  The nail that sticks up gets hammered down okay don't stand out in a crowd folks that's the message to the Japanese people and even though they have a much freer more open society there's a tremendous amount of peer pressure to make people conform to what is the societal norm.
[03:57:25.880 --> 03:57:36.880]  When we adopted my daughter from China she was with a foster family for the last six months that she was there we adopted her as an older child she spent several years in an orphanage.
[03:57:36.880 --> 03:57:54.880]  And then the last six months they put her in a foster home and when they brought her to be adopted they gave her a letter and it was to be read to her and of course it was written in Chinese we got somebody there to translate for and it was their advice to her.
[03:57:54.880 --> 03:58:02.880]  The fatherly advice from her Chinese foster dad and it was be a good servant to the government.
[03:58:02.880 --> 03:58:14.880]  That was her his advice to her be a good servant to the government that's their mindset and I went hysterical laughing I said they gave her to the wrong dad she's going to get a very different story from me.
[03:58:14.880 --> 03:58:19.880]  That's it for today's broadcast join us tomorrow and join us tonight for the Info Wars Nightly News.
