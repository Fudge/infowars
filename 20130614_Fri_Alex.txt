[00:00.000 --> 00:12.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.120 --> 00:38.760]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:38.760 --> 00:47.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, the 14th day of June, 2013. And this rarely happens,
[00:47.240 --> 00:53.320]  but I'm here to tell you, the news I've got in front of me is absolutely off the chart
[00:53.320 --> 01:03.800]  important. Militarily, economically, everything I've got to go through all of the 15 plus
[01:03.800 --> 01:11.400]  stacks of news I've got here, all of it, is so incredibly illustrative of what we face.
[01:11.400 --> 01:16.560]  And that's the key, is getting the general public to not be distracted by how the establishment
[01:16.560 --> 01:23.360]  spends stories, but to get the public to understand the news behind the news. The rest of the
[01:23.360 --> 01:27.240]  story, as Paul Harvey, good day, would say.
[01:27.240 --> 01:33.200]  I mean, look at Drudge Report today. Look at this headline. War, US military support
[01:33.200 --> 01:45.080]  for Syrian rebels, no fly zone. Syrian rebels pledge loyalty to Al-Qaeda USA today. Now,
[01:45.080 --> 01:52.120]  I've been telling you that for two years, plus that it is Al-Qaeda forces. Then you
[01:52.120 --> 01:59.400]  go up here. Spy agencies swap data with thousands of firms. Ladies and gentlemen, that's the
[01:59.400 --> 02:05.080]  Telecommunications Act of 96. That's what they bragged about in the New York Times in
[02:05.080 --> 02:06.080]  2001.
[02:06.080 --> 02:10.080]  I'm gonna get into that. They've tried to roll all this out to the public before. It's
[02:10.080 --> 02:17.080]  all going on illegally. They're just doing it, and it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:17.080 --> 02:25.360]  Nothing, I mean, not even 1% of it. It is about Fortune 100 firms that lobbied the government
[02:25.360 --> 02:31.120]  to build it, and they got paid to build it. They made money building it, and then now
[02:31.120 --> 02:33.800]  they have got the corner on the entire market.
[02:33.800 --> 02:39.640]  The stock market's rigged, the interest rates are rigged, the fuel prices are rigged. Everything
[02:39.640 --> 02:44.960]  is a rigged economy in the United Kingdom, the US, and Europe to a great extent. And
[02:44.960 --> 02:49.240]  they're shutting down all their competition using regulators and using surveillance systems
[02:49.240 --> 02:57.400]  to game all of the infrastructure to take over. And they brag about that. The NSA is
[02:57.400 --> 02:59.920]  there to kill freedom.
[02:59.920 --> 03:05.520]  The NSA is there to bring in Agenda 21. The NSA is there with these giant computer programs
[03:05.520 --> 03:14.020]  to consolidate power. And finally, Zero Hedge, Business Insider, I even saw a Reuters article
[03:14.020 --> 03:18.080]  mentioning it. People are going, wait a minute, you mean they're using this for business?
[03:18.080 --> 03:24.840]  That's an unfair trade advantage. Really? Really? You pay to be spied on. You're like,
[03:24.840 --> 03:28.560]  well, there's nothing to hide. Your info can be used against you. You have nothing to hide,
[03:28.560 --> 03:32.400]  so you put photos of yourself on Facebook and say, by the way, I'm going to the Bahamas
[03:32.400 --> 03:33.400]  for a week.
[03:33.400 --> 03:37.360]  And thieves find out where you live and rob your house. You had nothing to hide cuz you're
[03:37.360 --> 03:45.260]  not a bad person, dummy. The bad people want your info. What is your problem? That is why
[03:45.260 --> 03:54.360]  this is a felony. And again, ladies and gentlemen, I'd love to say I was psychic to know all
[03:54.360 --> 04:00.480]  this stuff. I'm not. I know human nature, I know history, and I study the funding of
[04:00.480 --> 04:03.480]  these infrastructures and the groups that are lobbying.
[04:03.480 --> 04:08.240]  They've got over 100 firms lobbying 24 seven to get rid of all our rights and turn over
[04:08.240 --> 04:13.640]  the computer systems to them and they get paid to spy on us and share it with everybody.
[04:13.640 --> 04:20.200]  They are a bunch of ruthless gangsters and thugs. I've gone to a smart growth conference.
[04:20.200 --> 04:23.720]  I've gone to several, but back in like 1998 in Austin, and they were just standing around
[04:23.720 --> 04:28.080]  thousands of them, business corporate leaders going, we're gonna rob everybody, shut everybody's
[04:28.080 --> 04:30.280]  business down but us and take over.
[04:30.280 --> 04:35.960]  I thought, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, and I'm sitting there going, I walk over to
[04:35.960 --> 04:40.920]  a famous Dallas cowboy just giving a speech about how they were taking over. And I said,
[04:40.920 --> 04:45.200]  why are you talking like this way? Of course, no filming was allowed in there. And he goes,
[04:45.200 --> 04:50.280]  get out of my way and just shoved me out of the way with crazed eyes just like yeah, America's
[04:50.280 --> 04:51.280]  ours.
[04:51.280 --> 04:57.280]  And the public are a bunch of sheep thinking this is to protect them from terrorists. Tell
[04:57.280 --> 05:04.280]  already starts. Give me a break. Introducing pro one all of your filtration in one system

[08:01.360 --> 08:26.680]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:26.680 --> 08:35.440]  It's Friday, 14th day of June, 2013. I'm your host Alex Jones, former Minnesota governor
[08:35.440 --> 08:43.880]  and a good friend of mine Jesse Ventura will be joining us coming up in the second hour
[08:43.880 --> 08:51.720]  of worldwide transmission but it will be news and phone calls the rest of the time. Alright,
[08:51.720 --> 08:58.560]  where to begin? Here is what we're going to be breaking down and covering today.
[08:58.560 --> 09:06.600]  Obviously, we told you the word came from our sources that Bilderberg was going to go
[09:06.600 --> 09:12.400]  ahead and give the order to publicly drop the hammer on their two plus year war against
[09:12.400 --> 09:17.880]  the sovereign nation of Syria using Al-Qaeda. And we're going to move forward with a no
[09:17.880 --> 09:26.720]  fly zone and a kinetic energy action known as a Nobel Prize bombing campaign. Properly
[09:26.720 --> 09:34.240]  Orwellian termed. And Obama has made that announcement at the White House. He has his
[09:34.240 --> 09:40.120]  fiction writer, that's an article up on Infowars.com. That's who they hired. That's the fellow that
[09:40.120 --> 09:46.500]  came up with the term kinetic energy action. They had a fiction writer write up the new
[09:46.500 --> 09:50.040]  evidence of chemical weapons claim.
[09:50.040 --> 09:55.320]  Headline, man behind Syrian chemical weapons claim is fiction writer who ran Benghazi cover
[09:55.320 --> 10:01.720]  up. And Paul Watson has the other article up there, arrest Obama under NDAA for supporting
[10:01.720 --> 10:10.760]  terrorists in Syria. And that sounds bizarro because it is bizarro. Truth is more bizarro
[10:10.760 --> 10:18.680]  than anything Marvel Comics could come up with. And I'm gonna go over those headlines
[10:18.680 --> 10:21.880]  here in just a moment.
[10:21.880 --> 10:25.860]  This is unprecedented what's happening and the Russians are gonna pour more weapons and
[10:25.860 --> 10:32.040]  troops in. So this is basically a war with Russia, with global banks using the United
[10:32.040 --> 10:37.600]  States for a worldwide destabilization, which they can use as the political distraction
[10:37.600 --> 10:44.480]  to implode major currencies and further loot treasuries in banker bailout programs.
[10:44.480 --> 10:49.480]  You have to understand, it's globalist above the nations playing us off against each other
[10:49.480 --> 10:54.120]  and controlling criminal networks. And Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shafer, who's got some of
[10:54.120 --> 10:59.940]  the highest security clearances possible, concur with my analysis yesterday. Showed
[10:59.940 --> 11:05.240]  it General Hamid Gul, the former head of Pakistani intelligence that led the CIA funded war against
[11:05.240 --> 11:11.080]  the Russians. He beat the Russians with about 1% of the firepower.
[11:11.080 --> 11:17.520]  He came on yesterday from Pakistan and concur with my analysis 100% because we know what's
[11:17.520 --> 11:22.120]  going on. Here's what's frustrating. This stuff is not hidden. This is hiding in plain
[11:22.120 --> 11:29.680]  view. And it's not up for interpretation what's going on. The most lawless, bizarre, openly
[11:29.680 --> 11:32.360]  criminal actions are going on right now.
[11:32.360 --> 11:37.300]  Our so called governments run by foreign banks. It ships in narcotics publicly, launders the
[11:37.300 --> 11:43.640]  money publicly. Publicly says they'll disappear and arrest any US citizens they want. Publicly
[11:43.640 --> 11:48.180]  spies on everything we're doing to have economic advantage against grassroots companies. That's
[11:48.180 --> 11:51.160]  now finally in the news.
[11:51.160 --> 11:56.900]  Is waging war on the family. They're having lesbian gay meetings with children as the
[11:56.900 --> 12:06.440]  presenters against sexualizing children. It is just unbelievable how it's all over the
[12:06.440 --> 12:17.340]  top. This is a criminal, globalist, anti-human revolution taking place against the people
[12:17.340 --> 12:23.480]  of the world. This is scientifically being done to short circuit our normal human programming
[12:23.480 --> 12:25.880]  that's designed for survival.
[12:25.880 --> 12:31.240]  So we've got all of that news coming up. We've got Obama swearing to kill the Keystone Pipeline
[12:31.240 --> 12:36.800]  again and to shut off US power grids. Obama tells Keystone foes he will unveil climate
[12:36.800 --> 12:41.280]  measures. He already did it. He already upped the carbon tax that Congress wouldn't pass,
[12:41.280 --> 12:42.280]  but is already in place.
[12:42.280 --> 12:46.460]  He just upped it and the money goes directly to him and the Rothschilds. I mean, it is
[12:46.460 --> 12:56.760]  just absolutely, totally unprecedented. Imagine if they had a event at the White House for
[12:56.760 --> 13:03.200]  say a movement for women to be able to go topless, it's still sexual. And they had little
[13:03.200 --> 13:05.200]  kids do the presentation.
[13:05.200 --> 13:09.080]  You'd be like, why do you got kids involved with something sexual? Maybe you can have
[13:09.080 --> 13:15.160]  kids deliver you the shrimp and sirloin at the topless bar. It's like, well, it's no
[13:15.160 --> 13:21.360]  big deal. We have kids delivering you your drink at the topless bar. They've got their
[13:21.360 --> 13:23.320]  clothes on, so it's okay.
[13:23.320 --> 13:29.160]  Again, it's sexualizing children just like Jocelyn Elders, saying we've got to reach
[13:29.160 --> 13:35.720]  down and help the five year olds. Remember those clips? You're like, what is this about?
[13:35.720 --> 13:40.980]  If they can take your kids at age five and teach them about sex, they can do anything.
[13:40.980 --> 13:45.720]  They want in your life, your kids belong to them. They run TV ads on MSNBC saying your
[13:45.720 --> 13:50.840]  kids aren't yours, they're the states. In Germany and many other countries of Europe,
[13:50.840 --> 13:55.840]  they take your kids if you try to homeschool.
[13:55.840 --> 14:00.260]  On every sitcom drama show, they demonize homeschoolers. They're coming for those of
[14:00.260 --> 14:06.620]  us that have not been fully absorbed into their program. This is a global scientific
[14:06.620 --> 14:13.080]  Borg takeover in their words. They say we will be assimilated, and I say they can go
[14:13.080 --> 14:24.920]  to Hades. Now, let me go over something here for you. I told you about 1,000 times conservatively,
[14:24.920 --> 14:29.600]  and we wrote articles about it, and we talked about it, and I'm not asking for credit.
[14:29.600 --> 14:37.580]  I'm asking for people to understand why I get so angry and why I'm begging you to get
[14:37.580 --> 14:48.240]  more active. The NSA was always set up to steal your personal data and to spy on small
[14:48.240 --> 14:53.940]  companies and mid-sized corporations to then hand their developments and innovations over
[14:53.940 --> 15:00.600]  to foreign-based operations and to move those programs in the last 30 years to China. And
[15:00.600 --> 15:04.540]  I was told that by NSA people.
[15:04.540 --> 15:09.160]  I'm just gonna leave it at that, and I really don't wanna talk about this. You see the atmosphere
[15:09.160 --> 15:14.640]  of persecution and things that are going on. But I'm on record, you know, wherever it came
[15:14.640 --> 15:26.060]  from, I told you, okay? I told you. I mean, I had former top CIA briefers to Ronald Reagan
[15:26.060 --> 15:27.060]  on the show.
[15:27.060 --> 15:31.360]  I get the head of Pakistani intelligence and the former top general on. I mean, those are
[15:31.360 --> 15:36.520]  not the only sources we've got, ladies and gentlemen. But it's also come out in publications
[15:36.520 --> 15:44.160]  in the last 20 years that I've been deep in study 18 years on air. It is a fact that if
[15:44.160 --> 15:49.300]  you don't have privacy, you don't have freedom and you're a slave.
[15:49.300 --> 15:54.960]  The idea that you have privacy because you're hiding something is a fraud. You have privacy
[15:54.960 --> 16:00.660]  because bad people will use your lack of privacy to enslave you. So we're gonna be getting
[16:00.660 --> 16:05.440]  to that at the bottom of the hour. And again, I'll use the example you've heard of the thousands
[16:05.440 --> 16:09.580]  of reported robberies where people are dumb enough to post their address on Facebook or
[16:09.580 --> 16:14.840]  generally where they live. And then to show their Christmas presents they got in some
[16:14.840 --> 16:18.160]  narcissistic moron exercise.
[16:18.160 --> 16:24.160]  And then they get robbed. Now, that just gives you an idea of why privacy is important. Why
[16:24.160 --> 16:27.240]  does the government want privacy when it's the only group that's not supposed to have
[16:27.240 --> 16:32.020]  it to commit all their crimes and things? So from their perspective, it is because they're
[16:32.020 --> 16:38.760]  doing a lot of bad things. But the individual has maximum privacy unless there is a person
[16:38.760 --> 16:43.120]  swearing an oath on record so they can be faced as the accuser.
[16:43.120 --> 16:48.040]  And so they can be arrested if they file a false report, listing the person, place, papers
[16:48.040 --> 16:52.800]  and effects that are going to be searched and specifically why. Here's the warrant,
[16:52.800 --> 16:58.340]  we're here to search because a witness said they saw you putting a body in a trunk in
[16:58.340 --> 17:06.200]  your basement. And they go down into the basement to look for the trunk. That's a warrant. Or
[17:06.200 --> 17:10.680]  we have sworn witnesses that you're conducting drug deals on the phone and they bought drugs
[17:10.680 --> 17:13.680]  from you and arranged for it over the phone.
[17:13.680 --> 17:20.200]  They have sworn they're on record and we are coming to tap your phone to see if that's
[17:20.200 --> 17:26.980]  the case. This is the type of warrants they get from a judge. People said, well, let's
[17:26.980 --> 17:34.620]  make the people given the tip secret. So they'll be safe and then they can now have all these
[17:34.620 --> 17:40.160]  felons and people that they're hiring for the police forces and the State Department
[17:40.160 --> 17:43.680]  and the TSA on purpose, it's a criminal takeover.
[17:43.680 --> 17:48.240]  They can now just say they saw the insurance salesman down the block sell drugs and the
[17:48.240 --> 17:51.920]  cops come to his house and gun him down and then take the house and no drugs are found.
[17:51.920 --> 17:59.680]  So what? I mean, this is the type of world we're entering into here. And now it's coming
[17:59.680 --> 18:03.280]  out that they're fixing the stocks, the bonds, they're shutting down their competition.
[18:03.280 --> 18:08.260]  They're gaming with flash trades, they're gaming with interest rate fixing. They know
[18:08.260 --> 18:10.640]  how the public's gonna move, what they're gonna do.
[18:10.640 --> 18:16.560]  It's all an unfair trade advantage and that's what the Fortune 100 have and they get paid
[18:16.560 --> 18:23.560]  to build the spy grid. 90 plus percent on record of the spy grid in the Western world
[18:23.560 --> 18:29.440]  is run by private law firms, private groups. And they can walk in and dial in and listen
[18:29.440 --> 18:35.180]  to your phone. They can go and dial in and turn on your TiVo and watch you now coming
[18:35.180 --> 18:36.240]  out with cameras.
[18:36.240 --> 18:40.920]  They can dial in your computer. And when the national press is here, they always go, why
[18:40.920 --> 18:46.360]  are the cameras on your computers covered? And I go, well, there's onboard microphones
[18:46.360 --> 18:51.500]  we can't turn off, but they have AI computers that dial in and watch and listen and they'll
[18:51.500 --> 18:52.500]  laugh at me.
[18:52.500 --> 18:56.400]  I had Nightline laugh at me when they were here. They're like, really, Alex? I was like,
[18:56.400 --> 19:02.120]  you know, this is patented on record. And they just wink and go, because they're lying
[19:02.120 --> 19:08.640]  to themselves. It's like a funny joke or something. Look, this isn't a funny joke. The FEMA camps
[19:08.640 --> 19:13.100]  are public.
[19:13.100 --> 19:17.760]  The Emergency Centers Establishment Act, all of this is on record. The civilian inmate
[19:17.760 --> 19:23.320]  labor camp program, they are gearing up for the total collapse and the arrest of at least
[19:23.320 --> 19:29.200]  8 million Americans to be sent to reeducation camps and many of us are to be killed. And
[19:29.200 --> 19:31.040]  they're training to do that.
[19:31.040 --> 19:36.200]  Now, that's all on record, by the way. This is a treasonous criminal military industrial
[19:36.200 --> 19:42.040]  complex run by foreign banks spying on everything you do to be able to predict the future and
[19:42.040 --> 19:47.640]  game you and your family and rob you and set up financial actuaries where it's impossible
[19:47.640 --> 19:51.520]  for somebody that plays by the rules to make it in society.
[19:51.520 --> 19:57.620]  Our society is run by the worst of the worst of the worst criminals. And being a nice guy
[19:57.620 --> 20:02.320]  is being a schmuck. You understand?
[20:02.320 --> 20:09.000]  Time and time again. You need to come here and help us. We need assistance, please. Those
[20:09.000 --> 20:14.740]  we should be able to depend on, let us down. Federal and state and local officials saying
[20:14.740 --> 20:19.920]  help is on the way. Well, the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me. Don't depend on the
[20:19.920 --> 20:25.120]  government to save you. Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster

[21:38.920 --> 21:42.680]  debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[21:42.680 --> 21:46.440]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army. Hi, Ted

[23:01.800 --> 23:07.280]  book cancer step outside the box. I want you to know some very important information. In
[23:07.280 --> 23:12.760]  1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivore be sent directly to the White House
[23:12.760 --> 23:18.720]  at a time when only the president could obtain this world class healer. Now, 27 years later,
[23:18.720 --> 23:22.780]  carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect
[23:22.780 --> 23:28.280]  yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds

[23:37.040 --> 23:43.560]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body. Call 1-866-VenusFly or

[23:59.560 --> 24:19.640]  All right, coming up, I'm going to break down militarily what may happen if this war intensifies
[24:19.640 --> 24:26.040]  in Syria. Notice the establishment has such incredible disdain for the public. They're
[24:26.040 --> 24:32.360]  just now saying they may arm the rebels when on record, Congress has appropriated over
[24:32.360 --> 24:36.980]  a billion dollars the last two years to the rebels.
[24:36.980 --> 24:42.840]  And they've shipped massive weapons out of Benghazi, including heat sinking missiles,
[24:42.840 --> 24:48.600]  roughly 10,000 of those, 8,000 other surface to air missiles, anti aircraft missiles into
[24:48.600 --> 24:58.640]  Syria. Turkey, off and on, bombards different areas of the country with heavy howitzer cannons.
[24:58.640 --> 25:06.040]  But that's not a war because Obama's black and liberal. And he got a peace prize. I say
[25:06.040 --> 25:12.760]  give him like 10 more. I mean, why not? So all of that's coming up. But I'm also going
[25:12.760 --> 25:17.880]  to get deeply into how the NSA really works with you here. And it's now all being admitted.
[25:17.880 --> 25:21.940]  Unfair trade where the insiders get to know everything about you and everything about
[25:21.940 --> 25:26.080]  your business and everybody you're talking to and what deals you're going to make. And
[25:26.080 --> 25:29.960]  so they can call regulators and have them shut you down.
[25:29.960 --> 25:33.680]  Doesn't matter if it's legal. I mean, people wonder why. We discovered our honeybees became
[25:33.680 --> 25:38.540]  immune to the Roundup pesticide, and that's what's killing them. Top bee biologist tells
[25:38.540 --> 25:44.560]  his colleague, get SWAT team two days later. That happened in Illinois because your phones
[25:44.560 --> 25:51.540]  are being listened to, folks. And a company is going to test and prove that a GMO is what's
[25:51.540 --> 25:54.440]  causing brain damage in children.
[25:54.440 --> 25:58.480]  And then they get a call by Monsanto lawyers saying we're going to sue you. And they go,
[25:58.480 --> 26:01.860]  we just decided to do this test three days ago. How do you know? And they go, just know
[26:01.860 --> 26:11.100]  you've been warned, punk. They, Monsanto and hundreds of companies have everything. I want
[26:11.100 --> 26:18.840]  to explain this to you. Any governor can walk in and dial in and listen to anybody they
[26:18.840 --> 26:19.840]  want.
[26:19.840 --> 26:24.240]  That's why they've had governors before go, yeah, when I want to find my wife, I just
[26:24.240 --> 26:28.060]  go to the system and type in her number and it pops up. And that was 10 years ago before
[26:28.060 --> 26:32.760]  that was open news. You think you can just choose to put the function on and find somebody
[26:32.760 --> 26:33.760]  with their phone?
[26:33.760 --> 26:38.760]  No, no, no, no, no. Everything you're doing is being tracked, folks. And it's bad people
[26:38.760 --> 26:46.780]  that have the data. Same reason you don't go post where you live on Facebook and say,
[26:46.780 --> 26:52.960]  by the way, in my safe, I've got my wife's jewelry and here's the passcode. It's not
[26:52.960 --> 26:57.240]  because you're a criminal that you hide that info.
[26:57.240 --> 27:02.500]  Why do I lock my door? Do I lock my door at night because my kids are my captives? That's
[27:02.500 --> 27:05.720]  how the government would spin it. No, no, I lock it because it's just another level
[27:05.720 --> 27:10.200]  of security. Somebody has got to now break in and that gives me a heads up to get to
[27:10.200 --> 27:11.200]  a firearm.
[27:11.200 --> 27:20.060]  And I don't do that because I live in fear. I do that because I live in power. I do that
[27:20.060 --> 27:25.320]  because I'm a survivor. I'm not a schmuck. I'm not a sucker. I'm not a goofball. I'm
[27:25.320 --> 27:29.880]  not an idiot. I'm not a mark. I'm not here to be run over. I'm not here to be a slave.
[27:29.880 --> 27:34.920]  I'm here to be informed, dynamic, involved, empowering myself and others.
[27:34.920 --> 27:42.360]  I'm here to breathe air and have red blood pumped through my big fat red heart. And I'm
[27:42.360 --> 27:46.280]  here to have children and I'm here to build a civilization. And I'm here to watch them
[27:46.280 --> 27:51.000]  have grandchildren. And if I'm blessed to see great grandchildren and then to die, but
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.680]  to have what I did for humanity go forward.
[27:53.680 --> 27:59.800]  And that's what you're here for. Not to have a bunch of crooks ruling over us and siphoning
[27:59.800 --> 28:05.260]  our energy off for themselves so they can play God. Now you got a decision, humanity,
[28:05.260 --> 28:10.920]  what are you gonna do? Look at this article, USA Today. USA Today, right here. I wanna
[28:10.920 --> 28:13.680]  go out and actually buy the newspaper so we have this.
[28:13.680 --> 28:20.920]  Right here, document cam, please. Syrian rebels pledge loyalty to Al-Qaeda and it goes on
[28:20.920 --> 28:26.500]  that the main force, already told you this, 60, 70% is Al-Qaeda in Al-Qaeda uniforms with
[28:26.500 --> 28:31.600]  Al-Qaeda banners. And they go around chopping Christians heads off and blowing up synagogues
[28:31.600 --> 28:34.880]  and murdering minority Muslim groups in mass.
[28:34.880 --> 28:38.600]  There's articles out today, and now they're just having it in the mainstream news. For
[28:38.600 --> 28:43.560]  two years, I've exposed this, well, really three of you count Libya. It's all been admitted,
[28:43.560 --> 28:49.160]  but then I get to hear neocons on national radio when I randomly tune in, like I did
[28:49.160 --> 28:54.740]  two days ago, saying Alex Jones is a traitor. He says the government runs Al-Qaeda.
[28:54.740 --> 29:00.800]  And then I hear the same host a month before say Obama runs Al-Qaeda. So even these talk
[29:00.800 --> 29:06.720]  show hosts think you're so dumb, they like can have it both ways. I told you big corporations
[29:06.720 --> 29:16.760]  have the NSA and run the NSA and are the NSA. Time Warner, AT&T, Verizon, Google, Apple,
[29:16.760 --> 29:18.280]  all of them are in telecommunications.
[29:18.280 --> 29:23.760]  They are the government. Explain that to you when we come back, okay? But here it is, USA
[29:23.760 --> 29:30.720]  here's another one about how the main force is Al-Qaeda. And then there's Paul Watson's
[29:30.720 --> 29:34.760]  headline, arrest Obama under NDAA for supporting terrorists in Syria. And we post the law right
[29:34.760 --> 29:41.760]  there section 1021 B2. But of course, that's only for us because they are announcing the
[29:41.760 --> 29:46.720]  main enemy is tea partiers and gun owners. And the military is training to take our guns.
[29:46.720 --> 29:54.720]  Let us in FEMA camps. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the
[29:54.720 --> 30:05.200]  GCN radio network. Hello. I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[30:05.200 --> 30:10.280]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving
[30:10.280 --> 30:15.040]  for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I
[30:15.040 --> 30:20.400]  immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are
[30:20.400 --> 30:25.240]  hundreds of great products at info worst team.com, but I want to point out the three that have
[30:25.240 --> 30:34.120]  helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months. Products like beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland

[32:01.040 --> 32:06.520]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[32:06.520 --> 32:11.760]  and floods raged across the US costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[32:11.760 --> 32:16.040]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight
[32:16.040 --> 32:21.000]  out of mind and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are we all are
[32:21.000 --> 32:25.960]  food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,

[33:20.280 --> 33:26.880]  system wants you captured in its web. The system wants to make people that aren't criminals
[33:26.880 --> 33:31.240]  criminals so they have an excuse to arrest you to put you in jail to take your rights
[33:31.240 --> 33:37.240]  away to suck off of you. This is how modern slavery is being instituted. There's an article
[33:37.240 --> 33:46.520]  up on info wars.com by Kurt Nemo about tea party governor makes a bong possession a felony
[33:46.520 --> 33:51.880]  a water pipe, something that people smoke marijuana out of something that's popular
[33:51.880 --> 33:57.560]  in Austin bars that they smoke tobacco out of.
[33:57.560 --> 34:03.800]  And they're going to put you in jail for seven years for it. Because that's how the parasites
[34:03.800 --> 34:14.520]  feed off of you while all the real criminals go free. Boy, that sounds so libertarian.
[34:14.520 --> 34:20.000]  So incredibly libertarian to me. That's going on in Florida and other states moves like
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.240]  that. So that's the type of news we've got coming up before I get back into the fact
[34:24.240 --> 34:29.600]  that it's now all over the news that al Qaeda is being given missiles and weapons.
[34:29.600 --> 34:34.860]  And they go, don't worry, we will make sure the good rebels get it. It's led by Saudi
[34:34.860 --> 34:41.320]  Arabia that is al Qaeda. It's the Saudi Arabian government that funds al Qaeda. 15 of the
[34:41.320 --> 34:47.680]  19 hijackers came from there. And the FBI director is out saying, Snowden's leak may
[34:47.680 --> 34:54.800]  let terrorists hit us. Give me a break, Director Mueller.
[34:54.800 --> 34:59.960]  I've interviewed the head of the US Embassy Visa Section, Mr. Springman. He's been in
[34:59.960 --> 35:05.720]  national news as well, back in 2001 and 2002. They were ordered to let the 15 hijackers
[35:05.720 --> 35:12.240]  in who were listed as al Qaeda. And they were told these are CIA agents, not operatives,
[35:12.240 --> 35:19.440]  agents. And they were CIA agents. Mohammed Atta, all of them were trained at the Pensacola
[35:19.440 --> 35:22.600]  Naval Air Station and also at the Defense Language School.
[35:22.600 --> 35:26.840]  And you know how we know that? The head of the Defense Language School, Lieutenant Colonel
[35:26.840 --> 35:33.300]  Butler went public two weeks after 9-11 in an article that the Associated Press even
[35:33.300 --> 35:40.920]  picked up saying, I don't know exactly what's going on, but these guys are government agents.
[35:40.920 --> 35:48.280]  Mohammed Atta was in his course for a year. In the head of the schools, the dean, he was
[35:48.280 --> 35:55.920]  the dean, he taught classes. And five of the hijackers were in his class. He knew them,
[35:55.920 --> 36:01.920]  he had lunch with them, he shook their hands. And they were set up. And as best we can tell
[36:01.920 --> 36:07.800]  from the real air phone calls, gas was released on the aircraft.
[36:07.800 --> 36:13.040]  There was no let's roll, all of that is pure bull, ladies and gentlemen. The military refused
[36:13.040 --> 36:19.520]  to stand down and shot down the flight over Pennsylvania. And we even know what squadron
[36:19.520 --> 36:26.140]  did it. The happy hooligans out of North Dakota who were stationed in Virginia at the time
[36:26.140 --> 36:34.000]  for drills. And when we interviewed a colonel on that, my source, he died two weeks after
[36:34.000 --> 36:40.300]  he came on the show. A lot of dead people we talked to, they die after they come on
[36:40.300 --> 36:41.300]  the show.
[36:41.300 --> 36:47.660]  You want me to keep going here? This broadcast is not a game, folks. It's not a joke. I'm
[36:47.660 --> 36:51.880]  not a talk show host that says I'm gonna expose FEMA camps. They're real and then builds it
[36:51.880 --> 36:56.220]  up for a month and then comes out and debunks it with straw men. I don't say I've got a
[36:56.220 --> 36:59.000]  big announcement in two days and it doesn't come out.
[36:59.000 --> 37:04.560]  I don't get up here on air and say, our MI5 source and police source said Bilderberg's
[37:04.560 --> 37:09.260]  freaked out. The government's pressuring them to go public. They're gonna go public on BBC
[37:09.260 --> 37:15.980]  Saturday and then it happens four days later. This is a real broadcast. I am a real person.
[37:15.980 --> 37:18.980]  I am a real patriot risking my life, you understand?
[37:18.980 --> 37:24.140]  And I want you to know that so you know there's good guys. I want you to understand also what
[37:24.140 --> 37:33.760]  we risk. Many boffins died to bring you this information. You understand that?
[37:33.760 --> 37:38.640]  We have the schematics of the New World Order. We have the blueprints. We have their program.
[37:38.640 --> 37:42.580]  We know that's how we can tell you what's really going on before it's in the mainstream
[37:42.580 --> 37:57.400]  news. They nerve gassed the people on board those aircraft and flew them in by remote
[37:57.400 --> 37:58.400]  control.
[37:58.400 --> 38:05.060]  Who they are, I don't know, but NORAD's on record being ordered to stand down. Now, do
[38:05.060 --> 38:09.520]  you think things are gonna get better under this government? No, it's gonna get worse,
[38:09.520 --> 38:14.420]  ladies and gentlemen. And it's bigger than George W Bush. It's bigger than Barack H Obama.
[38:14.420 --> 38:19.820]  They're presidents of a corporate arm of the New World Order. And presidents go and play
[38:19.820 --> 38:26.460]  golf and cut red ribbons, folks. It's CEOs and chairman and top strategists that run
[38:26.460 --> 38:27.460]  things.
[38:27.460 --> 38:33.060]  And do you know who those top strategists are? They're the Rand Corporation. They're
[38:33.060 --> 38:37.940]  people like Zbigniew Brzezinski. They're the Carnegie and Ford Foundation. You wanna name
[38:37.940 --> 38:42.500]  names? To come out in congressional hearings, the Carnegie Foundation has been running the
[38:42.500 --> 38:44.860]  country since the early 60s.
[38:44.860 --> 38:48.740]  They were pretty much in control before that. And that's why Eisenhower came in and said,
[38:48.740 --> 38:52.460]  there is a technocratic elite taking over with the military-industrial complex. They've
[38:52.460 --> 39:00.580]  got to be stopped. If somebody drops a book in the background, you hear a slam and the
[39:00.580 --> 39:04.880]  president jumps. Because it's come out in the president's papers that he was deeply
[39:04.880 --> 39:08.180]  disturbed and didn't go with the speech they'd written for him.
[39:08.180 --> 39:15.300]  He went out there and said, beware the military-industrial complex and the rest of the quote, the technocrats
[39:15.300 --> 39:21.160]  that control it. Because even by then, they had come in and said, we wanna blow up stuff.
[39:21.160 --> 39:25.220]  We wanna blame it on foreign enemies. We wanna start World War III. We'll use the nuclear
[39:25.220 --> 39:28.160]  war as an excuse to put martial law in.
[39:28.160 --> 39:33.460]  We're gonna re-engineer humanity, and we're gonna use this Nazi plan for a euro. And Eisenhower
[39:33.460 --> 39:39.780]  went no. By the way, this has all been declassified. Pieces here, pieces there. He said no to North
[39:39.780 --> 39:46.140]  Woods. They brought it to Kennedy a year later. He fired a bunch of them. And I'm not romanticizing
[39:46.140 --> 39:50.060]  Dwight D. Eisenhower.
[39:50.060 --> 39:54.020]  The point is, is that he didn't wanna end humanity. He had grandkids. He didn't wanna
[39:54.020 --> 40:01.300]  be part of a Nazi plan that was really a British plan. Hitler just got a eugenics plan from
[40:01.300 --> 40:05.860]  the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute funded in the 20s and the 30s by the Rockefellers.
[40:05.860 --> 40:10.420]  This is all mainline history, folks. This is why this is happening. That's why this
[40:10.420 --> 40:17.620]  train takes us to a bad place. We need to get off the train. We need to stop the train.
[40:17.620 --> 40:21.940]  We need to dismantle the train. We need to be on a new plan. I don't wanna be governed
[40:21.940 --> 40:29.100]  by this. They think you're so pathetic that they have taken our rights and say they spy
[40:29.100 --> 40:33.060]  on us for Al-Qaeda when they've run Al-Qaeda and created Al-Qaeda.
[40:33.060 --> 40:38.760]  And now they've turned multiple countries over to Al-Qaeda. And the president and leaders
[40:38.760 --> 40:44.860]  in council in Egypt two days ago said, we're preparing for war with Israel and the US while
[40:44.860 --> 40:51.140]  the US gives them F-16s to do it. And you go, why? Is Obama a Muslim? No, he's not a
[40:51.140 --> 40:53.980]  Muslim, folks. Sure, he goes and tells him he is.
[40:53.980 --> 40:58.420]  He went to a madrasa. He was trained as a Muslim, but that's his ultimate cover to cause
[40:58.420 --> 41:05.500]  the clash of civilizations that the September 20th, 2000 PENAC document repeated. It's a
[41:05.500 --> 41:13.860]  decades older plan to create a clash of civilizations between the decadent Christendom, the West,
[41:13.860 --> 41:21.340]  and Islam to destroy both in that cataclysm, out of which a one world religion and mega
[41:21.340 --> 41:29.660]  tyranny will flow. This is the reality that I'm telling you.
[41:29.660 --> 41:37.140]  I'm begging you. And many of you, many university PhDs, many scientists I've talked to, they
[41:37.140 --> 41:40.020]  have now come to the realization, listening to this broadcast, they go, yes, we were taught
[41:40.020 --> 41:43.380]  eugenics, we were taught the master plan. It's true, we've been taught we're the elect
[41:43.380 --> 41:47.600]  elite. There will be a global government established, there will be bioweapon plagues released.
[41:47.600 --> 41:51.460]  Go talk to any university biology head. And if you talk to them calmly, bring this up,
[41:51.460 --> 41:56.460]  they'll say, where did you get this information? That's classified. This is the plan. But now
[41:56.460 --> 42:00.560]  those university heads have got their kids dying, their wife dying young.
[42:00.560 --> 42:04.780]  They're going, wait a minute, the binary weapons systems have been put into the food and water.
[42:04.780 --> 42:09.300]  We're all being targeted as well. That's because they're not gonna kill 80% and then 20% of
[42:09.300 --> 42:14.220]  you are gonna go to Alpha Centuries. They're going to kill everyone. That's what they're
[42:14.220 --> 42:18.500]  telling you, and good people in Hollywood, cuz there's a revolt in Hollywood, are telling
[42:18.500 --> 42:19.500]  you.
[42:19.500 --> 42:29.740]  I've since talked to people that were involved in films like Oblivion. But the Tet is not
[42:29.740 --> 42:34.600]  an alien force, it's a group of humans who see themselves as a split off of humans and
[42:34.600 --> 42:41.500]  have this master plan. The Tet is the Pentagon, the Tet is the New World Order. The Tet is
[42:41.500 --> 42:46.020]  the artificial technocracy that's already 30 years past us.
[42:46.020 --> 42:51.700]  That's why they're so arrogant. They've got bioweapons that will kill every human on Earth.
[42:51.700 --> 42:57.100]  No one has immunity. They have stuff, and again, I'm not trying to scare you folks.
[42:57.100 --> 43:05.860]  The only hope we've got is to have a total human awakening in the human survival instinct.
[43:05.860 --> 43:09.900]  That's why they implant violence in television to condition you it's okay. It's why they
[43:09.900 --> 43:15.380]  tell you humans are bad and ugly and a scourge and teach you it's cool to be self-destructive.
[43:15.380 --> 43:23.220]  So at a subconscious level, you will suppress your hardwired programming to survive, to
[43:23.220 --> 43:25.580]  adapt, to overcome.
[43:25.580 --> 43:29.460]  And they're using your adaptiveness to adapt to your own destruction. They're using your
[43:29.460 --> 43:34.020]  adaptiveness against you to incrementally bring in tyranny so you accept it and slowly
[43:34.020 --> 43:40.620]  die. But I am here consciously on air with this emergency transmission asking you to
[43:40.620 --> 43:47.260]  flip the levers in your own subconscious mind to tell yourself I am in combat.
[43:47.260 --> 43:52.980]  I am under attack. I need a brain boost. I want to become conscious and your brain will
[43:52.980 --> 43:58.500]  start flipping the switches. Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip. Get into war mode, ladies and
[43:58.500 --> 44:04.540]  gentlemen. Get into survival mode and we'll beat these people.
[44:04.540 --> 44:10.340]  Their program is already not going well because of the adaptiveness of humans. You understand
[44:10.340 --> 44:15.580]  it might as well be an alien force, ladies and gentlemen, that we face. And again, their
[44:15.580 --> 44:22.040]  arguments have a lot of validity at certain points about toxic waste systems, dirty industry.
[44:22.040 --> 44:27.820]  There are too many people in certain sectors in biospheres that can't handle it.
[44:27.820 --> 44:32.180]  There are destructive forces in our economy that are wasteful. But then you learn the
[44:32.180 --> 44:37.980]  globalists did all of that to ensure the collapse and the calamity because their full spectrum
[44:37.980 --> 44:43.100]  dominance, they are balancing both of these. But I've studied their operation. They're
[44:43.100 --> 44:48.460]  not even really balancing it. And I can see that their eugenics program, 160-year-old
[44:48.460 --> 44:54.440]  plan has not adapted even if you wanted to agree with them and is going to end up destroying
[44:54.440 --> 45:01.880]  them as well. Because the secret of the universe is what comes around goes around.
[45:01.880 --> 45:09.860]  You reap what you sow. You can call it karma, but I don't mean that in a Hindu fashion.
[45:09.860 --> 45:16.020]  What you do comes back on you. What others do comes back on them. It's all interconnected
[45:16.020 --> 45:22.160]  and the establishment I know is having a debate right now and realizing this and that's a
[45:22.160 --> 45:30.900]  good thing. That's a good thing. You need to make the decision to choose reality. You
[45:30.900 --> 45:34.620]  need to make the decision to choose the truth or we have no future. Now let me blitz through
[45:34.620 --> 45:36.260]  as much news as possible.
[45:36.260 --> 45:40.020]  Document cam please for TV viewers watching on prisonplanet.tv. For radio listeners, I'll
[45:40.020 --> 45:46.020]  be giving you the headlines so you can pull this up for yourself. USA Today cover of it.
[45:46.020 --> 45:51.540]  Syrian rebels pledge loyalty to Al Qaeda as Obama announces billions more in high tech
[45:51.540 --> 45:56.580]  weapon systems. Just remember that when the TSA wants to stick their hands down your wife's
[45:56.580 --> 45:58.220]  pants.
[45:58.220 --> 46:03.800]  Arrest Obama under NDAA for supporting terrorists in Syria. We list the federal law though unconstitutional,
[46:03.800 --> 46:07.020]  the code. I mean, just think of the hiding in plain view that the government runs Al
[46:07.020 --> 46:12.460]  Qaeda. Obama is the global head of Al Qaeda publicly. But meanwhile, they're announcing
[46:12.460 --> 46:16.540]  that Al Qaeda is not the threat now, it's the Tea Party.
[46:16.540 --> 46:20.860]  Man behind Syrian chemical weapons claim is a fiction writer who ran Benghazi cover up.
[46:20.860 --> 46:25.180]  White House makes miraculous discovery to distract from domestic scandals, also in full
[46:25.180 --> 46:32.280]  wars.com. Here's Breitbart, Obama administration considers resettling thousands of Syrian refugees
[46:32.280 --> 46:38.100]  in the US. Yeah, kind of like they brought in, was it 30,000 Iraqi Republican Guard pre-trained
[46:38.100 --> 46:40.260]  by the CIA when Saddam was our ally.
[46:40.260 --> 46:44.020]  To be involved is the backup team to blame if they couldn't deal with the right wing
[46:44.020 --> 46:49.060]  group. They had groups of Iraqis ready to blame. That was even on local news. Just like
[46:49.060 --> 46:53.460]  the same program with the Zarnov brothers, same program. I mean, they just got a shake
[46:53.460 --> 46:56.900]  and bake. Like how do you make these pancakes? Well, you just add milk to these, it's got
[46:56.900 --> 47:02.340]  everything in it. I mean, it's like, it's a shake and bake. I mean, stuff's elementary,
[47:02.340 --> 47:03.340]  folks.
[47:03.340 --> 47:07.740]  Rand Paul, that way they can blow everything up with a good ol', they're gonna bring tens
[47:07.740 --> 47:10.940]  of thousands of Al Qaeda here and they'll probably be in police uniforms before you
[47:10.940 --> 47:16.340]  know it. I'm not joking, by the way. Rand Paul, your taxes fund regimes that kill Christians
[47:16.340 --> 47:22.420]  for blasphemy against Islam. Yep, there's Rand Paul.
[47:22.420 --> 47:28.660]  Is Obama starting a war with Syria just to distract us from the scandals? Yes, the war
[47:28.660 --> 47:35.100]  has already been going on. It should be already a two year war now going public as distraction.
[47:35.100 --> 47:41.220]  Now they're just gonna use it as a false flag and expand it. With scandals raging at home,
[47:41.220 --> 47:44.800]  Obama conveniently discovers chemical weapons used in Syria with no proof.
[47:44.800 --> 47:59.580]  These are just complete liars. Huffington Post, quagmire US arms to Syria. Goes on,
[47:59.580 --> 48:04.180]  video game, cash tea party, patriot groups as enemy terrorists. Every major shoot them
[48:04.180 --> 48:09.300]  up game I've looked at, the new ones coming out are right wingers blow everything up and
[48:09.300 --> 48:11.660]  have to be arrested and put in FEMA camps or executed or tortured.
[48:11.660 --> 48:16.140]  I mean, there's more than eight different games out currently. All the big top sellers
[48:16.140 --> 48:21.740]  where and of course, every time before there's a war, they have a video game. It's all pre-programmed.
[48:21.740 --> 48:26.100]  They're getting ready to maybe even nuke a city and say, Patriot military did it. That's
[48:26.100 --> 48:33.300]  the kind of stuff in these games. So just get ready. Just get ready, okay? The pre-programming
[48:33.300 --> 48:34.660]  is the proof of who's gonna do it.
[48:34.660 --> 48:40.940]  I mean, only a moron wouldn't see this, okay? But I guess the public again, is not moronic,
[48:40.940 --> 48:45.780]  they're in a trance. Let's continue. US Syria used chemical weapons, crossing red line.
[48:45.780 --> 48:53.300]  CBS News, absolute balderdash, poppycock, bunk, fraud, scam, just over the top ridiculous
[48:53.300 --> 49:02.780]  lies. Bravo Sierra. Continuing, US plans 50 million a day, no flies on in Syria after
[49:02.780 --> 49:04.780]  finding proof of government used chemical weapons.
[49:04.780 --> 49:10.220]  And then there was WMDs in Iraq too. By the way, Syria has their chemical weapons legally
[49:10.220 --> 49:19.260]  and lawfully. US uncovering on Syrian chemical weapons, unconvincing, says Russia. And Russia's
[49:19.260 --> 49:23.780]  got troops there right now in the proxy war, some of the Iranians. People are like, good,
[49:23.780 --> 49:27.780]  let's kill them Ruskies with Al-Qaeda.
[49:27.780 --> 49:34.180]  By the way, the West blinked on 888 when they invaded Abkhazia and South Ossetia and Georgia
[49:34.180 --> 49:38.660]  and then said that Russia had invaded, total fraud now in the history books. And then Russia
[49:38.660 --> 49:44.020]  just rolled in medium range nukes and said, we're gonna start nuking NATO bases. And the
[49:44.020 --> 49:47.940]  Russians had the target, Russians are not known to bluff.
[49:47.940 --> 49:51.700]  And you can tell they were all swinging vodka at the same time and the West backed off.
[49:51.700 --> 49:58.020]  I mean, this is the type of lunacy that's going on here. And look, the globalists weren't
[49:58.020 --> 50:01.940]  ready at that time. But if you listen to Joel Skalzen, who I agree with, they won a nuclear
[50:01.940 --> 50:05.980]  war. That's what they're digging in for. By the way, cops and FBI agents, you're not gonna
[50:05.980 --> 50:08.620]  get access to the bunkers.
[50:08.620 --> 50:14.740]  Go out, take your kids outside and get a suntan all when it happens. And you can say I'm right
[50:14.740 --> 50:18.740]  once that happens. How's that sound? No, I'd rather you wake up now. I mean, how much more
[50:18.740 --> 50:24.980]  does it have to get obvious here? Al-Qaeda linked group Syrian rebels once denied now
[50:24.980 --> 50:27.980]  key to Assad victories, McClatchy newspapers.
[50:27.980 --> 50:34.540]  My goodness. Do I get apologies from all the Neocons? No, no, no, I'm the bigger enemy
[50:34.540 --> 50:41.140]  now. I'm the big enemy. Reports Syrian rebels execute a 14 year old boy for insulting Islam,
[50:41.140 --> 50:46.220]  Washington Post. But it's okay for the Huffington Post to show a dog's rear end and say it's
[50:46.220 --> 50:47.220]  Jesus.
[50:47.220 --> 50:50.620]  I'm gonna get to that when we come back. And we're gonna get into the NSA spying and what's
[50:50.620 --> 50:55.180]  really happening with it. The rest of the story. I'm Alex Jones. Spread the word about
[50:55.180 --> 51:00.940]  our Twitter account, Real Alex Jones. For updates, spread the word about Infowars.com.
[51:00.940 --> 51:06.420]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[51:06.420 --> 51:11.660]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[51:11.660 --> 51:15.940]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[51:15.940 --> 51:21.140]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[51:21.140 --> 51:25.860]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,

[53:52.540 --> 54:15.980]  You
[54:15.980 --> 54:25.180]  know what I am? I'm an American. I'm an organic, stay-behind, sleeper cell of liberty here
[54:25.180 --> 54:30.900]  in the United States. And I don't get any orders from any government or any individual.
[54:30.900 --> 54:35.180]  I get mine from history and the good Lord above. And that's who you are, ladies and
[54:35.180 --> 54:39.500]  gentlemen, as well. We're going to beat this by identifying the enemy, by never stopping,
[54:39.500 --> 54:43.860]  by discrediting them, and by hating their guts but loving our families ten times more
[54:43.860 --> 54:50.860]  than we hate the enemy, by spitting on them spiritually, by absolutely just taking every
[54:50.860 --> 54:53.260]  opportunity we can to degrade the enemy.
[54:53.260 --> 54:57.320]  We're gonna win. There's a headline out that Congress has the lowest approval rating ever
[54:57.320 --> 55:03.300]  in a Gallup poll of ten points. It was actually one a few years ago of 9%. But listen, these
[55:03.300 --> 55:08.660]  crooks are trying to gut this country right now. And when you get somebody like Peter
[55:08.660 --> 55:17.660]  King coming out and saying, arrest the reporter now, arrest London Guardian and Washington
[55:17.660 --> 55:25.580]  Post reporters and people that broke the story of NSA spying, that is a tyrant.
[55:25.580 --> 55:33.180]  I mean, Lindsey Graham's out there saying bloggers and the web don't deserve to even
[55:33.180 --> 55:40.660]  be online. These people are outrageous, ladies and gentlemen. All right, now moving into
[55:40.660 --> 55:48.180]  the NSA spying, Bloomberg, US agency said to swap data with thousands of firms. Yeah,
[55:48.180 --> 55:56.620]  like Bloomberg, thousands of firms, ladies and gentlemen, the firms take all the data
[55:56.620 --> 55:59.460]  on their customers, everybody, and give it to the NSA.
[55:59.460 --> 56:04.660]  And then the other firms do it and they all share it and team up as giant gangs against
[56:04.660 --> 56:10.380]  everybody else. I know for a fact Bloomberg knew things about what was going on with me
[56:10.380 --> 56:16.380]  and what was going on in telecommunications issues that I haven't announced yet, that
[56:16.380 --> 56:25.720]  I know they had to get from the government in a hit piece they did a week ago on us.
[56:25.720 --> 56:31.060]  And I hadn't even gotten into that yet. I mean, it's not just a few analysts spying
[56:31.060 --> 56:37.340]  on people. It's the Fortune 100 that go to Bilderberg. That's what it's all about, ladies
[56:37.340 --> 56:43.340]  and gentlemen. That's what they're doing. That's what this is all set up for. So how
[56:43.340 --> 56:48.060]  many times, thousands of times, I've told you it's about economic espionage.
[56:48.060 --> 56:53.420]  And here it is, Bloomberg. Let's continue here, next article. This is out of Business
[56:53.420 --> 56:58.820]  Insider. It finally comes out. Elite traders are getting access to data before everybody
[56:58.820 --> 57:06.600]  else via all this NSA garbage. Of course they are. Ladies and gentlemen, it's all rigged.
[57:06.600 --> 57:10.620]  State Department has hired agents with criminal records, the memo reveals. A large percentage
[57:10.620 --> 57:15.660]  of them are hardcore felons. Of course they are.
[57:15.660 --> 57:21.500]  Stalin, Hitler, Mao, they all open the jails up and get these people. The government wants
[57:21.500 --> 57:26.620]  hardcore criminals. You don't hire naive college kids that think the government's good. They
[57:26.620 --> 57:35.540]  blow the whistle on you. You hire child molesters. You hire hit men. You hire con men. The government
[57:35.540 --> 57:43.900]  is converting to pure criminals. That's the New York Post. Here's another one, 57% fear
[57:43.900 --> 57:48.380]  government will use NSA data to harass political opponents.
[57:48.380 --> 57:57.140]  Rasmussen poll. Fear they will? It's admitted they use it on the media and people. I get
[57:57.140 --> 58:01.780]  phone calls probably once a year with a blank phone screen. I've talked to telecommunications
[58:01.780 --> 58:05.900]  people. That means it's from the national security level in control of the switches,
[58:05.900 --> 58:08.420]  threatening me and saying what I was just talking about.
[58:08.420 --> 58:11.740]  So I know it's the government. It probably isn't the government. It's probably one of
[58:11.740 --> 58:21.980]  these corporations. This is America, OK? Grow up. Grow up out there and stop being naive
[58:21.980 --> 58:28.840]  and don't let this scare you. You better be scared of not standing up. Just like a woman
[58:28.840 --> 58:32.700]  getting grabbed in some parking lot by a serial killer. She better fight back and try to get
[58:32.700 --> 58:36.060]  away from them. That's her only shot. Instead of getting scared and getting in the vehicle
[58:36.060 --> 58:45.460]  with them, we did not get in the vehicle with a new world order. This is GCN, the Genesis

[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:29.620]  All right, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is scheduled in the next segment and
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:34.820]  I'm going to get more into what it means to be in a proxy war with Russia where the United
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:39.020]  States is allied with Al-Qaeda. And now they've already got their police state in place. They
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:43.220]  go, it isn't for Al-Qaeda now. We're going to set up checkpoints to search your vehicles,
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:46.820]  stick our hands down your pants, take DNA on the side of the road without warrants.
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:51.460]  Because conservatives and Tea Party people are terrorists. And they're like, yeah, no,
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:55.100]  you're right. Yep, you're right, Alex. You told them 12 years ago that they would flip
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:59.340]  it and target them and we are. And by the way, we're buying thousands of armored vehicles
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:05.660]  a month and we're building bunkers and we're spying on you. And yeah, you bet the big contractors
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:07.380]  do run child kidnapping rings.
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:14.380]  Uh-huh, it's in the Chicago Tribune and nobody's getting in trouble, Alex. I mean, it is just
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:17.380]  in everyone's face and we're going to get rid of the borders and we're going to bring
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:21.440]  in 30 million people and give them welfare. And guess what, Alex? That's going to bankrupt
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.500]  things even faster and then you're going to pay for it. How's that sound? And then all
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.380]  those people who think the government's their friend and they're going to vote to take the
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.380]  guns, Alex.
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:37.020]  And everybody can be slaves just like in Mexico. How's that sound, Alex? And guess what else
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:42.260]  we're going to do, Alex? We're going to forcibly sterilize little girls in Mexico, Alex. Don't
[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:48.300]  do that. See, it's racist to not want to have a totally open borders and a bankrupt and
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:55.060]  collapsing society. But if you want to sterilize all the Mexican girls, then that's liberal.
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:02:00.780]  See how that works. They have got it all figured out, folks, how they sell you one thing and
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.120]  it's another like a cape with a bull.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:09.220]  See the cape and right behind it's a sword. You go for the cape and get a sword run right
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:14.300]  up in the middle of you. And I don't want my society having a sword run up in it. I
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:22.480]  want to try to build a better civilization. Let's go back to these articles. So US agency
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:28.460]  said to swap data with thousands of firms that is used for economic espionage.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:34.540]  It's used for being able to track their competition. It's used to steal people's inventions and
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:40.940]  data. Isn't that just precious? That's how the New World Order is not enough to have
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:44.300]  all the free money they give themselves of taxpayer money with all the banker bailouts
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:49.020]  and corporate welfare and the fiat money and derivatives. No, no, no. Now they get to do
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.100]  all that, which they've been doing for decades.
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:54.380]  And then again, here's Business Insider. Elite traders are getting access to data before
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:03:00.720]  anyone else. The stock market's totally fake and rigged. Next you're gonna say Las Vegas
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:08.860]  is corrupt. Next you're gonna say a hooker really doesn't love you when you pay her $100.
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:16.180]  Next you're gonna say a hooker dressed up like Meryl Monroe isn't really her with that
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:23.780]  blonde wig. I mean, next you're gonna say the sky isn't black.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:28.280]  State Department hiring agents with criminal records memo reveals how loving. Thousands
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:32.380]  and thousands of them. And they say it's an accident, but no one will be let go. Yeah,
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:36.100]  it's an accident they hire pedophiles to be the managers at every TSA major station that
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:37.580]  keeps coming out.
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:43.860]  Just defrocked priests and people and stuff like that. You know what? Normal people want
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:50.820]  to grow up little kids all day. Yeah, right. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. It's all about what
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:57.500]  will these people put up with? And the answer is, they'll put up with anything, boss. And
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:01.580]  I love how the TSA looks at you and goes, would you like a private screening? Oh, yeah,
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:05.860]  I wanna go behind closed doors while you grab my genitals.
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:11.380]  People are like, big deal, let them grab your genitals. Really, if you do that to somebody
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:15.980]  in a park, you go to prison for five, six, seven years. But it's like, we're doing it
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:22.780]  cuz of the bin Laden. Hey, that's a good one, Bob, the bin Laden, the CIA guy. And now their
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:25.060]  government runs out kinda publicly.
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:30.820]  But look at these schmoes. They line up and they do whatever we tell them cuz Obama might
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:38.740]  blow up the plane if we don't. Yeah, and you might get sick if you don't take the vaccine
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:44.340]  either, cuz sure, the government did thousands of secret tests and killed people, but we
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:51.180]  should trust them. They brought 30,000 Nazis back to the US, set up everything after World
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:05:00.940]  War II, but so what? Take the shots, who needs to live anyway? Take it, you know it's good.

[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:17.780]  cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:27.140]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All right, ladies and gentlemen, now into
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:32.420]  our number two. I'm your host, Alex Jones. The websites are info wars.com and prison
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:39.140]  planet TV. You can follow me at Twitter there at real Alex Jones. There is so much to get
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:45.860]  into. Wow. Look at this headline out of Bloomberg. US agency said to swap data with thousands
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:51.980]  of firms and it's admitted that the Fortune 100 is using all your data to fix the stock
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:55.960]  market and to fix interest rates and to spy on their competition.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:00.820]  That's what I was told by NSA whistleblowers more than 15 years ago and now it's out in
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:04.780]  the mainstream news today. We're gonna talk to former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:08.860]  about all these articles for the balance of the hour coming up in just a moment. State
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:15.220]  Department has hired agents with criminal records, thousands of them on purpose. 57%
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:19.140]  of your government will use NSA data to harass political opponents.
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:25.700]  They're already doing that to the AP and others. I mean, I guess 57% are informed. And I wanna
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:32.600]  go back to a New York Times article from 2002, total information awareness, where they bragged
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:38.780]  that they were already spying and sharing everything with the major corporations. So
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:46.220]  we're gonna be breaking that down as well. And we're gonna get Jesse Ventura's take on
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.220]  it.
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:50.820]  I mean, everything we've talked about is now coming out in the open like this breaking
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:54.920]  news. Not breaking to this audience, we've told you for 27 months what's happening in
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:10:01.660]  Syria over three years in Libya. Look at this headline, USA Today. Syrian rebels pledge
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:06.980]  loyalty to Al-Qaeda and they go on to admit the main force is Al-Qaeda. They've already
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:09.180]  given them a billion bucks of US money.
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:13.120]  And now they're gonna do a no-fly zone and start bombing the country to overthrow Assad
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:18.540]  who's done nothing to anybody. Al-Qaeda linked group, Syrian rebels once denied now key to
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:24.580]  Assad victories. McClatchy news, arrest Obama under NDAA for supporting terrorists in Syria.
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:29.740]  That's what their unconstitutional law says, so he should have himself arrested. That is
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:35.460]  just some of the news, so we're being told WMDs again by a country that legally and lawfully
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:36.460]  has them.
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:40.700]  We told you a year ago with our Syrian guest on the show that they were gonna do a false
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:48.220]  flag blaming Syria for chemical weapons use and that is what Syria is saying. Unbelievable.
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:53.740]  Well his latest book is Democrats and Republicans bestseller. We sell all of his books at info
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:59.180]  war store.com. And giving viewers a first look, here's the new cover of what's coming
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:01.300]  out in October and I really like it.
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:07.660]  They killed our president and it goes over 63 facts that prove a conspiracy to kill JFK.
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:12.820]  This is the 50th anniversary. They said no one allowed in the big park at Dealey Plaza,
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:16.180]  but people that agree with the official story for the first time. So I'm gonna be there
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.780]  with thousands demonstrating for the First Amendment.
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:25.900]  And I've invited Jesse Ventura to be there with us. He is considering it. And Gov, you've
[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:29.180]  been gone about five, six months. It's great to have you back. Thanks for coming on with
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:30.180]  us.
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:36.500]  Hey Alex, great to be here. I'll tell you, I enjoyed my time in Mexico. I didn't watch
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:42.420]  television from January 2nd till about a couple weeks ago.
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:45.220]  I've seen you when you get back from Mexico. You look 10 years younger.
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:50.660]  I feel 10 years younger too. You know what I did down there this year that was life changing?
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:51.660]  What was that?
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:57.100]  I went to, my wife and I, we took a 500 mile trip to this lagoon and you gotta go about
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:03.540]  a hundred miles off the main road through this rough road to get there. And the Mexicans
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:10.380]  in a small boat took us out into this lagoon and the gray whales will come up to you and
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:13.420]  you can sit in the boat and actually physically touch them.
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:14.420]  Wow.
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:20.540]  And mothers bring up their babies and they actually lift them up. And I actually put
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:27.060]  my hands inside the whale's mouth and scratch their gums.
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:30.540]  You told me you were going to break a life changing event here on air. That is amazing.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:36.100]  I'll tell you, Alex, I can't describe. And when you look into their eyes, you see nothing
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:42.100]  but intelligence. And again, they approach you. You don't go to them. You go out there
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:49.060]  and then they will come up to you in this lagoon. There must've been at least 30 of
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:50.060]  them.
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:52.860]  That is just magic. Can you believe people ever hunted those?
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:58.620]  Well, I'll tell you, I was so moved. I thought with my own frogman experience, I was ready
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:03.380]  to join those guys that go disable the ships that kill them because I got trained by the
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:11.460]  best. I know how to disable ships. That ain't a problem.
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:14.660]  Tell us how you sabotage the propellers and rudders.
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:23.060]  No, because then they'll be able to defend against me. But no, it was, getting back to
[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:31.420]  a more serious note, it was really something. I mean, we had one mother and her calf, she
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:36.220]  was 40 feet long, literally twice as long as our boat. And they must've stayed with
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:41.660]  us for an hour and 15 minutes.
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:47.380]  And what I've seen in the physiology, they're basically the equivalent of like German shepherds.
[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:52.340]  I don't know. There's certainly, well, what it showed me, Alex, is this clearly they can
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:58.060]  communicate with each other because why would a mother, any mother of any animal with the
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:04.260]  instinct is not going to bring their children up to something that endangers them. So clearly
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:11.220]  they know in this particular lagoon with the Mexicans, they know they're in no danger.
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:18.740]  And it was unique for me because I never felt any danger or any fear. There's just an aura
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:26.060]  about it that these big, massive, giant mammals that live in the water present no harm to
[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:30.020]  you. They're actually curious to see what we are.
[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:40.300]  In fact, they say that dolphins have the biggest brain of any mammal, CC size for their body
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.940]  weight. And they think they may be even smarter than humans.
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:48.140]  Well, back when I was in the Navy, we were already using, there was a small program,
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:52.140]  the underwater demolition team said, I wasn't part of it, but I had a couple of buddies
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:58.220]  that worked on it for a while. They were actually using dolphins in underwater work to where
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:02.380]  they had the dolphins would go to the surface and get the correct tool and bring it back
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:03.380]  down to them.
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:10.580]  Well, look, and they also use them for mines and things like that in harbors. Well, I've
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:16.260]  got to say that I don't blame those killer whales locked up in cages that are the equivalent
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:22.140]  of like a hundred square foot prison cell. I don't blame them when they end up killing
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:25.660]  their trainers. That is incredibly inhumane.
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:31.380]  That's a great segue, Alex, because I'll comment on that and say, wait a minute, that's what
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:39.500]  our government wants to do to you and I. They want to lock us themselves to keep us safe.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:43.100]  Absolutely, the whole nanny state, break it down.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:48.700]  No, I mean, it's like the joke, the cartoon I saw where a mother, a father and the two
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:54.380]  children are sitting at the dinner table and they're all exclaiming, gee, I feel safe now.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.980]  The only thing is they're locked inside a cell.
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:01.540]  Well, that's what Eisenhower said. He said total safety is total tyranny.
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:02.540]  Exactly.
[01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:03.540]  It's prison.
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:07.540]  It's like Ben Franklin said, for those who want to give up their liberty for security,
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:09.860]  shall have and deserve neither.
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:15.220]  Well, shifting gears into that, it's now out that everybody's being listened to, everything's
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:20.300]  being recorded and thousands of corporations get contracts to give all your data to the
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:24.620]  government and then they get to share it. And I've had telecom whistleblowers say that
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:28.060]  they can just dial in anybody's phone, turn it on, listen to you.
[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:33.420]  It's all confirmed. Everything we talked about now proven right. Al Qaeda run by the government
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:35.820]  now admitted. Do we get an apology, Governor?
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:41.700]  Oh, absolutely not. I don't think so, Alex. We deserve one. All we deserve the mainstream
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:49.820]  media to say to us, geez, you guys were right. You know what bugs me about it? Lindsey Graham
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:54.900]  and Feinstein and all these are telling the public that we need this to fight terrorism.
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:17:00.340]  Well, what they're saying to me and to every American is that they think you and I are
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:06.340]  terrorists. Because why do they need to listen in on my phone calls and my emails to fight
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:10.340]  terrorism? I'm not a terrorist.
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:16.740]  What do you make of Congressman Peter King saying, arrest the Washington Post reporter
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:22.740]  that talked to Snowden? That's A, and then B, I think Snowden's a hero. What do you say?
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:29.260]  I do too. Because the thing to remember is all people like that and the military, you
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:36.340]  take an oath to protect the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. And if somebody's asking
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:41.260]  you to do something that you feel violates the Bill of Rights, well, you shouldn't do
[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:42.260]  it.
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:46.900]  That's what these whistleblowers are doing. They're simply telling us the government lied
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:53.700]  to you. And yet who's gonna get prosecuted? Bradley Manning and him. They prosecute the
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:18:00.660]  messenger. Now, how can they prosecute them when it's the government and other entities
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:05.360]  that are committing crimes and you're reporting them?
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:10.380]  That's right. And when they reported Fast and Furious within the ATF, they got in trouble.
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:14.700]  So you can't report within the chain because you've got criminals running the chain.
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:20.420]  Well, clearly it goes that deep in this country. People need to understand like when I made
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:26.500]  the statement I love my country but not my government. Bad people, government is nothing
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:31.540]  but people. And bad people can get in charge. If you don't believe it, read about Germany
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.540]  in the 30s.
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:35.380]  Well, that's another-
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:40.500]  Bad people getting in charge. And then of course, we brought so many damn, I read books
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:45.420]  this last winter about all the Nazis we brought into this country that should have stood trial
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:49.540]  at Durnberg. Instead, we brought them in here and gave them positions of authority.
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:53.820]  My grandfather worked all over the Southwest in oil and gas. And the only places to go
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:59.540]  eat or stay were military bases a lot of the time in New Mexico, Arizona, West Texas. And
[01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:02.460]  he told me when I was a child, he almost got in fights all the time and got thrown out
[01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:09.420]  by MPs because he'd go into the restaurant and there'd be full of Nazis and SS.
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:13.200]  And he was part German growing up in Dallas. He could speak some German and he'd hear the
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:18.860]  obnoxious things they were saying about America. And he just blew him away. They were just
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:19.860]  crawling with Nazis.
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:25.860]  Well, when that happened, we can thank Allen Dulles and all those people that decided that
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:30.580]  they were better off here in this country and operating here than putting them on trial
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:35.660]  for Durnberg. Look what we did. Look when I did conspiracy theory. We found out that
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:40.260]  Eric Tribe is the godfather of Plum Island. And this guy worked right underneath, I believe
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:41.260]  it was Himmler.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:42.260]  And Mengele.
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:49.700]  And his expertise was biological warfare, infecting ticks and mosquitoes with agents
[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:54.980]  to kill people. And lo and behold, we end up with Lyme disease, the first recorded case
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:20:01.380]  in Lyme, Connecticut, right across the water from Plum Island.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:04.580]  It's just unbelievable. I think there's an article out today where they found a top Nazi
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:06.380]  living in Minnesota. Did you see that?
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:11.780]  No, I didn't. I don't watch the news and I'm willfully ignorant. I don't read the paper
[01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:14.380]  and I still haven't watched the news since I came home.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:18.900]  Yeah, a top Nazi commander living in Minnesota since 1949. What do you think your dad would
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:19.900]  have thought of that?
[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:27.740]  Well, who knows? I don't know. Like I said, nothing surprises me anymore here.
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:33.900]  It's totally creepy. I mean, and we know authoritarian regimes spy on people and they always say
[01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:34.900]  it's for your own good.
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:40.740]  Alex, are we being sabotaged? I'm getting a whole bunch of interference over the line.
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:42.260]  I did just hear some of that.
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:44.780]  I'm not hearing you clearly now.
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:49.500]  Okay, Governor, we're gonna call you back and to reconnect, okay?
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:51.460]  Okay, I'm gonna hang up. Call me back.
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:56.100]  All right, call me back. Actually, I got a call by a very famous spy yesterday going,
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:02.460]  Alex, we're monitoring you. Everything's fine, Alex, because we were just talking about him.
[01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:09.180]  The phone rings. He goes, yes, we're monitoring you, Alex. You're too high. And I was like,
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:11.660]  what? And then his phone crackles and cuts out.
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:16.300]  He calls back and he goes, and they're monitoring me. Can you imagine who it was I'm talking
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:22.900]  about and he talks like that? It's probably just a bad phone line. That's probably all
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:31.180]  it is. Now they break on the line and say something to us, then we'll know the difference.
[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:35.460]  But it is certainly a crazy world. I just skipped this network break cuz when I get
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:40.620]  Jesse on, I always just enjoy talking to him so much. We're getting Governor Ventura back
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:47.340]  on the line right now here with us. But yeah, guys, just call him back on the same phone
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:48.340]  line, it's fine.
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:53.060]  All right, we don't need to make a big deal out of it. It's probably just a bad line,
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:22:01.220]  all right? Or give me his number, I'll dial it if you want. All right, folks, again, we're
[01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:08.860]  here Monday through Friday from 11 AM to 2 PM Central Standard Time. And the news websites
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:14.460]  are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, and we have the nightly news.
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:18.540]  And then all my films and so much more at prisonplanet.tv. And why is it called Prison
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:23.820]  Planet? We're fighting the globalist construction of the whole world being a prison that Governor
[01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:28.900]  Ventura was just talking about. And the criminals that run both major parties are the Democrats
[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:34.820]  and the Republicans, and that's the name of his latest book available at infowarsstore.com.
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:39.220]  So be sure and shop with the good guys. And we've got propure water filters, 10% off a
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:44.380]  promo code water, the best gravity fed filters out there. Governor Jesse Ventura joins us
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:45.380]  again, is that better, Governor?
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:49.780]  Yeah, it's better, but still a little interference, I'm getting you clear right now.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:54.780]  Okay, that's good. What do you make of it being openly said, okay, Al Qaeda is the main
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:23:00.380]  force, something we talked about last year. And they are killing the Muslims, the minority
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:05.040]  groups and the Christians and the Jews, but that's okay, cuz Assad's a bad guy. Why do
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:08.580]  you think they're getting so bold? I mean, the agenda's out in the open, but they just
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:09.580]  move forward.
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:15.820]  I know, it's all baffling to me, Alex. I was still trying to figure out why we don't just
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:22.980]  get the hell out of the Middle East. I mean, if you look at history, Anglo-Saxon European
[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:28.060]  history, Christopher Columbus came here and when he sailed here, it was to find a way
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:35.580]  to India to avoid the Middle East. So centuries ago, nobody wanted to go there. They wanted
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:41.780]  to avoid it. And Columbus was willing to sail off the flat earth at that time to get a chance
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:49.740]  to do it. Let's get the hell out of there. I mean, completely. I don't get it. I'll tell
[01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:56.340]  you what, if I run for president, I will follow the teachings of Major General Smedley Darlington
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:24:00.740]  Butler, who wrote the book War is Iraq at the two-time Congressional Medal of Honor
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:01.740]  winner.
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:07.180]  So anybody who wants to know my foreign policy, read General Butler's book and you'll know
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:08.180]  it.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:11.700]  Talk about running for president. I mean, I've got a sneaking suspicion you're gonna
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:15.620]  do it. Are you 30%, 50%, 80% sure you're gonna run?
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:21.780]  No, I laid the gauntlet down. Here's what it'll take, Alex. Because I hate the bribery
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:27.740]  in raising the money, it'll take a grassroots movement to get me ballot access in all 50
[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:32.780]  states. And they will have to guarantee me we'll rise up and rebel if I'm not allowed
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:38.500]  in the debates, because you got a debate to win. And if those two criterias are met, I
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:44.900]  will give it serious consideration. But here's what I will run on. I will run on the simplest
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:50.700]  thing you can imagine. I will give the American people for the first time since George Washington,
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:55.620]  the father of our country, the opportunity to vote for a president that doesn't belong
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:25:00.700]  to either political party and is not brought off by corporate money or special interest
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:01.700]  PAC money.
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:07.140]  And I will run on that issue alone. And I truly believe in a three-person race where
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:12.740]  you only need about 36% to win. I would stand a very good chance.
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:20.620]  Well, I think you do stand a really good chance with Congress with a 10% approval rating.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:25.980]  My issue is this, why didn't the libertarians approach you in the last cycle? Nothing against
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:28.140]  their candidate, but does anyone even remember their name?
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:33.860]  Yeah, their last candidate was Gary Johnson. I campaigned for him because I didn't want
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:40.700]  to run, Alex. The point is you gotta pick your battle. 2016 is the most opportune time
[01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:42.180]  because there'll be no incumbent.
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:44.260]  No, no, I agree with you. And of course-
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:50.740]  For the independent movement when Obama won reelection, because if Romney would have won,
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:55.020]  then you'd have an incumbent in 2016. You have to have an election with no incumbent.
[01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:57.700]  Sure, absolutely. Sure, I mean, of course I've seen-
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:03.900]  The reason I didn't want 2012 alone, because I don't do it to lose, I do it to win. And
[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:06.980]  I don't do it just to make a statement.
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:07.980]  Now I remember-
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:13.140]  2016 is the best opportune time, and that's why I laid the gauntlet down. People got two
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:18.500]  years to be ballot access, but I don't care. I don't want the libertarian party. I want
[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:21.020]  to run with no political party.
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:25.500]  Now I remember you last year explaining all that. I was being sarcastic. I like Gary Johnson
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:30.460]  overall. I just meant he didn't get hardly any attention. We tried to give him attention,
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:36.140]  but people would have given attention to Jesse Ventura. And I think it may have made more
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:38.700]  of a statement than you think it would.
[01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:45.900]  But I agree with you, the magic number is 2016 to ever have somebody who's not part
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:50.420]  of the system run for president. But we've talked about this. Do you think that they
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:52.420]  would come after you with more than just smears?
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:57.420]  Well, of course, I don't know what they do, but it all depends what you're polling. I
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:04.420]  mean, if you're polling 2%, they're gonna ignore you. But if you all of a sudden are
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:10.420]  polling 20% or better, well then, yeah, then mainstream media and the two parties, they're
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:15.420]  gonna come at you with both guns loaded. You'll see them team up on you. You know, all of
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:20.420]  a sudden, Democrats and Republicans will become bosom buddies when it comes to a third entity.
[01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:27.420]  But my belief is, what the hell more can they do to me, Alex? Nothing. They've already tried
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:32.420]  to marginalize me and they tell the world I'm crazy and all that stuff, but we know
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:37.420]  better than that. And the point is, I would go into the race pretty cavalier, really,
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:40.420]  because I mean, I have nothing to lose, do I?
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:41.420]  No.
[01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:42.420]  There you go.
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:48.420]  The only way you'd lose is by not taking action because you could win. But regardless, you'd
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:54.420]  inject real issues. So either way you win by running. The only way you lose is by not
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:55.420]  running.
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:59.420]  Well, and again, but I want some proof that the American people are going to stand with
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:04.420]  me. And the only way I see that is they're gonna have to do a grassroots effort in all
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:08.420]  50 states to get me on the ballot, get me ballot access.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:12.420]  So it's now time for people to organize and then you will step into the arena.
[01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:19.420]  When I see that I'm on, when I see that I've got ballot access, if I get it all 50 states,
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:27.420]  I will give it very serious consideration. But that's what it'll take. So I figure I'll
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:29.420]  be living in Mexico.
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:32.420]  Well, you better be ready, obviously, for more-
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:37.420]  I'll be ready. But the point is, it ain't gonna happen. I don't believe it will. I think
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:43.420]  they've been drinking too much water. They got too much Prozac in their bodies to care.
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:45.420]  Not enough of them.
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:49.420]  People ask why Americans put up with so much. Our IQs have dropped about 20 points just
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:54.420]  from the hydrofluorosolic acid. The roundups on record causing breast cancer to skyrocket.
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:29:00.420]  And we're all just basically narcotized, dying. We've been hit with a chemical attack.
[01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:03.420]  So you can't get mad at the public, Governor. They're victims.
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:08.420]  They are victims. But again, you know, like I said, Alex, I still- I'm not gonna do it
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:13.420]  on my own. I gotta have the people with me and I need some sign that they will be. And
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:19.420]  that's the perfect way. Let me see ballot access in all 50 states. They got two years
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:20.420]  to do it.
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:26.420]  Let's talk about how people can organize that on the other side. Get into your lawsuit
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:31.420]  that continues against Chris Kyle. Get your name back. And so much more and some phone
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:36.420]  calls for former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura. His show still airs with huge audiences

[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:04.420]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:10.420]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:14.420]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:18.420]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:23.420]  The fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
