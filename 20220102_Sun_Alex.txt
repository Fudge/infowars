[00:00.000 --> 00:12.280]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen, in the year 2022.
[00:12.280 --> 00:20.920]  It is Sunday, January 2nd, 2022, and we're going to be live here for the next four hours
[00:20.920 --> 00:25.640]  on this very special Sunday night transmission.
[00:25.640 --> 00:32.280]  Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA technology and the holder of literally dozens of top
[00:32.280 --> 00:37.400]  patents, who's been involved at the highest levels of big pharma and government in previous
[00:37.400 --> 00:44.680]  drug and vaccine approval, has given a stunning three-hour interview with Joe Rogan that has
[00:44.680 --> 00:48.680]  gone mega viral and is really waking people up.
[00:48.680 --> 00:53.360]  And the day after Joe interviewed Robert Malone while he was in town, our own Christie
[00:53.360 --> 00:59.360]  Lee interviewed him in an in-depth hour-plus interview that is now at man.video.
[00:59.360 --> 01:03.240]  So today, even though I'm right here in Austin, Texas, I'm ready to go on.
[01:03.240 --> 01:08.800]  I asked her to come in and host this special edition of The Sunday Show, then Harrison
[01:08.800 --> 01:11.200]  Smith comes in with Sunday Live at 6 p.m.
[01:11.200 --> 01:13.960]  He's got a lot of huge news as well that he actually broke.
[01:13.960 --> 01:20.120]  But this Robert Malone interview is so huge, and he also said some things on the Joe Rogan
[01:20.120 --> 01:25.000]  podcast that he didn't say to Christie Lee, but he said a lot of stuff he didn't say on
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.280]  the huge Rogan podcast that he did say to Christie Lee.
[01:29.280 --> 01:31.000]  And that's why this is so important.
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.760]  He talked about being multi-dimensionally aware of their multi-faceted, globalist, great
[01:35.760 --> 01:40.960]  reset takeover and how he sees how all the pieces come together for the casualist society,
[01:40.960 --> 01:44.200]  the global medical ID, all of it.
[01:44.200 --> 01:49.440]  He talked about being red-pilled to the fact that this is a dimensional attack, and that's
[01:49.440 --> 01:53.840]  something Elon Musk has talked about, that's something I've been talking about obviously
[01:53.840 --> 01:57.600]  from the very beginning of being on air, because that's what the globalist are aware of.
[01:57.600 --> 01:59.840]  This is very important information.
[01:59.840 --> 02:04.040]  And also Dr. Peter McCullough was in the studio with me for over two hours Friday, did an
[02:04.040 --> 02:05.040]  incredible job.
[02:05.040 --> 02:06.040]  That's posted at Bandai Video.
[02:06.040 --> 02:12.960]  I'll be playing excerpts tomorrow on my weekday show, but this is such a huge interview.
[02:12.960 --> 02:16.000]  The things he talked about are so incredibly important.
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.080]  I wanted to air it tonight here on the Sunday broadcast, and I wanted to ask you all to
[02:21.080 --> 02:25.680]  share the live links and to share the interview, because people are really hungry for the truth.
[02:25.680 --> 02:32.800]  And as I've said a thousand times, a thousand times, conservatively in the last couple years,
[02:32.800 --> 02:37.200]  if we do not expose the globalist, great reset, build back better agenda, and that it's a
[02:37.200 --> 02:43.240]  planetary corporate authoritarian takeover, then we have no chance of defeating any of
[02:43.240 --> 02:44.240]  their systems.
[02:44.240 --> 02:50.000]  However, there's a global awakening that it's corporate fascist systems using liberalism
[02:50.000 --> 02:56.160]  and wokeism as political correct speech control, and we realize that they are openly bringing
[02:56.160 --> 03:02.520]  in to our world the cashless society social credit score system through our phones and
[03:02.520 --> 03:03.520]  then through implantable chips.
[03:03.520 --> 03:05.760]  It's all been announced by Claude Schwab.
[03:05.760 --> 03:11.800]  If we come together and have an epiphany that they are designing a system to cut off resources
[03:11.800 --> 03:17.520]  to bring humanity to its knees and force the population in war, if we have that epiphany
[03:17.520 --> 03:18.520]  it's came over.
[03:18.520 --> 03:24.000]  And I've got to tell you, all of the top scientists and doctors and people we talked
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.440]  to on here, and yes, some of the other huge names, you know, who they are, folks.
[03:30.440 --> 03:36.920]  One of the names out there is a very well-known individual who had an uncle that was president
[03:36.920 --> 03:43.080]  of the United States, he is getting more and more hardcore and understands exactly what
[03:43.080 --> 03:51.240]  is happening, and we now have a very, very, very good shot of stopping the globalist.
[03:51.240 --> 03:55.360]  This is so exciting, and I'm so proud of all of you, and I want to thank you for your past
[03:55.360 --> 04:00.680]  support because literally you are owed the thanks and the credit for the fact that we've
[04:00.680 --> 04:04.280]  got any hope of beating this, we've got more than a hope, we've got a damn good chance
[04:04.280 --> 04:07.600]  because the globalist can only carry this out if you aren't aware of what's really
[04:07.600 --> 04:08.600]  happening.
[04:08.600 --> 04:14.320]  So, this is so critical, red-pilled, Dr. Robert Malone, talk about the great reset, the new
[04:14.320 --> 04:18.440]  world order, the end game, and all the other scientists I talked to, they've known for
[04:18.440 --> 04:21.880]  over a year, that's what's happening, they've concurred with my analysis, they've just
[04:21.880 --> 04:26.040]  been scared, but Malone isn't scared, their attempt to silence him, their attempt to
[04:26.040 --> 04:31.280]  censor him, has blown up in their face, and now humanity is awakening.
[04:31.280 --> 04:35.360]  The answer to the great reset is the great awakening, the answer to the new world order,
[04:35.360 --> 04:38.160]  build back better, is the new renaissance.
[04:38.160 --> 04:42.280]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today, we'll go to break, and then Christy Lee takes over
[04:42.280 --> 04:46.920]  with powerful excerpts from the interview, a lot of breaking news, and so much more today

[04:51.240 --> 04:55.840]  antibodies, that's not confirmed, mainstream news, has new breaking info coming up as well,

[06:21.400 --> 06:45.480]  Wow, what an introduction!
[06:45.480 --> 06:46.480]  That is great.
[06:46.480 --> 06:49.600]  Tomorrow's news today is how this starts out, and isn't that the truth?
[06:49.600 --> 06:54.840]  We're seeing that over and over again, we're seeing news predicted and then coming true,
[06:54.840 --> 06:58.640]  and it's all starting here, and then the mainstream news is catching up, and I should
[06:58.640 --> 07:04.440]  know it's spending multiple years, 20 years in traditional news journalism, before being
[07:04.440 --> 07:13.320]  able to escape to a place of truth, and that is my motto for 2022 is that what is true
[07:13.320 --> 07:19.240]  will come out in 2022, and that is the hope and the prayer and what a journey it's been,
[07:19.240 --> 07:20.240]  it's been a wild ride.
[07:20.240 --> 07:25.240]  We're going to be showing you clips of the interview with Dr. Malone that we had right
[07:25.240 --> 07:29.640]  after Joe Rogan, again, what a wild ride, couldn't believe that that'll happen.
[07:29.640 --> 07:34.160]  We'll be showing you clips of that, have a lot of other news to share, hopefully talking
[07:34.160 --> 07:39.640]  to another fighter, the OG of Independent News, maybe in the next hour, but we're going
[07:39.640 --> 07:44.280]  to get to that in just a moment, but here's the thing, maybe some people haven't quite
[07:44.280 --> 07:49.680]  caught on to or aren't willing to dedicate three hours to watching the Joe Rogan and
[07:49.680 --> 07:53.440]  Dr. Malone interview, even though they should, because it's all fascinating, and I mean,
[07:53.440 --> 07:57.000]  I had to do it while doing other things, but I did get through the whole three hours.
[07:57.000 --> 08:02.280]  Maybe they don't have time necessarily for the hour plus, but maybe they do have time
[08:02.280 --> 08:07.280]  for about 15 minutes, and once they get a taste of what was said by Dr. Malone, maybe
[08:07.280 --> 08:11.480]  they will then dedicate the time to listen to the full three hours or the hour and 15
[08:11.480 --> 08:16.240]  minutes that was broadcast that I had with him here in studio at InfoWars.
[08:16.240 --> 08:21.480]  So we want to encourage you to share the highlights version if people just aren't willing to sit
[08:21.480 --> 08:24.000]  and listen for the extended versions just yet.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.960]  We want to make sure that you share this video, and without further ado, let's play the first
[08:28.960 --> 08:32.480]  half of this video so you know what you can put out there for your friends and family.
[08:32.480 --> 08:44.040]  It's been a series of epiphanies that have made me realize that there's no upside to
[08:44.040 --> 08:48.320]  just being circumspect and trying to be a nice guy in this environment.
[08:48.320 --> 08:56.640]  This is full on media warfare, information warfare, political warfare, 21st century,
[08:56.640 --> 09:02.520]  like we've never seen before, and coordinated globally.
[09:02.520 --> 09:12.960]  The other thing for me has been the personal journey of coming to terms with what the World
[09:12.960 --> 09:21.120]  Economic Forum really represents, and I really resisted that people initially were coming
[09:21.120 --> 09:27.120]  to me talking about the great reset, and I was like, oh, there's a crazy talk, you know.
[09:27.120 --> 09:29.120]  That sounds like a conspiracy theory.
[09:29.120 --> 09:31.120]  It sure sounds like a conspiracy theory.
[09:31.120 --> 09:32.120]  Yeah.
[09:32.120 --> 09:33.120]  Great reset.
[09:33.120 --> 09:38.680]  Yeah, but then it's all documented, and then you see it being deployed, and a group of
[09:38.680 --> 09:45.040]  Canadians on a podcast the other day sent me some links from WEF to a site.
[09:45.040 --> 09:50.600]  This is one of the last things I tweeted before.
[09:50.600 --> 09:59.920]  It had an extremely detailed map of all of the policy positions and the actions that
[09:59.920 --> 10:09.280]  the WEF was taking for a huge range of topics, not least of which is COVID-19, and it's
[10:09.280 --> 10:14.960]  a public document that clearly states everybody that's in our little clique, in our club.
[10:14.960 --> 10:18.080]  These are the things that we will think, these are the things that we will say, this is how
[10:18.080 --> 10:22.880]  we will act, and that one was kind of like the icing on the cake.
[10:22.880 --> 10:26.160]  That was, oh, here it is.
[10:26.160 --> 10:28.160]  This is, they're proud of it.
[10:28.160 --> 10:30.200]  They don't hide it.
[10:30.200 --> 10:32.560]  This is the vision.
[10:32.560 --> 10:43.360]  It is a full on globalist totalitarian vision with the money in control, and I did a lot
[10:43.360 --> 10:49.920]  of political science when I was an undergraduate in the early 80s, and I had read things like
[10:49.920 --> 10:54.800]  about books about transnationalism in the new world order.
[10:54.800 --> 11:00.520]  I found that fascinating, but confusing, how could this possibly happen?
[11:00.520 --> 11:07.680]  Now to see it playing out in real time, and in a way in which national sovereignty governments
[11:07.680 --> 11:13.160]  are increasingly irrelevant, yeah.
[11:13.160 --> 11:16.680]  That's the thing that folks got to wake up about.
[11:16.680 --> 11:21.160]  This is not about the vaccine, the vaccine is a symptom.
[11:21.160 --> 11:24.440]  It's much bigger.
[11:24.440 --> 11:32.360]  And that's a really hopeful message going into the new year, is that there's a growing
[11:32.360 --> 11:40.720]  cohort of people that are increasingly aware of how thoroughly we've been manipulated.
[11:40.720 --> 11:45.040]  So you'd say you've been red-pilled?
[11:45.040 --> 11:50.400]  Like multi-dimensional red-pilled.
[11:50.400 --> 11:54.360]  I thought I was red-pilled.
[11:54.360 --> 12:03.800]  I've been on the inside for so long and seen Tony Fauci's machinations for so long.
[12:03.800 --> 12:13.120]  That's my origin story, was the initial AIDS crisis starting in 83 when I was at Davis.
[12:13.120 --> 12:15.480]  So I saw the hardball politics.
[12:15.480 --> 12:23.920]  It's not that I haven't been aware of that, but I had not been aware before of the information
[12:23.920 --> 12:28.520]  control that is globally coordinated.
[12:28.520 --> 12:32.760]  The Trusted News Initiative is profound.
[12:32.760 --> 12:33.760]  What that means?
[12:33.760 --> 12:41.000]  It has become the Ministry of Truth, full-on, and what Twitter's doing right now.
[12:41.000 --> 12:51.280]  I think with Alex Berenson's bold and brave lawsuit taken on Twitter, and then I've had
[12:51.280 --> 12:56.920]  a bunch of lawyers come to me because of getting de-platformed or cancelled, I think
[12:56.920 --> 13:02.480]  is really the right term.
[13:02.480 --> 13:10.040]  I think that we may, certainly, people can't deny anymore.
[13:10.040 --> 13:19.280]  There's so much evidence, and the CNN ratings keep slipping, yay.
[13:19.280 --> 13:22.560]  Maybe we're going to see some change in 2022.
[13:22.560 --> 13:26.280]  What surprised you most about Rogan?
[13:26.280 --> 13:33.960]  He is completely up on all the information, and yet it's totally low-key.
[13:33.960 --> 13:38.240]  He's very committed to speaking to a general audience.
[13:38.240 --> 13:46.200]  It's core for him, the idea of not playing into all this divisiveness.
[13:46.200 --> 14:00.640]  He is consciously, intentionally a healer right now, and just a very centered, genuinely
[14:00.640 --> 14:02.760]  good person.
[14:02.760 --> 14:11.520]  There is kind of a growing movement and awareness that part of the problem here is the structure
[14:11.520 --> 14:20.360]  of how we have been building our organizations and doing business in a deep, profound way,
[14:20.360 --> 14:28.800]  in a dissatisfaction with what one sees at the World Health Organization and the CDC and
[14:28.800 --> 14:35.440]  the whole HHS structure in the United States, where you have carefully controlled information.
[14:35.440 --> 14:37.960]  Only one leader is allowed to speak.
[14:37.960 --> 14:43.160]  Only one leader is allowed to represent the position.
[14:43.160 --> 14:49.280]  I think that is going to turn out to be one of the changes here, is a growing awareness
[14:49.280 --> 14:56.400]  that that model is dysfunctional, broken, and it needs to be fixed.
[14:56.400 --> 15:03.240]  In light of your attacks and seeing how the mainstream media labels people and then tries
[15:03.240 --> 15:08.720]  to get these buzzwords going, has that changed your view on other people that the media has
[15:08.720 --> 15:09.720]  gone after?
[15:09.720 --> 15:10.720]  Completely.
[15:10.720 --> 15:15.720]  Because you have people like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., or people like Alex Jones.
[15:15.720 --> 15:21.000]  Has this kind of made you think, well, maybe they're not as crazy as maybe I was led to
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]  believe before?
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.200]  So I'm going to share.
[15:23.200 --> 15:30.120]  So we did a little bit of a tour on the Hill a few weeks ago, and I met with various senators.
[15:30.120 --> 15:37.080]  So I walk into Ron Johnson's office, and I had this mental image from the press of what
[15:37.080 --> 15:39.640]  I was going to encounter with Ron Johnson.
[15:39.640 --> 15:49.640]  Ron Johnson is basically an average mid-western, straight-arrow kind of good guy, open-hearted,
[15:49.640 --> 15:56.320]  very down-to-earth, you know, I've dealt with the Hill for a long time, and I've seen some
[15:56.320 --> 15:59.560]  serious egos, wasn't there?
[15:59.560 --> 16:04.440]  Something we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build-up for what
[16:04.440 --> 16:06.440]  the globalists are doing right now.
[16:06.440 --> 16:08.160]  This is their big offensive.
[16:08.160 --> 16:09.560]  This is their takeover.
[16:09.560 --> 16:13.560]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[16:13.560 --> 16:17.600]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[16:17.600 --> 16:18.600]  in the open.
[16:18.600 --> 16:23.080]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[16:23.080 --> 16:27.360]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[16:27.360 --> 16:30.640]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[16:30.640 --> 16:35.320]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear, and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[16:35.320 --> 16:36.320]  you keep us on air.
[16:36.320 --> 16:40.120]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[16:40.120 --> 16:43.640]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[16:43.640 --> 16:47.240]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers, they are so good for your body, and if there's
[16:47.240 --> 16:50.400]  two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[16:50.400 --> 16:55.040]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[16:55.040 --> 16:57.960]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[16:57.960 --> 17:04.160]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[17:04.160 --> 17:08.480]  in World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group so he
[17:08.480 --> 17:11.800]  didn't stand up, and then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group
[17:11.800 --> 17:13.720]  so he didn't stand up.
[17:13.720 --> 17:17.080]  And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand up.
[17:17.080 --> 17:20.520]  Well, the Global Social Credit Score, the China's footing, and it's banning people to
[17:20.520 --> 17:24.160]  three hours of video games a week, and if you criticize the government, you can never
[17:24.160 --> 17:25.520]  buy or sell again.
[17:25.520 --> 17:30.560]  Well, that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of COVID vaccine
[17:30.560 --> 17:31.560]  passports.
[17:31.560 --> 17:32.560]  They even admit it.
[17:32.560 --> 17:34.760]  Now, there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it.
[17:34.760 --> 17:38.200]  They're going to track where you go and what you do, and decide where you can go and what
[17:38.200 --> 17:39.200]  you can do.
[17:39.200 --> 17:41.000]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[17:41.000 --> 17:42.000]  You'll accept that.
[17:42.000 --> 17:43.000]  You'll accept anything.
[17:43.000 --> 17:47.800]  So, again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending
[17:47.800 --> 17:50.720]  like they're part of the power structure, but they're all going to be targeted by this
[17:50.720 --> 17:51.720]  nightmare as well.
[17:51.720 --> 17:55.880]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them, or all of us will be enslaved
[17:55.880 --> 17:58.920]  by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[17:58.920 --> 18:01.760]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[18:01.760 --> 18:06.920]  They're here all over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[18:06.920 --> 18:10.400]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to your
[18:10.400 --> 18:16.120]  house and threatening, in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their
[18:16.120 --> 18:17.120]  facilities.
[18:17.120 --> 18:21.600]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come
[18:21.600 --> 18:25.920]  and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[18:25.920 --> 18:27.720]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[18:27.720 --> 18:31.960]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high-quality Faraday cages, many
[18:31.960 --> 18:36.240]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[18:36.240 --> 18:38.840]  grade, at infowarstore.com.

[19:00.000 --> 19:01.360]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[19:01.360 --> 19:03.360]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[19:03.360 --> 19:04.360]  Welcome.
[19:04.360 --> 19:05.360]  Hello, Alex.
[19:05.360 --> 19:06.360]  Yes, Malcolm.
[19:06.360 --> 19:07.360]  All right.
[19:07.360 --> 19:09.360]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[19:09.360 --> 19:14.280]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[19:14.280 --> 19:19.440]  Superbile volatility and brain force plus, mix those two together, you're an unstoppable
[19:19.440 --> 19:20.440]  tank.
[19:20.440 --> 19:21.440]  Superbile volatility really, really works.
[19:21.440 --> 19:26.480]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[19:26.480 --> 19:32.080]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[19:32.080 --> 19:33.080]  but just aren't as strong.
[19:33.080 --> 19:35.080]  This is like a very fine wine.
[19:35.080 --> 19:37.480]  In fact, each batch is different.
[19:37.480 --> 19:39.520]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[19:39.520 --> 19:42.960]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[19:42.960 --> 19:43.960]  That's just how it is.
[19:43.960 --> 19:44.960]  That's just how it works.
[19:44.960 --> 19:47.160]  So it's always good.
[19:47.160 --> 19:49.280]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[19:49.280 --> 20:00.680]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[20:00.680 --> 20:21.480]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:21.480 --> 20:22.480]  Welcome back.
[20:22.480 --> 20:23.760]  Christy Lee guest hosting today.
[20:23.760 --> 20:26.040]  Boy, have things really blown up.
[20:26.040 --> 20:31.600]  Since Joe Rogan invited Dr. Malone on and did a three hour plus interview with him, it's
[20:31.600 --> 20:35.520]  been going all over the place and this is just after he'd been censored.
[20:35.520 --> 20:41.960]  And so like I had said on Twitter, you know, the best way to actually defeat the purposes
[20:41.960 --> 20:47.040]  and you're trying to censor someone is, is censor them and then they're going to get
[20:47.040 --> 20:48.880]  blown up like never before.
[20:48.880 --> 20:54.360]  So we've been seeing that to happen and if you go to info wars.com, we have a nice comprehensive
[20:54.360 --> 21:00.280]  look of everything that has gone on since this wild interview came out and it's just
[21:00.280 --> 21:02.200]  been going crazy.
[21:02.200 --> 21:06.760]  It's titled see the mass formation psychosis term censored by Google following bombshell
[21:06.760 --> 21:09.160]  Dr. Malone interview there.
[21:09.160 --> 21:13.600]  This has a nice comprehensive look at everything that's been going on and how this term has
[21:13.600 --> 21:14.600]  been going.
[21:14.600 --> 21:15.600]  Wild.
[21:15.600 --> 21:16.600]  I've seen it trending on Twitter.
[21:16.600 --> 21:23.560]  In fact, I think it even says that yeah, 106,000 tweets of mass formation psychosis.
[21:23.560 --> 21:26.960]  This is in the article that you can find on info wars.com.
[21:26.960 --> 21:31.920]  And here we have a clip of him on Rogan talking about this concept.
[21:31.920 --> 21:32.920]  Here it is.
[21:32.920 --> 21:39.200]  It was from basically European intellectual inquiry into what the heck happened in Germany
[21:39.200 --> 21:43.680]  in the 20s and 30s, you know, very intelligent, highly educated population and they went barking
[21:43.680 --> 21:48.760]  mad and how did that happen?
[21:48.760 --> 21:51.760]  The answer is mass formation psychosis.
[21:51.760 --> 21:58.040]  When you have a society that has become decoupled from each other and has free floating anxiety
[21:58.040 --> 22:02.880]  in a sense that things don't make sense, we can't understand it.
[22:02.880 --> 22:08.040]  And then their attention gets focused by a leader or series of events on one small point
[22:08.040 --> 22:10.120]  just like hypnosis.
[22:10.120 --> 22:14.600]  They literally become hypnotized and can be led anywhere.
[22:14.600 --> 22:19.360]  And one of the aspects of that phenomena is the people that they identify as their leaders,
[22:19.360 --> 22:24.200]  the ones typically that come in and say, you have this pain and I can solve it for you.
[22:24.200 --> 22:28.520]  I and I alone can fix this problem for you.
[22:28.520 --> 22:32.040]  Then they will lead, they will follow that person through how it doesn't matter whether
[22:32.040 --> 22:34.240]  they lie to them or whatever.
[22:34.240 --> 22:36.200]  The data are irrelevant.
[22:36.200 --> 22:41.200]  And furthermore, anybody who questions that narrative is to be immediately attacked.
[22:41.200 --> 22:43.480]  They are the other.
[22:43.480 --> 22:46.440]  This is central to mass formation psychosis.
[22:46.440 --> 22:48.600]  And this is what has happened.
[22:48.600 --> 22:50.000]  We had all those conditions.
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.960]  If you remember back before, 2019, everybody was complaining, the world doesn't make sense,
[22:55.960 --> 22:57.760]  blah, blah, blah.
[22:57.760 --> 23:02.560]  And we're all isolated from each other, we're all under little tools, we're not connected
[23:02.560 --> 23:06.240]  socially anymore, except through social media.
[23:06.240 --> 23:09.600]  And then this thing happened and everybody focused on it.
[23:09.600 --> 23:14.200]  That is how mass formation psychosis happens and that is what's happened here.
[23:14.200 --> 23:19.080]  Absolutely, it's the only explanation of what's going on, why people around you can't seem
[23:19.080 --> 23:23.040]  to wake up no matter how much evidence, how much data it is that you give them.
[23:23.040 --> 23:28.560]  Now, I don't think you need any more evidence that Infowars is tomorrow's news today, but
[23:28.560 --> 23:35.240]  I do want to point out that a month ago, a month ago, I sat down with Dr. Malone and
[23:35.240 --> 23:40.200]  we did a whole entire interview on this particular topic.
[23:40.200 --> 23:47.200]  And it is found on band.video, it is the one where it says we're all being hypnotized.
[23:47.200 --> 23:51.960]  It's a 25, a little over 25 minute video where we're completely focused on this topic that
[23:51.960 --> 23:57.960]  was posted a month ago on Infowars on band.video and you can find that video now if you want
[23:57.960 --> 24:02.200]  to dig deeper onto this conversation of mass formation psychosis.
[24:02.200 --> 24:06.720]  So again, a month ago, we were talking about, there it is, Dr. Malone, they're being hypnotized.
[24:06.720 --> 24:08.680]  This was put up over a month ago.
[24:08.680 --> 24:13.200]  Now it's really picking up steam since he mentioned it on Joe Rogan, but here's just
[24:13.200 --> 24:17.920]  more evidence that Infowars is where it's at for getting the information before anyone
[24:17.920 --> 24:18.920]  else.
[24:18.920 --> 24:19.920]  So there you go.
[24:19.920 --> 24:21.320]  But I'll talk more about that in a minute.
[24:21.320 --> 24:27.080]  I wanted to talk about Liberty Daily then ran with an article about Dr. Malone that you
[24:27.080 --> 24:31.680]  saw in the first half of the highlights video, which again, you can find on band.video where
[24:31.680 --> 24:36.120]  he was talking about being multi-dimensional red-pilled and obviously when I asked him
[24:36.120 --> 24:40.960]  if he'd been red-pilled, that was not the answer I expected was for him to be so blatant.
[24:40.960 --> 24:44.440]  Yes, I've been multi-dimensional red-pilled, but this is what happens.
[24:44.440 --> 24:48.320]  I think this is what happens when you poke the bear, when you ridicule somebody, when
[24:48.320 --> 24:51.480]  you attack them, when you censor them, when you suppress them and they know they have
[24:51.480 --> 24:53.760]  the truth on their side.
[24:53.760 --> 24:55.200]  That's when they wake up.
[24:55.200 --> 25:00.800]  That is the journey that he and I frankly have gone through coming from traditional
[25:00.800 --> 25:06.360]  cookie cutter experiences, he was an insider obviously with vaccine research.
[25:06.360 --> 25:12.560]  I was an insider, if you will, with traditional news media and then once you start to see
[25:12.560 --> 25:18.080]  just by asking questions, the response, the response you get just by asking questions
[25:18.080 --> 25:24.880]  and speaking up how you're attacked, how it's just such a vicious response, I think that
[25:24.880 --> 25:30.040]  helps you wake up and I think that that's why Dr. Malone and I have connected as now
[25:30.040 --> 25:36.440]  friends is just, we've been through this whole journey of being red-pilled, of waking up
[25:36.440 --> 25:39.320]  and sometimes that is what it takes.
[25:39.320 --> 25:46.520]  So there's this article from Liberty Daily talking about this concept, one of two things
[25:46.520 --> 25:50.200]  can happen to somebody when they've been exposed to the machinists of the forces of evil within
[25:50.200 --> 25:53.880]  our government and among the globalist elite cabal that manipulates much of what is happening
[25:53.880 --> 25:58.680]  on earth, most succumb to the pressures and embrace the worldly benefits of going long
[25:58.680 --> 26:00.240]  to get along.
[26:00.240 --> 26:04.400]  This is how we get people like Anthony Fauci and Joe Biden enjoying long careers in government
[26:04.400 --> 26:08.480]  despite ridiculous strings of failures throughout their lives.
[26:08.480 --> 26:11.600]  Some are able to see the evil for what it is and choose to side with the truth.
[26:11.600 --> 26:16.720]  It's called being red-pilled and Dr. Malone admits that he's there and then we have this
[26:16.720 --> 26:25.640]  whole crazy response from Google trying to then shut it down, this mass formation psychosis,
[26:25.640 --> 26:28.000]  this term and just think about that.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.320]  This is just a concept.
[26:30.320 --> 26:35.600]  This isn't even talking about vaccines or the safety and efficacy of vaccines or anything.
[26:35.600 --> 26:39.520]  This is just talking about a concept that they're trying to hide from you.
[26:39.520 --> 26:43.120]  Why would they try so hard to hide a concept from you?
[26:43.120 --> 26:44.120]  Think about that.
[26:44.120 --> 26:49.600]  So Google and DuckDuckGo, they handled this whole mass formation psychosis very differently.
[26:49.600 --> 26:54.560]  You can find this in the Infowars.com article but it's also mentioned here on Liberty Daily.
[26:54.560 --> 26:58.800]  The biggest of the big tech baddies has taken upon themselves to be the arbiters of truth
[26:58.800 --> 27:02.840]  who determine what we're allowed to see and what is too dangerous for our feeble minds.
[27:02.840 --> 27:07.720]  A perfect example of this is happening right now as many people search for Dr. Robert Malone
[27:07.720 --> 27:10.960]  and mass formation psychosis.
[27:10.960 --> 27:16.440]  So instead of linking to the video of Dr. Malone when you search on Google, any of the stories
[27:16.440 --> 27:21.920]  that dive into the phenomenon or even reaction videos that expand on the concept, Google
[27:21.920 --> 27:29.040]  decided to promote some random dudes minute and a half video debunking it when people
[27:29.040 --> 27:32.860]  search for mass formation psychosis.
[27:32.860 --> 27:37.480]  Even if we discard the indisputable fact that the guy in the video is a mental lightweight
[27:37.480 --> 27:41.880]  while attempting to attack the inventor of the mRNA technology that powers the jab, we
[27:41.880 --> 27:48.520]  can't find any algorithmic reason for his video to be ranked at the top while ahead
[27:48.520 --> 27:50.960]  of actual experts.
[27:50.960 --> 27:58.040]  But if you search on DuckDuckGo, which many I know have learned to do, to actually find
[27:58.040 --> 28:05.160]  what you're looking for free from any control, if you search on DuckDuckGo, his detailed
[28:05.160 --> 28:10.080]  substack article about this phenomenon is right there at the top.
[28:10.080 --> 28:11.720]  But again, this isn't something new.
[28:11.720 --> 28:17.240]  This is now getting traction, which is why Google had to rush in and try and censor this
[28:17.240 --> 28:18.240]  concept.
[28:18.240 --> 28:21.360]  And many people have been talking about this concept.
[28:21.360 --> 28:27.360]  It kicked off with Matthias Desmet talking about this on YouTube.
[28:27.360 --> 28:33.400]  And it was actually that that made Dr. Malone reach out to me and say, hey, I'm really intrigued
[28:33.400 --> 28:35.840]  by this whole concept of what I think is going on.
[28:35.840 --> 28:40.160]  I've been trying to figure out why people are ignoring the data, why they are censoring
[28:40.160 --> 28:41.240]  the truth.
[28:41.240 --> 28:44.840]  And I just listened to this, this breakdown from Matthias.
[28:44.840 --> 28:45.840]  And I want to talk to you about it.
[28:45.840 --> 28:49.480]  So that's how it led to the month ago that we were talking about this before.
[28:49.480 --> 28:51.760]  But more on that, we'll be talking about that much more to come.
[28:51.760 --> 28:52.760]  So stick around.
[28:52.760 --> 28:59.280]  I'll see you on the other side.
[28:59.280 --> 29:05.160]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you still got a really great chance to give yourself the
[29:05.160 --> 29:09.840]  gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time making

[29:20.440 --> 29:25.440]  Winter Sun, the highest quality vitamin D3, taken under the tongue for higher absorption
[29:25.440 --> 29:27.120]  is back in stock.
[29:27.120 --> 29:30.560]  Despite the fact it's been sold out for months, it is 50% off.

[29:59.120 --> 30:01.320]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[30:01.320 --> 30:02.920]  Why do the globalists take you so much?
[30:02.920 --> 30:06.120]  Why do they hate America so much?
[30:06.120 --> 30:11.960]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot
[30:11.960 --> 30:14.120]  coexist with is very, very simple.
[30:14.120 --> 30:20.760]  For their world government, their anti-human, post-human eugenics system to flourish, freedom
[30:20.760 --> 30:26.760]  and liberty and new process injustice and God fearing systems must fail.
[30:26.760 --> 30:29.320]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[30:29.320 --> 30:32.280]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[30:32.280 --> 30:34.200]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[30:34.200 --> 30:39.120]  They started a fight with you, and they're not going to back down and they're not going
[30:39.120 --> 30:44.600]  to go away, and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear
[30:44.600 --> 30:46.400]  of God put into them.
[30:46.400 --> 30:50.480]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order or about globalism
[30:50.480 --> 30:55.040]  or about corporate fascism, and it's not until people understand that and that we're under
[30:55.040 --> 30:58.760]  attack that we have any chance of beating these people.
[30:58.760 --> 31:05.560]  In late August, info war saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[31:05.560 --> 31:11.040]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause
[31:11.040 --> 31:15.040]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[31:15.040 --> 31:18.240]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[31:18.240 --> 31:19.240]  have.
[31:19.240 --> 31:22.200]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taken care of, right along with water
[31:22.200 --> 31:26.080]  filtration, self-defense and a relationship with God.
[31:26.080 --> 31:29.560]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.
[31:29.560 --> 31:32.880]  Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[31:32.880 --> 31:38.320]  It's high quality, it's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com because in the future you're
[31:38.320 --> 31:42.760]  going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases
[31:42.760 --> 31:44.280]  that are already taking place.
[31:44.280 --> 31:50.560]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the info war at infowarstore.com.
[31:50.560 --> 31:54.440]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[31:54.440 --> 31:55.440]  control.
[31:55.440 --> 31:58.880]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[31:58.880 --> 32:02.840]  Since the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate
[32:02.840 --> 32:08.120]  world government whose end game once they get control is forced depopulation of the
[32:08.120 --> 32:09.120]  planet.
[32:09.120 --> 32:13.640]  That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all of
[32:13.640 --> 32:17.760]  you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much danger you
[32:17.760 --> 32:19.280]  and your family are in.
[32:19.280 --> 32:21.400]  The globalists are coming after everybody.
[32:21.400 --> 32:28.760]  They are setting up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist.
[32:28.760 --> 32:31.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars is the tip of the spear.
[32:31.120 --> 32:34.600]  Your investment in us over the years, buying our products, spreading the word and praying
[32:34.600 --> 32:35.600]  for us has been incredible.
[32:35.600 --> 32:39.800]  But I'm telling you right now, we're about to lose not just info wars with the entire
[32:39.800 --> 32:41.680]  country and the world of tyranny.
[32:41.680 --> 32:46.400]  So now everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today and infowarstore.com
[32:46.400 --> 32:50.040]  is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip
[32:50.040 --> 32:51.040]  of the spear.
[32:51.040 --> 32:52.040]  I will go down with the ship.
[32:52.040 --> 32:53.040]  I'm not going to back down.
[32:53.040 --> 32:56.520]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face, but I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless
[32:56.520 --> 32:57.520]  you support us.
[32:57.520 --> 33:00.800]  You can go to infowarstore.com.
[33:00.800 --> 33:10.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:10.840 --> 33:29.960]  Welcome back to info wars special Sunday edition and thank you for allowing me to guest host
[33:29.960 --> 33:30.960]  today.
[33:30.960 --> 33:33.760]  We are coming off the major interview with Dr. Robert Malone.
[33:33.760 --> 33:38.160]  The first time I got to meet him in person, we've been doing multiple interviews with
[33:38.160 --> 33:43.440]  Dr. Malone, but it's been through Skype or Zoom and this was the first opportunity I
[33:43.440 --> 33:49.680]  got to sit down with him one-on-one person-to-person in our studio here directly following the
[33:49.680 --> 33:51.760]  interview with Joe Rogan.
[33:51.760 --> 33:57.080]  So that was interesting and you can find the whole full interview on band.video, but you
[33:57.080 --> 34:02.480]  can also find the highlights version if there's folks that haven't committed to maybe sitting
[34:02.480 --> 34:06.760]  down for three hours and watching the Joe Rogan or the hour plus and watching the full one.
[34:06.760 --> 34:13.440]  Maybe you just want to send them the highlights version, which we also have up on band.video.
[34:13.440 --> 34:18.240]  So we're talking about how this whole concept, one of the things he mentioned, oh, also info
[34:18.240 --> 34:22.440]  wars.com, you can see the whole breakdown in this mass formation psychosis term that
[34:22.440 --> 34:24.480]  we're talking about.
[34:24.480 --> 34:31.040]  What we're talking about is that he was talking about this subject, this idea on Joe Rogan
[34:31.040 --> 34:33.160]  and it's taken off.
[34:33.160 --> 34:39.920]  There's hundreds, well, there's over 120,000, 160,000, I think, tweets on mass formation
[34:39.920 --> 34:40.920]  psychosis.
[34:40.920 --> 34:45.600]  People are really intrigued by this concept because I think so many of us have been starving
[34:45.600 --> 34:47.720]  to know, what is it with people?
[34:47.720 --> 34:50.080]  How can they not see what's going on?
[34:50.080 --> 34:57.440]  And this offers a reason and a concept of that people are simply, truly hypnotized, that
[34:57.440 --> 35:04.720]  they used a strategy to get people to not question, to be afraid, and to, you can't
[35:04.720 --> 35:09.720]  barely break it, no matter how much information, no matter how much data you share with them,
[35:09.720 --> 35:10.920]  they just can't break it.
[35:10.920 --> 35:16.160]  But we've been talking about that for a while now, but it's really picking up steam obviously
[35:16.160 --> 35:18.320]  since his interview with Joe Rogan.
[35:18.320 --> 35:23.360]  So here's another example from a conservative playbook.
[35:23.360 --> 35:28.440]  In his book, United States of Fear Psychiatrists, Mark McDonald diagnoses the US as suffering
[35:28.440 --> 35:35.200]  from mass delusional psychosis driven by an irrational fear of what is now a rather innocuous
[35:35.200 --> 35:36.200]  virus.
[35:36.200 --> 35:41.680]  The fearful overreaction, which we all saw, the ticker on the new screen every day, didn't
[35:41.680 --> 35:43.720]  have its origin in what happened in 2020.
[35:43.720 --> 35:48.840]  Government, corporations, and powerful individuals have engaged in a systematic grooming effort
[35:48.840 --> 35:52.400]  toward irrational fear addiction for decades.
[35:52.400 --> 35:55.600]  So fear, they cannot rob us of our freedoms.
[35:55.600 --> 36:00.360]  The underlying motivation of the psychological campaign has been an attack on the core structures,
[36:00.360 --> 36:06.160]  foundations, and institutions of society in order to nurture a sense of dependency on
[36:06.160 --> 36:07.160]  government.
[36:07.160 --> 36:09.160]  Oh, our nanny government.
[36:09.160 --> 36:13.640]  To overcome their addiction to fear, a person must still have a sense of curiosity and be
[36:13.640 --> 36:16.040]  willing to look at new information.
[36:16.040 --> 36:19.440]  If they're not, they're not treatable and cannot be stopped from trading there and
[36:19.440 --> 36:22.520]  are freedom for a false sense of security.
[36:22.520 --> 36:26.000]  So the key is finding those who are still open and receptive to new information so that
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.800]  we can reach a tipping point where there are more fearless people than fear addicted ones.
[36:30.800 --> 36:35.560]  Now when I had my conversation with Dr. Malone a little over a month ago, and you can find
[36:35.560 --> 36:41.560]  that conversation specifically on this topic, this mass formation psychosis, when we were
[36:41.560 --> 36:47.480]  talking about it, he said another way that you can attempt to break the hypnosis is to
[36:47.480 --> 36:53.080]  drip the truth just constantly, just constantly drip the truth and show them the data.
[36:53.080 --> 36:56.560]  And even when you feel like you're not making any progress, just keep it up.
[36:56.560 --> 37:01.720]  So keep on sending those clips from band.video, keep on sending those info wars.com article.
[37:01.720 --> 37:07.640]  You never know if that will be the one that will hopefully break the literal hypnosis
[37:07.640 --> 37:08.920]  that's going on.
[37:08.920 --> 37:14.800]  But if you really are anxious to dig into that because Google is censoring your ability
[37:14.800 --> 37:21.240]  to look at that, make sure you go to band.video and find that that video there on band.video,
[37:21.240 --> 37:22.240]  my page.
[37:22.240 --> 37:27.560]  So I wanted to kind of also give you background on how this came out.
[37:27.560 --> 37:34.360]  So when I, he was intrigued by an interview he'd seen with Matthias Desmond, who was breaking
[37:34.360 --> 37:36.360]  down this concept and he's like, that's it.
[37:36.360 --> 37:41.680]  And so he, Dr. Malone, really dug deeper and looked into this concept.
[37:41.680 --> 37:44.960]  And he actually contacted me and say, I think we should do an interview on this.
[37:44.960 --> 37:49.760]  So I'm like, okay, of course, which is again posted on band.video.
[37:49.760 --> 37:55.120]  And so I had also posted this interview on YouTube.
[37:55.120 --> 37:59.480]  Well, YouTube took it down, gave me a strike.
[37:59.480 --> 38:04.000]  And I was actually surprised because I've tried to strategize how to get around the
[38:04.000 --> 38:10.620]  censorship with YouTube, maybe post smaller things or avoid outright claims about vaccines
[38:10.620 --> 38:15.420]  or effectiveness, you know, is the way that you're supposed to try and strategize on YouTube.
[38:15.420 --> 38:20.600]  So I'm like, well, I think this one will survive because we're just talking about a concept.
[38:20.600 --> 38:25.560]  And the original interview about mass formation psychosis that we were just giving commentary
[38:25.560 --> 38:26.560]  on was still up.
[38:26.560 --> 38:30.600]  So I was like, well, this should be fine to post on YouTube, I'll go ahead and try.
[38:30.600 --> 38:37.880]  And I was actually surprised that they immediately took it down and labeled it as inappropriate
[38:37.880 --> 38:40.560]  content and misinformation.
[38:40.560 --> 38:46.160]  So I made an appeal and said, we were just giving commentary on a concept and that video
[38:46.160 --> 38:47.680]  is still up.
[38:47.680 --> 38:49.800]  And now it didn't work, of course.
[38:49.800 --> 38:56.240]  And so I've come to think that YouTube is just gonna take any video down that has Dr.
[38:56.240 --> 38:57.240]  Malone in it period.
[38:57.240 --> 38:59.080]  But here's the other interesting thing.
[38:59.080 --> 39:04.080]  When Dr. Malone had reached out over a month ago, saying that he wanted to talk about this
[39:04.080 --> 39:10.160]  concept of mass formation psychosis, I had gone to YouTube to find the original interview
[39:10.160 --> 39:12.800]  that intrigued him and it came right up.
[39:12.800 --> 39:18.360]  Well today, when I was looking for that original video, that is not what comes up.
[39:18.360 --> 39:21.440]  They have purged that from being the first thing that comes up.
[39:21.440 --> 39:27.520]  And of course, much like Google, the first things that come up are just criticisms of
[39:27.520 --> 39:32.680]  Dr. Malone and criticisms of this concept in general.
[39:32.680 --> 39:35.720]  So yeah, I can't even find the original video.
[39:35.720 --> 39:41.120]  So it also brings up this idea of censoring now concepts.
[39:41.120 --> 39:45.560]  So we've kind of gotten used to that you can't actually put the truth out there.
[39:45.560 --> 39:51.640]  You can't actually give data on anything that could be perceived as negative with vaccines.
[39:51.640 --> 39:52.640]  But concepts?
[39:52.640 --> 39:58.040]  Well, Cheryl Atkinson, another truth-telling journalist that's been in the game for a long
[39:58.040 --> 39:59.040]  time.
[39:59.040 --> 40:03.120]  And also, we've had an interview with her that you can find on band.video, just so you
[40:03.120 --> 40:04.120]  know.
[40:04.120 --> 40:07.320]  She wrote back, and since no stranger now, to this censorship.
[40:07.320 --> 40:11.280]  And she had written this article a while back and this made me think of it.
[40:11.280 --> 40:16.040]  So she wrote, they censor factual information, Facebook.
[40:16.040 --> 40:20.520]  It's a dynamic that might even make George Orwell shake his head and say, even I never
[40:20.520 --> 40:23.840]  predicted it would be this blatant and allowed to continue.
[40:23.840 --> 40:26.680]  You're not going to believe this if you hadn't heard it already.
[40:26.680 --> 40:32.080]  Facebook banned a post I made that was nothing more than a factual citation of a historical
[40:32.080 --> 40:35.440]  quote from Hitler's propagandist Goebbels.
[40:35.440 --> 40:39.280]  It was posted entirely without comment.
[40:39.280 --> 40:44.080]  It was literally just a quote from propagandist Goebbels.
[40:44.080 --> 40:47.560]  The first ban of the information came with me getting knocked off of Facebook for three
[40:47.560 --> 40:52.200]  days when I posted a follow-up, factually explaining what happened, that got a seven-day
[40:52.200 --> 40:53.200]  ban.
[40:53.200 --> 40:57.600]  If I keep posting factual information, I may not be there much longer.
[40:57.600 --> 40:59.520]  So here are the posts.
[40:59.520 --> 41:03.720]  Here's the post that she originally put on Facebook that got her a three-day ban.
[41:03.720 --> 41:08.520]  It is simply a quote from Joseph Goebbels and the quote is, it would not be impossible
[41:08.520 --> 41:13.360]  to prove with sufficient repetition and psychological understanding of the people concerned that
[41:13.360 --> 41:15.880]  a square is in fact a circle.
[41:15.880 --> 41:21.400]  They are mere words and words can be molded until they clothe ideas in disguise.
[41:21.400 --> 41:27.760]  So with no explanation, just posting a quote got her banned for three days.
[41:27.760 --> 41:34.040]  And then when she tried to explain that Facebook did this, just a quote, then she got another
[41:34.040 --> 41:36.000]  seven-day ban.
[41:36.000 --> 41:44.120]  So these big tech companies, they won't even allow you to post concepts if you're too close
[41:44.120 --> 41:45.120]  to the mark.
[41:45.120 --> 41:49.240]  Now this was an interesting concept for me because when I was still in traditional news
[41:49.240 --> 41:53.040]  and I was starting to awaken to some things that were going on that were making me feel
[41:53.040 --> 41:56.440]  uncomfortable, I had posted on my Facebook page.
[41:56.440 --> 42:01.360]  And again, I was just the lead anchor at a news station in California at this time and
[42:01.360 --> 42:03.800]  I was very uncomfortable what was going on.
[42:03.800 --> 42:11.640]  And so I simply posted the definition of propaganda and how to tell the difference between propaganda
[42:11.640 --> 42:12.640]  and news.
[42:12.640 --> 42:15.960]  And this is while I was still employed as a news anchor.
[42:15.960 --> 42:20.800]  Well, Facebook has a option that you can boost a post, right?
[42:20.800 --> 42:27.920]  So I went to boost this post simply the definition of propaganda and it would not allow me to
[42:27.920 --> 42:30.560]  boost that post.
[42:30.560 --> 42:34.880]  That's when I really started to wake up like, wait a minute, Facebook won't even let me
[42:34.880 --> 42:41.120]  boost the definition of propaganda.
[42:41.120 --> 42:42.680]  Isn't that telling?
[42:42.680 --> 42:43.680]  So here we are.
[42:43.680 --> 42:49.400]  We're in, I mean, as if you needed the reminder, we are straight and worse than Orwell could
[42:49.400 --> 42:54.840]  have ever imagined when we can't even talk about concepts on traditional big tech platforms
[42:54.840 --> 42:59.920]  anymore.
[42:59.920 --> 43:02.080]  Christmas 2021 is gone.
[43:02.080 --> 43:07.280]  It's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going

[44:11.360 --> 44:17.240]  Not only is it a game changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[44:17.240 --> 44:24.320]  but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure
[44:24.320 --> 44:26.560]  and American jobs.
[44:26.560 --> 44:28.840]  It is the true digital economy.
[44:28.840 --> 44:33.000]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent control.
[44:33.000 --> 44:39.640]  I've been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and God's
[44:39.640 --> 44:42.040]  divine empowerment and blessing.
[44:42.040 --> 44:46.080]  But I've got to tell you, out of everything I've done, resetwarstore.com is the most important
[44:46.080 --> 44:52.840]  and it is now available now for the month of December, 2021 is here at resetwarstore.com.
[44:52.840 --> 44:58.520]  Start your journey to the next level today at resetwarstore.com, the globalist fear this
[44:58.520 --> 44:59.520]  information.
[44:59.520 --> 45:04.200]  Not just across the United States, but across the world, you see it on the sides of barns
[45:04.200 --> 45:08.840]  and on bumper stickers, on cars, and written on the side of bathroom walls, Alex Jones
[45:08.840 --> 45:09.840]  was right.
[45:09.840 --> 45:14.600]  That's become a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud of
[45:14.600 --> 45:18.040]  the New World Order, that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the Great
[45:18.040 --> 45:19.040]  Reset.
[45:19.040 --> 45:23.480]  And so now, infowars credibility is stronger than it's ever been and the globalists are
[45:23.480 --> 45:27.480]  now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks and we can't let them
[45:27.480 --> 45:28.480]  do that.
[45:28.480 --> 45:32.760]  So, you've invested in infowars over the years, I'm asking you to redouble those efforts
[45:32.760 --> 45:38.200]  now at this critical juncture or everything you've done in the past is for nothing.
[45:38.200 --> 45:43.240]  You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace, you have done incredible
[45:43.240 --> 45:44.240]  things.
[45:44.240 --> 45:50.080]  And I'm telling you now, going in 2022, infowars has major underages to run an operation and
[45:50.080 --> 45:51.480]  we need more funds in.
[45:51.480 --> 45:55.440]  So, it's a 360 win, get great products that are great for you and your family, your immune
[45:55.440 --> 45:56.440]  system and so much more.
[45:56.440 --> 45:59.680]  So, please go to infowars.com.
[45:59.680 --> 46:05.520]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are
[46:05.520 --> 46:13.200]  working for, quote, dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these
[46:13.200 --> 46:15.440]  evil groups are.
[46:15.440 --> 46:20.160]  They know that all over the world, their poison shot is being banned by major governments
[46:20.160 --> 46:22.560]  and Moderna is in trouble as well.
[46:22.560 --> 46:27.440]  They know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation agenda.
[46:27.440 --> 46:31.760]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons,
[46:31.760 --> 46:36.200]  but they're so deadly, they're killing a higher percentage up front.
[46:36.200 --> 46:39.160]  And so people are waking up.
[46:39.160 --> 46:42.480]  The weapons work a little too good.
[46:42.480 --> 46:46.240]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars, but instead, they're making too
[46:46.240 --> 46:50.120]  big of a noise, but it's too late for a return back now.
[46:50.120 --> 46:51.880]  They're coming after our children.
[46:51.880 --> 46:57.160]  So it's up to us to protect our little children or God will not look favorably on us.
[46:57.160 --> 47:01.120]  Remember, God is watching.
[47:01.120 --> 47:05.560]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[47:05.560 --> 47:26.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:26.120 --> 47:30.920]  Exposing what is true in 2022.
[47:30.920 --> 47:31.920]  Welcome to info wars.
[47:31.920 --> 47:37.280]  This is Christy Lee guest hosting today, which I'm sure you figured out with my cheesy introduction
[47:37.280 --> 47:38.280]  just then.
[47:38.280 --> 47:39.280]  But it's true.
[47:39.280 --> 47:44.800]  That is the hope that I'm holding on to is that what is true is coming out in 2022.
[47:44.800 --> 47:45.800]  Let's hold on to that hope.
[47:45.800 --> 47:47.280]  And I think we're seeing it.
[47:47.280 --> 47:50.280]  The breaking of the mass formation psychosis.
[47:50.280 --> 47:54.240]  I mean, isn't it enough that enough people are intrigued with what this is that it's
[47:54.240 --> 47:55.240]  blowing up?
[47:55.240 --> 47:58.960]  People are trying to seek information on what this concept is.
[47:58.960 --> 48:04.880]  And then we know we're on the market on the mark when big tech, Google, Facebook, Twitter
[48:04.880 --> 48:09.640]  are now censoring concepts, which is all mass formation psychosis is.
[48:09.640 --> 48:16.040]  It's a concept, but they don't like that it's exposing that people are hypnotized.
[48:16.040 --> 48:18.280]  People have been straight up hypnotized.
[48:18.280 --> 48:23.880]  And that is why it is so dang hard to even reach them with facts and data.
[48:23.880 --> 48:29.680]  But speaking of censorship, the latest one to fall, and I'm sure there'll be more, is
[48:29.680 --> 48:35.000]  Marjorie Taylor Greene and she's firing back over her censorship on Twitter, pointing out
[48:35.000 --> 48:43.200]  that representative Maxine Waters has used accounts to actually threaten violence and
[48:43.200 --> 48:45.120]  she has no repercussions.
[48:45.120 --> 48:48.600]  But yet, MGT is censored.
[48:48.600 --> 48:54.440]  She said from her account on Twitter rival Getter, when Maxine Waters can go to the streets
[48:54.440 --> 48:59.760]  and threaten violence on Twitter, Kamala and Ilhan can bail out rioters on Twitter.
[48:59.760 --> 49:05.360]  And she spokesman for terrorist IRGC can tweet mourning Soleimani, but I get suspended
[49:05.360 --> 49:08.440]  for tweeting their statistics.
[49:08.440 --> 49:12.720]  Twitter is an enemy to America and can't handle the truth.
[49:12.720 --> 49:19.600]  So I shared this on my Twitter and I had someone follow up with hope you're next, isn't it?
[49:19.600 --> 49:23.240]  So great how these people are just so tolerant.
[49:23.240 --> 49:28.480]  They're so tolerant and it just, I wanted to respond with like, okay, Nazi, but you know,
[49:28.480 --> 49:32.680]  anytime you say that, then they'll find a reason to come after even harder.
[49:32.680 --> 49:34.560]  So I just didn't bother.
[49:34.560 --> 49:36.080]  But that is how these folks are.
[49:36.080 --> 49:42.040]  They cannot tolerate their echo chamber being at all threatened.
[49:42.040 --> 49:46.680]  And yet that is what they accuse those of us who are telling the truth about.
[49:46.680 --> 49:51.200]  But the thing is, is obviously we don't mind hearing other, other viewpoints.
[49:51.200 --> 49:55.160]  I mean, we're inundated with the other viewpoints, but they can't handle it.
[49:55.160 --> 49:59.440]  They can't handle the truth, as Jack Nicholson would say, you can't handle the truth.
[49:59.440 --> 50:01.960]  So they just kick you off Twitter.
[50:01.960 --> 50:07.920]  And then Eric Weinstein had an interesting tweet in response to all of this censorship.
[50:07.920 --> 50:12.800]  Remember, if you think this suspension is wrong, you support not cases who endanger
[50:12.800 --> 50:15.520]  the public, according to the left.
[50:15.520 --> 50:19.040]  If you support the suspension, you are an authoritarian who doesn't believe in the free
[50:19.040 --> 50:20.760]  exchange of ideas.
[50:20.760 --> 50:24.920]  And if you attempt to evade this binary, you're useless.
[50:24.920 --> 50:26.560]  Pick a side, brah.
[50:26.560 --> 50:27.560]  And see, that's the thing.
[50:27.560 --> 50:31.760]  We are so divided that you cannot be on one.
[50:31.760 --> 50:34.800]  You cannot be in the middle on any of these issues.
[50:34.800 --> 50:38.360]  They demand you pick a side.
[50:38.360 --> 50:39.360]  And it's difficult.
[50:39.360 --> 50:42.760]  I mean, coming from someone who has been a registered independent for a long time, I
[50:42.760 --> 50:44.160]  mean, people cannot handle that.
[50:44.160 --> 50:45.760]  They cannot handle that.
[50:45.760 --> 50:46.760]  They demand you pick a side.
[50:46.760 --> 50:49.440]  I tell you what, I have picked a side.
[50:49.440 --> 50:52.560]  It is the side of the way, the truth and the life.
[50:52.560 --> 50:58.920]  The only thing that I am allowing to lead me, or at least always trying to allow to lead
[50:58.920 --> 51:01.480]  me, is Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior.
[51:01.480 --> 51:04.880]  And that is the only way that I can make sense of anything, quite frankly, because both sides
[51:04.880 --> 51:09.040]  we have seen can be deceptive at times.
[51:09.040 --> 51:13.040]  And so it's all the more important to recognize this as a spiritual battle.
[51:13.040 --> 51:16.320]  So getting to the verse of the day, which I didn't get to at the beginning, because
[51:16.320 --> 51:21.200]  we had other stuff going on, but I'm sitting here, I'm going to have my verses of the day.
[51:21.200 --> 51:25.960]  So they are the Lord detests, this is from Proverbs 12, 22.
[51:25.960 --> 51:30.400]  The Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy.
[51:30.400 --> 51:35.680]  So Psalm 25, five, guide me in your truth and teach me for you are my God, my Savior,
[51:35.680 --> 51:38.720]  and my hope in you all day long.
[51:38.720 --> 51:44.640]  Psalm 25, five, guide me in your truth and teach me for you are God, my Savior, and my
[51:44.640 --> 51:50.120]  hope is in you all day long, because boy, it is hard to have hope.
[51:50.120 --> 51:55.720]  Now when you are exposed to the truth, when you take the red pill, when you're multi-dimensionally
[51:55.720 --> 52:02.080]  red-pilled as Dr. Robert Malone just said, sometimes you start to lose a little hope.
[52:02.080 --> 52:07.480]  But if our hope remains in our Lord and Savior, that hope cannot be shaken.
[52:07.480 --> 52:12.600]  And as the only way I can make sense of anything is when I know that my truth is determined
[52:12.600 --> 52:15.200]  by staying connected to God.
[52:15.200 --> 52:21.120]  And I try, I'm a human, so I am not perfect, but that is my goal, that is my hope.
[52:21.120 --> 52:25.640]  That's why I'm trying to be in the Word every single day, because how else can you make
[52:25.640 --> 52:28.600]  sense of this crazy world we live in, right?
[52:28.600 --> 52:30.480]  So there's the verses.
[52:30.480 --> 52:35.720]  And according to this article that I was looking at, there are some reasons to be optimistic
[52:35.720 --> 52:42.920]  in 2022 of this change, this shift as people wake up, you know.
[52:42.920 --> 52:47.560]  So six reasons to be, it says conservative, but I don't like all these labels.
[52:47.560 --> 52:51.720]  So I'm just going to say six reasons to be optimistic in 2022.
[52:51.720 --> 52:56.520]  Because cultural center is shifting to the right, the independent moderate voters make
[52:56.520 --> 53:01.320]  up approximately 20% of the electorate, and they're the ones that decide in which direction
[53:01.320 --> 53:02.560]  the country goes.
[53:02.560 --> 53:06.920]  So reason to be optimistic there.
[53:06.920 --> 53:10.680]  So for Black Lives Matter, the organization, of course, not the sentiment.
[53:10.680 --> 53:17.080]  A recent poll, which is a very left-leaning polling outfit, Civics, said their approval
[53:17.080 --> 53:20.720]  for BLM has dropped to just 44%.
[53:20.720 --> 53:27.760]  Maybe it's because the BLM funds have not been used to actually make any communities
[53:27.760 --> 53:33.720]  better or do anything for the group, but just buy a million-dollar houses.
[53:33.720 --> 53:36.000]  I don't know, maybe that has something to do with it.
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.240]  Opinions on abortion continue to move toward the pro-life movement.
[53:39.240 --> 53:44.200]  A full three-quarters of Americans reject the insane idea that men can be women and
[53:44.200 --> 53:48.200]  vice versa, and we're even seeing a shift to the right on gun control opinions.
[53:48.200 --> 53:51.880]  Now that was actually surprising for me to read, a full three-quarters of Americans reject
[53:51.880 --> 53:56.040]  the idea that men can be women and vice versa, because you wouldn't know it if you're just
[53:56.040 --> 54:00.680]  looking at all of the popular tech platforms.
[54:00.680 --> 54:12.000]  I mean, I cannot open a Snapchat without seeing something on transgender or that issue.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.480]  So I'm surprised that people are still rejecting it.
[54:15.480 --> 54:19.480]  The chance of let's go brand-in showing Americans, particularly the younger folks, are fed up
[54:19.480 --> 54:23.840]  with leftism, becoming increasingly vocal about the dissatisfaction.
[54:23.840 --> 54:27.800]  And then, number five, people are waking up to the left slides, particularly the gigantic
[54:27.800 --> 54:29.800]  COVID con.
[54:29.800 --> 54:35.160]  And so people are starting to ask questions, seeing that more and more.
[54:35.160 --> 54:38.280]  So as much as they try to hide the truth, they can't.
[54:38.280 --> 54:43.080]  The judicial branch of government serving as an effective bulwark against leftist tyranny
[54:43.080 --> 54:47.200]  from the other two branches, special election for two vacant Senate seats in Georgia last
[54:47.200 --> 54:49.880]  January, was devastating to the conservative movement in America.
[54:49.880 --> 54:53.640]  Both seats flipped blue, resulting in a 50-50 split.
[54:53.640 --> 55:01.680]  But then, as you'll see, that was the furthest left, but the court ruled against Biden's
[55:01.680 --> 55:06.120]  attempt to shut down Trump's Remain in Mexico immigration policy, federal courts have knocked
[55:06.120 --> 55:10.640]  down various provisions of Biden's tyrannical vaccine mandates, and SCOTUS will be addressing
[55:10.640 --> 55:11.640]  the matter as well.
[55:11.640 --> 55:16.840]  That remains to be seen, because I don't know about you guys, but it's a little bit nerve-wracking
[55:16.840 --> 55:20.160]  with what the Supreme Court's going to do.
[55:20.160 --> 55:22.920]  I don't know that we can fully trust them at this point.
[55:22.920 --> 55:23.920]  And then it says, number...
[55:23.920 --> 55:24.920]  Did I miss one?
[55:24.920 --> 55:26.920]  I feel like I missed one.
[55:26.920 --> 55:29.360]  Let me see real quick.
[55:29.360 --> 55:30.360]  Sorry.
[55:30.360 --> 55:31.360]  Oh, four.
[55:31.360 --> 55:32.360]  Yeah, no, I didn't.
[55:32.360 --> 55:33.360]  The judicial branch.
[55:33.360 --> 55:37.360]  And then, number three, we're entering an election year, since we're talking about Republicans.
[55:37.360 --> 55:42.160]  I mean, we've seen already some victories in this past election.
[55:42.160 --> 55:48.040]  And then, I mean, I don't know how anyone could vote for more of what we've been enduring,
[55:48.040 --> 55:51.880]  but I guess you just never know, especially since we have to have faith in our election
[55:51.880 --> 55:52.880]  system.
[55:52.880 --> 55:54.760]  But there is reason to have hope.
[55:54.760 --> 55:58.800]  Number two, young conservatives and government far outshine young leftists.
[55:58.800 --> 56:00.720]  Our future is bright.
[56:00.720 --> 56:03.040]  Republicans are stacked with sharp young up-and-comers.
[56:03.040 --> 56:06.040]  The party's undisputed leader continues to be Donald Trump, but waiting in the wings
[56:06.040 --> 56:09.080]  and ready to take charge, our scores of excellent conservatives.
[56:09.080 --> 56:14.000]  And, I mean, we have Ron DeSantis, definitely getting an award.
[56:14.000 --> 56:18.840]  And number one, because what other choice do we have but to have hope?
[56:18.840 --> 56:21.440]  That's a nice way to end it.
[56:21.440 --> 56:22.880]  What other choice do we have?
[56:22.880 --> 56:25.400]  But I think that there's always reason to have hope.
[56:25.400 --> 56:28.200]  There is the other verse, a hope deferred makes the heart sick.
[56:28.200 --> 56:32.280]  At times, I think many of us are battling that feeling, sick, you know, what is going
[56:32.280 --> 56:33.280]  on?
[56:33.280 --> 56:34.280]  What are we going to find out next?
[56:34.280 --> 56:36.840]  Are we in the last days?
[56:36.840 --> 56:37.840]  Definitely true.
[56:37.840 --> 56:39.200]  Hope deferred makes the heart sick.
[56:39.200 --> 56:44.360]  But we know who the final say is, and we know that God wins in the end.
[56:44.360 --> 56:49.800]  So then I was reading this article that I thought was satire at first, but it's actually
[56:49.800 --> 56:50.800]  not.
[56:50.800 --> 56:51.800]  It's from the Hill.
[56:51.800 --> 56:55.000]  Let's be honest, 2021 wasn't all bad.
[56:55.000 --> 56:59.560]  The economy is humming, they say, unemployment rate down to 4.2%.
[56:59.560 --> 57:06.280]  We talk about inflation going down and that since interest rates will surely be raised
[57:06.280 --> 57:11.240]  maybe twice or three times, that's going to get even better with no context of what that
[57:11.240 --> 57:15.000]  does to the entire economy and to our money as a whole.
[57:15.000 --> 57:21.720]  And then it even has this whole section on, wait until you see this, a scandal-free Biden
[57:21.720 --> 57:22.720]  administration.
[57:22.720 --> 57:25.880]  That's the way it should be, but isn't always.
[57:25.880 --> 57:29.360]  Think back four years ago, the Trump administration looked more like the Godfather without the
[57:29.360 --> 57:30.360]  skill.
[57:30.360 --> 57:36.160]  A scandal-free Biden administration, this whole thing has been a scandal.
[57:36.160 --> 57:40.440]  Maybe that's because the Hill was reporting on fake and phony news of a Russian collusion
[57:40.440 --> 57:42.720]  hoax and making up scandals.
[57:42.720 --> 57:46.720]  There's no scandal because you're not reporting on the scandals.
[57:46.720 --> 57:52.640]  This is a great sponsor.
[57:52.640 --> 57:56.840]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated

[58:00.920 --> 58:02.800]  in the world where you can see the sky.

[58:10.440 --> 58:13.360]  They supply the board for everybody with their systems as well.

[58:18.760 --> 58:21.600]  at Infowarsphone.com.
[58:21.600 --> 58:23.760]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[58:23.760 --> 58:24.760]  These aren't.
[58:24.760 --> 58:26.120]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[58:26.120 --> 58:31.960]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes, so the calls you were free
[58:31.960 --> 58:34.360]  or it's like a regular cell phone, you're not being tracked or traced.
[58:34.360 --> 58:35.760]  And I keep one in my car.
[58:35.760 --> 58:39.040]  I've given it to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones
[58:39.040 --> 58:40.040]  don't work.
[58:40.040 --> 58:41.040]  They work.
[58:41.040 --> 58:49.720]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.

[59:00.280 --> 59:03.960]  formulas ever, and it's now been reformulated as even stronger.
[59:03.960 --> 59:06.520]  It's Ultimate Bone Roth Plus.

[59:17.080 --> 59:19.160]  and potassium for electrolytes.
[59:19.160 --> 59:24.840]  It's got a real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch
[59:24.840 --> 59:25.840]  of sea salt.
[59:25.840 --> 59:26.840]  It even tastes better.
[59:26.840 --> 59:27.840]  Don't ask formula.
[59:27.840 --> 59:29.840]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[59:29.840 --> 59:35.960]  And again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein, isolate powder for better flavor
[59:35.960 --> 59:37.560]  and dissolvability.
[59:37.560 --> 59:38.560]  You're going to love this.
[59:38.560 --> 59:41.240]  And what it does for your joints, what it does for your body, what it does for your

[59:50.640 --> 59:58.920]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[59:58.920 --> 1:00:11.240]  Welcome back to Infowars.
[1:00:11.240 --> 1:00:14.800]  Bestie Lee, happy to be guest hosting today.
[1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:15.800]  Here's my verse of the day.
[1:00:15.800 --> 1:00:21.640]  Guide me in your truth and teach me for you are God, my Savior, and my hope is in you
[1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:23.480]  all day long.
[1:00:23.480 --> 1:00:29.920]  As we're searching for truth, as we're exposing truth, it's important to stay centered, stay
[1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:34.800]  balanced, make sure that we're looking to the truth, truth personified to make sure
[1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:39.800]  that we're always checking ourselves, you know, because the Bible also says the heart
[1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:44.480]  is deceitful above all things, so I want to make sure I'm open-minded enough to understand
[1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:48.440]  that there might be things that I'm deceived about, that my heart is deceived about.
[1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:54.120]  I think that's so important to keep that open mind because the alternative is the folks
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:01:00.960]  that we're fighting right now that are under mass formation psychosis, that are, they cannot,
[1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:06.360]  you can't even break the lies that they've been told because they are so convinced that
[1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:07.360]  that is the truth.
[1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:13.160]  Let's make sure that we keep ourselves open to truth revealed, and then also exposing
[1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:14.560]  the truth.
[1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:17.920]  All that's true, coming out in 2022.
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:20.640]  That's what I'm saying, and that's what I'm hoping for.
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:23.960]  And just want to remind you that you are going to want to stick around today because Harrison
[1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:29.240]  Smith will be doing SNL tonight, so just want to make sure that you are aware of that.
[1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:36.280]  He will be taking over for SNL, and I'm hoping to get an interview in here in this hour,
[1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:38.880]  but we'll see, we'll see.
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:44.680]  And also remind you that you can be sharing this whole concept of mass formation psychosis.
[1:01:44.680 --> 1:01:50.000]  You can find the article about how this is picking up steam on Infowars.com, it has a
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:54.800]  really nice comprehensive look, a clip from Joe Rogan and Dr. Robert Malone talking about
[1:01:54.800 --> 1:01:55.800]  this concept.
[1:01:55.800 --> 1:01:57.280]  You can share that article.
[1:01:57.280 --> 1:02:01.800]  You can also share the highlights of my interview with Dr. Robert Malone.
[1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:08.320]  That is up on band.video, and we're actually going to be playing part two of that in the
[1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:13.560]  next segment, so don't miss that if you haven't had a chance to see all of this.
[1:02:13.560 --> 1:02:18.520]  Like Alex was saying earlier, there are things that Dr. Robert Malone revealed in his interview
[1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:23.040]  with Joe Rogan that he and I didn't really get to, but there are actually other things
[1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:27.560]  that he and I talked about that he did not reveal or get into Joe Rogan.
[1:02:27.560 --> 1:02:31.680]  So if you really want the full experience, make sure you watch, take the time to watch
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:36.080]  all of that, and you know where to find it, and make sure you share, share, share, because
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:41.280]  Free World News TV is always a great one where you can get on Facebook and Twitter, share
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:47.760]  these information, and they won't, they haven't really caught on to censoring those, and make
[1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:53.360]  sure that you're staying up on all the information yourself so that you are not deceived.
[1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:58.280]  So wanted to talk about giving hope, because like I said before, hope deferred makes the
[1:02:58.280 --> 1:02:59.280]  heart sick.
[1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:02.880]  So let's always look and try and find positive news, things to uplift us in.
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:07.760]  Oh, look here, Judge Bloch's Biden's Vaccine Mandate for Federal Education Program.
[1:03:07.760 --> 1:03:08.760]  That's a win.
[1:03:08.760 --> 1:03:10.720]  Let's celebrate the wins when they have them.
[1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:14.840]  This came out on headlineUSA.com today.
[1:03:14.840 --> 1:03:19.120]  If the executive branch is allowed to usurp the power of the legislative branch to make
[1:03:19.120 --> 1:03:22.360]  laws, then this country is no longer a democracy.
[1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:25.160]  It is a monarchy.
[1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:28.320]  And then according to the Associated Press, President Joe Biden cannot require teachers
[1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:33.120]  in the Head Start Early Education Program to be vaccinated against COVID-19, a Louisiana
[1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:39.360]  federal judge ruled Saturday handing a victory to 24 states that had sued the federal government.
[1:03:39.360 --> 1:03:40.680]  So not everyone's giving up.
[1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:41.840]  People are fighting back.
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:48.640]  US District Judge Terry Doty wrote that the Biden administration unlawfully bypassed Congress
[1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:53.520]  when ordering that workers and Head Start programs be vaccinated by January 31st and
[1:03:53.520 --> 1:04:00.080]  that students two years or older be masked when indoors or when in close contact outdoors.
[1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:03.240]  Head Start is a federally funded program that promotes education for children under the age
[1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:05.240]  of six who are from low-income families.
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:07.880]  Isn't it strange that they're still pushing these things?
[1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:09.520]  Like you can't even figure that out.
[1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:13.800]  So you have Biden saying, it's up to the states now.
[1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:18.560]  We can't, this isn't a federal problem anymore, but then he still allows these federal mandates
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:23.920]  to be pushed and challenged and then thankfully struck down.
[1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:29.880]  And then you have, oh my gosh, I saw so many articles about children needing to be masked
[1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:31.560]  in school again.
[1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:37.960]  And even an email sent home from the school district that my children attend that says
[1:04:37.960 --> 1:04:44.160]  that masks are required, even though in Texas it's against the law to do that, but they're
[1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:45.160]  going to push them anyways.
[1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:51.360]  And this is all after many in the CDC and the CNN analysts and everything else said
[1:04:51.360 --> 1:04:53.200]  these cloth masks don't work.
[1:04:53.200 --> 1:04:55.440]  We've been saying that this whole time, but they're finally admitting it and they're
[1:04:55.440 --> 1:05:00.320]  still trying to require it.
[1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:05.720]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:06.720]  happening in the atmosphere.
[1:05:06.720 --> 1:05:11.080]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about my NASA and other governments
[1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:15.640]  and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:21.200]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[1:05:21.200 --> 1:05:23.960]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[1:05:23.960 --> 1:05:27.680]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s, 80s, and then it's going
[1:05:27.680 --> 1:05:30.680]  to be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[1:05:30.680 --> 1:05:32.360]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[1:05:32.360 --> 1:05:38.320]  But did you know that manmade climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United
[1:05:38.320 --> 1:05:42.200]  Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:47.600]  They have weather control treaties from 1979 and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather
[1:05:47.600 --> 1:05:48.600]  for a very long time.
[1:05:48.600 --> 1:05:53.280]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different
[1:05:53.280 --> 1:05:56.000]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:14.400]  So yes, manmade climate change is real.
[1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:26.880]  Tomorrow's news today, that is right, mass formation psychosis is going crazy on Twitter,
[1:06:26.880 --> 1:06:33.040]  going crazy with people searching it for Google and so of course Google is on it trying to
[1:06:33.040 --> 1:06:41.920]  bring up random dudes trying to criticize a concept rather than the experts that actually
[1:06:41.920 --> 1:06:42.920]  know what they're talking about.
[1:06:42.920 --> 1:06:47.160]  And like I said, tomorrow's news today, we've been talking about this concept, mass formation
[1:06:47.160 --> 1:06:48.160]  psychosis.
[1:06:48.160 --> 1:06:54.120]  You can find us a month ago, we were talking with Dr. Malone about this, a little over
[1:06:54.120 --> 1:06:58.320]  25 minute video about we are being hypnotized according to Dr. Malone.
[1:06:58.320 --> 1:07:00.440]  You can find that on BN.video.
[1:07:00.440 --> 1:07:05.800]  We've been talking about it but as Alex even says, we don't care who makes it pick up steam,
[1:07:05.800 --> 1:07:07.040]  we just want the information out.
[1:07:07.040 --> 1:07:11.120]  So happy that it's getting out, happy that it's getting out after his bombshell interview
[1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:17.920]  with Joe Rogan and very thankful that he decided to swing by and sit down with our first one
[1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:22.960]  in one person to person interview that had done multiple interviews with Dr. Malone before
[1:07:22.960 --> 1:07:27.760]  but it was always through Zoom and Skype and this time I got to sit down across from him.
[1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:32.480]  And so we want to play, we put together a 15 minute highlights video because we know
[1:07:32.480 --> 1:07:36.400]  not everyone can sit there for three hours or an hour plus.
[1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:40.320]  So we wanted to have a snackable version and we're going to play the second half of that.
[1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:44.200]  I played the first half of that in the first hour, we'll play the second half of that in
[1:07:44.200 --> 1:07:48.320]  this hour so you can see what you need to be sharing with your friends and family.
[1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:50.320]  Here it is.
[1:07:50.320 --> 1:07:56.160]  From basically European intellectual inquiry into what the heck happened in Germany in
[1:07:56.160 --> 1:08:00.520]  the 20s and 30s, very intelligent, highly educated population and they went barking
[1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:05.600]  mad and how did that happen?
[1:08:05.600 --> 1:08:08.600]  The answer is mass formation psychosis.
[1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:14.880]  When you have a society that has become decoupled from each other and has free-floating anxiety
[1:08:14.880 --> 1:08:20.800]  in a sense that things don't make sense, we can't understand it and then their attention
[1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:26.800]  gets focused by a leader or just a good guy.
[1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:31.720]  That's, I think that, you know, yeah, there's been some hits and all this and it's never
[1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:38.800]  fun to take these arrows from the media and as you know, they can be a little wicked from
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:42.840]  time to time.
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:51.240]  I've been on social media for a long time and I've kind of got desensitized to the
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:53.480]  trollery.
[1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:58.640]  That's been really helpful, just being able to say, hey, you know, they're haters in the
[1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:02.320]  world and that's just the way it is.
[1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:10.600]  I think the most, for me, it has been an awakening journey, there's no question.
[1:09:10.600 --> 1:09:17.760]  I didn't seek this, I never expected it, I find myself at the center of this storm of
[1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:25.320]  the resistance and that's what it is really and I'm still amazed.
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:35.440]  But it has profoundly changed my view of the information that we receive.
[1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:40.240]  You talk about me becoming more outspoken, I've seen that with my peers too.
[1:09:40.240 --> 1:09:46.320]  So for instance, Peter McCullough, he's kind of chilled out a little bit, but when you're
[1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:55.280]  attacked all the time and you have all of this weaponized information against you and
[1:09:55.280 --> 1:10:03.440]  no respect, I mean, I'm Mr. Malone who claims to have invented all this language, the kind
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:09.680]  of classic yellow journalism language, to have it all deployed against me is in absolutely
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:14.840]  no respect for what I actually did and they never cite all the patents, I mean, they just
[1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:16.360]  gloss over all that.
[1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:18.400]  And like you said, it's an information warfare.
[1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:25.240]  So Reuters is now coming after you with a fact check, particularly on the piece about
[1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:28.000]  risk reward benefit with children.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.040]  So you're fighting back with information.
[1:10:30.040 --> 1:10:32.800]  So tell me about that and how that's going.
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:40.920]  So having had the experience now of being subjected to this, it's not fair, it's not
[1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:43.960]  right, it's not proper and they don't care.
[1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:50.960]  It doesn't matter what the truth is, it matters what the storyline is that they want to promote.
[1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:54.960]  Having had that experience now a few times and dealt with the fact checkers and dealt
[1:10:54.960 --> 1:11:02.160]  with this young reporter at Atlantic Monthly and seeing how that all plays out.
[1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:07.240]  For instance, when Peter Navarro and I wrote the op-ed and put it in the Washington Times
[1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:12.320]  which by the way was the thing that triggered that Atlantic Monthly piece, in retrospect
[1:11:12.320 --> 1:11:18.160]  it's now clear, that was intended to shut me down because I was starting to speak at
[1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:23.440]  that point about policy and criticize the Biden policy.
[1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:28.320]  And the criticism, by the way, that I was making, the proposal that I was putting out
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:35.320]  was essentially that of the Great Barrington Declaration, which is these three fringe epidemiologists.
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:40.560]  Friends, I mean, they're from Harvard, Stanford, you know, but they're friends.
[1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:43.400]  Right, full professors.
[1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:52.400]  Yes, so having dealt with this, the question, so I get this new fact checker attack by the
[1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:56.920]  Reuters fact checker team, it sounds very official.
[1:11:56.920 --> 1:12:02.320]  And they have spoken to the MHRA and the MHRA has these comments that it listed.
[1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:07.320]  So this is the equivalent of the FDA in Great Britain, which by the way, up until the beginning
[1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:12.800]  of the year, was not doing any FDA type regulatory work, it was all being done by the Central
[1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:14.280]  European Union.
[1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:16.520]  So they're actually newbies at this, okay?
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:22.080]  And so they put out this statement to Reuters that they were quoting that was intrinsically
[1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:25.440]  full of falsehoods, like they said, for instance, there have been no pediatric deaths.
[1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:28.960]  Well, that took about two seconds to prove that false.
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:33.480]  You can cite the, if nothing else, you can cite the multiple media pieces coming out
[1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:36.960]  of Vietnam with the four kids that died from the Pfizer jab, okay?
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:43.960]  So that, and we, I reached out to my network and I got a huge volume of information about
[1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:49.000]  all the pediatric deaths and in VAERS and yellow card, Tess Laurie helped, I mean, I,
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:55.840]  it was, so the question, the question was, is, was there a way to flip the script on
[1:12:55.840 --> 1:12:58.080]  the fact checkers?
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:03.880]  And so I consulted with these media analysts and media warriors that I work with that wish
[1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:12.840]  for, I mean, confidential because they run big companies and we came up with a strategy
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:16.640]  because what happens is you'll write back to these guys and you'll say, well, here's
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:20.840]  the citation, here's the citation, here's the citation, and they'll ignore it and they'll
[1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:25.160]  go ahead and put out whatever attack and they'll say, you know, well, Dr. Malone cited some
[1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:28.280]  irrelevant documents that aren't properly peer reviewed or whatever.
[1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:30.440]  They'll trash whatever you put out, right?
[1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:35.080]  Because it's not about evaluating truth, it's about enforcing the narrative.
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:44.080]  So what we did, and I invite anybody to adopt this strategy that's under this kind of pressure,
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:52.320]  is I sent in a very terse brief quote to the fact checkers and I said, basically, thank
[1:13:52.320 --> 1:13:58.080]  you so much for the opportunity to respond and, you know, always trying to be nice because
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:03.840]  this is going to go public, and you can find the answers that you're looking for, the information
[1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:06.360]  that you're seeking at this website, bang.
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:10.600]  All right, let's pull it out of that right now.
[1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:14.080]  We'll play the last couple of minutes, perhaps later if we can.
[1:14:14.080 --> 1:14:20.120]  So just a little bit of background on this interview, this first sit-down with Dr. Malone.
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:27.560]  It was very interesting because I, just the journey, and that's a funny thing, too, is
[1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:33.440]  that was the sermon today on, for church, that I was listening to, is this journey.
[1:14:33.440 --> 1:14:38.000]  So for a new year, you always get like five steps to succeed in the new year, or three
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:44.360]  things to think about in the new year, and the sermon was just about how, this is a journey,
[1:14:44.360 --> 1:14:52.400]  and we need God's grace every day to navigate the journey, so there's no steps or anything.
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:56.160]  As far as that goes, it's just, it's taking the journey and that's why we don't know what's
[1:14:56.160 --> 1:14:57.160]  next half the time.
[1:14:57.160 --> 1:15:00.720]  And certainly, I never thought I'd be sitting here, if you had told me that like two or
[1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:04.760]  three years ago, that I would be sitting in an infowars chair, I would have been like,
[1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:05.760]  what?
[1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:06.760]  Yeah, right, you got to be kidding me.
[1:15:06.760 --> 1:15:12.520]  So it's just the journey, and as far as that goes, when I had left traditional media and
[1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:19.680]  was going out alone, you need to have like a little bit of a more national or global
[1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:23.120]  outlook on things, you know, because I'd always been a lead anchor for local news, and
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:27.640]  so I'm like, where do I even begin with finding like a national figure to interview, and I
[1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:31.320]  actually had some help with another independent journalist.
[1:15:31.320 --> 1:15:33.700]  When I reached out to her, I thought she had an interesting interview.
[1:15:33.700 --> 1:15:36.440]  She had me on her show, and I was like, ah, can you connect me with this guy?
[1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:42.480]  So Dr. Malone was my very first independent news journalist interview, and then here we
[1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:47.280]  are months later, and I got to sit down with him in person, right after he appeared on
[1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:48.280]  Joe Rogan.
[1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:51.720]  So it's just crazy how God has led the way through this.
[1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:58.720]  But good news, I'm going to be talking with that journalist who made the connection next.
[1:16:21.720 --> 1:16:28.720]  I'm going to be talking with that journalist who made the connection next.
[1:16:51.720 --> 1:17:00.800]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:05.480]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[1:17:05.480 --> 1:17:11.080]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:14.760]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:21.440]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down, protecting your privacy,
[1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:25.160]  protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos,
[1:17:25.160 --> 1:17:28.080]  protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:30.800]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.

[1:19:02.720 --> 1:19:04.720]  the globalists are doing right now.
[1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:06.440]  This is their big offensive.
[1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:07.920]  This is their takeover.
[1:19:07.920 --> 1:19:11.840]  This is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[1:19:11.840 --> 1:19:15.880]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[1:19:15.880 --> 1:19:16.880]  in the open.
[1:19:16.880 --> 1:19:21.400]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[1:19:21.400 --> 1:19:25.640]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[1:19:25.640 --> 1:19:28.920]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:33.600]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear, and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,

[1:19:53.320 --> 1:20:00.440]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:09.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:09.040 --> 1:20:23.680]  All right, what's true is coming out in 2022, that's what I'm going with.
[1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:29.480]  Dr. Malone's interview with Joe Rogan is going crazy, going viral, let's see if it hits as
[1:20:29.480 --> 1:20:33.160]  much as the Dr. Peter McCullough interview did.
[1:20:33.160 --> 1:20:37.200]  Now, talking about our journey and the journey that we're all going through, and we all have
[1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:42.440]  our own awakening journey, and it was such a riot to hear Dr. Malone, he did not respond
[1:20:42.440 --> 1:20:47.120]  the way I thought he would when I asked him if he'd been redpilled, he really took that
[1:20:47.120 --> 1:20:50.280]  to the next level, multi-dimensionally redpilled.
[1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:54.440]  So again, we've all gone through our own awakening journey, I know I have, and that's
[1:20:54.440 --> 1:20:58.240]  a part of how I connected with Dr. Malone is because I knew that he had had his awakening
[1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:04.000]  journey, and then another friend of mine who's become a friend of mine is Allison Morrow,
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  and she hit her awakening journey before I think either me or Dr. Malone.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:14.760]  She I consider one of the OGs of independent journalists who broke away, I feel like, sooner
[1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:20.200]  than a lot of us, and so happy to have her join me right now, Allison Morrow, thanks
[1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:21.200]  for being on.
[1:21:21.200 --> 1:21:23.960]  See, thanks for having me, always a pleasure.
[1:21:23.960 --> 1:21:28.120]  Now, did you ever think that you would make appearances on Info Wars as a long time traditional
[1:21:28.120 --> 1:21:29.120]  news journalist?
[1:21:29.120 --> 1:21:34.840]  No, I didn't, but you know what, when you texted me earlier, I'm on vacation in Florida,
[1:21:34.840 --> 1:21:38.800]  soaking up the vitamin D and the freedom, and I figured, anything for you, Chrissy,
[1:21:38.800 --> 1:21:40.680]  so fire away, what you got for me?
[1:21:40.680 --> 1:21:44.000]  Well, thank you for being an inspiration to me and others.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  As Allison and I have witnessed on Twitter, with the Twitter Wars, not every journalist
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:54.320]  is open to being awakened.
[1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:58.920]  We try our best to encourage other journalists, come on, wake up.
[1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:00.560]  This is not how this is supposed to work.
[1:22:00.560 --> 1:22:05.160]  This is not how traditional journalism is supposed to work, but not everyone is receptive.
[1:22:05.160 --> 1:22:10.280]  But I don't know if you had a chance to see any clips of Dr. Malone and I, but I wanted
[1:22:10.280 --> 1:22:16.360]  to talk about that because you interviewed Dr. Malone, I think, shortly after his interview
[1:22:16.360 --> 1:22:22.440]  on the Dark Horse podcast, which really propelled him into some circles, into some mainstream,
[1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:27.800]  into some, I guess, ridicule and criticism because he wasn't following the narrative.
[1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:34.080]  What has it been like for you to see, like, having interviewed him at then, and how you're
[1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:37.960]  seeing him talk with Joe Rogan and everything?
[1:22:37.960 --> 1:22:43.040]  I think what's the most interesting to me is how somebody like Dr. Malone goes from
[1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:48.920]  a person who has virtually no public recognition, really somebody who's obviously been running
[1:22:48.920 --> 1:22:54.320]  in the circles that he's been running in for decades, but not somebody whose name we know
[1:22:54.320 --> 1:23:01.480]  now ends up on the Rogan podcast and to watch how our old industry of corporate news has
[1:23:01.480 --> 1:23:07.560]  handled that, to me, it's just been really interesting to see from the inside this time
[1:23:07.560 --> 1:23:12.640]  as a new media person and not on the inside as a corporate news person, how all of this
[1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:13.640]  shakes out.
[1:23:13.640 --> 1:23:21.920]  Here I am now interviewing the person that my old industry has real issues with and has
[1:23:21.920 --> 1:23:24.440]  worked very hard to discredit.
[1:23:24.440 --> 1:23:31.400]  I think probably you've seen some of the same phenomena where you're like, wait a second,
[1:23:31.400 --> 1:23:32.400]  that's not that guy.
[1:23:32.400 --> 1:23:35.640]  Is that the same guy that I just talked to?
[1:23:35.640 --> 1:23:39.280]  I don't know if he's the same person you guys are describing.
[1:23:39.280 --> 1:23:44.040]  It really is interesting to see how the different narratives play out when you now actually
[1:23:44.040 --> 1:23:48.000]  know the person that the industry is talking about.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:52.920]  You can see so much more clearly how these narratives get spun.
[1:23:52.920 --> 1:23:56.760]  Let's talk about something else that I know that you are aware of in our industry in traditional
[1:23:56.760 --> 1:23:58.640]  news media.
[1:23:58.640 --> 1:24:03.120]  I know that in my newsroom, a popular term with, if we weren't quite sure what to say
[1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:08.280]  someone is, was just be like, oh, just say an expert says, right?
[1:24:08.280 --> 1:24:14.080]  No, we would say in our story, we would have somebody that could do the interview essentially
[1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:18.120]  and we would say, this expert says, and then you have somebody like Dr. Malone who they
[1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:24.120]  try and credit and it's just like, well, wait a minute, what constitutes as an expert anymore?
[1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:27.760]  Because he's a vaccinologist, an immunologist.
[1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:31.640]  He's been working with vaccines for 30 plus years.
[1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:34.600]  He's sat on the board of the Department of Defense.
[1:24:34.600 --> 1:24:43.160]  Even if you're going to argue the contentious point of whether or not he created mRNA vaccines,
[1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:45.240]  isn't this person still an expert?
[1:24:45.240 --> 1:24:46.240]  Right.
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:48.440]  No, that's such a great point.
[1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:51.080]  It's something that I did before I woke up.
[1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:57.680]  You're talking about sort of these waking up processes that we go through and I'm sure
[1:24:57.680 --> 1:25:03.080]  many times I would say, experts say, just experts say, and I see so clearly now how that's
[1:25:03.080 --> 1:25:04.600]  totally inaccurate.
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:09.120]  Just all experts say one thing and then there's this guy who says something different and
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:10.120]  you're right.
[1:25:10.120 --> 1:25:14.040]  It is a rhetorical device that I'm not even sure the vast majority of young journalists
[1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:19.000]  especially even know that they're using where you're just putting up whatever it is that
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:24.840]  already aligns with the mainstream acceptable position, especially whatever is acceptable
[1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:26.280]  in your newsroom.
[1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:33.160]  We're lining that up as the expert opinion against the person who's the outlier.
[1:25:33.160 --> 1:25:39.400]  I tell people all the time that that's one of the reasons that the outliers or the fringe
[1:25:39.400 --> 1:25:45.480]  rarely makes it into the mainstream talking points because we have such a high bar for
[1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:49.760]  somebody like Dr. Malone that we don't have for say the Department of Health.
[1:25:49.760 --> 1:25:54.680]  If the Department of Health sends us a press release, we just take it and repeat it.
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:58.080]  Our bar for them, whether we're going to fact check them is very low.
[1:25:58.080 --> 1:26:02.120]  Whereas if Dr. Malone comes to us and says, hey, listen, the Department of Health is selling
[1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:06.360]  you something and I want to tell you what it is because it's not what you think it is.
[1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:09.280]  We go, well, wait a second, we got to fact check this guy.
[1:26:09.280 --> 1:26:13.240]  We need hours or days or even weeks to make sure that he's legit.
[1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:16.400]  With the news cycle, the way it is, you often just don't do that.
[1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:20.480]  People like Dr. Malone don't make it in by virtue of just the fact, like I said, we have
[1:26:20.480 --> 1:26:26.960]  a very low bar for sort of the mainline establishment institutions and a very high bar for people
[1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:31.400]  like Dr. Malone that many of them just really can't cross over and so we say, well, sorry,
[1:26:31.400 --> 1:26:34.200]  you're just not going to make it in today's news or like you said, we'll put them up against
[1:26:34.200 --> 1:26:35.200]  the expert.
[1:26:35.200 --> 1:26:44.600]  I mean, even the vague, the vague word that we as traditional news accepted as far as
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:49.680]  like saying experts say, I mean, like it's so vague, like that that even became a thing.
[1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:54.240]  Like why couldn't we have interviewed somebody like Dr. Malone and call them like, vaccinologists
[1:26:54.240 --> 1:26:55.760]  or this vaccinologist.
[1:26:55.760 --> 1:27:00.200]  But it's just strange to me that even news as a whole has these vague words they use
[1:27:00.200 --> 1:27:01.720]  to describe people.
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:08.440]  Doctors say, experts say, nurses say, I mean, can't we be more descriptive and more intentional
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:10.600]  when we're, we're giving stories?
[1:27:10.600 --> 1:27:11.600]  Yes.
[1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:14.720]  I think it's really important to do that.
[1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:18.680]  And I, you know, I kind of wonder sometimes if part of the reason is just it's either
[1:27:18.680 --> 1:27:24.480]  intellectual laziness or it's just again, the speed of the news cycle for whatever,
[1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:25.840]  whatever the reason is, you're right.
[1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:29.240]  You should say this expert at this institution.
[1:27:29.240 --> 1:27:33.600]  So name the person where they work and that way you're at least signaling to the audience
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:39.280]  that they have buy-in on a particular narrative, you know, and then this expert who has a different
[1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:44.640]  opinion comes from this background instead of just saying, experts say, I also think
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:52.040]  that when we do that, it's just sort of push off responsibility onto the experts, whoever
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:53.840]  we are talking about.
[1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:58.360]  So if we, we just say experts say it's, it's a kind of, I think a legal way that corporate
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:01.320]  news says, well, we just said experts say we didn't say it.
[1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:05.960]  So if it ends up being entirely wrong and causing the destruction of mankind, we can
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:09.120]  say, well, the experts say it, you know, it wasn't us.
[1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:12.600]  I think it's kind of a way to punt responsibility.
[1:28:12.600 --> 1:28:18.400]  So it's funny because when I pointed out a former co-worker colleague, basically fake
[1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:23.080]  news that he was trying to push at the time, propaganda at the time, his pushback was,
[1:28:23.080 --> 1:28:26.040]  it's been widely sourced this information.
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:27.920]  I think it had to do with the Hunter Biden story.
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:31.880]  Oh, it's been widely sourced, he said it's been widely sourced that it's, it's Russian
[1:28:31.880 --> 1:28:32.880]  disinformation.
[1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:37.880]  I said, so you're saying your source is that it's been widely sourced.
[1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:38.880]  Right.
[1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:43.360]  So now, now we have just sources.
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:44.360]  Right.
[1:28:44.360 --> 1:28:45.360]  Yeah.
[1:28:45.360 --> 1:28:47.840]  And, you know, the other thing too that I think is really unfortunate, Christy, is
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:50.360]  that, wait, I want to know what you think is really unfortunate.
[1:28:50.360 --> 1:28:51.960]  So that's going to be the tease.
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:53.760]  You're coming back in the next segment.
[1:28:53.760 --> 1:28:58.520]  We're going to find out what Allison Waro thinks is really unfortunate.
[1:28:58.520 --> 1:29:03.120]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad, wait till they've
[1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:04.640]  got their world ID hand.
[1:29:04.640 --> 1:29:10.960]  And that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about and cloud swab and the UN and
[1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:15.680]  all the other globalist leaders own words they admit that once they've gotten you with
[1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:20.760]  that system, then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere you go and track what you
[1:29:20.760 --> 1:29:21.760]  do.
[1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:25.480]  And publicly they're saying they're going to decide when you can travel and when you
[1:29:25.480 --> 1:29:30.640]  can't travel and mastercard and then all the other big companies are currently announcing
[1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:36.000]  they're going to track what you do and where you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:39.600]  This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:29:39.600 --> 1:29:42.840]  This is the takeover and humanity better wake up and say no.
[1:29:42.840 --> 1:29:44.600]  Finally, folks are starting to wake up.
[1:29:44.600 --> 1:29:48.280]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others who leave the charts, along with them fours, but it's
[1:29:48.280 --> 1:29:49.280]  not enough.
[1:29:49.280 --> 1:29:54.080]  Every individual has to not comply and we have to talk about bringing the globalist to justice.
[1:29:54.080 --> 1:29:58.160]  You see, they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully.
[1:29:58.160 --> 1:30:02.680]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in infowars live products and that's
[1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:07.000]  why for more than two years we've been sold out of ultimate bone broth and we could never
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  get the ingredients again until now and we have reformulated and not just use the same
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  ingredients.
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:15.680]  We've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[1:30:15.680 --> 1:30:19.320]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you this is next level.
[1:30:19.320 --> 1:30:20.840]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[1:30:20.840 --> 1:30:25.880]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and its all ability.
[1:30:25.880 --> 1:30:30.800]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder and
[1:30:30.800 --> 1:30:35.440]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants and
[1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:38.960]  then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium
[1:30:38.960 --> 1:30:39.960]  added.
[1:30:39.960 --> 1:30:42.000]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:46.440]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch
[1:30:46.440 --> 1:30:48.440]  of sea salt and it just goes on and on.
[1:30:48.440 --> 1:30:54.240]  It is now back in stock ultimate bone broth plus available at 20% off and free shipping
[1:30:54.240 --> 1:30:58.400]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:58.400 --> 1:31:02.240]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[1:31:02.240 --> 1:31:07.480]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity.
[1:31:07.480 --> 1:31:10.040]  Well, that's why reset wars.com is so important.
[1:31:10.040 --> 1:31:15.920]  Not only is it a game changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[1:31:15.920 --> 1:31:18.720]  but it's something that gets around.
[1:31:18.720 --> 1:31:25.240]  It allows Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[1:31:25.240 --> 1:31:27.520]  It is the true digital economy.
[1:31:27.520 --> 1:31:32.560]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent or control.
[1:31:32.560 --> 1:31:38.320]  I've been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and God's
[1:31:38.320 --> 1:31:40.760]  divine empowerment and blessing.
[1:31:40.760 --> 1:31:44.960]  But I got to tell you out of everything I've done, reset wars is the most important and
[1:31:44.960 --> 1:31:51.520]  it is now available now the month of December 2021 is here at resetwars.com.
[1:31:51.520 --> 1:31:55.400]  Start your journey to the next level today at resetwars.com.
[1:31:55.400 --> 1:31:58.320]  The globalist fear this information.
[1:31:58.320 --> 1:32:02.280]  Since the end of World War II, the globalist have been building their private corporate
[1:32:02.280 --> 1:32:07.320]  world government whose end game once they get control is forced depopulation of the
[1:32:07.320 --> 1:32:08.320]  planet.
[1:32:08.320 --> 1:32:13.080]  That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all of
[1:32:13.080 --> 1:32:17.240]  you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much danger you
[1:32:17.240 --> 1:32:18.720]  and your family are in.
[1:32:18.720 --> 1:32:20.840]  The globalist are coming after everybody.
[1:32:20.840 --> 1:32:28.200]  They are setting up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist.
[1:32:28.200 --> 1:32:30.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars is the tip of the spear.
[1:32:30.560 --> 1:32:34.040]  Your investment in us over the years buying our products, spreading the word and praying
[1:32:34.040 --> 1:32:35.540]  for us has been incredible.
[1:32:35.540 --> 1:32:39.240]  But I'm telling you right now, we're about to lose not just info wars with the entire
[1:32:39.240 --> 1:32:41.120]  country and the world of tyranny.
[1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:45.840]  So now everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today and info warshore.com
[1:32:45.840 --> 1:32:49.480]  is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip
[1:32:49.480 --> 1:32:50.480]  of the spear.
[1:32:50.480 --> 1:32:51.480]  I will go down with the ship.
[1:32:51.480 --> 1:32:52.480]  I'm not going to back down.
[1:32:52.480 --> 1:32:55.960]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face, but I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless
[1:32:55.960 --> 1:32:56.960]  you support us.
[1:32:56.960 --> 1:33:00.080]  So please go to info warshore.com.
[1:33:00.080 --> 1:33:18.040]  Meeting a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:18.040 --> 1:33:19.040]  Welcome back to info wars.
[1:33:19.040 --> 1:33:25.800]  This is Christy Lee guest hosting this evening and I'm joined by a fellow independent journalist.
[1:33:25.800 --> 1:33:31.280]  She was one of the first to break away from the corporate controlled media and has been
[1:33:31.280 --> 1:33:35.360]  doing an amazing job, amazing things since is an inspiration to me.
[1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:39.240]  And I think as you get to know her, you will find her inspiring as well.
[1:33:39.240 --> 1:33:42.520]  So Alison Murrow, welcome back.
[1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:43.520]  Thank you.
[1:33:43.520 --> 1:33:44.520]  It's an honor to be here.
[1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:47.760]  So you were saying and hopefully, I mean, it's been like four minutes, so you might
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:51.400]  have forgotten by now, but you're saying something else is really unfortunate.
[1:33:51.400 --> 1:33:59.840]  I remember what I was saying is it's unfortunate that even when the news uses that rhetorical
[1:33:59.840 --> 1:34:06.720]  devices saying experts say versus somebody like Dr. Malone says to discredit what he's
[1:34:06.720 --> 1:34:12.080]  saying, when did it turn into that journalism is just confirming what everybody already
[1:34:12.080 --> 1:34:18.800]  says that that to me, even if all the experts, but one says something that doesn't mean that
[1:34:18.800 --> 1:34:24.120]  that journalism is just promoting what everybody else is saying.
[1:34:24.120 --> 1:34:29.320]  Journalism is about finding the one on the outside that has something else to share.
[1:34:29.320 --> 1:34:32.920]  Otherwise, we're just propaganda or marketing, as everybody always says.
[1:34:32.920 --> 1:34:37.960]  And here's a wild idea, examining conflicts and motivations of interest, conflicts of
[1:34:37.960 --> 1:34:38.960]  interest and motivations.
[1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:43.640]  I mean, that used to be a ton of journalism, but it's like it completely gets glossed over.
[1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:47.480]  There's no digging deeper into why somebody might be saying what they're saying.
[1:34:47.480 --> 1:34:53.680]  There's no digging deeper into why some of these people have connections to Pfizer and
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:56.360]  might want to promote the products.
[1:34:56.360 --> 1:35:00.800]  I mean, that's also been crazy to see.
[1:35:00.800 --> 1:35:02.720]  Have you noticed that as well?
[1:35:02.720 --> 1:35:06.120]  Yeah, well, yes, I have.
[1:35:06.120 --> 1:35:12.560]  And I think it's very odd that I worked in a newsroom in Seattle before I quit.
[1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:19.560]  And that was a newsroom that I would say would have been teed up to be very skeptical of,
[1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:22.680]  because Seattle's a very sort of crunchy, organic type city.
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:27.560]  And that's a market that liked talking about being critical of big pharma.
[1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:33.120]  But it's really interesting how everything has shifted during this COVID time.
[1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:39.080]  And so even people that you might normally think would be critical of the pharmaceutical
[1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:45.040]  industry and its ties with the government and how all of that plays out and their intense
[1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:50.160]  marketing and pressure on journalists, really, maybe they don't even realize they're becoming
[1:35:50.160 --> 1:35:53.560]  victims of their own narrative.
[1:35:53.560 --> 1:35:58.160]  Why right now, this is a time where you're not supposed to question, you're going to
[1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:02.160]  become a heretic, you're going to lead people to the slaughter if you do real journalism.
[1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:06.960]  And I think it's intentional when you see people censored or attacked on Twitter, for
[1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:11.520]  instance, or like you and I recently got blocked by a journalist for asking questions.
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:16.880]  When that becomes the norm, I think there is intense social pressure that the average
[1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:22.080]  journalist who is a human being like anybody else to fall in line, there's a lot of pressure
[1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:23.080]  to do that.
[1:36:23.080 --> 1:36:27.760]  And I don't think many of them who are falling line even realize that they're doing that.
[1:36:27.760 --> 1:36:28.760]  Yeah.
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:33.760]  And another thing that I think is fascinating is for me, what caused me to wake up and start
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:38.400]  to get red-pilled, if you will, because let's face it, Dr. Malone, you, me, we've all been
[1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:40.880]  on this journey of awakening.
[1:36:40.880 --> 1:36:46.080]  What did it for me is the intense censorship of the frontline doctors, because I was thinking
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:49.480]  like, well, if we're going to say, doctors say, what about these doctors?
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:53.400]  Why can't we have both sides, novel idea and journalism?
[1:36:53.400 --> 1:36:57.400]  So that's what really started to wake me up is just the intense censorship and actual
[1:36:57.400 --> 1:37:03.840]  ridicule from fellow journalists, say, you know, cheering this, this on of shutting their
[1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:04.840]  mouth.
[1:37:04.840 --> 1:37:05.840]  And I'm like, what happened to free press and free speech?
[1:37:05.840 --> 1:37:09.120]  But for you, it was really personal and actually had to do with the vaccine.
[1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:11.800]  So I want you to review that again.
[1:37:11.800 --> 1:37:15.400]  You mean the reason one of the last stories that I was told I wasn't allowed to cover?
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:16.400]  Yes.
[1:37:16.400 --> 1:37:17.400]  Is that what you're talking about?
[1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:18.400]  Yeah.
[1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:25.520]  So right, this was before COVID and Washington state was debating in the legislature whether
[1:37:25.520 --> 1:37:29.640]  there should be mandated vaccines in school with no exemptions.
[1:37:29.640 --> 1:37:34.000]  So they were going to take away, I think, the philosophical religious exemption for
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  the vaccines.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:38.880]  And so this was a topic that was being debated and we were covering as a news station.
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:43.680]  Now I was not personally covering it because I covered the environment, but I had heard
[1:37:43.680 --> 1:37:49.120]  that there was a conference of doctors coming to town for informed choice Washington.
[1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:53.320]  And these were doctors that were concerned about mandated vaccines for all children at
[1:37:53.320 --> 1:37:54.320]  schools.
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:58.760]  And I had never heard about doctors who disagreed with mandated vaccines.
[1:37:58.760 --> 1:38:00.720]  I just thought every doctor did.
[1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:06.520]  So I was curious to hear what these doctors had to say and thinking that my newsroom might
[1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:11.000]  be interested in hearing what they had to say instead of just pitting a soccer mom against
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:12.440]  the Department of Health.
[1:38:12.440 --> 1:38:13.800]  I pitched the idea.
[1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:16.640]  Now again, I wasn't going to be the person going to cover it because that wasn't my
[1:38:16.640 --> 1:38:21.480]  beat, but I was passing the email along thinking that's what a journalist does.
[1:38:21.480 --> 1:38:24.360]  The assignment desk, no, and another reporter can go cover it.
[1:38:24.360 --> 1:38:25.600]  Hey, these doctors are in town.
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:29.880]  Maybe this would be a way to elevate our coverage because these are actual doctors.
[1:38:29.880 --> 1:38:32.320]  Let's put them up against the Department of Health.
[1:38:32.320 --> 1:38:37.640]  And my boss told me that I was never allowed to pitch another story about vaccines.
[1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:41.280]  If I wanted to pitch it, I had to go directly to him, but I couldn't just send an email
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:42.280]  to the assignment desk.
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:46.520]  So imagine being a journalist who it's not even that you're covering it.
[1:38:46.520 --> 1:38:47.520]  All right.
[1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:50.000]  My boss wasn't saying to me that I couldn't go out and cover it because he felt like
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.640]  I was biased or I had other issues.
[1:38:52.640 --> 1:38:54.840]  He was literally saying I couldn't pitch the story.
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:38:59.840]  I could not even talk about vaccines in the newsroom because it's so crazy.
[1:38:59.840 --> 1:39:01.600]  Did he give you a reason?
[1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:04.120]  It's unbelievable.
[1:39:04.120 --> 1:39:08.520]  Just that he said he wouldn't let anyone question vaccines in the same way he wouldn't
[1:39:08.520 --> 1:39:10.160]  let anyone question climate change.
[1:39:10.160 --> 1:39:12.480]  That was all that was told to me.
[1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:13.480]  Wow.
[1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:15.000]  So I would have been with my news director.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  So you're saying I'm a journalist that's not allowed to ask questions.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  Yeah.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:24.280]  I mean, essentially, I did say, well, should I just come to you and never pitch anything
[1:39:24.280 --> 1:39:25.480]  ever in the newsroom ever again?
[1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:27.080]  I mean, this is starting to get ridiculous.
[1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:30.520]  Obviously, that was the beginning, really, of the end for me.
[1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:34.480]  We were running a stand for truth campaign at the time, a big marketing campaign in our
[1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:35.480]  area.
[1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:41.040]  And I remember saying to people at the time, stand for truth except for vaccines and a
[1:39:41.040 --> 1:39:44.160]  few other things because we don't ask questions there.
[1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:45.880]  But Chrissy, I was taken totally aback.
[1:39:45.880 --> 1:39:50.120]  I never faced anything that blatant as far as censorship is concerned.
[1:39:50.120 --> 1:39:54.520]  We could talk all day about subtle self-censorship and editorializing and that kind of stuff
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:55.520]  in newsrooms.
[1:39:55.520 --> 1:39:56.920]  But I'd never had anything like that happen.
[1:39:56.920 --> 1:40:01.160]  So for that to happen on vaccines, that really woke me up that vaccines, for whatever reason,
[1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:04.920]  are one of those topics that are no-goes in a lot of newsrooms or at least that we're
[1:40:04.920 --> 1:40:05.920]  in mind.
[1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:06.920]  Untouchables.
[1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:07.920]  Do you wonder where this directive comes from?
[1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:11.360]  Do you think this was his own opinion or do you think he had gotten a directive from
[1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:12.800]  above him?
[1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:18.960]  I think in that particular case, he was very self-righteous that he was doing the public's
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:24.280]  work and protecting the public by not allowing these crazy doctors or whoever he looked at
[1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:26.600]  them to be on our air.
[1:40:26.600 --> 1:40:29.440]  I really believe that for him, that was a personal conviction.
[1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:30.440]  And you know what?
[1:40:30.440 --> 1:40:34.960]  Maybe it was my bad and I should have gone up the ladder and said, hey, this is insane.
[1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:36.800]  But you know, this is the problem.
[1:40:36.800 --> 1:40:40.600]  That person so manages a newsroom, not the same one, but he does manage another newsroom.
[1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:43.720]  And there are a lot of other people out there who believe the same way.
[1:40:43.720 --> 1:40:47.640]  So when you're like the one person in the newsroom that's willing to stick your neck
[1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:52.760]  out and then your manager, whatever the topic is, signals to you that there are untouchable
[1:40:52.760 --> 1:40:53.760]  topics.
[1:40:53.760 --> 1:40:56.280]  If you're someone who's like really nervous about keeping your job, you're not just going
[1:40:56.280 --> 1:40:58.200]  to start censoring on that topic.
[1:40:58.200 --> 1:41:00.600]  You're going to start looking over your shoulder on a lot of different things.
[1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:03.080]  And that's a major problem in newsrooms these days.
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:06.600]  Managers that are saying to people, you're not allowed to question, there are topics
[1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:10.840]  that are just completely off limits for you and you better be careful.
[1:41:10.840 --> 1:41:15.400]  It's just so crazy that this is the current state of our current newsrooms.
[1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:17.400]  And we need more journalists to wake up.
[1:41:17.400 --> 1:41:22.200]  We need more of society to wake up that this is how this is functioning, that journalists
[1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:24.320]  are actually discouraged from asking questions.
[1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:28.080]  Now before you go, I just, do you have any comment on this whole mass formation psychosis
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:29.480]  and people's intrigue with it?
[1:41:29.480 --> 1:41:34.440]  And Dr. Malone talking about it, I'm fascinated by it.
[1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:39.240]  I have a master's degree, actually a master divinity degree with a specialization in psychology
[1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:40.240]  and counseling.
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:44.360]  And I honestly think, Chrissy, I've said if I teach a college class for journalists,
[1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:50.600]  I want to teach the psychology or the spirituality of journalism because I think there's so much
[1:41:50.600 --> 1:41:57.080]  here to pick apart if you were to start really trying to give new journalists a better start
[1:41:57.080 --> 1:41:59.560]  at getting into the field as critical thinkers.
[1:41:59.560 --> 1:42:06.680]  I really believe that this is the heart of how training and critical thinking needs to
[1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:09.800]  be relayed to people who want to get into journalism.
[1:42:09.800 --> 1:42:11.360]  You can learn how to hold a camera.
[1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:12.360]  You can learn how to edit.
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:15.040]  You can learn how to write on the job.
[1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:19.120]  But this is something that I think more people need to be paying attention to because I don't
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:26.320]  have any other way to explain honestly why I see some people wanting to ask questions
[1:42:26.320 --> 1:42:30.640]  and other people that think it's just completely off limits in the journalism world.
[1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:35.360]  I really have no other way to understand it other than psychology or even spirituality.
[1:42:35.360 --> 1:42:38.360]  So there's definitely the spiritual element to this.
[1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:42.800]  I just want you to be able to pitch where we can find you real quick before you go.
[1:42:42.800 --> 1:42:43.800]  Yeah.

[1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:04.640]  Go ahead.
[1:44:04.640 --> 1:44:05.640]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:44:05.640 --> 1:44:06.640]  Good, Alex.
[1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:07.640]  Great last caller.
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:09.840]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[1:44:09.840 --> 1:44:15.000]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization and
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  absurdity.
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.200]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[1:44:18.200 --> 1:44:19.200]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[1:44:19.200 --> 1:44:20.200]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:21.200]  Go ahead.
[1:44:21.200 --> 1:44:22.200]  Hey, Alex.
[1:44:22.200 --> 1:44:23.200]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:25.640]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[1:44:25.640 --> 1:44:27.280]  The X2 group does wonders.
[1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:28.280]  They recommend it to everybody.
[1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:29.680]  You're on the fence about it.
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:30.680]  Get off the fence.
[1:44:30.680 --> 1:44:31.680]  Get the product.
[1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:32.680]  Support the infowar.
[1:44:32.680 --> 1:44:33.680]  Tyler in Maine.
[1:44:33.680 --> 1:44:34.680]  You're on the air.
[1:44:34.680 --> 1:44:35.680]  Thanks for holding.
[1:44:35.680 --> 1:44:36.680]  Go ahead.
[1:44:36.680 --> 1:44:37.680]  Hey, Alex.
[1:44:37.680 --> 1:44:38.680]  It's great to be on with you.
[1:44:38.680 --> 1:44:39.680]  It's an honor.
[1:44:39.680 --> 1:44:40.680]  Honour talk to you.
[1:44:40.680 --> 1:44:41.680]  Awesome.
[1:44:41.680 --> 1:44:45.480]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products, alpha power, even at 29.
[1:44:45.480 --> 1:44:50.320]  You asked my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom, so just number one
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:51.320]  for a few of us there.
[1:44:51.320 --> 1:44:52.320]  Well, it definitely works.
[1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:53.320]  It's not a joke.
[1:44:53.320 --> 1:44:54.320]  Absolutely.
[1:44:54.320 --> 1:45:02.000]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:06.360]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[1:45:06.360 --> 1:45:12.280]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:17.080]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do, so in the future under
[1:45:17.080 --> 1:45:20.920]  their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[1:45:20.920 --> 1:45:25.120]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:28.760]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.

[1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:06.600]  the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[1:46:06.600 --> 1:46:10.080]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your
[1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:15.800]  house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their
[1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:21.040]  facilities and they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they
[1:46:21.040 --> 1:46:25.560]  come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:46:25.560 --> 1:46:29.200]  This is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is
[1:46:29.200 --> 1:46:33.560]  to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very
[1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:38.480]  compliant meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarstore.com.

[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:19.360]  Welcome back to Info Wars, this is Christy Lee guest hosting.
[1:47:19.360 --> 1:47:23.080]  This is our final segment and then Harrison Smith will be taking over for Sunday Night
[1:47:23.080 --> 1:47:26.640]  Live, taking your phone calls and covering his important news subjects.
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:30.600]  I didn't get to a lot of the stuff that I wanted to talk about because we've been talking
[1:47:30.600 --> 1:47:36.320]  about other things and reviewing the videos that are going viral now particularly the
[1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:41.800]  videos between Joe Rogan and Robert Malone and then our own interview with Robert Malone
[1:47:41.800 --> 1:47:46.640]  which you can find on vn.video and there is a highlights version that we were showing
[1:47:46.640 --> 1:47:51.920]  clips of earlier that you can also share if for those of your friends and family that
[1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:58.800]  can only have snackable contents that is about 15 minutes as opposed to the three hour long
[1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:03.560]  Joe Rogan interview or the hour plus full interview with myself.
[1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:07.760]  So wanted to get to some other content to close out the show, we were talking about
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:13.720]  how I'm just continuing to see more articles about requiring students to be masked when
[1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:22.360]  they go back to school even in Texas where there's supposed to be a mandate against the
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:27.320]  mask mandates but the school still signs out an email that they're requiring masks meanwhile
[1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:33.840]  even those that have been touting mask usage are now saying that cloth masks don't work.
[1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:36.440]  Want to show you that video, here it is number one.
[1:48:36.440 --> 1:48:39.680]  Please tell us something Andy.
[1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:45.280]  I guess we're going to go to a different one, sorry here we go.
[1:48:45.280 --> 1:48:51.720]  Record high and concerned about sending my son back into a preschool even with a mask
[1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:52.720]  on.
[1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:53.720]  What do you tell parents?
[1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:57.520]  Are cloth masks just not good enough anymore?
[1:48:57.520 --> 1:48:58.520]  Anymore.
[1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:01.480]  Cloth masks aren't going to provide a lot of protection, that's the bottom line.
[1:49:01.480 --> 1:49:05.640]  This is an airborne illness, we now understand that and a cloth mask is not going to protect
[1:49:05.640 --> 1:49:08.720]  you from a virus that's spread through airborne transmission.
[1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:13.360]  That could protect better through droplet transmission, something like the flu but not something like
[1:49:13.360 --> 1:49:14.360]  this coronavirus.
[1:49:14.360 --> 1:49:18.040]  We have to recognize this has not been a benign disease in young children, there's a perception
[1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:20.400]  that young children have a good hand.
[1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:24.280]  This is what's crazy, you saw the reporter saying like our cloth mask is just not going
[1:49:24.280 --> 1:49:30.240]  to cut it anymore as if they cut it before but now they can't cut it and then he says
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:35.200]  we now know this is airborne, wait what you didn't know that before that it was airborne.
[1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:40.320]  So these are the types of things that you got called misinformation or censored for
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:45.000]  if you said these masks don't work, particularly the ones that everyone's wearing, how many
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:49.320]  people do you see actually walking around in the grocery store or students in school
[1:49:49.320 --> 1:49:54.520]  that have an N95 mask, they've always worn the cloth masks and so now we're actually
[1:49:54.520 --> 1:50:00.720]  hearing the admittance that they don't work yet they are still pushing them, it makes
[1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:01.720]  no sense.
[1:50:01.720 --> 1:50:04.760]  It's really hard to understand how this is all playing out.
[1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:08.480]  Now I did want to bring in, oh actually I want to talk about this.
[1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:13.560]  So I saw this article, this is a little bit older but it was just reposted from one of
[1:50:13.560 --> 1:50:18.280]  the local news stations, Japanese professor invents TV screen that you can lick.
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:24.320]  So we're talking about all these ways to stay healthy and not contaminate, wear masks and
[1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:30.360]  stay at home, whatever and then you see this article, oh Japanese professor invents a TV
[1:50:30.360 --> 1:50:34.640]  screen that you can lick so my thought is like wow that sounds really sanitary, doesn't
[1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:35.800]  that look sanitary?
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:40.040]  I can watch something with ice cream and then I'll lick it, oh that tastes great, here
[1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:41.200]  you want to taste it too?
[1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:44.320]  And then we're just passing germs back and forth, isn't that great?
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:47.320]  You know it's just like they don't even believe they're on lies.
[1:50:47.320 --> 1:50:52.040]  So it says a Japanese university student, Yuki Hu, I'm not sure if I'm saying that right,
[1:50:52.040 --> 1:50:55.160]  tells the machine she wants to eat chocolate and moments later a transparent film with
[1:50:55.160 --> 1:51:00.760]  liquid droplets slides out on top of a screen showing luscious gooey chocolate, this is so
[1:51:00.760 --> 1:51:01.760]  gross.
[1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:02.760]  Who licks the film?
[1:51:02.760 --> 1:51:06.920]  It actually tastes like milk chocolate, it's sweet and tasty she says in a demonstration
[1:51:06.920 --> 1:51:11.320]  of a prototype lickable TV screen that can imitate food flavors.
[1:51:11.320 --> 1:51:15.320]  So then this article goes I'm thinking like okay this seems like the totally wrong time
[1:51:15.320 --> 1:51:19.200]  to bring something out like this, if they're going to be touting cloth masks and then oh
[1:51:19.200 --> 1:51:24.800]  wait look here's something y'all can lick and pass around but this actually mentions
[1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:30.440]  COVID, it says in the COVID-19 era it's in the same article, this is insane, this kind
[1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:37.000]  of technology can enhance the way people connect and interact, what I'm so confused
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:40.920]  in the COVID-19 era this kind of technology can enhance the way people connect and interact
[1:51:40.920 --> 1:51:42.680]  with the outside world.
[1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:47.000]  So if you're at home you can just lick your screen, it's going to be great, pass it to
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:53.320]  your family members, friends, you can all just lick the same thing, oh but wear a mask
[1:51:53.320 --> 1:51:58.320]  at the same time, this is the idiocy, it's insane, well as long as we're talking about
[1:51:58.320 --> 1:52:06.600]  idiocy, it seems that it takes being inebriated to recognize, for some, for those on the left
[1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:10.840]  it takes them being inebriated to recognize the idiocy perhaps.
[1:52:10.840 --> 1:52:14.400]  I think that's what we were getting from Neera's Eve, take a look at this clip number
[1:52:14.400 --> 1:52:15.400]  two.
[1:52:15.400 --> 1:52:17.880]  Please tell us something Andy.
[1:52:17.880 --> 1:52:20.800]  Watching Mayor de Vosio.
[1:52:20.800 --> 1:52:21.800]  Don't go on a rant.
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:22.800]  Who is?
[1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:23.800]  Don't go on a rant.
[1:52:23.800 --> 1:52:32.800]  It's a overlap dance after four years of the craftiest job as the mayor of New York.
[1:52:32.800 --> 1:52:41.800]  The only thing that Democrats and Republicans can agree on is what a horrible mayor he has
[1:52:41.800 --> 1:52:42.800]  been.
[1:52:42.800 --> 1:52:43.800]  Wow.
[1:52:43.800 --> 1:52:53.600]  So Sayonara Saka, 2022, it's a new year because guess what, I have a feeling I'm going to be
[1:52:53.600 --> 1:52:59.640]  standing right here next year and you know what, I'm not going to be looking at dancing
[1:52:59.640 --> 1:53:06.160]  as the city comes aboard you.
[1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:11.320]  So that's what it takes I guess to get some rational thought and some acceptance of what's
[1:53:11.320 --> 1:53:12.320]  really going on.
[1:53:12.320 --> 1:53:17.040]  You got to think about this, Andy Cohen was standing in New York which is always packed,
[1:53:17.040 --> 1:53:20.440]  you know, when the ball drops and he's standing there was like nobody there.
[1:53:20.440 --> 1:53:24.480]  I'm sure you saw the pictures, there was like nobody there, they're all scared of their
[1:53:24.480 --> 1:53:25.480]  minds.
[1:53:25.480 --> 1:53:29.640]  I mean they were able to, you know, truck in some drag queens, you know, and some wokeness
[1:53:29.640 --> 1:53:35.400]  for the event of course, but nobody else was there, only the woke people and he's actually
[1:53:35.400 --> 1:53:40.400]  saying what everybody else is thinking that like Sayonara to the worst mayor ever and
[1:53:40.400 --> 1:53:44.520]  Anderson Cooper is just so uncomfortably, he's like, oh, he's breaking from the narrative.
[1:53:44.520 --> 1:53:46.360]  What are we going to do?
[1:53:46.360 --> 1:53:52.400]  That wasn't approved to say on this news station, so just a riot to see I guess that's what
[1:53:52.400 --> 1:53:57.280]  it takes is for a little drinks in you to be able to speak the truth.
[1:53:57.280 --> 1:53:58.280]  So what else can I talk about?
[1:53:58.280 --> 1:54:06.080]  Oh, speaking of BS on the news, what about our friend BS, Brian Stelter, having, oh my
[1:54:06.080 --> 1:54:10.400]  gosh, like having a full on breakdown, let's take a look at clip number three.
[1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:15.720]  And we're still learning more about the attack and we're still processing what it meant to
[1:54:15.720 --> 1:54:17.280]  the country into our lives.
[1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:21.920]  So Hunter, is there a disconnect between the people who were there that day in DC and the
[1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:25.720]  people who were not, you know, someone like me only watched it on TV.
[1:54:25.720 --> 1:54:27.760]  Will I ever really get it?
[1:54:27.760 --> 1:54:32.040]  You know, I think this was a really unique incident in part because of when it happened
[1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:33.400]  during the pandemic.
[1:54:33.400 --> 1:54:38.480]  This was a pre vaccination moment and a lot of the DC press corps was, you know, working
[1:54:38.480 --> 1:54:40.720]  from home, working remotely.
[1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:44.720]  And unless they were the Capitol Hill press corps, like I believe Grace was or someone
[1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:49.480]  like myself who went out to cover the protests, they didn't see this firsthand.
[1:54:49.480 --> 1:54:54.880]  And while, you know, we were there on scene due to the crowds, due to the law enforcement
[1:54:54.880 --> 1:54:56.720]  response, cell signals were jammed.
[1:54:56.720 --> 1:55:00.080]  So there was a bit of a delay also in that footage getting out.
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:01.080]  That's a great point.
[1:55:01.080 --> 1:55:02.080]  And I think that distance.
[1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:03.080]  All right, let's pull out of that.
[1:55:03.080 --> 1:55:04.880]  So there was a delay in that footage getting out.
[1:55:04.880 --> 1:55:10.000]  What about the delay in the footage of the rest of the footage that we need to be able
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  to see?
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  It's insane.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:15.880]  And Brian Stelter is saying, watch how this Twitter user Max reporters were talking candidly
[1:55:15.880 --> 1:55:22.240]  about the trauma, the drama associated with the Capitol attack, insane, but they don't
[1:55:22.240 --> 1:55:28.440]  ever talk about the violence that was perpetuated by BLM, about the burning down at the mostly
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:30.040]  peaceful protests.
[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:31.880]  It's insane.
[1:55:31.880 --> 1:55:38.600]  Like I always say, his name is Brian Stelter, initials BS and it's also fitting with how
[1:55:38.600 --> 1:55:40.480]  he reports the news.
[1:55:40.480 --> 1:55:41.480]  And think about it.
[1:55:41.480 --> 1:55:46.280]  This is not even the anniversary of January 6th.
[1:55:46.280 --> 1:55:50.920]  Can you imagine the meltdown that we're going to see the wall-to-wall coverage on MSM on
[1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:53.360]  January 6th?
[1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:57.920]  Might as well just turn your TVs completely off because they're probably going to be crying.
[1:55:57.920 --> 1:55:59.760]  They're going to be pulling out their hair.
[1:55:59.760 --> 1:56:00.760]  It's going to be insane.
[1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:05.160]  Yeah, this isn't even on January 6th yet and they're still having a conniption over
[1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:06.160]  this.
[1:56:06.160 --> 1:56:12.320]  They're going to, of course, elevate the numbers, including suicides days and months later,
[1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:16.200]  including the officer that was supposedly bludgeoned by a fire extinguisher, even though
[1:56:16.200 --> 1:56:18.760]  that was made up in completely fake, phony and false.
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:24.160]  Never talking about Ashley about it, but I mean, when you have that big of a head, I
[1:56:24.160 --> 1:56:26.920]  guess you just drive yourself crazy.
[1:56:26.920 --> 1:56:33.080]  I don't know, but it's insane to see and so easy to make fun of.
[1:56:33.080 --> 1:56:36.840]  But speaking of violence, I don't know if we have time to throw a little bit of seriousness
[1:56:36.840 --> 1:56:37.840]  into this.
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:42.840]  Take a look at what was happening in Amsterdam real quick, just to end out the show.
[1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:45.840]  Number four.
[1:56:45.840 --> 1:57:08.760]  Now, that's craziness.
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:15.000]  That is people mauled by police dogs beaten with batons at an unauthorized protest against
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:16.880]  COVID restrictions in Amsterdam.
[1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:21.560]  So these people are protesting for freedom and this is the response they get mauled by
[1:57:21.560 --> 1:57:22.960]  dogs.
[1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:23.960]  That's true violence.
[1:57:23.960 --> 1:57:29.440]  I don't see any of the news anchors crying about that, crying about the actual loss of
[1:57:29.440 --> 1:57:36.920]  our freedom, crying and having trauma over the fact that our country is sinking and people
[1:57:36.920 --> 1:57:42.520]  are dying and people are being held from the life-saving truth, life-saving treatment.
[1:57:42.520 --> 1:57:48.240]  How about you feel traumatic about that, Brian Stelter, thanks for watching.
[1:57:48.240 --> 1:57:50.520]  Christmas 2021 is gone.
[1:57:50.520 --> 1:57:55.840]  It's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going to

[1:58:47.960 --> 1:58:52.640]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[1:58:52.640 --> 1:58:58.240]  between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other
[1:58:58.240 --> 1:59:01.880]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[1:59:01.880 --> 1:59:06.080]  From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the bricks of the UK, nations
[1:59:06.080 --> 1:59:09.720]  were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[1:59:09.720 --> 1:59:15.160]  That's why they launched their great reset and their program after collapsing us of Build
[1:59:15.160 --> 1:59:16.920]  Back Better.
[1:59:16.920 --> 1:59:22.880]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[1:59:22.880 --> 1:59:27.200]  Because they couldn't take our guns, because we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is
[1:59:27.200 --> 1:59:32.560]  the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win, they released a biological weapon
[1:59:32.560 --> 1:59:33.560]  on us.
[1:59:33.560 --> 1:59:38.560]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago, it's that simple,
[1:59:38.560 --> 1:59:42.440]  they can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns, so the global corporate
[1:59:42.440 --> 1:59:45.840]  combined released COVID-19, and you know the rest is history.
[1:59:45.840 --> 1:59:49.760]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[1:59:49.760 --> 2:00:10.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
