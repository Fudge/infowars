[00:00.000 --> 00:29.120]  It is Thursday, July 19th, 2018 and there is so much news to get to and cover here today
[00:29.120 --> 00:35.960]  on the Alex Jones show that even when Alex goes away to try to take a vacation, wild
[00:35.960 --> 00:40.480]  horses cannot drag him away because the news is simply too big. Alex joins me now on the
[00:40.480 --> 00:44.840]  phone. He's going to be with us at least for the first hour. Alex, I'm not sure what the
[00:44.840 --> 00:50.680]  biggest news to you today is, but it is a real plethora out here and all of it's important.
[00:50.680 --> 00:56.720]  Well, I mean, centrally, this is the most important thing. Just be clear, I wasn't clear
[00:56.720 --> 01:00.960]  with you. I was just dealing with some family issues with my wife's family and some family
[01:00.960 --> 01:04.760]  she's had that's been ill. That's what I took these few days off. I did this a few weeks
[01:04.760 --> 01:08.760]  ago, but I'm going to be working here from the road and I really appreciate you and the
[01:08.760 --> 01:12.720]  rest of the crew doing a superlative job. I mean, here's the headline. Trump says he'll
[01:12.720 --> 01:17.800]  have another meeting with Putin, again, calls the media the enemy of the people and the
[01:17.800 --> 01:23.240]  enemy of peace and says they want war. And it's absolutely true. And now the Democrats
[01:23.240 --> 01:30.400]  and Republicans are saying, oh, this will keep the whole Mueller probe going more now.
[01:30.400 --> 01:37.480]  So we're, we're covering it all at infowars.com. But if you go to drugsreport.com, you can
[01:37.480 --> 01:46.880]  see all the headlines right there and it really breaks down the situation we're in as a culture,
[01:46.880 --> 01:55.560]  as a country, as a world. This is really a extremely profound time to be alive. And
[01:55.560 --> 02:00.400]  folks really do need to decide which side they're going to be on in this fight because
[02:00.400 --> 02:04.480]  they are projecting everything they are on to President Trump. They are the globalists.
[02:04.480 --> 02:09.080]  They're the anti-nation state people. They're the anti-prosperity folks. They want centralization
[02:09.080 --> 02:14.080]  of control. They want social, they want social engineering. And if you go to drudge, it's
[02:14.080 --> 02:21.360]  also also up on infowars.com. It lays out really the big picture there because Trump
[02:21.360 --> 02:26.920]  looking forward to second Putin meeting. Media wants war, he says, hell to pay. White
[02:26.920 --> 02:31.040]  House struggles to contain political outcry because there's so many traders in both parties
[02:31.040 --> 02:36.680]  and so many cowards. Damage control and Air Force One, botch summit may protect Mueller
[02:36.680 --> 02:41.520]  probe, but it's not a botch summit. They wanted him to go over there and basically say that
[02:41.520 --> 02:45.560]  Russia is the enemy when clearly it's China. It's almost got control of the nation. So
[02:45.560 --> 02:49.840]  true enemies of this country are using Russia as the distraction for their Benedict Arnold
[02:49.840 --> 02:55.920]  level treason. A court, 500 pieces of evidence against Manafort. What new indictments reveal
[02:55.920 --> 03:00.200]  about spy craft? But remember, none of it's about Russia collusion. It's about offshore
[03:00.200 --> 03:07.640]  bank accounts from 15 years ago. And then the big one, Ivanka versus robots pushes jobs
[03:07.640 --> 03:12.280]  for humans. What have I said? Trump was going to announce that his inauguration speech,
[03:12.280 --> 03:18.120]  I just knew, a pro human future, unlocking the secrets of the universe, releasing the
[03:18.120 --> 03:22.480]  secret technologies that they've developed. And the deep state doesn't want that. They're
[03:22.480 --> 03:30.120]  a covetous, jealous, hateful, breakaway civilization that doesn't want that. So there's Trump working
[03:30.120 --> 03:35.400]  for better deals for humans, working to build a pro human future, building up people's confidence,
[03:35.400 --> 03:41.080]  building up confidence in America and free market in the world, and being a cheerleader
[03:41.080 --> 03:47.120]  for humanity. And that completely and totally scares the globalists. And so they're the
[03:47.120 --> 03:51.280]  outsiders. They're the enemies. They're the multinationalists. And so their biggest Achilles
[03:51.280 --> 03:54.920]  heel is that they are the globalists, that they're tax exempt, that they have diplomatic
[03:54.920 --> 03:59.720]  immunity, all the things we talk about. And Trump's the only one listening to common sense
[03:59.720 --> 04:04.200]  and listening to what I've said. When the media is owned by foreign corporations, it
[04:04.200 --> 04:10.200]  is the enemy. CNN is the enemy of the American people. MSNBC is the enemy. You listen to their
[04:10.200 --> 04:15.240]  privately recorded recordings of Hillary and Obama and the WikiLeaks. It's how much they
[04:15.240 --> 04:18.840]  hate Americans, how they hate Christians, how they hate gun owners, how they hate their
[04:18.840 --> 04:23.480]  own constituents and call them worthless scum and baristas in their mother's basements,
[04:23.480 --> 04:28.600]  that they're going to get everything free and how she sees them as slaves. Trump is
[04:28.600 --> 04:34.360]  really trying to turn the engine of humanity on. And so really, they're bigger than just
[04:34.360 --> 04:38.040]  enemies of the American people. They're enemies of humanity. They're enemies of progress. They're
[04:38.040 --> 04:44.000]  enemies of peace. They're enemies of truth. And Trump and Putin, for two hours, 15 minutes,
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.240]  they genuinely came out. You could see the report. Russia wants to not be under economic
[04:48.240 --> 04:53.040]  warfare. They don't want war. They've cut their defense spending. We'll be back on the other
[04:53.040 --> 05:00.720]  side. I'm Alex Jones on the road. History's happening now. Stay with us, infohorses.com.

[05:58.840 --> 06:04.440]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people and that
[06:04.440 --> 06:10.120]  is really, really an awful situation. We are not the enemy of the American people. We love
[06:10.120 --> 06:25.440]  the American people. We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American
[06:25.440 --> 06:45.560]  people. We love the American people. We love the American people. They came in peace. We
[06:45.560 --> 07:02.440]  are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people. This is CNN.
[07:02.440 --> 07:16.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday. We're broadcasting worldwide. I'm from the road.
[07:16.600 --> 07:22.120]  Owen Shroyer is in the Info Wars News Center in Austin, Texas. We are seeing epic history
[07:22.120 --> 07:27.840]  unfold just days after the enemy of the American people, the enemy of world peace, the enemy
[07:27.840 --> 07:33.320]  of prosperity, the enemy of Christians, the enemy of unborn children, the enemy of prosperity,
[07:33.320 --> 07:39.200]  the globalist Chinese Communist controlled, big mega bank controlled, big college controlled,
[07:39.200 --> 07:45.820]  big Hollywood filth bag controlled. Hore media complex said that Trump was a traitor for
[07:45.820 --> 07:50.560]  meeting privately with which every president does with every other major leader. After
[07:50.560 --> 07:54.920]  lying about what was said and done after covering up Hillary and all their collusion with the
[07:54.920 --> 08:00.720]  Russians, after all of this, he came out. So look, I accept the conclusions. All these
[08:00.720 --> 08:04.640]  countries meddle in each other's elections, but Russia is barely on the Richter scale.
[08:04.640 --> 08:09.720]  A lot of people meddle. Hell, the US spends billions a year trying to mess with Russia.
[08:09.720 --> 08:14.880]  We want prosperity. We want economic development. Russia is cutting their defense spending.
[08:14.880 --> 08:19.680]  Let's not start a new Cold War with them. China is the big threat. They're the big enemy.
[08:19.680 --> 08:23.360]  They come out. They ignore all that and they say, oh my God, he's been at a garner. He's
[08:23.360 --> 08:29.800]  a traitor. Kill him, remove him. Just just unbelievable. It's all over the news. All
[08:29.800 --> 08:35.280]  these former Obama and Hillary people, former CIA directors, deputy FBI directors, military
[08:35.280 --> 08:40.280]  removing Congress from Cohen says military coup. They're the enemy folks. They're the
[08:40.280 --> 08:44.600]  enemy of all this progress you already see and everything that the left always claim
[08:44.600 --> 08:51.720]  they wanted peace. Trump calls media real enemy of the people and goes on to say that
[08:51.720 --> 08:56.600]  mainstream media, corporate media like CNN are enemies of world peace and want war. Close
[08:56.600 --> 09:01.040]  quote. While revealing the second meeting with Putin saying that he's going to meet
[09:01.040 --> 09:07.920]  with him again to discuss all of these issues. The summit with Russia was a great success
[09:07.920 --> 09:11.720]  except with the real enemy of the American people, the fake news media. Trump wrote.
[09:11.720 --> 09:15.720]  Now they're going to spend that. He says the press is the enemy and free speech. No, he's
[09:15.720 --> 09:19.600]  attacking back with free speech. They're saying he's a traitor that needs to die. They're
[09:19.600 --> 09:24.840]  saying he needs to be removed by the military. He says you are the enemy, which they are.
[09:24.840 --> 09:28.920]  They are the enemy. They're trying to shut me down. They're trying to shut you down.
[09:28.920 --> 09:33.440]  They're having congressional hearings lying about us, what we've said and done and then
[09:33.440 --> 09:37.080]  having a consensus. We need to be shut down with even the Republican congressman going
[09:37.080 --> 09:42.760]  along with it. They've gotten to Matt Gates. The summit with Russia was a great success
[09:42.760 --> 09:48.040]  except with the real enemy of the people, the fake news media. Trump wrote. I look forward
[09:48.040 --> 09:53.200]  to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed
[09:53.200 --> 09:57.920]  including stopping terrorism, security for Israel, nuclear proliferation, cyber attacks,
[09:57.920 --> 10:03.520]  trade, Ukraine, Middle East peace, North Korea and more. There are many answers, some easy
[10:03.520 --> 10:09.040]  and some hard to these problems, but they can all be solved.
[10:09.040 --> 10:15.440]  Trump likes to fix things. Trump is a pragmatist. He likes prosperity and the summit with Russia
[10:15.440 --> 10:21.880]  was a great success except with the real enemy of the people, the fake news media. Proliferation,
[10:21.880 --> 10:28.080]  cyber attacks, trade, we can solve it all and they are so upset because the globalists
[10:28.080 --> 10:33.520]  of their own white papers and WikiLeaks everywhere else admit they have a continual crisis paradigm
[10:33.520 --> 10:39.560]  of continuing to fund terrorist, to fund civil wars, to fund destabilization. Look at every
[10:39.560 --> 10:46.920]  blue state area, not just in our country or blue city, but socialist, communist, authoritarian,
[10:46.920 --> 10:51.920]  progressive leftist systems worldwide. They're all collapsing. They're all super bad. They're
[10:51.920 --> 10:58.280]  all hopeless because that's a system of feudalism that globalists like and the tyrants have
[10:58.280 --> 11:05.120]  always liked to maintain control. So we're now at the epic moment in history, the hyper-epic
[11:05.120 --> 11:10.200]  moment where I'm telling you folks, it's not hype. When I say they're trying to institute
[11:10.200 --> 11:16.480]  beyond a civil war, but a civil war with their idiot constituents causing an insurrection,
[11:16.480 --> 11:22.320]  causing a destabilization in their own words to create a civil emergency to give cover
[11:22.320 --> 11:28.600]  to the criminals that are clearly some of them in Trump's cabinet. He's surrounded.
[11:28.600 --> 11:33.880]  We've got them in Congress on both parties and the deep state said you will remove Trump.
[11:33.880 --> 11:39.440]  He will stop this populist insurrection because they need America, they need the United States
[11:39.440 --> 11:46.280]  to hold down the rest of the world, to prop up the EU and to prop up globalist operations
[11:46.280 --> 11:50.240]  in Latin America and Africa and everywhere to exploit all these countries and then use
[11:50.240 --> 11:56.040]  them as political weapons with giant refugee mobs pouring in en masse. It's the Democrats
[11:56.040 --> 12:00.040]  saying occupy federal buildings and shut down the borders and pull down any gates. It's
[12:00.040 --> 12:03.640]  the Democrats trying to bankrupt the nation and saying they want to bankrupt the economy
[12:03.640 --> 12:08.620]  to teach America to come to heal and submission. This is all public now. It's not me telling
[12:08.620 --> 12:12.800]  you it 20 years ago. It's the Democrats that are trying to bankrupt the dollar. It's the
[12:12.800 --> 12:16.560]  globalists that are trying to sabotage national sovereignty. They're the ones caught funding
[12:16.560 --> 12:20.360]  ISIS and al-Qaeda. They're the ones that funded the Arab Spring. They're the ones that overthrew
[12:20.360 --> 12:24.120]  Ukraine. They're the ones that have terrorists attacking Russia on its borders. They're the
[12:24.120 --> 12:28.480]  ones trying to start a new Afghan war. They're the ones that are trying to stop trade deals
[12:28.480 --> 12:32.480]  that are more fair and equitable. They're the ones that are trying to keep people poor.
[12:32.480 --> 12:37.960]  They are your enemy. They are my enemy. They are the enemy. They are the enemy. And they're
[12:37.960 --> 12:42.640]  going to stage false flags against themselves once they launch their violent revolution
[12:42.640 --> 12:46.520]  that they're going to call a civil war towards the end of summer, end of the fall. They've
[12:46.520 --> 12:50.400]  all announced it in white papers. They've got the former deputy director of the FBI
[12:50.400 --> 12:55.040]  and CIA, Phil Mudd on TV saying we need a civil emergency. We need to overthrow the
[12:55.040 --> 13:00.240]  president. We need the military to take his ass out. Now I've been proven 1,000 percent
[13:00.240 --> 13:05.080]  correct in royal flush, absolute ace of spades every time because I've studied history. I've
[13:05.080 --> 13:09.040]  studied globalists. I know how they overthrow other countries and I can read their damn
[13:09.040 --> 13:14.320]  statements. I can read their statements. I can read their statements. I can read their
[13:14.320 --> 13:18.840]  actions. I know an enemy wants attacking me. I know an enemy wants attacking my family.
[13:18.840 --> 13:23.160]  I know an enemy foaming at the mouth to abort as many babies as it can. I know an enemy trying
[13:23.160 --> 13:27.440]  to inject us with deadly vaccines filled with pathogens, declassified the brain damages.
[13:27.440 --> 13:31.040]  I know that they spike our troops after they leave the military with a final round of shots
[13:31.040 --> 13:35.440]  to debilitate them, that's declassified. We have a criminal deac state in control and
[13:35.440 --> 13:41.160]  if we ever remove these face suckers, if we ever get oxygen back into our country, which
[13:41.160 --> 13:44.520]  we're starting to see, Trump's only gotten two tentacles off our neck. We've still got
[13:44.520 --> 13:49.720]  three more over our head. It's laying eggs in our guts and we've got to pull the damn
[13:49.720 --> 13:53.800]  thing off and we've got to have an emergency surgery and get the embryos out of our stomach
[13:53.800 --> 13:58.400]  to use an alien analogy. He has not even got the face sucker off yet and it's trying to
[13:58.400 --> 14:04.480]  strangle us. He left us. He fools. He scum. He loves. Look, look, look. Coming up, I'm
[14:04.480 --> 14:11.120]  going to break it down. Come to Chicago, to Portland, to San Francisco. Everyone is canceling
[14:11.120 --> 14:17.480]  their conferences there. Everyone is leaving. There are piles of feces and trash and just
[14:17.480 --> 14:22.240]  people running around. It's like a demon spirit. Men dressed as women with huge beards
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.040]  with feces running down their legs. This is happening in Austin now too and they worship
[14:27.040 --> 14:30.920]  men with beards wearing women's wigs with feces all over them and they just run around
[14:30.920 --> 14:36.160]  going Satan, Satan. I mean, I've seen it myself. It's something weird. You go look at who
[14:36.160 --> 14:42.080]  protested Trump. It's the same spirit and it just sucks everything down. It's a spirit
[14:42.080 --> 14:47.960]  of starving children, rats everywhere, rotting garbage, globalist helicopters flying around,
[14:47.960 --> 14:52.280]  landing on top 50 story buildings. They never even leave the ground level and their spirit
[14:52.280 --> 14:56.600]  is they want to look down from penthouses with their $20 million helicopters and they
[14:56.600 --> 15:01.080]  want to be able to look down with their binoculars and just see starving, dead, dumb people
[15:01.080 --> 15:05.880]  on fluoride stumbling around with snot running out of their nose. That's what Bill Marr thinks
[15:05.880 --> 15:10.360]  of you and your family. He told you he's going to have a depression and you're going to starve
[15:10.360 --> 15:14.760]  in the street and he said he wants more abortion and death. He said, I hate everyone. I want
[15:14.760 --> 15:19.360]  to kill everybody. And even though he tells you that, he sits there all high and mighty
[15:19.360 --> 15:24.000]  trying to destroy this country and destroy this world. But the spirit of liberty is
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.120]  rising and we will defeat these people. If I get angry when I think about who they are
[15:29.120 --> 15:33.160]  and what they stand for, my spirit wants to crush them, doesn't yours? We got to hold
[15:33.160 --> 15:38.440]  our fire and we've got to be political and we've got to expose these bastards. But only
[15:38.440 --> 15:43.480]  President Trump at his level understands that we have enemies running our country that are
[15:43.480 --> 15:48.000]  in full control at a certain level. We have to get back control and these are people that
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.640]  enjoy hurting you and your family. We'll be right back in FullWars.com, NewsWars.com.

[16:36.480 --> 16:40.560]  someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government
[16:40.560 --> 16:45.760]  ever. We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled
[16:45.760 --> 16:49.000]  by a shadow government. We got to get this out because just because you're awake folks
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.760]  doesn't mean other people are. This is critical to get, to read, to give them a library, to

[17:57.720 --> 18:05.680]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. Introducing pollen block.
[18:05.680 --> 18:10.880]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:10.880 --> 18:17.720]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.720 --> 18:23.600]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.600 --> 18:28.960]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[18:28.960 --> 18:35.120]  trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[18:35.120 --> 18:40.680]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is
[18:40.680 --> 18:45.720]  not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking
[18:45.720 --> 18:51.120]  the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses
[18:51.120 --> 18:56.880]  in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to InfoWarsLife.com and
[18:56.880 --> 19:05.160]  grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[20:03.480 --> 20:26.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.160 --> 20:36.600]  While you're now seeing mainstream news, do everything it can to demonize Trump and
[20:36.600 --> 20:45.720]  InfoWars. Where, if you were watching the newsroom on Fox today, you had commentators
[20:45.720 --> 20:53.600]  on Fox say that InfoWars are holocaust deniers. Once again, never playing a clip, no proof,
[20:53.600 --> 20:59.360]  no evidence, just making outlandish claim to try to demonize us. While CNN may want
[20:59.360 --> 21:02.960]  to shut down, Fox might be afraid of us as competition, but regardless, that's what
[21:02.960 --> 21:03.960]  they do.
[21:03.960 --> 21:09.320]  Just like they say Trump-Russia collusion, Russia hacking, and then we've got the video
[21:09.320 --> 21:15.600]  clips, Obama was warned about the Russian hacking in 2014 and 2016, including in congressional
[21:15.600 --> 21:21.120]  hearings. They have testified on this. He stood down. That is a direct quote from his
[21:21.120 --> 21:26.720]  own officials. Stand down on Russian hacking. Now they try to blame President Trump. It
[21:26.720 --> 21:31.480]  shows you how fake they are. And this is why, Alex, they are the enemy of the American
[21:31.480 --> 21:35.520]  people. And I think it's important for Trump to continue to hit them because they're the
[21:35.520 --> 21:42.120]  visual surface enemy of the deep state that we can identify. The shadow government's
[21:42.120 --> 21:46.800]  harder to identify, but the media's easy to point out and say they are the liars. Here
[21:46.800 --> 21:48.800]  are the people dividing this country.
[21:48.800 --> 21:54.760]  That's right. When you see MSNBC or CNN or even ABCNBC, all of them are just as bad
[21:54.760 --> 22:00.920]  now. You are looking at the mouth of the deep state, the mouth of the globalist. And see,
[22:00.920 --> 22:04.040]  I haven't even made the last few segments about info wars, but we're right at the center
[22:04.040 --> 22:09.280]  of this. Yes, Zuckerberg came out yesterday and basically defended info wars as a good
[22:09.280 --> 22:13.920]  cop-bad cop scenario. I'll talk about that in the last segment of the show. But he wasn't
[22:13.920 --> 22:18.000]  really doing that. They're already censoring all libertarians, all conservatives, all
[22:18.000 --> 22:22.560]  nationalists. Everybody's been dolled back 80 to 90% on Facebook, YouTube, and Google
[22:22.560 --> 22:26.120]  and Twitter. They've all agreed about a year and a half ago. And they now admit that. I
[22:26.120 --> 22:30.200]  told people that for years. Now they use that exact number 80%. It's more like 90% now,
[22:30.200 --> 22:35.800]  but they admit 80. It's the same thing. First, they misrepresent what I said about Sandy
[22:35.800 --> 22:40.640]  Hook, where I've had debates on both sides. Then they follow lawsuits to create some type
[22:40.640 --> 22:44.600]  of credibility in the media about that. Then they have congressional hearings and say that
[22:44.600 --> 22:49.760]  I said no one died at Parkland and they were crisis actors, which I never said. I was very
[22:49.760 --> 22:53.320]  careful about that because I think it did happen. They misrepresent that. They take
[22:53.320 --> 22:57.920]  down our YouTube channel. Then they have to reinstate it later when it's admitted I didn't
[22:57.920 --> 23:02.520]  say those things, but in congressional hearings, the head of YouTube goes along with, oh, yes,
[23:02.520 --> 23:06.760]  I had my videos taken down. Oh, yes, I did that. Then they have two different congressmen
[23:06.760 --> 23:14.360]  in the meeting say, well, that's like Holocaust denial. And then two days later, it is Holocaust
[23:14.360 --> 23:19.680]  denial. See how that extrapolates? So they lie and say that I said nobody died at Parkland
[23:19.680 --> 23:26.040]  and they were crisis actors. Then they lie and say, and connected to the Holocaust denial.
[23:26.040 --> 23:30.280]  And then now they just continue to move forward. And exactly, I told everybody this four months
[23:30.280 --> 23:35.880]  ago, the Wall Street Journal had a huge subscription article by the ended up subscribing to read
[23:35.880 --> 23:40.800]  it like 35 pages long. And other people picked up derivatives of it and said, hold on to your
[23:40.800 --> 23:49.600]  ten full hat. Alex Jones, YouTube is going to ban you. And it was the head, the new head
[23:49.600 --> 23:56.240]  of news corps saying, we are going to move. We met with the big corporate heads of Time
[23:56.240 --> 23:59.520]  Warner and others. We're going to work together. We're going to work with Facebook, Twitter
[23:59.520 --> 24:03.840]  and YouTube. We're going to ban Alex Jones and WikiLeaks. Once we set the precedent to
[24:03.840 --> 24:09.440]  de-platform them, we're going to de-platform everyone. I began ringing the alarm bell.
[24:09.440 --> 24:14.440]  One month later, they launched the attempted takedown with CNN cheerleading of us on CNN.
[24:14.440 --> 24:20.600]  This is history. Zuckerberg is now talking about in full wars. In major statements, they're
[24:20.600 --> 24:25.240]  having congressional hearings in the Judiciary Committee. They are misrepresenting us everywhere.
[24:25.240 --> 24:29.640]  As Owen said, I got calls from the media this morning saying, do you want to respond that
[24:29.640 --> 24:33.480]  you're a Holocaust denier? And I called back two of the media people and I said, I'm not
[24:33.480 --> 24:37.880]  going to respond to you anymore. Find a damn clip of me saying it or shut up because I'm
[24:37.880 --> 24:42.040]  going to start having to sue some people only because you guys are the ones that are defaming.
[24:42.040 --> 24:44.480]  You're the ones that are out of control. You're a bunch of known frauds.
[24:44.480 --> 24:49.840]  But what they do is they get together as a group like locusts and they all just start
[24:49.840 --> 24:53.640]  lying and lying and lying and lying. And why are they doing it? Because I'm exposing
[24:53.640 --> 24:59.360]  that Chinese communists own our national debt. They own the most of it. They own Hollywood,
[24:59.360 --> 25:04.960]  a controlling interest in all six major studios. They were trying to buy three other sub studios.
[25:04.960 --> 25:11.520]  When Trump got in, he killed it. The communist Chinese own the media. Now, that's what we've
[25:11.520 --> 25:15.920]  gotten into. They bought up the universities. They're in control. Basically, they have the
[25:15.920 --> 25:20.440]  Office of Personnel Management Act. The media is their mouthpiece. They are the enemy with
[25:20.440 --> 25:26.040]  this constellation of the corrupt unelected EU, the chai comms, Hollywood, the big banks,
[25:26.040 --> 25:32.320]  radical Islam, allied with the devil pope. That's the constellation. That's the army
[25:32.320 --> 25:37.560]  of Mordor. That's all the groups and all the people openly saying, take America's guns.
[25:37.560 --> 25:41.880]  Open Europe's borders. Open America's borders. You must get rid of your borders. You must
[25:41.880 --> 25:46.720]  bring 200 million people in from the Middle East to North Africa. That's Macron. This
[25:46.720 --> 25:52.120]  is their move. They're making their move. It's happening now. It's going on. This is
[25:52.120 --> 25:57.600]  the globalist takeover. This is World War 4. The Cold War was World War 3. Putin is
[25:57.600 --> 26:01.600]  a nationalist. They are under attack by the very same globalist combine, the very same
[26:01.600 --> 26:06.280]  evil combination. We are under the same attack. That's the only reason they keep bringing
[26:06.280 --> 26:10.160]  up Russia is because they're attacking them as well, and they're the globalists. So again,
[26:10.160 --> 26:13.800]  they have to point at a foreign enemy to make it look like they're Americans. They are the
[26:13.800 --> 26:18.400]  enemy of the American people. They hate the American people. It's in their public statements.
[26:18.400 --> 26:23.160]  It's in the vile hatred of anything Hollywood puts out. It's in all the crap they do. These
[26:23.160 --> 26:27.800]  people are coming for you. They think you're stupid. They think you're done. A lot of people
[26:27.800 --> 26:31.160]  say, how are you taking it being demonized everywhere? How are you taking it being censored?
[26:31.160 --> 26:35.240]  How are you taking it being sued? I thank God for putting me on the front line. I prayed
[26:35.240 --> 26:39.360]  for this on air. Everybody's seen me do it. I prayed at 3 a.m. at night that I could
[26:39.360 --> 26:43.240]  be used as a vessel to take on these people, and God would give me the strength. God said,
[26:43.240 --> 26:46.880]  I'll do it, but you've got to be ready for what's going to happen to you. I said, amen.
[26:46.880 --> 26:51.200]  Whatever has to happen, I love my family. I love my children. I love life. I'm not looking
[26:51.200 --> 26:54.800]  for this. I don't want to get hurt, but you know what? We're all going to get real hurt
[26:54.800 --> 26:58.560]  if we don't do something to stand up to these people. History's happening right now.
[26:58.560 --> 27:02.640]  A lot of wars, it's not clear who the good guys and bad guys are. Usually, there's beefs
[27:02.640 --> 27:07.440]  on both sides. This is the clearest war anybody could ever ask for. It's not a war we ask
[27:07.440 --> 27:12.440]  for, but it's one. If we got to have one, this is it, because it's so clear and dry.
[27:12.440 --> 27:18.800]  It's 100% who's good. It's 100% who's bad. It's 100% who's for death and war. It's 100%
[27:18.800 --> 27:23.240]  who's for life and peace. It's 100% who's for prosperity and our unborn children. It's
[27:23.240 --> 27:29.440]  100% who's for Satan and evil and death and disease and failure and collapse and ruin
[27:29.440 --> 27:34.360]  for this planet. I'm telling you, God's testing the world right now with Trump, and with all
[27:34.360 --> 27:38.880]  of us, and with all these other people, these nationalists, and the worldwide movement of
[27:38.880 --> 27:43.440]  Christians from Latin America to Eastern Europe to Asia, trying to fight the globalist
[27:43.440 --> 27:49.000]  takedown, because every culture's being targeted by the media. Every culture's got the same
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.200]  psychological warfare systems attacking them, and this is a spiritual war. Owen, we're going
[27:54.200 --> 27:58.040]  to come back and get into the blue state, collapse, how it fits into the whole global
[27:58.040 --> 28:02.760]  paradigm, their master program, and how to defeat it. But history is now, and listeners,
[28:02.760 --> 28:05.680]  you need to financially support us, because that's the number one way you can stop them
[28:05.680 --> 28:10.240]  from shutting us down is spread the links and articles, and take advantage at infowarstore.com.
[28:10.240 --> 28:14.040]  We're in a war. We need resupply. We've got products you need, and if everybody doesn't
[28:14.040 --> 28:18.440]  start really getting down and putting them on the line, I'm telling you, the globalists
[28:18.440 --> 28:24.560]  have a chance of winning, but I know people are going to come through infowarstore.com.
[28:24.560 --> 28:29.320]  And it's amazing to see what they do, and you can see it. We just illustrated it as
[28:29.320 --> 28:35.200]  Alex was talking about it. They put out in all of the Mockingbird Press, Washington Post,
[28:35.200 --> 28:40.880]  New York Times, CNN, everywhere, Facebook says info wars and holocaust deniers should exist.
[28:40.880 --> 28:45.360]  So they pretend to separate us while putting us in that conversation, and then what's the
[28:45.360 --> 28:52.000]  next step? Info wars are holocaust deniers. That's the propaganda. That's how they do
[28:52.000 --> 28:59.480]  this. This is historical. This is what the Nazis did. We know what we're talking about.

[32:43.920 --> 32:48.200]  have the power, but we have to realize these scum are coming after us, and we have to
[32:48.200 --> 32:53.960]  speak out and and take action now.infowars is on the frontline and so are you. We are
[32:53.960 --> 33:03.480]  resistance.
[33:03.480 --> 33:14.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:14.120 --> 33:22.000]  The year is 1995 and Info Wars launches the last of America's counter globalist probes
[33:22.000 --> 33:28.360]  in a freak mishap Info Wars dot com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into
[33:28.360 --> 33:36.880]  an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to earth 25 years later.
[33:36.880 --> 33:42.680]  Transdimensionally over the space time continuum where people are extremely lazy.
[33:42.680 --> 33:44.920]  The social engineers are there laughing.
[33:44.920 --> 33:49.000]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now real.
[33:49.000 --> 33:54.160]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men
[33:54.160 --> 33:57.880]  and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women and they don't understand
[33:57.880 --> 34:02.880]  that it's an animating contest of life and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[34:02.880 --> 34:04.880]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[34:04.880 --> 34:10.120]  It's fulfilling Info Wars, tomorrow's news today.
[34:10.120 --> 34:16.840]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[34:16.840 --> 34:24.360]  the Info War.
[34:24.360 --> 34:25.360]  And we are back.
[34:25.360 --> 34:27.680]  It is an information war.
[34:27.680 --> 34:28.680]  I'm on the phone.
[34:28.680 --> 34:31.480]  Owen Shroyer is in studio riding shotgun with me.
[34:31.480 --> 34:35.320]  He'll be taking over at the end of the hour completely and has a bunch of guests and critical
[34:35.320 --> 34:36.320]  information for you.
[34:36.320 --> 34:41.600]  Now, I'm going to lay something out here that I've laid out pieces of over the years.
[34:41.600 --> 34:47.440]  Not that I'm going to completely basically break down now and I'm a big student of history
[34:47.440 --> 34:52.000]  so I already knew this and I've seen pieces of it in textbooks and in history books.
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.640]  But if you get deeper into the history and the declassifications that happened in Russia
[34:55.640 --> 35:02.360]  and things in the last 20 years, understand it, but when Joseph McCarthy and his head
[35:02.360 --> 35:09.560]  lawyer Roy Cohn, who was then the president's mentor and lawyer for 25 years, got into the
[35:09.560 --> 35:14.280]  classified documents, they discovered the Carnegie Endowment, the Ford Endowment, and
[35:14.280 --> 35:22.080]  the Rockefeller Endowment were funding communism along with the British government and others
[35:22.080 --> 35:29.600]  and that they had actually created communism previous to that in the 1870s and had commissioned
[35:29.600 --> 35:33.160]  it as a way to get the serfs who were being freed all over Europe while Russia, these
[35:33.160 --> 35:38.000]  were white slaves, they lived off the land, they're basically sharecroppers, they even
[35:38.000 --> 35:44.160]  had military, the famous Hessian troops out of Prussia, so brainwashed, they were proud
[35:44.160 --> 35:46.280]  to be slaves, but they were war slaves.
[35:46.280 --> 35:50.680]  They were actually bred and trained for war, so they had all these different slave colonies
[35:50.680 --> 35:58.400]  all over Europe and all over Russia and the serfs were being freed, so they came in with
[35:58.400 --> 36:05.040]  communism to basically trick serfs back into a communal system and back into, oh, you'll
[36:05.040 --> 36:06.720]  own this, you'll own that, it'll be communal.
[36:06.720 --> 36:11.120]  And of course we know it was a total setup, that's what communist China is, all this is
[36:11.120 --> 36:15.920]  communist systems who aren't really communists with a bunch of rich people over at ruling
[36:15.920 --> 36:18.800]  it, exploiting the labor of the poor people.
[36:18.800 --> 36:21.400]  Now why do I say that?
[36:21.400 --> 36:24.200]  General Benton K. Parton was the former head of Air Force Weapons Development, head of
[36:24.200 --> 36:28.880]  HARP, so many other programs and he exposed Oklahoma City as being an inside job and a
[36:28.880 --> 36:33.200]  lot more, but he would come on my show along with the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs
[36:33.200 --> 36:40.080]  of Staff, Admiral Moore, before he died and when he didn't care if they killed him.
[36:40.080 --> 36:46.760]  And they would break down the master plan, but there were groups in our government that
[36:46.760 --> 36:50.920]  knew it was real and knew it was true and that they were trying to stop it.
[36:50.920 --> 36:56.320]  Now I'm not going to get the whole treatise on how communism works, but again, the communism
[36:56.320 --> 37:01.720]  you see in the public is just the outer shell, it's run by the ultra rich who want monopolies,
[37:01.720 --> 37:10.240]  they want combats and what they do in communism is they take over a country or city or a company,
[37:10.240 --> 37:17.800]  they exploit it, they max out the debt, they bring in a bunch of people that are dependent,
[37:17.800 --> 37:24.680]  they create their own taxing authorities, they then loot that, they then collapse it
[37:24.680 --> 37:29.960]  and then organize the people in that city, in that state, in that nation, in the exploitative
[37:29.960 --> 37:35.840]  phase, they go into the exploitative phase, they now use it as a domino to attack the
[37:35.840 --> 37:41.840]  next country, it's called the communist world takeover program, it's a program, it's like
[37:41.840 --> 37:47.120]  you go see a play, it has its acts, it has its rollout, people should look up the communist
[37:47.120 --> 37:52.000]  international program, this is their plan, they admit it's their plan and once they get
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.120]  control of your country, they loot it, they suck everything out, they move it to the next
[37:57.120 --> 38:00.720]  country where they're going to set themselves up and then they exploit and bring that one
[38:00.720 --> 38:04.280]  down and sometimes they can bring down countries and exploit them within a year, usually takes
[38:04.280 --> 38:09.320]  10 years to really get in, suck them dry, like Venezuela or North Korea or any place
[38:09.320 --> 38:16.440]  you've seen, so they're in their exploitative phase and so it's like a domino and it falls
[38:16.440 --> 38:20.160]  and then it falls into the next country, after they've exploited it, they then leverage
[38:20.160 --> 38:25.120]  it to attack the next country, so you wonder why is everybody fleeing California, why are
[38:25.120 --> 38:29.000]  they fleeing Oregon, why are they all fleeing Chicago, why are they fleeing Maryland, why
[38:29.000 --> 38:34.200]  are they fleeing New York, why are they fleeing all the, even in places like Florida or Texas,
[38:34.200 --> 38:37.960]  they will flee a leftist area like Austin and then move somewhere else but set the same
[38:37.960 --> 38:44.040]  thing up because it's the same program of just like locusts, they come eat your fields
[38:44.040 --> 38:51.720]  and move on, but this is directed and so Austin is in a phase of being ratcheted up, pumped
[38:51.720 --> 38:56.200]  up, get the investment in, pump and dump, bring it down, collapse it, move on to the
[38:56.200 --> 39:02.240]  next area, so that's why they celebrate really deranged psychopathic, homeless people,
[39:02.240 --> 39:08.240]  crafting everywhere, it's why they celebrate garbage everywhere because it gets more sophisticated
[39:08.240 --> 39:12.920]  now because they're going to send everybody an exploitive phase towards the Midwest, how
[39:12.920 --> 39:16.400]  I would illegal aliens who are not even bad people but who they are openly propagandizing
[39:16.400 --> 39:19.840]  and using, who are already in the Midwest, they are going to exploit that and bring
[39:19.840 --> 39:26.520]  down the Midwest and then when everybody leaves places like Chicago and San Francisco and
[39:26.520 --> 39:30.480]  other areas, they're going to buy it up for pennies on the dollar once those real estate
[39:30.480 --> 39:37.400]  bubbles finally pop, so this is all very well and very, very skillfully engineered and so
[39:37.400 --> 39:41.960]  just as they do it with nations, they do it with counties, with cities, with states and
[39:41.960 --> 39:47.680]  then that's what's happening, so when you look at the police chief of places like Portland,
[39:47.680 --> 39:51.920]  who seems like a nice person, saying I've never seen so much feces, there's piles of
[39:51.920 --> 39:55.560]  it, no one's even picking it up, there's just mental illness everywhere, people trying
[39:55.560 --> 40:00.640]  to kill cops, anti for running around, what have we become, we need to stop this, why
[40:00.640 --> 40:04.320]  are you doing this, we used to be a great city, San Francisco, same way, all their big
[40:04.320 --> 40:08.360]  medical stuff's getting canceled, all their, it's all over the news, all these big conferences
[40:08.360 --> 40:13.160]  every week, people won't go to them anymore because there's just mentally ill schizophrenic
[40:13.160 --> 40:18.880]  meth heads everywhere, running around screaming Hail Satan and the very same people then literally
[40:18.880 --> 40:23.360]  go down and do story time at the local public schools dressed up like women, go about homeless
[40:23.360 --> 40:27.600]  men with lice all over them, crafting on themselves, go and then do story time for your children
[40:27.600 --> 40:31.600]  and you go that sounds insane but it's true, what, it's the most evil thing they can do,
[40:31.600 --> 40:36.240]  the most bizarre thing, they can make you worship a homeless man in a leather skirt with feces
[40:36.240 --> 40:42.960]  running down his legs, wearing a purple wig saying I'm a transgender to your children,
[40:42.960 --> 40:49.880]  you will put up with anything, just like they have Nambla now, openly pushing child sex education
[40:49.880 --> 40:54.200]  and saying it's normal, you've got all these sex education people and all these exploited
[40:54.200 --> 40:58.360]  children experts being caught having sex with children and trying to rape two-year-old babies,
[40:58.360 --> 41:06.960]  it's in the news every day, this is a cult of pure 1000% evil because Tabistock Institute,
[41:06.960 --> 41:12.760]  the CIA that left us arms of it, it was declassified 20 years ago, you can just type in CIA funded
[41:12.760 --> 41:17.160]  ugly art, ugly buildings, ugly housing, ugly culture, you say why would they do that?
[41:17.160 --> 41:23.920]  Why is the weapon system a schizophrenic method with lice all over them, defecating everywhere?
[41:23.920 --> 41:27.920]  Because if they can do that, they can run everybody out of the area and take full control
[41:27.920 --> 41:34.120]  and then pose as the saviors and get more funding for sex changes and more funding for
[41:34.120 --> 41:39.120]  psych wards and more funding for their medical systems they set up, they're actually giant
[41:39.120 --> 41:43.520]  weaponized systems meant to break down the family, the culture and the society, so they
[41:43.520 --> 41:48.080]  create the crisis to offer the solution and that's only one facet, but notice they say
[41:48.080 --> 41:52.280]  come here, come here, break down the borders, Latin America's collapsing, same globalists
[41:52.280 --> 41:56.280]  did that, Venezuela's had 4 million people just the last year fleeing north, many of
[41:56.280 --> 41:59.560]  them are getting here and they're saying it's all free, come to El Norte, it's all free
[41:59.560 --> 42:02.840]  and then once you get here, you're going to be communist and you're going to help overthrow
[42:02.840 --> 42:08.960]  America and you're going to follow Congresswoman Cortez who says occupy and overthrow the government,
[42:08.960 --> 42:14.280]  this is the plan, this is the program and Trump and others and myself, we're just saying
[42:14.280 --> 42:17.960]  we're not going to be part of this, we're not going to do this, we're not going to sit
[42:17.960 --> 42:23.800]  there and let this continue and let them put all of this right in our face on national
[42:23.800 --> 42:29.600]  news showing two-year-old children putting $10 bills in the G-strings of fat obese men
[42:29.600 --> 42:35.160]  wearing purple wigs shaking their butts in children's faces and you say why is this all
[42:35.160 --> 42:40.240]  over the news because this is the weaponization, if you can have two-year-olds putting $10
[42:40.240 --> 42:46.520]  bills in G-strings of fat men wearing purple wigs, you can do anything, they are psychologically
[42:46.520 --> 42:51.200]  attacking us and the poor mentally ill people they used to do all this, they're not even
[42:51.200 --> 42:54.520]  the enemy, they are people that have been spiritually taken over, we'll be right back

[47:27.520 --> 47:35.120]  When Mark Zuckerberg makes a statement, it's usually one of the top news stories in the
[47:35.120 --> 47:44.640]  world, and he came out yesterday and made statements about Alex Jones, you're truly
[47:44.640 --> 47:45.640]  an InfoWars.
[47:45.640 --> 47:51.640]  And then the media dutifully took what he said and twisted it.
[47:51.640 --> 47:56.680]  And then today, Fox News is seeing in her saying, Mark Zuckerberg defends Alex Jones'
[47:56.680 --> 48:04.640]  holocaust and all statements, a perfect example of fake news, a perfect example of the hearings
[48:04.640 --> 48:10.680]  they had two days ago for seven hours, most of the hearings about me saying that I said
[48:10.680 --> 48:11.680]  no one died at Parkland.
[48:11.680 --> 48:17.080]  Now, even if I said no one died at Parkland, which I didn't say, I would have a right to
[48:17.080 --> 48:18.080]  say that, wouldn't I?
[48:18.080 --> 48:25.080]  If somebody could sue me, and then if it's true, they could win a judgment, but if it's
[48:25.080 --> 48:30.520]  not, I have anti-slapback and I have to sue them, which unfortunately to maintain my rights,
[48:30.520 --> 48:31.520]  I have to sue them.
[48:31.520 --> 48:35.520]  The media is going to spend that, that Alex Jones is suing Sandy Hook survivors.
[48:35.520 --> 48:42.320]  But notice they haven't even covered that I've already filed the anti-slapback provisions.
[48:42.320 --> 48:46.680]  It's just amazing, but yes, I'm having to sue people because they keep saying stuff
[48:46.680 --> 48:53.280]  I didn't say, but, and I'm at the sue other folks as well, and I put people on notice
[48:53.280 --> 48:57.160]  that these big banks and these big media companies, they don't care if they lose a judgment against
[48:57.160 --> 49:00.640]  me, they're going to keep doing it because they're in a war, just like they say, President
[49:00.640 --> 49:04.400]  Trump hates all Mexicans and says they're all criminals and rapists, ever say any such
[49:04.400 --> 49:05.400]  thing.
[49:05.400 --> 49:07.800]  He said, you've got a lot of criminals coming across, some of them are murderers, some of
[49:07.800 --> 49:13.840]  them rapists, some of them criminals, so this is how they deceive, and I got a lot of calls
[49:13.840 --> 49:19.560]  yesterday and I talked to a few of the media and I said I did not say that and of course
[49:19.560 --> 49:22.200]  none of them ran with it.
[49:22.200 --> 49:27.160]  So I have been completely silenced, except for my radio show and TV show, in FullWars.com.
[49:27.160 --> 49:32.200]  I have no way to respond to their constant, intensifying lies, and again, why are they
[49:32.200 --> 49:33.200]  doing it?
[49:33.200 --> 49:34.200]  That's the answer to everything.
[49:34.200 --> 49:35.200]  Forget Alex Jones.
[49:35.200 --> 49:40.320]  By understanding, this has meant to shut your speech down, but what is it, I'm saying
[49:40.320 --> 49:41.320]  it scares them.
[49:41.320 --> 49:45.400]  The globalists have taken control of the media, the globalists want you poor, the globalists
[49:45.400 --> 49:49.880]  are controlled and mainly financed by Communist China that openly owns most of Hollywood,
[49:49.880 --> 49:53.640]  a lot of the media, the big universities are under their control, congressional hearings
[49:53.640 --> 49:58.080]  on that, opposite personnel management hack was for them to compromise the whole country.
[49:58.080 --> 50:03.080]  We've been sold out and it's incredible, and I'm here saying that mainstream media is the
[50:03.080 --> 50:06.280]  enemy of the American people, they're globalists.
[50:06.280 --> 50:11.000]  They change the subject with Putin because that distracts us away from the real enemy,
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  the chikoms.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.960]  So, I told some of my own people last night when I said, why do you think Zuckerberg's
[50:15.960 --> 50:18.760]  defending your free speech in this lunch mob coming against you?
[50:18.760 --> 50:20.760]  I said, he's not.
[50:20.760 --> 50:23.200]  It's a false dichotomy, good cop, bad cop.
[50:23.200 --> 50:27.120]  He's coming out saying, oh, people even deny the Holocaust, I don't agree with it, but
[50:27.120 --> 50:31.240]  they have a right to do it, which is the first amendment, so you can give him that.
[50:31.240 --> 50:36.640]  But then it gives him already ratcheting back 89% of all conservative content just out of
[50:36.640 --> 50:41.920]  the gates, governed back, choked back to nothing, this cover like that's free speech, oh, we're
[50:41.920 --> 50:47.280]  just smothering you, we let you have one gasp of air a minute, it's going to give you a
[50:47.280 --> 50:52.600]  heart attack, but it's okay, we're slowly killing you, but at least we don't totally
[50:52.600 --> 50:53.600]  ban you.
[50:53.600 --> 50:58.360]  No, we'll have standing if they totally ban us, and then we'll have to go build our
[50:58.360 --> 51:01.160]  own platforms, which we should have done years ago, like Matt Rudd said.
[51:01.160 --> 51:02.800]  I did build my platforms.
[51:02.800 --> 51:06.640]  That's another reason they're after us is because they can't stand that they've silenced
[51:06.640 --> 51:12.440]  everybody else but President Trump and me, and Drudge and a few others, and that's why
[51:12.440 --> 51:16.960]  in the hearings, they were lying about Breitbart, and saying Breitbart had done things Breitbart
[51:16.960 --> 51:18.460]  never did.
[51:18.460 --> 51:22.960]  That's why you see all this stuff going on, because they don't like anybody having a voice
[51:22.960 --> 51:28.360]  that's just a common sense capitalist pro-America person, because comparing that to San Francisco
[51:28.360 --> 51:37.960]  lunacy and Dian Feinstein and Maxine Waters and all these loon bags, but think about it.
[51:37.960 --> 51:41.860]  Nowhere in the news, thousands of articles about Zuckerberg statements cover the New
[51:41.860 --> 51:45.480]  York Times, you know, Politico, everywhere with their false headlines.
[51:45.480 --> 51:46.480]  Where's Alex Jones?
[51:46.480 --> 51:51.120]  Where am I in the hearing to face my accusers for seven hours that lied about me?
[51:51.120 --> 51:54.840]  Well, they couldn't have me there, because I'd have said those strikes on my YouTube
[51:54.840 --> 51:55.840]  were taken back.
[51:55.840 --> 51:59.160]  They admitted that I did not say nobody died there, but I would have had a right to say
[51:59.160 --> 52:01.360]  that, even if I was crazy.
[52:01.360 --> 52:02.360]  But I didn't.
[52:02.360 --> 52:06.440]  They couldn't have me there, because I would have destroyed them in 10 seconds.
[52:06.440 --> 52:10.600]  I'd have said, Mr. Chairman, please ask the head of YouTube right here if my strikes were
[52:10.600 --> 52:11.600]  taken off.
[52:11.600 --> 52:15.120]  Because she knows full well there were, because she gave a statement to Bloomberg saying we
[52:15.120 --> 52:19.160]  had a mutiny inside the company of the Southern Primary Law Center people we hired.
[52:19.160 --> 52:23.120]  They took down thousands of sites, including Alex Jones, and he didn't do what they said.
[52:23.120 --> 52:25.920]  That woman is quoted in newspapers.
[52:25.920 --> 52:30.920]  She knew full well when she sat there and lied to them and said, oh, we did take down
[52:30.920 --> 52:34.000]  Alex Jones for saying that.
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.500]  So she went along with it.
[52:35.500 --> 52:37.000]  I don't want to be that lady's enemy.
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.280]  I don't want to be Zuckerberg's enemy, but I'm not going to sit here and be played by
[52:40.280 --> 52:41.280]  these people.
[52:41.280 --> 52:42.280]  I'm not stupid.
[52:42.280 --> 52:46.240]  Oh, how nice of Zuckerberg, his backhanded attack.
[52:46.240 --> 52:50.760]  Zuckerberg defends, allowing him full wars, holocausts, and irons on Facebook.
[52:50.760 --> 52:53.840]  The average idiot reads that, and what do they get?
[52:53.840 --> 52:57.600]  Then the media translates it to, I'm a holocaust denier by today.
[52:57.600 --> 52:58.920]  That's how they're coming after Trump.
[52:58.920 --> 52:59.920]  It's how they're coming after me.
[52:59.920 --> 53:01.400]  It's how they're going to come after you.
[53:01.400 --> 53:06.000]  So I'm honored to be in this position of standing with America against this.
[53:06.000 --> 53:09.320]  Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, defended the social media platform decision, not to
[53:09.320 --> 53:15.400]  kick off conspiracy theory peddling, websites like Far Right Info Wars, saying in an interview,
[53:15.400 --> 53:20.480]  release Wednesday that doing so would violate Facebook's commitment to being an open platform.
[53:20.480 --> 53:23.760]  So he's hanging this on, oh, we don't have prior restraint, because he knows that under
[53:23.760 --> 53:27.240]  law he's getting in trouble, but they already have prior restraint.
[53:27.240 --> 53:31.400]  They already moderated, they already governed it, they already cut it back.
[53:31.400 --> 53:35.880]  The company has faced mounting criticism over the past week for allowing Alex Jones, let's
[53:35.880 --> 53:38.040]  cite, a known prover of his information.
[53:38.040 --> 53:39.520]  These people just say that.
[53:39.520 --> 53:40.520]  That's defamation.
[53:40.520 --> 53:44.200]  About issues like Sandy Hook Massacre and Pizzagate to remain on the platform.
[53:44.200 --> 53:49.200]  No, the media hyped questions about Sandy Hook and about Pizzagate to divert off of
[53:49.200 --> 53:50.200]  other issues.
[53:50.200 --> 53:53.680]  Then when we debated what they were saying, they then said that we were the presenters
[53:53.680 --> 53:54.680]  of it.
[53:54.680 --> 53:58.000]  They're the ones constantly saying, I said nobody died at Sandy Hook or Parkland.
[53:58.000 --> 54:02.040]  See how they worked for years, I've said, look, I looked at both sides, but they're
[54:02.040 --> 54:03.040]  taking out of context.
[54:03.040 --> 54:04.040]  I think people died there.
[54:04.040 --> 54:05.040]  I apologize.
[54:05.040 --> 54:06.040]  It was taken out of context with families.
[54:06.040 --> 54:09.920]  Then I get to see the families, everybody on TV every week going, Jones attacked us
[54:09.920 --> 54:13.240]  again today and he won't stop and we're really tired of it.
[54:13.240 --> 54:14.840]  Please, Alex, stop attacking us.
[54:14.840 --> 54:20.080]  And it's the mainstream media bringing it up over and over and over and over again.
[54:20.080 --> 54:23.560]  The company has faced mounting criticism and then it goes on from there.
[54:23.560 --> 54:28.880]  Democrats grilled Facebook officials over the choice of House Yashiri committee hearing
[54:28.880 --> 54:29.880]  on Tuesday.
[54:29.880 --> 54:31.720]  And then it goes on.
[54:31.720 --> 54:34.640]  Zuckerberg responded to criticism during an interview with Recode.
[54:34.640 --> 54:40.000]  Look, as abhorrent as some of the content can be, I do think that it gets down to the
[54:40.000 --> 54:41.520]  principle of giving people a voice.
[54:41.520 --> 54:46.680]  The Facebook CEO said, Zuckerberg said that instead of banning websites out, right?
[54:46.680 --> 54:50.040]  The company removes individual posts that violate Facebook's terms of service.
[54:50.040 --> 54:56.240]  Post promoting violence are particularly likely to be taken down yet, which we're not doing.
[54:56.240 --> 55:00.080]  Zuckerberg, who was Jewish, said that even Holocaust Senators have a place on the platform
[55:00.080 --> 55:03.160]  as long as they genuinely believe the content they share.
[55:03.160 --> 55:06.600]  I find it deeply offensive, he said, but at the end of the day, I don't believe that
[55:06.600 --> 55:11.680]  our platform should be taken down because I think there are different things and different
[55:11.680 --> 55:12.680]  people get wrong.
[55:12.680 --> 55:15.080]  I don't think they're intentionally getting it wrong.
[55:15.080 --> 55:21.960]  So then they get to basically act like I'm saying that when I'm not, and then put out
[55:21.960 --> 55:26.360]  this disinfo to make it look like the other side calling for total censorship is right
[55:26.360 --> 55:28.160]  because we're all a bunch of Holocaust Senators.
[55:28.160 --> 55:29.720]  And that's how it started in Germany.
[55:29.720 --> 55:35.240]  It's the same formula, ban Holocaust denial, then ban being in a nationalist party, then
[55:35.240 --> 55:40.560]  ban reporting on Muslim crime, then ban mothers and fathers saying their mothers and fathers
[55:40.560 --> 55:44.280]  on school entry forms because the word mother or father is hateful.
[55:44.280 --> 55:46.400]  This is already happening.
[55:46.400 --> 55:50.560]  This is the plan where if anybody finds something offensive, it's banned and we're being walked
[55:50.560 --> 55:53.360]  into this false dichotomy, into this false debate.
[55:53.360 --> 55:58.640]  Now, finally, I need to say this because I never, never plug like I should.
[55:58.640 --> 56:06.400]  We are winning, but barely and they are really trying to block us and if listeners want to
[56:06.400 --> 56:11.520]  help us defeat these globalists, it is so critical that they go to info or store.com.
[56:11.520 --> 56:15.680]  Look at the history of the tap them, the congressional hearings, Zuckerberg, the globalist.
[56:15.680 --> 56:18.920]  We are seen as Trump's booster.
[56:18.920 --> 56:21.960]  We're seen as Trump's guard dog.
[56:21.960 --> 56:28.560]  We're seen as the engine of the, the reassurgents of America because we are, you, the audience,
[56:28.560 --> 56:33.360]  the symbiotically, the economy we've created, the interface we've created, the system we've
[56:33.360 --> 56:38.240]  created of rebooting America is so sexy and so real and so amazing, they have to close
[56:38.240 --> 56:39.240]  our restaurant.
[56:39.240 --> 56:40.640]  So we're a restaurant.
[56:40.640 --> 56:41.840]  Our food's so good.
[56:41.840 --> 56:48.600]  What we're promoting is so honest and so decent and so real, they can't have it operated
[56:48.600 --> 56:50.080]  because it shows what a fraud they are.
[56:50.080 --> 56:51.400]  They have to have us shut down.
[56:51.400 --> 56:55.440]  That's why when you buy the products, you get great products, you get great prices.
[56:55.440 --> 56:56.440]  Everybody needs air filtration.
[56:56.440 --> 56:57.840]  We've got the best lowest price.
[56:57.840 --> 56:58.840]  Everybody needs water filtration.
[56:58.840 --> 57:00.480]  We've got the best, great price.
[57:00.480 --> 57:03.240]  We've got incredible non-GMO heirloom seeds, wide selection.
[57:03.240 --> 57:07.280]  We've got shortwave radios, tactical gear, great Patriot apparel, amazing supplements.
[57:07.280 --> 57:10.480]  Get in there every day and check out the products.
[57:10.480 --> 57:11.880]  Take advantage of store-wide free shipping.
[57:11.880 --> 57:16.200]  I brought back the biggest super sale, the anti-globalist pro-free speech, mega-sale
[57:16.200 --> 57:17.200]  right now.
[57:17.200 --> 57:19.320]  Stop their attempt to shut us down.
[57:19.320 --> 57:23.120]  We need to bring in a lot of money, folks, just to continue on and to expand on their
[57:23.120 --> 57:25.920]  face because we don't expand their winning.
[57:25.920 --> 57:29.520]  And quite frankly, I don't want to give them any encouragement, but we need your support.
[57:29.520 --> 57:31.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are under attack.
[57:31.200 --> 57:34.480]  We're not complaining about it, but we're running out of ammo here, and we're on the
[57:34.480 --> 57:37.120]  hill fighting hard, okay?
[57:37.120 --> 57:44.360]  And infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple-A-253-3139, up to 67% off of the store,
[57:44.360 --> 57:45.360]  50% is the average.
[57:45.360 --> 57:46.360]  Take advantage of it.
[57:46.360 --> 57:49.160]  Hour number two with Owen Schroyer and myself, Fred.
[57:49.160 --> 57:54.120]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[57:54.120 --> 57:55.880]  and joint support.
[57:55.880 --> 57:59.040]  Remember the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[57:59.040 --> 58:02.840]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[58:02.840 --> 58:07.200]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[58:07.200 --> 58:11.360]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[58:11.360 --> 58:15.640]  Our pure turmeric extract, plus peppering from black pepper, makes for optimal absorption
[58:15.640 --> 58:20.840]  to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and
[58:20.840 --> 58:22.600]  so much more.
[58:22.600 --> 58:28.160]  Turmeric root from the store only contains 1 to 5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric
[58:28.160 --> 58:32.800]  root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[58:32.800 --> 58:38.840]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme
[58:38.840 --> 58:41.640]  to work synergistically for full body support.
[58:41.640 --> 58:50.440]  Try bodies today at infowarslife.com, or call us at 1-88-253-3139.
[58:50.440 --> 58:55.880]  You realize that when you spread the links from infowars.com, when you spread the videos,
[58:55.880 --> 58:58.120]  you are changing the world.
[58:58.120 --> 59:01.840]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist.
[59:01.840 --> 59:06.400]  It is you, the info warriors, across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood
[59:06.400 --> 59:10.280]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[59:10.280 --> 59:15.160]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[59:15.160 --> 59:16.160]  You are the info warrior.
[59:16.160 --> 59:21.240]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[59:21.240 --> 59:26.320]  go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[59:26.320 --> 59:32.200]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[59:32.200 --> 59:37.760]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[59:37.760 --> 59:40.960]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[59:40.960 --> 59:47.240]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[59:47.240 --> 59:53.000]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[59:53.000 --> 01:00:15.280]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.280]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:26.320]  All right, final segment with me here today, and then we've got Dr. Rume Corsi coming on
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:31.840]  about the $400 million in the real collusion with the State Department laundering money
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:37.800]  into Russia, anti-Russia operations and laundering and reportedly back to Hillary and her campaign.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.520]  It's a famous tactic that's coming up.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.040]  We're also going to have John Robert Ford on to get into all these subjects and probably
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.040]  open the phones up.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:49.920]  We should open the phones up for people to respond, but infowars is now the center of
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.680]  attention along with President Trump.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.400]  And why is that?
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.040]  It's because we're saying the truth.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:02.520]  We're saying the kryptonite to the globalist.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:07.480]  We're saying the coffin nails to their tyranny high noon to have empire, that the globalists
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:12.400]  are Chinese communist funded, that they want to implode America and make us dependent and
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:19.400]  domesticated, that they're working with Hollywood, the unelected EU, radical Islam is being used
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:23.920]  as their third world weapon to collapse our borders and bring down our sovereignty.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:24.920]  It's all admitted.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:30.560]  And we're pointing out that CNN and MSNBC are owned by the big multinational corporations
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:36.400]  that are in these powerful combines with China and others in the one world, new world order
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:41.280]  system that our own robber barons and British robber barons in the last 60, 70 years set
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.280]  up.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:45.640]  And this is in Carol Quigley's strategy, you know, and Brzezinski wrote books about it.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:50.080]  I'm just telling you what the established but said they were building.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:55.520]  People ask how did I 25 years ago know all this stuff and predicted how it all came true
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:01.000]  because I read the white papers, I read the books, we sell some of the books written by
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.880]  them at infowarstore.com.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:08.800]  So ladies and gentlemen, they are coming after us in congressional hearings and calling us
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.560]  holocaust deniers with no proof and all this stuff because they're scared of us because
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.840]  they're the globalists, they're the traders.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.680]  They sold out the unlimited money of the Federal Reserve and the fiat system and I'm not going
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.680]  to sell out Christianity.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.600]  I'm not going to sell out the unborn, I'm not going to sell out free market.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:29.560]  I'm not going to sell out to a global elite that are going to hurt people and dump people
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.680]  down and enslave them.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.480]  So everyone has a choice to make right now, which side they're on.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.480]  This is historic.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.000]  And everybody's got to really look themselves in the eye and say, wow, why are they saying
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  Trump's a traitor and the military needs to take him out in Congress?
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.400]  Why are the Republican cowards rolling over and joining in the chorus?
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.880]  Because they're cowards, they are on the wrong side of history.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:56.640]  They've been winning so long against America and Christians and others because we were
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.640]  asleep.
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.680]  They think they used to intimidate us for getting our face or threaten us that we'll get back
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:03.680]  in line.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.240]  We're never getting back in line.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.720]  You can't defeat 3% in any revolutionary war that won't give up.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:09.920]  You cannot defeat us.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.400]  We're way more than 3%.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:18.400]  We're more like 10% that are hardcore, another 20%, 30% get it to a certain extent.
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.600]  And that's the enemy's own numbers.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:24.280]  We are winning, but the bottom line, folks, M4s needs your prayers.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.280]  We need your financial support.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.680]  We need you to go to M4store.com.

[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:49.720]  Water filtration, whatever is the best highest rated, at a great price, Alexa Pure Pro Pure,

[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.280]  You need that at your police station.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.440]  You need that in your church.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:00.440]  You need the fund, info wars while you get reciprocal trade of high quality products,
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:03.960]  a total 360 non-zero sum game, win.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.040]  I didn't really plug a lot last hour, so I just wanted to put it out there again, that
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.040]  it is so critical.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.920]  Everybody listening to me right now to choose which side of history you're on, but whatever
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.720]  you do, you may not have a pot to piss in.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:15.720]  That's fine.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:21.520]  The biggest thing you can do is infowars.com, newswars.com, share it by hand, put it on business
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:26.440]  cards, ride it on the wall, whatever you've got to do to get the info out, we are going
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:30.240]  to win because info wars is verboten because we have the answer.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.720]  We can bring down the globalist.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.800]  We know the truth.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.280]  We're rebooting Americana.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.400]  We're rebooting free market common sense.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:37.400]  We love God.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.400]  We love you.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.400]  We love justice.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.400]  We have goodwill.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.960]  And you hear that all from Trump and you see it in his actions and that's why evil is so
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:44.960]  incredibly upset.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.880]  So please, please, whatever you do, get involved in the fight now more than ever.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.080]  I salute all of you that have helped us and taken action over the years.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.080]  Without you, we are nothing.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.080]  All right.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.080]  Back to the crew at Owen Schroyer.
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:58.600]  Now spread those live links to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter of our live feeds.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:03.560]  And info wars life and info wars life.com is extremely excited to announce our latest
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.560]  release.

[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.680]  Winner sun is a premium quality vitamin D three nutritional supplement.

[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.560]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D three content.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.160]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.

[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.720]  brain function, something the globalist are targeting.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:06:03.600]  Visit info wars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:15.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host, Owen Shroyer.
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:21.760]  All right, taking over the captain's seat now for Alex Jones and about to be joined by
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.320]  John Rappaport from no more fake news.com.
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:30.320]  Now I've got stacks of stacks of stacks of news on my desk.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.600]  I've got video clips that I need to get to.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:37.040]  I hope I can get to all of them.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:44.920]  It's just crazy because you have, let me tell you the biggest difference between what we
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.760]  do here at info wars and what every other news outlet does.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.160]  And we're going to have the clip before the show is over.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:58.600]  Even Fox News will say things about Alex Jones and info wars and they won't play a clip.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.880]  We play the clips.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.640]  We read their stories.
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.840]  We pull their quotes.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:08.400]  We go to them for the source and then we respond.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.680]  They make claims about us.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.280]  Never cite anything.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.440]  Never play the clips.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.720]  Never show the stories.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.800]  They just make baseless claims whether they believe it or not.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.140]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:21.880]  They report on it.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:26.600]  And this is why John Rappaport started no more fake news.com.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:35.600]  Years ago, John, I have a new analogy for what info wars is when it comes to news and
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.080]  just news outlets.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:46.040]  Info wars is the hulk of news media where the more they attack us, the more angrier they
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.840]  make us, the bigger and stronger and more powerful they get.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.720]  And they haven't realized that yet.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.960]  So keep attacking us.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:53.960]  Keep demonizing us.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.320]  In fact, I know that some of the crews probably listening.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.960]  We should probably put out a meme of info wars being the hulk and just getting bigger
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.600]  and stronger every time they attack us.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.040]  But John Rappaport, what do you make?
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.960]  For example, where they say, Trump's colluding with Putin.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:09.960]  Look at Trump.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:10.960]  He's the bad guy.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:11.960]  Russian hacking.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:12.960]  Russian meddling.
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:17.440]  Obama was warned about this in 2014 and 2016, stood down.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.720]  That's a direct quote from his officials, stand down.
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.760]  And yet the fake news can still report as if that never happened.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:31.560]  So John Rappaport, what do you make of the state of the news media in America right now?
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.360]  Bought off, I would say completely.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:41.160]  I've been going back and forth on this because I know a lot of mainstream reporters over
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:45.880]  the years that I've worked as an independent reporter.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:53.320]  And for the most part, I used to think that they were dumb.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:59.280]  They were smart enough to know what lines they weren't supposed to cross, but otherwise,
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:03.520]  not very curious, not interested in digging down.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.880]  Now I'm seeing something else completely.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.880]  This is an agenda.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.880]  This is a plan.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.880]  This is money.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.360]  This is George Soros.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:17.400]  This is people being bought off to say not only that Trump is a bad guy, not only to
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:26.840]  say that he colluded with Russia, not only to say that this is, he was never really elected,
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:36.000]  but to say that violence should be visited upon him, that it's okay.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.520]  For example, I don't know whether you guys have flashed current New Yorker cover on the
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.520]  screen.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.520]  You know what?
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:45.520]  I don't think we have covered that yet.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.000]  I have the tweet from Judge right here.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.120]  He says, the left's continued fetish for Trump's physical harm slash death is stunning.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.560]  And they make it look like, oh, he's falling down the stairs here.
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:58.840]  But the way they have the red tie, that could easily be, oh, is that a pool of blood?
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:00.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:04.600]  And it looks like he's been shot, okay, assassinated.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:11.960]  This is on the cover of the New Yorker recent, you know, current edition.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:17.240]  And of course, they give this explanation, okay, well, we're just talking about the fact
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:22.920]  that he came down the escalator when he announced that he was going to run for president.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:29.720]  And this is a metaphorical picture of what happened after his disastrous meeting with
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.840]  Putin, blah, blah, blah.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:40.320]  But no, it's not, you know, to anybody with any sense looking at this in this media atmosphere
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:45.200]  that everybody is swimming in and sucking air in.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:53.480]  This is another version of, hey, if Trump dies, that's okay.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:58.080]  If Trump is killed, that's, well, you know, that's the way it goes.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.720]  And that's just the light stuff.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.200]  All of this is part of a plan.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.560]  This is not just accidental.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:14.800]  People in the media who were formerly just being nasty and critical are now emerging
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:18.920]  with Trump should be assassinated.
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:22.880]  Well, they came out and said that pretty much immediately after he was elected.
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:25.200]  I mean, you had Madonna saying, let's blow up the White House.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.880]  Johnny Depp saying, has anyone, when was last time an actor killed the president?
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:37.800]  Snoop Dogg depicting an assassination, the one ugly man, woman, chucky child that had
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.920]  the decapitated Trump head.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:40.920]  So it's really nothing new.
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:41.920]  It just continues.
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:48.680]  Well, the thing that I find that's new about it is the willingness, first of all, the willingness
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:55.720]  of the media to give space to these stories as if they're really legitimate news stories.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:01.480]  And secondly, for some of these supposedly objective news people themselves to come
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:07.760]  forth and in some kind of smirking fashion indicate that they kind of think it's okay
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.440]  if somebody kills Trump, too.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:12.480]  Yeah, it's like, it's kind of like numbing them to it.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.440]  So it's like when it happens, you know, they won't feel bad, they've already been numb
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.440]  to it.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.040]  The thought has already reached their consciousness stream.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:25.560]  So then it's just like, oh, he's dead, yeah, you know, cool, let's even celebrate that.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:31.720]  But this is like 1984 level brainwashing, John, where last night, moveon.org hosted
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.720]  an event.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.720]  They live streamed the whole thing.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.120]  I actually rebroadcasted it and responded it in real time.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.040]  Some people enjoyed my improv comedy.
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.720]  Some people thought I was a hack.
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:44.280]  But either way, they're talking about, they say Trump is destroying the country.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.920]  Trump is destroying us.
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:46.920]  Trump is rebuilding.
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.200]  I got another record right here.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:52.040]  U.S. oil production hits record first at 11 million barrels a day.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:57.440]  So you've got record confidence in the housing market, record stock market, record jobs.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.800]  Just record, record, record, building, building, building.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:00.880]  And then what do they say?
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.880]  Trump's destroying the country.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:05.600]  So destroying is now building and building is now destroying.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.440]  That's literally right out of 1984.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:10.120]  We've got Alex Jones who wants to pop in on the conversation here.
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:13.840]  Guys, let's pop Alex up.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:16.720]  I just wanted to just call him for a minute or two because I'm listening to you and John
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.560]  here while I'm with my family.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.040]  And I just wanted to back up what he's saying.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.840]  It is new that they've gotten rid of just the Dumbo's and brought in operatives and
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:24.840]  deep staters.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.000]  Most of them have intelligence agency backgrounds.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.520]  And Phil Mudd, former deputy director of FBI and CIA, is on TV again this week saying,
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.600]  the military needs to take out Trump.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:34.840]  He needs to be dealt with.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:38.280]  You've got Congressman Cohen saying military could.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:44.280]  So yes, they are laying the groundwork for normalization to kill the president and intimidate
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.280]  him and his family.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:50.440]  But meanwhile, his daughter is out saying we need a pro human future, not one of robots.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:53.120]  Let's build a future where we still have workers.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.360]  Trump is for real folks.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.360]  That's why they're so scared.
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.840]  That's why things are turning around.
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:00.840]  I just wanted to back up what he's saying is this is criminal.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.840]  This is going on because these people have committed crimes.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.880]  They're backed up by the communist Chinese.
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:08.640]  And Tucker Carlson finally brought that up the other night.
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:09.800]  China owns our debt.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.680]  China owns Hollywood now.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.640]  China is in control of most of the universities.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:15.640]  That's admitted.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:16.640]  That's the real threat.
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:17.640]  They're scared.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.000]  They've committed espionage.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.480]  They believe the CFR of the Chinese century.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.480]  They sold us out.
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.760]  They were on the anti-American bandwagon.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.160]  That's why it's in all their own internal documents.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:32.480]  That's why people like Bill Maher is betting against America and hopes we go bankrupt because
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.760]  they really are traders.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:35.760]  And they're the enemy.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.680]  And that's why they keep saying we are.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:38.680]  Back to you guys.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:39.680]  Great job.
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:41.960]  I really appreciate the work of NoMoreFakeNews.com and John Rappaport.

[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:54.640]  The strident effect right now, hey, this is the forbidden.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.640]  This is the verboten.
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:56.640]  They don't want you to hear Alex Jones.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:01.000]  Just say tune in for yourself and see what he's really saying, why they're having congressional
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  hearings.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.480]  I know you're a media analyst, Rappaport.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.160]  I want to get your take when we come back.
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.040]  I'll be listening about why you think they're honing in on us so much and why they're so
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.040]  afraid.
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.040]  Back to you guys.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.040]  Sorry to interrupt.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:16.640]  I'm getting John Rappaport's opinion on that in the next segment and I just want to put
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.160]  a bow on what Alex was just saying.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:23.600]  I had actually just, I guess it was two days ago, I had a conversation with Alex about
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:27.480]  this exact thing and I said, look, Alex, I think they're going to kill him.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.840]  I think straight up they're going to kill Donald Trump.
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:33.600]  They want him dead and he's not going to stop fighting them.
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.440]  I think that they're going to assassinate President Trump and then you see the New
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:41.240]  Yorker and then everything else and Phil Mudd and we went down the road in this conversation.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:43.040]  He said, you know what though, Owen?
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.920]  Even if they kill him, he still wins.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:48.360]  Even if they strike him down, he becomes more powerful than ever.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.600]  So they don't know what to do.
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.280]  We have them against the ropes.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:56.960]  We just have to keep fighting and keep punching politically and if the red wave wins, it's
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:57.960]  over.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.840]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:05.520]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way, the bug assault,

[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:03.760]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide, thanks for
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.760]  holding.
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:10.920]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now, I remember back when Info Wars
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:15.680]  and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and it had to load down the
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:19.600]  page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.960]  and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:28.800]  the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:34.160]  Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Michael ZX biting, it's all amazing.
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.160]  Thank you brother.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:39.720]  Yeah and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:44.120]  the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:49.400]  you know God, the more you fear God, the more you chase God and I wanted to say that it's
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:59.440]  an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.800]  Everyone who's studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified.
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:10.380]  We have global, hardcore, anti-human psychopaths in control of the big corporations.
[01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:15.680]  They're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control, dumb humanity down ahead of
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.120]  replacing us with machines and Trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.120]  a human future.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:25.920]  They are launching a civil war against nation states right now, collapsing our borders and
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:31.480]  my only message is this, everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:35.200]  Everybody should be very, very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:39.320]  launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control people.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:43.480]  Those of us that are pro-human don't crave power, we already have the power but we have
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:49.080]  to realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now.
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:51.680]  Info wars is on the front line and so are you.
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:20:01.920]  We are the resistance.
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:10.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:34.560]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:44.560]  All you have to do is ask yourself what would the response be like in the media had somebody
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:52.360]  depicted Barack Hussein Obama's assassination as many times as President Trump's assassination
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:55.440]  has been depicted.
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.280]  This is of course at the same time they say when they go low we go high.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:05.800]  I guess that means they get so high on ketamine that they imagine Donald Trump being assassinated
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.680]  over and over in their head.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:12.920]  We got a clip coming up here of Fox News even now and I'm not saying Fox News is our enemy
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:16.720]  but the clips now of them even attacking us.
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:20.280]  And so Alex wanted to get John Rappaport's take on this from NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:25.400]  John, why do you think info wars is at the center of the crosshairs right now when it
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:31.560]  comes to real media being under attack?
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:32.560]  Issues.
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:40.120]  One is globalism and the other is also connected which is the immigration issue.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:43.400]  These are two major, major powder cakes.
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:47.080]  The media assumed that Hillary Clinton was going to win the election and then it was
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:54.400]  going to be one giant wonderful fascist scum global village for all.
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:22:01.280]  That everything would sink into a kind of collective oblivion for the entire planet
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:11.600]  after eight years of her after Obama and that the media would be complicit as always and
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:17.880]  then all of a sudden on election night something happened and it wasn't that way at all.
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:23.840]  And this guy out of nowhere named Trump whatever you think of him and I don't care what anybody
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:28.960]  thinks of him, one way or another, what was he talking about?
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:34.200]  He was talking about destroying globalism especially on issues of trade.
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:42.920]  He was talking about nationalism which is like the silver bullet to vampires or werewolves
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:51.040]  and he was talking about a ceiling on immigration which any sensible person would understand
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:56.440]  clearly from the point of view of what does it cost governments all over the world to
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.920]  have open borders.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:04.400]  In other words, ask a so-called liberal anytime what is your top limit on immigration?
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:09.360]  You must have a number after which you'll be satisfied, right?
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.400]  And then it turns out no, you're wrong.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:17.160]  No, these lunatics are saying there is no number, there is no country, there is no border,
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:25.080]  there is no law, there is no anything and that's their platform.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:26.920]  That's what they're aiming for.
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:34.800]  This is an operation of chaos to bring on what would be a major global security action
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:43.640]  in the middle of chaos to install a puppet kind of dictatorship over the entire planet.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:51.880]  So it's because we've been so anti-globalist, because we've been so pro-america and now
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:55.480]  we have the president in the United States that echoes the same sentiments.
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.800]  But John, I want to get your response to this video clip.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:04.280]  Let's now go to this was Fox News today going along with the next phase I guess in this
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:05.480]  attack of Info Wars.
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:09.640]  One you group us in with holocaustinars, you don't originally call us holocaustinars
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:13.160]  but you group us in with the holocaustinars then you go down to the next step and now
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.000]  we are holocaustinars.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.600]  Let's go to now even Fox News wanting to attack Info Wars.
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:24.480]  Facebook in the hot seat again, Mark Zuckerberg is now trying to clarify comments he made
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.480]  about holocaustinars.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:32.440]  The CEO now saying in a post, if a post crossed the line, it wouldn't be removed.
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:37.800]  But that is a little different from what we heard him say earlier, listen.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:42.800]  I don't believe that our platform should take that down because I think that there are things
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:48.280]  that different people get wrong either, I don't think that they're intentionally getting
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:49.280]  wrong.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:54.240]  But I think it's hard to have three-page intent and to understand the intent.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:59.400]  Fox News headlines 24-7 reporter Carly Schimkus joins me now, Carly, this is an incredibly
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:05.480]  complicated story and Mark Zuckerberg himself does not seem to have figured out how to go
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:06.480]  about this.
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:07.480]  You're right, you're right.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.000]  It's almost like they're kind of learning as they go along.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.840]  Now, Facebook has been facing a lot of difficult questions, a lot of tough questions, over
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:20.840]  why they haven't deleted controversial conspiracy theory websites from their site.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:26.080]  Now, right now the policy that they have implemented is that they will delete individual
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:31.720]  controversial posts, but they will allow the source to remain on the site, like Info Wars,
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:38.280]  as long as they are not expressing violence in those posts, those posts will then be deleted.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:43.680]  A lot of people say that Info Wars does do that, Mark Zuckerberg faced a lot of questions
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:48.240]  from what he said because he said that people don't intentionally get it wrong.
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:51.000]  Many of those say that, yes, exactly, that's exactly what they're trying to do.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.400]  He's really coming under fire for a lot of this, forcing him to respond and in his clarification
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:00.560]  he says, I personally find Holocaust denial deeply offensive, and I absolutely did not
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.440]  intend to defend the intent of people who deny that.
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:05.440]  That's right.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:09.040]  Another important point to make is that Mark Zuckerberg himself is Jewish.
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:13.360]  I think that what is really important to him, of course, is freedom of speech, and that
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.320]  is a very good thing, of course, but it gets confusing because Mark Zuckerberg says he
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:22.080]  doesn't want to decide what is wrong and what is right, but at the same time they're
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:24.720]  fighting this ongoing battle with fake news.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.960]  So what we're seeing unfold right now is that they don't really know what to do here in
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:29.960]  these tough issues.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.960]  Yeah, they want to ban us, but they don't want to be outriding against the first amendment.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:37.200]  They want to be outriders of his shareholders and making money, and he has the confidence
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.680]  to shore up of his users.
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:39.680]  That's for sure.
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:40.680]  Thank you very much.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:43.440]  All right, so you know what, look, maybe I was a little too hard on them and they didn't
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:48.480]  really come out and attack infowars, but the point is, but that's it, though.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.840]  It is all about infowars.
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.760]  We're the ones that are effective.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:57.080]  We're the ones that are influencing all of these other smaller channels that are liberty-based,
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:01.600]  free thought-based, free speech-based, and that now they're getting a big audience, too.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:05.560]  So we're having an impact, so they're like, okay, we have to stop this at the head.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:06.880]  That's why infowars is the target.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:07.880]  John Rappaport.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:08.880]  Yeah.
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:13.280]  I almost fell asleep during that Fox segment, by the way.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.760]  Really riveting stuff, right?
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:15.760]  Yeah.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:21.360]  I mean, boy, it's just, but they said, John, we're going to break it down.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:25.440]  They just kept throwing in infowars here, infowars there, infowars here.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.640]  No context, no nothing.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:28.640]  Yeah.
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:37.920]  Look, all these media outlets, they look at infowars numbers, they look at their own numbers,
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:44.840]  and their blood begins to boil because they're losing, infowars is winning along with other
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:48.800]  independent media outlets, and they don't know what to do.
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:55.640]  What are they going to do, except maybe decide that, you know, let's have an assassination
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:01.680]  special tonight where we'll have 16 reporters on saying, let's kill Trump.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:02.680]  Let's kill Trump.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:05.560]  And maybe that will raise our numbers up higher.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.560]  You know, I mean...
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:07.560]  You know what?
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:08.560]  Here's the thing.
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:11.040]  I got a clue and a hint, and Fox News kind of gets this.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.560]  Look, again, that's why I don't attack Fox News.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.960]  I don't think they're the biggest enemy.
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:17.720]  I understand that there's people over there that are full of it, people over there that
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:22.880]  hate us, but honestly, like the trick, the trick, John, and some of them are starting
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.880]  to get this.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:28.440]  Like, I can't even believe Tucker Carlson is on air, honestly, some of his shows.
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:32.160]  The trick is to be more like infowars.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:33.600]  That's the trick.
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.400]  That's how you get more audience, that's how you get more viewers.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.080]  People think like we think.
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:44.080]  Those are the people that are looking for news these days, but that's why they just sit there
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.720]  and they do these milk toast segments like the last one.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:49.480]  That's not hard hitting.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:50.520]  People want the hard hitting.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.640]  They want to know what's really going on.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:55.640]  We'll be right back with more from John Rappaport.

[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:35.880]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:40.400]  So we've been talking about the fake news with John Rappaport but I've got another story
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:47.480]  that's right up his alley but first I want to get a good laugh here with John Rappaport
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:50.360]  from nomorefakenews.com.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:53.720]  There is a Major League Baseball player, Josh Hader.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:58.120]  He is a pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers and when he was a teenager in high school apparently
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:01.280]  he tweeted something that was well a little insensitive.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:08.720]  So the MLB is now ordering the Major League pitcher Josh Hader to go to sensitivity training.
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:10.640]  This is now our reality, John.
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:14.800]  If you tweeted something insensitive, you need to go to sensitivity training.
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:19.920]  So John, I'm going to send over the sensitivity training officials to your house.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.680]  I think that you need some sensitivity training, John.
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:23.680]  You're just too insensitive.
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.680]  I agree.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:28.200]  I agree and it's getting worse.
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.520]  My condition is not improving in any way.
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.680]  I mean, I'm becoming more and more.
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:34.600]  We have to do something about this immediately.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:37.920]  Yeah, and it's all your fault too, by the way.
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:38.920]  We're going to have you...
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:39.920]  No, no, no.
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:40.920]  This is actually...
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:44.880]  This is a typical insensitive person right here trying to blame somebody else.
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:45.880]  Don't worry.
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:46.880]  We're going to train this out of you.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:47.880]  Okay.
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:53.720]  Well, I need it as fast as possible because I'm afraid that I might do something dangerous.
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:58.480]  Now, for example, let me show you how insensitive I really am.
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:03.120]  Listen to this quote, which you won't find, by the way, folks, all you millions of people
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:07.680]  here, you're not going to find this quote on any other news outlet of any prominence
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:08.680]  in the world.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:19.240]  This quote is, in 2016 alone, the Obama administration dropped at least 26,171 bombs.
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:25.760]  This means that every day last year, meaning 2016, the U.S. military blasted combatants
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:35.480]  or civilians overseas with 72 bombs, that's three bombs every hour, 24 hours a day.
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:37.760]  Is that why he's Barack Obama?
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:40.200]  Obama, exactly my point.
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:42.840]  This is a revelation.
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:50.160]  This comes from The Guardian newspaper in England, which is one of the most left-wing
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:53.760]  liberal news outlets, and there it is.
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:54.760]  You guys are incredible.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:55.760]  I don't know how you do this.
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:57.760]  You just pop it right up on the screen.
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:58.760]  The crew's amazing.
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:35:59.760]  Yeah.
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.760]  So there you have it.
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:01.760]  Okay.
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:04.480]  This is the kind of thing that you're not going to find on CNN or Fox.
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:05.480]  Wait a second.
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:06.480]  Wait a second.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:07.480]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:08.480]  Who?
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:12.580]  Which Hussein dropped more bombs, Saddam Hussein or Barack Hussein?
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:17.120]  Well, Saddam Hussein was gone by 2016.
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:23.040]  I don't think there's any question that I would have to bet on Barack Hussein as having
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:30.320]  dropped more, because in 2016 dropped at least 26,171.
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:36.680]  Now suppose this became a major story on MSNBC and CNN and so forth.
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:39.680]  This discovery, blah, blah, blah, Chris Matthews, my God.
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.240]  I don't know what to say.
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:43.200]  The tangle is gone from my leg now.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:44.200]  Chris Matthews.
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:49.320]  Man, you know, look at this, Obama just revealed here.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:56.000]  Forget what Trump said to Putin or Putin said to Trump or whether Trump had to apologize
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  or whatever.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  No.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.480]  Let's forget about he said, he said, they said, let's look at a couple of facts here.
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:08.040]  In 2016, Obama dropped 26,000 bombs.
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:09.040]  Actually bombs.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:14.600]  Oh, and by the way, and the list of all the countries that he was bombing was the list
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:20.440]  that he originated as the travel ban, which then they called Trump's Muslim ban.
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:23.920]  So it was Obama's travel ban because he was bombing those countries.
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:27.680]  Then Trump gets in and it becomes Trump's Muslim ban.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:31.840]  But just while we're on Obama, and then I want to get your take on another story here.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.160]  You know, this is all coming out.
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:36.040]  I'm actually going to highlight this in the next segment.
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:44.840]  But Obama was warned in 2014 and 2016 about the quote, unquote, Russian interference.
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:46.680]  We have the C-SPAN videos.
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:48.360]  We have the hearings.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:53.880]  His own officials said, quote, Obama said, stand down.
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:59.140]  So it's just like the children at cages, the separation of families, it's just like everything.
[01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:01.600]  It all can be led back to Obama.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:02.600]  It's really unbelievable.
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:07.080]  But you can you can respond to that or John, this story is right up your alley.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.240]  There was a story from pewtrust.org today.
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:14.440]  These pills could be the next U.S. drug epidemic public health officials say they're talking
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:20.600]  about anti-anxiety pills, things such as Xanax, Valium, Ativan, Clonopin, etc.
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:25.880]  The next drug epidemic, of course, the opiates or are the current drug epidemic, but they're
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:28.520]  saying these anti-anxiety pills could be the next.
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:30.600]  I don't know if it's fair to say the next, John.
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.720]  I think that you know the numbers and the facts here.
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:34.520]  I think it already is.
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:36.020]  Yeah.
[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:42.080]  These drugs like Xanax, for example, have been the epidemic for the last, I don't know,
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:43.080]  20 years.
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:45.000]  I mean, it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.760]  And by the way, those are the drug companies that fuel news outlets like CNN and MSNBC.
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:50.760]  Go ahead.
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:51.760]  Yeah.
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:52.760]  That's right.
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:58.120]  That's a major point, Owen, because these pharmaceutical companies in a sense own the
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:38:59.960]  news outlets.
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:03.160]  So therefore, they control the news.
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:08.560]  And what they want as news is news, and what they don't want is not news.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:11.760]  Meanwhile, they're poisoning populations.
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:14.560]  They're eating out America from the inside.
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:18.880]  You want to find out what globalism is really all about at the core.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:24.160]  You look at the medical cartel, the Rockefeller brand of medicine, which is the most toxic
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:26.760]  ever devised on the planet.
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:31.640]  And what they're talking about, I don't know who these people are at the Pew Trust that
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:35.080]  are just waking up from their own delirium.
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:37.360]  I don't know what pills they've been taking.
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:41.320]  Well, they just got, they just ratcheted the Xanax bars down.
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.320]  Yeah.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.360]  They just woke up to the fact.
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:45.840]  They're alive again.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.000]  Yeah.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:52.480]  That these pills have been destroying people's lives for at least the last 30 or 40 years,
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.920]  and it isn't getting better.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:55.440]  It's getting worse.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:03.880]  And this is part of what it means to make America livable again, is for people to be
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:09.560]  able to walk away from these drugs and put their lives back together in terms of natural
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:14.160]  health and what health is actually all about.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:20.480]  Not these incredible drugs that, because people are not just taking these for a week in an
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:21.920]  acute crisis.
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:26.760]  They're getting prescribed these drugs for years and years and decades, and it's destroying
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:27.760]  populations.
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:30.960]  Well, and it's actually incredible.
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:36.080]  You know, I don't know when this whole phase started, but I remember being in high school
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:38.640]  and college, and it was like, it was like pop culture.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.640]  It was like a thing.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:42.000]  You heard it in rap songs and everything, you know, get barred out.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.520]  They had a bunch of different nicknames for it, like buses and stuff like that.
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:48.960]  I was never into any sort of pharmaceutical drugs, honestly.
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:53.480]  I thank God that I never went down that road, as some of my friends did.
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:59.160]  But you can see it in real time when they're high on these drugs, which I don't know.
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:03.080]  It's like, honestly, the crazy thing too about it, John, is they're so prevalent.
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:07.520]  These are supposedly prescription drugs that should be hard to get, but they're so prevalent
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:11.400]  where you have large groups of people getting high on these things every day.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:13.800]  It's like, how is that even possible?
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:19.880]  The obvious answer is that the pharmaceutical companies are actually trafficking, which
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:27.480]  has been already proven in the area of opioids with Purdue, pharma, and other companies.
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:34.640]  They're not just selling to pharmacies, to doctors, to patients who are in severe pain.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:39.520]  They're trafficking millions of pills to dealers.
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:48.920]  And under Obama, here we go again, 2016, a law was passed, almost unanimously voted on
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:57.040]  by Congress, that hamstrung the DEA from being able to walk into a major pharmaceutical company
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.860]  and say, we know you're trafficking.
[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:03.560]  We know which shipments you're sending out that are not legitimate.
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:08.200]  We're freezing the shipments, we're busting your ass, and we're going to put you on trial
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:10.880]  and send you to prison.
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:17.680]  That is now very, very, very, very, very difficult to do for the DEA because of Congress.
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.400]  But wait, John, we warned them.
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:24.500]  We said in the things, in the fine print, the commercials warning could cause brain damage
[01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:26.760]  and suicidal thoughts and all that good stuff.
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:27.760]  We warned them, John.
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:28.760]  Wait a minute.
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:29.760]  Let's see.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:30.760]  Hold on.
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:31.760]  Can I find a small note?
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:35.360]  My magnifying glass isn't big enough to actually find a small print.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:37.440]  Can you find that small print for us, John?
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:38.440]  Please.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:39.440]  I don't know.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.440]  Somebody ought to bring that up.
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:41.440]  All right.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:44.520]  We're going to get the fine print for John, but John Rappaport from No More Fake News,
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:45.520]  he's about to leave us.
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:48.440]  John, we're sending the sensitivity team over to your place.
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:51.000]  We're taking you to sensitivity training.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.760]  You're too insensitive, John.
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:55.640]  We cannot handle your website, nomorefakenews.com.
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:43:01.360]  We cannot handle it.
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:06.320]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.320]  yeast.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:10.360]  Mycos went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment.
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:14.680]  Our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:19.920]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:23.480]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:26.080]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.

[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:44.200]  bark, and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:47.240]  of time as powerful microbalancing properties.

[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:00.880]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:05.440]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:10.840]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:16.240]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:17.760]  to unhealthy levels.
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:24.280]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:28.280]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.680]  in the rainwater.
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:34.960]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:41.040]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:46.680]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:52.000]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.680]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:04.400]  Anyone who's studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified.
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:09.960]  We have global, hardcore, anti-human psychopaths in control of the big corporations.
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:15.240]  They're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control, dumb humanity down ahead of
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:17.320]  replacing us with machines.
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:20.680]  And Trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:25.520]  They are launching a civil war against nation states right now, collapsing our borders.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:31.080]  And my only message is this, everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now.
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:34.800]  Everybody should be very, very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:38.920]  launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control people.
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:41.640]  Those of us that are pro-human don't crave power.
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:42.640]  We already have the power.
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:46.960]  But we have to realize these scum are coming after us, and we have to speak out and take
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:48.640]  action now.
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:51.280]  Info wars is on the front line, and so are you.
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:58.040]  We are the resistance.
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:01.880]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have it
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:03.560]  in fuller's life.
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:04.560]  It take hours.
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.880]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:08.080]  It's stronger.
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:09.640]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:12.920]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:14.000]  It's back in stock.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.200]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:20.760]  It's got the preglonone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:25.040]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids, so you can upload it.
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:30.080]  Our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:34.200]  toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:35.200]  It's a spray you do.
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:36.440]  You can also swallow it.
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:41.920]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:43.120]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:48.880]  So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:52.320]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.320]  the word.
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:47:01.440]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:26.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:33.320]  Let's really look at how fake most television news is.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:40.840]  Let's really analyze how fake the Democrats and the left-wing media have become.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:42.440]  Hillary Clinton is going to win the election.
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:43.440]  It's over.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:44.440]  It's not even close.
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:48.960]  Oops, wrong.
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:50.640]  Trump colluded with Russia.
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.960]  That's how he won the election.
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:56.680]  Oops, no, it's Hillary Clinton that colluded with the Russians.
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:03.200]  On so many different fronts, like it's absurd whether it be Uranium-1, whether it be hundreds
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:06.560]  of millions of dollars at the Clinton Foundation, whether it be half a million dollars to bill
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:12.200]  Clinton for a speech, whether it be the dossier that the Clinton campaign paid for that came
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:14.920]  from five Russian intelligence sources.
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:17.720]  That's all the proof of Hillary Clinton colluding with Russia.
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:20.280]  Where is the evidence of Trump doing it?
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:21.280]  None.
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:23.320]  How about Trump's travel ban?
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:25.760]  They say it's a Muslim ban.
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:30.080]  It was started by Obama as a travel ban from the countries he bombed, but somehow it becomes
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:33.040]  Trump's Muslim ban.
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:34.600]  Separating kids at the border.
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:36.360]  Trump, he's separating kids at the border.
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:37.920]  Look at how heartless he is.
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:45.080]  No, this is a practice that is law that's been going on for decades.
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:49.400]  And if you want to know the truth of it, the children are separated from their parents
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:51.960]  in their home countries and they send them here.
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:54.760]  There's no parents when they even get here.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:57.720]  Look at Trump separating kids at the border.
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:48:59.160]  Trump putting kids in cages.
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:00.160]  Oops.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:06.440]  You find out that the photo that originated that headline was from the Obama administration.
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.760]  And it just goes on and on and on and on and on.
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:12.040]  There's a hundred different examples.
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:16.440]  The latest though has to be the Russian hacking or the Russian meddling in the election.
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.640]  It's all Trump's fault.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:18.800]  He's out of control.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:20.880]  How dare he say that America is to blame for this?
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:23.040]  But wait.
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:28.120]  If Russia is really trying to influence and hack our elections, why did the Obama administration
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:29.520]  stand down?
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:35.240]  And just one step further, and then I'll retreat, if we're really so afraid about Russia meddling
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:39.040]  in our elections, why are we having open voter registration for non-citizens?
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:43.840]  If Russia wanted to meddle in our elections, they could send one million Russians to California
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:47.280]  to vote and then it'd be game over.
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:50.800]  They could send a million to Texas and it'd be game over.
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:54.600]  So if you're really worried about Russian meddling in our elections, why do you have
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:56.240]  non-citizens voting?
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:57.720]  So there's no rhyme or reason to it.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:02.040]  But to go back to my point, why did the Obama administration stand down?
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:07.840]  Oh, let me guess, CNN, MSNBC, and the Washington Post, New York Times are going to say, I'm
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:09.720]  a conspiracy theorist.
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:17.200]  Look at Infowars saying, oh look at Infowars saying that California wants to have non-citizens
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:18.200]  vote.
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:19.200]  No.
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:20.200]  That's a fact.
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.200]  That's a fact right now.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:24.840]  And they even have ads with Michelle Obama and a bunch of other liberals in Hollywood
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:27.720]  and everything like, oh yeah, get out and vote.
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:29.320]  The democracy, is it a threat?
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:30.560]  Like everyone agrees with that.
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:33.480]  No, people are going to get out and vote for the Republicans and Trump.
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:36.360]  You don't even get how you're losing yet.
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:40.960]  But Infowars is a conspiracy theorist saying that the Obama administration ordered a stand
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:42.560]  down.
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:48.560]  The Obama administration ordered a stand down according to Infowars conspiracy theorist.
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:53.640]  Well, unlike everyone else that attacks Infowars and Alex Jones, that doesn't play the clips,
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:55.600]  I'm going to play you the clips.
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:57.680]  Let's go to C-SPAN.
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:07.160]  This is from June of this year, the Obama official admitting Obama ordered a stand down
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:09.440]  on Russian hacking.
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:15.600]  This is a question I have for you, Mr. Daniel, and this puzzle's, there's a quote I want
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:22.720]  to read you from an article that appeared of what happened in late August of 2016.
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:27.160]  At his morning staff meeting, Daniel, matter of fact, said to his team, it had to stop
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:33.160]  working on options to counter the Russian attack, quote, we've been told to stand down.
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:35.000]  That's a quote from you.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:40.480]  Daniel Prito, one of Daniel's top deputies, recalled, quote, I was incredulous and in
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:41.680]  disbelief.
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:43.520]  It took me a moment to process.
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:46.960]  In my head, I was like, did I hear that correctly?
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:47.960]  End quote.
[01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:51.520]  Then Prito asked, quote, why the hell are we standing down?
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:54.160]  Michael, can you help us understand?
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:55.880]  Question mark, end quote.
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:52:00.280]  Is that an accurate description of what happened?
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:08.480]  So that is an accurate rendering of the conversation at the staff meeting, but the larger context
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:13.600]  is something that we can discuss in the classified session.
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:23.440]  But I can say that there were many concerns about the widespread, how many people were
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:26.800]  involved in the development of the options.
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:32.960]  And so the decision at that point was to neck down the number of people that were involved
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:36.440]  in developing our ongoing response options.
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:41.720]  And it's not accurate to say that all activities ceased at that point.
[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:42.720]  So that's strange.
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:46.080]  So Russian meddling, Russian hacking, the biggest story, oh my gosh, we have to impeach
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:48.280]  Trump over it.
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:50.160]  Obama didn't seem to care that much.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:58.040]  Let's now go to a clip of former DHS Secretary Jay Johnson on MSNBC once again saying this
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:01.840]  can come right back to the Obama administration standing down.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:06.680]  When it comes to superpowers, we all tend to behave the same way.
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:12.280]  If you make something cost prohibitive, then you deter the actor from doing it again.
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:16.680]  And we've yet to do that when it comes to the Russian government.
[01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:20.400]  We've yet to say to them, hey, don't do this or else.
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:24.720]  We began that in the closing days of the Obama administration, but it's really up to this
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:27.400]  current administration to follow through in a lot of those actions.
[01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:31.800]  I've asked you this before, so I know the answer will Russia try to interfere again.
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:33.600]  The answer from you has always been yes.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:40.920]  I'm very concerned that in the midterms in the 2020 election, we could see Russian influence
[01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:44.720]  because basically they've been given very little reason to stop.
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:50.320]  So there's Jay Johnson, well, Russian influence is a big problem here.
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:54.960]  We stood down on it, but Trump should it.
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:58.720]  You go back to the Obama official, yes.
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:02.840]  We have here quotes saying that Obama said, stand down on the Russian influence.
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:03.840]  Is that accurate?
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:08.160]  Yes, that is an accurate recount, yes.
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:09.160]  You had Devin Nunes.
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:10.160]  You know what?
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:11.440]  This is actually the incredible thing about it.
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:12.680]  I mean, look at this.
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:18.160]  This is even political, a left-leaning rag headline.
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:22.400]  Obama team was warned in 2014 about Russian interference and did nothing.
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:29.080]  This is the, see, I remember when I went back reading these stories, I remember in 2016,
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:35.080]  and I've said this many times, Devin Nunes was actually kind of anti-Trump in the sense
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:42.200]  that he was kind of leading the forefront with the Russian meddling crap because he
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:48.600]  was actually seeing it in real time and seeing the Democrats standing down for two years.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:54.600]  So when this was all happening in 2016, Devin Nunes is sitting here throwing papers in
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:57.040]  the air, like, what the heck is going on here?
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:02.120]  We've got Russian meddling, and at this time he believes it got Trump in office.
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:05.400]  So he kind of thinks that there's something to Trump-Russia collusion, maybe not in so
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:10.560]  many words, but he sees the Russian hacking, he sees Obama standing down on it, and he
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:13.840]  sees Trump getting in, and he thinks that there's something to this.
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:17.400]  And so he kind of comes out as anti-Trump, but not as much anti-Trump, but pro-Russia
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:19.920]  interference in meddling.
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:25.480]  Then as time goes by, he sees what really happened here, and he's now obviously pro-Trump
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:30.000]  and doesn't buy the Russian influence thing, but I remember going back and seeing Nunes
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  do this.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:36.040]  So again, doesn't this just illustrate how fake it all is?
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:45.240]  It's so 1984, you might as well be reading 1984 and just call it 2018.
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:49.960]  Obama warned for two years about Russian interference, they stood down.
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:53.360]  Obama was putting, but it's not even Obama, it's been going on.
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:56.400]  During the Obama administration, kids were being put in cages.
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:58.960]  During the Obama administration, kids were being separated at families.
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:01.960]  Oh, but it's Trump's fault, Trump's the bad guy.
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:06.360]  Last night, there's a move-on protest that I filmed and responded to, it's on the Alex
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:11.760]  Jones channel, and on the Alex Jones Facebook, Donald Trump is destroying America.
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:14.120]  Yeah, he's destroying America by rebuilding it.
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:16.360]  He's destroying America by record job growth.
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:19.240]  He's destroying America by record economic growth.
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:22.000]  He's destroying America by record low unemployment.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  That's destroying.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:28.880]  Building it, creating it, making it wealthy and prosperous, again, is destroying it.
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:31.080]  This is the 1984 doubling.
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:32.600]  Oh, Trump colluded with Russia.
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:33.600]  Really how?
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:38.320]  Well, indictments and Mueller and Manafort, no, no, no, tell me how he colluded with Russia.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:40.800]  Well, we're gonna find out.
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:41.800]  Well, Hillary colluded with Russia.
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:43.720]  Oh, please, how did Hillary collude with Russia?
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:44.720]  Well, okay.
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:46.320]  Bill Clinton got half a million dollars for speech.
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:49.320]  Hillary Clinton has had hundreds of millions of dollars donated to the Clinton Foundation
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:50.960]  by Russians.
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:56.080]  She did the Uranium One deal, 20% of America's uranium went to Russia.
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:57:02.560]  She had intelligence officers get intel from Russian intelligence, and then that created
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:03.840]  a dossier.
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:10.640]  So there's all of the Clinton-Russia collusion sitting right out there, and with all of it,
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:17.680]  they, imagine, they're wearing a Russian hat, they have a Russian shirt on, they're
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:23.120]  waving a Russian flag, and they're like, look, Trump's colluding with Russia, he's colluding
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:27.200]  as they're waving the Russian flag, rubles pouring out of their pockets, just flush
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:31.160]  with Russian money, just Russia all over them, all of them met with Putin, it's all the
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:32.160]  same.
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:36.160]  Trump's colluding with Russia as they're waving the Russian flag, taking all hundreds of millions

[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:29.120]  Is there anything more disgraceful than a stooge and a puppet that goes on television
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:34.480]  pretending to be a voice of truth, pretending to be a voice of righteousness when they're
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:36.840]  nothing more than cowards and frauds?
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:40.040]  Is there anything more disgraceful than that?
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:49.240]  Well, see it for yourself with Anderson Cooper and Stephen Colbert slamming Trump saying
[02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:51.520]  he's disgraceful.
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:54.920]  You called Trump's performance disgraceful.
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:01:00.040]  I said the most disgraceful performance by an American president on the world stage
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:01.040]  in my lifetime.
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:02.040]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:03.040]  Pause it right there.
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:04.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:08.160]  In your lifetime as a CIA operative mockingbird press, yeah, yeah, it wasn't President Bush
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:10.600]  lying about weapons of mass destruction.
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:13.000]  No, I'm sure it wasn't that.
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:16.600]  I'm sure it wasn't all of the other lies that got us into war.
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:20.360]  I'm sure it wasn't if you want to keep your doctor, you can keep your doctor.
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:21.360]  That's Obamacare.
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:23.000]  Oops, nope, not.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.640]  It wasn't oh, free healthcare for all.
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:29.480]  Oh, you paid $27,000 to receive Obamacare before you even get any treatment.
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:32.160]  No, it wasn't any of those lies.
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:35.080]  Wasn't any of the lies from Obama, none of the lies from Bush.
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:39.920]  Yeah, it wasn't Bill Clinton lying about sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky or using
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:41.200]  a cigar for sexual pleasure.
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:42.720]  No, no, no, it was none of that.
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:46.560]  It was Trump being real and wanting to have a good relationship with Russia.
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:49.840]  Apparently, according to Anderson Cooper, who must want war with Russia, that's the most
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:51.360]  disgraceful thing he's ever seen.
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:53.760]  Go back to the CIA operative.
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:02:08.400]  It just popped out.
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:11.680]  The first thing I said as soon as the press conference was done, it just sort of popped
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:12.680]  out of my mouth.
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:13.680]  Uh-huh.
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:14.680]  Yeah.
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:15.680]  But you heard about, he changed one of the words, right?
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:16.680]  You heard about it.
[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:17.680]  Yes, I did.
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:18.680]  Well, that all makes sense now.
[02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:19.680]  Sure.
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:20.680]  Yeah, it's very clear.
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:21.680]  So now it's not disgraceful, it's graceful.
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:22.680]  Yes, exactly.
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:24.160]  It's the most graceful performance.
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:25.160]  Yes.
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:26.160]  Yeah.
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:28.660]  But he has the best words, as he told us during the campaign.
[02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:29.660]  Because he has the best words.
[02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:30.660]  But you?
[02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:31.660]  Very stable genius.
[02:02:31.660 --> 02:02:32.660]  Stable genius.
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:33.660]  You're a deep stable genius.
[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:34.660]  He is a stable genius.
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:35.660]  Yes.
[02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:36.660]  This is a jump ball.
[02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:37.660]  It's either one of you.
[02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:42.160]  Does anyone else share my feeling that I find it offensive to call it a performance?
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:44.760]  That it's a disgraceful performance?
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:45.760]  It's not a performance.
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:46.760]  That's what they're doing.
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:47.760]  Because he is the president.
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:48.760]  He's just disgraceful.
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:51.760]  There's no, if it's a performance, it's even worse.
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:52.760]  Yeah.
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:57.320]  So see, here's what you learn following these people.
[02:02:57.320 --> 02:03:02.000]  Everything that they try to project on Trump or Info Wars or just to project out there
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.600]  on anything, that's who they are.
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:06.800]  That's them.
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:07.800]  They're the liars.
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:08.800]  They're disgraceful.
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:14.240]  Stephen Colbert is disgraceful, going on air as a mouthpiece for the globalist against
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:15.240]  Trump.
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:18.680]  Anderson Cooper is disgraceful, a traitor to this country working as a CIA operative
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:20.600]  mockingbird press.
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:23.600]  Where are the disgraceful scum?
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:25.480]  That's why they projected on Trump.
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:29.760]  Honestly, I mean, you want to be perfectly honest, folks.
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:34.360]  Donald Trump is probably the most accomplished president the United States have ever had.
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:39.360]  I mean, you talk about individual accomplishments.
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:44.320]  I mean, other than the people that fought in the Revolutionary War, maybe Dwight Eisenhower,
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:48.760]  I mean, Trump, it's not even close.
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:50.480]  But I digress.
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:52.400]  You talk about disgraceful.
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:59.480]  How about Peter Stroke and Lisa Page, who now Lisa Page in her closed-door testimonies
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:03.320]  might be saying bombshell things that is going to bring this whole thing down.
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:07.200]  Let's listen to Representative John Ratcliffe revealing some of the things Page said in
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:08.200]  the closed-door hearing.
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:11.320]  There are differences in their testimony.
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:18.600]  In many cases, she admits that the text messages mean exactly what they say as opposed to Agent
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:24.920]  Stroke, who thinks that we've all misinterpreted his own words on any text message that might
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:25.920]  be negative.
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:26.920]  Uh-oh.
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:27.920]  Uh-oh.
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:28.920]  Uh-oh.
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:29.920]  Uh-oh.
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:38.080]  Our stroke and Lisa not on the same page.
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:43.800]  Oh, Peter Pennywise Stroke is in trouble, Peter.
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:47.880]  Peter, we all float in the end.

[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:56.640]  Float away, Peter, float away.

[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:52.720]  a peter stroke on my desk here it's like a little fly smash him into smithereens wipe
[02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:58.960]  him off all right anyway welcome back to the Alex Jones show Owen shroyer filling in here's
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:05.880]  the deal we covered this with John Rappaport the reason why mainstream television networks
[02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:10.000]  can't tell you about the drug epidemic going on because of big pharmaceutical drugs in
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:16.160]  this country is because that's who funds them you can probably not even go through one commercial
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:20.480]  break at CNN without seeing a prescription drug commercial and for that matter you know
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:26.600]  MSNBC probably Fox News as well so these are the people that fund television news and they
[02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:37.280]  have essentially unlimited resources and finances to be able to do this and then they're protected
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:44.600]  by secret courts now why am I telling you this a because it shows you kind of how mainstream
[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:51.560]  news operates where when you have sponsors and certain people that fund your news organization
[02:07:51.560 --> 02:08:02.800]  you have to protect essentially those clients by not producing content that might hurt their
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:10.400]  bottom line to put it simply okay so what does that mean well how often are you going
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:14.640]  to see mainstream television news mention the fact that almost every time there's a mass
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:18.760]  shooter they're on psychotropic drugs how often are you going to see mainstream news
[02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:22.640]  talking about the drug epidemic going on in this country how often are you going to see
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:28.360]  them write the stories about how the number is honestly incredible I can't remember I
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:34.240]  think it's 70% of college students are on some form of big pharmaceutical pills every
[02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:41.040]  day I mean you want to talk about mass poisoning you know just look at the side effects of
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:48.040]  these 70% of students are taking them so that's why you don't see those stories on television
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:52.760]  because they have to cater their message to their clients fine understandable our clients
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:09:01.840]  are you our clients support us at info or store.com so we don't have to worry about
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:08.680]  other businesses or corporations or industries being offended or hurting their bottom line

[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:27.880]  news organization versus what you see almost everywhere else where they have to have funding
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:35.040]  from big industries you know fast food pharmaceutical that's what they do to to fund themselves

[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:45.960]  Dr. Corsi I don't know how much research you've done into this and we can go down this road
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:49.560]  or we can go down a different road but there is an individual Bill Browder who most people
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:54.560]  have probably never heard of in fact I know Russ is very aware of him one of our producers
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:57.920]  was telling me about him two years ago how we needed to report on him but it kind of
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:02.200]  wasn't in the news so I just kind of dropped the ball but now last week Bill Browder has
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:07.800]  been doing his media campaign tour Dr. Corsi he's going on like five media outlets a day
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:12.120]  telling the world how bad Putin is telling the world how bad Trump is so this is now
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:17.680]  another deep state operative anti-nationalist operative who's going vocal against Trump
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:22.480]  and Putin why well I guess he's probably got something to hide of his own what do you
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:30.200]  think Jerry Corsi well definitely has something to hide on his own he is the was an entrepreneur
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:38.800]  who in the early part of 2000 went over to Russia and made about $1.5 billion renounced
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:45.680]  his US citizenship didn't pay any US taxes managed to get out of the Soviet Union gave
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:51.560]  part of his company his hermitage capital to HSBC and then I got involved in a money
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:59.040]  laundering scheme where he got the 1.5 billion out of Russia and didn't pay any Russian taxes
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:04.760]  and then he came back to the United States periodically and is the force behind this
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:11.440]  Magnitsky act because Magnitsky was his attorney that the Russian said cheated them out of
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:17.360]  the $230 million in tax and taxes and put him in prison so it's a complicated story
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:24.160]  but it's the story that Putin brought to the surface again and the Helsinki press conference
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:30.880]  by saying Browder engaged in all this fraud and contributed $400 million to Hillary Clinton
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:37.040]  which nobody knew about yeah and it was amazing to me when Vladimir Putin said that because
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:43.240]  again I'm somebody that kind of monitors media all day long and you never really saw or heard
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:48.360]  of Bill Browder outside of some other independent news outlets and Russian media you never really
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:54.320]  heard Bill Browder's name and then I see him going on all the different TV networks telling
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:13:00.080]  everybody how bad Trump is how bad Putin is how Russia's this big problem even though
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:05.280]  he left the United States to go to Russia I mean a total fraud and then Putin says Bill
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:10.760]  Browder's name he says George Soros his name so this is why they hate Russia so much this
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:14.480]  is why they hate Trump getting along with Putin because Putin knows what's going on
[02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:18.480]  I mean say whatever you want about Putin you know he's not going to take this crap from
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:24.480]  George Soros and Bill Browder well and and also now they've Putin is you know just dropped
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:34.560]  another bomb they filed charges in Russia against Browder for you know stealing all this money
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:44.320]  and not paying taxes and also then they've filed charges against several US diplomats
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:52.680]  and others in the intelligences agencies including this former let's get the file here I've
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:59.560]  been researching this extensively for the past week this Michael McFall who is the US
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:07.000]  ambassador it was the US ambassador to Russia in the period 2012 to 2014 and Russia is claiming
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:13.880]  that McFall is one of the people who helped Browder steal the money out of Russia and
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:20.440]  clearly with HSBC owning part of Browder's heritage capital it would have been quite
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:26.880]  possible to use HSBC for the money laundering it was at a time when Comey was on the
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:32.040]  yeah I was gonna say and then doesn't that doesn't that implicate a lot of more actors
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:37.800]  if that was the case right I mean this is serious case I mean this is serious charge
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:44.840]  because the Magnitsky case it ties in several different ways one it was the the case where
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:50.560]  we impose some of the most severe sanctions on Russia and that was really intensified
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:58.000]  the this is all in the Obama administration intensified the tensions with Russia and secondly
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:05.320]  the this whole issue of the Browder case comes up in this a attorney for the Russian attorney
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:11.080]  that was in there talking to Donald Trump Jr. she was in there talking all about his
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:15.760]  whole subject was to talk about Browder and she already had a prior relationship with
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:22.720]  Browder via Fusion GPS and this was the lawyer that was essentially snuck in the country
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:26.440]  by the Obama administration I mean nobody really still can figure out how she got in
[02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:30.480]  the country other than the Obama administration signing her off so so that's what's going
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:34.920]  on Jerome Corsi is on top of all of this Alex Jones is going to be joining us on the
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:40.280]  other side to discuss Putin who just who's calling it as it is folks I mean again say

[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:47.280]  he says forces in the United States are trying to undermine successful talks with Trump
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:51.520]  they want war with Russia they planned on war with Russia over Syria they're not getting

[02:20:25.800 --> 02:20:31.540]  so we're trying to tie all these geopolitical strings together here kid Daniels had a story
[02:20:31.540 --> 02:20:38.920]  last year Putin says Hillary behind Russian collusion hysteria and elites disrespect Trump
[02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:45.720]  voters and in this story he he mentioned some of this collusion and then the names like
[02:20:45.720 --> 02:20:51.840]  Bill Browder that are now becoming mainstream and but here's here's the story and I want
[02:20:51.840 --> 02:21:00.880]  to get Dr. Corsi's take on this in response so let's just look at Putin for a second
[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:06.240]  let's flash the clocks back two years when there were uprisings and violent protests
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:14.160]  in Kiev and in Crimea in the Ukraine where you had unidentified snipers shooting protesters
[02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:18.960]  and then the media blamed Putin for that and so Putin doesn't respond to the fake news
[02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:23.400]  anymore he genuinely doesn't care and so to the fake news they think that means he's
[02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:27.320]  guilty when the truth is he just doesn't care he doesn't bother to sling mud with the fake
[02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:34.080]  news then it comes out a year later that the snipers were actually Ukraine Ukrainian paid
[02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:41.280]  for Georgian snipers that were there to false flag it and blame Putin so it all came out
[02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:50.320]  this is what they do with their false flags and Putin has never really provided them
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:56.280]  any fuel he just ignores it and so they take that and they say oh Putin must be guilty
[02:21:56.280 --> 02:22:04.560]  he's ignoring it no Putin is just ignoring your fake news so anyway this is how they
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:13.200]  demonize Putin when all Putin's doing honestly is calling out the bad actors here and we
[02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:18.880]  know what Soros does we know Soros has involvement in the struggle with Ukraine and Russia where
[02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:23.560]  the Crimean people want to be a part of Russia but then they fund these violent protest say
[02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:27.040]  that Crimea doesn't want to be part of Russia and then people get shot and they blame Putin
[02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:31.200]  just twisting and concocting the whole thing and you know people like Soros are involved
[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:35.920]  in this who knows what Bill Browder is doing with his billions of dollars tax free but
[02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:40.840]  what do you what do you make of the hysteria that continues in the media over over Trump
[02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:46.360]  Putin over Russia I mean these people really want war with Russia Dr. Corsi well I also
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:52.520]  think there's an element here of the deep state realizing how close Donald Trump is
[02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:59.040]  to really exposing and you're showing the corruption within the deep state and shutting
[02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:06.240]  down Mueller's operation I mean Mueller's indictment here these 22 are now 12 intelligence
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:11.920]  agencies plus the other 13 individuals named in the first indictment none of them are going
[02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:17.040]  to come to the United States to face trial and what Putin has done is he's called the
[02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:24.760]  bluff he said well send your FBI or whatever to the United to Russia and you can interview
[02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:31.560]  the indicted 12 intelligence agents in Russia and then he also countered with this suit
[02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:40.840]  charging Browder with crimes in Russia and Browder appears to be protected by the former
[02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:51.080]  U.S. Ambassador to Russia this Michael Michael McFall and as I've researched Michael McFall
[02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:59.360]  Putin's got a lot of reason to be angry at him in 2012 McFall went over to Russia and
[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:06.600]  started undermining Putin he started having meetings with the various opposition to Putin
[02:24:06.600 --> 02:24:12.000]  in order to see if he could destabilize the election and let Putin lose now that's a correct
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:16.360]  that's you know Putin understands that at the heart of what he's just done with this
[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:23.160]  indictment is to expose that the United States was deeply involved in meddling in his election
[02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:29.640]  in 2012 and this McFall is at the heart of it probably involved in a criminal scheme
[02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:37.400]  with this guy Browder and maybe that involves U.S. money laundering through HSBC when James
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:44.080]  Comey was on the board of HSBC and a Robert Mueller was head of the FBI so I mean Putin
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:49.640]  is I think quite quite clever and I think he's really put on the table something is
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:53.800]  going to be take Americans a little bit of time to understand but I've been trying to
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:58.840]  explain this that it's a very brilliant move by Putin well here's here's the thing about
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:06.280]  Putin to like again there's all of these different false images of of who Putin really is you
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:10.400]  know he's this strong man dictator this that the other thing Putin honestly I mean if you
[02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:15.760]  really want to know Putin Putin is is there a 100% to protect Russia that is his number
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:21.760]  one thing he wants to maintain Russia as an independent sovereign nation and and that's
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:27.840]  really when where his his if you want to call him a dictator stops this these people don't
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:32.880]  even understand the geopolitics half of the country is going to bed when the other half
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:38.280]  is waking up so st. Petersburg is at bedtime when Moscow is getting up in the morning you
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:43.120]  think Putin is a dictator over this country that makes up 30% of the world's landmass
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:47.080]  11 different time zones they don't even have a clue what they're talking about he's just
[02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:51.640]  trying to maintain Russia as an independent sovereign nation and just keep them together
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:55.800]  that's all he cares about he doesn't care about the fake news but but Dr. Corsi why
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:26:00.280]  do you think I mean here's my take I think Bill Browder is panicking right now I'm not
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:03.800]  sure exactly why maybe Trump knows something maybe Putin knows something but this is a
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:08.920]  guy who you never saw on TV barely ever heard of now he's doing like five interviews a day
[02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:13.360]  across all television stations so why do you think Bill Browder is all of a sudden out
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:20.800]  in public crying Putin Trump bad well I see I think first of all what Putin realizes and
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:26.880]  I think Donald Trump does as well is that they are both under attack by the deep state
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:32.680]  the deep state would like to destabilize both of them on the hard left deep state is still
[02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:38.840]  angry that Russia gave up communism and they'd like to get rid of Putin and reinstate reinstate
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:44.880]  communism in Russia the same way here Donald Trump stood in the way of Hillary Clinton
[02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:50.400]  go taking the hard left Democratic Party and making us first socialists and then communists
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:56.040]  of the same move and Donald Trump and Putin are standing in the way now this indictment
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:27:04.040]  with Browder with the connection to four hundred million dollars to Hillary is a very clever
[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:09.880]  I think move that will ultimately could bring Mueller down because Mueller's been challenged
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:15.800]  if you have this if you've got a indictment against 12 Russians come over here to Russia
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:23.880]  and it will help you investigate them you know just like the original indictments with
[02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:29.400]  the I think it's like 13 Russians and three Russian entities so said they they they have
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:32.640]  legal representation show up in court and demand discovery Mueller box I mean it's the
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:36.720]  same thing Russia's like I you know we're here we'll cooperate and then Mueller walks
[02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:43.120]  away well see Mueller never intended to bring these cases to court I mean look what's happened
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:48.280]  the Russian collusion couldn't be proved so now like you know global warming it's more
[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:53.680]  it morphed into yeah I'm exactly well now we've got instead of Russian collusion we've
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:59.560]  just got Russian involvement in our election which by the way has been going on for a long
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:04.000]  time and Russia's countering and saying you were involved in my election and they even
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.880]  admit there was no impassive ambassador right no impact but see again what Donald Trump's
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:17.200]  got to say and understand the American people is that this proves there's no collusion because
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:23.960]  that whole argument is abandoned and lost in the shift to the focus on Russian involvement
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:28.720]  in the election if they prove Russian involvement in the election that does nothing to harm
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:34.040]  Donald Trump because he didn't encourage the Russian and it was it was the Obama administration
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:40.160]  that allowed it literally and they admit it I mean it's so crazy but I don't know I guess
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:45.160]  I should stop being shocked I know I live in 1984 society so I guess I should just expect
[02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:52.360]  this stuff up is down down is up war is peace and truth is fiction this is 1984 society brought

[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:30.720]  for you to choose a side you're listening to alex jones all right we've got investigative
[02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:35.160]  journalist dr. joram course he three time number one new york times bestseller waiting
[02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:38.760]  on the wings to continue his detailed analysis they've owned shroyers sitting in the cockpit
[02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:43.120]  in awesome texas but i'm here to do a breakdown on some of the developments that tie into
[02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:49.360]  all this putin is a straight shooter he's standing up for the sovereignty of russia he's taken
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:56.120]  away from the globalist trump sees kinship in putin understanding the model of taking
[02:33:56.120 --> 02:34:00.800]  his country back and then rebuilding it trump realizes that america will be ten times more
[02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:05.560]  successful than russia if we can actually get it out from under the control of the globalist
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:10.240]  and turn it back on for the american people and everything trumps done has been a hundred
[02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:16.400]  percent in line not with russia or anybody else but with doing energy deals that help
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:22.480]  america and quite frankly hurt russia and and and many other issues so the claim that
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:27.880]  trump because he's being nice to putin or or said he's been a strong leader is shelling
[02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:32.320]  out is a total fraud the globalists have sold the country out and they're the ones involved
[02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:36.080]  in mass of fake news i want to go over a few examples of this and then hand it back to
[02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:42.200]  dr. course he and the one shroyer that we saw over a month ago the last big fake scandal
[02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:48.920]  run by the u.n. and george soros but we've got a totally open our borders up and occupy
[02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:54.880]  the ice facilities and tell collapsing this whale of four million people moving north
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:59.520]  after its collapse to central america that america's open everything's free come here
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:04.400]  that is a u.n. global government plan to collapse the west period that's their plan for world
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:08.880]  government is collapsing third world countries into the first world and then we capitulate
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:15.320]  to the u.n. to manage the crisis they helped engineer and so trump and putin by the way
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:19.440]  are saying we're not going to do this we're standing up for our nation states and so they
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:24.480]  put out this fake image on a red background of a little girl crying separated from her
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:29.080]  mother with trump looking down on her trump was never at the border the little girl wasn't
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:33.640]  taken from her mother all of that came out later to be a hoax but it didn't matter they
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:39.920]  had the fake iconography the fake logo the fake imagery of trump standing with a little
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:45.880]  three-year-old crying girl well they're back again anybody can morph somebody's face into
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:53.360]  somebody else and it's a fraud on its face but intended but they show a morphed trump
[02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:59.240]  and putin at a very archetypal level men look the same humans look the same so when
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:04.600]  you morph two faces it makes you automatically think they're one you could morph my face
[02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:10.800]  with somebody and think that so now they're resorting to that look he is putin well if
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:14.840]  putin's running our economy coming back and the borders being controlled and the military
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:19.880]  being expanded and thousands of new factories being built and the lowest unemployment level
[02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:25.280]  ever recorded my god great job putin but no the truth is just like putin got partial control
[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:29.560]  of his country from the globalist and the irish economy got better years ago same things
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:36.520]  happening here and so putin as a strong nationalist has been the model for many other nation states
[02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:41.000]  around the world to struggle free from the big mega corporations and what they're doing
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:46.280]  now after two days after their Helsinki summit putin finally came out in the press conference
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:50.800]  today to RT and went off his prepared march for just two minutes the quotes are up on
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:56.680]  info wars.com and news wars.com and he said listen you've got domestic groups want political
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:37:01.240]  power trying to demonize Trump I can assure you in our meeting he's a hundred percent
[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:05.720]  about American interests and we're Russian and US interests meet in a few areas we might
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:13.120]  work together but quite frankly that's not what's happening so they want to derail Trump
[02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:16.680]  leaders are supposed to care about their national sovereignty Trump is doing that he was just
[02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:22.320]  point blank he talked to me straight up and we just agreed to try to move forward where
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:28.280]  our interests don't collide and Trump understands that you've got globalist like Soros in control
[02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:32.640]  of your country that want to run it in the ground and admit it like Bill Maher and others
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:37.440]  have said so that's the bottom line and it's it's amazing and notice they're saying don't
[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:42.640]  do it don't do the trap where we have this anti crime treaty organized crime treaty
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:48.320]  from 99 with Interpol the U.S. and Russia don't don't do that where you get to go look
[02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:54.720]  at the interview these Russian people talk to them don't because Putin wants to interview
[02:37:54.720 --> 02:38:02.280]  Mr. Bonner that Corsi Dr. Corsi was just talking about so the Russians are straight shooting
[02:38:02.280 --> 02:38:06.160]  on all this and again I want to be clear Russia is all about its interests it's mafia run
[02:38:06.160 --> 02:38:10.040]  in many cases that's better to communist run and they're trying to be free market they're
[02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:13.600]  trying to modernize because that's where the well said that they've cut their military
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:19.080]  spending China I keep hammering this because Tucker Girls is now covering it Sean Hannity
[02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:25.760]  gets it opposite personnel management hack all of this the sellout Hollywood control
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:30.800]  the chai comms even Washington Post admits the big 50 public universities have been chai
[02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:35.040]  comm infiltrated they're the ones running our lives they're the ones trying to bankrupt
[02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:38.760]  the country they're the ones at Davos here in Avago saying don't worry about Trump we'll
[02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:44.120]  work with you we're gonna stop him they are openly allied with the CFR and all these traders
[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:48.560]  they're the ones that think they can beat America Russia wants America off its back
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:53.480]  with Soros try to overthrow their country so damn right their interest are they want
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:58.040]  to get with Trump and try to have economic deals and they want to get married they want
[02:38:58.040 --> 02:39:02.560]  to give us their resources they want to get in bed with America and they control about
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:08.120]  half the borders in the world between Western Europe Eastern Europe Central Asia East Asia
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:13.800]  Far East Asia that is a no-brainer the Pentagon knows that if you're actually pro-America
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:17.920]  you go into Russia with economic development hype them up as Christians which they are
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:23.080]  ready to do launch the relaunch of the West with Russia total global domination through
[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:28.000]  free market and open ideas not through the fist with military backed up by the US and
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:33.760]  Russia China will be cut off we can make them reform it is the future if not death war the
[02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:38.080]  end of peace these are the enemies of America the enemies of humanity these are the globalists
[02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:42.040]  and Trump is absolutely right I'm just God bless you all I'm honored to be associated
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:46.640]  with all you by the doctors around Corsi I was sure another from the central Texas Command
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:53.600]  Center all right there goes Alex Jones doctor Corsi well you just heard Alex break it all
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:58.040]  down I just want to get your response to that and and and all your research that you've
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:40:02.200]  done into the deep state that you see Trump is fighting against well as usual I think
[02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:08.920]  Alex is exactly right I mean this is a clearly the United States and Russia's two nation
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:13.960]  states won't see every issue I die we have our own nation-state interests Russia has
[02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:20.040]  theirs you know Ukraine is an example within their sphere of influence you know going back
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:25.200]  to the balance of power theories of two or three hundred years ago that you know that
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:30.840]  persisted since then we're probably not going to go to war over Ukraine and Russia's probably
[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:36.240]  not going to go to war over something that happens in you know Cuba I mean that was we
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:41.840]  went through that whole issue in the 60s and we found out that basically you know the western
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:46.120]  hemisphere is going to be used US fear of influence and Russia's going to have theirs
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:53.040]  but the point is right now it is a fight to the death with the deep state for both Putin
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:59.200]  and for Trump and when they got together in their meeting privately I'm sure they exchanged
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:04.800]  notes and realized that they were each dealing with the same enemy this is why I think Putin
[02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:10.760]  has come out brilliantly and said to Mueller if you really have a case here if you really
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:15.720]  want to go to trial it was just show trial if this is all just you know you want to say
[02:41:15.720 --> 02:41:20.200]  you indicted people therefore you proved your case would say you didn't prove anything come
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:26.040]  to Russia I'll let you investigate the 12 intelligence agent and you have you and I did and you have
[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:32.400]  these just just frankly dumb you know what people say hey what what where's your evidence
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:36.960]  of Russian inclusion and they say oh there's indictments that's not evidence they don't
[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:41.760]  even understand it and I heard one of the congressmen during the hearing you know which
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:47.800]  representative Deutsch was calling for info wars to be banned from our Facebook another
[02:41:47.800 --> 02:41:54.800]  one of the Democrats said that this indictment proved that Putin stole the election proves
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:59.760]  nothing it proves that he indicted some people well okay now prove your case Mueller it's
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:04.600]  like they will say they can indict a ham sandwich and Mueller made these indictments knowing
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:09.560]  that there would never be a trial he was shocked when one of the companies in the first indictment
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:14.200]  got some lawyers and said we're going to defend the case Mueller wasn't ready to go to trial
[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:19.640]  because he never expected to go to trial there is no case here that's the there's first of
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:26.160]  all no collusion so the Democrats have now morphed it into talking about Russian interference
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:31.320]  and Rosenstein admitted the interference that the Russians have done was minimal and didn't
[02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:36.720]  defend Obama stood down Obama said stand down Dr. Corsi right of course do you have a ham
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:42.080]  sandwich in your refrigerator maybe I go and diet it well you might want to watch out because
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:45.360]  Mueller might be on his way to indict your ham sandwich so you might want to you might
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:49.120]  want to get rid of that evidence but then he'll indict you for obstruction of justice

[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:30.400]  and now your host Owen shroyer so you've probably seen or heard of the viral video
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:38.280]  Sasha Baron Cohen tries to troll a gun store owner and then Norris sweet and called him
[02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:46.760]  out caught it all on tape it's all going viral he is going to be joining us tomorrow and I'm
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:53.320]  really looking forward to interviewing him that's at 1130 central tomorrow guys I'm really
[02:47:53.320 --> 02:47:58.520]  looking forward to interviewing him because I have a take on this that I've not heard anyone else
[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:04.840]  put out there I've got a different spin or take on this that I'm not hearing anyone else
[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:13.720]  say so I'm really looking forward to talking to the owner of warrior one guns and ammo that
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:18.520]  Sasha Baron Cohen tried to troll and ended up embarrassing himself so that's going to be happening
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:27.880]  to tomorrow in the meantime here I really just want to do it news blitz so just just just look at
[02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:34.040]  how they'll do anything and everything possible to try to bring Trump down now you have New York
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:38.680]  governor Cuomo opens door to criminal case against trump foundation don't you remember
[02:48:38.680 --> 02:48:42.600]  they're already suing the trump foundation they've already tried to do x y and z to the trump
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:51.880]  foundation nothing comes it it's cleaner than the wind driven snow do and if you did a fair
[02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:56.680]  investigation into the clinton camp or into the clinton foundation they'd all be in jail it's a
[02:48:56.680 --> 02:49:03.880]  rico case there's a lawsuit happening right now so but this is just just why they're panicking here's
[02:49:03.880 --> 02:49:09.720]  another example of the the double standards on the left Iran says Trump sought meeting with
[02:49:09.720 --> 02:49:15.080]  president eight times at the UN last year now let's think about this here's president Trump
[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:20.840]  that is trying to meet with every world leader and to try to bring about fairness and peace and to
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:26.840]  understand all of the different struggles and tensions and here's Iran that just gives him the middle
[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:34.760]  thing so what does that tell you about Iran and what does that tell you about Trump but more
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:43.320]  importantly what does it tell you about the left that wants to coexist everybody get along we can
[02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:48.200]  all get along we can all coexist let's all meet let's all have peace and Trump legitimately tries
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:54.040]  to do that with one of our biggest enemies and where are they to be found on that story nowhere
[02:49:55.560 --> 02:50:03.640]  this one is like i mean you are again 1984 level ridiculous russian bots are using
[02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:09.160]  hashtag walk away to try to wound dems in midterms and then you read the story and they're claiming
[02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:16.280]  they're claiming that black people in america are leaving the democrat party because of russian
[02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:22.200]  bots so so they're saying now russian bots are tricking african americans into leaving the
[02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:29.400]  democrat party not the fact that every city run by democrats is collapsing no
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:36.040]  and so we're going to be joined by brandon strock i'm hoping next week to talk about this
[02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:40.280]  but this is even the craziest thing they're saying it's russian bots guys pull up the youtube channel
[02:50:40.280 --> 02:50:47.560]  there's a channel on youtube it's hashtag walk away fan club or something and you've got hundreds
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:52.200]  if not thousands of videos between facebook twitter and youtube you have thousands of videos
[02:50:52.200 --> 02:50:57.560]  of actual former democrats doing the hashtag walk away and filming it and explaining why
[02:50:57.560 --> 02:51:03.880]  it's just like brandon tatum a year and a half ago who kind of did the original hashtag walk away
[02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:07.160]  video i mean if you really want to get down to it i mean he didn't have the hashtag and the whole
[02:51:07.160 --> 02:51:10.920]  movement but he was like look i thought i was a democrat and then i did some research i realized
[02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:16.440]  i'm nowhere near the values of a democrat same thing happened with canis owens and so canis
[02:51:16.440 --> 02:51:20.920]  owens and brandon tatum then i guess are just russian trolls i guess all of these videos
[02:51:22.200 --> 02:51:28.280]  on the hashtag walk away fan club video of all different types of people men women all
[02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:33.480]  different races all different creeds you have thousands of these videos i guess these are all
[02:51:33.480 --> 02:51:40.200]  russian trolls no these are americans it's like i did this video last night some people think i'm
[02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:44.680]  the worst at improv some people think i'm funny regardless i was joking last night covering
[02:51:44.680 --> 02:51:53.400]  this move on protest with all these brainwashed protesters and i'm like brains brains brains
[02:51:53.400 --> 02:51:58.520]  so these are zombie protesters that want to eat brains and that's why anyone that has brains
[02:51:58.520 --> 02:52:05.080]  is walking away because they don't have their brains eat now that's hashtag walk away and cnn
[02:52:05.960 --> 02:52:11.400]  is such a disgraceful pile of garbage that they're gonna say all of these people are russian
[02:52:11.400 --> 02:52:16.440]  bots that's how out of touch with reality they are that's how big of liars they are but but more
[02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:22.440]  than anything that's how scared they are because the walk away movement is real these are people
[02:52:22.440 --> 02:52:31.560]  abandoning their plantation and so cnn is panicked right now this is from snopes fact check if the
[02:52:31.560 --> 02:52:36.120]  president is impeached for treason is everyone else removed from office as well think about this
[02:52:38.360 --> 02:52:44.440]  so so this is snopes the big fact checker it's like a house cat and a mouse
[02:52:44.440 --> 02:52:52.600]  fact checking and they just imply that the charges of treason are just already inherent
[02:52:52.600 --> 02:52:56.360]  like oh yeah it's a fact that trump could be tried with treason so what does that mean for
[02:52:56.360 --> 02:53:01.800]  everyone else in office he can't be tried for treason there's no treason they can't even explain
[02:53:01.800 --> 02:53:08.600]  the treason they don't trump is siding with russia over the us intelligence agencies that's not treason
[02:53:10.520 --> 02:53:14.120]  so these people don't even know what they're talking about if anything it's the intelligence
[02:53:14.120 --> 02:53:18.680]  agencies guilty of treason spying on us citizens illegally i mean give me a break
[02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:33.160]  brace yourselves for this one leena dunham leena dunham the ham leena ham not the good ham
[02:53:34.840 --> 02:53:40.200]  leena badham leena dumbham deletes tweet about french kissing animals

[02:54:02.520 --> 02:54:10.920]  just admit she engages in bestiality i'm just asking for a friend and so she obviously deleted
[02:54:10.920 --> 02:54:16.520]  that tweet was it drug induced was it alcohol induced was it reality induced leena dunham
[02:54:16.520 --> 02:54:20.520]  says never trust anyone who doesn't regularly french kiss animals
[02:54:22.760 --> 02:54:28.440]  is she talking about herself i wouldn't trust anyone that french kisses that animal it's like a
[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:37.000]  a beached sea porpoise or something all right look at this one from the hill

[02:59:58.840 --> 03:00:11.800]  texas commence every and the heart of the resistance and now your host owin shawyer all right rand paul is
[03:00:11.800 --> 03:00:22.760]  on fire right now just just what a patriot he is yesterday we had the clip of him being lambasted
[03:00:22.760 --> 03:00:27.720]  by cbs in the morning they just were begging for him to say trump bad he refused to say it so they
[03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:33.320]  kicked him off the show shows you how much integrity they have how much they care about the truth
[03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:38.920]  now he goes on i believe he was on cnn with wolf blitzer and he's talking about trump
[03:00:38.920 --> 03:00:44.360]  derangement syndrome right on their main platform promoting it check out rand paul the patriot
[03:00:45.560 --> 03:00:49.640]  what is lost in this is that i think there's a bit of trump derangement syndrome i think
[03:00:49.640 --> 03:00:53.960]  there are people who hate the president so much that this could have easily been president obama
[03:00:53.960 --> 03:00:59.400]  early in his first administration setting the reset button and trying to have better relations
[03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:06.200]  with russia and uh i think it's lost on people that they are a nuclear power they have influence
[03:01:06.200 --> 03:01:12.120]  in syria they're in close proximity to our troops in syria they are close to the peninsula of
[03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:16.280]  north korea and they have some influence that can help us there the other thing that's lost and
[03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:21.240]  people forget this completely the russians tried to help us stop the boston marathon bombing
[03:01:21.240 --> 03:01:26.680]  we actually did help them stop a terrorist attack in st petersburg because we were communicating
[03:01:26.680 --> 03:01:32.600]  and exchanging information all those things are good right there you know that that's so key you
[03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:39.960]  know again tamerlin sarnev was the guy who they claim was responsible for it had ties to the fbi
[03:01:39.960 --> 03:01:47.160]  and cia yet somehow they didn't know who he was he was going out of um i can't even remember the city
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:51.960]  now in western russia maybe one of the crew members can remind me but i can't remember but
[03:01:51.960 --> 03:01:56.440]  it's in western russia and he's going back and forth russia's aware of it they know he's sympathizing
[03:01:56.440 --> 03:02:02.120]  with isis so they warn our intelligence communities and then they stand down chechnya that's where he
[03:02:02.120 --> 03:02:07.080]  was so then they stand down it all happens and that's what woke me up was that story the boston
[03:02:07.080 --> 03:02:11.560]  marathon bombing showed that's what woke me up to the the deep state the lies of the mainstream
[03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:16.600]  media more than anything and i from that day on started transitioning out of sports into politics
[03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:22.280]  here i am today but it's just these are just the little facts that if people understood
[03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:28.520]  that they would just open their eyes let's go back to ran paul all of that's being lost
[03:02:29.720 --> 03:02:33.880]  it's not a matter of hating uh president trump it's a matter of what he did today
[03:02:33.880 --> 03:02:39.320]  what he said today met with a president putin as you know for more than two hours unlike other
[03:02:39.320 --> 03:02:44.440]  presidents especially on foreign soil he blamed the united states for the bad relationship yeah
[03:02:44.440 --> 03:02:49.400]  yeah yeah pause right there hey wolf blitzer where were you when there was a hot mic obama
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:57.080]  wasn't aware of it and he said oh uh i think it was with lavrov or some other uh russian officially
[03:02:57.080 --> 03:03:01.400]  says oh don't worry when i get reelected we'll have the negotiations with putin yes just wait
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:05.960]  just wait he leans over and he's all secret he's like he's like it's okay just just uh you know
[03:03:05.960 --> 03:03:10.920]  after my reelection we'll get the deals done we'll meet with putin everything no outrage
[03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:17.800]  never aired on cnn all right let's go back pain to back his own intelligence community for its
[03:03:17.800 --> 03:03:22.680]  assessment he declined to support the u.s law enforcement community including the justice
[03:03:22.680 --> 03:03:27.640]  department he continued senator he continues to call right then hold on a second he continues to
[03:03:27.640 --> 03:03:33.000]  call the news media a free press in the united states you are the enemy you're a lying scumbag
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:40.120]  wolf blitzer you're out you're a divider any other hope senator any other president in america
[03:03:40.120 --> 03:03:45.000]  history done anything like that he's like listening to ask or the grouch or something for example when
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:49.480]  you look at the intelligence community the most recent leaders of the intelligence community
[03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:55.480]  james clapper and john brennan james clapper perjured himself i'm talking about dan codd bingo i'm
[03:03:55.480 --> 03:04:00.040]  talking about dan codes the current director of national intelligence you'll let me answer
[03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:06.760]  this is just what cbs did to him yesterday i have a question wolf we can't really have
[03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:12.360]  no no i just want to be precise it's not clapper it's not brennan it's it's dan codd and mike
[03:04:12.360 --> 03:04:16.520]  pompeo you're usually better you're usually better oh my god i'm telling you folks they are pushing
[03:04:16.520 --> 03:04:21.960]  these republicans i tell you what it does matter who was in charge of the intelligence it does matter
[03:04:21.960 --> 03:04:27.000]  because they started up some of this clapper lied brennan lied brennan was a communist brennan's a
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:31.880]  wahhabist they all i mean it's it's ridiculous and so there's the powerful ran paul segment on cnn
[03:04:31.880 --> 03:04:35.560]  so they do the same thing they did to him on cbs they interrupt him they don't let him answer and
[03:04:35.560 --> 03:04:42.840]  then they kick him off these are trash these are scum they lie all day long and then they're
[03:04:42.840 --> 03:04:47.720]  going to point the finger at trump and how dare he say we're the enemy of the american people
[03:04:47.720 --> 03:04:52.200]  by the way america's racist and sexist and misogynist you should hate it what screw you

[03:06:08.840 --> 03:06:19.720]  and now your host anthony koumia yes hello everybody welcome welcome uh boy i haven't been on in a
[03:06:19.720 --> 03:06:25.000]  while it was a kind of vacation time uh over the the course of the beginning of the summer here
[03:06:26.120 --> 03:06:33.960]  so uh my schedule my schedule wasn't jibing with info wars and and alex and whatnot but uh
[03:06:33.960 --> 03:06:42.600]  uh it's not like nothing happened during the time i've been away it's uh every time i think i say this
[03:06:42.600 --> 03:06:48.600]  every time i do this program uh it just keeps getting crazier it just gets
[03:06:49.320 --> 03:06:57.480]  nuttier and nuttier as time goes on you look back you look back with uh fondness and nostalgia
[03:06:57.480 --> 03:07:03.080]  at the insanity of just a month ago you can look back go i remember when i thought that was
[03:07:03.080 --> 03:07:09.640]  complete insanity a month ago remember oh my goodness when they were saying they're they're
[03:07:09.640 --> 03:07:17.080]  ripping babies out of uh parents arms wasn't that wasn't that quaint and saying that trump was a
[03:07:17.080 --> 03:07:25.080]  terrible person and that oh so quaint because now we are really legitimately literally up to
[03:07:26.040 --> 03:07:31.320]  they want him absolutely removed from office and they are doing everything in their power
[03:07:31.320 --> 03:07:39.080]  to do it and by day we know who it is the uh liberal maniacs the democrats mainstream media
[03:07:39.640 --> 03:07:49.800]  all these uh interest groups for the left antifa and uh and the rest it's it's gotten insane
[03:07:50.840 --> 03:07:59.240]  i i read twitter every day and uh i i cannot even fathom what these people are thinking
[03:07:59.240 --> 03:08:06.280]  if it's just a motive like i would have more respect for them if they are lying through
[03:08:06.280 --> 03:08:12.840]  their teeth and just trying to get the president that they didn't vote for out of office i would i
[03:08:12.840 --> 03:08:21.080]  would have more respect for him if it's that then them being so incredibly stupid that they honestly
[03:08:21.080 --> 03:08:28.760]  believe that donald trump committed some type of treason war crimes crimes against humanity
[03:08:28.760 --> 03:08:36.200]  crimes against the state that he can be removed and quite possibly executed because if you listen
[03:08:36.200 --> 03:08:45.480]  to uh some of the the mainstream media uh liberal news programs or read um twitter you know the people
[03:08:45.480 --> 03:08:50.120]  with the blue checkmarks because a lot of people that don't have checkmarks uh have their own opinions
[03:08:50.120 --> 03:08:59.400]  but uh you're not supposed to see those because twitter um another just cesspool another cesspool
[03:08:59.400 --> 03:09:07.160]  like the rest of social media and uh mainstream media but uh you read this stuff and i really
[03:09:07.160 --> 03:09:13.480]  have to think my god could they be this stupid donald trump it let's whittle it down to the the
[03:09:13.480 --> 03:09:23.560]  simplest simplest terms here donald trump goes to Helsinki and he has a summit with uh putin
[03:09:24.840 --> 03:09:33.000]  and uh he he gets has a press conference after they they had a private meeting and he said things
[03:09:34.120 --> 03:09:42.520]  let's let's remember this he said things he did not enact any policies he did not promise anything
[03:09:42.520 --> 03:09:50.840]  he did not change a thing all he did was say things that some people did not like
[03:09:52.200 --> 03:09:59.000]  and uh that started the frenzy of just twisting this thing around into them saying
[03:09:59.720 --> 03:10:09.080]  that he had committed treason somehow there there are people that believe this there are honestly
[03:10:09.080 --> 03:10:18.680]  people that believe this and yes it is trump derangement syndrome i i knew it existed but
[03:10:18.680 --> 03:10:25.880]  to what extent and and like i said just just before is it is there this just pure motivation
[03:10:25.880 --> 03:10:32.600]  to remove the guy that they didn't vote for because they're mad like little children they're angry
[03:10:32.600 --> 03:10:40.920]  or are they really do they really believe this are they deranged because i know there are a lot
[03:10:40.920 --> 03:10:49.960]  of celebrities oh my god i can't get enough of following just insane celebrities on twitter
[03:10:49.960 --> 03:10:55.880]  and and hearing what they're saying they they really think they're they're making a difference
[03:10:55.880 --> 03:11:01.240]  out there and and putting their opinions out my favorite follows if you'd like to follow along
[03:11:01.240 --> 03:11:05.400]  if you're not blocked already because they will block you with the drop of a hat if you
[03:11:05.400 --> 03:11:14.920]  criticize their uh take on things um rob reiner is is just insane you all might remember him as
[03:11:14.920 --> 03:11:24.680]  meathead uh on on all the family back in the 70s uh he he posts tweets about about treason
[03:11:24.680 --> 03:11:32.040]  and and traitorous acts of this president and and he needs to be removed from office like
[03:11:32.760 --> 03:11:39.240]  what i and none of them can answer me none of them whether it's a celebrity or or your ordinary
[03:11:39.240 --> 03:11:44.680]  liberal joe or jane i'm not sure what i don't want to i don't want to say what gender they might be
[03:11:45.400 --> 03:11:54.200]  but but i never get an answer what first of all what is treason and what did trump do that was
[03:11:54.200 --> 03:12:02.920]  treasonous as far as i know now i'm no scholar here but i do read up on uh the the topics of
[03:12:02.920 --> 03:12:11.960]  the day uh like i said donald trump said things he wasn't pledging any allegiances he was speaking
[03:12:11.960 --> 03:12:19.400]  his his mind and his opinions on what he has seen in his position as president over the course of
[03:12:19.400 --> 03:12:28.920]  the past uh almost couple of years and uh he you cannot blame the man for not being trusting
[03:12:29.640 --> 03:12:35.240]  of the various agencies like the cia and fbi and some of the other uh justice department
[03:12:35.240 --> 03:12:43.080]  agencies you can't be trusting when all they have done since you you won the election was try and
[03:12:43.080 --> 03:12:50.920]  undermine your presidency well anthony they weren't doing that they were doing their job
[03:12:51.640 --> 03:13:00.520]  enforcing the laws no one big enough to jail well then you start seeing tweets from the
[03:13:00.520 --> 03:13:10.840]  likes of uh james comey who was indeed the head of the fbi for most of um uh most of uh trump's uh
[03:13:10.840 --> 03:13:20.360]  presidency if not all of it right didn't they toss uh mule around uh anyway so then he reads
[03:13:20.360 --> 03:13:29.240]  some of his tweets and he's like vote democrat it's so important ah trump we gotta get this guy out
[03:13:29.240 --> 03:13:34.840]  and you what do you think he just changed his mind the republican congress has proven incapable
[03:13:34.840 --> 03:13:41.080]  of fulfilling the founders design that ambition must counteract ambition all who believe in this
[03:13:41.080 --> 03:13:46.520]  country's values must vote for democrats this fall policy differences don't matter right now
[03:13:46.520 --> 03:13:56.680]  history has its eyes on us stop trying to be profound if anyone is traitorous it's uh this
[03:13:56.680 --> 03:14:05.000]  guy against his uh his president uh you know they all the sudden he becomes political all
[03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:12.840]  the sudden this this mindset of of not supporting the president came out no this has been day one
[03:14:13.800 --> 03:14:19.400]  day one they wanted this guy out he's not part of their machine and when people go they're
[03:14:19.400 --> 03:14:24.760]  republicans they were appointed by republicans they love republicans they don't matter it's not
[03:14:24.760 --> 03:14:30.120]  republican and democrat at this point it's it's people that want the best for america
[03:14:30.120 --> 03:14:38.040]  and people that want america in turmoil and and it's exactly what they're doing it's the machine
[03:14:38.040 --> 03:14:44.760]  the political machine that has been running forever in this country they don't want an
[03:14:44.760 --> 03:14:51.880]  outsider in there mucking up the works because that's what trump is doing uh to everything that they
[03:14:51.880 --> 03:14:59.480]  have put in place over the course of decades upon decades there's a system in place politicians go in
[03:15:00.360 --> 03:15:08.520]  there's a cronyism they do favors they get favors they get money uh when they're done
[03:15:09.160 --> 03:15:17.800]  they are wealthy beyond imagination public servants rich beyond imagination because they
[03:15:17.800 --> 03:15:25.080]  have screwed everyone in this country for their tenure and donald trump is pointing it out and
[03:15:25.080 --> 03:15:32.600]  that ain't good they do not like this at all so don't tell me about republicans or democrats
[03:15:33.160 --> 03:15:40.440]  because it's that machine that's been grinding away using the american people as fuel for decades
[03:15:40.440 --> 03:15:47.720]  upon decades don't go anywhere my god i'm going to tell you about the stock market and other fun
[03:15:47.720 --> 03:15:54.600]  things going on in this country uh we'll be right back info wars dot com you have been lied to
[03:15:55.240 --> 03:16:01.480]  my name is kevin ship i'm a former decorated cia officer finally someone has come out and written
[03:16:01.480 --> 03:16:06.680]  what i think is the best x mose on the shadow government ever we're in a constitutional crisis
[03:16:06.680 --> 03:16:11.560]  and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government we got to get this out

[03:21:56.760 --> 03:22:04.600]  dot com roger stone thank you anthony uh this is roger stone from the south florida bureau of info
[03:22:04.600 --> 03:22:13.240]  wars with breaking news yesterday it was reported that special counsel robert muhler would ask the
[03:22:13.240 --> 03:22:21.800]  court for immunity for five witnesses to testify against paul manifold we at info wars have
[03:22:21.800 --> 03:22:30.200]  exclusively learned that one of those five witnesses is tony podesta tony podesta is guilty
[03:22:30.200 --> 03:22:38.600]  of the same infraction as paul manifold lobbying uh on behalf of the ukrainian political party
[03:22:38.600 --> 03:22:46.120]  without lobbying it's also interesting that tony podesta was the lobbyist for the russian-owned
[03:22:46.120 --> 03:22:54.360]  energy company rostov that acquired uranium one additionally tony podesta has had a number
[03:22:54.360 --> 03:23:01.960]  of high-profile corporate russian clients of companies owned by the oligarchs around
[03:23:01.960 --> 03:23:10.200]  latimer putin so to make this very clear if you are a democrat and you break the law you are given
[03:23:10.200 --> 03:23:17.240]  immunity yet if you are a republican and you allegedly break the law paul manifold you are
[03:23:17.240 --> 03:23:26.360]  prosecuted this lays bare the completely partisan nature of the mother investigation this is roger
[03:23:26.360 --> 03:23:34.680]  stone with breaking news now back to anthony thank you roger wow look at this you know i love the
[03:23:34.680 --> 03:23:40.600]  little bits and pieces that trickle out of this investigation that just proved the hypocrisy
[03:23:41.240 --> 03:23:51.400]  that's uh going on in uh in this country uh nauseating i was watching um chapa quiddick
[03:23:51.400 --> 03:23:58.680]  the other day and uh you see you know the story ted kennedy is just about uh almost to the day it
[03:23:58.680 --> 03:24:05.480]  was was yesterday maybe the day before that uh 49 years ago ted kennedy having uh one of the one
[03:24:05.480 --> 03:24:11.400]  of their parties out there in the vineyard uh having one of their big parties uh drinking with
[03:24:11.400 --> 03:24:19.080]  some some of the secretarial staff from uh his brother bobby's campaign before well we know what
[03:24:19.080 --> 03:24:24.440]  happened there uh so he's getting those secretaries together and maybe he might be using them in the
[03:24:24.440 --> 03:24:29.880]  future for his own political runs and whatnot so having this party and mary joe kopeckney
[03:24:29.880 --> 03:24:36.040]  is one of these lovely girls that are uh there uh partying with them and at some point during the
[03:24:36.040 --> 03:24:41.960]  evening he takes a little drive with mary joe they go out have a little chit chat maybe a few
[03:24:41.960 --> 03:24:48.120]  drinks god knows what else i'm i'm not insinuating but we all know the kennedy's what uh what was
[03:24:48.120 --> 03:24:55.480]  going on apparently his wife was bedridden at the time so he's gallivanting around with uh with mary
[03:24:55.480 --> 03:25:03.880]  joe so he's a hammered he drives off the bridge a chapa quiddick car flips over underwater he
[03:25:03.880 --> 03:25:13.000]  manages to get out she doesn't uh and then from that point on this attempted cover-up happens
[03:25:13.000 --> 03:25:20.120]  now the movie shows him trying to be a good guy about it after he realizes that maybe his
[03:25:20.120 --> 03:25:25.640]  attempts at covering it up wasn't a good thing and but uh you know we we don't know the whole
[03:25:25.640 --> 03:25:33.560]  political machine was behind him trying to get him out of trouble uh robert macnamara apparently
[03:25:33.560 --> 03:25:43.160]  was in there and and a lot of other big wigs uh in washington to try to get him out of trouble
[03:25:43.160 --> 03:25:49.160]  uh but the bottom line is there was a huge cover-up to this day all the details aren't known uh there
[03:25:49.160 --> 03:25:56.040]  was um strong evidence that mary joe was not killed immediately or did not drown she ran out of oxygen
[03:25:56.040 --> 03:26:07.400]  uh in an air pocket in the car so uh again there was a lot of time to to get her out but apparently
[03:26:07.400 --> 03:26:15.400]  for some reason ted instead called a couple of his buddies got in a little boat rode back to his
[03:26:15.400 --> 03:26:22.040]  hotel which was across a small body of water and took a bath and went to sleep they woke up the
[03:26:22.040 --> 03:26:27.800]  next day and called a bunch of other people and uh finally when the cat was out of the bag he he
[03:26:27.800 --> 03:26:33.800]  started fessing up to some of this with a lot of alterations to the story let's say i'm i'm
[03:26:33.800 --> 03:26:40.120]  bringing this up because again yeah the history of it it was 49 years ago and also the fact that
[03:26:40.120 --> 03:26:52.280]  this guy went on to serve in uh the united states senate for 40 more years this guy held the office
[03:26:52.280 --> 03:26:57.640]  up there in massachusetts like a pope held that office like the pope you're not out till you're
[03:26:57.640 --> 03:27:08.440]  dead they voted him in every time he even did make a presidential run uh he he he lost in the primary
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:17.400]  but uh you know he wanted to this was a democrat who up until he died in 2009 i think it was
[03:27:18.680 --> 03:27:33.000]  um was revered iconic a someone that was looked up to by by uh democrats he killed somebody
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:40.680]  and tried to cover it up uh and and then you get the democratic party which is supposed to be the
[03:27:40.680 --> 03:27:47.080]  or not supposed to be they fancy themselves this amazing moral compass the people that are there
[03:27:47.080 --> 03:27:55.560]  to tell you what's good and evil and who's being a good guy and a bad guy yeah next month it'll be um
[03:27:55.560 --> 03:28:03.240]  um what was that 18 years 10 years nine years i have no idea it's math don't tell me about math uh
[03:28:04.200 --> 03:28:08.440]  so yeah he he's looked at and they they fancy themselves as being these
[03:28:09.400 --> 03:28:17.480]  morally superior to everybody and you know that's a prime example of that that hypocrisy
[03:28:17.480 --> 03:28:22.760]  that we were just talking about in in uh this country uh you you think you'd hide your head
[03:28:22.760 --> 03:28:28.360]  in the sand to go please don't look at me yeah you do what you want we go blow i i can't even
[03:28:28.360 --> 03:28:35.000]  mention this because we have so many skeletons in our closet no they're going where the ones that
[03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:41.480]  should be telling everybody how to live and lead their lives we know what's best for america and
[03:28:42.200 --> 03:28:48.600]  there was this their hero kind of ran away and left the girl to suffocate in a sunken car uh

[03:33:42.600 --> 03:33:51.320]  uh apparently the guy john the the originator of the company uh you've seen him on all the
[03:33:51.320 --> 03:33:58.440]  commercials papa john uh a while back because they they stopped uh letting him do commercials

[03:34:27.560 --> 03:34:36.360]  if you voice an opinion we can't allow that so um that started the rocky road of uh the founder of
[03:34:36.360 --> 03:34:43.000]  of papa john's so then they figure all right look we need some kind of a publicist some kind of a
[03:34:43.000 --> 03:34:50.280]  repair crew to come in and repair this guy's reputation he's the face of papa john's pizza
[03:34:50.280 --> 03:34:59.000]  uh the ceo he's on the board of directors uh we we can't have him uh as this bad guy so he gets on
[03:34:59.000 --> 03:35:06.040]  the phone a conference call with uh some people in his company and this uh company called uh
[03:35:06.680 --> 03:35:14.360]  what was it called laundry something laundry it was a cleaning company so they they uh get
[03:35:14.360 --> 03:35:19.160]  on the phone with him and apparently papa john decides at that point he's gonna drop an n bomb
[03:35:19.160 --> 03:35:26.360]  on the phone during this conference call i believe he was uh trying to let the people
[03:35:26.360 --> 03:35:33.880]  know that colonel sanders had used uh the n word uh referring to black people back in his day with
[03:35:33.880 --> 03:35:42.440]  kentucky fried chicken and uh never suffered any ill effects from from saying that not the best
[03:35:42.440 --> 03:35:50.360]  thing you could do there papa john but anyway so uh the stock just takes a hit takes a hit that day
[03:35:50.360 --> 03:36:01.480]  bam down a few percent so that i hit me it hit a light bulb went off in my head i thought this is
[03:36:02.200 --> 03:36:10.200]  the liberal outrage and then corporate knee jerk that we have seen time and time again
[03:36:10.200 --> 03:36:18.280]  uh uh a a ceo an employee a higher up in a company says something incredibly stupid
[03:36:19.640 --> 03:36:28.840]  the company fires them sends off that heartfelt apology and everything's back to normal everything's
[03:36:28.840 --> 03:36:33.800]  fine and dandy again so i'm like i'm not going to give you a lesson in options trading but
[03:36:33.800 --> 03:36:45.480]  what i did i bought the chance to buy papa john stock at a low price so it gave me the opportunity
[03:36:45.480 --> 03:36:53.640]  to say i'm betting that papa johns will go back up that's all it is your betting is like it's like
[03:36:53.640 --> 03:37:01.240]  uh casino wall street i'm like i'm gonna bet now even though papa johns took a dump right there
[03:37:01.240 --> 03:37:06.920]  because uh john said something stupid the mechanics are all still there they're still making pizza
[03:37:06.920 --> 03:37:15.400]  they're still delivering a lot of pizza it's amazing so i uh i i i did it i got on my little
[03:37:15.400 --> 03:37:21.560]  e-trade app and i i went online and and i bought uh options that bet that papa johns go back up
[03:37:21.560 --> 03:37:30.680]  up low and behold the next day they say well we we've gotten rid of john you'll never see him
[03:37:30.680 --> 03:37:37.720]  again he's has nothing to do with this pizza anymore and by the way we here at papa john's
[03:37:37.720 --> 03:37:46.680]  pizza want an inclusive and diverse and tolerant company that will up the same just change the
[03:37:46.680 --> 03:37:53.560]  name of the company it's the same speech the same please please we didn't do this it was that guy's
[03:37:53.560 --> 03:38:03.240]  speech well don't you know within 24 hours not even i punched out and made uh over $2,500
[03:38:04.280 --> 03:38:12.760]  in a quick less than 24 hours so i'm like this is great you can actually finally make money
[03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:23.320]  on the outrage like i figured out how to capitalize on liberal outrage slash corporate knee jerk
[03:38:24.840 --> 03:38:31.560]  so so a couple of days later i'm looking now i'm just looking for this stuff and tesla
[03:38:32.360 --> 03:38:38.760]  elon musk from tesla was mad at one of the divers from the thailand rescue the kids that
[03:38:38.760 --> 03:38:46.680]  were in the cave uh one of the divers said that elon musk's submarine he had that big thing it
[03:38:46.680 --> 03:38:52.920]  looked like a sexual pleasure device that uh he was going to put in the cave and put a kid in and
[03:38:52.920 --> 03:38:59.480]  pull the kid out and do that a few times and the divers said well this is crazy it's a publicity
[03:38:59.480 --> 03:39:07.320]  stunt it never would have worked so then uh so elon musk called him a pedo guy he goes sorry pedo guy
[03:39:07.320 --> 03:39:15.000]  you really uh did ask for it he uh was making um his accusations that the diver was a pedophila
[03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:26.200]  was a pedo a pedo uh so again tesla stock takes a die and i'm like this is just like the papa
[03:39:26.200 --> 03:39:32.360]  john's thing he's still building rockets he's still building cars nothing changed except
[03:39:32.360 --> 03:39:40.920]  someone said something stupid people got outraged knee jerk reaction it it's perfect
[03:39:42.120 --> 03:39:49.000]  so again i bought options betting that tesla stock would go up less than 24 hours later
[03:39:49.720 --> 03:39:57.320]  i'm cashing out again and there we go i made another three thousand dollars on that one
[03:39:57.320 --> 03:40:08.120]  i tell you this is the greatest strategy ever in the stock market i am literally making money on
[03:40:08.120 --> 03:40:16.440]  liberal outrage i get so annoyed by it on twitter mainstream media everything i'm like god i can't
[03:40:16.440 --> 03:40:22.600]  stand this they're constantly bitching and complaining about everything and then on that
[03:40:22.600 --> 03:40:30.600]  that day uh last week with papa john's it hit me and i gotta tell you all i do now is paw through
[03:40:31.240 --> 03:40:37.080]  the business news looking for someone that said something stupid and looking for the company
[03:40:37.080 --> 03:40:44.200]  that has to just make the biggest deal of it and you watch that stock go down and the very next day
[03:40:44.200 --> 03:40:53.480]  when they do damage control right back up again so liberal outrage is able to be monetized
[03:40:54.680 --> 03:41:02.440]  so uh i'm actually thinking about maybe sending some uh minorities out with tape recorders to
[03:41:02.440 --> 03:41:09.320]  corporate executives to get them to say something terrible to them can i do that is that insider
[03:41:09.320 --> 03:41:14.920]  trading or something i hope not no obviously a joke i would never never do anything like that
[03:41:14.920 --> 03:41:20.120]  because quite frankly it just happens enough that i don't even have to spur anything on
[03:41:20.120 --> 03:41:27.400]  i just have to keep my eyes open and look for right look for that guy look for someone who's
[03:41:27.400 --> 03:41:37.960]  outraged actually i um i had my eye on texas instruments the ceo of texas instruments just got
[03:41:37.960 --> 03:41:48.760]  fired and uh it was very suspicious what did they call it personal conduct unbecoming to the company
[03:41:48.760 --> 03:41:55.320]  so they had to get rid of them but until we know what it was we can't be outraged so i hope they're
[03:41:55.320 --> 03:42:02.920]  not going to start using this strategy is to not let us know what uh this guy did because i need to
[03:42:02.920 --> 03:42:11.960]  know we need him to to say something where a group gets outraged there it is uh texas instruments
[03:42:11.960 --> 03:42:20.120]  loses job for personal misconduct now that could be sexual harassment could be a racist slur it
[03:42:20.120 --> 03:42:28.040]  could be some type of homophobic thing uh maybe even just having a liaison with an employee i don't
[03:42:28.040 --> 03:42:33.560]  know but the whole way this works is if you actually know what happened borders it happened
[03:42:33.560 --> 03:42:39.720]  to the the border ceo too he got the boot and they didn't really say what it was so uh i need i
[03:42:39.720 --> 03:42:44.760]  need information on those things so i can make money off of outrage we'll be right back don't
[03:42:44.760 --> 03:42:56.280]  go anywhere anthony comey in at info wars dot com anyone who's studied history and knows how human

[03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:12.920]  hollywood ba da da da da hollywood these people are all effing insane they got no brain it's
[03:49:12.920 --> 03:49:19.960]  whatever it is they there's something going on in hollywood that prevents these people from having
[03:49:19.960 --> 03:49:29.960]  a single rational thought they have no uh ability to reason to figure things out they live in a bubble
[03:49:29.960 --> 03:49:35.320]  pretty much i was having a conversation on my program the other day um on compound media
[03:49:35.320 --> 03:49:42.280]  anthony kumia show but i was having a conversation the other day about how the fame this fame that
[03:49:42.280 --> 03:49:54.440]  they get in hollywood is detrimental to uh your social skills i would gather people talk about
[03:49:54.440 --> 03:50:01.160]  being rich and famous all right uh do do they deserve do hollywood celebrities deserve that
[03:50:01.160 --> 03:50:07.560]  much money for what they're doing it doesn't seem like a hard work i've done roofing that's pretty
[03:50:07.560 --> 03:50:14.760]  hard i've installed air conditioning and heating uh mechanics on a rooftop pretty tough work acting
[03:50:14.760 --> 03:50:18.840]  i don't know doesn't seem that hard a lot of it seems like you're sitting around for most of the
[03:50:18.840 --> 03:50:26.520]  time while everyone else is working but uh i think the the financial compensation is because
[03:50:26.520 --> 03:50:33.560]  they know people are going to clamor around you no matter what you do so i think you're literally
[03:50:33.560 --> 03:50:39.240]  being compensated for the fact that you can't do anything do you think tom cruise could go to the mall
[03:50:39.880 --> 03:50:46.200]  and just hang out or go to a movie someone at that level of fame and a lot of the people that
[03:50:46.200 --> 03:50:51.720]  have the most to say on twitter about you know how we should lead our lives are leading that kind of
[03:50:51.720 --> 03:51:01.720]  life they are unable to go out and live a life like 99.99% of the rest of the country so that
[03:51:01.720 --> 03:51:08.920]  compensation i think is to say here build yourself a fortress of solitude away from everyone else
[03:51:08.920 --> 03:51:15.080]  live in a bubble you could visit other people that have their fortresses and have to live like this
[03:51:15.080 --> 03:51:21.720]  because they can't go out but then they think ah i i have this life i have this money i have this
[03:51:21.720 --> 03:51:29.960]  fame i have the inability to go out and stuff but you know i still have something to say oh god what
[03:51:29.960 --> 03:51:37.640]  are you doing no you don't enjoy your pool enjoy your company enjoy your drugs and your booze and
[03:51:37.640 --> 03:51:44.920]  whatever else you guys are doing out there your kinky sex and have uh and have fun but they can't
[03:51:44.920 --> 03:51:51.720]  they gotta say stuff and they gotta express themselves in this this uh childlike way and for
[03:51:51.720 --> 03:51:58.360]  that i gotta bring up uh of course rosio donnell and uh jim carrey look at this people don't live
[03:51:58.360 --> 03:52:07.720]  like that people aren't whisked away into a waiting suv by bodyguards that would literally kill for you
[03:52:07.720 --> 03:52:15.240]  or be killed for you while while people uh take photos and it just doesn't happen you cannot
[03:52:16.120 --> 03:52:25.480]  conjure up reasonable assessments of life around you if that's your life you got nothing to say
[03:52:25.480 --> 03:52:33.560]  hey you can't do it i'm on the long island railroad every day people i'm amongst the common man
[03:52:34.360 --> 03:52:39.400]  look at that how the oh yeah that happened to me when i was just walking out of the bathroom
[03:52:39.960 --> 03:52:45.640]  i was just uh walking out of the bathroom i just got uh blindsided by by a bunch of people
[03:52:46.360 --> 03:52:52.680]  but uh you get the likes of uh yeah rosio donnell one of my favorite follows be careful
[03:52:52.680 --> 03:52:59.320]  if you follow rosio donnell you will be tempted to tweet horrible things about her and it's so
[03:52:59.320 --> 03:53:04.840]  easy to come up with them but she will block you and then you will miss the fund and hijinks that
[03:53:04.840 --> 03:53:12.440]  is rosio donnell's twitter account um she has taken to painting we've touched on it a few times before
[03:53:12.440 --> 03:53:20.120]  on this program but she has taken to painting as an outlet to her trump derangement syndrome that
[03:53:20.120 --> 03:53:26.440]  so many have gotten and uh she's terrible i mean honestly if she's going to put her paintings out
[03:53:26.440 --> 03:53:32.120]  there uh they're awful and all i can do is picture her getting like watching the news
[03:53:32.680 --> 03:53:41.160]  oh trump Mcportons trump Mcportons giving away the whole country where are my paints
[03:53:41.160 --> 03:53:51.000]  where are my paints and then you just get some some mental institution attendant rosie do you
