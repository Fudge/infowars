[04:08.840 --> 04:15.360]  like that and the reason I talk so much about this is it's the key to everything if the public
[04:15.360 --> 04:20.320]  can understand this if the police can understand this if we if I can articulate it we can wrap

[08:29.240 --> 08:47.080]  we've got this headline out today out of the times of israel netanyahu spat in our face
[08:47.080 --> 08:53.360]  white house official says and it just goes into how horrible benjamin netanyahu is according
[08:53.360 --> 08:59.560]  to the white house and there's all these moves in israel to basically indict netanyahu right
[08:59.560 --> 09:05.920]  now whether you love benjamin netanyahu or hating there's major political realignment
[09:05.920 --> 09:12.240]  happening all over the world so there are some power structure shifts beneath the surface
[09:12.240 --> 09:20.160]  but the last few years this tiff between israel and the lakudniks and the united states is
[09:20.160 --> 09:27.440]  total fantasy land now there are battles over who runs things that's always going on power
[09:27.440 --> 09:33.520]  struggles but the overall agenda to turn radical islamists is loose all of the middle east
[09:33.520 --> 09:40.840]  to destabilize the region is bipartisan republican and democrat it's bipartisan in israel between
[09:40.840 --> 09:50.000]  the lakudniks and labor and others in the khanesit and shawty arabian israel are in
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.320]  a lip lock and israel in the golon heights has been backing the syrian free syrian army
[09:56.320 --> 10:01.760]  for the last three four years so israel's involved in all of this and it's just a fact
[10:01.760 --> 10:05.560]  and it's not a defensive israel it's not an attack of israel everybody's got this hot
[10:05.560 --> 10:11.520]  button issue of one side or the other i'm saying it's immoral and evil for turkey for
[10:11.520 --> 10:16.440]  saudi arabia for the united states for france for england for germany for nato for inner
[10:16.440 --> 10:25.760]  poll for the pentagon to be supporting the syrian rebels who have been and are 95 percent
[10:25.760 --> 10:33.280]  al qaeda no matter what name they give it to confuse the public and even the iraqi government
[10:33.280 --> 10:38.280]  has caught the u.s dropping air shipments of weapons to al qaeda hundreds of times and
[10:38.280 --> 10:42.480]  they keep saying it's an accident no it's not an accident and the military knows that
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.000]  since they refused to go to the air bases and give them the weapons they're ordered to
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.280]  just air drop it coordinates now and i'm getting that back from sources as well you've heard
[10:51.280 --> 10:56.840]  some of them here on air that our current cia pilots flying weapons you ask how on earth
[10:56.840 --> 11:00.480]  could they come on air because there's white hat black hat and the white hats are protected
[11:00.480 --> 11:06.960]  to a certain extent the matash plumberly and others still flying weapons today to the middle
[11:06.960 --> 11:12.400]  east he's interviewed us twice when he's on the tarmac about to lead a whole group of
[11:12.400 --> 11:19.800]  c 130's from texas to the middle east loaded with weapons these are the interviews from
[11:19.800 --> 11:26.920]  the cockpit and you've seen all these generals and people come out and say they don't want
[11:26.920 --> 11:32.200]  to back al qaeda you saw dimsey three months ago say that in a congressional arm services
[11:32.200 --> 11:37.600]  senate committee hearing we played the clip probably ten times lizzie graham people are
[11:37.600 --> 11:41.480]  saying we're not involved al qaeda right right none of our allies are and he goes yeah of
[11:41.480 --> 11:46.440]  course they are they're all back in them and dimsey's just actually turns his hands up
[11:46.440 --> 11:51.080]  and goes with the international gesture of like why are you feeding this bull i'm not
[11:51.080 --> 11:57.120]  going to sit here and lie under oath for you graham and graham looks scared because let
[11:57.120 --> 12:01.560]  me tell you this is a real come to jesus moment that's been going on for two years in the
[12:01.560 --> 12:06.800]  u.s. military because they know we're back in the worst the worst over there and they
[12:06.800 --> 12:11.320]  don't sleep good at night thinking about that they've done a lot of really hardcore stuff
[12:11.320 --> 12:17.120]  in their careers and they don't like doing something purely openly evil where there's
[12:17.120 --> 12:24.520]  no debating it's bad for all this macky of ellie and mumbo jumbo about in justifies
[12:24.520 --> 12:29.680]  the means really the end is to remove a sod and a government that was democratizing where
[12:29.680 --> 12:34.120]  women can go to college and where christians and jews could live in peace to turn it over
[12:34.120 --> 12:39.800]  to a bunch of people to kill hundreds of thousands and blow up every church they find and chop
[12:39.800 --> 12:49.000]  catholic priest heads off on television and eat hearts there is no debating it be one thing
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.320]  if they use evil groups to overthrow somebody evil and then took them out that'd be bad
[12:52.320 --> 12:57.360]  enough because anytime you use evil to fight evil you turn out getting something worse
[12:57.360 --> 13:02.200]  than the end that's just the metaphysical law ladies and gentlemen i use the allegory
[13:02.200 --> 13:08.840]  of the ring of mordor the ring of power one ring to rule them all and in the darkness
[13:08.840 --> 13:17.920]  bind them but all of them were deceived for in the darkness of mount doom one ring was
[13:17.920 --> 13:28.440]  forged and in it his hatred and malice was placed one ring to find them one ring to rule
[13:28.440 --> 13:35.400]  them all one ring in the darkness bind them and by the way that is what the internet was
[13:35.400 --> 13:43.480]  designed to do that's why it was rolled out it is the thing of internet's it is the thing
[13:43.480 --> 13:50.360]  of the internet not trying to channel George W. Bush or rick perry start calling it tweeters
[13:50.360 --> 13:56.920]  it is the smart dust it is the RFIDs it is the grid that will interface and surveil everything
[13:56.920 --> 14:02.440]  and then predict the future and then control the future in google's own words from 14 years
[14:02.440 --> 14:11.960]  ago at publicly declassified DARPA meetings you can pull this up just type in google plan
[14:11.960 --> 14:22.080]  to create AI google's master plan was to create AI that could see the future google is a governmental
[14:22.080 --> 14:28.840]  corporate merger strategy system i saw the cover of the chronicle this week and it was
[14:28.840 --> 14:34.840]  like can google save austin and bridge the gap and bring us internet we need oh save us
[14:36.120 --> 14:42.040]  there it is wired magazine google's grand plan to make your brain irrelevant it is already
[14:42.040 --> 14:47.880]  artificially intelligent in 2014 they admitted they'd already achieved it for all his purposes
[14:47.880 --> 14:53.960]  it interfaces with you creating a giant brain with all of the billions of synapses that are
[14:53.960 --> 15:00.040]  represented by billions of people interfacing with their hopes their dreams their subconscious
[15:00.040 --> 15:11.640]  algorithms and archetypes are then manifest in giant three-dimensional models
[15:11.640 --> 15:25.720]  huge royshire patterns that can then be used to predict the future 100 percent in human activity
[15:26.600 --> 15:30.760]  you can't predict the future with asteroids and comets and earthquakes but they're getting
[15:30.760 --> 15:36.760]  better and better with computers the three breakthroughs they have finally unleashed AI
[15:36.760 --> 15:46.520]  on the world 10 27 14 wired magazine yet again and it goes back in the article to the beginning
[15:46.520 --> 15:54.200]  of google back in 1999 saying we're not building a search engine because they had big investors
[15:54.200 --> 15:58.200]  saying we who do you know the search they said we're building an AI that will control everything
[15:58.200 --> 16:09.560]  and they're doing it i was not the only avid user on its search site who thought it would not last
[16:09.560 --> 16:16.840]  long but page reply had always struck me and stuck with me oh we're really making an AI
[16:17.960 --> 16:20.520]  and they go into the AI takeover grid
[16:20.520 --> 16:25.880]  but before this information was even public
[16:30.360 --> 16:34.920]  i was aware of mathematical equations from the 30s that isaac azimuth picked up on and
[16:34.920 --> 16:39.640]  then wrote the foundation series out of so he didn't really invent the idea he invented the
[16:39.640 --> 16:51.160]  term robot but he didn't invent the idea of mathematics to predict the future
[16:51.160 --> 16:57.720]  and they're now doing it and they could now game basically everything do we have free will
[16:57.720 --> 17:04.360]  will we unhook ourselves from the iphone's the ipads the droids the tv the espn or is it really
[17:04.360 --> 17:09.960]  over are we going to give up on our consciousness are we going to let the establishment direct
[17:09.960 --> 17:15.560]  human development because here's the deal the human development they're directing us into
[17:16.200 --> 17:22.440]  is the end of humanity as we know it and they've convinced people in their decadence not to care
[17:22.440 --> 17:27.000]  to think it's cute and funny even those that are awake now many of them will say okay you're right
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.920]  about all this but so what i'm just going to have a good time but then those are incredibly empty
[17:32.920 --> 17:42.280]  and unhappy people when you get down to the bottom line you're not meant to be like a person in a
[17:42.280 --> 17:48.520]  digital cage who all the stimulus is fed to you and then you don't experience true reality
[17:49.160 --> 17:55.960]  or spirituality you end up experiencing the false universe fed to you by the control grid
[17:55.960 --> 18:01.320]  it here is google's schmitt
[18:04.680 --> 18:11.240]  in the hollywood reporter google chairman eric schmitt at devos the internet will disappear
[18:11.240 --> 18:16.760]  he also discussed online dominance of the world economic forum panel facebook
[18:17.960 --> 18:23.320]  c o o o sheryl sandberg and while yahoo ceo is asked about privacy issues
[18:23.320 --> 18:30.600]  at the end of the panel in world economic forum in devos switzerland where his comments were webcast
[18:30.600 --> 18:35.240]  he was asked if his prediction on the future of the web i will answer very simply the internet
[18:35.240 --> 18:41.400]  will disappear schmitt said there will be so many ip so many devices sensors things that you're wearing
[18:41.400 --> 18:45.560]  things that you are interacting with that you won't even sense it he explained it will be part of
[18:45.560 --> 18:51.640]  your presence all the time see it's a cloak a matrix imagine you walk into a room and the room
[18:51.640 --> 18:57.320]  is dynamic and with your permission and all of that you are interacting with the things going on
[18:57.320 --> 19:03.640]  the room no it's not with the permission google's been caught for at least 10 years driving around

[25:05.640 --> 25:09.400]  myself but i support the free speech but see i don't support it because

[25:47.080 --> 25:51.080]  a specific time and place who to burn it would be illegal but the way they're ruling is they're
[25:51.080 --> 25:56.840]  saying no it was hateful so it's illegal and what a major french lgbt rights group called
[25:56.840 --> 26:00.600]  a significant victory three people were convicted in paris court this week after they can
[26:01.560 --> 26:04.200]  accompany tweets with the hashtag let's burn the gaze
[26:04.200 --> 26:10.920]  during uh they're probably latent homosexuals uh that put that out uh during the same period
[26:11.480 --> 26:17.640]  in august 2013 and i'm being sarcastic but statistically folks that are obsessed with it
[26:17.640 --> 26:24.760]  are probably you know i mean everybody knows that who's got a brain uh french lgbt charity
[26:25.320 --> 26:29.160]  committee idaho which organizes the nation's international day
[26:29.160 --> 26:34.760]  it's homophobia see that that's a bunch of bull calling it a mental illness that's soviet tyranny
[26:34.760 --> 26:41.960]  if you don't like the whole liberal socialist gay agenda being pushed on you and don't accept
[26:41.960 --> 26:48.440]  them brainwashing your kids you're a homophobe no that's called having a
[26:50.920 --> 26:52.040]  preference in your life
[26:52.040 --> 27:01.480]  but there you go very dangerous trend ladies and gentlemen you know they tried to ban in
[27:01.480 --> 27:09.480]  france will have been in france a nazi memorabilia being sold on ebay most people that buy nazi
[27:09.480 --> 27:13.400]  memorabilia are not nazis in fact i've been at gun shows before and bought
[27:13.400 --> 27:23.160]  you know a german knife one time from world war two uh i've got a uh colt 9 11 from world war
[27:23.160 --> 27:32.200]  two and i've got a uh german luger from world war two and it's not because i'm a nazi it's
[27:32.200 --> 27:37.880]  really an interesting gun and uh everyone understands this and when you go to the museum
[27:37.880 --> 27:43.240]  at the smithsonian and they got a whole area of nazi stuff where you go to the pacific war museum
[27:43.880 --> 27:48.520]  it's excellent by the way in fredersburg texas as good as the smithsonian in many ways just the
[27:48.520 --> 27:55.320]  middle of nowhere it's full of nazi stuff and japanese stuff doesn't mean they support i mean
[27:55.320 --> 28:00.680]  everyone knows this but this is political correctness it's just like the black woman that ran the
[28:00.680 --> 28:05.800]  restaurant at the casino read a book about martin Luther king and his favorite foods
[28:05.800 --> 28:10.920]  so she cooked southern food they call soul food because black folks eat southern food
[28:11.480 --> 28:18.120]  there are big influence on southern food a lot of it is dishes that poor people would eat blacks
[28:18.120 --> 28:24.200]  would eat black eyed peas and collard greens and stuff because it was seen as what poor people ate
[28:24.200 --> 28:27.240]  and they made a delicacy out of it so you haven't know the whole history of it ladies and gentlemen
[28:27.240 --> 28:32.600]  i love black eyed peas i love collard greens i love fried chicken because it tastes good
[28:32.600 --> 28:39.080]  but i'm already digressing this is the mindlessness a black lady can't cook collard greens because
[28:39.080 --> 28:45.800]  black folks like it what i can't cook mexican food because it's mexican see this is the mental
[28:45.800 --> 28:50.200]  illness while the real discrimination by the globalist is happening against all of us having
[28:50.200 --> 28:56.280]  our money devalued our environment poisoned our kids turned against us this this huge positronic

[34:31.960 --> 34:39.320]  yemen chaos as the president fleas saudi king's death poses new challenges for the us major
[34:39.320 --> 34:47.320]  controversy especially in the uk over half mast for the saudi king i mean the saudi king
[34:47.320 --> 34:58.040]  his father was put into power by the british in 1903 by 1931 they taken over most of middle east
[34:58.040 --> 35:02.840]  it was one better one group that they gave rockets and hand grenades and stuff too and machine guns
[35:03.560 --> 35:10.040]  and they just took over they ended up taking over syria as well uh they are just absolute
[35:10.040 --> 35:15.880]  fun with the mouth demons and a lot of the women and people that get kidnapped in this country get
[35:15.880 --> 35:23.240]  flown over there i mean it is barren harkin and level craziness makes north korean seven-story
[35:23.240 --> 35:31.480]  pleasure palaces pale and of course the degenerate pedophile filled monarchy is endorsing these
[35:31.480 --> 35:39.240]  degenerates they are puppets of the british monarchy and the british monarchy is not british
[35:39.240 --> 35:49.880]  royalty you haven't had a house there that was actually from those aisles since william the
[35:49.880 --> 35:59.480]  conqueror took over in 1100 and change they overtook the saxons and of course we're talking about
[35:59.480 --> 36:06.600]  the norman a germanic group of viking german french and then you expand out from that it's not
[36:06.600 --> 36:12.600]  even german royal today it's a transylvanian germanic bloodline that runs it and they are
[36:12.600 --> 36:19.320]  the scum of the earth and they lobby for carbon taxes global government it is their plan we're
[36:19.320 --> 36:26.520]  living under with the robot takeover and i guess in their words you know the they deserve to be
[36:26.520 --> 36:31.640]  in control and i guess they kind of do from a survival of the fittest social darwinistic view
[36:31.640 --> 36:39.720]  because they are the ones that financed the scientist 170 years ago i don't know 1850 or so
[36:40.600 --> 36:46.520]  plan was public in 1855 you know i harp on this a lot because if people don't know that this is
[36:46.520 --> 36:54.600]  all planned out and when you know there's a world government scientific takeover planned out it took
[36:54.600 --> 36:59.800]  them a hundred and something years to get it pretty much in place we're now in the last few minutes
[36:59.800 --> 37:10.600]  of the ball game here in the next few decades and god help us if i was a self-centered person
[37:13.640 --> 37:17.720]  i would just get out of here and move to the safest third world country i could
[37:17.720 --> 37:21.960]  keep my head down and then just constantly move and try to get away from the technology
[37:23.320 --> 37:28.280]  because it's not the technology itself's evil it's that all of it is being deployed and rolled out
[37:28.280 --> 37:33.640]  where you pay for it and has one function you think you've got it for but really it's a total control
[37:33.640 --> 37:39.880]  mechanism like whether you ask for it or not now the new iphone's and droids have systems that
[37:39.880 --> 37:43.960]  monitor your breath your heart rate everywhere you go what you do people think it's so neat they
[37:43.960 --> 37:48.760]  go look it knows everything i did yeah it's a it's a government surveillance imperial probe dried
[37:49.320 --> 37:57.000]  in their words you think smart meters are bad i mean do you understand folks this is not my opinion
[37:57.000 --> 38:05.480]  i mean i've got more and more interesting news than i could ever cover and this be a riveting radio
[38:05.480 --> 38:12.280]  show you know the kind of uh science fiction porn fear porn apocalypse porn that we get called by
[38:12.280 --> 38:19.240]  the news yes we are that but not to get ratings to try to stop what's happening because it is going
[38:19.240 --> 38:26.760]  on if you want to call fear porn fear porn fine it's reality porn it's truth is stranger
[38:26.760 --> 38:32.600]  than fiction porn and let me tell you it's very inviting to go plug into the matrix and play along
[38:32.600 --> 38:37.560]  with the system because if there's another route not run from it but throw myself at the feet of
[38:37.560 --> 38:43.320]  the establishment try to join them try to spin everything that's happening and then work for
[38:43.320 --> 38:50.200]  a position in the technocracy but i don't want to interface with these machines and it's a fraud
[38:50.200 --> 38:55.800]  i'm not going to live forever i'm going to lose my soul it's all a giant cosmic con game everything
[38:55.800 --> 39:01.560]  the new world order does produces death on the other end it's a big scam i don't want red carpets
[39:01.560 --> 39:06.920]  i don't want big jets i don't want to have everybody kiss my butt i want to be left alone
[39:06.920 --> 39:13.800]  but the new world order won't leave me alone and i'll be overrun by the giant mass of dumb
[39:13.800 --> 39:17.880]  down people if i don't try to reach out to folks i can't just give up on humanity
[39:17.880 --> 39:25.160]  and i see people sell out to them all the time that's why i can't even watch they live
[39:26.120 --> 39:30.680]  that's an allegory of what's going on when they're down there in the subterranean base and
[39:30.680 --> 39:36.680]  the aliens are in their suits with everybody else and they're getting everybody to sell out to
[39:36.680 --> 39:47.320]  them bragging about how great they're doing god oh my this is so so real it's so real
[39:51.400 --> 39:57.160]  you know i don't even want to get into this police stuff i because i understand the whole thing
[39:57.160 --> 40:05.080]  and it's so hard to articulate because it's so complex and so subtle from both perspectives
[40:07.560 --> 40:08.520]  but i'm going to do it
[40:12.280 --> 40:19.080]  i'm going to break it down as best i can but let me just do this let me just do this i will
[40:19.080 --> 40:28.760]  cover it at eight after next hour and i'll play these clips i'll go to your calls right now
[40:30.040 --> 40:35.480]  and i'll get into saudi arabian king dying and all the rest of it i was watching
[40:38.280 --> 40:41.880]  seeing an end this morning to monitor their transmissions
[40:41.880 --> 40:49.160]  and you would have thought that jesus himself had just died with the king dying
[40:51.400 --> 40:56.600]  and the saudi royalty is just about as bad as it gets
[41:00.680 --> 41:05.160]  and it shows how our cia it's not our cia it's the robber barons cia
[41:05.160 --> 41:12.440]  works to put dictatorships and oppressive regimes in worldwide so of course they're working to do
[41:12.440 --> 41:18.600]  that here and all they need now with the with the militarized police in place is to start a war
[41:18.600 --> 41:25.480]  with the police they've just got to find an ignorant enough group to do it to seal the deal
[41:25.480 --> 41:30.760]  and get the civil war going and the reason i harp on that is that's their whole ballgame
[41:30.760 --> 41:38.440]  domestically just like it's their ballgame in other countries ukraine yemen syria libya
[41:39.400 --> 41:45.480]  angola the congo indonesia
[41:48.280 --> 41:49.000]  everywhere else
[41:52.120 --> 41:55.800]  it's just frustrating knowing how right i am having the whole battle plan
[41:55.800 --> 42:03.160]  and then it's it's all public is what's frustrating and i can't find many government people
[42:04.360 --> 42:07.080]  or many intellectual scientists phd's
[42:09.800 --> 42:14.520]  that even have close to grasp i have you know how scary that is because i'm not on a power
[42:14.520 --> 42:20.280]  trip i don't think of myself as that's smart and then i do talk to medical doctors scientists
[42:20.280 --> 42:25.720]  genetic engineers and people and they go yes we know it's very sad that's why we've moved to
[42:25.720 --> 42:30.280]  the country and just want to try to raise our children and hope we can have some life before
[42:30.280 --> 42:34.280]  the overwrite comes i can't tell you how many times i've been
[42:36.840 --> 42:42.520]  invited to some cookout or to some mansion you know out in the hill country and and and you know
[42:42.520 --> 42:49.960]  you're looking at people's uh diplomas on the walls nobody else at the party is and
[42:49.960 --> 42:56.040]  you strike up a conversation with somebody and then they go oh yes i've i've know your show i don't
[42:56.040 --> 43:01.000]  really tune in because i separately learned about this when i was a graduate student at MIT and
[43:01.800 --> 43:06.680]  and you know my wife and i and the children we're just here you know waiting and oh these are some
[43:06.680 --> 43:11.400]  of our friends that they're they understand as well and you're just like so you're just not even
[43:11.400 --> 43:15.880]  going to fight it you're just going to go run off to the countryside and just wait for this to come
[43:15.880 --> 43:21.400]  i mean it's just it's crazy or you got the eric schmitz running around giggling with bill joy and
[43:21.400 --> 43:25.320]  all the other elites going yeah everybody's going to be exterminated we're all government
[43:25.320 --> 43:29.080]  yeah micro mosquitoes are going to suck your blood bill gates is coming out with those
[43:29.080 --> 43:35.720]  force inoculations it's all being announced schmitt comes out announces brain chips then
[43:35.720 --> 43:44.440]  you know we need a graphic or somebody out there a cartoonist to show 1947 the television
[43:44.440 --> 43:48.600]  and and no longer are people around the table eating dinner now they're sitting there looking at
[43:48.600 --> 43:53.800]  the television it's now the father figure it now gives all the orders and so daddy's comfortable
[43:53.800 --> 43:59.640]  with it the first messages are pretty much in line with daddy so daddy says this is good
[43:59.640 --> 44:05.320]  this is good this is good food this is good water lines up everybody to do what it says
[44:05.960 --> 44:09.560]  a couple years later it changed a little bit daddy doesn't like that but he's got shows he likes
[44:09.560 --> 44:15.160]  mama's got shows she likes junior and little little little betty they've all got shows they like
[44:15.160 --> 44:22.840]  see it's all compartmentalized now the programming all wargamed out on record and then you go from
[44:22.840 --> 44:31.480]  television to the flat screens and the computers and the handhelds to the glasses to the contacts
[44:31.480 --> 44:41.160]  to the implants and you can see the television evolve towards from the protomatrix to the matrix
[44:43.720 --> 44:47.800]  and then you discover back in the 70s the national federation of scientists
[44:48.920 --> 44:55.080]  the international federation all wrote about this the plan the pentagon how will finally if
[44:55.080 --> 45:02.920]  they allow us to even live we will be from birth to death in virtual reality sensory deprivation
[45:02.920 --> 45:10.280]  tanks with wires and chips in our brains and our heat will be used to power things oh the matrix
[45:10.280 --> 45:15.720]  and you find out that's their plan if they even decide to use us is to put us in tanks
[45:16.760 --> 45:19.640]  don't look it up it's in my book that's sent into tyranny it's online
[45:19.640 --> 45:25.960]  you can go pull up all that stuff i mean i just cannot believe it
[45:27.400 --> 45:34.280]  and people will opt to be movie stars in the fantasy world and to be put into the tanks
[45:35.080 --> 45:41.480]  and at first just like they they condition you you'll have a simulation body that'll be bio
[45:41.480 --> 45:46.920]  mechanical that you'll still be able to run around the real world but pretty soon folks will just hang
[45:46.920 --> 45:52.760]  those up like an old pair of roller skates and you'll just live in the tank they made a bruce willis
[45:52.760 --> 46:04.600]  movie about that god they just throw it all in our face all right i'm gonna go to john and uh
[46:04.600 --> 46:11.960]  matt and frank and stefan and kevin everybody else here uh you know i don't know what i'm supposed
[46:11.960 --> 46:17.800]  to do okay uh it's all true it's all happening uh the government runs al-qaeda they're putting
[46:17.800 --> 46:22.280]  cancer viruses in your vaccines fluoride in your water to brain damage your Harvard studies and then
[46:22.280 --> 46:27.320]  i've got all their admissions where they you know write about all these countless books like eco science
[46:27.320 --> 46:31.320]  and others why they're doing it so you're more manageable i mean they're just murdered our brains
[46:31.320 --> 46:37.720]  already so just whatever turn the world over to pure evil great because all these evil technocrats
[46:37.720 --> 46:45.000]  have little beards and are real skinny and talk real soft oh hi i'm i'm paul earlickman i'm john p
[46:45.000 --> 46:52.120]  holdren oh hi i'm bill gates oh hi you know if we didn't give an old lady health care we could hire
[46:52.120 --> 46:59.960]  10 teachers but that's a death panel hey hey this is this is my this is my disciplined act to make
[46:59.960 --> 47:10.360]  you not understand i am a super mega alpha male psychopath hardcore aggressive i work about 16 hours

[47:23.400 --> 47:33.080]  funny it's all real mpr hi we're not a threat here's a smart meter here's a phone for your kid
[47:33.080 --> 47:38.440]  here's a shot she don't get sick we really love you okay
[47:41.080 --> 47:44.760]  well in truth if you could hear them it wouldn't even be intelligible their souls
[47:44.760 --> 47:51.000]  it's just more like just screaming and and nails on chalk just like a Tasmanian devil
[47:51.000 --> 47:58.120]  the ones to rip you and your family to pieces just yeah earth is ours murder that's the film's
[47:58.120 --> 48:07.320]  mass extermination program total power yeah but oh i'm liberal oh oh it's for your uncle oh yeah
[48:07.320 --> 48:17.320]  yeah
[48:21.320 --> 48:26.840]  all they want compliance and the society generates the police will be trained that if you don't
[48:26.840 --> 48:33.160]  comply immediately you'll just be shot on the spot and then more cops will get killed as the
[48:33.160 --> 48:40.200]  warrior instinct kicks in in the public to see them as the enemy and that'll further militarize the
[48:40.200 --> 48:44.120]  police then their numbers of dead will be so high the robots will roll out
[48:47.560 --> 48:55.160]  see our pushing is the police is what will then incentivize and energize them in a laboratory
[48:55.160 --> 49:02.440]  war game to transfer them from peace officers to
[49:05.320 --> 49:09.320]  occupying technicians in the transition to the rise of the machines
[49:14.280 --> 49:19.400]  and they'll never know what hit them either they don't know whether kids are dying of cancer or
[49:19.400 --> 49:25.000]  why their kids can't talk or why their young wife's got cancer or why their brother's got cancer they
[49:25.000 --> 49:28.920]  don't know either they're just like the public they're just like babies babes the slaughter like
[49:28.920 --> 49:35.640]  everybody else they just don't know it's just too much fun to be part of the system the system
[49:35.640 --> 49:41.000]  knows how to archetypally program people and ancient human emotions we're gonna go to break
[49:41.000 --> 49:48.360]  come back with your calls and then i'll uh i'll get to the police stuff and tie it into this incredible
[49:48.360 --> 49:56.680]  video these two stories tie together video ufc star tays arrested after asking cops for id
[49:58.280 --> 50:04.280]  another one black man who tortured and executed two white teens makes black lives matter speech at
[50:04.280 --> 50:09.960]  sentencing the family said we forgive you for killing our sons and torturing them to death and
[50:09.960 --> 50:13.560]  then he just says look it's okay i did it because there's a war on blacks
[50:13.560 --> 50:21.000]  and this guy thinks he's good for doing it just like as the police commit crimes against the public
[50:22.120 --> 50:26.120]  the public more and more will see them as the enemy and then just randomly kill cops
[50:26.120 --> 50:29.000]  it's the same thing some white person does something bad to you when you're black
[50:29.960 --> 50:34.760]  so then a random white person needs to die this is the mindless tribalism programming

[54:13.560 --> 54:18.560]  And here's what I have to say on that front.
[54:18.560 --> 54:23.560]  People deserve at least to know their future is being controlled,
[54:23.560 --> 54:27.560]  their destiny is being destroyed, their free will is being annihilated.
[54:27.560 --> 54:30.560]  And at the end of the tunnel is death.
[54:30.560 --> 54:32.560]  Death of the species.
[54:32.560 --> 54:34.560]  Don't worry about yourself dying.
[54:34.560 --> 54:35.560]  What about your progeny?
[54:35.560 --> 54:37.560]  What about humanity itself?
[54:37.560 --> 54:39.560]  What about an elite that decided we're ugly and bad
[54:39.560 --> 54:41.560]  and that we're a scourge on the planet we've got to be gotten rid of?
[54:41.560 --> 54:45.560]  That's why they teach us that humans are bad all day and hurt the earth.
[54:45.560 --> 54:54.560]  It's so that we don't have our survival mechanism anymore.
[54:54.560 --> 54:57.560]  Here's some of what we're talking about.
[54:57.560 --> 55:02.560]  Project HoloLens, our exclusive hands-on with Microsoft's holographic goggles.
[55:02.560 --> 55:06.560]  Again, on a wired magazine where everything around you is listed and named.
[55:06.560 --> 55:07.560]  Everyone's house.
[55:07.560 --> 55:09.560]  You should drive down the street with these.
[55:09.560 --> 55:11.560]  This is where Bob Jones lives.
[55:11.560 --> 55:13.560]  This is where Tom Sanchez lives.
[55:13.560 --> 55:18.560]  This is where...
[55:18.560 --> 55:21.560]  And again, it's being deployed and used so they can surveil.
[55:21.560 --> 55:27.560]  And so you're now basically a bot for Microsoft or Google while you're out there.
[55:27.560 --> 55:30.560]  Google glasses didn't take off because it makes people nauseated.
[55:30.560 --> 55:33.560]  So now they come out with this and more and more young people say
[55:33.560 --> 55:36.560]  they want to live in a virtual reality.
[55:36.560 --> 55:43.560]  And it is a success that they're doing well in their imaginary world.
[55:43.560 --> 55:46.560]  It's sick.
[55:46.560 --> 55:49.560]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[55:49.560 --> 55:52.560]  John and Wyoming, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[55:52.560 --> 55:54.560]  Good morning, Alex.
[55:54.560 --> 55:58.560]  Alex, here in Sheridan in north-central Wyoming,
[55:58.560 --> 56:04.560]  several of us have been fighting this water fluoridation issue now for over four years.
[56:04.560 --> 56:08.560]  And we have these eugenicists who are running the show up here.
[56:08.560 --> 56:15.560]  The previous mayor, let's just call him Boss Hog, was the one promoting this.
[56:15.560 --> 56:19.560]  He was also the one who was fighting any attempt at us
[56:19.560 --> 56:23.560]  to have the state require food processors to label their foods,
[56:23.560 --> 56:28.560]  whether or not they're wholesome and natural versus genetically modified.
[56:28.560 --> 56:33.560]  And then when a state senator passed away of health causes,
[56:33.560 --> 56:37.560]  then this guy got himself appointed to the state senate.
[56:37.560 --> 56:42.560]  And now he went up to one of the only two of six city council members
[56:42.560 --> 56:46.560]  who had voted against water fluoridation in December of 2010
[56:46.560 --> 56:51.560]  and got him all of a sudden to vote for water fluoridation
[56:51.560 --> 56:55.560]  with the promise of he would be the next mayor, which he is now.
[56:55.560 --> 56:58.560]  So we've got a bunch of shysters up here
[56:58.560 --> 57:04.560]  who are forcing the people, despite the fact that in a small town of 17,500 people,
[57:04.560 --> 57:09.560]  we submitted petitions with over 2,000 signatures.
[57:09.560 --> 57:12.560]  Yeah, well, what do you want? Doesn't matter. Seekers, they're the boss.
[57:12.560 --> 57:13.560]  And of course, you know what it is.
[57:13.560 --> 57:16.560]  Depending on the size of your town, I would imagine they're going to,
[57:16.560 --> 57:18.560]  and you probably have the answer to this,
[57:18.560 --> 57:22.560]  but Austin pays millions a year for its so-called fluoride from Florida
[57:22.560 --> 57:27.560]  that's actually hundreds of deadly chemicals the leftover of phosphate mines.
[57:27.560 --> 57:30.560]  And so this would be toxic waste they'd have to store.
[57:30.560 --> 57:34.560]  They just come grease these politicians with campaign contributions.
[57:34.560 --> 57:37.560]  At the state level, they'd be $10,000 or so on average.
[57:37.560 --> 57:39.560]  At the city level, less.
[57:39.560 --> 57:45.560]  And then they will do that and basically sell you out and then dump poison in your water.
[57:45.560 --> 57:47.560]  And this is authorized from the top.
[57:47.560 --> 57:51.560]  All the low-level folks do it for money because it's a hardcore adjuvant
[57:51.560 --> 57:55.560]  that accelerates all the other trace drugs they're putting in the water.
[57:55.560 --> 57:57.560]  And so that's what's going on.
[57:57.560 --> 57:59.560]  Well, and not only that, Alex,
[57:59.560 --> 58:03.560]  but the fact is Sheridan is the only town in the state of Wyoming
[58:03.560 --> 58:07.560]  which actually adds fluoride to their drinking water.
[58:07.560 --> 58:09.560]  Yeah, I see the headline of the Sheridan press.
[58:09.560 --> 58:12.560]  Will fluoride make history again in Sheridan?
[58:12.560 --> 58:17.560]  Yeah, it'll make history all right because these bums are going to get thrown out.
[58:17.560 --> 58:19.560]  Absolutely, but they'll get new bums.
[58:19.560 --> 58:21.560]  And again, the essence is keep fighting,

[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:25.040]  actually experienced this first time and it was scary as hell this was a terrifying thing for me
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:31.360]  and i obviously was a lot younger but um an absolutely terrifying thing and for just just to
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:36.640]  know that that that people can can go through their lives without thinking about this day
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.320]  every single every single day of their life is is amazing to me because every single day
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:48.000]  i think about 911 it completely changed my life completely changed america and and it's amazing
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.280]  that this that 911 truth hasn't hasn't gotten off the floor more than it has it's it's unbelievable

[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:04.400]  end of the break come back and come to stefan and kevin and harry and regina and others and
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:08.560]  taking nothing away from tarpley he wrote synthetic terror 911 synthetic terror it's an
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:13.680]  excellent book great analysis uh but i don't want to say webster tarpley identified drills
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:21.280]  i had guests on who i would then have cover things over and over again hundreds of times
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:27.840]  but he's not the source of that the source is usa today associated press roiders for those
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:34.240]  that are new listeners it's not that some researchers said that the pentagon the cia had
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:40.560]  drills of jets being flown into the exact same targets that day two months before and a year
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:49.040]  before dick cheney had an order signed to take the power of the pentagon and norad to shoot down
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:55.440]  air and aircraft he took it away a month and a half before gave it back a week after so he
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:01.280]  could order the stand down that day and we've had uh panetta the head of the uh transportation
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:06.720]  commission norman panetta come out and say that four times we've played the video clips from congress
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:11.760]  and he was asked later to clarify uh we've had senator graham come out and say there was a stand
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:19.680]  down and that the sawties were basically quarterbacking the operation but that norad stood down
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.720]  so it doesn't mean there aren't terrorists it doesn't mean there aren't attacks but inside the
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:30.480]  government there was a stand down to let that take place and we confirmed this later even came out
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:39.920]  the air national guard refused to stand down on flight 93 and shot the thing down and it came out
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:45.280]  in the air traffic tapes that they put two aim nine that sidewinder missiles into the aircraft
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:50.320]  and it was going to the capital can you imagine the tyranny we be under if the capital was completely
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:57.680]  destroyed that day so this was an internal coup d'etat working with Saudi Arabia as usual to

[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:14.080]  down my take on the dead king and saudi arabia what that means they're calling it a worst-case
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:21.120]  scenario yemen chaos as that government collapses saudi king's death poses new challenges for us
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:25.280]  i'm going to take calls though to the bottom of the hour then i'll continue with calls
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:31.680]  into the third hour but i want to get into this breakdown video ufc star tazed arrested after asking
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:40.080]  cops for id now i can show you video clips that are online a police doing a great job but those
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:47.600]  don't get any attention and i can show you clips of police doing absolutely horrible things all day
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:54.960]  long and that will go viral but i'm going to show this clip and break it down because it shows
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:04.240]  both sides of it both sides fearing each other and within this clip within this story you really
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:12.000]  understand what's happening so it's my wish to not have a civil war it's my wish to bring people
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.800]  together it's my wish for folks to understand the larger social engineering manipulation
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:24.640]  that is admittedly afoot so that we can transcend this and not be chumps whether you're a guy pulled
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:32.720]  over with your wife and child by the police or whether you're the police themselves so i got
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:37.760]  pulled over by the state police once by this male and female state troopers i was going like five
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:42.960]  miles over the speed limit driving to the beach and when they came over they were bugging their eyes
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:48.400]  out and going is that child that's you know you know are these kids buckled in correctly and
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.760]  bugging their eyes i was like what are you bugging your eyes out at me for you really act
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:58.080]  and aggressive and weird do i match that description and they got all upset and wrote me a ticket i mean
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:03.040]  you've got some mentally ill people out there that are police officers but you've got mentally ill
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:10.720]  people everywhere but i'm talking about how the system wants to exacerbate this coming up because
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:15.520]  you could look at this and see both sides of it the ufc guy doesn't pull over for three miles
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:19.600]  wants to get to a lighted place which they say do there's all these fake cops out there
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:24.000]  there then he wants to see their ids they get real aggressive and won't they taser him
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.920]  and it's all on video his wife shoots and they charge him with assaulting him
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:37.040]  and that's where the cops go from it being you could see both positions to to the cops being
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:44.320]  very bad people that they just think by default you made me taser you you you argued with me
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:49.280]  for about two seconds and so i'm not just going to tase you to make me on the right i'm going to
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:53.920]  try to put you in jail oh and i'm going to bring cps in and try to take your kid away
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.120]  saying you endanger the child
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.240]  that's where you're going to get disrespected that's where you're going to end up being seen
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:07.520]  as the enemy and that's why so many people then begin to see the police as a predatory force
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:11.440]  and this is all part of the plan so i'm going to break that down at bottom of the hour uh
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:18.000]  stefan in new york thanks for holding your on the air hey how you doing oh man i wish i wasn't
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.080]  at work right now because it's always nice to uh to talk to you because to be honest guys like you
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:27.600]  you guys are you guys are heaven sent because because of how success you because of how successful
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.120]  you really brought the show i mean don't get me wrong you're always telling people you know
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:36.720]  it's not me who's the only one out there but you know uh fortunately you've driven it to a point
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:41.440]  where you have the millions of views you do so i hate to compliment you because i know you don't
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.680]  like it because then you feel you know well no brother it's just that it everybody does it and
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:50.400]  the show's not about me getting complimented all day we're all in a battle together trying to take
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:55.520]  the hill back from the enemy and so we can all pat each other on the back uh i mean basically to
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:00.720]  quote uh pulp fiction you know the wolf says hey let's not start celebrating yet let's get the job done
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:07.360]  here i know exactly what quote you're talking about yeah i don't say it i know i won i won i went
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:13.120]  that was good but um i have i have a few questions for you first i want you to go first just give me
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:18.400]  a quick yes no answer um the thumbprint on the iphone i feel like we're all sending us thumb prints
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:22.640]  then i say yeah i told people 20 years ago they would phase it in and then it would be
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.160]  voluntary then it'll be mandatory and they're going to get rid of cash and track everything you do
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:32.480]  and control everything you do and shut down any underground economies and then raise taxes and
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:38.880]  regulations selectively with the total computer algorithm systems to bankrupt everyone that's
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.960]  on a globalist corporation then they'll make you waive all your rights to have a job or be on
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:49.120]  welfare and then we're total slaves under a technocracy plan uh to phase in population reduction
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:55.040]  and final extermination right and and how thick is it because at first people used to think you're
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.760]  crazy for talking about it but now it's just so well that's why we had to say it when when people
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.480]  thought it was 1984 and that'll never happen so that we'd have credibility once it happened
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:10.560]  so that's why i didn't mind being attacked by cnn and msnbc and basically everybody else on the
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:15.040]  planet you know he says there's going to be brain chips and he says you'll face stand by and sell
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.880]  and he says blimpster looking at your heat resonance signature and he says there's cancer
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:25.120]  viruses in the vaccines and he says gmo sterilizes you it was all public already it was only in
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:31.120]  research papers not for public distribution we had to decompartmentalize ahead of the rollout
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:36.080]  because if you only criticize once the rollout happens the sheep will make excuses but they
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:41.520]  can't mentally trump when you warn them in an earlier phase of the matrix when they're not
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:46.720]  supposed to understand what's coming later go ahead and you know what i'm glad you held it
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:50.720]  together because you were just waiting for it to reach the surface but now obviously it's getting
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:56.080]  close to the surface see if you were weak you would have you know you would have been like
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:00.160]  alright you know what maybe i am pretty crazy and you would have left the comments except i was
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:06.640]  reading stuff written by the top scientist i mean i knew i was right because it was public
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:12.480]  i knew it was right because my dad was the top of his class and one of the top scores in texas
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:17.520]  and they called him into a room and said we're setting up a planetary world government of eugenics
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:22.480]  and we're getting the top people we'd like you to join us i mean this is real folks
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:29.440]  oh absolutely absolutely and i'm always very curious about like these people who who always
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.320]  approach you know uh whether it's the justin debers or it's the people who approach people
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:40.080]  like your father it who with what organization do they typically belong to i mean i always picture
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:44.560]  some guy with sunglasses and a suit saying hey listen this is how it's going to go this is the
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:49.040]  direction the wind's going to blow uh so if you want to you know stay famous and keep a name
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:54.240]  then this is how it works or if you want to you know if you're a scientist and a lot of the times
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:59.760]  because it's funny i try explaining to people and they're like wait you mean like rock fella and
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:03.360]  all these guys they're geniuses they're really thinking of all these solutions i'm like no
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:08.640]  they just have the money to buy the genius brain they do and they develop systems that were developed
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:14.080]  back in rome and just built on to manage and control populations absolutely you ask how
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:20.000]  do they control people they do it 100 different ways plus napoli and famously wrote the paraphrase
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.200]  that the most gallant men will give up their lives and throw themselves onto swords and spears
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:32.240]  and run into cannon fire for small little pieces of metal and ribbon he basically rolled out not
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:38.400]  just giving commendations to whole squads like the romans would do that they have awards to to to
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:46.400]  different cohorts and different uh you know groups of a hundred under a centurion they began to hand
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:53.120]  out metals to individuals so that's a form of prestige most people just get into power structure
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:57.200]  because they're yes men and will follow whatever they're told so they're compartmentalized they're
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:04.640]  not needed to be given the full paradigm if you want to know i'm sorry go ahead no i was just
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:09.680]  gonna say you can see the ones that are controlled right they always come in the most weasley looking
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:16.640]  ways like ruber just these weasley type kinds of people you can always you can tell who's the heroes
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:21.360]  and who's just someone under someone else's thumb and you and you see the faces like ruby you listen
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:25.280]  to the well sure i mean i mean if you're conscious certainly there's discernment that's part of it
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:30.720]  but listen i appreciate your call let me try to answer your question um it's a very good question
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:37.600]  i mean you could have a phd degree in all the facets of controlling populations
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.600]  and social engineering the different layers of it but i've talked to a bunch of top rock stars
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:51.600]  top hip hop people a lot of it on record major movie stars on record and i've experienced it
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:58.880]  i mean a lot of it is mark cuban who owns hockey teams and and basketball teams besides to put
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:04.320]  loose change out movie theaters a thousand screens the white house called him and emailed him and that
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:09.360]  went public with new york times a year later after i told people it happened and they said we're
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:13.600]  going to put you in prison he said uh well come on it's the first amendment they said listen we're
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:18.560]  going to indict you for insider trading what she clearly didn't do it with some small amount like
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:27.360]  martha steward and even when he dropped the film and backed off they still went after him and
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.760]  indicted him and he beat him once they came after him again he's still fighting them today
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.040]  and i'm not at liberty to say the other stuff they did to him but let me tell you if you're
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.760]  worth four five billion dollars and you're a smart guy like mark cuban
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:44.880]  they come after you
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:51.920]  and they have weird rules because the fact that he's sold out to yahoo and they see that as the
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:57.520]  establishment the fact that he's so rich he's part of the club they just consider him open game
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:03.440]  fair game the fact that i've never worked with the system we're taking money from him it's like
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:09.840]  i'm metaphysically outside of their realm and protected to a certain extent so you ask a question
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:17.760]  that's so complex i mean here's another example christ carter and the crew of x files got approached
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:24.480]  by the cia a year before 9 11 and they said we want you to make a show about hijack jets flowing
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.720]  in the world trade center to create martial law and attack afghanistan it's really the government
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:32.960]  doing it during a drill where they use an anti-terror drill to make the computers locked down
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:38.960]  and they release gas on the plane and then blame it on al qaeda and they said why and they just said
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:46.720]  do it now and a lot of their themes were from the cia and if it's a metaphysical rule that by
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:52.720]  then putting it out they gained more and i don't believe this they believe it interdimensional power
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:20:02.400]  and it gave their real event more favor that it would then be successful time and time again you
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:09.760]  need to come here and help us we need assistance please those we should be able to depend on let

[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:14.480]  no matter how hard you try you can't stop us now that's what the devos switzerland crew of globalists
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:19.920]  are saying it's like a bilgeberg but a public meeting openly announcing world government
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:26.080]  panopticon surveillance game economies the end of the family just a hellish vision
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:32.240]  but humanity never stands up until things get really dark the problem is the globalists are
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:37.600]  very good at creeping around and doing things by stealth and that's our biggest problem next
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:43.040]  segment i'm going to break down as best i can because i was on the elliptical this morning and
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:48.080]  i just watched this video earlier and i was upset about it and i didn't know how to approach it
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:55.200]  it and i was thinking about all the different angles and then it became so clear to me i'm
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:59.920]  going to try to summon that thought process back and try to see if i can communicate it
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.080]  coming up in the next segment then we'll go back to the calls but right now
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:10.080]  kevin and west virginia thanks for holding you're on the year welcome hi alex um i was
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:15.280]  wondering if i i'm sure you've heard of the cno canal um over here in west virginia the
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:21.760]  chesapeake and ohio canal yes um they are they are starting to make leg legislation where they're
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:28.640]  going to start charging people to get on the canal or on the towpath um my question then is
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:37.120]  is this another way of them land grabbing or is this another way for them yeah put armed um
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:43.280]  dnr people it's everything it's agenda 21 where all the waterways are being declared federal even
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:47.840]  though they were built by the states or counties or cities in the case of your famous canal that
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:53.120]  was used before they had highways uh and they're just seizing them the red river they're announcing
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:58.080]  hundreds of thousands of acres on both sides that are that are owned by private people
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:04.640]  they're just the feds are just seizing it uh under piratical edict uh and because it's not the feds
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:10.960]  this is happening all over the world uh where it's a very good question i'm glad you raised this
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:16.400]  where they're announcing buffer zone on each side of any uh creek or river or waterway now
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:21.680]  they're announcing as you've heard puddles on property or wetlands and so regulatory fines
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:27.680]  are coming in and then take austin texas that is implementing all of this it's a model it's a
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:34.800]  immunolized city uh in a un sub treaty agreement uh we have a sister city in japan and the un actually
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:39.600]  calls the shots more than the feds here in austin and that's all public uh it's just the general
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:44.480]  public isn't aware of it uh and they're now announcing they start charging for all the boat
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:50.800]  dock ramps uh to put your boat in and out on lake traviser in austin uh lake austin which is really
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:55.120]  just the colorado river dammed uh and they're gonna start charging you to swim in any lakes or
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:03.600]  anything this is all being phased in right now uh and and the tv news that's all kxc in had the
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:11.120]  headline to raise money the city is flooded with money just ultra rich with huge property taxes
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:15.760]  and everything and it's all about you don't get to use any of the public lands you're going to pay
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:22.080]  for it so they can festoon more i mean here i am saying i don't want to bash police but i was out
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:27.280]  on lake austin with my buddy shane steiner last year with my kids and his kids and it was hardly
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:31.600]  anybody out there i played hooky skip one day we're out there uh wakeboarding and surfing
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:37.440]  surfing wake surfing i wasn't i always hurt my back when i do it he was doing it and my kids were
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:43.440]  doing it and here comes these guys in bulletproof vest and they were pulling over boats and pulling
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:47.120]  over kayaks and really getting in people's faces and they started pulling up to us bugging their
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:51.200]  eyes out behind us i just bugged my eyes that backs are laughing at them and they laughed and
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:58.080]  pulled off but i mean this is that's not how a peace officer acts so uh it almost makes you
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:04.480]  not want to go on the lake um you know that you get treated like such trash uh but again the awesome
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:11.520]  pd doesn't act imperious like that uh on average so it's kind of an oasis is there are some problems
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:16.160]  but like arne saveta said at least our police don't shoot on unarmed people on a routine basis in
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:20.560]  the back then he got criticized by police union saying what do you mean well i mean come on you
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:26.160]  see these cop videos it's scary and sure it's a minority that's doing it but it's being protected
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:33.200]  but i'm ranting go ahead i just don't quite understand i mean i i guess well listen slave
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:36.960]  you're not just going to go you know scan your driver's license and go pay a bunch of money
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.400]  for a license to go fish you're going to pay on top of that and you're going to you're going to
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:46.240]  register your kayak and you're going to get a rest go ahead sorry i mean it's just you know i
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:51.360]  for the third i'm 30 years old and i've never had to pay to go on the canal and like you said i kayak
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.800]  in and i fish i mean there's not a lot of stuff for um oh they're now making you buy registration
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:01.440]  to kayak and they're now uh making you in many states pay a registration filing fee to have a
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:06.640]  surfboard and soon it'll be a registration to wipe your hat your ass excuse me excuse me god
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:12.640]  forgive me i'm just gonna get so mad i'm trying to be calm today this isn't freedom and see we're

[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:06.320]  comments on info wars dot com and on our youtube videos let's say what's going on with this site
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:12.480]  are you schizophrenic alex you got articles about good cops and good things they're doing you got
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:18.480]  articles about bad cops and bad things they're doing i see comments like all right pigs you're

[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:32.720]  police and then i see cops on there going i'm a police officer and i i back what this officer
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:43.040]  did that guy should have followed that order immediately and you just see how we're being manipulated
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:53.840]  it's a very complex issue but this it's basis what's happening we do have a usurped federal
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:58.720]  government taken over by foreign interest it is occupied by the classical definition we're going
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:04.240]  into global government and the average yuppie goes so what that's a natural pattern look at
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:09.040]  star trek is a global government yeah you've been pre-programmed with television and media that's
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:14.720]  where it's going it's a bad world government we had a world government federation where people
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:19.840]  voted and opted in to make decisions and this and the countries agreed that didn't violate their
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:27.040]  sovereignty on joint projects and things like space bases underwater bases uh railroads you know
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:36.160]  bullet trains sure aid projects but that's not what it is the global governments run by social
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:41.760]  darwinist in their words that guys give me the definition of a social darwinist i want to put
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:50.480]  that up on screen these are bad people so i oppose its agenda i don't care how flowery or how great
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:55.040]  it sounds because i know what their end game is and i've seen what they do with captured populations
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:00.320]  and it ain't pretty when they got somebody under their will it's over social darwinism is a modern
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:04.880]  name given to various theories of society that emerged in the united kingdom the united states
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:10.320]  and western europe in 1870s and which are claimed to have applied biological concepts of nature
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:18.880]  selection and survival of the fittest to sociology and politics in short it's eugenics or it's i
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:23.920]  got a right to kill you because i'm in charge i got a right to poison you and dumb you down to
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:27.840]  make you more manageable because i was in that position to begin with but i'm going to tell you
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:35.600]  i'm trying to help you see i wouldn't have a problem with them being honest and saying they're
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:40.800]  taking over i'd fight them if they admitted it and warned everybody it was a fair fight
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:47.280]  many such views stress competition between individuals and laws a fair capitalism while
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:53.520]  others motivated ideas of eugenics racism imperialism fascism nazism the struggle between
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:37:00.080]  natural or racial groups yeah the the the the the the Nazi angle of it took over and didn't want
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:07.760]  competition early on it said let's have competition and then that'll decide who's successful but
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:15.120]  then they just got rid of that entirely so there are some truths to eugenics at least as its base
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:24.560]  rolled out but there's the public pop eugenics uh we just want to make the races better and
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:32.000]  then there's the real eugenics that it's social engineering so that said the public knows there's
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:39.040]  a great evil brewing even if you're at the fog of gmo and fluoride naspartame and msg and and
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:46.320]  television and spectator induced uh neurons where people are unable to act or take action or even
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:50.480]  engage in self-preservation because of their learned helplessness mass Stockholm syndrome
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:58.720]  normalcy bias those are all key words folks look them up if you're a new listener
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:05.200]  they count on that normalcy bias all day long and they count on your fear mechanism
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:08.720]  in a mass Stockholm syndrome to believe you don't have power and that you couldn't oppose
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:14.320]  something so you roll over which when you roll over your body starts to die it they have studies
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:20.560]  literally your neurons start falling apart literally your cells uh start dividing faster you just give
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:27.760]  up you give up because you're genetically not meant to operate if you've given up
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:36.560]  i'm not giving up because at least my spirit and my soul this energy is going to go on
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:41.520]  even if the globalists successfully take over and get most of their plans through humanity will
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:46.640]  rise again i know that in my gut and i know it spiritually and this is the great challenge
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:52.320]  and out of this ultimate challenge can we decipher the enemy program can we defeat it
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:59.680]  can we rise above it if we can do that with love and passion but with the will to violently oppose
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:07.360]  tyrants and by violently i mean violently with words indeed and physically in defense best part
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:13.680]  of american sniper something i heard growing up from my grandfathers that's an old texas speech or
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:19.520]  i just know i was given it by both grandfathers where the dad's sitting there talking to chris
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:23.840]  colin his brother and saying you know the guy was beating up your brother today at school good job
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:30.080]  you know took him on and you got wolves out there that want to feed on innocent people
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:33.360]  who've ever catch you doing that i'm gonna you know beat the daylight side of you
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:38.720]  but the sheep when violence comes to their door just roll over to the wolves we're not sheep
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:45.360]  we're sheepdogs and that's absolutely what it's all about but they've taken the sheepdog instinct
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:51.280]  and really they're trying to turn police into wolves right now because the sheepdog is really
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:57.520]  just a domesticated wolf beefed up with long hair so it can take more bites and big jaws to crush
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:04.080]  wolves and it's really easy to flip a switch with training and turn a sheepdog into a wolf
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:13.680]  because they're very close that's why love and hate really are so close indifference is the
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:22.560]  opposite of love indifference is the opposite of love see when you're indifferent about the world
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:25.920]  you don't love yourself you don't love anybody when you're not in the game you've given up
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:32.240]  and god's going to give up on you you think you have power giving up no you have weakness giving up
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:38.400]  just like if you go on a mars mission and your body's going to fall apart because there's no
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:43.760]  g forces well that sounds fun i just lay on my back the whole time no you fall apart your heart
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:49.200]  falls apart your body falls apart you age 20 years in one year on a mission to mars because you
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:57.120]  don't have any gravity and being lazy watching tv all day watching sports center not caring
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:02.480]  going along with the system spiritually there's no g forces you're falling apart
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:08.320]  there's an old saying that pain is weakness leaving the body well you need to go through
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:13.760]  some social pain you did not until the point of i could care less of national television says
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:18.800]  i'm behind the boston bombing with no evidence or the media comes out with huge lies or or i get
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:24.880]  set up or even imprisoned because it doesn't matter my soul was pointed at in the right
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:31.760]  direction that's what matters and deep down i'm satisfied the fear is gone i'm now in the presence
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:39.120]  of god as dirty as i am and as as rags are on my body i now am in the spirit of the creator
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:43.840]  of the universe and nothing they can do to me hurts me because now i realize the whole goal
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:48.640]  was to keep me from ever realizing that and to keep you from realizing that and gaining that true
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:59.920]  salvation they want your soul ladies and gentlemen that's real as revelation says
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:05.920]  as the high priest of the earth the the sorcerers of the new world order the sorcerers of the
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:12.160]  antichrist it depends on which bible version you read trafficked in the souls of men
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:22.480]  they trafficked in the souls of men and they ran around continually inventing new forms of evil
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:30.240]  so nobody's getting my soul but the one that made it
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:37.920]  you know how to defeat the new order just hit your knees tonight and just say
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:41.440]  even if you're an atheist whoever you are just see what it does just say god of the universe
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:45.600]  show yourself to me change me i know i'm weak make me better give me discernment
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:53.040]  fill me with your spirit give me the understanding i need to to to transcend this flesh and the
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:59.440]  virus of the devil that's what is evil is a virus of malfunctioning twistedness and lord knows
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.240]  folks i'm not on some high horse i've got an evil streak in me that the most evil people
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:11.760]  envy do you understand that evil sees in me everything they want to be because they would
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:18.960]  then use that and you've got that in us too look good people are tougher meaner more vicious and
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:27.920]  more base evil than the greatest of the enemy but you sit there and don't believe you have power
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:34.960]  and won't turn yourself over to god so you're not even in the game doesn't mean you're not going to
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:42.320]  make mistakes doesn't mean that you've got all the answers it just means you got your soul pointed
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:49.600]  in the right direction and you love god you love justice you love the innocent you love seeing people
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:56.560]  be successful when they did it by hard work you're not an envious piece of garbage and that you got
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:02.880]  a big heart that's what god wants because god's got a big heart and he told king david you've got a
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:11.040]  heart like mine because you're made in the image of the creator we are many means ladies and gentlemen
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:16.880]  you need to understand that you understand how big that is that we're made in the image
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:25.040]  of the entity that made this planet and the enemy knows that and now wants to be god with
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:31.200]  all this technology and all this garbage and i said i talk about the police what i'm getting at here
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:36.400]  is the police have been militarized put into a state of fear of the public the public has
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:41.280]  been put into a state of fear of the system and knows it's illegitimate and the interface they see
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:46.560]  is the police who are tasked to carry out the system much of their duties legitimate and part
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:53.520]  of the old republic much of their duties illegitimate and so as they go into this militarized
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:45:02.480]  fallujah style training to quote keep them safe that will create more fear where a ufc fighter
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:07.760]  gets pulled over by the police he's got his flashers as long as his car's got problems
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:12.080]  the cops are probably running his plates going to try to pull over and helping
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:17.520]  he's paranoid because he's got a warrior instinct that hasn't developed he sees all the
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:22.400]  bad stuff cops are doing on tv he feels threatened with his wife and daughter with his newborn that
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:26.000]  clicks his gym i mean when i first had a kid the first six months or so i was ready to fight
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.960]  anybody it's a genetic thing so it's this ufc guy all honed the cops are behind he's got a baby
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:37.760]  that's about a month old he's all jacked up with that adrenaline he pulls into the gas station gets
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:44.400]  out they're little cops he's this big guy he walks over says i want to see id that gets them all scared
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:52.240]  they taser him and then they go further and say he assaulted them and you see the two cops on
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:57.200]  tape when the supervisor shows up kind of going oh i didn't get it on tape the squad car video
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:02.480]  wasn't on when he assaulted me well guess what the woman's got the video he didn't assault you and
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:08.560]  right there when you did that you went from being somebody who was just scared and could have been
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.520]  more manly and said hey back off chief where'd you see me need help stop acting like a jerk and
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:18.800]  that ufc guy would go home sorry because see he's with his wife and kid he's scared he's been programmed
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:24.880]  by the media to fear you just like you've been programmed to fear him like two morons being
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:30.800]  manipulated by george soros in the new world order acting like fools instead though you went to the
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:36.320]  next level and then you framed him and you went from being somebody who was scared from somebody
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:43.360]  else who was scared so he bowed up to you to now committing the act of false witness which is one
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:49.760]  of the greatest crimes you can commit to try to now take this guy's kid from him file charges of
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:54.320]  basically neglect of a child that he did this in the presence of a child when he did nothing but
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:59.920]  say give me some identification so you tasered him because you've got to be in control of the
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:05.120]  situation and now the cops are going to defend you because they're all circled the wagons they're
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:10.640]  told civil war and economic collapse is coming because it's been engineered they're not told that
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:18.880]  and so we now are supposed to in a laboratory event give the police the resistance to finally
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:24.560]  commit them to seeing us as the enemy and the journey towards the globalist takeover is complete
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.840]  they can then start the civil war wipe out much the police and military and the patriot movement
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:36.000]  and then bring in the next wave of social engineers and psyops as the solution to getting the electricity
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:42.960]  back on and accepting the new global government now they might run this next year or 10 years from
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:49.760]  now but they're beta testing this program right now and the fact that we're revealing it could stop
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:48:00.080]  them if people just understood that this is what's going on so I have zero desire to sit here and
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:07.040]  play this whole video report that you can see on edited info wars dot com video ufc start tased
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:13.840]  arrested for asking cops for id and when citizens start killing cops cops will start killing more
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:18.320]  citizens and vice versa and it'll become a mess against them citizen against cop situation
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:23.280]  and you'll end up having police and citizens that have the same mindset here's the article at info
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:29.040]  wars dot com black man who tortured executed two white teens makes black lives matter speech
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:37.280]  at sentencing did the hands up don't shoot black lives matter stick when the family said we forgive
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:42.240]  you for killing our sons who were dumb enough to try to go into town to buy some drugs he took
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:47.200]  them in a field his buddy and tortured him to death because they were white and his uh his mind
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:53.920]  it's okay because the media hyped him up that cops and whites are killing black men and so he's
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:49:02.960]  going to go now randomly kill two white people this is exactly as stupid as the whole band with
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:08.720]  wagon that the police are all devils or the police band wagon that if someone asks you a question or
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:16.320]  says hey give me an id that you couldn't say okay fine i'll give you an id because a real man isn't
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:21.440]  scared to de-escalate things and isn't scared to let somebody 10 feet away act a little tough in
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:26.960]  front of them if you haven't pulled him over and they don't have some big criminal record
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:31.840]  you can see the cops are freaked out after they've tasered him now they've got to cover it up
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:34.480]  so they don't get in trouble see that's where you committed the crime
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:42.080]  and i bet money if you'd apologize to that guy he'd apologize back to you there wouldn't have
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:45.920]  been a lawsuit out of it and then you'd have grown to the next level but even if there was a lawsuit
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:52.640]  out of it and even if you ended up losing your job what you probably wouldn't have you would feel
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:56.880]  better about yourself and have taken a step in the right direction instead of the public all
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:01.440]  saying it's the cops fault and the cops saying it's all the public's fault when we're all in this
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:10.160]  together all being attacked by the globalist it's very simple and it's horrifying to see people all
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:15.840]  over the internet i mean the anti-police hatred in this country has been whipped up and whipped up
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:24.560]  it's across the board it's growing and it's not going to reform the police reaching out to the
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:29.920]  police educating them standing up to bad cops but from a position of justice not of hatred
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:36.400]  and supporting good police as a role model is what's going to fix things and then we could
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:41.680]  turn things around because as i've said i've studied it the police are one of the easiest
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:46.720]  to wake up groups out there they already are concerned they're freaked out they understand
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:51.200]  there's a manipulation going on and if you just reach out to most of them with the data

[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:05.920]  end knowing who jordan was i believe he would want me to offer forgiveness although i know i may

[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:15.520]  of jordan and myself i will pray for forgiveness for both of you no matter what sentence the court

[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:32.480]  there too sons were trying to buy marijuana two little goofy marijuana guys uh look like nice
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:38.160]  little guys uh but i don't say this to put the moms down i'm sorry if they're lost but for everybody
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:43.520]  listening mothers and fathers need to tell their kids that hey if you're going to get into drugs
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:54.720]  don't go to the worst ghetto to get them just the ignorance of white trendies uh is mind boggling
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:57:01.600]  but i guess i was dumb i would go into south dallas to buy liquor when i was like 1516 i'd
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:06.160]  ride along with friends uh do you know to have a party when parents were out of town or whatever
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:10.640]  you know have the cheerleaders over and we would go to the foreign owned usually pakistani or
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:14.960]  whatever stores and they'd sell us sell us jack daniels and stuff or we get whatever was cheap
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:21.920]  as you ever clear and like milwaukee's best um and uh i guess i got um i got in fights a few
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:27.280]  times i wouldn't give i wouldn't i'd start fighting when people came over and tried to rob me um
[01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:32.880]  my parents didn't know about it so i guess you can't really blame the parents kids are just so
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:37.600]  stupid uh so i can't even criticize these guys i was just as dumb as they were i just wouldn't
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:43.920]  buy marijuana whoo but the issue is this is the same thing it's okay for you to torture two
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:48.320]  two two yuppie trendies to death who didn't do anything to you and probably have white guilt
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:52.160]  because they're white it's just or you shoot two cops in the head because they deserve it because
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:56.640]  they're they're cops that this is not the direction to go or the clan goes out and kill some black

[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:48.960]  yes sir i'd uh like to talk about the weaponization of country music the same way that uh rap and hip
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:55.520]  hop was oh yeah they're turning it into gangster thug white trashism absolutely it's it's disgusting
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:01:02.640]  like i grew up listening to country you know hank and murall and wailin and they call it new young
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:09.760]  country and it's specifically targeted at young kids like prepubescence and teenagers and it's
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:15.520]  basically a cia version of black gangster rap for country and it's going in the exact same
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:19.600]  direction and in a few years you're going to be seeing the same kind of stuff that's going on in
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:26.800]  that kind of culture with young white kids that were into country music it's it's really weird how
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:32.320]  they can do that uh well they can't have anybody be moral they got to degenerate you down you know
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:36.480]  your parents don't spend time with you i guarantee you every time i've studied these thugs that kill
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:41.200]  people and aren't sorry they always were just kept in a crib and crap filled diapers you know by
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:46.160]  welfare moms and they just they just hate everybody and just don't feel loved or just pathetic
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:54.160]  yeah one one more thing i wanted to say is that that i went a lot and seen american sniper and
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:02:01.840]  at the at the very end of uh when he he leaves the house after uh pointing the gun at his wife
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:07.120]  you know like chris kyle's supposedly pointed a gun at his wife that was really stupid but
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:13.680]  at the end of the movie it says uh right after this chris kyle was killed by a veteran they didn't
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:18.080]  they didn't elaborate on that at all they just that's right and it's the perfect psi up to then
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:22.880]  the new enemy is the veteran so it's the cherry on top all fitting into the justice department
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:28.400]  propaganda and we've looked into it clearly that was all made up that they killed kyle
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:32.800]  because it would make him even a bigger hero to be dead and that should be a warning to everybody
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:39.760]  that goes along with these psi ups yeah i was pretty disgusted i'm i'm a veteran i served in
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:48.640]  iraq for 13 months and i was pretty disgusted about that movie so well i know this i know this
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:56.320]  the army will not engage and i'm not saying the army's perfect in that type of pr baloney uh i mean
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:03:03.760]  it it is just over the top but the navy the navy's in competition with the army and they
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:09.040]  want their own army and so they've gone from two seal teams to oh like probably 20 now they say
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:15.280]  there's 10 uh and and they just act like you know it's superman or something and the truth is it is
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:20.160]  really dangerous jobs and and and i think the average seals you know really a great patriotic
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:25.600]  person but this is all just meant to get kids to join the military it's all a giant pr stone
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:33.520]  i'll say watching the movie you know i grew up in east texas northeast texas in east texas we
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:40.080]  got a ranch in central east texas and i know so many people just like chris kyle that will help
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:44.800]  you change your tire will come help you roof your house you can you know give them you know
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:51.040]  money to keep for 10 years you come back it'll be there um they're very honorable people on
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:57.520]  average folks like that but they are also very gullible and will really buy into propaganda
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:04.720]  and are killing machines and uh so many people have a family in the military um
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:13.840]  it's it's just smart people when it comes to but but they just are tribal and they will follow
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:18.080]  orders and they'll do whatever they're told and that's why you have such heavy recruiting for
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:25.040]  special operations in the cia out of texas and places like that uh because uh they take sheep
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:29.840]  dogs and turn them into wolves and they don't even ever know their wolves isn't that sad
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:33.200]  yeah it is sad it's disgusting

[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:55.680]  i mean you watch the news and they act like syria uh you know never had saudi arabia involved or
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:01.520]  saudi arabia is battling isis it's in mainline news from two years ago and then even last year
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:05.680]  when they renamed it isis or isle that saudi arabia is funding them i mean it's just
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:11.760]  you watch this and you think that the king of saudi arabia was santa claus but let's go to
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:18.720]  your phone calls right now ahead of that other news i'm going to be getting to let's go to
[02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:27.440]  regina in florida thanks for calling regina hi hi alex are you there i sure am uh now you're
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:33.600]  doing today i tell um uh is this world so messed up uh i don't even know where to begin i would
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:38.640]  like to teach your listeners something about a federal code if if i could sure we've got totally
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:44.320]  open phones today on any subject you want to raise just get to it all right there's federal
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:51.680]  code that we were teaching people um back when i was like 19 i'm 43 now i've been awake for years
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:10:04.400]  and years and years um it's ucc 1-207.7 now what this code says is that you can take your id you
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:08.400]  can take your insurance you can take your registrations and your tags and you can shove them
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:14.960]  where the sun doesn't shine what we would do is atlanta apd would set up roadblock which are
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:20.080]  unconstitutional and illegal so there was this little group of us that knew what was going on
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:26.400]  so we would find out where the roadblock was and purposely have our friend who had an international
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:32.480]  driver's license drive through with her little white beat up old car i don't even remember what it was
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:39.600]  no tags no insurance no driver's license and nobody in the car had id we would drive through the
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:47.120]  roadblock with a big poster that said ucc 1-207.7 yeah well that's like the illegal aliens are
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:51.680]  above the law don't have to have ids or proper license plates or anything and there are a lot
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:57.040]  of codes out there that deal with the fact of the right to travel i appreciate your call let me
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:02.240]  address this now there's a lot of brainwashing out there both patriot mythology on one end
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:06.880]  that's wrong i'm not saying you're wrong i'm saying some people are about their interpretations
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:12.640]  and then the mythology the police are taught it is not a privilege to drive or travel
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:21.280]  it is a privilege in states to engage in commerce on public right of ways that are
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:26.720]  paid for by taxpayers and so they began the driver's license in new jersey and new york
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:36.000]  in the 19 late 1920s early 30s depending on the area they use class warfare they said these trucks
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:41.760]  are tearing up the new roads and they're making money so we're going to make them pay a fee
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:46.800]  for the roads so that's where the privilege garbage started i've got supreme court rulings
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:54.480]  into the 60s saying it's not a privilege to drive that's why you still in most states
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:12:04.080]  can't stop a tractor or other farm implement as long as they have the safety orange diamond on them
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:11.520]  they don't have registration and i say this so the cops go oh that's right he must be telling
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:14.960]  the truth just go look it up i mean i'm not gonna i don't have time to pull it all up right now and
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:21.680]  show people but then they're now saying it's a privilege to own guns no it's not no it's not
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:27.120]  and the police know that's not true because it there hasn't been 70 80 years of brainwashing
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:32.720]  yet but they're trying that the right to self defense is a privilege no it's an inherent right
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:36.560]  the police have no responsibility to protect you they're there to come grab you to take you to the
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:41.840]  court to take you to the jury the grand jury once someone's committed a crime now if they can
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:47.440]  stop a crime and they see it happening they should take action the same common law goes to citizens
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:52.800]  just 50 years ago if you saw your neighbor's house being robbed and you didn't do something you get
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:13:02.320]  in trouble so you have a responsibility to render aid but there's no liability if you don't because
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:08.400]  you didn't know basically and the police sit on that all day well that's fine i have a right to
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:15.200]  defend myself and i have a right to travel the problem is the police are so ignorant just like
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:19.920]  the public that they really believe you've got to have a license and registration and insurance and
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:23.840]  notice they can just keep raising the insurance now until it's cost prohibitive for most people to
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:29.440]  have a car and that's going to be the next phase and then taxes by the mile and all of that's being
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:34.720]  announced i told you 20 years ago now it's being announced i read it in establishment publications
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:40.320]  back then so i've just tried to warn people i'm not a hero i just know what i'm talking about
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:48.160]  okay it's not hard if you want to read eco science or tragedy and hope or the angle american
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:53.680]  establishment or the technotronic era uh or if you want to read order of the death set or if you
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:14:00.000]  want to read mind comp if you want to read lord acton's letters if you want to read uh lord millner's
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.560]  letters from the other perspective if you want to read cecil rhodes writings if you want to read
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:11.840]  the five or six nonfiction books of hg wells or of all these other people i mean i've read it all
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:18.560]  i mean i have hundreds and hundreds of books that's why i know the battle plan and i know it's not
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:24.720]  as fun as ballgate or inflate a gate or deflate a gate or whatever the stupid things called
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:35.440]  but it's pretty darn important let's go to a jay in north carolina jay you're on the air
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:42.400]  hi alex thanks so much i want to say first off you guys are all rock stars thanks so much for
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:48.560]  everything else you guys do oh you're a sweetheart man i want to thank you uh i had a couple of things
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:53.360]  i went on yahoo this morning and one of the first things i noticed is that they had a headline
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:59.600]  that said people who skip vaccinations are incredibly selfish and it kind of blew my mind
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:05.600]  because they tried to say that the the research that's linking vaccines to autism has been
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:10.320]  discredited and even one of the doctors went as far to say that just people are incredibly selfish
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:14.400]  for doing it and that really bothers well that's right they always tell the lie it's always the
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:20.480]  same article re you know regurgitated with a new date on it you see it everywhere that we're giving
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:25.680]  everyone the flu we're giving everyone the measles we're giving everyone whooping cough well if you've
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:31.360]  had the measles mumps rubella shots and all this and they're effective then why are you getting it
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:38.560]  from us the truth is the flu shots never worked ever and there have been more than 14 since the
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:44.960]  1950s when it started major mass die-offs that they've admitted the flu shots caused i mean they
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:50.560]  had the swine flu thing where 10 000 plus people died in the 70s from the damn vac excuse me lord
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:54.880]  from the vaccines i'm not doing that on purpose i just get so angry i start really telling you
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:16:00.160]  what a thing and it makes me violently angry when i say violently angry i want to throw stuff
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:06.480]  of how they prey on the public to take here i mean i'm before he quit a show dr. dina del
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:10.960]  syndicated would would be on the air and every time i tune in it would be like these people
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:15.760]  need to be arrested that don't take shots these people need to because they're giving us the
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:24.480]  disease bull corny hotdog it's not true there it is measles case linked to disneyland rise and
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:30.160]  debate or vaccination intensifies oh that's right because someone must not have been vaccinating
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:35.520]  against the measles most measles vaccines don't work every my dad retired last year because of
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:39.920]  obama care as a physician he would see patients constantly on the edge of death that were coming
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:46.480]  in because they taken they go i got shingles i took the vaccine two weeks going on the why i got them
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:54.320]  it gives you the shingles and so it's so frustrating it's so frustrating it's so
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:58.480]  frustrating we have more flu this year than we had 10 years ago that was in the news last week
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:02.640]  and vaccinations at all time high because of the bullying and they're getting ready for
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:08.480]  forced inoculation go ahead i'm sorry and it's true and i've personally myself have experienced
[02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:16.240]  it my son has asthma and it's sporadic when he has issues and it's usually due to the
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:21.840]  weather changing and anytime i take him to the doctor they're trying to force me to get my
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:28.960]  sister we i work for social services here in my state and even here my sister brought my nephew
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:35.120]  to the clinic here just for his annual physical and the nurse one of my co-workers i sat there
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:40.480]  witnessed her almost trying to bully my sister and to give her my nephew a vaccine but my sister
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:45.200]  helped you know she held strong she she didn't back down and he didn't get the vaccine and i
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:51.120]  was very proud of her for that but you can see it they will truly try and bully you and for me
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:57.760]  they've even called cps on me when i've had long documentation verifying that i i try to take my
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:02.560]  not that i try i do take my son to the doctor i have prescriptions and everything let's talk
[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:07.840]  about this you're already a social worker and the own system is coming after you as if it's
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:11.440]  neglect when there's no law you've got to take the shot they're implying medical
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.560]  a neglect that's open-ended when there's no law to take the shot there's massive evidence it's
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:21.280]  dangerous again if they had clean effective vaccines i would take them because immunity
[02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:27.440]  science is real but it has a negative end even if it's done properly is associated with cancer
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:31.760]  autoimmune disorders you get stung by a bee you might die there's a lot more deadly stuff in a
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:37.200]  shot than you know bee sting it can kill you and it does but if we if they were honest about it then
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:42.880]  i might be more inclined to take it but no they're super secretive they've been caught adding all
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:47.600]  sorts of stuff to vaccines you know they gave black folks syphilis telling them it was uh vaccines
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:51.840]  so i mean let's talk about what this government's been caught they just got caught in india last
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:57.200]  year sterilizing hundreds of thousands of women with a tetanus shot again they've been caught
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:01.280]  since the 70s doing it and i go to the doctor they go don't you want to give your kid a tetanus shot
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:06.480]  and i go tetanus has been found that they can add things to it to then do a lot of social engineering

[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:28.080]  and emissions but also there's a system-wide lie that vaccines are the law and that vaccines are
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:32.320]  safe and effective even though that's just everywhere the evidence they're deadly and one of the
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:37.920]  major causes of cancer and neurological disorders exploding and they'll lie and say it's the law your
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:43.840]  kid has to have it to go to school when there is no law and when parents go and find out i'm telling
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:52.080]  the truth they have paradigm shifts paradigm shifts because they'll kick your child out of school
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:58.800]  under policy saying it's a policy they got to have a shot when the law says they can't do that and
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:02.960]  then they'll say you're truant because you're kicked out of school and call the cops in when they
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:09.520]  kicked you out and they've got corrupt family court judges that are so evil in some areas that they
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:17.920]  will put your child in juvenile detention for not taking the vaccines but it's because of
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:24.800]  truancy it's all games that are played and they run these hoaxes they ran one like 10 years ago
[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:28.880]  in maryland where they for weeks said yeah the kids will be forced to be inoculated thousands
[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:33.280]  line up in maryland and i had the state attorney on he laughed on air and he said yeah i don't give
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:36.960]  my kids vaccines he said you're a smart guy you want to be a lawyer alex like it was cool
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:41.360]  that i said let me guess you've got the waivers up there with the judge in case somebody asks
[02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:46.080]  but you don't tell me by there's a waiver and he goes man you're smart he was black guy he goes
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:49.760]  man it was mainly black people they're forced to take it he goes you ought to be a lawyer you're
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:53.440]  real smart and i said no what you're doing is criminal in my view and he said you know what i
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:59.840]  got to go we ought to find that interview and it made me very sick that you'll have a doctor or
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:03.760]  a nurse at the hospital go yeah after we pressure you take the shots and you didn't truth is we
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:07.520]  none of us take them either they're trying to make us do and it's just like
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:13.760]  i mean i don't know any cops i know out there where they try to make them take smallpox shots
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:19.120]  in 2002 that were killing so many people all the cops i mean just across the country they ordered
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:23.760]  millions of first responders to take it and they said less than one percent took it the police unions
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:33.680]  went no way no no no good see why is it the police that i noticed where the least group
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:41.280]  during that whole thing to take it us today had a whole breakdown of how no one would take it in
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:45.600]  the government because word spread quick when they first try to give them the shots out and
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:50.240]  sort of killing people causing an autoimmune response in the heart this time or the lungs
[02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:55.040]  you have a 35 year old cop take that shot and have a heart attack drop dead on the spot
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:27:01.040]  what do you think happens if you give a baby six seven eight vaccines at once their brain swells up
[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:05.600]  they get blood on the brain they give them a CAT scan they tell the officers mama shook this baby
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:12.320]  and there's blood on the brain you get indicted not enough your kids brain damage or dies
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:18.240]  now they're gonna indict you so see they lie about the shots saying it's the law they lie about
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:22.960]  saying it's a privilege to drive no it's not can't tell you how many times i've been in a checkpoint
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:29.360]  the cop goes it's a privilege to drive just you got a lot of work to do jones just back when clinton
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:33.360]  would happen a lot in hauston back when clinton was in they had federal funds to have checkpoints
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:36.640]  all over the country and i would deliberately hear about him and drive to him and they'd say
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:41.120]  and the cops had pulled over a certain video tip they go uh alex are the russians gonna sneak out
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:48.640]  and get me or the block helicopters oh you know just stay back 50 yards we want to rest to you
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:54.480]  are the helicopters gonna get me we have footage of this we've aired on the local access show i
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:28:00.480]  took clips of it and put it in um police say 2000 are the martians gonna get me the cops don't do
[02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:07.360]  that now they know it was all real that's good we don't need to be enemies with the police because
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:12.560]  they're a microcosm of everything else we need to inform people and just show them the fraud and
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:18.400]  everything else will fall into place but that's a hard road to hoe because it's so easy but you've
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:24.880]  got to do it over and over again it's like picking cotton or something it's easy to do but it's repetitive
[02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:29.920]  you got to just keep putting the truth out all right let's go to calls kelly in texas thanks for

[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:29.040]  texas uh on the whole radar situation isn't it frustrating i remember my grandfather telling me
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:37.120]  about almost getting in fist fights in east texas west texas and uh new mexico as an oil company
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:42.640]  leashound uh because the only place to get a chicken fried steak was military bases out in
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:47.600]  west texas and he'd almost get in fights with nazis who would shoot their mouths off at the
[02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:52.720]  restaurant bar and say you know we had to kick your asses and stuff like that i remember him
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:57.520]  telling me that when i was like six years old thinking he was crazy you know yeah nazis or
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:03.200]  he said some of the bases that were more nazis than us troops uh and it just really freaked him out
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:09.280]  because they put most of them in the southwest and then you tell people today that 36 000 top
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:14.880]  nazis were brought here to run nasa the cia the universities everything they just laugh at you
[02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:19.520]  or they go oh that's in captain america winter soldier that's not real
[02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:25.520]  and then you tell them hey yeah on blimps and helicopters they got stuff that sees through
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:29.760]  your walls well the condition of public now they show a 20 year old device that's been out there
[02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:35.440]  for 15 years that just tells them the person's moving in a hostage situation which gets you
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:41.600]  ready to accept once you accept this x-ray machine then you'll accept the high powered ones on blimps
[02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:46.560]  that see everything going on in your house and are also cancer causing or having you drive through
[02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:53.360]  them so that's the whole point of this go ahead and finish your point and how do you decide if
[02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:58.160]  you're what you're doing is right or wrong if somebody decides you're doing something wrong
[02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:03.040]  then they're going to use this technology to exploit you and any way that they can
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:08.080]  so they're going to use it to you know use that tool to their advantage i'll tell you a story
[02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:14.400]  happened about 16 years ago i was told this by a member of the police department i'll leave it at
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:19.840]  that there was an old retired ut professor of fish i forget the scientific name of that i know
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:25.600]  ornithologist as birds and she had like 30 something um fish tanks in her house
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:32.560]  well they swat team rated her and didn't find any drugs she wasn't home so they put a note on
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:38.640]  the door and i'm laughing do you know why they swat teamed her her power bill instead her house
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:47.680]  only had one person so why was her power bill so high well an ecologist as i pronounce it from
[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:56.800]  greek meaning fish had a lot of power i mean i got a fish tank i have a saltwater tank i got
[02:39:56.800 --> 02:40:02.160]  for the kids it's a big one i mean not too big and that sucker increased my power bill by a third
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:07.280]  well didn't matter that's not evidence that somebody's using a bunch of power to swat team
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:13.280]  i'm looking for drugs the government shipped in to begin with anything else kelly yeah um i wanted
[02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:21.200]  to ask you a question about the oxy powder yes um i was diagnosed um about a year ago with uh what
[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:28.160]  my doctor calls a paralyzed stomach um which means that my food and stuff doesn't prop properly flow
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:33.920]  through me and um i was wondering if you thought that stuff might actually help me well sir i'm
[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:39.680]  not a medical doctor but you've got all sorts of disorders where enzymes aren't created where people
[02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:44.160]  aren't able to dissolve things i would change your diet i would chew more i'm sure they told you
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:48.720]  that i would drink more water but i'd talk to your physician they'll usually tell you surgery
[02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:54.240]  and you know won't tell you stuff i can tell you this oxy powder is the most traumatic product of
[02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:59.840]  a field of dramatic products and infowarslife.com i wish it was proprietary to us it's dr grip's
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:07.280]  product it is life changing uh it's just oxygen to a higher level so it releases in the intestines
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:13.680]  and uh i mean what do you got to lose it'll definitely help your intestines it's dramatic i mean
[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:18.880]  have you gotten the product yet no i haven't i was wondering if y'all gonna run another special on it
[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:26.480]  again i wish i could i mean it actually costs group like 18 dollars to produce and it's very
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:32.640]  expensive and then you've got regulations and crew and and advertising everything else it's
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:38.320]  costing like 25 a bottle and then we sell it for 40 something i mean it's it's we we've got to make
[02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:44.480]  these profits uh most uh nutraceuticals are marked up seven times ours are usually marked up 100
[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:53.200]  um so um and and i could barely find the operation as it is uh but i tell you we'll we'll try to get
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:59.760]  a new special soon okay okay thank you thank you yeah these are when i go to these big
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:04.240]  nutritional companies because i don't just use grip i use two other big big top labs in the
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:09.120]  country top factories we have a ceo's calling us and they go you're the type of people we're looking
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:14.240]  for because they supply whole foods you name and all the big people they go we love what you're doing
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:21.920]  you're so such a surest i mean you're you're putting 65 dollars of money into your um or more
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:28.960]  into your dna force wow other people would put five dollars in a top brand thing and sell it for 200
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:34.720]  i mean we put our money where our mouth is we still put a mark up on it uh you know
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:39.840]  but this stuff's real there's a reason it's popular plus if i was just a cynical bad guy i
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:44.480]  want to sell you stuff that knocks your socks off because then you'll want to buy it more and we'll
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:48.880]  dominate the market but see there's such an idea in the corporate world that no we'll have slick
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:53.840]  marketing and make folks think this is doing something for them well that just just credits
[02:42:53.840 --> 02:43:00.720]  the industry shell quality have a profit it's called americana i gotta skip this network break
[02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:05.440]  because i gotta play these two pieces and go to your calls uh david night and and he's not asking
[02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:11.680]  for praise because all the reporters leon macadoo everybody jacari jackson all of my i can't single
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:15.680]  them all out paul watson everybody they're just amazing but david night has been here about a
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:23.600]  year and a half he moved on here from the carolinas with his family and uh he just is doing a superlative
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:31.520]  job just a superlative job and we really appreciate him and he just does such an on target analysis
[02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:36.320]  here is real journalism breaking down the state of the union this is the state of the union decoded
[02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:40.160]  we'll retweet it out on twitter in about five minutes at real alex jones get this out to your
[02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:44.720]  friends and family here it is advising the congress of the state of the union is a constitutional
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:50.080]  requirement and for most of the history of this country it was done very simply but under fdr it
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:56.880]  became a public event and now it's become a massive pr stop a massive commercial for the president
[02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:02.240]  now obama took this to all new levels last night as he did a live powerpoint presentation
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:08.160]  twisting the statistics twisting the facts to present a case that we have never been more
[02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:14.640]  prosperous or more peaceful we believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect
[02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:21.360]  our planet and today america is number one in oil and gas but the broad themes that he's been talking
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:26.640]  about all week were redistribution of wealth from the rich to the middle class and of course
[02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:32.640]  two years of community college free for everyone noticeably absent from the state of the union
[02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:40.000]  were any details about his policy proposals but the devil is in the details and so are the lies
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:45.680]  as we'll see from the details both the redistribution and the free college themes are lies
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:51.040]  but there are two other areas that haven't been looked at as closely and they will change the
[02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:56.480]  world that you live in that's the trade treaties that are currently being negotiated secretly
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:45:03.120]  and fast-tracked and the control of the internet and new draconian felonies for the internet
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:09.680]  first the lies he will make two years of college as free and as universal as high school but if
[02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:14.160]  you look beyond the headline of the white house press release you'll see that he's only proposing
[02:45:14.160 --> 02:45:19.920]  75 percent of the tuition be paid by the federal government so he's lying when he says it's free
[02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:24.560]  now of course there's no such thing as a free lunch or a free government education unless you've
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:31.680]  never paid property taxes and never will anybody who has paid property taxes knows that it is by
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:36.640]  far the largest part of your local taxes if you don't pay them directly if you rent from someone
[02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:42.080]  you're not going to see those costs but they are in the cost of your rent but the thing that i find
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:48.400]  most troubling is that while on the one hand obama is lying about a free government education
[02:45:48.400 --> 02:45:54.480]  he is also taking with the other hand the middle classes education savings accounts the government
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:58.800]  has offered the middle class a couple of ways that parents can say for their children's education
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:06.080]  saving after tax dollars into an education fund and if that fund grows in value because of the
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:12.320]  investment the gain will not be taxed when they apply it to their children's education now obama
[02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:19.280]  is proposing to tax those plans they're called 529 plans and also to end the coverdale education
[02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:25.840]  savings account now that punishes families that save money to invest in their children's education
[02:46:26.480 --> 02:46:32.800]  and most importantly it betrays those who have worked hard who have saved who have relied on the
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:39.280]  government promise that the education savings would not be stolen by the tax man this is really
[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:45.200]  back in five seconds i just want to point out here the entire globalist constellation attack
[02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:48.000]  the reason the police state's being put in place because they know you're going to get angry
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:53.120]  is they're going to take all the pension funds all the 401ks when they're done that's been announced
[02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:58.160]  and they've done it in every other country they get control of so that's why they want
[02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:05.760]  fema camps and and SWAT teams and all of this to be expanded but the police themselves just
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:11.680]  like in Greece and Spain are going to be looted now when they do it they're going to take it over
[02:47:11.680 --> 02:47:17.440]  and tax it at first and federalize it but then they'll start taking pieces of it and by the time
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:23.040]  you retire you will get maybe 20 30 percent of what you would have this is a formula they follow
[02:47:23.040 --> 02:47:29.520]  please listen to me okay it's guaranteed it's guaranteed are we just going to lay here and
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:37.600]  take this after tax money they're now going to feel that they want to run our lives people
[02:47:38.320 --> 02:47:43.120]  it isn't about getting more money to run the government it's about getting control of everybody
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:47.680]  the federal reserve used to admit its biggest problem was quote keeping the economy from
[02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:52.160]  overheating and people becoming too wealthy and now at Debo's they lecture us on how we
[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:56.560]  should become poor as they bring all their hookers with them and flying on giant aircraft
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:03.040]  there are a bunch of pigs they're the real pigs and they want us to go call the police pigs
[02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:07.360]  and get in fights with them so they'll hate the public and have a war with us because if the
[02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:13.360]  public ever gets with the police and local government that's it for the new world order pieces
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:20.000]  of garbage let's go back to his report now that punishes families that save money to invest in
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:26.640]  their children's education and most importantly it betrays those who have worked hard who have saved
[02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:32.880]  who have relied on the government promise that the education savings would not be stolen by the
[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:39.920]  tax man this is really about punishing self-reliance and fostering a dependence on the state and
[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:46.960]  obama has the audacity to say that he's taxing the rich going after trust funds helping the middle
[02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:53.760]  class this is a massive betrayal of the middle class if it were to pass these education accounts
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:49:01.120]  are not trust funds the average for the accounts is 21 000 this is not a bill gates trust fund
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:08.320]  and 21 000 isn't very much when you're trying to pay for college obama is not taking trust funds
[02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:13.520]  what he is doing is betraying the trust of the middle class who thought that they would have
[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:18.480]  a little bit of an opportunity to save for their children's education but these proposals are not
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:24.400]  likely to pass what is going to pass will change your world whether you are working class middle
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:29.520]  class or rich and not for the better if you want to know how much obama really cares about the
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:34.800]  middle class and the working class look carefully at the trade agreement that he's trying to fast
[02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:40.240]  track with the help of the republicans huffington post asks is this schizophrenia saying you're
[02:49:40.240 --> 02:49:47.200]  going to help the middle class while you destroy jobs by fast tracking the tpp no it's not schizophrenia
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:53.120]  it's simply a lie but the huffington post and the liberal mainstream media can't bring themselves
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:49:59.120]  to call obama a liar look at what the guardian says without a hint of sarcasm the trans-pacific
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:06.480]  partnership is a trade agreement so significant and important its details can't be disclosed are you
[02:50:06.480 --> 02:50:13.680]  kidding me i guess if we knew the secret details that have to kill us anything that is that important
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:20.160]  that significant needs to be transparent and debated in public but they're not about to do that the
[02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:25.040]  liberal mainstream media wants to dance around the central issue of the trans-pacific partnership
[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:33.200]  and that is it's the next step in global corporate governance why isn't it a screaming red flag to
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:39.680]  them that no elected representatives can see the content of these secret treaties only multinational
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:44.800]  corporate lobbyists who are writing the treaty know what's in it the trans-pacific partnership
[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:50.960]  and the transatlantic agreement go far beyond trade they rewrite copyright laws globally they
[02:50:50.960 --> 02:50:57.120]  affect the freedom of the internet and they bypass our legal systems giving special privileges to
[02:50:57.120 --> 02:51:02.960]  multinational corporations that neither individuals nor even domestic corporations have fast track
[02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:08.560]  will not only rush the treaty through without public debate it will block any and all changes
[02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:15.840]  to the document nothing should ever be passed this way now the fact that the only thing we know
[02:51:15.840 --> 02:51:21.920]  for sure about the trans-pacific partnership is what has been leaked by wiki leaks is i think very
[02:51:21.920 --> 02:51:28.240]  telling and the reason that obama is going after the internet in his fourth leg of his agenda he's
[02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:33.360]  calling for total internet control and draconian new felonies for the internet it's a multi-pronged
[02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:39.920]  attack against internet freedom regulatory control by the FCC corporations spying on you and reporting
[02:51:39.920 --> 02:51:47.040]  to the government which they call syspa new crimes and draconian penalties for the new crimes remember
[02:51:47.040 --> 02:51:51.200]  what i just said about the education proposals where the feds would give with one hand and take
[02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:55.680]  with the other now they're telling us well you can have net neutrality but that's going to come
[02:51:55.680 --> 02:52:02.400]  through the FCC being appointed as king of the internet as the regulator of the internet now
[02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:08.080]  of course we've always had net neutrality we didn't need the FCC for that and the FCC has been on
[02:52:08.080 --> 02:52:13.920]  both sides of net neutrality it isn't about net neutrality whatever you think about it it's all
[02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:20.560]  about giving the FCC control of the internet making them the regulators of the internet that's right
[02:52:20.560 --> 02:52:28.560]  and once they are they can change net neutrality in a heartbeat then there's syspa cyber intelligence
[02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:34.000]  sharing protection act every time obama talks about the internet he now talks about cyber
[02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:41.040]  intelligence sharing especially since the sony hack involving the interview syspa's primary function
[02:52:41.040 --> 02:52:46.240]  is to grant legal immunity to corporations that turn all of your data over to the government
[02:52:46.240 --> 02:52:51.360]  well of course they've been doing that for quite some time it's not about protecting you it's all
[02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:57.680]  about giving these snitches legal protection and removing your right to sue them syspa has been
[02:52:57.680 --> 02:53:03.760]  defeated twice but the republicans love it and so does obama now it looks like this or well in
[02:53:03.760 --> 02:53:09.520]  love child is going to be birthed then there's the changes to the cfa a the computer fraud we
[02:53:09.520 --> 02:53:14.560]  got to stop it there because i promise to go to calls it is a very powerful report we just retweeted
[02:53:14.560 --> 02:53:21.200]  it at real alex jones on twitter please retweet it to everyone you know and he just goes through
[02:53:21.200 --> 02:53:26.240]  for radio listeners he shows the legislation he shows the documents he shows the areas highlighted

[02:53:35.040 --> 02:53:40.080]  so we could fight the globalist more cover more issues and we're doing that now i kind of yell
[02:53:40.080 --> 02:53:44.560]  and scream and run around everybody's attention and the reporters can educate everybody of course
[02:53:44.560 --> 02:53:51.600]  i inform and educate as well it's just that uh i just believe in humanity and i know we can
[02:53:51.600 --> 02:53:56.880]  meet these people but you've got to understand how bad the new world order is folks they're really

[03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:53.280]  guy this uh known barrel bearer of false witness uh you know american manhunter and the irony behind
[03:00:53.280 --> 03:00:58.800]  calling him american sniper that's hilarious if you uh live on the east coast and remember the whole
[03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:05.280]  dc sniper thing they use the same words to strike beer into everybody in this area but um anyway
[03:01:05.280 --> 03:01:11.040]  this guy he founded a company called craft international which is basically like a black ops
[03:01:11.040 --> 03:01:18.640]  splint group government contractor for drills and they were spotted all over the whole boston
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:23.840]  marathon bombing hoax well people wearing their uniform and hats were i'm not saying they were
[03:01:23.840 --> 03:01:28.560]  involved but uh yeah no he was that might have been why they killed him was to cover that up
[03:01:29.440 --> 03:01:34.240]  yeah they have that their hats have the exact skull logo if you go to their website it's called
[03:01:34.240 --> 03:01:41.040]  craft the craft dot no no it's it's a punisher with with with blood driven on the eye yeah and the craft
[03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:47.840]  dot or the craft is specifically the term used to describe the lower level of the freemasonry but
[03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:53.120]  anyway uh in and the website itself goes on to talk about how their logo is based off of the
[03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:59.360]  template across which also has a direct connection to freemasonry but yeah no no clearly he was he
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:05.200]  was in the masonry that's pretty clear yeah they were spotted on the ground at the boston marathon
[03:02:05.200 --> 03:02:11.360]  bombing and they've got their uh uniforms their skull logo on their hat the backpack matches the
[03:02:11.360 --> 03:02:16.560]  backpack that they said was evidence of the bomb going off but that whole thing was a complete
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:22.640]  hollywood scyop completely fake if you look into it at all and look how it worked out for chris kyle
[03:02:22.640 --> 03:02:30.080]  yep yep i'd use that now so uh anyone who wants to uh do those kind of things to our country you
[03:02:30.080 --> 03:02:36.160]  know you ain't particularly safe afterwards and uh many of the people involved in sandy hook are
[03:02:36.160 --> 03:02:43.040]  having their lives exposed to the whole world for being in on that fraud so you know it's not
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:48.320]  a particularly safe line of business no i hear you the most dangerous position to be in is working
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:54.160]  for the new world order i mean it is just unbelievable and it's a big hoax that you can't
[03:02:54.160 --> 03:02:58.560]  get into that and get out of it most people get out of it once they get into really evil stuff
[03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:05.120]  so that thing about you never get out of the cia you never get out of special ops bull bull
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:11.200]  that's bull i appreciate your call uh let's go to steven florida steve you're on the air
[03:03:11.200 --> 03:03:18.240]  yeah good afternoon ellis uh real quick i wanted to point some out and this will help people out
[03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:24.240]  in dealing with what's going on with america there's a spiritual and a natural parallel here's
[03:03:24.240 --> 03:03:29.280]  what i'm getting at it's been said that the church is the constant of the nation i'm talking about
[03:03:29.280 --> 03:03:35.600]  christianity because there's been a corruption of the bible and doctrine we've had an acceptance
[03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:41.760]  of deception and lies with the higher criticism and the perversion of the word of god the natural
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:47.840]  outcome is the rise of the dumbing down of our education system with evolution sex ed common
[03:03:47.840 --> 03:03:53.760]  core etc we've also had the corruption of the church's worship with their fake pentecostalism
[03:03:53.760 --> 03:03:58.880]  and so-called christian entertainment so in the natural we've had the rise of hollywood the tv
[03:03:58.880 --> 03:04:04.480]  and music industry the virtual reality versus life reality that's right if you take if you if you
[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:10.320]  take god out of it flooding in is the worst of the worst that will take the four and then force
[03:04:10.320 --> 03:04:17.200]  feed our children uh demoniac garbage to enslave them yeah we've also had the corruption the church
[03:04:17.200 --> 03:04:22.880]  is thinking with so-called christian psychology which makes south god well we've had the rise of
[03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:27.680]  florida and oh no i cannot tell you what it's done with people i know with these name and claimant
[03:04:27.680 --> 03:04:33.520]  brainwasher churches that that turned people into like psychopaths they believe they can do anything
[03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:40.160]  they want because god's on their side it is bizarre and uh we've also had the corruption of the church
[03:04:40.160 --> 03:04:45.040]  that stand with this preacher raptor fantasy residents fight on and endure at the end yeah i'm

[03:08:23.520 --> 03:08:30.560]  you're in the main transmission all right let's hurry through your calls we're in overdrive here
[03:08:30.560 --> 03:08:34.320]  taking your calls out a few other stories i want to head on to show how conditioned i've
[03:08:34.320 --> 03:08:40.000]  gotten they're at davos on tv talking about micro mosquitoes that'll force us to take our shots
[03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:44.960]  this thing get over it you have no privacy as they announce each year and i'm just so conditioned
[03:08:44.960 --> 03:08:51.440]  i'm like yeah they're announcing micro mosquitoes robots a big deal see first it doesn't exist and
[03:08:51.440 --> 03:08:56.480]  now it's just no big deal and even i'm being conditioned it's just amazing steve um
[03:08:59.440 --> 03:09:04.320]  absolutely you know they talk about religion being used for wars and not spirituality or not a belief
[03:09:04.320 --> 03:09:10.640]  in christ but you look at these big mega churches they're just government intelligence agencies
[03:09:10.640 --> 03:09:17.520]  and they take normal people and then get them all hyped up to be super confident and believe they
[03:09:17.520 --> 03:09:22.800]  can act or do whatever they want because that because you know jesus is going to reward them
[03:09:22.800 --> 03:09:28.240]  because they go to that church and it creates mentally ill monsters it's almost like a type
[03:09:28.240 --> 03:09:33.520]  of narcissism they're teaching them i notice you mentioned that and i have witnessed that myself
[03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:40.000]  yeah i have a couple more real quick uh there's been a corruption of the church's mission which
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:45.520]  is the great commission that's been neutralized neglected we've replaced it with this kingdom now
[03:09:45.520 --> 03:09:50.720]  church growth movement focusing on our property et cetera while here in the natural we have the
[03:09:50.720 --> 03:09:56.400]  rise of the laziness of the welfare ebd class farming out our kids or elderly in our industry
[03:09:56.960 --> 03:10:01.600]  and then the corruption of the church's perspective where it's temporal rather than eternal
[03:10:01.600 --> 03:10:06.480]  while we've got the rise of the me generation and instant gratification gotta have it now
[03:10:06.480 --> 03:10:13.680]  rather than think long term the corruption of the church's stand with this pre-trib rapture fantasy
[03:10:13.680 --> 03:10:18.160]  rather than fight on and endure to the end and so we've got the rise of the zombie nation with
[03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:23.520]  the sports the game shows the tabloid reality and then finally the corruption of the church
[03:10:23.520 --> 03:10:28.960]  leadership with their greed perversion and egotism so we had the rise of the criminal government
[03:10:28.960 --> 03:10:35.280]  and their god trip well said i'm going to take the call you made earlier and then finishing up
[03:10:35.280 --> 03:10:40.160]  in this segment and put it out as a video because i think what you've said is absolutely on target
[03:10:40.160 --> 03:10:48.320]  and it's scary and i'm not again up here saying i'm some moral perfect person i'm fleshly i have
[03:10:48.320 --> 03:10:53.760]  bad thoughts but i mean part of that is you wargame things in your mind i i get in the mind of the
[03:10:53.760 --> 03:11:00.160]  enemy i understand how they think and then i look at just the stupid dumb down me me me people
[03:11:00.160 --> 03:11:04.240]  that just want to believe obama is going to give them free college or a free car a free house
[03:11:04.240 --> 03:11:09.840]  and all the illegals worldwide coming here to get a free lunch uh as if anybody's really going to get
[03:11:09.840 --> 03:11:16.400]  a free lunch as if it isn't about creepy total enslavement and even though they get lied to
[03:11:16.400 --> 03:11:21.200]  over and over again they still bet again because they want to believe they're going to get something
[03:11:21.200 --> 03:11:28.560]  for free they're just chumps and then you see how soft and dumb the public's gotten part of
[03:11:28.560 --> 03:11:34.080]  industrialization it's not all the globalist doing they're just exacerbating it imagine when
[03:11:34.080 --> 03:11:39.600]  everything falls and goes to hell in a hand basket what it'll be like with these giant hordes of
[03:11:39.600 --> 03:11:48.640]  entitled weak pathetic people and then all these fake tough men all these fake tough guys strutting
[03:11:48.640 --> 03:11:53.600]  around thinking they're billy badass i mean what's it going to be like for them when the you know
[03:11:53.600 --> 03:11:59.760]  what hits the oscillating device it's going to be crazy anything else yeah i just want to say this
[03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:06.960]  in conclusion uh i'm not for perpetuating this uh you know self uh a fulfilling prophecy well you
[03:12:06.960 --> 03:12:11.440]  know at the last day god said this would happen there's nothing we can do i'm going to stand for
[03:12:11.440 --> 03:12:16.640]  the truth and fight on but i want to say this out what we see happening in america it's the
[03:12:16.640 --> 03:12:23.040]  judgment of god not just on the nation but on the church because of the mockery of god before
[03:12:23.040 --> 03:12:28.720]  the loss and unless the church turns and changes the direction they're going i believe we're going
[03:12:28.720 --> 03:12:35.360]  to see a total uh implosion of america which i believe has to happen to wake people up to the
[03:12:35.360 --> 03:12:40.240]  reality of what's going on because they're so complacent and luke warm and living in a fantasy
[03:12:40.240 --> 03:12:44.560]  world and believing we're going to get transported out of here before this all comes down i don't
[03:12:44.560 --> 03:12:49.040]  see any other way because most of them have this knee jerk during the headlights their reaction when
[03:12:49.040 --> 03:12:53.200]  i try to tell them what's going on well sure you tell the average fake christian their daughters
[03:12:53.200 --> 03:12:58.720]  on crack cocaine they don't believe it till she dies of an overdose i appreciate your fine points
[03:12:58.720 --> 03:13:06.160]  take the story of pharaoh ramsey's and moses um in the bible whether you believe that's true or not
[03:13:06.160 --> 03:13:10.800]  historically it shows it happened i mean at least those men existed there was a exodus
[03:13:12.640 --> 03:13:18.480]  but i went and saw the remake of it thought it was a pretty good film with bail but i like
[03:13:18.480 --> 03:13:23.520]  the character of the guy that played ramsey's i forget his name but it just gets worse and worse
[03:13:23.520 --> 03:13:27.840]  for him and he's getting judged and everything's he gets beaten over and over again but he's too
[03:13:27.840 --> 03:13:35.200]  prideful to stop he's too prideful to turn back and i've run into that with enemies who attack me
[03:13:35.200 --> 03:13:40.080]  and lie about me and come after me even though bad stuff starts happening to him and i don't want to
[03:13:40.080 --> 03:13:45.760]  get into mojo mumbo jumbo stuff here i just know i've got providence that's what humbles me so much
[03:13:45.760 --> 03:13:54.240]  that anyone that's ever persecuted me long term horrible things happen to him and i've experienced
[03:13:54.240 --> 03:13:59.760]  providence uh and and and things in my life that i won't even get into but let me just say
[03:13:59.760 --> 03:14:04.960]  there is a lot more in heaven and earth than is in all your books which shakespeare is that is it
[03:14:04.960 --> 03:14:12.880]  othello just type in shakespeare if there is more in heaven and earth than in all your books
[03:14:12.880 --> 03:14:19.600]  a ratio i forget who he's talking to i'm going from memory here but it's just it's not just evil
[03:14:19.600 --> 03:14:24.800]  that has power in this world but evil knows the promise of the devil it knows it can be given
[03:14:24.800 --> 03:14:32.720]  power and they crave it and good people do not crave it you have to start craving though standing
[03:14:32.720 --> 03:14:40.000]  up against these people and get past your initial fear tamlet that's right it's hamlet i don't
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:45.520]  i didn't remember that where's the actual quote
[03:14:48.480 --> 03:14:52.720]  there are more things that heaven and earth ratio okay so i was right i got the player wrong
[03:14:52.720 --> 03:14:55.120]  than are dreamt of in your philosophy
[03:14:57.600 --> 03:15:03.280]  then i guess in master and commander by uh o brian they change it to in all your books
[03:15:03.280 --> 03:15:09.600]  hamlet one five one six seven eight
[03:15:10.880 --> 03:15:13.600]  let's go ahead and go to add new york ed thanks for calling go ahead
[03:15:16.480 --> 03:15:23.040]  hello yes sir all right uh i'm calling from femur region two the eastermost point and uh i
[03:15:23.040 --> 03:15:28.560]  want to talk about the ronkanka mohub it's the uh corn to chuck schumer the greatest development
[03:15:28.560 --> 03:15:34.960]  project in the nation right now give us your take on it well this is what is happening is i live in
[03:15:34.960 --> 03:15:43.760]  ronkanka mohub um the town across from us called brook caven passed this plan it's being backed by
[03:15:43.760 --> 03:15:49.920]  the olayan uh the sort of arabian olayan group through the tri-tech corporation and
[03:15:50.480 --> 03:15:57.600]  they're raising houses and businesses to expand the uh the ronkanka train station they want to
[03:15:57.600 --> 03:16:03.920]  make macarthur airport an international airport and they've uh and they've been threatening to
[03:16:03.920 --> 03:16:10.320]  use eminent domain we managed to stop them in january of 2014 i went knocking door to door and
[03:16:10.320 --> 03:16:15.600]  so did a few other people we got 1200 people down there to the town hall but remember what happened
[03:16:15.600 --> 03:16:20.480]  in new york and connecticut when they were taking stuff for illa lily's plant and they were taking
[03:16:20.480 --> 03:16:24.400]  like really nice houses and not even paying people for them because see that's the new eminent domain
[03:16:24.400 --> 03:16:29.360]  where they just don't pay you right and you know the top at all this is going through a private
[03:16:29.360 --> 03:16:34.240]  corporation we have over five million dollars in subsidies being announced and now we have uh
[03:16:34.800 --> 03:16:41.520]  schumer is uh now looking for the get federal help and resources as well to uh really tear down our
[03:16:41.520 --> 03:16:48.640]  community and uh and put up a lot of uh section eight uh housing all over the place and they're
[03:16:48.640 --> 03:16:52.320]  calling us a blight and a detriment to the community but they're going to replace it with
[03:16:52.320 --> 03:16:57.280]  something that's no far more on desire well sure that's like gore seafood 15 years ago we had their
[03:16:57.280 --> 03:17:01.840]  ceo and they've been around for like 60 something years and down the texas coast the town just wanted
[03:17:01.840 --> 03:17:05.840]  to take their property to put a boat dock on and you know just said we're not going to pay you either
[03:17:05.840 --> 03:17:11.520]  i mean that's the new thing is you take 10 cents on the dollar or we won't pay you remember the
[03:17:11.520 --> 03:17:16.080]  connecticut cases across from new york a few years ago when they didn't even give them money for
[03:17:16.080 --> 03:17:21.360]  their houses and then if you sued they would then charge you attorney's face yeah hey you had you
[03:17:21.360 --> 03:17:29.600]  have to put up uh not not a uh a security they had to put up a large uh some of money even if if you
[03:17:29.600 --> 03:17:35.120]  do win sure so in the old days they had to pay you fair market value now they just don't give
[03:17:35.120 --> 03:17:39.680]  anything we've got a ranch and we got a letter under a taxpayer bill of rights or landowner
[03:17:39.680 --> 03:17:44.960]  bill of rights in texas legislature passed it they said yeah if we want to put a pipe on across
[03:17:44.960 --> 03:17:49.680]  your property or do something uh you have to accept what we offer or you get nothing afterwards
[03:17:49.680 --> 03:17:55.200]  that will charge you and that's your property bill of rights i appreciate your call ed sorry to hear
