[00:00.000 --> 00:28.880]  It's Wednesday, June 8th. The year is 2022. I'm your host Alex Chance, reporting from
[00:28.880 --> 00:38.880]  the road. I'm about to lay out information central to saving our freedoms and liberties
[00:38.880 --> 00:44.240]  in this country, but more importantly, saving not just our lives, but the lives of countless
[00:44.240 --> 00:50.840]  other people around the world who are in much worse positions than we are. And if we allow
[00:50.840 --> 00:56.480]  their regions, their nations, their countries to collapse, they will then be used as the
[00:56.480 --> 01:02.320]  ultimate weapon with replacement migration to bring down what's left of the Western
[01:02.320 --> 01:08.280]  world and the Christian ethos that threatens the globalist satanic order. Now, I'm going
[01:08.280 --> 01:13.760]  to have our great archivist go back more than 25 months, goes back 30 months, and find
[01:13.760 --> 01:20.600]  the countless clips where I said when the first world collapses, when the first world
[01:20.600 --> 01:26.840]  collapses, the third world dies, and where I specifically explained that the lockdowns
[01:26.840 --> 01:31.600]  across the world are going to cause massive shortages and that the overprinting of money
[01:31.600 --> 01:40.960]  by design for the Great Reset will cause inflation. We specifically called it, and I specifically
[01:40.960 --> 01:46.240]  told listeners hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times, and you heard it, that you need
[01:46.240 --> 01:51.800]  to get high quality, storeable food that lasts for many years when your money has value so
[01:51.800 --> 01:56.680]  that in the future, you can beat inflation that way. It's one of the only ways to do
[01:56.680 --> 02:01.880]  it. Food prices are up more than 30 plus percent in the U.S. the last two years. They're up
[02:01.880 --> 02:07.360]  over 100 percent in many parts of the world. Massive food riots from the Middle East to
[02:07.360 --> 02:13.560]  the Pacific Ocean to, I mean, you name it, it's happening all over Africa, Latin America,
[02:13.560 --> 02:17.800]  you name it, and now it's starting to come here. Now, a lot of people last, Alex, the
[02:17.800 --> 02:23.560]  last three months, we have a plug to prepare at Alex.com. Why not? Well, because they were
[02:23.560 --> 02:28.480]  buying a ton of food, they were getting it in, they were getting it ready, and I only
[02:28.480 --> 02:33.320]  promote high quality, storeable food when it's ready to ship. And that's what we've got,
[02:33.320 --> 02:39.200]  the biggest company and the biggest distributor in the world, powering our operation, my
[02:39.200 --> 02:43.760]  company. Well, guess what? They got a ton of food in, almost nobody else does. It's packed,
[02:43.760 --> 02:51.440]  it's fresh, it's ready to go to you right now at PrepareWithAlex.com that redirects to a
[02:51.440 --> 02:58.640]  very important URL I'm about to give you. PrepareToday.com, the website is PrepareToday.com.
[02:58.640 --> 03:05.160]  And listen, I'm not harping on how right I was because I want you to think, oh, Alex,
[03:05.160 --> 03:10.000]  Jones is so smart, he's so great. No, I was trying to stop these people 30 months ago,
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.880]  25 months ago, 20 months ago, 10 months ago, six months ago. They're following an exact
[03:15.880 --> 03:23.280]  battle plan. They're following an exact operation to make food scarce, to make the population
[03:23.280 --> 03:27.320]  of the world angry, and to break down society so they can bring in their world government,
[03:27.320 --> 03:32.840]  their world castle society, their universal credit score, their social credit system,
[03:32.840 --> 03:37.160]  the carbon taxes, all of it. I mean, this is it. It's now all out in the open. Yeah,
[03:37.160 --> 03:41.840]  it was in white papers 20 years ago, and it was in their battle plans three years ago.
[03:41.840 --> 03:47.640]  We are now living this. And so people should garden, people should get prepared, people
[03:47.640 --> 03:51.520]  should move the countryside if they can. People should take a second job. I mean, people,
[03:51.520 --> 03:55.200]  you do whatever they can to get ready, get prepared, because the further we go into this
[03:55.200 --> 03:59.240]  new world order, the worse things are going to get. And until people realize that they're
[03:59.240 --> 04:03.120]  the ones doing all this, they're going to keep posing as the savers and only make it
[04:03.120 --> 04:07.440]  worse. And you know I harp on that all the time. We've tried to stop this, but now we're
[04:07.440 --> 04:13.200]  already in it. And now we may be able to mitigate it, but there's no reversing it. I can tell
[04:13.200 --> 04:19.640]  you that now. So ladies and gentlemen, get prepared at preparetoday.com or follow the
[04:19.640 --> 04:25.320]  link, the hyperlink that'll redirect you when you go to preparewithalice.com. High-quality
[04:25.320 --> 04:31.360]  storeable food at the lowest price, ready to ship to you right now in stock. Preparetoday.com.

[04:37.360 --> 04:41.000]  to fight the globalists and their whole operation and try to give them the blame for what they've
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.520]  actually done. So it's a 360 win. Only way you fail is not getting prepared. Get your
[04:45.520 --> 04:49.680]  storeable food right now while you still can before prices go up even more. Prepare with

[05:19.680 --> 05:26.680]  We'll be right back with Alex Royer.
[05:49.680 --> 06:16.280]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show, and now
[06:16.280 --> 06:23.280]  your host, Alan Royer.
[06:23.280 --> 06:35.720]  You know, I gotta tell ya, as I'm aggregating my news this morning, laying it out on the
[06:35.720 --> 06:45.520]  desk in an orderly fashion, I'm just, I'm just at a loss. I have to say I'm just, I'm
[06:45.520 --> 06:52.280]  just at a loss. I don't think, I mean, not in modern history. I don't think there's
[06:52.280 --> 07:01.880]  ever been a time in modern history where we're forced to put up with so much nonsense that
[07:01.880 --> 07:10.520]  in any other circumstances there would be an instinctual reaction and response that
[07:10.520 --> 07:22.760]  would stop what's coming. And there's so many different examples of it, whether it's
[07:22.760 --> 07:26.040]  the Democrats telling you that they don't believe in the Bill of Rights, they don't
[07:26.040 --> 07:33.600]  believe it's absolute, kind of a big deal. The continuation of violent crime rates, sky
[07:33.600 --> 07:40.800]  rocketing in every Democrat city. Another day, how many days straight do we have record
[07:40.800 --> 07:47.800]  high gas prices now? That continues. Food shortages, baby formula shortages, wide open
[07:47.800 --> 07:55.800]  southern border. I mean, it's all these complete disasters that normally you would react, respond
[07:55.800 --> 08:01.720]  to, try to get it under control, but because these disasters are actually Democrat party
[08:01.720 --> 08:16.560]  policy, we allow it to happen. And we just have to sit here and suffer. I'm just, I really,
[08:16.560 --> 08:24.360]  I'm just at a loss. I can't wrap my head around it. And we have Mitch McConnell, who's about
[08:24.360 --> 08:31.040]  as useful as a poopy diaper. Where's he on any of this? Haven't heard any comments from
[08:31.040 --> 08:37.760]  him? Where's he the speaker, the minority speaker, Mitch McConnell? Where's he on any
[08:37.760 --> 08:42.800]  of this? Where's he on the wide open border? Where's he on the inflation, record high inflation,
[08:42.800 --> 08:49.600]  record high gas prices, supply chain crisis, stole a bunch of money in Ukraine, got away
[08:49.600 --> 08:58.320]  with it. Ukraine's going to lose the war soon. And we just sit here and take it and
[08:58.320 --> 09:06.800]  suffer. And we don't even have justice. You don't even have justice in this country. It's
[09:06.800 --> 09:15.240]  it's an unmitigated disaster. And, you know, of course, I'm sitting here looking at it
[09:15.240 --> 09:35.800]  all just like, wow, we are, we are f u c k e d, aren't we? We are. They are really, they are really just coming to give us the old bend over and take it, aren't they?
[09:35.800 --> 09:41.760]  So I don't even I don't even know where to begin. You've got the Democrats right now having hearings
[09:41.760 --> 09:46.520]  where they call up a bunch of liberals from Uvalde, Texas, they screen them all so that
[09:46.520 --> 09:51.200]  they can only get the result that they want. So they make sure that every every person they
[09:51.200 --> 09:55.400]  call to testify in front of Congress today is a Democrat liberal. And they're all saying
[09:55.400 --> 10:05.800]  the same thing. You need to turn your guns in. Okay, so let me get this straight. Obviously,
[10:05.800 --> 10:12.840]  it was a tragedy at that school. Nobody's denying that. But because of some kids dying,
[10:12.840 --> 10:20.920]  I lose my rights. What is that? Where's the logic in that? Where's the where is any sense
[10:20.920 --> 10:26.520]  common sense in that? Hey, kids died from a shooting in Texas. So turn your guns in.
[10:26.520 --> 10:30.960]  What? Hey, look at these dead kids over here. We don't believe that the Bill of Rights is
[10:30.960 --> 10:37.240]  absolute. What? What what what what does a school shooting in Texas have to do with
[10:37.240 --> 10:44.040]  me other than I'm sad that this happens. And it's a horrible tragedy that we could respond
[10:44.040 --> 10:50.040]  to and make sure doesn't happen again. With the obvious thing having well trained, brave
[10:50.040 --> 10:56.040]  armed guards. But no, instead, it's hey, look at these dead kids. You don't have a second
[10:56.040 --> 10:58.920]  amendment. Hey, look at these dead kids, turn your guns in. Hey, look at these dead kids.
[10:58.920 --> 11:05.800]  The Bill of Rights isn't absolute. What? We put up with this crap. Liberals actually
[11:05.800 --> 11:13.920]  believe this crap. And you think you can just go wrangle up Matthew McConaughey to do some
[11:13.920 --> 11:18.320]  you think you think liberalism with the southern draw is going to be more attractive to us?
[11:18.320 --> 11:21.680]  Is that is that what you think is going on here? Oh, let's try liberalism with a southern
[11:21.680 --> 11:28.960]  draw. That'll do it. You know, I have no problem with Matthew McConaughey, quite frankly. But
[11:28.960 --> 11:35.880]  see, it's this whole thing like why is he even at the White House? What is he even doing?
[11:35.880 --> 11:43.440]  I suspect it went something like this. Democrats had meetings, and they said, What can we do
[11:43.440 --> 11:48.560]  to convince Republicans to turn their guns in and give up their God given rights? What
[11:48.560 --> 11:54.360]  can we do? And they probably thought, Let's try somebody who's kind of centrist, kind
[11:54.360 --> 11:59.920]  of popular, maybe a Texan southern draw. Let's try pitching gun control and ending the second
[11:59.920 --> 12:04.600]  amendment with a southern draw. And so they either landed on Matthew McConaughey or they
[12:04.600 --> 12:08.680]  were already in talks with Matthew McConaughey. And they probably said something like, Hey,
[12:08.680 --> 12:13.480]  Matthew, you can do a great thing here. And if you do have political aspirations in the
[12:13.480 --> 12:18.320]  future, we can help you out. We're the Democrat Party. We rig elections. So we can help you
[12:18.320 --> 12:25.760]  out on that. You scratch our back, we'll scratch yours. So they go and recruit a Hollywood actor
[12:25.760 --> 12:33.640]  to go to the White House and tell you to turn your guns in. Because some kids died tragically,
[12:33.640 --> 12:43.960]  horrifically. You just you just lose your rights now. And so it's all controlled. And
[12:43.960 --> 12:49.600]  see, that's why they're doing these January six hearings tomorrow night. It's the same
[12:49.600 --> 12:59.400]  thing. It's all made for TV. It's all a show. And it's all propaganda and it all has an
[12:59.400 --> 13:04.840]  agenda behind it. So they want you to turn your guns in, they want to end the second
[13:04.840 --> 13:09.840]  amendment. And then with the January six stuff, they want to make sure Trump never run again.
[13:09.840 --> 13:13.320]  They want to make sure any Trump supporter can't run again. They want to scare Trump
[13:13.320 --> 13:17.360]  voters from supporting Trump. They want to scare Trump donors from donating to Trump.
[13:17.360 --> 13:22.760]  They want to scare other American patriots that might want to run for office out of doing
[13:22.760 --> 13:31.240]  just that. It's all party politics. It's all party propaganda. And it's sick, folks. We
[13:31.240 --> 13:38.160]  have a we have a sick, sick thing in this country called the Democrat Party. It is a
[13:38.160 --> 13:45.640]  terminal illness. And if it's not removed from this body from the United States of
[13:45.640 --> 13:51.480]  America, it will kill us. And you're already seeing it. They want to take your second amendment.
[13:51.480 --> 13:57.360]  Right? How do you think that's going to go when you disarm civilians and defund the police?
[13:57.360 --> 14:01.440]  How's the southern border looking? Wide open southern border plus a welfare state. How's
[14:01.440 --> 14:12.560]  that going? I've got news on that today, by the way, as well. And your only hope is that
[14:12.560 --> 14:20.200]  maybe we can finally have a fair election and vote these scumbags out and vote these
[14:20.200 --> 14:27.840]  anti-American communists out and vote these Democrat lying, deceiving crooks out. It's
[14:27.840 --> 14:30.720]  your only hope, isn't it? Because what are you going to do? Are you going to run from
[14:30.720 --> 14:35.720]  them? They're going to come find you. And even if you run from them, they're going to
[14:35.720 --> 14:42.280]  price you out of existence. As you see footage there on the screen from the latest caravan
[14:42.280 --> 14:47.480]  coming in, there's two caravans coming in right now, by the way, about the same size.
[14:47.480 --> 14:53.080]  And now Mexico is facilitating it because they don't know what else to do. Mexico tried
[14:53.080 --> 14:56.440]  to stop it. Mexico was working with Trump to stop it. Now the Biden administration is
[14:56.440 --> 15:00.520]  doing nothing but facilitating it. And so the Mexican president says, okay, fine. Well,
[15:00.520 --> 15:05.480]  facilitate it then. And they're now ushering in now. If you come to the southern border
[15:05.480 --> 15:10.880]  of Mexico, they now give you your papers so that you can travel through Mexico. Because
[15:10.880 --> 15:15.000]  there used to be a process. You get stopped at the Mexican border. They might stop you.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.640]  They might detain you. They've got their own thing going on. Then you'd have to convince
[15:17.640 --> 15:22.240]  them to roll through. Or you hope you're with one of these big groups and you can just pressure
[15:22.240 --> 15:28.680]  or power your way through. But now Mexico is just saying, okay, you know what? The Biden
[15:28.680 --> 15:33.080]  administration wants to have a wide open southern border. Fine, we'll facilitate it. So now
[15:33.080 --> 15:37.600]  whenever anybody comes into Mexico and they say they want to get to the U.S., Mexico gives
[15:37.600 --> 15:42.600]  them their paperwork so that they can get through the country without any obstacles.
[15:42.600 --> 15:48.160]  Yes. And of course, then there's the globalists that are intentionally crashing the entire
[15:48.160 --> 15:53.720]  planet's economic system so that they can buy it up for pennies on the dollar and conquer
[15:53.720 --> 16:00.240]  it and put you into a global government slave state. It's all happening, folks.
[16:00.240 --> 16:06.960]  The biggest sale of the historic year 2022 is here. It's our Memorial Day special that

[19:11.840 --> 19:17.000]  I set out on a run I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.640]  going you know besides the energy turbo force it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin
[19:22.640 --> 19:28.240]  C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[19:28.240 --> 19:32.640]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training. And then every day now I'm taking
[19:32.640 --> 19:38.800]  Dr. Jones' sore list. I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this is great for giving my joints
[19:38.800 --> 19:44.080]  the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[19:44.080 --> 19:48.680]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training. Even
[19:48.680 --> 19:53.640]  if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news turbo force that can still give
[19:53.640 --> 19:57.960]  you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore list can keep you moving and
[19:57.960 --> 20:00.880]  feeling great at any age.
[20:00.880 --> 20:28.480]  Eating a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[20:28.480 --> 20:34.560]  Are you enjoying the show? No, not the Alex Jones show. I do hope you enjoy this transmission
[20:34.560 --> 20:40.480]  today but no. Are you enjoying the globalist show? Are you enjoying the Democrat psychopath
[20:40.480 --> 20:46.480]  show? You having fun yet? There's no business like show business. Calling up Matthew McConaughey.
[20:46.480 --> 20:52.840]  Hey, let's tell Americans we'll take their guns but with a Southern draw. That'll work.
[20:52.840 --> 20:58.520]  For ABC's news executive James Goldstein producing the January 6th committee primetime hearing.
[20:58.520 --> 21:02.800]  Isn't that nice? They get it right at primetime. I'm that workout for them. They get it right
[21:02.800 --> 21:07.480]  at primetime. They hire an ABC news executive who covered up the Epstein sex trafficking
[21:07.480 --> 21:12.720]  to run it for them. Made for TV event, baby. No business like show business. President
[21:12.720 --> 21:20.800]  Biden sets Jimmy Kimmel live in studio guest appearance this week. BTS fans praise K-pop
[21:20.800 --> 21:25.680]  band's milestone White House visit to combat anti-Asian hate. It's funny they don't talk
[21:25.680 --> 21:30.320]  about the anti-Asian hate once they learned that it was being done by non-whites. They
[21:30.320 --> 21:36.440]  dropped that like a hot potato, didn't they? Because they just hate white people. Ah, yes,
[21:36.440 --> 21:50.440]  it's, oh, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, I'm just, here you go. How about this? How about
[21:50.440 --> 21:57.480]  this for you today? A San Francisco middle school brought a drag queen named Jizz to
[21:57.480 --> 22:02.240]  perform for students today. He deleted the video but not before I saved it. This is the
[22:02.240 --> 22:09.320]  kind of psychotic derangement the left is currently engaged in. Here, guys, let's show
[22:09.320 --> 22:12.840]  you. Do we have the video ready? Here, you want to see a little, let's sew you a little
[22:12.840 --> 22:34.320]  of drag queen jizz here for kids. Drag queen jizz for kids. Go ahead. All right. Drag queen
[22:34.320 --> 22:41.960]  jizz for kids. It's not going to look itself, you know. It's not going to look itself, you
[22:41.960 --> 22:48.840]  know. And I mean, look, I've got a whole, I've got a whole stack of this crap. I've got a
[22:48.840 --> 22:57.960]  whole stack of perverts getting access to children and dancing for them and touching
[22:57.960 --> 23:05.040]  them and doing strip shows for them, taking singles from them. I mean, what the hell is
[23:05.040 --> 23:11.320]  going on here? Here, guys, let's just, I mean, here, let's go ahead and roll clip 14. I mean,
[23:11.320 --> 23:14.960]  this is, this is liberalism. I think maybe we should just embrace it. Let's just embrace
[23:14.960 --> 23:21.380]  liberalism today. And you just saw drag queen jizz for kids. So that's nice. Democrats bringing
[23:21.380 --> 23:27.720]  drag queen jizz for kids to your school. And here's another drag queen collecting singles
[23:27.720 --> 23:33.080]  and dollars for kids because, you know, we're sexualizing the kids. We're liberals. Guys,
[23:33.080 --> 23:46.360]  roll clip 14. It's beautiful. Oh, yeah. The performers are kids. It's a kid, kid drag
[23:46.360 --> 24:00.320]  performer now. They've done it. What's next? Kid prostitutes. So now you have kids doing
[24:00.320 --> 24:21.400]  strip shows for drag queens. Yeah, liberal. Yeah, pride. What kind of hell? What kind
[24:21.400 --> 24:29.400]  of satanic hell are we in? And how do we get out of it? I can't watch it anymore, guys.
[24:29.400 --> 24:41.560]  Please. I can't do it anymore. That's fine. Thank you. What I'm saying is like, I've only
[24:41.560 --> 24:47.960]  done this for almost seven years now. Alex has been doing it for more than 20. I mean,
[24:47.960 --> 24:54.800]  it's not that I'm at my wit's end because I like hosting a talk show and communicating
[24:54.800 --> 25:02.760]  to you. But I mean, it's just, I mean, this is just ridiculous at this point. We let adults
[25:02.760 --> 25:08.600]  turn kids into strippers for their own entertainment and for their own pleasure. And we call it
[25:08.600 --> 25:17.040]  liberal and we call it pride. And somehow that's okay. But I mean, if we can't stop
[25:17.040 --> 25:21.480]  that type of pedophile activity, of course, we're not going to close the border. Are you
[25:21.480 --> 25:26.040]  kidding me? We can't even stop pedophiles getting access to kids and calling it pride.
[25:26.040 --> 25:30.520]  Calling it liberal. So but oh, I'm sure we'll stop the southern border. I'm sure we'll have
[25:30.520 --> 25:36.520]  justice in this country. Yeah, I'm sure that's how it'll go down. No, we are, we are getting
[25:36.520 --> 25:48.920]  seriously judged right now. And you know, I'm just, I love life, but boy, oh boy, if
[25:48.920 --> 25:56.800]  God just decided to wipe us all out right now, wouldn't you understand why wouldn't you probably
[25:56.800 --> 26:05.560]  even agree? We're murdering babies by the millions every year. We're turning them into strippers
[26:05.560 --> 26:14.200]  and prostitutes for liberals for Pride month. And that's the thing is this isn't even a
[26:14.200 --> 26:20.640]  political issue. This is not a political issue. This is a human and humanity issue. This is
[26:20.640 --> 26:25.200]  a culture issue. It's a political issue. And the fact that it's the left, it's the Democrats
[26:25.200 --> 26:32.040]  doing that. They're the ones going full pedophile now. But this shouldn't be something we're
[26:32.040 --> 26:37.240]  even debating over. There shouldn't be a there shouldn't be a policy debate here. This is
[26:37.240 --> 26:45.800]  clearly inappropriate, borderline pedophilia, certainly child abuse, but it's liberal and
[26:45.800 --> 26:59.060]  it's Pride month. So we accept it. I'm just sick. Oh, there's a story in the Chicago
[26:59.060 --> 27:10.200]  Sun Times that says, why should we ban child porn and not guns? Not even kidding. Comparing
[27:10.200 --> 27:16.600]  child porn to gun ownership. That only happens with one person and that's a Democrat. That's
[27:16.600 --> 27:25.800]  a liberal. These people are sick. They must be there. Their thought process, their ideology,
[27:25.800 --> 27:34.720]  their policies, their politics must be completely eradicated from this country or we're all dead.
[27:34.720 --> 27:40.300]  Forget about it. If modern day liberalism is not completely eradicated from this country,
[27:40.300 --> 27:44.760]  you can forget about it, folks. It's done. We're done. Yeah, there it is right there.
[27:44.760 --> 27:53.960]  Why restrict child porn and not guns? Chicago Sun Times. It's real article. You know, some
[27:53.960 --> 27:58.120]  saying is I got all the news in front of me. I can sit here and I can read headlines all
[27:58.120 --> 28:07.840]  day. But it's like I can't even think straight because of how insane it all is. So I'm going
[28:07.840 --> 28:13.920]  to take this break and just kind of take some deep breaths and I'll actually come in and
[28:13.920 --> 28:19.200]  cover the news in the next segment here. But it's the same stuff. Democrats want to take
[28:19.200 --> 28:29.280]  your guns. Democrats rigging court cases, record high gas prices, record high inflation. Democrats
[28:29.280 --> 28:34.640]  rigging elections. We've got that. We've got a big political corruption story. FBI seizes
[28:34.640 --> 28:42.040]  retired generals data related to Qatar lobbying. That's a big one. You know, so another Democrat
[28:42.040 --> 28:49.480]  caught stuffing the ballot boxes. Democrats cheaters, liars, thieves, criminals, pedophiles,
[28:49.480 --> 28:56.080]  crooks, demons. And we just sit here and put up with them. That's good. We're just, we're
[28:56.080 --> 28:57.080]  just tolerant.
[28:57.080 --> 29:05.080]  I want to take a minute out to address the viewers and listeners of M4 Wars and to remind
[29:05.080 --> 29:10.920]  you that we've been vindicated and that world government and its tyrannical aim of depopulation
[29:10.920 --> 29:16.680]  is now out of the open. Everything you and I have done together has been distorted. And
[29:16.680 --> 29:20.760]  we cannot continue in this fight without your support. I want to encourage you all to be
[29:20.760 --> 29:26.280]  part of history right now. Oh, you still can to get the third and final coin in the founding
[29:26.280 --> 29:34.280]  member coin series to come and take it free men bear arms coins at 1776coin.com. In just

[29:49.760 --> 29:58.000]  history and to get this historic memento that keeps us on air at info or store.com or 1776coin.com
[29:58.000 --> 29:59.840]  while you still can.

[30:03.560 --> 30:07.920]  word of mouth and prayer. All the success that we've had together against the globalist
[30:07.920 --> 30:13.480]  and the fact that we're not caught flat footed during our major takeover is because of you.
[30:13.480 --> 30:17.960]  Humanity has a real fighting chance. I just want to thank you all for buying products
[30:17.960 --> 30:21.600]  and then forward store.com like books and films and supplements and water filtration
[30:21.600 --> 30:24.960]  air filtration so much more. But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight
[30:24.960 --> 30:29.160]  donation so we get almost 100% of the money to fund our operation during this critical
[30:29.160 --> 30:35.800]  time, go to info or store.com and right at the top, you'll see a link to make a straight

[30:45.640 --> 30:50.160]  that want to support freedom to take action now and be part of the global awakening, the

[31:06.640 --> 31:12.560]  biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the sensors has been patriot apparel
[31:12.560 --> 31:16.840]  so we can identify each other so we can spread the word and so we can push people to websites
[31:16.840 --> 31:21.560]  like info wars.com so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it. Now
[31:21.560 --> 31:24.960]  ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our designs of
[31:24.960 --> 31:29.480]  t-shirts some of which go back more than 25 years. All these shirts are limited edition.

[31:33.640 --> 31:39.080]  wardrobe. So there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left and a couple weeks they'll
[31:39.080 --> 31:45.640]  all be gone and they'll be history. We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.

[33:00.920 --> 33:11.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones. From the
[33:11.280 --> 33:22.120]  front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:22.120 --> 33:51.240]  I've also seen the statement said on Twitter and other places on the internet. That's
[33:51.240 --> 33:56.800]  basically what real financial planners and stockbrokers who aren't scammers are telling
[33:56.800 --> 34:02.040]  people right now. And look at what Bill Gates is doing. Preposition before this, even before
[34:02.040 --> 34:08.800]  he launched the pandemic, the pandemic with Klaus Schwab, the new world order out of Wuhan,
[34:08.800 --> 34:13.440]  noticed that they were already buying up land all over the world, farmland. And now he's
[34:13.440 --> 34:18.200]  telling you, like we warned years ago, he would do, oh, sorry, you're not going to raise
[34:18.200 --> 34:22.400]  regular beef on this or regular crops. It's going to all going to be GMO. It's all going
[34:22.400 --> 34:27.920]  to be synthetic. It's all going to be laboratory. So he says he's buying it up so that no one
[34:27.920 --> 34:32.880]  can use it. Exactly as we told you years ago. He was doing because it's all part of
[34:32.880 --> 34:42.080]  a sustainable development agenda 2030 to 2030 goals. And they have been implementing this
[34:42.080 --> 34:48.680]  whole thing in our face. So if you go back 30 months ago, right through to last week,
[34:48.680 --> 34:53.600]  I have been warning and harping on the fact that we are going to see hyperinflation. We're
[34:53.600 --> 34:57.120]  going to see food shortages worldwide. We're going to see collapse of the third world. We're
[34:57.120 --> 35:01.160]  going to see the UN organizing tens of millions of hundreds of millions of people to flood
[35:01.160 --> 35:06.000]  into Europe and the United States. And now that's not coming. That's here. So that's
[35:06.000 --> 35:09.640]  why we expose them. That's why we talk about the new world order. That's why we talk about
[35:09.640 --> 35:14.480]  the globalist when almost nobody else will in Congress or anywhere else. Finally, Tucker
[35:14.480 --> 35:19.240]  Carlson talks about it. Finally, Joe Rogan talks about it. Finally, a few senators like
[35:19.240 --> 35:24.640]  Rand Paul are talking about it. But even Rand Paul is like, no, let me tell you, world government
[35:24.640 --> 35:29.960]  does exist and they want to take our freedoms and they're behind this whole operation. And
[35:29.960 --> 35:36.000]  you know, they're behind Trudeau's administration up in Canada and he's a dictator. The time
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.600]  for spud and feeding people is over, folks. We're under globalist attack. It's that simple.
[35:41.600 --> 35:45.160]  Now that said, I'm going to have the archivist go back and not just get all the clips where
[35:45.160 --> 35:49.760]  I make the statement when the first world collapses, the third world dies. But the specific
[35:49.760 --> 35:54.200]  analysis I did, I remember even back at CPAC over two and a half years ago, specifically
[35:54.200 --> 35:58.840]  laying out how the famine would come, how the food prices would explode, how when in
[35:58.840 --> 36:04.240]  a country people spend 50% or more of their paycheck or their money, their earnings on
[36:04.240 --> 36:10.320]  food, you always have massive riots and collapse of society. This is a known operation and
[36:10.320 --> 36:14.840]  Klaus Schwab and others are bragging about it. So we're going to get those clips together
[36:14.840 --> 36:19.480]  and play those for you so everybody can remember what I said so you'll remember what I'm about
[36:19.480 --> 36:25.080]  to say right now. If you think inflation is bad right now, if we don't stop what the
[36:25.080 --> 36:28.080]  globalists are doing, if they don't stop all this money printing, if they don't stop
[36:28.080 --> 36:33.480]  the next lockdown, they're already starting to set up and prepare, you'll see triple the
[36:33.480 --> 36:38.360]  food prices. You'll see triple the inflation within a year or two. Guaranteed. In fact,
[36:38.360 --> 36:43.000]  most mainline trajectories are showing similar numbers of that. So if you bought storeable
[36:43.000 --> 36:47.800]  food, you got high quality food, you got the liberty quickly, you kept us on the air, you
[36:47.800 --> 36:51.880]  made a very, very, very, very, very smart move. And I would encourage people out there
[36:51.880 --> 36:56.640]  who haven't gotten high quality storeable food or only got a little bit to get it while
[36:56.640 --> 37:00.680]  you can. Now a lot of you probably noticed, I've not been promoting storeable food for
[37:00.680 --> 37:05.560]  three, four months because I know it's been sold out almost everywhere. I know everybody
[37:05.560 --> 37:09.440]  was basically backlogged and I'm not going to sit there and tell you to get storeable
[37:09.440 --> 37:13.880]  food when it's not in stock, ready to ship to you right then. And our supplier is the
[37:13.880 --> 37:17.440]  biggest and the best of the country and they were only a few weeks behind. Well now they've
[37:17.440 --> 37:23.040]  made so many giant food purchases into the future and they have so much pull in the market
[37:23.040 --> 37:26.760]  they were able to get a ton of food in and now they've got all their major lines stocked
[37:26.760 --> 37:34.800]  ready to ship to you right now at preparewithalix.com which hyperlinks over to preparetoday.com.
[37:34.800 --> 37:38.960]  And so the food is in, it's quality, they haven't raised prices like everybody else
[37:38.960 --> 37:43.240]  has done, they're committed to this and they're ready to ship it to you right now. It's the
[37:43.240 --> 37:49.160]  entire My Patriots Supply interface, it's just their shopping cart but then that way
[37:49.160 --> 37:54.240]  we get credit to keep info wars on the air. You get the full service, best prices, everything
[37:54.240 --> 38:02.640]  at preparetoday.com or preparewithalix.com and we're extremely excited about the fact
[38:02.640 --> 38:06.320]  that they have a ton of food in, that it's packed, that it's ready to go, that we've
[38:06.320 --> 38:11.200]  got the green light to start promoting and selling food because A, it's something you
[38:11.200 --> 38:17.920]  need, B, it helps funder operation and keep us on air and C, the new old order does not
[38:17.920 --> 38:21.960]  want you being self-sufficient and able to take care of yourself and take care of others.
[38:21.960 --> 38:27.240]  So just as important as a firearm or water filtration is storeable food, you absolutely
[38:27.240 --> 38:35.080]  need it and this is the place to get it, preparetoday.com. The entire new old order agenda is betting
[38:35.080 --> 38:41.080]  and is hoping on the fact that you will still sit there on your hands or flat footed and
[38:41.080 --> 38:45.480]  be caught by these people. So again, I'm going to lay it out very, very slowly. It was a sure
[38:45.480 --> 38:49.040]  bet that my storeable food in the last two and a half years, when I told you it was an
[38:49.040 --> 38:54.840]  emergency and that massive inflation was coming. And it is a sure bet right now because this
[38:54.840 --> 38:59.240]  is an awesome company with high quality food that is one of our biggest sponsors that's
[38:59.240 --> 39:05.480]  ready to ship to you that has it in stock. The only way you fail is not going to preparetoday.com
[39:05.480 --> 39:11.200]  or preparewithoutwitch.com and checking out the amazing lines of food I almost forgot.
[39:11.200 --> 39:15.400]  This is the greatest part about it. Working with these folks, they have put their entire
[39:15.400 --> 39:23.040]  spectrum of high quality survival gear and preparedness gear, not just produced and made
[39:23.040 --> 39:27.920]  by them like the Alexa Pure Breeze and the Alexa Pure Pro water filters and all that
[39:27.920 --> 39:33.040]  top of the line quality products, but hundreds of other amazing products in the industry
[39:33.040 --> 39:38.640]  of preparedness that they're able to buy in bulk and pass the savings on to you. And then
[39:38.640 --> 39:43.160]  that also then helps us stay on air by you doing your preparedness and survival shopping
[39:43.160 --> 39:49.200]  at preparewithAlex.com or preparetoday.com. In fact, I cut some ads about this the other
[39:49.200 --> 39:55.440]  day but I kind of dropped the ball because I didn't take the point that this has literally
[39:55.440 --> 39:59.680]  every different type of high quality preparedness item you can imagine all in one place at a
[39:59.680 --> 40:04.760]  low price and it keeps them forwards on the air. So, preparetoday.com, you don't want
[40:04.760 --> 40:10.200]  to be sitting here in a year or two when inflation is so much worse and there's bigger food
[40:10.200 --> 40:14.160]  shortages and when you think baby formula will not be on the shelves a problem, this
[40:14.160 --> 40:19.080]  is all a design collapse with these food plants being blown up and burned up all over not
[40:19.080 --> 40:24.560]  just here but all over Europe. This is the extinction rebellion cult that is funded by
[40:24.560 --> 40:29.320]  the big banks trying to take down civilization so that we go to our knees and they can come
[40:29.320 --> 40:33.400]  in and give us a universal basic income to control our lives. That's what this is. It's
[40:33.400 --> 40:39.720]  the plan and it's here. So, again, the only way you fail, ladies and gentlemen, is not
[40:39.720 --> 40:44.080]  taking action and not getting prepared. Now, I feel so good about promoting this. I feel
[40:44.080 --> 40:48.320]  so good about giving people high quality food and low prices and also keeps on the air.
[40:48.320 --> 40:52.920]  361. I want to thank you all for your support. Please visit preparedtoday.com and now I want
[40:52.920 --> 40:58.800]  to show your takes over. You know, it really is serious, isn't it? People are really looking
[40:58.800 --> 41:05.320]  at what they can do to survive this coming collapse that seems inevitable now. And actually,
[41:05.320 --> 41:11.640]  guys, I want to go to a different clip here instead because I'm short on time. You know,
[41:11.640 --> 41:16.880]  it's not just the danger of the policy that's going to destroy everything. It's the denial
[41:16.880 --> 41:21.720]  of reality by the modern day left. They think everything's great. But of course, it's Matthew
[41:21.720 --> 41:24.960]  McConaughey worth millions of dollars. He has armed security. It's Robert De Niro worth
[41:24.960 --> 41:28.640]  millions of dollars. He has armed security. Here's Robert De Niro with Stephen Colbert
[41:28.640 --> 41:32.400]  talking about how great the country is right now with Biden.
[41:32.400 --> 41:39.600]  But what about like, I know that you have a fair amount of, you have emotions about politics.
[41:39.600 --> 41:43.440]  You have thoughts, of course, first. Those are emotions. I know you have some anxiety
[41:43.440 --> 41:49.080]  about state of politics in the United States. Having a new guy at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,
[41:49.080 --> 41:56.000]  has that, have you sleep any better at night? Yes. Yes, I love watching the American people
[41:56.000 --> 42:01.920]  get crushed by inflation and energy prices and open borders and Democrat collapse.
[42:01.920 --> 42:06.880]  He got us into calm waters. That was always the idea. He's doing a very good job. A good
[42:06.880 --> 42:13.040]  job. It's a tough one. I couldn't imagine. I could imagine how difficult it is. I have
[42:13.040 --> 42:19.240]  decisions in my own personal life that I imagine that what he goes through is 100 times that.
[42:19.240 --> 42:27.040]  And so, no, he's doing the best he can. And we got to get through a bad period. Period.
[42:27.040 --> 42:31.040]  Oh, it's a bad period now. It's graduation season. One thing you and I have had in common
[42:31.040 --> 42:34.880]  with a couple. So, there you go. Oh, everything's great. Everything's good. It's a bad time.
[42:34.880 --> 42:40.040]  We'll get through it. Oh, will we? You with your millions of dollars in multiple mansions
[42:40.040 --> 42:45.880]  and armed security. I guess you'll be fine. Won't you, De Niro? While the rest of Americans
[42:45.880 --> 42:51.160]  are getting crushed by inflation, crushed by energy prices increasing, crushed by the
[42:51.160 --> 42:55.280]  supply chain crisis, crushed by the taxes and the open borders. But hey, De Niro's
[42:55.280 --> 43:03.120]  doing great. So, I mean, who cares? The Internet and talk radio are on fire with
[43:03.120 --> 43:07.480]  the slogan, Alex Jones was right. People ask, what's it like to be vindicated? Well, it's
[43:07.480 --> 43:13.320]  actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming. I tried to stop it and now
[43:13.320 --> 43:18.560]  everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because the globalist
[43:18.560 --> 43:24.480]  aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents. It's now out in the open.
[43:24.480 --> 43:29.760]  Like Klaus Schwab said last week, that they rule the earth. The Bilderberg Group founded
[43:29.760 --> 43:35.840]  Davos Group. So, now the fight's out in the open. They're making their move because they
[43:35.840 --> 43:39.400]  know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing. God's watching the children
[43:39.400 --> 43:43.480]  counting on us. I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your
[43:43.480 --> 43:47.360]  prayer and your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[43:47.360 --> 43:51.720]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are
[43:51.720 --> 43:55.920]  the reason humanity has a fighting chance. So, I want to thank you and salute you again
[43:55.920 --> 44:22.040]  for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[44:22.040 --> 44:51.560]  Thank you.
[44:52.040 --> 45:04.600]  So, when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds. I was overweight.
[45:04.600 --> 45:09.480]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job and I heard
[45:09.480 --> 45:13.160]  Dr. Group on their show and I listened to it. So, the first one I got was the original
[45:13.160 --> 45:17.480]  survival shield, the X1. And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter, you came
[45:17.480 --> 45:20.640]  out with that. You had, you know, with a deep burden source, you know, and I got really
[45:20.640 --> 45:25.480]  excited about that. So, I took it. And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like
[45:25.480 --> 45:30.640]  literally like my brain was enlightened. You know, I could think again. I could connect
[45:30.640 --> 45:35.440]  with people again. And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back
[45:35.440 --> 45:39.800]  and I religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing
[45:39.800 --> 45:44.120]  supplements. The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just
[45:44.120 --> 45:47.960]  take it. It's amazing. It works. But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves
[45:47.960 --> 45:52.080]  clean. We have to break free of the globalist system. And the only way to do that is to
[45:52.080 --> 45:54.480]  take our own health into our own hands.
[45:54.480 --> 45:59.680]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.

[47:08.440 --> 47:20.840]  So I monitor the liberal news so you don't have to. And there were three big issues last
[47:20.840 --> 47:24.720]  night that they were all covering. It was like MSNBC and CNN were both reading off the
[47:24.720 --> 47:31.720]  same script. It was, we got to take the guns, listen to Matthew McConaughey, big promotions
[47:31.720 --> 47:35.000]  of the January 6th made for TV event that they're going to be running. They're a big
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  propaganda surprise. And then with, there were midterms last night, one of their other
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.240]  big things was calls to address crimes and homelessness and key races. And it was so
[47:44.240 --> 47:48.400]  outrageous, I had to take a picture of it on my phone here, because they're sitting
[47:48.400 --> 47:53.520]  here a bunch of Democrats talking about what they can do to get rid of all the violent
[47:53.520 --> 48:01.160]  crime rates in Democrat cities. And of course, we know the answer is get rid of Democrats.
[48:01.160 --> 48:06.160]  It's that simple. Get rid of Democrats and you'll watch crime go down. They don't seem
[48:06.160 --> 48:12.520]  to understand that yet or they're, but it's, so they admit though, they admit that violent
[48:12.520 --> 48:15.400]  crime is overrunning Democrat run cities and then they have segments saying, well, what
[48:15.400 --> 48:20.000]  can we do about it? Well, it's your fault. So why don't you just leave. But we do have
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.720]  some breaking news right now, a big update. Let's get our latest update on the liberal
[48:24.720 --> 48:40.480]  summer of rage. That's right. It's the liberal summer of rage. Armed man arrested near Supreme
[48:40.480 --> 48:45.720]  Court Justice Kavanaugh's home allegedly made threats against him was another Democrat attempting
[48:45.720 --> 48:51.920]  to commit a political assassination, much like James Hodgkinson. Remember that the media
[48:51.920 --> 48:56.400]  covered that up. They didn't call for gun control after James Hodgkinson. Democrat tried
[48:56.400 --> 49:02.120]  to commit a mass murder of Republicans. Remember that one? Let's see what kind of news coverage
[49:02.120 --> 49:08.760]  a potential attempted assassination of Justice Kavanaugh gets. But guys, let's recall where
[49:08.760 --> 49:14.640]  would an individual get such an idea to go and try to kill Brett Kavanaugh? Guys, maybe
[49:14.640 --> 49:27.760]  we should ask Chuck Schumer. I guess. Oh, okay. We don't have the video. So that's a
[49:27.760 --> 49:34.280]  big swing and a miss for me. Great. All right. Well, I wish I had the video, but it's Chuck
[49:34.280 --> 49:38.320]  Schumer basically threatening Kavanaugh. Maybe we'll have it later. Liberal summer of
[49:38.320 --> 49:45.440]  rage continues. Oh, okay. Let's play it now then. I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want
[49:45.440 --> 49:55.320]  to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price.
[49:55.320 --> 50:02.320]  Democrat terrorists. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.
[50:02.320 --> 50:08.920]  And who are the domestic terrorists again? Democrats. Democrats. Do you know who Kathy
[50:08.920 --> 50:15.920]  Boudin is? Yeah, hear about the weather underground. What was the other gal's name that was running
[50:15.920 --> 50:22.680]  that who then influenced Obama and the Boudins? I mean, literally, the weather underground,
[50:22.680 --> 50:29.000]  a Democrat terrorist group, and then the son of one of those terrorists that killed police,
[50:29.000 --> 50:34.600]  burned billion, building to the ground becomes the San Francisco DA that was just recalled
[50:34.600 --> 50:38.040]  last night. We'll have that coming up, but it's the liberal summer of rage. Buffalo Pro
[50:38.040 --> 50:44.400]  Life Center fire bombed by radical pro-abortion activists. Liberal summer of rage. Vandals
[50:44.400 --> 50:51.160]  leave bloody trail. Red graffiti at pregnancy clinic. Liberal summer of rage. Asheville police.
[50:51.160 --> 50:55.800]  Mountain area pregnancy services vandalized threatened liberal summer of rage. Democrat
[50:55.800 --> 51:01.440]  domestic terrorists. Kelly McBreen asks at infowars.com, what if conservatives fire bombed
[51:01.440 --> 51:05.880]  four Planned Parenthood facilities in a matter of weeks like Democrats just fire bombed pregnancy
[51:05.880 --> 51:09.760]  centers four times this week? It's the liberal summer of rage. They're domestic terrorists,
[51:09.760 --> 51:13.320]  but they're allowed to do it. And you don't get hearings. You don't get arrests. You
[51:13.320 --> 51:19.080]  don't have big made for TV events. Democrats are allowed to be terrorists. Although every
[51:19.080 --> 51:24.640]  once in a while, every once while there is justice, San Diego grand jury indicts 11
[51:24.640 --> 51:28.720]  Tifa militants for attacking Trump supporters during Patriot March and Pacific Beach. Don't
[51:28.720 --> 51:37.480]  worry, they'll get a little slap on the wrist probably. It is the liberal summer of rage.
[51:37.480 --> 51:41.400]  But see, here's MSNBC's Nicole Wallace. She's one of the greatest grifters in the history
[51:41.400 --> 51:45.080]  of television media. She was a Republican during the Bush years, then she was a Democrat
[51:45.080 --> 51:52.880]  during Obama. And now she's just a committed anti-Trump liberal hack. So listen to what
[51:52.880 --> 52:01.000]  she says here in clip 10 about political domestic terrorism replacement theory has become political
[52:01.000 --> 52:08.720]  ideology. Frank, if Mr Whitfield's mother was killed by foreign terrorists, the Democrats
[52:08.720 --> 52:14.640]  and the Republicans on the committee would be promising him the moon. What is I mean,
[52:14.640 --> 52:19.960]  is it as obvious as it seems that domestic violent extremists are an important part
[52:19.960 --> 52:25.200]  of the voting coalition on the right? I mean, what is the structural impediment to hardening
[52:25.200 --> 52:30.360]  the homeland against domestic violent extremism? I know the impediment. The impediment is
[52:30.360 --> 52:35.480]  that you won't admit it's you. You won't admit it's Democrats. You keep trying to stop Republican
[52:35.480 --> 52:41.200]  terrorism. There is none. It's Democrat terrorism. Why don't you re-aim and refocus on the Democrat
[52:41.200 --> 52:46.000]  domestic terrorism? And then you'll find the problem. Let's see. Guy just tried to kill
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.680]  Brett Kavanaugh threatened by Chuck Schumer. Democrat domestic terrorism for pregnancy
[52:50.680 --> 52:55.000]  centers firebomb this week. Democrat domestic terrorism. James Hodgkinson tries to commit
[52:55.000 --> 52:59.760]  a mass murder. Democrat domestic terrorism. Trump supporter killed in Denver. Trump supporter
[52:59.760 --> 53:04.080]  killed in Portland. Trump supporter killed in DC. Democrat domestic terrorism. The entire
[53:04.080 --> 53:10.680]  summer of 2020 Democrat domestic terrorism. I'd love to see the rap sheet. I'd love to
[53:10.680 --> 53:19.560]  see the side by side rap sheet of so called conservative violence versus Democrat liberal
[53:19.560 --> 53:26.360]  violence. Yeah, you would have a 300 page book on Democrat terrorism and you'd have
[53:26.360 --> 53:31.720]  one page on Republicans and that would just be January 6th, which they lie about already
[53:31.720 --> 53:41.560]  anyway. And now Biden's Homeland Security issues heightened threat advisory because
[53:41.560 --> 53:47.960]  of fears of a mass casualty event if Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. So who would
[53:47.960 --> 53:57.800]  be engaging in terrorism and a mass casualty event or a mass casualty violence? Who would
[53:57.800 --> 54:01.440]  be doing that if Roe v. Wade was overturned? Is that going to be conservatives, Republicans
[54:01.440 --> 54:06.320]  or is that going to be Democrats and liberals? So at least Homeland Security is being honest
[54:06.320 --> 54:13.280]  here. Democrats are about to engage in mass terrorism again. So at least there's a bit
[54:13.280 --> 54:16.960]  of honesty there. Democrats going to engage in mass terrorism, but they already are. We're
[54:16.960 --> 54:23.640]  already in the liberal summer of rage. So I guess maybe the Department of Homeland Security
[54:23.640 --> 54:27.920]  is going to try to stop the summer of 2020 from happening again. Maybe when Democrats
[54:27.920 --> 54:35.160]  burned cities to the ground and murdered dozens of people, injured thousands of police summer
[54:35.160 --> 54:39.760]  of 2020. We remember that, right? $2 billion property damage. Thousands of police hospitalized.
[54:39.760 --> 54:45.840]  More than 24 murders. Democrat domestic terrorism. Maybe the DHS wants to stop the Democrat
[54:45.840 --> 54:51.840]  domestic terrorism this time around. Maybe I wouldn't get your hopes up though. Seattle
[54:51.840 --> 54:56.040]  Principal Stonewall police after man terrorized school. Folks, you can't even figure this
[54:56.040 --> 55:03.240]  one out. A guy hops the fence, overloaded on drugs, going around rifling through children's
[55:03.240 --> 55:09.680]  backpacks, harassing them, grabbing them. The guy calls the police. The police show
[55:09.680 --> 55:19.200]  up and then the principal doesn't cooperate with police and lets the guy go. Then one
[55:19.200 --> 55:23.760]  of the kids comes up. The police are sitting there stunned talking to this liberal principal
[55:23.760 --> 55:28.440]  who just let a criminal get away. And then a student comes up and says, oh, he stole
[55:28.440 --> 55:32.400]  my backpack. And then the police say, okay, well, we're going to go arrest him now. And
[55:32.400 --> 55:38.520]  they leave the principal who tried to stop them from doing that. Liberal summer of rage.
[55:38.520 --> 55:46.640]  Swedish city rocked by suspected arson rampage as cars building set ablaze. Diversity, diversity.
[55:46.640 --> 55:51.960]  Liberal summer of rage. One dead, 30 injured after fatal car crash that runs in a crowd
[55:51.960 --> 55:56.480]  beside a church in Berlin. They're saying that they don't think this was a targeted
[55:56.480 --> 56:03.760]  deal, but it's right outside a church. We've seen these events before and well, we'll wait
[56:03.760 --> 56:08.080]  and see. But I think we have a pretty good idea what's causing the violence in Sweden,
[56:08.080 --> 56:21.480]  what's causing the violence in Berlin. It's not locals. No, no, it's not Swedish people.
[56:21.480 --> 56:30.200]  It's not German people. Is it? Here we go. Here's one for you. Um, guys, let's show
[56:30.200 --> 56:35.720]  you clip nine here. Here's a nice youth who, um, he doesn't like white women. So he just
[56:35.720 --> 56:39.760]  decides he's going to knock a white woman out for fun. Here it is in clip nine.
[56:39.760 --> 56:57.120]  It's over. Nice. Listen, this is going to go into the parking lot. Yeah, listen. Listen,
[56:57.120 --> 57:12.680]  this guy ain't gonna smack. Look, this will have you. So any of you bitches fucking that
[57:12.680 --> 57:17.900]  stupid. What a problem white supremacy is. Man. Oh man. If only we could do something
[57:17.900 --> 57:23.200]  about this white supremacy. Notice how nobody around that woman came to her aid either. A
[57:23.200 --> 57:27.000]  couple of black kids just knock her out cold. Everybody stands by and watches because you're
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.080]  not allowed to talk to a black person. You're not allowed to touch a black person. They're
[57:30.080 --> 57:34.920]  a protected class now. Don't you see? No charges will be filed against that individual because
[57:34.920 --> 57:41.220]  whites are the problem. White supremacy is the problem. So, uh, you know, forget the
[57:41.220 --> 57:47.120]  crime statistics, forget what happens in Democrat run cities. No, we're just blaming whites
[57:47.120 --> 58:14.640]  for everything. See, a lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands
[58:14.640 --> 58:34.840]  of people. We've got to say no one's been
[58:34.840 --> 58:36.720]  upset.
[58:36.720 --> 58:41.780]  quality, survival, and preparedness items in stock at low prices ready to ship you right
[58:41.780 --> 58:44.440]  now at preparetoday.com.
[58:44.440 --> 58:48.000]  You can also use the URL, preparewithallix.com, and it takes you there.
[58:48.000 --> 58:49.000]  Take action.
[58:49.000 --> 58:52.120]  You know, it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when
[58:52.120 --> 58:56.120]  the internet and mobile technology first came out, which is, we thought, you know, this
[58:56.120 --> 58:57.800]  is going to level the playing field.
[58:57.800 --> 59:00.160]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information, and everybody's going to be able
[59:00.160 --> 59:02.960]  to freely communicate that information.
[59:02.960 --> 59:08.760]  That's our goal, to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information.
[59:08.760 --> 59:13.800]  We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever
[59:13.800 --> 59:18.680]  we want, and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying
[59:18.680 --> 59:25.920]  to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations
[59:25.920 --> 59:30.920]  we're having, because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions,
[59:30.920 --> 59:33.400]  the people we want to talk to about these things.
[59:33.400 --> 59:37.600]  So that's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take
[59:37.600 --> 59:38.600]  back their privacy.
[59:38.600 --> 59:43.960]  And so that's really what we're trying to do, and so I hope that everybody listening will
[59:43.960 --> 1:00:10.800]  check us out at boltowireless.com, that's v-o-l-t-a-wireless.com.
[1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:40.320]  Thank you.
[1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:43.240]  And so Infowars has a solution, folks.
[1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:47.060]  We don't want you to go into this unprepared or blind, so that's why we're informing you
[1:00:47.060 --> 1:00:53.200]  and now arming you with the tools to prepare yourself for what many view now as an inevitable
[1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:54.200]  collapse.
[1:00:54.200 --> 1:01:01.520]  Please, all of you out there watching and listening, remember how many times I've been
[1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:02.520]  right.
[1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:06.720]  Remember how many times I told you exactly what was going to happen and it did happen.
[1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:11.760]  Thirty months ago, I told you there'd be worldwide food shortages and massive inflation because
[1:01:11.760 --> 1:01:17.040]  I was reading what BlackRock and the Bilderberg Group and the Davos Group were actually talking
[1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:18.040]  about.
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:23.200]  Not in their public statements, but in their policy reports that are public, but not widely
[1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:24.200]  distributed.
[1:01:24.200 --> 1:01:28.240]  So the biggest thing you can do now is get high-quality swirble food and it's back in
[1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:31.360]  stock ready to ship right now.
[1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:35.600]  So write down this URL I'm about to give you and take action and protect yourself and
[1:01:35.600 --> 1:01:36.600]  your family.
[1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:43.920]  Don't be dependent on the system with the storm that's coming and that's already here.
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:47.240]  PrepareToday.com.
[1:01:47.240 --> 1:01:52.640]  That is one of the most important URLs for your future and the future of your security
[1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:55.120]  and your stability and your independence.
[1:01:55.120 --> 1:02:00.840]  Now, folks, you know for decades I have believed in survival and preparation.
[1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:04.800]  I believe we should grow gardens and should know how to use firearms and should know how
[1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:08.960]  to fix electrical systems, you name it, because going into the future if the globalists have
[1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:14.280]  their way and they now are, during the Great Reset, most of the major infrastructure is
[1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:16.560]  going to be slowly shut down.
[1:02:16.560 --> 1:02:18.240]  So we've got to get ahead of that curve.
[1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:22.320]  Now, swirble food is always a must-have.
[1:02:22.320 --> 1:02:26.040]  There's a lot of fly-by-night companies out there, but I've always gone out and found
[1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:30.720]  the very best sponsors and the very best products to bring to you, the very products that I've
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:32.800]  researched that I use.
[1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:37.280]  And instead of just going to infoworkstore.com, which still has the products linked on it,
[1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:44.360]  we have created with some great partners, preparetoday.com, so it's a one-stop shop,
[1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:49.640]  not just of the highest quality swirble food with the largest selections, but also hundreds
[1:02:49.640 --> 1:02:54.440]  and hundreds of great survival and preparedness items at the lowest prices you're going to
[1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:55.440]  find anywhere.
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:59.800]  And it also sponsors InfoWars, it keeps the First Amendment and the fight against the
[1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:02.800]  New World Order going, so it's a 360 win.
[1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:10.880]  You can also follow PrepareWithAlex.com and that URL now points at PrepareToday.com.
[1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:16.560]  All of you that the last 30 months went out and bought swirble food made such a great
[1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:17.560]  decision.
[1:03:17.560 --> 1:03:21.680]  Food prices are up over 30% in the U.S. and even higher in other parts of the world and
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:23.200]  they're only going up.
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:26.000]  That's not a safe bet, that is a guaranteed.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:30.480]  The central banks of the world have done this by design to bring the people to their knees.
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:34.240]  So when I told people at the beginning of the COVID lockdowns that it was going to cause
[1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:37.440]  worldwide food shortages and collapse, we were right.
[1:03:37.440 --> 1:03:42.040]  And those of you that bought swirble food in the last few years have saved a lot of money.
[1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:45.440]  I would get involved now and get your swirble food taken care of and other preparedness
[1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:50.560]  items and preparetoday.com while you still can and keep it in force in the air.
[1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:52.280]  Preparetoday.com.
[1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:55.880]  Don't procrastinate, don't wait, don't be dependent on the system.
[1:03:55.880 --> 1:03:57.360]  So there you go, folks.
[1:03:57.360 --> 1:03:58.360]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:00.720]  I don't know how bad it's going to get.
[1:04:00.720 --> 1:04:02.080]  It's not going to get better though.
[1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:04.760]  Not with Democrats around, not with Joe Biden in the White House.
[1:04:04.760 --> 1:04:14.320]  So smart people are really kind of looking at their current situation and saying, hmm,
[1:04:14.320 --> 1:04:15.320]  what should I do?
[1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:16.320]  Do I have storeable food?
[1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:19.800]  Do I have an energy source?
[1:04:19.800 --> 1:04:21.800]  Am I going to be stuck in this inner city?
[1:04:21.800 --> 1:04:25.000]  Do I have land that I can live off of?
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  These are all the questions.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:27.200]  Do I have a preparedness kit?
[1:04:27.200 --> 1:04:31.240]  These are all the questions people are asking because that's how bad America is now under
[1:04:31.240 --> 1:04:33.120]  Joe Biden.
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:35.800]  Maybe worse than it's ever been.
[1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:45.480]  And man, oh man, if it wasn't our committed duty to be here every day, I'd probably be
[1:04:45.480 --> 1:04:47.360]  getting out into the woods.
[1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:52.720]  I would probably be finding whatever part of this country that puts me the farthest
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:54.200]  away from a Democrat liberal.
[1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:59.800]  I don't want to be anywhere near these psychotics, not even close to them.
[1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:03.040]  PrepareToday.com.
[1:05:03.040 --> 1:05:04.840]  PrepareToday.com.
[1:05:04.840 --> 1:05:09.520]  We have created a one stop shop to get the highest quality storeable foods ready to ship

[1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:27.360]  our huge sponsor, funding or operation.
[1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:32.080]  So Americans and others can get ready, be self sufficient and fund the info award while
[1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:37.040]  saving massive amounts of money on critical items they need and of course getting things
[1:05:37.040 --> 1:05:39.800]  delivered to them quickly because it's in stock.

[1:05:48.800 --> 1:05:50.800]  Or it was just a backup plan and insurance.
[1:05:50.800 --> 1:05:51.800]  This is an insurance.
[1:05:51.800 --> 1:05:53.200]  This is survival.
[1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:55.360]  PrepareToday.com.
[1:05:55.360 --> 1:06:00.640]  PrepareToday.com and I'll see you there.

[1:06:09.440 --> 1:06:13.160]  We've not been selling food for three months because it was taking several weeks for the
[1:06:13.160 --> 1:06:15.360]  food to get packaged and delivered to you.
[1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:19.960]  Other companies are completely out but now they have a large spectrum of high quality

[1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:38.320]  With the inflation happening, with the food shortages, with the wars, with the collapse
[1:06:38.320 --> 1:06:42.240]  in wars, everything's happening is one of the most important as you can make is to have
[1:06:42.240 --> 1:06:46.080]  high quality storeable food, water filtration, air filtration and more and it's not just
[1:06:46.080 --> 1:06:50.440]  those items, it's hundreds of other high quality preparedness items and survival items right
[1:06:50.440 --> 1:06:56.360]  now at PrepareWithAlex.com that again redirects to PrepareToday.com.
[1:06:56.360 --> 1:06:59.360]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important things you can do
[1:06:59.360 --> 1:07:06.840]  is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning.
[1:07:06.840 --> 1:07:14.640]  PrepareToday.com now is the time folks and with what we see going on at the southern
[1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:18.880]  border it's only going to get worse, it's only going to get worse.
[1:07:18.880 --> 1:07:26.280]  And now the Mexican president is basically deciding he's going to facilitate the invasion
[1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:29.720]  of America too because he doesn't know what else to do because they invade his country
[1:07:29.720 --> 1:07:36.600]  just to come up to America, they expel resources and energy and effort and manpower to try
[1:07:36.600 --> 1:07:38.480]  to stop their country from being invaded.
[1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:42.760]  Well now they're just saying, all right, if you're coming into Mexico to get to America
[1:07:42.760 --> 1:07:47.280]  we're going to streamline it and we're going to give you your paperwork so you can just
[1:07:47.280 --> 1:07:50.120]  come right in and go right up.
[1:07:50.120 --> 1:07:52.640]  There used to be a bit of a process, there used to be some obstacles there, they're
[1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:53.960]  getting rid of all the obstacles.
[1:07:53.960 --> 1:07:56.840]  I don't even blame the Mexican president for this quite frankly, he's trying to take
[1:07:56.840 --> 1:08:01.640]  care of his country so I understand why he's doing it.
[1:08:01.640 --> 1:08:06.840]  So he's basically just like, all right, fine, Biden wants to have a facilitate an invasion
[1:08:06.840 --> 1:08:10.560]  and drug trafficking and child sex trafficking in the southern border, fine.
[1:08:10.560 --> 1:08:15.480]  I'm not going to let that hurt my country though so people come through my country,
[1:08:15.480 --> 1:08:19.000]  we're just going to usher them right through it, we're not going to, we're just going to
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:23.880]  just say, okay, you're in, here's your paperwork, just go on through.
[1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:33.640]  So that's nice, caravan leader Luis Villagran, caravan leader, who do you think pays him,
[1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:38.400]  tells Fox News that Mexico will be issuing 1000 temp work visas a day to the migrants
[1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:43.680]  starting tomorrow, which means they can travel freely through Mexico and many will simply
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:47.360]  head to the US border.
[1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:53.600]  Hey, look, someone's invading our country, whoa, that's just Democrat party policy,
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:59.960]  calm down, pull 73% of Trump voters believe Democrats are trying to replace white Americans
[1:08:59.960 --> 1:09:03.240]  with immigrants who vote for them, absolutely correct.
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:07.560]  And so that's just a sign that people are waking up and they know what the Democrats
[1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:11.520]  are up to, because that's exactly what they're doing.
[1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:14.440]  That is 100% exactly what they're doing.
[1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:19.840]  It's a, it's a humanitarian issue any other way you slice it.
[1:09:19.840 --> 1:09:25.000]  But when it's Democrats looking for votes, then it's a good thing, see how that works.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:29.600]  So yeah, the kids getting raped and trafficked and the drug abuse and everything, you know,
[1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:34.080]  that's a small price to pay for, for Democrat power, small price to pay for Democrats to
[1:09:34.080 --> 1:09:35.840]  remain in power.
[1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:39.920]  Caravan leader calls on some of the America's attendees to work out migrant focused immigration
[1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:40.920]  agenda.
[1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:44.600]  This thing's a complete joke folks, the America, the summit of the Americas.
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:45.800]  I don't think Biden's going to attend it.
[1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:48.600]  The Mexican president said he's not intending it.
[1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:54.120]  So it's all a joke, basically it was supposed to be a serious thing to deal with the fact
[1:09:54.120 --> 1:10:00.360]  it's like 25% of the Central American population has now illegally immigrated into the United
[1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:03.160]  States of America in the last decade.
[1:10:03.160 --> 1:10:07.960]  So they're going to have this big summit to kind of hash it out and work it out.
[1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:10.760]  And the Mexican president was like, what is this a joke?
[1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:12.600]  We know what the problem here is.
[1:10:12.600 --> 1:10:14.320]  The problem is United States politicians.
[1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:16.840]  The problem is the U.S. has a wide open border and a welfare state.
[1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:17.840]  That's the problem here.
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:22.960]  So if you're not going to address that, then I'm not showing up to your summit.
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:26.520]  In Snub to Biden, Mexico's president won't attend U.S. hosted summit of the Americas.
[1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:27.880]  Well why would he?
[1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:30.560]  Why would you waste your time with liars like Joe Biden?
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:33.640]  Why would you waste your time with criminals like the Democrats?
[1:10:33.640 --> 1:10:34.640]  You wouldn't.
[1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:36.600]  And so he's not.
[1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:40.280]  So America says, oh, we're going to have this summit to address why all these Central Americans
[1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:41.640]  are moving to America.
[1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:45.200]  And the Mexican president says, we know why they're going to America because you're telling
[1:10:45.200 --> 1:10:47.320]  them to and you're giving them free stuff.
[1:10:47.320 --> 1:10:51.880]  So if you're not going to be honest about that, then I'm out.
[1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:55.400]  Smuggler caught transporting kidnapped migrant baby in Texas.
[1:10:55.400 --> 1:10:59.960]  HSI agents rescue one year old girl from human smuggler bound for Dallas.
[1:10:59.960 --> 1:11:00.960]  What do you think?
[1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:05.240]  What do you think that girl's life was going to be like?
[1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:08.440]  What do you think her future would have been?
[1:11:08.440 --> 1:11:10.160]  Another victim of Democrat politics.
[1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:13.200]  She probably would have been a sex slave the rest of her life.
[1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:15.080]  Thank a Democrat for that.
[1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:18.440]  We build the wall trial ends in mistrial jury deadlocked.
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:22.360]  This is actually a very important thing, folks.
[1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:25.080]  Democrats try to rig court cases.
[1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:32.120]  And so they had 11 liberals on this New York jury and one conservative.
[1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:38.240]  And they were trying to destroy this man who funded the we build the wall thing.
[1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:41.400]  And then they had a bunch of false claims, false accusations saying he stole the money.
[1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:43.960]  It was all fake.
[1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:44.960]  Timothy Shea.
[1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:45.960]  It was all fake.
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:50.600]  It was all just liberal smears and Democrat attacks.
[1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:53.560]  And so the left knew that they weren't going to win the case.
[1:11:53.560 --> 1:11:55.640]  The Democrats knew they weren't going to win this case on merit.
[1:11:55.640 --> 1:11:57.040]  They weren't going to win the case on fact.
[1:11:57.040 --> 1:11:59.960]  The only way they could win the case was to rig it and cheat just like everything else
[1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:01.560]  Democrats do.
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:08.860]  So when they found out they had one conservative on the jury, they fought for weeks to kick
[1:12:08.860 --> 1:12:11.920]  him off the jury.
[1:12:11.920 --> 1:12:18.400]  And then it even got so bad that the judge had to sit down with the juror because the
[1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:20.520]  judge was just hearing crazy stuff about the juror.
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:22.560]  So the judge was like, all right, well, maybe this is a concern.
[1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:23.560]  I'll listen.
[1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:27.800]  Judge sat down with the juror and said, hmm, these liberal jurors lied to me.
[1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:29.520]  There's nothing wrong with this juror at all.
[1:12:29.520 --> 1:12:30.520]  He stands.
[1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:33.320]  He saved an innocent man's life, Timothy Shea.
[1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:36.800]  Timothy Shea would have been another political prisoner of the Democrat Party if it wasn't
[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:41.480]  for one conservative nullifying the jury.
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:44.840]  So there's a lot of important lessons to learn there, folks.
[1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:52.720]  And do not, do not forget the importance of jury nullification.
[1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:55.600]  Thousands of unvaccinated border patrol agents fear for their future.
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:56.600]  Yeah.
[1:12:56.600 --> 1:12:59.600]  Oh, you're going to get fired from your job in the Biden administration if you don't
[1:12:59.600 --> 1:13:00.680]  take a vaccine.
[1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:04.440]  But all the immigrants coming here illegally, are they vaccinated?
[1:13:04.440 --> 1:13:05.440]  No.
[1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:06.440]  Do they have to be vaccinated?
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:07.540]  No.
[1:13:07.540 --> 1:13:13.840]  But the border patrol that that is the now human traffic control, the border patrol is
[1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:17.360]  now the human trafficking control run by Joe Biden.
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:20.800]  And they have to be vaccinated, though, or they lose their job.
[1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:23.760]  And of course, this is all just more of the purge.
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:27.280]  This is all just more of the purge that we know is going on.
[1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:30.400]  In fact, Jim Jordan is talking about this now.
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:32.480]  Let me come to that briefly.
[1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:39.960]  Nightwing populist in Sweden proposed the repatriation, re-immigration of the hundreds
[1:13:39.960 --> 1:13:45.280]  of thousands of Syrians, Afghans and Somalis that have failed to integrate in Sweden are
[1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:48.280]  long term unemployed and live on state benefits.
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:50.240]  Absolutely that's common sense.
[1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:53.480]  If you're just going to come here and suck off our system and destroy our culture and
[1:13:53.480 --> 1:13:56.520]  destroy our cities, you're not welcome here.
[1:13:56.520 --> 1:14:01.320]  And that's what 90% of this immigration is now because it's it's not even immigration.
[1:14:01.320 --> 1:14:07.200]  It's it's political weapons systems and invasions.
[1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:10.680]  Remember the story we just read fire bombings for an entire week in Sweden?
[1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:16.400]  Yeah, those are the illegal immigrants that go there and just and just muck things up
[1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:19.120]  and have no go zones and rape women.
[1:14:19.120 --> 1:14:20.800]  So they're saying, hey, why are we letting these people here?
[1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:21.800]  They don't care about Sweden.
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:23.520]  They don't they don't appreciate our culture.
[1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:26.360]  They just rape our women, steal our stuff, burn our buildings to the ground.
[1:14:26.360 --> 1:14:28.320]  Why would we want them here?
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:30.480]  Liberals, that's why.
[1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:31.880]  And so here's Jim Jordan.
[1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:36.120]  New whistleblowers alleged the FBI is purging conservatives at the Bureau.
[1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:39.960]  One agent they purged was a decorated war veteran who served in Iraq and Kuwait.
[1:14:39.960 --> 1:14:43.480]  The FBI had the audacity to question the whistleblowers loyalty to the country.
[1:14:43.480 --> 1:14:46.640]  Now, Jim Jordan lays it all out here.
[1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:56.480]  But the brief of it is like, I don't know what's going on with this FBI seizing the retired
[1:14:56.480 --> 1:15:00.560]  general's data related to Qatar lobbying, I'll come up and cover that later.
[1:15:00.560 --> 1:15:04.840]  Is that an example of a good FBI agent that's still left that hasn't been purged by the
[1:15:04.840 --> 1:15:08.200]  deep state or is there something else going on here?
[1:15:08.200 --> 1:15:11.600]  But what Jim Jordan is talking about.
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:14.600]  And you know, I know a little bit about this because I'm involved, but I'll just leave
[1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:16.500]  it at that for now.
[1:15:16.500 --> 1:15:19.880]  There are many FBI agents that know January 6th as bull crap.
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:24.240]  There are many FBI agents that know the Democrat party is the worst thing in this country.
[1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:30.120]  And so the leadership at the FBI and Merrick Garland and the Biden administration and Chris
[1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:34.800]  Ray is doing everything they can to make sure there are no Republicans, no conservatives
[1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:39.160]  and no Christians in the FBI, because they know they can't do what they want to do if
[1:15:39.160 --> 1:15:43.200]  they have conservatives or Christians in the FBI.
[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:44.400]  And what do they want to do?
[1:15:44.400 --> 1:15:49.560]  They want to target, harass, destroy, imprison their political opposition.
[1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:50.920]  Christians won't do that.
[1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:51.920]  Conservatives won't do that.
[1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:52.920]  So what is the FBI doing?
[1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:53.920]  What is Chris Ray doing?
[1:15:53.920 --> 1:15:57.360]  They're purging anybody who won't commit crimes for the Democrat party.
[1:15:57.360 --> 1:16:02.880]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands of great items
[1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:05.520]  at m4store.com, all the storeable food.
[1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:09.480]  So we've made it easy with our great partners that supply us with the highest quality storeable

[1:16:20.040 --> 1:16:22.560]  is already unfolding with level food shortages.
[1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:26.840]  I told you over two years ago, the global screen will have massive inflation and food
[1:16:26.840 --> 1:16:30.000]  shortages and it's happened just like clockwork.
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.400]  And I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse.
[1:16:32.400 --> 1:16:33.400]  They have designed this.
[1:16:33.400 --> 1:16:39.280]  The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued.

[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:17.320]  fight without your support.

[1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:05.440]  designs still for sale at M4WARS.com.

[1:19:55.400 --> 1:19:59.880]  Thank you so much for your support, please take action.
[1:19:59.880 --> 1:20:05.720]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:29.880 --> 1:20:37.600]  FBI seizes retired general's data related to Qatar lobbying and it's a big money laundering
[1:20:37.600 --> 1:20:43.280]  operation that got caught.
[1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:49.820]  That may also involve Eric Swalwell, here's some flashbacks, Eric Swalwell posed shirtless
[1:20:49.820 --> 1:20:55.520]  during pricey paid for Qatar trip, Swalwell had meetings with Qatari charity tied to terrorist
[1:20:55.520 --> 1:20:56.520]  groups.
[1:20:56.520 --> 1:21:02.000]  Was Swalwell involved in this crime as well?
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:10.920]  But here's the thing, I find amazing about this, as they caught a forced dollar general
[1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:14.680]  making false statements and withholding incriminating documents and it looks like they were, well
[1:21:14.680 --> 1:21:20.720]  they were illegally lobbying in foreign countries and basically just stealing and laundering
[1:21:20.720 --> 1:21:24.280]  money, was Swalwell involved in that.
[1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:28.200]  We never get justice in situations like this, they're stealing and robbing money in Ukraine
[1:21:28.200 --> 1:21:29.840]  right now, there's not going to be any justice.
[1:21:29.840 --> 1:21:37.760]  So I'm just skeptical as to why this is the story and why they're upset about this slush
[1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:43.520]  fund, this money laundering that's going on in Qatar when it goes on everywhere and has
[1:21:43.520 --> 1:21:44.520]  for decades.
[1:21:44.520 --> 1:21:45.520]  Why this?
[1:21:45.520 --> 1:21:46.520]  Why are they going after this guy?
[1:21:46.520 --> 1:21:49.040]  Is it just so happens that there's one good FBI agent that's doing this?
[1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:53.320]  Is it the one good FBI agent left or is there something else going on?
[1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:54.720]  Will anybody pay the price?
[1:21:54.720 --> 1:21:58.640]  Will Eric Swalwell be questioned?
[1:21:58.640 --> 1:22:07.080]  So that's a developing news story that we will be paying attention to.
[1:22:07.080 --> 1:22:12.320]  George Soros backed groups have spent 40 million to elect 75 progressive prosecutors over the
[1:22:12.320 --> 1:22:17.080]  last decade, meaning one in five Americans now live in areas covered by his criminal
[1:22:17.080 --> 1:22:18.960]  justice reforms.
[1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:20.800]  That's why things are getting so violent.
[1:22:20.800 --> 1:22:26.520]  San Francisco votes overwhelmingly to recall progressive DA Chesa Boudin, the son of known
[1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:31.840]  Democrat terrorist, Kathy Boudin, who was part of the weather underground that murdered
[1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:34.080]  police and burned buildings to the ground.
[1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:37.440]  It's Democrats, they're terrorists, they don't change, they just get into office and get
[1:22:37.440 --> 1:22:38.440]  power.
[1:22:38.440 --> 1:22:42.760]  They never stop, they never stop.
[1:22:42.760 --> 1:22:47.200]  And by the way, there's examples now where there's criminals that are in jail in San
[1:22:47.200 --> 1:22:53.480]  Francisco like, I think Will Wilkerson is one of them, who their attorneys are now moving
[1:22:53.480 --> 1:22:59.480]  as quickly as possible to get their court case wrapped up before Boudin leaves office
[1:22:59.480 --> 1:23:04.160]  because they know as long as Boudin is in office, they're going to get off scot-free.
[1:23:04.160 --> 1:23:08.320]  So you've got all these criminals in jail right now that are pumping the gas with their
[1:23:08.320 --> 1:23:11.440]  lawyers saying, hey, we got to get, we got to get a decision here while Boudin is still
[1:23:11.440 --> 1:23:14.880]  in office because he's pro-crime, he's pro-criminal.
[1:23:14.880 --> 1:23:17.160]  So that's going on.
[1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:21.440]  As you see all this stuff happening with January 6th and the made-for-TV event coming
[1:23:21.440 --> 1:23:28.640]  up tomorrow night, never forget Michigan, Whitmer Hokes Defendant, we beat them, we got justice.
[1:23:28.640 --> 1:23:31.480]  Never forget what they did in Michigan.
[1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:37.280]  The FBI setting up innocent men, the FBI plotting to kidnap the governor and then giving that
[1:23:37.280 --> 1:23:42.800]  plot to other men that they set up, well, they won that case, they got caught.
[1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:49.640]  And then the one FBI agent that was running that operation, he then ran the January 6th
[1:23:49.640 --> 1:23:50.640]  operation.
[1:23:50.640 --> 1:23:51.640]  And remember what they did?
[1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:53.080]  They'd said, oh, they made a big fuss.
[1:23:53.080 --> 1:23:55.800]  Remember, they said, oh, look, someone's going to try to kidnap the governor.
[1:23:55.800 --> 1:23:57.560]  It was an FBI plot.
[1:23:57.560 --> 1:24:00.720]  The media made a big fuss of it saying, see, conservatives are terrorists.
[1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:02.560]  They were going to capture the governor.
[1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:04.600]  It was an FBI plot.
[1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:07.840]  They were found innocent.
[1:24:07.840 --> 1:24:08.960]  And then what happens?
[1:24:08.960 --> 1:24:13.760]  Even Democrats show up at Supreme Court Justice's house to kill them, and the media doesn't
[1:24:13.760 --> 1:24:18.240]  cover it.
[1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:23.920]  Bloomberg News complains nobody cares about January 6th as Democrats prepare televised
[1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:24.920]  hearings.
[1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:26.680]  Even Bloomberg knows it's bull crap.
[1:24:26.680 --> 1:24:29.080]  Yeah, most people are struggling to pay their bills.
[1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:33.840]  You think they care about Democrat party politics and whaling and the gnashing of the teeth
[1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:36.640]  and the evil and the hatred of the Democrats?
[1:24:36.640 --> 1:24:40.880]  Many of Proud Boys indicted for sedition were U.S. military veterans.
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:42.480]  Who warned you they were going to come for the veterans?
[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:44.440]  Who warned you the veterans were their top target?
[1:24:44.440 --> 1:24:48.120]  That would be right here at InfoWars, Alex Jones.
[1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:53.160]  Matt Gaetz says, I would rather trim Pelosi's toenails with my teeth than dying with Adam
[1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:54.160]  Schiff.
[1:24:54.160 --> 1:25:01.760]  Boy, oh boy, Schiff must be a real piece of shit if that's how he feels.
[1:25:01.760 --> 1:25:03.960]  How's Ron Johnson doing?
[1:25:03.960 --> 1:25:08.160]  Arthur Delaney from The Huffington Post asked Ron Johnson about waiting periods for gun
[1:25:08.160 --> 1:25:09.760]  sales to buyers under 21.
[1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:15.040]  Ron Johnson said, before we pass anything new, let's enforce the laws we already have.
[1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:17.360]  Let's start with Hunter Biden.
[1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:21.320]  No, Democrats are above the law.
[1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:23.240]  Don't you see?
[1:25:23.240 --> 1:25:26.640]  Democrats are above the law.
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:28.080]  You're not allowed to do that.
[1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:33.640]  And then there was a host on The View who was basically trying to tell The View, hey,
[1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:38.200]  you know, people don't really care about this January 6th stuff like you psychotics do.
[1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:41.360]  And you know, I don't know why this went so viral, quite frankly.
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:44.360]  I don't really think it's that hot of a clip.
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:48.480]  But what is funny about it is while this lady is talking, they try to shut her down.
[1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:51.640]  They try to interrupt her because she's just saying facts.
[1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:56.360]  But the look on the liberals' faces, like right there, the look on their faces as this
[1:25:56.360 --> 1:26:00.840]  woman is trying to tell them, hey, you know, most of the stuff you believe nobody else
[1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:01.840]  believes.
[1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:04.120]  Most of the stuff that you talk about nobody else cares about.
[1:26:04.120 --> 1:26:08.000]  You guys are living in a delusional land, I'm paraphrasing.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:11.680]  But it's just so funny to listen to them constantly trying to interrupt her from telling the truth.
[1:26:11.680 --> 1:26:17.160]  And then the shocked look on their face that somebody would be on their set and not saying
[1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:19.560]  January 6th is the worst thing that ever happened to America.
[1:26:19.560 --> 1:26:21.200]  I mean, just look at their faces.
[1:26:21.200 --> 1:26:22.200]  Here's the clip.
[1:26:22.200 --> 1:26:23.200]  Don't look somewhere else.
[1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:26.560]  No, I think the average Fox News viewer has been seeing for a year and a half this play
[1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:28.440]  out over and over again.
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:30.000]  Rioters attack our capital.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:33.040]  We've seen it on every single channel, even Fox Local, if you watch that.
[1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:35.280]  So people understand exactly what happened.
[1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:37.400]  And so what is the smoking gun here?
[1:26:37.400 --> 1:26:38.640]  What is the breaking news?
[1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:43.800]  I know what people will turn in once the Department of Justice says, OK, here are the charges.
[1:26:43.800 --> 1:26:45.280]  Well, I have to disagree with you there.
[1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:46.280]  Wait, wait, wait.
[1:26:46.280 --> 1:26:47.280]  Let me finish.
[1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:48.280]  We want some criminal charges if that's what you want.
[1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:49.280]  That's what we'll see next.
[1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:51.160]  We're not even going to see that in these nine hearings.
[1:26:51.160 --> 1:26:55.080]  And then if we think about the actual intention of this, there's a sentiment that Democrats
[1:26:55.080 --> 1:26:57.880]  need to rebrand this midterm message, right?
[1:26:57.880 --> 1:27:01.520]  So by airing this, you're going to remind everybody like, hey, Trump is aligned with
[1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:02.520]  other conservatives.
[1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:06.280]  And even though that's not always true, there's plenty of people who spoke out against this.
[1:27:06.280 --> 1:27:10.000]  And so now reminder, don't vote for these people in the midterms because you want to
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  keep the majority.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:14.680]  And I think that that is a losing message by looking in the past and not looking in the
[1:27:14.680 --> 1:27:17.720]  future because there's things on top of mind for people.
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:20.800]  There are things like feeding your baby, which I talked about yesterday.
[1:27:20.800 --> 1:27:24.440]  There are things on top of mind like people wanted to know a recession is looming.
[1:27:24.440 --> 1:27:28.000]  There are things on top of mind like wondering how to pay for your gas.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.760]  Whoa, they didn't like that.
[1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:33.040]  They didn't like that.
[1:27:33.040 --> 1:27:34.040]  You saw their face.
[1:27:34.040 --> 1:27:35.800]  You saw them trying to stop her from talking.
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:38.360]  No, Democrats love corruption.
[1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:39.600]  Democrats love corruption.
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:40.760]  They just love it.
[1:27:40.760 --> 1:27:45.000]  They love the January 6th campaign because they know it's going to target their opposition
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  illegitimately.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  They love it.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.480]  Those women at the view are psychotic.
[1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:51.880]  And so you saw their face as she was laying all of it out.
[1:27:51.880 --> 1:27:53.320]  They just did not like that.
[1:27:53.320 --> 1:27:54.320]  Did they?
[1:27:54.320 --> 1:27:59.640]  Or were they angry that not everyone is a psychotic leftist like the host of the view
[1:27:59.640 --> 1:28:03.240]  that want to see innocent Americans rot in a jail cell?
[1:28:03.240 --> 1:28:06.920]  How are the ladies at the view like being politically persecuted?
[1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:10.000]  How are the ladies at the view like to be censored?
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:15.760]  How are the ladies at the view like to have discovery done on them and prods done on them?
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:16.760]  How would they like that?
[1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:20.120]  I don't think they'd like it too much, but they love doing it to you.
[1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:22.680]  They love doing it to their political opposition, don't they?
[1:28:22.680 --> 1:28:24.480]  Yes, they do.
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:28.040]  Man, oh man, what a shame.
[1:28:28.040 --> 1:28:30.440]  What a shame we're dealing with these psychotics.
[1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:34.680]  So they have their made for TV event today telling you because kids died, you have to
[1:28:34.680 --> 1:28:40.880]  turn your gun in, and then they've got their made for TV event tomorrow night.
[1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:45.920]  Democrats caused riots on January 6th so that they could blame Trump, blame Republicans,
[1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:49.400]  arrest their political opposition, silence their political opposition, disarm their political
[1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:50.400]  opposition.
[1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:55.560]  In history, I know groups that did stuff like that, like the Nazis, that's right, there
[1:28:55.560 --> 1:28:58.800]  was a Nazis that did that, now it's the Democrats.
[1:28:58.800 --> 1:29:04.120]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[1:29:04.120 --> 1:29:05.960]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[1:29:05.960 --> 1:29:11.800]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming, I tried to stop it,
[1:29:11.800 --> 1:29:16.880]  and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:23.040]  the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents, it's now out
[1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:24.040]  on the open.
[1:29:24.040 --> 1:29:29.360]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[1:29:29.360 --> 1:29:30.360]  Group.
[1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:35.320]  So now the fight's out in the open, they're making their move because they know they're
[1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:36.320]  behind schedule.
[1:29:36.320 --> 1:29:37.320]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:29:37.320 --> 1:29:39.280]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:43.080]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[1:29:43.080 --> 1:29:46.560]  your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:29:46.560 --> 1:29:50.880]  So I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the
[1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:53.160]  reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:29:53.160 --> 1:29:57.680]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[1:29:57.680 --> 1:29:59.120]  your efforts.

[1:32:08.840 --> 1:32:11.840]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:32:11.840 --> 1:32:12.840]  Good, bro.
[1:32:12.840 --> 1:32:13.840]  Great last caller.
[1:32:13.840 --> 1:32:14.840]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[1:32:14.840 --> 1:32:15.840]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization
[1:32:15.840 --> 1:32:16.840]  and absurdity.
[1:32:16.840 --> 1:32:17.840]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:18.840]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[1:32:18.840 --> 1:32:19.840]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[1:32:19.840 --> 1:32:20.840]  Go ahead.
[1:32:20.840 --> 1:32:21.840]  Hey, Alex.
[1:32:21.840 --> 1:32:22.840]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:32:22.840 --> 1:32:24.840]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[1:32:24.840 --> 1:32:25.840]  The X2 does wonders.
[1:32:25.840 --> 1:32:26.840]  I recommend it to everybody.
[1:32:26.840 --> 1:32:27.840]  You're on the fence about it.
[1:32:27.840 --> 1:32:28.840]  Get off the fence.
[1:32:28.840 --> 1:32:29.840]  Get the product.
[1:32:29.840 --> 1:32:31.840]  Support the info war.
[1:32:31.840 --> 1:32:32.840]  Tyler in Maine.
[1:32:32.840 --> 1:32:33.840]  You're on the air.
[1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:34.840]  Thanks for rolling.
[1:32:34.840 --> 1:32:35.840]  Go ahead.
[1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:36.840]  Hey, Alex.
[1:32:36.840 --> 1:32:37.840]  It's great to be on with you.
[1:32:37.840 --> 1:32:38.840]  It's an honor.
[1:32:38.840 --> 1:32:39.840]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[1:32:39.840 --> 1:32:40.840]  Awesome.
[1:32:40.840 --> 1:32:44.840]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products, alpha power, even at 29.
[1:32:44.840 --> 1:32:49.840]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom, so just number one
[1:32:49.840 --> 1:32:50.840]  for a few of you.
[1:32:50.840 --> 1:32:51.840]  It definitely works.
[1:32:51.840 --> 1:32:52.840]  It's not a joke.
[1:32:52.840 --> 1:32:53.840]  Absolutely.
[1:32:53.840 --> 1:33:00.840]  It's not a joke.
[1:33:24.840 --> 1:33:35.840]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer, and joined by journalist Taylor Hanson, who unfortunately
[1:33:35.840 --> 1:33:43.040]  had to witness the shooting, the killing of Ashley Babbitt at her blood on his hands
[1:33:43.040 --> 1:33:44.040]  that day.
[1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:48.760]  He had to witness the Democrat Michael Byrd killing Ashley Babbitt.
[1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:54.600]  But Taylor, there have been some new developments in this case because it turns out, once again,
[1:33:54.600 --> 1:33:55.720]  they lied.
[1:33:55.720 --> 1:33:57.080]  They lied again.
[1:33:57.080 --> 1:34:02.080]  They said, which you already knew that because you were there, they said they did an investigation
[1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:03.480]  into Byrd.
[1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:05.800]  Turns out there's no proof of that investigation.
[1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:08.920]  They claimed that Byrd warned Ashley Babbitt.
[1:34:08.920 --> 1:34:09.920]  Nope.
[1:34:09.920 --> 1:34:10.920]  That didn't happen either.
[1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:15.320]  Judicial Watch forces release of DOJ memo, declining criminal prosecution for Ashley
[1:34:15.320 --> 1:34:19.920]  Babbitt killer Michael Byrd, Babbitt shooting evidence missing, so as long as you're a Democrat
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:22.160]  police officer, you can kill whoever you want.
[1:34:22.160 --> 1:34:23.720]  I guess that's the story here.
[1:34:23.720 --> 1:34:28.640]  Taylor, you're probably not surprised by this, your response.
[1:34:28.640 --> 1:34:29.640]  Not at all.
[1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:34.080]  And when that DOJ report was released, Joe Hanneman with Epoch Times actually was the
[1:34:34.080 --> 1:34:35.560]  first to send it to me.
[1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:39.920]  And as I'm reading through it, I knew they were going to lie, but to this scope and to
[1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:44.520]  go this far with lying, I mean, they lied about every single detail all the way down
[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:49.520]  to the police officers supposedly rendering aid immediately, even though I was sitting
[1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:53.040]  on the ground with other journalists with her blood on my hands, like you said, while
[1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:54.720]  they're sitting there doing nothing.
[1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:56.880]  They lied about the number of windows broken out.
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:35:00.360]  They lied about the number of firearms drawn by officers.
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:03.640]  They said they tried to push Ashley back and she returned to the front.
[1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:08.040]  I mean, it's honestly egregious, it's disgusting, and we don't live in America anymore.
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:11.480]  I mean, upon reading this report, you know, I'm not a very emotional person, but it brought
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:12.480]  me to tears.
[1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:16.200]  You know, the part where they said that they, they actually have the audacity to say that
[1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:20.720]  their officers tried to render aid immediately when their officers were realistically the
[1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:22.320]  reason why Ashley didn't survive.
[1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:23.840]  They didn't clear the blood out of her throat.
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:24.840]  So it's just despicable.
[1:35:24.840 --> 1:35:30.080]  I went, well, you said it right there that, you know, we don't live in America anymore.
[1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:33.160]  That is the toughest pill to swallow, but it's finally gone down.
[1:35:33.160 --> 1:35:34.160]  It's true.
[1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:35.160]  We don't.
[1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:36.660]  We live in a banana republic.
[1:35:36.660 --> 1:35:38.160]  We live in a communist hellhole.
[1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:40.160]  We live in a third world country.
[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:42.800]  We live in a very corrupt country.
[1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:45.960]  Republicans don't do much to help that, unfortunately, but it's mostly the Democrats, at least at
[1:35:45.960 --> 1:35:48.920]  this point in time, that are the bad ones, the evil ones.
[1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:54.000]  I mean, and now tomorrow, they're going to have this made for TV January 6th hearing,
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:58.680]  obviously all bull crap, obviously politicized, obviously nothing about, it has nothing to
[1:35:58.680 --> 1:35:59.680]  even do with January 6th.
[1:35:59.680 --> 1:36:03.320]  It has everything to do with the midterms and then wanting to use this to get people
[1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:05.600]  to go out and vote in the midterms.
[1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:08.960]  So I mean, what do you, what do you make of the Democrats turning this into a TV event
[1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:13.880]  tomorrow, a push for people to vote in the midterms for Democrats?
[1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:18.440]  I mean, I find it hilarious, honestly, is, you know, they have so many people that are
[1:36:18.440 --> 1:36:22.920]  not interested in this, that they have to pay a mainstream source, you know, all this
[1:36:22.920 --> 1:36:27.600]  money to do a primetime television event, to do this big expose, you know, when the
[1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:32.960]  government is paying a media source to cover something, there's a little bit of a conflict
[1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:33.960]  of interest.
[1:36:33.960 --> 1:36:34.960]  Is that not like fascism?
[1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:35.960]  I would say the least.
[1:36:35.960 --> 1:36:36.960]  Yeah.
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:37.960]  Just a little bit.
[1:36:37.960 --> 1:36:43.000]  The power being included, yeah, it's a, we live in a fascist country, Owen, and I mean,
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:46.280]  it's only going to get worse at this point, and we got to keep standing up.
[1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:49.480]  And thankfully, you know, I'm going to be producing a documentary soon about the five
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:53.800]  deaths of what took place that day on January 6th, and I think it's going to blow this thing
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:36:54.800]  out of the water.
[1:36:54.800 --> 1:36:58.680]  I mean, they can only lie to the American people for so long and about so much until
[1:36:58.680 --> 1:37:02.560]  something is finally done and the lit is just blown off of this thing.
[1:37:02.560 --> 1:37:04.960]  But the January 6th committee, they've always been a fraud.
[1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:07.160]  You got Adam Enzinger, you got Liz Cheney.
[1:37:07.160 --> 1:37:09.760]  I mean, these people have never been pro America.
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:14.000]  I mean, they're about the, they are the definition of the establishment and these people are
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  demons.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:18.880]  I mean, they killed five people on the six and then blamed these Trump supporters, even
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:20.960]  though they were the ones that were being murdered.
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:23.440]  No, it's truly unbelievable.
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:27.200]  And it is, it is corporate fascism when the Democrats, because you know, this is what
[1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:28.200]  they did.
[1:37:28.200 --> 1:37:33.960]  They called CNN executives, they called MSNBC executives, they called ABC executives, and
[1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:39.080]  they said, hey, we want to do a made for television event to rehash January 6th, to convince people
[1:37:39.080 --> 1:37:41.160]  to go vote Democrat in the midterms.
[1:37:41.160 --> 1:37:42.160]  Can you help us?
[1:37:42.160 --> 1:37:43.800]  They said, yep, we'll make sure we air it.
[1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:50.120]  They then got the ABC executive that helped ABC cover up for the Clintons and the Epstein's.
[1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:54.080]  They, oh, that's the guy that they hire to run the J6 hearing is the guy that covered
[1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:57.720]  up for the Clintons and the Epstein's trafficking little girls and raping them.
[1:37:57.720 --> 1:37:59.040]  He seems like a winner.
[1:37:59.040 --> 1:38:01.120]  And so they coordinated all of it.
[1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:06.400]  They got all their pieces in place, and they said, we're going to do it during prime time.
[1:38:06.400 --> 1:38:11.880]  And so I don't think America is going to respond the way they hope, though.
[1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:16.920]  I think most Americans are sick of hearing about January 6th, and they've watched Democrats
[1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:22.680]  commit acts of evil for the last five years that pale, January 6th pales in comparison
[1:38:22.680 --> 1:38:25.040]  to what Democrats have done the last five years.
[1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:26.040]  No, absolutely.
[1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:31.080]  Oh, and the fact is, is if you're ignorant to this situation at this time with January
[1:38:31.080 --> 1:38:35.080]  6th and the fact that our economy is in the absolute shitter, I mean, everything this
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:38.240]  administration has done is they have destroyed this country.
[1:38:38.240 --> 1:38:41.720]  They've demoralized its own people, they've killed their own people, they've arrested
[1:38:41.720 --> 1:38:43.280]  and jailed their people.
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:47.520]  I mean, like I said before, you know, this is not America and Americans are not going
[1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:52.720]  to respond to this kindly as you can only push and push and push so far on the American
[1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:55.120]  people until something finally breaks.
[1:38:55.120 --> 1:38:58.560]  And I do think we're about to get to that point, honestly, is I think this commission,
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:00.840]  I mean, it's never been about January 6th.
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:05.240]  It's always been about taking your rights, implementing more national security policies
[1:39:05.240 --> 1:39:09.680]  so they can monitor American citizens that they believe are white supremacists and terrorists.
[1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:13.040]  I mean, so that's really all this is, it's a pathetic power grab.
[1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:16.320]  And really, if you believe it at this point, I feel bad for you.
[1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:19.920]  And there's not really much, much that can be done to help these people.
[1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:24.960]  Well, that's it too is something has got to give something has got to break.
[1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:30.680]  I mean, the dam of civilization can only withhold so much fraud, only withhold so much
[1:39:30.680 --> 1:39:35.320]  deception, only withhold so much corruption before it just gives out and then washes civilization
[1:39:35.320 --> 1:39:36.320]  away.
[1:39:36.320 --> 1:39:38.680]  I mean, we feel like we're getting closer to that moment.
[1:39:38.680 --> 1:39:40.600]  And the Democrats seem to be speeding towards it.
[1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:43.200]  It seems like this is what they want to happen.
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:44.200]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:47.320]  I mean, they're they're full blown acceleration is at this point.
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:48.640]  I mean, they want war.
[1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:49.640]  They want people dead.
[1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:52.160]  I mean, at this point, I'm not putting it past them.
[1:39:52.160 --> 1:39:55.040]  I mean, we're getting to the point in history where you're going to start seeing people
[1:39:55.040 --> 1:39:56.040]  in camps soon enough.
[1:39:56.040 --> 1:39:58.360]  I mean, these people are insane.
[1:39:58.360 --> 1:39:59.360]  They want you dead.
[1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:00.720]  They don't care about you.
[1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:04.200]  They hate you and all your values and everything they stand for.
[1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:05.520]  And you're they're not going to stop.
[1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:09.400]  I mean, they're not going to stop unless we stop them and we have the power to.
[1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:11.520]  We just have to actually go out and do it.
[1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:15.000]  Well, thank God, you're going to do a documentary on this.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:20.120]  How close are you to completing that and where are people going to be able to find it?
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:24.880]  It should be able to be completed about a week and a half is the goal.
[1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:27.480]  We want it out before these hearings are over.
[1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:31.280]  And I believe it will be broadcasted on OAN.
[1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:37.080]  So when you look back and you think about January 6th, because really it was a bad day.
[1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:39.320]  I mean, our election was stolen.
[1:40:39.320 --> 1:40:41.360]  Democrats set up their political opposition.
[1:40:41.360 --> 1:40:45.200]  Now they have hundreds of political prisoners that they're torturing and starving and holding
[1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:46.200]  in solitary confinement.
[1:40:46.200 --> 1:40:51.520]  I mean, January 6th really was a dark day, just not for the reasons we're being told.
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:54.640]  I mean, they already have political prisoners.
[1:40:54.640 --> 1:40:58.840]  There's other documentaries that have come out about January 6th showing all the lies.
[1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:02.240]  Where do you think the American public is at right now?
[1:41:02.240 --> 1:41:07.120]  Do you think that they'll find the truth in January 6th or do you think the overwhelming
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:11.120]  mainstream media propaganda will keep it hidden?
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:15.520]  I think the mainstream propaganda will do a good job or at least a semi decent job for
[1:41:15.520 --> 1:41:18.680]  a little bit, you know, dragging into the midterms is because they're going to ramp
[1:41:18.680 --> 1:41:20.080]  this up going into the midterms.
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:23.040]  This is what it's been about is they want people to vote Democrat.
[1:41:23.040 --> 1:41:25.880]  They want people to vote mindlessly on their plantation.
[1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:29.440]  So I do think it will be effective, at least for the first portion, but they're already
[1:41:29.440 --> 1:41:30.640]  blowing this out of the water.
[1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:32.200]  I mean, they're already exposing themselves.
[1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:36.320]  I mean, they haven't investigated a single damn thing since this commission was founded
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:40.280]  and that DOJ report on Ashley Babbitt and what took place in the Speaker's hallway
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:41.680]  is the perfect example of that.
[1:41:41.680 --> 1:41:44.640]  I mean, they are rewriting history.
[1:41:44.640 --> 1:41:48.000]  And I mean, that report to me, it was a straight kick in the balls because I was the only one
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:49.200]  that wasn't arrested.
[1:41:49.200 --> 1:41:53.800]  I reached out to be subpoenaed over 10 times, they didn't respond to me.
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:54.800]  And now it makes sense.
[1:41:54.800 --> 1:41:59.080]  Why is because they use John Sullivan as the only witness and they lied about every single
[1:41:59.080 --> 1:42:00.080]  detail.
[1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:01.080]  But I do think the truth will come out.
[1:42:01.080 --> 1:42:02.360]  It is inevitable.
[1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:04.480]  And thankfully we got a lot of good people in this industry.
[1:42:04.480 --> 1:42:08.120]  We got a lot of good fighters, especially surrounding the January 6th topic.
[1:42:08.120 --> 1:42:09.120]  Wow.
[1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:10.120]  That is, that's amazing.
[1:42:10.120 --> 1:42:12.640]  What you just said, you basically stuck your neck out there.
[1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:16.560]  You basically offered the Democrats your neck because you thought it was more important
[1:42:16.560 --> 1:42:18.960]  to tell the truth about what happened to Ashley Babbitt.
[1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:20.880]  And they didn't even take it.
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:21.880]  Nope.
[1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:23.200]  I reached out countless times.
[1:42:23.200 --> 1:42:24.800]  I can't even keep track of how many times.
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:29.520]  I mean, through official email, my attorneys, I've tweeted at the commission, I've tweeted
[1:42:29.520 --> 1:42:31.440]  at Kinzinger, I've tweeted at Liz Chenney.
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:33.400]  I mean, I have reached out over and over again.
[1:42:33.400 --> 1:42:37.120]  And then now I know why they never wanted to talk to me because if they did, they couldn't
[1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:41.160]  have came out with that BS report because my eyewitness statement and my video that
[1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:44.600]  they didn't enter in the record of evidence disproves all of that.
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:47.960]  I mean, folks, this is unprecedented stuff.
[1:42:47.960 --> 1:42:53.440]  We're talking about an eyewitness to a killing that investigators don't want to talk to.
[1:42:53.440 --> 1:42:56.240]  Taylor, I bet that that's never happened before.
[1:42:56.240 --> 1:42:57.240]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:57.240 --> 1:43:03.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, high quality, storeable food is back in stock, ready to ship right
[1:43:03.520 --> 1:43:04.520]  now.
[1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:08.200]  We've not been selling food for three months because it was taking several weeks for the
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:10.400]  food to get packaged and delivered to you.
[1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:14.640]  Most of their companies are completely out, but now they have a large spectrum of high
[1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:16.960]  quality food ready to ship.
[1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:22.480]  Everything you find at PrepareWithAlex.com or PrepareToDay.com is in stock ready to ship.

[1:43:31.240 --> 1:43:35.400]  shortages, with the wars, with the collapsing wars, everything's happening is one of the
[1:43:35.400 --> 1:43:39.480]  most important things you can make is to have high quality, storeable food, water filtration,
[1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:40.480]  air filtration and more.
[1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:41.760]  And it's not just those items.
[1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:46.480]  It's hundreds of other high quality, preparedness items and survival items right now at Prepare
[1:43:46.480 --> 1:43:51.480]  WithAlex.com that again redirects to PrepareToday.com.
[1:43:51.480 --> 1:43:54.440]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important things you can do
[1:43:54.440 --> 1:43:57.880]  is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning.
[1:43:57.880 --> 1:44:03.520]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones is right.
[1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:05.040]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[1:44:05.040 --> 1:44:10.720]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming, I tried to stop it
[1:44:10.720 --> 1:44:15.960]  and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:21.120]  the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents.
[1:44:21.120 --> 1:44:22.720]  It's now out in the open.
[1:44:22.720 --> 1:44:28.480]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[1:44:28.480 --> 1:44:29.480]  Group.
[1:44:29.480 --> 1:44:32.320]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[1:44:32.320 --> 1:44:35.520]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:36.520]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:38.360]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:42.160]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:45.640]  your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:49.880]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are
[1:44:49.880 --> 1:44:52.280]  the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:44:52.280 --> 1:44:56.800]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[1:44:56.800 --> 1:44:58.000]  your efforts.

[1:45:04.560 --> 1:45:09.680]  with a little gold bar implanted in it and on the back it's got a hologram.
[1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:14.400]  There are only 25,000 of these in existence and they'll never be made again.
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:18.240]  The bank that owns the mint that has started putting these out the last few years just
[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:23.960]  sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling
[1:45:23.960 --> 1:45:24.960]  these for.
[1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:29.240]  And when you get three or more, you can get these at 50% off and they fund the info war.

[1:47:00.120 --> 1:47:14.080]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:14.080 --> 1:47:18.680]  Taylor Hansen is with us and I wanted to get into Taylor's coverage of the drag queen strip
[1:47:18.680 --> 1:47:22.640]  show for kids in Dallas that he covered but I want to continue with the J6 stuff because
[1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:25.600]  I know he has other things to say.
[1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:30.240]  Like the fact that Taylor Hansen, there may be, I'm sure there's others but this event
[1:47:30.240 --> 1:47:37.280]  is probably the only time where eyewitnesses to a killing are not questioned by law enforcement.
[1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:43.920]  Taylor Hansen witnessed Michael Byrd shoot Ashley Babbitt and he was not brought in as
[1:47:43.920 --> 1:47:51.080]  a witness for questioning, I mean seriously Taylor, I'm wondering if this isn't the only
[1:47:51.080 --> 1:47:57.520]  instance in US criminal history where eyewitnesses to a killing are not brought in as witnesses
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:47:58.520]  for questioning.
[1:47:58.520 --> 1:48:00.040]  I don't think that's ever happened before.
[1:48:00.040 --> 1:48:06.000]  Yeah, I don't think it has either and the biggest thing too is what I find funny is
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:10.360]  if I go and try and hop on a plane right now, I have to go through four hours of security
[1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:15.120]  because I'm on what my Department of Homeland Security connection says is a witness list.
[1:48:15.120 --> 1:48:19.840]  So they publicly identify me in their system, the federal government, as a witness to this
[1:48:19.840 --> 1:48:24.200]  crime, a witness to this death, but no one has talked to me, not a single officer has
[1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:28.840]  even asked me a single question, no investigators, no committee, nothing.
[1:48:28.840 --> 1:48:34.000]  I have not been talked to virtually in any professional capacity or by the government
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:38.760]  regarding January 6th, even though I captured some of the most monumental video and saw
[1:48:38.760 --> 1:48:41.360]  some of the craziest things that took place that day.
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:45.480]  Yeah, and then my crew points this out, there's an obvious question that I wasn't even asking,
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:51.520]  it says, the question is why, why the hearing now, why are they doing it now?
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:55.760]  Well, the obvious answer is the midterms coming up, but the not so obvious answer, which
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:49:02.720]  I think is also a good point here, they had to spend almost two years going through all
[1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:08.320]  the security footage so that they could scrub it down to make sure nobody saw Antifa breaking
[1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:13.880]  in, nobody saw John Sullivan breaking in, nobody saw the guys clad in black helmets
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:20.240]  and bats bashing in the windows that are probably Antifa, leftists, provocateurs, so they had
[1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:26.200]  to scrub all that information, they also had to spend a year and a half going through thousands
[1:49:26.200 --> 1:49:31.640]  of individuals' text messages, phone records, emails, everything, so it took them a year
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:37.200]  and a half to scrub all the evidence of their crimes out of the hearing and then cherry
[1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:42.520]  pick, edit, take things out of context, I'm sure that they're going to be presenting tomorrow.
[1:49:42.520 --> 1:49:46.920]  I mean, it's just, it's just, it's criminal fraud from the top down here with the Democrats
[1:49:46.920 --> 1:49:48.400]  and this J6 hearing.
[1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:54.880]  No, yeah, and I'm thankful you mentioned that, is because actually I had access to every
[1:49:54.880 --> 1:49:58.760]  single security camera within the United States Capitol.
[1:49:58.760 --> 1:50:04.840]  I had access for over a month, I went through, I went and I examined every single area and
[1:50:04.840 --> 1:50:09.760]  identified every single camera, I named the cameras, got an understanding of where each
[1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:14.240]  camera are and inside of the Capitol, which area it's in, and you want to know the one
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:19.160]  camera angle that was conveniently missing is in the hallway where Ashley Babbitt was
[1:50:19.160 --> 1:50:20.160]  shot and killed.
[1:50:20.160 --> 1:50:23.160]  So, it just shows you that they are getting rid of this, they're scrubbing this, they're
[1:50:23.160 --> 1:50:27.440]  not allowing people to see this, I had the most highly sensitive clearance when I was
[1:50:27.440 --> 1:50:32.000]  logged in to this government software and I couldn't even find it, and on top of that,
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:36.640]  I've talked to multiple prisoners that they will have discovery ready for them, they will
[1:50:36.640 --> 1:50:42.080]  pick a certain amount of videos for proof to defend them in their discovery cases.
[1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:46.480]  And then all of a sudden, when it gets reviewed by the government to be confirmed for discovery,
[1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:50.880]  it comes back and maybe two or three of those videos are just conveniently missing, so they
[1:50:50.880 --> 1:50:54.720]  are actively deleting evidence and I don't know if we're ever even going to be able to
[1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:55.720]  see this.
[1:50:55.720 --> 1:51:00.920]  I mean, they're just scrubbing all of this software, scrubbing all of this evidence,
[1:51:00.920 --> 1:51:05.840]  so when the administration changes after these people are ripped out of office or voted out
[1:51:05.840 --> 1:51:10.480]  either or, whichever way it goes, is no one can go back and rewrite the history how it's
[1:51:10.480 --> 1:51:12.800]  supposed to be because they've deleted the evidence.
[1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:16.760]  Yeah, so again, just Democrats are allowed to commit crimes, Democrats are allowed to
[1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:21.120]  evidence tamper, Democrats are allowed to, I mean, contempt of court, how is that not
[1:51:21.120 --> 1:51:25.880]  contempt of court, deleting evidence, but I mean, like they arrest Peter Navarro for
[1:51:25.880 --> 1:51:28.200]  contempt of Congress, how is that even a crime?
[1:51:28.200 --> 1:51:31.320]  Who doesn't have contempt for these bastards in our Congress right now?
[1:51:31.320 --> 1:51:35.120]  I mean, my goodness, lying to the FBI, the FBI lies to us.
[1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:36.280]  Why are they allowed to lie to us?
[1:51:36.280 --> 1:51:42.400]  But I want to back off of this for a second because you did incredible work at the Dallas
[1:51:42.400 --> 1:51:49.640]  drag queen dance strip show for kids just a couple of weekends ago where your girlfriend
[1:51:49.640 --> 1:51:54.760]  got spat on by a radical leftist, I mean, bless her heart, she seemed to take it okay,
[1:51:54.760 --> 1:51:56.800]  these psychotic people that are out here.
[1:51:56.800 --> 1:52:01.240]  I mean, how do you put that into perspective?
[1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:07.800]  How do you put it's not going to lick itself perverts, dancing and stripping for kids?
[1:52:07.800 --> 1:52:10.080]  And they call it liberal, they call it pride month.
[1:52:10.080 --> 1:52:15.240]  All in all, put it in perspective for you is, you know, I've seen a lot of really messed
[1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:16.240]  up things.
[1:52:16.240 --> 1:52:18.960]  I mean, I've watched people die on the ground while reporting.
[1:52:18.960 --> 1:52:23.400]  And while I was in this event undercover recording all of this footage and watching this child
[1:52:23.400 --> 1:52:25.560]  abuse, because there's no other way to put it.
[1:52:25.560 --> 1:52:29.000]  I mean, the feeling that I had, it was worse than a lot of the times.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:33.880]  I mean, I had a worse feeling than, you know, on January 6th, I was in shock after January
[1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:38.680]  6th, but this, I had to willingly sit through and watch for two hours.
[1:52:38.680 --> 1:52:42.800]  I mean, this is by far the most disgusting and depraved event that I've ever seen in
[1:52:42.800 --> 1:52:43.800]  my entire life.
[1:52:43.800 --> 1:52:44.800]  It's straight up pedophilia.
[1:52:44.800 --> 1:52:45.800]  Yeah.
[1:52:45.800 --> 1:52:50.400]  And it's like, they're like I said earlier, they're accelerationist.
[1:52:50.400 --> 1:52:52.200]  I mean, where does it go from here?
[1:52:52.200 --> 1:52:54.560]  They used to do drag queen story time.
[1:52:54.560 --> 1:52:58.200]  And they'd at least like bring out a book to pretend like it was an academic thing or
[1:52:58.200 --> 1:53:00.600]  pretend it was some sort of a learning experience.
[1:53:00.600 --> 1:53:01.760]  They just removed that.
[1:53:01.760 --> 1:53:03.920]  Now it's just drag queens for kids.
[1:53:03.920 --> 1:53:04.920]  Now they're dancing.
[1:53:04.920 --> 1:53:05.920]  They're stripping.
[1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:06.920]  They're exchanging dollar bills.
[1:53:06.920 --> 1:53:07.920]  They're in clubs.
[1:53:07.920 --> 1:53:09.420]  They're saying it's not going to lick itself.
[1:53:09.420 --> 1:53:11.320]  How do we allow this to happen?
[1:53:11.320 --> 1:53:14.960]  And why do you think it's happening so much in Texas?
[1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:18.440]  I mean, this is the symptom of a dying society, as John Doyle would put it.
[1:53:18.440 --> 1:53:23.240]  I mean, this, our society is gone and that's what blew me the hell away is that, you know,
[1:53:23.240 --> 1:53:27.960]  this is something you would expect to see in California, you know, not here in Texas,
[1:53:27.960 --> 1:53:30.480]  but this was 25 minutes away from my lip.
[1:53:30.480 --> 1:53:34.320]  So right as I saw this event, I mean, I couldn't not go and attend to this thing.
[1:53:34.320 --> 1:53:36.840]  But I mean, I think we got here because it was a slippery slope.
[1:53:36.840 --> 1:53:40.800]  I mean, we started, you know, with gay marriage and then it just kept going and kept going
[1:53:40.800 --> 1:53:41.800]  and kept going.
[1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:42.800]  And here we are now.
[1:53:42.800 --> 1:53:46.640]  They want to touch your kids and they're not saying they don't either.
[1:53:46.640 --> 1:53:47.640]  And they are.
[1:53:47.640 --> 1:53:48.760]  I mean, they're on film doing it.
[1:53:48.760 --> 1:53:53.200]  It's like, and then, you know, some of them are getting aggressive afterwards because
[1:53:53.200 --> 1:53:56.000]  journalists are asking them questions like, Hey, don't you think what you're doing here
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  isn't appropriate?
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:54:00.720]  What you think what you're doing here is wrong and they run away and they get aggressive.
[1:54:00.720 --> 1:54:01.720]  So they know it's wrong.
[1:54:01.720 --> 1:54:08.960]  I mean, why would a grown adult show up to do a drag queen dance strip show for kids?
[1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:09.960]  Why?
[1:54:09.960 --> 1:54:10.960]  Why?
[1:54:10.960 --> 1:54:11.960]  Well, the answer is pretty obvious.
[1:54:11.960 --> 1:54:12.960]  Why?
[1:54:12.960 --> 1:54:13.960]  He's a damn pervert.
[1:54:13.960 --> 1:54:14.960]  That's why.
[1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:15.960]  Yeah, it's disgusting.
[1:54:15.960 --> 1:54:20.480]  Oh, and honestly, and one situation that really is still, still got under my skin from that
[1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:21.480]  event.
[1:54:21.480 --> 1:54:25.760]  One thing that I'll never forget is I was sitting at this gay nightclub is what it was.
[1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:30.360]  And there's a child sitting to the left of me and he has three moms is what it appears
[1:54:30.360 --> 1:54:31.520]  to look like.
[1:54:31.520 --> 1:54:35.840]  And there's a gay bartender behind the bar and I overhear the conversation and this kid
[1:54:35.840 --> 1:54:39.400]  replies to the gay bartender and he says, No, I'm not gay.
[1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:42.280]  And his mom interrupts him and says, Yes, he is.
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:44.520]  He's gay, but don't let him lie to you.
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:45.520]  He's lying.
[1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:47.520]  And this kid, the look on his face is said at all.
[1:54:47.520 --> 1:54:49.400]  I mean, he completely shut down.
[1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:50.560]  He was not okay.
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:55.560]  I watched him solve a Rubik's cube three times in a row just to unsolve it and do it again.
[1:54:55.560 --> 1:54:57.440]  And then he kept playing Nintendo DS.
[1:54:57.440 --> 1:55:02.640]  He didn't even look at this drag show a single time and hear his mom is forcing him to be
[1:55:02.640 --> 1:55:04.040]  something that he isn't.
[1:55:04.040 --> 1:55:08.720]  I mean, this is the highest level of child abuse and grooming on know that that's a story.
[1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:12.400]  I don't think anybody, I never saw that or heard about that.
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:15.240]  So it just shows the kids don't want anything to do with this.
[1:55:15.240 --> 1:55:16.320]  You know, I noticed the same thing.
[1:55:16.320 --> 1:55:18.000]  They had a trans kids day.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:19.280]  Yeah, there's the video right there.
[1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:20.280]  Wow.
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:27.600]  It was a trans kids day in Austin and that I went to as a counter to cover it.
[1:55:27.600 --> 1:55:31.720]  And I noticed that there was something missing from the support trans kids event.
[1:55:31.720 --> 1:55:33.920]  And that was kids.
[1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:34.920]  It was all adults.
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:39.600]  It was all perverted men and gay men and gay women and fat hippo lesbians telling us,
[1:55:39.600 --> 1:55:43.440]  it's talking about how they want to mutilate children's genitals.
[1:55:43.440 --> 1:55:45.640]  They're forcing their kids into this.
[1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:46.640]  It's what it is.
[1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:51.040]  And like you said, it's child abuse and it's leftist liberal parents getting away with child
[1:55:51.040 --> 1:55:52.040]  abuse.
[1:55:52.040 --> 1:55:53.040]  And I guess that makes them feel good.
[1:55:53.040 --> 1:55:54.040]  I guess that makes them feel powerful.
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:55.040]  Oh, yeah.
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:56:00.120]  Well, all it is is as you put it, well, I mean, it's a lot of this is these single moms
[1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:04.600]  that want to be popular, they're liberal and it's popular right now to have a trans kid.
[1:56:04.600 --> 1:56:07.600]  So they're all saying, Hey, you're trans, you're trans, you're trans.
[1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:10.840]  I mean, and they're forcing this ideology on their kid because it's popular because
[1:56:10.840 --> 1:56:12.400]  it gets them a little bit of clout.
[1:56:12.400 --> 1:56:16.440]  It makes them feel better about their insecurities about their gender dysphoria.
[1:56:16.440 --> 1:56:20.920]  I mean, they are literally breeding a generation of mass shooters at this point.
[1:56:20.920 --> 1:56:22.880]  These kids are not going to be okay.
[1:56:22.880 --> 1:56:24.880]  These kids are being abused to the highest level.
[1:56:24.880 --> 1:56:27.160]  They're being abused sexually, mentally.
[1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:30.520]  I mean, these kids are not going to come out on top in society.
[1:56:30.520 --> 1:56:33.200]  They're going to be the bottom of the barrel because of what they've been subjected to
[1:56:33.200 --> 1:56:34.200]  their entire life.
[1:56:34.200 --> 1:56:35.200]  And it's tragic.
[1:56:35.200 --> 1:56:36.200]  Yeah.
[1:56:36.200 --> 1:56:37.200]  It breaks your heart.
[1:56:37.200 --> 1:56:40.280]  It's really unbelievable that they get away with this stuff.
[1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:43.400]  But until somebody stops them, they're going to keep doing it.
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:46.480]  And I think that the lawmaker in Dallas did the right thing.
[1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:50.160]  He made legislation to ban children from drag shows.
[1:56:50.160 --> 1:56:51.680]  That is the right move.
[1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:53.920]  Make Democrats defend this pedophilia.
[1:56:53.920 --> 1:56:57.040]  Make Democrats publicly defend child abuse.
[1:56:57.040 --> 1:56:58.160]  Let's make them do that.
[1:56:58.160 --> 1:57:02.520]  We need more laws saying you can't take kids to strip clubs.
[1:57:02.520 --> 1:57:03.520]  We already knew that.
[1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:06.440]  You can't take kids to drag shows or gay shows.
[1:57:06.440 --> 1:57:10.400]  Make the Democrats defend this borderline pedophilia child abuse.
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:11.400]  Final words, Taylor Hansen.
[1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:12.400]  Where can people fall?
[1:57:12.400 --> 1:57:14.080]  Where can they get their documentary?
[1:57:14.080 --> 1:57:15.400]  Where's all the great work you're doing?
[1:57:15.400 --> 1:57:16.400]  Yeah.
[1:57:16.400 --> 1:57:21.760]  Everyone can follow me at Taylor USA on Twitter and it's T-A-Y-L-E-R-US-A.
[1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:25.620]  And all my updates regarding the documentary and any future work or debunking regarding
[1:57:25.620 --> 1:57:29.960]  January 6th or pedophile catching because we'd like to do that now, it'll all be posted
[1:57:29.960 --> 1:57:30.960]  there.
[1:57:30.960 --> 1:57:34.200]  And one comment I'd like to make before we go is just thank God for InfoWars, thank
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:35.880]  God for Owen Shroyer.
[1:57:35.880 --> 1:57:39.000]  You guys have been amazing ever since, you know, I was first introduced to you.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:41.360]  You guys had me on after January 6th.
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:44.040]  You guys are the only source that tells the whole truth on this topic.
[1:57:44.040 --> 1:57:48.040]  Well, thank God for you too, brother.
[1:57:48.040 --> 1:57:53.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, high quality, storeable food is back in stock, ready to ship right
[1:57:53.280 --> 1:57:54.280]  now.

[1:58:04.440 --> 1:58:06.720]  quality food, ready to ship.
[1:58:06.720 --> 1:58:12.280]  The thing you find at PrepareWithAlex.com or PrepareToDay.com is in stock, ready to ship.

[1:58:19.200 --> 1:58:23.200]  With the inflation happening, with the food shortages, with the wars, with the collapse
[1:58:23.200 --> 1:58:26.800]  in wars, everything's happening is one of the most important things you can make is
[1:58:26.800 --> 1:58:30.240]  to have high quality, storeable food, water filtration, air filtration and more.
[1:58:30.240 --> 1:58:34.120]  And it's not just those items, it's hundreds of other high quality, preparing the items

[1:58:41.280 --> 1:58:42.920]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:58:42.920 --> 1:58:46.560]  One of the most important things you can do is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation
[1:58:46.560 --> 1:58:47.560]  is just beginning.
[1:58:47.560 --> 1:58:52.520]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher,
[1:58:52.520 --> 1:58:57.680]  a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[1:58:57.680 --> 1:58:58.680]  You see it every year.
[1:58:58.680 --> 1:59:03.760]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers
[1:59:03.760 --> 1:59:09.480]  and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups
[1:59:09.480 --> 1:59:13.080]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[1:59:13.080 --> 1:59:14.080]  this and knowing this.
[1:59:14.080 --> 1:59:19.720]  So, it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[1:59:19.720 --> 1:59:22.760]  to be able to do things tax wise.
[1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:25.280]  It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[1:59:25.280 --> 1:59:30.720]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:37.880]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com
[1:59:37.880 --> 2:00:07.800]  or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[2:00:07.800 --> 2:00:09.400]  This is your final segment with me.
[2:00:09.400 --> 2:00:11.400]  Mike Adams is going to host the last hour.
[2:00:11.400 --> 2:00:13.960]  Sadly, I'm due in court this afternoon.
[2:00:13.960 --> 2:00:17.680]  That's just the life of a free speech advocate.
[2:00:17.680 --> 2:00:24.320]  That's just the life of an American patriot, court, court, court as I'm politically persecuted
[2:00:24.320 --> 2:00:25.480]  by demon crats.
[2:00:25.480 --> 2:00:28.360]  But Mike Adams has a powerful hour coming up.
[2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:34.920]  You're not going to want to miss it with key intel and information with Mike Adams.
[2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:37.080]  Let's just take a look at some of this other news.
[2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:45.920]  This and drag queens coming to Croix D'Alanne, Idaho, Croix D'Alanne, Idaho, sorry it's a
[2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:50.440]  French thing I'm butchering it, but anyway, Idaho for June 11th, family friendly gay pride
[2:00:50.440 --> 2:00:51.440]  event.
[2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:52.680]  Local passers condemn the event.
[2:00:52.680 --> 2:00:55.600]  It's an Idaho Tribune.
[2:00:55.600 --> 2:01:02.240]  Literally Satanists and drag queens and faggots are showing up to sexualize kids at this event,
[2:01:02.240 --> 2:01:03.240]  folks.
[2:01:03.240 --> 2:01:11.840]  June 11th in Idaho, Croix D'Alanne, Croix D'Alanne, thank you, I'm not intentionally trying to
[2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:12.840]  mess this up.
[2:01:12.840 --> 2:01:16.320]  Croix D'Alanne, so if you're in the area and you want to stop these pedos from getting
[2:01:16.320 --> 2:01:20.080]  access to the kids or cover it, jeez man.
[2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:22.800]  You know, I guess the good news is the Democrats are really taking the mask off.
[2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:24.440]  Now everybody sees what evil they are.
[2:01:24.440 --> 2:01:28.560]  The bad news is they're evil demons and you know what evil demons like to do to you, torture
[2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:29.560]  you, murder you.
[2:01:29.560 --> 2:01:34.240]  A California lawmaker who relaxed punishments for sex offenders proposes mandatory drag
[2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:37.560]  queen 101 class for K through 12 students.
[2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:38.560]  Wow.
[2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:39.560]  Wow.
[2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:45.200]  North Carolina City cancels drag queen story hour, an event that has a big impact on kids
[2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:46.200]  because of backlash.
[2:01:46.200 --> 2:01:49.840]  Yeah, folks, that's how you stop this pedophile stuff.
[2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:52.520]  You tell them we know what you're doing and we don't like it.
[2:01:52.520 --> 2:01:56.080]  Your demons, your abusing children will arrest you if you abuse those kids.
[2:01:56.080 --> 2:01:57.240]  That's how you stop it.
[2:01:57.240 --> 2:01:58.240]  Arrest the child abusers.
[2:01:58.240 --> 2:02:00.320]  They won't abuse kids anymore.
[2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:06.920]  Report UKNHS scrubs the word woman from ovarian cancer guidance to be more inclusive.
[2:02:06.920 --> 2:02:10.720]  Yeah, my ovaries are feeling a little cancerous today.
[2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:13.480]  Louisiana Bands trans athletes from female sports teams.
[2:02:13.480 --> 2:02:17.200]  Oh, you mean men, Louisiana Bands men from competing with women?
[2:02:17.200 --> 2:02:18.200]  Probably a good move.
[2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:25.080]  So some heroes on the Tampa Bay Rays said we're not doing gay pride crap.
[2:02:25.080 --> 2:02:26.080]  We're Christians.
[2:02:26.080 --> 2:02:27.080]  We believe in Jesus.
[2:02:27.080 --> 2:02:28.080]  We believe in the Bible.
[2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:31.240]  We're not going to force us into your satanic activity here.
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:37.080]  And well, let's just say ESPN was a little upset with that in clip 11.
[2:02:37.080 --> 2:02:41.840]  Tampa pitcher Jason Adams to the Tampa Bay Times hard decision because ultimately we
[2:02:41.840 --> 2:02:46.360]  all said we want is them to know that they are welcome and loved here.
[2:02:46.360 --> 2:02:50.040]  But when we put it on our bodies, I think a lot of guys decided that it's just a lifestyle
[2:02:50.040 --> 2:02:55.160]  that maybe that they looked down on or anything differently is just that maybe we don't want
[2:02:55.160 --> 2:02:59.680]  to encourage if it we believe in Jesus was encouraged us to live a lifestyle that would
[2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:02.840]  abstain from that behavior.
[2:03:02.840 --> 2:03:06.320]  Sarah Spain, how does that all come off to you?
[2:03:06.320 --> 2:03:07.320]  Pride is about inclusion.
[2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:08.320]  So you don't love them.
[2:03:08.320 --> 2:03:11.880]  You don't welcome them if you're not willing to wear the patch and calling it a lifestyle
[2:03:11.880 --> 2:03:16.520]  reveals to me that you've done not even a modicum of research or understanding on this
[2:03:16.520 --> 2:03:17.520]  topic.
[2:03:17.520 --> 2:03:18.520]  It's not a lifestyle.
[2:03:18.520 --> 2:03:20.200]  You're just promoting the lifestyle isn't affected by things.
[2:03:20.200 --> 2:03:22.080]  This is not just about baseball.
[2:03:22.080 --> 2:03:26.640]  That religious example is definitely not about baseball and otherwise also allows for people
[2:03:26.640 --> 2:03:33.720]  to be denied health care, jobs, apartments, children, prescriptions, all sorts of rights.
[2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:37.760]  And so we have to stop tiptoeing around because we're trying to protect people who are trying
[2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:42.320]  to be bigoted from asking for them to be exempt from it when the very people that they are
[2:03:42.320 --> 2:03:46.840]  bigoted against are suffering the consequences when you say trying to be these are totalitarian
[2:03:46.840 --> 2:03:48.000]  folks.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:52.600]  They're trying to use religious exemptions to affect the opportunity.
[2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:55.680]  Yeah, that's the thing that we do here.
[2:03:55.680 --> 2:03:56.680]  Available resources.
[2:03:56.680 --> 2:03:57.680]  We have our own religion.
[2:03:57.680 --> 2:03:59.480]  It's called freedom of religion.
[2:03:59.480 --> 2:04:02.200]  And a patch on the jersey in this way.
[2:04:02.200 --> 2:04:05.600]  In the case of sport, no, in the case of sport, though, they're double talking if they're
[2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:09.960]  saying you're welcome while also saying that we don't encourage or we disagree with it,
[2:04:09.960 --> 2:04:13.840]  especially when there are devout people of every single religion that also welcome.
[2:04:13.840 --> 2:04:14.840]  Oh, really?
[2:04:14.840 --> 2:04:15.840]  What about Muslims?
[2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:18.280]  How do Muslims feel about gays?
[2:04:18.280 --> 2:04:19.400]  How do they feel about gays?
[2:04:19.400 --> 2:04:27.040]  Like in Qatar, FIFA tells Qatar's anti-gay hotels they will cancel their World Cup contracts
[2:04:27.040 --> 2:04:28.920]  if they reject same sex couples.
[2:04:28.920 --> 2:04:31.080]  So this thing is not going well in Qatar.
[2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:32.760]  Yeah, Muslims don't do gay stuff.
[2:04:32.760 --> 2:04:34.360]  So you don't know what you're talking about.
[2:04:34.360 --> 2:04:36.520]  But I'm glad the host there, I think is it Tony reality?
[2:04:36.520 --> 2:04:37.600]  I used to watch that show.
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:39.520]  He didn't give that woman a point.
[2:04:39.520 --> 2:04:41.360]  She got zero points for our arguments.
[2:04:41.360 --> 2:04:42.360]  But oh, you're religious.
[2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:44.160]  Sorry, no exemptions for you.
[2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:45.440]  Come on, guys.
[2:04:45.440 --> 2:04:46.440]  I'm gay.
[2:04:46.440 --> 2:04:48.880]  I stick my penis in other men's buttholes.
[2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:50.720]  You should celebrate me.
[2:04:50.720 --> 2:04:54.440]  You should celebrate the fact I put my penis in other men's buttholes.
[2:04:54.440 --> 2:04:55.440]  Celebrate me for a week.
[2:04:55.440 --> 2:04:56.440]  Damn it.
[2:04:56.440 --> 2:04:57.440]  Mike Adams, taking over.
[2:04:57.440 --> 2:05:04.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, high quality, storeable food is back in stock, ready to ship right
[2:05:04.040 --> 2:05:05.040]  now.
[2:05:05.040 --> 2:05:08.720]  We've not been selling food for three months because it was taking several weeks for the
[2:05:08.720 --> 2:05:10.920]  food to get packaged and delivered to you.
[2:05:10.920 --> 2:05:15.160]  Most of their companies are completely out, but now they have a large spectrum of high
[2:05:15.160 --> 2:05:17.480]  quality food, ready to ship.
[2:05:17.480 --> 2:05:23.000]  Everything you find at PrepareWithAlex.com or PrepareToDay.com is in stock, ready to ship.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:27.960]  So go to PrepareWithAlex.com or PrepareToDay.com and order your high quality, storeable food

[2:05:29.960 --> 2:05:33.920]  With the inflation happening, with the food shortages, with the wars, with the collapse
[2:05:33.920 --> 2:05:37.520]  in wars, everything's happening is one of the most important things you can make is
[2:05:37.520 --> 2:05:40.960]  to have high quality, storeable food, water filtration, air filtration and more.
[2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:44.840]  And it's not just those items, it's hundreds of other high quality, prepared in this items
[2:05:44.840 --> 2:05:52.000]  and survival items right now at PrepareWithAlex.com that again redirects to PrepareToday.com.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:54.960]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important things you can do
[2:05:54.960 --> 2:06:01.120]  is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning.
[2:06:01.120 --> 2:06:07.640]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[2:06:07.640 --> 2:06:15.080]  All right, welcome, folks, Mike Adams here for this hour, the third hour of the Alex
[2:06:15.080 --> 2:06:16.080]  Jones show today.
[2:06:16.080 --> 2:06:19.400]  We've got a fantastic guest coming up for you.
[2:06:19.400 --> 2:06:24.680]  But just real quick, to follow up of what Owen just said there, I mean, yeah, things
[2:06:24.680 --> 2:06:28.560]  are getting pretty insane, but I've got a solution for all of this.
[2:06:28.560 --> 2:06:34.440]  It's so simple, ANZ Bank out of Australia and New Zealand, they just announced six weeks
[2:06:34.440 --> 2:06:40.480]  of paid leave, basically a vacation if you are a transgender.
[2:06:40.480 --> 2:06:46.680]  And since there's no proof required to be transgender, it's simply a self affirmation,
[2:06:46.680 --> 2:06:52.240]  then apparently anybody can apply for six weeks of paid vacation by simply stating that
[2:06:52.240 --> 2:06:53.760]  you're transgender.
[2:06:53.760 --> 2:06:57.520]  But if the bank manager there or your boss at that bank says, well, we don't believe
[2:06:57.520 --> 2:07:00.880]  you, you don't look transgender, I've got the perfect solution for you.
[2:07:00.880 --> 2:07:03.560]  You can say, let's say you're a man, like I am here.
[2:07:03.560 --> 2:07:06.440]  You walk up to your boss, you say, Hey, I'm a transgender.
[2:07:06.440 --> 2:07:09.120]  I need six weeks paid vacations as a, what do you mean?
[2:07:09.120 --> 2:07:13.640]  So we'll look, I'm a man who self identifies as a woman.
[2:07:13.640 --> 2:07:16.840]  But that woman self identifies as a man.
[2:07:16.840 --> 2:07:22.400]  And so here I am, and I get double transgender leave, I get 12 weeks of paid leave.
[2:07:22.400 --> 2:07:24.280]  Thank you so much, ANZ Bank.
[2:07:24.280 --> 2:07:27.000]  See that's folks, you got to learn to play their game.
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:30.600]  Since it's all fairy tales and delusions, anybody can make it up.
[2:07:30.600 --> 2:07:35.640]  You can be trans anything, and I guess you can take advantage of the trans reparations
[2:07:35.640 --> 2:07:38.960]  that are now becoming commonplace around the world.
[2:07:38.960 --> 2:07:41.160]  But remember, it's all about inclusiveness.
[2:07:41.160 --> 2:07:46.040]  So make sure you're included by being double trans and you don't even have to dye your
[2:07:46.040 --> 2:07:50.920]  hair purple or get, you know, weird body art or anything, just, just be yourself and get
[2:07:50.920 --> 2:07:51.920]  12 weeks off.
[2:07:51.920 --> 2:07:52.920]  Okay.
[2:07:52.920 --> 2:07:56.840]  Anyway, that's my take on that, enough joking around.
[2:07:56.840 --> 2:07:58.280]  Now we've got some serious topics coming up.
[2:07:58.280 --> 2:07:59.880]  We've got a great guest for you.
[2:07:59.880 --> 2:08:07.000]  Alex Kristoferu, he reports every day about the situation in Russia and Ukraine, but he
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:08.800]  is located in Greece.
[2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:14.680]  And I got to say, I've been watching him for a couple of months now, and he's got the best
[2:08:14.680 --> 2:08:16.920]  analysis that I have seen out there.
[2:08:16.920 --> 2:08:21.720]  I mean, it blows away mainstream media, blows away Fox News, in my opinion, blows away CNN,
[2:08:21.720 --> 2:08:23.320]  MSNBC, all that stuff.
[2:08:23.320 --> 2:08:28.000]  He's intelligent, he's funny, he's really tied into what's going on.
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:29.560]  And this is the first time we've had him on the show.
[2:08:29.560 --> 2:08:33.920]  I was scheduled to interview him later this week, myself, but I reached out to him, he
[2:08:33.920 --> 2:08:34.920]  agreed to come on today.
[2:08:34.920 --> 2:08:36.320]  So Alex, welcome to the show.
[2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:38.960]  It's great to have you on.
[2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:39.960]  Thank you very much, Mike.
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:41.200]  It is great to be on.
[2:08:41.200 --> 2:08:43.960]  I am honored to be on your program.
[2:08:43.960 --> 2:08:45.200]  Thank you very, very much.
[2:08:45.200 --> 2:08:47.480]  Well, well, thank you for joining us.
[2:08:47.480 --> 2:08:51.000]  And since this is your first time here on the InfoWars show, I just want to give out
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  your URL.
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:55.800]  I think it's theduran.locals.com.
[2:08:55.800 --> 2:08:57.800]  Is that the primary place people can reach you?
[2:08:57.800 --> 2:09:02.320]  That is correct, that's where we put all our content, theduran.locals.com.
[2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:03.320]  Okay, great.
[2:09:03.320 --> 2:09:04.320]  Theduran.
[2:09:04.320 --> 2:09:07.600]  All right, now, here's the thing.
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:09.720]  You are doing extraordinary work.
[2:09:09.720 --> 2:09:12.680]  I mean, it's not just a podcast.
[2:09:12.680 --> 2:09:18.680]  I know you're kind of, you're filming yourself walking around these amazing areas, but sometimes
[2:09:18.680 --> 2:09:19.840]  not so amazing.
[2:09:19.840 --> 2:09:21.520]  Sometimes they're just like dirt parks.
[2:09:21.520 --> 2:09:24.080]  Other times they're beautiful parks.
[2:09:24.080 --> 2:09:27.320]  Other times you're dodging traffic in Greece, almost getting run over.
[2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:32.560]  But you're walking around areas, even I think Cyprus one time, you're walking around, but
[2:09:32.560 --> 2:09:34.520]  you're doing analysis during this.
[2:09:34.520 --> 2:09:37.840]  Give people an overview of kind of who you are, what you're doing, and why.
[2:09:37.840 --> 2:09:38.840]  Why are you doing this?
[2:09:38.840 --> 2:09:41.920]  Why are you in Greece talking about Ukraine?
[2:09:41.920 --> 2:09:48.440]  Well, I'm of Greek Cypriot origin, though I was raised in the United States.
[2:09:48.440 --> 2:09:54.320]  I spent much of my life in the U.S., so I have a love for America, I have a love for
[2:09:54.320 --> 2:10:00.120]  American politics, and I have a love for geopolitics and the politics that's happening around the
[2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:05.920]  world and how countries strategize and how they develop their foreign policy.
[2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:14.440]  And I met up with Alexander Mercuris, who is also very much from the background of diplomacy
[2:10:14.440 --> 2:10:17.440]  and law and just has a passion for geopolitics.
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:18.720]  He's based out of London.
[2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:20.800]  He's also of Greek origin.
[2:10:20.800 --> 2:10:27.440]  And we created the media channel, the Doran, and we started with one channel, which was
[2:10:27.440 --> 2:10:31.160]  just basically me and Alexander talking about geopolitics.
[2:10:31.160 --> 2:10:37.240]  So we covered a lot of the election in 2016, and we covered a lot of what was going on
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:43.880]  with Trump and all the palace intrigue in and around Trump, Russia Gate, Ukraine Gate,
[2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:48.720]  all of that stuff that happened, which actually kind of led us to where we are today with
[2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:54.360]  Ukraine and Russia, and all the things that were going on to remove Trump are very much
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:56.960]  connected to where we are today.
[2:10:56.960 --> 2:11:01.800]  And then Alexander broke off, well, we're still doing the channel together, but then
[2:11:01.800 --> 2:11:06.640]  we decided to do another channel with just Alexander and his geopolitical analysis.
[2:11:06.640 --> 2:11:10.080]  Alexander Mercuris, you can find him on all the platforms.
[2:11:10.080 --> 2:11:14.040]  And then I went off and did my channel with my analysis as well.
[2:11:14.040 --> 2:11:17.440]  So we basically have three channels in our media operation.
[2:11:17.440 --> 2:11:27.440]  But what's extraordinary, and I apologize if I'm just gushing too much here, but I'm
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:32.560]  the founder of Brighton, and so I'm viewing thousands of different channels over time
[2:11:32.560 --> 2:11:38.560]  and looking for people who are talented and people who have really good analysis and just
[2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:40.040]  noticing who's doing what.
[2:11:40.040 --> 2:11:45.920]  And I got to say, you are at the very top of your game, you're doing amazing analysis,
[2:11:45.920 --> 2:11:51.920]  you are outperforming mainstream media, you're pointing out the contradictions and the policies
[2:11:51.920 --> 2:11:58.000]  of Western thought leaders, and you even introduce us to new characters like Ursula Vanderkrazy,
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:02.380]  who is a superstar of incoherent thought, by the way.
[2:12:02.380 --> 2:12:07.640]  And it's, you know, you're really nailing it, and you're uncensored, but you're not mean.
[2:12:07.640 --> 2:12:08.640]  You're funny.
[2:12:08.640 --> 2:12:11.640]  I mean, you have a sense of humor, but it's also brilliant at the same time.
[2:12:11.640 --> 2:12:16.160]  It's a very unusual combination, so kudos to you.
[2:12:16.160 --> 2:12:22.200]  Thank you, Mike, but to be quite honest, the decision that our leaders are making, these
[2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:28.080]  decisions that they're making before the war, after the war, and what's going to happen
[2:12:28.080 --> 2:12:32.120]  after the war, the decisions that they're making are funny.
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:39.200]  Tragic, you know, as a Greek, it's very tragic, but in tragedy there is humor.
[2:12:39.200 --> 2:12:42.720]  And the decisions that we see coming out of the Biden White House, coming out of the European
[2:12:42.720 --> 2:12:46.040]  Union, it leaves us all scratching our head.
[2:12:46.040 --> 2:12:51.080]  And then when you see the decisions being made by the Russians and how they are going
[2:12:51.080 --> 2:12:58.600]  about things, they're very pragmatic, and they're very realistic and very measured.
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:01.360]  And you just kind of sit there and say, what is going on?
[2:13:01.360 --> 2:13:06.960]  Has the world turned upside down from where we were, say, in the 80s and 90s?
[2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:09.200]  Has everything flipped?
[2:13:09.200 --> 2:13:14.480]  And I just have a lot of material to work with, with regards to the comedy of what's
[2:13:14.480 --> 2:13:15.880]  going on in the West.
[2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:20.400]  Well, and let's get right into some of that, because one of the things that you have pointed
[2:13:20.400 --> 2:13:25.040]  out, and I love the fact that you tend to record in the mornings in Greece.
[2:13:25.040 --> 2:13:31.680]  And so by the time I wake up, often your video, I can watch it that day, and I've got that
[2:13:31.680 --> 2:13:36.600]  mornings update from Greece, from your perspective, of what's happening in Ukraine and Russia.
[2:13:36.600 --> 2:13:39.040]  So the timing is great, the fact that you're there.
[2:13:39.040 --> 2:13:43.360]  But one of the key issues or themes that you've really uncovered is the fact that the West,
[2:13:43.360 --> 2:13:51.920]  especially Ukraine, is fighting an information war, whereas Russia is fighting a kinetic war.
[2:13:51.920 --> 2:13:58.720]  And it's kind of like Russia's artillery versus Ukraine's bull bleepery.
[2:13:58.720 --> 2:14:01.520]  I'm a self-bleeping info wars host, so I'm not going to say the word.
[2:14:01.520 --> 2:14:07.280]  But you know, artillery versus that, you know, artillery explodes, like artillery is another
[2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:08.800]  way to communicate.
[2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:14.720]  And when you fire artillery, and it blows up, it's kind of like saying, leave or die, right?
[2:14:14.720 --> 2:14:17.920]  Like leave this area or perish.
[2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:22.240]  But Ukraine is just using all this information warfare to claim, oh, you know, 50 Russian
[2:14:22.240 --> 2:14:25.000]  generals were killed last night, and you're like, where?
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:26.080]  But what are your thoughts?
[2:14:26.080 --> 2:14:27.080]  Go ahead.
[2:14:27.080 --> 2:14:29.840]  Yeah, I mean, I completely agree with you.
[2:14:29.840 --> 2:14:34.600]  But you know, it's really interesting, because when you look at how the Zelensky regime is
[2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:40.240]  approaching this conflict, and obviously, I think we all understand that Zelensky is
[2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:41.880]  not really calling the shots.
[2:14:41.880 --> 2:14:50.120]  He's being puppeted by various forces in Europe and in the White House, various neocon forces.
[2:14:50.120 --> 2:14:55.600]  Many of these forces, once again, were the forces behind what we saw happening in Russiagate
[2:14:55.600 --> 2:15:01.160]  and Ukraine and all of these things that I'm sure you and the viewers are well aware of.
[2:15:01.160 --> 2:15:05.360]  But you know, you look at everything that they're doing, and it does kind of remind
[2:15:05.360 --> 2:15:09.520]  you as to how the Biden White House operates.
[2:15:09.520 --> 2:15:11.840]  Everything is about optics.
[2:15:11.840 --> 2:15:14.440]  Everything's PR, and everything is spin.
[2:15:14.440 --> 2:15:19.120]  And there's no real substance to what's going on, the decisions that they're making.
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:22.120]  There's no real purpose or goal.
[2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:28.160]  It's just pretty much a 24-hour news cycle, so you have the Ghost of Kiev, which I believe
[2:15:28.160 --> 2:15:30.960]  Adam Kinzinger actually retweeted.
[2:15:30.960 --> 2:15:32.400]  What are you doing, Kinzinger?
[2:15:32.400 --> 2:15:34.760]  You actually retweeted that.
[2:15:34.760 --> 2:15:38.360]  You have the fight for Snake Island.
[2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:42.680]  You have the Siege of Kiev, the Siege of Harkov, the Counter-offensive Inheritance, and all
[2:15:42.680 --> 2:15:43.680]  of these things.
[2:15:43.680 --> 2:15:44.680]  Alex, we've got to go to break.
[2:15:44.680 --> 2:15:45.960]  Sorry to cut you off here, but you're exactly right.
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:50.240]  Those are great examples of total delusional fantasy that's been exposed to fantasy.
[2:15:50.240 --> 2:15:53.080]  We'll be back with Alex Christofferu right after this break.
[2:15:53.080 --> 2:15:56.280]  Stay with us on the InfoWars broadcast.

[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:40.960]  It's not just those items.

[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:02.040]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first-ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[2:17:02.040 --> 2:17:05.640]  is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:17:05.640 --> 2:17:09.920]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it
[2:17:09.920 --> 2:17:15.080]  has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric
[2:17:15.080 --> 2:17:16.080]  effects.
[2:17:16.080 --> 2:17:21.760]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who
[2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:26.000]  they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:30.720]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[2:17:30.720 --> 2:17:32.000]  loosen up a little.
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:36.800]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[2:17:36.800 --> 2:17:42.800]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:49.000]  herbs including, but not limited to, German Kava Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Valerian
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  root.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:18:00.520]  It's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when the internet
[2:18:00.520 --> 2:18:04.680]  and mobile technology first came out, which is, we thought, this is going to level the
[2:18:04.680 --> 2:18:05.680]  playing field.
[2:18:05.680 --> 2:18:08.040]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information and everybody's going to be able
[2:18:08.040 --> 2:18:10.840]  to freely communicate that information.
[2:18:10.840 --> 2:18:16.760]  That's our goal, to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information.
[2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:21.800]  We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever
[2:18:21.800 --> 2:18:26.680]  we want, and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying
[2:18:26.680 --> 2:18:33.920]  to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations
[2:18:33.920 --> 2:18:38.920]  we're having, because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions,
[2:18:38.920 --> 2:18:42.000]  the people we want to talk to about these things.
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:45.840]  That's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take back
[2:18:45.840 --> 2:18:46.840]  their privacy.
[2:18:46.840 --> 2:18:52.160]  That's really what we're trying to do, and so I hope that everybody listening will check
[2:18:52.160 --> 2:18:57.160]  us out at boltowireless.com, that's V-O-L-T-A, wireless.com.

[2:19:58.880 --> 2:20:13.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:13.800 --> 2:20:20.560]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[2:20:20.560 --> 2:20:27.560]  It's Mike Adams, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:50.560 --> 2:21:11.680]  So I was saying in the previous segment before the commercial break where we have all these
[2:21:11.680 --> 2:21:19.520]  types of fictitious narratives being spun by the Biden White House and the European
[2:21:19.520 --> 2:21:26.720]  Union, and they're coaching Zelensky, they're puppeteering Zelensky.
[2:21:26.720 --> 2:21:32.400]  And what we have on the Russian side of things is the Russians just going about their business.
[2:21:32.400 --> 2:21:37.520]  They're fighting, well, they don't even call it a war, to be quite honest.
[2:21:37.520 --> 2:21:41.320]  They continue to call it a special military operation.
[2:21:41.320 --> 2:21:46.600]  Now they have not declared war, they have not categorized it as a war, and they continue
[2:21:46.600 --> 2:21:53.360]  to go about their business in a very methodical, very calculated way.
[2:21:53.360 --> 2:21:59.440]  And the way the Russians are going about what's happening in Ukraine is they are fighting
[2:21:59.440 --> 2:22:05.280]  the Ukraine military, they're not fighting the Ukraine people, they're not even so much
[2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:12.080]  interested in actually making big territorial gains for now.
[2:22:12.080 --> 2:22:18.240]  Their goal is very much along the lines of a Klausiewicz type of warfare where it's
[2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:26.920]  fighting the military, first you destroy the opponent's military, and then you accomplish
[2:22:26.920 --> 2:22:31.040]  your political goals, and that's how they're going about this war.
[2:22:31.040 --> 2:22:32.040]  And it's very different.
[2:22:32.040 --> 2:22:37.000]  We haven't seen something like this in the last, I don't even know, maybe the last 50
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  years we haven't seen a war being fought like this, with the artillery grinding down
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:43.040]  of the opponents.
[2:22:43.040 --> 2:22:45.240]  Thank you for jumping in there.
[2:22:45.240 --> 2:22:50.800]  If any guest can take over the segment, it's you, let me tell you, I had, I blipped out
[2:22:50.800 --> 2:22:54.600]  on my side there, but I'm back, but thanks for taking over.
[2:22:54.600 --> 2:22:58.480]  And see, that's the whole thing I was talking about, you could just jump in with the analysis
[2:22:58.480 --> 2:22:59.480]  of what's going on.
[2:22:59.480 --> 2:23:02.320]  But one of the things I wanted to ask you in this segment, and you talked about this
[2:23:02.320 --> 2:23:08.280]  this morning in your podcast, was that there might be some possible ceasefire negotiation
[2:23:08.280 --> 2:23:12.120]  on the table, although I think Russia says it's just for show.
[2:23:12.120 --> 2:23:13.120]  What's your take?
[2:23:13.120 --> 2:23:14.120]  Is that a serious thing?
[2:23:14.120 --> 2:23:16.320]  Could we see a ceasefire or not?
[2:23:16.320 --> 2:23:18.520]  Are we way past that?
[2:23:18.520 --> 2:23:23.560]  Look, I believe we're, I don't want to say we're way past that.
[2:23:23.560 --> 2:23:24.560]  I don't know.
[2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:31.400]  I don't have any information that'll let me into the minds of the Kremlin.
[2:23:31.400 --> 2:23:39.000]  But in my opinion, I believe that the Putin government, they're always going to keep the
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  door open, and they're always going to keep the door open for diplomacy.
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:47.200]  Because for them, fighting this war is also about diplomacy.
[2:23:47.200 --> 2:23:52.640]  I mentioned how Klausiewicz's military theory plays out for the Russians, and they follow
[2:23:52.640 --> 2:23:55.280]  that military theory very closely.
[2:23:55.280 --> 2:24:02.520]  And Klausiewicz said that you fight a war for political means, they go hand in hand.
[2:24:02.520 --> 2:24:06.840]  And so I think the Russians will always engage in dialogue with Ukraine.
[2:24:06.840 --> 2:24:12.200]  But the problem for the Russians is that, who are they speaking to on the other end?
[2:24:12.200 --> 2:24:14.280]  Can Zelensky call the shots?
[2:24:14.280 --> 2:24:16.400]  Can he make decisions?
[2:24:16.400 --> 2:24:24.040]  Are they willing to compromise and to meet the Russians towards their demands?
[2:24:24.040 --> 2:24:28.280]  The Russians don't trust Zelensky anymore, they don't trust the West anymore because
[2:24:28.280 --> 2:24:33.080]  all they've seen for the past eight years are lies from the West.
[2:24:33.080 --> 2:24:37.840]  And what they asked for before the war broke out, before this special military operation
[2:24:37.840 --> 2:24:43.320]  was launched, they asked for some very simple things for Ukraine to be neutral and for the
[2:24:43.320 --> 2:24:47.080]  Minsk Accords to be implemented.
[2:24:47.080 --> 2:24:48.160]  That's it.
[2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:51.040]  But the West never did it.
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:55.720]  And we got to remember, Germany and France, they signed the Minsk Accords eight years
[2:24:55.720 --> 2:25:03.520]  ago, so they were obligated to push Ukraine to implement that agreement.
[2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:04.520]  It never happened.
[2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:07.760]  So I think trust is gone, but the door is always open.
[2:25:07.760 --> 2:25:14.880]  Well, Alex, I think what you're talking about is just a small example of a much larger problem
[2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:21.040]  involving the downfall of reason and rationality among Western civilization.
[2:25:21.040 --> 2:25:27.120]  So for example, when we here in America, when we try to interact with the federal government
[2:25:27.120 --> 2:25:36.200]  on anything, regulation, taxes, immigration, anything, it's like talking to insane people.
[2:25:36.200 --> 2:25:37.920]  There's no rational response.
[2:25:37.920 --> 2:25:44.840]  I mean, did you know the IRS here in the States, by the way, has entire floors of tax or IRS
[2:25:44.840 --> 2:25:50.440]  buildings, entire floors stacked with unopened mail from two to three years ago, they haven't
[2:25:50.440 --> 2:25:55.320]  sent out tax refunds to some people for two years, and they're paying hundreds of billions
[2:25:55.320 --> 2:26:01.560]  of dollars in penalties against the government on interest that they owe to people on their
[2:26:01.560 --> 2:26:02.560]  tax refund.
[2:26:02.560 --> 2:26:07.920]  So, you know, I'm not surprised that Putin can't really talk to the West because we can't
[2:26:07.920 --> 2:26:10.120]  either and we live here.
[2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:14.480]  That's so shocking about the situation.
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:15.920]  Look at Biden's energy policy.
[2:26:15.920 --> 2:26:19.320]  Look at where the U.S., look at where the U.K. is, look at where Europe is.
[2:26:19.320 --> 2:26:21.280]  It didn't have to come to this.
[2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:26.280]  The first thing Biden did, he got rid of the Keystone Pipeline and then they pushed this
[2:26:26.280 --> 2:26:29.360]  war and they really did push this war on to Russia.
[2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:31.440]  Russia felt like its back was against the wall.
[2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:37.960]  So they pushed this war and they come out with these shocking all sanctions, which at
[2:26:37.960 --> 2:26:43.640]  the end of the day, all it does is it damages the economies of the European Union and the
[2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:44.640]  United States.
[2:26:44.640 --> 2:26:47.320]  That's all they've done, period.
[2:26:47.320 --> 2:26:50.640]  They haven't got a regime change in Russia.
[2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:53.080]  They haven't destroyed the Putin economy.
[2:26:53.080 --> 2:26:54.760]  They haven't weakened the ruble.
[2:26:54.760 --> 2:26:58.920]  They haven't stopped Russia from exporting its gas and its oil and its commodities and
[2:26:58.920 --> 2:27:01.680]  its fertilizers and its weed and all of these things.
[2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:03.680]  They haven't accomplished any of that.
[2:27:03.680 --> 2:27:06.080]  Don't you remember Biden during his State of the Union address?
[2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:11.120]  What was it like two months ago where he said, we're going to turn the ruble into rubble?
[2:27:11.120 --> 2:27:12.120]  Where's the ruble today?
[2:27:12.120 --> 2:27:13.720]  Stronger than ever.
[2:27:13.720 --> 2:27:15.880]  Becker to highs versus the dollar, yeah.
[2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:18.160]  But you see that it's the same deception.
[2:27:18.160 --> 2:27:22.440]  I mean, it's like when people go to the grocery store and they're paying 50% more for food
[2:27:22.440 --> 2:27:27.600]  or they go to the gas pump and they're paying now very nearly $5 a gallon for gas on average,
[2:27:27.600 --> 2:27:29.720]  which is the highest all time.
[2:27:29.720 --> 2:27:32.760]  And it's probably going to $10 a gallon later this year.
[2:27:32.760 --> 2:27:37.240]  All we get from the administration is the same kind of lies that Zelensky pushes in
[2:27:37.240 --> 2:27:38.400]  Ukraine.
[2:27:38.400 --> 2:27:43.760]  You get these absurd explanations like, oh, well, you know, if food is more scarce, maybe
[2:27:43.760 --> 2:27:47.320]  it's Joe Biden's miraculous American weight loss plan and we'll save money on healthcare
[2:27:47.320 --> 2:27:48.440]  costs or something.
[2:27:48.440 --> 2:27:49.440]  It's like what?
[2:27:49.440 --> 2:27:53.800]  I mean, people are trying to eat and then they blame Putin for everything.
[2:27:53.800 --> 2:27:58.120]  Remember inflation, for example, last year they said there's no inflation, then they
[2:27:58.120 --> 2:28:02.840]  said it's transitory inflation, then they said it's Putin's inflation and then a few
[2:28:02.840 --> 2:28:05.600]  days ago, the New York Times says inflation, it's good.
[2:28:05.600 --> 2:28:10.840]  I thought you said there was no, you're not dealing with rational actors.
[2:28:10.840 --> 2:28:13.040]  This is the problem.
[2:28:13.040 --> 2:28:14.840]  I completely agree with you.
[2:28:14.840 --> 2:28:16.080]  It didn't have to come to this.
[2:28:16.080 --> 2:28:17.600]  It really did not have to come to this.
[2:28:17.600 --> 2:28:22.920]  But there are forces at work that are making the decisions for the Biden White House and
[2:28:22.920 --> 2:28:28.200]  they are the same forces that are making the decisions in Ukraine and for Zelensky.
[2:28:28.200 --> 2:28:33.040]  And these are going to be the same forces that are going to push us to another conflict.
[2:28:33.040 --> 2:28:35.760]  China, perhaps.
[2:28:35.760 --> 2:28:40.120]  Well let's talk about that conflict after this break that's coming right up here.
[2:28:40.120 --> 2:28:42.840]  And I really appreciate you and your analysis.
[2:28:42.840 --> 2:28:46.960]  It's Alex Christofarou, everybody at TheDuran.Locals.com.
[2:28:46.960 --> 2:28:52.480]  We'll be right back after this break to talk about China and possibly a two front war for
[2:28:52.480 --> 2:28:53.480]  America.

[2:29:37.160 --> 2:29:39.560]  food, water filtration, air filtration and more.

[2:30:17.400 --> 2:30:23.120]  sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling
[2:30:23.120 --> 2:30:24.120]  these for.

[2:31:05.480 --> 2:31:10.760]  circumvent and override the sensors has been patriot, apparel so we can identify each other
[2:31:10.760 --> 2:31:15.600]  so we can spread the word and so we can push people to websites like InfoWars.com so they
[2:31:15.600 --> 2:31:18.560]  can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[2:31:18.560 --> 2:31:21.520]  Now ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our

[2:31:36.760 --> 2:31:37.760]  and they'll be history.

[2:32:06.080 --> 2:32:07.080]  now.
[2:32:07.080 --> 2:32:12.920]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry, you guys have no idea how many people
[2:32:12.920 --> 2:32:18.000]  have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez, how many people have just been put on a launch
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:23.680]  pad to outer space because of Alex Jones including myself, I've been given so many opportunities
[2:32:23.680 --> 2:32:28.600]  because of this man and because of this platform and I would probably not even be half of where
[2:32:28.600 --> 2:32:32.800]  I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones, I mean I've been able to be on podcasts with
[2:32:32.800 --> 2:32:38.360]  Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL, listen what I'm saying is do
[2:32:38.360 --> 2:32:43.600]  not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted because you don't know what you have until
[2:32:43.600 --> 2:32:44.600]  it's gone.
[2:32:44.600 --> 2:32:49.200]  You need to support free speech systems right now so go check out the store, go support
[2:32:49.200 --> 2:32:58.600]  their store, go support InfoWars, leave a donation right now, don't wait until they're gone.
[2:32:58.600 --> 2:33:16.600]  Pleading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:16.600 --> 2:33:26.640]  You found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show with Mike Adams.
[2:33:26.640 --> 2:33:30.640]  All right welcome back folks, Mike Adams here, we're continuing with our guest Alex
[2:33:30.640 --> 2:33:36.160]  Christofarou who is reporting from Greece on a daily basis doing outstanding analysis,
[2:33:36.160 --> 2:33:39.760]  just a couple of quick comments and then we're going to go right back to you Alex, I just
[2:33:39.760 --> 2:33:41.760]  want to mention two important things.
[2:33:41.760 --> 2:33:46.640]  Number one, for those listening from the state of Texas and I don't mean just the people
[2:33:46.640 --> 2:33:53.800]  but also the government of Texas, I've got to urge you to prepare for the dollar collapse,
[2:33:53.800 --> 2:33:58.800]  the total collapse of the fiat currency, the dollar, but states like Texas by launching
[2:33:58.800 --> 2:34:05.200]  their own state currencies or in our case goldback currency, Texas can weather the storm
[2:34:05.200 --> 2:34:11.400]  and do extremely well as the United States of America dissociates, falls apart, I believe
[2:34:11.400 --> 2:34:14.800]  that's coming and in fact I'm going to ask Alex his thoughts on sort of where all this
[2:34:14.800 --> 2:34:16.520]  is headed as well.
[2:34:16.520 --> 2:34:21.400]  Secondly, and you know this is not a paid plug or anything but I just got this today
[2:34:21.400 --> 2:34:27.560]  from Ghost Gunner, this is this block of aluminum that you can turn into an AR-15 lower receiver
[2:34:27.560 --> 2:34:30.880]  and I'm super thrilled because I've owned all the Ghost Gunners over the years like
[2:34:30.880 --> 2:34:35.760]  the Ghost Gunner 2 and the 3 and I've been waiting for this block of aluminum for months
[2:34:35.760 --> 2:34:43.360]  and you know this can be turned into basically a rifle and I'm going to do that process and
[2:34:43.360 --> 2:34:48.120]  I wonder if Washington is going to try to ban aluminum blocks because of you know they
[2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:53.120]  try to ban Russia from doing anything economically, will they ban aluminum from America and watch
[2:34:53.120 --> 2:34:58.360]  the economy collapse in their efforts to try to take away the ability for people to manufacture
[2:34:58.360 --> 2:35:03.040]  their own firearms for self-defense so that'll be interesting but you can also make lower
[2:35:03.040 --> 2:35:06.920]  receivers out of other things beyond aluminum so I'm kind of wondering and this is my first
[2:35:06.920 --> 2:35:11.400]  question you Alex, do you think the US will try to ban the entire table of elements like
[2:35:11.400 --> 2:35:16.360]  no copper, no aluminum, nothing from the table of elements because it might be used to make
[2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:19.800]  a weapon, are we going to get that insane?
[2:35:19.800 --> 2:35:25.280]  I would not be surprised, I really would not, I would say no we're not going to get that
[2:35:25.280 --> 2:35:30.600]  insane but you know what every day they shock me but you make an interesting point you see
[2:35:30.600 --> 2:35:34.280]  the moves of the Biden White House and what they've done for example confiscating the
[2:35:34.280 --> 2:35:39.440]  assets of Russian oligarchs like other countries don't have oligarchs, every country has their
[2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:43.520]  billionaires and their oligarchs that's fine we accept that but you know they use this
[2:35:43.520 --> 2:35:50.080]  term confiscating the wealth of Russian oligarchs but you know it is theft, I'm not saying these
[2:35:50.080 --> 2:35:55.200]  guys are good or bad, I'm not there to judge but you just can't take people's property
[2:35:55.200 --> 2:36:00.040]  and I sit there and I wonder okay so now you're taking Abramovich's yachts and planes and you're
[2:36:00.040 --> 2:36:05.800]  confiscating that stuff or you're confiscating the foreign reserves of a country, a G20 country
[2:36:05.800 --> 2:36:10.440]  what they did to Russia unheard of, unheard of the confiscate the foreign reserves of
[2:36:10.440 --> 2:36:17.960]  a G20 country, you're doing these things, when are you going to come after me?
[2:36:17.960 --> 2:36:22.000]  Your government there, the government of Greece also under pressure from the US I think it
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:27.240]  was last week they rolled up onto Iranian, I believe it was Iranian oil tankers and just
[2:36:27.240 --> 2:36:33.120]  open seas piracy just started stealing all the oil, it's like is this our world now where
[2:36:33.120 --> 2:36:39.760]  yeah I mean maybe the American flag should be replaced with like the skull and crossbones
[2:36:39.760 --> 2:36:43.800]  like the pirates of the high seas flag, we're just going to steal all your stuff if we can
[2:36:43.800 --> 2:36:47.800]  find it, is that what it's come to?
[2:36:47.800 --> 2:36:51.680]  Is that his way to find oil now, I mean he's going to Saudi Arabia, well he was supposed
[2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:55.840]  to go to Saudi Arabia I don't know anymore, he's going to Venezuela, he's going to Iran
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:37:00.760]  by the way the Iranians after that ship was confiscated by Greece they confiscated two
[2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:06.760]  Greek ships in retaliation, so I mean is this what we're coming to?
[2:37:06.760 --> 2:37:11.360]  Well I mean if Joe Biden put on an eyepatch and a funny hat and started going horny hor,
[2:37:11.360 --> 2:37:15.080]  I mean no one would be surprised, it was like oh that's just Biden, you know he's just
[2:37:15.080 --> 2:37:20.160]  doing his pirate motif right there because it's all theater, you know they had a hologram
[2:37:20.160 --> 2:37:25.360]  of the Queen of England in a royal carriage being dragged through the streets of London
[2:37:25.360 --> 2:37:30.440]  with I mean it was an actual hologram in the carriage, that was just a few days ago people
[2:37:30.440 --> 2:37:36.560]  were waving at the hologram and I'm just thinking wow the queen in a carriage being
[2:37:36.560 --> 2:37:42.400]  dragged through the streets of London, she's the only actual drag queen who's a queen and
[2:37:42.400 --> 2:37:47.560]  a hologram nonetheless, I mean this is how insane our world has become but I don't see
[2:37:47.560 --> 2:37:52.720]  any end to this, absolutely, yeah they're showing the video right now it's a hologram
[2:37:52.720 --> 2:37:57.080]  of the queen waving and you know I'm just thinking hey if you have a hologram have
[2:37:57.080 --> 2:38:02.000]  her do something more interesting in that carriage, you know she could be dancing or
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:06.680]  something and they're doing backflips you know, twerking, who knows I mean use your
[2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:13.440]  imagination, why just have her wave but where do you think all this is going Alex?
[2:38:13.440 --> 2:38:18.400]  Well you know I think you've pretty much summed it up, nothing is real anymore it seems, nothing
[2:38:18.400 --> 2:38:28.880]  is real, it's all become some type of fictitious Truman Show movie is what it reminds me of,
[2:38:28.880 --> 2:38:33.000]  there's no reality anymore but there is going to be some reality that's going to be hitting
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:40.040]  the west very very soon including the country where I am and that's going to be the fuel
[2:38:40.040 --> 2:38:50.720]  hikes, the gas hikes, the inflation, the food, the increase in prices for food, energy shortages,
[2:38:50.720 --> 2:38:55.000]  people are going to have to sit down and they're going to say what do I do, do I pay my energy
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:39:01.400]  bill, do I fill up my car or do I buy a loaf of bread, I mean this is going to be real
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:06.360]  stuff that's going to hit us and it's going to come fast and it's going to really really
[2:39:06.360 --> 2:39:10.600]  hurt and it's going to be historic because I don't think we've ever experienced these
[2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:14.720]  things, I mean I know it's coming to Europe, I mean it's almost already here, you have
[2:39:14.720 --> 2:39:20.840]  the UK saying that they have shortages of sunflower oil and this and that, you had the
[2:39:20.840 --> 2:39:25.920]  United States, you had baby formula shortages, we're sitting here in Greece and we're thinking
[2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:32.760]  how does the US have shortages of baby formulas, it's like we're stunned but we're just at
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:37.680]  the beginning of this and this is going to be reality, this is where reality crashes
[2:39:37.680 --> 2:39:38.680]  into fantasy.
[2:39:38.680 --> 2:39:44.120]  Well not only are we unable to feed our babies in America apparently with this processed
[2:39:44.120 --> 2:39:50.480]  infant formula which is something by the way that even the most low tech isolated jungle
[2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:58.440]  tribe that you could find by hiking through wet terrain and the marshes and you might
[2:39:58.440 --> 2:40:03.000]  find a tribe, they could feed their babies but we can't feed our babies in the most
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:07.480]  advanced supposedly nation in the world, it's extraordinary but here's my question to you
[2:40:07.480 --> 2:40:12.720]  on this, what about the local people that you talk to there in Greece, is there any kind
[2:40:12.720 --> 2:40:19.440]  of local realization of how bad it's going to be this coming winter when the energy shortages
[2:40:19.440 --> 2:40:24.320]  become a life and death issue, what are people saying there locally?
[2:40:24.320 --> 2:40:28.400]  Oh they're furious, they're furious with the government and the polling is showing it,
[2:40:28.400 --> 2:40:32.880]  you have around the latest poll I saw was around 70, 75% of the Greeks are very much
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:40.440]  opposed to the government and its policy towards Russia, specifically the sanctions, I mean
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:46.400]  we've got the war, the special military operation, whatever you want to call it, the invasion,
[2:40:46.400 --> 2:40:50.440]  whatever you want to call it is one thing, the sanctions, people are scratching in their
[2:40:50.440 --> 2:40:55.800]  heads and they're saying after two years of lockdowns, this is what you guys come up with
[2:40:55.800 --> 2:41:02.120]  at the European Union, sanctioning Russia who supplies all the wheat, all the fertilizer,
[2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:08.280]  all the gas, all the oil, all the metals, every single commodity that we use to live
[2:41:08.280 --> 2:41:13.120]  our life, you're going to sanction them, it is, I mean shoot yourself in both feet and
[2:41:13.120 --> 2:41:19.240]  then just take a gun and just boom, I mean people are furious with it, they're furious
[2:41:19.240 --> 2:41:24.120]  with our government and they want the government to reverse course.
[2:41:24.120 --> 2:41:29.560]  That's great to hear and I would think it's perhaps even worse in Germany because Germany
[2:41:29.560 --> 2:41:34.680]  needs a lot more heating energy in the winter, Germany has a huge industrial base that needs
[2:41:34.680 --> 2:41:39.200]  all the power derived from fossil fuels for the most part, I know Germany has solar panels
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:46.080]  and so on but that's only a small percentage of the power that's needed and this climate
[2:41:46.080 --> 2:41:50.520]  cult that took over Western Europe and the United States and Canada over the last ten
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:55.160]  years or so, the climate cult has said well all fossil fuels are bad, we're going to
[2:41:55.160 --> 2:42:01.080]  shut them down and then good luck finding a replacement, I mean they never had a transition
[2:42:01.080 --> 2:42:07.880]  plan but Russia is more realistic, I mean Russia probably working on free energy tech
[2:42:07.880 --> 2:42:11.600]  that they're going to roll out, they're going to go right from fossil fuels to free energy
[2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:15.240]  and not even worry about wind turbines, what do you think?
[2:42:15.240 --> 2:42:21.560]  Oh yeah, Russia's, you know the Russians are very pragmatic, they're a realist society
[2:42:21.560 --> 2:42:24.440]  and yeah they're going to have their gas, they're going to have their oil, they're
[2:42:24.440 --> 2:42:29.560]  going to have their nuclear, people forget that the Russians, you know they do nuclear,
[2:42:29.560 --> 2:42:33.800]  they build a lot of nuclear reactors, they're building one in Turkey right now, so I mean
[2:42:33.800 --> 2:42:38.600]  they're going to be okay, India's going to be okay, China's going to be okay.
[2:42:38.600 --> 2:42:41.680]  Well and Turkey by the way, we're going to go to break again but when we come back I
[2:42:41.680 --> 2:42:47.760]  want to ask you about Turkey and Erdogan who has been a brilliant diplomat and to any of
[2:42:47.760 --> 2:42:51.800]  you listening in Turkey we want to swap presidents with you, please you can have Biden, we want
[2:42:51.800 --> 2:42:55.800]  Erdogan here in America because he actually knows what he's doing, we'll be right back
[2:42:55.800 --> 2:42:57.840]  on the Alex Jones show, stay with us.

[2:44:06.800 --> 2:44:10.440]  William in California, people are asleep and program controlled.
[2:44:10.440 --> 2:44:12.840]  I agree, how do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[2:44:12.840 --> 2:44:14.840]  Hi Alice, thanks for taking my call.
[2:44:14.840 --> 2:44:16.840]  Can I plug Iowits real quick?
[2:44:16.840 --> 2:44:17.840]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2:44:17.840 --> 2:44:23.800]  I'm in my 60s and I did the work of 25, 30 year olds and I worked them into the ground
[2:44:23.800 --> 2:44:28.120]  and you wanted to know why and I've tested this and I've taken your B12 and let me tell
[2:44:28.120 --> 2:44:31.520]  you, when I don't take it, I pay a price, I really do.
[2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:34.720]  I take that B12 and I am electric, man.
[2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:40.280]  I can run 10 miles, I do some pretty heavy work with a highway department and my friends
[2:44:40.280 --> 2:44:46.080]  will attest to the fact that yeah, for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70 and I'm
[2:44:46.080 --> 2:44:57.760]  still, I'm not just blowing smoke here, the B12 saves my life.
[2:44:57.760 --> 2:45:01.480]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially with
[2:45:01.480 --> 2:45:03.440]  word of mouth and prayer.
[2:45:03.440 --> 2:45:06.840]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[2:45:06.840 --> 2:45:12.800]  caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you, humanity has a real fighting
[2:45:12.800 --> 2:45:13.800]  chance.
[2:45:13.800 --> 2:45:17.800]  I just want to thank you all for buying products and InfoWarsStore.com like books and films
[2:45:17.800 --> 2:45:21.160]  and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.

[2:45:57.560 --> 2:46:02.800]  I want to take a minute out to address the viewers and listeners of InfoWars and to remind
[2:46:02.800 --> 2:46:08.600]  you that we've been vindicated and that world government and its tyrannical aim of depopulation
[2:46:08.600 --> 2:46:10.720]  is now out of the open.
[2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:15.400]  Everything you and I have done together has been distorted and we cannot continue in this
[2:46:15.400 --> 2:46:17.200]  fight without your support.
[2:46:17.200 --> 2:46:21.160]  I want to encourage you all to be part of this dream right now, but you still can to
[2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:27.040]  get the third and final coin in the founding member coin series, the come and take it free
[2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:35.520]  men bear arms coins at 1776coin.com and just a few days this coin will be gone forever
[2:46:35.520 --> 2:46:41.000]  and you will have the coin in your possession and know you helped InfoWars stay on air at
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:44.240]  the most critical time in our 28 year history.
[2:46:44.240 --> 2:46:47.400]  So I want to thank you all for your support and I want to encourage you all to be part
[2:46:47.400 --> 2:46:53.720]  of history and to get this historic memento that keeps us on air at info wars store.com
[2:46:53.720 --> 2:46:58.600]  or 1776coin.com while you still can.
[2:46:58.600 --> 2:47:09.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:09.560 --> 2:47:16.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones with Mike
[2:47:16.880 --> 2:47:17.880]  Adams.
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:22.040]  When you wake up in the morning and the night is written.
[2:47:22.040 --> 2:47:27.480]  Thank God for InfoWars, thank God for the perseverance of people like Alex Jones and
[2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:34.440]  Owen Schreuer and Harrison and many others who are enduring this incredible law fair
[2:47:34.440 --> 2:47:35.440]  attempt.
[2:47:35.440 --> 2:47:40.400]  Try to silence them and take them offline and yet so far those attempts have failed
[2:47:40.400 --> 2:47:46.200]  and it's only made InfoWars stronger and more resilient because see I believe a day is coming
[2:47:46.200 --> 2:47:49.520]  in the not too distant future when America breaks apart.
[2:47:49.520 --> 2:47:55.080]  I think we're going to see secession, we're going to see probably new region states like
[2:47:55.080 --> 2:47:58.680]  maybe Texas or a greater Texas and other regions.
[2:47:58.680 --> 2:48:02.560]  We're going to see probably part of California break away from the west coast.
[2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:07.640]  This is all coming and there's going to be a whole new infrastructure of media and that
[2:48:07.640 --> 2:48:12.840]  media will include some projects that Trump's team is working on but also I think InfoWars
[2:48:12.840 --> 2:48:14.840]  is the spearhead of that.
[2:48:14.840 --> 2:48:20.080]  Of course, I'm doing my part to try to have platforms actually doing very well with that.
[2:48:20.080 --> 2:48:25.320]  In fact, Alex is scheduled, Alex Crystal Faroo here I guess right now, I'm scheduled
[2:48:25.320 --> 2:48:29.760]  to interview him again later this week for a Brighton interview so we're going to be
[2:48:29.760 --> 2:48:34.280]  doing that and InfoWars episodes are also on our platform.
[2:48:34.280 --> 2:48:39.480]  We're all just working for liberty to try to save America or even perhaps to save what's
[2:48:39.480 --> 2:48:42.760]  left of America but thank God for InfoWars.
[2:48:42.760 --> 2:48:49.320]  Support InfoWarsStore.com and remember whatever you purchase today is at probably the lowest
[2:48:49.320 --> 2:48:52.080]  price you're ever going to see because of inflation.
[2:48:52.080 --> 2:48:53.800]  Everything is going up.
[2:48:53.800 --> 2:48:58.760]  We're just talking to our suppliers, I think last night getting emails from them as yep,
[2:48:58.760 --> 2:49:04.400]  20% increase here, 27% there and then other suppliers are like oh yeah, that big order
[2:49:04.400 --> 2:49:08.720]  you placed, we don't have any of that anymore, all that food's gone.
[2:49:08.720 --> 2:49:11.240]  So Alex bringing you back in and thank you for joining me again today.
[2:49:11.240 --> 2:49:15.680]  Your website is theduran.locals.com at least that's where people can find you.
[2:49:15.680 --> 2:49:21.520]  This is Alex Christoferou from Greece but Alex I got to say, I don't know if you keep
[2:49:21.520 --> 2:49:27.880]  in touch with family or friends in America but here in Texas we are seeing massive inflation
[2:49:27.880 --> 2:49:34.360]  and we know this is the result of the deplatforming of Russia, money printing but also the fact
[2:49:34.360 --> 2:49:39.080]  that then Russia cannot contribute to the exports of the world in terms of fertilizer
[2:49:39.080 --> 2:49:42.080]  and grain and commodities and so on so everything is going up.
[2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:47.040]  We are getting punished and Putin is raking in the dough with record revenues.
[2:49:47.040 --> 2:49:48.040]  It's incredible.
[2:49:48.040 --> 2:49:56.280]  Yeah, I mean it's, I couldn't have summed it up better myself, I mean you had the lockdowns,
[2:49:56.280 --> 2:50:03.200]  you had an economy that was going to return, the US economy was going to work back after
[2:50:03.200 --> 2:50:04.200]  the lockdowns.
[2:50:04.200 --> 2:50:08.960]  It was going to be fine if Biden just did one thing, that was nothing, he didn't have
[2:50:08.960 --> 2:50:14.640]  to do anything but instead they had to pump all those trillions into the economy because
[2:50:14.640 --> 2:50:19.480]  they thought they're going to supercharge things and I mean who would have thought that
[2:50:19.480 --> 2:50:24.560]  if you pump trillions into the economy you're going to overheat things and get inflation.
[2:50:24.560 --> 2:50:25.560]  Who would have thought that?
[2:50:25.560 --> 2:50:29.280]  I mean and then you have these sanctions against Russia.
[2:50:29.280 --> 2:50:35.240]  Yeah, but what's incredible is, you know I mean I did a piece today about how the experts,
[2:50:35.240 --> 2:50:40.080]  the so-called experts are wrong about almost everything, especially about monetary theory
[2:50:40.080 --> 2:50:44.280]  or MMT as it's called, I know you've covered that before but they believe they can print
[2:50:44.280 --> 2:50:49.440]  endless money with no ill effects whatsoever but you know this is not just, I mean you
[2:50:49.440 --> 2:50:53.440]  and I joke about it Alex because you have a great sense of humor and I try to joke around
[2:50:53.440 --> 2:50:59.280]  too but this is not really a joking matter in the sense that this is the end coming.
[2:50:59.280 --> 2:51:05.800]  I mean if we don't change course, how does Western civilization function because it's
[2:51:05.800 --> 2:51:12.600]  an empire of debt and lies and when that empire implodes is there anything left to salvage?
[2:51:12.600 --> 2:51:13.600]  What do you think?
[2:51:13.600 --> 2:51:20.440]  Yeah, I mean you know I laugh but you know I want to cry because it is sad to watch
[2:51:20.440 --> 2:51:29.240]  all of these things crumble in front of our eyes but you know I do believe that when all
[2:51:29.240 --> 2:51:33.840]  is said and done the United States will find their way back.
[2:51:33.840 --> 2:51:41.240]  Europe I'm not so sure about but the US is resilient, it has the natural resources, it
[2:51:41.240 --> 2:51:47.400]  just has to stop all of these foreign adventures and it has to focus on America.
[2:51:47.400 --> 2:51:53.360]  If they focus on America and America first, Trump said it best, if they just implement
[2:51:53.360 --> 2:51:59.000]  the America first policy then the United States will find their way back but if they
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:04.440]  continue to go down this route of trying to destroy the Constitution, trying to supercharge
[2:52:04.440 --> 2:52:11.320]  this green ideology and this deindustrialization which they're implementing on Germany now
[2:52:11.320 --> 2:52:17.320]  then you're looking at a disaster but you know I just hope it's not too late.
[2:52:17.320 --> 2:52:24.800]  Europe I'm not so confident about but I think the US has the political system and it has
[2:52:24.800 --> 2:52:28.840]  leaders who are in place that can turn the ship around.
[2:52:28.840 --> 2:52:32.400]  It's not going to be easy but I think it can happen.
[2:52:32.400 --> 2:52:36.320]  Well you make some really good points there, I agree with you that the resilience of the
[2:52:36.320 --> 2:52:40.560]  American spirit is alive and well and I guess one of the questions though is will there
[2:52:40.560 --> 2:52:47.920]  ever be fair and free elections again because we still haven't eliminated the rigged voting,
[2:52:47.920 --> 2:52:52.080]  the ballot stuffing, problems with some of the machines and so on and we only have to
[2:52:52.080 --> 2:52:56.520]  look at another country, Venezuela, to see a nation that had plenty of resources, lots
[2:52:56.520 --> 2:53:02.240]  of oil, lots of minerals, lots of ability to produce food and yet because of the corruption
[2:53:02.240 --> 2:53:07.320]  and the tyranny, Venezuela has all but collapsed over the last decade or so.
[2:53:07.320 --> 2:53:11.760]  So I mean you're right Alex, nations have to make a choice, the thing is you know America
[2:53:11.760 --> 2:53:16.840]  made a choice in 2020, we chose Trump, we didn't choose Biden but it was stolen from
[2:53:16.840 --> 2:53:21.640]  us so and I know in Greece by the way in the history of Greece, you know Greece has gone
[2:53:21.640 --> 2:53:28.240]  through the same thing, actually still struggling in many ways, you know economic collapse,
[2:53:28.240 --> 2:53:32.000]  political corruption just perhaps even worse than what we've seen in America if that's
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:39.480]  even possible but nations have to choose to survive or they do not make it, your comments
[2:53:39.480 --> 2:53:40.480]  on that.
[2:53:40.480 --> 2:53:48.240]  Yeah I mean you're exactly right, what happened in 2020 and even before 2020 to me Russiagate
[2:53:48.240 --> 2:53:54.200]  was the real tragedy, what happened there took the United States down a very dangerous
[2:53:54.200 --> 2:54:03.240]  path and Americans are just going to have to find a way to reverse course and it's
[2:54:03.240 --> 2:54:11.640]  not going to be easy but the American system, the constitution I believe is built in a way
[2:54:11.640 --> 2:54:17.800]  that will safeguard the United States and the future of its people and it's that constitution
[2:54:17.800 --> 2:54:28.200]  that America has to look on, has to kneel on, that is the document that's going to see
[2:54:28.200 --> 2:54:32.960]  the country through this hard time but what worries me are the forces that are trying
[2:54:32.960 --> 2:54:36.680]  to tear apart the constitution, that's what really worries me because it's going to be
[2:54:36.680 --> 2:54:42.520]  that document that is going to get the US out of this mess, Europe doesn't have this
[2:54:42.520 --> 2:54:49.360]  document we don't have this thing, the US has it but you can't go about wanting to destroy
[2:54:49.360 --> 2:54:54.480]  it because if you destroy the constitution then you have nothing so I think the US will
[2:54:54.480 --> 2:54:57.080]  make it through.
[2:54:57.080 --> 2:55:01.280]  Lawmakers on the left in America of course are trying to systematically destroy the constitution
[2:55:01.280 --> 2:55:07.920]  but I agree with you as long as we honor it that structure will save us, we have the second
[2:55:07.920 --> 2:55:11.200]  amendment, the first amendment, the entire bill of rights and of course we have the
[2:55:11.200 --> 2:55:17.680]  Supreme Court with us as well but talk to us about China, the possibility of a war with
[2:55:17.680 --> 2:55:23.040]  China maybe starting with a financial war or even a cyber war, how do you think the
[2:55:23.040 --> 2:55:26.400]  United States might be threatened by China in the near future?
[2:55:26.400 --> 2:55:31.120]  Well, I think that the Biden White House is looking for a way out of Ukraine, I think
[2:55:31.120 --> 2:55:35.120]  they want an off ramp, I think they want a distraction, they want a memory hole Ukraine
[2:55:35.120 --> 2:55:42.080]  because it's been one big huge foreign policy mess for the Biden White House and I think
[2:55:42.080 --> 2:55:46.080]  there are some people in the Biden White House, Lincoln and Sullivan and these guys that actually
[2:55:46.080 --> 2:55:53.120]  believe a good distraction and a possible win could come from poking at China and I
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:58.400]  think they actually believe that so we had sanctions against Chinese officials six months
[2:55:58.400 --> 2:56:05.400]  ago and to me that's the first sign that we're heading towards the sanctions escalator
[2:56:05.400 --> 2:56:09.920]  and when you get to the top of the sanctions escalator you come to one conclusion which
[2:56:09.920 --> 2:56:10.920]  is conflict.
[2:56:10.920 --> 2:56:17.440]  So you think that the United States might try to provoke a conflict with China, is what
[2:56:17.440 --> 2:56:20.600]  I hear you saying, is that right?
[2:56:20.600 --> 2:56:27.840]  I believe there are people in the White House who honestly believe that they could win a
[2:56:27.840 --> 2:56:34.360]  conflict with China in order to make up for the big L that they're taking with Russia
[2:56:34.360 --> 2:56:37.840]  and Ukraine and it is a big L.
[2:56:37.840 --> 2:56:47.680]  Wow, well, beware of initiating a land war with Russia and also beware of a sea and air
[2:56:47.680 --> 2:56:54.800]  and cyber war with China, I would say or a space war with China, I mean, you keep poking
[2:56:54.800 --> 2:57:00.000]  the hornet's nest, you're going to get stung by these countries and the U.S. military is
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:04.800]  not nearly as advanced as it used to be relative to these other nations like China which has
[2:57:04.800 --> 2:57:07.600]  enormous economic might.
[2:57:07.600 --> 2:57:15.360]  Perhaps America should learn to negotiate and coexist, what an idea, huh?
[2:57:15.360 --> 2:57:20.640]  Midterms, midterm elections are coming and once again I think the U.S. can change course.
[2:57:20.640 --> 2:57:25.480]  Okay, all right, well, Alex, I want to thank you for your thoughts and for joining us today.
[2:57:25.480 --> 2:57:29.720]  It's Alex Christofarou at theduran.locals.com.
[2:57:29.720 --> 2:57:30.720]  I'm Mike Adams.

[2:57:35.520 --> 2:57:41.040]  Thank you for all your support of InfowarsStore.com and everybody pray for America because everything
[2:57:41.040 --> 2:57:42.040]  is at stake.
[2:57:42.040 --> 2:58:11.960]  Thanks you, take care.
[2:58:11.960 --> 2:58:38.040]  Let's meet.
[2:58:38.040 --> 2:58:42.440]  work. And you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance. So I want to thank you
[2:58:42.440 --> 2:58:46.720]  and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[2:58:46.720 --> 2:58:52.280]  I designed over 200 t-shirts the last 25 years. And we have some of those original designs
[2:58:52.280 --> 2:58:57.320]  still for sale at m4store.com. These are real classics. But ladies and gentlemen, they're
[2:58:57.320 --> 2:59:02.760]  all about to be limited edition because we're selling out of them. They're about to be history
[2:59:02.760 --> 2:59:06.880]  and we're selling out of the hoodies, the ball caps, the t-shirts, all these amazing
[2:59:06.880 --> 2:59:12.680]  designs at costm4store.com. Except for this fundraiser shirt that is a real hit and people

[3:00:03.400 --> 3:00:10.440]  Good afternoon, everybody. I'm Pete Santilli and I'm so honored to be hosting the fourth
[3:00:10.440 --> 3:00:17.880]  hour of the Alex Jones show on infowars.com, band.video. I welcome you. Well, there's a
[3:00:17.880 --> 3:00:24.360]  lot to talk about in a one-hour segment. Of course, the Pete Santilli show broadcasts
[3:00:24.360 --> 3:00:32.480]  for five hours a day, 8 a.m. Eastern and 6 p.m. Eastern at PeteLive.tv. We cover all
[3:00:32.480 --> 3:00:38.640]  these topics that, you know, as I put it, the amount of information that's coming, not
[3:00:38.640 --> 3:00:45.080]  just at us and independent media, Infowars Jones. I mean, it's just unimaginable. The
[3:00:45.080 --> 3:00:50.160]  amount of documentation that he has before him each and every day, it's almost physically
[3:00:50.160 --> 3:00:56.640]  impossible to get through it. As I always put it, it's like drinking from a fire hydrant,
[3:00:56.640 --> 3:01:02.120]  the amount of information we have. But, you know, what we try to do is to distill it down
[3:01:02.120 --> 3:01:09.720]  and to, you know, to break it down to the most obvious, but then again, of course, highlight
[3:01:09.720 --> 3:01:16.880]  the most absurd and obscene stuff that is coming at us. The theme of this hour is going
[3:01:16.880 --> 3:01:24.960]  to be three things. Three things, God, guns, and gas. And really, if you look at the offshoots
[3:01:24.960 --> 3:01:31.680]  to each one of those things, first and foremost, as it relates to God, we are in an epic, and
[3:01:31.680 --> 3:01:38.120]  I mean an epic battle between good and evil, a spiritual battle, and it can be applied to
[3:01:38.120 --> 3:01:42.760]  each one of those things that we're so concerned about. Gasoline, for instance. Everybody's
[3:01:42.760 --> 3:01:47.880]  concerned about gasoline right now because we have not just the escalation of the price
[3:01:47.880 --> 3:01:55.280]  of gas that is being blamed by the establishment, by this regime that is illegitimately seated
[3:01:55.280 --> 3:02:00.720]  on Vladimir Putin. It has nothing to do with Vladimir Putin. Joe Biden's first day in
[3:02:00.720 --> 3:02:05.760]  office was shutting down the Keystone Pipeline. He didn't blame that on Vladimir Putin. And
[3:02:05.760 --> 3:02:13.680]  all of his policies and actions since he has stolen the seat in the Oval Office had nothing
[3:02:13.680 --> 3:02:19.200]  to do with Vladimir Putin. And what's amazing is if you listen to them closely, the leftist
[3:02:19.200 --> 3:02:25.800]  brag about how some of them that drive like, what's her name, Stavenow from Michigan was
[3:02:25.800 --> 3:02:33.280]  bragging on C-SPAN that she drives an electric car and passed three or four gas stations
[3:02:33.280 --> 3:02:39.560]  and wasn't impacted in any way she had performed because she has an electric car. What do they
[3:02:39.560 --> 3:02:47.840]  say? Let them eat cake. Yes, of course. All of us can afford a $60,000 Prius and $25,000,
[3:02:47.840 --> 3:02:52.400]  $30,000 in maintenance a year. It's expensive. And by the way, they're doing an excellent
[3:02:52.400 --> 3:02:58.480]  job increasing, of course, the price of electricity. Where is that going to put us when we get
[3:02:58.480 --> 3:03:02.760]  our electric cars? Ladies and gentlemen, as it relates to gas, we'll dig into this a little
[3:03:02.760 --> 3:03:09.480]  bit further. We've got this short segment. And then on the other side, we'll talk about
[3:03:09.480 --> 3:03:15.520]  the price of gasoline is literally taxation without representation and an extraction
[3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:24.120]  of wealth. Can you imagine what little savings we have is being extracted every day now?
[3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:31.640]  The price of gasoline is escalating. And we're headed towards $10 per barrel. I'm sure California
[3:03:31.640 --> 3:03:37.640]  will hit that mark first. I'll never forget. I'm now in Ohio and Cincinnati, Ohio. But
[3:03:37.640 --> 3:03:46.320]  my last fill up of my SUV was $4 in something sense. And that was about six, seven years
[3:03:46.320 --> 3:03:51.040]  ago. So here we are back again, California leading the charge with the highest price
[3:03:51.040 --> 3:03:57.080]  of gasoline. They'll probably hit $10 a gallon. And I don't see it turning around. Why do
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:04:00.640]  I believe that? Because, ladies and gentlemen, they're bragging about how it's going to
[3:04:00.640 --> 3:04:09.320]  be so helpful to saving the climate, saving the planet. Of course, if everybody can abruptly
[3:04:09.320 --> 3:04:13.640]  shift from driving their vehicles and stop putting out carbon output. Now, ladies and
[3:04:13.640 --> 3:04:19.200]  gentlemen, this is not just an extraction of wealth, but it is a transfer of wealth.
[3:04:19.200 --> 3:04:28.360]  You see the oil tycoons that eat beef in Texas, they're drilling their down home Americans.
[3:04:28.360 --> 3:04:32.760]  They're typically on the ultra mogus side of the political spectrum. Well, the likes
[3:04:32.760 --> 3:04:39.000]  of people like Al Gore and others, they want to benefit from that wealth and solar panels
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:43.120]  and brand new industries that they're going to create from this abrupt shift. We will
[3:04:43.120 --> 3:04:50.040]  dig into this. This theme is God guns and gas on Pete Santilli hosting the fourth hour
[3:04:50.040 --> 3:05:01.520]  so proudly. Glad you're with us. Stay tuned. We'll be right back right after the short
[3:05:01.520 --> 3:05:02.520]  message.
[3:05:02.520 --> 3:05:03.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, high quality, storeable food is back in stock, ready to ship right
[3:05:03.520 --> 3:05:07.800]  now. We've not been selling food for three months because it was taking several weeks

[3:05:32.800 --> 3:05:36.640]  the collapse and wars, everything's happening is one of the most important as you can make
[3:05:36.640 --> 3:05:40.640]  is to have high quality, storeable food, water filtration, air filtration and more. And it's
[3:05:40.640 --> 3:05:44.640]  not just those items, it's hundreds of other high quality, preparedness items and survival

[3:05:54.360 --> 3:05:59.240]  get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning.
[3:05:59.240 --> 3:06:06.600]  And welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Pete Santilli, host of the Pete Santilli
[3:06:06.600 --> 3:06:14.480]  show and just to let you know, also a very proud longtime listener of the Alex Jones
[3:06:14.480 --> 3:06:20.440]  show for decades, actually. Alex Jones been in the background of my life as I came awake
[3:06:20.440 --> 3:06:27.720]  of my former Fox News brainwashing. Of course, after 9-11, I discovered, quote unquote, 9-11
[3:06:27.720 --> 3:06:33.200]  was an inside job. We'll get to that as well. We have to talk about the January 6 hearings
[3:06:33.200 --> 3:06:41.080]  and it's amazing how this Liz Cheney behind the scenes directly and indirectly profited
[3:06:41.080 --> 3:06:47.240]  from the Iraq war in 9-11, Dick Cheney, Halliburton, so on and so forth. We'll talk a little bit
[3:06:47.240 --> 3:06:54.400]  about that, but let's get to the theme of the day. God, really, really important, hopefully
[3:06:54.400 --> 3:07:01.600]  most important in everybody's priorities. Guns, guns are a hot topic. We have to talk
[3:07:01.600 --> 3:07:06.240]  about that and how they get us to this point to where everybody is just so traumatized
[3:07:06.240 --> 3:07:12.280]  that even regular sane people are going to be turning their guns in believing that by
[3:07:12.280 --> 3:07:19.040]  doing so, it's going to stop school shootings. We have some commentary on that and we typically
[3:07:19.040 --> 3:07:26.200]  do, but I'll be speaking to that. And then gasoline, back to gasoline. Ladies and gentlemen,
[3:07:26.200 --> 3:07:32.600]  Joe Biden's first order of business when he came in, he shut down the Keystone Pipeline.
[3:07:32.600 --> 3:07:38.960]  These are people that wanted to bring in the new green deal. I call it the new green steel,
[3:07:38.960 --> 3:07:45.920]  of course. But don't listen to the whole, well, because of the circumstances that they
[3:07:45.920 --> 3:07:50.560]  manufactured, by the way, all these crises that they say are directly affecting the price
[3:07:50.560 --> 3:07:57.320]  of petroleum and gasoline, they manufactured it. They manufactured it. So even by blaming
[3:07:57.320 --> 3:08:02.680]  Vladimir Putin for the war and the cause of the escalation of the price of oil, take
[3:08:02.680 --> 3:08:08.800]  a look at Joe Biden's poor relationship with the Saudis. They won't even return his call
[3:08:08.800 --> 3:08:16.920]  because they understand and recognize that he can't even put in his catheter without
[3:08:16.920 --> 3:08:21.960]  assistance from Joe Biden. But they won't return his calls. Obviously, Saudis' output
[3:08:21.960 --> 3:08:26.000]  production would impact the price of oil, and they have zero intention of doing it.
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:31.840]  Guess what? If you're going to blame Vladimir Putin in this war that they initiated, starting
[3:08:31.840 --> 3:08:38.280]  all the way back to the overthrow of Ukraine, and blame it on Vladimir Putin, well, why
[3:08:38.280 --> 3:08:46.880]  did you make Vladimir Putin, and I say you, this regime, Obama 2.0. Why did you put in
[3:08:46.880 --> 3:08:53.400]  Vladimir Putin in a position where he's actually going to become extremely wealthy because
[3:08:53.400 --> 3:09:00.920]  guess what? He's selling petroleum elsewhere and doing it outside of the petrodollar and
[3:09:00.920 --> 3:09:07.520]  making a lot of people extremely rich by causing the price of oil to skyrocket. It's going
[3:09:07.520 --> 3:09:14.960]  to go upwards of $150 per barrel, which is destructive to the economy. Is that the desired
[3:09:14.960 --> 3:09:21.920]  effect, the long-term desired effect? Likely so. I mean, I'm going to have to conspiracy
[3:09:21.920 --> 3:09:29.560]  theorize, but you hear these leftists bragging about how the price of oil and gasoline is
[3:09:29.560 --> 3:09:35.160]  causing people to drive less and having a positive impact, and also a positive impact
[3:09:35.160 --> 3:09:39.600]  in an attitude, because it's always about behavior modification, isn't it? Everything
[3:09:39.600 --> 3:09:45.720]  that they do is behavior modification. Even the trauma-based mind control by perpetrating
[3:09:45.720 --> 3:09:52.120]  false flags like 9-11, causing everybody to become so fearful that the boogeyman, CIA
[3:09:52.120 --> 3:09:59.720]  asset Osama bin Laden, is going to be attacking our buildings. That trauma-based mind control,
[3:09:59.720 --> 3:10:06.240]  of course, is how they change behavior. They need to get you to comply. They need to get
[3:10:06.240 --> 3:10:12.920]  you in a traumatic state, of course, and then accept, I'll never forget, the war when the
[3:10:12.920 --> 3:10:18.560]  war kicked off. Well, actually, I'm going to say when Joe Biden continued through his
[3:10:18.560 --> 3:10:23.880]  overthrow of the Ukraine, he was involved in all of that. It was the CIA overthrow,
[3:10:23.880 --> 3:10:30.160]  Victoria Nuland, Joe Biden was behind the scenes, Hillary Clinton. But when they kicked
[3:10:30.160 --> 3:10:37.680]  off the war in the Ukraine, everybody said, we will gladly pay a couple of extra dollars
[3:10:37.680 --> 3:10:43.240]  for gasoline to help the Ukrainians who are, I mean, these people are such knuckleheads
[3:10:43.240 --> 3:10:48.880]  at this point, saying that they're going to pay extra for gasoline so that they can arm
[3:10:48.880 --> 3:10:49.880]  the Ukrainians.
[3:10:49.880 --> 3:10:58.120]  That's where we're going to start talking about guns. We will, of course, recognize
[3:10:58.120 --> 3:11:04.000]  that these people don't even know who they're supporting when they're paying extra for gasoline
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:11.520]  to arm and pay for the war in the Ukraine. They're ultimately supporting Nazis, Azov
[3:11:11.520 --> 3:11:17.360]  Nazis that have been found out, that have been supportive of the regime, even Zelensky
[3:11:17.360 --> 3:11:19.760]  has helped promote.
[3:11:19.760 --> 3:11:26.280]  And here we are, with gasoline skyrocketing, headed towards $150 a barrel, $10 per gallon
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:31.360]  coming out of California. We're steaming towards that and it's all for the betterment
[3:11:31.360 --> 3:11:39.080]  of society. It will happen and you will like it, gasoline. Unbelievable that even the media
[3:11:39.080 --> 3:11:45.480]  standing in front of these big boards out in front of the gasoline station confused about
[3:11:45.480 --> 3:11:49.120]  how they're going to get to $10 per gallon because they don't have the extra digits on
[3:11:49.120 --> 3:11:50.200]  the sign.
[3:11:50.200 --> 3:11:54.680]  Even those on the front lines of the mainstream media, those mainstream media reporters are
[3:11:54.680 --> 3:12:03.480]  absolutely in shock at the price of gasoline. And of course, here we are, blaming Vladimir
[3:12:03.480 --> 3:12:10.080]  Putin, supporting the Ukrainians. Even the gay mafia has changed their rainbow flag to
[3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:14.920]  include the Ukrainian colors.
[3:12:14.920 --> 3:12:21.360]  By the way, one special note on that. This is how crazy these people are. The LGBTQ plus
[3:12:21.360 --> 3:12:32.880]  A79, 3905, 8675, 309ers, adding the colors of the Ukrainian flag to the gay mafia flag
[3:12:32.880 --> 3:12:40.280]  to help support the Ukraine effort. In Ukraine, they have banned gay marriage. Look how stupid
[3:12:40.280 --> 3:12:41.280]  that is.
[3:12:41.280 --> 3:12:47.160]  So we're paying extra for gas, we're changing our flags, we're helping the Nazis and these
[3:12:47.160 --> 3:12:56.640]  LGBTQ plus 8675, 309ers, just doing what they're absolutely told to do to help support the
[3:12:56.640 --> 3:12:57.640]  narrative.
[3:12:57.640 --> 3:13:06.680]  Gasling, can we sustain the price of a barrel of oil at $150? No, I'm going to tell you
[3:13:06.680 --> 3:13:13.920]  this right now. Economists will tell you and our economy is unraveling. The price of gas
[3:13:13.920 --> 3:13:19.920]  increasing in the fashion that it is and things happening so abruptly will collapse the economy
[3:13:19.920 --> 3:13:25.840]  because the economy, the global economy cannot sustain itself, especially when you consider
[3:13:25.840 --> 3:13:31.840]  the petrodollar, the amount of consumption, especially out of countries like China and
[3:13:31.840 --> 3:13:39.720]  India and all these other industrialized countries. That causes a shock to, it's an inflationary
[3:13:39.720 --> 3:13:45.440]  pressure that our economy can't take so abruptly. Now, can we transition? Well, I'm going to
[3:13:45.440 --> 3:13:49.920]  tell you, I've always been supportive of that. My dad worked for Ford Motor Company in Green
[3:13:49.920 --> 3:13:55.080]  Island, New York and they were polluting the Hudson River like crazy. They had to make
[3:13:55.080 --> 3:14:00.160]  certain changes. It takes time to make those adjustments. Of course, the EPA wants to come
[3:14:00.160 --> 3:14:07.320]  in and say, you will make the adjustment or we will shut you down and we will find you
[3:14:07.320 --> 3:14:11.200]  and you know what ended up happening? That's exactly what happened. The Green Island plant
[3:14:11.200 --> 3:14:15.920]  was the heater core factory for Ford Motor Company ended up shutting down because they
[3:14:15.920 --> 3:14:24.240]  couldn't withstand the abrupt pressure to cease on their pollution output and do so
[3:14:24.240 --> 3:14:29.280]  so quickly that they just packed up and they went to Mexico and then on to China. What did
[3:14:29.280 --> 3:14:35.000]  that do? Ultimately, that same exact manufacturing facility, what did they do end up polluting
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:41.920]  five times, ten times more? So the number of pollutants as a result of our efforts to
[3:14:41.920 --> 3:14:48.960]  shut down these companies from destroying the environment resulted in more pollution
[3:14:48.960 --> 3:14:53.520]  to begin with. But that's the leftist bureaucracy that comes in and they think that they know
[3:14:53.520 --> 3:15:00.920]  what's best that essentially they're going to make such an abrupt, volatile change that
[3:15:00.920 --> 3:15:08.480]  it's going to have the exact opposite desired effect economically, even socially. We now
[3:15:08.480 --> 3:15:14.360]  have a situation with these lockdowns, people are even going, I say psychologically it has
[3:15:14.360 --> 3:15:22.680]  an impact. Their economic policies are awful. They can't even manage a lemonade stand profitably
[3:15:22.680 --> 3:15:29.200]  for two weeks. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to mention something. I've got my Alex Jones
[3:15:29.200 --> 3:15:34.560]  was right t-shirts on the way. I got two of them. One, I'm going to put in a frame, likely
[3:15:34.560 --> 3:15:40.680]  put here in our studio. Go to infowarstore.com, support info wars however you can. And this
[3:15:40.680 --> 3:15:47.360]  is why I'm so honored and proud to be hosting the fourth hour in support of the mothership
[3:15:47.360 --> 3:15:53.200]  of the free flow of information infowars.com. We'll be right back right after this.
[3:15:53.200 --> 3:16:01.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, high quality, storeable food is back in stock, ready to ship right
[3:16:01.880 --> 3:16:06.360]  now. We've not been selling food for three months because it was taking several weeks
[3:16:06.360 --> 3:16:10.040]  for the food to get packaged and delivered to you. Most of their companies are completely
[3:16:10.040 --> 3:16:15.320]  out. But now they have a large spectrum of high quality food, ready to ship. Everything
[3:16:15.320 --> 3:16:22.320]  you find at preparewithalex.com or preparetoday.com is in stock, ready to ship. So go to preparewithalex.com
[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:26.960]  or preparetoday.com and order your high quality, storeable food right now, ready to ship to
[3:16:26.960 --> 3:16:31.360]  you and your family. With the inflation happening, with the food shortages, with the wars, with
[3:16:31.360 --> 3:16:35.200]  the collapse and wars, everything's happening. One of the most important things you can make
[3:16:35.200 --> 3:16:39.200]  is to have high quality, storeable food, water filtration, air filtration and more. And it's
[3:16:39.200 --> 3:16:43.200]  not just those items, it's hundreds of other high quality, preparedness items and survival
[3:16:43.200 --> 3:16:50.000]  items right now at preparewithalex.com that again redirects to preparetoday.com. I would
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:52.920]  not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen. One of the most important things you can do is
[3:16:52.920 --> 3:16:57.480]  get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning. I don't care if you work
[3:16:57.480 --> 3:17:02.040]  in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or
[3:17:02.040 --> 3:17:06.800]  a millionaire. Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every
[3:17:06.800 --> 3:17:11.400]  year. 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers. 50 different tax returns, 50 different
[3:17:11.400 --> 3:17:16.840]  answers. And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the
[3:17:16.840 --> 3:17:20.960]  big tax groups because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public
[3:17:20.960 --> 3:17:25.960]  understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important situation with inflation and
[3:17:25.960 --> 3:17:31.600]  all the things out there hurting everybody. To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal
[3:17:31.600 --> 3:17:35.200]  and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money. We wouldn't even be here if I
[3:17:35.200 --> 3:17:41.640]  hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years. The only way you fail is not writing
[3:17:41.640 --> 3:17:49.600]  down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com. One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-900-4285.
[3:17:49.600 --> 3:17:53.600]  833-904-285.
[3:17:53.600 --> 3:17:59.960]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially with
[3:17:59.960 --> 3:18:04.360]  word of mouth and prayer. All the success that we've had together against the globalists
[3:18:04.360 --> 3:18:08.960]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of
[3:18:08.960 --> 3:18:14.400]  you. Humanity has a real fighting chance. I just want to thank you all for buying products
[3:18:14.400 --> 3:18:18.600]  and InfoWars.com, like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration
[3:18:18.600 --> 3:18:22.080]  so much more. But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation so
[3:18:22.080 --> 3:18:26.520]  we get almost 100% of the money to fund our operation during this critical time, go to
[3:18:26.520 --> 3:18:32.840]  InfoWarsStore.com and right at the top you'll see a link to make a straight donation, a
[3:18:32.840 --> 3:18:38.920]  one-time donation of $5, $10, $50, or a recurring donation you can cancel anytime. I want to
[3:18:38.920 --> 3:18:42.160]  thank all of you that have donated. I want to encourage those of you out there that
[3:18:42.160 --> 3:18:46.560]  want to support Freedom to take action now and be part of the global awakening, the
[3:18:46.560 --> 3:18:51.920]  new renaissance that's countering the great reset by going to InfoWarsStore.com and clicking
[3:18:51.920 --> 3:18:55.400]  on the donate button and giving today. Thank you so much for your support. Please take
[3:18:55.400 --> 3:18:56.400]  action.
[3:18:56.400 --> 3:18:59.240]  You know, it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when
[3:18:59.240 --> 3:19:03.320]  the internet and mobile technology first came out, which is we thought, you know, this is
[3:19:03.320 --> 3:19:06.640]  going to level the playing field. Everybody's going to have access to the same information
[3:19:06.640 --> 3:19:10.280]  and everybody's going to be able to freely communicate that information. That's our
[3:19:10.280 --> 3:19:16.040]  goal to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information. We
[3:19:16.040 --> 3:19:21.080]  all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever
[3:19:21.080 --> 3:19:25.960]  we want, and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying
[3:19:25.960 --> 3:19:33.200]  to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations
[3:19:33.200 --> 3:19:38.160]  we're having, because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions,
[3:19:38.160 --> 3:19:42.680]  the people we want to talk to about these things. So that's our goal, is to help people
[3:19:42.680 --> 3:19:46.680]  take back their freedom by helping them to take back their privacy. And so that's really
[3:19:46.680 --> 3:19:53.600]  what we're trying to do. And so I hope that everybody listening will check us out at boltowireless.com.
[3:19:53.600 --> 3:19:58.200]  That's v-o-l-t-a-wireless.com.
[3:19:58.200 --> 3:20:08.200]  Reading of Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:08.200 --> 3:20:18.200]  And ladies and gentlemen, welcome back. I'm Pete Santilli, just in case you do not know.
[3:20:18.200 --> 3:20:25.280]  That's okay. A very proud contributor to the Alex Jones Show, hosting the fourth hour.
[3:20:25.280 --> 3:20:32.000]  I broadcast on my show, and you can find us at ThePeteSantilliShow.com, PeteLive.tv for
[3:20:32.000 --> 3:20:36.800]  our live streams. I broadcast five hours a day, essentially supplementing all the great
[3:20:36.800 --> 3:20:41.840]  work because it's physically impossible for the great team at m4s.com to get all this
[3:20:41.840 --> 3:20:47.520]  work done, to analyze this, provide commentary, allow people to also engage in the conversation.
[3:20:47.520 --> 3:20:54.520]  So I'm very proudly here in the fourth hour. And come give us a visit, of course, on Tude
[3:20:54.520 --> 3:20:58.800]  Social. I just set up on Tude Social. A lot of free-flowing information going on there.
[3:20:58.800 --> 3:21:05.440]  Anyway, so let's get back to this economic impact of gasoline. We've covered that. These
[3:21:05.440 --> 3:21:10.600]  people ultimately have been working for many decades. You hear the likes of the bartender,
[3:21:10.600 --> 3:21:18.800]  AOC, saying that she needed $9 trillion, of course, to affect change, to save the planet.
[3:21:18.800 --> 3:21:27.520]  It was going to be basically dying off. We're all going to die, of course, back in 2020.
[3:21:27.520 --> 3:21:33.320]  We far surpassed that. You know, the same methodology with this trauma-based mind control
[3:21:33.320 --> 3:21:38.880]  where they condition you to believe they're all going to die, everybody contribute. Don't
[3:21:38.880 --> 3:21:44.880]  worry about the cost of gasoline. We must go to the new Green Deal because you're going
[3:21:44.880 --> 3:21:51.360]  to die. They applied that same exact tactic Margaret Sanger did when she said we need
[3:21:51.360 --> 3:21:56.080]  to control the population, birth control. And of course, behind the scenes, her writing
[3:21:56.080 --> 3:22:03.360]  saying, I don't tell the blacks in the Irish that we want to basically kill them off because
[3:22:03.360 --> 3:22:07.640]  they're a drain on our society. But ultimately, Margaret Sanger, what was she doing? She
[3:22:07.640 --> 3:22:13.880]  was building what is now known as a multi-billion dollar Planned Parenthood business. Planned
[3:22:13.880 --> 3:22:18.760]  Parenthood is a multi-billion dollar business that cannot be interfered with. That's going
[3:22:18.760 --> 3:22:25.000]  to lead us to the next topic. Well, we're going to finish off with the topic of God, but we're
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:29.640]  going to talk about guns. But they have to traumatize us. They have to say that the new
[3:22:29.640 --> 3:22:36.400]  Green Deal, that you must accept it, accept the $10 per gallon, accept the transition
[3:22:36.400 --> 3:22:43.720]  from fossil fuels to electricity. But it's ultimately an extraction of wealth. Right
[3:22:43.720 --> 3:22:49.400]  now you are being taxed. What little savings you have is coming out of your wallet and
[3:22:49.400 --> 3:22:56.120]  it's going to them. Imagine the sprawl that exists that they've created over the lifetime
[3:22:56.120 --> 3:23:01.960]  of our nation. People live in the rural areas in the suburbs. A lot of them commute into
[3:23:01.960 --> 3:23:10.240]  the metro areas. They spend more money in gasoline. The offset is obviously the cost
[3:23:10.240 --> 3:23:14.200]  of living is a lot less outside of the metro areas.
[3:23:14.200 --> 3:23:19.640]  Well, any money that you've saved as a result of doing that, especially when gasoline was
[3:23:19.640 --> 3:23:27.560]  just when President Trump was in office under $2 per gallon. That allows you some discretionary
[3:23:27.560 --> 3:23:32.520]  income, some savings, plus you're able to spend more money and has a positive impact
[3:23:32.520 --> 3:23:38.320]  on the economy. They can't have that. They need to tax you without any representation
[3:23:38.320 --> 3:23:43.280]  and of course, extract your wealth from your savings, put it in their pocket and then quadruple
[3:23:43.280 --> 3:23:52.080]  down by shifting from this petrodollar and fossil fuel economy to their economy of solar
[3:23:52.080 --> 3:23:58.200]  panels, electric cars and so on and so forth. They want to be at the top of that food chain
[3:23:58.200 --> 3:24:03.960]  and take it away from the likes of people like T. Boone Pickens in Texas. I'm using
[3:24:03.960 --> 3:24:10.440]  his name as an example of those beef eating oil moguls.
[3:24:10.440 --> 3:24:15.440]  So do not be deceived. It's taxation without representation. This is not good for our economy.
[3:24:15.440 --> 3:24:22.680]  It will literally break it. This abrupt shift with the price of oil going to $150 will break
[3:24:22.680 --> 3:24:28.960]  our economy. Our economy cannot sustain it. It operates less than $100 per barrel. So
[3:24:28.960 --> 3:24:33.560]  this is going to have a reverberating impact worse than a nuclear war because at least
[3:24:33.560 --> 3:24:42.440]  a nuclear strike on a particular city in a limited capacity is only affecting a certain
[3:24:42.440 --> 3:24:47.920]  small area. This oil crisis is affecting the entire global economy.
[3:24:47.920 --> 3:24:54.360]  All right, now guns. Let's talk about guns. We have to talk about the Cyop that's being
[3:24:54.360 --> 3:25:03.840]  perpetrated here. Alex Jones, I was so happy to hear him say after he gave it some analysis
[3:25:03.840 --> 3:25:09.760]  and he said that some, not some, all of these anomalies that we've seen, all the questions
[3:25:09.760 --> 3:25:16.840]  that were posed as a result of the Uvalde shooting, that he does not accept the narrative.
[3:25:16.840 --> 3:25:21.200]  He said he was wrong. He's, of course, in an active shooter situation, he was giving
[3:25:21.200 --> 3:25:25.480]  credit to law enforcement because we're not anti law enforcement. As a matter of fact,
[3:25:25.480 --> 3:25:33.040]  that's probably the most disturbing thing about the Uvalde shooter is how many law enforcement
[3:25:33.040 --> 3:25:39.440]  officials do you know yourself that would listen to gunshots, children getting shot
[3:25:39.440 --> 3:25:44.160]  inside of a school and remain outside for 75 minutes?
[3:25:44.160 --> 3:25:48.600]  First of all, who gave that stand down order? Second of all, how many of those law enforcement
[3:25:48.600 --> 3:25:55.540]  officers were in on what we know to be false flag operations? All right, now, are shootings
[3:25:55.540 --> 3:26:02.160]  actually happening? Absolutely. Are they pre-programming shooters like the one in Buffalo? I call them
[3:26:02.160 --> 3:26:08.880]  the four chance shooter. Sure, they indoctrinated him, conditioned him, and of course radicalized
[3:26:08.880 --> 3:26:15.180]  him for a two year period. And a retired FBI agent was caught receiving information in
[3:26:15.180 --> 3:26:20.920]  advance of the shooting. Do they create these active shooters? Absolutely. What's the scenario
[3:26:20.920 --> 3:26:25.240]  behind that? Let's let the active shooter run around inside the building for 75 minutes.
[3:26:25.240 --> 3:26:31.480]  Somebody call a stand down order so we can maximize the carnage. Why? Why do they want
[3:26:31.480 --> 3:26:36.760]  to do that? Because ultimately, they need to get you into a traumatic state. Everyone
[3:26:36.760 --> 3:26:42.760]  is in a traumatic state. Oh my goodness, the thought of your child being shot at school
[3:26:42.760 --> 3:26:48.400]  is a horrifying thought. No doubt about it. You get into the traumatized state and then
[3:26:48.400 --> 3:26:58.560]  they say the way to stop the CIA, MK, ultra, pre-programmed active shooter going into schools
[3:26:58.560 --> 3:27:08.760]  to shoot the leftist gun grabbing Maoist narrative is to disarm the law abiding citizens. Whoa.
[3:27:08.760 --> 3:27:16.000]  Remember what I said about the Ukrainians? A month ago, leftists were protesting in the
[3:27:16.000 --> 3:27:22.400]  streets to go send guns to the Ukraine. Were they not? A week ago, they were protesting
[3:27:22.400 --> 3:27:30.560]  in the streets to kill children with abortion. And now they're protesting in the streets
[3:27:30.560 --> 3:27:37.480]  for gun control to save children. Is anybody confused? Or for those of you that tune in
[3:27:37.480 --> 3:27:44.000]  to at the Alex Jones show on enforce.com, band.video, you're wide awake to this stuff.
[3:27:44.000 --> 3:27:49.000]  You're a hardened info war veteran. You know what they're doing. You know what the script
[3:27:49.000 --> 3:27:54.920]  is? I talked about Margaret Sanger and how she had to traumatize everybody to make them
[3:27:54.920 --> 3:27:59.600]  think. Oh my goodness, we have to have birth control because of the population so far out
[3:27:59.600 --> 3:28:01.520]  of control, everyone's going to die soon.

[3:32:58.200 --> 3:33:04.040]  Hosting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[3:33:04.040 --> 3:33:16.840]  Welcome back everybody. I'm Pete Santilli. I'm hosting the Pete Santilli show but most
[3:33:16.840 --> 3:33:23.640]  proudly and most honored to be hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show. Listen,
[3:33:23.640 --> 3:33:27.520]  I want to overemphasize this thing. I'm taking a look at these deals and I understand how
[3:33:27.520 --> 3:33:33.920]  this works. I'm going to explain this to you. First of all, when you are asked to support
[3:33:33.920 --> 3:33:40.000]  independent media, you always step up to the plate. I exist. I would not exist if I didn't
[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:45.440]  call upon you and get everybody to respond. Our viewership has been very, very supportive.
[3:33:45.440 --> 3:33:51.560]  I've even support. I support Info Wars. We have no choice but to support Info Wars.
[3:33:51.560 --> 3:33:57.240]  What's beautiful about it is instead of making a direct monetary contribution, Alex is set
[3:33:57.240 --> 3:34:04.280]  up and monetized his business. He's got money in inventory. That is his currency. He offers
[3:34:04.280 --> 3:34:10.000]  great products so that you get something in return for helping support in the Info War.
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:16.280]  Right now, what he's essentially doing, these are the best deals, period. If you go there,
[3:34:16.280 --> 3:34:19.520]  these are the best deals of the year. I don't even think you're going to see some of these
[3:34:19.520 --> 3:34:24.760]  deals. Limited inventory, of course, on the shelf. This is how it works, folks. Imagine
[3:34:24.760 --> 3:34:31.480]  his currency, he buys inventory, he puts it on the shelf. It's kind of like a chip at
[3:34:31.480 --> 3:34:36.720]  a casino. It can be used at the casino, its currency, but you have to cash it in in order
[3:34:36.720 --> 3:34:41.760]  to be able to use it elsewhere. That's what's happening right now. This inventory, for instance,
[3:34:41.760 --> 3:34:48.040]  all teachers being sold at cost. You can go to InfoWarsStore.com, buy t-shirts. There's
[3:34:48.040 --> 3:34:54.680]  never been a more crucial time right now to allow Alex Jones to take his currency, the
[3:34:54.680 --> 3:35:00.520]  value of his inventory, buy up that inventory as quickly as you can before supplies run
[3:35:00.520 --> 3:35:08.280]  out, and we fuel the InfoWard. He cashes King right now to stay alive. So go to InfoWarsStore.com,
[3:35:08.280 --> 3:35:14.600]  take advantage of these best deals. Heron Beard supports 60% off. Immune supports 60%
[3:35:14.600 --> 3:35:21.240]  off. So this is part of the news. Part of the news is that if each and every individual
[3:35:21.240 --> 3:35:29.600]  helps fuel in this InfoWare, supportinginfowars.com, and keeping the truth alive, there's no matter
[3:35:29.600 --> 3:35:35.800]  what they try to do to us in independent media attacking us, and they certainly are, that
[3:35:35.800 --> 3:35:42.400]  we the people are the backstop to this thing. Help Save America, go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:35:42.400 --> 3:35:49.800]  So, the gun topic, and it's a big one, and now this is a big jumbled mess. I'm calling
[3:35:49.800 --> 3:35:56.440]  you, Valde, a very sophisticated operation, even if it's a psychological operation, being
[3:35:56.440 --> 3:36:02.520]  perpetrated because, listen, let me show you something. Who are the most dangerous people
[3:36:02.520 --> 3:36:10.120]  on the planet? And of course, one child being shot by an active shooter is horrifying, okay?
[3:36:10.120 --> 3:36:16.480]  That has to mass shootings, the dangers to the population, and getting 350 million people
[3:36:16.480 --> 3:36:22.880]  to surrender their guns, disarm all the law-abiding citizens who stand in defense of our country,
[3:36:22.880 --> 3:36:26.840]  because there's one of us behind every blade of grass, of course. That's what's kept
[3:36:26.840 --> 3:36:32.720]  our nation safe, and not one shot has been fired as a result of doing that. Who is more
[3:36:32.720 --> 3:36:39.760]  dangerous to our Constitutional Republic and society in general? Is it the active shooter,
[3:36:39.760 --> 3:36:45.320]  Valde? Let me show you an illustration here. Take a look at this graphic that I'm putting
[3:36:45.320 --> 3:36:50.640]  on the screen. The number of people killed by gun violence, Virginia Tech 33, Sandy Hook
[3:36:50.640 --> 3:36:55.080]  28. I shouldn't even be saying Sandy Hook because I know how they want to attach that
[3:36:55.080 --> 3:36:58.680]  and demonize everybody that mentions what happened in Sandy Hook.
[3:36:58.680 --> 3:37:09.320]  Uvalde 22, U of T 18, Parkland 17, Columbine 15, Santa Fe High 10. But look at how many
[3:37:09.320 --> 3:37:16.280]  people the Maoists have killed, and the Maoists are the ones that are perpetrating this psychological
[3:37:16.280 --> 3:37:23.080]  operation that I'm now calling Uvalde. It is a psychological operation. Yes, children
[3:37:23.080 --> 3:37:28.720]  died. Yes, it was horrifying that there was a stand down order. Yes, I'm very disappointed
[3:37:28.720 --> 3:37:34.080]  at those that were carrying badges and guns and getting respond instinctually. That is
[3:37:34.080 --> 3:37:39.400]  just the most perplexing thing to me. But ultimately, this operation being perpetrated
[3:37:39.400 --> 3:37:46.080]  upon the American public to make everybody and convince them, you have an unelected person
[3:37:46.080 --> 3:37:53.040]  standing at a government podium at the White House, Matthew McConaughey telling all law-abiding
[3:37:53.040 --> 3:37:58.480]  citizens that we need to do red flag laws are absolutely ridiculous.
[3:37:58.480 --> 3:38:02.200]  I say they're ridiculous. Number one, they're unconstitutional. I don't want the government
[3:38:02.200 --> 3:38:10.680]  determining the mental stability of any individual. I want a qualified medical professional to
[3:38:10.680 --> 3:38:16.200]  establish whether or not somebody is mentally incompetent. And you don't want to have the
[3:38:16.200 --> 3:38:21.520]  government or law enforcement to say, well, you're potentially mentally incompetent. So
[3:38:21.520 --> 3:38:27.160]  I'm going to take your guns away until you can get a diagnosis. Matthew McConaughey saying
[3:38:27.160 --> 3:38:34.120]  all the right things, of course, that yes, we need to consider the mental health of individuals
[3:38:34.120 --> 3:38:39.280]  that are shooting kids. Of course, we don't need new laws. There are laws against crazy
[3:38:39.280 --> 3:38:45.760]  people carrying guns. And of course, those crazy people are going to either shoot individuals
[3:38:45.760 --> 3:38:51.000]  in an elementary school, or they're going to drive a bulldozer into their classroom.
[3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:56.640]  Mentally ill people will use their weapon of choice. It is insane to say that we need
[3:38:56.640 --> 3:39:01.960]  new laws above and beyond what we already have right now. But we already have laws to protect
[3:39:01.960 --> 3:39:06.600]  us from the insane people. No, they don't run around with guns. We don't need anything
[3:39:06.600 --> 3:39:12.600]  new above and beyond that. Matthew McConaughey was not voted for by me. What the heck is
[3:39:12.600 --> 3:39:18.560]  he doing standing at the podium? Brainwashing the populace because we're all traumatized.
[3:39:18.560 --> 3:39:23.480]  You're in a traumatized state. You're thinking, oh my goodness, I will do anything and everything
[3:39:23.480 --> 3:39:29.120]  to protect the children and make sure that this doesn't happen again. And normal Americans
[3:39:29.120 --> 3:39:34.560]  in that traumatic state will listen to somebody who's literally made it a living his entire
[3:39:34.560 --> 3:39:42.000]  career promoting gun use in violent films in Hollywood. And now here he is using his
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:47.920]  acting skills and as part of the psychological operation with the White House emblem behind
[3:39:47.920 --> 3:39:54.280]  him to convince all law-abiding, sane, stable individuals who own guns that they must give
[3:39:54.280 --> 3:40:02.880]  them up. Ladies and gentlemen, these are Maoists. Mao took the guns. Hitler took the guns. Stalin
[3:40:02.880 --> 3:40:09.360]  took the guns. These are Maoists that wanna take the guns. They cannot install their Marxism,
[3:40:09.360 --> 3:40:13.320]  their communism in the United States of America with a well-armed populace. And that's what
[3:40:13.320 --> 3:40:19.920]  this is all about. Now we have gunmen, and here's the breaking news story that hit right
[3:40:19.920 --> 3:40:28.080]  before we came on air. This is a would-be assassin traveled, I think, from California
[3:40:28.080 --> 3:40:33.240]  all the way to Maryland. And this is just all blended in together. It's just like I
[3:40:33.240 --> 3:40:40.960]  said, it's like drinking out of a fire hydrant, intending to shoot and kill Brett Kavanaugh,
[3:40:40.960 --> 3:40:47.440]  his political opponent because of Roe v. Wade. Ladies and gentlemen, we now have potentially
[3:40:47.440 --> 3:40:52.960]  active shooters going after Supreme Court justices. Now remember, I spoke of Margaret
[3:40:52.960 --> 3:40:58.320]  Sanger. I spoke of her psychological operation to convince everybody through trauma-based
[3:40:58.320 --> 3:41:02.840]  mind control that the planet that we won't be able to sustain the population growth,
[3:41:02.840 --> 3:41:07.080]  we have to use birth control, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, get everybody scared, get
[3:41:07.080 --> 3:41:16.320]  them on birth control pills, stop the spread of the filthy virus called humanity through
[3:41:16.320 --> 3:41:22.940]  pro-creation, and of course, build a multi-billion-dollar Planned Parenthood that now, with late-term
[3:41:22.940 --> 3:41:24.880]  abortions, makes even more money.
[3:41:24.880 --> 3:41:29.600]  If you consider the circumference of the baby's head, this is a true story. They make more
[3:41:29.600 --> 3:41:33.760]  money. The reason why they want late-term abortions is they measure the circumference
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:40.080]  of the baby's head and that doubles the price. And thereby, the billions of dollars go up
[3:41:40.080 --> 3:41:45.000]  and up and up. There is a lobby going on with Planned Parenthood. It's a multi-billion-dollar
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:50.280]  industry. And of course, you need to consider the fact that ultimately, the people that
[3:41:50.280 --> 3:41:54.600]  are behind this effort are the likes of Margaret Sanger, who was a eugenicist. You wanted to
[3:41:54.600 --> 3:42:00.640]  get rid of not just people of color, but also the Irish. They were a drain on our society.
[3:42:00.640 --> 3:42:05.760]  What do we do? We kill them off. We got Bill Gates, also a eugenicist. He wants to kill
[3:42:05.760 --> 3:42:11.440]  off all the dumb people and all the old dumb people, of course, and dedicate those funds
[3:42:11.440 --> 3:42:17.280]  to education. These are eugenicists. They'll perpetrate psychological operations. They
[3:42:17.280 --> 3:42:25.240]  cannot have a well-armed populace that remains defensive, of course, with the ownership of
[3:42:25.240 --> 3:42:31.800]  firearms, whatever firearms you need to defend our nation. Even if you want a tank, shoot,
[3:42:31.800 --> 3:42:36.000]  let's start issuing nukes. I'm just kidding. We don't want to do that. But our political
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:40.480]  adversary will stop at nothing. I believe that there needs to be an equal and opposite
[3:42:40.480 --> 3:42:46.400]  force. It is peace through strength. And the strength of our country is a well-armed
[3:42:46.400 --> 3:42:51.400]  populace. Ladies and gentlemen, on Pete Santelli, I'll be back with you right on the other
[3:42:51.400 --> 3:42:58.880]  side of this break. We're going to talk about the God side of this equation right after
[3:42:58.880 --> 3:43:24.880]  the end of this video.
[3:43:24.880 --> 3:43:54.760]  Thank you.
[3:43:55.880 --> 3:44:03.200]  Our world is so full of hype. We are force-fed, dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media,
[3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:09.400]  by the controlled churches and the universities. Why is this the case? Because we innately,
[3:44:09.400 --> 3:44:14.840]  by God, have been given the keys for our own minds, our own psyches, our own souls. And
[3:44:14.840 --> 3:44:21.560]  by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote, fallen or sinful state.
[3:44:21.560 --> 3:44:27.040]  So the chemicals that we ingest, and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to
[3:44:27.040 --> 3:44:32.160]  change who we are, are only lowering us. They're only making us more depressed. From the end,
[3:44:32.160 --> 3:44:36.880]  they're only making us less filled. It is only by going within and really making that
[3:44:36.880 --> 3:44:41.360]  connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves. That's why the globalist, bombardist,
[3:44:41.360 --> 3:44:46.160]  and toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals and trace
[3:44:46.160 --> 3:44:51.800]  elements, our boss need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the
[3:44:51.800 --> 3:44:56.320]  third dimension. And that's where the incredible products come in at M4store.com.

[3:46:58.200 --> 3:47:11.280]  Using a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:11.280 --> 3:47:16.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Listen, I've been talking about these are Maoists
[3:47:16.000 --> 3:47:21.320]  that are coming after us. There's never been a more crucial time right now. We take a stand
[3:47:21.320 --> 3:47:27.840]  in this fight. Alex Jones over decades has built an infrastructure in this info war.
[3:47:27.840 --> 3:47:34.120]  Great staff, great facility, great technology, great knowledge on the Internet, and part
[3:47:34.120 --> 3:47:39.520]  of that infrastructure is guess who? You. This is where we, the people rally against
[3:47:39.520 --> 3:47:43.960]  these Maoists. This thing that's happening in the United States of America, these gun
[3:47:43.960 --> 3:47:49.840]  grabbers, okay? They're part of an insurgency. We're now going to be part of the counterinsurgency
[3:47:49.840 --> 3:47:54.960]  and the counteroffensive. How do we do it? We got global censorship. We've got attacks
[3:47:54.960 --> 3:48:01.280]  upon Alex Jones at an all time high in an effort to shut down who? To shut down you,
[3:48:01.280 --> 3:48:06.760]  to shut down the second amendment. To have you tuned into MSNBC and Joe Scarborough saying
[3:48:06.760 --> 3:48:11.600]  we need to have all law abiding citizens turn in their guns to save the children. That's
[3:48:11.600 --> 3:48:16.960]  why your support right now, this is where everybody steps up. You go to infowars.com.
[3:48:16.960 --> 3:48:24.120]  You purchase products to 360 when you get super high quality items and you help launch

[3:48:44.840 --> 3:48:51.640]  you get great value. Go to infowars.com. All right. Now, this is the epic battle, ladies
[3:48:51.640 --> 3:48:55.320]  and gentlemen, you know deep into your soul. If you're listening to me right now, and by
[3:48:55.320 --> 3:49:00.600]  the way, I'm condensing everything that I'm talking about right now into a one hour segment,
[3:49:00.600 --> 3:49:06.120]  the fourth hour to help supplement of course, in the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show
[3:49:06.120 --> 3:49:12.480]  on band.video and infowars.com to condense this thing that we have in our souls. We
[3:49:12.480 --> 3:49:16.920]  know what's happening. We're not going to complain and say, oh, the mainstream media
[3:49:16.920 --> 3:49:23.560]  is, they're telling lies. Of course they are. They're a part of the psychological operation.
[3:49:23.560 --> 3:49:28.920]  You can't say and start thinking that the psy-oppers are all of a sudden going to start
[3:49:28.920 --> 3:49:35.080]  changing their ways. They're part of it. They're CIA, mockingbird media. Go read the communist
[3:49:35.080 --> 3:49:44.680]  manifesto that was read into the congressional record in 1963, 64, I think it was. That entire
[3:49:44.680 --> 3:49:51.880]  record from Cleon Scalson's naked communist outlined exactly what they were going to do.
[3:49:51.880 --> 3:49:58.840]  This is back in the 60s. They read it into the congressional record. They're implementing
[3:49:58.840 --> 3:50:04.680]  this plan step by step by step, including the nuclear war aspects of it getting us to
[3:50:04.680 --> 3:50:11.360]  disarm on the global scale to push us to the precipice of World War III with the threat
[3:50:11.360 --> 3:50:16.600]  of nukes is an effort by these communists to not just disarm the populace so that they
[3:50:16.600 --> 3:50:23.800]  can overpower the individual Second Amendment enthusiast, one behind every blade of grass,
[3:50:23.800 --> 3:50:29.560]  but they want to disarm America from our nuclear weapons. This thing with Vladimir Putin and
[3:50:29.560 --> 3:50:38.120]  this manufactured crisis of being on the precipice of World War III, whether or not Joe Biden
[3:50:38.120 --> 3:50:44.280]  and Vladimir Putin are knowledgeable or winning. They're still participants in this effort
[3:50:44.280 --> 3:50:50.200]  to dearm the United States of America from nuclear weapons. How do I know this? Because
[3:50:50.200 --> 3:50:57.240]  they set out to do it and published it in the record. The communist manifesto entered
[3:50:57.240 --> 3:51:04.960]  into the public record in the 60s. We're actually living the final phases of that implementation
[3:51:04.960 --> 3:51:12.320]  plan. This is the epic battle. Who are these people? Obviously, this entity, like who is
[3:51:12.320 --> 3:51:20.520]  Satan? Is he a guy that is red with horns and a pitchfork sitting on a satanic throne?
[3:51:20.520 --> 3:51:29.680]  Or is it something much bigger than that? It is an evil spirit that exists that permeates
[3:51:29.680 --> 3:51:36.360]  all of those willing souls and godless souls. And you get a whole bunch of people doing
[3:51:36.360 --> 3:51:44.880]  evil and Satan himself as a spirit entering into the godless souls of these people that
[3:51:44.880 --> 3:51:51.760]  are participating in sex trafficking, that are participating in gun running and gun grabbing
[3:51:51.760 --> 3:52:02.120]  and human trafficking and ritualistic sacrifice. This is the ultimate spiritual battle. Yes,
[3:52:02.120 --> 3:52:10.320]  of course, the serpent himself deceiving mankind, dating all the way back to the Garden of Eden.
[3:52:10.320 --> 3:52:18.760]  This is the epic time right now. When I say end time, if you see how fast the information
[3:52:18.760 --> 3:52:24.200]  is coming at us, the deception, they flat out lie to us. Stop saying, oh my goodness,
[3:52:24.200 --> 3:52:27.960]  the mainstream media, they're not covering this. No, they're not designed to do that.
[3:52:27.960 --> 3:52:31.440]  They're designed to lie to you. That's why we're sitting in independent media trying
[3:52:31.440 --> 3:52:40.840]  to deliver the truth. This effort here with Roe v. Wade and this ruling is coming down
[3:52:40.840 --> 3:52:46.120]  pretty quickly. I was actually looking at the live chat feed we're expecting that this
[3:52:46.120 --> 3:52:50.800]  final ruling, I'll actually be shocked if they actually do what's right. I will literally
[3:52:50.800 --> 3:52:59.120]  be shocked if they say to states rights issue. The federal government has no, we have no
[3:52:59.120 --> 3:53:06.320]  means to centrally control its unconstitutional Roe v. Wade. Although these leftists say that
[3:53:06.320 --> 3:53:13.160]  they have a God given right to kill babies. It's insanity. It's been a God given right
[3:53:13.160 --> 3:53:21.360]  for 50 years. The Supreme Court may shockingly side with the US Constitution and say that
[3:53:21.360 --> 3:53:30.120]  it was unconstitutional right from its inception. And yes, we've got, of course, these Utah
[3:53:30.120 --> 3:53:36.680]  County people, this is a horrifying story that we don't have enough time to cover.
[3:53:36.680 --> 3:53:44.600]  These are child sacrifice satanists that are also behind the effort to kill babies in the
[3:53:44.600 --> 3:53:51.240]  tens of millions, a large portion of whom are, guess what, black babies, black American
[3:53:51.240 --> 3:53:56.840]  babies, 20 million black babies haven't been killed over that period of time that they
[3:53:56.840 --> 3:54:02.000]  say that they have a God given right. These Planned Parenthoods strategically located
[3:54:02.000 --> 3:54:07.600]  in the inner city where Margaret Sanger said that those people who are on the drugs that
[3:54:07.600 --> 3:54:11.440]  the CIA is shipping to are a drain in our society.
[3:54:11.440 --> 3:54:15.840]  They have terrible schools in the inner city. They don't have jobs. They've got lots of
[3:54:15.840 --> 3:54:22.420]  drugs. They're picking from the litter the most pretty subjects to enter into their
[3:54:22.420 --> 3:54:31.320]  child sex trafficking operations. And those that are left behind promiscuity and demoralization,
[3:54:31.320 --> 3:54:41.120]  including child pregnancy and minimizing childbirth is the way to do it. And of course, profit
[3:54:41.120 --> 3:54:48.000]  off of it through Planned Parenthood. These are satanic people, just absolutely horrifying
[3:54:48.000 --> 3:54:54.560]  to me. It is horrifying to you. We must push past this thing, recognize it for what it
[3:54:54.560 --> 3:55:00.520]  is. This is the epic battle between good and able. We are on the side of good, ladies and
[3:55:00.520 --> 3:55:07.880]  gentlemen. We are godly souls. We are godly patriots. Let's stop criticizing. It's like
[3:55:07.880 --> 3:55:14.280]  saying, Satan is lying constantly. He needs to change his ways. Fox News is not promoting
[3:55:14.280 --> 3:55:20.800]  2000. Of course they're not. Satan is not going to do the work that we would expect him to
[3:55:20.800 --> 3:55:25.640]  do. Guess where it's happening? It's happening right here. It's happening on the Alex Jones
[3:55:25.640 --> 3:55:29.520]  show. It's happening in independent media. It's happening on the Pete Santilli show.
[3:55:29.520 --> 3:55:35.480]  Now the Pete Santilli show is not the center of the universe. It actually started in 2011
[3:55:35.480 --> 3:55:42.040]  when Alex Jones says, I can't do this by myself. Independent media that exists around
[3:55:42.040 --> 3:55:49.000]  Info Wars and out the Alex Jones show that has sprouted up over the past several years
[3:55:49.000 --> 3:55:55.320]  has been to supplement this thing. This is we the people building independent media,
[3:55:55.320 --> 3:56:00.480]  sharing the truth. And you know what? Now let's just absolutely opt out of what they've
[3:56:00.480 --> 3:56:05.080]  got going on. We will deliver the truth. Do so securely. Of course, we're building an
[3:56:05.080 --> 3:56:13.280]  entire separate infrastructure on the Internet. We know what the Uvalde shooting was all about.
[3:56:13.280 --> 3:56:19.640]  We understand the scripting in these operations, psychological operation folks. It is. Everybody
[3:56:19.640 --> 3:56:28.800]  knows this. It's in an effort to do this, to do what the Maoist did. In China, 65 million
[3:56:28.800 --> 3:56:33.440]  people died. Russia, 25 million. Cambodia, 2 million on the right side of this column
[3:56:33.440 --> 3:56:39.480]  here. North Korea, 2 million. The people that are behind this effort in this psychological
[3:56:39.480 --> 3:56:46.720]  operation to disarm law abiding citizens are getting ready to kill. Go listen to Larry
[3:56:46.720 --> 3:56:52.720]  Grathwall, who infiltrated the weather underground. By the way, that's another breaking story.
[3:56:52.720 --> 3:56:59.640]  Congratulations to those that removed that Satanic leftist Maoist George Soros supported
[3:56:59.640 --> 3:57:08.040]  DA Chesa Boudin in San Francisco. 64% of the voters voted to have that leftist removed.
[3:57:08.040 --> 3:57:13.600]  Let's go, folks. The system of electronic voting machines is broken. Let's go into this next
[3:57:13.600 --> 3:57:18.240]  election. Knowing full well they're going to cheat, let's smash the algorithm by getting

[3:58:22.600 --> 3:58:26.520]  happening is one of the most important things you can make is to have high quality, storeable
