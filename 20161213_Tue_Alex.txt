[00:00.000 --> 00:24.200]  37 from the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:24.200 --> 00:30.200]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:30.200 --> 00:33.200]  technocracy tank-over.
[00:33.200 --> 00:42.200]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:42.200 --> 00:47.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, if there's a bell-weather, if there's a gauge that you can stick a fork
[00:47.080 --> 00:57.840]  in the anti-American globalist system, it's Kanye West going to Trump Tower this morning
[00:57.840 --> 01:02.360]  and basically endorsing and embracing Donald Trump.
[01:02.360 --> 01:06.860]  You can't get more pop, you can't get more shallow.
[01:06.860 --> 01:11.360]  That signifies that they understand that basically the entire country is turning against
[01:11.360 --> 01:12.840]  the globalist.
[01:12.840 --> 01:18.520]  Hillary would get 300 people on average, Trump 20,000 on average, with tens of thousands
[01:18.520 --> 01:25.960]  turned back because of the bottlenecks via security, which had to be done.
[01:25.960 --> 01:33.520]  So this just shows you how much the power structure is completely and totally panicking.
[01:33.520 --> 01:38.640]  And that's why we're witnessing the Central Intelligence Agency completely rogue, rogue
[01:38.640 --> 01:45.560]  elements of it, and I have the proof coming up in the next segment, saying that they want
[01:45.560 --> 01:56.040]  to contact and meet with all of the electors and have them forfeit their votes that they
[01:56.040 --> 02:01.800]  represent that they've pledged for voters and thus give them to Hillary, and the word
[02:01.800 --> 02:08.680]  is maybe just seat her as the 40th president or have a new election.
[02:08.680 --> 02:14.160]  That of course will plunge the country into a civil emergency, a national emergency, probably
[02:14.160 --> 02:16.160]  a civil war.
[02:16.160 --> 02:22.480]  But I was sitting back this morning watching the narrative of this rogue secret group and
[02:22.480 --> 02:28.600]  the secret report from the CIA unravel very, very quickly, and I was thinking about how
[02:28.600 --> 02:35.360]  many facets there were to this, so I'm going to come back after the break and try to line
[02:35.360 --> 02:37.680]  it all up unlike anybody else has done.
[02:37.680 --> 02:43.280]  Everybody's doing a piece here, a piece there, and quite frankly, looking at what folks are
[02:43.280 --> 02:49.800]  saying and reporting and documenting the hypocrisy, there were a lot of points I didn't think
[02:49.800 --> 02:50.800]  of.
[02:50.800 --> 02:56.640]  Like when they were accusing Trump of winning the election via foreign influence, I mentioned
[02:56.640 --> 03:01.560]  the communist Chinese openly giving illegal contributions publicly and openly saying we
[03:01.560 --> 03:05.920]  couldn't have Trump and the Saudi Arabians almost matching the hundreds of millions
[03:05.920 --> 03:11.240]  the communist Chinese gave and the Pope waiting in and telling Catholics to vote against Trump
[03:11.240 --> 03:15.160]  and all these other foreign governments in the EU.
[03:15.160 --> 03:23.680]  But I missed, until I saw comments last night on infowars.com, the most important point.
[03:23.680 --> 03:27.400]  Thousands of illegals in this country with the Democrats in at least seven states, fourteen
[03:27.400 --> 03:32.320]  states of past laws where there's no ID, but seven states telling illegals to go vote.
[03:32.320 --> 03:36.120]  We can show you the article, show you the news clip, show you the pundits saying it
[03:36.120 --> 03:40.400]  on the news, but then they say it doesn't exist.
[03:40.400 --> 03:47.840]  As racist if you want IDs, talk about foreign influence, bringing foreigners in to vote.
[03:47.840 --> 03:52.560]  Imagine if there were 20 million, 30 million Russians here and the Republicans were saying
[03:52.560 --> 03:56.400]  vote for Trump, it'd be the end of the world and it should be.
[03:56.400 --> 04:02.520]  But if it's Nicaraguan, Venezuelans, Mexicans, Chinese, you name it, then it's okay.
[04:02.520 --> 04:07.240]  And a lot of Eastern Europeans vote liberal as well, a lot of illegal folks from Ukraine,
[04:07.240 --> 04:13.680]  from Poland that are here in the US and they massively vote Democrat, even though their
[04:13.680 --> 04:17.240]  parents fled the Soviet Union.
[04:17.240 --> 04:20.400]  But I've looked at the demographics, so you talk about foreign meddling, but it turns
[04:20.400 --> 04:24.520]  out this particular CIA story, as I told you over the weekend, is totally false.
[04:24.520 --> 04:27.000]  Now it's unraveled completely.
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.600]  And after the break, we're going to break it down.
[04:28.600 --> 04:32.760]  I'm going to recap what I just said and get to all the new information straight ahead
[04:32.760 --> 04:33.760]  on the other side.
[04:33.760 --> 04:35.320]  I'm Alex Jones.
[04:35.320 --> 04:36.320]  This is the Info War.
[04:36.320 --> 04:40.600]  They're doing everything they can with Google filters and Apple filters and Reddit filters
[04:40.600 --> 04:43.080]  and others at censorinfowars.com.
[04:43.080 --> 04:44.080]  Let's beat them.
[04:44.080 --> 04:47.560]  Help spread that link to the forewinds, jam it down their throat.
[04:47.560 --> 04:48.640]  This is a war.
[04:48.640 --> 04:49.960]  It's an Info War.
[04:49.960 --> 04:50.960]  Hit them.
[04:50.960 --> 04:51.960]  Hit them hard.
[04:51.960 --> 04:52.960]  And never let up.
[04:52.960 --> 04:57.840]  Let's stomp them into the ground.
[04:57.840 --> 05:01.920]  Why is the CIA pushing this ridiculous conspiracy theory?
[05:01.920 --> 05:05.560]  Reports of Russian officials intervening in the American presidential election have been
[05:05.560 --> 05:07.800]  industriously circulated for months.
[05:07.800 --> 05:12.520]  The FBI, DHS and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence are all looking at
[05:12.520 --> 05:16.840]  the same allegations and all of the agencies came up with the same foregone conclusion.
[05:16.840 --> 05:21.160]  Vladimir Putin's government deliberately interfered with America's presidential election.
[05:21.160 --> 05:25.720]  The laughable insinuation was reiterated this morning in an article published in The Hill,
[05:25.720 --> 05:29.720]  attacking President-elect Donald Trump for casting doubt on their assessment, concluding
[05:29.720 --> 05:32.840]  that Russia intervened in the election to help him win the White House.
[05:32.840 --> 05:36.760]  Trump tweeted out, can you imagine if the election results were opposite and we tried
[05:36.760 --> 05:38.840]  to play the Russia CIA card?
[05:38.840 --> 05:43.240]  Keep in mind this is the same CIA that asserted false claims against Saddam Hussein and led
[05:43.240 --> 05:47.520]  us into the invasion of Iraq with a track record like that, one must take their assessments
[05:47.520 --> 05:51.760]  with a serious grain of salt and question the motivation of these agencies.
[05:51.760 --> 06:20.760]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for infowars.com.
[06:20.760 --> 06:25.760]  Oh yeah.
[06:25.760 --> 06:27.760]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[06:27.760 --> 06:28.760]  It's time to ride, boss.
[06:28.760 --> 06:29.760]  We need a thousand paul reveres.
[06:29.760 --> 06:36.760]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[06:36.760 --> 06:43.280]  And beef was for supper, revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings
[06:43.280 --> 06:49.160]  on demand, DVDs now available, starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, special ops general
[06:49.160 --> 06:54.600]  Terry Boykin, want to shed some tears over the red, white, and blue, revelation, the
[06:54.600 --> 06:55.600]  movie.info.
[06:55.600 --> 06:56.600]  Let's fix it.
[06:56.600 --> 07:01.800]  More than two years ago, infowars first told you about our research into what has been
[07:01.800 --> 07:06.360]  called the iodine conspiracy and told you about how scientists have known for decades
[07:06.360 --> 07:11.280]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government, knowingly, started
[07:11.280 --> 07:16.160]  taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into
[07:16.160 --> 07:17.160]  the water.
[07:17.160 --> 07:20.600]  Look, the good halogen, and put the deadly halogen in.
[07:20.600 --> 07:25.160]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[07:25.160 --> 07:27.560]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[07:27.560 --> 07:33.040]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[07:33.040 --> 07:38.840]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[07:38.840 --> 07:40.440]  ever concerning iodine.
[07:40.440 --> 07:42.400]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[07:42.400 --> 07:46.640]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[07:46.640 --> 07:48.680]  any optimum health regimen.
[07:48.680 --> 08:17.640]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today at infowarslife.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[08:17.640 --> 08:46.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, the 13th day of December 2016.
[08:46.600 --> 08:51.680]  I'm your host Alex Jones, I'll be hosting today, Paul Watson will be co-hosting coming
[08:51.680 --> 08:55.520]  up at the bottom of the next hour, and then of course we have Leigh Ann McAdoo, hosting
[08:55.520 --> 08:57.640]  the fourth hour with Owen Schreuer.
[08:57.640 --> 08:59.400]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[08:59.400 --> 09:05.280]  Roger Stone pops into the start of the next hour with big breaking news and analysis as
[09:05.280 --> 09:11.640]  he just left Trump Tower last night and flew back to Florida.
[09:11.640 --> 09:20.800]  Now where to start as I always say, ah man, I have really studied US history, I've studied
[09:20.800 --> 09:23.400]  world history, it's so interesting.
[09:23.400 --> 09:34.000]  I have never seen more open, brazen, naked attempts by intelligence agencies and a party
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.360]  that has been voted out of office.
[09:36.360 --> 09:42.320]  I've never seen such brazen attempts at a soft coup.
[09:42.320 --> 09:47.760]  I've seen militaries take over presidential palaces or overthrow governments, coups or
[09:47.760 --> 09:52.320]  something that happens basically on a monthly basis around the world.
[09:52.320 --> 10:00.360]  But to see this modern 21st century attempt at a media coup by a president who only has
[10:00.360 --> 10:07.520]  37 days left in office and rogue elements of a discredited, bloated intelligence agency
[10:07.520 --> 10:12.520]  is simply incredible.
[10:12.520 --> 10:18.280]  Now the good news is they started pushing this whole Russia's controlling the narrative,
[10:18.280 --> 10:26.600]  Russia's controlling the election a year ago and no one ever bought it and it's been discredited
[10:26.600 --> 10:31.560]  along the line and we have conflicting statements from Clapper, the head of the CIA and others
[10:31.560 --> 10:37.320]  that we're going to go over here in a moment.
[10:37.320 --> 10:40.360]  But here's the basic boil down.
[10:40.360 --> 10:48.440]  It's the communist Chinese that gave over $300 million to super PACs and the Clinton campaign
[10:48.440 --> 10:54.680]  and it was all completely illegal but they did it through US subsidiaries, show the controlled
[10:54.680 --> 10:58.280]  justice department stood down and allowed it to take place.
[10:58.280 --> 11:09.720]  The corruption is just naked out in the open, brazen, unapologetic.
[11:09.720 --> 11:15.320]  Saudi Arabia has almost matched the amount of illegal contributions.
[11:15.320 --> 11:16.320]  You can just search engines.
[11:16.320 --> 11:22.080]  Saudi Arabia has made massive contributions to the Democrats and to Hillary, meddling
[11:22.080 --> 11:26.640]  in our internal affairs.
[11:26.640 --> 11:33.200]  Then we have the millions of illegals in this country, but the Democrats catering to them
[11:33.200 --> 11:37.520]  to vote illegally.
[11:37.520 --> 11:41.440]  Zero hedge breaks down the numbers where Saudi Arabia has funded 20% of Hillary Clinton's
[11:41.440 --> 11:49.360]  presidential campaign, Saudi crown prince claims publicly, you have to understand.
[11:49.360 --> 11:56.040]  China brags that they're funding both political parties, but particularly the Democrats.
[11:56.040 --> 12:01.000]  Communist China lectures us in our newspapers that we better quote, control your new independent
[12:01.000 --> 12:02.000]  media.
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.500]  You better shut down the alt-right.
[12:03.500 --> 12:05.840]  That was two weeks ago in the Wall Street Journal.
[12:05.840 --> 12:10.280]  The Chinese president lectures the American people.
[12:10.280 --> 12:14.800]  The Chinese president brags that they're controlling our elections.
[12:14.800 --> 12:20.360]  The pope tells Catholics to vote against Trump and says it's a sin to support him and says
[12:20.360 --> 12:25.640]  shut down the alternative media or it's like having sexual pleasure out of eating feces.
[12:25.640 --> 12:28.800]  You cannot make this up if you're a new listener and just tuned in.
[12:28.800 --> 12:33.760]  I'm telling you, I'm quoting word for word, but they say truth is stranger than fiction.
[12:33.760 --> 12:37.640]  China admits, even the Washington Post admits, even Hollywood reporter admits, has already
[12:37.640 --> 12:43.240]  bought up most of Hollywood and now is about to get controlling shares in all six production
[12:43.240 --> 12:46.920]  houses.
[12:46.920 --> 12:49.960]  Globalism is wide open world corporate government.
[12:49.960 --> 12:59.880]  The EU last Monday gave US tech giants 24 hours to start censoring a giant list of what they
[12:59.880 --> 13:03.800]  called fake news, info wars and drudger on the list and guess what?
[13:03.800 --> 13:09.360]  Now it's hard to share links on Facebook and Reddit, you name it, of infowars.com.
[13:09.360 --> 13:14.720]  It's happening and they write mainstream news articles saying Alex Jones is fake news.
[13:14.720 --> 13:20.400]  He says he's being censored as Google Chrome blocks us and calls us fake news.
[13:20.400 --> 13:26.320]  As Reddit shadow bans us as the same thing happens with Breitbart and they get their
[13:26.320 --> 13:34.880]  apps that they've had for years kicked off and they respond and say nothing's happening.
[13:34.880 --> 13:37.320]  This is incredible.
[13:37.320 --> 13:43.160]  Hillary names us by name and says she wants the alt-right shutdown once she gets elected.
[13:43.160 --> 13:49.440]  She loses even though she tried to steal it and now they're still moving forward and even
[13:49.440 --> 13:52.480]  saying ban Donald Trump from Twitter.
[13:52.480 --> 13:57.040]  The Washington Post didn't just say that a week ago, yesterday they called for seizing
[13:57.040 --> 14:03.480]  Trump Tower saying they shouldn't have to pay for the security.
[14:03.480 --> 14:09.320]  They're at all-out war with the American people and the CIA, here's the coup de gras.
[14:09.320 --> 14:15.600]  The CIA totally discredited its job as overthrowing countries, its job as lying doing dirty tricks
[14:15.600 --> 14:26.520]  under orders from Obama and the whole Soros Combine comes out and says yesterday led by
[14:26.520 --> 14:28.240]  Nancy Pelosi's daughter.
[14:28.240 --> 14:34.680]  This is in the San Francisco Chronicle, the New York Post, you name it.
[14:34.680 --> 14:43.640]  They come out and they openly say that they've lined up a whole bunch of electors.
[14:43.640 --> 14:50.200]  It was two a week ago, Pelosi has 10 alone and reportedly they're going to try to get
[14:50.200 --> 14:56.240]  more than 50 and try to reverse it and we won't know until January 6th because they
[14:56.240 --> 15:02.600]  send their votes in on the 19th, they've got to be there by the 6th, they then get counted
[15:02.600 --> 15:06.520]  and then the numbers get released and I guess if there's a battle, it'll be a debate in
[15:06.520 --> 15:13.480]  Congress for the first time in modern history and then we could see Trump unseated and they're
[15:13.480 --> 15:15.680]  now admitting that's their goal.
[15:15.680 --> 15:29.840]  Hillary had Podesta come out from under a rock yesterday and call for a new election
[15:29.840 --> 15:34.320]  and say they're supporting having the CIA quote brief the electors.
[15:34.320 --> 15:39.480]  A rogue splinter element of the CIA that's not supposed to operate domestically in America
[15:39.480 --> 15:45.000]  is saying and now it's being announced that Obama is going to authorize the CIA to visit
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.520]  all of the electors and basically lean on them like the mafia gets caught leaning on
[15:50.520 --> 15:55.600]  grand juries and juries to ignore the vote, ignore their pledge that they sign and to
[15:55.600 --> 15:57.440]  deep six Donald Trump.
[15:57.440 --> 15:59.880]  This is total sedition.
[15:59.880 --> 16:04.680]  This is the foreign meddling and this is the Democratic Party that doesn't want to leave
[16:04.680 --> 16:13.040]  office holding on by their fingernails with 37 days left and George Soros doubling the
[16:13.040 --> 16:18.800]  funding that he did in the previous year the day after.
[16:18.800 --> 16:24.720]  Hillary lost and Kellogg's and 100 plus other big Miller Brewing you name it all the globalist
[16:24.720 --> 16:30.240]  all the usual suspects gave hundreds of millions more millions per company though we capture
[16:30.240 --> 16:36.440]  the election to black lives matter and the communist groups and all the violent destabilization
[16:36.440 --> 16:39.560]  cop killer organizations.
[16:39.560 --> 16:43.720]  This is a foreign globalist takeover just like the globalist he stabilize the Middle
[16:43.720 --> 16:49.080]  East and Africa using Islamists just like they use right wing versus left wing Christian
[16:49.080 --> 16:55.240]  orthodox versus Catholic Christians in in Ukraine they are dividing us and they're hyping
[16:55.240 --> 17:00.760]  up the race war and here's the bottom line I know for a fact Kanye West has been trying
[17:00.760 --> 17:05.240]  to break away from the Kardashians for a while he knows about the Illuminati he went to some
[17:05.240 --> 17:10.440]  of the spirit cooking events that were public and the word is Kanye West is having a freak
[17:10.440 --> 17:17.480]  out he was forcibly grabbed and kept in a mental institution for almost two weeks when he
[17:17.480 --> 17:22.160]  calmly said he's supporting Trump now and would have voted for him if he voted and the
[17:22.160 --> 17:25.840]  people should stop bashing Trump supporters and we should all come together he didn't
[17:25.840 --> 17:31.360]  fight anybody nothing happened and his managers grabbed him and threw him with the police into
[17:31.360 --> 17:37.320]  the back of a patty wagon to a mental institution but they were unable to break him while he
[17:37.320 --> 17:42.480]  was in there for 13 days and he came out and he said I'm divorcing Kim Kardashian and
[17:42.480 --> 17:47.640]  I'm done and this whole thing's the Illuminati what do you make of that and he goes to visit
[17:47.640 --> 17:52.840]  Donald Trump that guy's been at the parties in New York folks and I guarantee you he doesn't
[17:52.840 --> 17:57.920]  like it John Lennon went to some of these parties and his last songs before they killed
[17:57.920 --> 18:03.360]  him were about Satanism in New York those are not very popular songs hardly anybody's
[18:03.360 --> 18:07.160]  ever heard them I didn't even know they existed till I was sent a CD by listeners and when
[18:07.160 --> 18:11.680]  I talked to the family I'm gonna stop right there they said oh yeah that's what's going
[18:11.680 --> 18:14.680]  on and they told me I'm just gonna go ahead and say it but I can't say what they told
[18:14.680 --> 18:22.440]  me incredible stuff that was like six years ago so you have to understand ladies and gentlemen
[18:22.440 --> 18:26.000]  that John Lennon didn't want to be part of this he came out against the world government
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.440]  and he said there's a plan to depopulate the earth it's all made up remember that I could
[18:29.440 --> 18:34.240]  play the clip and it looks like Kanye West is waking up and I always said is this house
[18:34.240 --> 18:39.840]  of cards starts to fall there's gonna be people we didn't think were our friends that become
[18:39.840 --> 18:43.840]  our friends people we thought were our friends are gonna turn against us but here is the
[18:43.840 --> 18:49.240]  Intel now blowing up they said a year ago the CIA said Russians were involved they said
[18:49.240 --> 18:55.920]  it six months ago they said it four months ago at the RNC event in Cleveland then they
[18:55.920 --> 19:01.560]  said it five weeks ago on the eve of the election and that always came out it wasn't true then
[19:01.560 --> 19:05.880]  two weeks ago they said the alt right listing them forwards dot com and drive report dot com
[19:05.880 --> 19:09.680]  and right bar dot com listing us as a three they want to take down first then nobody's
[19:09.680 --> 19:15.720]  safe they skipped this break they said they want to shut us down and the EU said shut
[19:15.720 --> 19:20.760]  us down and the Washington Post last Wednesday had to admit that was all made up with no proof
[19:20.760 --> 19:24.840]  it was a fake list and had to retract it saying we weren't Russian agents because their lawyers
[19:24.840 --> 19:29.840]  told them suits are being filed you're going to lose so they said okay we have no proof
[19:29.840 --> 19:36.880]  we're sorry it's fake they said it's fake two days later they come out Bezos run Obama
[19:36.880 --> 19:46.560]  run paper told worse of the New York Times nothing worse comes out this fake news pariah
[19:46.560 --> 19:54.840]  and says that the CIA and 16 other agencies unanimously say it's a fraud and then ladies
[19:54.840 --> 20:00.400]  and gentlemen within two days of the lie the office of the director of national intelligence
[20:00.400 --> 20:08.200]  that runs all 17 agencies the quote biggest intelligence agency the fusion center comes
[20:08.200 --> 20:14.160]  out and says this is there's no proof it's very very thin you can't show intent this
[20:14.160 --> 20:20.120]  is crazy it's the Chinese that are bombarding us and even though press secretary slipped
[20:20.120 --> 20:25.280]  up yesterday in a press briefing and said it's the Chinese that are hacking folks they
[20:25.280 --> 20:32.720]  had bots hitting us they Hillary hired hundreds of millions in bots and fake posters and again
[20:32.720 --> 20:37.360]  the illegals voting and all the foreign money they turn everything around and blame the
[20:37.360 --> 20:45.600]  Russians RT is big globally because our media is so discredited but RT America has almost
[20:45.600 --> 20:50.280]  unreadable ratings they're only in some hotels I mean I mean I would go on RT America and
[20:50.280 --> 20:58.720]  have no response RT's effect on this country is barely even you can't even gauge it it's
[20:58.720 --> 21:02.480]  big in Europe though it's on broadcast TV in Europe I've been I mean there's broadcast
[21:02.480 --> 21:08.560]  TV in London it's on it's big in Europe but RT America is just like a baby it's like an
[21:08.560 --> 21:12.320]  oak tree is 20 feet tall and you know has a big canopy and there's some you know two
[21:12.320 --> 21:18.080]  inch tall little sprout wing that's RT America this claim is just bull America defeated the
[21:18.080 --> 21:22.900]  globalist America repudiated the Democrats and the Bushes and the whole old guard the
[21:22.900 --> 21:28.360]  Republican establishment that tried to steal the nomination and they're upset that we won
[21:28.360 --> 21:32.880]  and then on top of it oh the Russians hacked us why because Hillary had an illegal server
[21:32.880 --> 21:38.200]  and lied to everybody and they're all sharing data with everybody and and she got 35 million
[21:38.200 --> 21:48.000]  from them in a uranium deal they got a lot of nerve folks and now they got the CIA in
[21:48.000 --> 21:54.160]  involved in the middle of our election top US spy agency refuses to endorse CIA's Russian
[21:54.160 --> 22:00.840]  hacking assessment due to lack of evidence that's up on info wars dot com right now that's
[22:00.840 --> 22:07.760]  all over the news they can't stand the fact that this is happening flashback info wars
[22:07.760 --> 22:12.280]  dot com Kit Daniels from the New York Times Feds admit no Russian cyber attacks targeting
[22:12.280 --> 22:17.040]  election that was just a few weeks before the election go read the New York Times article
[22:17.040 --> 22:23.920]  all about it and that was again republished they admitted again on November 26 of this
[22:23.920 --> 22:30.040]  year just just less than a month ago boom they said it before the election and they said
[22:30.040 --> 22:36.000]  it after less than a month ago clapper said this did not happen but the order came down
[22:36.000 --> 22:41.240]  to give him some rogue briefing group just like the office of special plans at the Pentagon
[22:41.240 --> 22:47.960]  in 2002 that lied about the WMD's bipartisan if you can't get the main CIA to lie just
[22:47.960 --> 22:53.360]  create a new little special office of somebody that'll lie by Colin Powell holding up the
[22:53.360 --> 23:03.640]  anthrax vile meanwhile White House claims China hacked election calls Bolton conspiracy
[23:03.640 --> 23:10.240]  theorist we're gonna play that after the break but first Keith Oberman out of a job because
[23:10.240 --> 23:19.280]  of lack of ratings has crawled out from under a rock the arrogant Keith Oberman and he has
[23:19.280 --> 23:23.680]  launched this new thing called the resistance trying to rip us off obviously you know I
[23:23.680 --> 23:27.520]  love how they point out oh you're not the resistance now you're the establishment that Trump said
[23:27.520 --> 23:31.960]  no we're trying to get Trump in we're trying to remove all you've done you've got foreign
[23:31.960 --> 23:36.560]  powers the globalist the Federal Reserve the Republican establishment Democratic establishment
[23:36.560 --> 23:41.600]  the entire mainstream media all against the Liberty movement all against Brexit all against
[23:41.600 --> 23:49.680]  what's happening against your tyranny and so you're desperately trying to keep us from
[23:49.680 --> 23:55.240]  putting the Republic back in where the rule of law and prosperity and private property
[23:55.240 --> 24:01.640]  is the establishment where free will is the establishment I don't want to be the establishment
[24:01.640 --> 24:06.360]  on red carpets and flying around in helicopters on power trips I want to be able to live my
[24:06.360 --> 24:11.880]  life and raise my children as I see fit as long as I don't hurt anybody that's true liberalism
[24:11.880 --> 24:16.080]  your control freaks that want to dominate language you name it that are race pimping
[24:16.080 --> 24:20.960]  so Oberman does this whole fake teleprompter read you can tell he's reading a teleprompter
[24:20.960 --> 24:28.000]  that he scripted and he does it in a low-tech looking environment to sound like he's grassroots
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.600]  and he flips out we're going to analyze this piece here and basically calls for war with
[24:32.600 --> 24:38.160]  Russia and says America's under attack America's under attack by the consortium of globalists
[24:38.160 --> 24:44.480]  the EU the Pope the communist Chinese president the Saudi Arabians who all bragged that they
[24:44.480 --> 24:50.400]  financed Hillary illegally that's the foreign powers the illegals coming in the government
[24:50.400 --> 24:58.080]  opening the borders to do it America's under foreign attack and it's not by the Russians

[29:53.720 --> 30:01.960]  well well well bill gates is back in the news and no it's not about pushing more
[30:01.960 --> 30:06.760]  toxic vaccines on the third world for population control and he's not releasing a new bug filled
[30:06.760 --> 30:14.200]  os no bill gates is now going to release a new fund to tackle climate change and the new fund is
[30:14.200 --> 30:20.200]  called breakthrough energy ventures the fund will consider investing in electricity generation

[30:29.080 --> 30:33.480]  investing in green energy in fact bill gates has backed a string of clean energy products

[35:50.280 --> 35:54.360]  out of the euro it's the ruse keys italy's trying to pull out it's the ruse keys uk pulled out it's
[35:54.360 --> 35:59.960]  the ruse keys i don't want to turn my guns in because of the ruse keys the american people
[35:59.960 --> 36:06.360]  didn't vote they didn't win no no the ruse keys carried pennsylvania the ruse keys carried ohio
[36:06.360 --> 36:13.400]  the ruse keys carried florida the ruse keys carried michigan the ruse keys not the americans no the
[36:13.400 --> 36:18.920]  americans they can't do anything they can't get their jobs back even though he's already acting
[36:18.920 --> 36:23.400]  like the president he's the commander-in-chief already getting cheered by the army navy game
[36:23.400 --> 36:30.680]  as obama's basically booed but they don't care because keith oberman if you just tuned in there's
[36:30.680 --> 36:37.320]  this whole fake thing that he's angry and that we're at war we don't do something drastic and
[36:37.320 --> 36:42.840]  then all the big newspapers have op-hips kill trump kill kill kill no one goes to jail no one gets
[36:42.840 --> 36:50.840]  indicted i had a guy sending me letters and like 2002 saying i'm gonna kill bush when he comes to
[36:50.840 --> 36:54.760]  town i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do that i've got the weapons i thought it was a setup like they
[36:54.760 --> 36:58.520]  were trying to set me up or something so i called the secret service they came over got the material
[36:58.520 --> 37:02.360]  a week later it was in the tennessee papers people were calling me they want the guy that's big
[37:02.360 --> 37:08.120]  arsenal he was completely crazy he was planning to kill the president i mean they used to arrest
[37:08.120 --> 37:13.160]  you for this now they just get up on there go i'm gonna organize killing the president
[37:13.160 --> 37:17.320]  hollywood director doesn't get in trouble doesn't even get secret service visits
[37:17.320 --> 37:25.480]  they're organizing the demonization and the political assassination of trump they're assassinating
[37:25.480 --> 37:30.440]  his name his family his character and anyone that supports him at a high level like yours truly well
[37:30.440 --> 37:36.040]  you know what i'm honored to support somebody that wants americana and private property back
[37:36.040 --> 37:39.880]  and wants to bring our jobs back i'm honored to support somebody that supports the second
[37:39.880 --> 37:45.880]  amendment and our veterans i'm honored because trump isn't perfect but he's not out to get this
[37:45.880 --> 37:52.760]  country now let's play clapper speaking to congress yesterday admitting all of this while it's all
[37:52.760 --> 37:59.640]  contradicted here's they have the cia contradicting his own agency to cover his butt when they have
[37:59.640 --> 38:04.840]  this new nebulous secret report that that's been given to the washington post again who had to
[38:04.840 --> 38:11.480]  retract last week that the alt right is actually run by the russians they actually say i am run by the
[38:11.480 --> 38:19.640]  russians the evidence is he's gone on russian tv before and japanese and british and brazilian
[38:19.640 --> 38:25.880]  and canadian i've been on canadian tv probably 50 times i mean i'm a canadian oh yeah
[38:27.880 --> 38:33.320]  canadians are so nice you could wipe your butt with their flag and they'd apologize to you for it
[38:33.320 --> 38:40.840]  that's political correctness no more so let's go ahead and go to clapper director i want to
[38:40.840 --> 38:47.320]  drill down a little further uh into your comment that i pause this is adam schiff the democrat
[38:47.320 --> 38:54.600]  who accused last thursday fox news prime time hosts tucker carlson of being a russian agent
[38:54.600 --> 39:01.480]  this is the atmosphere we've now entered just some context that's the democrat from california
[39:01.480 --> 39:07.640]  on the intelligence committee a disgraceful malnourished chipmunk so let's start the clip over
[39:07.640 --> 39:15.720]  director i want to drill down a little further uh into your comment that the russian activity
[39:15.720 --> 39:23.160]  curtailed uh after the issuance of the statement um the dumping of documents didn't end uh with
[39:23.160 --> 39:33.480]  issuance of the statement um are you implying by this that uh that we know whether the documents
[39:33.480 --> 39:37.880]  provided to either cutouts or wiki leaks with those pillow about our house had all been provided
[39:37.880 --> 39:43.800]  prior to a state official about her or uh is it is it entirely possible that the
[39:44.600 --> 39:48.840]  dumping of documents continued after the statement but i'm telling somebody's catching some fast
[39:48.840 --> 39:54.760]  and what may have been avoided was a uh further escalation of the interference in the form of
[39:55.800 --> 40:02.840]  trying to monkey around on election day or thereafter i was referring to the uh cyber
[40:02.840 --> 40:08.760]  reconnaissance that we had a hit pause many states we don't edit these things this happens on
[40:08.760 --> 40:12.760]  mainstream news too i don't know what it is we try different downloaders when you download these
[40:12.760 --> 40:17.160]  hd clips it just does little pauses and then cuts back in that's not edited by the way i should add
[40:17.160 --> 40:21.880]  that's clapper who's admitted wahabi has lived in saudi arabia off and on for 20 years and his
[40:21.880 --> 40:27.880]  best friends were the king of shahd and the word is he converted to islam for the money but you
[40:27.880 --> 40:31.720]  wonder why we can't beat al qaeda or stop them or why we aided al qaeda to take over the middle east
[40:31.720 --> 40:36.040]  under the name of ices it's called clapper the same guy that lied to congressman says the united
[40:36.040 --> 40:42.760]  state is not spying americans ever that's like saying again the you know that the moon isn't made
[40:42.760 --> 40:47.880]  out of rock or that the sun isn't yellow i mean let's start to clip over with clapper here it is
[40:51.080 --> 40:56.360]  director i want to drill down a little further uh into your comment that the russian activity
[40:56.360 --> 41:03.880]  curtailed uh after the issuance of the statement um the dumping of documents didn't end uh with
[41:03.880 --> 41:12.680]  issuance of the statement um are you implying by this that uh uh that we know whether the
[41:13.480 --> 41:19.480]  documents provided to either cutouts or wiki leaks uh had all been provided prior to the
[41:19.480 --> 41:26.680]  statement that was issued or is it is it entirely possible that the dumping of documents continued
[41:26.680 --> 41:33.880]  after the statement looks at you uh and what may have been avoided was a uh further escalation
[41:33.880 --> 41:39.720]  of the interference in the form of uh trying to monkey round on election day or thereafter
[41:40.520 --> 41:48.840]  i was referring to the uh cyber reconnaissance that we had observed many states had state
[41:48.840 --> 41:56.520]  entities had had observed uh prior to the statement and that sort of activity seemed to
[41:56.520 --> 42:06.360]  have curtailed as far as the wiki leaks uh connection the evidence there is uh not
[42:07.080 --> 42:14.840]  as strong and we don't have good insight into the sequencing of the releases uh or when that
[42:14.840 --> 42:19.480]  when the data may have been provided we don't we don't have uh there's good insight into that
[42:20.120 --> 42:25.480]  okay so let's go back to keith oberman about a minute in i was i was interrupting this point
[42:25.480 --> 42:30.040]  everything he was saying was a big fat lie let's go back to keith oberman having his little fake
[42:30.040 --> 42:36.840]  meltdown breeding off a teleprompter uh here he is we are at war with russia or perhaps more
[42:36.840 --> 42:41.560]  correctly we have lost a war with russia without a battle we are no longer a sovereign nation we
[42:41.560 --> 42:46.760]  are no longer a democracy we are no longer a free people we are the victims of a bloodless coup so
[42:46.760 --> 42:52.920]  far a bloodless coup engineered by russia with at best the traitorous indifference of the republican
[42:52.920 --> 42:59.560]  party and donald john trump a man who to borrow a phrase from another december long ago we'll live
[42:59.560 --> 43:04.840]  in infamy in five weeks time unless desperate measures are taken we will hand over the government
[43:04.840 --> 43:11.080]  to a man who lost the popular vote by more than woodrow wilson or jimmy carter once again by the way
[43:11.080 --> 43:14.600]  i was saying clappers islamist the word is he is too and he spent a lot of time in saudi arabia
[43:14.600 --> 43:17.800]  but it's john brennan they looked to say on the act was saying but he is the guy that lied
[43:17.800 --> 43:22.200]  about the nsa it's just uh you look at the guy's a total besser but let's go back to oberman here
[43:23.320 --> 43:28.120]  so so over saying he lost by more than anybody ever basically the popular vote except we know
[43:28.120 --> 43:31.400]  a bunch of illegals voted and a bunch of people voted for dead people they got arrested all of
[43:31.400 --> 43:36.520]  the country doing it we know that trump gained votes when they did a recount so there you go
[43:36.520 --> 43:40.520]  oberman so it's all about undermining undermining undermining because they want to finish off this
[43:40.520 --> 43:45.160]  country they think they own it they think they're better than you their whole ideology is about
[43:45.160 --> 43:49.960]  they're the leftist they're the fops they're the pseudo-intellectuals they're the skinny tywares
[43:49.960 --> 43:55.000]  they're going to show you bitter clingers here he is man whom the russians wanted to run our
[43:55.000 --> 43:59.720]  country for them a man who the russians got to run our country for them a man for whom the russians
[43:59.720 --> 44:04.840]  interfered with our election cause again which if we did it to another okay there you go so the american
[44:04.840 --> 44:14.120]  people didn't vote nobody wants trump it's all russian mind control described as an act of war
[44:14.760 --> 44:21.560]  and in this country we have conceded defeat some experts other war margarine strategist john weaver
[44:21.560 --> 44:27.160]  because russia have compared this to pearl harbor even the hard right ex congressman bill walsh says
[44:27.160 --> 44:34.520]  republican silence will be tantamount to treason some of us too oh even the republican establishment
[44:34.520 --> 44:40.120]  is against trump boy what a surprise and the cia you call yourself the resistance oberman in this
[44:40.120 --> 44:46.200]  piece you're the establishment hanging on by its fingernails gasping for its last breath
[44:46.200 --> 44:50.360]  because you don't want us to make this country great again and be independent continue who have
[44:50.360 --> 44:56.760]  proved courageous trump self-destructive to the last issued a childish statement mocking the cia
[44:56.760 --> 45:01.880]  but as tim dickinson of rolling stone noted not denying anything he did deny the vast majority
[45:01.880 --> 45:07.080]  of republicans have said nothing and the vast majority of democrats have said nothing and the
[45:07.080 --> 45:12.680]  vast majority of the media has said nothing of subsistence and the media is in a complete
[45:12.680 --> 45:17.240]  hissy fit saying overturn the election it's all over the russians are getting as he just everything
[45:17.240 --> 45:23.400]  he says is a lie or has twisted i mean this guy is an absolute liar trumping out all these tweets
[45:23.400 --> 45:28.440]  saying it's made up it's bull it's a conspiracy theory this is outrageous but he just says trump
[45:28.440 --> 45:33.160]  just laughs about it notice he doesn't show you a clip though let's continue with it with this
[45:33.160 --> 45:42.040]  disgraced unemployed twit president has said nothing close to enough the cia and fbi and homeland
[45:42.040 --> 45:47.800]  security the institutions whose interest in freedom we on the left most frequently distrust
[45:48.360 --> 45:53.720]  they have said something they said at first to congressional and senator let's pause back that
[45:53.720 --> 45:58.360]  up 15 seconds again i could sit here and write a whole article about this somebody should one of
[45:58.360 --> 46:02.200]  our writers should take my breakdown and then go over all the lies because this is all on record
[46:02.200 --> 46:07.240]  the fbi says they've been through all the rnc servers and that it did not happen and they've
[46:07.240 --> 46:13.000]  also said no evidence russia was involved but that china was because china is but for hillary
[46:13.000 --> 46:20.280]  with their bots so it's all on record just google fbi disagrees with cia about russian hack that was
[46:20.280 --> 46:26.840]  in the news yesterday the day before a week ago a month ago a year ago oberman is lying to his
[46:26.840 --> 46:33.480]  pseudo-intellectual idiot viewers that's why obama doesn't go on news anymore because they have no
[46:33.480 --> 46:39.000]  viewers he goes on comedy central on fake news shows to push race-baiting narratives yesterday
[46:40.840 --> 46:45.800]  and they've got sports casters like this guy reading off teleprompters he's an actor folks
[46:45.800 --> 46:53.800]  let's go back to it president has said nothing close to enough the cia and fbi and homeland
[46:53.800 --> 46:59.560]  security the institutions whose interest in freedom we on the left most frequently distrust
[47:00.120 --> 47:04.840]  they have said something they said at first to congressional and senate republicans in
[47:04.840 --> 47:10.280]  september in paul's year all 17 agencies have said for over the year this is made up bull
[47:10.280 --> 47:15.640]  clapper said they didn't have proof yesterday but some secret group talked to president obama
[47:15.640 --> 47:21.240]  and they did and hillary wants a new election now here it is let's go back to them warnings that
[47:21.240 --> 47:26.520]  mitch mcconnell and other republicans reportedly buried warnings that the russians using computer
[47:26.520 --> 47:31.720]  hacking and perhaps other means we're not merely trying to discredit the election but to achieve
[47:31.720 --> 47:38.760]  the specific outcome of electing their man trump and finally at the very last hour some of those
[47:38.760 --> 47:43.640]  who did those briefings and some of those who received those briefings leaked the details to
[47:43.640 --> 47:49.000]  the new york times the washington post cbs news roiders in a torrent of anguished honesty
[47:49.000 --> 47:55.560]  they said something they said something as the president not elect began to veer towards appointing
[47:55.560 --> 48:03.320]  as secretary of state as our diplomatic face to the world the ceo of exxon who four years ago
[48:03.320 --> 48:12.680]  received the order of friendship from bladamere hooten they said something that's given to any
[48:12.680 --> 48:17.080]  major corporation or company that comes in and hires a lot of russians and we give foreign you
[48:17.080 --> 48:24.120]  know japan's gotten awards for moving their tundra truck factories to texas exxon's drilling all
[48:24.120 --> 48:31.000]  over the world russia isn't communist anymore we need to work with russia china needs to be dealt
[48:31.000 --> 48:37.400]  with and encircled it's the big evil operator oppressing its own people and that's the constellation
[48:37.400 --> 48:47.720]  trump's gonna set up south korean russia japan in the east you move to the west
[48:48.840 --> 48:54.360]  defeat the euro bring liberty back bring back deals and prosperity and not a wartime economy
[48:54.360 --> 48:59.480]  he wants to get rid of these billion dollar fighter planes already have a defense that works
[48:59.480 --> 49:05.080]  let's continue where oberman really goes into the hissy fit the order of friendship from bladamere
[49:05.080 --> 49:10.760]  hooten they said something as the members of the electoral college prepared to gather next
[49:10.760 --> 49:17.240]  monday to finalize this coup some perhaps unaware that almost half the states they represent permit
[49:17.240 --> 49:22.920]  them by law to vote for someone other than they want to block trump being elected folks only 38 of
[49:22.920 --> 49:29.640]  them need to do so to prevent this coup they said something as one the coup by the american voters
[49:29.640 --> 49:35.560]  the they consider it a coup that they were unable to steal even though she stole five states continue
[49:36.360 --> 49:43.240]  especially chilling detail in one of the reports sailed by that quote the russians hacked the
[49:43.240 --> 49:48.440]  republican national committee's computer systems in addition to their attacks on democratic organizations
[49:48.440 --> 49:54.840]  but did not release whatever information the fbi says that's not true it is a short leak from that
[49:54.840 --> 49:59.960]  conclusion and it is anything but a conspiracy theory to be wondering if the russians hacked the
[49:59.960 --> 50:05.480]  rnc and have kept what they've found there to make sure trump and the republicans obeyed my
[50:05.480 --> 50:10.040]  hit pause again i can tell by his eye movements and where he's looking every time in the way his
[50:10.040 --> 50:15.480]  eyes are moving it's well known if you're in tv almost everybody uses he has those papers to act
[50:15.480 --> 50:21.640]  like that's his notes but he's going from the heart it's all off a teleprompter he pauses he
[50:21.640 --> 50:27.080]  breathes he looks back up i have these notes to really go off these because these are articles i'm
[50:27.080 --> 50:35.000]  showing you just just a disgraceful pig monster we come back we'll play the rest of it uh but
[50:35.000 --> 50:41.960]  man when you're informed you realize all of its lies like 80 lies 20 spin none of its truth
[50:43.400 --> 50:50.440]  the fbi stood up the fbi says that that the rnc was hacked the fbi's come out and said this is a
[50:50.440 --> 50:56.120]  complete lie i mean oberman thinks you're an idiot he's praying on you he's a predator

[56:34.920 --> 56:38.760]  they're holding back for folks that are on auto ship and i want to announce this i'm gonna have my
[56:38.760 --> 56:43.640]  dad in studio later in the week uh we kept working with some of the biggest toothpaste manufacturers
[56:43.640 --> 56:48.120]  in the country my dad's an oral surgeon and dentist he was managing hundreds of clinics when he retired
[56:48.120 --> 56:51.640]  three years ago and came to work with us here developing products as he's developed things
[56:51.640 --> 56:57.960]  that have gotten fda approval before on the drug side we wanted him for compliance uh he's also
[56:57.960 --> 57:03.720]  chemist working with doctor group and others uh i mainly hired him for fda compliance uh
[57:03.720 --> 57:07.960]  though it's not drugs it's it's it's nutraceuticals and it's good to have a doctor as well so he
[57:07.960 --> 57:11.560]  can actually get some of these compounds even though they're not controlled substances they
[57:11.560 --> 57:17.000]  don't sell you stuff i mean miso bici america doesn't talk to you unless you've got a doctor on staff
[57:17.000 --> 57:21.800]  now he did everything he said just let me do it because i've tried for three years to get a
[57:21.800 --> 57:29.480]  toothpaste like this that just had iodine and colloidal silver in it true high quality iodine
[57:29.480 --> 57:34.840]  not potassium iodine but pure atomic iodine that doesn't mean nuclear it means in its true form
[57:34.840 --> 57:39.400]  from deep earth crystals nine nine nine nine nine nine pure well ladies and gentlemen
[57:40.600 --> 57:46.360]  my dad even made the graphic we're i'm gonna redo it it's it's cute it looks like something from
[57:46.360 --> 57:50.280]  the fifties but he even did this himself he said let me do everything it took you about a year to
[57:50.280 --> 57:54.920]  do it we we failed that for two years so you're going to get over and suddenly it's here now i've
[57:54.920 --> 57:59.640]  had testers of this that have been coming in for six months when he was testing different types of it
[57:59.640 --> 58:05.400]  we got 10 000 containers of this it is nine ninety five it costs us like four dollars a tube
[58:06.120 --> 58:09.320]  so normally toothpaste is four dollars a tube because it doesn't have all these ingredients in it
[58:09.320 --> 58:13.560]  but it's it's nine ninety five and it's discounted from twelve ninety five it's a big old heavy tube
[58:13.560 --> 58:19.320]  of it and it's called super blue that's his name non fluoride toothpaste it's got peppermint
[58:19.320 --> 58:26.760]  and tea tree oil and iodine and nano silver this stuff is incredible i mean and i can't tell you
[58:26.760 --> 58:30.600]  how much heart disease is caused obviously because of bad gums and the bacteria getting into the
[58:30.600 --> 58:35.480]  bloodstream and getting into the ventricles this is the best toothpaste out there nobody's got this
[58:35.480 --> 58:41.320]  it's game changer info wars life dot com be the first to get super blue in the original container
[58:41.320 --> 58:45.320]  my dad designed it's still pretty good better than i would do it's just that my dad did all this

[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:31.480]  i need you i want you to be my tonight all right so oberman is floating this conspiracy theory
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:36.440]  that that's made up i mean it's a fact hillary got money from the communist chinese and saudi arabia
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:41.800]  they bragged about it and it's illegal that's mainstream news no proof of the russians clapper
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:49.080]  admits that we've got the white house uh spokesman coming out john urnish yesterday and admitting it's
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.120]  the chinese i mean they can't even get their bull straight but oberman says this is anything
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:01:01.240]  but a conspiracy theory we're at war with russia what a wonderful idea they're not encroaching
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:05.480]  on us they have nothing to do with us let's just have a war because the liberal oberman
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.800]  is desperate to keep donald trump out of power this just proves how bad these people are there's
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:16.600]  so much worse than i even thought they know they're an enemy force of the globalist bringing the
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:22.040]  country down they're never going to stop folks they're not going to come exist with us understand
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:26.680]  that further calling for trump's death my death you name it let's go back to oberman that uh
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.800]  this is such a disgraceful idiot here it is and it is anything but a conspiracy theory
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:38.760]  you'd be wondering if the russians hacked the rnc and have kept what they found there to make
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:47.160]  sure trump and the republicans obeyed okay let's pause again the fbi never said that they said they
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:52.680]  were not hacked they didn't have their servers in their bathroom like hillary you are a liar oberman
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:58.520]  back to him states who at this rate will be the last freely elected president of the united states
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:03.960]  made in his measured way a small gesture last friday that perhaps opened the door to these
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:10.520]  horrifying revelations of a coup by an outside power nearly complete he asked me to pause again
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:15.000]  the coup is nearly complete of the voters let's just say the russians did it which
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.960]  the british ambassador met a month ago in dc with the high level u.s intelligence officer that
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.760]  leaked it william benny has told me on air six months ago that it was an intel officer
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.800]  he said on air he thinks it is i'm gonna stop right there when i've had dinner with benny
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:33.240]  there's people following us around okay i mean he's the former head of the nsa technical i mean i
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.960]  live in a spy movie i'm just gonna stop right there the point is we know it was us intel
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.960]  they hate obama they hate hillary and by the way they're the ones that are going to release more
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:47.400]  oberman they're not blackmailing they're trying to fix the country it's so damaging though oberman
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:52.280]  they're holding it back because it's that bad but it's worse than letting you continue on so go
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:59.000]  ahead and fill your hand dumbass you're up against real men now dumbo that don't use teleprompters
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:06.120]  we do the hanging boy figure it out we run the country we built it you're just a parasite now
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:14.120]  the russians the russians are blackmailing people you're the ones with the illegal servers
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:19.160]  you're the ones calling a scum and saying you want us poor and desperate in the emails don't
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:23.720]  change the subject dirt bag that the mainstream media is discredited saying trump would lose
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.760]  for all the fake emails you're desperately trying to change the subject from what a scumbag you are
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.200]  back to the traitor you but we do not have time for a full review
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:39.560]  barack obama has twice stood in front of america in front of the world in front of history and said
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:44.840]  i do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.520]  and will to the best of my ability to solve the borders and protect and defend the constancy
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:54.280]  force inoculations and come after our guns is the time for him to do so he must immediately
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:04:01.400]  declassify and release all relevant materials held by the yellow the cia dhs and the other
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:06.440]  intelligence and wmd services and in the white house and anywhere else in government and the
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:12.280]  attorney general must immediately appoint a special prosecutor to investigate what donald trump knew
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:19.320]  and when he knew oh yeah what if any collusive links exist now the root here between the russian
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:25.560]  federation and the republican national committee if trump does grab power he can try to dismiss
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:31.240]  that special prosecutor but he will at least have to get the courts to sanction him and most
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:36.440]  immediately the intelligence briefing proposed today for the electoral college what the cia and
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:41.720]  the others know when they knew it how much the trump campaign knew that must be conducted without
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:48.520]  delay and without regard let's get paused as he resolve a teleprompter i told trump this publicly
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.280]  and privately he must go on the offense they're never going to stop he's got to bring out china
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.200]  and and and and Saudi Arabia how they openly bragged they ran the election and failed well well
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:03.240]  well bill gates is back in the news and no it's not about pushing more toxic vaccines on the third

[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:12.440]  kellan mcgreen proof foreign governments did interfere in election to help hillary the communist
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.840]  chinese and the saudi arabians bragged in newspapers they'd given hundreds of millions
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:21.880]  through us subsidiaries that's illegal but hillary control the justice department so they're the ones
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.960]  getting foreign money they're the ones bringing the illegals in they're the ones with the eu involved
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:31.880]  in the pope and all this and then they say trump is and then clapper is in front of the congress
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:37.320]  yesterday and says there's no proof they were involved in wikileaks the fbi says no proof they
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:42.840]  hacked the rnc but oberman and everybody else in hillary comes out and protested and says
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:48.120]  the fbi agrees and all 17 agencies agree the problem is and this is not getting any real
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:52.920]  traction it's in a few newspapers top us spies he refuses to endorse cia's russian
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:58.120]  acting assessment due to lack of evidence says it's a thin reed no proof of intent that's the
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:04.680]  office of the director of national intelligence that oversees all other 16 agencies it was set up
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:12.040]  in 2002 to coordinate it's the boss so they are really putting this dis info out which shows they
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:18.840]  will go to any links roger stone the stone cold truth dot com former head of the trump campaign
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.320]  and of course former best friends with ritchard nixon as well boy the old days of nixon he looks
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:30.280]  like a loving american compared to these monsters i tell you they are arrogant they are angry they
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:35.880]  are full of bravada and hutzpah i don't know what to say at this point they are frothing man
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:41.080]  they're pissed on the street this is a true cult i think roger of anything this is revealed the
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:46.840]  fact that the modern liberal is a very dangerous gang member mental patient and their leaders are
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:52.120]  even worse than them uh what do you make of all this hysteria and where this is going well alex
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:59.480]  this is a concerted campaign with several steps the first step has been to harp on the popular vote
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:04.840]  so by which of course we don't elect the president and the fact that hillary has at least with the
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:11.080]  counting where we are today a lead there then secondarily was the phony recount in wisconsin
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:17.160]  michigan and pennsylvania in the hopes that it would yield something but he yielded nothing
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:22.600]  well game votes for trump just like gain for trump uh and it proved nothing in wisconsin
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:30.360]  uh now thirdly is this whole canard about uh russia we still have no proof of this whatsoever
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:37.080]  it's a it's a theme but it's a theme without proof the new york times wrote that congressman
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:42.200]  mccall a republican from texas said oh yes the russians were involved but when i checked
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:50.680]  that was based on a verbal briefing from the cia he's seen no proof so uh this is an effort
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:56.920]  you're absolutely right aimed directly at the electors to try to spook the electors it's the last
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:03.480]  grasp of the power establishment the two-party duopoly the world globalists to keep control
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.280]  because they see control of the federal government going to down from and let's just say this
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:13.480]  very slowly very calmly and let this roll off your tongue and roll off your mind folks like
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:20.600]  water off the duck's back but but let it sink in the cia a rogue secret group run by obama and
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:27.960]  soros and hillary admittedly says they want new elections on cnn led by bob bear whose job is
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:35.080]  overthrowing governments this is a discredited did you know professional liar group they are openly
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:41.240]  saying we're going to visit the electors and have a little talk with them translate that the cia is
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:47.800]  going to try to intimidate people sworn and pledge to represent the popular vote of people within the
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:52.840]  electoral college in those states he took so he did get the vote in those states and they're saying
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:14:01.640]  don't listen to that overturn the election this is outrageous yeah it's uh it's a power grab uh
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:09.240]  given the cia's history of lies lying about ben gazi lying about vietnam lying about the
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:16.040]  kennedy assassination lying about everything in their entire history um this is all agate prop
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:21.560]  this is the last grasp of the establishment i think trump has been right on point by saying
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:28.040]  this entire argument is ridiculous yet no one wants to look at the role of the soddies or the
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:33.320]  chinese particularly the soddies in hillary's campaign where they're openly bragging about
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:40.120]  financing or effort to hold on to the white house so what's the next step i mean how how
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:43.880]  powerful is this move going to be because i know a lot of people have been underestimating it
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:48.200]  i've been concerned since november night that night uh when it was announced he was the winner i
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:52.360]  told you sitting in this room as you know the champagne glasses have been drained at three
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:57.480]  a.m i said roger my gut tells me they're gonna try to assassinate him they're going to try to
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:02.760]  overturn this election they're gonna play possum i mean i really have been proven right that we
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:09.960]  cannot underestimate uh how evil these people are no i look i think that the good news is of course
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:16.840]  that the electors in most cases are are you know loyal republicans i do think there needs to be
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:23.080]  some counterpoint some communication between them and the president elect and the transition
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:29.640]  and the cia should not be going and talking to electors some nebulous secret group from the cia
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:35.000]  completely inappropriate um and well we have to presume that once president trump
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:41.640]  takes office that he's going to clean out needs to clean out the cia top to bottom uh the last
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:46.680]  president do that was jimmy carter and it proved to be quite dangerous as you know yeah he needs to
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:51.160]  pull all the snot-nosed white shoe boy ivy leaguers that think they're better than everybody just if
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.640]  you're an ivy leager you're not in the cia pull them out and then put people from all over the
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:00.440]  country diverse backgrounds in and mainly military people from the four branches of the military
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:04.760]  and that's where it should be anyways we always had military intelligence naval and army before
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:11.960]  that it's time to pull out all the the the east coast blue blood uh atlantic accent uh you know
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:19.320]  first and howl the third garbage it's time to pull that that east coast uh you know anglophile coup
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:25.320]  which they admit it is out of there and put the military back in control of intelligence i say
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:31.000]  get rid of every frickin blue blood i'm in i'm in total agreement the place needs to be cleaned
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:39.480]  out top to bottom as does the fbi uh clearly under director comey the fbi has acted in a blatantly
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:48.200]  political matter they have now lied about the 650 000 emails in the um in the uh trove kept by
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:54.600]  huma abedin and her husband anthony weiner which i think will be the ultimate downfall and prosecution
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:17:00.280]  of the clinton's down from needs to clean house he really needs to drain the swamp and he can start
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:05.720]  at the two largest law enforcement agencies we have or i should say the two largest investigative
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:10.920]  agencies that we have now the fbi has done a lot of bad things obviously but compared to the cia
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:16.520]  they have an ancient feud but the the fbi's on records saying the rnc was not hacked russia was
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:21.240]  not doing all this obviously russia was probably getting into servers like dozens of other governments
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:26.120]  because hillary was out there dangling in front of everybody that's russia's job but influencing
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:31.800]  the election this is laughable the chinese brag the sally rabies brag as you know that they were
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:37.240]  pumping hundreds of millions into hillary why does it trump come out with all his surrogates and and
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:42.760]  point out the headlines where they bragged that they were the ones that influenced it and and say
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:48.680]  you're the one that's going to get investigated dnc and start indicting their asses well it's funny
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:53.640]  you say that alex i've just written a memo to uh that effect i mean i'm in total agreement it's
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:18:00.920]  time to go on offense uh president elect trump has been uh very conciliatory since he became
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:08.200]  the designated become president he has i think sought to unite the country he's met with people who
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:14.840]  are admittedly his opponents people who were adamantly opposed to his election but now it's
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:20.680]  time to act i frankly think in a more partisan fashion um because these are partisan attacks
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:24.360]  they go beyond republicans it's an attack on the integrity of this country they're claiming we're
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:28.520]  russian agents we have to have a war with russia have you seen hoberman and others foaming at the
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:34.600]  mouth going we are at war with russia we need to have a war what the hell are they after after i
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:42.120]  spoke to you yesterday i was walking down the street in my in uh manhattan um i was uh on second
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:50.840]  avenue in the 60s and a man came up to me and spit on me and called me a a a soviet spy a russian
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:56.360]  spy and a scumbag this is the tolerance did i not warn you yesterday morning that this is
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:01.960]  happening to me uh yes i heard you were assaulted on the uh trail on the hiking trail it's the same
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:08.440]  deal tolerance of the liberals who keep arguing that there's no civility in our politics i mean
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:14.200]  this guy was rabid he was drooling at the mouth i did nothing to provoke him he evidently recognized
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:19.720]  me from info wars and uh he just went animal uh let me ask you this question i mean how
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.960]  does he respond to him i know you're half sicilian you told me you tell me as i put up with that
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:28.200]  well i should have just decked him right then and there but the light changed frankly and he took
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.960]  off and i wasn't in a suit in the mood to change sure that's what they do that's what they do they
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:35.880]  run off but i mean why do you think they're so wild i i get the criminals at the top they've got a
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.800]  stake in taking the country down and feeding off of it and selling it off you know in a corporate
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:44.760]  takeover but why why do their minions hate us so much when all we want to do is cut their taxes
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:50.760]  and make america great again because they believe the constant mainstream media harangue that we are
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:56.280]  bigots that we are racist that trump is going to finance the coup clark's plan that he's going to
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:03.080]  roll back gay marriage that he is going to uh arrest people for using medicinal marijuana
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:08.920]  none of these things are true but but when the mainstream media repeats them ad nauseam over
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:16.040]  and over and over again you know the people at the bottom the shock troops the average leftist
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:22.920]  starts to believe them so uh they have poisoned the atmosphere they have lied repeatedly about
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:28.200]  trump they're still stunned that he won this election and that's right and they also have
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:32.040]  turned the rhetoric up so high they keep saying our rhetoric's high we're going to get people killed
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:36.120]  they had an article in the washington post as you know yesterday saying donald trump's going
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:42.920]  to get people killed because he mildly tweeted back at the at the uh union head of the steel
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:47.800]  workers union in indianapolis that said he hadn't done enough he said what's your problem no wonder
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:52.280]  do you lost those jobs you're the one that couldn't keep them i brought back 85 of them what's your
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:58.760]  problem i mean they say we're violent for standing up for ourselves politely while they're calling
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:03.880]  for killing trump in every major publication well these are the same people who had nothing to say
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:11.480]  when it was revealed that we did in fact lose some cia assets uh were killed because of the uh leaked
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:18.440]  emails of hillary clinton that didn't bother them at all uh the fact that she had put her emails on
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:24.280]  a server where this country's enemies could easily access them so there this is the typical
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:30.760]  double standard um i will breathe easier after the electors have cast their vote um but at this
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:37.720]  point i think the die is cast i don't think the the concerted campaign and this is a campaign with
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:41.400]  multiple steps is going to be successful i think it's one of the biggest campaigns i've
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:47.480]  ever seen i mean the bots the attacks on myself you on trump i mean it's synthetic i see it it's
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:53.320]  it's twice what was at the peak of the election it is foaming at the mouth insanity uh soros this
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:58.040]  is a metric has doubled his money the black lives matter all the big corporations are just spilling
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:03.880]  money out for a civil insurrection i guess in the next 36 days uh 37 days i mean this is just
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:08.280]  bedlam roger let me ask you that question people can google the electoral college it'll come up
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:14.120]  with some breakdowns about works the 19th they vote by the sixth they've got to be in then congress
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:18.440]  i guess starts looking at it if there's any dispute uh so when will we know definitively if
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:22.840]  they've been successful because they are calling for a new election as you know i mean this is a
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:28.520]  concerted move to have a coup against the american voter my guess is you'll have leaks
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:33.880]  out of the congress and you'll have a running count that is in public i'm sure that there are
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:39.960]  a few republican electors who will go over the side mostly you know bush supporters who got on
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:46.280]  the party's slate uh to be an elector these are chosen by the state parties let's remember
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:55.400]  but by and large um this may be the genius of trump selecting right's previous if he isn't out there
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:01.480]  working in these electors as the titular head of the republican party he ought to be these are his
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:07.720]  people these are the state parties people who were selected to be these electors and it would
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:14.600]  be previous's major job to keep them in line roger i've been asking the questions here in
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:18.280]  the few minutes we have left obviously you've been at trump tower quite a bit you're writing your
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:22.680]  book you've cut back on interviews i'm i'm proud you're still coming here you're gonna be hosting
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:28.040]  the fourth hour tomorrow give folks the title of the book again it's very powerful i've already
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:32.200]  seen some little snippets i know you've been interviewing myself and the president and others
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:37.960]  for it but separately a president elect uh this is a political statement to send it to number one
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:42.840]  political books it's gonna have a blueprint into the future as well that i know meshes with bannon
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:47.960]  and president trump people need to see what the real blueprint is not even so much the rhetoric
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:51.800]  tell folks about the name of your book and how they get it sure it's called the making of the
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:58.440]  president 2016 how donald trump orchestrated an american revolution uh you can order it today
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:05.240]  in advance on amazon or barnes and noble uh you can uh you can go shortly to the info wars dot
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:11.000]  com store and order it there um but this is going to be the definitive inside look of how
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.280]  donald trump pulled off the greatest political upset in u.s political history uh but it's also
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:24.040]  going to be a blueprint to the future uh and how trump plans to transform america and make it great
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:30.200]  again um you know i'm using the writing style of the late theodore h white teddy white who i
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:36.040]  actually knew quite well who i met in the 76 presidential campaign uh so i'm gonna be looking
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:41.880]  at kind of the big national trends uh that elected trump but i'm also going to be you know producing
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:46.920]  some down and dirty vignettes from the campaign trail sure so i think it's going to be a great read
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:51.080]  you know i hope sometime after this is all over and the president's you know in sconce and we're
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:54.600]  reversing the globalist cancer you'll come on and talk about because i've done a little bit of
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:57.960]  stalking of you and i've probably read 20 news you know new york times articles about you going
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:02.760]  back to the 80s uh with you and roy cone and uh donald trump hanging out and all the stuff you
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:07.080]  were up to of course they demonized roy cone and a lot about him who he was what he did a hard-nosed
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:12.760]  lawyer of course of the whole mccarthy era but that's who trump sat at the knee of uh and who
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:16.680]  really helped him that's why they're so scared of him because roy cone was the anti-communist pro
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:21.320]  america pro free market and that's what's got him so scared too well and he was a brawler he was a
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:26.440]  fighter i mean uh you know i didn't know him obviously in the 50s because i was born in 1952
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:33.560]  uh but i knew him later in the new york years and he was one of the major figures in the defeat
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:38.280]  of jimmy carter and the election of ronald reagan he was by the way a lifelong democrat
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:45.240]  he also was i think transformative in donald trump's understanding of the world outside of
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:51.480]  queens he was very helpful to donald and his move to manhattan and his move to become
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:57.240]  um the most prominent real estate developer in the world not just in manhattan but in the world

[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:52.360]  really hard to do infowarslive.com we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:30:02.360]  radio network well well well bill gates is back in the news and no it's not about pushing more toxic
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:07.800]  vaccines on the third world for population control and he's not releasing a new bug filled os no bill
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:15.640]  gates is now going to release a new fund to tackle climate change and the new fund is called breakthrough
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:21.400]  energy ventures the fund will consider investing in electricity generation storage transportation
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:25.480]  agriculture and energy system efficiency seed money for startups and projects ready for
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:30.200]  commercialization among other efforts will be considered bill loves investing in green energy
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:34.600]  in fact bill gates has backed a string of clean energy products including the nuclear reactor
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:39.560]  startup terra power which after eight years hasn't even built a working prototype so mr gates and
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:43.880]  his super friends are going to see this investment firm with a billion dollars but i don't think he
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:49.240]  consulted mit who did a study that found venture capital investors lost over half of the 25 billion
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:54.440]  they plowed into the clean energy technology sector from 2006 to 2011 rob dew reporting

[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:31.400]  i want to show that everybody that voted for trump every race color and creed we're all human
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:35.720]  red blood the globalists are in retreat all over the world they're panicking
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:44.920]  nationalism and self-determination is rising now paul has just shot another exclusive video
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:51.080]  that just went up on info wars dot com total debunking of the mainstream media fake news narrative
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:34:00.120]  but he shot another viral video we're going to play in a moment that deals with the total fraud
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:05.240]  of claiming that the russians hacked the election now that was yesterday since then
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:10.600]  we've seen the white house press secretary come out and say it's the chinese that hacked well they
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:17.160]  were for hillary publicly and since then we've seen that the head of all the intelligence agencies
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:24.600]  come out and say the cia is wrong and this is all basically bull and that the cia is just being
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:29.160]  political and they can't show intent by the russians meanwhile proof foreign governments did
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:34.680]  interfere in the election to help illy but it was china it was salya arabia who bragged about it
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:39.720]  but my big question to paul was before i play this video and interrupt him with himself
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:42.280]  then he plays this other exclusive video premiering in here right now
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:51.160]  my concern is the arrogance the hysteria the craziness paul my concern is they're gonna not
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:56.120]  stop so i think trumps got to get on the offensive with the fact that they they were influencing
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:02.440]  the election with foreign powers but it was hillary doing it paul no exactly if you look at the
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.920]  the original wikileaks emails it was the clinton camp it was clinton supporters that came out with
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:14.680]  that fake news that the wikileaks emails were doctored that was the origin and then the media
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:20.760]  talking heads the clintonites in the media seized on that put out those fake wikileaks that were
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:26.600]  created by clinton supporters to make trump supporters look bad and then the media pushed that
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:31.240]  so if you go back to the very origin of this fake news scandal which coincides with the russian
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:36.920]  thing it was created by the clinton camp and then pushed by the mainstream media but you
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:43.160]  mentioned i mean you were concerned about trump as of two hours ago a student with a bag full of
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:49.400]  knives weapons explosives tried to get into trump tower now he claims that he's a trump supporter
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:54.200]  and that he's been walking around new york for years with a bag full of knives weapons and
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:59.400]  explosives if you believe that so we're already seeing the mainstream media's hysterical fake
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:03.320]  news narrative about trump being the next one you're gonna break it all down as no one else can
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:07.400]  and then you're also gonna be hosting an hour on thursday paul but before you go any further what
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:12.680]  do you make of oberman's complete meltdown well it's it's a complete role reversal isn't it of
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:18.280]  the mccarthy idea that anyone who dissents against the establishment is in league with russia and
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:25.160]  again they planned this month before the election in fact uh bribar article called it how clinton's
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:31.320]  russia conspiracy theory could nullify the vote they planned if trump won this was their reserve
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:36.840]  plan to blame russia for hacking the election sure in fact we said that months ago we said that at
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:41.080]  the time we wrote articles bribarton as well now here's your report on what really happened
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:46.520]  with russia and the election here's paul watson and we'll come back to the live paul watson paul take
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:52.920]  over the post-election riots failed the death threats against electoral college members failed
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:37:01.240]  jill stein's recount failed your entire fake news narrative failed and now this individuals connected
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:06.680]  to the russian government reportedly provided wiki leaks with hacked emails as part of a
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:13.880]  wider russian operation to boost trump and hurt clinton's chances the left is willing to risk civil
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:22.200]  war in america and nuclear war with russia because they're but her about losing let that sink in not
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:29.320]  a single shred of evidence has been presented to support the claim that russia hacked the election
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:35.960]  former uk ambassador craig murray met the dnc leaker and said he was not russian he was a
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:42.840]  disgruntled insider julian assange said all along that the source was not russia the clinton camp
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:49.960]  has been able to project a kind of neo macarthia hysteria that russia is responsible for everything
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:55.880]  that's false so who do you trust wiki leaks an organization with impeccable credibility that
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:38:03.000]  has never put a foot wrong or anonymous cia sources whose entire job description is based on
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:09.400]  deception and who are these cia sources they can't tell us but they're undoubtedly the same
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:17.320]  agenda driven democrat sympathizers who are already under inspector general investigation the transition
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:24.360]  put out a statement that he essentially humiliated uh the cia no it's not the whole cia saying this
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:30.600]  and trump isn't impugning the whole cia when he says that this story is total bs these anonymous
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:36.920]  cia sources claim that russia hacked the rnc as well but only released negative information
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:44.760]  about the dnc yeah one problem with that the fbi investigated and found no evidence for it the rnc
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:53.240]  was not hacked the rnc was absolutely not hacked number one we had the fbi in the rnc we've been
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:59.080]  working with the fbi we've had intelligence experts here hang on no hang on shuck no no the
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:06.600]  rnc why you know it was not hacked the rnc offered conclusive proof to the new york times that they
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:12.600]  weren't hacked and the new york times ignored it so the intelligence is wrong it didn't happen
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:17.400]  we offered the new york times conclusive proof that it didn't happen they refused to look at that
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.840]  they ignored it because it didn't fit the narrative the fbi also investigated any russian links to
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:29.800]  donald trump and found none whatsoever you have zero evidence even the washington post admits that
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:36.520]  this is all inconclusive there's also zero evidence that the russians hacked john podesta's emails can
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:40.520]  you look right into the camera and say i know for a fact the government of latimer putin was behind
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:44.920]  the hacks of john podesta absolutely the government of latimer putin was behind the hacks of her
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:50.040]  institution and the dumping of information of john podesta's not only in the united states but also
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:55.000]  in europe okay you're not you know what you're done and tucker no look and say i know they did
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.320]  john podesta's emails they hacked them and i think that uh ronald rake will be rolling one last time
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:02.920]  congressman look in the camera and say they hacked john podesta's emails we know for a fact that
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:07.720]  putin's government did that you can't and you know you can't and you're hiding behind i i weasel
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:12.120]  words i i i just said that they hacked john podesta's russians i'm not going to be specific
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:17.320]  as oh because you don't know it that's why all right done one the left is now conspiring with
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:24.440]  rogue elements of the cia to initiate an internal coup within the united states and overthrow a
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:31.000]  democratically elected president let that sink in they're trying to manipulate electoral college
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.040]  members to not cast their votes for trump on december 19 top democrats are already saying
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:41.000]  that electors should reconsider their votes in light of this story they could also pressure
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.920]  members of the house and senate to object to the electoral vote on january 6 when a normally
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:52.920]  routine counting process could be turned into an anti-trump filibuster obama is demanding an
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:59.160]  official report be submitted on all this before january 20 the day of trumps inauguration who
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:06.120]  will be heading up that report james clapper the director of national intelligence who lied under
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:12.280]  oath in front of congress and the american people because he's really trustworthy right just like the
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:19.080]  cia or elements of it who suddenly became paragons of honesty after being bashed by the left for
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:24.760]  decades as liars and deceivers on an industrial scale yes the cia has a long history of lies and
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:29.240]  overthrowing democratic governments but that doesn't mean they're lying about trump yes the cia lied
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:35.240]  about everything else but this one thing i agree with them on so they must be right it was the left
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:41.960]  who screamed bloody murder about operation mockingbird a cia program to hijack the us media to
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:49.480]  spread cia propaganda now those same leftists are gleefully regurgitating cia propaganda as if it's
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:56.760]  gospel give me a break i can't believe we're seeing the same thing we saw post brexit calls for a
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:03.880]  second vote if the evidence is there i don't see any other way than to to vote again when will you
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:11.800]  people accept defeat now demented never trumpers like louise mensher calling for obama to bomb
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:18.600]  russia this is insane they're calling for obama to declare a state of emergency to cancel the
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:24.040]  election result and isn't it funny how all you democrats who cry over foreign influence had no
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:30.280]  objection whatsoever to saudi arabia bankrolling hillary's campaign you had no problem taking all
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:36.440]  that george soros money did you you had no problem with the obama state department overthrowing the
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:42.760]  government of ukraine you had no problem with obama interfering in the uk's referendum on
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:48.760]  leaving the u and to see the same prostitutes who prostrated themselves for hillary now trying to
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:54.600]  take the moral high ground is sickening now russia is being accused of spearheading a campaign to
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:43:00.920]  cost angela merkel the election in germany so either russia has suddenly launched a coordinated
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:07.000]  effort to sabotage western democratic elections or the unpopular leaders of those countries have
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:13.720]  suddenly launched a coordinated propaganda campaign to blame russia for absolutely everything to
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:21.400]  distract voters from their own failed policies which do you think is more likely to be true
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:35.240]  that is the truth about russia hacking the election that's up on youtube get it out the
[01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:39.960]  twin narratives of the mainstream media the russia hack story and the fake news story are
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:43.800]  completely collapsing and then we're going to go straight to the second video we're going to play
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:49.400]  out with this because this just went up on info wars dot com as of about an hour ago it's huge get
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:56.280]  it out it's called what they're not telling you about fake news here it is the epidemic of malicious
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:02.760]  fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year it's imperative
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:10.520]  that leaders in both the private sector and the public sector step up to protect our democracy
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:17.640]  and innocent lives so the woman who voted for a war that was sold on a diet of fake news a war
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:23.560]  that killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people is lecturing americans about fake news
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:29.880]  posing a threat to innocent people give me a break hillary you're the queen of fake news this
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:37.160]  isn't about politics or partisanship lives are at risk where was your concern for putting lives at
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:43.160]  risk when you pushed the fake news that rebels in libya and syria were moderate when they were
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:49.240]  bloodthirsty jihadists fake news that led to the deaths and displacement of hundreds of thousands
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:55.240]  of innocent people and the rise of isis where was your concern for the four innocent american
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:01.560]  lives lost in Benghazi when you pushed the fake news that a youtube video was to blame for the
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:09.480]  attack we've seen rage and violence directed at american embassies over an awful internet video
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:15.080]  when hillary's not pushing fake news to launch wars or cover-ups she's faking news about being
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:21.400]  under bosnian sniper fire to make herself look tough i remember landing under sniper fire
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:26.040]  there was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport but instead we just ran
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:32.840]  with our heads down to get into the vehicles uh to get to our base i you know i uh made a mistake
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:38.360]  in in describing it i she claimed she misspoke last week and was sleep deprived when she described
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:44.840]  landing under sniper fire in tuzla bosnia something that didn't happen but cbs news has found several
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:50.120]  times in the past few months when senator clinton used the bosnia trip to try to show her international
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:57.080]  experience december in iowa we landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:03.240]  said there might be sniper fire then in february the welcoming ceremony had to be moved inside
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:08.360]  because of sniper fire being lectured by hillary clinton about fake news is like being lectured
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:14.680]  by bill cosby about not raping women and the same goes for the mainstream media brian williams is
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:20.920]  now lecturing us about fake news brian frigging williams as we talked about here last night fake
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:27.240]  news played a role in this election and continues to find a wide audience two of our four helicopters
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:35.000]  were hit by ground fire including the one i was in i want to apologize i said i was traveling in
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:41.880]  an aircraft that was hit by rpg fire i was instead in a following aircraft i mean what's next is
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:47.640]  landstorm strong gonna start lecturing us about performance enhancing drugs your whole narrative
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:52.840]  is already collapsing the washington post was forced to admit that it couldn't vouch for the
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:58.840]  validity of its whole key russian propaganda blacklist the list that their entire story was
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:04.920]  based on a list that included even left wing websites that were critical of hillary clinton
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:10.520]  that's why they were included on the list this after the first fake news list they put out was
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:16.920]  discovered to be the brainchild of a far left social justice warrior feminist with a clear bias
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:22.920]  you're not fooling anybody it's obvious what you're trying to do you're pointing to opportunists
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:29.000]  who put out fake news to make money and then lumping them in with info wars bright bar zero
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:35.800]  hedge and everyone else to try and discredit us because we kicked your ass you lost the election
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:42.600]  not because of fake news but because your message failed to resonate with the american people
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:48.600]  and ours did and yes we may make mistakes from time to time we're not perfect the differences
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:54.920]  that when you deliberately put out fake news it leads to death and destruction on an industrial
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:48:01.560]  scale it's your fake news that puts lives at risk time and time again it was your fake news
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:07.880]  narrative about islamophobia that inspired the ohio state university terrorist to ram his car into
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:14.440]  and start slashing away at a dozen innocent people yet the media expressed a hundred times more
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:21.320]  moral panic about the pizza gate gunman who injured nobody it was your fake news narrative
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:27.960]  about hands up don't chew that led to violent riots and looting in ferguson we have dead cops
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:33.960]  because of that hands up don't shoot lie we had two in new york we also had five in dallas uh and
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:38.760]  some in baton roose louisiana people were trying to avenge for the life of mike brown who was a
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:44.280]  thought there are dead cops because of that fake news story out of ferguson missouri it was your
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:50.440]  fake news about a deceptively edited audio tape in the zimmerman case that fueled racial tensions
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:56.520]  across the country it was your fake news narrative about one in five women being raped on college
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:03.560]  campuses that led to numerous fake news stories about rapes on college campuses that never happened
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:09.480]  hopes is that ruined people's lives and this week police said they found no evidence to support
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:15.000]  what jackie told the magazine about being raped and assaulted it was your hysterical fake news
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:20.920]  narrative about donald trump being the next incarnation of hitler that fueled riots and violent
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:26.680]  attacks against trump supporters across the country there he goes again
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:39.800]  it was your fake news narrative about hillary clinton's victory being inevitable that made you
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:45.800]  look even more untrustworthy than you already were most of the prostitutes pushing this fake
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:52.040]  news narrative were the same ones caught in bed with the clinton campaign before the election
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:57.880]  the same ones who pushed the fake news narrative that the wiki leaks emails were fabricated or
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:02.280]  doctored i haven't spent a lot of time reading through wiki leaks emails but i will tell you
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:09.480]  this what we know is that many are not authentic total bs yet the mainstream media gave these
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:15.720]  prostitutes a platform to push this fake news narrative time and time again that was you
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:23.080]  you not macedonian teenagers or kremlin operatives that was you as the intercept reports this whole
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:29.320]  fake news bandwagon was actually launched by a hillary clinton supporter called marco shacon
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:35.400]  shacon specialized in creating blatantly fake anti-clinton frauds with the goal of tricking
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:40.440]  his opponents into citing them so that they would be discredited he was responsible for
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:46.680]  fabricating the bucket of losers quotes but these prostitutes were so eager to demonize trump
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:53.880]  that they started circulating chacon's fake news as evidence that the pedestrian emails were falsified
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:51:00.120]  so they're back on the alex jones show live don't go away reality check rampant hacking identity

[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:18.440]  he's been on before he is bill mitchell again he was derided by the mainstream media before
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:23.640]  the election with his certainty that trump would win with his certainty that the polls
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:28.920]  across the board were completely wrong so we're going to get bill mitchell host of your voice
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:34.600]  radio on to talk about this latest smear campaign by the mainstream media the russian hack the fake
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:40.680]  news all of it trumps pics whether he's actually draining the swamp or not look forward to hearing
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:44.520]  about that from bill mitchell before we get back into the news and by the way the video you heard
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:49.560]  before the break was what they're not telling you about fake news that just went up on youtube
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:55.640]  and it's on info wars dot com as of about an hour ago so get that share it that's a key video in
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:55:01.560]  dismantling one of these twin narratives that the mainstream media has pushed in recent weeks to try
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:06.360]  and delegitimize trumps presidency but before we get back into the news i want to tell you about
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:13.960]  the exciting new super blue fluoride free toothpaste available at infowarslife.com now this is very
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:20.200]  interesting because of course i've used fluoride free toothpaste for well over a decade now we know
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:28.280]  the debilitating health effects that it has in a cumulative fashion lowering iq all kinds of cancers
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:34.280]  linked to fluoride again this is our new super blue fluoride free toothpaste research across the
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:38.040]  board indicates that the health of your gums could contribute to the development of heart disease and
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:42.920]  heart attacks when bacteria infects your gums it could enter the bloodstream and attach the heart
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:48.520]  blood vessels causing blood clots or heart attacks and that's the key with this super blue
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:53.880]  toothpaste because it contains the natural oils and ingredients used in biblical times to help
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:56:01.240]  wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath without you losing iq points and that's key because
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:07.800]  a lot of these fluoride free toothpaste you will find they're very thin they don't produce enough foam
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:12.760]  so they don't actually work very well i mean you have to get a very specific one for it to be
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:19.160]  fluoride free and for it to work properly as a toothpaste so that's what we address with this
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:26.040]  all new super blue fluoride free toothpaste it is available at infowarslife.com it's got the iod and
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:32.280]  it's got the nano silver and of course it supports this network as we now come under the new attack
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:39.400]  of being russian agents working for vladimir putin they've resurrected the corpse of that narrative
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:46.440]  so again we're under massive sustained attack on a daily basis we need to grow our platform
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:53.880]  we need to hire new people we need new writers new reporters just so we can tackle the attacks on
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:57:00.520]  us on a daily basis alone we're out here in the wilderness we're not funded by dictatorships in
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:05.160]  the middle east we're not funded by globalists like george soros we're not funded by giant pharmaceutical

[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:33.640]  here now obama came out yesterday and we're going to play the clip after the break he gave an interview
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:39.400]  with the daily show trevor now again which is now more real than most fake news outlets i guess
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:46.840]  and he came out and said that the dnc emails which of course is what the big hysteria has been about
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:52.920]  over the past few days this is undermining our democracy russia has hacked our elections this
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:58:00.120]  is terrible well obama came out last night and said oh by the way those dnc emails they contained
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:08.760]  fairly routine stuff nothing explosive and were not very interesting so he's admitting that the
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:14.120]  supposedly bombshell information that the russians helped hack even though there's no evidence of that
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:20.200]  which we'll get on to that information which supposedly undermined the legitimacy of the election
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:25.800]  it was completely routine he said it was not interesting he said there was no explosive
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:31.400]  information in those emails well you can't have it both ways he's trying to maintain two false
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:35.960]  narratives at once we'll be back to talk about it on the alex jones show live don't go away

[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:56.600]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:59:56.600 --> 02:00:14.200]  live from austin texas broadcasting
[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:27.400]  in for alex jones for this hour again we've got bill michael coming up in the next segment
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:33.240]  but first we're going to go to this video this is president barack obama on the daily show with
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:40.440]  trevor Noah last night talking about the information that was leaked or hacked from the dnc
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:47.960]  hack let's go to this video what's happened to our political system where some emails that were
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:57.000]  hacked and released ended up being the overwhelming story and the constant source of coverage
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:04.840]  breathless coverage that was depicted as somehow uh damning in all sorts of ways when
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:14.200]  and the truth of the matter was it was um fairly routine stuff so there you have obama admitting
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:21.880]  counter to this narrative that this was the dastardly undermining of the u.s election system
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:29.400]  the very bedrock of democracy that russia was able to supposedly hack these emails from the dnc
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:35.800]  of course we know from what assange told us that russia was not the source of the leak the leak was
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:43.720]  an insider former ambassador craig murray met the individual who provided us with that leak he was
[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:49.320]  not russian but you see this is the problem that obama has he can't maintain two false narratives
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:55.800]  at once so on the one hand he has to lie and say that these emails contain no interesting information
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:02:01.480]  whatsoever of course they did the pedestal ones even more so but still if he claims that if he
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:06.680]  claims that there's nothing explosive that there's nothing of interest in these dnc emails it was
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:13.320]  quote fairly routine stuff then how did that influence the election this is the whole narrative
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:19.560]  right russia hacked the emails russia influenced the election this is a foreign power intervening
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:25.480]  in our affairs this is terrible but then obama comes out and says well this was nothing it was
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:32.360]  fairly routine stuff not very interesting information you can't have it both ways but they're trying to
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:39.720]  keep so many plates spinning at once that again they can't maintain every single false narrative
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:46.920]  now we had as i mentioned when i was on the show with alex earlier an individual college student
[02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:51.640]  walk into trump tower this is out of zero hedge college student arrested after carrying weapons
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:56.600]  into trump tower the 19-year-old college student was arrested after carrying a backpack full of
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:03:02.280]  weapons you're talking about fireworks a swiss army knife flashlight handcuffs they even talked about
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:10.200]  a grot used to strangle people that he was carrying around in this bag trying to get into trump tower
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:16.280]  when he was caught he told the police that this was completely routine and that he'd walked into
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:25.000]  trump tower 10 or so prior times with the same weapons he claims to be a fan of donald trump
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:33.080]  is that really believable given what we've talked about the mainstream media pushing this hysterical
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:39.880]  fake news narrative about donald trump being a danger to the world while of course simultaneously
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:46.200]  having moral panic over the pizza gate gunman who injured absolutely no one but saying that that could
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:52.680]  happen again that our quote fake news is going to radicalize violent people while actual would be
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:59.400]  assassins in the case of donald trump are acting upon the hysterical fake news propaganda that
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:05.640]  they've been fed by the mainstream media case in point michael sanford the british citizen who
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:12.840]  tried to assassinate trump at a trump rally in las vegas i think it was back in july you didn't
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:17.640]  really see much of that story in the mainstream media did you well now because it was their fake
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:24.280]  news narrative that was to blame for that you had the guy rushing the stage to try and physically
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:30.440]  assault trump several months before that we all remember that clip again far from being castigated
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:35.720]  imagine if the opposite had happened imagine if a trump supporter had tried to physically attack
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:42.360]  hillary clinton on stage while she was giving a speech imagine the free cow yet this guy was
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:48.440]  lionized he was given a platform by cnn and others despite again being radicalized by their
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:54.040]  fake news narrative absolutely amazing as a threat to trump continue we'll be back with bill
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:05:01.000]  mitchell after the break no go away the fraud in chief barack hussein obama went on the comedy
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:06.840]  central fake news program the daily show to talk to trevor nobody knows you about the alleged russian
[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:17.800]  hacking what they did here hacking some emails and releasing them is not a particularly fancy
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:23.480]  brand of espionage or propaganda here he stutters after his lie then never denies the legitimacy
[02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:31.000]  of the emails the emails are real the corruption is real so that the public and our elected
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:38.840]  representatives going forward can find ways to prevent this kind of interference from having an
[02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:42.840]  impact on the elections in the future these are the people that want the world government want
[02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:48.040]  foreign influence but now it is a problem when russia is allegedly hacking us officials to
[02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:52.920]  expose corruption isn't that what these people want a world government as a watchdog for corruption

[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:33.880]  wrong the polls that said hillary clinton was ahead by five six seven points in all these different
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:40.360]  states he was proven to be completely right he is bill mitchell host of your voice radio again

[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:52.680]  yourvoiceradio dot com bill welcome back to the show hi great to see you again how are you
[02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:58.680]  pretty good and we're going to get into the serious stuff in a little bit but i want to get your
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:06.280]  heart take on cany a west visiting trump tower this has thrown a lot of people for a loop do you
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:10.520]  think it's you know there's actually any substance in this meeting is it just about him performing at
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:17.160]  the inauguration or could it be as some people have suggested a kind of 3d chess move from trump
[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:23.640]  to distract the media from their obsession with russian hacking well you know i think
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:33.480]  that this is a sign or a side effect of uh trump being really the first post ideological president
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:38.200]  that i can remember having i mean you know most people go in with a preconceived notion
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:42.440]  that it's got to be you know this set of conservative ideals or this set of liberal ideals
[02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:47.880]  whereas trump is what i call a resultist he's focused on the end result his mind
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:55.160]  lives in the future and he he puts the pieces together so they fit into that picture that he's
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:59.320]  got and that's why sometimes these moves like Kanye West or something don't make sense to us
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:03.880]  linear thinkers because in the moment it's like what you know we don't get it but it makes sense
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:09.480]  whatever donald trump has gotten in his mind that make america great picture somehow kanya west
[02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:14.760]  fits into that and i think that kanya west just probably looks at donald trump says hey
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:19.560]  here's a sharp competent guy made a lot of money there's a lot of things about him that i admire
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:23.880]  and i'm gonna look past the fact that uh i'm not supposed to like republicans and go in and have a
[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:27.880]  sit down with this guy so i think it's great uh trump has shown us that he's willing to sit down
[02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:33.640]  and talk with uh pretty much anybody and i think that's great compared to obama's response during
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:37.560]  the healthcare debate where he told republicans needed to get in the back of the bus which was
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:44.680]  very unfortunate phrasing on his part but i think this is a good sign well i mean as a late great
[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:51.000]  andrew breitbart said politics is downstream from culture you know a lot of people don't get their news
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:56.120]  from the nightly news they don't get it from newspapers thank god they get it from celebrities
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:01.400]  they get it from entertainment news so again this can only be a positive step again i think
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:08.280]  trump is way ahead of any republican president to be before him in reaching out to people like
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:14.760]  kanya west of course twitter has reacted with complete revulsion the left is openly using
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:21.560]  racial slurs once again against kanya west because he met with trump proving once more that you know
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:28.680]  people of color who just even dare to express or even threaten to express a difference of opinion
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:34.520]  are immediately seized upon by the left once again proving the left is completely intolerant
[02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:40.680]  yeah absolutely well you know to the far left uh progressivism is the truth that is the ultimate
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:47.960]  truth and uh facts really have no meaning facts are only true to the progressives if they support
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:53.640]  progressivism if they don't if they're just completely made up things out of out of uh
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:58.040]  you know thin air but they support progressivism then they become true this is how to be these
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:02.760]  people can live with themselves this is how they can constantly lie to us and go to go to sleep and
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:07.160]  i go home to their families and not feel like bad people because they feel like they're serving
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:14.120]  the greater truth and then when kanya west goes from uh being a uh you know a democrat or a liberal
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:20.200]  or progressive champion and all of a sudden opens his mind to donald trump uh then kanya west is no
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:24.600]  longer part of the greater progressive truth and therefore he becomes a lie so that's the way
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:29.960]  they look at things it's they like to put people in baskets you know they talk about uh republicans
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:34.840]  profiling we're not the ones profiling it's the democrats it's the it's uh hillary clinton that
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:39.480]  talked about the basket of deplorables they're always wanting to put people in groups and you
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:43.320]  know donald trump looks at people as individuals he's like you know what i'm gonna give you the
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:49.080]  best playing field the best opportunity as an individual to prosper in this country i'm not
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:53.640]  guaranteeing you're gonna win but i'm gonna give you an opportunity to win if you're willing to
[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:59.880]  try hard and and do a good job and so this is a whole new way of looking at things and i think
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:04.280]  it's a big ten approach and i think it's attracting a lot of people that aren't you know wedded to the
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:09.560]  whole progressive idea exactly it's it's about you know not preaching to the choir there's been
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:15.560]  speculation of an informal outreach role for canya us we'll see what happens with that the
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:19.800]  media is freaking out about it of course as they do with absolutely everything that trump says or
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:24.760]  does let's move on let's move on to russia though because um we played the clip before the break
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:29.720]  obama gave an interview in with the daily show last night in which he said that the information
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:35.800]  revealed by the dnc league was quote fairly routine stuff he said it was not interesting he said there
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:42.280]  was uh no quote explosive content in those emails yet we have the flip side of the narrative which
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:49.480]  was that russia supposedly hacking this information completely undermined and influenced the election
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:55.240]  well you can't have it both ways obama but bill first your take on you know the regurgitation of
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:14:01.720]  this old russian hacking smear and uh obama's seeming flip flop that the dnc leaks contained
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:06.280]  routine stuff anyway so how could that have influenced the election it's actually you know
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:11.080]  it's funny but the the media keeps referring to our fake news you know hashtag fake news and i
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:17.160]  came up with a new hashtag on uh twitter yesterday baked news baked not fake and this is what the
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:22.040]  media does you know they they cook up these concoctions and it's just you know you just see
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:27.400]  these people around the table in a smoke filled room smoking cigars and it's like hey what if we
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:32.600]  try this well how about this you know and you know this whole russian thing didn't really become a
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:37.960]  story until it became clear the recounts were failing you know the recounts were a nothing burger
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:42.440]  and uh then they came up with this so it's just one thing after another they try things and try
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:47.880]  things and try things but they don't understand that donald trump is 10 steps ahead of them
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:51.560]  you know they're responding to what's happening right now they're thinking in the moment donald
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:57.960]  trump is is way way ahead and so that's why none of this stuff works as a matter of fact it's almost
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:03.720]  like the political theory of relativity that every action has an equal and opposite reaction and it
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:09.480]  seems like no matter what these people do to oppose trump it ends up benefiting him for instance
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:14.040]  the recounts okay the recounts ended up benefiting trump because it showed that there was no russian
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:18.520]  hacking you know the media could have run with the russian hacking thing of the of the vote
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:24.440]  in wish in michigan wisconsin in pennsylvania for trump's entire term but because they did the
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:30.280]  recount they're like no there's no there's no cheating so validated his win in those blue
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:35.400]  wall states so i mean this was meant to tear trump down and end up benefiting him and this russian
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:40.920]  thing does the same it does the same thing and so what democrats are really doing here is they're
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:47.240]  be clowning themselves by hooking on to whatever little butterfly flies by that looks like it might
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:52.760]  hurt trump and they're just making themselves look like fools for 2018 when they're at risk of losing
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:58.920]  a super majority of the republicans so you know this republic this russian story is not going to
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:04.040]  go anywhere it's not going to change any elector's minds like i said it's just it's just big news and
[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:11.080]  people are on to them now well i mean everybody freaks out about it and to some extent i think
[02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:15.880]  we should freak out just to counter their narrative i think that's what a lot of people did with the
[02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:21.240]  recount they thought this this could be uh this could be swayed this could be manipulated of
[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:27.320]  course it ended up with trump was ahead by over 500 votes in wisconsin after the recount the one
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:32.440]  in pennsylvania failed the one in michigan failed so as he said that failed the death threats to
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:38.360]  electoral members failed you know the riots have failed so this is just their latest play
[02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:43.160]  i think it's of concern given that you've got people like you know lindsay graham john mccain
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:48.600]  coming out now spinning this narrative which they're going to do over the next seven days of
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:54.360]  trying to pressure electoral members into changing their vote we've got 10 of them but only one
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:59.080]  republican demanding to see intelligence on this of course we know it doesn't exist it's completely
[02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:04.680]  trumped up the fbi says it's fuzzy and ambiguous uh the office of the director of national intelligence
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:10.920]  says it has a lack of evidence so do you think this is going to be successful in changing any
[02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:16.920]  members of the electoral college as we head towards this far on december 19th no not at all
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:21.080]  not at all i'll tell you why and this is you know over the last 100 years you've only the only uh
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:25.240]  you've only had the singleton electors that changed their vote and none of these had an
[02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:28.520]  effect on the outcome and they were just protest votes they did you know it was like oh i'm just
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:32.520]  one guy i can make a protest here it doesn't matter but what people need to realize is that
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:36.760]  these people that are chosen as electors tend to be real political junkies these are people very
[02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:41.960]  involved in political politics at the state level they want to have a future in politics okay
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:45.640]  and one of the most important things if you want to have a future in politics is your credibility
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:50.760]  your trustworthiness and if somebody becomes a faithless elector they are basically flushing
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:55.720]  their political future down the drain and for what you know it's not going to make a difference
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:18:00.680]  so what's going to happen is when it becomes clear when we get to the electoral uh college vote
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:04.520]  that there aren't 38 electors are going to flip because there won't be it's just impossible
[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:09.880]  there aren't going to be 38 electors nobody is going to flush their career their political career
[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:16.200]  down the toilet to make a political statement except for maybe this guy you know supran in
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:22.520]  texas who seems like a plant anyway because he's using um he's using a liberal think tank and a
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:27.240]  marketing firm to back him so uh you know i don't i don't think this guy was ever really republican
[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:31.960]  in the first place but yeah i just know i think this is going to go just like remember at the
[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:38.280]  convention we heard a week before the convention oh there were 28 30 40 delegates that were ready
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:44.680]  to flip on trump and it ended up being like two you know because when it comes to people can say
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:48.760]  they're going to do these things but it really comes down to it and there are really consequences
[02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:52.520]  and people are really saying yeah if i do this my career in politics is over because nobody will
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:57.640]  ever trust me again because you know most of these delegates even if it's legal for them to flip in
[02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:03.960]  their state they've signed pledges that they will vote for the republic for the winner right so
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:08.760]  yeah i mean their credibility is is gone you might as well just you know erase their entire
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:14.120]  resumes and put big fat liar on there you know so it's it's i don't think there's any concern at
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:21.720]  all i think this is once again much to do about nothing uh you know uh it's a uh tale uh told by
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:29.160]  a full full full sound and fury signifying nothing and i think that's what's gonna turn out i agree i
[02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:35.160]  mean you've got michael more going on you know nightly shoes uh nightly shows sorry again trying
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:40.040]  to fan the flames of hysteria i think that's what it is they're trying to create this hysterical
[02:19:40.040 --> 02:19:44.600]  attitude amongst people that you know the russian hack thing is devastating it's going to undermine
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:49.240]  everything they're trying to intimidate force people into changing their votes it hasn't worked
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:53.880]  with their other plays it's not going to work again we'll be back with bill mitchell on the alex

[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:05.160]  let's talk about a little bit of hysteria on the right because right there's been a lot of what I
[02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:12.680]  call flouncing on the right over trumps you know rhetoric his appointments we've had people who
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:18.920]  support a trumpford you know the best part of 18 months suddenly vowing to withdraw their support
[02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:23.560]  because they have a knee jerk reaction to something they don't like i mean you've called a lot of
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:29.160]  these people out on twitter these people who supported trump who flip out anything he does
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:33.640]  that they don't like and say i refuse to support him anymore before he even gets in an office what
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:40.440]  would your message to those people yeah we we elected let me put it this way we elected
[02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:47.720]  donald trump for his judgment and his instincts okay and if these appointments mean that he has
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:54.040]  bad judgment and bad instincts that individual appointment will be the least of our problems
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:59.240]  okay we're completely at donald trump has got bad judgment and bad instincts we are completely
[02:26:59.240 --> 02:27:08.040]  utterly screwed okay but he doesn't he has great judgment he has great instincts so trust the fact
[02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:13.800]  that when he is considering these various people he has more information than you do you know sometimes
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:18.520]  when people say no to something actually whenever somebody says no to something there's one or two
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:22.040]  things happening either they really don't want to do it or they don't have enough information
[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:26.920]  to say yes and in these cases donald trump has got more information about these people
[02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:34.120]  than you do in addition he is looking at each of these people in his cabinet not as an individual
[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:40.360]  piece that has to stand on its own but as part of a larger picture that will all work together
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:46.680]  he's hiring hiring very highly competent sharp people that can hit the ground running and get
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:53.480]  remember these words get results this is going to be a new type of republican administration
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:58.840]  this isn't going to be a stamp your feet wave your arms we'll get them next time administration
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:04.680]  this is going to be your results now administration and so he's hired people that have got a track
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:10.200]  record of results and this is why even when he was considering mit romney as secretary of state
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:14.200]  i said on twitter i said well you know if you fix mit romney i'll back the pic because i trust the
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:18.840]  man's judgment but i don't think he will because mit romney does not have at least over the last
[02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:23.240]  decade or so a track record of winning you know this is not a guy that wins and trump
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:29.080]  wants people that have got a track record of winning and succeeding and i think that that's
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:34.520]  one of the things that he's he's looking for in these cabinet picks so and he's got a broad spectrum
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:39.960]  of folks i think i think this may be the wealthiest cabinet we've ever had in history and these people
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:45.800]  are walking away from very very lucrative jobs to serve america in these roles so i'm excited
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:51.160]  about it i mean it's i think it's going to be wonderful and this is why i recommend to folks
[02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:56.280]  listen if he makes a cabinet pick you don't like just you know i mean say go out there and say yeah
[02:28:56.280 --> 02:29:00.040]  mr trump i don't like this kind of big good on twitter and say i don't care for this we're telling
[02:29:00.040 --> 02:29:06.360]  but don't get yourselves in the trap of doubting trump himself because what'll happen is you'll find
[02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:10.040]  out that cabinet pick was great or that he didn't make it at all and you'll end up having to walk

[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:39.000]  one of the things that let's let's go to break just hold that thought let's hit the next break

[02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:31.160]  dot com now before the break bill we were getting into this again this flouncing on the right we
[02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:35.560]  saw it with mitt romney even though he wasn't selected in the end which you know proves that
[02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:41.880]  trump listened to his base but even the suggestion of it caused many people to just completely flip
[02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:47.880]  out say they were abandoning the entire trump train altogether before he even gets into office
[02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:52.360]  just finished the thought you were making before the break though it's crazy because
[02:33:52.360 --> 02:33:55.400]  and my response to these people and some of these people were big name people i don't mind
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:59.960]  going up against big name people if i you know disagree with them and you know my response is
[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:03.800]  so what exactly are you going to do for the next four years just sit in the corner and
[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:07.640]  you know cry and eat potato chips as while we make america great again i mean come on
[02:34:08.360 --> 02:34:13.480]  you know this is this presidency is bigger than just one cabinet position you know it's
[02:34:13.480 --> 02:34:21.400]  bigger than just one policy this is an entire uh sea change in the way america does business don't
[02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:26.040]  miss out on this because you know as you use the expression for you got butt hurt over one
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:31.960]  position you just agree with because remember we elected donald trump president we didn't elect
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:38.680]  whoever is having this problem you know this pundit president so it's not up to donald trump to
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:44.280]  do what they say it's up to donald trump to use his judgment to do what he thinks he should do
[02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:50.840]  to lead this country and fortunately he's surrounded himself by absolutely brilliant people you know
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:54.840]  donald trump has got so many good people around him good so many good operational people around
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:34:59.960]  him that it will free him up to travel the globe you know selling the american brand
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:08.120]  uh being the face being the face of this new make america great again uh message that we're
[02:35:08.120 --> 02:35:12.040]  putting out there and i think that's what he wants to do he's a marketing guy he wants to brand he
[02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:16.280]  wants to market he wants to be out there so he's got enough operational people around him where he
[02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:21.960]  doesn't have to get too tied up in the day-to-day minutiae of what's going on he's got pence he's
[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:28.120]  got all these other great people at in a very high level so i'm excited about it and you know
[02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:32.120]  i think this is buying him some insurance with the electoral college because he's done such a
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:36.120]  competent job that even people that may have doubted him before were like well you know
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:43.880]  he seems like he's doing okay and also the carrier thing to me the carrier condition thing was like
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:48.920]  when ronald reagan fired the air traffic controllers you know people forget i was around back then
[02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:52.440]  that uh when ronald reagan first talked off of us he wasn't doing very well at the beginning
[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:56.600]  you know he was being treated kind of badly and then you know he always just some movie star you
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:01.000]  know be a b movie star and now he's present and then when the air traffic controllers went on
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:05.240]  strike he went in there and said oh really going on strike your fire you know and everybody's and
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:10.280]  they were like oh no no no we want to negotiate oh no you're fired and all of a sudden you know he
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:16.040]  earned his his you know badastry credentials he earned his tough guy credentials and from then
[02:36:16.040 --> 02:36:20.280]  and people always said you know if he says he's gonna do something he's gonna do it and i think
[02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:23.880]  donald trump earned a lot of goodwill with that carrier move even though it was just a thousand
[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:28.360]  jobs you know it learned a lot of goodwill so i think those things are going to protect him
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:32.600]  in the electoral college because uh really it comes down to the will of the people and i think
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:37.160]  the will of the people is behind him right now uh one last thing you know investor confidence
[02:36:37.160 --> 02:36:43.000]  off the charts right now they just had a new uh poll of small business confidence off the charts
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:47.400]  right now i mean people are excited about this presidency and we're not going to have a couple
[02:36:47.400 --> 02:36:51.400]  turncoats out there turn this around so i'm not worried about the electrical college electoral
[02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:58.840]  sorry college at all no i mean the point is he's not in office he's laid out this 100 day contract
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:04.920]  with the american people at least give him a hundred days i mean throwing the baby out with
[02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:10.520]  the bathwater i've seen it so many times especially on twitter but i will get to this and this i think
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:16.520]  is you know it's more of the legitimate criticism that's been leveled by some um mit romney's out
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:23.320]  you know trump listened to his bass that's great but now we have rex tillerson x on mobile ceo he's
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:29.560]  the secretary of state you got steven manukin x goldman sacks you know this charge has been made
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:34.760]  i want to get your response to it how can trump be draining the swamp while recruiting what many
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:42.280]  would consider establishment insiders like tillerson and manukin well you know i i compare it to uh
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:46.520]  you know ancient man had a problem with wolves you know wolves would attack and eat them they
[02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:50.760]  attack and eat the the sheep and they could have just killed all the wolves but uh you know and they
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:58.280]  killed some but some they turned into uh you know man's best friend and this is what happens when
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:02.440]  you drain the swamp too with some of the alligators you got i killed but some of them you know you
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:07.240]  can uh you can train to work for you and i think that that is one of the things that donald trump
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:13.480]  is doing is he's you know i think abraham lincoln said do i not defeat my enemies when i make them
[02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:17.880]  my friends and i think that that's what he's doing as he's taking people that have got skills
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:24.840]  and he's he's showing them that his leadership is the way this is one thing that a great negotiator
[02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:31.400]  does a great negotiator shows their opponent that it is in their own best interest to follow
[02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:36.680]  their leadership you know this is this is much better because the alternative to what trump is
[02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:42.440]  doing would be to have an insurgency with all these people attacking him and blocking his agenda
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:46.200]  you know if these people if he feels like he can trust these people and they've got the right skill
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:52.840]  sets then much better to have them on trump's team with a changed attitude a changed idea you know
[02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:58.600]  entire governments and countries have been formed just on an idea america was formed on an idea and
[02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:03.800]  if they believe in donald trump's idea for america you can take somebody who is formerly an enemy
[02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:09.160]  and turn them into a great asset and i think that's what he's uh doing and the fact that these are
[02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:13.640]  our big-time power players awesome you know one of the best things about a power player is their
[02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:20.200]  their uh you know rolodex the people they know they have the contacts to get things done to cut
[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:25.880]  through the red tape they've got the friendships the relationships so uh yeah i'm i'm excited i'm
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:29.320]  very excited and uh you know let's give him a hundred days even if you know you don't like a
[02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:34.280]  particular pick like i said say something about it donald trump uh double blind test you know he
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:39.720]  puts ideas out there he wants to hear back from people to uh i'm sorry um he wants to hear back
[02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:45.560]  from people to uh see what they think so that's good but don't don't uh you know jump off the
[02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:48.920]  trump train over because you're just gonna end up looking foolish because you're gonna get back on
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:55.000]  when you see all the good stuff happening so just uh try to remain uh faithful you know have
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:40:00.840]  uh has some belief in the guy you elected him remember why you elected him and uh you know
[02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:05.480]  just let's be unified this this is the one thing the media is trying to do and the democrats are
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:10.440]  trying to do is break our unity so if we can maintain our unity we have really defeated their
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:15.800]  entire purpose that's their last best chance is to defeat us they can't defeat us from the outside
[02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:20.600]  they tried they can only defeat us from the inside so if we remain strong and united inside even if
[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:26.520]  you have a doubt here or there you know i mean face it after eight years of getting zero percent of
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:31.720]  what i want i'm perfectly happy getting 80 percent of what i want from a president and there's a few
[02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:36.280]  things that trump does that i disagree with whatever i'm getting 80 percent of what i want
[02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:42.760]  and i'm ecstatic now i want to move on to fake news because of course we've had this stunning
[02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:47.400]  lack of self-awareness amongst the media they were caught in bed with the clinton campaign
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:52.280]  they were caught in their complicity they were caught poshing fake news fake narratives the
[02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:58.760]  entire election cycle you know hillary clinton 98 percent inevitable to become president
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:04.120]  they're already crumbling trust that the american people had in them collapsed even further their
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:11.480]  first reaction was not self-analysis was not to look in the mirror it was to lash out at everybody
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:17.320]  else accused them of being fake news of course there is actual fake news there are websites
[02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:23.720]  that put out completely uh concocted headlines to make advertising dollars that is separate
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:28.920]  from having a different opinion from having dissident true news like you know in four wars
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:34.520]  bright bought zero hedge whoever you want to mention obviously it was an attempt to sense
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:39.640]  to censor us right this is this is their attempt to put teeth into what's going through congress
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:45.720]  right now with the the banning the russian propaganda and what's happening happening in silicon valley
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:53.640]  with facebook and twitter now adopting uh this fake news list the two that have been released so far
[02:41:53.640 --> 02:41:59.880]  the first one was cooked up by a far left feminist professor that was adopted wholesale
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:06.040]  before we exposed it the second list has been completely debunked as coming out of a neocon
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:11.720]  organization again completely shadowy the washington post had to back away said they couldn't vouch
[02:42:11.720 --> 02:42:16.920]  for the validity of it yeah we've got hillary clinton coming out and saying this is going to
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:23.720]  cause innocent people to be killed isn't that rich bill given that she blamed innocent people being
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:30.760]  killed in bangarzi on a youtube video which was in and of itself the biggest act of fake news you
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:38.280]  could ever wish to imagine it's incredible you know it's amazing uh to sit here and watch the left
[02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:43.320]  self-immolate you know and uh basically pour the can of gas on their heads and light themselves on
[02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:49.000]  fire on a daily basis you know just like we almost don't even need to criticize them anymore and you
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:55.160]  know uh obama talked about shovel ready jobs well he finally came through with uh shovel ready jobs
[02:42:55.160 --> 02:42:59.640]  and that's the dnc because they've got a big ol shovel and they are just digging and digging
[02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:05.000]  and digging and they're trying to position themselves to win back congress in 2018 but
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:10.360]  it's just going to have the opposite effect they're they're making clowns of themselves and this is
[02:43:10.360 --> 02:43:15.800]  you know the reason why hillary clinton lost is historically yeah there's a lot of reasons
[02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:20.360]  historically it would have been almost impossible for her to basically earn a third term for for uh
[02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:25.160]  obama over the last six times that there's been an opportunity for that it's only worked once and
[02:43:25.160 --> 02:43:30.280]  that was with reagan and he was a very popular when he was reelected so you know the fact that
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:34.680]  obama was uh one reelection with fewer votes and he was originally elected i'm historically
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:40.360]  would have been almost impossible for hillary to win this election but uh you know it's just the
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:47.000]  problem they have is their entire philosophy the progressive philosophy is broken they tried it
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:54.200]  you know dr obama cured us of liberalism as a country by implementing it fully you know he
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:58.360]  really exposed it for what it was and people were like we don't like this you know it sounds great
[02:43:58.360 --> 02:44:03.480]  when you give great speeches but when you do it it kind of is awful and so they you know people
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:08.920]  want results people want to be special people americans want to think of themselves is a big deal
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:13.000]  we want to think of ourselves as special we want to think of ourselves as the lighthouse
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:18.520]  on the hill we don't want to be average we don't want to be bowing to other leaders of other countries
[02:44:18.520 --> 02:44:24.360]  you know and this is this is what trump is tied into they say that your personal happiness is a
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:29.080]  measure of what your life is like compared to what you expect to be like well americans expect
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:33.960]  themselves to be special and when we don't feel special we're unhappy you know this this is why
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:38.760]  73 of americans in a poll before the election were unhappy with the direction of the country because
[02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:43.800]  america wasn't making them feel like they want to feel and this is what's exciting about trump
[02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:50.040]  especially once we start to get some results is the trump is going to make us feel how as americans
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:56.040]  we want to feel and that's self actualization and when people achieve self actualization and
[02:44:56.040 --> 02:45:01.000]  tie it to an individual they defend them because that individual sort of becomes them becomes their
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:06.360]  voice and that's what trump said i am your voice so yeah this is a very powerful thing that democrats
[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:09.880]  are up against i don't know what they're gonna do honestly i i think they're basically just done
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:17.080]  you know i mean do you think i mean of course they trump had the temerity to say america first
[02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:22.200]  doesn't he would put americans interest first god forbid that completely triggered the mainstream
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:26.280]  media in the left but yeah that's that's what i was thinking about i mean what is the left
[02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:32.120]  gonna do are they gonna have to come back with their next move and kind kind of rebrand themselves
[02:45:32.120 --> 02:45:37.480]  as a populist movement this kind of bernie sanders brand is that even going to work do they
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:42.600]  have the setup to accomplish that i mean is that the only direction in which they can go now
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:49.880]  they have they have their only reaction will be to go further left this is the only thing this is
[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:54.520]  the only thing that's the only life raft they've got and the problem is they've got no bench now
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:58.840]  you know people don't talk much about the local government and state governments but we control
[02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:05.800]  i think uh almost 75 percent of state legislators now legislatures now that's the bench where you
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:10.680]  develop that's the minor leagues where you develop your national leaders democrats don't have anything
[02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:15.960]  they've got nobody you know the average age of the congressional leadership is in the mid 70s
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:22.520]  they're literally dying out and they have nobody to come in and replace them no future stars there
[02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:28.120]  is no you know barack obama part two coming up in the party and they're in trouble i think the
[02:46:28.120 --> 02:46:33.800]  average age of republican leadership now it's like 45 or 50 years old it's just crazy so here's the
[02:46:33.800 --> 02:46:40.520]  ultimate irony is that the republican party has become the the party of youth who would have
[02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:45.720]  figured that right but it has you know and we're winning millennials over i mean i've got a i've
[02:46:45.720 --> 02:46:53.560]  got a millennial dj from from uh new jersey that is one of my co-hosts on thursday night great guy
[02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:58.840]  i've had other uh guest hosts they're millennials i mean people are tired of living in their parents
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:03.320]  basement you know they're tired of getting out of college and not being able to pay their uh their
[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:09.320]  bills and their loans people want to win and it's just you know with donald trump it's not just an
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:15.480]  idea it's not just a philosophy but they actually see an opportunity that okay maybe i can actually
[02:47:15.480 --> 02:47:21.560]  win here and that starts to catch on so i just i don't know what the democrats are gonna do
[02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:25.960]  and you know one of the big pushes of of trump is going to be urban renewal and i keep referring
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:30.920]  to that as the last blue wall okay we broke down the blue wall in the rust belt wisconsin
[02:47:30.920 --> 02:47:35.800]  michigan and pennsylvania inner cities are the last blue wall and if we can give those people
[02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:41.480]  real hope i mean hope that's based on action and change and a real sense of future and better
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:47.240]  education and a better place to live clearing you know i work with uh bill polti and he's clearing
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:51.560]  out neighborhoods uh he's got the blight authority which is going into neighborhoods and clearing i
[02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:57.480]  think cleared out like 10 or 20 blocks city blocks in detroit recently you know this is going to be
[02:47:57.480 --> 02:48:02.440]  their last stronghold and we're going right for the heart of it you know and not by some political
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:08.360]  game or some speech but by you know solving these people's problems so i just i'm excited and i
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:13.320]  feel sorry for those guys for the democrats no exactly i mean it's it's about going into these
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:18.840]  communities and giving them some hope i mean what was hillary offering them the same old story
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:23.880]  stuck in the ghetto dependent on government what kind of hope does that give to anybody
[02:48:23.880 --> 02:48:28.520]  so yeah and you've got the other fact to which of course is you know trump felt like a form of
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:34.840]  rebellion conservatism is now the new counterculture when every facet of the establishment is lined up
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:39.400]  against something then that's something becomes the new counterculture and that's why you said
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:44.440]  you know a lot of young people are coming on board now um the flip side is we had a poll today
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:50.520]  only 13 percent of democrats are enthusiastic about their party's future so they're in big trouble
[02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:55.080]  final couple of minutes in this segment now i just want to get into twitter and we've seen a lot of
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:59.880]  pro trump accounts banned by twitter recently you've been criticized i've been criticized by
[02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:06.440]  elements of the alt right for suggesting that it's not exactly a smart idea to constantly be fighting
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:11.320]  with twitter's policies just speak to that because i know you've tweeted about it recently
[02:49:11.880 --> 02:49:17.320]  yeah i mean i've talked to jack the ceo you know and i said i said uh you know jack listen i know
[02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:21.640]  your politics are different than mine but i just want to say thanks for giving me this platform
[02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:25.400]  i mean you could have cut me off at any moment i've been a big voice for trump in this election i
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:29.480]  think i've made a difference in this election you could have cut me off anytime you didn't
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:34.840]  you know you let me be on there and uh i just appreciate it you know my philosophy is you know
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:41.880]  never complain about the the cook's uh uh cooking when you're still eating you know and here's the
[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:48.280]  thing folks you know uh twitter is free you know it's their house they don't have to they don't
[02:49:48.280 --> 02:49:52.600]  have to do anything for you okay it's not like they're controlled by the government they have to
[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:57.080]  offer you this and they have to offer you that they make their own rules so don't poke them in the
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:01.320]  eye you know if you want to go after the democrats go after the democrats if you want to go after
[02:50:01.320 --> 02:50:06.760]  hillary go after hillary but you know don't be slamming twitter on twitter it's just stupid
[02:50:06.760 --> 02:50:11.960]  i mean come on use your noodle right if you want to complain about over and complain about
[02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:16.520]  them on facebook don't complain on twitter go ahead yeah sorry i think where it crosses the
[02:50:16.520 --> 02:50:20.840]  line is what we've seen in europe where twitter and facebook are teaming up with governments to
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:26.760]  then hunt down people and give them home visits from the police for making you know comments
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:31.000]  critical of migrant policies so i think that's when it crosses crosses the line when they
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:35.080]  characterize legitimate dissent as hate speech and then work with the government
[02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:40.440]  to oppress people but you know that's slightly different from uh twitter's own internal policies
[02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:45.240]  but we'll be back with the final segment with bill mitchell this is the alex jump show live

[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:22.120]  final minute here of the alex joneshow let's hit a couple of news headlines
[02:57:22.120 --> 02:57:29.800]  merkel's party says putin would like to see her fall in 2017 well what do you know now angela merkel
[02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:36.680]  is blaming vladimir putin for her cratering popularity numbers of course it has nothing
[02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:41.560]  whatsoever to do with the fact that she's brought in over a million muslim migrants over the past
[02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:47.720]  year that her policies are completely failing that germans are afraid to go out in the streets
[02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:53.560]  that they have terrorists being caught every week now in major german cities no nothing to do with
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:59.000]  that that's not why angela merkel's popularity is plummeting it's because of vladimir putin
[02:57:59.720 --> 02:58:04.200]  again they haven't even had the election the election's not for three months and they're
[02:58:04.200 --> 02:58:11.400]  already getting in their excuses ahead of time with angela merkel now blaming vladimir putin
[02:58:11.400 --> 02:58:16.280]  we've got other stories the fbi says the cia's russian hacking assessment uh is basically
[02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:22.120]  fluff we have another intel agency saying the same thing these twin narratives of fake news
[02:58:22.120 --> 02:58:28.760]  and russian hacking are collapsing within 48 72 hours of the mainstream media putting them out
[02:58:28.760 --> 02:58:34.440]  we are winning they will be defeated stay tuned for the fourth hour of the alex joneshow breaking
[02:58:34.440 --> 02:58:48.440]  news at info wars dot com this is gcn the genesis communications radio network we have the new
[02:58:48.440 --> 02:58:54.120]  product at info wars life dot com bio true selenium we've had so many requests over the years for
[02:58:54.120 --> 02:59:01.560]  selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from
[02:59:01.560 --> 02:59:06.840]  mustard seed extract when you take selenium in the body it actually benefits the detoxification
[02:59:06.840 --> 02:59:13.000]  systems in your body it helps balance the thyroid gland it helps detoxify selenium is another one
[02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:18.440]  of those absolute must-haves the highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland but it's
[02:59:18.440 --> 02:59:24.360]  actually used all over the body as a matter of fact there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[02:59:24.360 --> 02:59:31.560]  dependent upon selenium so it really is a all around nutrient that everybody really needs i'm

[03:00:10.200 --> 03:00:17.800]  the world is a dangerous place not because of evil but because of those who look on and do nothing
[03:00:18.680 --> 03:00:25.560]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance we now take you live to the central
[03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:35.800]  texas command center it's alex jones and welcome back to the alex jones show you have now entered
[03:00:35.800 --> 03:00:42.520]  overdrive i am leon macadoo taking the wheel owen shroyer here riding shotgun we have got a jam packed
[03:00:42.520 --> 03:00:47.000]  show for you today i mean we want to kind of dig down into this of course what the heck is going on
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:51.560]  with these intelligence agencies talk about a coup it seems like they're all kind of fighting with
[03:00:51.560 --> 03:00:57.080]  each other bringing up of course the fact these are the same intelligence agencies that told us
[03:00:57.080 --> 03:01:01.080]  there was weapons of mass destruction in iraq they're now telling us of course russia hacked
[03:01:01.080 --> 03:01:05.160]  into our elections and we should just go ahead and start world war three without getting to the
[03:01:05.160 --> 03:01:10.840]  bottom of things or without demanding proof of these conspiracy theories that are going around
[03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:16.040]  so we'll talk about that and of course the confusion we want to talk about obama of course
[03:01:16.040 --> 03:01:22.360]  blaming um anything he possibly can fake news putin racism just not the fact that he was an
[03:01:22.360 --> 03:01:26.680]  awful president uh we're not going to talk about that we'll get into a little bit about
[03:01:26.680 --> 03:01:33.160]  self-driving cars how uber has uh its employees have been using some of its technology to stock
[03:01:33.160 --> 03:01:40.120]  celebrities politicians and uh their x's of course but we were assured they weren't spying on any of
[03:01:40.120 --> 03:01:47.480]  us years ago um and then of course here's a good story this one i believe comes out of bloomberg
[03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:53.480]  scientists want to give the atmosphere an ant an antacid to relieve climate change and here the
[03:01:53.480 --> 03:01:59.000]  subheadline says it won't solve the underlying problem but geoengineering may have just gotten
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:04.520]  a bit safer so we're going to get into that because right here bloomberg not only did they
[03:02:04.520 --> 03:02:09.720]  just admit that uh geoengineering does exist and that it's happening but that it might not
[03:02:09.720 --> 03:02:15.480]  be that safe oh and fake news man fake news well i love this story i actually had this we didn't
[03:02:15.480 --> 03:02:20.120]  we didn't uh coordinate all of our stories coming on but i had that story in front of me too and i
[03:02:20.120 --> 03:02:27.320]  always love this when you talk about geoengineering and climate change okay so i'm supposed to believe
[03:02:27.320 --> 03:02:32.840]  in anthro progenic climate change right i mean it's human behavior that is affecting climate
[03:02:32.840 --> 03:02:40.600]  change but i'm supposed to ignore the human behavior that is geoengineering when discussing
[03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:46.040]  climate change it's the most hypocritical backwards type of thinking i've ever heard of
[03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:50.520]  but it'll be interesting to see what how they respond to this considering you know again just
[03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:54.680]  another example of them putting it right in front of our face well and that it doesn't exist and
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:03:00.520]  that's the thing that makes me so frustrated about it is that you're seeing these trails being made
[03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:04.760]  in the sky they're not your typical contrails that an airplane will make but yet they're
[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:09.080]  they're fake new totally gaslighting us we see it with our own eyes people have taken pictures
[03:03:09.080 --> 03:03:14.280]  and videos they've collected the stuff that's falling down from the sky and yet still it's fake
[03:03:14.280 --> 03:03:18.840]  news it doesn't exist everyone just yeah there's the image right there that's normal you're all
[03:03:18.840 --> 03:03:23.640]  going crazy you're all yeah no wonder the world is in such a state because we're being massively
[03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:29.720]  lied to on a huge scale by the mainstream media who has now tried to hijack this cia talking point
[03:03:29.720 --> 03:03:34.040]  that everything they don't agree with is fake news so we're going to get into that a little bit more
[03:03:34.040 --> 03:03:40.440]  because of course trump has ruffled some feathers with his epa pic but i want to end this segment
[03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:46.280]  before we go to break on this story that was kind of near and dear to my heart and guys if you can
[03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:52.440]  pull up my twitter page i actually pulled a piece from the wonder woman the creator of wonder woman
[03:03:52.440 --> 03:03:58.760]  and why he created wonder woman because he wanted to give young girls a powerful role model who also
[03:03:58.760 --> 03:04:03.640]  embodied feminine qualities because you know young girls weren't wanting to be feminine because they
[03:04:03.640 --> 03:04:11.640]  weren't tough they needed someone that could match superman well now the un has decided to end wonder
[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:18.200]  woman's role as an honorary ambassador because she's attractive and she's white and this made
[03:04:18.200 --> 03:04:23.880]  too many people upset they had planned to use wonder woman in an honorary role in an empowerment
[03:04:23.880 --> 03:04:29.160]  campaign to fight for gender equality prompted it prompted criticism that the choice sent the
[03:04:29.160 --> 03:04:35.640]  wrong messages because wonder woman is too white she's too attractive her boobs are too big too
[03:04:35.640 --> 03:04:43.240]  physically fit she's not a good she doesn't even exist what this is a this is a fictional character
[03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:48.360]  she's she's too upsetting too many people are triggered all right we'll stick around we'll talk
[03:04:48.360 --> 03:04:56.040]  about that and so much more right after this
[03:04:57.400 --> 03:05:02.760]  well well well bill gates is back in the news and no it's not about pushing more toxic vaccines on
[03:05:02.760 --> 03:05:07.880]  the third world for population control and he's not releasing a new bug-filled os no bill gates
[03:05:07.880 --> 03:05:15.400]  is now going to release a new fund to tackle climate change and the new fund is called breakthrough
[03:05:15.400 --> 03:05:21.160]  energy ventures the fund will consider investing in electricity generation storage transportation
[03:05:21.160 --> 03:05:26.040]  agriculture and energy system efficiency seed money for startups and projects ready for commercialization
[03:05:26.040 --> 03:05:31.160]  among other efforts will be considered bill loves investing in green energy in fact bill gates has
[03:05:31.160 --> 03:05:36.040]  backed a string of clean energy products including the nuclear reactor startup terra power which after
[03:05:36.040 --> 03:05:40.360]  eight years hasn't even built a working prototype so mr gates and his super friends are going to
[03:05:40.360 --> 03:05:45.160]  see this investment firm with a billion dollars but i don't think he consulted mit who did a
[03:05:45.160 --> 03:05:49.720]  study that found venture capital investors lost over half of the 25 billion they plowed into the

[03:08:32.120 --> 03:08:38.520]  um just this massive pushback to label everything is fake news with what the government disagrees
[03:08:38.520 --> 03:08:43.640]  with the establishment media the corporate media whatever you want to call them and now we've got
[03:08:43.640 --> 03:08:48.200]  the president coming out saying this as well paul joseph watson alluded to the fact that angola
[03:08:48.200 --> 03:08:53.720]  merkel of course a total failed leader there in germany the election is months away and she's
[03:08:53.720 --> 03:09:00.120]  already ramping up this idea that putin is going to involve himself in their election
[03:09:00.760 --> 03:09:07.000]  merkel's party says putin would like to see her fall in 2017 oh that rascal putin he's just trying
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:12.440]  to take everybody down they're like it's like they're building unintentionally building vladimir
[03:09:12.440 --> 03:09:18.840]  putin up as like the greatest destroyer yeah like the biggest threat to the globalist the biggest
[03:09:18.840 --> 03:09:23.400]  threat to the liberal establishment right now and he's just sitting over here in russia just
[03:09:23.400 --> 03:09:26.920]  kind of like minding to know that his own business like trying to figure out you know how he can help
[03:09:26.920 --> 03:09:31.800]  russia and he's kind of looking around like but i fixed the us election but i'm fixing the german
[03:09:31.800 --> 03:09:36.760]  election wow this is a bunch of bullcrap who knew those memes going around where he was like
[03:09:36.760 --> 03:09:42.920]  topless on his horse or like wrestling a bear and everything i mean the memes really built him up
[03:09:42.920 --> 03:09:49.000]  it's about as real as wonder woman exactly that's a ridiculous story so there here's a story coming
[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:56.440]  out of the washington examiner the press is being encouraged to turn up the heat on trump so
[03:09:57.960 --> 03:10:02.200]  they're they're really trying to cheer on these reporters to say it's time to challenge
[03:10:02.200 --> 03:10:08.680]  president elect trump and his team as if they haven't been doing that for the entire time since
[03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:14.680]  2015 since he announced he was going to run since he made it clear that he was the gloves were off
[03:10:14.680 --> 03:10:19.080]  and he wasn't going to hold back he wasn't going to play their nice little games and he calls the
[03:10:19.080 --> 03:10:24.280]  press out for how they are and they're biased and so then they've been attacking him the entire time
[03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:32.600]  anything he does any of his trends his picks staff picks for his top positions everything so now all
[03:10:32.600 --> 03:10:39.240]  of a sudden the trump the press is saying we should do our job we should go ahead and check the
[03:10:39.240 --> 03:10:43.240]  people who are in power because of course these wiki leaks that we're not supposed to look at
[03:10:43.240 --> 03:10:47.640]  because it's not about the contents of the wiki leaks it's the fact that the russians allegedly
[03:10:48.440 --> 03:10:52.760]  leaked them but the contents of the wiki leaks of course revealed that the entire media
[03:10:52.760 --> 03:10:57.720]  was in collusion there with hillary clinton's campaign with the democrats they were giving
[03:10:57.720 --> 03:11:04.520]  her debate questions um they were all admittedly hacks for her to get her in so they were not
[03:11:04.520 --> 03:11:09.160]  doing their job this entire time but now all of a sudden that it's donald trump they're saying
[03:11:09.160 --> 03:11:14.040]  we need to start checking power once again which is the job of the press well how do you turn up
[03:11:14.040 --> 03:11:21.000]  the heat on donald trump i mean last i remember during the entire election cycle the media was
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:28.280]  attacking trump relentlessly uh day in and day out and how much of those attacks actually stuck
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:33.800]  none of them none of them stuck so i guess that that's what they're alluding to is we need to
[03:11:33.800 --> 03:11:40.360]  figure out what can actually stick to donald but here we go again now david brock has said that he
[03:11:40.360 --> 03:11:47.400]  wants to create some sort of a left-wing bright bart operation i guess because correct the record
[03:11:47.400 --> 03:11:53.880]  and media matters has completely flopped and failed but david brock said the press are animals
[03:11:54.840 --> 03:12:00.920]  and it says that dems need to be tougher with the media what exactly is he talking about
[03:12:00.920 --> 03:12:06.200]  david brock founder of media matters and groups like correct the record also um can you know what
[03:12:06.200 --> 03:12:10.200]  just go ahead and look at his campaign financing and see if there's a little sketchy activity there
[03:12:10.200 --> 03:12:17.960]  he spoke with politico's glenn thrush on his off message podcast to reflect on the 2016 election
[03:12:19.080 --> 03:12:25.240]  and brock was upset at the way the mill the media covered hillary clinton versus donald trump
[03:12:26.040 --> 03:12:32.920]  he's complaining saying that the media coverage of hillary clinton scandals overshadowed
[03:12:32.920 --> 03:12:40.520]  more important pieces of news all you heard on the media was everything donald trump has done over
[03:12:40.520 --> 03:12:46.120]  the last 40 years if donald trump swatted a fly in the fourth grade you were going to hear about
[03:12:46.120 --> 03:12:52.440]  it as donald trump hates flies all of her scandals were washed but again what what what are these
[03:12:52.440 --> 03:12:58.280]  attacks of donald trump has actually stuck if any of them stuck i'd say maybe the audit we continue
[03:12:58.280 --> 03:13:02.280]  to hear people say the audit oh he hasn't released his audit okay maybe there's something to that
[03:13:02.280 --> 03:13:09.640]  racist failed misogynist failed xenophobic failed they all failed so what are they going to do next
[03:13:09.640 --> 03:13:14.040]  how can they turn up the heat well because he's a russian agent and i guess that's what it is
[03:13:14.040 --> 03:13:18.120]  huge so now it's just he's a russian agent anybody that likes trump is a russian agent
[03:13:18.120 --> 03:13:23.640]  and who are you david brock who are you an agent for last time i checked i looked into all the
[03:13:23.640 --> 03:13:29.240]  circle of campaign donations and the operations you're running i don't know it looks like you
[03:13:29.240 --> 03:13:34.440]  you might be guilty of money laundering i'm not the one that investigates this kind of stuff but
[03:13:34.440 --> 03:13:39.880]  it's awfully sketchy to me how you skim off the top of these campaign donations as they get funneled
[03:13:39.880 --> 03:13:46.440]  throughout all of your circle of contribution headquarters so but hey maybe david brock
[03:13:47.240 --> 03:13:51.880]  you know i don't know what's going on with david brock of hair gel for that wicked i was just
[03:13:51.880 --> 03:13:56.760]  going to say maybe that going on maybe that hair gel is starting to sink into that brain of his
[03:13:56.760 --> 03:14:01.880]  and causing some brain damage because or he's just totally in the tank for hillary which is
[03:14:01.880 --> 03:14:07.000]  probably the true of course he is media matters is the clinton mouthpiece so he's got to do anything
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:13.160]  he can to try to demonize donald trump step up pressure on the media as if anybody's scared
[03:14:13.160 --> 03:14:18.280]  what correct the record is going to say yeah oh my god actually why don't you actually correct the
[03:14:18.280 --> 03:14:23.480]  record well let's talk about how dangerous this is i know we've we've been talking about how
[03:14:23.480 --> 03:14:28.680]  completely dangerous this is hillary clinton was willing you know in her campaign to take it to
[03:14:28.680 --> 03:14:34.200]  world war three with russia and we were all saying what the heck is going on why would anyone
[03:14:34.200 --> 03:14:38.040]  be voting for someone who's actively trying to walk us into world war three but they've lost
[03:14:38.040 --> 03:14:43.720]  they're not backing down and so now they're just saying well absolutely russia hacked the election
[03:14:43.720 --> 03:14:49.400]  and you know people are on twitter demanding that we do something about it demanding that we
[03:14:49.400 --> 03:14:57.240]  we take military action against russia but they do not even have a consensus there is no definitive
[03:14:57.240 --> 03:15:03.640]  proof that russia of course was involved in the selection hacking now there was a the cia has
[03:15:03.640 --> 03:15:09.080]  changed its tune and actually the chairman of the house intelligence committee wrote to the director
[03:15:09.080 --> 03:15:15.240]  of national intelligence james clapper he asked why this week's reports by the cia that russia did
[03:15:15.240 --> 03:15:21.640]  hack democratic campaign documents contradicts what the agency was saying just three weeks ago last
[03:15:21.640 --> 03:15:27.240]  month james clapper said he lacked good insight about the connection between russian russian
[03:15:27.240 --> 03:15:36.280]  hacking of democratic emails and they're released by wiki leaks but now he's saying that indeed the
[03:15:36.280 --> 03:15:41.720]  cia assessment had concluded that russia had interfered in the race to boost trump it didn't
[03:15:41.720 --> 03:15:46.280]  have any specific intelligence showing criminal involvement but they've concluded their secret
[03:15:46.280 --> 03:15:53.160]  investigation and they did do it so what is going on here and then of course roiders is reporting
[03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:59.880]  their exclusive is that the top us spy agency has not embraced the cia's assessment on russia
[03:15:59.880 --> 03:16:06.280]  hacking so here we are just having complete confusion even within these top intelligence
[03:16:06.280 --> 03:16:11.880]  agencies but if you question it obama says you know we've 17 intelligence agencies agree
[03:16:11.880 --> 03:16:16.760]  and hillary clinton said the same thing that russians hacked in but here this is evidence right
[03:16:16.760 --> 03:16:23.480]  here that these intelligence agencies have not embrace this cia assessment they're asking for
[03:16:23.480 --> 03:16:29.560]  the proof they're saying show us definitively where you're seeing these russian cyber fingerprints
[03:16:29.560 --> 03:16:35.960]  on this well the only proof that we've been given is the wiki leaks that's it is the emails here's
[03:16:35.960 --> 03:16:41.480]  the emails somebody hacked them that's the only proof we have and by the way i have more proof
[03:16:41.480 --> 03:16:47.640]  with i don't know a handful of activity that people within the dnc might be guilty of a lot
[03:16:47.640 --> 03:16:52.920]  more proof of that than any russian involvement with these hacks but here's the interesting
[03:16:52.920 --> 03:16:58.120]  thing about this so let's consider the stance that obama has taken let's consider what obama's
[03:16:58.120 --> 03:17:03.720]  reaction is so now he's saying he wants a full investigation right so obama has now launched
[03:17:03.720 --> 03:17:09.480]  a full investigation into figuring out how russia hacked the dnc or where from russia or who from
[03:17:09.480 --> 03:17:14.200]  russia whatever it is they're looking into this investigation he wants a full investigation into
[03:17:14.200 --> 03:17:21.400]  russia hacking the dnc but here's what's strange about this he puts an end date he puts a date
[03:17:22.360 --> 03:17:29.240]  at the end of this and he says i need the full investigation results on my desk before i leave
[03:17:29.240 --> 03:17:36.280]  office now this says two things to me one how can you put an end date on an investigation if you
[03:17:36.280 --> 03:17:42.360]  have an open-ended investigation to try to find out everything you can it's just that it's open
[03:17:42.360 --> 03:17:46.840]  ended we don't know what we're going to find out and we don't know when thus an open-ended
[03:17:46.840 --> 03:17:53.960]  investigation obama puts a bookend and says well i want you to investigate this until i'm about to
[03:17:53.960 --> 03:17:59.880]  leave office then close your investigation put what you find on my desk and then i'll look into it
[03:17:59.880 --> 03:18:04.680]  that is very strange to me it shows that he's not necessarily concerned over the legitimacy
[03:18:04.680 --> 03:18:11.800]  of the investigation but also what what are they going to report they find in this investigation
[03:18:11.800 --> 03:18:17.960]  and then what is his action going to be if they put that document on his desk that says
[03:18:17.960 --> 03:18:23.720]  russia hacked the united states election whatever claims they make what is the response from obama
[03:18:23.720 --> 03:18:28.120]  going to be is he going to say well we need a reelection is he going to say we need to go to
[03:18:28.120 --> 03:18:32.840]  war with russia and then are they going to try to postpone the inauguration i mean i'm just trying
[03:18:32.840 --> 03:18:37.720]  to war game it out and figure out what they're trying to do but that that screams to me the fact
[03:18:37.720 --> 03:18:44.120]  that he puts a date when he wants the investigation on his desk and it's the last day he's in office
[03:18:44.120 --> 03:18:47.880]  so what does he plan on doing with that intel because they've already lied all the way up to
[03:18:47.880 --> 03:18:52.840]  this point we know what they're going to say so right now they're planning their next move and i
[03:18:52.840 --> 03:18:58.760]  think it's it's it's very scary that the liar in chief barack obama is going to sit here and he's
[03:18:58.760 --> 03:19:03.880]  going to make a decision based on a short-ended investigation that's going to reach his desk
[03:19:03.880 --> 03:19:08.440]  before he leaves office i don't trust that for one second right and it doesn't really even matter
[03:19:08.440 --> 03:19:12.600]  if there is any definitive proof because as you can see all you need to do is turn on any new
[03:19:12.600 --> 03:19:17.160]  station that's out there and it's all about russia hacking the election russia hacked russia hacked
[03:19:17.160 --> 03:19:22.040]  allegedly and then they might look allegedly or maybe possibly this happened but that's not what
[03:19:22.040 --> 03:19:26.360]  people are hearing all people are hearing is that this is indeed what happened that's why hillary
[03:19:26.360 --> 03:19:30.520]  clinton lost you know apparently the russians were the ones who made her set up that private
[03:19:30.520 --> 03:19:35.640]  server and pass all that uh confidential information via her emails and take questions before the
[03:19:35.640 --> 03:19:42.280]  debate yeah i get questions absolutely but this just proves to me that president obama is shaking
[03:19:42.280 --> 03:19:47.640]  in his boots from what donald trump is going to find out once he does take office of exactly
[03:19:47.640 --> 03:19:52.280]  what kind of trouble uh the president has gotten us into in the middle east sick around we'll be

[03:27:00.520 --> 03:27:05.560]  where your neighbors don't like you hanging that don't tread on the little snowflake oh this is
[03:27:05.560 --> 03:27:10.600]  first the other first christmas snowflakes well okay so just in this we're in our short segment now
[03:27:11.720 --> 03:27:18.680]  so let's go ahead and talk about this story about uber employees using data to stalk celebrities
[03:27:18.680 --> 03:27:23.800]  politicians and even their exes now you'll recall a couple years ago uber was assuring
[03:27:23.800 --> 03:27:29.400]  everyone they weren't using your information to spy on you but now indeed it has come out
[03:27:30.200 --> 03:27:35.560]  that that the employees were actually using that data to stalk celebs you know and this is where
[03:27:35.560 --> 03:27:40.440]  you'll find like tmz they're always talking about how they have these ways to get the story while
[03:27:40.440 --> 03:27:44.760]  they're always there they always know where the celebrities are going to be and here you're
[03:27:44.760 --> 03:27:49.000]  being tracked the easiest thing you think you're doing is hailing an uber to take you wherever
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:53.800]  but a former employee who's a whistleblower is now coming out saying employees have been misusing
[03:27:53.800 --> 03:27:59.480]  the tracking technology that's available to them to spy on anyone and this is another one of the
[03:27:59.480 --> 03:28:05.080]  reasons why i don't like taking uber by myself i don't allow them to uber or cabs or anyone frankly
[03:28:05.080 --> 03:28:10.760]  i don't let them pick me up or drop me off at my actual house if i do go with them because i just
[03:28:10.760 --> 03:28:17.480]  don't want them to know that i'm you know home and i have a giant pit bull waiting to greet me
[03:28:17.480 --> 03:28:21.400]  when i get there so is that your strategy get dropped off like a block or two yes like in a
[03:28:21.400 --> 03:28:25.960]  different way to try to avoid people knowing yeah yeah it's interesting too because this was kind
[03:28:25.960 --> 03:28:31.160]  of some of the stuff that snowden alluded to that was going on at booze allen where it's it's not
[03:28:31.160 --> 03:28:36.760]  necessarily uber it's not necessarily you know the corporation or whoever it is it's just individuals
[03:28:36.760 --> 03:28:43.480]  within exactly who exploit this technology for whatever reason whether they want to get a story
[03:28:43.480 --> 03:28:50.280]  for tmz uh whether they want to spy on a former lover or whatever the case may be um that's the
[03:28:50.280 --> 03:28:55.080]  true threat i think behind this technology and right you know we're progressive for the most part
[03:28:55.080 --> 03:29:00.280]  here i i want the new technologies i want to progress technologically you have ten televisions
[03:29:00.280 --> 03:29:06.440]  in your well let's monitor the propaganda um but but at the same time we do need to be aware of
[03:29:06.440 --> 03:29:11.640]  backdoors and you know it's something for me i don't know about yourself leon but but here
[03:29:11.640 --> 03:29:17.560]  recently i've been um i'm very i don't know what the correct word is not nervous but i've kind of
[03:29:17.560 --> 03:29:23.000]  curtailed my digital activity the things that i say and that i do on my cell phone on my computer
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:27.880]  at home i'm now conscious of my digital activity thinking that this is going to be on record
[03:29:27.880 --> 03:29:32.120]  permanently somewhere well absolutely and everyone should be because we're all going to be spied on
[03:29:32.120 --> 03:29:38.600]  they even emit 2030 their grand plan for the 2030 agenda is to have even our dreams our private
[03:29:38.600 --> 03:29:44.440]  thoughts will be accessible to them in their god view stick around we've got more news coming right
[03:29:44.440 --> 03:29:53.400]  up not in my head we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:57.640 --> 03:30:03.640]  the fraud in chief barack hussein obama went on the comedy central fake news program the daily show
[03:30:03.640 --> 03:30:08.600]  to talk to trevor nobody knows you about the alleged russian hacking what they did here hacking
[03:30:09.320 --> 03:30:19.880]  some emails and releasing them uh is not a particularly fancy brand of espionage or propaganda
[03:30:19.880 --> 03:30:25.960]  here he stutters after his lie then never denies the legitimacy of the emails the emails are real
[03:30:25.960 --> 03:30:33.240]  the corruption is real so that the public and our elected representatives going forward can find
[03:30:33.240 --> 03:30:40.520]  ways to prevent this kind of interference from having an impact on the elections in the future
[03:30:40.520 --> 03:30:45.240]  these are the people that want the world government want foreign influence but now it is a problem
[03:30:45.240 --> 03:30:50.120]  when russia is allegedly hacking us officials to expose corruption isn't that what these people
[03:30:50.120 --> 03:30:55.400]  want a world government as a watchdog for corruption this is owin schreuer for more go to info wars

[03:33:23.400 --> 03:33:30.280]  welcome back to the alex jones show i am leon macadoo joined by owens shroyer and we are hosting
[03:33:30.280 --> 03:33:35.240]  the overdrive hour we've got a lot of news in this long segment but i want to get back to the story
[03:33:35.240 --> 03:33:40.360]  that we touched on in the beginning of the hour about um the fact that bloomberg is basically
[03:33:40.360 --> 03:33:45.960]  saying hey uh geoengineering it does exist it's not really that safe but scientists are working on it
[03:33:45.960 --> 03:33:52.120]  so now scientists are working on a new a new tactic they want to give the atmosphere an
[03:33:52.120 --> 03:33:58.520]  antacid to relieve climate change so they're also going to say long-term global average temperatures
[03:33:58.520 --> 03:34:03.480]  steadily on the rise which of course is a lot of people are saying what the heck are you talking
[03:34:03.480 --> 03:34:07.800]  about they haven't risen at all and i like what trump said he just goes you know what i just don't
[03:34:07.800 --> 03:34:13.320]  think anybody knows that was the statement trump made but now they're working on uh increasingly
[03:34:13.320 --> 03:34:19.000]  desperate solutions to the symptoms of global climate change one approach to geoengineering
[03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:23.640]  the earth is to mimic the natural atmospheric cooling effect that tends to follow the massive
[03:34:23.640 --> 03:34:29.320]  dispersion of sulfur dioxide into the air during a volcanic eruption so they're wanting to basically
[03:34:29.320 --> 03:34:35.480]  release um like a pill an antacid pill into the sky that would mimic this natural phenomenon
[03:34:35.480 --> 03:34:41.080]  and uh they say it might indirectly both eat away at the layer of ozone that protects living
[03:34:41.080 --> 03:34:46.360]  things from ultraviolet light and warm the lower part of the stratosphere above the tropics but
[03:34:46.360 --> 03:34:52.120]  whatever let's let's just go for it an aerosol of calcium carbonate would have a similar cooling
[03:34:52.120 --> 03:34:56.680]  effect as sulfur dioxide on the upper atmosphere and help protect the ozone layer as a bonus
[03:34:57.320 --> 03:35:01.400]  isn't this the illustration of exactly everything we're dealing with look you know
[03:35:01.400 --> 03:35:07.800]  hey we're warning you about anthropogenic climate change you're a bad guy we need to
[03:35:07.800 --> 03:35:12.600]  have all these regulations we need to get in control of climate change but then on the
[03:35:12.600 --> 03:35:18.280]  on the other side what are they doing well we're in charge of anthropogenic climate change now
[03:35:18.280 --> 03:35:23.640]  we're going to geoengineer the uh climate so wait a second i'm not allowed to have
[03:35:23.640 --> 03:35:29.160]  anthropogenic climate change but the establishment is allowed to operate whatever
[03:35:29.160 --> 03:35:33.640]  anthropogenic climate change they want and they used to do it in secrecy now they kind of do it
[03:35:33.640 --> 03:35:38.680]  in like faux secrecy like you know because they're they're admittedly you know if you're a foreign
[03:35:38.680 --> 03:35:43.080]  government saying well what the heck why you're actually releasing stuff into the atmosphere
[03:35:43.080 --> 03:35:46.520]  which is already going on which is of course going to move around the globe it's not like it's going
[03:35:46.520 --> 03:35:51.720]  to be localized to your one area so another country might be really upset that this is going on and
[03:35:51.720 --> 03:35:57.320]  that's kind of the uh issue here now is that it's unclear what nation or international body
[03:35:57.320 --> 03:36:02.040]  would be authorized to release the sulfur dioxide that could have the ill effect of creating
[03:36:02.600 --> 03:36:07.880]  acid rain it's a it's a pollutant of course um so you know it's man-made climate change this is why
[03:36:07.880 --> 03:36:12.360]  they need that global governance so that they can go ahead and do this but meanwhile they're
[03:36:12.360 --> 03:36:17.160]  already doing it but it doesn't exist it's not safe but they're working on making it safer
[03:36:18.520 --> 03:36:24.440]  and so i know it's confusing man-made climate change is the biggest problem to you well we're
[03:36:24.440 --> 03:36:28.680]  going to go ahead and start man-made climate change yes to save you from man-made climate
[03:36:28.680 --> 03:36:33.080]  change from yourselves i mean it's just absolutely absurd i i mean i'm seriously i'm sitting here like
[03:36:33.080 --> 03:36:38.200]  shaking my head and you're laughing at my reaction it's just like can it get more ridiculous it really
[03:36:38.200 --> 03:36:43.640]  can't oh wait it can that's why it's kind of refreshing when you see some of trump's picks
[03:36:43.640 --> 03:36:50.520]  is it's like for instance um he's picking a skeptic to head the epa and dismantle the climate
[03:36:50.520 --> 03:36:56.280]  agenda so he's putting these people in um that are going to do the complete opposite of what the
[03:36:56.280 --> 03:37:00.600]  globalists have been working on and they're just looking at him going what are you talking about
[03:37:00.600 --> 03:37:04.840]  and that's the thing that really frustrates me is because i've got i've got you know some stories
[03:37:04.840 --> 03:37:12.200]  here 18 spectacularly wrong apocalyptic predictions made around the time of the first earth day 25
[03:37:12.200 --> 03:37:16.840]  years of predicting the global warming tipping point you know according to al gore we should all
[03:37:16.840 --> 03:37:21.960]  be underwater right now milk should be nine dollars a gallon um and so there's no more oil
[03:37:21.960 --> 03:37:27.480]  petroleum yeah trump of course met with al gore um and so everyone was going oh wow he's meeting
[03:37:27.480 --> 03:37:33.560]  with al gore he secretly met with uh who's the actor i can't think of his name right now de caprio
[03:37:33.560 --> 03:37:39.560]  yes de caprio so he's meeting with him he met with that net so then he got what he flew on his
[03:37:39.560 --> 03:37:44.760]  private jet there to go meet with trump for his 15 minute meeting so but then what does he do after
[03:37:44.760 --> 03:37:49.800]  those meetings with these two he picks a climate skeptic to head epa but my point is so they make
[03:37:49.800 --> 03:37:54.760]  all these there's a global cooling the earth is heading into a mini ice age no way it's global
[03:37:54.760 --> 03:37:59.400]  warming oh well actually we don't know what the heck is going on so let's just call it climate
[03:37:59.400 --> 03:38:04.600]  change because no one can deny the which happens anyway changes and if you do you're called a
[03:38:04.600 --> 03:38:10.360]  climate change denier that's their little trick that's their trick is to say oh you deny climate
[03:38:10.360 --> 03:38:17.320]  change this is so genius in my opinion of donald trump because he's basically taking an open-minded
[03:38:17.320 --> 03:38:22.760]  approach to this he's hearing all sides of the issue and then he's coming out and making a statement
[03:38:22.760 --> 03:38:27.480]  after talking to all sides of the issue and saying look i don't think anybody knows i don't think
[03:38:27.480 --> 03:38:34.520]  anybody can actually say for a fact what is going on with climate change what anthro progenic climate
[03:38:34.520 --> 03:38:40.760]  change impacts really are um if the co2 was a much higher before humans were even on the earth and
[03:38:40.760 --> 03:38:45.480]  like i all the the science classes i took in school were earth and space science because
[03:38:45.480 --> 03:38:51.080]  i love i love earth and space i almost thought about becoming an astronomer a little bit too
[03:38:51.080 --> 03:38:58.120]  boring for me but i love it and the fact is the earth is long overdue for another massive purge
[03:38:58.120 --> 03:39:01.640]  of whatever is on this planet it's happened at least seven times throughout our history
[03:39:01.640 --> 03:39:05.960]  and they do know at least that much based on um you know what they're able to tell with the
[03:39:05.960 --> 03:39:10.920]  soils and everything is that yeah there is some another cataclysm that is long overdue
[03:39:10.920 --> 03:39:17.240]  but they're trying to control it or at least in the meantime pillage us of our tax dollars and
[03:39:17.240 --> 03:39:22.120]  control our every single move and tell us that we're the problem but you know this this type of
[03:39:22.760 --> 03:39:27.800]  cataclysmic events have happened at least seven times throughout the earth's history
[03:39:27.800 --> 03:39:32.280]  but they're you know they're trying to tell people and they get it spectacularly wrong
[03:39:32.280 --> 03:39:36.520]  because they say you know we're going to be another ice age and then that doesn't work so
[03:39:36.520 --> 03:39:40.440]  then they say there's going to be global warming and there's going to be all these massive hurricanes
[03:39:40.440 --> 03:39:47.640]  and tsunamis and then that doesn't happen we haven't had a major hurricane since i believe 2005
[03:39:47.640 --> 03:39:54.440]  thank god but you know it's just and so now it's back to this mini ice age it's well we're gonna
[03:39:54.440 --> 03:40:00.760]  we're gonna fly around the planet and point our finger at you and say you're responsible for climate
[03:40:00.760 --> 03:40:07.160]  change or you're denying climate change uh while flying around on a jet adding to it but then beyond
[03:40:07.160 --> 03:40:15.160]  that you're also countries you're also going to have like i mean organized scientific geoengineering
[03:40:15.160 --> 03:40:19.000]  going on they never mentioned that when they fly around the country and tell you how bad you are
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:23.080]  for climate change but at least really open it up for some alternative points if you allow the
[03:40:23.080 --> 03:40:27.800]  scientists to do their job to figure out what's going what's going on rather than actually doing
[03:40:27.800 --> 03:40:32.360]  the scientists who disagree with this climate agenda of the globalist and whether we agree with
[03:40:32.360 --> 03:40:36.920]  it or not to me it looks like that's at least what trump is is trying to do here from all sides of
[03:40:36.920 --> 03:40:42.680]  this but here's the here's the irony to me uh now this was a story from the guardian earth woefully
[03:40:42.680 --> 03:40:49.160]  unprepared for surprise comet or asteroid nasa scientist warned so i forget the name of the
[03:40:49.160 --> 03:40:54.760]  movie uh basically that this is from where you know the asteroid is about to hit planet earth
[03:40:54.760 --> 03:40:58.360]  i don't remember and you know they have to get up there and they have to blow it up so it doesn't
[03:40:58.360 --> 03:41:03.320]  so but here's what i'm saying we're all sitting here worried about this climate change or we're
[03:41:03.320 --> 03:41:08.360]  being told we have to worry about climate change the very people warning us about climate change
[03:41:08.360 --> 03:41:14.680]  are flying around the planet on their c 130s and are actually involved with organized scientific
[03:41:14.680 --> 03:41:22.760]  geoengineering but guess what if an asteroid hit planet earth all your little all your little talk
[03:41:22.760 --> 03:41:28.200]  about climate change all your little plans on how to scientifically geoengineer this planet
[03:41:28.200 --> 03:41:35.880]  are nothing nothing zero silch nada if an asteroid hits this planet the entire climate will change
[03:41:35.880 --> 03:41:41.000]  immediately and you know what this is the funniest thing that for whatever reason people cannot wrap
[03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:47.960]  their minds around leon and alex says this all the time they think he's crazy no the sun controls
[03:41:47.960 --> 03:41:53.880]  the climate this is not difficult to understand in fact if the sun goes out how's your eye
[03:41:53.880 --> 03:41:57.400]  anthropogenic climate change going to be working then how's your geoengineering going to be working
[03:41:57.400 --> 03:42:01.720]  then doesn't matter you're going to be dried up you're going to be gone if sunspots on the sun
[03:42:01.720 --> 03:42:07.240]  change temperature the sun surface temperature is constantly evolving how far earth is from the sun
[03:42:07.240 --> 03:42:12.600]  and the rotation it's all constantly changing cycles that's how climate that's the biggest
[03:42:12.600 --> 03:42:16.920]  impact of climate change but they never talk about the sun they're going to talk about you
[03:42:16.920 --> 03:42:22.440]  little leon when you drive your car to work and cow farts and wood fires and and you know we've
[03:42:22.440 --> 03:42:27.000]  talked about this uh off the air a little bit this kind of gets a little off topic but as we're
[03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:33.560]  talking about space and science and all this stuff this is from uh the sun stargazers discover
[03:42:33.560 --> 03:42:38.840]  priceless planet which has clouds of rubies and sapphires a massive planet yeah you'd like that
[03:42:38.840 --> 03:42:44.120]  wouldn't you do you want to go there don't you leon a massive planet with clouds jam packed full
[03:42:44.120 --> 03:42:49.400]  of precious rubies and sapphires has been glimpsed in deep space so you know i don't know too much
[03:42:49.400 --> 03:42:54.680]  about this is there a planet made of gold that range rubies and sapphires i don't know but you
[03:42:54.680 --> 03:43:01.080]  know what this stuff to me this is this is the next evolution in our humanity this is the next
[03:43:01.080 --> 03:43:08.520]  breakthrough in our um you know culture in our society as humans is breaking through into space
[03:43:09.400 --> 03:43:15.960]  establishing civilizations in space and finding the answers to the questions that we never thought
[03:43:15.960 --> 03:43:19.960]  we would know finding the answers to what's going on in space why is there a planet that
[03:43:19.960 --> 03:43:25.720]  range rubies was mars ever inhabited did mars ever have um you know water could could humans live on
[03:43:25.720 --> 03:43:29.800]  mars could humans live in other galaxies can we ever travel at life speed this is the stuff i
[03:43:29.800 --> 03:43:35.160]  would love to see human humans working together to figure out we have reached this point in our
[03:43:35.160 --> 03:43:40.440]  evolution or in our humanity where we can actually work together and find out these things we can
[03:43:40.440 --> 03:43:46.600]  make unbelievable things to travel to places we'd never thought we'd go and instead i have to listen
[03:43:46.600 --> 03:43:52.840]  to a bunch of fumbling bumbling buffoons tell me that russia is hacking the election and that
[03:43:52.840 --> 03:43:57.800]  anthro progenic climate climate change is my biggest issue so that's what we have to deal with
[03:43:57.800 --> 03:44:02.200]  unfortunately instead of coming together to expand civilization to the stars right and they want to
[03:44:02.200 --> 03:44:06.840]  complain about overpopulation well if we get out to space you're not going to be complaining then
[03:44:06.840 --> 03:44:11.400]  are you of course you don't need to complain now that's a total myth we don't get to go there
[03:44:11.400 --> 03:44:17.800]  see i just don't think until humans um we have to stop littering we have to stop having people go
[03:44:17.800 --> 03:44:22.520]  out and kill baby dolphins because they rip it out of the water because they want to take selfies
[03:44:22.520 --> 03:44:29.880]  with it this is what humans would do they would go to another planet and they would find evidence
[03:44:29.880 --> 03:44:34.760]  of life on that planet and then they would kill it because they had to get some selfies with it
[03:44:35.320 --> 03:44:41.720]  well let's recall though if you if you if you were on mars and you found a tiny little fungus on
[03:44:41.720 --> 03:44:46.920]  mars that would be considered a lot considered life yes but if if you're what is it under a month
[03:44:46.920 --> 03:44:50.360]  or four months pregnant whatever it is that's not considered life though amazing how that
[03:44:50.360 --> 03:44:56.200]  little standard works isn't it humans we are a silly bunch are we but let's go to space we promise
[03:44:56.200 --> 03:45:00.360]  we will not mess it up and i don't want big corporations going out there and taking all
[03:45:00.360 --> 03:45:06.040]  the rubies and sapphires off this plant make nasa great again yeah exactly yeah my brother in law
[03:45:06.040 --> 03:45:10.600]  works for nasa and he can't wait for a new administration because yeah maybe we can finally
[03:45:10.600 --> 03:45:16.440]  advance the human race into space if we have a president that supports um and maybe we can have
[03:45:16.440 --> 03:45:22.120]  people that maybe maybe we can have a society of people that know more about john glenn than
[03:45:22.120 --> 03:45:28.600]  kim kardashians but not just kim kardashian just her but people know more about her but
[03:45:28.600 --> 03:45:34.360]  than they do about john glenn i mean that is the paradigm that we need to somehow that is the
[03:45:34.360 --> 03:45:39.080]  trance that we need to somehow get out of this country okay okay the fact that scientists have
[03:45:39.080 --> 03:45:45.320]  figured out how to create kim kardashians but and give people that kind of a but rather than
[03:45:45.320 --> 03:45:51.800]  get us out into space can that's the problem we have can kim kardashians but actually double
[03:45:51.800 --> 03:45:57.960]  as a projectile to get us to space that's what i want to know a launching pad for the spaceships
[03:45:57.960 --> 03:46:03.240]  there you go to be able to get into outer space easier and also a landing pad with land back into
[03:46:03.240 --> 03:46:07.960]  the atmosphere i i like it that's an idea something to think about speaking of kim kardashians
[03:46:07.960 --> 03:46:13.720]  useful that is an excellent segue to the fact that kanye west visited donald trump today and
[03:46:13.720 --> 03:46:18.920]  people were just they were shocked totally flabbergasted what kind of an effect do you think this is
[03:46:18.920 --> 03:46:24.040]  going to have on the culture uh with the young people seeing kanye west there with donald trump
[03:46:24.040 --> 03:46:28.760]  now of course they've tried to throw him under the bus uh immediately when he came out saying you
[03:46:28.760 --> 03:46:33.240]  know i didn't vote but if i had voted i would have voted for donald trump and they were like no
[03:46:33.240 --> 03:46:37.640]  sorry we're taking you to the mental hospital you've clearly you're having a mental breakdown
[03:46:37.640 --> 03:46:42.600]  but here he is i don't know if you guys have the video of him i think it's going to play at the end
[03:46:42.600 --> 03:46:48.040]  but there's a they give each other the high five you know as they're leaving and it's like the total
[03:46:48.040 --> 03:46:53.480]  there's no way hillary clinton ever would have been able to manage that kind of a high five on a way
[03:46:53.480 --> 03:46:57.800]  out he tells him you know coming up right here he tells him to uh you know take care of yourself
[03:46:57.800 --> 03:47:03.640]  buddy and here's the epic handshake oh here we go oh it's actually he went in for the handshake
[03:47:03.640 --> 03:47:09.160]  and then at the last moment he had to adjust into the palm going up wow what an adjustment
[03:47:09.160 --> 03:47:14.280]  and the little like the little chest bump bro hug he got some dabbin pound from kanye west at
[03:47:14.280 --> 03:47:20.360]  trump tower today hillary clinton would never that's why donald trump is your president it'll be um
[03:47:20.360 --> 03:47:24.840]  it is it is wild though this whole kanye west deal people are alleging in the hip hop industry that
[03:47:24.840 --> 03:47:29.880]  the entire kanye west breakdown was nothing more than a hoax in order to garner more attention
[03:47:30.520 --> 03:47:38.120]  to himself certainly something you wouldn't put past kanye but if we do believe that donald is
[03:47:38.120 --> 03:47:43.080]  genuine um we have to take something from this meeting with kanye he says he's friends with kanye
[03:47:43.080 --> 03:47:49.560]  west um obviously kanye was locked up or or put into a mental institution for trumping while black
[03:47:49.560 --> 03:47:54.360]  yeah it's nice to see he's able to get out and then go meet with donald it's also nice to see him
[03:47:54.360 --> 03:47:59.320]  pushing back against you have all these celebrities who are like i'm not playing at your inauguration
[03:47:59.320 --> 03:48:04.280]  uh you know take that donald trump and then here you have kanye west who's massively influential
[03:48:04.280 --> 03:48:09.320]  love him or hate him uh and he's saying you know what screw you i'm gonna go meet with the president
[03:48:09.320 --> 03:48:16.120]  what if you got kanye west and taylor swift to perform together at the trump inauguration that
[03:48:16.120 --> 03:48:22.200]  would be beyond epic that would be just the president that would be bringing people together
[03:48:22.200 --> 03:48:27.160]  rather than the great divider in chief that we have right now uh speaking of president obama
[03:48:27.160 --> 03:48:33.000]  let's talk about the fact that he came out uh telling donald trump you know that he would be
[03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:38.680]  uh without his intel briefings he would be flying blind and basically making fun of donald trump
[03:48:38.680 --> 03:48:43.080]  because he skipped one of these intelligence briefings mind you he's not even the president yet
[03:48:43.080 --> 03:48:47.080]  but the media was running with that oh he's already skipping his intelligence briefing and they said
[03:48:47.080 --> 03:48:52.040]  they want to give him fake briefings too this is a president who has skipped more than half
[03:48:52.040 --> 03:48:57.640]  of his daily intelligence briefings saying that donald trump is going to be flying blind without
[03:48:57.640 --> 03:49:03.640]  the the intel but you'll recall let's just take a little walk back through uh recent history
[03:49:03.640 --> 03:49:09.880]  president obama continually uses the excuse that he finds out about world events like hillary clinton's
[03:49:09.880 --> 03:49:15.720]  use of a private email server fast and furious um seven other times he says he finds out about
[03:49:15.720 --> 03:49:20.520]  these world events by watching the news so he didn't even find out about this stuff in his
[03:49:20.520 --> 03:49:26.040]  intelligence briefings that he continued to skip he found out about it he alleges oh i found out
[03:49:26.040 --> 03:49:30.520]  about at the same time everybody else did by watching the news so he found out about fast
[03:49:30.520 --> 03:49:37.080]  and furious by the news the nsa spying on foreign leaders uh the general david portrays sex scandal
[03:49:37.080 --> 03:49:43.320]  the irs is targeting of conservative groups the justice department's wiretapping of ap and fox
[03:49:43.320 --> 03:49:49.800]  news reporters the department of veterans affairs health care waiting list scandal uh the unauthorized
[03:49:49.800 --> 03:49:55.800]  air force one photo op and like i mentioned hillary clinton's use of a private email server why she
[03:49:55.800 --> 03:50:03.240]  while she was secretary of state so what the heck and of course we know it's total bs but you know
[03:50:03.240 --> 03:50:10.120]  he finds this all out at the same time we did by watching the fake news well and again i guess this
[03:50:10.120 --> 03:50:15.080]  is obama admitting he's been flying blind because he doesn't attend his intelligent briefings but
[03:50:15.080 --> 03:50:19.640]  this is how it went obama wakes up in the morning he's on the phone with his buddy he's like what
[03:50:19.640 --> 03:50:24.600]  time's that t time okay and then he's like oh it's just a deli intelligence briefing i'll look at it
[03:50:24.600 --> 03:50:28.600]  on my and then the the people who are supposed to get the intel briefing to him they say wait
[03:50:28.600 --> 03:50:33.160]  excuse me mr president we've got a intelligence briefing in 30 minutes well can't we do that on
[03:50:33.160 --> 03:50:39.080]  the golf course uh no sir this is highly classified okay i'll do it later i'll watch i'll watch the news
[03:50:39.080 --> 03:50:44.840]  i trust cnn i'll watch the news yeah it's just a complete and total joke and you know briefly
[03:50:44.840 --> 03:50:48.760]  we'll get back to all the stuff he said was fairly routine that caused the the election
[03:50:48.760 --> 03:50:53.400]  to go in trump's favor

[03:56:21.480 --> 03:56:26.280]  well that's a thing people got such that peppermint oil tea tree oil these are things that you know
[03:56:26.280 --> 03:56:31.080]  they're they're all natural ingredients that by the way of course uh big pharma and their ilk
[03:56:31.080 --> 03:56:38.280]  the texas medical board for instance wants to uh do away with people being able to access
[03:56:38.280 --> 03:56:43.240]  this type of natural supplements there they want to have control over what type of natural
[03:56:43.800 --> 03:56:49.080]  remedies people are able to to get their hands on which is insane it'll all be state-issued
[03:56:49.080 --> 03:56:54.040]  sometime right yeah they want to cut out your brain your child's brain rather than allowing
[03:56:54.040 --> 03:56:59.080]  you to try cannabis oil for your child's family brand friendly brain surgery yeah just a little
[03:56:59.080 --> 03:57:05.880]  friendly lobotomy that's much better than going with the natural uh cannabis oil this is the obama
[03:57:05.880 --> 03:57:11.080]  been used since biblical times thank you hey you know speaking of obama and we're about to close
[03:57:11.080 --> 03:57:17.320]  off this broadcast what do you think about this obama is ripping people who are obsessing over
[03:57:17.320 --> 03:57:25.800]  the content of the hacked emails instead of who did the hacking now well he says nothing explosive
[03:57:25.800 --> 03:57:32.120]  was found there nothing explosive nothing routine again i said this earlier there is more proof in
[03:57:32.120 --> 03:57:39.400]  these emails over dozens of alleged activities between the people in the dnc much more proof than
[03:57:39.400 --> 03:57:47.080]  you have that russia actually rigged anything or did the hacking at all again more proof exists in
[03:57:47.080 --> 03:57:53.480]  the content of the emails than the the fraudulent charge that russia is guilty for the hack with
[03:57:53.480 --> 03:57:58.840]  no proof at all and again why is obama not saying to look at the content but instead who hacked it
[03:57:58.840 --> 03:58:04.120]  total false flag he wants everyone to look away he wants but how ironic is it that he goes on a
[03:58:04.120 --> 03:58:09.400]  fake news show and talks to a fake journalist trevor noah to put out this thing and he's like
[03:58:09.400 --> 03:58:13.480]  you know really there's nothing that it was fairly routine stuff well if it was fairly
[03:58:13.480 --> 03:58:19.080]  ruined routine stuff then what impact could it possibly have had on our elections so at the
[03:58:19.080 --> 03:58:23.640]  same time they're wanting to put out this message it was so devastating but it was just routine
[03:58:23.640 --> 03:58:28.120]  don't don't go look at it and they're not fake emails they don't deny the content's real we're
[03:58:28.120 --> 03:58:31.640]  going to be talking about this on the info wars nightly news tonight check us out we'll be going
