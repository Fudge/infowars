[00:00.000 --> 00:03.440]  mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:03.440 --> 00:05.040]  You want answers?
[00:05.040 --> 00:06.560]  Well, so does he.
[00:06.560 --> 00:10.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:10.720 --> 00:15.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:17.000 --> 00:19.480]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:19.480 --> 00:21.440]  I am not Alex Jones, I am Jason Burmus.
[00:21.440 --> 00:24.280]  I'll be subbing in today and tomorrow.
[00:24.280 --> 00:27.920]  We're gonna be wide open on the phones all day long.
[00:27.920 --> 00:33.320]  And I want to start it with a news item I didn't cover yesterday because I just didn't
[00:33.320 --> 00:34.320]  really have time.
[00:34.320 --> 00:38.960]  I mentioned it when Alex called in, but a man was arrested for turning without signalling.
[00:38.960 --> 00:43.440]  And not only was he arrested for turning without signalling, basically he refused an illegal
[00:43.440 --> 00:44.440]  search on his car.
[00:44.440 --> 00:48.240]  There was no probable cause to have him get out of the car and have it searched again.
[00:48.240 --> 00:49.240]  He just didn't signal.
[00:49.240 --> 00:53.560]  I mean, how many times have you made a right or a left turn on a small road and not signaled?
[00:53.560 --> 00:55.440]  It's pretty ridiculous.
[00:55.440 --> 01:01.160]  However, that didn't stop the cop from, uh, grabbed him out of the car, searching his
[01:01.160 --> 01:05.960]  car anyway, and bring him down to the station and arresting him.
[01:05.960 --> 01:09.520]  So let's see if we can get this little, little YouTube clip to play.
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.800]  Well, then county driver did not, and that mistake landed him in jail.
[01:14.800 --> 01:19.760]  An arrest for not using the turn signal is so rare that even the Melissa police chief
[01:19.760 --> 01:21.360]  has never heard of it happening.
[01:21.360 --> 01:28.040]  But as Channel East Jonathan Betts explains, it's completely legal.
[01:28.040 --> 01:31.760]  Mark Robinson was driving through downtown Melissa last week when he was pulled over
[01:31.760 --> 01:34.520]  for failing to use his turn signal.
[01:34.520 --> 01:39.400]  But instead of just getting a ticket, the officer took the 24 year old to jail.
[01:39.400 --> 01:44.600]  He was booked, strip searched, and sat for three hours, he says, with criminals.
[01:44.600 --> 01:49.720]  People talking about using drugs and shooting heroin asked me what I was in there for.
[01:49.720 --> 01:52.280]  And I told him, well, a turn signal violation.
[01:52.280 --> 01:54.240]  There aren't any warrants out for Robinson.
[01:54.240 --> 01:57.000]  In fact, he says he's never even been in jail.
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.080]  But he does admit to challenging the officer's questions during the stop.
[02:01.080 --> 02:05.640]  It's just unacceptable to me to have my son thrown in jail for such a minor offense.
[02:05.640 --> 02:10.560]  His father thinks the officer assumed he had drugs because of his age, but she didn't.
[02:10.560 --> 02:14.520]  I think if they stopped me in the same circumstances, I would have never gone to jail or probably
[02:14.520 --> 02:15.800]  never even got a ticket.
[02:15.800 --> 02:19.680]  In fact, News 8 contacted various cities in Cullin County, many of which have not
[02:19.680 --> 02:23.520]  made a single arrest this year for turn signal violations.
[02:23.520 --> 02:27.760]  Even the police chief in Melissa acknowledges he's never seen this happen in his own city.
[02:27.760 --> 02:31.440]  I'm just sure that I've been the police chief this is the first time.
[02:31.440 --> 02:35.760]  But he stands behind his officer, saying state law gives him the power to arrest someone
[02:35.760 --> 02:37.960]  for many crimes, no matter how minor.
[02:37.960 --> 02:40.600]  I can't discuss the specifics of the case.
[02:40.600 --> 02:44.960]  The officer was within his right to arrest the person and which he did.
[02:44.960 --> 02:49.640]  Still he tells News 8 this afternoon he will review department policy and may make changes.
[02:49.640 --> 02:53.720]  For Mark Robinson, what he most wants is an apology.
[02:53.720 --> 02:57.000]  He says for a trip he never should have been forced to make.
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.040]  In Melissa, Jonathan Betts, Channel 8 News.
[02:59.040 --> 03:00.760]  An apology.
[03:00.760 --> 03:01.760]  An apology.
[03:01.760 --> 03:05.560]  I think he deserves a little bit more than an apology.
[03:05.560 --> 03:06.560]  Okay.
[03:06.560 --> 03:09.080]  He was taken to jail for a turn signal.
[03:09.080 --> 03:13.800]  Now the guy who's the police chief for six years gets up there and goes, whoa, yeah,
[03:13.800 --> 03:15.440]  it's never happened before.
[03:15.440 --> 03:17.880]  He's looking like, wow, yeah, it sounds pretty ridiculous.
[03:17.880 --> 03:23.200]  But of course, because it's that gang mentality, he's going to say he's within his rights to
[03:23.200 --> 03:24.200]  do so.
[03:24.200 --> 03:26.200]  We can arrest anybody for anything.
[03:26.200 --> 03:29.400]  There's a multitude of crimes out there that we can just arrest people for.
[03:29.400 --> 03:31.400]  Isn't that great?
[03:31.400 --> 03:35.120]  You don't put on a turn signal, you can end up in a cell.
[03:35.120 --> 03:36.360]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[03:36.360 --> 03:37.360]  It's beyond Lucas.
[03:37.360 --> 03:41.040]  I guess this guy should just count as lucky stars that he didn't get beaten over the head
[03:41.040 --> 03:43.000]  with a billy club like those Philly guys.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.560]  Oh, but they were on edge.
[03:45.560 --> 03:46.560]  They're on edge.
[03:46.560 --> 03:47.800]  There was a bank robbery.
[03:47.800 --> 03:48.800]  They didn't know.
[03:48.800 --> 03:52.800]  Well, when they pull these guys over, and I don't even want to play the audio of that
[03:52.800 --> 03:57.680]  because it's just the Associated Press spinning the story for the police officers.
[03:57.680 --> 04:03.600]  When you see it, more than a dozen officers physically assault three people who pull over.
[04:03.600 --> 04:05.560]  As far as I can tell on the video, they don't run.
[04:05.560 --> 04:09.800]  Again, I only saw the, the clip where they actually pull over, but I didn't see some
[04:09.800 --> 04:13.580]  crazy police chase.
[04:13.580 --> 04:18.680]  They grab them out, it's, it's boots to the, uh, boots to the side.
[04:18.680 --> 04:22.160]  You know, baton out, dogs out, three people.
[04:22.160 --> 04:25.240]  I hope they sue, but, but again, it doesn't even matter.
[04:25.240 --> 04:27.840]  Like these guys don't even go to jail, man.
[04:27.840 --> 04:29.920]  You know, maybe they get suspended for a week without pay.
[04:29.920 --> 04:31.480]  What could he do?
[04:31.480 --> 04:32.480]  Nothing happens to these guys.
[04:32.480 --> 04:33.480]  All right.
[04:33.480 --> 04:34.480]  We're taking your calls.
[04:34.480 --> 04:54.760]  We'll be back after this info wars.com.
[04:54.760 --> 05:00.960]  It is a big idea, a new world order in the near future.
[05:00.960 --> 05:09.540]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[05:09.540 --> 05:12.700]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[05:12.700 --> 05:17.700]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[05:17.700 --> 05:23.060]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[05:23.060 --> 05:28.020]  For the first time in history, the elites plan for world government is blown wide open.
[05:28.020 --> 05:32.380]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[05:32.380 --> 05:35.060]  The old America is making great progress toward a world government.
[05:35.060 --> 05:36.060]  Most people have no idea.
[05:36.060 --> 05:37.060]  They're not after money.
[05:37.060 --> 05:38.060]  They have all the money they need.
[05:38.060 --> 05:39.060]  They're after power.
[05:39.060 --> 05:40.060]  That's their affidavit.
[05:40.060 --> 05:46.260]  Order in game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or info wars.com or watch it online right
[05:46.260 --> 05:51.820]  now at prisonplanet.tv in game blueprint for global enslavement.
[05:51.820 --> 05:53.860]  You have been warned.
[05:53.860 --> 05:56.900]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[05:56.900 --> 06:02.540]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes and more?
[06:02.540 --> 06:06.780]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients.
[06:06.780 --> 06:07.780]  Most of which are synthetic.
[06:07.780 --> 06:09.500]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[06:09.500 --> 06:13.220]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[06:13.220 --> 06:17.700]  coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and
[06:17.700 --> 06:18.940]  mucous membranes.
[06:18.940 --> 06:20.780]  Now compare cowbell and pure soap.
[06:20.780 --> 06:25.020]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[06:25.020 --> 06:30.180]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[06:30.180 --> 06:33.940]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[06:33.940 --> 06:34.940]  Keep it natural.
[06:34.940 --> 06:43.420]  Call cowbell and pure soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to fivestarsope.com.

[06:47.980 --> 06:56.820]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[06:56.820 --> 06:59.380]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship.
[06:59.380 --> 07:02.700]  Martial law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight.
[07:02.700 --> 07:04.660]  It's going to be incremental.
[07:04.660 --> 07:06.620]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[07:06.620 --> 07:09.900]  Any incident, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.
[07:09.900 --> 07:11.220]  Anything could be the final push.

[07:14.700 --> 07:17.020]  you for life under total military control.
[07:17.020 --> 07:20.420]  Know how to survive in the conditions that may soon be here on American soil.
[07:20.420 --> 07:23.540]  Learn how to act around controlling troops and how to use their own psychology against
[07:23.540 --> 07:25.260]  them through social engineering.
[07:25.260 --> 07:28.660]  When martial law is officially announced, checkpoints will be enforced, gun confiscations
[07:28.660 --> 07:31.860]  will occur for registered gun owners, and cities will be on lockdown.
[07:31.860 --> 07:34.820]  You will be dealing with a force that has been in training for years preparing for this
[07:34.820 --> 07:35.820]  takeover.

[07:46.060 --> 07:59.900]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[07:59.900 --> 08:02.100]  a war on for your mind.
[08:02.100 --> 08:12.020]  All right, folks, we are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[08:12.020 --> 08:13.020]  I'm sitting in.
[08:13.020 --> 08:14.020]  I'm Jason Vermus.
[08:14.020 --> 08:18.020]  My website is www.loosechange911.com.
[08:18.020 --> 08:20.860]  I do a little blog there, and of course you can get the film there.
[08:20.860 --> 08:25.740]  I think you can watch the film in its entirety for free there.
[08:25.740 --> 08:29.540]  That's what I need you guys to do is go out, check out Loose Change.
[08:29.540 --> 08:34.340]  I could really use somebody to write a Wikipedia page for the Final Cut, but more importantly,
[08:34.340 --> 08:38.980]  find the link, email it to everybody, and get the word out about Loose Change Final
[08:38.980 --> 08:39.980]  Cut.
[08:39.980 --> 08:44.620]  I also want to let you know that Alex Jones is going to be presenting his newest film,
[08:44.620 --> 08:50.500]  The 9-11 Chronicles Part 1, Truth Rising, at a couple of screenings, a little pre-screenings,
[08:50.500 --> 08:56.580]  if you will, over at the Alamo Draft House on Saturday, May 17th, and Sunday, May 18th,
[08:56.580 --> 09:00.900]  at 4 p.m. on Saturday and 7 p.m. on Sunday.
[09:00.900 --> 09:04.860]  This really is unlike any other Alex Jones film you've ever seen.
[09:04.860 --> 09:06.140]  It's not voiced by Alex.
[09:06.140 --> 09:07.900]  It's shot cinema verite.
[09:07.900 --> 09:12.540]  It features interviews with Willie Nelson, Rosie O'Donnell, Jesu Ventura, George Carlin,
[09:12.540 --> 09:18.100]  Martin Sheen, confrontations with Bill Clinton, David Rockefeller, Arnold Schwarzenegger,
[09:18.100 --> 09:23.100]  and many, many more, including Gary Hart, Danny Bonaducci, John Gibson's in the film,
[09:23.100 --> 09:29.900]  just a slew of pop culture names, if you will, in both the media and TV and movies, as well
[09:29.900 --> 09:33.900]  as politics, you know, a nice little blend for everybody, if you will.
[09:33.900 --> 09:38.740]  I really hope this movie gets people off their duffs.
[09:38.740 --> 09:42.260]  You know, those who still don't feel like they can affect change, they don't feel like
[09:42.260 --> 09:45.860]  they can make a difference, this movie is going to show you that you can.
[09:45.860 --> 09:50.900]  It's not only going after the exploits of We Are Change and Mark Dice and others, but
[09:50.900 --> 09:58.220]  really to the smaller groups that do the highway blogging, that do the Walmart intercoming,
[09:58.220 --> 10:05.220]  and they go out there and get the message of 9-11 Truth out by any peaceful means necessary.
[10:05.220 --> 10:10.260]  Now, we were just discussing the cops and how outrageous they are, and how they throw
[10:10.260 --> 10:15.300]  you in jail now, if you don't have a turn signal, and even if the police chief thinks
[10:15.300 --> 10:19.860]  it's absolutely ludicrous, he's going to defend you, and say, we need to look into
[10:19.860 --> 10:24.420]  it more, and say, oh, he's one of my good cops, and he's well within the law to do
[10:24.420 --> 10:25.420]  that.
[10:25.420 --> 10:29.340]  Well, it should be no surprise that Tuesday night, they killed yet another guy with a
[10:29.340 --> 10:33.020]  taser, guys fighting with his wife, what happens?
[10:33.020 --> 10:37.300]  He gets tased, he goes unconscious, and that's it.
[10:37.300 --> 10:39.180]  They can't revive him.
[10:39.180 --> 10:43.820]  You come for a domestic dispute, you leave in a body bag, isn't that nice?
[10:43.820 --> 10:46.740]  That's golden, if you will.
[10:46.740 --> 10:49.740]  Before I get into the economy, I'm just going to read part of this article about the Philly
[10:49.740 --> 10:55.500]  cops, cop beating a motorist on video, this one's from Kurt Nemo.
[10:55.500 --> 10:58.740]  Yet another instance of cops acting like predatory pack animals.
[10:58.740 --> 11:02.020]  It should be obvious by now that the police are out of control.
[11:02.020 --> 11:05.740]  A parasitical force unleashed on society at large.
[11:05.740 --> 11:09.220]  Cops no longer help granny across the street, or respond to a burglary.
[11:09.220 --> 11:13.740]  Cops are like the Crips, Bloods, and Mara Salvatra, another violent street gang, but
[11:13.740 --> 11:16.020]  one armed and supported by the state.
[11:16.020 --> 11:19.740]  A half dozen police officers kicked and beat three men pulled from a car during a traffic
[11:19.740 --> 11:24.900]  stop as a TV helicopter taped the confrontation, reports the Associated Press.
[11:24.900 --> 11:27.580]  It's more than a half a dozen, it's at least a dozen.
[11:27.580 --> 11:30.260]  And it's probably a little bit more than it might even be a baker's dozen.
[11:30.260 --> 11:35.820]  Might even be 18 guys, I'm not sure I need to, they keep coming on the scene.
[11:35.820 --> 11:41.380]  The video shot by WTXFTV shows three police cars stopping a car Monday, two days after
[11:41.380 --> 11:45.380]  a city officer was shot to death, responding to a bank robbery.
[11:45.380 --> 11:47.740]  You see how they try to incorporate both together?
[11:47.740 --> 11:54.060]  Oh, well, we only beat these guys up because somebody got shot two days ago.
[11:54.060 --> 11:57.800]  Sure these aren't the same guys, and we really didn't have any reason to suspect that they
[11:57.800 --> 12:03.740]  were involved in the bank robbery, but they were a color we didn't like.
[12:03.740 --> 12:07.540]  In other words, after a fellow gang member was shot and killed protecting the bank,
[12:07.540 --> 12:11.420]  the largest gang in Philadelphia, won revenge and blood.
[12:11.420 --> 12:14.420]  Of course that's the real job of the cops.
[12:14.420 --> 12:19.100]  Black banks, not the public at large, considered the enemy.
[12:19.100 --> 12:22.000]  The tape shows about a dozen officers gathering around the vehicle.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.940]  About a half dozen officers hold two of the men on the ground.
[12:24.940 --> 12:28.060]  Both are kicked repeatedly, while one is seen being punched.
[12:28.060 --> 12:30.260]  One also appears to be struck with a baton.
[12:30.260 --> 12:34.140]  Not appears to be struck with a baton, the dude gets the baton out and starts wailing
[12:34.140 --> 12:35.140]  on him.
[12:35.140 --> 12:37.940]  Doesn't appear that way, okay?
[12:37.940 --> 12:39.540]  It happened.
[12:39.540 --> 12:41.120]  Appears to be struck with a baton.
[12:41.120 --> 12:46.540]  The guy's swinging the baton like it's a Louisville slugger, are you kidding me?
[12:46.540 --> 12:49.900]  On the surface it certainly does not look good in terms of the amount of force that
[12:49.900 --> 12:54.540]  was used, police commissioner Charles Ramsey said, but we don't want to rush to judgment.
[12:54.540 --> 12:59.180]  Yeah, let's not rush to judgment after we watch the video of these guys getting beat
[12:59.180 --> 13:06.300]  to a bloody pulp by officers who are soccer-kicking them and wielding batons, and they have the
[13:06.300 --> 13:07.300]  dogs out too.
[13:07.300 --> 13:09.460]  Yeah, let's not rush to judgment.
[13:09.460 --> 13:11.220]  Let's not believe our own eyes.
[13:11.220 --> 13:13.420]  No, of course not.
[13:13.420 --> 13:16.900]  Even though the video plainly shows there was absolutely no reason for members of the
[13:16.900 --> 13:22.820]  police gang to savagely beat the three hapless people pictured, yeah, no reason at all.
[13:22.820 --> 13:26.120]  The officers were responding to a report of a shooting nearby, police said.
[13:26.120 --> 13:29.460]  It was not immediately clear what preceded the confrontation.
[13:29.460 --> 13:33.380]  So again, they used two separate excuses, one, the bank robbery where somebody was killed
[13:33.380 --> 13:37.340]  two days ago, and now it's not that, oh, they're responding to another shooting.
[13:37.340 --> 13:41.980]  See, if they were really responding to a shooting and they thought these guys had guns, there's
[13:41.980 --> 13:45.540]  no way it would have went down the way it did.
[13:45.540 --> 13:47.420]  Cops don't just bum rush a car with guns, folks.
[13:47.420 --> 13:49.440]  They don't want to get shot in the face.
[13:49.440 --> 13:53.260]  What they do is they surround the car, they pull their guns, and then they get everybody
[13:53.260 --> 13:54.260]  out of the vehicle slowly.
[13:54.260 --> 13:55.780]  That's not what happened here.
[13:55.780 --> 14:00.260]  They stopped their cars, they got out, they covered them, and then they rushed the car.
[14:00.260 --> 14:03.300]  It was never a question that these guys were going to give up.
[14:03.300 --> 14:07.500]  Now they came out with their hands up on their bellies, man.
[14:07.500 --> 14:14.860]  Oh, man, I really hope their lawyers is good times because they need a good lawyer.
[14:14.860 --> 14:17.580]  It does not matter what preceded the confrontation.
[14:17.580 --> 14:19.900]  As it is obvious, the motorists were not a threat.
[14:19.900 --> 14:23.300]  Once upon a time, cops handcuffed and arrested people accused of crimes.
[14:23.300 --> 14:25.140]  Now they are beaten to a pulp.
[14:25.140 --> 14:28.580]  We don't take into consideration the emotions of the police officers when it comes to discharge
[14:28.580 --> 14:29.780]  with their duties.
[14:29.780 --> 14:34.060]  Their emotional state, being tired, doesn't justify what's on the video, said D. Scott
[14:34.060 --> 14:37.580]  Perine, an attorney who represents the three men seen in the video.
[14:37.580 --> 14:41.420]  He said one of the clients suffered a wealth on his head the size of a baseball, and one
[14:41.420 --> 14:43.540]  of his legs was seriously injured.
[14:43.540 --> 14:47.500]  He didn't know the extent of any of the injuries of the other two men, of course, man.
[14:47.500 --> 14:53.700]  Dude, we have video now of a police officer dumping a person who's crippled out of their
[14:53.700 --> 14:54.940]  wheelchair.
[14:54.940 --> 14:58.540]  When the guy's like, look, I can't stand up, he's like, you're going to stand up.
[14:58.540 --> 15:01.180]  His legs are like crimped over.
[15:01.180 --> 15:04.460]  He tosses him on the ground.
[15:04.460 --> 15:09.340]  I mean, it would be obvious to any thinking human being at any level of age that this
[15:09.340 --> 15:12.140]  man cannot walk and cannot get up out of his wheelchair.
[15:12.140 --> 15:14.820]  His legs are bow-legged.
[15:14.820 --> 15:15.820]  They're skinny.
[15:15.820 --> 15:19.300]  They don't look like they've moved in decades.
[15:19.300 --> 15:20.380]  And what's this guy do?
[15:20.380 --> 15:21.380]  He just tosses them.
[15:21.380 --> 15:23.100]  A little tossy.
[15:23.100 --> 15:25.100]  I think that that guy actually got in trouble.
[15:25.100 --> 15:26.740]  Well, it's about time.
[15:26.740 --> 15:28.300]  I mean, God.
[15:28.300 --> 15:31.260]  These guys really, they really need to be gone after.
[15:31.260 --> 15:32.660]  We have to make a point of this.
[15:32.660 --> 15:35.340]  You need to send this video out to all your friends and family.
[15:35.340 --> 15:38.740]  Be like, look at what these jackboot cops are doing.
[15:38.740 --> 15:44.340]  You know, if that wasn't bad enough, I had Bob Chapman on yesterday, and we talked economy.
[15:44.340 --> 15:49.260]  Well, here's a little economic news that no one seems to be talking about, but it's
[15:49.260 --> 15:50.260]  brand new.
[15:50.260 --> 15:57.820]  CNN is now reporting that steel is going to replace copper in pennies.
[15:57.820 --> 16:03.060]  Now, you know, like I said before, you know, I've said this actually on my other show,
[16:03.060 --> 16:07.300]  it now takes a penny and a half to actually create a penny.
[16:07.300 --> 16:10.660]  So you're paying 50% more to make this penny now.
[16:10.660 --> 16:11.660]  It's pretty ridiculous.
[16:11.660 --> 16:12.660]  Right?
[16:12.660 --> 16:19.140]  Well, they're also going to start taking that out of Nicholas, I think, too.
[16:19.140 --> 16:21.420]  I think that they're actually going to put steel on Nicholas.
[16:21.420 --> 16:22.420]  Let's read it.
[16:22.420 --> 16:24.260]  Further evidence that times are tough.
[16:24.260 --> 16:26.620]  It now costs more than a penny to make a penny.
[16:26.620 --> 16:29.220]  This is new six months ago.
[16:29.220 --> 16:33.300]  And the cost of a nickel is more than seven and a half cents.
[16:33.300 --> 16:38.060]  Surging prices of copper, zinc, and nickel have some in Congress trying to bring back
[16:38.060 --> 16:44.900]  the steel made pennies of World War II and maybe using steel for nickels as well.
[16:44.900 --> 16:49.860]  Copper and nickel prices have tripled since 2003, and the price of zinc has quadrupled,
[16:49.860 --> 16:54.620]  said Representative Lewis Gutierrez, a Democrat from Illinois.
[16:54.620 --> 16:56.900]  The subcommittee oversees the US Mint.
[16:56.900 --> 16:58.700]  Isn't that lovely?
[16:58.700 --> 17:03.700]  Keeping the coin content means contributing to our national debt by almost as much as
[17:03.700 --> 17:07.580]  the coin is worth, Gutierrez says, well, I can't really argue with them there.
[17:07.580 --> 17:10.460]  They've downed the dollar so much that, yeah, of course, it costs seven and a half cents
[17:10.460 --> 17:13.380]  to make a nickel.
[17:13.380 --> 17:17.940]  This is also more evidence that precious metals are actually worth something.
[17:17.940 --> 17:22.180]  If a copper penny is worth 50% more than one of these steel pennies, and really the
[17:22.180 --> 17:26.540]  penny's worth less than a penny, folks, I mean, let's be honest, this money's not backed
[17:26.540 --> 17:27.540]  up by anything.
[17:27.540 --> 17:32.900]  The Federal Reserve is a gangster organization that has no oversight whatsoever, that prints
[17:32.900 --> 17:38.140]  as much money as it wants and gives it to the bank at interest.
[17:38.140 --> 17:40.460]  That's why the banks are starting to cap how much you can take out.
[17:40.460 --> 17:41.460]  It's a big no-no.
[17:41.460 --> 17:44.740]  It's a big red light going off.
[17:44.740 --> 17:51.300]  But the fact they're actually talking about steel to replace copper and pennies and nickels,
[17:51.300 --> 17:52.540]  watch out.
[17:52.540 --> 17:53.980]  Watch out big time.
[17:53.980 --> 17:56.580]  I guess there isn't a better time to get into gold and silver.
[17:56.580 --> 17:57.580]  It's about that time, folks.
[17:57.580 --> 17:59.460]  I mean, our dollar's worth nothing.
[17:59.460 --> 18:04.740]  They're going to replace what our coins are made with with steel because it's cheaper.
[18:04.740 --> 18:06.020]  I mean, what's next?
[18:06.020 --> 18:07.620]  Well, I'll tell you what's next.
[18:07.620 --> 18:12.780]  It's probably a unified currency in the next five to 10 years or an attempt at one between
[18:12.780 --> 18:14.540]  us, Mexico, and Canada.
[18:14.540 --> 18:18.900]  I had a caller call in yesterday and asked, what's all this about?
[18:18.900 --> 18:24.580]  Why is it that we have this North American Union agreement?
[18:24.580 --> 18:26.780]  Why do we have this Central American Free Trade Agreement?
[18:26.780 --> 18:28.700]  What's this all about?
[18:28.700 --> 18:29.860]  Why is our dollar going down?
[18:29.860 --> 18:31.060]  What are they trying to do?
[18:31.060 --> 18:35.060]  I told them, look, our dollar used to be worth way more than the euro.
[18:35.060 --> 18:37.220]  It was like a buck to 75 cents.
[18:37.220 --> 18:38.580]  This is pre-911.
[18:38.580 --> 18:43.860]  Now it's worked its way to a buck to a buck 41, so we're almost 50% under the euro.
[18:43.860 --> 18:45.100]  Then you look at Canada.
[18:45.100 --> 18:50.140]  Well, our dollar used to be worth to there like 80 cents, maybe 85, sometimes 90, but
[18:50.140 --> 18:51.980]  we were still worth more.
[18:51.980 --> 18:54.340]  Now the Canadian dollar is worth a little more than ours.
[18:54.340 --> 18:57.740]  It's like a dollar five to our dollar.
[18:57.740 --> 19:01.900]  How is it that Canada's currency is worth more than ours?
[19:01.900 --> 19:02.900]  Think about it.
[19:02.900 --> 19:03.900]  What do they export?
[19:03.900 --> 19:04.900]  Fish and wood?
[19:04.900 --> 19:09.700]  I mean, we're the greatest military industrial complex nation in the world.
[19:09.700 --> 19:13.900]  We're supposed to have the best economy in the world.
[19:13.900 --> 19:15.900]  Somehow Canada's money is worth more.
[19:15.900 --> 19:18.620]  Seriously, they don't even have a real military.
[19:18.620 --> 19:20.140]  Wake up.
[19:20.140 --> 19:22.180]  So I said, hey, that's part of the plan.
[19:22.180 --> 19:27.460]  That's why you see members of Canadian Parliament actually going up and saying, hey, let's put
[19:27.460 --> 19:29.420]  the dollar on parity with our loony.
[19:29.420 --> 19:30.420]  That's their dollar coin.
[19:30.420 --> 19:33.740]  And then they'll do that with Mexico and we'll have a new currency.
[19:33.740 --> 19:36.940]  We're taking calls over at the Alex Jones show all day long.
[19:36.940 --> 19:38.700]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[19:38.700 --> 19:40.700]  Prismplanet.com is the website.
[19:40.700 --> 19:45.300]  The Alamo Draft House is where you can see the 9-11 Chronicles on May 17th and 18th.
[19:45.300 --> 19:46.300]  Hope to see you there.
[19:46.300 --> 19:47.460]  We'll be back after this.
[19:47.460 --> 19:58.180]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[19:58.180 --> 20:03.020]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the
[20:03.020 --> 20:07.620]  cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[20:07.620 --> 20:12.980]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are
[20:12.980 --> 20:15.540]  totally unnecessary?
[20:15.540 --> 20:18.380]  But now it's cancer's turn to die.
[20:18.380 --> 20:24.060]  With laced med inks, patented methodology, without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging
[20:24.060 --> 20:30.020]  radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse
[20:30.020 --> 20:33.300]  side effects at our physician's office.
[20:33.300 --> 20:35.620]  Laser technology at its best.

[20:49.580 --> 20:54.580]  Call 702-953-0267.
[20:54.580 --> 20:58.820]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[20:58.820 --> 21:03.300]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[21:03.300 --> 21:05.860]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[21:05.860 --> 21:09.340]  Could their objective be world domination?
[21:09.340 --> 21:12.500]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[21:12.500 --> 21:18.420]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[21:18.420 --> 21:22.860]  of humanity is at hand.
[21:22.860 --> 21:28.300]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[21:28.300 --> 21:32.180]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[21:32.180 --> 21:34.860]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[21:34.860 --> 21:35.860]  Most people have no idea.
[21:35.860 --> 21:36.860]  They're not after money.
[21:36.860 --> 21:37.860]  They have all the money they need.
[21:37.860 --> 21:38.860]  They're after power.
[21:38.860 --> 21:39.860]  That's their affidavit.

[21:47.620 --> 21:48.620]  In-game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[21:48.620 --> 21:49.620]  You have been warned.
[21:49.620 --> 21:57.980]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced
[21:57.980 --> 21:59.300]  alkaline environment.
[21:59.300 --> 22:04.620]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[22:04.620 --> 22:09.060]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention
[22:09.060 --> 22:10.240]  of disease.
[22:10.240 --> 22:14.860]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and
[22:14.860 --> 22:15.940]  loss of weight.
[22:15.940 --> 22:18.940]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[22:18.940 --> 22:22.180]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[22:22.180 --> 22:26.100]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[22:26.100 --> 22:30.460]  That accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[22:30.460 --> 22:31.460]  it.
[22:31.460 --> 22:32.460]  Do your part.
[22:32.460 --> 22:34.940]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.

[22:50.380 --> 22:52.900]  Again that's alkavision.com.
[22:52.900 --> 22:56.980]  Our beloved republic is on her knees, the forces of globalism are destroying national
[22:56.980 --> 23:00.940]  sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[23:00.940 --> 23:03.980]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[23:03.980 --> 23:08.220]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new
[23:08.220 --> 23:09.740]  world order master plan.
[23:09.740 --> 23:13.980]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[23:13.980 --> 23:19.140]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[23:19.140 --> 23:24.660]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information, all 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded

[23:38.940 --> 23:39.940]  and so much more.
[23:39.940 --> 23:45.820]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free, join PrisonPlanet.tv, burn the info
[23:45.820 --> 23:51.260]  bombs to disc, put them on the file sharing networks, bring down the new world order.
[23:51.260 --> 23:52.260]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[23:52.260 --> 24:18.260]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss, another flashing
[24:18.260 --> 24:23.260]  light.
[24:23.260 --> 24:30.700]  Alright folks, we are back, it's the Alex Jones show, and I just want to let you know
[24:30.700 --> 24:35.580]  that Alex Jones presents the latest weapon in the Info Warrior arsenal, the 9-Eleven
[24:35.580 --> 24:38.340]  Chronicles Part 1 Truth Rising.
[24:38.340 --> 24:41.940]  This film follows the growing momentum of the 9-Eleven Truth movement as people throughout
[24:41.940 --> 24:45.500]  the world take action against their globalist masters.
[24:45.500 --> 24:49.540]  Not unlike anything you have ever experienced from Alex Jones' Cinema Verite style, this
[24:49.540 --> 24:54.020]  masterpiece not only exposes the mistreatment of our 9-Eleven heroes, but also shows how
[24:54.020 --> 24:58.700]  a growing number of people around the world are questioning the official version of events
[24:58.700 --> 25:00.180]  that day.
[25:00.180 --> 25:03.580]  Featuring interviews with Willie Nelson, Rosie O'Donnell, Jesse Ventura, George Carlin,
[25:03.580 --> 25:08.300]  Martin Sheen, as well as confrontations with many political figures, including Bill Clinton,
[25:08.300 --> 25:11.580]  David Rockefeller, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[25:11.580 --> 25:14.380]  And that's just the short list folks, it's a huge list.
[25:14.380 --> 25:20.140]  And we hope to see you there on Saturday and Sunday over at the Alamo Draft House, Saturday
[25:20.140 --> 25:25.300]  screening May 17th is going to be at 4pm, Sunday screening on May 18th is going to be
[25:25.300 --> 25:29.940]  at 7pm, get tickets while you can, Alex is going to be there I believe, as the show is
[25:29.940 --> 25:33.820]  part of the Celebrity Guest Signature series, how lovely.
[25:33.820 --> 25:38.180]  Alright, I said I would take your calls today and let's start doing it, let's go to our
[25:38.180 --> 25:42.260]  first caller of the day, Carl and Montreal, Carl are you with me?
[25:42.260 --> 25:43.260]  Yeah, hi.
[25:43.260 --> 25:44.260]  Hello.
[25:44.260 --> 25:45.740]  Thanks for taking my call.
[25:45.740 --> 25:49.460]  I was listening to your show when it was on weekdays, and I guess you're on Sunday now,
[25:49.460 --> 25:50.460]  right?
[25:50.460 --> 25:51.460]  Yeah, yeah, I am on Sunday.
[25:51.460 --> 25:55.620]  That's right, I do a little radio show on GCN myself, Sunday from 6 to 8 central.
[25:55.620 --> 26:00.100]  Well, I like to see this video, but I'm up here, I'm an American, I've called you before
[26:00.100 --> 26:05.100]  on your show, locked up here at Immigration Detention Center for about a year now, because
[26:05.100 --> 26:09.900]  I was arrested by the Secret Service in the US for about comments, satirical writings
[26:09.900 --> 26:12.900]  and drawings related to the Bush family.
[26:12.900 --> 26:22.340]  My case is on the internet now, I have a website, www.freecarl.com, F-R-E-E-C-A-R-L.com.
[26:22.340 --> 26:28.220]  It talks about my case if anyone's interested or donating to help my legal fund, but I'm
[26:28.220 --> 26:32.180]  kind of a unique situation because I have a lot of people coming from other countries
[26:32.180 --> 26:38.780]  who claim refugee or asylum in Canada, and I've made quite a few conversations with people
[26:38.780 --> 26:45.860]  about 9-11, and it seems people seem to be somewhat receptive here, and I've been using
[26:45.860 --> 26:52.220]  my situation also to talk to my lawyer here in Canada, my immigration lawyer, about 9-11
[26:52.220 --> 26:56.780]  truth, and try to get the word out, even though I'm detained, and I'm trying to do what I
[26:56.780 --> 26:57.780]  can to help you.
[26:57.780 --> 27:00.980]  Now, you're detained still in Canada right now, that's where you are right now?
[27:00.980 --> 27:01.980]  Yes.
[27:01.980 --> 27:02.980]  Okay.
[27:02.980 --> 27:07.220]  And my website has, it's being worked on, but it's forwarded to the other site that
[27:07.220 --> 27:12.820]  has some of my court documents, my lawyer's arguments, and other material, if you look
[27:12.820 --> 27:17.220]  at www.freecarl.com, F-R-E-E-C-A-R-L.com.
[27:17.220 --> 27:18.220]  Yep.
[27:18.220 --> 27:19.220]  All right, folks.
[27:19.220 --> 27:21.820]  Well, you can check that out, and it's freecarl.com.
[27:21.820 --> 27:23.340]  All right, let's go take another call.
[27:23.340 --> 27:24.940]  Let's take Randy in Michigan.
[27:24.940 --> 27:25.940]  Randy, are you there?
[27:25.940 --> 27:26.940]  How's it going?
[27:26.940 --> 27:27.940]  Good, man.
[27:27.940 --> 27:28.940]  How are you doing?
[27:28.940 --> 27:29.940]  I'm not too bad.
[27:29.940 --> 27:33.060]  I was just calling in response to the thing you said about the police harassment.
[27:33.060 --> 27:38.660]  I actually was harassed, it would be yesterday morning, from the Warren, Michigan police.
[27:38.660 --> 27:40.580]  My girlfriend and I were coming back from a show.
[27:40.580 --> 27:45.140]  They pulled us over, police officer approaches each side of the vehicle, tells her to get
[27:45.140 --> 27:46.140]  out of the car.
[27:46.140 --> 27:50.180]  They're like, you know, he says that he shouts it, and I'm like freaking out, you know, and
[27:50.180 --> 27:52.140]  well, anyways, it wasn't that big of a deal.
[27:52.140 --> 27:56.380]  I guess my license plate, it was hard for them to read my license plate because I drive
[27:56.380 --> 28:01.140]  a rusty truck and the tail hitch was blocking a number on the plate.
[28:01.140 --> 28:05.500]  Well, he proceeded, he put me against the truck, you know, he wasn't pushing me, but
[28:05.500 --> 28:07.580]  he searched me, frisked me.
[28:07.580 --> 28:10.900]  They told my girlfriend to get in the cop car, and she's crying because she thinks she's
[28:10.900 --> 28:11.900]  going to get arrested.
[28:11.900 --> 28:13.580]  He goes, I'm not going to arrest you.
[28:13.580 --> 28:14.740]  I'm not going to do it.
[28:14.740 --> 28:19.220]  He's like, I don't got the cuffs out, just chill out, and he's like yelling at her.
[28:19.220 --> 28:22.860]  And anyways, he tells her, you know, you've been drinking, and he flashes the flashlight
[28:22.860 --> 28:26.580]  in her eyes, and you know, for one thing, she's the passenger.
[28:26.580 --> 28:29.220]  Yeah, it doesn't matter if she's been drinking or not.
[28:29.220 --> 28:30.220]  Right.
[28:30.220 --> 28:33.660]  And then like, well, and she's like, I have a lazy eye too, which she does, she's legally
[28:33.660 --> 28:36.580]  blind in one eye, and, and he goes, that doesn't matter.
[28:36.580 --> 28:38.220]  And anyways, they couldn't find anything on me.
[28:38.220 --> 28:40.900]  I knew I have a fourth amendment right in all that.
[28:40.900 --> 28:43.780]  And I said, you know, that whatever, I didn't even stop him from searching my truck because
[28:43.780 --> 28:47.940]  he probably, you know, arrest me for, no, you probably go to jail downtown, right, right
[28:47.940 --> 28:50.140]  away as soon as you start challenging the officers.
[28:50.140 --> 28:53.020]  That's why it's so important, man, to have a camera in your car.
[28:53.020 --> 28:57.940]  I know Alex has posted a couple now where the guy has a hidden camera in his dashboard.
[28:57.940 --> 29:01.380]  He literally tells the guy like five times, no, you can't search my car.
[29:01.380 --> 29:02.820]  There is no probable cause.
[29:02.820 --> 29:06.780]  They just rip him out, cuff him, bring him to jail and search his car anyway.
[29:06.780 --> 29:10.300]  But at least he has that ammunition afterwards and say, look, I didn't ever, I didn't ever
[29:10.300 --> 29:12.100]  give him permission to get in my car.
[29:12.100 --> 29:13.180]  It's my fourth amendment, right?
[29:13.180 --> 29:14.180]  He did it anyway.
[29:14.180 --> 29:16.580]  It was a legal search and seizure, and he brought me to jail.
[29:16.580 --> 29:17.580]  Hang on, Randy.
[29:17.580 --> 29:19.300]  We're going to come back to you on the other side.
[29:19.300 --> 29:45.140]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[29:45.140 --> 29:46.420]  We're on the march.
[29:46.420 --> 29:49.140]  The empire's on the run.
[29:49.140 --> 29:55.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:55.140 --> 30:00.180]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[30:00.180 --> 30:04.020]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[30:04.020 --> 30:08.900]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[30:08.900 --> 30:12.500]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[30:12.500 --> 30:17.020]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[30:17.020 --> 30:18.020]  across America.
[30:18.020 --> 30:22.140]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[30:22.140 --> 30:25.620]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[30:25.620 --> 30:26.620]  healthier I feel.
[30:26.620 --> 30:29.340]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[30:29.340 --> 30:34.540]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventive

[31:34.260 --> 31:38.060]  But it wasn't the wind that made the mournful cry, it was a man.
[31:38.060 --> 31:42.140]  A man named Lou Wetzel, the son of a Swiss immigrant.
[31:42.140 --> 31:46.580]  As a young boy, Lou and his brother had been captured and abused by the Indians and made
[31:46.580 --> 31:48.460]  their slave.
[31:48.460 --> 31:54.220]  Eventually he escaped and made a vow and made it his life work to kill Indians.
[31:54.220 --> 32:00.900]  At age 16 he took on three Indian braves with one single shot black powder muzzle loader.
[32:00.900 --> 32:06.100]  But he had a secret weapon like ability that he tried that day, and it worked.
[32:06.100 --> 32:10.260]  No one else had ever tried it or could ever do it, but he did.
[32:10.260 --> 32:13.340]  And from that day forward he killed Indians.
[32:13.340 --> 32:18.580]  He in his lifetime single-handedly killed over 2,000 Indians in the western part of
[32:18.580 --> 32:19.580]  Virginia.

[33:32.740 --> 33:34.740]  The Ace of Spades!
[33:34.740 --> 33:36.740]  Little Motorhead coming at you.
[33:36.740 --> 33:39.740]  The Alex Jones Show. We are back live.
[33:39.740 --> 33:41.740]  And I want to go back to Randy and Michigan.
[33:41.740 --> 33:43.740]  You were telling us that you were pulled over.
[33:43.740 --> 33:45.740]  Cop illegally searches your car.
[33:45.740 --> 33:47.740]  You know you don't have anything.
[33:47.740 --> 33:49.740]  What happens next, Randy?
[33:49.740 --> 33:52.740]  Well, he searches for 10 minutes after he told me to stand in front of his car.
[33:52.740 --> 33:54.740]  And the other officer was in there proceeding to harass her.
[33:54.740 --> 33:56.740]  You know, asking her questions.
[33:56.740 --> 33:58.740]  Well, who's this guy you're with?
[33:58.740 --> 34:00.740]  And she's like, it's my boyfriend. What's his name?
[34:00.740 --> 34:02.740]  She's like, well, Randy.
[34:02.740 --> 34:04.740]  And he's like, well, how long have you been dating him?
[34:04.740 --> 34:06.740]  I mean, he's just an animal.
[34:06.740 --> 34:08.740]  I mean, he's not touching her or anything or hitting her.
[34:08.740 --> 34:10.740]  But he's just aggressive.
[34:10.740 --> 34:12.740]  Well, you're guilty until proven innocent, man.
[34:12.740 --> 34:14.740]  They're trying to get you to mess your stories up.
[34:14.740 --> 34:17.740]  Like there's some big conspiracy in your rusted out truck, right?
[34:17.740 --> 34:19.740]  Right. And I wanted to fight it.
[34:19.740 --> 34:22.740]  And I talked to my officer friend who works for the Lansing police.
[34:22.740 --> 34:25.740]  And anyways, he told me, he goes, man, it's not even worth it.
[34:25.740 --> 34:27.740]  He goes, they're going to videotape you as you sit in a room.
[34:27.740 --> 34:30.740]  And if you have one like flaw to your story and if they videotape it,
[34:30.740 --> 34:32.740]  you're going to get prosecuted.
[34:32.740 --> 34:34.740]  And I'm like, well, I better not fight it then.
[34:34.740 --> 34:36.740]  Well, that's what they want you to do, man.
[34:36.740 --> 34:38.740]  I'd encourage you to fight it every time.
[34:38.740 --> 34:40.740]  You know, I know a lot of cops that are going to tell me the same thing.
[34:40.740 --> 34:42.740]  I'm really good friends with the cops in my town in New York.
[34:42.740 --> 34:45.740]  And, you know, there's a couple of them I have beers with,
[34:45.740 --> 34:47.740]  but the other ones I just joke around with.
[34:47.740 --> 34:50.740]  And it just sucks that it's that corrupt that they're even going to tell you,
[34:50.740 --> 34:52.740]  look, we're going to cover it up for the other guy.
[34:52.740 --> 34:53.740]  We're going to try to make you look stupid.
[34:53.740 --> 34:55.740]  And then we're going to prosecute you.
[34:55.740 --> 34:56.740]  Right.
[34:56.740 --> 34:58.740]  Yeah, it's unreal, but dude, you've got to fight it.
[34:58.740 --> 35:00.740]  Like, listen, I hear you on that.
[35:00.740 --> 35:02.740]  It's almost more trouble than it's worth sometimes, Randy.
[35:02.740 --> 35:04.740]  But I feel like we have to stand up each and every time.
[35:04.740 --> 35:06.740]  I thank you for the call, man.
[35:06.740 --> 35:09.740]  Let's move on to Sean in Canada.
[35:09.740 --> 35:11.740]  Sean, are you with us?
[35:11.740 --> 35:12.740]  Hello.
[35:12.740 --> 35:13.740]  Hey, how are you doing, man?
[35:13.740 --> 35:16.740]  Jason, let me just say that you do an incredible job on the show.
[35:16.740 --> 35:17.740]  Thanks, man.
[35:17.740 --> 35:18.740]  Appreciate it.
[35:18.740 --> 35:20.740]  I listen to Alex all the time and listen to you.
[35:20.740 --> 35:21.740]  It's like a whole different show.
[35:21.740 --> 35:22.740]  It's awesome.
[35:22.740 --> 35:28.740]  I wanted to see if you guys know anything about the U.S. soldier that was killed
[35:28.740 --> 35:34.740]  in a military training exercise here in Alberta, Canada.
[35:34.740 --> 35:36.740]  No, but tell me about it.
[35:36.740 --> 35:41.740]  I think it was three days ago, they're holding, I think the name of the operation
[35:41.740 --> 35:45.740]  is called Maple Guardian or Guardian Maple, something like that.
[35:45.740 --> 35:50.740]  And it's a collaboration between American and Canadian forces.
[35:50.740 --> 35:56.740]  And what they've done is they've rebuilt, they've recreated an Afghanistan village
[35:56.740 --> 35:59.740]  in southern Alberta, and they're training the troops there.
[35:59.740 --> 36:02.740]  And I guess they say there's no live ammunition,
[36:02.740 --> 36:09.740]  and no live effects for anybody to get killed, but one of the American soldiers was actually
[36:09.740 --> 36:10.740]  killed like three days ago.
[36:10.740 --> 36:11.740]  So what are they doing?
[36:11.740 --> 36:13.740]  They only, they set up a village, and then what do they do?
[36:13.740 --> 36:15.740]  And they're doing basically basic occupation.
[36:15.740 --> 36:16.740]  They're going in and doing sweeps.
[36:16.740 --> 36:21.740]  Yeah, I think basic training occupation, how to storm a village with helicopter support.
[36:21.740 --> 36:26.740]  And I mean, you guys have, I think, 10 or 20 helicopters up here, and you guys are providing
[36:26.740 --> 36:29.740]  support for ground troops doing these exercises.
[36:29.740 --> 36:30.740]  Well, here's the thing, man.
[36:30.740 --> 36:33.740]  They're saying that it's set up like an Afghanistan village.
[36:33.740 --> 36:35.740]  My guess is it's probably not.
[36:35.740 --> 36:39.740]  It's probably set up like a Western village, like a Canadian or an American village,
[36:39.740 --> 36:41.740]  for an actual domestic takeover.
[36:41.740 --> 36:42.740]  I mean, let's be real.
[36:42.740 --> 36:48.740]  Well, I think, didn't they just practice and complete the complete domestic takeover
[36:48.740 --> 36:50.740]  in a polygamous village in Texas?
[36:50.740 --> 36:55.740]  Yeah, they, well, I had a woman on yesterday who was part of not that polygamous village,
[36:55.740 --> 36:59.740]  but another, and we were discussing that situation in Texas.
[36:59.740 --> 37:04.740]  And I'd almost say it's a little bit different because they didn't even use color of law.
[37:04.740 --> 37:05.740]  In other words, they didn't get a warrant.
[37:05.740 --> 37:06.740]  They didn't call anybody.
[37:06.740 --> 37:09.740]  They just went in and took those people.
[37:09.740 --> 37:11.740]  Yeah, which is absolutely more frightening.
[37:11.740 --> 37:15.740]  And it does seem kind of military style since there is no video of the actual, you know,
[37:15.740 --> 37:17.740]  the actual, you know, assault on these people.
[37:17.740 --> 37:22.740]  No, but I have seen videos of like tanks with the word sheriff written on them.
[37:22.740 --> 37:23.740]  Oh, that's lovely.
[37:23.740 --> 37:28.740]  Well, I mean, it's not there for an invasion in Afghanistan.
[37:28.740 --> 37:31.740]  If they want to do a mock invasion of Afghanistan, they want to do training.
[37:31.740 --> 37:35.740]  They're going to A, do it on a training on a military base or B, they're going to do
[37:35.740 --> 37:39.740]  it overseas somewhere in Pakistan with our buddies, you know, where they're stationed.
[37:39.740 --> 37:40.740]  You would think so.
[37:40.740 --> 37:42.740]  Hey, we're like, do it with somewhere that's actually going to help you.
[37:42.740 --> 37:48.740]  But here in the desert terrain and American forces to like, I don't know, on their own soil.
[37:48.740 --> 37:50.740]  Sean, I'm with you a hundred percent.
[37:50.740 --> 37:51.740]  I thank you for the info.
[37:51.740 --> 37:53.740]  We're going to jump to the next caller.
[37:53.740 --> 37:55.740]  Let's go to John in Illinois.
[37:55.740 --> 37:56.740]  John, are you with me?
[37:56.740 --> 38:00.740]  I am Jason and I saw the premiere in New York, a loose change, final cut.
[38:00.740 --> 38:01.740]  You guys did a great job.
[38:01.740 --> 38:02.740]  It is a different film.
[38:02.740 --> 38:04.740]  Everybody out there listening.
[38:04.740 --> 38:07.740]  So if you think it ain't go on, get yourself a copy.
[38:07.740 --> 38:08.740]  Oh, thank you, man.
[38:08.740 --> 38:09.740]  I appreciate that.
[38:09.740 --> 38:10.740]  Yeah.
[38:10.740 --> 38:13.740]  A lot of people think that we, you know, just added 20 minutes to the second edition or
[38:13.740 --> 38:14.740]  something like that.
[38:14.740 --> 38:16.740]  But really it is a completely new film.
[38:16.740 --> 38:21.740]  It really eviscerates the official version of events goes after the 9-11 commission especially.
[38:21.740 --> 38:25.740]  And, you know, I haven't seen the debunkers come out and try to attack this one as much
[38:25.740 --> 38:27.740]  as the second edition at all.
[38:27.740 --> 38:28.740]  Yeah.
[38:28.740 --> 38:34.740]  It's very hard to, on another matter, grassroots activism.
[38:34.740 --> 38:38.740]  Everybody within the reach of this voice, please get out there and get active.
[38:38.740 --> 38:40.740]  We've done this here around Chicago.
[38:40.740 --> 38:46.740]  We started a couple of groups, my own group, DuPage911Truth.org.
[38:46.740 --> 38:51.740]  We're advertising right now on Prison Planet, fourth banner down.
[38:51.740 --> 38:56.740]  We're sponsoring Richard Gage on May 30th, 2008.
[38:56.740 --> 39:01.740]  If you want to get your pre-tickets, go down to the banner, click on it, and support our
[39:01.740 --> 39:02.740]  cause.
[39:02.740 --> 39:03.740]  We need all the help we can get.
[39:03.740 --> 39:05.740]  And it's good you're bringing out Richard Gage.
[39:05.740 --> 39:07.740]  I mean, he gives an excellent presentation.
[39:07.740 --> 39:13.740]  In fact, he gave one in New York where he really breaks down how Building 7 was brought down
[39:13.740 --> 39:14.740]  in the controlled demolition.
[39:14.740 --> 39:19.740]  One of my favorite points in that presentation is when he shows the quote-unquote World Trade
[39:19.740 --> 39:26.740]  Center meteorites, which are an amalgamation of the pulverized concrete and molten metal
[39:26.740 --> 39:32.740]  that form these huge rocks that could have only been formed if the steel didn't indeed melt.
[39:32.740 --> 39:34.740]  That's for sure.
[39:34.740 --> 39:37.740]  I saw Richard Gage there at the theater.
[39:37.740 --> 39:43.740]  I can't remember which night that was, and he was engaged in conversation with you and
[39:43.740 --> 39:47.740]  Dylan, and Richard is a courageous man.
[39:47.740 --> 39:49.740]  I don't think he has his own practice.
[39:49.740 --> 39:51.740]  I think he's working for another firm.
[39:51.740 --> 39:55.740]  And for him to go out on a limb like this is really risking all.
[39:55.740 --> 39:56.740]  Oh, he has risked it all.
[39:56.740 --> 39:58.740]  And yeah, you are correct.
[39:58.740 --> 39:59.740]  He doesn't have his own firm.
[39:59.740 --> 40:01.740]  I'm pretty sure he does freelancing.
[40:01.740 --> 40:03.740]  And he's about all the time.
[40:03.740 --> 40:08.740]  And for him to dedicate so much time to 9-Eleven Truth shows what a good person he is.
[40:08.740 --> 40:11.740]  And he's really, he's put out all the stops, man.
[40:11.740 --> 40:15.740]  He's actually in Alex Jones' new film, The 9-Eleven Chronicles.
[40:15.740 --> 40:20.740]  He's got a little part in there where he basically goes over Building 7 and how it's absolutely
[40:20.740 --> 40:21.740]  a controlled demolition.
[40:21.740 --> 40:23.740]  But you and I both know that, John.
[40:23.740 --> 40:28.740]  I mean, the evidence is so clear that that building was brought down in a controlled manner and covered up.
[40:28.740 --> 40:29.740]  Okay, great.
[40:29.740 --> 40:31.740]  Another reminder.
[40:31.740 --> 40:37.740]  All the Chicago listeners, please go to the banner fourth down from the top prison planet.
[40:37.740 --> 40:38.740]  Get your tickets.
[40:38.740 --> 40:39.740]  Please support Richard Gage.
[40:39.740 --> 40:40.740]  All right.
[40:40.740 --> 40:42.740]  Thank you so much for the call, John.
[40:42.740 --> 40:45.740]  Let's move on to Larry in Indiana.
[40:45.740 --> 40:46.740]  Larry, are you with us?
[40:46.740 --> 40:47.740]  Hello, Jason.
[40:47.740 --> 40:48.740]  How are you doing, man?
[40:48.740 --> 40:49.740]  Very good.
[40:49.740 --> 40:55.740]  I passed out some of your loose change to here as well as 9-Eleven Ripple Effect and others.
[40:55.740 --> 41:00.740]  We even tried to have a public showing here in Indiana.
[41:00.740 --> 41:01.740]  Mixed results.
[41:01.740 --> 41:05.740]  Most people don't want to hear it, but on a personal level, you can give those out.
[41:05.740 --> 41:09.740]  I wanted to point something out for this real important guys.
[41:09.740 --> 41:14.740]  On Friday, in the third hour, Alex Jones had Michael Hoffman on.
[41:14.740 --> 41:20.740]  If you have the access to the archives, I cannot highly recommend enough that you hear this show.
[41:20.740 --> 41:27.740]  Michael went into the involvement of Israel into 9-Eleven and the U.S. Government Affairs.
[41:27.740 --> 41:30.740]  He went into the difference between the Torah and the Talmud.
[41:30.740 --> 41:32.740]  That is the key, folks.
[41:32.740 --> 41:37.740]  I don't know if you know it or not, Jason, but the Talmud is a satanic doctrine, T-A-L-M-U-D,
[41:37.740 --> 41:44.740]  that you've got real pious Hebrew Torah-worshiping Jews, and then you've got these bloodthirsty
[41:44.740 --> 41:49.740]  Zionists that work in our government and run Israel.
[41:49.740 --> 41:52.740]  They're the ones that are trying to get us into a war with Iran.
[41:52.740 --> 41:56.740]  They're the ones that are taking the guns from the veterans in this country.
[41:56.740 --> 41:59.740]  We're talking Schumer, Feinstein, Boxer, et cetera.
[41:59.740 --> 42:05.740]  They're the ones that are giving our troops to practice, putting us in camps, and to kill us.
[42:05.740 --> 42:08.740]  I've read Codex Magica.
[42:08.740 --> 42:13.740]  I've been interested in Tex-Mar stuff for a number of years.
[42:13.740 --> 42:17.740]  I'm not 100% into everything, but I go and check everything out.
[42:17.740 --> 42:21.740]  Actually, in my new movie, Fabled Enemies, I am going to go into Israel's role into 9-Eleven.
[42:21.740 --> 42:24.740]  I know it hasn't been in any of the other documentaries.
[42:24.740 --> 42:28.740]  I'm really going to go into not only the dancing Israelis who were detained,
[42:28.740 --> 42:32.740]  or the Israelis that were detained at the George Washington Bridge with the explosives,
[42:32.740 --> 42:35.740]  but also into the Fox News report of how it all works.
[42:35.740 --> 42:38.740]  How does an international spiring like this work?
[42:38.740 --> 42:41.740]  Well, they use companies like Amdox and Converse,
[42:41.740 --> 42:45.740]  which have close military-industrial complex ties to the state of Israel,
[42:45.740 --> 42:50.740]  in order to compromise all of these different intelligence organizations.
[42:50.740 --> 42:55.740]  That coupled with the fact that they have dual citizens located in almost every area of our government.
[42:55.740 --> 42:58.740]  People like Michael Schertoff, who at the time of 9-Eleven,
[42:58.740 --> 43:01.740]  was the head of the criminal division at the Attorney General's office,
[43:01.740 --> 43:02.740]  and now-
[43:02.740 --> 43:04.740]  And let Israeli terrorists go.
[43:04.740 --> 43:07.740]  Yeah, oh, absolutely. And now he is the head of Homeland Security.
[43:07.740 --> 43:10.740]  We have another dual citizen out there named Paul Wolfewitz,
[43:10.740 --> 43:12.740]  who is the assistant secretary of defense.
[43:12.740 --> 43:15.740]  I mean, he's really under the radar for most people,
[43:15.740 --> 43:19.740]  but he's one of those guys that writes these policy papers with the PNAC crew.
[43:19.740 --> 43:21.740]  Have a Larry Silverstein.
[43:21.740 --> 43:22.740]  Well, there's another guy.
[43:22.740 --> 43:26.740]  Well, again, the ties to Israel are definitely there,
[43:26.740 --> 43:28.740]  and I'm going to be going over them in the new movie.
[43:28.740 --> 43:30.740]  I hope people check it out. Larry, I thank you for the call.
[43:30.740 --> 43:31.740]  Yep.
[43:31.740 --> 43:34.740]  Let's move on to Justin in New Jersey.
[43:34.740 --> 43:35.740]  Justin, are you with us?
[43:35.740 --> 43:37.740]  Hey, what's going on? How are you doing?
[43:37.740 --> 43:38.740]  Good, man. How are you doing?
[43:38.740 --> 43:40.740]  I'm doing all right.
[43:40.740 --> 43:43.740]  I just got a couple things to comment on.
[43:43.740 --> 43:47.740]  First of all, you're talking about this police state and all this martial law stuff.
[43:47.740 --> 43:55.740]  I actually did a thesis paper on the Rex 84 for my project at Rutgers University here in New Jersey,
[43:55.740 --> 43:58.740]  and I put out a series of posters.
[43:58.740 --> 44:04.740]  Basically, talking about Rex 84 and the different scenarios that will go down to different executive orders.
[44:04.740 --> 44:08.740]  I got the website up. It's rex84.info.
[44:08.740 --> 44:10.740]  I urge y'all to check it out.
[44:10.740 --> 44:12.740]  There's copies of people to print out.
[44:12.740 --> 44:15.740]  Why don't you tell people what Rex 84 is?
[44:15.740 --> 44:18.740]  You and I both know it, but some of our listeners probably don't.
[44:18.740 --> 44:27.740]  Rex 84 was basically the readiness exercises put forth by, I guess you want to call it the Neocons, 1984.
[44:27.740 --> 44:34.740]  Basically, the Bush administration now, and it basically allows for martial law to be enacted within the United States.
[44:34.740 --> 44:39.740]  It's kind of a continuity of government type thing where they're going to round us up and pass into FEMA camps.
[44:39.740 --> 44:41.740]  Yeah, exactly. It is continuity of government.
[44:41.740 --> 44:44.740]  I mean, they've had these things actually since 1962.
[44:44.740 --> 44:47.740]  They've been around for a while, so I just want to kind of...
[44:47.740 --> 44:52.740]  Well, they've absolutely progressed, too, and one of my big points, Justin,
[44:52.740 --> 44:56.740]  that makes me feel really uncomfortable is that in the last few years,
[44:56.740 --> 44:59.740]  they commissioned Halliburton to build these new FEMA camps.
[44:59.740 --> 45:06.740]  Now, Halliburton has since moved their base of operations from the United States to Dubai.
[45:06.740 --> 45:11.740]  So let's say martial law does come, and they start rounding people up, and people get wind of it,
[45:11.740 --> 45:15.740]  and they're like, screw this, I'm not going to any Halliburton FEMA camp, I'm not going.
[45:15.740 --> 45:22.740]  Well, it's going to be awfully hard to go challenge Halliburton when Halliburton isn't in the United States, it's in Dubai.
[45:22.740 --> 45:27.740]  And what's even scarier is that Halliburton, if they ever feel threatened,
[45:27.740 --> 45:33.740]  will just commission more CACI forces or Blackwater forces to be their military,
[45:33.740 --> 45:38.740]  and they'll really have an endless supply of mercenaries to round us up and put us into these camps.
[45:38.740 --> 45:41.740]  That's what really scares me about these continuity of government programs.
[45:41.740 --> 45:45.740]  It completely takes out Congress, it takes out the will of the people,
[45:45.740 --> 45:48.740]  and it puts power into the hands of a few dictators.
[45:48.740 --> 45:52.740]  And folks, that's what happened on 9-11, the continuity of government plan went into effect.
[45:52.740 --> 45:54.740]  We still don't know if it ever went out of effect.
[45:54.740 --> 45:55.740]  This is true.
[45:55.740 --> 45:56.740]  It's scary, man.
[45:56.740 --> 45:59.740]  You know, you try and talk to people about this stuff.
[45:59.740 --> 46:04.740]  For instance, I wrote an English class over there, and for my thesis paper,
[46:04.740 --> 46:07.740]  I was trying to write about 9-11 being an inside job and whatnot,
[46:07.740 --> 46:10.740]  and I was basically told, you can't write it, you can't prove it.
[46:10.740 --> 46:12.740]  It's unparalleled, you can't write that paper.
[46:12.740 --> 46:15.740]  And it is provable, that's the crazy thing, is that you can put out so much evidence
[46:15.740 --> 46:18.740]  that it is obviously not what they told us, and they still won't hear it, man.
[46:18.740 --> 46:21.740]  It's the thought police, it's 1984 all over again.
[46:21.740 --> 46:24.740]  It's really a part of Brave New World because everybody's so drugged up.
[46:24.740 --> 46:26.740]  It's disgusting.
[46:26.740 --> 46:30.740]  I mean, the universities, for instance, they got the mental health facilities over there.
[46:30.740 --> 46:36.740]  You go in there and all you see is posters for a Prozac, all these drugs.
[46:36.740 --> 46:37.740]  It's just ridiculous.
[46:37.740 --> 46:39.740]  Yeah, we are taking him there.
[46:39.740 --> 46:41.740]  They really kill your brain.
[46:41.740 --> 46:43.740]  I got so many friends on that stuff.
[46:43.740 --> 46:45.740]  I urge them all to get off of it.
[46:45.740 --> 46:48.740]  If anybody's on those medications, I urge everybody just drop it now.
[46:48.740 --> 46:50.740]  It'll get you in the air really well.
[46:50.740 --> 46:53.740]  I'm with you, Justin. Thank you so much for the call.
[46:53.740 --> 46:54.740]  Let's move on to the next caller.
[46:54.740 --> 46:56.740]  Let's go to Peter in Alabama.
[46:56.740 --> 46:58.740]  Peter, are you with me?
[46:58.740 --> 46:59.740]  Hey, how are you doing?
[46:59.740 --> 47:00.740]  Good, man. How are you doing?
[47:00.740 --> 47:02.740]  Not bad. It's good to talk to you.
[47:02.740 --> 47:06.740]  I just wanted to say to everybody that the Fed has pushed back the Real ID Act date
[47:06.740 --> 47:11.740]  to December 31, 2009, no longer this month of 2008.
[47:11.740 --> 47:15.740]  Well, I feel like they're going to keep pushing it back as more and more people like yourself
[47:15.740 --> 47:18.740]  keep challenging it and making other people aware about it.
[47:18.740 --> 47:21.740]  All right. Well, that's good. Hopefully it'll never come.
[47:21.740 --> 47:25.740]  Well, yeah, I mean, this is something that people individually have to fight back on a state level.
[47:25.740 --> 47:28.740]  I mean, that's the key is that, you know, we're not going to be able to do this nationally,
[47:28.740 --> 47:32.740]  but if we can get groups together in the state, and it's not that hard to explain to people
[47:32.740 --> 47:34.740]  that this is your papers, please.
[47:34.740 --> 47:37.740]  In fact, I would say a good tool is, I don't know if you've seen these yet,
[47:37.740 --> 47:42.740]  but there's a couple of MTV ads out there which really basically make the point
[47:42.740 --> 47:44.740]  the Holocaust happened to people like us.
[47:44.740 --> 47:46.740]  And one of them takes place in the subway.
[47:46.740 --> 47:49.740]  And basically these guys are all in a subway train all of a sudden.
[47:49.740 --> 47:52.740]  It's men in black uniforms, guns, everybody's separated.
[47:52.740 --> 47:56.740]  They break up a family. They round them up, you know, your papers, please.
[47:56.740 --> 47:58.740]  And then it says the Holocaust happened to people like us.
[47:58.740 --> 48:00.740]  Then another one is, yeah, it's crazy.
[48:00.740 --> 48:04.740]  And then they sweep a house, you know, a normal average every day American family.
[48:04.740 --> 48:07.740]  They sweep a house in under 30 seconds. They get everybody out,
[48:07.740 --> 48:10.740]  and they're put onto a concentration camp truck.
[48:10.740 --> 48:14.740]  And they make the point again, you know, the Holocaust happened to people like us.
[48:14.740 --> 48:18.740]  It's these kind of steps like a national ID card that allows things like that to happen.
[48:18.740 --> 48:21.740]  Well, they're not sweeping my house. I got plenty of 762,
[48:21.740 --> 48:24.740]  but their names on it, they tried to do that unlawfully.
[48:24.740 --> 48:25.740]  Well, that's why we need guns.
[48:25.740 --> 48:28.740]  I mean, honestly, the Second Amendment, like Jesse Wintour, is not there
[48:28.740 --> 48:30.740]  so we can go hunting deer folks.
[48:30.740 --> 48:32.740]  It's to protect us from a tyrannical government.
[48:32.740 --> 48:35.740]  And this government is out of control.
[48:35.740 --> 48:36.740]  And I mean, I live in New York, man.
[48:36.740 --> 48:42.740]  It's so hard to have a firearm outside of a.22 or a shotgun or a rifle, you know, in your home.
[48:42.740 --> 48:46.740]  It's so tough to get a carry permit for a pistol.
[48:46.740 --> 48:49.740]  I mean, you literally have to be either a cop or an ex-military guy
[48:49.740 --> 48:54.740]  or have like a long, long, long line of security personnel or cops recommending you.
[48:54.740 --> 48:55.740]  It's tough, man.
[48:55.740 --> 48:59.740]  It's not like that everywhere in America, but it's like that in places like New York
[48:59.740 --> 49:00.740]  where the population's heavy.
[49:00.740 --> 49:04.740]  I mean, there's eight million people in Manhattan alone.
[49:04.740 --> 49:06.740]  I don't know what's disturbing to me.
[49:06.740 --> 49:07.740]  All right, Peter, I thank you for the call.
[49:07.740 --> 49:10.740]  Let's jump to Stephen in Texas.
[49:10.740 --> 49:11.740]  Stephen, are you there?
[49:11.740 --> 49:13.740]  Yeah, good morning, Jason.
[49:13.740 --> 49:14.740]  How are you doing now?
[49:14.740 --> 49:15.740]  I guess it's afternoon where you are.
[49:15.740 --> 49:18.740]  Yeah, I had several things I wanted to share.
[49:18.740 --> 49:24.740]  I've got a good friend of mine who's a student in a Bible college here in East Texas, Northamea.
[49:24.740 --> 49:32.740]  And this guy has experienced in the last year a plethora of the issues that Alex has been talking about in a show.
[49:32.740 --> 49:39.740]  Probably a year or so ago, more than that, I actually had this friend of mine watch with me terror storming.
[49:39.740 --> 49:41.740]  He was just, his mouth was on the ground.
[49:41.740 --> 49:45.740]  So he's really gotten on board with this whole thing of making people aware what's going on.
[49:45.740 --> 49:46.740]  He's very vocal.
[49:46.740 --> 49:49.740]  He's very astute, very studied up and what he checks out.
[49:49.740 --> 49:52.740]  And he's very authoritative when he speaks, just like Alex.
[49:52.740 --> 49:56.740]  Well, anyway, here's what he's had happen since he's taken this stand.
[49:56.740 --> 50:01.740]  First of all, he mentioned a college professor, and this is a little Bible college in East Texas.
[50:01.740 --> 50:08.740]  This guy, Bob, that Alex has spoken of, that's going around saying we need to tear down the Constitution,
[50:08.740 --> 50:09.740]  get rid of our nation state.
[50:09.740 --> 50:13.740]  He actually was invited by a professor to speak at the college there.
[50:13.740 --> 50:14.740]  Oh, love it.
[50:14.740 --> 50:21.740]  Because the professor wanted to get an opposing view of what is right as far as our constitutional right.
[50:21.740 --> 50:26.740]  But when Mr. Bobby came out with basically getting rid of the United States as a nation,
[50:26.740 --> 50:28.740]  this guy got really upset at him.
[50:28.740 --> 50:29.740]  The professor invited him.
[50:29.740 --> 50:35.740]  It was really angry and rebuked him because he said, you're a traitor and you ought to be tried for treason.
[50:35.740 --> 50:36.740]  All right, Steven, stay right there.
[50:36.740 --> 50:38.740]  I want to get into more of this on the other side.
[50:38.740 --> 50:44.740]  We're also going to be having Paul Joseph Watson at one and Jim Mars at two info wars.com, prisonplanet.com.

[54:10.740 --> 54:16.740]  And I want to invite everybody out to the Alamo Draft House on May 17th and May 18th,
[54:16.740 --> 54:21.740]  where Alex Jones is going to be sneak peeking his 9-11 Chronicles Part 1 Truth Rise.
[54:21.740 --> 54:28.740]  And remember, folks, you won't be able to get that on the website until at least mid-June, possibly early July.
[54:28.740 --> 54:34.740]  So if you want to catch a sneak peek, you're out in Texas. It's over at the Alamo Draft House Saturday, May 17th at 4 p.m.
[54:34.740 --> 54:42.740]  and Sunday, May 18th at 7 p.m. If you want to support this broadcast, otherwise, it'd probably be a good idea to get a prisonplanet.tv membership.
[54:42.740 --> 54:47.740]  That's the way you can see my pretty face and Alex's pretty face in the fourth hour.
[54:47.740 --> 54:51.740]  We stream a full hour, if you will, on the video.
[54:51.740 --> 55:01.740]  On top of all of Alex Jones' documentary films, everything from police state 1 through 3 to loose changes on there.
[55:01.740 --> 55:06.740]  It's all there. Prisonplanet.tv has weekly TV reports. That's how you support the broadcast.
[55:06.740 --> 55:12.740]  Or you can go to the InfoWars shop and pick up American Drug War, a movie I highly recommend.
[55:12.740 --> 55:16.740]  I watched it. I think it was in December. I finally got to see it. It's an excellent film.
[55:16.740 --> 55:22.740]  You can get William Lewis' Washington You're Fired. We had William on yesterday, a class act all the way.
[55:22.740 --> 55:26.740]  Or you can get Endgame, Alex's latest, as well as loose change Final Cut.
[55:26.740 --> 55:32.740]  Alright, let's go back to Steve and we're discussing this Bobbit character and how he's prancing around the United States,
[55:32.740 --> 55:35.740]  talking about how we need to end the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[55:35.740 --> 55:40.740]  So, obviously, the professor was pretty opposed to this after he heard him speak.
[55:40.740 --> 55:45.740]  We told him, you're not welcome here ever again. You know, told him he should be tried for treason.
[55:45.740 --> 55:56.740]  And the thing is, my friend, he's been showing his fellow students these videos like Endgame and Terrorism, Terrorstorm and Loose Change.
[55:56.740 --> 56:02.740]  He's trying to do what we're all trying to do, which is wake people up and make them aware so we can stand up to this monster.
[56:02.740 --> 56:10.740]  Here's another thing. A friend in the college whose pastor was approached by a FEMA representative
[56:10.740 --> 56:14.740]  and told to preach from Romans 13. This pastor refused.
[56:14.740 --> 56:22.740]  Oh, that's weird because apparently that doesn't exist even though Alex had some of the preachers come on.
[56:22.740 --> 56:25.740]  Talk about how they had been approached to be recruited for this.
[56:25.740 --> 56:28.740]  One of them got paperwork, sent it down to the Info Wars office.
[56:28.740 --> 56:32.740]  We printed it over at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[56:32.740 --> 56:38.740]  And it's obvious that FEMA's there to try to cull the Christian masses into their camps.
[56:38.740 --> 56:45.740]  Having the preachers sell out their quote-unquote flock to death. It's pretty scary, man.
[56:45.740 --> 56:50.740]  I mean, that's what it is. They're going to enslave these people through someone who is their authoritative role model.
[56:50.740 --> 56:56.740]  See, that's why it's so hard for me to get down with the Christian religion.
[56:56.740 --> 57:01.740]  It's not that I don't like the philosophies and morality of Christianity.
[57:01.740 --> 57:03.740]  I think they're great. I think the life lessons are great.
[57:03.740 --> 57:10.740]  But so many people who follow this religion just blindly follow whatever their preacher says.
[57:10.740 --> 57:15.740]  They believe that George W. Bush is of the Lord and that he worships Jesus Christ.
[57:15.740 --> 57:22.740]  And that all these Christian conservatives on the right really believe in Christianity and they don't.
[57:22.740 --> 57:27.740]  These are guys that are looking for gay bathroom sex in an airport.
[57:27.740 --> 57:36.740]  These are guys that head up the government's CPS department and then get caught eye-emming 16-year-old boy pages.
[57:36.740 --> 57:39.740]  That's what they're into. They're into going to the Bohemian Grove.
[57:39.740 --> 57:42.740]  Stephen, I thank you for the call, man. It just makes me sick.
[57:42.740 --> 57:45.740]  There's nothing Christian about the majority of these guys.
[57:45.740 --> 57:52.740]  And yet Christians are just going to follow whatever their pastors say, whatever these guys say outwardly.
[57:52.740 --> 57:58.740]  Oh, I talked to God. You know, God made me president.
[57:58.740 --> 58:02.740]  God made me president. All right, let's move on to some more phone calls.
[58:02.740 --> 58:04.740]  Let's go to Craig in D.C.
[58:04.740 --> 58:07.740]  All right, wait. I guess we'll take Craig in D.C. after the break.
[58:07.740 --> 58:10.740]  I forget that we're about to be back at the top of the hour.
[58:10.740 --> 58:17.740]  Remember, and now we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson, author of Order Out of Chaos and the prisonplanet.com webmaster,
[58:17.740 --> 58:19.740]  as well as Jim Mars in the next couple hours.
[58:19.740 --> 58:22.740]  It's the Alex Jones show. Stick around. I'll be back after this.
[58:59.740 --> 59:02.740]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[59:02.740 --> 59:12.740]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:12.740 --> 59:22.740]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[59:22.740 --> 59:24.740]  Ilbert is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:24.740 --> 59:29.740]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their affidavit.
[59:29.740 --> 59:38.740]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com, or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[59:38.740 --> 59:43.740]  In-game, blueprint for global enslaving. You have been warned.
[59:46.740 --> 59:52.740]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:57.740 --> 1:00:02.740]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:02.740 --> 1:00:11.740]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:12.740 --> 1:00:22.740]  All right, folks, we are back for the second hour of this global transmission against tyranny, against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[1:00:22.740 --> 1:00:29.740]  Especially when those domestic enemies are prancing around universities talking about the end of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[1:00:29.740 --> 1:00:37.740]  And they're going to recruit your preachers in order to cull the masses into FEMA camps built by Halliburne.
[1:00:37.740 --> 1:00:44.740]  That's where we're at. Pretty scary stuff, but reality. I mean, everything I just said there is really going on.
[1:00:44.740 --> 1:00:49.740]  FEMA is recruiting pastors and preachers to preach to you.
[1:00:49.740 --> 1:00:53.740]  Romans, where you give in to the government. The government is God, isn't that nice?
[1:00:53.740 --> 1:01:00.740]  The government is not God, folks. Governments throughout history are not there for the people.
[1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:08.740]  They're manipulated. They're there to eviscerate our rights. They're there to dominate us.
[1:01:08.740 --> 1:01:11.740]  That's why dictatorships pop up all throughout the world.
[1:01:11.740 --> 1:01:18.740]  And constitutional republics and democracies are not the norm. You need to get it through your head.
[1:01:18.740 --> 1:01:24.740]  We're lucky. We're real lucky to be where we are. We're in a position right now where we can still fight a lot of this.
[1:01:24.740 --> 1:01:32.740]  But people's heads are so much in the sand by their infotainment, which is really our own faults for falling for it.
[1:01:32.740 --> 1:01:37.740]  These 24-hour news networks, even CNN and Fox News, all that other stuff.
[1:01:37.740 --> 1:01:44.740]  Half of its Britney Spears, like I care, or Anna Nicole Smith, like I really do like that Jesse Ventura went out there and said,
[1:01:44.740 --> 1:01:54.740]  you know, Anna Nicole Smith was nothing but a model, and they covered her death for two months on every 24-hour news network.
[1:01:54.740 --> 1:01:58.740]  And there were entire shows like Larry King Live dedicated to it.
[1:01:58.740 --> 1:02:04.740]  And let's not forget about her death scandal right before that, the baby scandal. Who cares?
[1:02:04.740 --> 1:02:11.740]  How does her having a baby with six other dudes affect my life at all? It doesn't.
[1:02:11.740 --> 1:02:18.740]  The only way it affects my life is it dumbs my neighbors down enough to where they don't even care that 9-11 is a false flag attack
[1:02:18.740 --> 1:02:25.740]  that's taken away all our rights and freedoms and is killing American soldiers day after day overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[1:02:25.740 --> 1:02:31.740]  And let's not mention all the brown people we've killed because obviously they're brown and they're not human.
[1:02:31.740 --> 1:02:36.740]  You know, they're less than human somehow because they're born in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[1:02:36.740 --> 1:02:43.740]  You know, let's bomb into the Stone Age. Let's make it a glass parking lot. I've only heard that 300 dozen times.
[1:02:43.740 --> 1:02:48.740]  All right, let's keep going with the callers. Let's go to Craig in DC. Craig, are you there?
[1:02:48.740 --> 1:02:50.740]  Hey, Jason, what's up, man?
[1:02:50.740 --> 1:02:51.740]  How you doing, man?
[1:02:51.740 --> 1:02:58.740]  Hey, you know what? I'm real good. It's a real pleasure to talk to you. I've seen your loose change films and those are something else, man.
[1:02:58.740 --> 1:02:59.740]  Well, thank you, man.
[1:02:59.740 --> 1:03:07.740]  I don't want to sound stupid in asking this question, but was the purpose of each successive one, it's not to usurp the previous one,
[1:03:07.740 --> 1:03:11.740]  it's to continue to build the narrative, I suppose, right?
[1:03:11.740 --> 1:03:14.740]  Oh, absolutely. And the way I looked at it is this, all right?
[1:03:14.740 --> 1:03:19.740]  For instance, you know, Dylan did the first edition all on his own. It was a 60-minute documentary.
[1:03:19.740 --> 1:03:21.740]  It opened up a lot of eyes, okay?
[1:03:21.740 --> 1:03:26.740]  And when I saw that, I saw the potential for this thing to be the one that broke into the mainstream.
[1:03:26.740 --> 1:03:34.740]  So I met Dylan and Corey prior to the second edition. We took the best 30 minutes from the second edition and we made this 90-minute narrative.
[1:03:34.740 --> 1:03:40.740]  Now, this one blew up out of the sky. I mean, it was featured on every news channel and brought us around the country.
[1:03:40.740 --> 1:03:45.740]  Caught a lot of eyes, had O'Reilly bashing us, got us into this next project.
[1:03:45.740 --> 1:03:53.740]  And what we tried to do with the final cut that we didn't do so much in the second edition was to try to stay away from what we thought happened
[1:03:53.740 --> 1:03:57.740]  and really just show, hey, here's the official version of events right here.
[1:03:57.740 --> 1:03:59.740]  And here's the evidence against it.
[1:03:59.740 --> 1:04:02.740]  For instance, one of my favorite sections in that is the War Game section,
[1:04:02.740 --> 1:04:07.740]  because we started off with Condoleezza Rice and George W. Bush saying,
[1:04:07.740 --> 1:04:11.740]  oh, we never knew that they could use planes as weapons.
[1:04:11.740 --> 1:04:16.740]  No one ever thought that. Now, anybody with half a brain knows about Bozhenka.
[1:04:16.740 --> 1:04:20.740]  They know that we were the ones running drills, the only country running drills,
[1:04:20.740 --> 1:04:23.740]  of ramming planes into the World Trade Center prior to it happening.
[1:04:23.740 --> 1:04:26.740]  And then we show the news clip, you know? We show Peter Jennings.
[1:04:26.740 --> 1:04:29.740]  And then there's no answers, man. That's the big problem.
[1:04:29.740 --> 1:04:31.740]  There's no answers after we show that news clip.
[1:04:31.740 --> 1:04:34.740]  It just shows you, wow, they lied again and no one did anything.
[1:04:34.740 --> 1:04:37.740]  In fact, he testified not under oath with Dick Cheney.
[1:04:37.740 --> 1:04:39.740]  Stay there, Craig. I want to get some more points from you.
[1:04:39.740 --> 1:04:50.740]  On the other side, it is the Alex Jones Show, PrismPlanet.com.
[1:05:31.740 --> 1:05:33.740]  While you're visiting the online video store,
[1:05:33.740 --> 1:05:36.740]  be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame,
[1:05:36.740 --> 1:05:39.740]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism,
[1:05:39.740 --> 1:05:41.740]  and hundreds of other titles.
[1:05:41.740 --> 1:05:44.740]  We're in a no-holds-far information war.
[1:05:44.740 --> 1:05:47.740]  Truth is our weapon, and PrismPlanet.com has the tools you need
[1:05:47.740 --> 1:05:50.740]  to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[1:05:50.740 --> 1:05:54.740]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[1:05:54.740 --> 1:05:57.740]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[1:05:57.740 --> 1:05:59.740]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[1:05:59.740 --> 1:06:02.740]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate
[1:06:02.740 --> 1:06:04.740]  and others are absorbed into the skin.
[1:06:04.740 --> 1:06:08.740]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water,
[1:06:08.740 --> 1:06:12.740]  and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron,
[1:06:12.740 --> 1:06:16.740]  and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[1:06:16.740 --> 1:06:20.740]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons
[1:06:20.740 --> 1:06:22.740]  or one year, whichever comes first.
[1:06:22.740 --> 1:06:24.740]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities
[1:06:24.740 --> 1:06:28.740]  use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[1:06:28.740 --> 1:06:29.740]  What about you?
[1:06:29.740 --> 1:06:31.740]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally,

[1:07:30.740 --> 1:07:33.740]  including the U.S. Constitution, the Declaration of Independence
[1:07:33.740 --> 1:07:35.740]  and the Articles of Confederation.

[1:07:46.740 --> 1:07:49.740]  That's 646-498-5309.
[1:07:51.740 --> 1:07:53.740]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:07:53.740 --> 1:07:57.740]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:00.740 --> 1:08:02.740]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[1:08:02.740 --> 1:08:03.740]  I am not Alex Jones.
[1:08:03.740 --> 1:08:04.740]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[1:08:04.740 --> 1:08:09.740]  You can go check out my stuff over at www.loosechange911.com.
[1:08:09.740 --> 1:08:10.740]  Alex will be back.
[1:08:10.740 --> 1:08:11.740]  I think he's doing the Sunday show.
[1:08:11.740 --> 1:08:15.740]  He might not be, but he'll be back on Monday for a show.
[1:08:15.740 --> 1:08:20.740]  I was just discussing the Loose Change movies with Craig in DC.
[1:08:20.740 --> 1:08:24.740]  Craig, I'm actually doing another movie right now, which is also a 9-11 film,
[1:08:24.740 --> 1:08:29.740]  which is going to focus not only on the foreign government involvement in 9-11,
[1:08:29.740 --> 1:08:33.740]  really going to focus in on not only the Pakistani involvement,
[1:08:33.740 --> 1:08:36.740]  but the Israeli involvement and the Saudi Arabian involvement
[1:08:36.740 --> 1:08:40.740]  and the congressional cover-up, but it's also going to focus on the whistleblowers.
[1:08:40.740 --> 1:08:43.740]  People like J. Michael Springman's testimony have never really been heard,
[1:08:43.740 --> 1:08:46.740]  even though Robert Wright and Larry Claimman get a little cameo
[1:08:46.740 --> 1:08:49.740]  in the introduction of Loose Change Final Cut.
[1:08:49.740 --> 1:08:51.740]  They don't really get to be brought into depth.
[1:08:51.740 --> 1:08:55.740]  Sebel Edmund's story has never really been in a movie to my satisfaction,
[1:08:55.740 --> 1:09:01.740]  especially now that she's come out in that Times Online piece to admit that
[1:09:01.740 --> 1:09:09.740]  Mahmoud Ahmed of the ISI was not only involved in this wiring of Muhammad Atta's $100,000,
[1:09:09.740 --> 1:09:13.740]  but also involved in this international spy ring
[1:09:13.740 --> 1:09:19.740]  that was trading nuclear secrets with Israel, the Turks, and Pakistan
[1:09:19.740 --> 1:09:23.740]  with supposedly household names within the White House.
[1:09:23.740 --> 1:09:27.740]  I think she named Mark Grossman, but the Times Online didn't have the nuts
[1:09:27.740 --> 1:09:30.740]  to publish Mark Grossman's name of the State Department.
[1:09:30.740 --> 1:09:32.740]  It was published on the Brad blog.
[1:09:32.740 --> 1:09:35.740]  So yeah, man, I'm just trying to expand my audience.
[1:09:35.740 --> 1:09:38.740]  I'm trying to bring in people through different routes.
[1:09:38.740 --> 1:09:43.740]  If Loose Change Second Edition was too hardcore or too youthful for some,
[1:09:43.740 --> 1:09:46.740]  maybe Loose Change Final Cut brings it back a little bit,
[1:09:46.740 --> 1:09:49.740]  has a little bit more of a broader soundtrack, maybe that can bring some people in.
[1:09:49.740 --> 1:09:51.740]  And the same with this new one, Fabled Enemies.
[1:09:51.740 --> 1:09:54.740]  Maybe we can bring some new people into the movement with this movie, Craig.
[1:09:54.740 --> 1:09:56.740]  When's that one set for release?
[1:09:56.740 --> 1:09:58.740]  Well, I am working on it as we speak.
[1:09:58.740 --> 1:10:03.740]  I mean, last night literally is the first time I left the office before 11 p.m.
[1:10:03.740 --> 1:10:09.740]  I've been pulling 14, 15-hour days out here while I'm in Texas trying to put this out.
[1:10:09.740 --> 1:10:13.740]  I'm hoping that it will be edited all the way through on June 1st
[1:10:13.740 --> 1:10:16.740]  and we're shooting for an August 1st release date.
[1:10:16.740 --> 1:10:18.740]  So look for that one out on Google Video.
[1:10:18.740 --> 1:10:20.740]  It's going to be there for free for everybody.
[1:10:20.740 --> 1:10:25.740]  And I'm going to encourage people to make copies just like all of our films and hand them out.
[1:10:25.740 --> 1:10:29.740]  Jason, I think it's obvious anybody that watches your films and all the other documentaries
[1:10:29.740 --> 1:10:31.740]  that are promoted on the show, on this network,
[1:10:31.740 --> 1:10:35.740]  that hours and hours of devotion and passion got to go into them.
[1:10:35.740 --> 1:10:40.740]  That's part of what makes it so amazing is that it's from the heart type of thing.
[1:10:40.740 --> 1:10:43.740]  It's from the heart type of movement, you know.
[1:10:43.740 --> 1:10:46.740]  And I just can't thank you enough for putting out and doing what you do.
[1:10:46.740 --> 1:10:50.740]  I mean, you've raised so many great points in these Loose Change films.
[1:10:50.740 --> 1:10:56.740]  The most arousing one for me was this notion that the hijackers were still alive somewhere
[1:10:56.740 --> 1:10:58.740]  and wondering why they're showing up on this list.
[1:10:58.740 --> 1:11:04.740]  And I noticed that that wasn't touched upon in the Loose Change Final Cut version.
[1:11:04.740 --> 1:11:07.740]  Yep. Well, basically, we had covered that in the second edition
[1:11:07.740 --> 1:11:09.740]  and we didn't feel like we needed it.
[1:11:09.740 --> 1:11:11.740]  We did touch on it really quick in the Final Cut.
[1:11:11.740 --> 1:11:15.740]  We mentioned really in passing that oddly enough,
[1:11:15.740 --> 1:11:18.740]  the mainstream media would report a bunch of these guys alive.
[1:11:18.740 --> 1:11:22.740]  But I'd like to point out United 23 and that's going to be in this new movie.
[1:11:22.740 --> 1:11:27.740]  United 23 was another plane that was supposedly going to be hijacked.
[1:11:27.740 --> 1:11:31.740]  What happened was the pilot didn't take off because he felt like there were guys in the back
[1:11:31.740 --> 1:11:33.740]  that were going to hijack the plane.
[1:11:33.740 --> 1:11:35.740]  You already had word what had happened in New York.
[1:11:35.740 --> 1:11:39.740]  So he was out in New Jersey, I believe, and he refused to take off.
[1:11:39.740 --> 1:11:42.740]  So then these four guys wouldn't get off the plane.
[1:11:42.740 --> 1:11:43.740]  It was very odd.
[1:11:43.740 --> 1:11:47.740]  They then get them off the plane and they don't stick around for their luggage.
[1:11:47.740 --> 1:11:48.740]  They leave.
[1:11:48.740 --> 1:11:52.740]  While inside their luggage, of course, are al-Qaeda training manuals
[1:11:52.740 --> 1:11:54.740]  and building blueprints and everything else,
[1:11:54.740 --> 1:11:58.740]  the weird thing is these guys were quote-unquote never brought to justice
[1:11:58.740 --> 1:12:01.740]  because they were using false identification.
[1:12:01.740 --> 1:12:06.740]  Well, if they were using false identification and they were part of the September 11th plot,
[1:12:06.740 --> 1:12:10.740]  why wouldn't the other guys be using false identification, Craig?
[1:12:10.740 --> 1:12:13.740]  Oh, man, you know, that's pretty interesting.
[1:12:13.740 --> 1:12:17.740]  Every point you bring up is like a new bright idea.
[1:12:17.740 --> 1:12:18.740]  It's great.
[1:12:18.740 --> 1:12:20.740]  It's baffling to me.
[1:12:20.740 --> 1:12:23.740]  Another point that never gets brought up, again,
[1:12:23.740 --> 1:12:25.740]  I'm not sure if I'm going to include this in Fabled Enemies.
[1:12:25.740 --> 1:12:28.740]  I was editing through the cover-up section.
[1:12:28.740 --> 1:12:32.740]  I thought about adding this in there as another point to that Flight 23.
[1:12:32.740 --> 1:12:36.740]  Actor James Woods got on a plane in July.
[1:12:36.740 --> 1:12:40.740]  He saw Ata and three other guys all dressed up in jumpsuits.
[1:12:40.740 --> 1:12:44.740]  He got real nervous. He started talking to the flight attendant.
[1:12:44.740 --> 1:12:45.740]  She agreed.
[1:12:45.740 --> 1:12:47.740]  It looked like they were going to try to hijack the plane.
[1:12:47.740 --> 1:12:49.740]  They kept their eye on him the entire time.
[1:12:49.740 --> 1:12:57.740]  And then both of them, okay, let me say both of them filed FAA reports against these guys to the FBI.
[1:12:57.740 --> 1:12:58.740]  Nothing happens to them.
[1:12:58.740 --> 1:12:59.740]  Why doesn't anything happen to them?
[1:12:59.740 --> 1:13:05.740]  Well, because two of his buddies are living Khalid Al-Madar and I want to say Nawaf al-Sami.
[1:13:05.740 --> 1:13:08.740]  They're the guys living with the FBI informant, okay?
[1:13:08.740 --> 1:13:10.740]  They're the ones renting and living from.
[1:13:10.740 --> 1:13:14.740]  Now, those are also two guys that were identified by Able Danger.
[1:13:14.740 --> 1:13:17.740]  And they tried to go to the FBI and say, hey, we have these guys.
[1:13:17.740 --> 1:13:19.740]  The FBI wasn't interested because they were on their payroll, dude.
[1:13:19.740 --> 1:13:22.740]  That's what kills me, you know?
[1:13:22.740 --> 1:13:27.740]  So, you know, there's just so many interlocking, intersecting questions.
[1:13:27.740 --> 1:13:33.740]  I think it's important to put out several different pieces of media and let people decide what they think is the most effective.
[1:13:33.740 --> 1:13:38.740]  So, we can keep spreading this word because, you know, 9-Eleven Truth is the only movement for me.
[1:13:38.740 --> 1:13:44.740]  Our entire foreign and domestic policy are still based on the events of 9-Eleven that we've been told by the government and media.
[1:13:44.740 --> 1:13:47.740]  And it's still front-page news and it's still an excuse for everything.
[1:13:47.740 --> 1:13:50.740]  So, until we bring the truth to light, I'm going to keep harping on it, Craig.
[1:13:50.740 --> 1:13:51.740]  I thank you for the call, man.
[1:13:51.740 --> 1:13:53.740]  I hope you have a great day.
[1:13:53.740 --> 1:13:54.740]  There's another great caller.
[1:13:54.740 --> 1:13:57.740]  Let's go to Nate in Maine.
[1:13:57.740 --> 1:13:58.740]  Nate, are you with me?
[1:13:58.740 --> 1:13:59.740]  Yes, sir.
[1:13:59.740 --> 1:14:00.740]  How are you doing today?
[1:14:00.740 --> 1:14:02.740]  It's a pleasure and an honor to speak with you, Jason.
[1:14:02.740 --> 1:14:03.740]  Well, thank you, man.
[1:14:03.740 --> 1:14:04.740]  I appreciate that.
[1:14:04.740 --> 1:14:05.740]  What's on your mind?
[1:14:05.740 --> 1:14:07.740]  Oh, man, I hate to bring this subject up.
[1:14:07.740 --> 1:14:13.740]  I haven't been able to tune into the show for a couple of days because I've been on a business trip.
[1:14:13.740 --> 1:14:21.740]  But I really wanted to get your take on any new information that you might possibly have on this whole Nico Hopp assaulting one of the...
[1:14:21.740 --> 1:14:24.740]  We are change guys over at Ground Zero.
[1:14:24.740 --> 1:14:25.740]  All right, yeah.
[1:14:25.740 --> 1:14:28.740]  I mean, I hate to even give the guy attention because he's a total nutbag.
[1:14:28.740 --> 1:14:30.740]  But let me go through it.
[1:14:30.740 --> 1:14:31.740]  I hear you.
[1:14:31.740 --> 1:14:38.740]  I've known Nico now since the fourth anniversary of 9-11 was my first experience meeting him.
[1:14:38.740 --> 1:14:42.740]  I met him there and we were discussing loose change first edition.
[1:14:42.740 --> 1:14:46.740]  This is before he was really just ranting and raving down at Ground Zero, blah, blah, blah.
[1:14:46.740 --> 1:14:49.740]  And he's telling me no planes, key outs, this and that.
[1:14:49.740 --> 1:14:51.740]  And I'm like, dude, that makes absolutely no sense.
[1:14:51.740 --> 1:14:55.740]  I go, first of all, amateurs caught the plane on camera.
[1:14:55.740 --> 1:14:57.740]  It wasn't just news agencies.
[1:14:57.740 --> 1:14:59.740]  So what did these amateurs do?
[1:14:59.740 --> 1:15:04.740]  They gave their cameras to the news agencies who then edited the planes and they never said anything?
[1:15:04.740 --> 1:15:05.740]  No.
[1:15:05.740 --> 1:15:08.740]  Number two, he's like, oh, well, it's simple chroma key.
[1:15:08.740 --> 1:15:12.740]  And I said, well, then why didn't they chroma key in a plane that looked like a United plane?
[1:15:12.740 --> 1:15:17.740]  I'm like, from every video I've seen, this thing has a gray underside, two gray engines.
[1:15:17.740 --> 1:15:19.740]  Okay, it doesn't look like a United plane.
[1:15:19.740 --> 1:15:22.740]  The only thing I see on it is the United logo on the tail.
[1:15:22.740 --> 1:15:25.740]  So why wouldn't they do a better job if they were going to key it in?
[1:15:25.740 --> 1:15:27.740]  Oh, that makes no difference.
[1:15:27.740 --> 1:15:28.740]  I am crazy.
[1:15:28.740 --> 1:15:29.740]  Great.
[1:15:29.740 --> 1:15:33.740]  So he came to one of the initial screenings of Loose Chain's second edition.
[1:15:33.740 --> 1:15:39.740]  In fact, if you go online and I think you type in WTC7, Jason Burma's firefighter,
[1:15:39.740 --> 1:15:44.740]  you'll see an interview I conducted with one of the firefighter survivors who came to that screening.
[1:15:44.740 --> 1:15:50.740]  Now, I also tried to get Nico hopped on camera at that time just to kind of give his views on the second edition.
[1:15:50.740 --> 1:15:53.740]  It's before he was going down to Ground Zero and acting crazy.
[1:15:53.740 --> 1:15:58.740]  Now, now he goes down there and he harasses a group that's very effective.
[1:15:58.740 --> 1:15:59.740]  We are changed.
[1:15:59.740 --> 1:16:02.740]  Okay, more effective than any other truth group out there.
[1:16:02.740 --> 1:16:05.740]  I hate to say that because, you know, a lot of people do some great work.
[1:16:05.740 --> 1:16:07.740]  But there is, I'm sorry, there's just nobody as effective.
[1:16:07.740 --> 1:16:10.740]  There's nobody out there doing what they're doing.
[1:16:10.740 --> 1:16:15.740]  Okay, I'd say a close second is maybe student scholars for 9-11 Truth and I love those guys too.
[1:16:15.740 --> 1:16:18.740]  But we are changed is across the country.
[1:16:18.740 --> 1:16:20.740]  Okay, they're from LA to New York.
[1:16:20.740 --> 1:16:21.740]  They're not letting anybody pass by.
[1:16:21.740 --> 1:16:22.740]  So what does this guy start to do?
[1:16:22.740 --> 1:16:27.740]  He starts to go down to Ground Zero to scream at them to make them look crazy.
[1:16:27.740 --> 1:16:36.740]  And if you saw this latest video after the bombing, that little flash bomb, that flash grenade bomb that was caught in Times Square.
[1:16:36.740 --> 1:16:39.740]  That's exactly where we are changed goes.
[1:16:39.740 --> 1:16:48.740]  Okay, and then Nico hopped magically is out there with a huge sign with seven different or I think it was actually nine different covers from that day that said we did it.
[1:16:48.740 --> 1:16:55.740]  The only little little post thing that they got to try to insinuate that we are changed somehow flash banged Times Square.
[1:16:55.740 --> 1:16:56.740]  Give me a break.
[1:16:56.740 --> 1:16:58.740]  And then you see him on tape.
[1:16:58.740 --> 1:17:05.740]  Grab somebody by the throat after he asks who's paying him and he doesn't get arrested.
[1:17:05.740 --> 1:17:12.740]  Okay, he's wearing a party hat looking like a moron ranting and raving in front of Ground Zero and he's not being arrested.
[1:17:12.740 --> 1:17:13.740]  Come on.
[1:17:13.740 --> 1:17:16.740]  Who's the guy pouring the stuff down his throat?
[1:17:16.740 --> 1:17:18.740]  It looks like an opt to me.
[1:17:18.740 --> 1:17:25.740]  You know, he could just be a nut, but you know, if they're not going to arrest him for trying to choke somebody, that's a telltale sign.
[1:17:25.740 --> 1:17:26.740]  Wouldn't you say Nate?
[1:17:26.740 --> 1:17:29.740]  Yeah, that's just the thing that got me because I just watched that video this morning.
[1:17:29.740 --> 1:17:31.740]  That's why I had to bring it up.
[1:17:31.740 --> 1:17:41.740]  Because, I mean, the guy, like you said, he choked the guy and when Luke brought over the tape to the cop and showed him the tape of this man being assaulted.
[1:17:41.740 --> 1:17:50.740]  Any normal citizen, I mean, if that was another cop showing another cop the tape that had been, a cop had been choked, the guy would have been arrested and hung.
[1:17:50.740 --> 1:17:54.740]  He would have definitely been arrested and then probably beaten a cell because that's how they like to do.
[1:17:54.740 --> 1:17:55.740]  Exactly.
[1:17:55.740 --> 1:18:00.740]  But New York, man, is so, especially New York City, man, right down in the pit of Ground Zero.
[1:18:00.740 --> 1:18:02.740]  There are so many police.
[1:18:02.740 --> 1:18:06.740]  I mean, so, first of all, it goes right down into the PATH train station.
[1:18:06.740 --> 1:18:09.740]  In other words, the subway station is right under that thing in Ground Zero.
[1:18:09.740 --> 1:18:13.740]  And actually, there's a cool little part in the new 9-11 Chronicles movie.
[1:18:13.740 --> 1:18:28.740]  A lot of people probably aren't aware of this, but just type in All Seeing Eye New York City Subway and right underneath New York City Subway, right underneath the World Trade Center section, is a huge map of the entire globe in like a circle.
[1:18:28.740 --> 1:18:37.740]  It looks like the top of a globe spanned out and in the middle of that is the All Seeing Eye and it is illuminating its vision throughout the world.
[1:18:37.740 --> 1:18:40.740]  And then there's all sorts of little eyes and mosaics and stuff.
[1:18:40.740 --> 1:18:47.740]  I don't think they're putting the actual world map thing on there, but they are putting all the little Illuminati eye symbols that are all over New York City in the film.
[1:18:47.740 --> 1:18:48.740]  But check it out, man.
[1:18:48.740 --> 1:18:50.740]  I mean, that to me is disgusting.
[1:18:50.740 --> 1:18:58.740]  The fact that they're putting, you know, police with M5 carbon rifles down in the subway now is disgusting.
[1:18:58.740 --> 1:19:00.740]  I mean, how is that going to stop any crime?
[1:19:00.740 --> 1:19:03.740]  How is that going to stop crime as opposed to, say, a pistol?
[1:19:03.740 --> 1:19:12.740]  Nobody's gone down into the subways with an AK-47 or another type of automatic pistol or even a machine gun and wiped anybody down.
[1:19:12.740 --> 1:19:13.740]  You're going to give this to the cops?
[1:19:13.740 --> 1:19:15.740]  The cops are trigger happy, man.
[1:19:15.740 --> 1:19:19.740]  They're going to end up killing an entire family or an entire train full of people.
[1:19:19.740 --> 1:19:20.740]  It's nuts to me.
[1:19:20.740 --> 1:19:21.740]  Yeah, big time, exactly.
[1:19:21.740 --> 1:19:23.740]  Nate, I thank you for the call.
[1:19:23.740 --> 1:19:27.740]  We are going to come back and take a couple more calls, folks.
[1:19:27.740 --> 1:19:33.740]  Remember, starting at one o'clock, we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson of PrismPlanet.com on.
[1:19:33.740 --> 1:19:34.740]  And that should be really interesting.
[1:19:34.740 --> 1:19:36.740]  I can't wait to get his take on the money and the police state.
[1:19:36.740 --> 1:19:40.740]  Remember, Alamo Draft House, 9-Eleven Chronicles, May 17th and 18th.
[1:19:40.740 --> 1:19:41.740]  We'll be back after this.
[1:19:41.740 --> 1:19:42.740]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[1:19:42.740 --> 1:19:55.740]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:19:55.740 --> 1:20:00.740]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:20:00.740 --> 1:20:02.740]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[1:20:02.740 --> 1:20:05.740]  Is both their objective to be world domination?
[1:20:05.740 --> 1:20:08.740]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:20:08.740 --> 1:20:19.740]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:20:19.740 --> 1:20:24.740]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:20:24.740 --> 1:20:28.740]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:20:28.740 --> 1:20:31.740]  The Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:20:31.740 --> 1:20:32.740]  Most people have no idea.
[1:20:32.740 --> 1:20:33.740]  They're not after money.
[1:20:33.740 --> 1:20:34.740]  They have all the money they need.
[1:20:34.740 --> 1:20:35.740]  They're after power.
[1:20:35.740 --> 1:20:36.740]  That's their after-easy.

[1:21:17.740 --> 1:21:18.740]  And here's the best part.

[1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:52.740]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[1:21:52.740 --> 1:21:55.740]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[1:21:55.740 --> 1:21:58.740]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[1:21:58.740 --> 1:22:01.740]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:22:01.740 --> 1:22:07.740]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[1:22:07.740 --> 1:22:11.740]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:16.740]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[1:22:48.740 --> 1:22:50.740]  Prisonplanet.tv.
[1:22:50.740 --> 1:22:54.740]  People who use Cardiobyte know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[1:22:54.740 --> 1:22:58.740]  For over five years, Cardiobyte has proven itself time tested.
[1:22:58.740 --> 1:23:01.740]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardiobyte.
[1:23:01.740 --> 1:23:10.740]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore. This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70, 80% of the disease that we see.
[1:23:10.740 --> 1:23:20.740]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardiobyte, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[1:23:20.740 --> 1:23:27.740]  It's a well thought out formula. I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[1:23:27.740 --> 1:23:33.740]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems. It'll work on other problems as well.
[1:23:33.740 --> 1:23:43.740]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[1:23:43.740 --> 1:23:58.740]  That toll free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[1:24:37.740 --> 1:24:40.740]  Love that guitar beat. Oh, Bob Dylan. It's a good one.
[1:24:40.740 --> 1:24:45.740]  It's a good one. Sundown on the Union, indeed.
[1:24:45.740 --> 1:24:51.740]  We're going to keep firing through phone calls until we get into the second hour with Paul Watson.
[1:24:51.740 --> 1:24:57.740]  Phone calls have been fun today. This is the Alex Jones show. I am Jason Bermas. I'll be in tomorrow as well.
[1:24:57.740 --> 1:25:08.740]  Let's not forget the Alamo Draft House screening of the 9-11 Chronicles, a couple of sneak peeks, if you will, on May 17th at 4pm and Sunday, May 18th at 7pm.
[1:25:08.740 --> 1:25:13.740]  Remember, this is an all-new Alex Jones picture, unlike anything Alex Jones has ever done.
[1:25:13.740 --> 1:25:20.740]  I can't state it any better than that. It is absolutely different from anything you've ever seen.
[1:25:20.740 --> 1:25:27.740]  Alrighty. Let's go to Don in Texas. Don, are you with me?
[1:25:27.740 --> 1:25:40.740]  Oh, yeah. Say, the reason I call number one, and I agree with a lot of the programs like the Israeli, not all Israelis are bad, of course.
[1:25:40.740 --> 1:25:46.740]  There's a division in Israel between the Mosaic and the Talmudic.
[1:25:46.740 --> 1:25:54.740]  The Mosaic are the people that follow the old law, and the Talmudic, you know, they actually are atheists.
[1:25:54.740 --> 1:26:04.740]  What I was calling about is like the Mormons, the compound they raided in West Texas and took all the children out of the place.
[1:26:04.740 --> 1:26:05.740]  Sure.
[1:26:05.740 --> 1:26:15.740]  Well, if you want to do some research, you might find that some of the leaders in the social group there, the Child Protective Services,
[1:26:15.740 --> 1:26:25.740]  the ones that did all the announcements, and a lot of these announcements are well-scripted, very polished, very professional, hypnotic type.
[1:26:25.740 --> 1:26:35.740]  You know, pronouncements that these people are doing all kind of child molestations, not a single bit of proof.
[1:26:35.740 --> 1:26:42.740]  That's absolutely right. One of the things I brought up yesterday when I had Irene Spencer on, who's the author of Shattered Dreams and got out of a polygamous family,
[1:26:42.740 --> 1:26:50.740]  is, you know, look, obviously there's some mind control going on with these people that are, you know, married into these, you know, 12 and 13 people relationships.
[1:26:50.740 --> 1:26:58.740]  But why not go through due process if, in fact, these children are being molested? If there is evidence, there should be no problem.
[1:26:58.740 --> 1:27:01.740]  Well, let me say something. Can I say another thing?
[1:27:01.740 --> 1:27:02.740]  Sure.
[1:27:02.740 --> 1:27:18.740]  Well, they say they're going to claim to be able to prove that, with DNA proof, that the popular idea is that they are all polygamous and impregnating 13, 14-year-olds.
[1:27:18.740 --> 1:27:22.740]  You can't believe forensic evidence anymore.
[1:27:22.740 --> 1:27:34.740]  Forensic groups all around the country have been, a lot of them have been exposed as whatever is politically correct, they'll come out with the answer that the people in power want.
[1:27:34.740 --> 1:27:42.740]  You know, whereas the people that say, well, we're going to check the DNA, we're going to do all this, and then they'll come back three weeks later and say, well, here's the proof.
[1:27:42.740 --> 1:27:48.740]  No, there's been no oversight on that. No examination. They could say anything they want to.
[1:27:48.740 --> 1:27:56.740]  A lot of people are kind of in a suggestible mode. I wonder if the chemtrails have rained down some kind of stuff that makes people believe anything.
[1:27:56.740 --> 1:28:02.740]  Well, even without the chemtrails, I mean, there's so much fluoride in the water in our food products now that it's outrageous.
[1:28:02.740 --> 1:28:13.740]  Well, that's possible, too, but also it's just been a long time. It's like the Holocaust, for instance. I was in Germany. I was in there. I was not a German soldier.
[1:28:13.740 --> 1:28:26.740]  I was there shortly after World War II was over, and it's very unlikely. I worked for a guy, and my commanding officer was somebody that probably causes the death of a lot.
[1:28:26.740 --> 1:28:34.740]  Most of the Jewish people, well, not all of them, of course, but he led many raids into the factories that the Jewish people were working in.
[1:28:34.740 --> 1:28:46.740]  They were not death camps. The Jews and Poles and Russians and all the other conscripted labor they had were valuable commodity to the Germans.
[1:28:46.740 --> 1:28:53.740]  They didn't want them dead. They wanted to produce goods for the Wehrmacht, you know, the German war machine.
[1:28:53.740 --> 1:29:01.740]  Yeah, well, obviously there were work camps, too, and I thank you for the call, Don. Let's go to Rick in Texas. Rick, are you with us?
[1:29:01.740 --> 1:29:06.740]  I'm here. Thanks, Jason. I love Loose Change Final Cut.
[1:29:06.740 --> 1:29:07.740]  Oh, thanks, man.
[1:29:07.740 --> 1:29:12.740]  And I've been trying to get on for a while. My phone's dropped several times. I want to stay on point.
[1:29:12.740 --> 1:29:24.740]  Early in the show, you mentioned, though, what's going on with the police. And you talked about the police, Chief, not coming down on the side of the citizen.
[1:29:24.740 --> 1:29:31.740]  Hold on one second, Rick. We'll come back to you right after the break. It's the Alex Jones Show. I'm Jason Bermas. LooseChange901.com is my site.
[1:29:31.740 --> 1:29:50.740]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:50.740 --> 1:29:55.740]  Why should we fire Congress? Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[1:29:55.740 --> 1:30:00.740]  They swear an oath to follow it, and then they reject it. That was their employment document.
[1:30:00.740 --> 1:30:03.740]  They haven't followed it. Congressman, senators, you're fired.
[1:30:03.740 --> 1:30:05.740]  Washington, you're fired.
[1:30:05.740 --> 1:30:07.740]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[1:30:07.740 --> 1:30:14.740]  Washington, you're fired was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our current political system, and it gives a voice to Americans across the country.
[1:30:14.740 --> 1:30:23.740]  Washington, you're fired examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster, the president's illegal spy program, NSA data mining, FISA secret court,
[1:30:23.740 --> 1:30:30.740]  the illegal wiretapping of millions of Americans and the last seven years of terror related spy bills, how they affect you and what you can do about it.
[1:30:30.740 --> 1:30:34.740]  Washington, you're fired captures the spirit and zest of an old fashioned Boston Tea Party.
[1:30:34.740 --> 1:30:46.740]  Ken Williams describes the film as a rabble rousing call to arms. We invite you to make the change with us. Help take back our government now. Go to takebackwashington.com and get the video tools you need for the information war.

[1:31:17.740 --> 1:31:27.740]  They are called Illuminati, elite proponents of the New World Order. They oppose everything that is God and truth. They are of the line that was disinherited 2000 years ago.
[1:31:27.740 --> 1:31:40.740]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[1:33:11.740 --> 1:33:23.740]  I am the man of cons in sorrow. I've seen trouble all my days.
[1:33:23.740 --> 1:33:43.740]  I'm a bit far away, healthy, old Kentucky. The place where I was born and raised. The place where he was born and raised.
[1:33:43.740 --> 1:33:53.740]  All right, folks, we are back. It is the Alex Jones Show. I am Jason Burmist, sub-an-an.
[1:33:53.740 --> 1:34:01.740]  I want to encourage all of you to go out there and get some of Alex Jones' films, burn them to disc and hand them out, some of the lesser known films.
[1:34:01.740 --> 1:34:13.740]  America destroyed by design, as I believe Alex's first picture, was done in the mid to late 90s. It really is a blueprint for what has happened in the last 10 to 15 years.
[1:34:13.740 --> 1:34:19.740]  It really goes through the whole thing. Almost everything in the entire video he predicted has come true.
[1:34:19.740 --> 1:34:33.740]  It's a real good base point to show you how the United States of America has been given over to a global governance. Portions of this country were given to the United Nations years and years ago.
[1:34:33.740 --> 1:34:53.740]  It's pretty ridiculous stuff. Or maybe the police state is your thing. Police state one through three, I think you can get them on one disc now. All three, I think it's like nine hours of video.
[1:34:53.740 --> 1:35:05.740]  American dictators, of course. American dictators really follows both the Kerry and Bush campaigns and shows how there are two sides of the same coin.
[1:35:05.740 --> 1:35:17.740]  Kerry was there to throw the election. It features Beth Harris of Black Box Voting. She's got a couple of invisible ballots and hijacking democracy.
[1:35:17.740 --> 1:35:29.740]  There are a few documentaries that are outside of American dictators, but she's in that as well. Right now we're talking to Rick in Texas about the out of control police and the police chiefs covering for their little soldiers, if you will.
[1:35:29.740 --> 1:35:31.740]  Rick, you've got the floor.
[1:35:31.740 --> 1:35:53.740]  Thank you, Jason. When you said something about the police chief backing up the police on this, I thought, well, let's go to the mayor. So I looked him up on the internet, called his office. He's not in, but there's a very nice lady there, and she has not had a lot of phone calls, which I thought was very disappointing.
[1:35:53.740 --> 1:36:03.740]  But I made my point to her very lucidly, but in a nice way, because I didn't think she needed to be battered, unlike the Goombas in New York City when they had Alex.
[1:36:03.740 --> 1:36:28.740]  But it got a point across to her, and she was very perceptive of what was going on when I explained it to her. I said, you know, we are in a constitutional republic, and the police are acting like fascist thugs, and the fact that they picked this guy up for not allowing them to get into his car and they arrested him,
[1:36:28.740 --> 1:36:40.740]  that's the kind of thing that happens in police states. And I said, we can't let this happen. And she said, well, do you want him to call you back? I said, well, no, but I'm who I am. I gave her my name.
[1:36:40.740 --> 1:36:49.740]  And I said, but I'm from out of town, but I am an American. And every time I hear about this, I make calls because we can't allow this to happen in our country.
[1:36:49.740 --> 1:37:05.740]  And that's why I want to have a call of action to people to call in and let them know that we don't appreciate that they're doing this and their number is 972-838-2338, 972-838-2338.
[1:37:05.740 --> 1:37:09.740]  That's the city council and the mayor's office.
[1:37:09.740 --> 1:37:19.740]  Well, I encourage people to call them up as well. And, you know, again, we can't allow this stuff to happen. I thank you for the call. You know, I want to tell a little police state story of my own.
[1:37:19.740 --> 1:37:29.740]  A few years back, I was in my little Amish town of Fort Plain, New York. You can look it up on a map. It's very tiny, very upstate, literally lots of Amish people.
[1:37:29.740 --> 1:37:33.740]  And my parents run an auction out there. They do it over the summer.
[1:37:33.740 --> 1:37:42.740]  And I decided that I was going to go get myself a coffee. It was like 7 or 8 at night. It's a little dark. It wasn't that dark, but it was starting to get dark.
[1:37:42.740 --> 1:37:50.740]  I'm walking down the street and to my surprise, you know, I'm on a little off street or whatever, the police pull me over while I'm walking.
[1:37:50.740 --> 1:37:53.740]  Literally pull me over while I'm walking.
[1:37:53.740 --> 1:38:10.740]  Hey, son, what's your name? Like, excuse me? What's your name? I'm like, uh, I'm like, you know that you're breaking the Fourth Amendment, you know, pulling me over, walking, demanding to know my information.
[1:38:10.740 --> 1:38:20.740]  Oh, we got a wise guy gets out of the car, has the pepper spray in his hand aiming it at me. I'm like, what are you going to do? Pepper spray me?
[1:38:20.740 --> 1:38:27.740]  And he's like, you're going to jail unless you tell me who you are right now. We got a report of someone fitting your description.
[1:38:27.740 --> 1:38:34.740]  I'm like, really? There's barely any crime in my town. I can't imagine what description I was fitting.
[1:38:34.740 --> 1:38:43.740]  So I said, my name's Jason. Jason who? I'm like, are you looking for a Jason? Don't get wise with me. You'll be in this car faster than you know, son.
[1:38:43.740 --> 1:38:53.740]  I'm like, Jason Bermas. And they got back in the car. Thank you. And they just drove off. And I'm just like, I cannot believe that just happened.
[1:38:53.740 --> 1:39:00.740]  Now I could have sat there and I could have not given him my name and I could have been in the back of a car probably, you know, sprayed with pepper spray.
[1:39:00.740 --> 1:39:06.740]  And I could have gone through an entire legal battle where the cops covered it up and beat me mercilessly and I'm the bad guy.
[1:39:06.740 --> 1:39:13.740]  I resisted arrest or I harassed somebody, even though, again, I'm alone on a street with a cup of coffee, not even in a car.
[1:39:13.740 --> 1:39:20.740]  That's how out of control it is now, guys. Alright, let's go to Stewart in, I believe it's North Carolina.
[1:39:20.740 --> 1:39:21.740]  Stewart, are you with me?
[1:39:21.740 --> 1:39:23.740]  Yes, I'm with you, but it's New York here.
[1:39:23.740 --> 1:39:24.740]  Oh, New York. I'm sorry.
[1:39:24.740 --> 1:39:31.740]  That's okay. You just proved in that little story that you told that discretion is indeed the better part of valor.
[1:39:31.740 --> 1:39:36.740]  For you to have not done that, it wasn't worth the beating for sure.
[1:39:36.740 --> 1:39:43.740]  And I would like to say also that, you know, I'm kind of sad to hear all these horrible reports of police.
[1:39:43.740 --> 1:39:47.740]  I would like to hear occasionally some of the good things that they do.
[1:39:47.740 --> 1:39:56.740]  I mean, even Alex says that, by and large, the vast majority of the police are doing okay, but it's these rogue guys that are just ruining it for everybody.
[1:39:56.740 --> 1:40:04.740]  That's point one I'd like to make, and point number two, I've been in the 9-11 Truth Movement since August of 02.
[1:40:04.740 --> 1:40:08.740]  And I can't imagine anybody who could answer the question better than you.
[1:40:08.740 --> 1:40:12.740]  How far away do you think we are from the tipping point?
[1:40:12.740 --> 1:40:15.740]  And if and when it does tip, what do you think the result will be?
[1:40:15.740 --> 1:40:17.740]  I mean, will we get our rights back?
[1:40:17.740 --> 1:40:21.740]  Alright, here's my answer for it.
[1:40:21.740 --> 1:40:28.740]  Tipping point, I feel like we've already reached the tipping point when you have people like Rosie O'Donnell on a mainstream TV show,
[1:40:28.740 --> 1:40:33.740]  like the view expressing truth about 9-11 and them being fired, yeah, we're at a tipping point.
[1:40:33.740 --> 1:40:40.740]  When you have a former governor, Jesse Ventura, going on handy and combs, and not even really being attacked for his views on 9-11, yeah, we're at a tipping point.
[1:40:40.740 --> 1:40:48.740]  The problem is that the administration that most people think are behind the attacks, at least that know this alternative narrative,
[1:40:48.740 --> 1:40:53.740]  and the Bush administration is still in power, and to some extent there were those within the Bush administration
[1:40:53.740 --> 1:40:57.740]  that were absolutely involved in the planning and the execution of this attack.
[1:40:57.740 --> 1:41:00.740]  Everybody, of course not. Even Bush himself, I doubt.
[1:41:00.740 --> 1:41:06.740]  But, as I've been saying on the radio, I feel like once this administration is out, we're going to see a lot more lie-hop,
[1:41:06.740 --> 1:41:08.740]  or let it happen on purpose stuff, come out.
[1:41:08.740 --> 1:41:13.740]  For instance, student scholars for 9-11 Truth confronted Joe Biden about six months ago about able danger,
[1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:20.740]  and he grabbed Justin Martel, put his arm around him, he said, you know, there's going to be a lot coming out about 9-11 in the next few years.
[1:41:20.740 --> 1:41:25.740]  And this same man, when he was confronted by Luke Rudowski about his meeting with General Mamoud Ahmed,
[1:41:25.740 --> 1:41:31.740]  the Pakistani funding arm of the hijackers, he said it was classified after he actually admitted that he wasn't a meeting,
[1:41:31.740 --> 1:41:33.740]  and he was telling them to stop funding him.
[1:41:33.740 --> 1:41:35.740]  So we're going to see that kind of stuff come out.
[1:41:35.740 --> 1:41:37.740]  Now, will we get our rights back?
[1:41:37.740 --> 1:41:39.740]  You know, I doubt it.
[1:41:39.740 --> 1:41:45.740]  I think that they're going to let it out at such an incremental level, it'll never even be up for discussion in the mainstream media
[1:41:45.740 --> 1:41:50.740]  that we need to now eviscerate the Patriot acts one and two, and we need to get rid of Homeland Security.
[1:41:50.740 --> 1:41:55.740]  I mean, they've really entrenched Homeland Security as now a staple of the United States.
[1:41:55.740 --> 1:41:58.740]  They're talking about having high schools for training.
[1:41:58.740 --> 1:42:03.740]  You know, they already have college programs in criminal justice where you can go right into DHS.
[1:42:03.740 --> 1:42:10.740]  I pray to God that within the next two years, something does happen where the masses are awakened
[1:42:10.740 --> 1:42:16.740]  and we get out into the street, not by the thousands, but by the tens and hundreds of thousands, if not millions.
[1:42:16.740 --> 1:42:19.740]  And then maybe, then maybe, we can see a difference.
[1:42:19.740 --> 1:42:22.740]  Then maybe we can start to get our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[1:42:22.740 --> 1:42:26.740]  Maybe we can start reforming Congress and the Senate.
[1:42:26.740 --> 1:42:32.740]  But until we have that kind of reformation where our leaders are foreign by the people,
[1:42:32.740 --> 1:42:37.740]  people like you and me that actually care about people and aren't these millionaires and billionaires in business
[1:42:37.740 --> 1:42:41.740]  with the lobbyists that put them in office, we're not going to see a change.
[1:42:41.740 --> 1:42:44.740]  I mean, that's just the bottom line in my opinion, Stuart.
[1:42:44.740 --> 1:42:47.740]  I don't know, what do you think?
[1:42:47.740 --> 1:42:49.740]  I was disappointed to hear those words.
[1:42:49.740 --> 1:42:54.740]  I was kind of hoping that some previous Supreme Court decisions might reverse some of these things
[1:42:54.740 --> 1:42:59.740]  like in the Patriot Act, specifically Marbury versus Madison.
[1:42:59.740 --> 1:43:02.740]  Well, there's a ton of that stuff.
[1:43:02.740 --> 1:43:05.740]  Listen, the Supreme Court, though, who is it appointed by?
[1:43:05.740 --> 1:43:08.740]  It's been appointed by the last couple administrations
[1:43:08.740 --> 1:43:11.740]  and the Clinton administration isn't better than the Bush administration.
[1:43:11.740 --> 1:43:15.740]  It just sounded slicker and it felt better because we weren't at war with two sovereign nations
[1:43:15.740 --> 1:43:17.740]  and the economy was good.
[1:43:17.740 --> 1:43:22.740]  In reality, the Clinton family, Bill and Hill, were running Coke in the 80s
[1:43:22.740 --> 1:43:25.740]  for George Bush Sr. through Iran Contra and me in Arkansas.
[1:43:25.740 --> 1:43:28.740]  I mean, Selle Castillo has been on the show talking about that.
[1:43:28.740 --> 1:43:33.740]  Look, man, I hope that we can have some kind of a revelation of the minds
[1:43:33.740 --> 1:43:36.740]  and we can get this going.
[1:43:36.740 --> 1:43:40.740]  People like Judge Roberts and Judge Alito on the Supreme Court, they're not there for us
[1:43:40.740 --> 1:43:42.740]  and I don't think they're ever going to rule in favor of the people
[1:43:42.740 --> 1:43:47.740]  and I know that is disappointing, but I think that we just have to keep railing on the general populace
[1:43:47.740 --> 1:43:51.740]  and keep informing them so that we can get the masses out into the streets
[1:43:51.740 --> 1:43:53.740]  and we can get a real change in this country.
[1:43:53.740 --> 1:43:55.740]  I thank you for the call, Stuart.
[1:43:55.740 --> 1:43:59.740]  Let's go to Jonathan in Colorado. Is this my boy, Jonathan?
[1:43:59.740 --> 1:44:01.740]  Yeah, Jason, this is Jonathan. How are you doing?
[1:44:01.740 --> 1:44:06.740]  I'm doing good, man. I see that you posted a new blog over at thelooshchange911.com
[1:44:06.740 --> 1:44:09.740]  say we have a new little blogger over there.
[1:44:09.740 --> 1:44:16.740]  Oh, yeah. No, no. I didn't post that. I don't believe.
[1:44:16.740 --> 1:44:20.740]  Oh, wait, well, this must be a separate, I'm thinking Jonathan from We Are Changed Colorado.
[1:44:20.740 --> 1:44:22.740]  This must be a separate Jonathan, I'm sorry.
[1:44:22.740 --> 1:44:27.740]  But one thing I want to do is become involved with that group.
[1:44:27.740 --> 1:44:29.740]  Oh, yeah, you should.
[1:44:29.740 --> 1:44:30.740]  Go ahead.
[1:44:30.740 --> 1:44:37.740]  I just want to get back. You were talking earlier about how the churches were being contacted
[1:44:37.740 --> 1:44:47.740]  and the ministers or preachers are being told that they need to talk to their parishioners
[1:44:47.740 --> 1:44:54.740]  and talk them through how they should submit to government and government as God.
[1:44:54.740 --> 1:45:03.740]  This is a call that I made to Alex a while back and I really didn't, I guess, express myself clearly.
[1:45:03.740 --> 1:45:06.740]  Head Haggard, as you remember from the New Life Church.
[1:45:06.740 --> 1:45:08.740]  Yeah, the Crystal Method.
[1:45:08.740 --> 1:45:12.740]  Right. That happened with Alex. He is not.
[1:45:12.740 --> 1:45:16.740]  What happened, he started a church and I know him personally.
[1:45:16.740 --> 1:45:19.740]  Oh, I heard your call. I remember listening to you. Go ahead.
[1:45:19.740 --> 1:45:35.740]  Yeah, from about three people who built it to one of the largest churches in the country, himself, is a very, very honest individual, very high moral standing individual.
[1:45:35.740 --> 1:45:40.740]  He was approached and I'm going to make this quick and then get off because I'm a little afraid to make this call.
[1:45:40.740 --> 1:45:46.740]  But he was approached and told that he was going to do this and he refused.
[1:45:46.740 --> 1:45:56.740]  Everything happened after he refused their orders or to submit to what they wanted him to do.
[1:45:56.740 --> 1:46:03.740]  That's the kind of moral individual he is. He said it will not happen and that's what happened.
[1:46:03.740 --> 1:46:11.740]  So you're saying that Haggard was approached for this Romans 13 program where he calls this flock into FEMA death camps and he said no.
[1:46:11.740 --> 1:46:17.740]  And that's the reason that he was set up with this homosexual prostitute in Crystal Meth?
[1:46:17.740 --> 1:46:21.740]  Well, you can come to your own conclusion about why he was set up with that.
[1:46:21.740 --> 1:46:29.740]  But I will tell you, I've known him for years and he would, the last person on earth that would do that.
[1:46:29.740 --> 1:46:34.740]  I know who the prostitute was that they brought in. He was actually a White House prostitute.
[1:46:34.740 --> 1:46:38.740]  And I think he was actually at the Bohemian Grove.
[1:46:38.740 --> 1:46:40.740]  Oh, that's lovely.
[1:46:40.740 --> 1:46:44.740]  Anyway, that's what really happened.
[1:46:44.740 --> 1:46:54.740]  And he demonized and I'm very sorry it happened to him because he's one of the greatest people you'll ever meet.
[1:46:54.740 --> 1:47:00.740]  But anyway, that's just what I wanted to let you know and it's one of those unfortunate situations.
[1:47:00.740 --> 1:47:05.740]  And there are more of them out there. He just happened to be very, very big worldwide.
[1:47:05.740 --> 1:47:07.740]  And so they made it.
[1:47:07.740 --> 1:47:09.740]  They made a point out of him.
[1:47:09.740 --> 1:47:10.740]  All right, Jonathan.
[1:47:10.740 --> 1:47:18.740]  That was it. Jason, you're doing a great job and I have all of your videos and I have Alex Jones, most of his videos.
[1:47:18.740 --> 1:47:25.740]  And I subscribe and I listen almost every day. So keep up the good work and I do want to get involved with We Are Changed Colorado.
[1:47:25.740 --> 1:47:30.740]  Well, you should. WeAreChanged.org is the big overseeing site.
[1:47:30.740 --> 1:47:33.740]  And on the left-hand side are flags throughout the country and throughout the world.
[1:47:33.740 --> 1:47:37.740]  You click on those, those will go to the local We Are Changed chapters in your area.
[1:47:37.740 --> 1:47:42.740]  And we are encouraging as many people to be involved with We Are Changed as possible.
[1:47:42.740 --> 1:47:44.740]  And thanks for the kind word, Jonathan.
[1:47:44.740 --> 1:47:50.740]  I hope somebody does look into that because if Haggard was set up, that does deserve to be brought to light.
[1:47:50.740 --> 1:47:55.740]  I'm not a huge fan of any of these evangelicals that go on TV or whatever.
[1:47:55.740 --> 1:48:02.740]  But if he is one of the guys that stood up against this program and then was set up, that should come to light to the public.
[1:48:02.740 --> 1:48:06.740]  All right, let's go to Joel in Texas. Joel, are you with me?
[1:48:06.740 --> 1:48:07.740]  Yeah, I'm with you, Jason.
[1:48:07.740 --> 1:48:08.740]  How are you doing, man?
[1:48:08.740 --> 1:48:09.740]  Good. How are you?
[1:48:09.740 --> 1:48:10.740]  I'm good, man. What's up?
[1:48:10.740 --> 1:48:17.740]  Ah, good job on the videos. Everybody's been telling you so I don't want to get in there and grieve you too much.
[1:48:17.740 --> 1:48:22.740]  One of the things that I want to talk to you about real quickly was, I thought it was pretty weird.
[1:48:22.740 --> 1:48:29.740]  I took my, had a wedding to go to out San Diego this last week and ended up taking my family to SeaWorld.
[1:48:29.740 --> 1:48:37.740]  And one of the things that kind of caught me off guard was they have electronic thumbprint scanning.
[1:48:37.740 --> 1:48:40.740]  Okay. At SeaWorld now.
[1:48:40.740 --> 1:48:43.740]  Oh yeah, it's been there for quite, I think it's been there now like three years.
[1:48:43.740 --> 1:48:49.740]  In fact, I remember when Alex Jones went there, it's somewhere on his prismplanet.tv site.
[1:48:49.740 --> 1:48:55.740]  He goes there and he actually hangs back in the back with all the workers telling them how bad the thumb scanning is at SeaWorld.
[1:48:55.740 --> 1:48:56.740]  Go ahead.
[1:48:56.740 --> 1:48:59.740]  I got to check that out. I wasn't sure if you guys knew about that.
[1:48:59.740 --> 1:49:00.740]  Oh yeah.
[1:49:00.740 --> 1:49:10.740]  The other thing that I was going to talk to you about just getting it out there is obviously you, I know you have extensive knowledge of what's going on out there and everything,
[1:49:10.740 --> 1:49:17.740]  but I just recently found out that Rockefeller owns 80% of the stock in ExxonMobil.
[1:49:17.740 --> 1:49:20.740]  Well, that all comes from standard oil money back in the day.
[1:49:20.740 --> 1:49:21.740]  Right.
[1:49:21.740 --> 1:49:28.740]  So, I've been going to ExxonMobil filling up my tank all this time and it's like, now that I found this out,
[1:49:28.740 --> 1:49:37.740]  it's like, why? I mean, this last year they had the record-breaking world profits for any corporation ever.
[1:49:37.740 --> 1:49:47.740]  Isn't that lovely that the oil companies can just start charging whatever they want for gas, creating this scarcity that doesn't really even exist
[1:49:47.740 --> 1:49:55.740]  after they take over the second largest oil-rich nation in the world, Iraq, and then they can post record profits for two years in a row.
[1:49:55.740 --> 1:49:59.740]  Two years in a row, the oil companies are having record profits and nothing is done.
[1:49:59.740 --> 1:50:00.740]  Right.
[1:50:00.740 --> 1:50:12.740]  And I mean, and then the fact that, you know, Rockefeller owns 80% of the family owns 80% of the stock and then that, you know, them and Rothschild have acquired a majority share of the world agriculture
[1:50:12.740 --> 1:50:17.740]  and they're starting to look into, you know, suppressing that market.
[1:50:17.740 --> 1:50:26.740]  It's just like, you know, it's world domination but it just seems like, you know, anybody out there that didn't know they should just stop using ExxonMobil.
[1:50:26.740 --> 1:50:30.740]  Well, absolutely. I think that people should educate themselves on the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.
[1:50:30.740 --> 1:50:34.740]  I think the Documentary Money Masters covers it very, very well.
[1:50:34.740 --> 1:50:38.740]  Joel, I thank you for the call. We're going to take some more callers on the other side.
[1:50:38.740 --> 1:50:41.740]  And then Paul Joseph Watson joining us at the top of the hour.

[1:53:45.740 --> 1:53:50.740]  866-497-0274.
[1:53:50.740 --> 1:53:54.740]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[1:53:54.740 --> 1:53:58.740]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:54:02.740 --> 1:54:04.740]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:54:04.740 --> 1:54:08.740]  the final segment before we go to the top of the hour with Paul Joseph Watson,
[1:54:08.740 --> 1:54:11.740]  the PrisonPlanet.com webmaster,
[1:54:11.740 --> 1:54:14.740]  accomplished author of Order Out of Chaos,
[1:54:14.740 --> 1:54:16.740]  working on another project right now.
[1:54:16.740 --> 1:54:20.740]  We're going to get his take on the current state of the police state
[1:54:20.740 --> 1:54:24.740]  and of course of the U.S. economy that's just going into the pits.
[1:54:24.740 --> 1:54:26.740]  But before that, we're going to take another call.
[1:54:26.740 --> 1:54:29.740]  Let's go to Bill in Illinois.
[1:54:29.740 --> 1:54:31.740]  Bill, are you with us?
[1:54:31.740 --> 1:54:32.740]  Hi, Jason.
[1:54:32.740 --> 1:54:33.740]  Hey, man, how you doing?
[1:54:33.740 --> 1:54:34.740]  Good.
[1:54:34.740 --> 1:54:36.740]  I'm going to ask kind of an odd question,
[1:54:36.740 --> 1:54:37.740]  but please play along with me.
[1:54:37.740 --> 1:54:39.740]  You'll see where I'm going.
[1:54:39.740 --> 1:54:42.740]  In all your years, Jason, have you ever seen a talking snake?
[1:54:42.740 --> 1:54:43.740]  No.
[1:54:43.740 --> 1:54:45.740]  You've never seen a talking snake?
[1:54:45.740 --> 1:54:47.740]  Well, I have seen two.
[1:54:47.740 --> 1:54:51.740]  One was in Robin Hood and one was in The Jungle Book,
[1:54:51.740 --> 1:54:55.740]  both put out by Walt Disney, who does Maple Leaf.
[1:54:55.740 --> 1:55:01.740]  What is funny is more people in America believe in a talking snake
[1:55:01.740 --> 1:55:05.740]  than they do in their government attacking them.
[1:55:05.740 --> 1:55:08.740]  And they call us conspiracy nuts.
[1:55:08.740 --> 1:55:09.740]  Well, yeah.
[1:55:09.740 --> 1:55:11.740]  People love fantasy, man.
[1:55:11.740 --> 1:55:13.740]  They're so wrapped up in the nonsense.
[1:55:13.740 --> 1:55:17.740]  I mean, that should be apparent to the fact that the single moms out there
[1:55:17.740 --> 1:55:19.740]  that don't work or not even the single moms,
[1:55:19.740 --> 1:55:22.740]  but just the moms out there that are hooked on these soap operas, man.
[1:55:22.740 --> 1:55:25.740]  I mean, how bad are those productions of guiding light
[1:55:25.740 --> 1:55:26.740]  and all that other stuff?
[1:55:26.740 --> 1:55:29.740]  And they'd rather believe that reality than the real one, dude.
[1:55:29.740 --> 1:55:31.740]  It's just really sad, isn't it, Jason?
[1:55:31.740 --> 1:55:36.740]  I think it's extremely sad that we're in a consumerist mall type culture
[1:55:36.740 --> 1:55:38.740]  that it's all about what kind of car you drive,
[1:55:38.740 --> 1:55:41.740]  what kind of shoes you wear, what kind of hair products you use,
[1:55:41.740 --> 1:55:46.740]  and not about what kind of person you are or, you know, how much you know.
[1:55:46.740 --> 1:55:47.740]  Exactly.
[1:55:47.740 --> 1:55:48.740]  Or you're involved in the community.
[1:55:48.740 --> 1:55:53.740]  I mean, it seems to me that almost no one out there who's involved
[1:55:53.740 --> 1:55:57.740]  in local community gets the kind of credit they deserve.
[1:55:57.740 --> 1:56:00.740]  I'm one of them.
[1:56:00.740 --> 1:56:03.740]  I got one other bit of info on the police state for you.
[1:56:03.740 --> 1:56:09.740]  I live in the town of Naperville, and it was reported to me by Girl Scout leaders
[1:56:09.740 --> 1:56:14.740]  that our town is sitting on 20 military vehicles, AAVs,
[1:56:14.740 --> 1:56:17.740]  that say Department of Homeland Security on them.
[1:56:17.740 --> 1:56:20.740]  When I called up the police department and asked about it,
[1:56:20.740 --> 1:56:23.740]  first they wanted to know if I knew where they were.
[1:56:23.740 --> 1:56:26.740]  I told them, of course, I don't know exactly where they are,
[1:56:26.740 --> 1:56:27.740]  I know they're back there.
[1:56:27.740 --> 1:56:30.740]  And he said, yeah, so what if we have them?
[1:56:30.740 --> 1:56:31.740]  Oh, yeah, so what?
[1:56:31.740 --> 1:56:33.740]  What do you need them for?
[1:56:33.740 --> 1:56:34.740]  He said, for terrorists.
[1:56:34.740 --> 1:56:35.740]  And I started laughing.
[1:56:35.740 --> 1:56:39.740]  I said, you mean like the FBI attacking the World Trade Towers in 93,
[1:56:39.740 --> 1:56:41.740]  96 and 2001?
[1:56:41.740 --> 1:56:44.740]  And he started laughing at me, like, you know.
[1:56:44.740 --> 1:56:48.740]  It's real funny that our federal government is provocaturing
[1:56:48.740 --> 1:56:50.740]  and helping attacks on the United States.
[1:56:50.740 --> 1:56:53.740]  I mean, it's real funny that they hire a guy named Ahmed Salam,
[1:56:53.740 --> 1:56:57.740]  an Egyptian army officer to infiltrate a few retards,
[1:56:57.740 --> 1:56:59.740]  legally retarded people, folks,
[1:56:59.740 --> 1:57:03.740]  and build the bomb, rent the truck, carry out the attack,
[1:57:03.740 --> 1:57:05.740]  and then blame it on these guys.
[1:57:05.740 --> 1:57:07.740]  Yeah, that's real hilarious.
[1:57:07.740 --> 1:57:09.740]  But you've got to understand, Bill, I mean,
[1:57:09.740 --> 1:57:11.740]  look at all the cop cars that are out there now.
[1:57:11.740 --> 1:57:12.740]  Oh, yeah.
[1:57:12.740 --> 1:57:14.740]  At least in New York, they're starting to take,
[1:57:14.740 --> 1:57:15.740]  they're not starting, they are.
[1:57:15.740 --> 1:57:17.740]  They're taking the top lights off of the cars.
[1:57:17.740 --> 1:57:20.740]  Almost every car now has no top lights,
[1:57:20.740 --> 1:57:23.740]  so it's indistinguishable that it's actually a police car
[1:57:23.740 --> 1:57:24.740]  until you see the decals.
[1:57:24.740 --> 1:57:26.740]  And then another set of these cars
[1:57:26.740 --> 1:57:28.740]  don't even have the decals on them anymore.
[1:57:28.740 --> 1:57:33.740]  Well, I just went past Wrigley Field actually last week during a game,
[1:57:33.740 --> 1:57:37.740]  and I mean, you can swing a dead cat without hitting a cop car,
[1:57:37.740 --> 1:57:38.740]  without lights on him.
[1:57:38.740 --> 1:57:39.740]  I hear you, man.
[1:57:39.740 --> 1:57:40.740]  It's crazy.
[1:57:40.740 --> 1:57:41.740]  It's ridiculous.
[1:57:41.740 --> 1:57:42.740]  Keep up the great work, Jason.
[1:57:42.740 --> 1:57:43.740]  All right, thanks, Bill.
[1:57:43.740 --> 1:57:44.740]  I appreciate it.
[1:57:44.740 --> 1:57:46.740]  All right, let's jump to Paul in Oregon.
[1:57:46.740 --> 1:57:47.740]  Paul.
[1:57:47.740 --> 1:57:48.740]  Jason, how are you?
[1:57:48.740 --> 1:57:49.740]  Good, man.
[1:57:49.740 --> 1:57:50.740]  How are you?
[1:57:50.740 --> 1:57:51.740]  I'm all right.
[1:57:51.740 --> 1:57:53.740]  I just wanted to talk about Portland, Oregon, where I'm from.
[1:57:53.740 --> 1:57:55.740]  If you can get people out here,
[1:57:55.740 --> 1:57:58.740]  I mean, you need to see what they're doing here.
[1:57:58.740 --> 1:58:01.740]  We have cameras everywhere.
[1:58:01.740 --> 1:58:06.740]  We have an intersection in southeast Portland,
[1:58:06.740 --> 1:58:11.740]  82nd and Powell, that has face recognition cameras on the crosswalk.
[1:58:11.740 --> 1:58:13.740]  I'm talking, it is just crazy.
[1:58:13.740 --> 1:58:16.740]  Well, I do have a good friend out there,
[1:58:16.740 --> 1:58:18.740]  my buddy who got that last Clinton confrontation.
[1:58:18.740 --> 1:58:19.740]  I'll have to check it out.
[1:58:19.740 --> 1:58:20.740]  Paul, thanks for the call.
[1:58:20.740 --> 1:58:21.740]  We're going to have Paul just for Watson.
[1:58:21.740 --> 1:58:50.740]  After this, christenplan.com.
[1:58:50.740 --> 1:58:52.740]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[1:58:52.740 --> 1:58:56.740]  Is that their objective being world domination?
[1:58:56.740 --> 1:58:59.740]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:58:59.740 --> 1:59:02.740]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[1:59:02.740 --> 1:59:09.740]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:09.740 --> 1:59:11.740]  For the first time in history,
[1:59:11.740 --> 1:59:15.740]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:59:15.740 --> 1:59:19.740]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:59:19.740 --> 1:59:21.740]  I think it's making great progress toward the world government.
[1:59:21.740 --> 1:59:22.740]  Most people have no idea.
[1:59:22.740 --> 1:59:23.740]  They're not after money.
[1:59:23.740 --> 1:59:24.740]  They have all the money they need.
[1:59:24.740 --> 1:59:25.740]  They're after power.
[1:59:25.740 --> 1:59:50.740]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:59:50.740 --> 1:59:58.740]  Dear government cover-ups, you want answers?
[1:59:58.740 --> 2:00:00.740]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:00.740 --> 2:00:04.740]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:04.740 --> 2:00:10.740]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:10.740 --> 2:00:13.740]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back at the top of the hour.
[2:00:13.740 --> 2:00:18.740]  And I want to remind everybody that the 9-11 Chronicles Part 1 Truth Rising
[2:00:18.740 --> 2:00:20.740]  is going to be pre-screened.
[2:00:20.740 --> 2:00:23.740]  That's why you're going to get an opportunity to see it before it's released.
[2:00:23.740 --> 2:00:27.740]  Over at the Alamo Draft House on Saturday, May 17th and Sunday, May 18th.
[2:00:27.740 --> 2:00:30.740]  It's 4 p.m. on Saturday, 7 p.m. on Sunday.
[2:00:30.740 --> 2:00:37.740]  Again, a film unlike any other by Alex Jones, cinema verite style, with interviews.
[2:00:37.740 --> 2:00:42.740]  I mean, Willie Nelson, Rosie O'Donnell, Jesse Wenterer, George Carlin, Martin Sheen.
[2:00:42.740 --> 2:00:48.740]  You know, as well as confrontations with Bill Clinton, David Rockefeller, Schwarzenegger, Hillary Clinton, Obama,
[2:00:48.740 --> 2:00:53.740]  John McCain's in there, Gary Hart, total pro-New World Order guy, member of the CFR.
[2:00:53.740 --> 2:00:58.740]  It's a jam-packed action-adventure funfest, in my opinion.
[2:00:58.740 --> 2:01:01.740]  And I hope everybody goes out there and checks it out.
[2:01:01.740 --> 2:01:05.740]  Because, you know, I sit here in this office all day, you know, editing through my movie
[2:01:05.740 --> 2:01:09.740]  and checking out, you know, Rob, who's editing the 9-11 Chronicles Part 1.
[2:01:09.740 --> 2:01:14.740]  And I am just totally impressed with this. I think it's going to bring even more people into the movement.
[2:01:14.740 --> 2:01:18.740]  And those in the movement are going to be motivated to actually take action.
[2:01:18.740 --> 2:01:23.740]  If you're not a member of WeAreChanged.org, if you're not a member of Student Scholars for 9-11 Truth,
[2:01:23.740 --> 2:01:29.740]  if you're not a member of TruthAction.org, which does great things on the 11th of every month throughout the country
[2:01:29.740 --> 2:01:31.740]  and throughout the world, you need to be.
[2:01:31.740 --> 2:01:36.740]  And this is going to show you why you need to be and how you can get involved at every level.
[2:01:36.740 --> 2:01:40.740]  You know, whether you do a radio show, whether you have a blog, whether you're the guy,
[2:01:40.740 --> 2:01:45.740]  you know, in the streets with burn DVDs, you know, you are helping, you are creating change.
[2:01:45.740 --> 2:01:49.740]  And that's why this movie, the 9-11 Chronicles, is so important and so different.
[2:01:49.740 --> 2:01:55.740]  I want to jump ship now to Paul Joseph Watson, who is the webmaster of PrismPlanet.com
[2:01:55.740 --> 2:01:57.740]  and an accomplished author on his own.
[2:01:57.740 --> 2:02:01.740]  Order Out of Chaos is one of my favorite New World Order books. I recommend it to everybody.
[2:02:01.740 --> 2:02:05.740]  It's over at the InfoWars Shop right now. I suggest you get it if you've never heard about it.
[2:02:05.740 --> 2:02:07.740]  Paul, how you doing?
[2:02:07.740 --> 2:02:09.740]  Hello, Jason. Good to be on the air.
[2:02:09.740 --> 2:02:13.740]  Yeah, it's awesome. It's awesome to actually get to have you on the air and talk to you.
[2:02:13.740 --> 2:02:15.740]  What are some of the top stories over at PrismPlanet?
[2:02:15.740 --> 2:02:21.740]  Obviously, the police state stuff for the last two days with the Philly cops beating those three gentlemen
[2:02:21.740 --> 2:02:27.740]  and then that one guy getting arrested for not putting on a turn signal are pretty high up there.
[2:02:27.740 --> 2:02:37.740]  Yeah, I think it's important to discuss an article that I posted on PrismPlanet yesterday, which was introduced
[2:02:37.740 --> 2:02:42.740]  on the basis of the tragedy in Burma, but it's not specifically about that.
[2:02:42.740 --> 2:02:48.740]  It's about putting in perspective the fact that what now they're saying,
[2:02:48.740 --> 2:02:51.740]  probably up to 200,000 people may have died because of this.
[2:02:51.740 --> 2:03:00.740]  And then comparing that to the level of fear-mongering put out about the apparent threat of terror by our government
[2:03:00.740 --> 2:03:04.740]  and doing a kind of benchmark comparison between the two.
[2:03:04.740 --> 2:03:13.740]  Yeah, I mean the comparison between 3,000 people killed now almost eight years ago.
[2:03:13.740 --> 2:03:22.740]  And 200,000 in one shot and yet it's on our TV every single day just pumping into our brains, drum beating,
[2:03:22.740 --> 2:03:25.740]  fear, terrorism, al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden.
[2:03:25.740 --> 2:03:31.740]  I mean they're still the major political tools for those running for office in this country at least,
[2:03:31.740 --> 2:03:33.740]  and I'm sure throughout the world it's still brought up.
[2:03:33.740 --> 2:03:40.740]  And you have this tragedy where 200,000 people are dead and it receives barely any media coverage in this country.
[2:03:40.740 --> 2:03:48.740]  Right, and I mean it's basically it's important to stress first of all that we're not downplaying the horror or the pain
[2:03:48.740 --> 2:03:53.740]  of those families that suffered losses on 9-11 and other people that died.
[2:03:53.740 --> 2:03:57.740]  Obviously our entire movement is about helping those people.
[2:03:57.740 --> 2:04:04.740]  It's about putting the dangers that faces certainly in the West into perspective
[2:04:04.740 --> 2:04:10.740]  and then using the reality of the level of the threat as a benchmark with which to judge
[2:04:10.740 --> 2:04:15.740]  the fear mongering that government and the media ascribes to the threat of terror.
[2:04:15.740 --> 2:04:19.740]  Because if there are 900,000 people on the terror watch list
[2:04:19.740 --> 2:04:23.740]  and there are terror cells running around everywhere with a console
[2:04:23.740 --> 2:04:29.740]  reminded by the government and the media, then why is the only so-called terror incident in the West
[2:04:29.740 --> 2:04:37.740]  in the last three years being, you know, dumb and driving a Jeep Cherokee into a window at Glasgow Airport?
[2:04:37.740 --> 2:05:01.740]  Absolutely, we'll be back after this, PrisonPlanet.com.
[2:05:12.740 --> 2:05:14.740]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[2:05:14.740 --> 2:05:21.740]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[2:05:21.740 --> 2:05:26.740]  I hope Mr. Busch will hear this song for the heart of America wants this one.

[2:05:55.740 --> 2:06:00.740]  an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[2:06:00.740 --> 2:06:07.740]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions,
[2:06:07.740 --> 2:06:11.740]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[2:06:11.740 --> 2:06:15.740]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[2:06:15.740 --> 2:06:23.740]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[2:06:41.740 --> 2:06:47.740]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[2:06:47.740 --> 2:06:51.740]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[2:06:51.740 --> 2:06:55.740]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[2:06:55.740 --> 2:07:02.740]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually with the worst toll taken by antibiotics.
[2:07:02.740 --> 2:07:05.740]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[2:07:05.740 --> 2:07:15.740]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[2:07:15.740 --> 2:07:19.740]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[2:07:19.740 --> 2:07:22.740]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[2:07:22.740 --> 2:07:29.740]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers, and more.
[2:07:29.740 --> 2:07:35.740]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with oxysilver.

[2:07:46.740 --> 2:07:56.740]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:07:56.740 --> 2:07:59.740]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:07:59.740 --> 2:08:03.740]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:03.740 --> 2:08:08.740]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:08:08.740 --> 2:08:16.740]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I am Jason Burma, sitting in for Alex Jones for the next two days.
[2:08:16.740 --> 2:08:22.740]  We are with Paul Joseph Watson, accomplished author and webmaster of PrismPlanet.com.
[2:08:22.740 --> 2:08:24.740]  And we're talking terrorism and al-Qaeda.
[2:08:24.740 --> 2:08:34.740]  And Paul, I just want to get your take on the Washington Post now reporting that everybody who is involved in the U.S.S. coal bombing is either escaped or been let go.
[2:08:34.740 --> 2:08:39.740]  You'd think if Al-Qaeda was a real threat and that these guys were the actual guys behind the coal bombing,
[2:08:39.740 --> 2:08:45.740]  these guys would be the guys who were imprisoned at Gitmo or one of our other torture facilities.
[2:08:45.740 --> 2:08:50.740]  You know, these guys would be the guys under armed guard never to be let go.
[2:08:50.740 --> 2:09:02.740]  Well, yeah. I mean, it seems that in every case where a so-called al-Qaeda member can be proven to be an al-Qaeda member with links to bin Laden and so forth,
[2:09:02.740 --> 2:09:08.740]  which is rare because most of them turn out to be nothing more than pasties,
[2:09:08.740 --> 2:09:12.740]  then they get treated very well by the U.S. or British government.
[2:09:12.740 --> 2:09:19.740]  You had a guy in Britain called Abu Qatada that was called the European mastermind of al-Qaeda.
[2:09:19.740 --> 2:09:23.740]  He was controlling al-Qaeda in Europe for bin Laden.
[2:09:23.740 --> 2:09:29.740]  And yet he was given a safe house by MI5 and now he's being completely released.
[2:09:29.740 --> 2:09:40.740]  So they seem to take the highest, you know, the elite of al-Qaeda and give them comfort while they use the pasties on the lower level
[2:09:40.740 --> 2:09:48.740]  to propagandize about the massive threat of terror when they always turn out to be, you know, street gangs and so forth
[2:09:48.740 --> 2:09:51.740]  who have no means or capability to commit terror.
[2:09:51.740 --> 2:09:57.740]  Absolutely. And when they're setting up these type of pasties, they like to set up a little plausible deniability.
[2:09:57.740 --> 2:10:03.740]  I think that's why you saw the Pakistani ISI as being exposed as one of the funders,
[2:10:03.740 --> 2:10:08.740]  major funders of the quote-unquote hijackers with that $100,000 wire transfer.
[2:10:08.740 --> 2:10:17.740]  In reality, the ISI is so close to the CIA on the dot-gov site that actually tries to debunk the fact that we were in business
[2:10:17.740 --> 2:10:21.740]  with bin Laden during the Soviets invasion of Afghanistan.
[2:10:21.740 --> 2:10:25.740]  They say, oh, well, you know, we never gave any money to bin Laden directly.
[2:10:25.740 --> 2:10:30.740]  We funneled all of our money through the ISI. So we didn't really have any ties to bin Laden.
[2:10:30.740 --> 2:10:34.740]  Now, we know that's false. We know that, you know, Brzezinski and others did have ties to bin Laden.
[2:10:34.740 --> 2:10:43.740]  But they admit right there that they use the ISI as a conduit to fund these organizations and maintain that deniability.
[2:10:43.740 --> 2:10:47.740]  Well, exactly. They're always going to have front organizations so they can claim that.
[2:10:47.740 --> 2:10:53.740]  But anytime you get an ISI link, for example, we had the couple of summers ago,
[2:10:53.740 --> 2:10:58.740]  we had the, you know, the much-vaunted liquid bomb plot of which, you know,
[2:10:58.740 --> 2:11:02.740]  it turned out to be a contrived fraud, as most of them always do.
[2:11:02.740 --> 2:11:07.740]  You know, the alleged perpetrators had no passports, no airline tickets.
[2:11:07.740 --> 2:11:12.740]  Their behavior before the alleged attack suggested the complete opposite,
[2:11:12.740 --> 2:11:14.740]  that they were actually planning anything.
[2:11:14.740 --> 2:11:19.740]  And, of course, it turned out that this was all being run under ISI auspices.
[2:11:19.740 --> 2:11:25.740]  So every time you have that link, then it's proof that something very fishy indeed is going on.
[2:11:25.740 --> 2:11:29.740]  Yeah, absolutely. And it should just speak to the fact that, you know,
[2:11:29.740 --> 2:11:34.740]  obviously we were funding them through the ISI that the guy who did it, General Mammoud Ahmed,
[2:11:34.740 --> 2:11:38.740]  was never convicted of anything. He was just, you know, let go.
[2:11:38.740 --> 2:11:42.740]  He was able to retire almost unannounced and just kind of slip into the backdrop.
[2:11:42.740 --> 2:11:47.740]  Meanwhile, Omar Said Sheikh, the guy who facilitated this wire transfer,
[2:11:47.740 --> 2:11:52.740]  we've got a buttoe before she was murdered saying that this guy is an intelligence asset.
[2:11:52.740 --> 2:11:54.740]  He's got all sorts of intelligence ties.
[2:11:54.740 --> 2:11:57.740]  He's the guy behind the Daniel Pearl murder.
[2:11:57.740 --> 2:12:01.740]  And this stuff seems to fall through the cracks in the mainstream media.
[2:12:01.740 --> 2:12:06.740]  They don't want to report on actual government intelligence funding these guys. I wonder why.
[2:12:06.740 --> 2:12:11.740]  Well, yeah, I mean, Mammoud Ahmed was prior to 9-11.
[2:12:11.740 --> 2:12:14.740]  He was meeting with everyone. He was with the CIA.
[2:12:14.740 --> 2:12:20.740]  He was with Porter Goss. I mean, he was having breakfast with Goss and Graham on the very morning of 9-11.
[2:12:20.740 --> 2:12:24.740]  He was, you know, given red carpet treatment in the days before 9-11.
[2:12:24.740 --> 2:12:28.740]  And he was the chief financier of the alleged lead hijacker.
[2:12:28.740 --> 2:12:32.740]  And that makes no waves in the media. It's pathetic.
[2:12:32.740 --> 2:12:37.740]  It's absolutely pathetic. And then you look at, you know, Porter Goss and Bob Graham,
[2:12:37.740 --> 2:12:42.740]  they head up that initial congressional investigation where 27 pages are redacted.
[2:12:42.740 --> 2:12:47.740]  Graham goes on PBS television in December of 2002 and admits that
[2:12:47.740 --> 2:12:50.740]  there was overwhelming evidence of foreign governments.
[2:12:50.740 --> 2:12:55.740]  That's government's more than one involvement in not only the funding of the hijackers,
[2:12:55.740 --> 2:12:57.740]  but other facilitating as well.
[2:12:57.740 --> 2:13:01.740]  And then he was recently confronted by Philly 9-11 Truth.
[2:13:01.740 --> 2:13:05.740]  You can check out the video on the Internet where before he's even asked about anything,
[2:13:05.740 --> 2:13:10.740]  he's talking about his relationship with Mammoud Ahmed and how Mammoud Ahmed was there
[2:13:10.740 --> 2:13:14.740]  to play nice with the Taliban and al-Qaeda. And that was his job.
[2:13:14.740 --> 2:13:17.740]  You know, so then later on they ask him about the funding of it and,
[2:13:17.740 --> 2:13:20.740]  oh, I just don't know about the funding. I guess that, you know,
[2:13:20.740 --> 2:13:23.740]  maybe you guys uncovered something that the congressional investigation
[2:13:23.740 --> 2:13:26.740]  and the 9-11 commission just couldn't find.
[2:13:26.740 --> 2:13:30.740]  Yet, you know, he's on television on PBS saying that these governments that were involved
[2:13:30.740 --> 2:13:35.740]  will be classified for the next 20 to 30 years and won't be released until they're in the archives.
[2:13:35.740 --> 2:13:40.740]  Well, I ask you, why is it that we had this congressional investigation?
[2:13:40.740 --> 2:13:42.740]  We know that it's going to be classified for 20 to 30 years.
[2:13:42.740 --> 2:13:44.740]  What was the purpose of the 9-11 commission?
[2:13:44.740 --> 2:13:49.740]  I thought that they were supposed to do a full and complete accounting of what actually happened, Paul.
[2:13:49.740 --> 2:13:56.740]  Well, you knew exactly what the purpose was as soon as they appointed Kissinger as the head of it.
[2:13:56.740 --> 2:13:59.740]  I mean, talk about slapping the faith.
[2:13:59.740 --> 2:14:05.740]  But I mean, we were talking about the foundation of the police day,
[2:14:05.740 --> 2:14:11.740]  which was this apparent threat of terror, which the drumbeat is drilled into us every day.
[2:14:11.740 --> 2:14:17.740]  And the fact is that, you know, we're heard it through airports and train stations,
[2:14:17.740 --> 2:14:22.740]  whatever you want every day, and expected to acquiesce and be treated like scum.
[2:14:22.740 --> 2:14:28.740]  Because of the threat of terror, and in almost every example, as you've just illustrated,
[2:14:28.740 --> 2:14:34.740]  it's governments that are behind it, provocateurs, financiers, all linked to the government.
[2:14:34.740 --> 2:14:41.740]  But they're slowly rolling out the same measures, you know, into every facet of our lives,
[2:14:41.740 --> 2:14:43.740]  and that forms the foundation of the police day.
[2:14:43.740 --> 2:14:50.740]  But what's important to put in perspective is the fact that terrorism, as a supposed threat,
[2:14:50.740 --> 2:15:00.740]  is, according to the figures, is less deadly to Westerners than accident-causing deer and peanut allergies.
[2:15:00.740 --> 2:15:05.740]  And that's according to Ohio State University report.
[2:15:05.740 --> 2:15:08.740]  Well, it's absolutely true. I mean, you know, I'm an upstate New York guy,
[2:15:08.740 --> 2:15:10.740]  and there's tons of deaths with deer.
[2:15:10.740 --> 2:15:12.740]  I've been in four car accidents with deer, actually.
[2:15:12.740 --> 2:15:15.740]  I've been lucky, you know, not actually getting too hurt.
[2:15:15.740 --> 2:15:20.740]  Absolutely. I mean, you had 3,000 people die in 2001 in this country.
[2:15:20.740 --> 2:15:22.740]  And since then, zero.
[2:15:22.740 --> 2:15:27.740]  And what's interesting to me is student scholars just went and got the press secretary.
[2:15:27.740 --> 2:15:28.740]  I forget what her name is.
[2:15:28.740 --> 2:15:32.740]  And they bring up the fact that, hey, you guys tried to appoint Kissinger.
[2:15:32.740 --> 2:15:35.740]  Hey, you know, look at all these different things.
[2:15:35.740 --> 2:15:38.740]  Bush and Cheney testified together, not under oath.
[2:15:38.740 --> 2:15:41.740]  And then she starts saying, well, you better check your sources,
[2:15:41.740 --> 2:15:44.740]  because some of those sources are wrong, and they're giving you disinformation.
[2:15:44.740 --> 2:15:49.740]  And it's not an accident that we haven't been attacked since 9-11.
[2:15:49.740 --> 2:15:52.740]  And that's their big talking point when they have nothing else to say is,
[2:15:52.740 --> 2:15:55.740]  it's not an accident we haven't been attacked since 9-11.
[2:15:55.740 --> 2:15:57.740]  And I'd say, yeah, it's not an accident.
[2:15:57.740 --> 2:16:02.740]  It's because of people like you and me going out and informing the, you know, world populace
[2:16:02.740 --> 2:16:06.740]  that 9-11 was indeed a false flag attack that has stopped them
[2:16:06.740 --> 2:16:08.740]  from carrying out another false flag attack in this country.
[2:16:08.740 --> 2:16:13.740]  I believe if they try anything short of some kind of nuclear holocaust in this country,
[2:16:13.740 --> 2:16:16.740]  most of the people are going to wise up at least a third of us.
[2:16:16.740 --> 2:16:19.740]  You know, people are going to point to the government right away.
[2:16:19.740 --> 2:16:22.740]  There's too many shady things going on with 9-11.
[2:16:22.740 --> 2:16:26.740]  And the mainstream media just ignores us, tries to marginalize us,
[2:16:26.740 --> 2:16:30.740]  even when, you know, State Senator Karen Johnson of Arizona goes public,
[2:16:30.740 --> 2:16:33.740]  or former Governor Jesse Ventura goes public, you know,
[2:16:33.740 --> 2:16:37.740]  or, you know, scientists like Stephen Jones, architects like Richard Gage,
[2:16:37.740 --> 2:16:41.740]  they're all marginalized, or they're just called completely crazy
[2:16:41.740 --> 2:16:45.740]  without any evidence whatsoever.
[2:16:45.740 --> 2:16:51.740]  Exactly. And I mean, the Bush administration could, they claim success
[2:16:51.740 --> 2:16:56.740]  in preventing terror, you know, in America since 2001.
[2:16:56.740 --> 2:16:58.740]  But it has nothing to do with their success.
[2:16:58.740 --> 2:17:02.740]  They wrote in the article because the same pattern can be observed
[2:17:02.740 --> 2:17:05.740]  throughout the 20th century before 9-11.
[2:17:05.740 --> 2:17:10.740]  I mean, as you were talking about, it's the equivalent of
[2:17:10.740 --> 2:17:15.740]  11, let me get the figures exactly.
[2:17:15.740 --> 2:17:19.740]  He talks about, you've been in four accidents.
[2:17:19.740 --> 2:17:25.740]  I've got it here. To equal the danger that Americans place themselves in every day,
[2:17:25.740 --> 2:17:31.740]  by simply driving down the highway, there would need to be September 11th every month.
[2:17:31.740 --> 2:17:36.740]  And to reach the same level of risk that you undertake in boarding an airline,
[2:17:36.740 --> 2:17:42.740]  you know, in terms of a potential accident, you only have to travel 11 miles in a car.
[2:17:42.740 --> 2:17:47.740]  So that puts into perspective this grand threat which is called, you know,
[2:17:47.740 --> 2:17:52.740]  the greatest fundamental threat to civilization, terrorism,
[2:17:52.740 --> 2:17:57.740]  puts it in perspective in comparison to the real dangers that are out there
[2:17:57.740 --> 2:18:02.740]  that we go through every day and we risk our lives in doing so,
[2:18:02.740 --> 2:18:07.740]  because for the sake of mobility and freedom.
[2:18:07.740 --> 2:18:12.740]  Well, I think they're really good at manipulating our already-there fears.
[2:18:12.740 --> 2:18:15.740]  There's still a lot of people in the world who are just afraid of flying in general.
[2:18:15.740 --> 2:18:19.740]  So, you know, you couple that with the terrorism threat and it's twice as terrifying.
[2:18:19.740 --> 2:18:21.740]  You know what I mean, Paul?
[2:18:21.740 --> 2:18:25.740]  Yeah, exactly. And they don't often do their best to make you feel scared
[2:18:25.740 --> 2:18:27.740]  when you go into an airport, do they?
[2:18:27.740 --> 2:18:30.740]  And again, that was, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[2:18:30.740 --> 2:18:34.740]  You have this ridiculous liquid bomb plot.
[2:18:34.740 --> 2:18:37.740]  And then a week later, we were all forced to, you know,
[2:18:37.740 --> 2:18:42.740]  carry these little see-through plastic slate bags if we had a tiny bottle of aftershave.
[2:18:42.740 --> 2:18:45.740]  You had mothers being forced to drink their own baby milk.
[2:18:45.740 --> 2:18:50.740]  If you get into the details of it, there's no way you could build a liquid bomb
[2:18:50.740 --> 2:18:54.740]  of any intensity with the kind of material that they had
[2:18:54.740 --> 2:18:57.740]  and the space and the time in which they had to do it,
[2:18:57.740 --> 2:19:01.740]  even if you believe that they would have got on the plane in the first place
[2:19:01.740 --> 2:19:03.740]  with no passports or airline tickets.
[2:19:03.740 --> 2:19:06.740]  And yet, you know, we're all made to feel like suspects
[2:19:06.740 --> 2:19:10.740]  for the crime of carrying a Diet Coke onto an airplane.
[2:19:10.740 --> 2:19:15.740]  So it's just this feeling that you get when you go into an airport.
[2:19:15.740 --> 2:19:18.740]  And I mean, that's what they want to roll out on the streets.
[2:19:18.740 --> 2:19:24.740]  And they're changing the very nature of our way of life to combat this threat
[2:19:24.740 --> 2:19:30.740]  when the threat in comparison to the real dangers that we all live through is miniscule.
[2:19:30.740 --> 2:19:32.740]  I'm with you, Paul. It's all about fear and control.
[2:19:32.740 --> 2:19:35.740]  And that's what they're bringing to us in this country and throughout the world.
[2:19:35.740 --> 2:19:38.740]  That's what this globalist plot is all about.
[2:19:38.740 --> 2:19:42.740]  We'll be back after this with Paul Joseph Watson, Infowars.com.
[2:19:47.740 --> 2:19:50.740]  It is a big idea.
[2:19:50.740 --> 2:19:52.740]  A new world order.
[2:19:52.740 --> 2:19:57.740]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:19:57.740 --> 2:20:00.740]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[2:20:00.740 --> 2:20:03.740]  Could their objective be world domination?
[2:20:03.740 --> 2:20:06.740]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:20:06.740 --> 2:20:09.740]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:20:09.740 --> 2:20:16.740]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:20:16.740 --> 2:20:21.740]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:20:21.740 --> 2:20:25.740]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:20:25.740 --> 2:20:28.740]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[2:20:28.740 --> 2:20:30.740]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[2:20:30.740 --> 2:20:32.740]  They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[2:20:32.740 --> 2:20:33.740]  That's what happens easily.

[2:20:42.740 --> 2:20:47.740]  In-game, blueprint for global enslavement. You have been warned.
[2:20:47.740 --> 2:20:50.740]  Hi, this is Alex Jones and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[2:20:50.740 --> 2:20:55.740]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[2:20:55.740 --> 2:21:00.740]  I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[2:21:00.740 --> 2:21:04.740]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system,
[2:21:04.740 --> 2:21:09.740]  protect a complete fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition,
[2:21:09.740 --> 2:21:11.740]  improving mileage in only one tank full.
[2:21:11.740 --> 2:21:16.740]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine.
[2:21:16.740 --> 2:21:20.740]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[2:21:20.740 --> 2:21:24.740]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95
[2:21:24.740 --> 2:21:28.740]  and receive a free engine treatment, which is a $12.95 value free.
[2:21:28.740 --> 2:21:34.740]  Call triple-eight, use SFR-1. That number again is triple-eight, use SFR-1
[2:21:34.740 --> 2:21:38.740]  or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.

[2:21:46.740 --> 2:21:48.740]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:21:48.740 --> 2:21:52.740]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide,
[2:21:52.740 --> 2:21:54.740]  but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[2:21:54.740 --> 2:21:57.740]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:21:57.740 --> 2:22:03.740]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:22:03.740 --> 2:22:07.740]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:22:07.740 --> 2:22:12.740]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[2:24:26.740 --> 2:24:28.740]  Alright, we are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[2:24:28.740 --> 2:24:31.740]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in today and tomorrow.
[2:24:31.740 --> 2:24:36.740]  We're talking airport, police state, America, and really around the world,
[2:24:36.740 --> 2:24:39.740]  and we're talking about the liquid bomb plot.
[2:24:39.740 --> 2:24:44.740]  And isn't it convenient how, all of a sudden, the liquids aren't really a threat anymore,
[2:24:44.740 --> 2:24:46.740]  as long as they're in this small plastic bag.
[2:24:46.740 --> 2:24:50.740]  At first, they were like, well, you can't bring water bottles or liquid,
[2:24:50.740 --> 2:24:54.740]  or any kind of an aftershave or cologne on, but now, if you put it into a plastic bag,
[2:24:54.740 --> 2:24:56.740]  magically, it's okay.
[2:24:56.740 --> 2:25:00.740]  I liken it to when it was the Richard Reid shoe bomber plot,
[2:25:00.740 --> 2:25:05.740]  and they banned lighters and matches altogether in the airport.
[2:25:05.740 --> 2:25:07.740]  You couldn't board a plane with it.
[2:25:07.740 --> 2:25:09.740]  Now, they allow you to board a plane,
[2:25:09.740 --> 2:25:13.740]  but the last time I got on the plane with a lighter, they scanned through my bag.
[2:25:13.740 --> 2:25:16.740]  I had three other lighters in there, and they're like, well, you got a choice.
[2:25:16.740 --> 2:25:17.740]  You can keep one.
[2:25:17.740 --> 2:25:19.740]  They're like, oh, which one do you want to keep?
[2:25:19.740 --> 2:25:20.740]  I'm like, I don't care, man.
[2:25:20.740 --> 2:25:23.740]  I'm like, this is taking another 10 minutes because you want to take my lighters away,
[2:25:23.740 --> 2:25:24.740]  but I can have one.
[2:25:24.740 --> 2:25:28.740]  What's the difference between having one and five, Paul?
[2:25:28.740 --> 2:25:36.740]  No difference whatsoever, but it's about maintaining this false sense of insecurity.
[2:25:36.740 --> 2:25:44.740]  If we agree, which most people would, the principle goal of terrorists is to create enough fear
[2:25:44.740 --> 2:25:52.740]  amongst the population to get the people and the government to acquiesce to their political demands.
[2:25:52.740 --> 2:25:57.740]  The only way they can do it is by generating enough fear to make people believe that their life
[2:25:57.740 --> 2:26:03.740]  is significantly threatened by potential terrorism if they don't follow all these ridiculous
[2:26:03.740 --> 2:26:08.740]  rules, like getting rid of their lighters and carrying their liquids through airports
[2:26:08.740 --> 2:26:12.740]  in transparent plastic bags.
[2:26:12.740 --> 2:26:19.740]  As I wrote in the article, if governments are really trying to win a war on terror, as
[2:26:19.740 --> 2:26:26.740]  they're constantly reminding us, then what they would do is sideline and downplay the
[2:26:26.740 --> 2:26:32.740]  ability of terrorists to carry out terrorism because, as the figures show, you've got more
[2:26:32.740 --> 2:26:37.740]  chance of drowning in your own swimming pool than being killed by terrorists.
[2:26:37.740 --> 2:26:44.740]  The question is, why is the government inflating the influence of terrorists by fear-mongering
[2:26:44.740 --> 2:26:48.740]  about a danger that's miniscule?
[2:26:48.740 --> 2:26:52.740]  It seems like the terrorists, quote-unquote, hating our freedoms, and that's why they did
[2:26:52.740 --> 2:26:53.740]  it.
[2:26:53.740 --> 2:26:57.740]  Well, if the terrorists hate our freedoms so much, no one has done a better job from taking
[2:26:57.740 --> 2:27:03.740]  those freedoms away from us than this administration and departments like that of Homeland Security,
[2:27:03.740 --> 2:27:08.740]  you know, legislation like Patriots 1 and 2, especially the Military Commissions Act,
[2:27:08.740 --> 2:27:12.740]  which ended habeas corpus, the right to face your accuser.
[2:27:12.740 --> 2:27:17.740]  Again, around since 1215, and the Magna Carta folks, and that's gone, they can literally
[2:27:17.740 --> 2:27:22.740]  charge you with something, scoop you up, throw you in a black hole, maybe take you to Gitmo
[2:27:22.740 --> 2:27:24.740]  for some waterboarding and such, and that's it.
[2:27:24.740 --> 2:27:27.740]  They don't have to tell anybody about you, they don't have to report to you, they don't
[2:27:27.740 --> 2:27:32.740]  even have to give you a military tribunal at this point, and that's the kind of legislation
[2:27:32.740 --> 2:27:38.740]  that has been passed, not through, you know, Muslim extremists, but by this administration
[2:27:38.740 --> 2:27:41.740]  and this country, and it's very scary to me, Paul.
[2:27:41.740 --> 2:27:43.740]  Let's take some phone calls.
[2:27:43.740 --> 2:27:45.740]  Let's go to Ron in Arkansas.
[2:27:45.740 --> 2:27:48.740]  Ron, are you there?
[2:27:48.740 --> 2:27:49.740]  No, did Ron drop?
[2:27:49.740 --> 2:27:50.740]  All right.
[2:27:50.740 --> 2:27:53.740]  All right, let's try.
[2:27:53.740 --> 2:27:54.740]  Let's go to Sean in New York.
[2:27:54.740 --> 2:27:56.740]  Sean, are you there?
[2:27:56.740 --> 2:27:58.740]  Hey, how's it going?
[2:27:58.740 --> 2:27:59.740]  Good, man.
[2:27:59.740 --> 2:28:00.740]  How you doing?
[2:28:00.740 --> 2:28:01.740]  All right, all right.
[2:28:01.740 --> 2:28:02.740]  Good job on those chains.
[2:28:02.740 --> 2:28:04.740]  I mean, we'll get a lot of people up for me.
[2:28:04.740 --> 2:28:05.740]  I'll tell you.
[2:28:05.740 --> 2:28:07.740]  Well, thank you, man.
[2:28:07.740 --> 2:28:10.740]  Well, I'd like to spell a couple of myths.
[2:28:10.740 --> 2:28:18.740]  I mean, I hear a lot of talk about, well, there are some good police, et cetera, et cetera.
[2:28:18.740 --> 2:28:23.740]  If they're a good police, how could they stand by and watch what's happening?
[2:28:23.740 --> 2:28:28.740]  If they were good, they would do something about it instead of going along with it.
[2:28:28.740 --> 2:28:34.740]  For them to go along with it and sometimes participate in it, it makes them just as bad.
[2:28:34.740 --> 2:28:39.740]  No, I agree with you there, but I think it's kind of like that hive mind mentality that
[2:28:39.740 --> 2:28:44.740]  even though I didn't start it, that's my friend doing it and I have to, you know, defend them.
[2:28:44.740 --> 2:28:45.740]  What do you think, Paul?
[2:28:45.740 --> 2:28:47.740]  Yeah, it's like a gang mentality.
[2:28:47.740 --> 2:28:54.740]  I mean, if you saw that video yesterday, in LA, there was a shooting of a police officer
[2:28:54.740 --> 2:29:00.740]  or something and they got someone at a traffic stop, which they believed might have been linked
[2:29:00.740 --> 2:29:02.740]  to it, I think was the case.
[2:29:02.740 --> 2:29:08.740]  And all the police just dash out like madmen and run up to these guys and kick the living
[2:29:08.740 --> 2:29:10.740]  bleep out of them.
[2:29:10.740 --> 2:29:11.740]  Yeah, that's the Philadelphia one.
[2:29:11.740 --> 2:29:13.740]  Yeah, it does look like a gang beating.
[2:29:13.740 --> 2:29:15.740]  Yeah, well, we'll come back to you on the other side, Sean.
[2:29:15.740 --> 2:29:17.740]  Yeah, it did look like a gang beating.
[2:29:17.740 --> 2:29:21.740]  I mean, literally got the baton out, the dogs were out, there were soccer kicks going on,
[2:29:21.740 --> 2:29:25.740]  three people versus a dozen, a dozen and a half, maybe two dozen cops.
[2:29:25.740 --> 2:29:48.740]  We'll be back after this, taking your phone calls with Paul Joseph Watson.
