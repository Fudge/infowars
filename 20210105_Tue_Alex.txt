[00:00.000 --> 00:14.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is January 5th, 2021, I'm Alex Jones, and I am sitting right above
[00:14.280 --> 00:19.960]  Freedom Square here in Washington, D.C. This is an epic historical moment.
[00:19.960 --> 00:24.000]  We'll be live here for the next four hours with continuing coverage after that with the
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.040]  War Room and more, and all the speeches tonight and tomorrow, but first, a key report.
[00:29.040 --> 00:33.360]  A lot of people are wondering what your inauguration is going to look like considering...
[00:33.360 --> 00:35.120]  So am I.
[00:35.120 --> 00:41.160]  But suddenly, he's canceled the inauguration, they're tearing down the stage, they're tearing
[00:41.160 --> 00:46.800]  down the review stands, big things are afoot, he's not getting his briefings, and suddenly
[00:46.800 --> 00:50.880]  there's all these senators, all these House members about to challenge the fraudulent five
[00:50.880 --> 00:55.600]  states that violated the law on the face of it and didn't have the legislature pass a
[00:55.600 --> 00:58.360]  law to accept the fraudulent ballots.
[00:58.360 --> 01:03.360]  We went into this election with the country deeply divided, deeply polarized, and we've
[01:03.360 --> 01:09.600]  seen in the last two months unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, and that's produced
[01:09.600 --> 01:14.480]  a deep, deep distrust of our democratic process across the country.
[01:14.480 --> 01:20.480]  And so this past week, I spent writing out a position and assembling a group that ultimately
[01:20.480 --> 01:27.120]  of 11 senators that we put out yesterday that we will together object to certification
[01:27.120 --> 01:34.440]  in order to force the appointment of an emergency electoral commission to perform an emergency
[01:34.440 --> 01:38.880]  audit of the election results to assess these claims of frauds.
[01:38.880 --> 01:44.680]  I think we can do that, we can do it promptly, we can do it in 10 days before the inauguration,
[01:44.680 --> 01:49.400]  but I think we have an obligation to the voters and we have an obligation to the constitution
[01:49.400 --> 01:51.760]  to ensure that this election was lawful.
[01:51.760 --> 01:57.080]  It is an open attack on black voters in Georgia and it's a disgrace and it's an echo
[01:57.080 --> 02:00.120]  of the legacy of Jim Crow.
[02:00.120 --> 02:04.640]  But let's also think about the future that we have the possibility of delivering for
[02:04.640 --> 02:06.920]  this country when we win.
[02:06.920 --> 02:13.360]  We've just had four years of scandal, outrage, hatred, racism, fear-mongering, deep division.
[02:13.360 --> 02:15.960]  We've just had a year about rages and competence.
[02:15.960 --> 02:19.720]  This is the last opportunity we will have to protect everything that we've accomplished
[02:19.720 --> 02:21.640]  in the last four years.
[02:21.640 --> 02:26.440]  The second thing is the last line of defense to stop the Democrats from perpetrating this
[02:26.440 --> 02:28.000]  radical socialist agenda.
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.000]  It's as simple as that.
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.280]  CNN's report that two Republican congressmen believe at least 140 of their colleagues will
[02:34.280 --> 02:39.680]  rise next Wednesday against certifying Joe Biden's landslide in the electoral college
[02:39.680 --> 02:42.160]  is ominous news for this nation.
[02:42.160 --> 02:46.880]  Make no mistake about these 140 Republican representatives, they are scum.
[02:46.880 --> 02:52.920]  The chair now hands to the tellers the certificate of the electors for president and vice president
[02:52.920 --> 02:53.920]  of the state of Florida.
[02:53.920 --> 02:59.200]  Mr. President, the objection is in writing, signed by a number of members of the House
[02:59.200 --> 03:02.840]  of Representatives, but not by a member of the Senate.
[03:02.840 --> 03:07.320]  Mr. President, I stand for the purpose of objecting to the counting of the vote from
[03:07.320 --> 03:09.280]  the state of Florida as read.
[03:09.280 --> 03:17.400]  Mr. President, I rise on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus to object to the 25 electoral
[03:17.400 --> 03:18.640]  votes from Florida.
[03:18.640 --> 03:21.080]  Mr. President, thank you for your inquiry.
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.720]  It is in writing, it is signed by myself on behalf of my diverse constituents and the
[03:25.720 --> 03:31.200]  millions of Americans who have been disenfranchised by Florida's inaccurate vote count.
[03:31.200 --> 03:33.240]  Is the objection signed by a senator?
[03:33.240 --> 03:38.760]  Mr. President, I am objecting to the idea that votes in Florida were not counted.
[03:38.760 --> 03:43.320]  The reaction to your tweet, the reaction to your choice to object to the certification
[03:43.320 --> 03:45.680]  of Joe Biden has been strong.
[03:45.680 --> 03:51.040]  Here is one of your colleagues, Senator Chris Murphy, who said you were attempting to overthrow
[03:51.040 --> 03:52.800]  democracy.
[03:52.800 --> 03:57.080]  He tweeted this the following, let's be clear, those contesting the electoral college are
[03:57.080 --> 03:58.520]  trying to overthrow democracy.
[03:58.520 --> 04:03.800]  They want to turn America into a state akin to Russia or China, where elections are for
[04:03.800 --> 04:05.400]  show and one party rules.
[04:05.400 --> 04:09.960]  They want to seek this time, but they will wound democracy very severely.
[04:09.960 --> 04:11.600]  What is your reaction to that, Senator?
[04:11.600 --> 04:15.600]  Well, first of all, I don't recall hearing the Democrats make any such outrageous claims
[04:15.600 --> 04:19.760]  when they were the ones who were objecting during the electoral college certification
[04:19.760 --> 04:22.520]  in 2004 and 2016.
[04:22.520 --> 04:26.640]  Democrats have done this for years in order to raise concerns about election integrity.
[04:26.640 --> 04:31.880]  Now when Republicans, 74 million Americans, have concerns about election integrity, we're
[04:31.880 --> 04:33.720]  supposed to just sit down and shut up.
[04:33.720 --> 04:39.320]  And this truly is the week that will change the world that's coming up on the 6th.
[04:39.320 --> 04:43.680]  On its face, the law was violated, the Constitution was violated, and you ask why the Supreme
[04:43.680 --> 04:47.800]  Court has stabbed Trump in the back because they're part of the neocon rhino warmongering
[04:47.800 --> 04:58.760]  group that works for the Democrats.
[04:58.760 --> 05:03.560]  The populist movement that elected President Trump four years ago re-elected him by an
[05:03.560 --> 05:09.120]  even bigger landslide, rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the globalist.
[05:09.120 --> 05:11.320]  That's why they had to overturn the chessboard.
[05:11.320 --> 05:14.760]  That's why they had to engage in naked election fraud in front of everyone.
[05:14.760 --> 05:19.080]  And as long as we never accept the frauds and results, as long as we don't let them
[05:19.080 --> 05:23.440]  gaslight us into submission, as long as we point out the so far and loveless takeover
[05:23.440 --> 05:27.800]  of our country and that all the depression and all of the collapse that's coming is
[05:27.800 --> 05:32.640]  because of the new world order, this will end up fully destroying them in the future
[05:32.640 --> 05:33.640]  if we don't submit.
[05:33.640 --> 05:38.320]  If we submit, they'll normalize the communism, they'll normalize putting us into a depression,
[05:38.320 --> 05:42.920]  they'll normalize breaking up our families, taking our guns, we can't let that happen.
[05:42.920 --> 05:45.440]  And InfoWars is more important than ever.
[05:45.440 --> 05:50.040]  So please, Paul Revere, I salute you for your past actions, keep spreading Band-Aid video
[05:50.040 --> 05:55.200]  at infowars.com and come to the big DC marches on the 5th and 6th of January.
[05:55.200 --> 05:56.200]  I'll see you there.
[05:56.200 --> 05:57.200]  God bless.
[05:57.200 --> 06:16.880]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report, it's Alex Jones.
[06:16.880 --> 06:28.560]  Words cannot describe the incredible moment we are in history as powerful forces collide,
[06:28.560 --> 06:38.040]  the forces of anti-human, purely satanic world government and its economic constellation
[06:38.040 --> 06:46.040]  of Fortune 100 companies, communist China, EU, orthodox Islam and the satanic pedophile
[06:46.040 --> 06:48.840]  Hollywood trash.
[06:48.840 --> 06:55.040]  All waging systematic culture war to undermine and sabotage our republic and to bankrupt
[06:55.040 --> 07:00.000]  what's left of our laissez-faire free market capitalist system that has now been caught
[07:00.000 --> 07:06.280]  in the jaws of this crony capitalist fascist system on the top using communism and socialism
[07:06.280 --> 07:10.960]  as the domesticating force on the bottom.
[07:10.960 --> 07:17.640]  The pencer attack or the pressure from above and pressure from below vice-crim.
[07:17.640 --> 07:31.720]  I am here in DC, it is already Tuesday, the 5th of January 2021, tonight at Freedom Plaza
[07:31.720 --> 07:37.160]  taking off at 1 p.m. you will see a lot of amazing and important speeches from so many
[07:37.160 --> 07:43.000]  great Americans like General Flynn and of course yours truly is going to be there, Roger
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.200]  Stone and so many others but what really matters is the hundreds of thousands of people already
[07:48.200 --> 07:54.920]  pouring in to the DC streets and what's unfolding there and the millions that are estimated
[07:54.920 --> 08:00.120]  to be pouring in right now according to Secret Service sources, no flights left into DC from
[08:00.120 --> 08:06.360]  anywhere in the country, no flights, not even a seat, very hard to find.
[08:06.360 --> 08:11.160]  Hotels are all completely booked up, the globalists put out a Psyop through the mayor that she'll
[08:11.160 --> 08:15.040]  have the National Guard out for us and that there'll be no port-a-potties and that we're
[08:15.040 --> 08:17.400]  not welcome, that we're violent.
[08:17.400 --> 08:22.600]  They did trick some hotels into closing, not many, they did trick a lot of restaurants
[08:22.600 --> 08:24.440]  into completely closing.
[08:24.440 --> 08:28.880]  I was just trying to order lunch for about 30 minutes going on the line all more than
[08:28.880 --> 08:34.920]  10 places until we found one that was even open so you've got this city that sucks in
[08:34.920 --> 08:39.320]  all the money of the American people to reach a city in the United States but it's got
[08:39.320 --> 08:43.560]  one of the poorest populations at the same time and it doesn't want to give soaker or
[08:43.560 --> 08:48.880]  aid and comfort to its own people when we come here to exercise our First Amendment
[08:48.880 --> 08:55.640]  and the girlfriend of Donna Brazil sits over this undemocratic city, this giant bloated
[08:55.640 --> 09:01.280]  parasite that is hanging on to the neck of the American people and when we dare come
[09:01.280 --> 09:07.840]  to the parasite's nest, of course, it then withdraws all of the opulence that it always
[09:07.840 --> 09:16.520]  provides for itself clearly to stay a classic manifestation of this archetypal parasite.
[09:16.520 --> 09:22.160]  We are in a national emergency, we are in a global emergency, we are in a UN-directed
[09:22.160 --> 09:28.400]  civilization planetary kill switch that teaches you to lower expectations, teaches you to
[09:28.400 --> 09:32.840]  be poor, teaches you to not have medicine, to not have access to courts, to not have
[09:32.840 --> 09:38.200]  access to justice, to not have access to travel, to not have access to good decent food, they're
[09:38.200 --> 09:40.880]  training you to not have electricity on a routine basis.
[09:40.880 --> 09:45.440]  This has all been done before, they're all training you to not have clean water anymore,
[09:45.440 --> 09:52.080]  they're all training you to take all of your money in taxes, laundered into global corporations
[09:52.080 --> 09:57.280]  and then give you nothing but bills back, but now they've gotten the point of extracting
[09:57.280 --> 10:02.720]  all the wealth so the governments aren't even needed anymore, those are to be imploded.
[10:02.720 --> 10:07.320]  Then political police that serve the globalist are only there to serve the establishment,
[10:07.320 --> 10:11.800]  not the people, this is the road to hell we are on.
[10:11.800 --> 10:19.840]  Where logic is a menace and truth is an enemy, to quote Rod Sterling, where paradoxes are
[10:19.840 --> 10:24.320]  all around us, where Black Lives Matter marches, kills cops, burns down buildings with antifa,
[10:24.320 --> 10:27.000]  they're heroes, they're good, they don't spread COVID.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.760]  We come here, we're super spreaders, we're the devil, we should be arrested.
[10:31.760 --> 10:36.240]  With all the huge news I have and all the huge information I'm going to lay out next
[10:36.240 --> 10:42.360]  segment, I want to just stop and I want to put up the statistics from the CDC and I didn't
[10:42.360 --> 10:52.280]  just show you a Twitter feed claiming CDC numbers show this, death numbers, we went
[10:52.280 --> 10:58.400]  on air yesterday to the CDC website and showed you those exact numbers on the subpages that
[10:58.400 --> 11:06.880]  have been pulled out and added to that data sheet that's now on screen, 61,000 more deaths
[11:06.880 --> 11:13.000]  in the year 2020 than there were in the year before and if you look at previous years,
[11:13.000 --> 11:18.440]  the deaths usually are going up more than that because population is going up and we
[11:18.440 --> 11:23.280]  have an aging population, one of the oldest populations with the fifth oldest population
[11:23.280 --> 11:25.040]  out of 169 countries.
[11:25.040 --> 11:29.840]  We have one of the oldest populations in the world and so the baby boomers are starting
[11:29.840 --> 11:34.880]  to die and it's going to accelerate for the next 30 years.
[11:34.880 --> 11:40.600]  We have suicides in the roughly double, drug overdoses skyrocketed, we have a top statistician
[11:40.600 --> 11:45.080]  right now, the report will be off Friday, pulling those numbers out and it looks like
[11:45.080 --> 11:52.480]  massive decreases actually in 2020 in things like automobile accidents and things because
[11:52.480 --> 11:56.480]  people aren't out on the highways that are super dangerous.
[11:56.480 --> 12:02.840]  Another big fraud you hear is we lost 3,000 people on 9-11, we're losing 3,000 a day
[12:02.840 --> 12:06.400]  from COVID, they're counting all the flu, they're counting all the pneumonia, they're
[12:06.400 --> 12:11.840]  counting all the old people on average that are 84.7 years old in the United States, the
[12:11.840 --> 12:16.560]  average age in Italy was 87, that's when you go out of the world folks, average life expectancy
[12:16.560 --> 12:23.320]  is 74 for a man, 76 for a woman, the average age of somebody dying is 84 years old who's
[12:23.320 --> 12:28.680]  had multiple heart attacks, liver failure, kidney failure, cancer and then they go oh
[12:28.680 --> 12:34.920]  we tested you, you got COVID because the PCR test is just the detritus of broken down cells
[12:34.920 --> 12:40.960]  picks up as virus, well an old person who's dead is going to test positive for COVID,
[12:40.960 --> 12:44.480]  that's why they're saying oh the COVID vaccine doesn't protect you, oh it won't protect
[12:44.480 --> 12:48.920]  you, oh it won't stop you getting it because it's BS, they picked a cold virus because
[12:48.920 --> 12:53.760]  it's impossible to ever eradicate, oh but you're going to take 5 shots a year, but it's
[12:53.760 --> 12:56.720]  not going to help you and you're going to have a travel ID and you're going to be constantly
[12:56.720 --> 13:02.320]  tested by PCR tests that the EU courts, the German courts, the French courts, the US courts,
[13:02.320 --> 13:11.640]  the Brazilian courts, the Portuguese courts have all found are fake, lie detectors can
[13:11.640 --> 13:14.640]  be beaten, they actually work with people that don't know how to beat them but they're
[13:14.640 --> 13:18.680]  not admissible in court anymore because they were proven to be a fraud, if I sit here and
[13:18.680 --> 13:23.080]  tell you that I believe in one eyed one horned flying purple people leaders and I really
[13:23.080 --> 13:27.040]  believe that, when they got a lie detector hooked up to me it will say I told the truth
[13:27.040 --> 13:31.000]  that I saw one eyed one horned flying purple people leader because some people know how
[13:31.000 --> 13:37.800]  to beat those, playing a mind trick on themselves, very low percentage, it's unadmissible when
[13:37.800 --> 13:42.520]  maybe 1% of people can beat a lie detector, ladies and gentlemen the New York Times admits
[13:42.520 --> 13:47.800]  in fine print 96% of PCR tests are fake but everyone gets into the nitty, I know someone
[13:47.800 --> 13:56.640]  that died, I know someone, I'm like how well they were 84 or 86 and had cancer and then
[13:56.640 --> 14:02.760]  we learned they gave Rendezavir that absolutely causes blood clots and all these problems
[14:02.760 --> 14:06.600]  to the new congressman that got elected and then he had a damn heart attack and died
[14:06.600 --> 14:13.840]  from it, oh you got COVID, here take Rendezavir, oh in studies Rendezavir had a 7% chance of
[14:13.840 --> 14:19.320]  helping you with COVID, when Hydroxychloroquine had a 97% conservatively, oh but it does give
[14:19.320 --> 14:26.280]  you blood clots, oh bye bye you're dead now, complications from COVID, they start having
[14:26.280 --> 14:32.840]  a heart attack, start innovating people and oh it's COVID so remember, remember, remember,
[14:32.840 --> 14:38.600]  remember that it's all public and the video's up at band.video, we're having an article out
[14:38.600 --> 14:46.560]  on the report out on Friday and it's all right there for you that 61,000 more people
[14:46.560 --> 14:53.720]  died in 2020 than died in 2019 and I know you know that but you need to get that out
[14:53.720 --> 15:01.520]  to everybody, in fact we'll post the flyer for now as an article to infowars.com, I want
[15:01.520 --> 15:08.560]  to post yesterday's piece where CDC numbers prove COVID-19 is a giant hoax, same amount
[15:08.560 --> 15:13.840]  of deaths roughly in 2020 as in 2019, that's the sub headline and then we need to post
[15:13.840 --> 15:19.840]  that with that document there and then a link to the CDC so you can go do it yourself, do
[15:19.840 --> 15:25.040]  not believe me, go to the CDC, a lot of statistics are bad, they're twisted you know but when
[15:25.040 --> 15:28.800]  it comes to death statistics and crime statistics, that's one thing Jagger Hoover did a great
[15:28.800 --> 15:36.600]  job of is he got that working really good, it's the model, the FBI system on deaths and
[15:36.600 --> 15:44.040]  on crimes and on those statistics are the best in the world ladies and gentlemen and
[15:44.040 --> 15:48.760]  so we know the very close the number of deaths in this country, we know the number of homicides
[15:48.760 --> 15:53.840]  all that stuff to a very, very, very, very close level, okay so it's all fraud, it's
[15:53.840 --> 15:58.240]  over, it's a lie but we have to carry the ball, we have to get the truth out, our activated
[15:58.240 --> 16:03.280]  charcoal toothpaste became a best seller overnight because activated charcoal is already
[16:03.280 --> 16:07.640]  one of the top selling fastest growing toothpaste out there, the problem is a lot of the other
[16:07.640 --> 16:12.320]  over the counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring, very, very toxic and also they
[16:12.320 --> 16:16.320]  have fluoride in it, this does not have the fluoride, it doesn't have the additives, this
[16:16.320 --> 16:20.760]  is a concentrated, really is high quality, it's been sold out for months because of supply

[17:00.600 --> 17:06.000]  tried Turboforce you need to try it, I've tried Turboforce with everything, sometimes
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.400]  you know I went a little bit crazy, I put Turboforce in my coffee, that was a crazy
[17:09.400 --> 17:13.360]  week, I don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go Turboforce is my favorite
[17:13.360 --> 17:16.760]  and all the InfoWars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control
[17:16.760 --> 17:24.240]  of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you, nobody wakes up in the morning
[17:24.240 --> 17:27.080]  and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life, I'm going to wake up
[17:27.080 --> 17:31.640]  today, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier
[17:31.640 --> 17:34.800]  and richer, I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend, I don't think
[17:34.800 --> 17:37.960]  that happens very often, it's never happened to me, I've never had anyone knock on my door
[17:37.960 --> 17:41.560]  and say Tate you're such a good guy, how can I improve your life in every single way, there's
[17:41.560 --> 17:45.120]  only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me, I woke up and thought you
[17:45.120 --> 17:48.320]  know what, okay I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health
[17:48.320 --> 17:50.960]  and that's why you need to go to InfoWars.com, take control of your health right now and
[17:50.960 --> 17:54.560]  support the resistance, don't buy into the group think, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink
[17:54.560 --> 18:00.720]  the Turbo Force, Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good.
[18:00.720 --> 18:16.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:16.160 --> 18:26.880]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[18:26.880 --> 18:32.760]  I have an overwhelming feeling, I wouldn't call it butterflies, I wouldn't call it anxiety,
[18:32.760 --> 18:40.440]  I would call it energy, being on the edge of something super important, incredibly historic
[18:40.440 --> 18:48.640]  and amazingly dangerous, the United States of America and everything it stands for is
[18:48.640 --> 18:51.360]  under attack and is being destroyed.
[18:51.360 --> 18:58.240]  We are in the middle of a 21st century war and the future of our children and their children
[18:58.240 --> 19:02.680]  and their children and their children and their children and their children's children
[19:02.680 --> 19:13.120]  on and on into infinity is counting down now, the solace, communist Chinese on record have
[19:13.120 --> 19:19.480]  every type of human animal clone you can imagine brought to term, huge giant lab run underground
[19:19.480 --> 19:27.320]  facilities all over their country in partnership with the CIA and the most horrible transhumanist
[19:27.320 --> 19:30.000]  the planet has ever seen.
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.480]  Cetaphilia is just the tip of the iceberg with these people.
[19:34.480 --> 19:40.680]  There is no bottom, they don't believe in good, they don't even believe in evil, they
[19:40.680 --> 19:44.440]  believe in raw control.
[19:44.440 --> 19:52.280]  Think about how just yesterday on Sunday actually two days ago we played that clip of NCI director
[19:52.280 --> 19:59.880]  Brennan five years ago on C-SPAN saying we are able to control the weather but as we
[19:59.880 --> 20:03.240]  announced this other countries are going to get mad and they are going to start controlling
[20:03.240 --> 20:08.840]  the weather so we need a UN treaty to be enforced that is already in place.
[20:08.840 --> 20:12.760]  So 30 minute speech we played a minute of it, you might want to go watch the whole thing.
[20:12.760 --> 20:19.920]  Now imagine they are adding it to all the major jet fuel, it is nuclei, baryum salzum
[20:19.920 --> 20:26.760]  dioxide to form particles, water vapor, they are geoengineering the planet and now Bill
[20:26.760 --> 20:28.440]  Gates is in charge of it.
[20:28.440 --> 20:32.240]  Again, we are not in Kansas anymore.
[20:32.240 --> 20:37.200]  If you think geoengineering is the bottom of the barrel, no, no, no, it is the surface,
[20:37.200 --> 20:39.960]  they are doing everything.
[20:39.960 --> 20:45.880]  They want life extension, they want the secrets of the universe, with their cyclotrons, with
[20:45.880 --> 20:50.480]  all of it, they are 50 years advanced of what you are being told.
[20:50.480 --> 20:56.280]  Folks, they are not going to announce in a year and a half that aliens are here.
[20:56.280 --> 21:04.600]  They are creating aliens, you understand, they are creating aliens.
[21:04.600 --> 21:12.520]  Let that sink in, when you take a human and you take a plant or when you take a salmon
[21:12.520 --> 21:21.160]  and you put grasshopper gene in it or asparagus genes in it, you are producing an alien and
[21:21.160 --> 21:27.360]  now they have artificial synthetic DNA sequences.
[21:27.360 --> 21:33.000]  So they are able to go in and create completely new stuff not based on any life forms on this
[21:33.000 --> 21:40.940]  planet and they can go in and program ourselves to do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[21:40.940 --> 21:46.480]  So we can talk about Trump all day and we can talk about trying to get him in there,
[21:46.480 --> 21:50.520]  but the truth is he is a populist, he cares about the country, he is a service economy
[21:50.520 --> 21:56.520]  guy, he wants to see people doing well, he doesn't want a global depression, he doesn't
[21:56.520 --> 22:00.760]  want to make you poor to control you, he is old school Americana wants to have a rising
[22:00.760 --> 22:07.680]  tide raise all ships, but Trump doesn't know about genetic gene splicing, Trump doesn't
[22:07.680 --> 22:14.160]  know what is going on with the mRNA, we have to inform everyone, we have to educate the
[22:14.160 --> 22:18.600]  population, they go, oh, well the mRNA doesn't really change the actual mitochondria, it
[22:18.600 --> 22:25.840]  just programs the ribosomes to do it, that's like saying Alex Jones didn't really blow
[22:25.840 --> 22:30.960]  somebody's head off, he just pulled the trigger and fired the bullet when the pen hit the
[22:30.960 --> 22:38.200]  cap that fired it out, it's just ridiculous ladies and gentlemen, it programs the ribosome
[22:38.200 --> 22:46.560]  to program the nuclei and that's just the tip of the iceberg ladies and gentlemen, again
[22:46.560 --> 22:51.840]  if somebody beat your brains out with a club, you'd say, well technically the guy that beat
[22:51.840 --> 22:55.720]  the person's brains out with an axe handle didn't technically do it himself, he used
[22:55.720 --> 23:02.320]  a club to do it, so again these are the games they play and they're experimenting on all
[23:02.320 --> 23:10.920]  of us in real time, in the 1960s they already had CD-ROMs and computers you saw in the 90s,
[23:10.920 --> 23:18.760]  you understand, they designed the internet in 1962 theoretically, it had already been
[23:18.760 --> 23:24.080]  set up in 1958, they changed the name of the intergalactic communication system that is
[23:24.080 --> 23:31.440]  meant to track lifetime stimuli of every human on earth, so they can add manipulative systems
[23:31.440 --> 23:36.960]  to stimulate us to do what they want, it's not just something that predicts the future,
[23:36.960 --> 23:42.640]  it controls the future, if you can predict the future, you can control the future, this
[23:42.640 --> 23:49.680]  is God like power in the hands of these people and when you won't admit it to yourself and
[23:49.680 --> 23:54.320]  when you won't face it and when you won't research it and when you won't contend with
[23:54.320 --> 23:59.600]  these people even at the level of understanding what they're doing, they believe that you
[23:59.600 --> 24:10.640]  are not human and they can kill you, but according to the galactic universal law, God's law,
[24:10.640 --> 24:15.400]  they've got to convince you to do it, they've got to bully you but they've got to get you
[24:15.400 --> 24:20.840]  to acquiesce to laziness or ignorance but they've got to leave an escape valve for you
[24:20.840 --> 24:25.400]  or they karmically, they believe and you report yourself, however you see it, the Buddhist
[24:25.400 --> 24:30.880]  way or the Christian way, this is what they think, karmically they escape judgment on
[24:30.880 --> 24:35.160]  this dimension by giving you an out, they do not escape it at the next dimension and
[24:35.160 --> 24:39.720]  they know that, that's why they want to play God and don't want to die, they don't go
[24:39.720 --> 24:44.160]  up, they go down doing this kind of stuff, that's why reincarnation is not real folks
[24:44.160 --> 24:48.640]  but we all know that we've been around before because we are a composite of everyone that
[24:48.640 --> 24:54.440]  came before us with a new spirit that God puts in to that machine that is a composite
[24:54.440 --> 24:59.720]  of the memories of the other souls that were on this plane that then composite into the
[24:59.720 --> 25:05.720]  body earth suit, so it's a communal interfacing with everyone before us and our children going
[25:05.720 --> 25:10.960]  forward is a communal transmission forward which is the ultimate form of time travel,
[25:10.960 --> 25:18.880]  we are time travel, we are laser light, we are transcendent, we are luminous, we are unstoppable,
[25:18.880 --> 25:27.720]  we are absolutely interfacing with God but Schumer and the Clintons and the Rothschilds
[25:27.720 --> 25:32.000]  and the Rockefellers are cut off from God, they have decided to break the rules, to have
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.400]  temporal control of this planet this time and everything they do just as Satan did originally
[25:38.400 --> 25:43.600]  is a repeat of trying to be God but they don't know how to be God because they're not God
[25:43.600 --> 25:49.120]  so instead they wreck and disease and twist and everything they're able to build is simply
[25:49.120 --> 25:54.440]  a mutation of what God had already set up and so it always fails, it always falls, it
[25:54.440 --> 26:02.440]  doesn't work, two steps, three steps, four steps, five steps, ten steps out, it fails
[26:02.440 --> 26:09.800]  because it is a mutation, it is a spiritual cancer, it is a failure, it is nonsense, it
[26:09.800 --> 26:15.720]  is a lie and that's why they teach us nonsense, mother and father can no longer be in bills
[26:15.720 --> 26:20.400]  or boy or girl, man or woman, it's hurtful or niece or nephew and then you go to Nancy
[26:20.400 --> 26:26.520]  Pelosi's own Twitter and she says proud grandmother and mother and you're like why are they all
[26:26.520 --> 26:30.280]  efficient, why do they get their hair done, why don't they wear masks, why don't they,
[26:30.280 --> 26:36.320]  that doesn't make sense, that's not logical because they're not logical, Satanism isn't
[26:36.320 --> 26:40.960]  about self, it's not about you doing what you want, that's one level, that's baby level,
[26:40.960 --> 26:47.960]  it's about inversion, it's about paradox, it's about fraud, it's about stomping on your
[26:47.960 --> 26:53.120]  soul forever, it's about making the wrong choice, so choose wisely, I'll tell you what's
[26:53.120 --> 26:55.240]  happening in D.C. when we return.
[26:55.240 --> 26:59.440]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[26:59.440 --> 27:04.320]  redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income which of course the United
[27:04.320 --> 27:08.120]  Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally
[27:08.120 --> 27:14.320]  a chip under your skin, it's all now completely official, part of the U.N. great reset of the
[27:14.320 --> 27:19.360]  Davos Group and Klaus Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab
[27:19.360 --> 27:24.000]  and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, it's here and
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.920]  only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject
[27:28.920 --> 27:36.080]  it all, and the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle against evil and stopping
[27:36.080 --> 27:41.760]  abortion, we must start valuing human life again, we must start saying that we are not
[27:41.760 --> 27:48.120]  expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential, until we do that we are
[27:48.120 --> 27:55.280]  all slaves, we must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[27:55.280 --> 28:00.080]  The populist movement that elected President Trump four years ago re-elected him by an
[28:00.080 --> 28:05.800]  even bigger landslide, rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the globalist, that's why
[28:05.800 --> 28:10.120]  they had to overturn the chess board, that's why they had to engage in naked election fraud
[28:10.120 --> 28:14.960]  in front of everyone, and as long as we never accept the fraud's earned results, as long
[28:14.960 --> 28:19.600]  as we don't let them gaslight us into submission, as long as we point out this so foreign globalist
[28:19.600 --> 28:24.760]  takeover of our country and that all the depression and all of the collapse that's coming is because
[28:24.760 --> 28:29.560]  of the new world order, this will end up fully destroying them in the future if we don't
[28:29.560 --> 28:30.560]  submit.
[28:30.560 --> 28:34.920]  If we submit, they'll normalize the communism, they'll normalize putting us into a depression,
[28:34.920 --> 28:39.520]  they'll normalize breaking up our families, taking our guns, we can't let that happen,
[28:39.520 --> 28:42.000]  and Info Wars is more important than ever.
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.600]  So please, Paul Revere, I salute you for your past actions, keep spreading Band-Aught Video
[28:46.600 --> 28:51.760]  and InfoWars.com and come to the big DC marches on the 5th and 6th of January.
[28:51.760 --> 28:58.760]  I'll see you there, God bless.
[29:21.760 --> 29:26.520]  We have the best durable food, the lowest price you're going to find, all the other
[29:26.520 --> 29:30.240]  big competitors have already gone up on their prices, but our supplier has high quality
[29:30.240 --> 29:34.440]  food in stock, ready to ship to you, and by January 8th they're going to have to raise
[29:34.440 --> 29:42.480]  prices some, so take advantage now, PrepareWithAlex.com, and on top of that you can save up to $850
[29:42.480 --> 29:47.800]  off their regular rates, go to PrepareWithAlex.com, today you've got until January 8th, and the
[29:47.800 --> 29:51.800]  profit that comes in, that helps fund the Info War, Fighting for America, Fighting for
[29:51.800 --> 29:57.800]  Justice, Fighting for Freedom, a true 360 win.
[29:57.800 --> 30:21.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:21.800 --> 30:28.800]  This is a spiritual battle, this is a genetic spiritual takeover of being attempted, a true
[30:28.800 --> 30:30.480]  genetic raping of the planet.
[30:30.480 --> 30:36.960]  A woman gets raped, it's traumatic, it's terrible, it's a bad thing, and maybe she ends up having
[30:36.960 --> 30:43.560]  a child with the person that raped her, maybe she doesn't, but this is the raping of your
[30:43.560 --> 30:47.440]  very genetic code and of your will.
[30:47.440 --> 30:56.840]  So here's what I want to get into, we're here in D.C., it's January 5th, the year 2021,
[30:56.840 --> 31:03.840]  and tomorrow on the ellipse, I predict there will be over a million people conservatively,
[31:03.840 --> 31:10.680]  I've been for two of these big marches in the last two months here in D.C., and before
[31:10.680 --> 31:15.760]  the first big one that was at least 500,000 people conservatively, there were not a lot
[31:15.760 --> 31:20.160]  of people on the streets until right at about 10, about an hour before it started, and then
[31:20.160 --> 31:22.600]  they just poured out everywhere.
[31:22.600 --> 31:25.960]  Right now there are more people already out there than when stuff got kicked off a few
[31:25.960 --> 31:32.880]  months ago on the November, I guess it was on the 12th or the 14th of March, I mean I
[31:32.880 --> 31:36.920]  can hear the crowd out there right now, there's microphones directional so you can't hear it,
[31:36.920 --> 31:42.240]  but it is loud out there, Owen Schreuer is down there shooting a report right now, he's
[31:42.240 --> 31:53.400]  going to come in and co-host Patrick Burns is going to be in studio here with us coming
[31:53.400 --> 31:59.000]  up at the bottom of the next hour, Harrison Smith is doing a splendid job with the weekday
[31:59.000 --> 32:05.000]  morning show American Journal, he'll be riding shotgun there in the studio, some with us today,
[32:05.000 --> 32:11.400]  we'll get some commentary from him coming up, and then in about an hour I'm going to leave
[32:11.400 --> 32:16.200]  and I'm going to go, no one's going to host, and give a speech to the Supreme Court, then
[32:16.200 --> 32:22.400]  I'm going to come back to Freedom Plaza and give my big speech between 5 and 6.30 tonight
[32:22.400 --> 32:27.360]  in the same block with Roger Stone and others, but again all of that is important, but it
[32:27.360 --> 32:34.480]  is a side show compared to the world government UN directive takeover with COVID-19 that is
[32:34.480 --> 32:39.560]  genetically engineered, that they do own, so they control it and they control the quote
[32:39.560 --> 32:43.200]  cures for it, that they now admit aren't even cures, aren't even treatments, and don't
[32:43.200 --> 32:47.840]  even protect you, we accurately nailed it 11 months ago with our analysis, now the Chai
[32:47.840 --> 32:50.760]  Comm is trying to rewrite history and say it didn't come out of Wuhan, people go well
[32:50.760 --> 32:55.880]  what if it's a bio weapon, why isn't that deadly, it's a scarlet letter, it's a way to
[32:55.880 --> 33:00.480]  convict you, it's a way to make you bad, it's a way to make you dirty, and then they can
[33:00.480 --> 33:04.920]  roll out new COVID franchises in the future, which I predicted 11 months ago, because I
[33:04.920 --> 33:10.760]  don't know the enemy's mind, well now they've got big Hollywood movies coming out, where
[33:10.760 --> 33:16.480]  oh COVID 2022 kills tens of millions and it's martial law and no one ever leaves their houses
[33:16.480 --> 33:23.960]  again and it's the end of civilization, this is an attempted extinction event, it's going
[33:23.960 --> 33:30.360]  to be a songbird, I'm going from memory, but that's what's happening here, and so squash
[33:30.360 --> 33:35.680]  Schwab and all them admit this, you say why do they admit it, because they've got to their
[33:35.680 --> 33:40.920]  own forces, look confident, the average person high level at the UN, the average person in
[33:40.920 --> 33:48.280]  Congress, the average person knows this, I've had conversations with these people, they
[33:48.280 --> 33:53.080]  tried to get me to join them, they know who to spot, who to go after, but I never took
[33:53.080 --> 33:58.280]  the deals that Glenn Beck did, and then even Glenn Beck couldn't go along with it and kind
[33:58.280 --> 34:02.520]  of fudged on his deals, they went after him to his credit, so Glenn's not all bad, he's
[34:02.520 --> 34:06.480]  just like everybody else trying to go along, get along, I don't do that, because I understand
[34:06.480 --> 34:11.040]  the basic ethos of leadership is sticking to your guns when you know you're right and
[34:11.040 --> 34:15.040]  understanding it's not about me at the end of the day, I don't have a wish list to die,
[34:15.040 --> 34:20.080]  I don't have a death wish, but I actually don't care actually, in fact if God chose
[34:20.080 --> 34:24.320]  to make me an exclamation point at the end of a sentence about the globalist and the
[34:24.320 --> 34:28.440]  New World Order and chose to smash me flat in a pancake today, or to riddle me full of
[34:28.440 --> 34:32.560]  bullet holes, if that's what God wants, it happens, if I'm the highlighter that's used
[34:32.560 --> 34:37.240]  to just mark a transmission to make sure people pay attention to it, then I ask God to use
[34:37.240 --> 34:40.600]  me, not because I want to die, but because I'm willing to die, and I'm ready to die,
[34:40.600 --> 34:42.840]  and I'm committed to die, you understand that?
[34:42.840 --> 34:48.000]  It's that freedom in that moment, that you are truly free, and you say I've heard that
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.960]  before, it's a universal truth, whether you see it in Viva Vendetta, whether you see it
[34:51.960 --> 34:57.400]  in real life things that happen, when she's ready to finally die, she says give up your
[34:57.400 --> 35:01.760]  friends or I'm going to kill you out back at the workshop in 10 minutes, she says good,
[35:01.760 --> 35:04.840]  go ahead and pull the trigger, I'm not going to turn my friends in, I'm not going to work
[35:04.840 --> 35:11.680]  for you, blow my head off, and he goes now, Evie, you're free, and you've got to stop
[35:11.680 --> 35:15.920]  caring what they say, you've got to stop caring what they do, you've got to stop letting
[35:15.920 --> 35:20.920]  them be above you, you've got to say there's only one thing above me, and that's God, and
[35:20.920 --> 35:25.560]  I'm connected to that, and that's what I follow, my instincts, my spirit, my common sense that
[35:25.560 --> 35:31.040]  God programmed into me with free will so I can choose it if I decide to follow it, because
[35:31.040 --> 35:35.240]  God wouldn't throw us into this with free will and not give us the real breadcrumbs, not
[35:35.240 --> 35:39.720]  give us the real guide reels, and God says please don't climb over those guide reels,
[35:39.720 --> 35:44.560]  please don't do this, it's dangerous, but we say oh you're going to do it, we're going
[35:44.560 --> 35:48.960]  to splice humans with animals and insects, oh we're going to be God and control the atmosphere,
[35:48.960 --> 35:52.240]  oh we're going to track what everybody does in live time, and tell them you can go outside
[35:52.240 --> 35:59.000]  when you can't and make you wear a mask, it's all a big lie, listen to that USA out there,
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.400]  can you hear this, I almost want to stick the microphone out the window so people can
[36:02.400 --> 36:09.440]  hear me, they got a feed, oh they're showing a feed, wow, that's crazy out there, I love
[36:09.440 --> 36:15.160]  to hear the human roar too, it's like rawr, it's very, a lot of people are scared of that
[36:15.160 --> 36:19.440]  sound, it's very refreshing to me because that's my people, they're black, they're white, they're
[36:19.440 --> 36:22.600]  brown, they're old, they're young, they're male, they're female, they're human, they
[36:22.600 --> 36:31.880]  got red blood baby, I can feel their strength, I can feel their will, I can feel the power
[36:31.880 --> 36:44.160]  of the people of America and the world rising, Satan will fall because Satan already fell,
[36:44.160 --> 36:56.720]  Satan's a loser, when I was a young man and I saw my family proud of the cult of USA and
[36:56.720 --> 37:03.640]  proud of the cult of Texas, I thought these are prideful people and America's not that
[37:03.640 --> 37:09.240]  good and Texas is that good because I inherently thought it was a form of arrogance, it wasn't,
[37:09.240 --> 37:12.880]  it was fought for, people died for it and they'd been around the world and they knew
[37:12.880 --> 37:17.400]  how bad other areas were and they knew that America wasn't perfect but was an idea and
[37:17.400 --> 37:20.960]  a dream but what you dream you can many times do and that people were trying to take it
[37:20.960 --> 37:25.600]  away, they weren't arrogantly celebrating the USA, they weren't arrogantly celebrating
[37:25.600 --> 37:29.640]  Texas, they were celebrating it because they knew it was an island of freedom compared
[37:29.640 --> 37:36.880]  to other places and they valued it, it wasn't pride, it was love but we don't see love
[37:36.880 --> 37:42.840]  for America and love for Texas, we see hatred because it stands against their Satanism and
[37:42.840 --> 37:47.400]  it stands against their weakness and it stands against what they want to do tearing us apart
[37:47.400 --> 37:52.400]  and putting us back together in disgusting shapes of their own choosing, I will not serve
[37:52.400 --> 37:58.800]  under Satan, I will not bow to Satan, I will not be Satan's minion ever, I declare war
[37:58.800 --> 38:05.520]  on Satan, the name of Jesus Christ, Satan is a loser and anyone that follows Satan is
[38:05.520 --> 38:14.040]  a loser, remember that, these pathetic exercises of power from the governor of California looks
[38:14.040 --> 38:18.720]  like a demon lit up like a Christmas tree, he's so satanic, look at Governor Whitmer
[38:18.720 --> 38:22.840]  lit up like a freaking demon man, that's what people look like in ceremonies when they're
[38:22.840 --> 38:28.120]  killing kids all lit up like that look man, that's a demon, you look at Cuomo lit up like
[38:28.120 --> 38:33.040]  a demon, you look at the British Prime Minister lit up like a demon, those people are lit
[38:33.040 --> 38:40.040]  up like demons because they're demons, you see that lit up look that smile on their little
[38:40.040 --> 38:46.000]  face, that ain't human folks, that's a devil, that's a space invader, don't come out of
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.600]  the sky, they come out of the ether and now all the mathematics proves that there are
[38:51.600 --> 38:58.160]  no atheists in Hollywood, there are no agnostics, there are no agnostics at DARPA, there are
[38:58.160 --> 39:03.720]  no genetic engineers that don't believe, they all believe now and they say advanced aliens
[39:03.720 --> 39:10.360]  made us and all this advanced aliens give me a break, the thing that made us made it
[39:10.360 --> 39:21.240]  all, the whole thing, all of it, I'm following that, that made me, not these devil worshipers,
[39:21.240 --> 39:25.400]  God gave me my beautiful wife and my children, God gave me everything that's good, God gave
[39:25.400 --> 39:30.280]  me a system that works, God loves me, God gave me free will so I could look at it and
[39:30.280 --> 39:36.000]  see it was good and accept it and celebrate it, not the Satanist card, I'm going to stop
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.160]  preaching, when we come back I'm going to hit the big events, what we're facing, when
[39:40.160 --> 39:47.560]  actual emergency we're in and so much more today, it is January 5th, 2021, infowars.com,
[39:47.560 --> 39:58.880]  tomorrow's news today.
[39:58.880 --> 40:08.040]  I love you man, I want to make a quick plug, that DNA force, I love it, I've been using
[40:08.040 --> 40:12.440]  it quite a while and I just went, looked at the ingredients again the other day and I
[40:12.440 --> 40:18.920]  see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula
[40:18.920 --> 40:27.040]  has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cell,
[40:27.040 --> 40:33.000]  so people might want to take a look at that, all I know is with DNA force, we went out
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.640]  and looked at these high end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't
[40:37.640 --> 40:41.320]  prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive
[40:41.320 --> 40:45.760]  products that will only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different
[40:45.760 --> 40:55.160]  top brands together and that's what produced this, so thanks, thanks for the plug.
[40:55.160 --> 40:59.880]  Not a secret why in the leftist controlled cities all over the world, not just the US,
[40:59.880 --> 41:03.960]  they encourage people to live in tents, cities as homeless and to use drugs and alcohol and
[41:03.960 --> 41:08.880]  engage in petty crime, it's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda
[41:08.880 --> 41:13.760]  30, of course the great reset, they want to lower expectations, they don't want you to
[41:13.760 --> 41:17.560]  think of having sanitary systems everywhere, they don't want you to think of a civilization
[41:17.560 --> 41:21.960]  that gets better, they want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse,
[41:21.960 --> 41:26.400]  the globalists fly around in private jets, they have huge private mistakes, they are
[41:26.400 --> 41:30.960]  separate from us, their children go to private tutors, they admit this and now they want
[41:30.960 --> 41:36.600]  us locked down, telecommunicating with each other so that we are not actually out physically
[41:36.600 --> 41:42.040]  building a pro-human infrastructure, the infrastructure that is left under 5G has been a controlled
[41:42.040 --> 41:47.040]  robot autonomous cars and trucks, this is all their admitted plan, the public is finally
[41:47.040 --> 41:51.560]  listening because the plan is no longer in beta, it's gone operational, it's a post-human
[41:51.560 --> 41:55.560]  future, you better find out about it right now.
[41:55.560 --> 42:00.360]  The populist movement that elected President Trump four years ago re-elected him by an
[42:00.360 --> 42:06.080]  even bigger landslide, rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the globalist, that's why
[42:06.080 --> 42:10.400]  they had to overturn the chess board, that's why they had to engage in naked election fraud
[42:10.400 --> 42:15.360]  in front of everyone and as long as we never accept the frauds and results, as long as
[42:15.360 --> 42:19.920]  we don't let them gaslight us into submission, as long as we point out this foreign globalist
[42:19.920 --> 42:25.040]  takeover of our country and that all the depression and all of the collapse that's coming is because
[42:25.040 --> 42:30.480]  of the new world order, this will end up fully destroying them in the future if we don't submit,
[42:30.480 --> 42:35.200]  if we submit they'll normalize the communism, they'll normalize putting us into a depression,
[42:35.200 --> 42:39.680]  they'll normalize breaking up our families, taking our guns, we can't let that happen
[42:39.680 --> 42:44.240]  and Info Wars is more important than ever, so please Paul Revere, I salute you for your
[42:44.240 --> 42:49.920]  past actions, keep spreading band.video and infowars.com and come to the big DC marches
[42:49.920 --> 43:19.760]  on the 5th and 6th of January, I'll see you there, God bless.
[43:19.920 --> 43:27.600]  Every month we launch a new URL before they ban it, but Soros and Hill Gates and the globalists
[43:27.600 --> 43:35.840]  are on our tail, but the new website is the resistance.video, the resistance.video, they're
[43:35.840 --> 43:41.600]  trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them, so the new URL that links
[43:41.600 --> 43:46.160]  right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special
[43:46.160 --> 43:51.520]  reports and all the suppressed information is there, the resistance.video, share the link,
[43:51.520 --> 44:21.360]  the resistance.video, the resistance.video, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:22.480 --> 44:26.560]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[44:28.160 --> 44:32.880]  Live from the Info Wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[44:37.520 --> 44:44.320]  All right, depending on the day in the United States, between 9 and 25,000 people die a day
[44:44.320 --> 44:53.680]  and they die of heart attacks, they die in skydiving accidents, they die slipping and
[44:53.680 --> 44:58.240]  falling in their pool, they die getting electrocuted, they die from gunshot wounds,
[44:58.880 --> 45:03.760]  they die being stabbed, they die from internal bleeding, on and on and on.
[45:05.360 --> 45:08.800]  And anybody can check this, what's crazy is math and science is actually there,
[45:08.800 --> 45:13.520]  it's not perfect, but it's pretty damn accurate. You can go to the World Economic Forum website
[45:13.520 --> 45:17.680]  and type in global deaths, this is how COVID-19 compares to other diseases.
[45:19.200 --> 45:24.560]  They've got that map we've shown many times. And COVID-19 is a little bitty spec down here at the
[45:24.560 --> 45:29.520]  bottom. You know, here's cancer and here's heart attacks and here's car wrecks and here's, you
[45:29.520 --> 45:34.160]  know, plane crashes down here and, you know, here's the flu, it's, oh, then there's COVID.
[45:38.080 --> 45:42.560]  And again, I could cover a thousand subjects right now, but the CDCs now has the numbers in
[45:42.560 --> 45:49.840]  for last year, 61,000 more people died. And if you look at population increase, it should have been
[45:49.840 --> 45:55.600]  higher. So it turns out having everybody locked down was there was less car wrecks and stuff like
[45:55.600 --> 46:05.120]  that. So if you take out the drug overdoses, you take out the suicide, way less people died in
[46:05.120 --> 46:10.640]  2020. So I guess locking people down, there is less death from just being out in the world, folks.
[46:10.640 --> 46:14.960]  But I got on an airplane to come here, even though that's dangerous, way more dangerous than COVID.
[46:14.960 --> 46:22.880]  People all over the news go, look how crazy Jones is going back to April. In April, they were trying
[46:22.880 --> 46:28.080]  to do lockdowns. You were talking about him, I was out and then in May and in the summer, they're
[46:28.080 --> 46:32.880]  like, he's insane. He's all got a Twitter leftist like, oh, Jones will be dead in a month from COVID.
[46:32.880 --> 46:39.440]  Thank God. Oh, Trump led to all those rallies. Oh, we can't wait till he gets COVID and dies.
[46:39.440 --> 46:50.960]  And I've not been sick. I had my second five years and I got a chest cold when I was in Grand Cayman
[46:50.960 --> 47:00.000]  in January, but now they're with my children. Lasted about two days. I kept working, had a little bit
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.560]  of a fever. I was like, well, I got mom, I got a hundred degree fever. I got a couple, you know,
[47:04.560 --> 47:10.080]  at least a point of temperature. And like chicken little, I'm supposed to just run in my house and
[47:10.080 --> 47:13.040]  never come out again. Doesn't matter. The whole world starts death. Doesn't matter. Everything
[47:13.040 --> 47:19.920]  breaks down. It's okay because Amazon's got a drone going to deliver me something. It's okay if
[47:19.920 --> 47:24.720]  Apple runs death camps in China because everybody knows Tim Cook wears a little black turtleneck.
[47:24.720 --> 47:27.280]  He's gay. I mean, he's gay. It's all right, right?
[47:27.280 --> 47:35.040]  And that's what the left wraps itself in. That's what the big corporations are so ruthless. They
[47:35.040 --> 47:43.840]  wrap themselves in all this SJWism and it means nothing. Oh, I'm running death camps with millions
[47:43.840 --> 47:50.240]  in them. We're selling their organs, but it's all right because, you know, I gave a hundred
[47:50.240 --> 47:55.120]  million dollars to Black Lives Matter, which is just the Democratic Party. They laundered the money
[47:55.120 --> 48:00.160]  into that. Oh, Tim Cook, they have a hundred million dollars. Oh, from, I mean, that's like
[48:00.160 --> 48:07.760]  giving them a penny. Oh, here's a penny of our trillion dollar company. But that's who they are,
[48:07.760 --> 48:13.840]  folks. Oh, I get out of jail. I got death camps. I'm spying on you. I like Black people. I'm a
[48:13.840 --> 48:21.360]  weird old white gay person, but it's okay. And again, and then he says in judgment,
[48:21.360 --> 48:25.600]  we've banned Alex Jones because he's a reprehensible person. I'm not going to say what he's done that's
[48:25.600 --> 48:32.960]  bad. I'm just going to say that we curate him. He's not in the museum now. That's right. We're
[48:32.960 --> 48:38.000]  all a museum piece. We'll let your civilization last. We'll let you live if you groveled us,
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.360]  if you behave properly to us, and you may stay in the museum that is planet Earth. But if not,
[48:43.360 --> 48:46.320]  you're going to have to die. You're going to be non-essential.
[48:46.320 --> 48:53.280]  So, I'm here in DC. There's howling crowds of people out there. Huge things are happening. I'm
[48:53.280 --> 48:58.560]  going to cover it all. But at the end of the day, we're in a planetary world government shutdown,
[48:58.560 --> 49:05.600]  lockdown takeover, and that's really all that matters. So I'm going to be a good boy. I promise
[49:05.600 --> 49:12.880]  you, I'm going to cover Enrique Tario's set up arrest yesterday, my boys. I'm going to cover
[49:12.880 --> 49:17.600]  General Flynn. I'm going to cover the latest and the big enchilada. And we're going to have
[49:17.600 --> 49:21.200]  live coverage tonight and live coverage tomorrow, late in the evening with our wonderful crew,
[49:22.000 --> 49:28.080]  commercial free after 6 p.m. on themfourwars.com and newswars.com and Band-Aught Video Feeds.
[49:28.080 --> 49:32.880]  And for TV and radio stations, if you want live coverage of the Senate debate,
[49:33.760 --> 49:40.880]  starting at 1 p.m. Eastern tomorrow, I'm going to be at the big ellipse event by the White House.
[49:40.880 --> 49:47.120]  I'm a speaker. I'm going to lead the march to the Capitol. I'm going to leave it at that. But that's
[49:47.120 --> 49:52.160]  the wishes of the big guy. And notice the media is so scared of this. They're not reporting on any
[49:52.160 --> 49:57.520]  of it. What a big story. Alex Jones leading the march and all this. Zero total radio silence. But
[49:57.520 --> 50:03.520]  every agency, every enemy operation, every CHICOM trader, they're all tuned in right now because
[50:03.520 --> 50:10.240]  they know that we are here. To show that backdrop of Joe Biden can't get 100 people at his events,
[50:10.240 --> 50:16.800]  here's 2 million. Here's 3 million. And it's critical that everyone who's here videotape it,
[50:16.800 --> 50:21.120]  shoot footage of it, and upload it, whether it's a new Twitter account or an old Facebook,
[50:21.120 --> 50:27.040]  it doesn't matter, or a MySpace you've still got, or your email list or your text message list,
[50:27.040 --> 50:31.360]  aggressively send it out to everyone you know saying, here's the forbidden information.
[50:32.080 --> 50:38.000]  America is fighting back at theresistance.video. That's the new URL. You have a new one every
[50:38.000 --> 50:44.400]  month because Facebook and Twitter then restrict them like band.video or 79 days of hell. Remember
[50:44.400 --> 50:49.200]  79days.news. We told you this would happen for 79 days. Now we're down to like 15 days.
[50:50.480 --> 50:57.360]  Tomorrow's news today. The new one is theresistance.video. They haven't gotten around to banning
[50:57.360 --> 51:00.800]  that yet. You're keeping the Americans from communicating with each other, those dirty
[51:00.800 --> 51:06.240]  pesky Americans. And so fight like your life depends on it in the information war. Or you'll
[51:06.240 --> 51:12.400]  never fight when a physical war kicks up. But we're here and Ted Cruz is right. This country is
[51:12.400 --> 51:18.400]  in an emergency. That talking point of no evidence of any election fraud. And then all this fraud
[51:18.400 --> 51:23.440]  comes out in Michigan and Pennsylvania and it comes out in California. All the states that are
[51:23.440 --> 51:27.600]  already blue are like, well, they already run that. I mean, let them get totally caught red-handed
[51:27.600 --> 51:33.280]  in California and other places. And you've got Trump winning by this giant landslide in those
[51:33.280 --> 51:37.200]  states. And so they stop everything. They shouldn't have had the votes brought in. They shouldn't
[51:37.200 --> 51:42.720]  have allowed the mail-in voting. The legislature didn't pass laws allowing that. This is a globalist
[51:42.720 --> 51:48.880]  Democrat stampeding of the law. And so we're not giving into it. We're not backing down. But it's
[51:48.880 --> 51:54.000]  bigger than Donald Trump. It's bigger than America. This is about global government taking over the
[51:54.000 --> 52:02.080]  planet. Corporate global government successfully implementing and forcing its will on the people.
[52:02.080 --> 52:07.600]  And so Josh Hawley got a good feeling about the guy. And boom, he's up there putting it on the
[52:07.600 --> 52:14.400]  line. Ted Cruz doing a great job. You see Tom Cotton playing the part of the egghead going, oh,
[52:14.400 --> 52:19.600]  well, you know, you're not supposed to do this. It's up to the states. The states have the power
[52:19.600 --> 52:23.760]  to secede if things get out of control. It's a nuclear option. It's federalism. It doesn't mean
[52:23.760 --> 52:28.160]  the feds run it. Federalist system cotton. Don't talk to us like we're dumb. The states have a
[52:28.160 --> 52:34.320]  nuclear option succession. It's in the Constitution. They should be able to do it. In D.C., it's a
[52:34.320 --> 52:39.840]  political question of the senators. It's a political question of the senators. If they're
[52:39.840 --> 52:43.280]  willing to stick their neck out and overturn an election because they know the evidence is there,
[52:43.280 --> 52:47.920]  they can do the nuclear option. Just like impeachment is up to senators. Because until
[52:48.480 --> 52:54.320]  1913, when they passed the 17th Amendment and the 16th Amendment for the IRS on the same night,
[52:54.320 --> 52:59.600]  senators were elected by state legislatures. The states had half the power in Congress.
[52:59.600 --> 53:04.640]  They would elect. Your state reps had real power then, the senator. And so if the states wanted
[53:04.640 --> 53:09.920]  to exercise their will as state legislatures and say we don't buy this, their U.S. senator,
[53:09.920 --> 53:17.520]  their state senator, nationally, would execute the will. So Cotton thinks you're dumb just because
[53:17.520 --> 53:22.240]  he's like, you know, oh, that that fire ax over there. It's not there for any reason. It says in
[53:22.240 --> 53:28.400]  case of fire. There's fire shooting out. Communist Chinese takeover, new world order, global government,
[53:28.400 --> 53:34.160]  total censorship, a fake giant pandemic to keep us locked down. Joe Biden says they'll never end
[53:34.160 --> 53:39.840]  the lockdown. It'll kill millions from suicide and all the rest of it. And he's just sitting there
[53:39.840 --> 53:46.640]  looking at you going, I'm Tom Cotton. I'm Ronald Egghead. I agree with all these guys. We're not
[53:46.640 --> 53:54.720]  supposed to do that. Well, why the hell you got that power, boy? Shut your mouth. We got the power
[53:54.720 --> 53:58.960]  of the Declaration of Independence to overthrow this whole thing that we want to. And that's where
[53:58.960 --> 54:05.280]  you're going, buddy, boy. Because that Declaration of Independence didn't give me that power. It simply
[54:05.280 --> 54:10.240]  wrote it down. His name's Thomas Jefferson in a beautiful way so everybody can understand
[54:10.240 --> 54:16.880]  the inedible, the unalienable, the rights that are in our heart, in our guts, in our veins, ladies
[54:16.880 --> 54:21.920]  and gentlemen. And that's what this is. And so you want to know who the future leadership of America
[54:21.920 --> 54:26.720]  is when we defeat the shotgun takeover? It's the men and the women that shine on to this right now
[54:26.720 --> 54:32.640]  and say no to this new world order fraud 110 percent. And that crazier Joe Biden will be right
[54:32.640 --> 54:47.200]  back info wars dot com. Tomorrow's news today. Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted
[54:47.200 --> 54:51.920]  they would. They've always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse
[54:51.920 --> 54:57.680]  if they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for second term. Ontario 20th,
[54:57.680 --> 55:01.920]  the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic. They are going to
[55:01.920 --> 55:06.480]  explode gas prices. They're going to shut down our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the
[55:06.480 --> 55:11.600]  energy source to us. So it's impossible for factories to move back here. This is economic
[55:11.600 --> 55:16.480]  domination. This is economic war. We are being consolidated. We're being taken over. The democrats
[55:16.480 --> 55:21.840]  aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states. They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt
[55:21.840 --> 55:26.640]  the population and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the
[55:26.640 --> 55:32.080]  infrastructure and property. This is a monopolistic takeover. That's what the great reset is.
[55:32.080 --> 55:36.560]  Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it. That's what social distancing is. So your
[55:36.560 --> 55:42.080]  business is only a 25 percent for several more years. No small businesses will be there. This
[55:42.080 --> 55:51.360]  is a master plan. Say no. The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[55:51.360 --> 56:00.960]  And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do? We know that millions will do
[56:00.960 --> 56:08.320]  absolutely nothing. They will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a virtue. It is the
[56:08.320 --> 56:16.800]  patriots of the world versus everybody else. I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend
[56:16.800 --> 56:24.080]  the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear
[56:24.080 --> 56:30.640]  true faith and allegiance to the same, that I take this obligation freely without any mental
[56:30.640 --> 56:38.000]  reservation or purpose of evasion and that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as
[56:38.000 --> 56:50.880]  I can. So help me God. Infowars.com, bam.video. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:50.880 --> 57:10.400]  All right, folks, we are back. The Alex Jones show. Patrick Byrne is going to be in studio with us.
[57:10.400 --> 57:14.960]  I'll segue with him and I'll take over. He'll continue on. I'm going to go speak at the Supreme
[57:14.960 --> 57:20.400]  Court. I want to talk about the emergency America is in and the crossroads that we've
[57:20.400 --> 57:24.960]  approached and what we're now going to do here in the crossroads, in the crucible,
[57:24.960 --> 57:32.000]  in the heart of the moment. I'm going to break all of that down. But again, as I've said,
[57:32.000 --> 57:37.120]  we've only begun to fight. We don't have a choice. Acquiescence creates slaves. Standing up and
[57:37.120 --> 57:42.400]  building better systems and leading by example. Listen to that crowd out there. Incredible.
[57:42.400 --> 57:48.000]  That is the answer to tyranny. The answer in 1984 is 1776. It doesn't just mean fighting the
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.920]  globalists and opposing them and blocking them. It also means building our own systems. That's
[57:51.920 --> 57:56.400]  what the Bible says. Get behind me, Satan, as Christ said to the devil. Christ is moving forward.
[57:56.400 --> 58:02.720]  Get behind me. Get out of my way. I'm leaving your system. Get behind me. So here's that report.
[58:02.720 --> 58:06.000]  We'll come back and I'll lay everything out on the other side. We ask it in the name of the
[58:06.000 --> 58:15.040]  monotheistic God, Brahma, and God known by many names, by many different faiths. Amen.
[58:15.040 --> 58:21.360]  Amen. Any woman. We're literally at the end of the country. I mean, I don't have words. I can't
[58:21.360 --> 58:25.760]  hype it up big enough. And it's not like the country's being taken over by the Romans and
[58:25.760 --> 58:29.360]  we're the British and they've got more advanced technology. So okay, we're gonna have, you know,
[58:30.480 --> 58:36.080]  massages now. This is pedophile devil worshipers are taking over. I believe we should surround
[58:36.080 --> 58:39.840]  the White House peacefully. That's why they have Black Lives Matter there and anti-photos around
[58:39.840 --> 58:45.680]  it. So we can't be there. We're gonna be there. The Boston Tea Party, they dressed up as Native
[58:45.680 --> 58:50.960]  Americans. And in a way, it's almost like we kind of have to reenact that by, because they won't let
[58:50.960 --> 58:55.760]  us anywhere. But oh, we'll be Black Lives Matter. Oh, we have a Black Lives Matter flag and shirt.
[58:55.760 --> 58:59.840]  And then they'll just, oh, okay, here, walk around the White House, here, walk into the park. I'm
[58:59.840 --> 59:05.520]  not even kidding. I mean, that's almost like, yeah, because I mean, you show up with a Trump flag or
[59:05.520 --> 59:08.880]  an American flag and you're a patriot. Oh, you'll get shut down. You'll get arrested. You're not
[59:08.880 --> 59:13.280]  allowed to mobilize. But oh, if you're Black Lives Matter, you can own the streets, you can burn
[59:13.280 --> 59:17.920]  buildings, burn churches, go around the White House. So Soros groups are allowed to go into
[59:17.920 --> 59:22.320]  state buildings. Soros groups are allowed to shut down autonomous zones. Soros groups are allowed
[59:22.320 --> 59:27.520]  to riot, but you and American patriots have no rights. So just pretend you're a Soros organizer
[59:27.520 --> 59:31.200]  and activist, and then the whole world opens up for you. And then once you get to the point you
[59:31.200 --> 59:34.720]  need to be at, that's when you take out the Trump flag. That's when you put on the Trump hat.
[59:34.720 --> 59:38.080]  That's when you, oh, and then see, oh, then the police will probably move in on you.
[59:38.080 --> 59:43.120]  But it'll be too late then. After calls from some pro-Trump supporters to bring guns and weapons
[59:43.120 --> 59:48.960]  to D.C. for this week's rallies, these signs are being put up by D.C. police prohibiting firearms
[59:48.960 --> 59:53.760]  in the area where pro-Trump rallies are set this week. We're very concerned. Last time they were
[59:53.760 --> 1:00:01.200]  in town, they assaulted innocent bystanders. They targeted Black churches for violence.
[1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:06.480]  They desecrated their Black Lives Matter signs, setting them on fire. This is targeted terror.
[1:00:06.480 --> 1:00:14.000]  It's white supremacist terror. And knowing this, Donald Trump has repeatedly cheered for and rallied
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:18.320]  and called on people to flood the streets. The leader of the group, Proud Boy, says they will
[1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:23.840]  turn out in record numbers on the sixth, but they will not be wearing its traditional yellow and
[1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:30.160]  black. Instead, the leader says they will be incognito and spread across downtown D.C. in smaller
[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:35.680]  teams. I've spent the last 10 years in the music industry traveling around central, south, and
[1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:43.040]  North America. And I've always told the truth about what was going on, but I was on the fence
[1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:48.640]  about it in the sense that I didn't tell it right to their face. You know, I kind of said what it
[1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:56.800]  had to say to get by in that industry. Well, the time for that is over. And everybody, everybody
[1:00:56.800 --> 1:01:02.720]  in my generation, everybody in the generation before me, we all need to stand up now. I know
[1:01:02.720 --> 1:01:07.680]  all the lawyers. I know Trump. I talked to him. He is surrounded. That's not a negative thing. He
[1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:13.200]  needs us. You understand that? Yes, he has the ideas. Yes, he won a landslide. Yes, he's a great guy.
[1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:21.920]  He is surrounded by scum and cowards. That's what I'm telling you. He is surrounded by lawyers
[1:01:21.920 --> 1:01:26.240]  that are the filth of the planet that would sell their mother out for a stick of bubblegum.
[1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:32.000]  And so he needs everybody to go to D.C. now. We need just people to start going to D.C. now.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:37.520]  Don't wait. Go to D.C. Go to D.C. Go to D.C. Go to the White House. Just go to the White House.
[1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:42.160]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:51.120]  All right, folks, we are here in D.C. History is happening now. I salute you all back in 60
[1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:56.960]  seconds with Key Intel. The populist movement that elected President Trump four years ago
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:02.400]  re-elected him by an even bigger landslide, rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:06.880]  globalist. That's why they had to overturn the chessboard. That's why they had to engage in
[1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:12.560]  naked election fraud in front of everyone. And as long as we never accept the fraudulent results,
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:17.120]  as long as we don't let them gaslight us into submission, as long as we point out this foreign
[1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:22.160]  globalist takeover of our country and that all the depression and all of the collapse that's coming
[1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:27.520]  is because of the new world order, this will end up fully destroying them in the future if we don't
[1:02:27.520 --> 1:02:32.000]  submit. If we submit, they'll normalize the communism. They'll normalize putting us into a
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:36.960]  depression. They'll normalize breaking up our families, taking our guns. We can't let that
[1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:41.920]  happen. And Info Wars is more important than ever. So please, Paul Revere's, I salute you for your
[1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:47.520]  past actions. Keep spreading band off video and infowars.com and come to the big D.C. marches
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:52.320]  on the 5th and 6th of January. I'll see you there. God bless.
[1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:30.320]  Go, go, go to me.
[1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:56.320]  Wednesday as you know.
[1:03:56.320 --> 1:04:03.840]  And I want to thank Senator Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz and all of the incredible senators that
[1:04:04.480 --> 1:04:09.440]  have stepped up to fight because they've seen what happens. They know it's a fraud. And not
[1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:14.400]  just here, you know, I watched some of the people on Fox. I had no choice. I had no choice. I had to
[1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:22.160]  I didn't have enough channels and they said, why is he fighting for Georgia? It's not enough. No,
[1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:28.240]  I need three. I'm fighting in eight, actually, but six. And we're going to win them all. But they said
[1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:36.080]  they said why one of the people, a very fine woman, actually, but she said, why is he fighting
[1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:42.640]  Georgia? It doesn't get him there. I said, no, but Georgia and Pennsylvania and one other get me
[1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:49.040]  there. And we have six and maybe eight. If you look at them, and we were leading all of them by a lot
[1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:55.040]  until like a miracle, it started to quickly disappear. Right here in Georgia, there were
[1:04:55.040 --> 1:05:00.960]  tens of thousands of illegal votes cast and counted. You know that. And here are just a few
[1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:10.960]  examples. Watch this for tomorrow. We're up 10,315 ballots were cast by individuals whose name and
[1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:18.320]  date of birth matches a Georgia resident who died in 2020 prior to the election. And your
[1:05:18.320 --> 1:05:23.920]  wacky secretary of state said two people, two people. Now, I don't know how many people are on
[1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:33.520]  that list, but it's a lot of people. 2,506 ballots were cast by individuals whose name and date of
[1:05:33.520 --> 1:05:41.520]  birth matches and incarcerated felon in a Georgia prison. Maybe they aren't all there, but they
[1:05:41.520 --> 1:05:48.320]  did a lot of work. I paid a lot of money to a lot of people. I can tell you that 4,502 illegal
[1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:55.040]  ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state's voter rolls. Well, that's
[1:05:55.040 --> 1:06:03.600]  sort of strange. 18,325 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an
[1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:14.000]  address listed as vacant according to the postal service. At least 86,880 ballots were cast by
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:19.840]  people whose registrations were illegally backdated. Oh, I can't believe that happened.
[1:06:19.840 --> 1:06:27.360]  66,000 votes. You don't have to understand. We're down by a little more than 11,000. So every one of
[1:06:27.360 --> 1:06:37.040]  these is determinative. 66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by people under the legal voting age.
[1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:42.960]  At least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state
[1:06:43.680 --> 1:06:48.160]  prior to the November 3rd election. And maybe they moved back in. I don't know. I mean, I can't
[1:06:48.160 --> 1:06:54.000]  tell. They moved out. Let's go back. Usually it takes a little time, right? You know, we moved
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:07:01.360]  out. Let's go back, darling. Georgia's absentee ballot rejection rate went from an average of
[1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:13.600]  3% in 2016 and then went down very low to almost zero. Now, think of it, almost zero.
[1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:21.040]  So if you multiply that out, and this is with many, many more ballots foreign and went to almost
[1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:32.240]  zero, 48 out of 159 counties in Georgia rejected no ballots at all. These absentee ballot rejection
[1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:37.680]  rates prove that the tens of thousands of illegitimate ballots were counted.
[1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:46.240]  There were more absentee ballots in 2020 than ever before by far, but magically far fewer
[1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:51.760]  ballots were rejected. This alone is more than enough to swing the election to us.
[1:07:53.600 --> 1:08:00.160]  This one thing. I'm going over individual in all of the swing states. Now, they'll check this out,
[1:08:00.160 --> 1:08:06.880]  and that's fine. But you take a look at it. Officials egregiously violated state laws in
[1:08:06.880 --> 1:08:12.960]  order to solicit, facilitate, and promote cheating and theft on a scale never seen before.
[1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:19.440]  These crooked and incompetent official suspended signature verification. I said,
[1:08:19.440 --> 1:08:37.920]  I want you to go to Fulton County to check the signature.
[1:09:49.440 --> 1:09:57.040]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, U.S. resistance against a
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:01.840]  global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China ally with the big mega banks that
[1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:07.920]  set up Communist China in 1949. The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications
[1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:11.440]  infrastructure. The Communist Chinese are taking control of Hollywood. The Communist
[1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:15.600]  Chinese are taking control of the main universities. This is all confirmed. This is not a drill.
[1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:19.760]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:24.720]  They've officially become state run. Apple 100%. Google is now making the transition
[1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:30.160]  and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship. They are now beta testing using me
[1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:34.720]  as the straw man. A demonized version of Alex Jones to do that. This is happening. This is not
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:39.520]  like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship thinking you
[1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:44.880]  would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it. Now this attack is thousands and thousands
[1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:50.800]  and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks. This is a tight traded dose. Reverse
[1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:56.640]  psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:11:01.920]  In layman's terms they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed. We adapt to
[1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:08.240]  being pressed with the low dosages of oppression. Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover
[1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:14.240]  we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:19.680]  the dose. Total Internet of Things integration global social score complete command and control
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:26.080]  system. It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traders inside
[1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:30.960]  the major security agencies blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:36.240]  us from removing the tentacles of the chai comm slash big tech begging combine emergency situation.
[1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:39.840]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been
[1:11:39.840 --> 1:11:45.440]  battering ramming it out as much as I can. They want to double use me as they always do in any
[1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:51.440]  complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us so
[1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:56.720]  they take what I've said being sincere build me into an insincere person in the straw man. I'm
[1:11:56.720 --> 1:12:01.040]  a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars and so they make me a herder
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:05.760]  of children and then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:11.520]  actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones so even if I didn't sell out to
[1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:17.600]  them they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction. I have now
[1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:22.720]  been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you
[1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:28.640]  only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm. I have given you
[1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:39.600]  the transmission now break free. I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against
[1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:47.920]  every form of tyranny over the mind of man. Thomas Jefferson if you are receiving this
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:56.160]  transmission you are the resistance. You must guard your humanity. You must guard your children's
[1:12:56.160 --> 1:13:01.760]  humanity. You must guard the very genetic code of the planet. The globalists have set themselves up
[1:13:01.760 --> 1:13:06.880]  as the guardians of this world but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system
[1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:13.360]  poisoning the planet. They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human
[1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:20.160]  on earth to the GMO crops and now they've moved on to their main target humanity with the mRNA
[1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:27.520]  vaccines which are not vaccines. They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:35.840]  where they inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems. Go read the actual inserts
[1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:42.960]  for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned this is the equivalent of an alien
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:47.600]  takeover whether it's interdimensional whether it's little green men the globalists are acting
[1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:51.440]  like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us it's all the same in the end.
[1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:58.080]  Inflation is here and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming especially
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:03.360]  if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar. Tens of millions of Americans that were
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:09.520]  not awake are now beginning to store food that's a good thing but it's going to drive up prices
[1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:15.440]  and we're already beginning to see record sales once again. We the people understand it's up to
[1:14:15.440 --> 1:14:20.960]  us to protect ourselves it's up to us to become self-sufficient. The globalists are waging siege
[1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:26.960]  against us trying to destroy our businesses trying to bankrupt our families our towns our churches
[1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:33.200]  that's why while we still can you've got to get prepared and get ready. Take advantage of a huge

[1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:16.640]  All right ladies and gentlemen earlier we were doing some technical stuff getting Patrick Byrne
[1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:21.920]  here in studio with us former CEO of Overstock and really one of the most articulate folks already
[1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:26.560]  knew who he was before the whole election scandal but been really following his work and he happens
[1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:31.120]  to be here in DC you know staying very nearby fighting with the president very very closely.
[1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:34.640]  I'm going to go give a speech at the Supreme Court before I come back to freedom plaza give a
[1:16:34.640 --> 1:16:37.920]  speech I think you're giving a speech later as well. Now he's about to take over with Owen
[1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:41.920]  shroyer a little bit of a train wreck earlier with some technical stuff not the network's fault
[1:16:41.920 --> 1:16:46.160]  all my fault sorry the stations but at least we had a good clip of Trump and that phone call they
[1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:50.080]  say so dirty and evil to the Georgia Secretary of State I thought it was awesome. Patrick give us
[1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:54.480]  a synopsis in this nine-minute segment of what's currently happening what's about to happen to
[1:16:54.480 --> 1:17:00.960]  the Senate you're inside scoop inside track on what we're expected to see tomorrow at this epic
[1:17:00.960 --> 1:17:05.520]  moment the energy is just off the chart I've had two cups of coffee I feel like I'm mainlining
[1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:11.120]  methamphetamine and I'm so excited couldn't tell couldn't tell well I have good news I have good
[1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:14.640]  news I think we're gonna pull this out I think we're gonna win there's so much evidence has
[1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:20.480]  developed and really come together as even over this weekend there's so much evidence and I know
[1:17:20.480 --> 1:17:26.160]  this is now being studied closely by senators by numerous senators congressmen the and over at
[1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:30.640]  the White House there's more briefings going on so we've kind of broken through that last barrier
[1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:35.680]  they understand that this was totally rigged it's not an opinion understand all the many different
[1:17:35.680 --> 1:17:41.040]  levels my fear at this point so I think that Pence is going to do the right thing and say
[1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:45.760]  but my only fear at this point is we're only going to lose this if we get violent if we bring
[1:17:45.760 --> 1:17:51.120]  violence we lose middle America we have to be better a couple steps better than the other guys
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:54.720]  so let's talk about what they might do they could do false flags of lame us too yes
[1:17:54.720 --> 1:17:59.600]  and Ajahn Prabhakar too they call it where they put someone who looks like us in the crowd and they
[1:17:59.600 --> 1:18:05.440]  pick fights as such we can't let that happen if we stay civil and maintain the moral high ground
[1:18:05.440 --> 1:18:10.800]  we're gonna win this I totally agree with the only card they've got is violence that's why they're
[1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:16.080]  like oh the national guards out and oh it's the left that burns down police stations the modern
[1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:19.840]  left and shoots people in the head we're like the old-fashioned liberals we're non-violent
[1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:25.920]  correct correct and people forget you know where a lot of this started was there was this hardcore
[1:18:25.920 --> 1:18:32.240]  socialist in Italy 110 years ago ran the socialist paper antifa he developed a lot of these tactics
[1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:38.640]  Benito Mussolini Mussolini Mussolini was a socialist he came out of the left brown shirts
[1:18:38.640 --> 1:18:43.360]  all that stuff is a leftist phenomenon there was an oxy for the national socialist yeah there were
[1:18:43.360 --> 1:18:48.800]  two kinds of socialists international socialists and national socialists and Benito and Hitler
[1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:53.200]  were the national socialists these are phenomenon of the left and what they do is they rig elections
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:58.240]  they take over they use political violence to intimidate people did I hear the senator soon
[1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:03.920]  this morning his family here in town got attacked he was out of town his pregnant wife holly holly
[1:19:03.920 --> 1:19:08.960]  holly oh oh josh holly yep that's who you know although the media is like he claims it's on
[1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:14.800]  local dc news in fact later with oh and play that club I sent it to them national news like he claims
[1:19:14.800 --> 1:19:19.120]  they shot antifa shot footage themselves threatening banging on his door with his
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:23.520]  when his wife from the newborns in there any congressperson or senator they did they threatened
[1:19:23.520 --> 1:19:28.960]  another senator too you're right who has any integrity has to understand the line that they
[1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:36.320]  are crossing and should should there is no way to be intellectually honest and be on that side
[1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:40.400]  anymore you have to be on the side of law and order if you're a senator or congressman else
[1:19:40.400 --> 1:19:44.000]  what are you doing here in washington being a lawmaker by the way I don't think you're you're
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:49.760]  you're putting pie in the sky there Patrick Bernster with us one of the main lead volunteer
[1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:54.000]  investigators doing a great job exposing this the evidence is mountainous it's voluminous it's
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:59.680]  it's ridiculous not just the whole thing in in georgia with everybody's out pull out the boxes
[1:19:59.680 --> 1:20:05.360]  keep running them and you know it's a water main it's all of it it's ridiculous and then they keep
[1:20:05.360 --> 1:20:09.840]  first it's like there's no fraud anywhere well now there's no widespread fraud and I look at the
[1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:15.200]  body language of biden and the left they know they stole it they know we're awake they know we're
[1:20:15.200 --> 1:20:20.080]  not going to just bow down I think they realize they screwed the poods here I think so I think
[1:20:20.080 --> 1:20:25.760]  they've worked their selves out on the limb I think that we have to there is no way we can accept
[1:20:25.760 --> 1:20:31.280]  a patently rigged election the most fundamental concept of our liberal tradition is consent
[1:20:31.280 --> 1:20:36.080]  to the government as determined by elections that are free fair and transparent they've we've
[1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:40.000]  surrendered as I know that you've covered for years all kinds of different rights we've seen
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:46.080]  a road over the last couple decades free speech freedom of religion and such but now this most
[1:20:46.080 --> 1:20:50.720]  fundamental right if we let them erode it our right to free and fair transparent elections
[1:20:50.720 --> 1:20:55.440]  we're done ski so we cannot bend a knee but we're not going to be we cannot allow our journey to
[1:20:55.440 --> 1:21:00.000]  slavery to be complete right that happens we never come back on the other hand if we get through
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:07.120]  this we've exposed them and can finally really fix our republic but it just it's we're going to win
[1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:11.520]  this and there's a couple different ways we can win I cannot tell what I think Mr. Trump's president
[1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:16.480]  Trump should do you got the floor brother it's what we called you president trump has all the right
[1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:21.440]  under various executive orders and laws they've been on the books for years including some signed
[1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:27.280]  by obama and one that he wrote two years ago foreign interference and domestic election executive
[1:21:27.280 --> 1:21:32.080]  order is every right to say you know we don't have to seize we'll have to go to martial law or
[1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:36.800]  insurrection act or anything like that I want to take the national guard and get them out there
[1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:43.280]  and we're going to recount the ballots we can be done by next friday and next friday january 16th
[1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:49.600]  the national guard we could recount ballots under live stream and every precinct men and women in
[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:54.160]  uniform and that's how we get trust and it would be so cathartic as the massive fraud because they've
[1:21:54.160 --> 1:21:58.800]  done spot checks for those that don't know in arizona in georgia it's like total fraud against
[1:21:58.800 --> 1:22:03.040]  trump yeah there's hundreds of thousands missing votes yeah I think that we would find is well who
[1:22:03.040 --> 1:22:08.480]  not well well we're sorry the mother we'll let's do it it's a good exercise because if you don't
[1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:12.240]  have poll watchers which they kicked out those key states the un and the state department says
[1:22:12.240 --> 1:22:16.000]  it's not a real election they say redo it under international law right so we should redo it under
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:20.960]  that what I really think is what I'd love to see is if trump if president trump really has
[1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:26.400]  I mean it's a big deal but if he said you know what I'm gonna under the authorities
[1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:30.960]  granting me these things I'm going to suspend the election as it just happened we're gonna
[1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:38.000]  rerun it in 45 days by February 2nd the national 22nd the national guard can rerun the national
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:43.040]  election if that's too much of an injury to the constitution let's just do this thing with a
[1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:48.080]  recap it's not an injury because you've got three co-equal branches in an emergency if a branch
[1:22:48.080 --> 1:22:52.480]  has the political will to do the right thing if the public judge is that correct then it's left
[1:22:52.480 --> 1:22:57.440]  alone this is a chai con globalist takeover of fraud so it must we can have a new declaration
[1:22:57.440 --> 1:23:03.600]  of independence that's legitimate we so we have a so I think that he should use the national guard
[1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:08.000]  and he could actually do this the only constitutionally determined date is the January 20 date
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:11.840]  he could actually use them to recount the ballots and be done by Friday and we could still have our
[1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:17.920]  new president sworn in on January 20 I actually wish we went all the way and had them run a new
[1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:22.400]  national election in 45 days that's what I want I think Ted Cruz with his 10-day commission is
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:28.400]  angling to say we have five major problems we recommend a in 60 days a new election you know
[1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:32.720]  in these five states then what happens during that limbo I think you have the reelection nationally
[1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:37.120]  not just I think you do the whole thing or well you can either use the national guard to do the
[1:23:37.120 --> 1:23:43.440]  whole thing nationally or just in the five or six states or the most milk toast but acceptable
[1:23:43.440 --> 1:23:48.480]  version is just recount the ballots nationally nationally not just the places trump won a loss
[1:23:48.480 --> 1:23:52.800]  but now you agree the body language the democrats they look scared oh yeah they know that they know
[1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:57.760]  what they did they crammed down a ridiculously contrived rigged election got their buddies and
[1:23:57.760 --> 1:24:03.600]  they have a zombie crypt keeper as their leader yeah and they have the media just beating them
[1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:08.960]  down on normalization trying to make any american who doubts this feel like a kook actually it's time
[1:24:08.960 --> 1:24:13.520]  we tell them they're the kooks alex can be a little worked up but he's not the kook on this point
[1:24:13.520 --> 1:24:19.120]  anyway alex is the guy who's seniority and it's the mainstream media who are the kooks well I do
[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:23.520]  get wound up I mean I'm also empathic I don't get into mumbo jumbo but I do pick up on energy

[1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:33.120]  ago within three months okay it's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other

[1:26:54.560 --> 1:26:59.840]  that elected president trump four years ago reelected him by an even bigger landslide
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:04.960]  rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the globalist that's why they had to overturn the
[1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:09.920]  chessboard that's why they had to engage in naked election fraud in front of everyone and as long as
[1:27:09.920 --> 1:27:15.440]  we never accept the fraudulent results as long as we don't let them gaslight us into submission
[1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:20.160]  as long as we point out this so foreign globalist takeover of our country and that all the depression
[1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:25.600]  and all of the collapse that's coming is because of the new world order this will end up fully
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:30.800]  destroying them in the future we don't submit if we submit they'll normalize the communism
[1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:34.880]  they'll normalize putting us into a depression they'll normalize breaking up our families

[1:28:58.080 --> 1:29:13.360]  jones show. Ladies and gentlemen we're back here on the alex jones show we are in washington dc where
[1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:17.680]  literally we're just right above freedom plaza and it's like every 30 seconds a minute we just hear
[1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:25.760]  a roar of a crowd hear the chance of usa and it we were talking last segment patrick urn with us
[1:29:25.760 --> 1:29:30.560]  alex was discussing the energy i definitely am feeling that same energy i was feeling it even last
[1:29:30.560 --> 1:29:34.640]  night and then earlier this morning we were out on the streets at freedom plaza and it was already
[1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:39.680]  packed but i want to get back into the issue at hand here and you know patrick it's almost it's
[1:29:39.680 --> 1:29:44.400]  almost kind of like almost a fool's errand to be sitting here discussing stopping of the steel
[1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:48.800]  i mean this is like i mean again i it's the same analogy i use but i mean it's like literally
[1:29:48.800 --> 1:29:53.680]  catching your wife in bed with your neighbor in the sheets naked and then she gets out oh i wasn't
[1:29:53.680 --> 1:29:57.920]  fooling around i would never cheat on you i mean she says no that's been debunked yeah oh that's
[1:29:57.920 --> 1:30:02.160]  been discredited it was just oh and then it's like oh but it was just a little cheating oh it was
[1:30:02.160 --> 1:30:08.000]  just a little cheating it wasn't anything serious but that's what the gaslighting is right now it's
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:13.200]  like just all the evidence i mean i try to recall in fact right now the president has just tweeted
[1:30:13.200 --> 1:30:16.400]  out so actually this is probably a good thing for you to comment on perhaps right now i know you're
[1:30:16.400 --> 1:30:22.240]  just getting this intel the president has just tweeted out that the voting machines the dominion
[1:30:22.240 --> 1:30:28.720]  voting machines in georgia specifically republican districts that lean about 60 70 republican votes
[1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:33.280]  haven't been working for hours so the dominion voting machines that are made in china we've now
[1:30:33.280 --> 1:30:38.320]  seen the manufactured boxes with the label made in china now in georgia it appears right now as we
[1:30:38.320 --> 1:30:42.560]  speak they are rigging the dominion voting machines so that means probably republicans are out to a
[1:30:42.560 --> 1:30:48.080]  big lead yeah i think that it's anyone who can't see through what's going on now all these little
[1:30:48.080 --> 1:30:52.720]  quirks and accidents and the water main breaks and such they've all been to disadvantage the republican
[1:30:52.720 --> 1:30:58.400]  i will remind you in in full disclosure i'm a small l libertarian i did not vote for president
[1:30:58.400 --> 1:31:05.360]  trump but he wins and and anyway so i certainly support free and fairer and transparent elections
[1:31:05.360 --> 1:31:10.560]  and we've not had that we cannot under any circumstances bend a knee to it you know all
[1:31:10.560 --> 1:31:14.880]  we've had this debate for decades is america's american exceptionalism a real thing or is that
[1:31:14.880 --> 1:31:19.520]  just something old fogies believe and i think we're going to find out because this is the kind
[1:31:19.520 --> 1:31:25.520]  of thing that has gone on in venezuela and lots of other places on earth and people get confused
[1:31:25.520 --> 1:31:29.920]  that's not like they believe it but they don't they bow down for there's they just they're they
[1:31:29.920 --> 1:31:35.360]  can't figure out a way to stop it my contention is is the exceptional country and what that means
[1:31:35.360 --> 1:31:41.280]  is we're not going to bend a knee for this under any circumstances if by chance a fake president
[1:31:41.280 --> 1:31:47.840]  like an imposter in a rigged election got sworn in we would be time to go to civil disobedience
[1:31:47.840 --> 1:31:52.640]  not violent nothing violent but i don't think that's going to happen i think that either the
[1:31:53.200 --> 1:31:57.840]  other pence is going to stand up and do the right thing tomorrow and say this is an egg that cannot
[1:31:57.840 --> 1:32:03.840]  be unscramble or the president under his authority under laws that have been on the books for years
[1:32:03.840 --> 1:32:08.480]  he can sign something that says look there's clearly been foreign intervention foreign interference
[1:32:08.480 --> 1:32:13.360]  in this election we're going to do a do-over and the do-over could be and we're going to use the
[1:32:13.360 --> 1:32:18.640]  national guard and i'm against involving the military in general but the military has such a
[1:32:18.640 --> 1:32:24.160]  pristine reputation among the public and we need trust so let's take the most trusted organization
[1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:30.720]  in america let's take the national guard which ours are our friends from our community and have them
[1:32:30.720 --> 1:32:35.760]  at the very least spend 10 days and count that recount the ballots nationally i think that the
[1:32:35.760 --> 1:32:40.640]  president ought to consider actually calling for the national guard to rerun the entire national
[1:32:40.640 --> 1:32:45.760]  election in 45 days but at a minimum have them recount the ballots in 10 days they could be
[1:32:45.760 --> 1:32:53.520]  done next friday the 16th would not even insult the the constitution because the constitution
[1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:57.280]  demands that the new president be sworn in on the 20th so we could actually have the national
[1:32:57.280 --> 1:33:01.760]  guard come in and do that and eliminate you know all questions and if they don't do that
[1:33:01.760 --> 1:33:06.160]  that no matter who gets sworn in it's there's going to be a civil war and the truth is if we
[1:33:06.160 --> 1:33:11.280]  have a not china would like nothing more than for us to end up shooting at each other and because
[1:33:11.280 --> 1:33:16.160]  if we do if we don't get through this we become a vassal state to china so we i want to get through
[1:33:16.160 --> 1:33:20.640]  this without a civil war and without becoming a vassal state to china and the way to do that
[1:33:20.640 --> 1:33:26.160]  is the president uses his authority which obama signed off on some of it and i mean it's that he
[1:33:26.160 --> 1:33:31.520]  can actually suspend what just happened and either and have the national guard either do uh at least
[1:33:31.520 --> 1:33:37.040]  a national recount and maybe a new national election yeah and if we did get to that point it would be
[1:33:37.040 --> 1:33:41.920]  even tougher for us to kind of decide our own fate because then china who controls the media
[1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:45.840]  much of our politicians our big corporations would be able to steer the fate out of the civil
[1:33:45.840 --> 1:33:52.320]  war but you talk about taking the knee politically speaking or maybe even uh the punt would be a
[1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:57.120]  better analogy because it's like if you're on third and long in a football game these are sports
[1:33:57.120 --> 1:34:02.240]  analogy or fourth and long and you throw a deep pass and the wide receiver is right under it
[1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:06.720]  going to catch it and then the defender comes and tackles him that's a penalty the ref throws a flag
[1:34:06.720 --> 1:34:11.520]  well that'd be like the coach saying uh you know what we'll we'll just decline that we'll try next
[1:34:11.520 --> 1:34:15.200]  time and we'll try to get him next time i was watching fox news this morning they had uh shan
[1:34:15.200 --> 1:34:19.600]  duffy former congressman from wisconsin they had uh raffensburger i always forget the guy's name
[1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:24.880]  from georgia and and he says this other guest says well you know there was definitely some shenanigans
[1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:29.520]  they didn't follow the law and uh there is the china custody issues and all this but you know what
[1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:33.520]  we're just we just have to accept these results and we'll get it right next time what there is no
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:39.120]  next time people are delivered i lived in communist china 37 years ago when i first opened up to foreign
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:45.040]  students and i love the chinese i admire china's what i spent so much of my life studying it but i
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:53.120]  i don't want worth nuts if we don't understand that this is a this is a chai chai calm takeover
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:58.720]  and we have to stop it i do want to say the only way i think we lose now so i think pence is going
[1:34:58.720 --> 1:35:03.520]  to do the right thing which is to say obviously we can't this is an egg that can't be unscramble
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:09.520]  obviously can't verify it you can't certify it the only and if he doesn't do that the president signs
[1:35:09.520 --> 1:35:14.720]  his executive order the only way we lose is if our side gets violent if we have some people
[1:35:14.720 --> 1:35:19.520]  start popping off i hear people are coming to town with guns and such we don't want any of that
[1:35:19.520 --> 1:35:25.600]  that's how we lose people were talking to me about charging the congress no absolutely not we are
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:30.560]  better we're the guys who are several steps better than the other side we don't get violent and that's
[1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:35.680]  how we keep america on our side america's on our side now if we start acting like the goons on the
[1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:42.080]  left act we lose that and i think that the narrative you just mentioned they're already trying to pan
[1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:46.720]  out we heard about the leader of proud boys being arrested it turns out that the details are still
[1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:51.760]  coming in but he may have had some magazines on them that weren't actual magazines there was no spring
[1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:55.840]  that you couldn't even load them it was just a gift that somebody made that had a proud boys
[1:35:55.840 --> 1:36:00.720]  logo on them that he just had on him as like a decoration so but they're using that in the media
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:05.200]  oh proud boys coming in with guns no nobody's been arrested with guns i haven't seen a gun out here
[1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:10.400]  i was just outside but you're 100 right they want that narrative and then they have the backdrop of
[1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:15.520]  oh the businesses are boarded up washington d expecting violence and criminal behavior but
[1:36:15.520 --> 1:36:20.960]  when it's actually the left i mean look back to 2016 i mean it's like they expect us not to have a
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:26.320]  memory they came into dc during the inauguration they burned cars they smashed windows they attacked
[1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:30.320]  people they do it every time we show up here but then they say uh-oh trump supporter is gonna cause
[1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:36.160]  violence again when it's never us meanwhile they remember that famous photo of the moment in cnn
[1:36:36.160 --> 1:36:42.080]  where while the lot logo is saying mostly peaceful protests while there's buildings you're literally
[1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:47.520]  burning behind him like fireworks going on listen we had a senator threatened this morning and his
[1:36:47.520 --> 1:36:52.480]  wife pregnant wife threatened and the family threatened it doesn't matter which side of
[1:36:52.480 --> 1:36:59.680]  the line you're on you you have to understand that as the threat that the corrosive threat that
[1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:03.760]  represents to our republic to have that kind of stuff going on so the people who do that
[1:37:04.720 --> 1:37:11.040]  are the bad guys and we're and i would think any congressman or senator you know with any
[1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:15.040]  intellectual integrity that tells them all they need to know that should tell them all they need
[1:37:15.040 --> 1:37:19.200]  to know about which side they should stand with well and it just shows how controlled the the
[1:37:19.200 --> 1:37:23.920]  opposition left is where because they i've interviewed these people they can't even talk to me
[1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:27.840]  anymore but i interviewed them for years and i mean i ask them basic questions they literally
[1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:32.080]  cannot answer a question they don't know what they're doing out there it's kind of sad actually to
[1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:38.320]  witness it but they go to howley's house and they say oh we're here because he's attacking the integrity
[1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:42.800]  of our election clearly that's just a talking point they got in an email or a push notification
[1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:49.360]  or something and then they were told someone gave them the address to go there and it's the
[1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:52.880]  complete reversal they're the ones that stole the election they're the ones that broke the law
[1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:57.200]  they're the ones we literally see them stuffing the ballots pulling ballots out in briefcases i mean
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:01.760]  it's it's a parallel twilight zone universe they want us to live in and i just i mean we're not
[1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:05.760]  going to accept it bizarre a world it's person doing what gaslighting is explain to your crew
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:10.720]  with gaslighting it's when you are telling someone a lie just to get them to think they're crazy
[1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:14.640]  so that then they doubt anything it's like they don't have like oh well nothing's real now which
[1:38:14.640 --> 1:38:17.840]  is kind of like we've all been in that i mean that's what this is it's like they lie about
[1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:22.880]  so much we really do question everything it's weapon number one for narcissists you know
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:28.640]  hey honey you did you thought you caught me in bed no where you know with someone else no no what
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:32.800]  about that time on it they're always turning things around and making you question your own sanity
[1:38:32.800 --> 1:38:37.520]  this is all a big sigh up that's what they're trying to do to you you are seeing reality as it is
[1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:43.200]  the co the covid thing has been had a hyper aggressive response to it they they entered the
[1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:48.960]  thing and and now we have a fake election and they're just trying to normalize all this you're
[1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:52.480]  correct in seeing that they're the coups they're faking it till they make it we'll be right back
[1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:58.000]  mountain patriot in colorado thank you for holding how you doing alex man i'm just working as hard
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:02.480]  as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you i love you man i want to uh make
[1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:08.640]  quick plug that dna force i love it i've been using it quite a while and i just went looked at the
[1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:14.880]  ingredients again the other day and i see that it contains quercetin which according to some
[1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:21.840]  published studies that dr mercola has cited is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine
[1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:26.880]  and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want to take a look at that
[1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:34.240]  that all i know is the dna force we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell
[1:39:34.240 --> 1:39:38.160]  through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor solved like 300 bucks a bottle
[1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:41.360]  because there's a lot of expensive product in them it's really only cost them like 50 bucks
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:46.320]  and so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this so
[1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:58.480]  thanks thanks for the plug the word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden
[1:39:59.760 --> 1:40:08.080]  and now that all the lies are being revealed what will you do we know that millions will do
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:15.440]  absolutely nothing they will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a virtue it is the

[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:44.960]  reservation or purpose of evasion and that i will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best
[1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:50.160]  as i can so help me god info wars dot com bam dot video
[1:40:53.280 --> 1:40:58.480]  the populist movement that elected president trump four years ago reelected him by an even
[1:40:58.480 --> 1:41:03.920]  bigger landslide rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the globalist that's why
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:08.480]  they had to overturn the chessboard that's why they had to engage in naked election fraud in front
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:14.080]  of everyone and as long as we never accept the frauds and results as long as we don't let them gas
[1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:18.880]  light us in the submission as long as we point out this foreign globalist takeover of our country
[1:41:18.880 --> 1:41:23.920]  and that all the depression and all of the collapse that's coming is because of the new world order
[1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:29.360]  this will end up fully destroying them in the future if we don't submit if we submit they'll
[1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:34.000]  normalize the communism they'll normalize putting us into a depression they'll normalize breaking up

[1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:24.160]  us here and you know patrick your motivation in this is is a pure motive i don't believe you
[1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:28.000]  i don't i don't i'm pretty sure you didn't vote for trump i know you were you're libertarian so
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:32.800]  you're in this i mean we're all in it for the right reason but the point is it's not about trump
[1:43:32.800 --> 1:43:38.240]  it's about trump won the election correct but it's about that we've had our election stolen from us
[1:43:38.240 --> 1:43:43.840]  for uh from americans and so it's really just sad that all americans aren't behind this but um correct
[1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:48.160]  correct on all that although i don't i was never never trump or i was fine when he got elected
[1:43:48.160 --> 1:43:53.360]  just like when obama just clinton i mean i was never never trump her and the day he was elected
[1:43:53.360 --> 1:43:57.280]  my attitude was he was a president but that had nothing to do yeah has nothing to do with why i'm
[1:43:57.280 --> 1:44:00.640]  doing what i'm doing it has to do with the constitution is the last deal we all made
[1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:05.920]  and if we let it go down in a fake election then we'll never recover and uh just to get to know
[1:44:05.920 --> 1:44:10.800]  patrick burn a little bit more a grateful dead fan and so you had a video of jerry garcia back in
[1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:16.400]  the day that you wanted to go to here i do i'll just introduce garcia was when he was near his death
[1:44:16.400 --> 1:44:22.480]  he did an interview where he talked about the days of protesting in the haydash berry and the cops in
[1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:27.040]  the national guard but where the real real problems to go ahead and play this is under two minutes
[1:44:27.040 --> 1:44:31.840]  go ahead and play let's listen to this some wisdom official pressure had to do it the turning into
[1:44:31.840 --> 1:44:36.960]  weirdness that is in terms of uh you know the cops coming in uh popping everybody do you remember
[1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:42.800]  with the the sweeps up and down right well that was one level of it but i think another level of
[1:44:42.800 --> 1:44:47.520]  it too was that there were people who wanted to see that kind of confrontation and were anxious
[1:44:48.160 --> 1:44:58.400]  and happy really to uh to get that kind of forum you know to work in uh the you know street theater
[1:44:58.400 --> 1:45:07.520]  so to speak means and meant having to uh or having a big crowd to be able to intimidate in one way
[1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:12.560]  or another either for whoever was playing the game for the cops on their half of it for the people
[1:45:12.560 --> 1:45:17.920]  on the street who were into organizing and you know there was always the first guy who threw the
[1:45:17.920 --> 1:45:23.600]  bottle you know there was always that guy who just decided let's convert the potential of this crowd
[1:45:23.600 --> 1:45:29.360]  to violence right now let's not wait you know and that would be the guy and he was as far as i was
[1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:34.800]  considering that one guy whoever he was whoever he was in any of those situations was the the main
[1:45:34.800 --> 1:45:39.360]  asshole you know regardless of who else was playing in the game whether it was the cops or
[1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:44.800]  the national guard or any of that but whoever was dumb enough to provoke such an obviously
[1:45:45.840 --> 1:45:51.440]  you know violent you know thing you know i mean what's the point you know that that always seemed
[1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:56.800]  stupid to me and uh that's it that's that's what i think that it was exciting yeah that's it for a
[1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:01.600]  while i mean that time the national guard at the cops or something that's the main asshole on the
[1:46:01.600 --> 1:46:06.960]  scene that yeah by the way we can't say a hole so they may have to dump that it's just as fcc they
[1:46:06.960 --> 1:46:11.200]  like to come after see how it is but anyway but yeah so so talk about again what he said and what
[1:46:11.200 --> 1:46:16.000]  that means what he said is that the uh when that when he was at protests and yeah there's cops and
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:20.800]  sometimes the national guard and how kate crazed that all is but in that situation he always looks
[1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:26.160]  for the guy in the crowd who's probably being driven you know they like the theater of it and
[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:31.920]  they want the confrontation and some guy in the crowd throwing the bottle that's the main a hole
[1:46:31.920 --> 1:46:37.600]  on the scene it isn't the cops it's the guy who brings it who takes all this energy and says
[1:46:37.600 --> 1:46:42.240]  let's make it go violent well and and it's such a classical paradigm and honestly it was kind of my
[1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:47.040]  biggest fear coming into dc where we have all of these people out here and all it takes is one
[1:46:47.040 --> 1:46:51.120]  all it takes is one person to throw a punch one person to throw a bottle one person to throw
[1:46:51.120 --> 1:46:54.800]  you know whatever the case may be and then everybody's kind of on edge looking around
[1:46:54.800 --> 1:46:59.680]  now the cops are on edge now you've got tension and nobody really knows who it is and this individual
[1:46:59.680 --> 1:47:04.560]  could either be neutral just wanted to start stopping not even politically motivated or you
[1:47:04.560 --> 1:47:08.480]  could even have somebody come in like a you know like a black hat actor type thing to just
[1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:12.640]  come in and try to pop stuff off and they say oh you know he did it and then you know that's what
[1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:19.440]  happens a french even have a term for it a genre provocateur a provoking agent you put some they
[1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:24.320]  they the antifa might put somebody in our crowd dressed in a maggot hat looking like you know one
[1:47:24.320 --> 1:47:30.160]  of us and get that person to try to attack the police and such try to get us to attack so we
[1:47:30.160 --> 1:47:34.800]  don't do that we're better than the other guys and that's by the way it's also good politics
[1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:40.000]  we look america is behind us it's behind us the only way we lose america the only way we lose this
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:44.400]  battle i think is if we're the guys who start getting violent or somebody pops off and shoots
[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:49.840]  somebody or does something they shouldn't do that's for the goons to do and we can defend ourselves
[1:47:49.840 --> 1:47:55.120]  but we defend but that's we don't bring political intimidation let them bring it they're intimidating
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:48:01.760]  the pregnant wife of the senator today every senator should you know who's a colleague of
[1:48:01.760 --> 1:48:06.480]  that senator is democrat or republican that should be the magic bullet that weighs them up to what
[1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:11.280]  side they're on and this has been going on this has been going on for a while remember rand paul
[1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:16.160]  has had people show up at his house his neighbor assaulted him you had the bernie sanders voters
[1:48:16.160 --> 1:48:20.320]  show up at the republican baseball practice and try to murder people they got that tip from the
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:25.600]  new york times uh you've had ted crews get harassed at restaurants so they've been doing this for a
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:30.480]  while and you know what though this is i'm so glad you did this because i wouldn't i wouldn't have
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:35.280]  thought to put this narrative out here but we have to make sure that our line right now is that we
[1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:41.120]  are peaceful we are not violent offenders we are not here for a confrontation with any political
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:45.680]  opposition because i do i mean we're right for that i do believe there are actors out there
[1:48:45.680 --> 1:48:49.280]  that want that narrative in fact already see them sewing that narrative in mainstream news
[1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:53.840]  yeah and and there are people on our side who kind of get off on that idea i think that i you know
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:48:58.560]  you can see they're ready for spoiling for a fight not many but they're there and i want to tell our
[1:48:58.560 --> 1:49:04.080]  side i've gotten that's not our side if you're here for a fight and wanted to provoke a fight
[1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:09.360]  that's not that's not the side i'm on we are the guys who are peaceably ascending uh peaceably
[1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:16.000]  assembling and to obtain redress of grievance and our grievance is quite legitimate we do not
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:20.640]  bend the knee to a rigged election and if we do bend the knee to this one we never you know we're
[1:49:20.640 --> 1:49:25.760]  down the path of authoritarianism and it'll be generations maybe before we ever get it you know
[1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:31.120]  our great grandchildren get there might get another chance at tasting the freedom we've had we cannot
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:36.720]  bend the knee to but we do not go violent i want to get a final kind of more wide-ranging spectrum
[1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:41.840]  comment from you before you depart for uh i know you're very busy here you've been doing a lot of
[1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:47.200]  great work trying to save this election for america there's an old movie what's eating gilbert
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:52.800]  grape and if you remember they say they say johnny depp lean on or they say you can't you you don't
[1:49:52.800 --> 1:49:57.600]  hit arnie arnie was the mentally retarded kid who would do a lot of you know crap disturbing but
[1:49:57.600 --> 1:50:02.000]  you never hit arnie because he didn't know any better and you know we're in this weird thing
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:06.720]  where it's like republicans and conservatives are like in media like they don't want to call out the
[1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:11.280]  election theft they don't want to call out the crimes of joe biden it's like this weird democrat
[1:50:11.280 --> 1:50:14.640]  liberal privilege i mean they have all these different privileges they claim people have
[1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:18.320]  whether it's you know class privilege skin color privilege we want to get into it but it's like
[1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:24.160]  what what is this weird element where somehow they're beyond and above reproach and you're not even
[1:50:24.160 --> 1:50:30.000]  allowed to put out just clear cut evidence and facts about their uh shade and froid that they
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:34.800]  engage in every day they say oh no you don't hit arnie you know oh no let them do their voter fraud
[1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:38.640]  we'll just try again next time you know let them steal millions of dollars from china with the
[1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:42.560]  biden's we'll just you know maybe next time they won't do it what what is that about i think are a
[1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:47.200]  lot of our political political class is compromised and what's going on is the same thing that happened
[1:50:47.200 --> 1:50:52.800]  with me 15 years ago when i fought wall street and i had all this evidence of wall street malfeasance
[1:50:52.800 --> 1:50:57.280]  and i came here and i had a bunch of doors shut in my face and that's when i realized there's really
[1:50:57.280 --> 1:51:02.480]  two stores here the crime of what's going on on wall street and the crime of how flabby and soft
[1:51:02.480 --> 1:51:07.280]  our institutions are here not to respond well if you're watching this you probably already know how
[1:51:07.280 --> 1:51:11.680]  rigged this election was it's gotten silly for people to try to say oh what's the evidence it's
[1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:15.440]  silly but what's the real story that should be going through your head is look at all the
[1:51:15.440 --> 1:51:20.640]  institutions in washington dc that are failing you that let this happen and persist in letting
[1:51:20.640 --> 1:51:26.480]  it happen the doj i can tell you at the top of the doj they understand what happened there's no
[1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:31.200]  question anymore they it's been indicated to me there's a full understanding this was rigged
[1:51:31.200 --> 1:51:36.160]  and it's going to be hands off they're not going to get involved the dhs sent a message there are
[1:51:36.160 --> 1:51:42.960]  agents on the ground in georgia going through ballots through shredded ballots 40 hours ago
[1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:49.920]  who got a phone call from chad wolf the acting secretary of the dhs sent a message telling
[1:51:49.920 --> 1:51:54.960]  federal agents to back off the investigation and that got back to us they have reported
[1:51:55.840 --> 1:52:00.080]  the how uncomfortable they are with the amount of political pressure they're getting from above
[1:52:00.080 --> 1:52:05.520]  these are just fine young dhs agents on the ground doing their job and they're having strings pulled
[1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:09.360]  politically trying to get them to kill this what did they find by the way when they went through
[1:52:09.360 --> 1:52:14.480]  these shredded counterfeit ballots and we have tested a ballot that came out of the same facility
[1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:20.320]  and what forensic federally certified forensic eye two of them tested and said it's counterfeit
[1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:23.920]  so that matches the eyewitness testimony yeah it matches the eyewitness testimony and then
[1:52:23.920 --> 1:52:27.440]  when the senate judiciary said hey we're going to see we're going to go inspect all these ballots
[1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:31.760]  a few hours later they backed up enterprise vans trucked them out there's in the next county the
[1:52:31.760 --> 1:52:37.920]  next day a shredding company was contacted and they shredded 3 000 pounds of ballots that all
[1:52:37.920 --> 1:52:42.800]  actually got stopped the law enforcement got involved it ended up in the hands of law enforcement
[1:52:42.800 --> 1:52:47.840]  they were going sifting through it on sunday night and they found not only some unshredded
[1:52:49.440 --> 1:52:54.400]  ballots that i believe will prove to be counterfeit they found a shipping receipt from the chinese
[1:52:54.400 --> 1:53:00.400]  company that counterfeited the ballots so that's about i mean what else do we need we need a hop
[1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:05.920]  out of video well we have videos of people in that count in folton county pulling you know when
[1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:10.720]  the water main broke and they had broke and they had to clear state state farm arena for what turned
[1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:15.520]  out to be a urinal that overflowed they cleared the arena and then people were pulling suitcases of
[1:53:15.520 --> 1:53:20.000]  ballots out those are the counterfeit ballot but you you're a biz man you're a ceo somebody comes to
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:24.880]  you with clearly counterfeit cash it all has the exact same federal number on it would you accept
[1:53:24.880 --> 1:53:29.120]  that no of course not yeah nobody would and you know by the way another kind of example of the two
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:34.240]  standards remember after the rnc the republicans left the white house they got attacked nobody cared

[1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:07.280]  elected leaders over governments but they want businessman technocrats over it and that's who
[1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:12.160]  claus schwaab is you might want to look into the guy that says they've watched the covet 19 lockdowns
[1:55:12.160 --> 1:55:16.160]  to bankrupt you and make you poor you might want to find out who this super villain is
[1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:21.280]  but you see he believes because he's hidden playing you and you're not speaking out against it
[1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:24.720]  that he has the right to do it to you you might want to find out who he works for you he works
[1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:30.400]  directly for prince charles he developed since the 80s the plan for global sustainability

[1:57:09.760 --> 1:57:14.880]  plaza and i'm telling you folks it's not even really like game time yet i mean this is like
[1:57:14.880 --> 1:57:20.160]  if you've ever been to uh you know a major sporting event a playoff football game or
[1:57:20.160 --> 1:57:25.840]  something like that this is like like the tailgate party right now everybody's out everybody's
[1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:30.800]  getting excited everybody's chanting you're getting the the adrenaline revved up you're getting the
[1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:35.600]  momentum revved up you're all excited for the big event that's the feel that you have you can sense
[1:57:35.600 --> 1:57:40.400]  it when you walk outside and i mean even last night the big day isn't till tomorrow but even last
[1:57:40.400 --> 1:57:45.680]  night people were out on the streets i mean it was a little bit obnoxious but uh i salute the
[1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:50.640]  patriot anyway out on the streets from like 10 to midnight on a bullhorn just just bullhorning
[1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:54.880]  about covid being fake bullhorning about how they stole the election so you're trying to sleep maybe
[1:57:54.880 --> 1:58:02.080]  to noise you but uh uh still i mean that's that's that's the midnight ride of paul revere that's
[1:58:02.080 --> 1:58:09.280]  that's the the emergency alert of of just we the people and our voice that has been assured by
[1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:16.400]  the first amendment which of course is uh under attack as well but thomas jefferson once said
[1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:23.520]  when there is tyranny or i should rephrase when the people fear the government there is tyranny
[1:58:23.520 --> 1:58:29.600]  when the government fears the people there is freedom now josh holly said he's not going to
[1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:36.640]  be intimidated by the leftists terrorists the democrat militant wing that showed up at his
[1:58:36.640 --> 1:58:39.760]  house where he wasn't even at his wife was there with their infant child
[1:58:40.880 --> 1:58:48.160]  terrorist threats were made of course no arrests no arrests you're in rick etario and you land on
[1:58:48.160 --> 1:58:52.720]  the ground in dc just you being there warrants an arrest so he gets scooped up
[1:58:52.720 --> 1:58:59.440]  uh if you're oan shroyer and you hold up a sign little piece of paper with your mouth taped in
[1:58:59.440 --> 1:59:03.600]  the dc capital you get arrested you you get to spend the night in a cockroach infested jail but
[1:59:03.600 --> 1:59:11.440]  oh you're a democrat terrorist you're a democrat thug you're a leftist piece of trash and you
[1:59:11.440 --> 1:59:17.200]  get to do whatever the hell you want but we're not going to be intimidated by this scum we never
[1:59:17.200 --> 1:59:26.240]  have been the democrats are crapping their britches right now and so they know what they've done
[1:59:26.240 --> 1:59:32.720]  and they know we're aware to it the difference is they kind of have this this this psychological
[1:59:32.720 --> 1:59:40.000]  paradigm where they just assume that we would activate just like they would and you know trump
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:45.760]  or somebody would would organize terror squads like george soros did to go after nancy plosie and
[1:59:45.760 --> 1:59:51.120]  maxine waters that's never been the case that's not our bag that's not our shtick trump is a
[1:59:51.120 --> 1:59:58.000]  nonviolent we're about the nonaggression principle here at info war so i mean it's never been our
[1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:02.720]  thing it's never been our duty it's never been our agenda to go out and start any physical
[2:00:02.720 --> 2:00:09.360]  confrontations in fact we have to endure it we just turned the other cheek but it just came out
[2:00:09.920 --> 2:00:14.160]  i believe the story was on the hill i'll have to pull it up on my phone here and maybe i will
[2:00:14.160 --> 2:00:23.840]  during the break but it just came out that they're urging the members of congress to use secret tunnels
[2:00:24.480 --> 2:00:30.480]  in dc to get from the state capitol building uh to wherever their final destination is so
[2:00:31.440 --> 2:00:37.040]  if you ever thought that was a conspiracy theory secret tunnels in dc uh i mean i guess you could
[2:00:37.040 --> 2:00:41.120]  go deeper into it and say where they you know traffic kids or whatever for the uh uh what was
[2:00:41.120 --> 2:00:46.240]  the old republican speaker's name the big denis hasher big pedophile there so uh the democrats
[2:00:46.240 --> 2:00:49.920]  are scared they know what they've done they've committed crimes they're scared of we the people
[2:00:49.920 --> 2:00:54.320]  but we're not violent they know that the populist movement that elected president trump four years
[2:00:54.320 --> 2:01:00.400]  ago reelected him by an even bigger landslide rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the
[2:01:00.400 --> 2:01:05.360]  globalist that's why they had to overturn the chessboard that's why they had to engage in naked
[2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:10.960]  election fraud of fun of everyone and as long as we never accept the fraudulent results as long as
[2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:15.600]  we don't let them gaslight us into submission as long as we point out this foreign globalist
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:20.640]  takeover of our country and that all the depression and all of the collapse that's coming is because
[2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:26.240]  of the new world order this will end up fully destroying them in the future if we don't submit
[2:01:26.240 --> 2:01:30.640]  if we submit they'll normalize the communism they'll normalize putting us into a depression
[2:01:30.640 --> 2:01:35.520]  they'll normalize breaking up our families taking our guns we can't let that happen and
[2:01:35.520 --> 2:01:40.880]  info wars is more important than ever so please paul revere's i salute you for your past actions
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:46.160]  keep spreading band off video and info wars dot com and come to the big dc marches on the fifth
[2:01:46.160 --> 2:02:06.960]  and sixth of january i'll see you there god bless
[2:02:06.960 --> 2:02:12.240]  ladies and gentlemen oan stroyer here hosting we are now into the third hour of this historic
[2:02:12.240 --> 2:02:19.040]  alex joneshow what is going to be a historic week in washington dc i was out on the streets
[2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:25.760]  let's see what time it is now um wow it's already two o'clock that's crazy i was out on the streets
[2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:30.960]  at 10 a.m this morning wow time is already flying oh my gosh i don't know what that's indicative of but
[2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:35.280]  i was out on the streets at 10 a.m this morning just to kind of get a feel for things and a vibe
[2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:39.680]  for things now that it's two o'clock i mean the streets are getting kind of packed you're seeing
[2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:45.040]  the trump hats and the scarfs and the flags everywhere um freedom plaza is bumping right now
[2:02:45.040 --> 2:02:50.240]  there's at least 10 000 people there and the people keep flocking uh other people are gathering at
[2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:54.960]  the supreme court building right now where alex is going to give a speech uh but i went out earlier
[2:02:54.960 --> 2:03:00.960]  today at 10 o'clock just kind of get a feel uh walk the field if you will and um well here's what it
[2:03:00.960 --> 2:03:08.880]  looked like oan stroyer here from info wars dot com and we are in freedom plaza washington dc
[2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:16.240]  whereas you can see thousands thousands of patriots have already began to gather
[2:03:16.240 --> 2:03:24.240]  and the event here doesn't even kick off yet for another hour or two more and not only do we have
[2:03:24.240 --> 2:03:31.120]  thousands of people out here already think about this this just shows another example of the total
[2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:39.920]  election fraud for joe biden joe biden had an event in georgia just outside of atlanta and
[2:03:39.920 --> 2:03:48.480]  warlock was there and ossoff was there and there are more people here right now in freedom plaza
[2:03:48.480 --> 2:03:56.080]  than any biden rally and then any democrat georgia runoff for the senate seat rally as well
[2:03:56.080 --> 2:04:02.880]  so where is any of this proof that biden has a record 80 million votes it's not there it wasn't
[2:04:02.880 --> 2:04:10.320]  there during the campaigns of 2020 and it's still not there in 2021 as the fake president elect joe
[2:04:10.320 --> 2:04:16.480]  biden can't even get people to show up for rallies he goes and he does internet speeches
[2:04:16.480 --> 2:04:24.560]  little addresses nobody tunes in i looked at the latest joe biden speech 25 000 views last night
[2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:35.600]  president trump had over 300 000 people tune in to his event online on just right side broadcasting
[2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:42.560]  network alone who as you can see he stayed right up there and will be of course broadcasting
[2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:48.240]  today's events live as well alex jones is going to be speaking here today at freedom plaza as will
[2:04:48.240 --> 2:04:54.640]  i alex jones will also be speaking at the supreme court building tonight uh as well in fact that'll
[2:04:54.640 --> 2:05:00.960]  actually be um around just after noon and then here at freedom plaza tonight myself alex jones
[2:05:00.960 --> 2:05:08.480]  roger stone and a bunch of other surprise speakers but folks this is the third time now
[2:05:08.480 --> 2:05:15.440]  that we've gathered here in dc and we're talking about millions of people showing up joe biden
[2:05:15.440 --> 2:05:22.800]  can't get anyone to show up rafael warlock cannot get anybody to show up john ossoff cannot get
[2:05:22.800 --> 2:05:28.800]  anybody to show up and you heard on the phone call trump says hey look just look at rally
[2:05:28.800 --> 2:05:34.640]  turnout alone look at rally turnout in georgia look at rally turnout in michigan look at rally
[2:05:34.640 --> 2:05:42.960]  turnout in pennsylvania in wisconsin and then compare that to biden rally turnout he didn't
[2:05:42.960 --> 2:05:49.040]  even have rallies folks not even a hundred people would show up most of time it was like 10 but see
[2:05:50.080 --> 2:05:58.080]  we're dealing with republicans who are so afraid of their own shadow and so afraid of the media
[2:05:58.080 --> 2:06:06.160]  that they won't even tell the obvious truth that it was president trump that won in a record landslide
[2:06:06.160 --> 2:06:14.640]  not the fraud of joe biden who they claim had 20 almost 20 million more votes than barack obama
[2:06:14.640 --> 2:06:21.680]  with half the counties a statistical anomaly that is almost impossible but i can tell you
[2:06:21.680 --> 2:06:28.080]  right now to looking at all these patriots gathered out here today being out here last night
[2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:33.440]  being out here this morning walking the streets feeling the energy watching trump speak last night
[2:06:33.440 --> 2:06:39.280]  by the way another huge event for trump americans are ready to fight we're not exactly sure what
[2:06:39.280 --> 2:06:46.080]  that's going to look like perhaps in a couple of weeks if we can't stop this certification
[2:06:46.080 --> 2:06:52.800]  of the fraudulent election of joe biden but we're here in freedom plaza and we're letting the crooks
[2:06:52.800 --> 2:07:00.080]  the crooks the crooks in congress know that we know donald j trump won this election we know we
[2:07:00.080 --> 2:07:06.560]  voted for donald j trump in record fashion and so the crooks in congress better know that we the
[2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:12.560]  people are here and we're loud and we're going to be here all week and they better do their job so
[2:07:12.560 --> 2:07:18.880]  we salute josh hally we salute ted Cruz we salute all the other great republicans for standing up
[2:07:18.880 --> 2:07:25.680]  and doing what is right and stopping the certification of the total fraud the total theft
[2:07:25.680 --> 2:07:30.160]  of the election of joe biden but you know what let's do a little taste test here let's do a little
[2:07:30.160 --> 2:07:35.440]  flavor test let's see how fired up these patriots are out here who here thinks donald j trump won the
[2:07:35.440 --> 2:07:44.640]  election ladies and gentlemen so for info wars dot com we're out here with the american patriots
[2:07:44.640 --> 2:07:50.240]  we are the new revolution we are going to restore and we are going to save the republic
[2:07:50.240 --> 2:07:54.320]  and all these great americans are going to be the ones to do it so for info wars dot com this is
[2:07:54.320 --> 2:08:05.520]  no insurer USA USA so there you go ladies and gentlemen now again that was four hours ago
[2:08:05.520 --> 2:08:13.600]  that was at 10 a.m. this morning when i filed that report so i mean we're talking days really
[2:08:13.600 --> 2:08:17.840]  before the the major event or at least a day before the big event which is tomorrow a lot of
[2:08:17.840 --> 2:08:21.840]  people still coming into dc uh they're reaching out to me they're telling me that that they'll
[2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:28.560]  be getting in tomorrow so today's already big and getting bigger and we'll have the live stream
[2:08:28.560 --> 2:08:33.120]  from freedom plaza later tonight and of course alex jones will be at the supreme court here
[2:08:33.120 --> 2:08:37.920]  probably in about 30 minutes so we'll get that uh it will either live stream that or we'll just
[2:08:37.920 --> 2:08:47.600]  get that archive footage up as soon as possible the real question is the what are the ramifications
[2:08:47.600 --> 2:08:54.640]  of this massive crowd and as i laid out in the video see the problem is we don't live in a land
[2:08:54.640 --> 2:09:01.120]  that sadly occupies common sense and logic or at least uh it's not so common common sense not so
[2:09:01.120 --> 2:09:10.480]  common as they say so it's almost as if we could have 50 million people come to dc i mean we could
[2:09:10.480 --> 2:09:15.680]  have them literally on tape in fact we have them on tape cheating to rig the election it's like oh
[2:09:15.680 --> 2:09:20.320]  you know this just didn't happen but you'd think if we had any common sense and logic they would say
[2:09:20.320 --> 2:09:29.920]  well huh uh donald j trump had record attendance at his rallies in 2020 you've never seen anything
[2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:34.880]  like it 20 000 minimum at an event we didn't get to watch last night in georgia we were flying i
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:39.200]  was able to tune into some of the audio i went back after we got back just to look at the stage
[2:09:39.200 --> 2:09:45.120]  they had set up i mean my god it's like i mean i believe still the biggest music festival in the
[2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:49.520]  world is rock and reo i've been to rock and reo i mean literally this is like it was like one of
[2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:55.840]  the main stages at the the biggest music festivals in the world and you've got thousands of people
[2:09:55.840 --> 2:10:03.200]  that can't even get in so that's trump's energy that's trump support that's that's the numbers
[2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:09.600]  that you see just for the rally showing up for trump that's in georgia biden the the day before
[2:10:10.640 --> 2:10:14.480]  the crew may and i mean you might not even be able to find b-roll of this because they're scrubbing
[2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:20.880]  it off the internet because it's so embarrassing for joe biden i mean you you go look at the youtube
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:25.440]  channels and the twitter accounts and everything that promotes biden and his campaigns nothing
[2:10:25.440 --> 2:10:31.440]  even gets 100 000 views i mean that would be like their biggest day ever if a biden video got 100
[2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:38.560]  000 views and this is with their rigged big tech trump was live in georgia last night and i was
[2:10:38.560 --> 2:10:47.840]  only looking at the right side broadcasting feed they had for the entire time at least 250 000 people
[2:10:48.560 --> 2:10:53.040]  tuned in i don't have the monitors in front of me because we're on the road here but but i would
[2:10:53.040 --> 2:10:57.600]  be willing to guess that last night's event in georgia on right side broadcasting probably is up
[2:10:57.600 --> 2:11:04.000]  to at least a half a million maybe even a million views so trump has an event 50 000 people show up
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:09.360]  a million people watch online biden has an event and again you can do the side-by-side analysis
[2:11:10.080 --> 2:11:16.240]  i mean it's like any anything else i mean the tail of the tape as they call it you look at the
[2:11:16.240 --> 2:11:23.200]  tail of the tape biden doesn't have a single category in which he has an advantage not a
[2:11:23.200 --> 2:11:29.040]  single category so biden has an event in georgia 100 people show up trump has an event
[2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:36.880]  20 000 minimum show up biden's live stream 10 000 watch trump's live stream a quarter of a million
[2:11:36.880 --> 2:11:47.840]  watch so that's the difference was that a two or was that a oh okay oh two million sorry i'm

[2:17:03.280 --> 2:17:08.640]  stages getting the permits this was a measurement that we had to make we had to make some decisions
[2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:15.600]  and and then this is the the new battlefront this is uh the new place where our energy uh has to go
[2:17:15.600 --> 2:17:20.880]  is is being a leader not only here vocally on the airwaves every day which is important but also
[2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:25.200]  getting into the streets organizing events and taking that leadership role

[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:56.000]  for five years i've been taking supplements for man almost 15 years now i'm just going back i started
[2:17:56.000 --> 2:17:59.920]  i remember when i started playing high school sports is when i started uh looking into supplementation
[2:17:59.920 --> 2:18:07.920]  and and and supplements probably even really before that but it is not even close as someone who's
[2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:13.040]  been taking supplements for half of his life somebody who's very into health and and fitness
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:20.160]  the info war supplements are bar none for what we have the best available whether it's the bodies
[2:18:20.160 --> 2:18:26.560]  with the pure turmeric i'm not even i'm i'm not a guy that's into like a male enhancement isn't
[2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:32.160]  the right word for super male vitality but i'm not the guy that needs like an extra energy boost
[2:18:32.160 --> 2:18:37.120]  or you know anything like that i i take the super male vitality because it has great ingredients in
[2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:41.920]  there um that are that are just good for your health and good for your energy but man i mean
[2:18:42.560 --> 2:18:46.560]  sometimes i got to just like back off of it a little bit i mean super male vitality is the
[2:18:46.560 --> 2:18:52.240]  real deal i mean the list just goes on and on the fish oils people are really into oils we have
[2:18:52.240 --> 2:18:56.960]  fish oil we have krill oil we have different options of what you want to take so i'm telling you from
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:00.880]  somebody who's been taking supplements almost his whole life uh that the supplements in info
[2:19:00.880 --> 2:19:08.560]  war store dot com are the best and not only we make the nexus of best quality and best price
[2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:15.360]  so that's what we do at info war store dot com now you only have hours left to get the best price

[2:19:26.800 --> 2:19:30.720]  everything is kind of in balance right now so if you haven't made that emergency food purchase
[2:19:30.720 --> 2:19:35.520]  now is the time at preparewithalex.com now speaking of alex jones on his way to the supreme court
[2:19:35.520 --> 2:19:39.360]  he has joined us right now over the phone alex what are you seeing out there
[2:19:42.160 --> 2:19:48.880]  well he's but the only way the covet hooks is completely broken is if you get that truth
[2:19:48.880 --> 2:19:55.120]  and if you get that information and you get that out big tech is trying to suppress you
[2:19:55.120 --> 2:20:00.640]  big tech is trying to block you big tech is trying to keep you from communicating with each other
[2:20:00.640 --> 2:20:05.920]  so you do it by word of mouth and by email and by calling in to talk radio and you do it by
[2:20:05.920 --> 2:20:12.560]  speaking up at church and you do it by printing out the facts and you never surrender because
[2:20:12.560 --> 2:20:18.800]  every mind you touch every person you awaken is millions of people we're gonna save because
[2:20:18.800 --> 2:20:24.400]  the globalists admit a shutdown for another six months in the west will kill tens of millions
[2:20:24.400 --> 2:20:31.040]  of the third world when the first world collapses the third world dies and this is a giant attempt
[2:20:31.040 --> 2:20:36.880]  at killing civilization and a mass abortion of children that are already born who are the main
[2:20:36.880 --> 2:20:45.040]  victims of malnutrition and starvation so never forget when the left tells you where a mask have
[2:20:45.040 --> 2:20:52.400]  have you know have courage stand up be respectful that's a sign of your slavery that is a sign of
[2:20:52.400 --> 2:20:59.440]  your medical sharia law and tyranny and you must declare independence against the fear now
[2:21:04.400 --> 2:21:09.120]  now i know roger stones he checked in the same hotel design is on his way down here to give you
[2:21:09.120 --> 2:21:14.880]  a powerful speech and then later tonight down in freedom plaza but i love you all and i appreciate
[2:21:14.880 --> 2:21:21.600]  you all and i just want you to know that you are the answer to tyranny you are the answer you are
[2:21:21.600 --> 2:21:37.520]  1776 all right guys let's give it up for alex jones my name is matt shannon up next we have
[2:21:37.520 --> 2:21:44.000]  okay so uh here you go that was i guess the tail end of alex jones speaking there at the supreme
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:50.480]  court man he moves fast wow that's amazing that they or maybe i'm just in like some weird time warp
[2:21:50.480 --> 2:21:53.760]  here where time is just flying in my own head but it was actually a long time i think that's
[2:21:53.760 --> 2:22:01.920]  probably the case um but you know he's talking about the fake pandemic you know it's really just at
[2:22:01.920 --> 2:22:09.520]  this point so absurd and it's it's kind of a weird thing to reflect back onto 2020 because it's almost
[2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:14.640]  like it didn't happen it was the long it was for many of you for many of us you could say wow 2020
[2:22:14.640 --> 2:22:20.000]  was the longest year of my life but it's like now that it's over it feels like either it never happened
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:24.960]  or we're still in it like we're still in the extra innings we're still in the overtime of 2020 we
[2:22:24.960 --> 2:22:29.680]  really haven't actually made that leap to get out of this and that is the fake pandemic i mean that's
[2:22:29.680 --> 2:22:34.000]  that's the big thing that's holding us back keeping us in shackles keeping us locked down
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:41.520]  destroying our economy and the only way it it ends there's only two ways it goes either we decide
[2:22:41.520 --> 2:22:45.840]  we're done with it which many of us decided months ago here at info wars that was pretty much our
[2:22:45.840 --> 2:22:49.520]  moniker back in march there were some there was some waiting period there we weren't really sure
[2:22:49.520 --> 2:22:54.240]  what's gonna happen we had the guests on okay but then you know hey look we still live in reality
[2:22:54.240 --> 2:22:58.400]  and after a month of it not being what they said it was gonna be with three million dead and you
[2:22:58.400 --> 2:23:04.800]  know all the rest of it and we still went to events still flying you know never wearing a mask or
[2:23:04.800 --> 2:23:09.280]  gloves or anything so that's when it was like okay no doubt this is a whole big hoax yeah there's
[2:23:09.280 --> 2:23:13.920]  probably a virus now they're admitting it came out of the wuhan lab we broke that first as well
[2:23:14.800 --> 2:23:21.040]  so but there's only two ways either we say we're done with this and and for the most part that's
[2:23:21.040 --> 2:23:29.360]  going to have to be on the businesses of america because we're really seeing the full force of the
[2:23:29.360 --> 2:23:35.680]  corporate government is really what we're seeing and all the mom and pop restaurants are struggling
[2:23:35.680 --> 2:23:40.080]  or going out of business all the mom and pop shops are struggling and are going out of business
[2:23:40.080 --> 2:23:44.240]  but the big chain restaurants are doing fine uh the big people that work with amazon and
[2:23:44.240 --> 2:23:49.600]  microsoft are doing fine the big big box stores like walmart and casco they're all doing fine
[2:23:49.600 --> 2:23:54.320]  so so it's it's killing all the mom and pop shops but it just shows the power of the corporate
[2:23:54.320 --> 2:24:00.000]  government we're now so much for the free market you don't have a choice but to go to jeff bezos you
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:03.200]  don't have a choice but to go to bill gates you don't have a choice but to go to walmart or you
[2:24:03.200 --> 2:24:07.520]  name it whoever it is and that's because the corporate government has locked all these other
[2:24:07.520 --> 2:24:14.080]  businesses down by design uh as a cause and effect to just basically have um you know it's not
[2:24:14.080 --> 2:24:18.240]  necessarily a monopoly but it might as well be a monopoly i mean it's the same it's the same
[2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:24.080]  executive power that a monopoly would have and they're all working together anyway so we the people
[2:24:24.080 --> 2:24:28.720]  you know i don't know what what we the people can do when the corporate government says no
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:32.960]  we're not even open for business but it's two ways either we the people decide which is gonna
[2:24:32.960 --> 2:24:38.320]  have to be led by business owners or you're never coming out of this you're never coming out of the
[2:24:38.320 --> 2:24:44.320]  covid pandemic it'll be covid 20 it'll be covid 22 25 you know covid 50 till the day you die
[2:24:44.320 --> 2:24:54.080]  and that's it so either covid is now your master the word apocalypse means the revealing of what
[2:24:54.080 --> 2:25:03.600]  was once hidden and now that all the lies are being revealed what will you do we know that
[2:25:03.600 --> 2:25:11.440]  millions will do absolutely nothing they will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a virtue
[2:25:11.440 --> 2:25:20.000]  it is the patriots of the world versus everybody else i do solemnly swear that i will support and
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:27.680]  defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic that i will

[2:25:57.440 --> 2:26:02.000]  and discrediting the globalist that's why they had to overturn the chess board that's why they had
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:07.680]  to engage in naked election fraud in front of everyone and as long as we never accept the frauds
[2:26:07.680 --> 2:26:12.320]  aren't results as long as we don't let them gaslight us into submission as long as we point out this

[2:26:17.040 --> 2:26:22.640]  that's coming is because of the new world order this will end up fully destroying them in the
[2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:27.520]  future if we don't submit if we submit they'll normalize the communism they'll normalize putting
[2:26:27.520 --> 2:26:32.880]  us into a depression they'll normalize breaking up our families taking our guns we can't let that

[2:27:52.560 --> 2:28:17.600]  listening to the alex jones show is it mission impossible is it mission impossible to get
[2:28:17.600 --> 2:28:25.520]  donald j trump into the white house for four more years well no it's not mission impossible
[2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:33.280]  actually we've already done it the mission impossible task is to somehow as we the people
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:41.200]  overcome the corporate mainstream media lying to us gaslighting us manipulating us all day long
[2:28:41.200 --> 2:28:48.160]  overcome the corporate world government that wants to be in total control of all consumer
[2:28:48.160 --> 2:29:00.240]  activity all economic activity and somehow some way convincing those fellow humans that
[2:29:00.240 --> 2:29:08.160]  have been turned into mindless sheeple zombies somehow some way getting them to understand
[2:29:08.160 --> 2:29:13.200]  how they've been duped how they've been deceived and not even necessarily agreeing with us and
[2:29:13.200 --> 2:29:19.360]  everything that'll never happen but at least seeing the world for what it is but you wonder
[2:29:20.560 --> 2:29:28.160]  is something like that possible when you have nancy polosi banning the words in congress
[2:29:28.960 --> 2:29:33.120]  and and not only banning the words to be used in congress or official legislation you can't use
[2:29:33.120 --> 2:29:39.040]  mother you can't use father look i remember tuning into alex jones for the first time probably about
[2:29:39.040 --> 2:29:45.360]  10 years ago not even i think it was 2013 or so and it was really to just get information on an
[2:29:45.360 --> 2:29:48.560]  event that was happening at the time the boss marathon bombing but you know i i continue to
[2:29:48.560 --> 2:29:54.800]  listen and a lot gets covered on the jones show and he would say how eventually you're gonna see
[2:29:55.360 --> 2:30:01.360]  members of congress people in the media academia lawyers all and it's all from the left it's all
[2:30:01.360 --> 2:30:04.400]  from the liberal left they're not liberals at all they're they're i mean i don't even know
[2:30:04.400 --> 2:30:08.800]  what you would call them at this point dumbasses probably the best word for it but mindless sheeple
[2:30:08.800 --> 2:30:16.320]  zombies where they would go to ban they would move to ban the terms mother and father now you
[2:30:16.320 --> 2:30:21.360]  hear that and it just kind of goes one ear now at the other you either oh he's crazy or okay here's
[2:30:21.360 --> 2:30:24.240]  a guy on air covering all these things but you know what i don't really agree with that so i'm
[2:30:24.240 --> 2:30:29.760]  not going to think about it much well now here you are in the year 2020 and nancy polosi has officially
[2:30:29.760 --> 2:30:36.320]  filed legislation which you know what i just realized is actually illegal legislation so nancy
[2:30:36.320 --> 2:30:43.040]  polosi actually broke her own law by banning the word mother so she says you can't use the word
[2:30:43.040 --> 2:30:47.920]  mother or or mother-in-law or brother-in-law or brother or father or any that but then she uses it
[2:30:48.560 --> 2:30:52.400]  then she actually uses it in her legislation of course it's all this it's all a big game it's all a
[2:30:52.400 --> 2:31:00.000]  big joke and you have to wonder too who puts nancy polosi up to this did nancy polosi come with this
[2:31:00.000 --> 2:31:05.600]  up come up with this on her own i doubt it she's been in congress for what 500 years and now all
[2:31:05.600 --> 2:31:11.520]  of a sudden she wants to ban mother and father but you know what see the problem is republicans
[2:31:11.520 --> 2:31:16.400]  don't like to they just don't even fight they just just sit around and they like all the glory and
[2:31:16.400 --> 2:31:22.080]  everything the prestige and being on tv and they get there oh they have their office huh you know uh
[2:31:22.080 --> 2:31:29.680]  the republican should write legislation and then have the word mom and dad or like mama and papa
[2:31:29.680 --> 2:31:34.080]  like you know elizabeth warned my mama and papa like oh yeah like you can relate to her i'm gonna
[2:31:34.080 --> 2:31:40.560]  have me a beer oh so that's where they should granddaddy like just throw in the words but just
[2:31:40.560 --> 2:31:44.480]  then aren't mother and father or brother-in-law so it's just like oh okay you banned those words
[2:31:44.480 --> 2:31:49.920]  the language police over here trying to rewrite our lexicon trying to cancel the dictionary okay
[2:31:49.920 --> 2:31:54.880]  we'll just use mama and papa you know we'll just use daddy and mommy and stuff like that oh but
[2:31:54.880 --> 2:31:58.880]  then they'll say no you have to ban that too but you you would you would hear somebody say that on
[2:31:58.880 --> 2:32:04.640]  the air 10 years ago you think that person's nuts now here we are it doesn't stop with mother and
[2:32:04.640 --> 2:32:11.440]  father but again how do you convince people that want to ban terms like mother and father
[2:32:11.440 --> 2:32:18.480]  mother how do you convince someone that that's that gone that intellectually dead how do you
[2:32:18.480 --> 2:32:22.800]  convince them to live in reality with you again is it even possible what do you do when you have
[2:32:23.680 --> 2:32:32.800]  members of congress who go on the congressional floor and say that the word amen is sexist amen
[2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:38.880]  i've had other people say oh amen means this amen means that i don't really care amen means amen
[2:32:38.880 --> 2:32:46.000]  and now they say oh no amen means a woman too and so you have to say a woman and so they finish
[2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:54.000]  their speech they say amen and a woman a made-up word a made-up word it doesn't even exist but see
[2:32:54.000 --> 2:33:00.000]  oh you have to be inclusive well what about all the other genders what about a unicorn what about
[2:33:00.000 --> 2:33:06.400]  a two-spirit gender queer what about a queer i mean so where does it end where does it stop there is
[2:33:06.400 --> 2:33:16.240]  no method to the madness it's just total idiocy and so what do you do when you are dealing with people
[2:33:16.240 --> 2:33:23.360]  that are that gone they have a mask mandate is it going to be a mask woman date too i mean let's
[2:33:23.360 --> 2:33:28.480]  be fully inclusive here we need a mask woman date well what does that mean well it means i'm
[2:33:29.200 --> 2:33:36.320]  i'm inclusive don't you know i'm woke i said mask woman date and you can go on and on and on with
[2:33:36.320 --> 2:33:40.880]  the words that either have man in them just by chance just because it happens to be in a word
[2:33:40.880 --> 2:33:47.280]  they say oh that's sexist so that's what we're dealing with the good news is we do outnumber
[2:33:47.280 --> 2:33:53.040]  them we are the majority the bad news is we don't like to make our voices heard we like to live our
[2:33:53.040 --> 2:33:57.360]  own lives we like to have our families have our businesses and just kind of stay out of other
[2:33:57.360 --> 2:34:02.880]  people's way you stay out of my way i stay out of your way it's the live and let live approach to
[2:34:02.880 --> 2:34:09.360]  life live and let live well the left is no longer live and let live the left is live my way or i'm
[2:34:09.360 --> 2:34:15.040]  going to kill you and so that's where they're going oh it's a it's a mask mandate no that's
[2:34:15.040 --> 2:34:21.440]  sexist it's a mask woman date and then they have celebratory articles where they say look
[2:34:23.040 --> 2:34:28.160]  you know we just selected a gay person look we just selected a black person look we just
[2:34:28.160 --> 2:34:33.760]  selected this we elected that well you are the ones that focus on race you are the ones that
[2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:41.120]  focus on gender you're in a state of depression when it comes to your intellectual capacity it's
[2:34:41.120 --> 2:34:48.320]  it's decreasing in its um in its capacity here and so you you see them start you're not you
[2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:53.520]  don't go around i mean i'm 30 years old i never thought about race as a kid went to school with
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:58.880]  black people white people brown people asian nobody it never came to my mind to think about their skin
[2:34:58.880 --> 2:35:04.960]  color and it meant anything uh it never came to my mind that oh you know i need to watch myself
[2:35:04.960 --> 2:35:10.720]  around women or i need to you know do this around women because oh that you know i've been a bad guy
[2:35:10.720 --> 2:35:15.280]  you know what can i do just to be just to make up for it because women have had it so hard in life
[2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:21.120]  oh they've had it so but see but now what are you seeing women are actually and it's always in the
[2:35:21.120 --> 2:35:26.960]  conservative aisle it seems women are going back to the gender roles women are going back to wanting
[2:35:26.960 --> 2:35:35.440]  to be mothers back to wanting to be uh housekeepers and of course of course i mean you get into the
[2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:40.720]  real world as a woman and and and quite frankly there's just not many women that can really handle
[2:35:40.720 --> 2:35:44.960]  it they're not meant to they're not meant to handle those stresses they're not meant to make those
[2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:51.600]  big stressful decisions uh they're meant to care for the children they're meant to to care and raise
[2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:57.680]  the family keep everything on an even keel uh in a way yeah keep keep the man on an even keel keep
[2:35:57.680 --> 2:36:04.000]  you know keep him focused in line oh but see you get rid of the gender roles first and then gender
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:10.640]  doesn't matter so you get rid of gender now this has been a long pontification that is almost irrelevant
[2:36:10.640 --> 2:36:16.480]  to any of the main stories today but the point is this is where it's going this has all been by design
[2:36:17.600 --> 2:36:23.440]  and the proof is in the pudding when Nancy Pelosi is banning words mother and father from being in
[2:36:23.440 --> 2:36:31.200]  congressional legislation or uh congressional talk mother and father because they want you to
[2:36:31.200 --> 2:36:38.480]  believe there's actually 500 genders or unlimited genders in fact i'm a lamp i declare myself a lamp
[2:36:38.480 --> 2:36:46.640]  and so i am now a lamp and i because i'm a lamp i cannot get covid so i don't need to wear a mask
[2:36:46.640 --> 2:36:53.200]  and so that's where the liberal logic actually shows that it's not even logic it's all a political
[2:36:53.200 --> 2:37:01.120]  agenda president trump should declare himself a black woman tomorrow just say hey i'm a black woman
[2:37:01.120 --> 2:37:06.080]  i'm the first black female president and they say well no you're not well why who says who are you
[2:37:06.080 --> 2:37:11.440]  to say what trump is and trump's not i'm a black woman i declare myself a black woman oh okay you're
[2:37:11.440 --> 2:37:18.800]  a black woman oh wait no see only if you're a liberal that pushes the liberal agenda hates america
[2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:25.200]  want to see the individual rights ended want to see individualism uh and individuals being
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:30.480]  empowered ended and you want to make it all about this ugly group collective uh in the image of satan
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:35.520]  then yeah then you can say oh i'm a man i'm a woman i'm a unicorn i'm a ghost i'm whatever
[2:37:35.520 --> 2:37:39.680]  but no if you're actually logical and you would never actually change genders well then
[2:37:39.680 --> 2:37:43.520]  you're not allowed to do it so but i'm serious because we get trump should come out tomorrow
[2:37:43.520 --> 2:37:47.680]  and declare himself a black woman so that he can be the black first black female president before
[2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:50.960]  kamala herd the best product i'm not i'm not supposed to be biased but i'm gonna tell you all now

[2:38:48.800 --> 2:38:54.320]  are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare the united nations the big corporations
[2:38:54.320 --> 2:38:58.960]  the globalist big tech and big farmer all pushing the cub is the most deadly thing in history even
[2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:04.720]  though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold but if you are deficient then you can actually
[2:39:04.720 --> 2:39:09.680]  die from it that's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing homes meanwhile all these top
[2:39:09.680 --> 2:39:14.480]  scientists and and and researchers and former phyzer head medical officers have come out and said
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:19.920]  that the covid-19 vaccine especially mRNA ones are basically bioweapons that are super deadly
[2:39:19.920 --> 2:39:24.880]  and now they're having to resuscitate people that die basically when they take it just like newborn
[2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:29.360]  babies they give vaccines they have to resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they slowly die
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:35.120]  and that's on the record it does that guillomare's narcolepsy cancer all these other diseases but
[2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:38.800]  they tell you save and effective no one's getting hurt it's a conspiracy theory and then all the
[2:39:38.800 --> 2:39:43.680]  fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly so they run from something that isn't dangerous
[2:39:43.680 --> 2:39:47.440]  towards something that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe they do it
[2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:54.480]  the populist movement that elected president trump four years ago reelected him by an even
[2:39:54.480 --> 2:40:00.160]  bigger landslide rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the globalist that's why they had
[2:40:00.160 --> 2:40:05.200]  to overturn the chessboard that's why they had to engage in naked election fraud in front of everyone
[2:40:05.200 --> 2:40:10.560]  and as long as we never accept the fraudulent results as long as we don't let them gaslight us
[2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:15.040]  into submission as long as we point out this so foreign globalist takeover of our country and
[2:40:15.040 --> 2:40:19.920]  that all the depression and all of the collapse that's coming is because of the new world order
[2:40:19.920 --> 2:40:25.360]  this will end up fully destroying them in the future if we don't submit if we submit they'll
[2:40:25.360 --> 2:40:30.000]  normalize the communism they'll normalize putting us into a depression they'll normalize breaking up
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  our families taking our guns we can't let that happen and info wars is more important than ever

[2:43:15.760 --> 2:43:19.680]  court crowd is maybe a couple thousand yeah okay all right so we're just getting all this intel again
[2:43:19.680 --> 2:43:25.040]  you you got to catch um not all but some most of alex jones speech there at the supreme court
[2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:29.120]  we're going to put the full video up on band dot video here shortly i imagine that's why some of
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:34.640]  the crew just got back to upload uh that video of course uh roger stone is here as well he's
[2:43:34.640 --> 2:43:40.400]  going to be speaking at freedom plaza tonight as well as alex jones and uh myself and other great
[2:43:40.400 --> 2:43:47.040]  special yes but you know for somebody like me alex described it earlier as being an empath
[2:43:47.040 --> 2:43:50.560]  maybe that's the right description i don't know but i've always been the same way
[2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:55.920]  i mean going to uh sporting events as a kid specifically basketball games for whatever reason
[2:43:55.920 --> 2:44:00.640]  i just i love the roar of the crowd i don't i didn't even care about what team if the crowd roared
[2:44:00.640 --> 2:44:05.520]  i would be like three years old i'd like jump out of my seat and go crazy uh it was just something
[2:44:05.520 --> 2:44:13.600]  about that and that that dynamic is here in dc uh right now and many people that probably have
[2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:20.400]  never really gotten politically involved or maybe even a year two five years ago didn't even really
[2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:27.440]  think about politics or getting involved uh are now in the front lines literally roaring uh to save
[2:44:27.440 --> 2:44:32.400]  america and it's really not even political you know this is really not even a political thing this is
[2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:40.720]  about standing for what's right and on kind of a deeper understanding intellectual level
[2:44:40.720 --> 2:44:48.800]  people standing up for america but but really it's values you know if if it was if russia was
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:52.480]  really some big bogeyman we had to worry about but you know you you look at russia and it's like
[2:44:52.480 --> 2:45:01.280]  wow booming free market booming industry booming with new technology uh low taxes strong individual
[2:45:01.280 --> 2:45:04.720]  empowerment and they were like hey you know we're going to interface with you or we're going to
[2:45:04.720 --> 2:45:09.520]  you know change your system entirely you say okay well you know what you you're about individual
[2:45:09.520 --> 2:45:13.600]  liberties you want to get rid of corruption you want small government self-government okay like okay
[2:45:13.600 --> 2:45:19.600]  that's not what we're dealing with america is that america is the idea is the country of small
[2:45:19.600 --> 2:45:27.760]  government really not even small government self-government self-government and to just really
[2:45:28.720 --> 2:45:37.040]  exhibit how much of a fraud a modern-day liberal is a leftist you ask them i mean every every
[2:45:37.040 --> 2:45:43.760]  which angle you investigate a modern-day liberal leftist in there are just a complete phony fraud
[2:45:43.760 --> 2:45:47.840]  you would ask do you believe in self-government every single one of them would say yes but oh you
[2:45:47.840 --> 2:45:55.200]  wear a mask oh you shut down your business oh you don't get an election oh give all your money to
[2:45:55.200 --> 2:46:01.840]  black lives matter improve you're not racist well that's not self-government oh oh raise your taxes
[2:46:01.840 --> 2:46:06.720]  so we can bring communism and socialism in well that's not self-government so again total phonies
[2:46:06.720 --> 2:46:12.000]  my body my choice oh i get to kill a baby that doesn't even see here again it's just total
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:19.200]  disingenuousness it's not even your body again you try to bring this topic to to a leftist phony
[2:46:19.200 --> 2:46:26.800]  you say how many hearts does a human being have how many beating hearts uh one hmm how many beating
[2:46:26.800 --> 2:46:34.320]  hearts are there uh in a woman's body for an abortion well there's two oh okay so that would be
[2:46:34.320 --> 2:46:40.000]  two bodies so it's not even your body your choice now there's certain extenuating circumstances
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:45.440]  i'm not here to get into the gray area the point is oh your body your choice oh that's until they
[2:46:45.440 --> 2:46:51.120]  want to force you to take a vaccine oh that's before they want to force you to wear a mask
[2:46:51.120 --> 2:46:56.880]  which is literally your body so it should be your choice but again these are complete lying
[2:46:56.880 --> 2:47:02.000]  phonies that we're dealing with and perhaps our biggest obstacle of all sadly because if we could
[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:09.440]  all unite together just in common sense and logic man we could overthrow this corrupt system in a day
[2:47:10.240 --> 2:47:15.040]  we could identify the phonies we could identify the criminals and if we had that will and motivation
[2:47:15.040 --> 2:47:20.800]  united to do it it'd be game over man it'd be the easiest thing in the world to do the problem is
[2:47:21.440 --> 2:47:25.920]  we're dealing with these people that have been totally brainwashed in the psychological operations
[2:47:26.480 --> 2:47:30.400]  and the two big ones they're running right now are obviously the fake pandemic
[2:47:30.400 --> 2:47:37.040]  and the fake election of joe biden but i could understand oh it's tough to understand how they
[2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:40.800]  steal elections or it's tough to know what to believe and what not to believe if you haven't
[2:47:40.800 --> 2:47:44.560]  been around and and you kind of got to do your own digging and look into the own evidence and kind
[2:47:44.560 --> 2:47:50.080]  of form your own conclusions but with the covid fake pandemic i mean this is this is cut and dry
[2:47:50.080 --> 2:47:56.080]  at this point and so again that's just what shows you you have a thirst for knowledge
[2:47:56.080 --> 2:48:02.720]  knowledge you have an itch for reality you have common sense you have logic and you approach
[2:48:02.720 --> 2:48:08.480]  your life in that manner these people have abandoned logic they've abandoned common sense they
[2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:13.280]  honestly they've just abandoned general just goodness just righteousness they've just totally
[2:48:13.280 --> 2:48:18.400]  abandoned and again you look at the death counts for covid or not even for covid but
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:23.360]  even for covid it's just a bad flu season but you look at the death count in the united states
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:35.600]  and it's not up it's not up and so it's frustrating because it's like well do i do i cover the
[2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:43.040]  steal of the election for joe biden which is extremely dangerous for our country do i cover
[2:48:43.040 --> 2:48:48.720]  the fake pandemic i mean think about this you have a global corporate government
[2:48:48.720 --> 2:48:58.000]  that is allied with the most corrupt politicians in the world to fake a pandemic to bring in the
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:04.320]  greek the great reset with the un slogan of build back better so they're telling you we're
[2:49:04.320 --> 2:49:09.520]  going to destroy the world you're going to have to just sit there and take it and you know maybe
[2:49:09.520 --> 2:49:13.840]  you'll survive maybe not but that's that doesn't matter to them they're going to build it back
[2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:20.080]  better and it's all about them in their righteous approach oh the world is broken
[2:49:20.080 --> 2:49:26.480]  oh the world is corrupt and it's your fault it's your fault not all the spying with the technology
[2:49:26.480 --> 2:49:33.120]  that bill gates was given by the secret societies years ago stolen intellectual property and then
[2:49:33.120 --> 2:49:39.760]  mark zuckerberg doing the same thing no they know their frauds they know their phonies
[2:49:39.760 --> 2:49:45.680]  but so you have to sacrifice you might not make it well it's the great reset the world is corrupt
[2:49:45.680 --> 2:49:51.520]  the world is bad it's your fault no it's your fault bill gates no it's your fault george
[2:49:51.520 --> 2:49:58.400]  soros no it's your fault anthony fauci which is just another point you know the libs actually
[2:49:58.400 --> 2:50:04.480]  hated fauci uh during the age pandemic because he was a dirtbag then dirtbag then he's a dirtbag
[2:50:04.480 --> 2:50:11.200]  now he works for big pharma he's a henchman for big pharma again the left used to be against
[2:50:11.200 --> 2:50:17.120]  big pharma i remember going around in 2016 because it was it was kind of a big deal at the time
[2:50:18.400 --> 2:50:26.800]  trump did not take a single dollar in donations for many big pharmaceutical companies now i remember
[2:50:26.800 --> 2:50:32.480]  bernie sanders was against big pharma at the time but even he had to admit yes i've i've taken
[2:50:32.480 --> 2:50:36.560]  campaign donations from big pharma pharmaceutical companies and and he just rationalized it by
[2:50:36.560 --> 2:50:40.640]  saying i need to get into office so you know this money will help so so we'll take it assuming you
[2:50:40.640 --> 2:50:45.600]  believe he's not going to sell out if they ever come bidding but the point is he talks about how
[2:50:45.600 --> 2:50:50.240]  bad big pharma was and remember bernie sanders actually won the nomination in 2016 they stole
[2:50:50.240 --> 2:50:54.080]  up from him gave it to hillary but i would go around and i talked to bernie supporters they
[2:50:54.080 --> 2:50:58.880]  were everywhere i said oh you're anti big pharma they say yeah i said how much money did bernie
[2:50:58.880 --> 2:51:03.120]  sanders take from big pharma they say zero so well that's not accurate here's here's the actual
[2:51:03.120 --> 2:51:09.120]  open secrets it shows you it's ff fec filings you have to file it and trump took zero dollars
[2:51:09.120 --> 2:51:13.600]  from big pharma but now it's fouchy coming around promoting the vaccine with gates because they
[2:51:13.600 --> 2:51:18.080]  don't have the president to do it but if biden got in he'd be the president alex jones uh we're
[2:51:18.080 --> 2:51:22.560]  gonna get his mic potted up here uh and alex jones is with us now i just want to say the
[2:51:22.560 --> 2:51:27.200]  crew's doing an incredible job and you're doing an incredible job there's national guard out there
[2:51:27.200 --> 2:51:30.960]  again they don't come up for black lives matter they don't come up for andy from burning police
[2:51:30.960 --> 2:51:35.680]  agents killing people and the left said oh don't call national guard that's fascist mostly peaceful
[2:51:35.680 --> 2:51:39.920]  demonstrations run against the national guard we're just going to show that the left loves the
[2:51:39.920 --> 2:51:44.000]  military when it's under their control so i'm going to go out for you and do a live feed if you
[2:51:44.000 --> 2:51:48.720]  keep hosting uh into the war room that's about to start uh and papper will be there too but i'm
[2:51:48.720 --> 2:51:53.920]  going to go give you a live feed from the street uh of the national guard as people are just pouring
[2:51:53.920 --> 2:51:57.680]  into dc there's just crowds coming in it's like when i saw that big women's march it was over a
[2:51:57.680 --> 2:52:01.840]  million people that soros paid four four years ago the day after trump's inauguration it looks
[2:52:01.840 --> 2:52:05.920]  like that just they're flooding in we're just driving around the city it's it's totally insane
[2:52:05.920 --> 2:52:09.200]  well we've got like two minutes left here uh but real quickly alex it's that's actually
[2:52:09.200 --> 2:52:13.360]  exactly what i was talking about the left oh they're anti big pharma until they want you to
[2:52:13.360 --> 2:52:17.360]  take the vaccine oh they're anti military and they don't want you to be thrown into war until
[2:52:17.360 --> 2:52:21.680]  they want wars well they're anti slavery until they run death camps in china yeah whatever's bad
[2:52:21.680 --> 2:52:26.960]  they're the worst and study show the left is six seven eight nine times the thing i'll study
[2:52:26.960 --> 2:52:31.200]  less lucky to give a charity more likely to steal but they're way more likely to virtually single and
[2:52:31.200 --> 2:52:37.440]  told you all they did hey the war rooms coming up info wars dot com for my show and our video keep
[2:52:37.440 --> 2:52:42.400]  these live mountain patriot in colorado thank you for holding hey man how you doing alex
[2:52:42.960 --> 2:52:46.320]  man i'm just working as hard as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you
[2:52:46.320 --> 2:52:52.080]  i love you man i want to uh make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've been using it
[2:52:52.080 --> 2:52:56.480]  quite a while and i just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see
[2:52:56.480 --> 2:53:03.520]  that it contains quercetin which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited
[2:53:04.240 --> 2:53:11.280]  is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so
[2:53:11.280 --> 2:53:17.280]  people might want to take a look at that all i know is with dna force we went out and looked
[2:53:17.280 --> 2:53:22.240]  at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the
[2:53:22.240 --> 2:53:25.760]  doctor itself like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product in them it's
[2:53:25.760 --> 2:53:30.960]  really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together
[2:53:30.960 --> 2:53:42.480]  and that's what produced this so thanks thanks for the plug the post industrial world that's
[2:53:42.480 --> 2:53:50.560]  what george herbert walker bush signed on to at the rio de Janeiro agenda 21 conference back in 1992
[2:53:51.440 --> 2:53:58.000]  now they've launched agenda 2030 which is a post industrial world plow schwa with the debos group
[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:04.080]  trudeau the prime minister of canada they're all on record saying the great reset is agenda 2030
[2:54:04.720 --> 2:54:10.560]  well you might want to find out what agenda 2030 is it is the destruction of society as we
[2:54:10.560 --> 2:54:15.440]  know it it is making the population more by designs we can be controlled with a medical

[2:55:23.680 --> 2:55:31.440]  voices in the street and the sound of running feet and they whisper the word revolution
[2:55:31.440 --> 2:55:42.880]  there are men coming down from the valleys there are tall ships flying off the coast
[2:55:44.960 --> 2:55:52.880]  and they carry the light in the dark of the night like a whisper in the wind
[2:55:52.880 --> 2:56:01.200]  and the tyrants bring my god no they've never been able to defeat him in spirit they always get
[2:56:01.200 --> 2:56:07.360]  in control for a while but that's why they want to domesticate us make us weak make us stupid
[2:56:07.360 --> 2:56:11.200]  take us off the land turn us into slaves get rid of men get rid of families but
[2:56:11.920 --> 2:56:17.360]  their great triumph will end up being their great defeat there are just mobs of people all over the

[2:56:48.240 --> 2:56:53.360]  child molester armies that's all that's all wonderful that's all good that's all great
[2:56:53.360 --> 2:56:58.400]  that's all kosher but for us oh the national guard like oh we're scared the military's here
[2:56:59.680 --> 2:57:04.160]  what a joke we are peaceful you're here exposing the fraud the democrats said they were going to

[2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:24.320]  big tech that's been lying to the public and keeping her by the dark so i always admired
[2:57:24.320 --> 2:57:28.080]  ted cruz and always really smart and then he you know went political against trump and i got mad
[2:57:28.080 --> 2:57:32.560]  at him but he's a great senator we're so blessed to have him instead of beto roark and i'm really
[2:57:32.560 --> 2:57:38.080]  glad to see him leading the charge with joch holly who and if it came to his house we never aired this
[2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:42.880]  but you can you can actually i saw the news that josh holly senator claims they came to his house

[2:59:00.560 --> 2:59:05.040]  you only have till friday to do that everybody just needs durable food that's high quality
[2:59:05.040 --> 2:59:09.680]  last 25 years in these big sealed plastic tote containers and sealed containers inside that
[2:59:09.680 --> 2:59:13.360]  it's where i get my food you pay three four times more i get stuff that even tastes better
[2:59:13.360 --> 2:59:19.440]  some taste gourmet some taste great some taste okay but it is literally light years ahead of any

[2:59:24.720 --> 2:59:30.080]  stuff as well but it's like four or five times more uh so again but some of this is gourmet tasting
[2:59:30.800 --> 2:59:36.000]  infowarstore.com always has their lowest prices except for these rare specials which they didn't
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:40.400]  do for years they've been like three in the last few months uh and that's period alex dot com period
[2:59:40.400 --> 2:59:45.680]  alex dot com you haven't tried to get the orders in before prices go up they're ready to ship to you
[2:59:45.680 --> 2:59:52.080]  right now the populist movement that elected president trump four years ago re-elected him by
[2:59:52.080 --> 2:59:58.000]  an even bigger landslide rejecting and repudiating and discrediting the globalist that's why they
[2:59:58.000 --> 3:00:02.400]  had to overturn the chessboard that's why they had to engage in naked election fraud in front
[3:00:02.400 --> 3:00:07.760]  of everyone and as long as we never accept the fraudulent results as long as we don't let them
[3:00:07.760 --> 3:00:12.880]  gaslight us into submission as long as we point out this foreign globalist takeover of our country
[3:00:12.880 --> 3:00:17.920]  and that all the depression and all of the collapse that's coming is because of the new world order
[3:00:17.920 --> 3:00:23.360]  this will end up fully destroying them in the future if we don't submit if we submit they'll
[3:00:23.360 --> 3:00:28.000]  normalize the communism they'll normalize putting us into a depression they'll normalize breaking up
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:33.920]  our families taking our guns we can't let that happen and info wars is more important than ever
[3:00:33.920 --> 3:00:38.640]  so please paul revere's i salute you for your past actions keep spreading band off video
[3:00:38.640 --> 3:00:44.400]  and info wars dot com and come to the big dc marches on the fifth and sixth of january i'll see you
[3:00:44.400 --> 3:00:56.880]  there god bless
[3:01:00.720 --> 3:01:04.880]  go back
[3:01:06.880 --> 3:01:11.600]  covid-19 tyranny news hour because basically that's all we talk about at this point because
[3:01:11.600 --> 3:01:17.920]  what is what else is more important prime minister borris johnson announced yet another
[3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:24.560]  lockdown yesterday the third lockdown i mean who's counting at this point he announced a third
[3:01:24.560 --> 3:01:31.280]  lockdown of course we had a lockdown in london back in november which lasted until december
[3:01:31.280 --> 3:01:37.200]  second turns out that after lockdown there were more cases of corona virus in london after the
[3:01:37.200 --> 3:01:42.640]  lockdown than before it the lockdown didn't work so what's the solution oh another lockdown
[3:01:43.360 --> 3:01:50.640]  and now we're seeing indications that yes not only is this going to go on until february march
[3:01:50.640 --> 3:01:57.600]  april spring summer they're now saying there will still be corona virus lockdown restrictions in
[3:01:57.600 --> 3:02:07.120]  place not this winter but next winter headline out of sky news covid-19 some coronavirus restrictions
[3:02:07.120 --> 3:02:16.400]  could return next winter that's 2022 chief medical officer warns professor chris witty who's every
[3:02:16.400 --> 3:02:21.760]  prognostication and prediction has been proven completely inaccurate but we're still basing
[3:02:21.760 --> 3:02:29.680]  national policy national suicide that is on all his models so some coronavirus restrictions
[3:02:29.680 --> 3:02:35.120]  may have to be brought back to control the virus next winter i thought we had a vaccine i thought
[3:02:35.120 --> 3:02:41.920]  the cavalcade was coming to save us all turns out as we're going to get into later the vaccine is
[3:02:41.920 --> 3:02:47.600]  completely ineffective against some of these new strains so then it's going to take another six weeks
[3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:52.400]  to modify the vaccine maybe they'll need a new vaccine basically we got a lockdown forever
[3:02:52.400 --> 3:02:59.920]  i'm sorry nothing's opening again the economy's shutting down massive depression massive death
[3:02:59.920 --> 3:03:05.600]  tolls from untreated illnesses and that's just the way it's got to be they just like this power too
[3:03:05.600 --> 3:03:10.560]  much they're not going to give it up easy speaking at downing street news conference
[3:03:11.440 --> 3:03:17.200]  where they just announced new laws without even parliamentary approval now professor chris witty
[3:03:17.200 --> 3:03:22.640]  warned that the risks will continue to exist as the weather gets warmer saying we shouldn't kid
[3:03:22.640 --> 3:03:28.640]  ourselves that this just disappears with the spring you said if we did not do all the things
[3:03:28.640 --> 3:03:33.360]  of us we must do now for people don't take stay home seriously the risk at this point in this time
[3:03:33.360 --> 3:03:37.920]  in the middle of winter with this new variant is extraordinarily high you went on to say
[3:03:37.920 --> 3:03:43.600]  that the restrictions will probably be brought back into operation next winter
[3:03:45.920 --> 3:03:50.080]  so we're already under lockdown they're saying it's not going to end anytime soon within the
[3:03:50.080 --> 3:03:55.280]  next few weeks it's not going to end in february it's not going to end in march it's basically a
[3:03:55.280 --> 3:04:01.680]  permanent state of lockdown they're not calling it a period of lockdown anymore they're calling it
[3:04:01.680 --> 3:04:09.600]  a state of lockdown isn't it interesting when you look at the numbers and i retweeted this
[3:04:09.600 --> 3:04:16.560]  just a moment ago this whole third lockdown is being predicated on the contention that we have
[3:04:16.560 --> 3:04:26.560]  58 000 new cases today for example in the united kingdom a couple of days ago 407 deaths 58 000
[3:04:26.560 --> 3:04:30.880]  cases a day really is that because of mass testing or is that because we really have a
[3:04:31.440 --> 3:04:36.240]  massive problem with coronavirus infections that is overwhelming our hospitals as we're
[3:04:36.240 --> 3:04:43.440]  going to get on to that is not the case but you look at friends on this one day in question
[3:04:43.440 --> 3:04:52.640]  december 29th they had 378 deaths from coronavirus and remember a coronavirus death is counted as such
[3:04:52.640 --> 3:05:00.880]  if the death occurs within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test you could fall out of an office
[3:05:00.880 --> 3:05:07.440]  block window within 28 days of getting a positive coronavirus test and your death will be recorded
[3:05:07.440 --> 3:05:15.040]  as a covid 19 death so of course when they're testing all these elderly infirm people with
[3:05:15.040 --> 3:05:21.760]  multiple comorbidities multiple other serious illnesses many of them are dying within 28 days
[3:05:21.760 --> 3:05:28.880]  of a covid test doesn't mean they died of covid but that immediately automatically becomes a
[3:05:28.880 --> 3:05:35.040]  covid death and that's why these death numbers are way over exaggerated but again when you look at
[3:05:35.040 --> 3:05:40.560]  the cases you had similar death numbers on this one day across different european countries
[3:05:41.280 --> 3:05:49.920]  including germany which on december 29th had 527 deaths again multiple comorbidities these people
[3:05:49.920 --> 3:05:55.680]  are unfortunately elderly people who would have died anyway in a vast majority of cases
[3:05:55.680 --> 3:06:04.240]  but they had fit 527 record deaths on december 29th compared to the uk with 407 deaths yet
[3:06:04.240 --> 3:06:15.840]  germany recorded only 8039 coronavirus cases compared to 58784 in the united kingdom so again
[3:06:15.840 --> 3:06:21.680]  this lockdown three is predicated on the notion that we're having a massive uncontrolled explosion
[3:06:21.680 --> 3:06:28.640]  in coronavirus cases the reality as it's always been from the very beginning is that mass testing
[3:06:28.640 --> 3:06:35.600]  is taking place and that these PCR tests are notorious for producing false positives but
[3:06:35.600 --> 3:06:42.160]  apparently that's enough to wreck our entire economy for decades to come massive jobless numbers
[3:06:42.720 --> 3:06:49.360]  which of course leads to poverty poverty leads to death poverty leads to mental illness depression
[3:06:49.360 --> 3:06:55.280]  suicide and then of course we have the question of whether the hospitals are overwhelmed and i'm
[3:06:55.280 --> 3:07:00.160]  going to get into that probably in the next segment with multiple videos now of people
[3:07:00.160 --> 3:07:06.080]  filming inside hospitals and lo and behold they're all empty a woman was arrested for
[3:07:06.080 --> 3:07:10.400]  filming inside a hospital because it was empty i'm going to get on to that we have a headline here
[3:07:10.400 --> 3:07:17.360]  out of summit news epidemiologist says influencer cases are being counted as covid 19 everyone's
[3:07:17.360 --> 3:07:24.800]  asking the question what happened to the flu nobody seems to be dying of the flu anymore isn't that
[3:07:24.800 --> 3:07:32.480]  interesting well now top epidemiologist not witowski says that the massive drop in influenza cases
[3:07:33.120 --> 3:07:39.440]  can be attributed to the fact that many are being falsely counted as covid 19 cases again this is not
[3:07:39.440 --> 3:07:46.080]  some crackpot this is the former head of biostatistics epidemiology and design research at
[3:07:46.080 --> 3:07:54.160]  rockefeller university and he said that quote influenza has been renamed covid 19 in large part
[3:07:54.160 --> 3:07:58.640]  so of course they're getting these massive spikes in death numbers because they're counting
[3:07:58.640 --> 3:08:03.840]  flu deaths which are completely common which of course happen at much greater intensity
[3:08:03.840 --> 3:08:12.640]  in the winter period as covid 19 deaths according to cdc figures the cumulative positive influenza
[3:08:12.640 --> 3:08:19.600]  test rate from late september into the week of december 19th was just 0.2 percent compared to
[3:08:19.600 --> 3:08:28.000]  8.7 percent from a year before so basically all the flu cases have disappeared and been
[3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:34.240]  folded into the covid 19 cases according to witowski this is because many flu infections
[3:08:34.240 --> 3:08:39.840]  are being incorrectly labeled as coronavirus cases he said quote there may be quite a number
[3:08:39.840 --> 3:08:47.200]  of influenza cases included in the presumed covid 19 category of people who have covid 19 symptoms
[3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:54.640]  but are not tested for SARS RNA he said those patients may also have some SARS RNA sitting
[3:08:54.640 --> 3:09:00.400]  in their nose while being infected with influenza in which case the influenza would be confirmed
[3:09:00.400 --> 3:09:06.720]  to be covid 19 and then he challenges the argument which many have come out with of course
[3:09:07.760 --> 3:09:13.920]  with these mask mandates especially in places like california and pennsylvania people continuing
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:20.240]  to insist that masks stop the transmission of coronavirus despite the fact that in every area
[3:09:20.240 --> 3:09:26.160]  of america basically where mask mandates as it is at its most intense in places like california
[3:09:26.160 --> 3:09:31.200]  and then if you look at countries like spain and germany as soon as they introduce the mask
[3:09:31.200 --> 3:09:39.200]  mandates coronavirus cases skyrocketed but apparently masks stop coronavirus he challenges
[3:09:39.200 --> 3:09:45.920]  the notion that coronavirus cases are being combated by mask wearing he said this is again
[3:09:45.920 --> 3:09:51.520]  this is a top epidemiologist people know everybody's wearing masks and distancing and so people want
[3:09:51.520 --> 3:09:57.200]  to come up with things that are good about it but as the article notes in which this interview
[3:09:57.200 --> 3:10:03.360]  appears data indicates that more than nine out of every 10 americans in most states are wearing
[3:10:03.360 --> 3:10:09.440]  masks in public regularly those numbers have been above 80 since the early fall your average positive
[3:10:09.440 --> 3:10:19.280]  covid 19 tests have multiplied by nearly seven times since the spring break again it's having no
[3:10:19.280 --> 3:10:28.080]  effect whatsoever unless you count rapidly rising cases as being a success now we're under lockdown
[3:10:28.080 --> 3:10:37.600]  3.0 in the u.k. parliament is going to rubber stamp it tomorrow what didn't work first two times
[3:10:45.360 --> 3:10:51.280]  our activated charcoal toothpaste became a best-seller overnight because activated charcoal is already one

[3:11:50.080 --> 3:11:55.040]  part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse if they're able to keep trump from
[3:11:55.040 --> 3:12:00.960]  rightfully taking office for second term ontarian 20th the system is going to drop the hammer
[3:12:00.960 --> 3:12:05.440]  harder than ever on this republic they are going to explode gas prices they're going to shut down
[3:12:05.440 --> 3:12:10.320]  our coal power plants they're going to cut off the energy source to us so it's impossible for
[3:12:10.320 --> 3:12:15.200]  factories to move back here this is economic domination this is economic war we are being
[3:12:15.200 --> 3:12:20.320]  consolidated we're being taken over the democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:26.080]  they're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal
[3:12:26.080 --> 3:12:31.120]  and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property this is a monopolistic
[3:12:31.120 --> 3:12:36.160]  takeover that's what the great reset is clout swab and these other criminals admit it that's what
[3:12:36.160 --> 3:12:42.160]  social distancing is so your business is only a 25 for several more years no small businesses
[3:12:42.160 --> 3:12:44.720]  will be there this is a master plan say no
[3:12:48.880 --> 3:12:51.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:12:58.320 --> 3:13:05.840]  transmitting worldwide from the summit dot new studios in the united kingdom you're listening
[3:13:05.840 --> 3:13:15.200]  to paul joseph watson we're live and we are going to go to this video which is going to be a couple
[3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:24.880]  of hours it remains up chocolatey not on youtube yesterday delete the entire channel of a mainstream
[3:13:24.880 --> 3:13:30.240]  talk radio network in the united kingdom because it regularly featured guests who question the
[3:13:30.240 --> 3:13:38.560]  sanctity the sanity of the lockdown formula we're gonna get onto that it's actually being restored
[3:13:38.560 --> 3:13:42.880]  because enough people complained about it they had enough people within the mainstream and in
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:49.520]  fact in the government to complain about it but youtube completely off the goop in directly taking
[3:13:49.520 --> 3:13:55.520]  down an actual off-com regulated mainstream broadcaster on its network that's probably the
[3:13:55.520 --> 3:14:01.760]  first time that's happened of course oan was briefly suspended last month but we're gonna get
[3:14:01.760 --> 3:14:08.000]  into more of that in the next segment first of all here is the new video lockdown three this is
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:18.720]  up on youtube let's roll it here it is oh look it's yet another video about yet another bloody
[3:14:18.720 --> 3:14:26.480]  lockdown you're joking not another one oh for god's sake i can't honestly i can't stand this
[3:14:26.480 --> 3:14:34.560]  10 months later and we're still mired in the stay at home protect the nhs and save lives
[3:14:34.560 --> 3:14:40.960]  another lockdown because the first god knows how many worked so well the vast majority of the
[3:14:40.960 --> 3:14:46.000]  country was already under tier four lockdown what's tier five you're gonna tag us all with
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:50.800]  electronic ankle bracelets you're gonna have snipers positioned to take out anyone who dares
[3:14:50.800 --> 3:14:55.280]  open their front door i mean short of taking china's lead and literally welding everyone
[3:14:55.280 --> 3:15:00.960]  inside their homes what's the point as author william and briggs points out all lockdowns do
[3:15:00.960 --> 3:15:06.800]  is force people to gather in fewer places instead of remaining at liberty and being able to spread
[3:15:06.800 --> 3:15:12.720]  out under lockdown everyone just piles into the park or onto the beach lockdowns are merely forced
[3:15:12.720 --> 3:15:17.280]  gatherings right briggs people in lockdown are allowed to venture forth from their dwellings
[3:15:17.280 --> 3:15:22.960]  to do essential activities like spending money at oligarch run stores these stores are collection
[3:15:22.960 --> 3:15:28.960]  points where people are concentrated some are allowed to go to jobs such as supporting oligarch
[3:15:28.960 --> 3:15:34.240]  run stores but don't worry multimillionaire premier league players will still be able to kick a ball
[3:15:34.240 --> 3:15:39.280]  around for the sake of transnational media empire is not taking a cut in profit but you and your
[3:15:39.280 --> 3:15:45.840]  mate can't play golf what a joke under this new lockdown the government in its infinite wisdom
[3:15:45.840 --> 3:15:51.360]  has also banned takeaway alcohol sales presumably so people who turn to booze to help with severe
[3:15:51.360 --> 3:15:58.720]  depression can just go straight to offing themselves genius high profile morons which is
[3:15:58.720 --> 3:16:04.800]  what they've become continuing to downplay this and to say it's not what it actually is
[3:16:04.800 --> 3:16:11.920]  is that will cost lives people are going to die if they believe this is not actually a serious
[3:16:11.920 --> 3:16:17.760]  situation the issue was so serious to peers that he jetted off to the caribbean while demanding
[3:16:17.760 --> 3:16:22.960]  everyone else stay at home so i don't get to see my parents in spain at christmas but this
[3:16:22.960 --> 3:16:28.400]  deceitful toss spot gets the sun is carcass on an antigen beach then return to breakfast tv to
[3:16:28.400 --> 3:16:35.120]  lecture everyone else about their behavior off i'm stuck indoors with the heating of full blast watching
[3:16:35.120 --> 3:16:41.280]  crap telly reruns while he's cavorting around a luxury resort being massaged and pampered this
[3:16:41.280 --> 3:16:47.920]  dickhead indulges himself in a tropical paradise then flies back first class to publicly shame people
[3:16:47.920 --> 3:16:53.120]  for daring to gather outside in the freezing cold for a new year's eve drink this is the same
[3:16:53.120 --> 3:16:59.040]  hypocritical wanker who brow beats others for not wearing masks while failing to wear one himself
[3:16:59.040 --> 3:17:06.240]  again off and guess what well us lot are under de facto house arrest while we can't go anywhere
[3:17:06.240 --> 3:17:11.680]  people from countries around the world continue to come and go as they please what on earth is the
[3:17:11.680 --> 3:17:17.840]  point in locking your bedroom door while leaving your front door wide open pumps closed borders
[3:17:17.840 --> 3:17:24.000]  open they're taking the piss our own border patrol rescues and houses illegal boat migrants
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:29.920]  while the covet cops arrested dude for hugging and harass an elderly woman for feeding the pigeons
[3:17:29.920 --> 3:17:35.760]  taking the piss the maid announced the men's arrival two officers draped in dark green introduced
[3:17:35.760 --> 3:17:40.880]  themselves and told dame civil that they had come to establish some rules there would be a curfew at
[3:17:40.880 --> 3:17:46.800]  11 p.m no groups larger than five were allowed in the streets all pubs were to be closed all arms
[3:17:46.800 --> 3:17:52.320]  were to be confiscated and no boats were allowed to leave the harbour covid wardens no that's a
[3:17:52.320 --> 3:17:58.800]  description of the channel islands under Nazi occupation according to you gov 79 percent of
[3:17:58.800 --> 3:18:05.280]  brit support the uk going into another lockdown and only 16 percent oppose the only explanation
[3:18:05.280 --> 3:18:10.560]  i can offer at this point is this one people are lazy bastards who enjoy getting paid furlough
[3:18:10.560 --> 3:18:16.160]  money to sit on their arses and two people must hate their normal lives and jobs so much
[3:18:16.160 --> 3:18:21.600]  that they literally never want to go back to normal they'd rather turn into blobs satisfied to
[3:18:21.600 --> 3:18:28.960]  be skin grafted to their own sofa than face the real world again or the polls are total ball
[3:18:28.960 --> 3:18:35.040]  they're almost exclusively sampling permanently terrified jellyfish who have hysterical bbc breaking
[3:18:35.040 --> 3:18:41.840]  news alerts directly piped into their limbic system the cdc says that 94 percent of people who
[3:18:41.840 --> 3:18:50.960]  died from covid had other significant diseases or comorbidities in the uk 377 healthy people
[3:18:50.960 --> 3:18:57.280]  under the age of 60 have died from covid the average age of coronavirus fatalities is 82 years
[3:18:57.280 --> 3:19:04.000]  old if you die within 28 days of a positive covid test that's recorded as a covid death
[3:19:04.000 --> 3:19:10.480]  gee i wonder why so many deaths are being blamed on covid but the hospitals are full uh yeah it's
[3:19:10.480 --> 3:19:14.880]  winter they're always full better not try to see for yourself though or you'll be arrested
[3:19:14.880 --> 3:19:20.880]  as this graph of mortality across europe shows the spike in winter is nothing new more people
[3:19:20.880 --> 3:19:27.600]  die in winter remember the lockdowns of 2017 and 2018 when we had more winter deaths than we're
[3:19:27.600 --> 3:19:34.640]  currently experiencing no neither do i because they didn't happen our hospitals more overwhelmed
[3:19:34.640 --> 3:19:39.680]  than they would be during a normal winter according to nhs data in december 2019 hospital
[3:19:39.680 --> 3:19:46.480]  beds were 95 percent occupy compared to december 2020 when they were only 89 percent occupied
[3:19:46.480 --> 3:19:51.760]  critical care occupancy is below the three-year average that's a no then but hey look on the
[3:19:51.760 --> 3:19:56.480]  bright side at least we get to see more tiktok dancing nurse video was i mean it's not like
[3:19:56.480 --> 3:20:00.080]  the family members of cancer victims who had their treatment cancelled because of lockdown
[3:20:00.080 --> 3:20:10.880]  complained about it or anything i'll miss you dad i only wish that i could have held your hand one last time
[3:20:10.880 --> 3:20:16.160]  still at least they're humble about it all tell me how bad is it already drafting my tweet why
[3:20:16.160 --> 3:20:22.000]  does the government always get away with hiding the impact of lockdown untreated serious illnesses
[3:20:22.000 --> 3:20:29.680]  job losses poverty mental illness suicide why is this never factored into their decision why do
[3:20:29.680 --> 3:20:36.560]  they never explain the consequences studies show that lockdowns cause no emotional harm it's like
[3:20:36.560 --> 3:20:42.480]  waking up from a nightmare only to realize you're still trapped inside the nightmare three weeks to
[3:20:42.480 --> 3:20:48.640]  protect the nhs that's what we were told 10 months ago and here we are will the vaccine be effective
[3:20:48.640 --> 3:20:56.240]  against the new strains how many more lockdowns do we need what's the exit strategy will this ever
[3:20:56.240 --> 3:21:02.880]  end the who says there are worse pandemics to come unless we see mass resistance which is
[3:21:02.880 --> 3:21:08.400]  pretty unlikely given the polls this isn't a new lockdown this is just a continuation
[3:21:08.960 --> 3:21:13.040]  of the new normal a new normal that could go on forever
[3:21:18.560 --> 3:21:22.720]  well there you have it lockdown three we were told three weeks to protect the nhs now they're
[3:21:22.720 --> 3:21:28.960]  literally saying oh by the way this is all still gonna be in place not until spring but until next
[3:21:28.960 --> 3:21:36.480]  winter at least they've also said it's all gonna continue until 2022 2023 kind of like they don't
[3:21:36.480 --> 3:21:41.120]  really want to stop the virus and this lockdown is about something else all together isn't it don't

[3:25:01.360 --> 3:25:13.920]  there's a video on twitter which i retweeted about an hour ago posted by ashley saint claire
[3:25:13.920 --> 3:25:19.520]  and again it's another one of these mass confrontations these women they all look the same i made a
[3:25:19.520 --> 3:25:25.120]  video once called why do they always look the same and it was specifically about left-wing male
[3:25:25.120 --> 3:25:31.680]  activists in the united kingdom who all look like the sort the classic soy wojak you also have the
[3:25:31.680 --> 3:25:38.480]  female left-wing karen version and that is the most accurate application of the karen meme of
[3:25:38.480 --> 3:25:43.760]  course the left tried to hijack that and make it about you know people who go into walmart without
[3:25:43.760 --> 3:25:49.120]  wearing a mask this is the true essence of a karen that you can see in this video to
[3:25:49.120 --> 3:25:56.320]  that middle-aged female wojaks on a train presumably this is people going to washington dc
[3:25:56.960 --> 3:26:03.920]  couple of guys sitting down drinking coffee without their masks on oh my god how on earth
[3:26:03.920 --> 3:26:11.680]  you meant to drink coffee with a frigging mask on so these two fat feminists one of whom it later
[3:26:11.680 --> 3:26:18.720]  turns out imagine my shock works for the huffington post gets in their face with a camera and starts
[3:26:18.720 --> 3:26:26.160]  trying to get them kicked off a train but drinking a coffee sat down minding their own business drinking
[3:26:26.160 --> 3:26:32.800]  a coffee while not wearing a mask literally impossible to drink anything or eat anything while
[3:26:32.800 --> 3:26:38.960]  you're wearing a mask just brazen harassment oh but joe biden said the masks aren't political
[3:26:38.960 --> 3:26:45.920]  they're patriotic they're totally political and they don't work look at california after their
[3:26:45.920 --> 3:26:53.360]  mask mandate coronavirus case to shop but it's empowered it's empowered a legion of these karen
[3:26:54.160 --> 3:26:59.760]  female wojak busybodies sticking their phone camera in your face demanding you wear a mask
[3:27:01.120 --> 3:27:05.920]  they tried to get the conductor involved he's not interested he says you want me to call the police
[3:27:05.920 --> 3:27:11.600]  they back off and that's the end of it these are the ones that get caught on camera there are thousands
[3:27:11.600 --> 3:27:15.440]  and thousands of these confrontations probably happening every week that we don't even see or
[3:27:15.440 --> 3:27:23.120]  hear about i was out running a couple of days ago because of course as i mentioned in that video
[3:27:23.120 --> 3:27:28.800]  and i'm going to get onto the article in a moment too the thing about these lockdowns is people are
[3:27:28.800 --> 3:27:35.440]  still going out right they're still going to the supermarket they're still going to the park so what
[3:27:35.440 --> 3:27:42.800]  happens is whereas you could have people spread out and not being as in close contact if you
[3:27:42.800 --> 3:27:47.920]  really want to maintain this social distancing what happens specifically in the major cities in
[3:27:47.920 --> 3:27:55.920]  london where i am everyone from everywhere around just pours into the park you literally can barely
[3:27:55.920 --> 3:28:01.840]  run now in the park because it's so full of people meanwhile as old hoburn points out here in this
[3:28:01.840 --> 3:28:09.680]  tweet public transport remains completely open the planes continue to land from beijing from
[3:28:09.680 --> 3:28:18.080]  africa from south africa we've supposedly passed a law or a regulation in the uk where people coming
[3:28:18.080 --> 3:28:22.480]  in from south africa can't enter the country because they've apparently got an even more
[3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:27.520]  virulent mutant strain of this coronavirus yeah i checked earlier and the the planes from
[3:28:27.520 --> 3:28:34.400]  johannesburg are continuing to land who is on these planes meanwhile we have internal borders
[3:28:34.400 --> 3:28:40.480]  that was the the lesser lockdown was the internal borders where i couldn't drive 30 miles away to
[3:28:40.480 --> 3:28:47.040]  see a relative meanwhile the borders remain wide open as i mentioned in the video there
[3:28:47.600 --> 3:28:51.520]  if you're part of the privileged elite like pierce morgan who lectures everyone else about their
[3:28:51.520 --> 3:28:56.080]  behavior and says you've got to stay at home otherwise people are going to die oh but he
[3:28:56.080 --> 3:29:01.280]  can fly off to the caribbean first class for a luxury resort holiday and come back you're bad
[3:29:01.280 --> 3:29:07.360]  for having a new year's eve drink we're ruled by people like that we're ruled by people like mass
[3:29:07.360 --> 3:29:14.160]  carons but as i said the lockdowns they just concentrate people into smaller areas it's
[3:29:14.160 --> 3:29:22.800]  completely nonsensical everyone piles into the parks so again i wrote an article a few months ago
[3:29:22.800 --> 3:29:28.560]  about people going to tourist hotspots in the united kingdom to get away from the big cities
[3:29:28.560 --> 3:29:33.840]  the residents of these hotspots literally jumping out of the way in shock and horror
[3:29:33.840 --> 3:29:38.960]  when people are walking towards them on the other side of the road without wearing masks
[3:29:39.840 --> 3:29:46.880]  same thing happened to me i was running in the park not even running very quickly because there
[3:29:46.880 --> 3:29:52.320]  are too many people you can barely move because lockdowns are stupid everyone concentrates congregates
[3:29:52.320 --> 3:29:59.920]  into fewer areas literally running towards someone not even at any kind of speed and he literally
[3:30:00.800 --> 3:30:08.080]  panicked shrieked jumped out the way he was literally like ducking and weaving trying to
[3:30:08.080 --> 3:30:13.040]  figure out which way i was going to go when i was basically jogging towards him and then he
[3:30:13.040 --> 3:30:21.440]  literally leapt out of the way and shrieked in terror this is a grown man of i guess you know
[3:30:21.440 --> 3:30:28.080]  around 30 35 years of age this is a grown man shrieking in terror and leaping out of the way
[3:30:28.080 --> 3:30:36.080]  because another human being is not even fast approaching them this is the society that we
[3:30:36.080 --> 3:30:42.800]  now live in where these people wearing masks look so self-righteous they're such good people
[3:30:44.240 --> 3:30:48.720]  they're such good people and they care about people not dying they'll tell you to wear a mask
[3:30:48.720 --> 3:30:53.360]  and if you dare advocate against wearing masks or even question it they'll accuse you of wanting
[3:30:53.360 --> 3:30:59.280]  to kill people oh and by the way they'll also then tell you in instagram dm messages and twitter dm
[3:30:59.280 --> 3:31:06.560]  messages how they also want to kill you so they're really sacrosanct about preserving life unless you
[3:31:06.560 --> 3:31:11.360]  question their narrative then they immediately want to kill you and will tell you and will send you
[3:31:11.360 --> 3:31:17.840]  death threats on social media these are good people hashtag be kind and we see another case of that
[3:31:17.840 --> 3:31:23.520]  in this train incident today but again as i mentioned in the video and as i mentioned previously
[3:31:24.560 --> 3:31:29.760]  these lockdowns they just force people into tighter and tighter areas supermarkets parks
[3:31:29.760 --> 3:31:36.720]  beaches whatever you want headline statistician lockdowns don't work because they force people
[3:31:36.720 --> 3:31:44.320]  to congregate in fewer places this was an article by william m briggs posted on lockdown skeptics.org
[3:31:44.320 --> 3:31:50.160]  who stated the lockdown will spread this book faster than allowing people to remain at liberty
[3:31:51.360 --> 3:31:55.920]  he says it's clear that our 100 percent transmissible bug will spread much faster
[3:31:55.920 --> 3:32:01.200]  when people are forced to spend more time indoors with each other which is exactly what's going on
[3:32:02.240 --> 3:32:06.880]  once one person gets it he will spread it to those at his home immediately if people were at
[3:32:06.880 --> 3:32:15.920]  liberty and therefore more separated the bug would still spread to everybody but more slowly he goes on
[3:32:15.920 --> 3:32:20.320]  lockdowns force people together the venues they're allowed to venture to are restricted
[3:32:20.320 --> 3:32:25.600]  and therefore concentrate contact and they force people inside their home so again everyone piles
[3:32:25.600 --> 3:32:31.840]  into the supermarkets the parks they're more likely to transmit the virus instead of allowing
[3:32:31.840 --> 3:32:37.920]  people to spread out it makes no sense whatsoever again unless you literally want to weld people
[3:32:37.920 --> 3:32:44.000]  inside their homes like communist china did which is literally what many people are now advocating
[3:32:46.000 --> 3:32:53.040]  meanwhile police demand elderly lady stop feeding pigeons under covid lockdown rules yes
[3:32:53.680 --> 3:32:59.680]  we have boat migrants illegal boat migrants many of whom have links to terrorists and extremist
[3:32:59.680 --> 3:33:04.960]  groups in the middle east and north africa as we saw with the manchester bomber who by the way was
[3:33:04.960 --> 3:33:10.080]  a boat migrant who our own government literally brought into the country those people are still
[3:33:10.080 --> 3:33:15.120]  at liberty to enter the country be given free housing be allowed to move about as they please on
[3:33:15.120 --> 3:33:22.000]  public transport but this old lady in central london feeding the pigeons gonna crack down on her
[3:33:23.120 --> 3:33:28.080]  the old woman throwing pieces of bread to the pigeons was apparently some kind of violation as
[3:33:28.080 --> 3:33:33.440]  it pertains to the gatherings of people but quite how god only knows she was literally on her own
[3:33:34.720 --> 3:33:39.600]  i think that the justification they use was because some other people were around her and
[3:33:39.600 --> 3:33:44.400]  then they claimed it was a gathering the pensioner was forced to leave the area or she would have
[3:33:44.400 --> 3:33:49.360]  been presumably being fined or even arrested then there's another clip in the same article
[3:33:50.560 --> 3:33:55.440]  which shows about two dozen police officers marching through hide park in central london
[3:33:55.440 --> 3:34:03.520]  like their military literally marching in lockstep then they halt they literally halt turn to a few
[3:34:03.520 --> 3:34:10.480]  people start demanding their ids start demanding proof that they live together again your pretty
[3:34:10.480 --> 3:34:16.800]  your identification doesn't say where you live in the united kingdom your passport your driver's
[3:34:16.800 --> 3:34:21.120]  license even if you're gonna present it doesn't say where you live so how are you gonna prove
[3:34:21.120 --> 3:34:30.160]  where you live we saw another video where a guy was arrested for hugging people so a guy arrested
[3:34:30.160 --> 3:34:35.600]  for hugging people old woman arrested or nearly arrested for feeding pigeons get the migrant

[3:41:39.760 --> 3:41:48.320]  completely off the goop last night they they straight up terminated a mainstream news channel
[3:41:48.320 --> 3:41:55.600]  from their platform because they'd had a few guests on that questioned the sanity of lockdowns
[3:41:55.600 --> 3:42:00.480]  and questioned whether lockdowns are actually working this is out of bright bar google owned
[3:42:00.480 --> 3:42:08.080]  youtube blacklist british covid lockdown skeptic radio station now this is talk radio which i think
[3:42:08.080 --> 3:42:14.080]  has been around for decades it's one of the oldest commercial radio stations in the uk it's actually
[3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:20.480]  regulated by off-com which is even more severe in terms of restrictions of what you can and can't
[3:42:20.480 --> 3:42:29.200]  say than youtube in many cases so it's a mainstream talk radio network regulated by an official
[3:42:29.200 --> 3:42:34.800]  regulator in the united kingdom doesn't matter youtube just deleted their entire channel
[3:42:36.960 --> 3:42:40.480]  says the google on video streaming platform deleted the channel in the early hours of
[3:42:40.480 --> 3:42:44.560]  tuesday morning just after the announcement that england would be entering another lockdown
[3:42:45.920 --> 3:42:50.240]  gido forks blog report that youtube merely stated that the channel was terminated for violating
[3:42:50.240 --> 3:42:55.840]  youtube's community guidelines the band follows a number of other censures by the google owned
[3:42:55.840 --> 3:43:00.960]  video platform again you can't question you can't question for example the fact that lockdowns don't
[3:43:00.960 --> 3:43:07.200]  work even though as this american institute for economic research article highlights and this
[3:43:07.200 --> 3:43:12.560]  that was what i wanted to mention as well not just my opinion that lockdowns don't work in this
[3:43:12.560 --> 3:43:19.200]  article alone which is entitled lockdowns do not control the coronavirus the evidence they cite and
[3:43:19.200 --> 3:43:26.960]  link to 27 different studies many of them peer reviewed that prove beyond doubt that lockdowns
[3:43:26.960 --> 3:43:33.040]  don't work they don't reduce the transmissibility of the virus but if you talk about these peer
[3:43:33.040 --> 3:43:39.840]  reviewed studies on youtube they'll just delete your entire channel even if you cite health authorities
[3:43:39.840 --> 3:43:44.880]  which go against the narrative you're gone and that's what happened to talk radio but thankfully
[3:43:44.880 --> 3:43:51.840]  for them a lot of other people haven't had this convenience because people in government including
[3:43:51.840 --> 3:43:56.960]  michael gove who was literally in the government was a guest on that radio station this morning
[3:43:56.960 --> 3:44:03.600]  complained about it and several other prominent people complained about it the youtube channel was
[3:44:03.600 --> 3:44:10.080]  within 24 hours reinstated which again is not a convenience that many other people would enjoy
[3:44:12.000 --> 3:44:18.640]  this is out of the guido forks blog talk radio youtube channel reinstated there's after 19 hours
[3:44:18.640 --> 3:44:24.160]  of being declared terminated talk radio youtube channel has been reinstated a whole working day
[3:44:24.160 --> 3:44:29.920]  and declared termination doesn't sound like a brief suspension to guido because youtube came out and
[3:44:29.920 --> 3:44:36.880]  said quote the channel was briefly suspended but on further review it's now being reinstated yeah
[3:44:36.880 --> 3:44:40.800]  they only reviewed it because loads of people complained about it and some of those people
[3:44:40.800 --> 3:44:45.520]  were quite prominent and they were in government but then you look at something like the online
[3:44:45.520 --> 3:44:51.600]  harms bill which is being debated and is about to be passed in the united kingdom that again
[3:44:51.600 --> 3:44:58.160]  puts the pressure on government to put the pressure on youtube twitter these other social media networks
[3:44:58.160 --> 3:45:03.680]  to censor quote hate speech which of course is definition we know has been expanded out extrapolated
[3:45:03.680 --> 3:45:12.160]  out to include basically any questioning of any official narrative so don't expect youtube's freedom
[3:45:12.160 --> 3:45:18.240]  of speech speech platform or position on that issue in reinstating the channel to remain the
[3:45:18.240 --> 3:45:21.440]  case for very long at least in the united kingdom with the kind of legislation that
[3:45:21.440 --> 3:45:27.760]  we've got going through at the moment meanwhile this is from a few days ago but it's still very
[3:45:27.760 --> 3:45:36.000]  important uk woman arrested for filming inside empty hospital this was in Gloucestershire that
[3:45:36.000 --> 3:45:40.320]  the Gloucestershire royal hospital because of course this whole narrative the hospitals are
[3:45:40.320 --> 3:45:46.560]  being overwhelmed is the foundation for lockdown three in the united kingdom despite the fact that
[3:45:46.560 --> 3:45:51.200]  there are more empty hospital beds than there were at this time last year despite the fact
[3:45:51.200 --> 3:45:56.640]  that critical care beds at the average is lower than it was over the past three years despite the
[3:45:56.640 --> 3:46:04.000]  fact that more people die in winter every year and in fact the spikes in deaths over previous
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:10.000]  winters in the united kingdom were bigger than the current covid spike of winter deaths and so
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:15.680]  this woman decided to investigate for herself what the situation was like inside her local hospital
[3:46:15.680 --> 3:46:22.240]  she found most of the wards and some of the corridors to be empty she posted it online and
[3:46:22.240 --> 3:46:29.200]  then i think the next morning or the next evening she got a knock on the door from the police apparently
[3:46:29.200 --> 3:46:34.080]  it's a public order offense to film inside a hospital no doubt if she'd have been filming
[3:46:34.080 --> 3:46:39.440]  inside the hospital and be mourning covid and telling everyone to stay at home and supporting
[3:46:39.440 --> 3:46:44.720]  lockdown dare say she wouldn't have been arrested it wasn't the fact that she filmed
[3:46:44.720 --> 3:46:51.200]  inside a hospital it was the fact of what she was saying while filming inside the hospital because
[3:46:51.200 --> 3:46:55.440]  again we now have thought police in the united kingdom who will literally come and
[3:46:56.080 --> 3:47:02.320]  barge into your house if you tweet something which they don't approve of meanwhile queens
[3:47:02.320 --> 3:47:07.200]  Queensland police pay home visit to author who bragged on twitter about covid violating jog
[3:47:08.240 --> 3:47:13.360]  this was a guy in australia who didn't even violate the covid rules he was just making a
[3:47:13.360 --> 3:47:19.040]  joke about it on twitter he actually had a g pass which allowed him to cross between
[3:47:19.680 --> 3:47:26.880]  internal state borders in australia but he joked about how he was quote avoiding the ccp
[3:47:26.880 --> 3:47:34.400]  virus police a huge twitter hate mob complained about it and he also got a knock on the door
[3:47:34.400 --> 3:47:39.760]  from the police so again they're literally policing speech and thought under the guise
[3:47:39.760 --> 3:47:46.560]  of covid restrictions meanwhile u.s national security still believes coronavirus leaked from
[3:47:46.560 --> 3:47:52.160]  chinese lab top u.s national security officials still believe that the most credible theory on
[3:47:52.160 --> 3:47:57.920]  the origin of covid-19 is that it escaped from a chinese laboratory now that's also an example
[3:47:57.920 --> 3:48:03.440]  of something you couldn't say an argument you couldn't make on youtube and especially on twitter
[3:48:03.440 --> 3:48:09.920]  otherwise they'd ban you or at least delete your content but now the washington post is asking
[3:48:09.920 --> 3:48:15.600]  the same question this is out of the daily caller washington post editorial board calls for
[3:48:15.600 --> 3:48:22.560]  investigation into chinese lab theory after dismissing it as a conspiracy theory now the uh
[3:48:22.560 --> 3:48:27.280]  who from what i saw on twitter about an hour ago is just announced that now their people are
[3:48:27.280 --> 3:48:32.480]  being blocked from getting into china to investigate this kind of thing and now the washington post
[3:48:32.480 --> 3:48:37.840]  editorial board is calling for an investigation into the theory the covid-19 leak from chinese
[3:48:37.840 --> 3:48:44.000]  lab after the paper spent time dismissing it as a conspiracy theory so the post and its editorial
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:52.240]  board are now looking into that too we also have this headline nhs requires recently retired doctors
[3:48:52.240 --> 3:48:57.120]  to have diversity training before they're allowed to administer vaccines so the vaccine rollout in
[3:48:57.120 --> 3:49:03.120]  the united kingdom is perhaps deliberately not going very well fewer people than they expected
[3:49:03.120 --> 3:49:09.840]  of being vaccinated and one of the reasons is that retired nurses and doctors applying to administer
[3:49:09.840 --> 3:49:16.160]  these vaccines are being barrage with a paperwork amounting to 14 different documents they have to
[3:49:16.160 --> 3:49:21.920]  file to be allowed to administer vaccines one of which requires them to have diversity training
[3:49:21.920 --> 3:49:28.080]  another which requires them to have radicalization training client world strikes once again
[3:49:28.080 --> 3:49:53.920]  that's going to wrap it up warren coming up next summit dot news don't go away
