[08:18.960 --> 08:25.200]  attempt to expose the global technocrats and their sociology anthropology
[08:25.200 --> 08:32.000]  psychology system that they're using to try to take over what was normal human
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.040]  civilization and rewrite it into a new basically absorbed corporate slave
[08:38.040 --> 08:42.920]  system and that's if you're lucky enough to even be allowed to live every
[08:42.920 --> 08:46.600]  globalist document out there on population says once the world government
[08:46.600 --> 08:53.160]  is truly in place once the quote technocracy is in place the resources
[08:53.160 --> 08:57.680]  will then be systematically shut off all of the hundreds and hundreds of
[08:57.680 --> 09:02.760]  millions killed by the globalists just the last 50 60 years is only a beta test
[09:02.760 --> 09:06.760]  for what's coming general Hamed Gould is reportedly going to be joining us from
[09:06.760 --> 09:10.640]  Pakistan we're working on that right now the country is obviously in complete
[09:10.640 --> 09:15.000]  bedlam Peter Schiff's going to be joining us on the euro implosion and what
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.160]  that's going to mean in the new global super bank Gerald Salento give us
[09:18.160 --> 09:24.080]  updates on MF global foreshadowing bank runs in the future that are inevitable
[09:24.080 --> 09:30.000]  if we continue down this course also medical mafia using financial leverage
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  to enforce children's vaccinations on poor families lying and saying it's the
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.640]  law Bloomberg first reported on 16 billion in missing money now they're
[09:39.640 --> 09:43.160]  reporting on another 13 billion that the Federal Reserve is stolen from
[09:43.160 --> 09:46.960]  taxpayers but they've got Homeland Security in place to make sure we don't
[09:46.960 --> 09:53.360]  bring them to justice all premeditated also continuing we have an article
[09:53.360 --> 09:57.880]  titled Newt Yenrich Mr. New World Order an excellent article by Paul Watson and
[09:57.880 --> 10:02.640]  when I commissioned him to write this this weekend I did my own little report
[10:02.640 --> 10:06.520]  on it yesterday live on the radio I gave him the headline Newt Yenrich Mr. New
[10:06.520 --> 10:12.480]  World Order I think we'll keep that headline at at prismplanet.com but I
[10:12.480 --> 10:18.400]  think we're going to change it on info wars to go even more viral and the
[10:18.400 --> 10:21.440]  article gets a bit into this but perhaps we should have just have another
[10:21.440 --> 10:29.560]  article by Kurt Nemo or someone Newt Yenrich Obama's ringer or system you
[10:29.560 --> 10:39.120]  know Yenrich activated as 2012 Newt Yenrich 2012 Republican ringer deployed
[10:39.120 --> 10:47.560]  something like that because he's a Bob Dole guaranteed guaranteed just like he
[10:47.560 --> 10:53.840]  was a takedown operative of the 94 Patriot takeover and he will do it you
[10:53.840 --> 10:57.840]  can absolutely bet your bottom dollar you see they put forward Perry they're
[10:57.840 --> 11:02.920]  put forward Romney people aren't biting both of them globalist both of them
[11:02.920 --> 11:12.000]  anti-gun carbon tax sanctuary city abortion at least in the past with Perry
[11:12.000 --> 11:20.600]  but he switched Romney still pushes it but as bad as they are remember I told
[11:20.600 --> 11:24.600]  you months ago don't count Yenrich out they'll build him up oh what a smart man
[11:24.600 --> 11:27.800]  I read quotes yesterday in fact I'll dig these back out of the stack later
[11:27.800 --> 11:31.720]  and read them again where he said the end of America the end of the family the
[11:31.720 --> 11:36.600]  end of sovereignty I mean just classic New World Order he was part of this
[11:36.600 --> 11:42.320]  particular future of society that openly calls for global socialism through
[11:42.320 --> 11:51.080]  technology and neocon behavior and I played clips of Al Gore loving him we
[11:51.080 --> 11:56.120]  have clips of that I played clips of Nancy Pelosi loving on him and him
[11:56.120 --> 11:59.960]  endorsing the carbon taxes newt Gennrich I played clips of Bill Clinton
[11:59.960 --> 12:04.600]  lovey-dovey on newt Gennrich I mean you think illegal alien amnesty is bad
[12:04.600 --> 12:11.480]  that's nothing and and we better expose newt Gennrich because Obama is better
[12:11.480 --> 12:16.000]  than newt Gennrich and I'll tell you why Obama's an old shoe
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.000]  Obama's a worn-out tire he was gonna be the Messiah remember the media said he
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.800]  was gonna fix it all not a chicken in every pot a car in every garage
[12:26.800 --> 12:32.200]  free houses everything he was gonna fix it financed by the exact same banksters
[12:32.200 --> 12:38.600]  that ran Bush and Clinton and all the rest of him he was gonna fix it all he
[12:38.600 --> 12:57.480]  was volholic heaven-like a apparition of Mount Olympus shades of heaven nirvana
[12:58.480 --> 13:02.520]  and the bigger they are the harder they fall if he was just there to buy time
[13:02.520 --> 13:09.040]  sucker people and play left off against right so newt Gennrich Obama two peas in
[13:09.040 --> 13:17.360]  a pod but Gennrich I've studied Gennrich closely for now 20 years and I've
[13:17.360 --> 13:23.480]  studied Obama in the last five six and I can tell you now newt Gennrich is far
[13:23.480 --> 13:31.800]  more evil than Barack Obama Barack Obama is a slick teleprompter reading empty
[13:31.800 --> 13:36.960]  suit who likes to smoke cigarettes work out three times a day do a bunch of
[13:36.960 --> 13:46.720]  drugs have a bunch of sex he's a worldly person but and he is wicked but
[13:46.720 --> 13:56.560]  newt Gennrich is a psychopath not a sociopath I've studied him and I went
[13:56.560 --> 14:00.400]  over some of yesterday but multiple wives a wife's dying of cancer he
[14:00.400 --> 14:06.920]  divorces them relishes being mean to them relishes operating as a
[14:06.920 --> 14:12.040]  conservative and as a patriot because he hates us so much he is the ultimate
[14:12.040 --> 14:19.040]  Benedict Arnold and you can also just look in his eyes and his demeanor and
[14:19.040 --> 14:23.640]  all of it he is in his writings about I seek to overthrow the system of the
[14:23.640 --> 14:28.680]  world and create a new system I have the drive with the new age is upon us I am
[14:28.680 --> 14:35.720]  empowered and I will I will rise forth I mean these are public writings this is
[14:35.720 --> 14:44.800]  pure Illuminati initiate by the way I know real illuminate real Illuminati
[14:44.800 --> 14:54.320]  initiates I shouldn't even get into it because as a journalist unless somebody
[14:54.320 --> 14:59.360]  tells me of crimes I'm I'm I'm sworn to not even I gotta just shut my mouth
[14:59.360 --> 15:05.640]  right now I know people that have been in the hellfire club I know people that
[15:05.640 --> 15:11.640]  have been part of the satanic orgies I have talked to high-powered people who
[15:11.640 --> 15:18.400]  have been in the rituals that you see in movies like eyes wide shut minus death
[15:18.400 --> 15:29.520]  they didn't get that far I have obviously been approached ladies and
[15:29.520 --> 15:37.800]  gentlemen you do not know how real this is until you've gotten to the level I
[15:37.800 --> 15:43.240]  have achieved through God's blessings you could also see it as a curse but it's
[15:43.240 --> 15:50.400]  not the devil claims he's here to liberate and empower but he's here to
[15:50.400 --> 15:53.520]  put you into bondage ladies and gentlemen and the Illuminati does not
[15:53.520 --> 16:02.160]  bring enlightenment or empowerment it brings pain it brings enslavement I
[16:02.160 --> 16:05.360]  belong to an organization that doesn't have a building and doesn't have a
[16:05.360 --> 16:09.440]  membership it's people that love liberty and love freedom with all their hearts
[16:09.440 --> 16:14.200]  and all their might and who want to be good people and who want to raise their
[16:14.200 --> 16:22.360]  children to be straight and strong and good and I pray here publicly that God
[16:22.360 --> 16:27.320]  give me the strength not be worldly and to be good and to steady my mind and my
[16:27.320 --> 16:33.560]  focus so that I might be an instrument to raise up the good and bring down the
[16:33.560 --> 16:38.240]  bad and I pray that others will say that prayer with me because there are no
[16:38.240 --> 16:42.880]  atheists in foxholes and make no mistake there's a war on for your mind your body
[16:42.880 --> 16:48.680]  your soul your property and most importantly your progeny the system
[16:48.680 --> 16:54.080]  wants their minds wants their intellects wants to fashion them and we just
[16:54.080 --> 16:59.040]  turn our children over to all the toxic food and the TV and the culture and the
[16:59.040 --> 17:09.720]  public schools and the vaccines and all of it I am trying to really transform
[17:09.720 --> 17:14.520]  myself and I that's why I get into spiritual issues because I cannot
[17:14.520 --> 17:24.720]  contain the fact that that is where I am in my life I am weak we're all weak but
[17:24.720 --> 17:28.360]  we're strong through God and we've got to ask for that strength and you're not
[17:28.360 --> 17:33.040]  going to find that strength in one of these establishment churches you're
[17:33.040 --> 17:41.600]  going to find it in your heart and at 3 a.m. in a personal relationship with the
[17:41.600 --> 17:46.520]  spirit of creation with the God of the universe with the Creator you can have
[17:46.520 --> 17:50.320]  whatever names you want you have a relationship with it you know it's real
[17:50.320 --> 17:55.480]  those that don't have a relationship with it they don't understand and that is
[17:55.480 --> 18:01.760]  a great curse to them and they will never have the deep discernment they will
[18:01.760 --> 18:09.120]  never have the deep understanding and that's sad but some people you just
[18:09.120 --> 18:17.880]  can't reach and I'm not here to reach those that can't be reached I'm here for
[18:17.880 --> 18:28.960]  a lot of reasons just as we all are I'm here on my own journey in my own test

[24:20.480 --> 24:27.080]  curtain emma also al-qaeda terrorist airlifted from libya to aid syrian
[24:27.080 --> 24:33.000]  opposition that is publicly admitted remember the video and BBC of the al-qaeda
[24:33.000 --> 24:38.160]  forces literal al-qaeda with the big sign saying syria here we come and they'll
[24:38.160 --> 24:42.360]  blow that country to kingdom come and murder people in mass and it'll be hailed
[24:42.360 --> 24:47.560]  by our sickening degenerate system that is so wicked they have al-qaeda working
[24:47.560 --> 24:52.440]  for them publicly while saying they have tsa pedophiles sticking their hands
[24:52.440 --> 24:56.160]  down our pants to keep us safe from al-qaeda and they get the shoe bomber on
[24:56.160 --> 25:00.080]  the plane and the christmas bomber and every other one I mean it's just
[25:00.080 --> 25:05.800]  totally staged on record they ship the opn and public criminal government just
[25:05.800 --> 25:16.520]  in your face wow also the financial times of London is saying the eurozone has
[25:16.520 --> 25:20.440]  10 days left at most if you don't give the bankers total power and then you'll
[25:20.440 --> 25:24.680]  give them tens of trillions more in a takeover and oh that'll be collapsing and
[25:24.680 --> 25:28.880]  making America collapse so they'll have to merge and have a global restructuring
[25:28.880 --> 25:35.600]  OECD bank how many times have I told you this I saw a video this weekend of
[25:35.600 --> 25:39.320]  Nigel Farage we got to get back on remember the EU Parliament out of
[25:39.320 --> 25:43.400]  England and he showed him going back years ago predicting how they would
[25:43.400 --> 25:46.760]  stage the crisis how they would do it and then it showed the new video clips
[25:46.760 --> 25:50.520]  in fact I want to get that and kind of re-edit it together to be shorter and
[25:50.520 --> 25:55.360]  play it on the nightly news tonight or tomorrow but there's just some of the
[25:55.360 --> 26:00.200]  news on that front but then look at all this other news finally people are
[26:00.200 --> 26:03.640]  starting to get it you know we had this article out a few days ago Senate moves
[26:03.640 --> 26:08.040]  to allow military to intern Americans without trial in DAA detention
[26:08.040 --> 26:12.400]  revision would turn Americans into battlefield turn the whole country into
[26:12.400 --> 26:16.400]  a battlefield now it says don't worry though only if you're fighting against
[26:16.400 --> 26:21.200]  the US government or other designation will you be secretly arrested and
[26:21.200 --> 26:26.240]  taken to a camp and citizens are exempt until you read the other provision that
[26:26.240 --> 26:31.160]  says unless the military prescribes because you're fighting and people try
[26:31.160 --> 26:34.840]  to spin it say it doesn't say that Ron Paul's wrong Alex Jones is wrong the
[26:34.840 --> 26:38.760]  ACLU is wrong all these groups have come out and said that's what it says I know
[26:38.760 --> 26:47.000]  how to read okay and then they try to spin it and so they don't do that oh
[26:47.000 --> 26:52.680]  really they only kill American citizens if they choose without a trial or a
[26:52.680 --> 26:56.840]  rest now people say well why don't they want the intelligence come on folks they
[26:56.840 --> 27:00.640]  didn't really kill and we're all lucky they just set the precedent I predicted
[27:00.640 --> 27:04.160]  he'd be killed when it came out he was secretly hanging out the Pentagon he's
[27:04.160 --> 27:08.480]  no good to run al-Qaeda anymore once that came out to the lower level jihadis
[27:08.480 --> 27:11.960]  that actually think they're fighting the great Satan and not working for it
[27:11.960 --> 27:16.160]  America's not the great Satan but the global bankers that run this country and
[27:16.160 --> 27:20.600]  run al-Qaeda are get it through your heads police and military and others
[27:20.600 --> 27:28.000]  it's called full spectrum dominance just research any intelligence operation
[27:28.000 --> 27:35.720]  research any modern war in the last 300 years the bankers fund all sides
[27:35.720 --> 27:39.960]  sometimes four or five factions they always win they've taken it one step
[27:39.960 --> 27:47.160]  further they actually go out and create the opposition and have publications to
[27:47.160 --> 27:51.240]  even create their own hatred then they come over here manipulate us and it's
[27:51.240 --> 27:55.160]  all public and I'm not playing along just because it's fun to hate men with
[27:55.160 --> 27:59.080]  beards and turbans on their heads if you rednecks actually went over and
[27:59.080 --> 28:02.360]  actually hung out with those people in Afghanistan you'd like them I've talked
[28:02.360 --> 28:06.120]  to the soldiers that are over there they're more redneck more backwoods more
[28:06.120 --> 28:09.840]  hillbilly than you could ever imagine they like guns more than your granddaddy
[28:09.840 --> 28:18.280]  did shut up and stop being stupid stop being idiots stop being morons they're
[28:18.280 --> 28:21.800]  building us up to have a war with these people so the globalists can destroy
[28:21.800 --> 28:29.400]  both sides I'm not going along with it but finally even alternate the big
[28:29.400 --> 28:33.160]  liberal system can't believe their lord Obama I remember one alternate and
[28:33.160 --> 28:36.040]  others criticized me for saying they wanted to use troops on the streets of
[28:36.040 --> 28:41.040]  America years ago but oh goody-goody gun drops how could this happen in America
[28:41.040 --> 28:49.360]  why are police treating Americans like military threats by William Hoglund and
[28:49.360 --> 28:52.920]  then it goes on to talk about the militaries involved in homeland
[28:52.920 --> 28:57.320]  securities taking over why that's not constitutional why our precious federal
[28:57.320 --> 29:01.920]  government it's not supposed to take over the states what's happening here I

[35:58.120 --> 36:02.600]  done they of course cloned it and spliced it with their animals and other
[36:02.600 --> 36:05.840]  plants and insects depending on the variant this is an incredible
[36:05.840 --> 36:11.080]  documentary incredible and it's available at info wars com scientists under
[36:11.080 --> 36:15.840]  attack genetic engineering in the magnetic field of money incredible how
[36:15.840 --> 36:18.720]  they've tried to shut things down and then you want to know what goes on at
[36:18.720 --> 36:24.240]  Guantanamo Bay and how they literally manufacture terrorists out of the group
[36:24.240 --> 36:28.440]  to be triple agents and how they torture these people outside the law
[36:28.440 --> 36:32.320]  stories from Guantanamo now they beta tested this for the rest of the American
[36:32.320 --> 36:37.200]  people a film by Polly Nash and Andy Worthington another very powerful film

[37:09.000 --> 37:12.480]  name it also I don't know how long I'm gonna do this because we've had to hire
[37:12.480 --> 37:16.800]  a couple more people and it's become actually we're actually losing money on
[37:16.800 --> 37:20.680]  it I obviously can't do that because we got to continue to fund our operation and
[37:20.680 --> 37:24.600]  expand it hopefully but the end game goal is to get the word out is why I've
[37:24.600 --> 37:27.840]  done it I've got a bunch of special packages going where we sell popper
[37:27.840 --> 37:36.280]  stickers at cost and I'm still not gonna bring into the price they were because
[37:36.280 --> 37:40.040]  that wasn't high but but we did make a profit off of it and I think it was
[37:40.040 --> 37:43.720]  prohibitive for people to get a bunch of them but I am gonna go up in the new
[37:43.720 --> 37:47.600]  year on the price of the bumper stickers a little bit right now we're
[37:47.600 --> 37:51.120]  actually it's more than a loss leader we are losing money on it a loss leader
[37:51.120 --> 37:54.440]  supposed to be breaking even so if you want to get those please get them get
[37:54.440 --> 37:58.640]  them out to people post them in public but legal places obviously check your
[37:58.640 --> 38:03.200]  local laws you don't want to do like the founding fathers did and actually post
[38:03.200 --> 38:07.480]  bulletins up everywhere and posted on government buildings and things against
[38:07.480 --> 38:10.960]  the Redcoats we don't do that now because the founding fathers were bad
[38:10.960 --> 38:16.600]  FEMA has taught us so post this only in legal and lawful areas we got 100 packs
[38:16.600 --> 38:22.320]  25 packs you name it at NFL wars dot com and if you believe in what we're

[39:32.520 --> 39:38.360]  exhausting our funds with that we are so we can then get everything fixed it's
[39:38.360 --> 39:43.800]  working pretty good but fixed and then move on to launching all sorts of free
[39:43.800 --> 39:49.840]  apps and paid apps and other goodies we're a factory of resistance an armory
[39:49.840 --> 39:55.480]  of resistance we're in here forging the weapons ah but when you support us and do
[39:55.480 --> 40:04.360]  your Christmas shopping that helps us continue to expand what we're doing and
[40:04.360 --> 40:09.960]  don't take talk radio for granted don't take the fact that I'm on XM for
[40:09.960 --> 40:12.680]  granted because it's starting to get big ratings and who knows what the
[40:12.680 --> 40:18.480]  establishment will do so let XM know that you're buying XM this holiday season
[40:18.480 --> 40:21.720]  or getting one of the portable units they got a special going this week a
[40:21.720 --> 40:26.120]  reason I know is I'm going to get one from the office I'm addicted to XM and
[40:26.120 --> 40:31.200]  serious and by the way Bill they've got a special running right now I forget the
[40:31.200 --> 40:36.080]  name of the unit but I want to get it's like their special deluxe channel
[40:36.080 --> 40:40.400]  portable radio I want one in the office maybe two like like one back there in
[40:40.400 --> 40:44.360]  that area then one here plus it's good for Intel be able to go through all
[40:44.360 --> 40:49.600]  the channels but I want to I want the company to get two of those and
[40:49.600 --> 40:53.680]  obviously if it's more for a company to get them I'll just put it on my on my
[40:53.680 --> 40:58.400]  little slave tracker card but don't let me forget I want two of those XM systems
[40:58.400 --> 41:04.040]  okay continuing here ladies and gentlemen a little plug for XM because
[41:04.040 --> 41:14.560]  but on their two years we were on the weekend and at night and live I couldn't
[41:14.560 --> 41:17.480]  believe it when they first put us on there but but again it shows that we've
[41:17.480 --> 41:23.880]  got a lot of friends in high places plus humans are designed to put a winner on
[41:23.880 --> 41:27.800]  the field not that I'm perfect but when it comes to talk radio we're winners and
[41:27.800 --> 41:32.320]  we're the best kind of winners underdog winners because that's what humanity is
[41:32.320 --> 41:36.560]  an underdog winner it's only one word down that we learn how to get up all
[41:36.560 --> 41:40.800]  right I'm gonna stop being a football coach here and just give you a
[41:40.800 --> 41:47.400]  smattering of some of the headlines then go to your calls let me just start I never
[41:47.400 --> 41:49.960]  know where to start I don't get to any of it let me just start here and just
[41:49.960 --> 41:54.640]  read headlines daily mail Pakistan gives America two-week ultimatum to
[41:54.640 --> 41:59.160]  abandoned secret airbase and closes border into Afghanistan which is
[41:59.160 --> 42:04.680]  devastating to the overall opium harvesting operation over there they'll
[42:04.680 --> 42:09.840]  say to the war effort enduring freedom yes the opium go will come out forever to
[42:09.840 --> 42:14.880]  you and your family and if the cops get your kid using it in the slammer they
[42:14.880 --> 42:19.000]  got hunting dogs ready to take down your little rabbit so keep your little
[42:19.000 --> 42:27.080]  rabbit away from their goods hundreds of afghan bound supply truck lines
[42:27.680 --> 42:34.640]  hundreds of afghan bound supply trucks line up as tensions mount this is the
[42:34.640 --> 42:38.800]  new globalist system where they even bomb their allies and of course why is
[42:38.800 --> 42:43.000]  all this happening to the nuclear power Pakistan Pakistan orders us to leave
[42:43.000 --> 42:51.400]  airbase in fight over deadly NATO assault Islamabad says us must leave
[42:51.400 --> 42:57.040]  some sea base in 15 days after deaths of at least 24 Pakistani soldiers in
[42:57.040 --> 43:02.880]  mistaken attack Pakistan has given the US 15 days to vacate the airbase used as
[43:02.880 --> 43:09.360]  the key launch pad for drone strikes in Afghanistan in rendition for a mistaken
[43:09.360 --> 43:13.200]  attack and retaliation for a mistaken attack on Pakistani border outposts
[43:13.200 --> 43:17.040]  that killed at least 24 soldiers and injured 13 and that's happened what three
[43:17.040 --> 43:22.400]  times the last year American forces were told to leave the remote airbase
[43:22.400 --> 43:26.440]  recently given over to the US over 9-11 following an emergency meeting of
[43:26.440 --> 43:30.160]  Pakistani's top civilian and military leadership late on Saturday and why
[43:30.160 --> 43:34.480]  because the country is on the verge of total overthrow the globalists are
[43:34.480 --> 43:38.720]  doing a balance to enrage the radicals well they've been caught funding al-qaeda
[43:38.720 --> 43:42.760]  in the country that's come out CIA guy trying to get nuclear material to people
[43:42.760 --> 43:46.320]  so they could frame the government while at the same time the government
[43:46.320 --> 43:50.200]  they're via payoffs tries to hold on to power and says please stop they're gonna
[43:50.200 --> 43:55.360]  overthrow us they're like that's the plan and then we'll carpet bomb all of you
[43:55.360 --> 44:00.720]  and send in special forces to get the nukes and we'll bring al-qaeda in after
[44:00.720 --> 44:05.760]  that and our public will give up their rights in fear of al-qaeda and the whole
[44:05.760 --> 44:09.680]  world's life but that doesn't make any sense you're the terrorist our public
[44:09.680 --> 44:18.600]  will not wake up to that they've drunk deep of the fluoride continuing the base
[44:18.600 --> 44:22.520]  was used heavily for launching the war in Afghanistan in 01 and later servers
[44:22.520 --> 44:26.520]  the base for us drone program which bombs the Pakistanis themselves said
[44:26.520 --> 44:30.920]  in sparsely populated desert in the western province it's a highly
[44:30.920 --> 44:35.480]  controversial within Pakistan for its association with drones which go around
[44:35.480 --> 44:42.400]  killing whole villages and hold groups to kill quote one al-qaeda continuing
[44:42.400 --> 44:49.080]  Pakistanis burn Obama effigy and us flag oh they hate America that's so
[44:49.080 --> 44:54.360]  pathetic that that's why occasionally I try to go on Pakistani TV or radio and
[44:54.360 --> 44:58.560]  I can have English speaking language explain you want to burn effigies of
[44:58.560 --> 45:04.600]  the Federal Reserve in the pyramid we're occupied just like you that flag and
[45:04.600 --> 45:08.920]  what it symbolizes not what it's been appropriated for would never do things
[45:08.920 --> 45:17.400]  that are happening now down with NATO they chanted down with NATO Yankees go
[45:17.400 --> 45:23.120]  back so I mean they know some of what's going on continuing NATO races for
[45:23.120 --> 45:27.320]  reprisals that were deadly airstrike on Pakistan border post concerns the ISI
[45:27.320 --> 45:30.880]  intelligence agency uses suspected influence over insurgent groups to
[45:30.880 --> 45:36.720]  launch reprisal attacks see and now the globalists will probably attack
[45:36.720 --> 45:39.960]  themselves and say the government did it when it's on record that the al-qaeda
[45:39.960 --> 45:46.360]  groups are globalists run it's incredible I think I have an article here in my
[45:46.360 --> 45:50.040]  stack here it is al-qaeda terrorist this is Paul Joseph Watson links to the
[45:50.040 --> 45:54.480]  telegraph another mainstream news admitting it we'll show you document
[45:54.480 --> 45:59.800]  camera this bad boy al-qaeda terrorist airlifted from Libya to aid Syrian
[45:59.800 --> 46:06.280]  opposition weapons and fighters sent to support overthrow a president Assad and
[46:06.280 --> 46:10.120]  it goes through the whole report I'll get to that later but right now let's go
[46:10.120 --> 46:14.880]  to your calls then I'll get into Ohio puts 200 pound third grader in foster
[46:14.880 --> 46:19.560]  care some will say well that child's too big
[46:21.640 --> 46:25.560]  once you give into the nanny state it's over because according to the Department
[46:25.560 --> 46:29.400]  of Education others they say of your child is 1% over body weight in the
[46:29.400 --> 46:34.000]  future they will be taken and what they say is the regular body weight is
[46:34.000 --> 46:41.760]  basically chicken-necked see this is all about slavery and this is a key and
[46:41.760 --> 46:48.360]  I'm gonna go to your calls slavery never went away the system now just enslaves
[46:48.360 --> 46:53.320]  everybody and they they set up weird little tricks and use morality against
[46:53.320 --> 46:58.520]  us when you make drugs illegal it puts money into it it makes it popular it
[46:58.520 --> 47:02.400]  makes it avant-garde it makes it risque young people then want to use it you
[47:02.400 --> 47:08.280]  have Hollywood advertise it is racy then the banks get an unofficial tax tens of
[47:08.280 --> 47:15.320]  trillions globally every few years in the aggregate $500 billion a year alone in
[47:15.320 --> 47:21.000]  the US and narcotics on record you then corrupt police corrupt the society but
[47:21.000 --> 47:27.360]  what is the drug war you put chemicals out there while the very same banks
[47:27.360 --> 47:31.880]  subsidiary drug companies put out hundreds of other even just as deadly or
[47:31.880 --> 47:35.800]  more deadly synthetic systems and then you get addicted to that and then when
[47:35.800 --> 47:39.120]  you get addicted and can't get it later they imprison you for that it's all
[47:39.120 --> 47:43.240]  puppet master behavior and they're coming out with super drugs for total
[47:43.240 --> 47:48.600]  control now but Philip K. Dick wrote about the scanner dark link that I of
[47:48.600 --> 47:56.160]  course am a minor thespian in Richard Linklater film came out a few years ago
[47:56.160 --> 48:03.160]  with Tommy Pilata the point is watch that film and wake up it's a way to
[48:03.160 --> 48:07.960]  enslave you it's like putting corn out and deer come out and you shoot them and
[48:07.960 --> 48:15.520]  you say they read my corn they bring the drugs in they profit from it and then
[48:15.520 --> 48:19.000]  when you're stupid enough to use it it's their excuse to imprison you I never
[48:19.000 --> 48:23.400]  told the whole story but but to tell it briefly and then go to break I and then
[48:23.400 --> 48:28.680]  in this little story will be the statement I want to make you'll nugget
[48:28.680 --> 48:33.240]  that I've said before in different ways but it's important I'm driving along 330

[50:38.000 --> 50:40.840]  gave me the warning which is also a psych warfare deal even though he hasn't
[50:40.840 --> 50:44.160]  been told they're giving lots of warnings now to make people psychologically
[50:44.160 --> 50:47.960]  think before even bigger revenue generation and nitpicking operation that
[50:47.960 --> 50:52.400]  you were warned the point is they set all this up as an excuse to make us slaves

[54:06.160 --> 54:11.280]  show because there's a war on for your mind
[54:11.280 --> 54:38.920]  ok ladies and gentlemen we are back live
[54:38.920 --> 54:45.720]  it's just such an epiphany for me and I know I know it I know you know it but
[54:45.720 --> 54:50.480]  you know something you already know really hits you that this system is
[54:50.480 --> 54:55.160]  consciously evil it's got all these well-meaning people working for it the
[54:55.160 --> 55:00.120]  average cop's like a hunter they're just out hunting for infractions and yeah
[55:00.120 --> 55:04.600]  they know it's revenue but if you don't do it the whole system will become lawless
[55:04.600 --> 55:10.960]  and oh what are we gonna do the point is when you are out there nickel and
[55:10.960 --> 55:15.720]  diming people for no reason and wanting to search their cars and stuff while the
[55:15.720 --> 55:21.820]  whole government at the top is engaged in massive crimes it is a abomination it
[55:21.820 --> 55:29.360]  is a fraud and that cop was going what's in that bundle well what's going on
[55:29.360 --> 55:33.000]  here what's going on there and I'm just like you're just trying to make me feel
[55:33.000 --> 55:40.400]  like I'm the bad guy is subconsciously probably it's all about and all these
[55:40.400 --> 55:43.360]  signs where the cops are standing there on billboards going we're going out
[55:43.360 --> 55:47.360]  tonight don't drink and drive and and and all the PSAs it's all about how
[55:47.360 --> 55:51.440]  government cares about you and government can be trusted but you can't
[55:51.440 --> 55:58.720]  and I'm just like you know what I don't even really speed anymore I very rarely
[55:58.720 --> 56:02.040]  I'll be out on some country road and we'll open it up and then I'm afraid of
[56:02.040 --> 56:06.520]  deer I've got my children to take care of I've got a operation against the
[56:06.520 --> 56:09.960]  globalists to take care of so I even though I like to drive 150 miles an
[56:09.960 --> 56:13.120]  hour I don't even do that anymore
[56:17.920 --> 56:26.320]  I don't even do it twice a year I'm not doing anything wrong I'm good you're bad
[56:26.320 --> 56:34.960]  you were for a certifiable verified tyranny and they act like oh it's
[56:34.960 --> 56:41.120]  Obama doing it oh it's Bush doing it those are nothing puppets we've got a
[56:41.120 --> 56:45.000]  sick globalist oligarchy running our country I'm gonna stop ranting now and
[56:45.000 --> 56:50.240]  go to your calls it's just we're in trouble it isn't gonna get better it's
[56:50.240 --> 56:56.120]  gonna get worse and those silly little police officers they're having their
[56:56.120 --> 56:59.480]  future destroyed by this just like we all are and I thought about cops a lot
[56:59.480 --> 57:05.360]  because in every tyranny there were the rubber meets the road and they've got a
[57:05.360 --> 57:10.160]  tough job as well a lot of them aren't bad people but they're so brainwashed
[57:10.160 --> 57:14.440]  like everybody else and if they could just know what I knew but they've got a
[57:14.440 --> 57:20.480]  want to know like when I had the FBI here one time and I said you don't know
[57:20.480 --> 57:24.040]  about all this I was talking about Oklahoma City and government
[57:24.040 --> 57:28.280]  sterilization and and the FBI guy says no I don't know and I don't want to know
[57:28.280 --> 57:32.960]  and I had his attention and I right then I had no respect oh you don't want to
[57:32.960 --> 57:38.120]  know like you denial this is going on so it just goes away you're like somebody
[57:38.120 --> 57:41.160]  saying well it looks like my neighbors burying something in their backyard looks
[57:41.160 --> 57:44.720]  like a body but I'm just gonna live in denial about that that makes you a
[57:44.720 --> 57:52.000]  necessity you make me sick but we got it so good in this country alright let's
[57:52.000 --> 57:55.840]  start with Corey in North Carolina you got about a minute Corey go ahead we'll
[57:55.840 --> 58:00.040]  be loaded immediately and you can go ahead and process your file as soon as
[58:00.040 --> 58:06.280]  that is all yeah he's he's taking another call or doing something else guys
[58:06.280 --> 58:08.640]  calling him while he's at work he's telling someone you can go ahead and
[58:08.640 --> 58:13.760]  process your file while you do that we'll go back to him later whatever be
[58:13.760 --> 58:18.760]  glad you got a talk show host it's so wound up and cares so much about knowing
[58:18.760 --> 58:24.680]  reality that most talk show hosts lean on callers lean on clips lean on guests
[58:24.680 --> 58:28.960]  not us we have guests on because I want to hear what they have to say and bounce
[58:28.960 --> 58:32.040]  my ideas off of them
[58:33.160 --> 58:40.240]  look I can't stand people not knowing reality it's just it's frustrating

[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:36.520]  Alex Jones I'm looking at an article from CBS News Adams County sued over
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:45.240]  death man held for 25 days incredible I'm gonna get to this later man now even
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.320]  though when it's on video you don't touch cops they charge you with assault
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:53.000]  he didn't understand the police they of course grabbed him and of course they
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.280]  charged him with assaulting him and they held him for 25 days because they didn't
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:01.840]  have an interpreter they just throw you in dungeons now and waddle off such a
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:07.480]  crook government don't all you crooks understand that once crooks take over
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:12.560]  everything falls apart because none of you will you'll all just be s each other
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:18.000]  forever let's go to Tate in Detroit Tate you're on the air thanks for
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.120]  holding hey Alex love you man I'm gonna have to disagree with you I don't want
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:26.720]  you to get worked up and ruin the rest of the show but I really think that you
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:30.520]  missed an opportunity to educate the arts and minds of people on Occupy Wall
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:35.800]  Street by not being involved in it there is a massive disgruntled people there
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:40.200]  that no Wall Street has taken over the country in a fast fashion dictatorship
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.240]  the problem is is that their solutions are flawed and I think that if you and
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.600]  many other prominent libertarians would have gotten involved that we could
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:52.600]  actually change the dialogue and actually get an educated response on what we
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:57.520]  could do in this new system well Tate here's the problem a I don't agree with
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:03.160]  your characterization what happened with occupied Wall Street is Ron Paul
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:08.400]  stuff's not allowed info or signs are torn down the leadership of it is George
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:15.320]  Sorosine Sorosian and is Obamanoid and it's a very diverse group and we've
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:21.160]  made videos reports had him on covered it reached out to them with the facts and
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:24.400]  I mean I've had my reporters down there in Austin and they say you don't come
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.960]  down here with a Ron Paul sign get out of here they're literally going get out
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:36.640]  of here get out of here we're banned off the Occupy Wall Street website so I mean
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:41.400]  what do you say to that tape why is the media still against these people and
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:46.760]  calling them dirty and name-calling and and actually it's a full spectrum
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:53.520]  dominance dialectic sir it's a manipulation the globalist call for
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.440]  the revolution because they know there's already about to be a real one they
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:01.920]  make it against capitalism a diverse group shows up the establishment goes
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.960]  in infiltrates it tries to take control of it on one end from the left while
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.640]  also demonizing protest by demonizing him on the other hand it's a full
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:18.080]  spectrum analysis a full spectrum attack many others would disagree with
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:25.920]  you do what Kaiser and and not and Salante would disagree with you many
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.880]  other prominent people would disagree with you that this is an actual genuine
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:33.520]  uprising against a dictatorship that's Wall Street control well listen I have
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:41.440]  those guys on the show but I mean I had been in the final equation I follow my
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.200]  counsel I don't really brag about myself but you know I'm my elevator goes all
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:50.920]  the way to the top my head screwed on straight and I built something pretty
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:54.720]  substantive here with my understanding of things I have other people on because
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:00.200]  I find them interesting and want their perspective but again you also kind of
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:05.520]  Salante overall says this is the beginning of a revolution and overall
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.440]  it's good I agree with that that's the same thing Kaiser says but he also
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.680]  admits that it's been infiltrated I mean they're calling for an end of
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:18.000]  capitalism that's what the bankers want I mean it's on record that Obama and
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.280]  Soros and others are in there running this and move on or and I said that
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.280]  months ago and it's still true I'm right I mean I mean it's easy to just say hey I
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:33.480]  love Occupy Wall Street you're great but again I threw out issues of them going
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:37.800]  after my free speech others free speech you have nothing to say to that I said
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:42.880]  there's a decent diverse group but the system put the group called the group to
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.480]  be there people showed up they were already upset you just don't understand
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.840]  what I'm saying tape and you sound like a smart guy so I don't think you're
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.440]  trying to understand what I'm saying okay but a good the good news is you're
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.040]  out there you can you can you can get out there and educate them then well they're
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:04.360]  right back stay with us hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:09.360]  last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:13.160]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the

[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.280]  Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.800]  properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.480]  prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for free
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:38.000]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.080]  eye-opener I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this free video
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.480]  online today he explains everything you need to know

[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:06.000]  this communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:25.120]  a lot of incredible things are obviously happening right now
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.280]  I'm reading trilateral commission documents from the 1970s where they
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:32.000]  said they would create the three economic unions implode them through
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.840]  derivatives and out of that currency crisis merge them
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:40.640]  well now they're announcing a bank of the world a financial union in europe
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.920]  to unify everything and to be able to send
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:48.320]  literal military-style police in to to raise the money
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.520]  and get rid of all sovereignty that's left and they have the nerve to spin it
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:56.320]  as it's like a united states of america really united states of america with
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.920]  unelected socialist globalist bureaucrats that make
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.520]  70 plus percent of the laws for england even though they're not members
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:09.440]  where england can't vote on even getting out of it and never voted to get in
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.400]  and most the country's never allowed votes when they do they vote to get out
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.240]  and then it's a tiny group of elite banks making all the other free market
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:21.600]  systems look bad with their own publications like the economist in
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:27.200]  time magazine blaming the free market for what they have done
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.640]  and the uneducated public in many respects is falling for it look at
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:34.560]  occupy wall street generally not the whole group but the leaders of it
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:41.440]  they're saying capitalism did this no capitalism didn't create unfair nafta
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.200]  and gat deals capitalism didn't ship our jobs overseas
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.120]  to sweetheart communist dictatorships where they put taxes on us and
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:53.040]  tax breaks to leave that's on a level playing field
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.120]  free market didn't give 16 plus trillion and then some and other bailouts
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:02.400]  to offshore banks in europe and now they're gonna
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.640]  raise the taxes cut the benefits and austerity and blame capitalism for it
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.560]  incredible joining us to talk about this and mf global and more
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:14.720]  is peter schiff the ceo of euro pacific
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:18.400]  capital author of how an economy grows and why it crashes
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:22.800]  and hosts the peter schiff show right here on the gc n radio network
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.200]  euro pac.net is the website of course we just joined us i'm alex jones of
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.520]  info wars dot com and info wars nightly news at prison planet dot tv
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:36.080]  where peter's also joined us recently uh peter schiff so much is happening now
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.760]  we're talking about total europe implosion just to hold folks hostage to
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.880]  get this new power grab but even if the system gets that
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:46.960]  where is it going what's happening you predicted much of what is now unfolding
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:51.040]  and how does this tie into the loss of confidence in commodities markets
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.720]  due to the mf global situation now over three billion
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.480]  i don't know how much you can connect mf global
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.400]  to europe other than the fact that it was its bad bets on european bonds that
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.120]  ultimately led to its demise but i suppose
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.080]  if it wasn't european bonds it could have been something else that they were
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.360]  speculating with but you know the the most disturbing part about it is they
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.160]  were using customer funds and of course you know
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.720]  it's joe john corezine former governor a former us senator
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.680]  that was the the mastermind behind mf global he was running it he ran it in
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:28.240]  the bankruptcy and it's very scary because he is the guy that designed
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:32.640]  president obama's economic policy as if it actually needed somebody to design
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.880]  it i mean a little kid could have thought it up
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:38.240]  but the fact that it was come up that it was a corezine who
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:42.000]  i guess his plan is going to do for america what it did for mf global that's
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.760]  a pretty uh pretty scary proposition but i don't know i don't know how this is
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.280]  all going to shake out in the short run in europe the problem is they got too much
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:52.080]  debt they got too much debt because they got too much government
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.880]  and one of the reasons that governments were able to borrow a lot of money is
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:58.720]  because interest rates were very low for a while you know during the most of the
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.920]  last decade the fed had interest rates very low
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.600]  as a result of that all the other countries had low interest rates
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.880]  and europe in particular when you brought a lot of these weaker economies
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:12.560]  like italy and spain and portugal and greece
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:17.280]  into the eurozone they got a big drop in interest rates because historically
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.480]  if the italians wanted to borrow money or the greeks wanted to borrow money it
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:24.080]  was expensive because people knew they were going to get paid back in drachma
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.960]  or lira and they knew there was going to be a lot of inflation
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:31.040]  but all of a sudden when they had the euro bond the bond market was much more
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.840]  confident so the italians and the greeks and you know
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:37.600]  were able to borrow a lot more money uh than they could have in the past and
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:42.000]  that's exactly what we did and now uh they're paying the price
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.560]  for all that debt but we've got a similar situation we've got even more
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:51.600]  debt we're going to have to pay the same price it's just a question of time
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:56.240]  now peter continuing going back to mf global uh i've seen numbers in the news
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:59.840]  of he was betting 40 to 1 i've seen numbers in bloomberg of
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.040]  100 to 1 regardless then i saw the media going back
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:07.920]  two weeks ago or more spin it that okay they took gerald solente six plus
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.960]  figures and now 50 000 other people's money and
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:15.440]  they're going to keep some people's segregated accounts 100 percent
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.560]  and then others they're going to you know give them 60 percent back but none of
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.840]  that's really started to happen and now people are asking
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:25.040]  where's the money first they said jp morgan had it
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.400]  and you know as you pointed out we actually have found the video clip
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.520]  of going back three years ago right after obama got elected
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:35.760]  they sent the vice president biden over to new jersey
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.680]  and he's sitting there at the podium with corezine saying thank god when we were
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.240]  talking about having to have bank closures and
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:46.080]  and uh you know uh reevaluations you know uh
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.920]  thank god that uh you know bank holiday was the word thank god you were there
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.720]  advising us on our current plan so when you say
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.560]  he's the top advisor and then he's a guy at the roulette wheel
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:01.120]  not even betting on you know a bunch of spots all the money but what one number
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:06.960]  i mean it it's lunacy it is scary yeah well what was his plan how did he
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.240]  how did the corezine were on mf global it was lever up
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:13.920]  bet big even with other people's money and just hope for the best
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.600]  that's the obama plan that describes it right there borrow a bunch of money
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.200]  other people's money make a big leverage bet on government on
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:24.640]  socialism and hope but you know we already know it
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.280]  doesn't work you know i i'm i show today which you know we do it
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.120]  it's shivraya.com is where i do the show i went over the story of the
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.440]  pilgrims because a lot of people forget that america started as a socialist
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:40.960]  commune and we became capitalists once uh the socialism produced famine and
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.720]  almost destroyed all this yeah more than half of them died in one year
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:48.320]  yeah they they died because it was from each according to his ability to each
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.440]  according to his need it was everybody was in the one percent
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:54.960]  because there was no 99 percent everybody was equal and so they were
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:58.000]  equally starving and it wasn't until they abandoned
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.240]  socialism and embraced capitalism uh that they actually started to prosper
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:05.520]  and they produced enough food to actually have a Thanksgiving so
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:09.440]  what Thanksgiving really celebrates is that the our ancestors
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.920]  the the first settlers were smart enough to abandon socialism and embrace
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.760]  capitalism was crazy is that here we are hundreds of years later
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.000]  going in the opposite direction trying to repeat the failed experiment that
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.360]  almost killed the the pilgrims well said so so first it was 600
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:30.160]  million then 700 then a billion then 1.2 then
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:33.200]  3 billion now they're saying it could be more than
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:37.120]  3 billion of the 6.5 or whatever they went bankrupt with
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:42.000]  uh i mean you've got 130 plus employees you've got a pretty big you know firm
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  yourself you've been successful in investing looking at you know somebody
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.400]  who's obviously much bigger than you are and much
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:52.880]  former head of Goldman Sachs i mean it does sound like they're insane
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:56.960]  to 40 to 100 to 1 whatever it really was 10 to 1 is insane
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.560]  so so so so what is them what is the mindset of these people
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:05.360]  or is there a plan to just go ahead and was he making bad bets to somebody
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.160]  else in an inside deal to let them keep the money
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:11.360]  yeah well again they have very different business model than me see i don't
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:14.880]  have any debt at all so i don't gamble let you know even
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:18.480]  with my own money let alone somebody else's money or my client's money so i
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:22.560]  just make fees i charge commissions or fees for my services so
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.720]  there's no there's there's no risk there to my
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:29.760]  solvency but what what mfglobal was doing was proprietary trading
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.960]  borrowing up a lot of money that they can get cheap from the federal reserve
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.800]  and just gamble with it you know and if the gambles pay off i mean
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:40.880]  core design probably would have made millions maybe billions who knows
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:45.120]  but it didn't but you know it didn't work and so uh you know who gets a lot
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:48.720]  you know caught hole in the bag if you didn't have this perception of
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:52.960]  too big to fail if you didn't have the fed out there back stopping everybody
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.920]  keeping interest rates so low guys like core design
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:58.800]  they wouldn't be able to make money this way they would be forced to make money
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.440]  the old-fashioned way they have to earn it
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.360]  going back a Reuters even last week said this is sending shock waves through
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:08.880]  commodities corn pork bellies beef that soybeans
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:12.240]  farmers don't trust the system now because a lot of them
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:16.240]  had their money taken as it reaches into the billions uh
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:20.080]  from my research this is one of the first times in modern history
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:23.840]  just the old you know bucket shops that they're just saying we're not going to
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.560]  say where the money is and now it turns out the head of the
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.560]  CFTC had to accuse himself he reportedly is invested
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:34.240]  with core design in this the insiders it turns out got warnings a
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:37.440]  month ago got their money out does this herald a really
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:40.640]  dangerous precedent if core design is allowed to take
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.680]  people's private bank accounts private brokerage accounts
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:47.280]  well yeah definitely and i you know i don't think that this is a bearish
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.240]  uh development for commodity prices in the short run
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.520]  maybe it's added to some of the pressure on commodity price which have
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:56.480]  pulled back quite a bit in recent months along with
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:59.600]  stock market and other assets plus the dollar has gained strength but
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.440]  ultimately if farmers really lose confidence
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:07.440]  in the futures market that's kind of bullish for commodities because farmers
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.680]  use the futures markets to hedge their risk and if they if they can't do that
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.720]  if it's more difficult for farmers to hedge their risk
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:18.400]  then that's that's going to actually put more upward pressure on crop prices
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.160]  because farmers will plant less if they can't hedge the risk then they have to
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:25.520]  take less risk which would do so as a supply of these commodities and
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.160]  therefore increases their price there you are that's why in
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:31.760]  venezuela or in communist russia or china they could never
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.880]  that 60 million starve to death in her mouth in just a few years
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.640]  because no one could trust anybody and we get back to this system where
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.480]  why should i hire people why should i plant crops if
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:46.080]  if somebody's just going to steal it anyways and then that's how you go from
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:50.240]  the most prosperous nation to the most degenerate well that's what
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:53.120]  happened with the pilgrims you know why should i farm i'm not going to get to
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.000]  eat any more than the guy that doesn't farm at all i mean that was the problem
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.440]  you've got to have individual incentives i mean everybody is out there on this
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.040]  occupy wall street they want to criticize the big gap the wealth
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.880]  disparity between the rich and the poor well you want there to be a disparity
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:10.800]  you want people to want to be rich you know that that's what drives them and
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:13.920]  motivates them to create all these products that we all
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:17.920]  enjoy to run these businesses it's because they want to be rich right so
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.760]  there's got to be a benefit to being rich we can't all be the same
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:25.920]  and the irony of it is some of the people who benefit the most in this system
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:29.280]  now are not benefited from capitalism but they're benefiting from what you
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:33.200]  talked about the crony capitalism the government and the bankers getting
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.840]  together to rob the poor in the middle class
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:39.680]  that's what they should be protesting not the capitalist the system itself
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:43.120]  that's the only chance the poor in the middle class have if they want to get
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.520]  rich it's not going to be through government i mean maybe
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.720]  yeah if you get lucky and you're politically connected stay there stay
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.440]  there let's talk about that more and whatever issues you want to raise on the
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:54.800]  other side with peter schiff but look at history folks

[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.080]  that's not what's happening you might even pass on gold if the stimulus
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:26.000]  package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.440]  that your retirement would be secure if all looks rosy to you

[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:14.000]  and others and a bunch of news stay with us gerald salente coming up
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.240]  in the last 30 minutes to give us an update since last week on the mf global
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.640]  peter in the five minutes we've got left looking at europe looking at the
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:28.240]  crises that's happening looking at the decisions that are being made
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.080]  where do you see all this going what what's most important on your radar
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.040]  screen right now well you know i think it's coming
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.080]  back here you look at the week bond auction that we had in the
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:42.400]  bull market last week and everybody focused in on how weak that was well
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:46.000]  you know i think the reason that people didn't want want to buy 10-year boons
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.360]  was because the yields were only two percent or just under two percent
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.800]  people are starting to wake up at how ridiculous these low rates are
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:57.200]  it wasn't that people were afraid that germany or the ecb wasn't going to
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:00.240]  bail out the rest of europe i think it's more likely that
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.760]  they're afraid they will bail them out and print money to do it and they're
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.560]  recognizing that if they're going to create a lot of inflation
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:10.560]  that these two percent 10-year yields are too low we've got the same situation
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:14.640]  our 10-year bond yields are two percent we're creating even more inflation in
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:17.680]  fact in america there isn't even a choice here
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:19.920]  there isn't even a chance that we do the right thing
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:22.960]  they still might do the right thing over there in europe i mean there's no way
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.760]  we're doing the right thing we've already said we're not cutting anything
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:28.480]  we're just printing printing printing because we don't even think there's a
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.120]  problem there so maybe we're not too far off
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.600]  from a failed bond auction here in the us and that's going to send a much bigger
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.840]  shock weight around the world if that happens
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:41.600]  uh than what happened in the bull market well you're right we've seen
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.640]  greenspan we've seen that brunackie all say
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:48.640]  there's no problem we'll just print money and
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.920]  they know where that's going but they've just committed to it so
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:56.960]  how do you see things breaking down then well i mean eventually the world is
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:59.600]  going to take them out their word and printing money
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:04.400]  is a problem in and of itself the once you tell your creditors that you're
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.200]  going to screw them that you're just going to print money and
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.960]  pay them back with a monopoly money then the game is over
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:14.480]  the only reason that people around the world are buying dollars is because
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:17.120]  they don't believe that they think we're good for the money
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:21.360]  they think american taxpayers can actually pay enough in taxes
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:24.960]  to legitimately pay off these debts there's no there's no chance of that at
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:28.560]  all so you know this is just a you know a blind
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:32.160]  moment of of confidence that somehow it's going to end someone's going to say
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:35.840]  the emperor has no clothes and the emperor is in it's in america it's not
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.960]  it's not over there in europe
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.720]  so what are you investing in what are you hot on right now where do you see gold
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:45.760]  going and then give us your brief take on
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:50.000]  ron poll i think gold's going up but i think the strongest looking commodity
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.520]  right now is oil i mean i just been watching a crude oil market
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:57.200]  very closely recently this has been acting very very strong
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:01.840]  even in the face of weakening stock prices of strengthening dollar relative
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:05.280]  to other currencies oil has been very strong
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:09.520]  we're just under a hundred dollars a barrel right now so i think the oil is going a lot higher
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:13.360]  um as far as ron paul i've always been bullish on ron paul the question is
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:16.720]  will enough other people getting bullish on ron paul
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.800]  so that he can win i mean the the latest anti-romany candidate is
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:26.000]  newt gingrich i think if gingrich flames out i can't see who's left but ron paul
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.480]  so hopefully we can have gingrich uh start to move down a little bit
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:35.200]  between now and the isle of caucus and you know knows i mean if ron paul
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:39.280]  can win isle it's not impossible he might get a lot of media attention and if he
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:43.440]  gets a lot of media attention you know he he could do a lot better than hampshire
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:47.280]  he's doing pretty good right now with basically hardly any media attention so
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:50.880]  imagine how we might do if the media actually started covering him
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:55.280]  which they would have to do if he won isle and then we'll see a repeat
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:00.240]  on a national scale of ron paul when they finally covered him and started
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:02.960]  demonizing him and claiming that he was you know
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:08.240]  sacrificing children on mars that's when his numbers went up even higher
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:12.480]  so clearly if he can win some of those key states they won't be able to ignore
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:16.160]  and they'll go on the attack and they're so discredited that that'll make him
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:20.000]  only go up yeah you know i i i don't really think
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.200]  there's much they can try to dust off some of those old newsletters
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:26.800]  and try to say that he's racist again but you know i don't think that's gonna
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.480]  work i mean they they've tried it before i think it's it's a pretty
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:34.560]  a thin attempt to try to discredit somebody who really is a very honorable
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:41.200]  person and has a distinguished record in the house and in his personal life
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:44.000]  what else do you think we can do to make sure ron paul wins because he's
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.600]  certainly in light years ahead of where he was four years ago in the last
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.080]  campaign yeah well you know we can donate i've
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:53.920]  maxed out my personal contribution to ron paul but people can make a donation
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:57.520]  to his campaign you know i tried you can dial for him they have a dialing
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:00.560]  where you can go to his website and sign up and call from home
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.480]  it's very easy to take surveys and help out uh the campaign
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:08.160]  to identify the ron paul supporters to identify
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.160]  people who are leaning in his direction so they can help identify these voters
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.800]  call them up change their minds get them out to the polls
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.440]  so there's a lot of things on a grassroots level
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:21.840]  we can do to help ron paul win of course exactly one of these states
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:25.360]  if you live in Iowa and hampshire make sure and go out and show up at the polls
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:29.520]  exactly and you know get some lawn signs tell your friends you know
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:33.120]  spread the word peter schiff thank you yeah i mean this
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.960]  this mind game that he can't win is really targeting ron paul supporters
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:40.480]  so you just believe that and sit down when he's on the verge of being the
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:44.880]  frontrunner like shark teeth all these other candidates have come forward
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:48.240]  all that's left is ron paul peter schiff thank you so much we'll be back with your
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:52.720]  calls thank you ton of news straight ahead we're on the march the empires on the

[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:38.480]  dealing with the police state forced inoculations uh and more oh and by the
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:43.760]  way i did remember uh and actually uh dig it out couldn't find it this weekend
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:47.760]  i got back last wednesday uh from my southwest trip

[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:01.840]  i may do it a couple reports now that i think about it but tonight on the
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:08.880]  nightly news i will get into this um this is the uh
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:16.400]  independent and this is a newspaper um for multi-city area
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:21.600]  of new mexico based in gallup and i told the story you know i always forget and
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:25.280]  think that i'm just doing a tv show here even though it at its base is a radio
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:27.680]  show that's where the millions of listeners are
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:30.720]  but we have people watching on prism planet dot tv and later on the web when
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:35.280]  it gets posted in different places uh but uh
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:39.120]  if you give me a document cam shot i'll show people this
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:45.360]  it says uh gallup police officers joe z bowman left and
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:51.120]  necola martinez set up a sign at a sobriety checkpoint at the third
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:57.200]  street and maxwell avenue january 29 2010
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.360]  file photo the checkpoint was staffed primarily by female officers
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:05.280]  as part of the ladies night out dwi prevention campaign
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:08.240]  and then they go on to say they're going to do it again this year
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:11.840]  warrantless checkpoints where they search your cars and it's always for a good
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:16.480]  reason oh and now they have the army out at some of these in the marines oh to
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:23.200]  stop drunk driving sure you do task force reducing dwi related fatalities
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:26.720]  seek it rid of that bill of rights everything's okay let the bankers take
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:29.600]  all the money and it's all about how the feminism is
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:34.000]  striking back at the evil males but see i happen to know the anthropology and
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.480]  the sociology of the area you see that navajo symbol on her arm
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:43.120]  the thunderbird and all the rest of it everything is run by women out there
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:46.800]  and let me tell you it's a nightmare out that women are bad but this is always
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:50.800]  what police states are like and i've pointed this out to richard while we're
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:53.600]  in the gas station i'll talk about it more tonight
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:55.920]  and the woman behind the counter even though they're like two people ahead of
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:58.880]  a set up that's right you'll be surprised what women can do
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.320]  who are you and started this in whole power trip and i got back in her face
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.720]  and i don't think she'd ever experienced it
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:08.880]  and she was groveling by the end of it but uh
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:13.440]  good lord i tell you it's it's and then i've got this grand canyon deal they
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:17.200]  give the kids and we were dressed down by a
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:19.840]  female ranger there while we were there as well for no reason
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:23.200]  i mean they're there to let you know they're gonna serve the new world order
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:27.360]  it's like hitler said first you get the women then you've got the children so
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:31.520]  follow the men house slaves were always women
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:34.800]  whether it was a white german the romans had or
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:40.320]  uh a african black woman on an east texas plantation
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:44.240]  it's the psychology not that women are bad but they believe
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:49.280]  on average on the good of having tyranny for everyone
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.800]  they you can give them a story and they'll go with it what does the bible
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:57.440]  say it will set women up above you on top of you
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.560]  over you and your children and that's the modern system don't discipline your
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:02.720]  children let them act as bad as they can so they
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:05.840]  can drug them up so they can put them in prison
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:09.760]  your kid acts like a total animal till they're 13 and then
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:15.520]  goes to prison say it's not funny anymore it's all how to destroy society
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:18.800]  and i got this grand canyon activity book i gotta highlight these and get
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.760]  screenshots of it and it says tell your parents you know
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:25.760]  don't you know turn their lights out don't take hot baths
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:31.520]  and a couple of these pretty amazing i'll probably cover this tonight or maybe
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:33.680]  tomorrow night because i've got to download all the footage i've
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:38.240]  even done that yet i was here friday and sunday but a lot of the crew was out

[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:25.200]  eight years ago i could get two thousand people out
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:28.240]  so we're gonna and it's good to have folks get together we're gonna do some
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:31.040]  big stuff i gotta get on my horse and get all this
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:35.680]  shut up but it's all coming
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:41.360]  okay i'm gonna go to your calls here
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.800]  who's up next here let's talk to henry in california
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:50.320]  listening on xm 166 you're on the air henry hi alex i just wanted to talk to
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:52.960]  you real briefly about how you mentioned the start of the show
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:57.040]  um i believe it's the free onyx deal that they're giving away
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:01.840]  uh the xm that is yes i was just i just i just heard the ad about
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:05.760]  uh free portable radio and i was that's not a paid commercial i was saying
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:10.320]  i'm gonna get one of those because definitely i have a lifetime subscription
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:13.920]  to xm and i want to say it was a period um before you
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:18.240]  filled in the slot on america's talk where uh i i basically
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:21.280]  did not listen to america's talk i thought it was one of the worst channels
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:24.320]  on there but within the short period of time that you've been on
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:27.680]  america's talk i really think you rallied the whole
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:32.160]  channel around and into the force i believe honestly
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:36.480]  you could probably have your own channel if you were to somehow
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:40.400]  negotiate the contracts i know it's not you know with xm not even about the
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:44.160]  bandwidth you know you have to have the contracts people have to be there to
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:48.000]  listen to it but i honestly think that it could compete for for the band with
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.760]  that well i mean it was about two years ago or more xm just fell in our lap we
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.960]  didn't even really i mean i guess over time listeners had approached
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:57.920]  them i don't know ted had talked to them they said yeah no
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:01.040]  because they saw ratings on terrestrial radio around the country
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:04.320]  we could take small stations and make them number one so they put us on it
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:07.360]  night and then it did good they put us on during the day and it's wonderful
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:12.000]  because because anybody can get an xm receiver and listen to the show
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:18.720]  and again i personally uh for whatever reason would never get
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:22.320]  i didn't buy i guess i hadn't bought a car in many years so i never had xm
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:27.200]  and then three three and a half years ago i bought a dodge charger and it had a
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:32.880]  serious in it and i still i don't know of course i listen to radio all the time
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:36.800]  uh and we also have a portable one you could take around the house but
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:41.520]  uh but it's an older system now i can listen
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:45.520]  to all the tv channels but not look at them it's hard to look
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:48.800]  at the wicked devils on cnn and and other channels
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.560]  listening to them isn't as painful even though i mean looking at them
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:56.560]  it's a whole flicker right in the tv thing i've stopped watching tv
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:01.040]  and it's brought me back into being able to analyze what they're up to on
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:04.160]  television that i can skip through television
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:08.240]  i mean they've got hundreds of tv stations on there uh and so yes i am a
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:11.280]  xm serious addict and i'm not saying that because i've been on there two
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:15.360]  years now i have begun to listen i have i don't listen to myself
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:20.480]  because that's torture but uh i uh occasionally uh you know i i take off
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:23.360]  the day and i can listen to one of the guest host uh sitting there and my
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:26.800]  children like to listen but uh anything else sir
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.600]  uh yes i wanted to add those little portable radios as a lifetime
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:35.520]  user of one they have saved me in a few situations
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:40.000]  by being able to find south with the sheer you know geosynchronous orbit all
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.400]  the math yada yada can probably get into you know all the things you need to
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:48.720]  about moving around how it's better with gps but the rudimentary idea that you
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:53.600]  can find south with those things has saved me a lot of time
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.200]  you know just you know i can turn it on am i pointing south
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:00.640]  somehow you know and i can find my bearing from there i know that'll help
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:04.000]  somebody out there you know i mean all right thank you i appreciate the call

[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.440]  at that system i'm gonna get two of them uh here in the office
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:15.360]  uh plus of potas or something's given a speech
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:19.200]  why wire it off the television or why wire it off whitehouse.gov we'll just
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:23.200]  stream the sucker you know right off xm and plug xm on reddit
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:28.320]  okay let's go ahead and talk to rick in california thanks for holding rick go
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:32.720]  ahead hi alex pleasure to speak with you
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:37.520]  prison planet tv member thank you um alex just two quick points if there's
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:43.520]  time i've been a prosecutor for nearly 30 years in california
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:47.200]  and the first point is it's very difficult you know at first to wrap your
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:51.040]  mind around a lot of these concepts it takes time
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:55.200]  and what woke me up more than anything was the chem trail issue i mean
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:58.960]  there it is in full you know smoking gun in the sky you know spraying
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:02.000]  everywhere and you call people about a congressman
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.720]  whatever and they lie to you and tell you that it's
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:08.000]  condensation i mean you know that's just absolutely
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.400]  inferior exactly that we are living in the beginnings of a
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:16.160]  artificial environment false reality it's not there yet but when you actually
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:20.240]  read the globalist white books white papers their own public reports they
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:22.960]  they talk about building this even a hundred years ago
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:27.360]  80 years ago 30 40 years ago it's all there and you find out wait you're
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:31.120]  putting fluoride in my water you know it increases cancer
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:34.800]  you know it lowers iq you know it affects the pineal gland
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:38.560]  wait wait you know the gmo is sterilizing every
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:41.200]  mammal species that eats it within three generations
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:45.040]  wait you know vaccines are damaging kids and that's what i'm saying
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:49.200]  the police are good the prosecutors are good in the in the past on average
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:53.680]  but everyone has slowly just been twisted with
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:57.760]  jack boward torturing people and all of this to now
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:00.480]  oh yeah the army's on the street what's the big deal
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:05.600]  we've just slowly been incrementally like the frog in the pot brought into
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:07.680]  this go ahead you've been holding i'll shut up
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:12.560]  it's just you know you you presume in the regularity of government if you're a
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:16.320]  guy like me in northern california you know a deputy da in your
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:20.880]  prosecuting criminals and then you know your mind is blown apart alex by
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:24.320]  by by the realization and the wake up that comes with this i mean can you
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:27.280]  imagine in arizona you know where there's no humidity and they're saying
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:30.080]  that's condensation and it stays there for three hours
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:34.080]  and you know bleaches the sky and you know whitens it and i mean
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:37.760]  but it's worse it's worse than that 16 years ago
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:40.640]  cliford karnaugham and all these environmental researchers
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:43.520]  were getting aircraft tests and they were saying it's aluminum to oxide
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:46.960]  barium salts all this other stuff and then the government comes out three
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:49.600]  years ago and goes there well there is a giant secret
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:52.720]  test but we won't tell you the details we've been spraying and list
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:57.360]  everything that the old-timers said and and then you find the patents to add
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:00.320]  to the jet fuel and then you find out about the department of energy
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:04.080]  programs and then you find out about un treaties in 1976
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:08.000]  and then you find out about the kim trail legislation 2002
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.320]  exactly it's it's crazy two we're being lied to
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:15.920]  and this is the mindblower for me the others the other point very quickly
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:20.400]  the whole notion of conspiracy theorist that ought to be rejected the new term
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:23.280]  ought to be whistleblowers that's what these people are
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:27.280]  they're just whistleblowers larry mcdonnell told us in 1983 he was a
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:30.400]  congressman and he was mysteriously shot down over
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:34.400]  soviet airspace he was the head of the john bursa society i love that video i
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:37.360]  don't know if you've ever seen it oh no they made a deal they made a deal with
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:40.880]  him on cnn his other speeches they made a deal to land him
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:44.240]  and they took him off and it was to confirm they basically tortured him
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:48.000]  over several years our own criminal government let russia do that
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.680]  to get rid of him because he was he was really he was smart
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:56.880]  good-looking charismatic larry mcdonnell scared the system bad
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:01.440]  so ron paul and there he is on crossfire in 1983 talking about the new world
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:04.960]  order and they were looking at him like he was crazy and he said look gentlemen
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:08.640]  a conspiracy is just a criminal agreement between two or more people
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:12.800]  that's all it is and eisenhower talked about it in the military industrial
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:16.400]  complex listen let me add to this rick you're on fire with these points
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:19.840]  we ought to play that cnn sometime uh i knew that's where you were going that
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:24.000]  crossfire this is what's so incredible about this
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.680]  every day i read the newspaper and it's this person charged with conspiracy
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:30.960]  to help somebody rob a bank or this guy charm the conspiracy
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:33.920]  because they got together and had meetings about robbing this auto part
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:36.720]  store of course there's conspiracy but when
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:40.320]  governments involved we're told it's impossible
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:46.160]  now how ridiculous is that all the conspiracy theory is now is not
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:50.000]  believing confirmed liars and this is what's dangerous this is why the evil
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.720]  is so smart as they allow this corruption to
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:55.840]  continue it then discredits the entire system
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:01.600]  turns the people against the system and then only the corrupt are in there
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:05.280]  and then the globalist can basically fully implode things
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:09.280]  you see the globalist have a leg up on us for one reason
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:12.160]  they don't mind wrecking things in fact they like it
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:15.280]  they don't have any rules they study how to manipulate
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:18.800]  and that's why they're so hard to beat is because they don't play
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:22.560]  by the rules go ahead yeah and the only other thing i'd say is
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:25.760]  i wondered if you saw the movie thrive what you thought of that and then
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:30.000]  finally why aren't there any uh ci's we need to explain why aren't
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.480]  confidential informants coming out uh like pilots or biologists that make
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:37.440]  these horrible things and you know and and why aren't they coming out
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.280]  don't they have a conscience well let me tell you
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:42.880]  jim keith was talking to some of them and i'm caught he he wrote black
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:46.080]  helicopters over america black helicopter strike force the new world
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:50.640]  order well in the early nineties and they killed him there's no
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:54.080]  doubt about it because he was he did have the informants
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:58.320]  and and that's why the minute i get something that's powerful and confirmed
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:01.680]  i put it out because it's like i told the dc madem i said you got to get all
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:04.800]  that out or destroy it she and i said don't tell me anything
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:08.400]  off air i don't i don't want to be killed and you know because she had
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:11.040]  top people visiting her and her and her women
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:15.120]  and it's the same thing uh they have an nsa program that's been partially
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:21.280]  declassified uh where they spy on millions of government
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:24.800]  and corporate employees and they let them know they're being spied on their
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:28.400]  phones everything so they've got computers watching them and it's just
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:32.560]  that fear and they've seen so many whistleblowers come out
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:36.640]  i mean sybil edmonds came out and heard the government commanding al qaeda
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:40.880]  on 9 11 and she was threatened with arrest if she told the public
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:44.800]  she went ahead and broke her gag order later so see the problem is there had
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:50.400]  been a lot of whistleblowers uh rick what conspiracy i would reject this whole
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:55.120]  conspiracy theorist label and say we are whistleblowers that's all we are i mean
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:50:00.640]  building seven on 9 11 these are smoking guns just absolute smoking guns to put
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:02.800]  options that were taken out in the stock market
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:07.200]  before the 9 11 i mean these are smoking guns how could people miss this stuff
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:11.200]  you know it's just it's it's amazing that they can be spraying over the sky and
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:15.120]  checkerboards and people they're missing it and then we've got the government
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:18.320]  programs where they're doing it and then they go
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:21.920]  oh look that's just condensation trail yeah a lot of them are
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:25.520]  and are there kooks that you know think that everything is that yeah but that
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:28.720]  doesn't matter there is a giant geoengineering program
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:33.440]  it's been partially declassified and in the soil levels of these barium salts
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:37.440]  aluminum's going up and monsanto's coming out with a seed line that can live
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:40.560]  in it the government is hoarding giant underground
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:43.120]  seed vaults everywhere the rockefellers that you

[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:24.960]  week in the last few weeks with the semif global
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:27.600]  which is a big deal you heard Peter Schiff earlier
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:30.800]  yeah we're just gonna you know the system saying keep your money
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:34.240]  that is new Peter agreed that's a new level
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:37.360]  and people are like three weeks later like where's the money
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:41.280]  they're just like don't worry about it but it was in our private counts
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:44.960]  don't worry about it don't be a conspiracy theorist
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:49.680]  when the men in suits take your money you just that's the way it is
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:53.120]  and this is the main advisor to Obama very creepy
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.200]  that's the thing about corruption it doesn't stop it gets worse and worse
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:00.160]  or it gets better it doesn't sit in one spot
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:04.800]  and right now they're running all over us because the average american is laying
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:07.440]  down to it
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:13.040]  i don't like being run over i don't like being conned and manipulated
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:16.000]  i mean i i literally lose sleep at night wanting to fight it
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:21.920]  and i'm a weirdo i'm an american my ancestors were just like i am
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:25.600]  this country was built by people that were aggressive and wanted freedom
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:28.560]  and who weren't criminals
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:33.520]  and now look what we've become we have been bathed in corruption
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:38.240]  we think it's funny well you're gonna find out why
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:42.320]  being a bunch of nineties is not fun you're gonna find out what happens when
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:45.840]  a country falls i don't think we can stop that
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:49.920]  now but we can try to have a controlled crash
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:54.160]  landing that's better than going straight in
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:56:00.480]  i'm the eternal optimist but it's bad because our people are demonic
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:03.760]  they are unawake they are unconscious i want to go to your calls
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:06.080]  and i'm not talking about those of us that are awake and none of us are
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:09.680]  perfect just just the general malaise is so scary
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:12.720]  because they're in a trance how do we break them out of the trance
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:17.120]  we do that by ourselves recognizing how out of control it is
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:20.240]  i mean when you read thousands of public documents were criminals in our
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:24.720]  government did lethal chemical biological
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:27.760]  radiological testing on troops foster kids
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:32.720]  black people you you name it and and and it was sanctioned
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:35.920]  you have to ask who did that in government well it was the shadow
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:39.120]  government the military industrial complex that eisenhower warned us about
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:42.320]  the last caller mentioned
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:46.880]  and then you've got to know it's much worse than it was back then today
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:51.040]  they're playing god
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:57.840]  and you obama all this who cares that's all window dressing what's going on in
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:01.360]  the shadow government and when you start researching it it is not
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:04.880]  pretty and of course then once you face these facts you're going to get chills
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:08.240]  i just got chills right now just thinking about this
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:12.480]  these are killers running things
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:15.600]  and you know why they leave me here on air then we're going to break my promise
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:19.680]  i'm going to joey first and steve
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:23.360]  because it's true
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:30.160]  they like to track everything and that's the system's rationale is that well
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:33.760]  at least we know where the patriots are
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:36.960]  it's a gauge
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:40.800]  but also the systems
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:44.480]  doesn't want to scare people too much yet
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:46.960]  they're getting you ready for telescreens they're getting ready for kill
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:49.680]  switches they're getting ready for checkpoints they're getting it's all
[01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:51.760]  starting to roll out and they just want to
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:55.440]  incrementally do it you see i'm so prominent what did jim garrison say
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:58.240]  over and over again he said you got to stay on the sunshine you got to stay
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:01.760]  vocal you got to stay public because that's where
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:06.560]  you're safe but more importantly than even that is trust in god
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:10.960]  trust in god because the system
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:17.600]  still will kill people like alex jones or congressman mcdonald
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:24.560]  they're capable of that but again mcdonald was
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:30.560]  polished and twinkle eyed and that scared him he was slicker than alex jones
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:33.920]  that's why they killed him better than a hammer after deep torture of course
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:41.280]  but uh i will be right back stay with us

[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:15.280]  thomas than connecticut this is home of the famous
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:20.160]  south thomas clocks that were set worldwide yeah
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:24.160]  i have a cps story to share with you now
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:30.960]  i spoke to you three years ago about this this is that my partner caron the
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:36.400]  mother of our two boys had a brain tumor when she was age 16
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:40.960]  and now under connecticut's predictive neglect law
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:44.560]  they moved right into the hospital and took the children away from
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:50.640]  both of us predicting neglect yeah that's pre-crime they have that they just
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:54.000]  say we have a computer actuary of course why don't they use their own
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:58.560]  predictive system on there on themselves 17 that's a good report to do
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:05.520]  17 times more likely to abuse children themselves
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:09.280]  sexually five times physically to general physical oh but no they're not
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:13.600]  going to use the predictive system on themselves so they took your children
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:17.600]  yes now i'd like to explain this to you it's very simply
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:24.960]  illness isn't against the law illness should be accommodated
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:29.440]  and they're not doing this see connecticut here it's called
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:35.360]  department of children and families dcf they are taking federal dollars so they
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:37.760]  have to abide by the federal mandate
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:42.240]  they're supposed to have had a federal coordinator in place
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:47.680]  overseeing them to make sure that the services they were rendering to caron
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:51.360]  uh were in compliance with the system they don't even follow their own rules
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:54.160]  it's all meant to be broken by the criminals
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:57.760]  and because they are pedophile murderers i mean if you want to find the
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:01.760]  largest group of absolute murdering lower than
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:05.760]  whale you know what garbage it's them and we have to first recognize the
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:09.440]  government is chock full especially in those areas
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:13.600]  of the lowest of the low and those are eugenics courts
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:17.440]  and the medical tyranny coming of your child is one pound overweight
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:21.440]  they're going to take them to their right rooms i'm sorry
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:25.440]  like you to hear this this is you're going to find this interesting now
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:30.000]  reasonable effort is something that the state is supposed to do
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:36.240]  now they consider reasonable effort sending caron to psychotherapy
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:39.360]  for something which is medically unfixable
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:43.200]  she had a brain tumor removed there's no cycle babble that's ever going to put
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:47.280]  her to a condition where she was let's see that that's how no no no no no now
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:51.440]  under the system when you break a leg or something you get prozac you didn't hear
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:55.920]  that no no no it's all they give troops who are sick from du
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:00.000]  drugs psychotrophics this isn't this is the brave new world
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:03.760]  like bill gates said he said we kill your grandmother we hired 10 teachers
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:08.160]  and the teachers all clapped oh murder people give us money as if you're going
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:11.680]  to get money you idiots oh i'm sorry sir i'll pray for you
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:14.720]  is there any way to get the other children back that the demons took
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:18.720]  well see no because see they're tiring me with the same brush
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:22.720]  they're not you know i'm supposed to be especially protected under this
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:27.440]  ada law but they're tiring me with the same brush no no no no just
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:32.400]  because they act liberal the real racist eugenicist
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:36.640]  they they hate handicapped they oh god bless you sir i'm sorry to hear this
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:39.280]  happen to you this is why they do it at the bottom

[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:47.680]  group of them that's where you find the most of them
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:52.560]  thickest thieves it's because when they grab people who are disabled they get
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:55.360]  double triple quadruple federal money it's all about

[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:37.920]  and that's what they do now if one child gets hurt or has a disease
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:42.080]  they then say well you're poor and you're at risk we're taking them all
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:46.880]  and they're just getting back to what they did until the 1940s

[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:24.480]  because no one believes a big university would do something no one
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:27.360]  believes uh police department would do something
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:30.240]  no one believes the texas youth commission would do something no one
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:33.360]  believes they would arrest half the black people or more in the town of

[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:40.480]  but they do you know one thing i wanted to say to that state police guy when he

[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:52.320]  check the tent this tent was a little dark pulls out a thing oh it's 29 i guess
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:55.280]  that's okay i'm like i want to search your car
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:59.520]  you work for government that's the most statistically dangerous group out there

[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:16.240]  but i wanted to bring up to him how texas is all over fox cnn you name it
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:20.400]  in towns everywhere where the police chiefs defend it
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:24.160]  and they literally pull over old ladies preachers they don't care
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:26.960]  and they say let me look in your purse and people don't know their rights and
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:30.080]  say okay these towns are so used to it they don't care they'll just club you in
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:32.640]  the head and they actually go and go you got
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:36.720]  two thousand dollars in here and the person's like yeah you know
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:38.560]  usually it's an old person because they're
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:42.080]  depression era they don't really use credit cards except for emergencies they
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:44.880]  carry cash and they just take it no judge no
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:47.520]  jury just and they say well our asset forfeiture
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:53.280]  seizures says we can take it oh you've got a regulation you pulled out of your
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:58.720]  year he pulled out of the air and so you say now
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:05.280]  i saw an article i couldn't believe 10 years ago or so back in 2000 2001
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:09.760]  and in that article out of it was the seattle post intelligence service
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:12.960]  seattle times i can't remember they got three papers
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:16.640]  there but it described how in a bar district
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:22.080]  more than half the bars in the nice bar district were now owned by cops
[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:25.680]  and how soon they would own all the bars because the police would go in the
[02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:29.840]  bathroom and sell each other drugs
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:33.680]  and then asset forfeiture sees and then give it to another cop
[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:38.160]  in the department as part of some type of
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:42.400]  courthouse sale that nobody was told of and and the paper was like
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:47.200]  is it illegal for them to set up people's businesses and take their property
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:53.280]  ah maybe not the article was like yeah they're taking over everything
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:57.120]  and when you're in new york and you see a potbellied wild-eyed
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:02.880]  cop with a bunch of others that look like something on a clockwork orange
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:08.160]  giggling and laughing like wannabe gangsters smoking cigars and cigarettes
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:11.680]  being rude to women as they walk by i mean i don't
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:14.800]  new york in a way is a interesting city a lot of beautiful stuff
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:19.280]  the vibe isn't really bad but the police there not all of them to you've heard
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:22.240]  them call in some are nice they're really nice they're really bad but more
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:26.880]  and more i've been to parades i've been there and covered things
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:30.320]  and you'll look at the cops and and if i was a hollywood director
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:34.720]  and i was getting a cast together of a futuristic police force
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:39.360]  with thug-like goons you know america has fallen
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:43.920]  the police status here the corrupt tyranny is in place
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:50.080]  you know imagine a movie like that i would go and hire new york cops
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:55.280]  i would go and hire them to be the bad guys in my movie
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:13:00.480]  because i i mean you the loneliness of someone who wants to be rude to
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:04.240]  tourist the loneliness of people sitting around with their
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:08.720]  with their shirts half untucked and huge potbellies and again i got a little
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:12.400]  bit of a belly the point is is that it is something weird about it
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:16.480]  or in commando gear weighing 400 pounds i see that a lot too
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:20.400]  with just weapons all around their giant santa claus bellies
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:23.760]  uh bugging their eyes out they're like a little kids and
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:27.840]  dress up army we will draw up to protest the fellow reserve
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:32.000]  a few months ago when i'm going to your calls i um
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:36.160]  we pulled in what they call the check shop uh check stop it's like a gas station
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:40.400]  that has collages and stuff like midnight driving up there and there was
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:44.880]  this cop in there who had to weigh 500 pounds i mean he looked like fat albert
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:49.200]  white guy with a beard stains on his big giant it was a sheriff's
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:52.400]  deputy on his big giant shirt that went out like this
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:56.720]  and firearms and tasers and i watched him waddling around
[02:13:56.720 --> 02:13:59.760]  you know he walked in like he was a guy in a western
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:04.320]  walking through the saloon doors you know with his hands out ready to grab his
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:08.480]  guns looking and he was looking around the corner when he walked into the
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:11.840]  donut area and he was a little when he got we got a drink out of the thing he
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:14.960]  was looking and he was and you sit there and you look at these
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:18.160]  guys in the eyes and they look at you like you're looking at me
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:24.880]  you see how powerful i am and you're just like holy mackerel
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:33.520]  this guy is you know you know you know you know was either bullied or was a
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:35.840]  bully
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:43.040]  and it's just it's such a joke tyranny is so pathetic
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:47.040]  i mean look at barney frank caught running underage
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:52.240]  prostitutes 15 14 year olds out of his out of his condo out of his townhouse
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:55.120]  and he went out and gave a press conference it's in our film um
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:59.600]  visible empire and said if you talk about me anymore i'm just going to go
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:04.000]  public with everybody else and they said you know what mr frank
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.240]  you like 14 year old boys and knock yourself out
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:16.720]  that's on record that's who we're ruled by little pudgy handed perverts little
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:21.120]  little little nobodies and little little little hitler outfits
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:25.760]  stomping around in a gas station acting tough
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:31.840]  you know you'll see good old boys or people that are confident with their
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:34.240]  shoulders thrown back all walking around happy
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:39.280]  and maybe that's how i should be but you know in my life i've always
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:43.120]  not really had my shoulders hunched over but if i really stand up straight it
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:46.240]  looks pretty ridiculous you know it looks like mr barrel chest
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:49.760]  and you know you know looks like i'm about to go into combat or something
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:53.920]  but i've always just kind of kind of just tried to keep to myself try not to
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:56.240]  get attention that's because i'm confident i'm
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:16:00.640]  aggressive i'm afraid of somebody starting a fight with me
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:04.000]  because i'm afraid of what i'll do to him not that i'm tough i've been hurt just
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.920]  as bad as i've hurt people who started it
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:11.520]  and that's the problem people who are strong and good and virtuous
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:15.520]  are ashamed of our strength and we hide and we let little wimps
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:19.920]  run around and act tough and boss us around like we've done something wrong
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:22.240]  and i personally am sick and tired of it
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:26.880]  steve in north carolina steve you're on the air go ahead

[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:07.120]  uh the liberty uh pro-liberty um activities going on and one of the
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:12.480]  things he shared was that he would rather vote for somebody
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:17.760]  that is for the constitution that may be an atheist or agnostic than a
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:21.920]  christian or a evangelical that is against the
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:25.680]  constitution and i just wanted to bring that bring that up

[02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:54.400]  uh you know in reaching the young people um
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:59.920]  you know um you know i wanted to see you you're talking about video games
[02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:05.360]  and um you know my brother and i uh have a concept that we're trying to work on
[02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:12.960]  and uh where um the character in this video game it's kind of like a war game
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:16.480]  you know kind of violent but kind of trying to reach the masses
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:22.800]  uh and each step the character has to go find pieces of the constitution that's
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:24.800]  been you know locked up in these maximum sheer
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:29.520]  security uh places but i wanted to see maybe offline to get a number
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:34.080]  where i can contact you to talk more about that with you
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:37.760]  just send us an email my friend and i'll look into it i appreciate your call by
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:41.600]  the way the drudge report linked to this this morning and then i think took it
[02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:44.640]  down in about two hours and that happens sometimes when they're really
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:48.080]  busy and and going through a lot of news but also happens if drudge isn't sure
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:51.360]  about an article but it's senate moves to allow military to

[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:38.400]  but i'm going to do it even more tonight on the nightly news and then tomorrow
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:42.480]  because i ran out of time and no i'm not talking about exposing newt genridge
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:44.800]  as a globalist with his own words i'll do some of that as well
[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:52.320]  well no i'm talking about this article and ron poll's come out aclu's come out altered
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:56.720]  they've all come out they've read the bill constitutional lawyers have come out
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:02.080]  they've read the bill it says the army can operate inside the u.s fighting
[02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:05.760]  terrorists or other people fighting the government but u.s citizens are exempt
[02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:12.240]  and then you look at the other subsection it says except if the government wants to
[02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:18.640]  strip you of that extra judicially so it's like you have these rights but unless we say so
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:22.480]  remember they said the patriot act wouldn't be used against citizens now it's used in every
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:29.680]  case you could imagine thousands of times per year per state so yes ron poll's right the aclu's
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:34.720]  right yes it does say that and and it's worse they don't just say they can do it first they
[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:40.720]  say they can't but then they can it's always written by these scumbag lawyers and and again
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:44.400]  uh it's not a big deal it's just drudge report is the biggest news site out there and a lot of
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:48.720]  times he links our stuff for two or three hours and when he's doing tons of news and stuff rolls
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:54.320]  off and it looks like that's happening today but sometimes only seen a few times he picks up one
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:58.800]  of our flashbacks or something as if it's new and then figures it out and you know i've seen it two
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:03.440]  or three times out of hundreds of articles they've linked to this one was up got giant attention
[02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:08.560]  and i noticed wasn't there anymore and i asked paul yesterday but he was busy i understand why
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:14.480]  to do a update explaining that because he's quoting ron paul aclu and the trolls are in
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:19.600]  there saying it's not real it's not real it's not real within seconds within minutes of this going up
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:24.640]  i want to bring ted anderson up right now shifting gears ahead of jerry solente and
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:28.400]  more your phone calls for those that are hold patiently holding i will get to all of you that
[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:33.600]  are at least on hold briefly with a gold pitch commodities are only going to go up you heard
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:38.880]  petership earlier they may drive them down for a period though that's not happening right now it's up
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:44.000]  but it's only going to go back up and that's what's happening because of the basic laws of finance and
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:50.240]  capital and investment and commerce and commodities when you have global devaluation which they've
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:56.720]  signaled they're going to accelerate the acceleration when that happens things will only go up whether
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:03.760]  it's land whether it's oil whether it's gold copper things are only going to go up even though
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:12.640]  we're in a depression you'd think prices will go down but it's hyper stag depression
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:19.120]  we have all of these different things happen at the same time because it's designed
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:26.080]  we have inflation mounting with a stagnant economy on top of it with depressionary forces
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:30.480]  normally just have a depression if it's natural this is inflation on top of it
[02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:36.320]  going to ted anderson ted tell us uh as you watch all this unfold and global government being
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:43.120]  again pushed as a solution everything uh you have great offers on gold and silver tell folks
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:49.360]  what they are ted yeah i mean i i gotta tell you right now alex gold is up 32 and 20 cents
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:54.880]  it's hitting a high today of 17 2270 for those of you who've been watching we hit about 1680
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:28:01.120]  here just last week but you would have had to be a pin for pin precision precise to be able to get
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:05.520]  it at that level right now the frank that we've been talking about for such a long time fifth of
[02:28:05.520 --> 02:28:12.720]  the ounce of gold 373 dollars we're still uh buying a full year subscription to bob's newsletter the
[02:28:12.720 --> 02:28:20.240]  international forecaster for you on that one uh i still why not get involved with learning about
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:27.200]  the fed and what's going on economically that that book that you offered the video uh for 73
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:32.240]  dollars delivered we still have it at that i can't deliver two silver dollars without the book in the
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:37.040]  video for the same price that i'm selling this special at which is 73 dollars you get the big
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:42.560]  brother book you get the american dream uh video uh you know between the two of those i mean that's
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:47.280]  worth 40 dollars worth of stuff anyways and then you put the silver dollars on top of that it makes
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:52.800]  a great buy but i can tell you right now we're bouncing off of a bottom right now and uh everybody
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:57.360]  should be getting involved in the when the markets low not when it's high we're about ready to run
[02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:03.440]  into another economic disaster i mean bloomberg just reported the secret fed loans gave banks
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:10.480]  unclosed undisclosed 13 billion dollars in profits alex and uh you know that's just that's the tip
[02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:15.920]  of the iceberg i mean they're they're actually they got 16 trillion the first two years at least
[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:22.000]  10 trillion more after that most of it went to europe and then the very bankers that engineered this

[02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:44.080]  fund which i had peter schiff on he admitted this is unprecedented it's illegal the ft the cftc
[02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:48.880]  and others have said it's illegal but nobody's getting in trouble because it's the wondrous

[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:52.800]  them to ted actually sell the books at ted to ted at cost but on the american dream video a small
[02:34:52.800 --> 02:34:57.680]  profits made for myself and the filmmakers which is great we're free market what funds this operation
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:03.920]  but for ted it is a loss leader but listen forget the three silver dollars and all the free stuff
[02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:12.960]  that's a great deal fine great get it gold is a rich man's silver and i believe what jim rogers
[02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:17.760]  and others say silver is probably even the better buy it's just that it's so hard to lug around
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:23.280]  compared to gold i'm into both gold and silver i've never sold any of the gold or silver i bought
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:30.080]  because it's an emergency backup ted's got a whole radio list of different things that are
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:36.720]  smoking hot that you can only get by calling all right and it's just that simple uh people didn't
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:41.440]  buy gold when it was 300 because it was too much they didn't buy it at 500 it was too much or 800
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:47.760]  or a thousand or 1200 or 1400 or 16 17 18 and then it dropped down to 16 something and oh i'm not
[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:53.600]  going to get it now it's back up to 18 something and on and on and on silver was too much at five
[02:35:53.600 --> 02:36:00.800]  dollars now it's 30 something it's not that silver and gold have gone up it's that the dollars are
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:05.920]  being devalued this is one of the only ways to get any protection and nothing's perfect it's the
[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:11.520]  best silver bullet there is wouldn't you know it's not a silver bullet it's the closest thing to it
[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:16.560]  and it happens to be silver and gold wow closest thing to a silver bullet just so happens to be
[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:24.960]  silver wow i don't think there's a mistake in that so ted does have a large list of gold and
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:29.040]  silver special deals there's like 20 of them last time i checked when you call tell them alex jones
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:36.560]  sent you 800 686 2237 you have gold is too much to buy today will it be too much if it goes up to
[02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:45.680]  2500 or 3000 if silver is too much at 30 something will it be too much when it's 50 and look that
[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:51.600]  might not happen well the sun might not come up tomorrow i mean there's a chance the sun could
[02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:59.040]  go supernova blow up no sunrise we're all dead there's a chance that a spaceship full of leprechauns
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:02.560]  could land i mean who knows in this whole universe it could be real i don't think it is
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:12.160]  but the best bet in my mind is i'll promote what i believe in is gold and silver ted briefly tell
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:16.080]  folks about the smattering of other specials you got them we're going to gerald salente of

[02:37:30.880 --> 02:37:35.200]  about it in this article at bloomberg i can't believe they reported this this is what ron paul's

[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:13.680]  a little bit of a correction in the marketplace but the market is running back up again right now
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:20.000]  so get your little pen and paper out or whatever it takes for you to buy exactly a golden silver

[02:39:28.800 --> 02:39:35.040]  to it with uh predicted so much of what we're facing he did predict that they would start
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:39.520]  grabbing people's pensions bank accounts bank holidays you name it now that's being openly
[02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:47.600]  discussed but even Reuters is saying mf global could cause runs on banks and brokerage funds this
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:53.840]  was his money his private account totally illegal they took it and now we're three weeks or more
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:59.040]  than three weeks into this uh and they're saying oh it's over three billion now it was 600 million
[02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:06.080]  then 100 you know million more to 700 million then it was a billion a billion two more than a billion
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:11.120]  two three billion more more more and and and a guy who can give you breaking news on this because
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:18.240]  he had more than six figures taken is Gerald Salente joining us via video skype Gerald thank
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:25.120]  you for coming on with us to give the audience an update yes the and the big news here Alex
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:32.320]  oh there's a couple of big pieces one of course is John Corzine the former co-head of Goldman
[02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:39.440]  sacks senator of new jersey then governor of new jersey who is the head of mf global
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:46.720]  and as you mentioned the number keeps going up this is flagrant extortion
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:53.600]  them they can't find the money look how quick they found Gaddafi's money
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:41:00.720]  look how quick they find any chinhorn dictators money that they want to overtake
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:11.920]  but they can't find the money that's missing from mf global and they don't even bring
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:19.680]  Johnny boy in for questioning hey leave them alone look at the prostitutes on this one
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:29.520]  they try and convict whoever they want in the media before the people are even convicted or tried
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:37.520]  like they did with that Strauss con character but not white shoe boy Corzine
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:48.640]  no no he may he may appear before a senate and house committee hearing and you know what he'll do
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:58.320]  he'll plead the fifth just like the media is pleading the fifth the fourth estate no no
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:09.120]  I have a piece in front of me Alex that just came off the wire from the Chicago Sun Times
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:19.600]  CME's reputation gets the stress test CME of course is the clearinghouse the stock
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:27.840]  exchange for commodities over in Chicago and you know that I broke the story with video links
[02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:39.760]  sent to 45,000 people in the media of the head of the CME group Terence Duffy saying that
[02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:50.320]  CME is the guarantor that CME guarantees people who lose money because one of their members went
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:43:00.800]  belly up but here's what the prostitutes write CME's reputation gets a stress test isn't that nice
[02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:10.880]  a stress test CME is involved here because it clears or legally guarantees the trading on
[02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:19.280]  its markets they even say it but they won't put their feet to the fire this is the biggest ripoff
[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:24.320]  we just sent out Alex you just got it we sent it to you guys it's going out to trends journal
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:33.840]  subscribers in our 20 years 20 years of publishing we have never sent out an urgent trend alert
[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:42.400]  the trend alert is and I broke this partially to you last week the entire financial system
[02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:49.360]  is on the collapse let's go over to Europe oh the European bonds over there the Italians
[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:56.560]  they can't afford to borrow anymore neither can the Spanish neither can the Greeks oh the Belgians
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:44:01.920]  they're just getting their credit rated lower that's right they had bailed out the dexia bank
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:08.480]  and it's costing them 15 percent of their GDP to do it again to bail out a bank go across the globe
[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:14.960]  one after another bank runs in Lithuania everybody that I know in Greece and Italy are pulling their
[02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:19.840]  money out of the banks and the people that do have money over there and the banks that have
[02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:26.960]  money are bringing it over here because it's falling apart this here's the big scam they just
[02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:34.160]  did it with this black friday baloney and here's what the Preston toots did they kept pumping up
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:40.800]  this black friday christmas rush sale to get the suckers out there to keep spending the last dime
[02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:48.720]  that they don't have now put two and two together the more consumers spend the more the retailers
[02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:57.120]  advertise the more the retailers advertise the more they spend on commercials with the
[02:44:57.120 --> 02:45:03.920]  prostitutes whether it's in the print media or on tv so it's in their best interest to keep
[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:09.600]  pumping this up here's the warning that we're sending out to everybody and with details on
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:18.400]  what we're doing to protect ourselves after the holidays in the first part of the new year of 2012
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:25.280]  the economic collapse will happen and they will no longer be able to cover it up and they're going
[02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:32.240]  to declare economic martial law just as my money's been stolen your money's not going to be safe
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:40.000]  anywhere unless you have it in your pocket or you have it in golden selva wow jerald salente
[02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:44.320]  they're now admitting that we've really been in a depression for three years that the collapse
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:53.760]  accelerated uh in the last year or so as you predicted it would and here we are with them
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:59.520]  just trying to prop it up and tell us everything's fine but the fact that first it's 600 million
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:04.560]  then a billion then 1.2 and then three and more than three billion and the fact that
[02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:09.120]  they're trying to test right now to see if they can just take accounts and that's what
[02:46:09.120 --> 02:46:14.560]  peter schiff said earlier in the last hour that it looks like this may be the new economic policy
[02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:20.480]  is to just loot and that they're testing it out and that's what's going on here they wouldn't
[02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:25.600]  be doing this right now if they didn't have the money uh and if they didn't want to just see if
[02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:31.200]  they could get away with it uh and and and if they couldn't deliver that and it clearly is not
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:38.800]  just extortion it's more than that it's embezzling they they took your segregated account that was
[02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:44.480]  yours and they even tried to have their minions and operatives spin it that it's all your fault
[02:46:44.480 --> 02:46:47.920]  yeah it's going to be all your fault too folks when they devout devalue what's left to your
[02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:52.880]  retirement and your dollars and and loot your pension funds yeah it's all good and then the
[02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:56.640]  government's going to take them over to protect them and dole out what's left of it it's going
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:47:02.000]  to be your fault again i mean they are really really getting into dangerous waters here now
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:06.400]  gerald this has been going on this has been going on a week and a half before you broke it a week
[02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:14.240]  and a half ago so that's this has been going on like a month now almost four weeks and you're
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:19.200]  clearly talking to these people or or what have you learned since we talked last tuesday or wednesday
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:23.280]  when you talk to them they just say not gonna get it because you know a few weeks ago it's
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:27.920]  like you'll get some of it later now it's just we don't know where it went it i mean as if the
[02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:33.200]  federal regulators and people couldn't go right into the transfer records i mean you know i go get
[02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:37.520]  a thousand dollars in cash out of the bank deck like i'm a bank robber even though it's you know

[02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:21.680]  year the next great war of the 21st century well that was your trend at the start of this year
[02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:25.600]  and certainly they're getting ready for that right now so i mean what else are they gonna do to try
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:30.880]  to get away with this well they're gonna call a bank holiday of some sort is my belief you asked
[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:35.520]  me for an update i just had one on my account now to make this really clear for all those who
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:43.280]  can't understand this in april of this year i bought a contract to take delivery in gold at the end
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:50.080]  of this month i bought the gold at one thousand four hundred and forty three dollars an ounce that
[02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:56.880]  was the agreement the day that mf global went bankrupt they emptied my out my account they
[02:55:56.880 --> 02:56:05.200]  transferred my contract to another company rj o brian but i didn't buy gold at 1443 that's only
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:12.960]  my imagination and that's only what all the paperwork says according to rj o brian and
[02:56:12.960 --> 02:56:20.400]  those sobs over there and cme group and the rest of them the trustees i actually bought my gold at
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:29.680]  1767 dollars an ounce that's what they're telling me so now when i take delivery no no now we're
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:34.240]  talking of you know let's just do the math for a hundred ounces we're talking a thirty thousand
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:42.400]  dollar plus difference now they're telling me no no you didn't buy it at 1443 because we emptied
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:50.000]  out your account sucker we gave the money to our buddies we're gonna call them trustees and they're
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:55.840]  gonna charge a lot of money to do this to give them the money so you could trust them you got
[02:56:55.840 --> 02:57:04.320]  nothing salenti your gold is 1767 dollars an ounce even though today as we speak what is it alex
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:09.840]  1707 dollars an ounce let me just stop you right there so three weeks four weeks later you're

[02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:19.040]  they're spending that as an excuse to say why they're keeping your money so they finally came up
