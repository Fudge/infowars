[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:21.120]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.120 --> 00:33.200]  ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting worldwide today it's already Thursday the
[00:33.200 --> 00:38.560]  fifth day of February 2015 I'm your host Alex Jones and we're coming to you from
[00:38.560 --> 00:46.520]  the info wars.com studios in Austin Texas Wow where to begin yet again there is so
[00:46.520 --> 00:53.200]  much to get to this whole Brian Williams shot down in the helicopter garbage has
[00:53.200 --> 00:59.760]  completely blown up in his face and that just shows what a bunch of liars these
[00:59.760 --> 01:05.400]  people are it's not really our top story it just illustrates no helicopter was
[01:05.400 --> 01:09.320]  shot down it was all made up just like private Lynch just like the Pat Tillman
[01:09.320 --> 01:16.840]  just like the American sniper these stories are fables now with Lynch it's
[01:16.840 --> 01:22.440]  100% fraud the American sniper looks like about 90% of it's true but you still
[01:22.440 --> 01:27.320]  can't go around lying about people to make yourself look bigger and the
[01:27.320 --> 01:32.840]  military just would not go along with this the that is the actual soldiers
[01:32.840 --> 01:36.440]  just like Pat Tillman wouldn't go along with a bunch of lying about what he was
[01:36.440 --> 01:40.640]  really doing he was not charging a bunch of al-Qaeda nests every day and you know
[01:40.640 --> 01:43.400]  this big hero I mean he was out there getting shot at but he wouldn't go along
[01:43.400 --> 01:50.400]  with the lies so they killed him this is a big deal we're going to go through the
[01:50.400 --> 01:55.520]  different clips in a special report with Brian Williams first making it up in
[01:55.520 --> 02:01.600]  2013 about a 2008 event on Letterman then him in Rangers games continuing the
[02:01.600 --> 02:06.400]  lies the trip's going public and now he's recanted it's a big deal as far as
[02:06.400 --> 02:12.480]  I'm concerned it's not like he lied about cheating on his wife or something I'm
[02:12.480 --> 02:16.120]  not saying that's good it's just that people can go I get that you don't want
[02:16.120 --> 02:19.360]  to be a liar you don't make stuff up on purpose you just try to cover your butt
[02:19.360 --> 02:25.120]  to whole cloth make up that he's this big hero just like Hillary Clinton claimed
[02:25.120 --> 02:30.440]  that she was in a C-130 taking fire and getting shot up there was no fire on the
[02:30.440 --> 02:34.280]  C-130 that later came out from the cruise and that's what's holding back so
[02:34.280 --> 02:39.080]  much of this tyranny is the grassroots police the grassroots military the
[02:39.080 --> 02:45.000]  grassroots citizens the people on the ground in business in academia in life
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.240]  will not go along with the BS that's what I want to go to automated systems and
[02:51.240 --> 02:57.400]  and drones and computers and robots doing most the dirty work because then
[02:57.400 --> 03:01.680]  they can compartmentalize it better and cover everything up but that's that's a
[03:01.680 --> 03:06.960]  big deal that's coming up today DOJ still won't admit if it took any action
[03:06.960 --> 03:12.320]  against NSA analysts spying on love interest they admit it's a viral problem
[03:12.320 --> 03:16.280]  people spying on their love interest or their business competitors or their
[03:16.280 --> 03:21.840]  neighbors I mean obviously humans are fallible and we're going to abuse
[03:21.840 --> 03:27.600]  things and that's why you don't build a omnipresent surveillance grid because
[03:27.600 --> 03:32.880]  as top analysts have said on the show including William Benny it ends up
[03:32.880 --> 03:37.160]  destroying your national security because now that panopticonic surveillance
[03:37.160 --> 03:41.480]  system is going to be accessed by unsavory characters foreign governments
[03:41.480 --> 03:45.560]  you name it for the highest bidder and now there's a weapon system to take down
[03:45.560 --> 03:51.080]  society you don't build the bomb that can destroy the world you've already won
[03:51.080 --> 03:55.600]  the war you don't build the panopticonic surveillance grid that the devil
[03:55.600 --> 04:01.480]  himself would love and then you've won the war but we've done it it's got to be
[04:01.480 --> 04:05.040]  dismantled there's now a global surveillance race with every major
[04:05.040 --> 04:10.600]  device coming out to surveillance spy on you by design the genie can still be
[04:10.600 --> 04:13.360]  put back in the bottle I don't think it is going to be I'm gonna be quite frank
[04:13.360 --> 04:16.960]  with you at least those of us out here can get a jump on it all what's coming
[04:16.960 --> 04:21.160]  and be ready for it and not be caught flat-footed and quite frankly even if
[04:21.160 --> 04:26.120]  you were a cynical sociopath out there you'd want to know all this info in
[04:26.120 --> 04:30.640]  business and life to be positioned to capitalize on it and not in an immoral
[04:30.640 --> 04:34.440]  way but I mean I don't intend to just sit here and go through all this I'm
[04:34.440 --> 04:38.800]  gonna capitalize on all of it I'm gonna fight it try to shut it down but I'm
[04:38.800 --> 04:43.600]  gonna be ready to be positioned to dominate into the future so I could

[08:07.840 --> 08:13.440]  bully us in the medical tyranny I wanted to take issue with you anti-vaxxers
[08:13.440 --> 08:18.680]  right wingers rednecks it's about big brother but on the other hand some
[08:18.680 --> 08:21.880]  things do require some involvement of big brother what gives you the right to
[08:21.880 --> 08:25.320]  tell me that I should get a shot that my children should be shot I don't think
[08:25.320 --> 08:28.920]  there's any extraordinary about resorting to freedom Hillary Clinton took to
[08:28.920 --> 08:32.880]  Twitter to voice her support for vaccinations the science is clear the
[08:32.880 --> 08:37.200]  earth is round the sky is blue and vaccines work let's protect all our
[08:37.200 --> 08:42.520]  kids I can't swallow and I sput from my toes and I just want to tell anybody out
[08:42.520 --> 08:47.960]  there if you get a shot you're a fool meanwhile the insert says it can make you
[08:47.960 --> 08:54.400]  get measles we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong
[08:54.400 --> 08:57.880]  to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong
[08:57.880 --> 09:01.120]  to whole communities but I think the parents should have some input the
[09:01.120 --> 09:05.680]  state doesn't own your children parents own the children and it is an issue of
[09:05.680 --> 09:09.560]  freedom but the 10% can't go to school must get back to me the science of
[09:09.560 --> 09:14.440]  vaccines which work effectively a hundred percent of the time and the white
[09:14.440 --> 09:19.480]  wait a minute I'm sorry you haven't read the CDC memo have you it was 99% last
[09:19.480 --> 09:23.640]  week now they're telling people is 97% so it's not a hundred percent even by
[09:23.640 --> 09:27.880]  their own statistics meanwhile the outbreak was caused by vaccinated
[09:27.880 --> 09:37.240]  people resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones you
[09:37.240 --> 09:42.120]  notice Hillary Clinton there use the same line they use about the earth is
[09:42.120 --> 09:47.400]  round the sky is blue man made global warming is real all scientists agree
[09:47.400 --> 09:52.360]  it's real and Al Gore says that and Obama says that and the vast majority of
[09:52.360 --> 09:57.200]  scientists have been canvassed in international studies we've covered them
[09:57.200 --> 10:02.240]  you can look them up and don't believe man-made global warming is happening I
[10:02.240 --> 10:08.280]  mean Al Gore said that the entire northern ice cap would be gone by 2013
[10:08.280 --> 10:15.480]  it's the largest ever recorded in 60 years of satellites they say polar bears
[10:15.480 --> 10:20.240]  are about to go extinct they're five times their numbers that they were again
[10:20.240 --> 10:25.640]  in the 1950s don't believe me just type in polar bear populations explode in
[10:25.640 --> 10:34.560]  northern Europe Russia and North America five times their numbers they're
[10:34.560 --> 10:39.080]  just running around like roaches doesn't matter they're all dead Al Gore said
[10:39.080 --> 10:47.600]  so on the CDC says it's 97% safe that's all just total quack numbers by the way
[10:47.600 --> 10:50.880]  here's an article up on info wars calm linking directly through to the federal
[10:50.880 --> 10:55.920]  government's own data US government has paid out 3 billion to vaccine injured
[10:55.920 --> 11:00.800]  Americans since 1989 as part of the secret court unless you live in a cave
[11:00.800 --> 11:03.840]  and have no access to television the internet you've likely been exposed to
[11:03.840 --> 11:08.480]  measles mania that has swept America oh my gosh no one's died it's the end of the
[11:08.480 --> 11:15.160]  world but arrest anybody that isn't vaccinated woman contracts polio virus
[11:15.160 --> 11:21.640]  from vaccinated infant that stories up on info wars calm California bill with
[11:21.640 --> 11:29.440]  Nick's vaccine exemption meanwhile 10 states suing over Obama's immigration
[11:29.440 --> 11:33.000]  actions find their senators on the opposite side including Republican ones
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.920]  because that's what the establishment wants and what they tend to want they
[11:37.920 --> 11:44.000]  tend to get will continue today to follow this vaccine situation and at the
[11:44.000 --> 11:51.840]  bottom of the hour I want to play a special report dealing with the denial
[11:51.840 --> 11:57.240]  and the propaganda used by socialist and communist that are basically the
[11:57.240 --> 12:00.840]  ground troops of the private central bankers want to create a monopoly of
[12:00.840 --> 12:04.480]  socialism on the ground to make people dependent while they themselves are
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.640]  exempt a few weeks ago we had the leader of the weather underground on the
[12:09.640 --> 12:15.240]  broadcast Bill Ayers and he was worse than sergeant Schultz that knows nothing
[12:15.240 --> 12:22.960]  I know nothing I know nothing so he put together a video breaking down the
[12:22.960 --> 12:27.240]  deceptions he's involved in and if you're a radio listener you go to info
[12:27.240 --> 12:30.840]  wars calm for its last show you can actually see the video because we'll
[12:30.840 --> 12:36.080]  show the police memorials and the state and federal websites that show the
[12:36.080 --> 12:41.680]  police officers that he that they did indeed bomb it's well known and then he
[12:41.680 --> 12:45.320]  said I'm not a communist or a socialist we have him previously 10 years ago
[12:45.320 --> 12:50.360]  saying I want to overthrow capitalism I'm a communist so the weatherman leader
[12:50.360 --> 12:54.720]  came on and said he's not a communist because see the talking point is
[12:54.720 --> 12:59.680]  communism doesn't exist socialism doesn't exist even as we have socialized
[12:59.680 --> 13:03.600]  government health care Giants crew job even as they say our kids belong to the
[13:03.600 --> 13:06.800]  state even as the president says we're going to give you free health care so
[13:06.800 --> 13:12.240]  that's coming up another extremely powerful report that was put together by
[13:12.240 --> 13:17.080]  Joe Biggs Darren McBreen and Leanne McAdoo and others really has high
[13:17.080 --> 13:21.160]  production value and it's satirical but based on real things that are happening
[13:21.160 --> 13:27.560]  that videos up on info wars calm how we'll also get to how the elite plan to
[13:27.560 --> 13:32.560]  achieve digital immortality they're now announcing that manufactured terror not
[13:32.560 --> 13:36.840]  the economy will dominate 2016 election I tend to agree with Nemo they're getting
[13:36.840 --> 13:40.320]  ready for some false flags or some provocateur garbage to open the gate up
[13:40.320 --> 13:44.520]  and let the jihadis they help fund the Middle East come in that's not saying
[13:44.520 --> 13:47.920]  it's a pure false flag they just are going to fund the enemy to attack us
[13:47.920 --> 13:53.040]  continuing we're going to get again back to Joe Biggs report car hacking someone
[13:53.040 --> 13:57.200]  dies at the end is the name of that powerful video it's a great way to
[13:57.200 --> 14:02.520]  expose with these black boxes in the cars are really doing that is all coming
[14:02.520 --> 14:07.760]  up then the new trends journal is out Gerald Salente is going to be on for an
[14:07.760 --> 14:13.320]  hour we're going to take 30 minutes of calls with him and then in the third hour
[14:13.320 --> 14:17.160]  I want to condense what we did over two hours of the three-hour broadcast
[14:17.160 --> 14:22.360]  yesterday but I want to discipline myself I did a pretty good job but still not
[14:22.360 --> 14:26.800]  radiography as some have called it where you just take each caller no matter
[14:26.800 --> 14:31.400]  what they get 45 seconds I want to open the phones up and say are you for
[14:31.400 --> 14:35.400]  vaccines or against vaccines and have you been damaged by vaccines or a
[14:35.400 --> 14:39.520]  vaccine's helped you no one called in yesterday out of probably 20 something
[14:39.520 --> 14:44.240]  calls we took who said vaccines had helped them it was I got polio from it
[14:44.240 --> 14:48.280]  or I got paralyzed from it or my my wife was forced to take it the Marines
[14:48.280 --> 14:52.400]  pregnant and she had a miscarriage the next day on and on and on but we're
[14:52.400 --> 14:58.000]  going to open the phones up again imagine over 170 AM and FM affiliates huge
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.720]  internet audience Roku boxy TV stations you know in Houston you know carrying
[15:03.720 --> 15:11.640]  the show no one calls in millions of live listeners calls in to defend I wish
[15:11.640 --> 15:15.920]  that caller would have called in to go you rednecks need to take your shots like
[15:15.920 --> 15:21.400]  like we're against medical science we're against medical tyranny and forced
[15:21.400 --> 15:26.680]  inoculations with a government caught spiking vaccines and a UN caught spiking
[15:26.680 --> 15:33.160]  them and it's it's it's you pseudo intellectuals that think anyone from
[15:33.160 --> 15:38.680]  Texas or the South is stupid that that aren't real intellectuals you just call
[15:38.680 --> 15:44.400]  in there are people it's the hippies and it's the highly educated liberals you
[15:44.400 --> 15:48.040]  can look at the numbers they've had AP articles breaking it down it's liberal
[15:48.040 --> 15:52.040]  people with more than two degrees two or more degrees that are the most
[15:52.040 --> 15:59.800]  unvaccinated look it up it is the real liberals not the pop liberals that are
[15:59.800 --> 16:03.800]  unvaccinated because they're not stupid it is the most liberal counties in
[16:03.800 --> 16:07.800]  northern California have the highest rates of no vaccination because they're
[16:07.800 --> 16:13.160]  not stupid those type of liberals that socially you're for a quality in things
[16:13.160 --> 16:19.040]  and I agree with a lot of their views I'm a paleo conservative or a libertarian
[16:19.040 --> 16:22.800]  you call me a classical liberal if because I love Thomas Jefferson I've
[16:22.800 --> 16:26.480]  actually read his writings read his books read his letters I agree with Thomas
[16:26.480 --> 16:31.520]  Jefferson 100% basically so you could call me a liberal but none of these
[16:31.520 --> 16:35.000]  terms mean anything I'm more allied with mainline conservatives because at
[16:35.000 --> 16:41.840]  least their pro-life anti-infanticide anti eugenics and on the surface
[16:41.840 --> 16:46.400]  anti-surveillance state they tend to be police state oriented in some ways and
[16:46.400 --> 16:51.160]  warmongers and I'm reaching out to them trying to get them to wake up but I'm
[16:51.160 --> 16:54.480]  more allied with what you call the left when it comes to not wanting to have a
[16:54.480 --> 16:59.000]  bunch of imperial wars the problem is under the so-called left we get even
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.640]  bigger wars they just don't call them that they call them humanitarian so in
[17:04.640 --> 17:09.240]  the third hour we're going to open the phones up on your vaccine stories your
[17:09.240 --> 17:13.600]  take on vaccines but just have it ready because we're gonna go right to you and
[17:13.600 --> 17:21.760]  I'm going to do it this Brian Williams story is coming up as well and it's
[17:21.760 --> 17:27.760]  incredibly important because it's not just about Brian Williams coming in an
[17:27.760 --> 17:32.160]  hour later an hour and a half later on a helicopter into a zone where a
[17:32.160 --> 17:35.880]  helicopter had been shot down and claiming he was on that helicopter it
[17:35.880 --> 17:40.120]  isn't like he was behind another helicopter and it was the fog of war and
[17:40.120 --> 17:44.440]  he just kind of conflated and exaggerated and said I was in a
[17:44.440 --> 17:49.200]  helicopter that was shot down he completely lied the network back team
[17:49.200 --> 17:53.120]  the entire news crew of six people that were with him back team that another
[17:53.120 --> 17:57.760]  helicopter full of more crew behind him this was a conspiracy to make him some
[17:57.760 --> 18:04.640]  type of war hero you know my cousin's dad who died last year we were just
[18:04.640 --> 18:07.280]  talking about it before the show he never bragged about it but we dug
[18:07.280 --> 18:11.480]  through his army chest one time and he you know had the bronze star and all
[18:11.480 --> 18:15.200]  that type of stuff he was shot down seven times in Vietnam because he
[18:15.200 --> 18:21.080]  delivered special forces to hot zones and had made other crash landings but
[18:21.080 --> 18:24.680]  you know what let's just take his bronze star away and we'll give it to Brian
[18:24.680 --> 18:30.520]  Williams because Brian Williams says that he's this big hero who was shot down
[18:30.520 --> 18:35.400]  on the helicopter but the people in the military that were actually there have
[18:35.400 --> 18:39.400]  now exposed him as a liar at first he said no I was shot down now he's been
[18:39.400 --> 18:44.360]  caught yet again and we have a clip of Hillary Clinton doing the same thing
[18:44.360 --> 18:48.400]  claiming she was in a C-130 over Bosnia that got shot up turned out none of that
[18:48.400 --> 18:54.960]  happened these are congenital degenerate liars I mean I've never been in the
[18:54.960 --> 18:59.920]  military I've never been shot down I've never been shot and I would just never
[18:59.920 --> 19:06.280]  imagine that I would then just make up that I had been shot down but that shows
[19:06.280 --> 19:10.480]  how much they lie it shows how they think they can get away with anything it
[19:10.480 --> 19:16.680]  shows how they are preying on the public you know yesterday I called this
[19:16.680 --> 19:20.240]  reporter that was saying how dare you you know to Rand Paul and implying that
[19:20.240 --> 19:22.720]  he's an idiot and all this over saying we should have the choice not to be
[19:22.720 --> 19:27.040]  vaccinated I called her a media whore and as soon as I said that I had the
[19:27.040 --> 19:32.800]  image of MSNBC CNN raw story media matters saying I called her a physical
[19:32.800 --> 19:40.360]  whore which I did sure enough raw story media matters MSNBC headline Alex Jones
[19:40.360 --> 19:44.960]  defense Rand Paul vaccine statements by calling CBS host a tramp and a whore in
[19:44.960 --> 19:49.360]  quotes but then later in the article they have it quotes media whore so see
[19:49.360 --> 19:53.000]  that's that's being a media whore what they did deceiving the public I didn't
[19:53.000 --> 19:58.720]  claim she was a street walker for a prostitute I said she was a media whore

[25:27.600 --> 25:33.080]  much I want to get into member last week the second grader in Texas she was
[25:33.080 --> 25:36.280]  joking around saying I have the ring of power I can disappear you can disappear
[25:36.280 --> 25:40.800]  they called that a threat kicked him out of school called the police well now the
[25:40.800 --> 25:45.120]  stories on info wars calm there's video of it from court man arrested on
[25:45.120 --> 25:49.880]  terrorism charges for carrying protein snacks detained and jailed for 23 hours
[25:49.880 --> 25:56.400]  video proves TSA lied in court they went ahead and tried to convict him of
[25:56.400 --> 26:02.760]  having explosives and threatening him for power bars the most popular longest
[26:02.760 --> 26:06.560]  selling I mean power bars been around for decades any more on those you can
[26:06.560 --> 26:10.800]  buy these at 7-eleven it contains milk grain and sugar but they went ahead and
[26:10.800 --> 26:16.520]  said it was a bomb and went to court and tried to put him in prison that's what's
[26:16.520 --> 26:19.360]  crazy about this a few years ago I had the guy on there trying to put life in
[26:19.360 --> 26:23.240]  prison for taping the police at his own house they were calling it wiretapping in
[26:23.240 --> 26:28.280]  Illinois and you just go you're really gonna try to put him in jail for life
[26:28.280 --> 26:34.640]  calling it wiretapping when you knew he was recording you it's like these
[26:34.640 --> 26:38.400]  police videos where they clearly beat somebody with a baton and then charge
[26:38.400 --> 26:45.200]  them with assaulting them I mean it's just crazy town it's crazy town you know
[26:45.200 --> 26:52.800]  I was mentioning MSNBC this is from Politico MSC suffers its lowest ratings
[26:52.800 --> 27:01.840]  in a decade this came out yesterday they have an average of 55,000 viewers in the
[27:01.840 --> 27:07.520]  all-important 25 to 54 year old and on average their shows only have a couple
[27:07.520 --> 27:11.560]  hundred thousand viewers ladies and gentlemen do you understand that this
[27:11.560 --> 27:15.880]  broadcast rated and most our stations don't even subscribe to that so it's not
[27:15.880 --> 27:19.400]  covered the last time they had an ad agency break the numbers down it was
[27:19.400 --> 27:23.800]  almost 400,000 people every 15 minutes that tune into this that was a couple
[27:23.800 --> 27:29.840]  years ago and that's just AM and FM millions on YouTube every day millions
[27:29.840 --> 27:34.040]  on the streams and the podcast everything else together three million a day
[27:34.040 --> 27:39.720]  tune in throughout the three hours I mean these people are a joke
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.320]  MSNBC when they first launched had like 10 million viewers on their big shows
[27:44.320 --> 27:48.080]  and it's not just because the internet and more choices came along that was
[27:48.080 --> 27:54.920]  part of their slide but what's killing them is they're they're baloney everyone
[27:54.920 --> 27:58.000]  agrees we should all take vaccines and Rand Paul's a kook let's arrest anybody
[27:58.000 --> 28:03.000]  that doesn't well I come out and say you're a media whore here's the article
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.440]  right here from the White House run media matters and then here's another
[28:07.440 --> 28:12.880]  raw story Alex Jones defends listener Rand Paul on vaccines by attacking
[28:12.880 --> 28:17.200]  whore trash tramp Phil scum CNBC anchor course those are all taken out of
[28:17.200 --> 28:21.920]  context you actually read later in the article it says that Alex Jones called
[28:21.920 --> 28:27.760]  her a media whore there's another article on a raw story you can flip to
[28:27.760 --> 28:31.960]  that and it's got Jones yelling you arrogant piece of garbage I'm sick of
[28:31.960 --> 28:35.520]  all you people up here lecturing us she's the type of woman that wants Superbowl
[28:35.520 --> 28:40.240]  ads to say sorry you had a boy all a bunch of pinheaded cult members Jones
[28:40.240 --> 28:45.840]  called Evans a media whore and I went on for saying no she's a pimp pimping out
[28:45.840 --> 28:49.040]  her audience with disinformation they took it out of context and just say
[28:49.040 --> 28:54.000]  whore but in the article covering their butt they say media whore close quote big
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.920]  difference saying she'll whore herself out the vaccine makers but when they're
[28:58.920 --> 29:03.920]  done how dare him call a woman a whore I didn't call her a physical street walk
[29:03.920 --> 29:09.880]  and whore by the way I got a lot more respect for a street walk and whore than
[29:09.880 --> 29:13.680]  a person like this shelling out folks with deadly vaccines and saying that
[29:13.680 --> 29:18.400]  there's no side effects I'll call Megan Kelly a media whore as well up there
[29:18.400 --> 29:22.400]  saying there's no side effects it's totally safe take it we need big brother
[29:22.400 --> 29:28.160]  and we're talking about kids getting hurt here you are media whores you are
[29:28.160 --> 29:33.760]  pimps for the vaccine companies pimping out your poor audiences I'll say it
[29:33.760 --> 29:37.520]  again and again and again media whore media whore media whore and I call men

[33:32.120 --> 33:36.400]  you think about that journey the journey is the destination let's put a
[33:36.400 --> 33:42.400]  little bit of this robert plant bringing us in my love is in lead with the

[34:47.080 --> 34:50.200]  you've got it out there briefly before I get back into the news and the
[34:50.200 --> 34:57.560]  special report this ad that I just cut impromptu yesterday that Rob Jacobson
[34:57.560 --> 35:01.200]  put together I think it is a really good act as it says it all and I was
[35:01.200 --> 35:06.920]  thinking just last week why just have Valentine's Day be about roses and you
[35:06.920 --> 35:11.200]  know going out to eat and standing in line and trying to get a reservation why
[35:11.200 --> 35:14.240]  not make it about human empowerment it's not just about men and women loving
[35:14.240 --> 35:18.360]  each other it's about humanity loving ourselves building something better so
[35:18.360 --> 35:21.520]  every February and I tend to make videos about this and stuff not just a
[35:21.520 --> 35:25.680]  pitch for super male or super female vitality to really make February maybe
[35:25.680 --> 35:29.060]  it'll get picked up on at least here are millions of listeners human
[35:29.060 --> 35:35.520]  empowerment month and a celebration of George Washington Carver and Beethoven
[35:35.520 --> 35:44.120]  and Leonardo da Vinci and Moses and just all the other amazing type people that
[35:44.120 --> 35:50.320]  have come along George Washington so instead of black history month or white
[35:50.320 --> 35:54.280]  history month how about human history month human empowerment month and it's
[35:54.280 --> 35:59.720]  a great way to start is by getting juiced up on high quality herbs and things
[35:59.720 --> 36:04.160]  that'll basically block out and supercharge and stop the globalist on
[36:04.160 --> 36:08.080]  slot to a great extent I'm I am powered by super male vitality I take it now
[36:08.080 --> 36:11.880]  religiously a couple times a day take it easy when you first start taking it
[36:11.880 --> 36:16.280]  because it's it's really hardcore and just consult your physicians it's 20%
[36:16.280 --> 36:20.320]  off in the month of February so as a super female super female is the same
[36:20.320 --> 36:24.560]  formula it's just got few extra herbs and at the turbo charge women and aren't
[36:24.560 --> 36:30.360]  so good for men I guess you could say but some men I take the super female it's
[36:30.360 --> 36:35.720]  got it's got the scientific name of one of the herbs it has a very crass name one
[36:35.720 --> 36:39.360]  of them has to do with goats but the point is this is not a game it's the
[36:39.360 --> 36:43.400]  real deal it's the ultimate Valentine's present so let's go ahead and play this
[36:43.400 --> 36:49.080]  new ad the month of February is all about Valentine's Day big heart shaped

[36:57.840 --> 37:01.480]  all about human potential I'm all about the individual being empowered the
[37:01.480 --> 37:05.640]  establishment is the opposite that's why they spike our water with fluoride GMO

[38:58.480 --> 39:04.000]  Williams ahead of Gerald Salente joining us but you need to understand just like
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.520]  the media put out the headline that I called this news anchor a whore knowing
[39:07.520 --> 39:11.000]  women would think I was calling her a physical whore I called her a media whore
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.960]  and then I defined that she was sold out to the company you call anybody that
[39:15.960 --> 39:19.840]  sells out to corruption a whore oh that guy's a whore he'll do anything for
[39:19.840 --> 39:24.080]  money and I said she's a media whore pimping out her audience so they took
[39:24.080 --> 39:28.160]  it out of context why not why didn't she just claim maybe she's a helicopter
[39:28.160 --> 39:32.000]  commander or maybe she's an astronaut you know like Brian Williams it's the same
[39:32.000 --> 39:39.800]  group NBC let's go ahead and go to this piece on another person that I thinks a
[39:39.800 --> 39:43.560]  liar I think that's fair to say I mean Bill Ayers said the red star on a black
[39:43.560 --> 39:47.360]  background on his website has nothing to do with communism I mean give me at least
[39:47.360 --> 39:53.200]  a phone the most famous living commies of course I mean it's ridiculous how they
[39:53.200 --> 39:57.880]  insult us I'm gonna head Rothschild on the head of the Rothschild dynasty I got
[39:57.880 --> 40:03.720]  him on because he had a book out and he tried trying to get off once you figure
[40:03.720 --> 40:06.560]  out who I was he thought I was Alex Jones of the New York Times and the
[40:06.560 --> 40:10.720]  Shoren scene center that's happened a bunch and once I got him on he tried to
[40:10.720 --> 40:14.720]  get off and I go why are the ice caps on Mars melting if ours are melting and
[40:14.720 --> 40:18.760]  he goes because it's closer to the Sun than the earth no it's not but he thinks
[40:18.760 --> 40:23.520]  my audience is dumb it's the fourth planet out ladies and gentlemen Mercury
[40:23.520 --> 40:30.160]  Venus Earth Mars then the gas giants then the Kuiper belt I mean look it
[40:30.160 --> 40:34.560]  doesn't work we know 2 plus 2 equals 4 we know raising the debt limit raises the
[40:34.560 --> 40:39.080]  debt limit we know everything's not awesome oh America and freedoms awesome
[40:39.080 --> 40:43.080]  you people trying to screw it over aren't let's go to this Bill Ayers
[40:43.080 --> 40:55.640]  report info wars.com we're posting it right now info wars.com as well Bill Ayers
[40:55.640 --> 41:03.480]  is he a terrorist a communist question mark a liar a bomb exploded early this
[41:03.480 --> 41:07.480]  morning in the Pentagon and left-wing terrorist telephone newspapers to say
[41:07.480 --> 41:11.440]  they were responsible we felt pretty grim and pretty determined at the same
[41:11.440 --> 41:16.360]  time that we were going to see this thing through at midday the Associated
[41:16.360 --> 41:20.080]  Press got a phone call from a man saying he was with the weather underground
[41:20.080 --> 41:23.960]  and that bombs would explode at the departments of Interior and Agriculture
[41:23.960 --> 41:28.880]  and the Smithsonian before the day was out the sense was that we had to do
[41:28.880 --> 41:32.800]  whatever we had to do in order to stop the war people calling themselves
[41:32.800 --> 41:36.840]  members of the weather underground last night planted bombs in federal office
[41:36.840 --> 41:41.520]  buildings in Washington and open California we figured out how to use guns and
[41:41.520 --> 41:45.600]  how to use bombs I mean we we taught ourselves we trained ourselves how to do
[41:45.600 --> 41:49.800]  it some people felt literally that the bigger the mess we could make the better
[41:49.800 --> 41:53.240]  credit for the capital bombing was claimed in a letter received by the
[41:53.240 --> 41:57.600]  Associated Press today signed by the weather underground the underground
[41:57.600 --> 42:00.800]  weatherman organization claimed responsibility for the San Francisco and
[42:00.800 --> 42:05.000]  Sacramento bombings the explosion destroyed one of the Pentagon's 140
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.840]  women's restrooms and blasted out a wall on the fourth floor and I've been
[42:08.840 --> 42:13.400]  quoted again and again is saying I don't regret it and frankly and and saying I
[42:13.400 --> 42:17.680]  don't think we did enough and I don't think we did enough
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.960]  Bill Ayers thank you so much for coming on with us today again Bill Ayers dot
[42:22.960 --> 42:27.720]  ORG I have no idea what you're talking about yeah I've never heard of that but
[42:27.720 --> 42:30.880]  that's fascinating you know I'm so bewildered about what you're talking
[42:30.880 --> 42:38.760]  about I'm I didn't know he was doing that I had no idea you've got these
[42:38.760 --> 42:44.840]  great theories but I don't know we're not talking in the same language but this
[42:44.840 --> 42:48.360]  is news to me I have no idea what you're referring to again I know nothing
[42:48.360 --> 42:51.840]  about George Soros I'm not sure what that means Alex I don't know what you're
[42:51.840 --> 42:59.600]  referring to I have no idea what you're referring to
[42:59.600 --> 43:03.440]  I don't know what again what are you referring to never have been I don't know
[43:03.440 --> 43:07.000]  what you're referring to who are you talking about and I don't even know
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.280]  what that means I hear your paranoia eating through but I don't know what
[43:11.280 --> 43:14.560]  you're talking about because you know what I'm gonna do with all this we're
[43:14.560 --> 43:18.480]  gonna take this live interview and then take clips of what you're saying and
[43:18.480 --> 43:22.320]  then show them throughout that's the whole point I don't know what you're
[43:22.320 --> 43:29.320]  talking about I see well where do you want to start they estimated that they
[43:29.320 --> 43:34.920]  would have to eliminate 25 million people in these reeducation centers and
[43:34.920 --> 43:40.880]  when I say eliminate I mean kill 25 million people then let me just start
[43:40.880 --> 43:46.920]  with communism itself because most communists say they're socialist but
[43:46.920 --> 43:50.320]  then when you get around them in person they start telling you about violent
[43:50.320 --> 43:55.640]  overthrows and the plan to take over do you endorse the type of communism we
[43:55.640 --> 44:01.040]  saw in Russia in China or how would you really describe yourself well the
[44:01.040 --> 44:05.440]  answer to your question is no but you know I've been a person in my whole
[44:05.440 --> 44:09.480]  life as an educator I've opposed the notion of labeling people in a simple
[44:09.480 --> 44:13.280]  minded way but yes I am opposed to capitalism
[44:13.280 --> 44:18.800]  recognizing a communist physical appearance counts for nothing if he
[44:18.800 --> 44:24.280]  openly declares himself to be a communist we take his word for it I think
[44:24.280 --> 44:29.320]  that we should downsize the Pentagon by about 90% I think we should stop the
[44:29.320 --> 44:33.720]  war industry I think we should stop arming the the dictators and petty
[44:33.720 --> 44:37.880]  fascists all over the world I think we should become a nation among nations
[44:37.880 --> 44:42.440]  not the uber nation not the controller of everything so in that sense Alex we've
[44:42.440 --> 44:47.840]  already found a point of unity very good tactics about getting a point of
[44:47.840 --> 44:52.640]  unity why if you were a green beret in a village with the village elders having a
[44:52.640 --> 44:56.880]  debate you'd find that first point of unity common ground in a month you'd
[44:56.880 --> 44:59.960]  have them fighting for you and I understand that but but you're not a
[44:59.960 --> 45:04.320]  green beret you fight for a different army this is a guy who lives in my
[45:04.320 --> 45:14.160]  neighborhood who's a professor of English in Chicago who I know and who I
[45:14.160 --> 45:19.000]  have not received some official endorsement from he's not somebody who
[45:19.000 --> 45:25.160]  exchange ideas from on a regular basis what is your view of Barack Obama then
[45:25.160 --> 45:29.920]  I've always had the same view of Barack Obama as long as I've known him I've
[45:29.920 --> 45:35.440]  known him for a long long time Barack Obama as he said of himself in the 2008
[45:35.440 --> 45:39.680]  campaign and as he said it as he's defined himself all through his political
[45:39.680 --> 45:43.680]  life he says of himself I'm a moderate middle-of-the-road pragmatic
[45:43.680 --> 45:48.360]  compromising politician that's who we said he is that's who he is the right
[45:48.360 --> 45:52.160]  wing looked at him and said no he's not that what he is instead is a secret
[45:52.160 --> 45:56.400]  Muslim who pals around with terrorists and has socialist ideas I have yet to
[45:56.400 --> 46:00.200]  see a socialist idea come out of Barack are you are you kidding he's talking
[46:00.200 --> 46:04.760]  about free community college and open borders put simply what I'd like to do
[46:04.760 --> 46:09.760]  is to see the first two years of community college free for everybody
[46:09.760 --> 46:15.120]  who's willing to work for last week I sent a letter to Congress asking them to
[46:15.120 --> 46:18.560]  increase penalties on smugglers and to give us flexibility to move migrants
[46:18.560 --> 46:22.680]  through the system faster what do you think about Obama wanting a domestic
[46:22.680 --> 46:26.680]  security force just as big and just as strong as our military and having youth
[46:26.680 --> 46:32.480]  brigades chanting his name I'm is that I didn't know he was doing that we've
[46:32.480 --> 46:37.320]  got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful just as
[46:37.320 --> 46:52.680]  strong just as well-funded is what I wear you know I knew Barack Obama about
[46:52.680 --> 46:56.280]  as well as thousands and thousands of other people it's not that we we weren't
[46:56.280 --> 47:01.040]  intimate friends we never shared a milkshake with two straws never all right
[47:01.040 --> 47:05.320]  well I wouldn't nobody ever said you did that you'd have to be cuddling to be
[47:05.320 --> 47:10.680]  done man those friends I was never dated Barack Obama I never dated him right
[47:10.680 --> 47:16.000]  okay toward the end of 1968 I had really decided that I was committed to being a
[47:16.000 --> 47:20.440]  part of what I thought was going to be a really serious and ongoing rebellion
[47:20.440 --> 47:23.760]  upheaval that had the potential of not just ending the war but a really
[47:23.760 --> 47:29.240]  overthrowing the capitalist system who funds you because I've read you're
[47:29.240 --> 47:32.400]  connected to the Ford Foundation Carnegie and others have you ever gotten
[47:32.400 --> 47:36.480]  any funding from those guys never and I don't even know what that means who funds
[47:36.480 --> 47:41.280]  me I'm a retired professor I live in modestly like other retired professors
[47:41.280 --> 47:45.800]  I'm not sure what you're saying there's not a CIA program back to the 50s to fund
[47:45.800 --> 47:50.520]  liberation theology that I know you're fully aware of at university campuses I
[47:50.520 --> 47:55.640]  I hear your paranoia eking through but I don't know what you're talking about
[47:55.640 --> 48:00.080]  liberation theology has nothing to do with campuses it's a movement within the
[48:00.080 --> 48:03.600]  Catholic Church is it a left-wing movement in the Catholic Church yes it
[48:03.600 --> 48:09.440]  is does it come out of Brazil it does this Pope Francis to some extent is he
[48:09.440 --> 48:13.280]  somewhat said influenced by that apparently he is all boy that has to do
[48:13.280 --> 48:21.640]  with me are you excited about Pope Francis and his liberation theology it's
[48:21.640 --> 48:25.640]  hard for me to get excited about a pope I know that for those of you who are
[48:25.640 --> 48:29.840]  Catholic he's infallible so I guess the Catholics must be excited about him
[48:29.840 --> 48:34.680]  I think that when he says who am I to judge and when he opens himself to the
[48:34.680 --> 48:39.680]  possibility of greater freedom for women I think those are good things and of
[48:39.680 --> 48:43.840]  course carbon taxes for George Soros though I'm not sure what that means
[48:43.840 --> 48:47.920]  Alex I mean I know you've got that a big paranoid background that's somewhere
[48:47.920 --> 48:52.200]  bubbling up but I thought you don't know who I am hold on a minute a big
[48:52.200 --> 48:56.280]  paranoid background now killed 84 million people according to Chinese
[48:56.280 --> 49:00.920]  government the CIA says 60 million are you saying that I shouldn't be worried
[49:00.920 --> 49:05.240]  about communism I didn't say that at all you said something about George Soros I
[49:05.240 --> 49:09.480]  don't know anything about George Soros let me ask you this I don't know what
[49:09.480 --> 49:13.680]  you're drawing on so you know nothing about George Soros and we have a big
[49:13.680 --> 49:20.640]  problem global warming requires big investment and that could be the motor
[49:20.640 --> 49:28.640]  of the world economy you've got these great theories but I don't know we're
[49:28.640 --> 49:35.600]  not talking the same language exactly you're speaking academia speech we're
[49:35.600 --> 49:40.320]  here this nice mild-mannered guy and you're there with your significant other
[49:40.320 --> 49:43.680]  Bernadine Dorn I guess you guys were never involved in any bombings or
[49:43.680 --> 49:47.280]  anything right no that's not true we were involved in trying to stop the
[49:47.280 --> 49:51.920]  murder of 6,000 people a week by our government that dragged on for 10 years
[49:51.920 --> 49:56.400]  we conduct that we I was involved in nonviolent citizens I was involved in
[49:56.400 --> 50:02.640]  all kinds of tactics that were legal and eventually we did turn to to what I
[50:02.640 --> 50:08.240]  would call extreme vandalism we destroyed property to raise a screaming
[50:08.240 --> 50:13.720]  opposition to the murder of 6,000 people you didn't bomb police officers or
[50:13.720 --> 50:18.520]  blind police officers not at all nothing like that ever happened I know it's part
[50:18.520 --> 50:22.000]  of the narrative of the right but it's just not true really so weatherman bombs
[50:22.000 --> 50:28.360]  never wounded police I'm sorry weatherman bombs never wounded police never
[50:28.360 --> 50:31.760]  because you know what I'm gonna do with all this we're gonna take this live
[50:31.760 --> 50:35.440]  interview and then take clips of what you're saying and then and then show
[50:35.440 --> 50:39.720]  them throughout that's the whole point I don't know what you're talking about the
[50:39.720 --> 50:42.920]  FBI said the weather underground organization which took credit for the
[50:42.920 --> 50:46.640]  bombing is the same radical group which was responsible for the bombing of the
[50:46.640 --> 50:53.280]  U.S. Capitol in 1971 and the Pentagon in 1972 they will fight the internal army
[50:53.280 --> 50:58.760]  which is the police force yes more physical contact whatever it takes
[50:58.760 --> 51:03.880]  we'll do by any means possible there's no way to be committed to nonviolence in
[51:03.880 --> 51:07.120]  the middle of the most violent society that history's ever created I'm not
[51:07.120 --> 51:12.680]  committed to nonviolence in any way I don't want to waste our time here with a
[51:12.680 --> 51:18.160]  he said she said I go to your website bill airs.org and there's a red star on
[51:18.160 --> 51:22.720]  a black background up there looks pretty malice to me you say you didn't like
[51:22.720 --> 51:29.040]  now was Larry Graf wall wrong that you guys followed a malice cultural
[51:29.040 --> 51:33.560]  revolution style system at the weatherman yeah he was wrong and he was
[51:33.560 --> 51:38.000]  lying but the red star in the black background is also the signal for
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.600]  Heineken beer and Macy's so be careful what you worry about but here's the
[51:42.600 --> 51:48.040]  come on man you're a famous commie for just a minute you love linen there are
[51:48.040 --> 51:55.440]  other communists who don't show their real faces who work more silently first of
[51:55.440 --> 51:59.520]  all I'm not famous secondly I don't know what you meant when you said bill airs
[51:59.520 --> 52:04.000]  supporters call in you we haven't had one substantive exchange you and me so I
[52:04.000 --> 52:08.120]  don't know what one would think to be a supporter you mean if somebody has read
[52:08.120 --> 52:11.520]  one of my books and has somebody to say about it we haven't talked about anything
[52:11.520 --> 52:15.480]  substance okay well you're again you're setting and defining things like MSNBC
[52:15.480 --> 52:19.280]  saying parents your kids don't belong to you let me ask you this question do you
[52:19.280 --> 52:24.520]  support abortion wait when did I say that when did I say parents don't belong
[52:24.520 --> 52:30.080]  to their I said MSNBC said that no they did not what are you talking about I
[52:30.080 --> 52:33.000]  didn't want to break through this view that you know kids belong to their
[52:33.000 --> 52:37.320]  parents and that they actually belong to the wider community I've got you know
[52:37.320 --> 52:40.640]  I'm so bewildered about what you're talking about so part of it is we have
[52:40.640 --> 52:44.200]  to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents
[52:44.200 --> 52:47.200]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole
[52:47.200 --> 52:51.320]  communities here's where I stand professor airs I don't know if you've
[52:51.320 --> 52:56.160]  read none dare call it conspiracy by Gary Allen I read that book back when I
[52:56.160 --> 53:02.560]  was like 14 years old since then pretty much all of it has been proven to be
[53:02.560 --> 53:07.520]  accurate from my perspective we're ultra-rich crony capitalist fun
[53:07.520 --> 53:11.760]  socialist and communist movements but also fascist movements because they like
[53:11.760 --> 53:15.840]  to deal with command and control systems with domesticated populations and I
[53:15.840 --> 53:20.520]  think that history shown that collectivism delivers hell on earth and
[53:20.520 --> 53:27.480]  forced work camps now that's why I disagree with you fundamentally and I
[53:27.480 --> 53:31.640]  guess you believe that we have a real form of capitalism and you disagree with
[53:31.640 --> 53:37.200]  that I don't believe we have capitalism I believe we have fascism sitting on
[53:37.200 --> 53:41.120]  top of a socialist management system that the left-right paradigm that's
[53:41.120 --> 53:46.080]  taught is a fraud what do you say I have no idea what you're talking about you
[53:46.080 --> 53:49.680]  know I've never heard of that but that's fascinating I don't know what again
[53:49.680 --> 53:52.960]  what are you referring to never have been I don't know what you're referring to
[53:52.960 --> 53:58.920]  who are you talking about and I don't even know what that means oh boy well
[53:58.920 --> 54:03.000]  that's that's the hardcore commie trying to trying to try to charm us and oh I
[54:03.000 --> 54:08.280]  don't know this oh I don't know that and for radio listeners we show the cops he
[54:08.280 --> 54:13.080]  bombed that he blinded and and and and hurt and or the weatherman quote did that
[54:13.080 --> 54:18.360]  he led and we show the documentation the big government foundations funding him
[54:18.360 --> 54:22.920]  directly with mainstream news articles so that's really a TV piece so I'm just
[54:22.920 --> 54:26.760]  adding some of that for the radio listeners understand that the guy is an
[54:26.760 --> 54:31.960]  absolutely deceptive creature as if you need me to tell you that but Brian
[54:31.960 --> 54:37.480]  Williams said that he was shot down in a helicopter by an RPG turns out it was an
[54:37.480 --> 54:41.080]  hour or more till they flew into an area where helicopter been shot down
[54:41.080 --> 54:45.440]  military started going public and I got a bunch of these clips of him at baseball
[54:45.440 --> 54:51.520]  games at Rangers games first saying and of course on Letterman and now he's
[54:51.520 --> 54:58.080]  recanted let's go back and play this liar on Letterman we were north of the
[54:58.080 --> 55:02.640]  invasion we were the northernmost Americans in Iraq we were going to drop
[55:02.640 --> 55:07.200]  some bridge portions across the Euphrates so the third infantry could cross on
[55:07.200 --> 55:12.000]  them two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire including the one I
[55:12.000 --> 55:17.880]  was in no RPG and AK-47 what what altitude we hit we were only at a hundred
[55:17.880 --> 55:21.480]  feet doing a hundred forward knots because we had these massive pieces of
[55:21.480 --> 55:25.360]  bridge beneath us on slings what happens the minute everybody realizes you've
[55:25.360 --> 55:30.520]  been hit we figure out how to land safely and we did we landed very quickly
[55:30.520 --> 55:36.360]  and hard and we put down and we were stuck four birds in the middle of the
[55:36.360 --> 55:41.320]  desert and we were north out ahead that's another he goes on embellishing the
[55:41.320 --> 55:46.440]  lie I mean this is a book he's trying to write here of baloney now let's go to
[55:46.440 --> 55:50.280]  him being forced to recant then we'll go to the Hillary clip a flashback a few
[55:50.280 --> 55:53.880]  years ago to her saying she was basically in a C-130 that got shot down
[55:53.880 --> 55:59.160]  that was total bull as well from a pack of liars let's go to him recanting on
[55:59.160 --> 56:04.080]  this broadcast last week in an effort to honor and thank a veteran who protected
[56:04.080 --> 56:09.000]  me and so many others after a ground fire incident in the desert during the
[56:09.000 --> 56:15.080]  Iraq war invasion I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago it
[56:15.080 --> 56:19.640]  did not take long to hear from some brave men and women in the air crews who
[56:19.640 --> 56:24.720]  were also in that desert I want to apologize I said I was traveling in an
[56:24.720 --> 56:31.280]  aircraft that was hit by RPG fire I was instead in a following aircraft we all
[56:31.280 --> 56:36.280]  landed after the ground fire incident and spent two harrowing nights in a sand
[56:36.280 --> 56:42.120]  storm in the Iraq desert this was a bungled attempt by me to thank one
[56:42.120 --> 56:46.960]  special veteran and by extension of our brave military men and see our brave
[56:46.960 --> 56:50.840]  military men and women I'm thinking a veteran I'm not bad doesn't matter I
[56:50.840 --> 56:54.200]  showed up an hour an hour and a half later it doesn't matter I totally lied
[56:54.200 --> 56:58.440]  in dozens of interviews and at Rangers games and on TV with all this stuff
[56:58.440 --> 57:03.640]  you're back lying again to cover up the last line hey let us have world
[57:03.640 --> 57:06.840]  government or you're against the vets hey turn your guns or you're against
[57:06.840 --> 57:11.800]  black people you know or be for Obamacare I mean it's the same garbage old lies
[57:11.800 --> 57:17.600]  for new now let's play a club of Hillary another hero another commando I'm like
[57:17.600 --> 57:21.560]  private Lynch we should put women in frontline combat put a 75 pound pack on
[57:21.560 --> 57:26.400]  Hillary let me tell you now let's go to that clip I remember landing under
[57:26.400 --> 57:30.800]  sniper fire in the speech last week senator Clinton was referring to her
[57:30.800 --> 57:37.640]  visit to Tuzla Bosnia in 1996 as first lady the brutal war was over but
[57:37.640 --> 57:42.680]  hostilities continued and though the trip was exactly 12 years ago tomorrow the
[57:42.680 --> 57:47.400]  memory seemed etched in Clinton's mind there was supposed to be some kind of
[57:47.400 --> 57:51.120]  a greeting ceremony at the airport but instead we just ran with our heads down
[57:51.120 --> 57:56.960]  to get into the vehicles to get to our base problem is that's not what happened
[57:56.960 --> 58:01.640]  and we should know CBS News accompanied the first lady and daughter Chelsea on
[58:01.640 --> 58:06.440]  that Bosnia trip that senator Clinton talking to me on the military flight into
[58:06.440 --> 58:10.200]  Tuzla and these are the pictures we recorded of the greeting ceremony when
[58:10.200 --> 58:15.000]  the plane landed compare that to senator Clinton's account I remember landing
[58:15.000 --> 58:22.680]  under sniper fire there was no greeting ceremony okay we were in the air when
[58:22.680 --> 58:27.520]  it got shot up I mean they're a pack of lying criminals okay and these are the
[58:27.520 --> 58:30.880]  people that want you to take vaccines they tell the fellow deserves federal

[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:29.200]  trends forecaster joining us well open the phones up for him as well I haven't
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:33.720]  had time to get to this but I'm really sick of it Matthew McConaughey has been
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:38.520]  criticized all over national television TMZ you name it he has a 22,000 acre
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:44.520]  ranch outside Austin they're calling it canned hunts out there it's a it's a
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:50.000]  cattle ranch but they do have during season hunting and they're saying it's
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.280]  a canned hunt a canned hunt is an animal in a cage you let out and shoot I mean
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.440]  white-tailed deer are like roaches they're just dying everywhere starving
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:03.280]  to death their population has never been higher but the anti-human crowd wants to
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:08.400]  then bully and demonize with their phobia of Texans their phobia of landowners
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:15.240]  their phobia of hunting Matthew McConaughey ranch straws fire over trapped deer kills
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:21.720]  and then they show look there's deer feeders they're inside pins document cam
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.960]  shop for TV viewers ladies and gentlemen's 22,000 acre ranch and of course
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:30.080]  they have corn feeders I mean they just prey on the ignorance of people that
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.440]  never been out in the woods don't know about hunting you take these deer you
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.360]  process them about I don't know if I've heard it's up to 20% of the food the
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:44.400]  homeless get is deer sausage it's excellent and if you don't we need more
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.640]  controlled kills of these white-tailed I mean they are crawling I live in Austin
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.760]  I've run into him twice Buckley almost got killed out by McConaughey's ranch
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.480]  strangely enough when one jumped out in front of him one night I mean it is you
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.800]  go in your front yard anywhere in Austin basically they'll be 50 deer at night I
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:03.360]  mean you're stumbling and then they start starving to death there's not enough
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:09.880]  food any plant they can get ahold of they eat they're like goats there I've
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.400]  talked about it it's how they prey on people's ignorance like they say Obama
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.360]  cares free and there are no death panels and blah blah blah knowing you can't
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.080]  read the bill the average person will not read the bill did you know that
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.160]  actor McConaughey is a co-founder of a canned hunting ranch by the way I'm
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.680]  against canned hunting so's Dave Mustaine he's a song about a countdown
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:36.320]  extinction there are weirdos that is very rare you know that what like a
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.920]  lion or a tiger or a Puma that he released out of a cage and they shoot it
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.640]  right there you know some fat banker you know on a golf cart they actually drive
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:50.040]  around on golf carts doing this that's not what we're talking about or they'll
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:53.960]  bring in african ibex or whatever and they're and they're on a ranch you still
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:58.760]  got to hunt them so what it's a normal human activity you don't shoot animals
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:02.200]  as you enjoy killing them it's an instinct to get the animal to butcher them
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:07.880]  it I I've explained this is very complex it's also very simple when you do the
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:12.440]  ritual of hunting and the ritual of gutting an animal it's on record in
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:18.040]  most top union psychologists break it down Carl Jung wrote about it he was
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.360]  against hunting till he started actually you know going on seeing and
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:24.400]  experiencing it it activates all these tribal memories and programs and
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:31.120]  instincts okay so you need to crawl around in freezing temperatures with a
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.920]  bow I mean that that's real hunting and then kill wild hogs up close and you know
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:38.520]  they can sometimes even try to attack you I've hunted hogs on horseback with
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:44.200]  spears and with dogs and boy they ever saw I mean you know this just I mean let
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:49.200]  me tell you it's dangerous a lot of people that do it actually wear a body
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.720]  armor on their legs and I don't have it done in probably 20 years I haven't had
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:58.880]  time but it's very exciting it's very fun and it's not that I enjoy jumping off
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:02.080]  a horse and running up with a big spear and killing a hog that two pit bulls
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:06.560]  have got it's that it's a normal human activity my ancestors did it and I mean
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:10.600]  tell you get hired in a kite doing it and it's not the killing the animal that
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.360]  you're getting off on it's the fact that you got pigs snapping with huge tusks
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:19.720]  that'll that wound and kill humans and dogs and I mean it's vicious and I'm

[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.920]  we're getting it from their vaccinated kids most of the measles is being
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:16.360]  spread by the measles vaccine that's actually buried in these news articles
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:23.200]  so we're gonna talk about that in the third hour also coming up this is
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:30.680]  strangely enough out of the Associated Press local officials complained they
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:36.400]  were left in dark on New Jersey Ebola quarantine center remember Obama said
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.080]  this is a dry run for something that's going to be airborne in the future he
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.840]  was quite honest about that all we know is they were disappearing people saying
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:48.400]  we had Ebola and I had doctors on by name saying where this was happening we
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:53.440]  then talked to let's not exaggerate 15 or more other doctors another one known
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:10:00.760]  by us personally who manages to huge facilities okay this is a director of a
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:05.440]  hospital group he said yeah we're worried about liability it looks like
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.960]  they have Ebola they're disappearing and people are now like where's the Ebola I
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:11.680]  thought it was horrible they're covering it up well now here it is in
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:16.400]  mainstream news so that's coming up in the next hour as well I don't know how
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:20.160]  bad it is I've just been saying it's going on and Forbes came out and said
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.600]  we were in a meeting with a CDC director or the bunch of media they agreed to
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:28.640]  cover it up other articles came out this is going on I don't know if there's ten
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.720]  cases or a hundred or if they're grabbing people that look like they have it
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.320]  they really have bad malaria and I don't know they're setting the precedent to
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.080]  secretly disappear people as Senator Rand Paul warned force inoculation is
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:45.920]  medical martial law now at the bottom of the hour it's a four-minute report I
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.480]  will keep Gerald with us we'll get his take on it dealing with these black
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.680]  boxes that progressive insurance and others are pushing they want to make a
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:56.640]  mandatory now to tax you and track you by the mile they're saying hackers can
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:01.280]  hack and take you over well Biggs demonstrates how dangerous this is
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.600]  with Lee and McAdoo and of course Darren McBreen and the pieces up on

[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:15.000]  is the name of the article that has the video and it's really high production
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:21.120]  quality McBreen has outdone himself with Joe Biggs being blown up in the car it's
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:25.440]  it's it's it's history channel quality stuff and I'm just so proud of the crew

[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:13.280]  more trends research dot com and he joins us but I got a sneak and suspicion
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:16.680]  because he was on hold earlier when I talked about Brian Williams that he's
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:21.800]  probably got something to say about another stolen glory phony like Hillary
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:27.720]  Clinton Gerald what's your take on Brian Williams it's a big story Alex not
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:33.080]  because he's just a typical prostitute because these are the people that lied
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:40.360]  us into the Iraq war these are the ones that sold the war and a little low life
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:49.400]  boys like him just keeps selling it a war based on lives and they just keep
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:55.960]  the lie going by bringing it to whole new levels we did a trends journal
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:07.600]  report a special report back in June of 2008 and we had some quotes from people
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:12.880]  like Katie Cork in response to Scott McClellan's book who showed how he was
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:21.120]  the the spokesperson there the the con man for Bush for a while his press
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:26.400]  secretary and showing how that they pushed the war here's a quote from Katie
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:35.040]  Cork she says quote there was such a significant march to war and people who
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:41.520]  questioned it very early on and really as the war progressed were considered
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:49.840]  unpatriotic there was a lot of pressure from the Bush White House there was a
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:57.600]  sense of pressure from the corporations who owned where we work and from
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:05.440]  government itself to really squash any kind of dissent this is from Katie Cork
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:10.880]  this is from the woman who you might want to remember she was the one that
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:20.920]  said as the war broke out I just want you to know I think Navy seals rock so
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:27.280]  you got one quote after another this is from Jessica Yellen when she was with
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:33.000]  MSNBC quote the press corps was under enormous pressure from corporate
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:40.480]  executives frankly to make sure this was a war that was presented in a way
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:47.000]  that was consistent with the patriotic fervor of the nation boy Goring and
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.520]  Hitler would have been proud of these people what a bunch of low-life little
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:15:00.600]  scum and scummets and Brian Williams is just one of them another little boy with
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:09.360]  a big mouth a bad attitude and Cajones the size of a mothball I go on I was
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:16.280]  in Kuwait for the buildup of the war and yes we heard from the Pentagon on my
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:21.800]  cell phone the minute they heard us report something that they didn't like
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:27.000]  the tone at the time was quite extraordinary hey you know who said
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:34.600]  that NBC's Brian Williams going back to Yellen the higher the president's
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:41.840]  ratings the more pressure I had from news executives to put on a positive
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:50.680]  story about the president this is America you people are disgusting you'll
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:56.640]  get sold out and buy it out for pennies on the dolly you know why because your
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:04.520]  prostitutes your whores these are whores for a war based on lies based on lies
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:08.440]  let's remember this Gerald I want to go to that but since you mentioned this I
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:13.280]  was going to bring this up later MSNBC suffers lowest ratings in a decade they
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:19.080]  only have it says 55,000 viewers an hour in a key demographic their average show
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:23.840]  a little over a hundred thousand their top shows about 250,000 that is joke
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:28.160]  level I mean you do one YouTube video and it's 200,000 views this is
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:34.640]  incredible but last night I called this reporter Kelly Evans that attacked
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.120]  Senator Rand Paul for saying we shouldn't it be forced to take vaccines
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:42.280]  and and engaging in propaganda and saying vaccines are totally safe and
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:46.520]  effective I called her a media whore pimping out her audience well notice
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:52.600]  MSNBC CNBC media matters raw story they all ran similar headlines because they
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.920]  all take their talking points from media matters they write the first article the
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:59.880]  White House runs it then they copy it so a direct White House talking points
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:04.760]  speaking about talking points Alex Jones defense listener Rand Paul on vaccines
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:10.680]  by attacking whore they have that in quotes trash tramp filth scum now you
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:14.040]  actually read the transcript they admit yeah I called her a media whore and using
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:18.560]  your term a prostitute even gave you credit for that but but then oh Gerald
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:22.440]  Flinke is calling her a street walker I am no or not a street walker has a lot
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:26.100]  more credibility than these ghoulish vampires getting all these pharmaceutical
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:30.400]  dollars and selling wars and the rest of it and then there's such media whores
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:35.320]  they imply that I physically called her a street walker when I ever did that this
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.960]  is why they have no viewers Gerald they're a pack of lying scum sorry go
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:43.640]  ahead they are here's another quote by the way from another piece of lying

[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:24.880]  wide open phones in the third hour eight hundred two five nine ninety two
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:31.240]  thirty one Gerald we all know about the WMD lies the bipartisan fraud but I love
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:34.560]  how these precedents come out later like Gibbs and says yeah of course drones are
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.840]  operating they're killing people we're told to say it doesn't exist even though
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:43.880]  it's public but I think they've jumped the shark saying two plus two equals five
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:47.720]  and raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit I mean look at MSNBC
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:53.720]  inside MSNBC's impending shakeup cancellation reboots well I mean you
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:58.480]  can't resurrect a person that's this dead they represent a view that's popular
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:01.680]  with seven percent of the American people that's what Congress's approval
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:05.920]  rating is I don't see how they can resurrect themselves have the walking
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.480]  dead fact that's what the mainstream media is their prostitutes their dinosaur
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:14.120]  media my term but I really think they're the walking dead media I mean do they
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:20.200]  understand how hated they are and the fact that almost no one even watches them
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:26.280]  anymore Gerald the prostitutes the the prostitutes care no as long as they get
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:31.000]  paid and here's the deal Alex this is a much bigger story again that's why I
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:38.240]  wanted to talk about it they lied us into war the facts are there from Cheney
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:45.040]  beginning the lies Bush keeping me going condo release the rice and colon the
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.720]  perfect word for what condom and colon yeah that'll be a law firm yeah they
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:57.160]  they the they lied us into war and these people facilitated it this is a big
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:03.120]  story they have slaughtered how many what is the estimate a million people
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:09.200]  1.3 million lands at medical journal as of 2008 God knows what is now and what
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:15.240]  are we now we're seeing our troops 22 of them committing suicide a day oh they
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:21.000]  got him on secret death list they wanted to get him healthcare 22 a day so what
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:28.640]  I'm saying is the importance of this is that little lowlife boys and girls like
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:34.000]  Katie Cork and Brian Williams Janet Yellen Charlie Gibson oh by the way
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.960]  fair fairness and accuracy in reporting they had done a they had done a study of
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:46.120]  the lead up to the Iraq war they only brought in 1% of the people to talk
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:52.560]  against the war the rest were all in favor or and only 6% Donna Hugh had the
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.960]  top ratings 5 million viewers and I don't MSNBC and they fired him because he was
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:01.120]  a real liberal he was actually against the war and torture so they fired their
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:06.360]  only star and they and they they fired Ventura because he was against it too so
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:13.360]  the importance of this is how easily propaganda cells and what I keep telling
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:18.520]  people you know mr. Solenti what are some good business opportunities for me
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:24.840]  and I say look the big one is propaganda you can do it cheaply stupidly and you
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:31.040]  can get great results so I'm mentioning this because of the Iraq war that's
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:36.240]  costing us according to what Stiglitz about three trillion dollars and based
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:43.120]  on lies but here's the important element just as these little lowlife people
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:52.000]  sold us the Iraq war get ready for them to sell us the next one and the power of
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:58.240]  the mainstream media should not be really downplayed even though a lot of
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:03.320]  people don't follow him anymore the people pick up the sound bites from
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:07.040]  I totally agree even though their channels themselves have almost no
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:11.760]  viewers they put out the talking point on MSNBC CNN then it's picked up by the
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:16.840]  comedy shows the TV shows the media and is regurgitated locally so they still
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:25.400]  have great power exactly and what I'm saying is just as they sold us the Iraq
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:33.320]  war just as they keep selling the Iraq and Afghan war get ready for the same
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:44.200]  little people of no morality no dignity and no self-respect to bow down suck up
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:51.480]  and start selling us the next war the proof is here the proof is in the live
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:56.080]  state you know that's true they help put ISIS and Al Qaeda in now we've got to go
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:59.560]  fight them our troops have got to go die fighting them it'll be a real war but
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:03.360]  but a staged event helping them get into power and then these people sit back
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:08.200]  not facing any of the gunfire but then claiming they were under gunfire because
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:14.320]  Brian Williams wants to be a hero on top of it he is such a fraud total a total
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:19.440]  like the rest of them whose names I mentioned and whose quotes I read I'm
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:25.240]  not casting judgment from them I am analyzing their words and giving a
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:31.680]  description for who they are from what they said they are media horse
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:35.840]  rest of them they are horrors of the system I mean it's just a fact and they
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:38.320]  should be proud of that I mean they should put a red light out I guess they
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:41.700]  kind of have Gerald let's come back get into some of the top trends and then
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:46.120]  phone calls but we have this special report first that's very powerful on

[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:46.720]  job eggs here with info wars dot com now back in 2011 we wrote an article here
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:50.880]  at info wars talking about the progressive auto insurance dongle the
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:55.040]  snapshot now what that is is a device you plug in your car that allows
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:58.320]  progressive to see whether or not you are a safe driver and monitors your
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:02.560]  speed your braking habits all that good stuff and sends the information back to
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:07.120]  them and let them know if they should lower your insurance or not well here
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:14.040]  we are 2015 and we now know based off of Forbes and the hacker news that this is
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:18.120]  a device that can be easily hacked into they can stop your brakes accelerate
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:22.320]  your car and do pretty much whatever now we all know the incident that happened
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:26.960]  with my friend Michael Hastings where his car just shot down the road exploded
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:32.600]  hit a tree this is something that we live in now a digital age we are now at
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:37.600]  a point where almost every car is able to be hacked into because we have these
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:42.960]  computer systems inside it now they're trying to get you to plug a device into
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:47.920]  your car that will actually allow hackers to get into it so just a few days
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:52.200]  after Michael Hastings died I received in the mail from Progressive Auto
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:55.360]  Insurance because that's who I had at the time was this box that said the
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:35:00.720]  snapshot opened it up and says plug it in your car and get your insurance rate
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:04.440]  lowered well I threw that away because I was disgusted by the fact of what just
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:08.880]  happened to my friend I didn't trust anything being put into my car but
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.880]  wonder what would happen if I hadn't thrown that away and I actually plug
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:19.240]  that device into my car hey what's going on well you look like you're here to
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:23.240]  save some money on your car insurance yeah I'm just I don't know what I should
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:26.320]  get I was checking the snapshot thing out what do you mean what do you know
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:31.200]  about it well basically you just need to agree to let us track all of your
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:35.240]  movements this will just easily plug into your car we'll track your movements
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:40.400]  uploaded online probably the cloud will be really helpful so we can just kind of
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:45.920]  see if you're a safe driver well I saw in a Forbes article that these things
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:51.080]  could be happening do you know anything about that Forbes I don't I don't think
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:56.320]  so is it safe very safe and effective well I guess I'll go with this it seems
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:18.680]  like a good thing to try you're making the right decision and sure enough he
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:23.440]  had a big story on CIA corruption coming out he had he was in contact with
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:26.760]  WikiLeaks was about to do a big data dump and the official WikiLeaks has come
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:31.680]  out and said they talked to him one hour before his car blew up and he said the
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:37.280]  FBI's after me they're investigating me we've got to hurry up and get this done
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:42.840]  well they got you done and the police instantly said no foul play which is
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:47.200]  always suspicious the engine got blown down the road witnesses said the car
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:57.200]  caught on fire and blew up driving down the street yes I have the target now no
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:04.480]  it isn't the ringleader it's code name little bakes yes target is in a vehicle
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:13.240]  do I have to go ahead to terminate Roger standing by for clearance Roger that
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:18.040]  termination is a go cutting brakes
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:24.240]  disabling airbags accelerating car to a high speed
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:44.480]  the target is no longer a threat one down five to go
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:59.280]  that report is up on info wars.com it's very powerful it deserves to get
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:04.800]  millions of views it needs to car hacking someone dies at the end is the
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:09.640]  name of the video we're gonna retweet it Facebook it please put on your Twitter
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:14.040]  your Facebook because all of the appliances in your house everything the
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:18.040]  government admits is to be controlled and surveil you Samsung has come out and
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:21.120]  said their televisions are watching and listening to you so quote watch what
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:25.600]  you have to say Gerald Salante I want to get into trends here with you and of
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:29.120]  course trends research calm and I want to break that down and then take some
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:33.560]  calls but hearing that report folks can go to the site and see it it's more
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:37.680]  powerful if you see it this is really what's going on and we believe we went
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:42.920]  to California to investigate that Hastings was basically hacked and driven
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:47.320]  into the tree we talked to his family and others he was running from his life
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:52.880]  from the feds and a Homeland Security counterterrorism force he was involved
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:57.400]  in secret operations he was probably CIA we talked to his wife who thought he'd
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:00.800]  been probably killed Joe Biggs newer went to the funeral he was good friends
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:05.840]  with Hastings and then she changed your whole story but regardless the
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:10.560]  technology itself to surveil and taxes by the mile and now it's all being
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:14.720]  announced are we stupid enough to let this happen Gerald Salante well we're
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:19.360]  not but most people are and it just goes back to what you were talking about
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:24.640]  with the vaccinations I was that woman on on Fox say something to the effect
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:29.800]  that you know this is a time when you should listen to big brother so fear and
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:35.600]  hysteria are very easy sales to make and it goes back to the Brian Williams it
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:39.720]  goes back to propaganda so there are people like us and that's why they
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:44.560]  attack people like you and me because we don't take their baloney or buy
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:49.840]  their BS and we can't be paid off we say what we believe in what we think is
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:55.600]  factual rather than sucking up and selling their lives so I think the
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:00.640]  majority of Americans will gladly buy it because quote they're going to protect
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:05.000]  us and make us safe just like with this vaccination thing by the way here's a
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.040]  story that no one's talking about in the news I started going back and looking
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:15.920]  up some all research I remember when they were selling estrogen for women
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:20.960]  hormone replacements you're getting into menopause we've got a solution for
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:28.200]  you and they kept selling this it nonstop and anyone that came out against it
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:32.560]  they were branded just like they're branding people now that don't want to
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:38.760]  inoculate a tiny little baby that comes out of the mother's womb if the being
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:44.880]  in there for nine months and then shooting it up with his whole array of
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:50.880]  unknown toxins and saying it's okay now where's the common sense I mean any
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:55.920]  idiot knows that's not smart they did the same thing with estrogen then when
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:02.240]  they found out that it did everything to kill women that they said they were
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:09.640]  going to save them with they hardly talked about it they I wrote about this
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:15.320]  in detail in 2002 I remember when it all came out that estrogen had given
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:22.400]  millions of women cancer yes but you were and remember how those same little
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:31.960]  low-life people on NBC CBS ABC the culture news network CNN went after
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:37.400]  everyone that said that these were dangerous to women's health and then
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:43.400]  when they were proven to be dangerous not a peep from the prostitutes so again
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:49.560]  the biggest story is going back to the hacking is it's a takeover it's the top
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:55.120]  story in the trends journal the grand manipulation by the way that's written
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:59.840]  by dr. Paul Craig Roberts of course you know on your show former assistant
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:05.240]  treasury secretary Dorado Reagan this is a complete takeover the government has
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:10.560]  been taken over the multinationals are in charge this is a conspiracy theory oh
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:15.280]  how about that trans-pacific partnership that nobody's talking about huh it's not
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:19.560]  a nice one well that's what frustrating is that it's all out in the open they
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:26.920]  don't even hide it anymore because people smart phones how about dumb phones how
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:31.360]  about all this technology has made people even less connected because their
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.560]  minds are going into so many different directions that they're not paying
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:40.960]  attention to the facts there it's easy to manipulate the masses now more than
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:47.600]  ever by the way the French have just proven there is stupid as Americans and
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:52.960]  I could give you the proof go back to before 9 11 George Bush just gets
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:57.440]  elected he's only in office what about eight months his popularity is going
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:05.720]  below 50% after just getting elected 9 11 happens man the imbecile in chief
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:12.040]  became a brilliant guy go look what happened over there in France Hollands
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:20.960]  popularity rating was 12% now with that attack over there it's pushing up over
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:28.040]  50% people buy propaganda really quickly and now that they're in control of all
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:34.360]  these different elements that wire us together their power is even greater and
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:40.600]  that's why they try to media matters media matters for this they're a wasted
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:47.560]  organization all they do is pump the Democratic BS baloney and attack anyone
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:53.320]  that attacks their little boys and girls Gerald I want to race sir because I
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:56.440]  promised to go to collars they want to talk to you they got questions but race
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:00.040]  through some of the trends that are developing because you've pretty
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:03.520]  accurately guess what was coming up last year to this year what else are you
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:07.520]  watching right now all right on the economic front look at the volatility in
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:13.240]  the markets yesterday crude was down and and and West Texas you know five and a
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:18.520]  half six percent the day before was up now it's back up again five and a half
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:23.400]  six percent look at the markets the market will be up 250 points all of a
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:30.480]  sudden 20 minutes before closing it's down day after day the volatility in the
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:35.040]  markets the equity markets worldwide since the beginning of this year is like
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:39.920]  nothing I have ever seen before it's out of control doesn't speak to a wrecking
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:44.920]  it hurts the average investor that helps the insiders it's all rigged again the
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:49.840]  grand manipulation and one of the other stories in the transjournal is bankism
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:54.440]  that's written by no me prince of course you wrote the book all the president's
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:59.360]  bank gold Goldman Sachs former managing director right now what do we have here
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:05.360]  this is not capitalism everybody grow up about it it's fascism there is no
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:11.680]  such thing in capitalism as too big to fail bankism is the merger of state
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:16.160]  and corporate powers and it's going on everywhere you talked about the average
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:20.720]  investor here's how they're shifting all of us they're doing it in Europe they're
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:24.320]  doing it in China they're doing in Japan they're doing in the US they're doing it
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:29.240]  everywhere with record low interest rates they have not raised interest rates in
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:34.640]  the United States since 2006 what does that mean it means they used to have a
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:39.080]  thing when we were young people that you put money in a bank and they had a thing
[01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:43.800]  called savings account you get more money than you every return about making
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.480]  you pay to keep money in a bank that's right they have negative interest rates
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:53.600]  now in Europe 0.25 percent to keep your money there so now what this has done is
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:58.880]  all this cheap money is going to the bank so they could loan it to us back at
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:04.880]  any rate that they could get as they're borrowing it at 0.25 percent so they
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:09.920]  have these these payday loans 800% credit card loans what 30% getting
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:16.440]  literally for free exactly now you look at the growth in the stock market half
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:20.320]  the growth in the stock market has come from companies buying back their stock
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:25.760]  because they are members of the too big to fail club the bank is a club in the
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:30.200]  grand manipulation club they're the Davos boys and girls and here's what they
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:34.600]  do they borrow the money for almost nothing they buy back their stock they
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:38.920]  raise it up and then they make all this dough because they're on the inside the
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:43.880]  other money from the cheap rates has come from mergers and acquisitions because
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:47.720]  they too could borrow the money for almost nothing merger and acquisition
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:54.640]  activity in 2014 was back to 2007 levels now let's put it into perspective for
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:47:00.240]  all of us even these cheap interest rates have not been enough to boost the
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:08.600]  housing market the only growth is coming from the top 40% of first-time home
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:15.080]  buyers used to be people between 25 to 35 now they can't afford to buy homes
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:23.280]  anymore that numbers down to 24 26% so the only deal this is doing whether it
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:29.120]  was the new deal they just did over there in Europe with Mario Draghi the guy
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:33.560]  that was the former head of the Goldman Sachs gang the European division that's
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:39.040]  not ahead of the president of the European Central Bank all of this
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:45.120]  quantitative easing is only enriching the rich I'm not making this up here's the
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:52.960]  number you know it Oxfam came out with it by next year 1% of the people will
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:59.240]  have more Joe than 99% of the rest of us and that is a tiny percent of the 1%
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:03.160]  that they're then gonna scapegoat new vorice and upper-middle class and
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:09.960]  they're financing class warfare Davos is to sick the giant poor mass on any
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:13.720]  wealth that's there that isn't part of the inside club and then they've got
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:17.160]  pressure from above and below they take over the whole system we'll get to more
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:21.160]  trends with Gerald Salente here in a moment but let's get to some calls for
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:25.200]  Gerald Salente Marty in Texas you're a first-time caller on the air with Gerald
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:34.760]  Salente hello yes or go ahead okay I have a couple of quick coaching points not

[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:49.720]  vaccination push that's that's going on now I have an idea for actually being
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:55.200]  able to do something about it and it's it's an a hash jacking campaign every
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:59.920]  every post every tweet everything that goes out there should contain the
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:11.160]  hashtag my body my choice that way if it co-ops that that popular meme absolutely
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:14.320]  we should be hijacking this little isn't I'm not trying to be mean but we got
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:17.920]  Gerald for a limited time I'm gonna put you on hold come back to you these are

[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:32.840]  with the listeners we're talking to Gerald Salente right now we got a loaded
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:37.680]  phone bank folks want to talk to him so Mike in California listening on the
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:42.520]  great Michael's whirling station I go ahead good morning welcome. Glad Gerald's
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:47.840]  on always glad to hear Gerald hey have a question for you on real estate and 2008
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:53.000]  we invested in tangible assets of a significant amount to shelter our
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:55:00.400]  savings from the devaluation cycle my wife's been looking at real estate and
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:06.360]  I've just want Gerald to comment on what he thinks about real estate as an
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:10.760]  investment for those who have a limited amount of resources shielded in
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:16.080]  tangible assets. Well you know I don't give finance advice I'm not permitted to
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:21.280]  as a trend forecast or not a financial advisor only speaking for myself if you
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:24.800]  have a piece of real estate you think you could it's going to be profitable and
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:30.520]  you and you're smart enough to understand the negatives and positives about it to
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:35.000]  me it's a good investment you know again but not to do it on a speculative
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.960]  level. Like you said you doubled down on America and bought a bunch of real estate
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:45.960]  as well you're not backing down. No I bought a 1750s building a 1763 and a
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:51.520]  1774 you know so I bought it it's at a passion and out of an understanding that
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:57.160]  these things. It's a love of art and culture you literally bought into 1776. Yes
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:02.600]  and and I did because I'm an American and my you know as I say my blood is
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:06.640]  Italian but my heart's American and these people that say love it or leave it I
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:10.480]  say no you leave it I bought these buildings because I want to restore
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:16.360]  America back to the core principles of our founding fathers so that's why I
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:22.840]  invest in this but for the crawler if you think it's a good investment the
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:27.720]  real estate goes like this but it always keeps going higher so if it's
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:33.080]  something that you're doing and out of wisdom of what the potential is I would
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:38.000]  suggest you consider it seriously. You make a good buy it's in the right area and you
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.160]  understand you're a long-term deal and if it's a piece of property you can make
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:44.720]  some money on with the business while it's there I think that's the best type
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:48.920]  of investment. Exactly that's what I'm saying not for speculation but for growth.
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:54.000]  Yeah well I guess the consideration is you know what to know what is a bubble
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.280]  market I mean I you know some of these price investigations. You know you can't
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:02.800]  tell because we are I talked before about the volatility in the markets I
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:07.480]  also talked about how these low interest rates are not driving demand
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:12.040]  so you have to make your own choice because I I believe we're gonna see a
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:17.240]  crash. I agree that the Austin bubble is already popping the biggest in the
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:20.800]  country. Erin in California thanks Mike Erin in California go ahead you're on
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:28.920]  the air. Yes thank you very much. Mr. Salente you for years were the top
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:42.000]  trans forecast forecaster but you made some predictions for 2014 you said that Gold 2000 and financial collapse by March 2014 that did not happen you were
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  de-throwned as top trans forecast that's the fact it's all in there. Well let me get into
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.640]  respond those are some huge claims I believe we're already in an artificial
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:56.640]  yeah let me go on it's easy to spot I I never said gold would go to 2000 I said
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:01.680]  I believe gold should be over 2000 I never said it would go there on the
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:08.040]  crash I believe that the Federal Reserve was going to raise interest rates by
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:15.520]  March I was wrong I never dreamt that they would keep interest rates at again
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:20.080]  they haven't raised them since 2006 yeah this is unprecedented. It's like somebody
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:22.880]  dying and they keep giving them adrenaline until their parents get there I've
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:25.520]  actually gone and seen my friend I mean they were waiting on his dad to get
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:28.400]  there they were giving him adrenaline he got to see his parents everybody and
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:32.440]  then he passed out and died I mean that's America there's pumping adrenaline in
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:37.400]  to keep us alive but you know it's gonna crash all the experts are saying that
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:40.840]  we'll be right back Gerald's been proven accurate I want to be able to elaborate
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:46.640]  on that I mean look at what Trump say it's the fundamentals show a crash okay
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:51.680]  when it comes we don't know. Year after year we watched the threats steadily
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:56.600]  increase and now this winner has been the worst on record when it comes to our

[02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:16.360]  does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio

[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:24.640]  vaccines Joe I want to get to Aaron and Kyle and Rob and Adam and Joe and
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:28.040]  everybody else I know Gerald's a big boy he can defend himself he has made a lot
[02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:32.000]  of accurate predictions since 1980 written best-selling books but most
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.680]  experts I mean we've been saying it's untenable the Fed had said they were
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:42.880]  gonna stop doing QE3 a lot of people I talked to he said they have to in fact
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:47.120]  you know Kaiser predicted that the bond market would go crazy it kind of did but
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:50.400]  the point is things have gotten so artificial with the rigging it's just
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:55.720]  going and going but governments are digging in the Pentagon says they believe
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:01:00.240]  a big crash is coming I mean Gerald's pretty mainstream now when it comes to
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:04.520]  actual financial analysts saying that I mean some type of big collapse is coming
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:08.800]  look at the collapse in Europe look at collapses in other areas but I want Aaron
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:13.240]  to be able to come back at Gerald I mean look I don't care if you call in Aaron
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:16.440]  and disagree with Gerald and say you're wrong I could just hear your voice you
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:20.720]  really enjoy saying you have been dethroned and all this look I hope
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:24.280]  Gerald's wrong I hope I'm wrong I hope all these other financial analysts are
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:28.720]  wrong you know I hope but but that's not what the elites are doing they're all
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:32.680]  buying emergency getaways around the world that was the London Guardian so I
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:36.120]  talked to billionaires and insiders and they were they are scared you know what
[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:42.120]  so what do you say to that Aaron okay you got me on my back for you ask me a
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:47.440]  question here's the thing Gerald flinted did not come up or calling the term
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:52.800]  bankism that's another thing and I come back up the first two allegations you
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:56.480]  got an audio problem hold on and now you're going to say you didn't find the
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:00.480]  term bankism he founded Prestitutes but it's a much a territorial nitpicking
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:04.520]  Gerald you want to respond to this guy yeah well but first I know this guy is
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:08.840]  he keeps sending me very nasty emails all the time let him go then yeah the
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:14.660]  the here's the deal I never said gold was going to go to 2000 I had pre I had
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:18.440]  you said it should be on this show but they've rigged the market right I never
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:24.040]  said it would hit it I said it should be added and over I've said this over and
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:30.560]  over again I never gave it date number two on the rates the Federal Reserve
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:37.120]  should be raising rates everybody knows it and when they try to do it you can
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:43.800]  see panic in the marketplace I had believed last year that by March or
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:49.000]  year and a half ago they would have to raise rates they didn't they kept them
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:56.640]  low when rates go up the economy goes down here's a fact go around the world
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:05.760]  every government virtually now is dropping rates to all-time lows Australia
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:11.000]  go throughout Europe just joined the QE which says inflation but then they're
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.640]  also deflating with the Saudis is there a strategy there to try to balance that
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:18.960]  what this is by the way that's I'm glad you brought up this deflation thing
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:24.320]  here's the big lie that they're telling people they have to do deal with
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:30.080]  deflation and bring it up to inflation here's what they're selling the public
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:35.480]  matter of fact Brian Williams could pull this one off here's what they say
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:41.040]  deflation is dangerous because if people know that prices are going to go down
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:47.560]  that means they're going to wait to buy things knowing that the prices are going
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:54.280]  to go down that's a lot of baloney the deflation is a depression prices are
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:04:00.520]  going down because there's too much supply and not enough demand sure it's
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:09.400]  not only oil prices that are down copper prices iron ore nickel one commodity
[02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:16.240]  after another is down to five and a half and six year lows because demand is off
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:22.440]  go and look what happened and the hype that no one's talking about now look at
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:27.600]  the numbers that came out from December retail sales oh they were down they
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:33.320]  were supposed to go up why were they down remember the big sales before
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:41.880]  Christmas 50 to 70% off look who just declared bankruptcy cashier yesterday
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:45.720]  how many other JC pennies closing a bunch of stores stay there yeah and we're
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:49.960]  not happy that things are bad but every real fundamental 100 million out of the
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:53.800]  workforce 50 million on food scams I mean this guy saying you're wrong saying
[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:57.280]  we're in financial trouble we are collapsing but they give us a sugar

[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:48.200]  you need to see in the sea they say private mega central banks control the
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:52.400]  world with free money that they issued to themselves world governments being
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:55.620]  established they want a hundred trillion dollars every decade paid through
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:09:00.320]  basically the Davos group to George Soros and the Goldman Sachs gang and the
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:07.720]  rest of crew we know I mean just it's just all over the place now Gerald was
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:11.160]  saying it five years ago ten years ago I was saying it you could see where
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:16.480]  trillions in debt was going thousands of trillions and derivatives all this
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:19.760]  garbage you know there's going to be some type of collapse governments are
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:24.400]  digging in Gerald had said last year or about a two years ago that he believed
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:29.280]  2014 could be the time for this that QE had to end it's still going now there's
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:34.360]  a world race so will it be inflation or deflationary the Saudis aren't just
[02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:38.200]  trying to bankrupt us shale producers are the Russians I believe they're
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:45.520]  they're introducing depressionary prices to actually attempt to pull down the
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:51.960]  inflationary spike that we see in this Weimar money printing but regardless it's
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:56.400]  a juggling act as the real economy dies as savings go down as joblessness
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:00.720]  increases as wages go down as 40 something million people went from full
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:05.760]  time to part time under Obamacare as that kicks in and as Obama's energy
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:11.360]  policies kick in I don't see how the economy won't implode and now most
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:14.920]  analysts are just saying it's any minute but who knows in this Alice in
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:18.840]  Wonderland thing Gerald when do you I mean how long can this go I mean we've
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:21.960]  got all these big top guys saying it's gonna you know get out of the market
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:26.880]  dooms about to happen what do you think again the volatility is telling the
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:32.840]  story and by the way these low oil prices if you go back to 1986 that's one
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:36.520]  of the ways I made my name as a trend forecaster I was in the Wall Street
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:41.800]  Journal I had predicted that the crash of 87 in the beginning of the year in
[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:45.880]  January I said the market was gonna crash and one of the fundamentals were
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:51.720]  crashing oil prices yes the Saudis want to get rid of competition but again as
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:57.040]  I mentioned before you look at the commodity prices around the world you
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:04.480]  can buy a ton of reinforcement rod rebar in China cheaper than you can a ton of
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:10.160]  cabbage there's so much product on the market you go to any store now and you're
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:17.480]  seeing slash prices of you name the product now on the cut on the inflation
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:23.680]  yes it's a Weimar type of inflation it's not as though in supply and demand
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:28.200]  where there's so much demand that the price of the product is going up what
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:33.280]  they're doing around the world is devaluing their currencies so it's
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:38.880]  going to cause people more to buy things for example you look what's going on in
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:43.720]  Europe now that Draghi announced and they knew that they were going to announce
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:52.200]  hit their version of QE what has happened to the the euro oh it's at 11
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:57.960]  year lows no no kidding so now it's costing all the people more money to buy
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:02.520]  things but the good 40% of young people are unemployed in places like Spain
[02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:07.480]  we're in a global depression they're just papering it over because production's
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:11.920]  been so high traditionally we've got a lot of bobbles and still have food but
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:16.800]  even that is starting to work thin it papering it over with the word deflation
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:22.720]  it's depression it's not deflation and that's the big oil prices went down
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:26.400]  during the Great Depression that's what happens exactly all the prices are
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:31.960]  going down but people are making less and their currencies are being devalued
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:39.280]  just like Franklin Roosevelt devalued our currency when they took us off the
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:45.600]  gold reserve and remember the dollar was pegged to gold what was it at 20 $20
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:50.200]  and something cents an ounce and then gold went up after that they called in
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:57.040]  all the gold and then they repaid the price of gold to $35 which means you
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:03.040]  just lost 70 percent of your purchasing power it's called a depression you go
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:06.920]  around the world I was mentioning at the record low interest rates you're
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:12.760]  seeing it's costing everybody more to buy things but what they're doing is
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:19.800]  they're juicing the equity markets in anticipation of droggies QE now you're
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:25.520]  looking at the European markets at seven year highs as an example they had
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:29.280]  get Gibbs when he was press secretary said there is no drone program when it
[02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:33.600]  was a public program it's the same thing there is no depression forming when
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:39.920]  there is one I mean it's this game of I'll never forget they had there were
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:44.360]  that blonde was Perino or whatever her name is as the press secretary and they
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:48.600]  were asking her under Bush you know our oil prices up because the dollars been
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:52.080]  devalued and she said I can't you know answer that they said well well we need
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:55.960]  you to tell us if there's dollar devaluation as if tell us if the sun
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:14:00.200]  came out this morning it's just total mind control I want to go to some more
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:03.880]  calls here I mean I wish Gerald was wrong I wish I was wrong I wish we
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:07.720]  weren't going into a depression but all the indicators are there I don't know
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:12.760]  exactly how it's going to go down but it's going down let's talk to Kyle in
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:15.960]  PA thanks for holding her on the air with Gerald
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:21.200]  hey guys well historically speaking the collapse always happens in the last year
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:27.200]  of a sitting presidential term and so if we're speaking the collapse is always
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:34.040]  dramatically larger than the one previously to it my question for Gerald
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:40.400]  is what does American life look like in a collapse of the size that will look
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:44.720]  that's a great question that's a great question you know I have a saying when
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:49.440]  people lose everything and have nothing left to lose they lose it and they're
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:54.840]  losing it around the world but we don't have to have it happen like that you
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.840]  know the elections are coming up and no one's really excited that I know of who
[02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:04.160]  the potential candidates are choosing from the bloods of the Crips or as
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:07.960]  people prefer to call them the Republicans and Democrats to me their
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:12.600]  murders and thieves their records prove it again look what's going on around the
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:19.080]  world out of nowhere out of nowhere in less than a year the Podemos party they
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:23.320]  just had a rally over 300 people thousand three hundred thousand people
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:28.680]  turned out in Spain in Greece the Shiriza party in Italy between the five-star
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:33.480]  movement in the Northern League in the UK with UKIP you're seeing it like him or
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:37.480]  not dislike him I'm not getting into that what I'm saying is whether it's
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:42.720]  Le Pen in France you name the country yeah it's right wing it's liberal it's
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:47.160]  socialist everywhere people are electing quote radical anti-globalist
[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:53.360]  anti-New World Order anti-EU parties so what I'm saying is to prevent what we
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:58.400]  can see coming and to see chaos in the streets because hey they just did it in
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:03.280]  New York you know they got terror response groups we've seen the
[02:16:03.280 --> 02:16:07.280]  militarization of the police notice the terror response groups are for
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:12.800]  protesters now yeah they said it exactly so what I'm saying is they're putting
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:17.440]  these things into place because they know that people have nothing to lose and
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:22.040]  they're going to lose it what we're suggesting is let's take a different
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:27.360]  tact now to me is the time for a new third party by the way that's the other
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:31.080]  way I made my name in my book trend tracking that I wrote in your prediction
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:37.760]  roster of exactly now the conditions exist better than any time for a new
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:40.880]  third party I agree that's why they don't like Rand Paul and people that kind of
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:46.280]  represent a third party movement within the system I think he is being too
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:49.320]  political and acting like he's establishment they're never going to
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:53.840]  let him in acting like that because they know he's a good guy I want to go to
[02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:58.040]  some more phone calls here thank you call great question great caller Adam in
[02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:03.360]  Canada you're on the air go ahead hi hi Gerald first off I just want to say
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:06.360]  God bless you guys as well as all your listeners and everyone throughout the
[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:10.480]  world I know this is an important cause and highly relevant but then a listener
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:14.880]  for a couple years waking up quick question for you your crew and Gerald
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:20.440]  is take is I've seen a recent article circulating alternative news media on a
[02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:25.160]  class action lawsuit against the Bank of Canada from Canadians for if that's a
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:29.000]  legit and be a fast part of the solution we're looking for yeah not aware of
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:33.600]  what you're getting at but I mean yeah I am I am there there is a lawsuit and it
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:39.240]  does appear legit and it can really make a difference yeah because lawsuits get
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:43.360]  discovery and then that's how so many of these documents come out as you know
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:48.080]  Gerald recently it's just coming out that basically everything's rigged yeah
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:53.320]  but that that lawsuit is gaining gaining popularity and it's something worth
[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:58.320]  looking into I'll look at it can be the beginning of a change and again you know
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:03.360]  going back to the whole question of what's going on that people have to
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:09.560]  understand that it's not it is the it is bank ism it is the grand manipulation
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:15.880]  separatism it's total multinational takeover and between the the Europeans
[02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:20.880]  again going back to Europe they are fighting their deal with the transit
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:25.480]  lint lantic investment partnership or they're calling it it's not going to
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:30.240]  happen coming out of Europe it's hardly being reported here and I just want to
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:36.240]  take this this second or this minute to thank you Alex for what you're doing to
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:41.480]  wake people up the crew that you have the information that you're putting out
[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:46.240]  and that everybody out there listening to support the people that are

[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:57.560]  that are natural that are for the benefit of everyone that buys them and it's the
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:00.840]  same thing what we're putting out with the trends journal thank you Gerald yep

[02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:12.800]  the magazine because even if people think they know all this it's great to

[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:37.240]  York go ahead Joe. Hello Alex and Gerald great to be able to talk to you and my
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:43.080]  quick question is any ideas on protecting IRAs or 401ks from government
[02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:48.080]  confiscation or how do you feel about gold and silver? Great question Obama did
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:51.040]  just announce in the State of the Union they want to start grabbing your
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:56.000]  education funds and taxing them it is beginning Gerald? Yes you're right and
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:01.040]  gold and silver I'm bullish on both particularly gold and again I buy gold
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:04.800]  from the golden years some at some point this thing is going to collapse
[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:09.480]  you're seeing a devaluation of currencies around the world so gold for
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:12.720]  long-term for me and of course the government will steal anything that to
[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:16.800]  get their hands on and if there's a real market panic what's gonna happen with
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:21.680]  your IRA what is it invested in and where is it going to go? Thank you Joe let's
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:27.200]  start to Robin New York here on the air go ahead Rob. Hey guys how you doing? Good
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:36.360]  brother. Alright Gerald so the economy it's not that great you know if we raise
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:40.720]  raise interest rates you know what is that gonna look like for the average
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:46.520]  person and is that something just to help us push the dollar towards parity
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:51.920]  with the euro? What's going to happen the reason why I had believed that there
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:56.960]  would be a crash is because when they raise interest rates this Ponzi scheme of
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:01.520]  banks barring at virtually nothing and then loaning it back to us and anything
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:06.120]  they can get that starts ending and this equity market start going down I
[02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:11.680]  mentioned what happened to the US market from 8,018 the seven-year highs in
[02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:17.800]  Europe the market's gone up 57% in Japan from lowering rates so when the
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:21.920]  rates go up this whole thing collapses and it hurts everybody. But if they keep
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:26.520]  pumping it then it will have its own set of problems I mean it's just we're
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:31.240]  exactly exactly they're devaluing our currencies and that's why I'm bullish on
[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:35.440]  gold. Absolutely I mean long-term it just spells massive inflation but then
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:38.680]  they're engaged in a depression I hope that answers your question Rob good
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:45.000]  question Leland in Illinois you're on the air with Gerald Selenton. I want to
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:49.920]  say that the derivatives market the big the big just too big to fail banks hold
[02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:56.200]  over 200 trillion in derivatives right now they just tied that to the FDIC credit
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:27:03.680]  2,000 trillion yes so shouldn't anyone with a 401 or ACI anything shouldn't they
[02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:12.400]  take that now and convert that to gold I mean yeah I can't tell people what to
[02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:15.680]  do with this I'm not a financial advisor you've got to do what you think
[02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:22.640]  especially for myself and this is a fact speaking for myself let me finish
[02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:30.160]  all of my IRA and I have to put it into I have to put it into it because I need
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:36.240]  to tax deductions is in it in gold ETFs would I rather have it in physical of
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:40.320]  course I would. All right Leland in Illinois you're shopping at the bet go
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:45.080]  ahead what else you want to say? Yes I'll just with Russia I mean you know the
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:49.200]  Bible says that the world will have a one-world money a one-world economy and
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:53.040]  a one-world religion now in order to get that one-world money which they have
[02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:57.200]  already IMF has it. They got to destroy all the other world currencies. They got to
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:00.840]  destroy the other currencies that's why they doing what they doing that's why
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:05.120]  the devaluation is going on. The Bible what the Bible said it is happening
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:09.560]  exactly like it said it just didn't give us the details of that Obama would do
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:12.840]  this and it would cause this and that George Bush would do this and it would
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:17.440]  cause this. Well there's no doubt it's serious. Let me answer that. You look at
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:22.880]  you mentioned Russia. Russia's been buying gold like there's no tomorrow. Show of
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:25.600]  the elites the billionaires have been buying it while saying we're idiots to
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:30.040]  get it. I want to make a comment too about you know your advertisers and what
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:34.240]  I said so everybody knows that I'm not blowing smoke. I don't know if you know
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:39.200]  this I have an honorary doctorate in integrative and complementary medicine

[02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:16.880]  guns will be caked and no one will be able to be armed. We can take all guns. For many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in America.
[02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:22.360]  The city's global governance at last is at one world the central bank is in charge but
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:31.360]  are we all just living and dying from what the central banks do. And for me give me liberty or give me death.
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:38.680]  Live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones. Now I meant to do a
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:42.820]  whole hour on this not just one big segment one small segment so sometime
[02:34:42.820 --> 02:34:49.920]  tomorrow or maybe even the Sunday show I'm gonna maybe do a whole show on people
[02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:54.040]  calling in with their take on vaccines. Are you for it are you against it what
[02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:56.720]  do you think of mandatory vaccinations we told you that turning was coming
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:00.760]  people said oh no way now it's all over the news like it is mandatory and people
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:04.720]  aren't doing it and we need to have laws so it's mandatory but you need to have
[02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:10.520]  laws passed you're a pack of liars. Now the only way to go to a lot of calls is
[02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:13.400]  to move quickly through the callers if you got a point got a question got a
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:18.720]  comment make it. Specifically though I'm not cherry-picking here saying we've
[02:35:18.720 --> 02:35:25.740]  opened our phones up for people that agree or disagree only. I'm not saying
[02:35:25.740 --> 02:35:28.440]  call them with your horror stories but that's what happened for two hours
[02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:33.000]  yesterday when we did this. Horror story after horror story. My grandmother got
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:36.960]  polio from polio vaccine they admitted it. We had like five callers say they got
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:40.200]  polio. It's in the news today that parents are getting it from their
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:43.640]  vaccinated kids. The measles are spreading it it says it on the stinking
[02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:51.440]  insert then I have to see stinking Bill O'Reilly and stinking MSNBC hosts saying
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:58.360]  we're liars and there's no side effects I mean they know that's not true. Just
[02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:01.520]  like they all lied about the WMD's and all said oh we knew it was a lie we were
[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:08.320]  told to that's even worse. I mean you knew it was a lie and you I'm so sick of
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:16.840]  these people man. So we're gonna go to that. You heard Gerald Solente talk about
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:21.440]  supporting the transmission. It is your purchase of the books, the videos, the
[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:26.320]  t-shirts, the nutraceuticals, the cooking stoves. I mean whatever's a cool
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:31.040]  gadget you know the best rated you know outdoor cooking stove portable little
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:35.160]  stove we sell those. The best crank short waves at the lowest price we sell
[02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:40.480]  those. I mean just something basically if I bought it and I like it most of
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:44.520]  stuff we carry is where I did research for my family what I want and then I
[02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:47.720]  end up reaching out becoming a distributor usually become the biggest
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:52.320]  distributor out there for these products. Pro pure you name it these are shortwave
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:59.200]  radios we carry you know boom we're the biggest distributor online because we
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:03.280]  sell them at the lowest price. We sign contracts to sell at the lowest price
[02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:06.080]  because they all make a sign those because they know we'll keep dropping
[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:10.080]  prices. We're worse than Amazon. I mean we saw a lot of stuff less than Amazon
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:17.520]  just to give you an idea. So infowarstore.com or infowarslife.com
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:23.080]  thousands of items and we've got the Molan Labe camouflage shirts made in
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:27.360]  America and they're about to sell out in extra large and large. I mean we just
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:32.280]  can't keep them in stock. We can't and the problem is I cannot get enough from
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:36.680]  the only factory in the US that makes these. So I'm gonna have to make a deal
[02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:40.680]  with them just to scale up making it like 300 of each size. I mean give me a
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:46.280]  break. This is a really popular shirt it's back in it sells out within days
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:49.680]  unless you want it for your wife or something and small. It's really good
[02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:54.720]  looking. I designed it infowarslife.com infowarsstore.com. I want to play this ad
[02:37:54.720 --> 02:37:58.400]  that we cut yesterday. I don't usually play ads during the segments but I think
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:03.280]  it says it all about super male and super female vitality. A huge sale we've got
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:07.360]  going right now. Let's play that clip and we'll go to your calls. The month of
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:12.400]  February is all about Valentine's Day. Big heart-shaped boxes filled with
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:16.760]  delicious candy. What if we the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:20.240]  made it about human liberty and individual empowerment. I'm all about
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:23.480]  human potential. I'm all about the individual being empowered. The
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:27.160]  establishment is the opposite. That's why they spike our water with fluoride and
[02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:31.000]  GMO estrogen mimickers and the rest of the garbage. Info Wars is striking back
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:35.080]  in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month. How we can come

[02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:31.120]  the bad halogens. Blocks them. It's just amazing. I mean, that's why they don't
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:34.880]  want you to get enough iodine. It's a big secret. We've got the highest quality
[02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:40.280]  oil of oregano in caplets from the Mediterranean. I wanted this because
[02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:44.680]  I'm sick of putting it in my mouth at Burns. So that's available at infowarslife.com.

[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:25.640]  aggressive. I mean, this is a professional, hardcore, no compromise
[02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:29.960]  operation that really cuts through the fog and wakes people up with pertinent
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:36.440]  info. Common sense Americana. 1776 worldwide. If you stand up and take action,
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:40.280]  which you've been doing, that's why we're at the White House surrogates attacking
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:45.320]  us daily. You've got a commitment from this operation. Like I'm a B17 bomber
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:49.680]  pilot. I will go over the heaviest enemy targets. I will fly into the flak. I
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:54.440]  will pull the lever and I will send those info weapons down on the enemy, no
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:59.760]  matter what happens to me. But I need you to fuel us on the tarmac and you've
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:03.840]  got a commitment that we're going to hammer the hell out of the enemy. No
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:09.360]  compromise with all our passion, all our creativity. We will savage them like a
[02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:14.360]  pit bull on a wild hog. We will go for the neck. We will never surrender. We
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:19.280]  shall go on to the end. Whatever the cost may be to quote Churchill, whether
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:23.120]  you like Churchill or not. It's a great speech. It's the intro to ace is high,
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:26.160]  but they never played on the radio. Maybe find on YouTube. We play it next
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:30.440]  segment. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight. We shall never surrender.
[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:34.520]  That's a good feeling to just know you're committed. You're on the right side of
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:38.920]  history. Win or lose. We're on the right side. You know, God's behind us. It's
[02:41:38.920 --> 02:41:42.560]  that simple. And how do I know God's behind us? My conscience feels clear. I
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:47.400]  feel empowered. I feel strong. I feel committed. And the minute I start
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:51.720]  thinking about not fighting 110%, I feel weak. I feel pathetic. I feel
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:58.040]  dishonored. I mean, the spirit leaves me. It's that simple, folks. And that's
[02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:00.600]  what it's all about. It's about spirit, ladies and gentlemen. This country's lost
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:05.160]  its spirit. It's lost its will. It's lost its dignity. It's lost its honor. It's
[02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:09.280]  lost its manhood. It's lost its womanhood. We have been sucked dry and put
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:15.920]  under a spell. Well, it's time to break the spell. Do it. Ask God to move on you
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:19.840]  and get that spirit of the devil off of you. When I talk about the spirit of the
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:23.880]  devil, I don't mean all these church bugs with their church keys saying, you know,
[02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:27.600]  don't drink a beer. Don't whistle it. You don't think women are beautiful. God
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:32.080]  made women. God made men. And I'm not saying anybody's perfect either, but the
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:36.160]  real sins putting veterans on secret death list and nobody doing anything. The
[02:42:36.160 --> 02:42:40.040]  real sins aborting babies. The real sins lying about WMDs and killing over a
[02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:43.160]  million people. The real sins establishing world government starting war
[02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:47.600]  with Russia. The real sin is putting GMO in the food and the cancer viruses and
[02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:52.680]  the vaccines. Now I'm going to your calls one person after another with your
[02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:57.400]  testimony about vaccines or your take on it. Let's go ahead. I'm going to go to
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:02.400]  Ron and Pennsylvania first. I'm going to Marty, Matt, Kelly and Tom. Let's go
[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:04.720]  ahead and go to Ron and PA. You're on the air.
[02:43:06.880 --> 02:43:13.040]  Hi, Alex. Thanks so much for your program. I appreciate it. I definitely am
[02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:20.760]  against vaccines and I believe in a greater power. My creator, pharmaceuticals
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:27.280]  in the revelation is called from Mark from Maka. I believe it says, uh,
[02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:33.480]  deceived the whole world or controlled the whole world. But in 66, I went into
[02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:41.280]  the U. S. Air Force as a as an orphan status. I had no parents. The Air Force
[02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:46.360]  took me later on, experimented on me for a whole bunch of vaccines and near
[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:52.360]  killed me, sent me home empty handed. And I've suffered all my life with these
[02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:56.760]  things. I really oppose what they've been doing to our veterans. It's sad when
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:01.520]  a man will give his life for our country and the country will turn around and
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:05.960]  totally destroy him. Now it's just trying to keep my story short.
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:11.160]  Tell more of your story, brother, because that's what they do. They test on
[02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:15.600]  our trips, thousands of declassified tests, many of them lethal, pregnant
[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:19.640]  wives of GIs from the 40s through the 70s were given uranium and plutonium
[02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:22.920]  pills and they were pregnant to see what it would do to the babies. I mean, we
[02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:26.760]  need to, it's not our government. It's criminals within it. We need to stop
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:31.560]  denying how evil they are. You're exactly right. It's a criminal within our
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:37.560]  government. And, uh, uh, I know when they, they, they took me and I had no idea
[02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:41.160]  what they were doing. They never told me. They just said, you're on a special
[02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:46.280]  status. And I started getting stuff that nobody else got until I could not
[02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:52.200]  walk. It cost me my aircraft, jet mechanics, career in the military. Uh,
[02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:56.800]  I was sent home sick. Uh, it's just, it's terrible.
[02:44:57.320 --> 02:45:01.000]  Well, it's really weird how they operate. Uh, you know, they love to get orphans.
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:04.840]  They love orphan black kids. That's their, that's just usually that's who they'd
[02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:08.200]  rather kill, but they'll kill white people in Hispanics and Asians all day
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:11.360]  too. I mean, they really love to kill Appalachians, but I've seen this
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:15.360]  thousands of times in news where it comes out. And in the military too, it's
[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:19.040]  like you didn't have a family. You must have a bad gene pool. We have a clip
[02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:22.480]  where they say this at the legislature. Yeah. And I've played the clip just
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:26.320]  last week. And so the, yeah, they, they segregate you. And that was in the old
[02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:29.320]  days. Oh, we're doing it to blacks. We're doing it to orphans. We're doing it
[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:32.200]  to white trash. We're doing it to you. This is what they say behind the
[02:45:32.200 --> 02:45:36.560]  scenes. But then if you were like my dad, top of his class, you know, one of
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:41.840]  the most 15 smart in Texas in these Texas Academy of Science test out of
[02:45:41.840 --> 02:45:46.160]  tens of thousands, they called him in when he was a junior in high school and
[02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:49.440]  said, we're establishing a world government. We're taking over and we
[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:54.040]  like to recruit you in and go to plan to at UT and you could join the CIA or
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:57.960]  you could join special, you know, this and that. So, so see, you're an orphan.
[02:45:57.960 --> 02:46:01.440]  So we're just going to test this stuff on you. But oh, Mr. Jones, you're real
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:05.120]  smart. Want to join us. He didn't join him. But, but this is an example of the
[02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:11.000]  real system ruling things. Go ahead. Yeah, I got vaccines for 18 months every
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:15.280]  month. I got another vaccine of some kind. I talked to one of Rick Perry's
[02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:18.440]  top staff people. He came to in game premiere and he said, Listen, the
[02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:21.840]  governor likes you. I heard he was in this film. You don't need to attack the
[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:25.760]  governor. Let me just tell you, I was in the military. I was a medic and I was
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:30.040]  at Fort Sam Houston Medical Center in San Antonio and they would bring in
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:34.280]  troops and kill them with vaccines. I mean, they would die in three days. And
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:37.800]  God bless you, sir. I mean, this is a guy I'd see on TV with Rick Perry at his
[02:46:37.800 --> 02:46:43.240]  press conferences. I mean, it's just it's so widespread. It hides in plain
[02:46:43.240 --> 02:46:49.320]  view. Go ahead, Ron. I really appreciate what you've been doing for the veteran,
[02:46:49.320 --> 02:46:54.600]  but they cleaned me out, took my medical records and stuff. And just about 10
[02:46:54.600 --> 02:46:59.600]  years ago, somebody stepped up behind the scene and made sure that I got my
[02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:03.680]  medical records that was taken from me. That's right. And that's how I know the
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:07.760]  vaccines they gave me. Well, that's why there's a lot of patriots on the inside
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:10.960]  and there's a war between good and evil. And that's why we got to support the
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:14.040]  good guys. I got to go. See, I said I'd give each color a minute that guy was on
[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:21.520]  for five minutes, but it's just too powerful. These stories too powerful. And
[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:24.560]  it's just accepted that, you know, there's one of Rick Perry's top people, one
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:28.240]  of his press people admitting he saw people murdered and it's just no big
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:34.480]  deal. We just accept anything in this country. And look, I don't sit there and
[02:47:34.480 --> 02:47:37.680]  support the veterans because I'm one of these people that claims they support
[02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:41.880]  the veterans because it gets me support. I support anybody who's being targeted
[02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:49.760]  like unborn babies. Anybody they attack who doesn't deserve it. I'm immediately
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:53.040]  support them. Man, we're all on this together. That's what people don't get
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:57.560]  out there. It's not heroic to stand up for people that are under attack. I want
[02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:03.640]  to be stood up for when I'm under attack. It's common sense. That's all it is. All
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:08.480]  these scum in the government think it's cute to sell people out. Well, I wouldn't
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:11.400]  want to get between them and God when God's hammer comes down on them. And
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:14.600]  it's gonna be when they die. That'll be the second judgment. You get judged in
[02:48:14.600 --> 02:48:17.480]  this life and I'm God fearing. These people have no idea what they're
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:23.600]  facing. Let's talk to Tom in New York. Tom, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey,
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:30.080]  what's up? Broadcast, brother. Go ahead. Yes, sir. I called up another radio show
[02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:32.600]  this morning. I don't know if I'm allowed to say the name, but whatever. Laura
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:36.160]  Ingram, I called her this morning because she had a doctor on who was telling
[02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:39.640]  the whole world that they need to go and get their kids vaccinated today. You
[02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:44.360]  got to do it. It was a giant worldwide push, not just here to try to make
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:47.520]  everybody take shots ahead of passing laws to make it mandatory. And all these
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:50.920]  pro vacciners can know this. Go to hell. And when people get hurt by your
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:53.840]  vaccines that you push, we're going to hold all these talk show hosts
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:59.480]  responsible. Sorry, go ahead. No, you're right, man, because I tried to call in
[02:48:59.480 --> 02:49:02.640]  and tell the doctor, what are you going to do when you're wrong, considering
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:05.680]  what you're, you know, you're just regurgitating hearsay and opinions
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:08.560]  considering everyone's opinion is differing on this matter. You know, what
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:10.800]  are you going to do with the blood on your hands? And of course, Laura hung up
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:17.320]  on me as I was going to try to say, you bring a guy on who sells medicine. This
[02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:21.680]  guy sells medicine. Let me tell you how to counter these PR doctors. Most
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:26.000]  of them are getting money. You say, sir, have you read the insert of the measles
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.720]  shot where it admits it can give you measles? And just say, I have three
[02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:31.240]  points. Just quick ones. I want you to answer them. Thank you so much for having
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:37.440]  me on. Number one, are you aware that the MMR shot says it can give you the
[02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:42.360]  measles or even give you diabetes? Hold on, let me just give you the part two
[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:46.200]  because he'll interrupt you and say, let me just get the second question and then
[02:49:46.200 --> 02:49:49.800]  say separately, you know, how much have you gotten from pharmaceutical companies
[02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:53.000]  over the years, you know, in kickbacks as we know doctors get? Hold on, don't
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:56.760]  interrupt because you'll do that. And then say, number three, you know, don't
[02:49:56.760 --> 02:50:00.040]  act like there haven't been giant disasters like the swine flu vaccine
[02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:04.480]  that killed over 10,000 people or SV 40 cancer viruses. I mean, be honest,
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:09.800]  doctor. That's how you respond to them. Go ahead. I even brought up the Jenny
[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:12.560]  McCarthy thing as she said that her daughter or whatever died in her arms
[02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:15.800]  for two minutes. And he said, well, I just don't know. I do not believe her.
[02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:19.040]  What's the letter? I'm sorry to say. And it's like ridiculous. I brought up
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:23.160]  Dr. Wakefield and he just, no, let me tell you something. You did it. You
[02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:27.120]  called into a show, you hammered the enemy, you call into C spam, whatever.
[02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:30.440]  You did it. I wasn't second guessing what you said. You did a great job. Just
[02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:34.440]  calling in to fight these people was, was, was the spirit we need, brother.
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:39.880]  Definitely. It's more of just a morning to everyone. Don't fuss about anger, man.
[02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:43.560]  You can't fuss. Well, I mean, I would just say, read the inserts. Don't
[02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:47.640]  believe this doctor. Read the insert that comes with it. Not the fake fact sheet
[02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:52.080]  they give you at Walgreens or CVS. Tell them I want the insert and sit out and
[02:50:52.080 --> 02:50:57.000]  read the 50 different ways it'll kill you better than a big old iron hammer.

[02:54:01.600 --> 02:54:09.200]  Infullwars.com and Prismplotter.com are just loaded with key news. Michael
[02:54:09.200 --> 02:54:12.320]  Savage has come out saying Romney was forced out to ensure Hillary victory in
[02:54:12.320 --> 02:54:18.880]  2016. A video Bill Ayers admits he knows nothing. That's pretty funny. Man arrested
[02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:23.040]  on terrorism charges for carrying protein stacks. Power bar. They still tried to put
[02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:26.880]  him in prison for it, saying they were bombs. You can't make this up. Manufactured
[02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:31.240]  terror, not the economy, will dominate 2016. How the elite to plan to achieve
[02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:33.920]  digital immortality. They've openly announced their plan to merge the
[02:54:33.920 --> 02:54:37.060]  machines and live forever. Something that the media has made fun of in my film
[02:54:37.060 --> 02:54:41.600]  in-game and I'm quoting them. The powerful video. Car hacking. Someone dies at
[02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:46.600]  the end. Infullwars.com. Cop who killed 95-year-old over refusal of medical
[02:54:46.600 --> 02:54:49.880]  treatment found not guilty. We're gonna kill you because you won't go to the
[02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:55.120]  hospital. That's again cops following orders and again I blame the cops but
[02:54:55.120 --> 02:55:00.640]  also more blame this whole nanny state. Very dangerous. A lot of folks call the
[02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:03.040]  nanny state and think it's gonna help them and ends up tearing them up like
[02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:07.880]  being fed into a hay baler. The biggest victims of this are those that believe in
[02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:15.840]  it. Marty in Texas. Thanks for holding your on the air. Go ahead. Hi. What we
[02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:21.240]  need to do is to attack the inevitability that they seem to be
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:27.080]  pushing of mandatory vaccines. Yeah I'm not doing it but what they're gonna do is
[02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:30.240]  start not letting you have a job or travel without it. I mean they're this
[02:55:30.240 --> 02:55:34.680]  is it. So the government can put in you whatever they want. Boy that sounds like
[02:55:34.680 --> 02:55:39.680]  freedom doesn't it? Indeed. Well there's a couple things we can actually do
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:44.640]  about that I think and one is to really frame it as an issue of choice and
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:51.760]  that's what I was alluding to earlier was use start using the hashtag my body
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:59.560]  my choice on every piece of vaccine news. I agree let's put out a vaccine article
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:04.560]  and put a hashtag my body my choice because hey it's about being pro choice
[02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:10.600]  to be able to not take the vaccine. Absolutely a great idea. Exactly and to
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:15.800]  that end I've started a Facebook page facebook.com vaccine choice where there
[02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:19.960]  will be a bunch of resources and the truth and studies and articles that you
[02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:24.680]  can use to combat the paper cutout doctors on TV. Well you know what my dad
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:28.000]  does and what other doctors do with the medical boards that try to make medical
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:31.640]  workers take shots. My dad years ago this was going on for 20 years he'd go in
[02:56:31.640 --> 02:56:34.920]  and he'd follow he'd say you know what to the board because my dad's actually
[02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:39.480]  been on some boards. He said you know what I'll do that but you've got to sign
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:42.920]  this form saying you'll take full responsibility for any medical
[02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:46.240]  complications because the inserts says it can do all this and you know what they
[02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:50.760]  go you know what Dr. Jones you don't need to take it. I mean my dad's not
[02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:53.400]  going to take a hepatitis shot every year my dad's not gonna those things
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:57.200]  we're making him sick he's not stupid so it's just pure bull I mean we need to
[02:56:57.200 --> 02:57:01.120]  we're in a war folks we've got it just like a five years ago I had the whole
[02:57:01.120 --> 02:57:05.400]  flu thing hanging up signs about how dangerous vaccines are I want to do
[02:57:05.400 --> 02:57:08.600]  that again too I just don't have the resources of the energy so folks go to
[02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:13.120]  our old flu vaccine contest page print the flyers off yourselves start putting
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:16.920]  them up I mean just get aggressive you know what to do God bless you great
[02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:20.240]  idea Marty thanks for holding to talk about that let's go ahead and talk to
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:25.880]  Matt in Idaho then Kelly in Texas and others Matt welcome I just wanted to
[02:57:25.880 --> 02:57:30.160]  let you know that I was a nurse and I was on a vaccination team up here in
[02:57:30.160 --> 02:57:35.680]  Idaho back when the H1N1 was the big hot item and I went out and went out to
[02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:39.320]  the schools I saw a few kids get sick and when I got home I turned on the TV and
[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:44.720]  I saw Larry King was doing a story on 42 deaths by the by the vaccine over the
[02:57:44.720 --> 02:57:51.680]  weekend so I know I sent out an e I sent out an email and the next day I got
[02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:57.960]  fired and threatened told not to not to talk I want to get your name and number
[02:57:57.960 --> 02:58:02.480]  I'd like to get you on Skype or fly people like you here to go back find the
[02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:06.900]  story because I mean yeah these vaccines I see Reuters AP Bloomberg all the time
[02:58:06.900 --> 02:58:11.200]  where they tested it on 200 homeless 35 died one day later I mean they admit
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:18.040]  it's killing it's like a firing squad well I got I got more I mean me and my

[02:58:25.640 --> 02:58:30.440]  million dollars which Christine Grealish and Bill Gilbert are representing
[02:58:30.440 --> 02:58:34.080]  attorneys took three quarters of it we got basically stay there I'm gonna put
[02:58:34.080 --> 02:58:37.120]  you on hold we're going to overdrive them for worse dot com pray for America
[02:58:37.120 --> 02:58:41.400]  pray for peace pray for justice pray that you repent and wake up

[03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:31.280]  hi alex i'm a uh long time listener appreciate all your work you've done
[03:03:31.280 --> 03:03:35.920]  listen to you since 2003 and you're 99 percent of the time right
[03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:40.240]  um i don't even believe in that right but i sure try to be accurate go ahead
[03:03:40.240 --> 03:03:43.760]  i'd say an evil back in 2009 about my son's uh
[03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:49.040]  vaccine injury and uh i don't follow it what the media is not reporting
[03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:52.560]  you know for vaccine injuries you only have three years to file your
[03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:57.360]  cdc complaint or you're basically out of luck um
[03:03:57.360 --> 03:04:01.520]  unfortunately some of these soft kill vaccines you may take you three or four
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:06.000]  years to figure out what happened um that's why the enemy so smart they hit
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:11.520]  it was something that takes years to hit also i have a question for you um
[03:04:11.520 --> 03:04:14.960]  when i when i was young and naive just out of uh
[03:04:14.960 --> 03:04:20.720]  college i got wrapped up in a uh shop flu vaccine project and i was exposed to
[03:04:20.720 --> 03:04:23.760]  a lot of the uh methods these guys use
[03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:27.920]  i had a question for you some of these vaccines they sit in big warehouses
[03:04:27.920 --> 03:04:32.800]  um and they have expiration dates do you think that the pharmaceutical companies
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:37.920]  are purchasing media uh to push these vaccines out i was going to say that
[03:04:37.920 --> 03:04:42.000]  before we came back and i forgot i'm glad you mentioned that there must be god
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:45.760]  but remember all the fake news buying buying all the reporters and armstrong
[03:04:45.760 --> 03:04:48.880]  williams and all that that's going on right now that there's no doubt they're
[03:04:48.880 --> 03:04:52.000]  spending billions paying media not just with advertising but
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:55.280]  paying off reporters i'll guarantee you to put this out
[03:04:55.280 --> 03:05:21.520]  these people are judas scariots all the way
