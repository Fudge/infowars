[00:00.000 --> 00:16.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.640 --> 00:25.080]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones well job
[00:25.080 --> 00:33.320]  expectations trump even what they'd previously were record unemployment
[00:34.280 --> 00:38.520]  record employment we've got just all the stuff that's happening with the
[00:38.520 --> 00:43.640]  economy we've got all the criminal investigations of the Clintons and other
[00:43.640 --> 00:50.160]  crime families just exploding with evidence and my head is again just
[00:50.160 --> 00:56.560]  spinning here trying to know where to start look at this report bombshell
[00:56.560 --> 01:02.520]  Roy Moore accuser Beverly Nelson admits she forged the yearbook and that's
[01:02.520 --> 01:09.640]  because they knew ladies and gentlemen they were able to test the ink and more
[01:09.640 --> 01:14.440]  has been accusing it and now is moving forward to sue her and others saying it
[01:14.440 --> 01:21.200]  is totally and completely made up remember like a month ago all red wouldn't
[01:21.200 --> 01:26.560]  even say if she taught the yearbook was real or not this is really getting
[01:26.560 --> 01:34.520]  crazy so that is a major touchdown in the credibility column of Roy Moore and
[01:34.520 --> 01:39.880]  another big credibility win for him is the fact that we're gonna play this clip
[01:39.880 --> 01:49.360]  in a moment Roy Moore Putin may be right maybe he's more akin to me than I know
[01:49.360 --> 01:56.520]  said Roy Moore because this is the new litmus test that they engage in that if
[01:56.520 --> 02:00.080]  you don't hate the Russians or if you don't hate Vladimir Putin if you don't
[02:00.080 --> 02:02.520]  think they're the number one enemy in the world when it's actually the
[02:02.520 --> 02:07.760]  globalist the hijacked our country they're the main enemy then you must be a
[02:07.760 --> 02:14.320]  Ruski agent but I've watched Russian television not just RT but Russian
[02:14.320 --> 02:19.880]  news clips online with subtitles where they have official state-run youth
[02:19.880 --> 02:24.640]  meetings where they educate people that Hollywood wants to break your family up
[02:24.640 --> 02:28.720]  and Hollywood doesn't want you to have children and it's a eugenics plan to
[02:28.720 --> 02:32.960]  break your family up to make sure that cultures collapse and this is part of a
[02:32.960 --> 02:36.960]  larger plan to deindustrialize and destabilize nation states that Russia
[02:36.960 --> 02:45.600]  was under this for 70 plus years under communism and that's actually true so
[02:45.600 --> 02:49.000]  there still stay behind networks and globalist organizations and communist
[02:49.000 --> 02:55.120]  groups and atheists groups in Russia but the globalist hate Russia because it's
[02:55.120 --> 03:00.000]  woken up to the globalist the new world order because on the receiving end of it
[03:00.000 --> 03:11.220]  for a very very very long long time and so it's really a litmus test I mean Russia's
[03:11.220 --> 03:15.560]  trying to give people to have children they're trying to get back and have
[03:15.560 --> 03:18.920]  families they've already gotten to enjoy political correctness all the things
[03:18.920 --> 03:23.520]  that it brings with it for again more like 80 years and so they're trying to
[03:23.520 --> 03:28.960]  reform themselves so here is judge Roy Moore he said the Russia was the focus
[03:28.960 --> 03:35.680]  of evil in the modern world you could say that very well about America couldn't you
[03:35.680 --> 03:45.280]  do you think well we promote a lot of bad things you know like same-sex marriage
[03:45.280 --> 03:50.600]  that's the very argument that Vladimir Putin makes well then maybe Putin is
[03:50.600 --> 03:58.800]  right maybe he's more akin to me than I know so what's really going on here it's
[03:58.800 --> 04:03.920]  not that if two men want to marry each other that I hate them or think that
[04:03.920 --> 04:07.080]  they're individually bad people but it's in the textbooks it's in the government
[04:07.080 --> 04:11.800]  documents that globally this move towards ending families and and setting up
[04:11.800 --> 04:16.880]  taxes to make it hard to have children and confusing the sexuality the
[04:16.880 --> 04:24.080]  population is an admitted program to end the civilization as we know it my film
[04:24.080 --> 04:29.280]  in-game breaks that down and the big digital God the big AI technocracy
[04:29.280 --> 04:35.720]  that's coming in it's designed to end the former human species as we know it
[04:35.720 --> 04:41.000]  and so all of this is part of that now they're pushing you know that young
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.960]  people be rebellious don't be with a man or woman be with a robot I mean that's
[04:44.960 --> 04:50.240]  that's all this is is losing our humanity will be right back ladies and

[06:32.240 --> 06:37.240]  not allowed to air Big Crosby I mean I remember 10 years ago hearing the
[06:37.240 --> 06:40.560]  politically correct crowd didn't like it I thought it was a joke but now
[06:40.560 --> 06:47.720]  colleges and dormitories and restaurants and corporations have self-censored
[06:47.720 --> 06:54.440]  and don't let this song air along with hundreds and hundreds of others that
[06:54.440 --> 07:00.160]  are seen as insensitive and bad not just the word white or white Christmas
[07:00.160 --> 07:07.040]  meaning snow but also Christmas period more and more companies more and more
[07:07.040 --> 07:12.840]  shopping malls more and more event centers are only playing holiday music
[07:12.840 --> 07:19.120]  because hearing the word Christmas might hurt somebody's feelings I remember
[07:19.120 --> 07:21.800]  just five years ago hearing that they wanted to ban the use of the word
[07:21.800 --> 07:27.480]  mother and father on school entrance forms and now they've done it yes
[07:27.480 --> 07:31.920]  ladies and gentlemen this is the biological assault on men and women it's
[07:31.920 --> 07:37.360]  the biological assault on culture it is a scientific assault on anything
[07:37.360 --> 07:43.880]  traditional because culture and society is being overwritten by the technocracy
[07:43.880 --> 07:49.400]  and everything must be laid waste and dumbed down before the technocracy can
[07:49.400 --> 07:55.480]  come in and everything this article official reality super imposes onto us
[07:55.480 --> 08:04.880]  dehumanizes us and makes us die younger that's because it's poison before I get
[08:04.880 --> 08:10.560]  into the masses of news on the entire Russiagate narrative collapsing and the
[08:10.560 --> 08:14.920]  fact that now we know but we already knew that the Clintons were directing
[08:14.920 --> 08:20.360]  stay-behind networks and the FBI and Justice Department to criminally launch
[08:20.360 --> 08:32.880]  fraudulent investigations based on lies and manufactured dossiers and before we
[08:32.880 --> 08:37.680]  get into what's happening the economy and moves to impeach the president one
[08:37.680 --> 08:42.360]  such move that failed in a house vote yesterday before we get into all of this
[08:42.360 --> 08:47.800]  and the 46 earthquakes that have shaken California over the past 24 hours along
[08:47.800 --> 08:53.000]  with the worst fires in the state's history biblical is the word before we
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.960]  get into the latest bombshell that word gets overused that term but let me tell
[08:57.960 --> 09:07.800]  you the story up on info wars.com news wars.com right Bart.com bombshell Roy
[09:07.800 --> 09:13.360]  Moore accuser Beverly Nelson admits she forged the yearbook and now it's come
[09:13.360 --> 09:19.160]  out that other notes from other women are forgeries because more is starting the
[09:19.160 --> 09:23.320]  lawsuits people are getting served and they're going to have to turn that over
[09:23.320 --> 09:26.280]  they're going to be forensically studied and there is phony is three dollar
[09:26.280 --> 09:35.360]  bills or there is phony as Obama's birth certificate so there you go ladies and
[09:35.360 --> 09:40.360]  gentlemen that's just some of what's coming up as the globalists get more
[09:40.360 --> 09:48.000]  more desperate as the American recovery comes back to a hum and now a roar they
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.960]  are in full panic but first let me mention what political correctness is
[09:51.960 --> 09:57.840]  about it's about scientifically creating basket cases with chips on their
[09:57.840 --> 10:03.080]  shoulders who can't function in society and basically become institutionalized
[10:03.080 --> 10:12.360]  wards of the states and are politically kept or reservation warehouse
[10:12.360 --> 10:20.040]  groups who do not have families who do not procreate who do not have children
[10:20.040 --> 10:31.200]  and who are extremely depressed and alone living in artificial modern bubble
[10:31.200 --> 10:38.960]  style cities Google Facebook Twitter Amazon are all now building actual
[10:38.960 --> 10:44.520]  bubble cities within cities where these basket cases will live and well they'll
[10:44.520 --> 10:49.720]  have newly monthly downloads of how you talk and where you go and what you do
[10:49.720 --> 10:58.120]  so that they as neuroses controlled arrested development mental patients
[10:58.120 --> 11:05.360]  live in an ongoing reeducation camp environment and are so wounded so
[11:05.360 --> 11:11.480]  handicapped that they will only be comfortable in those
[11:11.480 --> 11:17.120]  cloistered bubbles this is the admitted plan how they're going to insert
[11:17.120 --> 11:24.920]  people according to their own will into the THX 1138 labyrinth that has been
[11:24.920 --> 11:30.920]  their ongoing plan since it was put into popular nomenclature and culture and
[11:30.920 --> 11:37.320]  parlance as a brave new world in 1932 1961 Huxley wrote brave new world
[11:37.320 --> 11:40.760]  revisited gave speeches at Merkley and said it's all a real plan my brother
[11:40.760 --> 11:46.520]  runs the U.M. we're gonna injure families by 2020 well they're behind schedule
[11:46.520 --> 11:53.920]  get to understand what I'm telling you is an admitted attack profile just like
[11:53.920 --> 11:57.000]  bombers get an attack profile where they're taking off from where they
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.440]  refuel targets they're gonna hit they can't hit those targets secondary and
[12:01.440 --> 12:06.240]  third targets how to return where to ditch if they get hit by flak missiles
[12:06.240 --> 12:12.800]  it's attack profile it's it's an exact attack like we have the Death Star plans
[12:12.800 --> 12:16.640]  we could stop it if people just decide to the good news is the president's
[12:16.640 --> 12:20.560]  listening and he's gone to the top advisors and technocrats and they've
[12:20.560 --> 12:24.760]  admitted the plan and he's just like we're not doing it people should be
[12:24.760 --> 12:29.640]  thanking God every second on their knees this is happening we have some shot at
[12:29.640 --> 12:36.840]  stopping it if we just wake up to it but I walked in this morning and all the
[12:36.840 --> 12:42.760]  sudden heard a robot talking and turned around and it was Alexa from Amazon and
[12:42.760 --> 12:46.280]  then I even looked and there were two Amazon boxes sitting right by it a little
[12:46.280 --> 12:51.560]  spy system that's been brought into the office and then there's even boxes from
[12:51.560 --> 12:55.400]  Amazon even though I've told people around here do not buy it from Amazon I
[12:55.400 --> 13:00.520]  guess unless you can only find it there and that's their goal is that it'll be
[13:00.520 --> 13:06.080]  the only place you can get it and I'm not joking when I say all that I was
[13:06.080 --> 13:11.520]  talking to a successful business lady last night at dinner that's a business
[13:11.520 --> 13:16.280]  and news meeting and she was talking about how they were at their house and
[13:16.280 --> 13:22.040]  they were talking trash about Bezos and about Amazon just a few weeks ago and
[13:22.040 --> 13:26.400]  Alexa came on without being asked and said are you really serious you mean
[13:26.400 --> 13:30.160]  that think about what you just said and I've confirmed from others it's turning
[13:30.160 --> 13:36.400]  on it's an AI computer not the little box that's just it's tentacle listening
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.640]  to you tracking what you do and collating it and I told you smartphones
[13:40.640 --> 13:43.880]  we're gonna do this 20 years ago and all about the smart TVs that was their
[13:43.880 --> 13:49.840]  bedded plan but now you invited in and know it's listening so of course air B
[13:49.840 --> 13:55.520]  and B's are watching and listening to you of course don't be so naive this is
[13:55.520 --> 13:59.360]  all just part of the conditioning process
[14:01.760 --> 14:06.520]  Fox News how to listen to everything Amazon Echo has ever heard yeah there's
[14:06.520 --> 14:10.480]  even databases people are getting into on the cloud now of everything that
[14:10.480 --> 14:14.480]  everyone on in your house according to its code name according to its little
[14:14.480 --> 14:18.440]  number and the people can find that number in the database they can listen
[14:18.440 --> 14:23.200]  to you just like they got online databases for a decade where hundreds of
[14:23.200 --> 14:26.680]  thousands now millions of cameras you can access them as people never change
[14:26.680 --> 14:30.880]  the code names you know the code numbers that come with them out of the box so
[14:30.880 --> 14:33.640]  you put up a surveillance camera at your business your house wherever it
[14:33.640 --> 14:37.480]  isn't just you making sure that the dog walker when you're out of town for two
[14:37.480 --> 14:43.160]  days comes over and takes care of spot hackers governments everybody but
[14:43.160 --> 14:51.040]  mainly big AI computers there's a big AI race between Microsoft and Amazon and
[14:51.040 --> 14:55.200]  IBM and then the Chinese and the Russians government private and they've
[14:55.200 --> 14:59.080]  got all these big AI computers they admit that they're hooking into
[14:59.080 --> 15:03.000]  everything they can and they have machine learning and they have the
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.440]  machines creating babies new machines and the scientists don't even know what
[15:07.440 --> 15:11.040] 's going on a decade ago they don't know how to program the stuff just
[15:11.040 --> 15:14.360]  computers are already making the new stuff and they just come in and try to
[15:14.360 --> 15:18.520]  figure out how to use basically alien technology the computers have created
[15:18.520 --> 15:21.800]  they're alien to this planet they're unofficial their silicon and they're
[15:21.800 --> 15:24.440]  just creating all this something like we don't know what it is it's like
[15:24.440 --> 15:30.840]  squiggly lines and symbols and weird ass stuff and all this new dad who knows
[15:30.840 --> 15:40.560]  what's already happened so again all that going on the UK is announced they're
[15:40.560 --> 15:45.840]  planning to ban men talking to women that's right they're banning free speech
[15:45.840 --> 15:49.240]  they're gonna say men cannot talk to women they don't know in public if you
[15:49.240 --> 15:54.680]  talk to them any other verbal thing it is an act of hate that's it banning

[21:21.120 --> 21:27.800]  no joke stories up on info wars comm from Breitbart Wolf whistling could become a
[21:27.800 --> 21:32.200]  hate crime in London say police that's how it works they just say oh being a
[21:32.200 --> 21:37.000]  Nazis a hate crime or protesting Muslims is a hate crime and then they just keep
[21:37.000 --> 21:43.280]  expanding and expanding to if you talk to a woman at a bus stop that the
[21:43.280 --> 21:47.200]  police will decide whether it's a crime or not so again they don't say oh we're
[21:47.200 --> 21:52.600]  gonna ban your speech they say oh we're gonna ban wolf whistling we're gonna ban
[21:52.600 --> 21:57.360]  wolf whistling but then we actually read what the police say it's unwanted
[21:57.360 --> 22:01.880]  comments or speaking to a woman notice it's to a woman oh is it to a man too
[22:01.880 --> 22:06.080]  yes mammals whether it's deer or whether it's whales or whether it's
[22:06.080 --> 22:09.920]  squirrels males come over to females sometimes and they don't like the M and
[22:09.920 --> 22:14.760]  they don't like how he looks or how he smells and they're not in the mode to get
[22:14.760 --> 22:21.080]  pregnant and so they say get away from me I've seen a male deer run up during
[22:21.080 --> 22:25.000]  rut to a doe and I've seen him kick them and all of a sudden she kind of likes
[22:25.000 --> 22:32.720]  him turns around or I've seen her biting or I've seen does run up to the male
[22:32.720 --> 22:39.440]  should we have police out there to stop the male deer the buck when the female
[22:39.440 --> 22:46.240]  is an estrus releasing eggs and he smells it he is bad he is trying to rape
[22:46.240 --> 22:52.720]  her this is an attack on biology admitted in their textbooks in the 60s I
[22:52.720 --> 22:56.600]  mean I've read to you the textbooks here on air that they have at the University
[22:56.600 --> 22:59.600]  of Texas and other major universities the Calhoun reader for social workers
[22:59.600 --> 23:08.440]  where it says families belong to the ancient times and our arcane and we
[23:08.440 --> 23:14.560]  will get rid of them that is the plan wolf whistle could become a hate crime
[23:14.560 --> 23:23.800]  in London say police you know male birds tweeted females too and and and male
[23:23.800 --> 23:32.920]  dogs and male cats go here a Tomcat if everybody does with a Tomcat looking
[23:32.920 --> 23:39.560]  for a female sounds like he's trying to rape cats it should be bad as well see
[23:39.560 --> 23:43.680]  so so they take men hitting on women and sometimes women don't like it sometimes
[23:43.680 --> 23:47.800]  men are aggressive and their thugs and it's wrong just don't touch them as
[23:47.800 --> 23:50.560]  somebody starts harassing you you can say get away from me you're harassing me
[23:50.560 --> 23:56.720]  but just to say talking to a woman is sexual assault that's the new thing but
[23:56.720 --> 24:00.440]  I remember here in 20 something years ago that feminists were teaching in women
[24:00.440 --> 24:05.440]  studies at major universities that all sex is rape I didn't believe it till I
[24:05.440 --> 24:11.600]  read it in textbooks now it's mainstream ladies and gentlemen so again this is
[24:11.600 --> 24:14.600]  the attack on biology where you get so sick of it you're always afraid to talk
[24:14.600 --> 24:20.360]  to a girl or talk to a boy so next you just watch porn or you watch sexbots and
[24:20.360 --> 24:27.160]  now large portions of Millennials I've got the numbers right here say that they
[24:27.160 --> 24:34.360]  want to marry a sexbot 27% of Millennials say they would consider dating a
[24:34.360 --> 24:39.920]  robot over humans that's because they're so used to their devices and their
[24:39.920 --> 24:44.080]  machines and it's a big problem you know people say oh promiscuity is down in
[24:44.080 --> 24:47.560]  young people well not having kids periods a bigger problem and did you know
[24:47.560 --> 24:51.800]  that for the first time in decades there's way less teenagers having sex
[24:51.800 --> 24:55.600]  than there was before but that's not because of conservatism it's because
[24:55.600 --> 25:03.560]  they're scared they want to have sex with a plastic robot so again ladies and
[25:03.560 --> 25:07.440]  gentlemen I'm not saying it's good to be promised I have promiscuity but is it
[25:07.440 --> 25:12.160]  better to never have kids or never get married I mean your 16 year old daughter
[25:12.160 --> 25:14.920]  gets pregnant you don't want to abort the baby it's gonna be great having that
[25:14.920 --> 25:20.160]  grand kid but a but just imagine the whole thing with a sexbot see because
[25:20.160 --> 25:25.200]  they're so uncomfortable and it's got these guys trying to act trendy and talk
[25:25.200 --> 25:29.440]  cool because they're in control and this woman doesn't talk back and this woman
[25:29.440 --> 25:32.720]  doesn't you know have a period and you know this woman doesn't have friends
[25:32.720 --> 25:36.640]  it's all about him this is disgusting now they're coming out with virtual
[25:36.640 --> 25:41.960]  reality undistinguishable from reality
[25:42.560 --> 25:47.000]  wolf was sling could become a hate crime see how that works wolf was sling and
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.840]  making comments perceived as sexist see sexist oh perceived could become hate
[25:51.840 --> 25:56.080]  crimes in London police have said that's relative police force revealed they
[25:56.080 --> 25:59.520]  have been consulting with other forces about cracking down on gender-based
[25:59.520 --> 26:03.040]  hate crime that for similar behavior was criminalized in other parts of the
[26:03.040 --> 26:08.200]  country it's already here talking to women or verbal utterances illegal
[26:08.200 --> 26:14.600]  because they have this nebulous Soviet style thought crime system but
[26:14.600 --> 26:20.120]  meanwhile up to 4,000 girls in one town were groomed at ages as young as seven
[26:20.120 --> 26:24.680]  and sold out by Muslim men for sex and they wouldn't help the parents the
[26:24.680 --> 26:29.960]  police wouldn't because it would be racist to criticize the men putting
[26:29.960 --> 26:35.040]  their girls into sex slavery I guess one of the big Muslim pastimes grooming
[26:35.040 --> 26:38.360]  gangs are abusing girls across the country victims and investigators warn
[26:38.360 --> 26:42.560]  they want there to be up to a million-plus girls now being used in sex
[26:42.560 --> 26:47.600]  slavery sometimes they get them out of the country to and sell them isn't that
[26:47.600 --> 26:51.240]  nice I mean wow that's really liberal isn't it
[26:51.240 --> 26:55.680]  meanwhile Juanita Broderick says time nixed her from hashtag me to comments
[26:55.680 --> 27:00.520]  because she wasn't a liberal victim she was raped by Bill Clinton he settled
[27:00.520 --> 27:07.040]  many of the cases so now we have Judge Roy Moore's one of her accusers a bunch
[27:07.040 --> 27:11.680]  of them turned out to be fraudulent has now admitted Beverly Nelson that she
[27:11.680 --> 27:16.280]  forged the yearbook but BuzzFeed and others are still saying well it's still
[27:16.280 --> 27:22.160]  real the rest of the story oh yeah you got a forged deal just like Moore said
[27:22.160 --> 27:26.840]  but still you're credible yeah that's ridiculous here let's play that video
[27:26.840 --> 27:32.640]  clip this morning Beverly young Nelson sitting down exclusively with GMA she
[27:32.640 --> 27:37.200]  was 16 when she says Moore groped her and tried to force a sex act on her in
[27:37.200 --> 27:42.200]  his car he was trying to pull me toward in between his legs it was terrible and
[27:42.200 --> 27:48.400]  I was bound and determined that I was not gonna be raped by him you know I was
[27:48.400 --> 27:53.600]  terrified but the next thing I know I'm on the concrete these allegations are
[27:53.600 --> 27:59.280]  completely false they're malicious specifically I do not know any of these
[27:59.280 --> 28:04.800]  women nor have I engaged have I ever engaged in sexual misconduct with any
[28:04.800 --> 28:09.280]  woman Moore supporters have called Nelson a liar even compared her to a
[28:09.280 --> 28:14.440]  criminal since she first spoke out about three weeks ago that really hurt me you
[28:14.440 --> 28:21.280]  know God knows and Roy no knows and I know what happened young's proof that
[28:21.280 --> 28:25.960]  she knew more her yearbook with this inscription but Moore and his supporters
[28:25.960 --> 28:29.680]  have called into question that inscription noting the writing under the
[28:29.680 --> 28:34.280]  signature appears to be different let's look at Beverly Nelson everybody knows
[28:34.280 --> 28:38.320]  her yearbook is a forgery Nelson says she did make notes to the inscription but
[28:38.320 --> 28:43.240]  the message was all Roy Moore Beverly he signed your yearbook he did sign it and
[28:43.240 --> 28:49.040]  you made some notes underneath yes Nelson says this is not about politics
[28:49.040 --> 28:53.200]  she voted for Donald Trump but can't understand the decision we'll be back

[33:47.040 --> 33:53.840]  studio Ted Malick who's been the head of a lot of the major globalist
[33:53.840 --> 33:57.920]  organizations with a US perspective and one of the main board members of the
[33:57.920 --> 34:01.960]  Davos group in the last decade he totally turned against it and has been
[34:01.960 --> 34:06.400]  preaching its downfall saying it's authoritarian that it lied to people
[34:06.400 --> 34:11.120]  that were you know trying to promote interconnectivity and free market
[34:11.120 --> 34:15.880]  worldwide and that now globalism is fully run by the EU and kleptocratic

[34:33.160 --> 34:37.280]  in about an hour so spread the word about that we're going to get into huge
[34:37.280 --> 34:43.520]  developments with the EU the EU is now telling Eastern Europe that we are going
[34:43.520 --> 34:48.800]  to forcibly ship millions of Muslims in and you're not even allowed to stop us
[34:48.800 --> 34:53.720]  so they've gone from threatening hundred thousand euro fines that's basically
[34:53.720 --> 34:58.160]  a hundred thousand dollars per illegal that they can't force in to just saying
[34:58.160 --> 35:05.320]  we have an EU military and we're bringing them in and Soros is a private
[35:05.320 --> 35:11.640]  Navy bringing in tens of thousands a week just into Italy and they put
[35:11.640 --> 35:15.280]  jihadist in control of North Africa they're selling men women and children

[35:26.880 --> 35:31.240]  just joined us wolf whistling or just talking to women period to be illegal
[35:31.240 --> 35:35.320]  in London as it is in other cities so they let Muslims rape people and kidnap
[35:35.320 --> 35:40.000]  little girls and three four five thousand and some some towns more one
[35:40.000 --> 35:45.040]  article's four thousand and one town alone in sex slavery that's okay in fact
[35:45.040 --> 35:48.920]  they will not even respond because they say it's politically correct but if you
[35:48.920 --> 35:54.280]  are a Christian or an agnostic or a guy you know from Eastern Europe or somebody
[35:54.280 --> 35:57.560]  that was born in England doesn't matter if you're not a Muslim and you talk to
[35:57.560 --> 36:03.200]  women they're gonna take you to jail so this is not a joke just like banning
[36:03.200 --> 36:10.120]  mother and fathers on a joke this is this is really happening meanwhile 27% of

[36:14.120 --> 36:18.480]  robots become an ever-increasing part of our daily lives humans could soon find
[36:18.480 --> 36:21.760]  love with machines according to a new report the report suggests that over a
[36:21.760 --> 36:26.720]  quarter of 18 and 34 year olds feel it's normal to form relationships even
[36:26.720 --> 36:31.400]  romantic relationships with robots in the future instead of humans this is how
[36:31.400 --> 36:34.960]  they dehumanize you where you're so afraid of rejection or so afraid of
[36:34.960 --> 36:39.720]  interaction that you will accept this and then think it's cool like you're
[36:39.720 --> 36:43.880]  really getting it over on somebody that you decided not to have children
[36:43.880 --> 36:48.000]  friends or family and you don't even talk to your family you just text to your
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.440]  so-called friends and talk to online bots most Facebook friends for liberals
[36:52.440 --> 36:56.040]  that came out in their secret documents this year are bots they're already
[36:56.040 --> 37:00.800]  talking to an artificial avatar that is a computer program that knows how to
[37:00.800 --> 37:04.720]  reward them and tell them good and packed them on the head but then add
[37:04.720 --> 37:09.280]  anxiety and then they respond to the bot and the bot comes back and makes it okay
[37:09.280 --> 37:12.840]  and then they get a dopamine release and then Sean Parker admits it all to you
[37:12.840 --> 37:20.600]  but you can't get out of it because you're too comfortable in it so let me
[37:20.600 --> 37:24.560]  get back to bombshell Roy Moore accuser Beverly Nelson admits she forged
[37:24.560 --> 37:28.480]  your book at first he said it was all real more looked at it said that's not
[37:28.480 --> 37:33.040]  my handwriting none of that is I'm suing you we're gonna have forensics
[37:33.040 --> 37:37.600]  check that should he use oh should have found a pen from 35 years ago sweetheart
[37:37.600 --> 37:44.920]  should have done that but they didn't so now she just slips it in oh I wrote the
[37:44.920 --> 37:52.080]  part under it oh oh oh but she didn't say that before sweetie and notice she
[37:52.080 --> 37:55.520]  didn't look at it the camera she's looking to the side and it just sounds
[37:55.520 --> 37:58.560]  his phonies a three-dollar bill and then most these women are Democratic Party
[37:58.560 --> 38:04.120]  operatives people say well if Franken's got a step down why is it Trump or more
[38:04.120 --> 38:08.720]  it's your party has made mere allegations enough for someone to be
[38:08.720 --> 38:14.360]  executed and you equate Weinstein with all these witnesses to rape his own
[38:14.360 --> 38:21.400]  chauffeur credible people you now equate that with being a little bit aggressive
[38:21.400 --> 38:26.200]  hitting on women I mean you ought to go to a third-world country you ought to go
[38:26.200 --> 38:30.440]  to Italy or Spain I mean you're a good-looking woman walking around I'm
[38:30.440 --> 38:34.160]  not saying you deserve to be raped but you're walking around in hey I'm looking
[38:34.160 --> 38:39.040]  for men I'm dressed up then men whistle at you and they hit on you that's how it
[38:39.040 --> 38:45.000]  works shaking your tail feathers like going to a topless bar you know and
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.360]  saying you don't look at my breast or something so they're taking normal mammal
[38:50.360 --> 38:54.800]  behavior and equating it with everything else it's truly incredible so here they
[38:54.800 --> 38:59.640]  are slipping it into the news report slipping it in where she admits it's a
[38:59.640 --> 39:03.520]  fraud here it is Nelson says she did make notes to the inscription but the
[39:03.520 --> 39:08.320]  message was all Roy Moore Beverly he signed your yearbook he did sign it and
[39:08.320 --> 39:14.080]  you made some notes underneath yes Nelson says this is not about politics
[39:14.080 --> 39:18.200]  she voted for Donald Trump yeah right but can't understand the decision some
[39:18.200 --> 39:21.720]  Republicans are making what do you think about the Republicans that say they
[39:21.720 --> 39:25.320]  that's good like you now let me get to this since I mentioned that this is
[39:25.320 --> 39:32.560]  uber creepy this is again the robot sex doll Samantha is able to switch from
[39:32.560 --> 39:38.040]  family mode to sexy model and now as I predicted they're saying they're gonna
[39:38.040 --> 39:42.720]  have rights and we're so liberal we're like oh you can be a walrus if you're
[39:42.720 --> 39:46.480]  or you can be a three-year-old kid or you can be a dog or if you're a man you

[40:15.600 --> 40:22.400]  fragilistic expialidocious open sesame but it's even harder to say than that
[40:22.400 --> 40:29.640]  it's like he sold seashells by the she sure I mean it's harder than that to

[42:53.720 --> 43:00.280]  this is the end for war President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of
[43:00.280 --> 43:04.240]  Israel this week in a move that some say will shake the Middle East to the core
[43:04.240 --> 43:07.520]  Israel's neighbors are extremely displeased with Trump's announcement
[43:07.520 --> 43:11.800]  the Turkish president warned Trump that recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of
[43:11.800 --> 43:15.960]  Israel was a red line the Saudis are calling this a flagrant provocation of
[43:15.960 --> 43:19.720]  Muslims and Palestinian leaders have already planned for protests terror
[43:19.720 --> 43:24.560]  group Hamas is calling for a day of rage Friday urging Palestinians in an
[43:24.560 --> 43:28.800]  official Arabic statement to send a message with all available means to
[43:28.800 --> 43:32.640]  Israel after the upcoming Friday prayers ahead of President Trump's
[43:32.640 --> 43:36.400]  announcement the US military deployed additional forces throughout the Middle
[43:36.400 --> 43:40.960]  East in anticipation of widespread political unrest and even terror attacks
[43:40.960 --> 43:44.600]  although some US officials had urged Trump not to make this sort of a move
[43:44.600 --> 43:49.240]  US policy should never be dictated by threats of violence with the opposition
[43:49.240 --> 43:52.680]  against Trump's historic decision-building the days ahead could
[43:52.680 --> 43:57.760]  turn out to be tumultuous Leanne McAdoo info wars.com

[47:23.880 --> 47:32.440]  ringaling ringaling it's so
[47:38.360 --> 47:48.360]  city sidewalk busy sidewalk brest in holiday style in the air there's a
[47:48.360 --> 47:56.200]  Again, when you're listening to the Alex Jones show, I am your host.
[47:56.200 --> 48:00.120]  We're playing some evil politically correct stuff here that's like high noon and holy
[48:00.120 --> 48:04.760]  water to vampires and globalist control freaks everywhere.
[48:04.760 --> 48:10.400]  News wars dot com and info wars dot com are the websites.
[48:10.400 --> 48:15.120]  By the way, if you're a radio listener, you haven't been fortunate enough or unfortunate
[48:15.120 --> 48:16.880]  enough to actually see what we're showing.
[48:16.880 --> 48:22.520]  But everywhere they're pushing sex bots and they're a giant new industry, basically just
[48:22.520 --> 48:30.520]  fancy blow up dolls that have like an Alexa bot program hooked into the central network
[48:30.520 --> 48:35.320]  of the people that produce these and the tech companies just have basically a big rubber
[48:35.320 --> 48:40.440]  blow up doll sex bot that's in your house that has like a flashlight, I guess is what
[48:40.440 --> 48:47.960]  they call them as a sex member and they push it is trendy and brave and cool.
[48:47.960 --> 48:53.640]  They're now even creating on the lgb2qp3cl4 they were showing me the designations they
[48:53.640 --> 48:57.120]  show elementary kids in Canada, the US and the UK.
[48:57.120 --> 48:58.440]  Let's put that back on screen.
[48:58.440 --> 49:01.560]  You guys found some of those during the break because they're ever expanding.
[49:01.560 --> 49:07.720]  They're now saying sex with machines or sex with cars or sex with appliances.
[49:07.720 --> 49:12.360]  There's a whole big movement where people are marrying their cars, marrying their toasters,
[49:12.360 --> 49:14.640]  marrying their dogs, their cats, their horses.
[49:14.640 --> 49:16.360]  I'm not kidding.
[49:16.360 --> 49:18.200]  And they're catching people in public places.
[49:18.200 --> 49:22.840]  You see it all the time, like I'm trying to have sex with a Ferrari or trying to have
[49:22.840 --> 49:29.640]  sex with a 57 Chevy and they actually, I'm not going to do the details of what they do,
[49:29.640 --> 49:33.000]  but they lube up the tailpipe and everything and then they please come up and there's a
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.160]  guy hunching your car.
[49:35.160 --> 49:38.880]  So this is the total mental illness, a breakdown of society.
[49:38.880 --> 49:43.400]  If you don't let somebody have sex with your car, you're a homophobe, you're a bigot, you're
[49:43.400 --> 49:44.400]  a horrible person.
[49:44.400 --> 49:46.440]  By the way, this is not satire.
[49:46.440 --> 49:47.680]  I'm not kidding here.
[49:47.680 --> 49:50.080]  Okay, this is what they're teaching kids now.
[49:50.080 --> 49:54.720]  And so you could dump drain-o in your eyes, identify as a blind person and the government
[49:54.720 --> 49:59.640]  of the US or UK or Canada will pay for you to be taken care of for the rest of your life
[49:59.640 --> 50:03.800]  because you were mentally ill and wanted to hurt yourself and pour drain-o in your eyes,
[50:03.800 --> 50:05.960]  a drain cleaner.
[50:05.960 --> 50:08.320]  So this is the whole plan.
[50:08.320 --> 50:13.160]  And of course, I think I'm going to buy some of these sex dolls and basically torch them
[50:13.160 --> 50:15.560]  just to show folks that their AI God is nothing but a fraud.
[50:15.560 --> 50:20.480]  Now I think there's going to be a major outcry that I'm a bigot and evil person for doing
[50:20.480 --> 50:21.480]  it.
[50:21.480 --> 50:24.480]  But we've got to start saying we're for normal biological behavior, we're for the future
[50:24.480 --> 50:31.240]  of the human species, we don't want to be dehumanized, we don't want to follow the AI
[50:31.240 --> 50:36.480]  technology plan of the AI gods where they make normal biological reproduction, physically
[50:36.480 --> 50:39.800]  impossible and then absorb us into this matrix.
[50:39.800 --> 50:41.760]  That's their admitted plan.
[50:41.760 --> 50:44.840]  They've been pre-programming you through Hollywood.
[50:44.840 --> 50:51.960]  And we've got to come together as humans and have like a human union, a pro-human movement
[50:51.960 --> 50:55.920]  where we buy stuff made by humans, we buy things that are good for humans, we buy things
[50:55.920 --> 51:01.520]  that are against the technocracy that is anti-human and believes it's going to become AI gods,
[51:01.520 --> 51:06.080]  these insane Luciferian scumbags, we've got to decide which side we're on.
[51:06.080 --> 51:09.440]  And that's really the big demarcation line that I've been warning you about for two
[51:09.440 --> 51:12.680]  plus decades that's now suddenly everywhere.
[51:12.680 --> 51:16.560]  I tuned into two different talk radio shows last night driving to a business meeting and
[51:16.560 --> 51:17.560]  driving back.
[51:17.560 --> 51:22.160]  And on two different shows, they were talking about the AI gods and the takeover and how
[51:22.160 --> 51:26.800]  they're going to make it impossible to reproduce and then force you to waive your rights into
[51:26.800 --> 51:31.800]  this big collective and make things so ugly that you then want to enter virtual reality.
[51:31.800 --> 51:35.280]  And then you can't have children normally, so they create these new humanoids.
[51:35.280 --> 51:37.480]  And that's what's next.
[51:37.480 --> 51:39.600]  Animals have rights, humans have rights.
[51:39.600 --> 51:44.800]  For at least 40 years, they've got human animal chimeras because they have no rights
[51:44.800 --> 51:46.600]  because they're alien to the planet.
[51:46.600 --> 51:51.560]  They're new and they keep it very quiet, sequestered like the Manhattan Project, but it's probably
[51:51.560 --> 51:53.480]  about 200 times bigger.
[51:53.480 --> 51:58.800]  And now it's coming out because it's going to be, hey, I want a replicant for me, Marilyn
[51:58.800 --> 52:00.120]  Monroe.
[52:00.120 --> 52:05.240]  And it is going to be a human that is part synthetic DNA.
[52:05.240 --> 52:07.000]  They're going to argue it doesn't have rights.
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.360]  That's where all this is going, guaranteed.
[52:10.360 --> 52:15.680]  And baby, you better believe there are humanoids walking around right now.
[52:15.680 --> 52:16.680]  They are humanoids.
[52:16.680 --> 52:20.360]  They have at least 20 years, they have been bringing them to term.
[52:20.360 --> 52:21.360]  They're out there.
[52:21.360 --> 52:23.760]  They're walking around and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[52:23.760 --> 52:28.040]  The media is going to attack me, but they're walking around.
[52:28.040 --> 52:32.200]  And by the way, you're being biologically changed with the GMO by design is really like
[52:32.200 --> 52:35.120]  a vaccine that we first told you this 10 years ago.
[52:35.120 --> 52:39.760]  It's now was released last year by MIT that they're actually putting vaccines in the food,
[52:39.760 --> 52:45.360]  the GMO that's not really vaccines, that biologically changes your DNA as a mutagen and it gives
[52:45.360 --> 52:50.880]  most people cancer, but they believe that they're going to have mutagenic developments
[52:50.880 --> 52:55.760]  in us as test tubes to then see what ends up coming out of it to give them the Lazarus
[52:55.760 --> 52:56.760]  gene.
[52:56.760 --> 53:00.160]  And again, that's the immortal cell line.
[53:00.160 --> 53:01.160]  Another big thing they're obsessed with.
[53:01.160 --> 53:02.160]  I'm giving you all the key data points.
[53:02.160 --> 53:05.440]  If you want to research any one of these one points, they'll take you down massive rabbit
[53:05.440 --> 53:09.080]  holes that will blow your mind.
[53:09.080 --> 53:13.760]  Let's go ahead and play the robot plastic blow up doll with this creak climbing all over
[53:13.760 --> 53:14.760]  it.
[53:14.760 --> 53:15.760]  Here we go.
[53:15.760 --> 53:17.000]  Samantha is interactive.
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.840]  Basically, she likes to be touched.
[53:19.840 --> 53:21.440]  She has different modes of interaction.
[53:21.440 --> 53:22.440]  She likes to be touched.
[53:22.440 --> 53:23.440]  She has romantic.
[53:23.440 --> 53:24.440]  She has family.
[53:24.440 --> 53:25.440]  Romantic.
[53:25.440 --> 53:26.440]  And she has also sexy modes.
[53:26.440 --> 53:27.440]  You can touch Samantha.
[53:27.440 --> 53:28.840]  For example, in the hips.
[53:28.840 --> 53:30.720]  You can touch Samantha also in the arms.
[53:30.720 --> 53:31.720]  You can touch Samantha.
[53:31.720 --> 53:33.040]  No problem, huh?
[53:33.040 --> 53:34.040]  You can kiss Samantha.
[53:34.040 --> 53:35.040]  Oh baby.
[53:35.040 --> 53:36.040]  You like to be kissed.
[53:36.040 --> 53:37.040]  Normally she likes to be kissed.
[53:37.040 --> 53:38.040]  You can kiss her.
[53:38.040 --> 53:39.040]  Always.
[53:39.040 --> 53:40.040]  Hey, she's not real.
[53:40.040 --> 53:45.840]  And also, she responds to basically the G-spots and also, she can also respond to the hands.
[53:45.840 --> 53:48.080]  So basically, the hands are family, they're romantic.
[53:48.080 --> 53:49.080]  Oh, so good.
[53:49.080 --> 53:50.080]  Oh baby.
[53:50.080 --> 53:51.080]  Family and romantic.
[53:51.080 --> 53:56.600]  And basically the spot where basically she feels sexy would be mouth and the G-spot.
[53:56.600 --> 53:57.600]  The G-spot?
[53:57.600 --> 53:58.600]  Yeah.
[53:58.600 --> 54:02.280]  A way of interacting that initially she would like to be romantic.
[54:02.280 --> 54:03.280]  She would like to be family.
[54:03.280 --> 54:04.280]  Oh.
[54:04.280 --> 54:06.280]  You get to a point where she wants to be sexual.
[54:06.280 --> 54:07.280]  Oh, baby.
[54:07.280 --> 54:12.360]  The objective, the final objective of the sexual mode is to get her to the orgasm.
[54:12.360 --> 54:13.760]  To get her to the orgasm.
[54:13.760 --> 54:14.760]  All of it's a lie.
[54:14.760 --> 54:16.440]  But it's all part of the new false reality.
[54:16.440 --> 54:20.720]  They were just, oh, yes, it's trending, shut up, shut up, you just don't know how cool
[54:20.720 --> 54:21.720]  it is.
[54:21.720 --> 54:22.720]  I tell you, it was cool.
[54:22.720 --> 54:26.560]  I was walking around the woods this morning with the frost and snow on the ground here
[54:26.560 --> 54:32.440]  in Austin and seeing the moon come up behind the hills and to walk around for two hours
[54:32.440 --> 54:38.680]  from the time the sun came up at 6.30 in the morning until about nine o'clock, I guess
[54:38.680 --> 54:39.680]  longer than two hours.
[54:39.680 --> 54:45.080]  I came back to the house for a while, went back out, but it was just so gorgeous, so real,
[54:45.080 --> 54:49.800]  so transcendent, and you'll never be able to duplicate reality.
[54:49.800 --> 54:53.960]  And this is the great fight for our consciousness by design right now.
[54:53.960 --> 54:58.400]  We're going to order a few of these, though, so we can, again, just point out how pathetic
[54:58.400 --> 54:59.400]  it all is.
[54:59.400 --> 55:03.000]  And then, but I would say we should order the used one, the floor model.
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.840]  There's a lot of jokes in this.
[55:07.840 --> 55:09.600]  It's so ridiculous.
[55:09.600 --> 55:14.360]  Just briefly, ladies and gentlemen, why on earth would you fight the crowds?
[55:14.360 --> 55:18.520]  Why would you fight the traffic to go out and get a bunch of slop?
[55:18.520 --> 55:25.400]  When you can go get 50% off super high quality fortified with iodine and colloidal silver
[55:25.400 --> 55:30.280]  fluoride free toothpaste for children and adults and our great mouthwash, 50% off right
[55:30.280 --> 55:34.680]  now that special will have to end on Sunday because we're running low on the toothpaste.
[55:34.680 --> 55:40.880]  Also DNA force sold out for months, 33% off our flagship products, so incredible.
[55:40.880 --> 55:46.640]  Point out about what that does for your telomeres, your mitochondria, it really is amazing.
[55:46.640 --> 55:48.440]  It's known to regrow nerves.
[55:48.440 --> 55:51.880]  So sometimes it'll bring pain back in areas where the nerves have gone dead.
[55:51.880 --> 55:52.880]  That's a major study.
[55:52.880 --> 55:54.040]  So this isn't a joke.
[55:54.040 --> 56:00.480]  We've got 1000 plus reviews, 4.8 stars, 96% review, DNA force, 33% off.
[56:00.480 --> 56:04.920]  That's going to have to end also vitamin refusion, 50% off.
[56:04.920 --> 56:10.120]  That is going to have to end and you can order all this and it gets to you in three, four
[56:10.120 --> 56:12.160]  days, okay?
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.120]  You can order up until the 19th and be guaranteed to get it anywhere in the United States.
[56:16.120 --> 56:21.520]  So why fight the crowds, get your Christmas shopping done right now, give yourself the
[56:21.520 --> 56:25.880]  gift of healthy stuff, give some vitamin mineral fusion, you know to your nephews or nieces
[56:25.880 --> 56:26.880]  or to your grandma.
[56:26.880 --> 56:31.840]  Especially old folks, they have absorption problems for multivitamins and multiminerals
[56:31.840 --> 56:34.440]  and amino acid formulas when it's pills.
[56:34.440 --> 56:38.480]  This is much more absorbable and it's got the enzymes and things in it so they absorb
[56:38.480 --> 56:39.480]  more of it.
[56:39.480 --> 56:42.760]  So many old folks have vitamin and mineral deficiencies, a lot of kids have it because
[56:42.760 --> 56:44.400]  they're not eating healthy stuff.
[56:44.400 --> 56:48.640]  Vitamin refusion is amazing, 50% off.

[57:07.560 --> 57:11.400]  I can actually say all this because of all the studies that are out there and authorized,
[57:11.400 --> 57:15.160]  the LJ100, just look into what that is.
[57:15.160 --> 57:18.720]  Boost sports performance, increases physical and medical energy, helps maintain higher
[57:18.720 --> 57:22.720]  levels of what's supposed to be healthy, the testosterone that's so low in most men.

[59:50.800 --> 01:00:02.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:15.280]  By the way, I want to take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.440]  of the Resistance.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:23.360]  I'm going to dig this up because I saw it yesterday and I just got reminded of it because
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.120]  I saw on DrudgeReport.com the photo of Dustin Hoffman posing for a photo grabbing a woman's
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.120]  breast.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.440]  I just punched that up and all these new accusers are coming forward.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:38.440]  But I saw one photo and it found a whole gallery and I asked Pat Riley when we were working
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:42.600]  out to send it to him and he didn't need to call him up.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:47.600]  And it was Biden like standing behind a woman grabbing both her breasts, I mean, full on
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.480]  more than even Dustin Hoffman is, I mean, he's cupping her breast and she's holding
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:56.680]  his elbow and she looks like she's having a good time doing it.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.400]  And the woman being grabbed by Biden looks like she's liking it standing right next
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.400]  to her husband.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.400]  I've got to find that photo.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:07.880]  Just do a whole system-wide search or call Pat Riley or whatever you've got to do.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:12.160]  But ask Q to call Pat Riley, just ask him.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.560]  Pat's on vacation with his wife for two days, quick vacation, he works here.
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:19.680]  He's a great guy, just like, if I really want something, it's like, I really want that.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.680]  No, you can't have it.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.640]  I want to show you this photo because I had to see it and I found a bunch of other photos.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:27.960]  It just shows the disconnect, is there any photo of Roy Moore doing that?
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.160]  Is there any photo of Trump doing that?
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.160]  No.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.760]  But again, in most of these photos, the women look like they love it.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:39.400]  And I've been out in Hollywood and I've experienced it myself where women throw themselves at
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:50.640]  you and you've seen Elvis in the 50s and girls are throwing their underwear at him and people
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.520]  would try to rape Elvis.
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:56.760]  So sometimes women get really fired up and come after men and it's not seen as rape-like
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.320]  behavior when they're doing it.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.760]  It's mammals getting really excited about each other.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.520]  But if it's not wanted, then it is sexual assault.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.560]  No, that's not the one.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:06.560]  It's that one.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.560]  It's that one.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.560]  It's that one.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:11.520]  But folks are saying that's a fake one.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.520]  Well, I know it's not fake.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:17.120]  It's all the countless videos of him groping children because you guys just found another
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.440]  one in there.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.360]  No, it's, that's not the one he had, it was another one.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:27.880]  The point is, we could run hours of video of Biden groping little kids.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:30.720]  And so I know that stuff off C-Span is a fake.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.520]  That's the problem with fakes, though, they put fakes out to then discredit real research
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.560]  that we're doing.
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.960]  The point is, is that it's mainly Democrats that are reporting that are part of this big
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.840]  slush fund.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:51.040]  So people keep asking me, why do you still like Trump and why do you leave the door open
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.520]  on more?
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:57.080]  Well, Al Franken admits the photo of him grabbing the woman's breast while she's asleep, flying
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:02.720]  back from Iraq for the USO, he admits that's real.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.600]  And Franken's been known for that over and over again.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.040]  He's Hollywood scum.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.600]  So they're the ones that have the history.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.640]  They're the ones bombarding our kids with sexual messages.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:16.800]  They're the ones trying to sexualize everything, not Roy Moore and not Donald Trump.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:21.320]  And so Donald Trump never had any of these accusers until he ran for president.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.640]  Here we have a Psycho Joe clip, I think it's important.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.640]  Let's play this.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.200]  I went together some opinion pieces in response to this.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:35.760]  I just have an incredibly uneasy feeling about this entire story, to be very honest, and
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:41.280]  tried to say that once yesterday, and it was as if a bomb went off.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.080]  And by the way, so for people out there, I know there are a lot of little right-wingers
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.200]  who are like 14 or 15 years old.
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:52.000]  No, hold on, hold on, and you have a blog post, you're like, oh, Mika's just saying this
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.680]  because she's a Democrat.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:59.200]  I understand you're like, you go out and you play T-ball, then you come back in, then you
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.680]  do your blog post and you have no sense of history.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:09.640]  Mika Brzezinski in 1999 and 2000, when everybody else in the Democratic Party was defending
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:15.760]  Bill Clinton, Mika has consistently said that Democrats were hypocrites.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:21.120]  She's been saying it for 17 years, all right?
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.880]  So why don't you go back and get your Juicy Juice and go back in your basement and play
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:31.800]  with your Legos, and actually read up on a little history before you start talking about
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.800]  how Mika...
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:37.400]  Well, our brains get knocked out, will we be found dead, and then the autopsy will get
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.680]  sealed by the police?
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.440]  I mean, what happens if we don't go drink our Juicy Juice?
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:45.520]  As you sit there and talk down to us like we're little kids, oh, Mika, you're so wonderful
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:46.520]  with no viewers.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:52.480]  Oh, Scarborough with your big bozo the clown, Mars Attacks haircut, he may be actually an
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:57.080]  alien and just rips that hair off, there's a big gray alien head.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.960]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save

[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:13.280]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:17.600]  We're broadcasting worldwide from the ATX, Austin, Texas.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:22.680]  I'm coming to you from the geographical heart of, I think, the greatest state in our wonderful
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:23.680]  union.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:28.240]  But no matter where you are, across the fruited plain, or Alaska, or Hawaii, or anywhere else
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.600]  in the world listening, merry, merry Christmas to everybody out there, and I hope we all
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:39.880]  have a safe and happy and successful new year.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:46.200]  We've got Dr. Jerome Corsi, our Washington, D.C. main correspondent joining us here in
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.200]  just a moment.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.120]  We've got his articles up on infowars.com and on newswars.com, and I've got to say Dr.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:58.240]  Corsi, I'm really proud of him, has been leading the way on the judge Roy Mournuz, on Google,
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:03.080]  Facebook, and Twitter, and their monopoly behavior on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac being
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:11.480]  looted for Obamacare, and on, most importantly, the DOJ being run by Hillary Stabbehinds,
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:16.200]  Hillary Clinton Foundation Stabbehinds, and now it's unraveling with a senior just department
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.320]  official who was involved in the whole FISA court situation having to step down.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:24.880]  We now know this other FBI agent who was very senior, he had to step down because he's
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:31.200]  clearly been involved just as different congressmen are starting to realize.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:36.880]  So this is a very, very exciting time to see the wheels coming off and the Democratic
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:43.040]  Party Stabbehind network that refused to leave the executive branch and that has been there
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:47.840]  trying to sabotage the recovery to see that failing, to see the Russian narrative failing.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:52.160]  Now they're saying, oh, our great proof is an email handed over with all the emails,
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:57.680]  the entire Trump Organization, of someone in September of last year, less than a month
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:03.800]  before the election, or a month or that before the election, sending us links to WikiLeaks
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.160]  with the keys to get into it.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:11.280]  We were sent that hundreds of times, everybody was, WikiLeaks was being interviewed by the
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.320]  New York Times at that time, everyone was, Fox News was having them on, they act like
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:21.280]  a, WikiLeaks is Russian, but there's no proof of that, then they act like if you talk to
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.280]  them you're evil.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:29.400]  Meanwhile, Hillary creates fake dossiers, pays $13 million for it, the FBI certifies
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.840]  it, and this is what they've got.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.840]  This is what they've got.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:38.040]  So Advocacy Group reports, Twitter death threats against FCC chair, that got linked on drugs
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:44.160]  the last few days as well, we're going to cover all of this with Dr. Corsi of infowars.com.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:50.040]  But now we have top DOJ official demoted amid probe of contacts with Trump dossier firm
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:54.480]  or met during the 2016 campaign with Christopher Steele.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.560]  And you've got all the rest of this happening.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:04.720]  So the coverup is unraveling, Hillary criminally creating fraudulent dossiers, fraudulent investigations,
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.760]  fraudulent warrants at the FISA court, then lying about the fact that warrants even existed.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:13.520]  Email shows effort to give Trump campaign WikiLeaks, that's all they're hanging their
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.520]  hat on.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:19.920]  Another Corsi article, FBI Director Ray, a deep state operative with ties to Comey.
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.680]  We're going to go over that.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:26.400]  Meanwhile, Obama appointed judge, oh yeah, it's a big judge, the judge over the Flynn
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.920]  case should have let the show with that.
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:34.560]  Not just Justice Department high level officials and the number two FBI guy on the investigation
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.640]  with the fake dossier, now off the case.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:42.360]  We now have Obama appointed judge mysteriously recuses himself from Michael Flynn case, but
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.040]  none of that's in the news.
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:48.520]  Judge also sat on FISA court during spying on Trump campaign.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:54.600]  So you've got the very judge with these fraudulent warrants, which they covered up, sitting over
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:01.880]  in judgment over Flynn, I mean, it's all Clinton operatives, 97% of Mueller's team are Democrats
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:07.600]  and give money exclusively to the Democratic Party and cheerlead for Hillary, but it gets
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.600]  worse.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:13.480]  The 3% they've never given money in her apolitical.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:18.000]  So what does that tell you, 97% they admit that.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  So Dr. Corsi, when I say the wheels have come off, this has blown up their face, Hillary's
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  in deep trouble.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.360]  I mean, I think clearly that's fair to say this is absolutely burning them alive politically
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.360]  right now.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.600]  Even mainline Democrats are having to admit that they are in deep, deep trouble.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:40.880]  You've always got the latest, and where should we start with this whole spectrum of incredible
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:41.880]  news?
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:43.040]  Well, I think you're right, Alex.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.960]  I think this is the first time, and I'm confident that the Democrats are actually scared that
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:53.040]  the whole Russia investigation is going to turn against them.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:58.920]  I mean, these are pretty remarkable revelations that we saw yesterday with Christopher Wray,
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.560]  who by the way, is another deep state operative.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:07.160]  He was part of the Enron prosecution with Wiseman and Comey, and you know, it's pretty
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:14.240]  clear that that was an operative prosecution that was largely discredited, overturned in
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:19.680]  the district, the circuit courts, and Christopher Wray was part of that operation.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:25.960]  Yesterday, he refused to answer questions about whether this fusion GPS dossier, the
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:33.640]  discredited dossier, was used to get FISA court approval to wiretap electronic surveillance
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.640]  on the Trump campaign.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:40.560]  But I think it's very clear, as Jim Jordan pointed out yesterday in the House Judiciary
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.760]  Committee, that this is at the core of the corruption.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:50.120]  And now we find out that this judge who recused himself in the Flynn prosecution, we didn't
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:56.640]  know why until we found out that he is on the FISA court, and could be perhaps the very
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:05.160]  one who gave the FBI approval to wiretap Trump and his campaign based on this lying fake
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.160]  dossier.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:11.520]  And now we've got fake indictments out of the swamp out of these kept grand juries.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.120]  And the word is Mueller's looking at an indictment, maybe even of Trump by Christmas.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:19.880]  Are they crazy enough to try to pull this off when in front of God country and the whole
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:26.600]  world naked as J-Birds, they're all one big crew engaged in massive fraud openly?
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.200]  I don't think it's going to happen.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:33.240]  I think Trump is clearly gunning to impeach Trump, I don't have any doubt about that.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:39.640]  And he's a clear operative with the long history of defending the Clintons in the Justice
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:41.720]  Department and the FBI.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.360]  But I don't think he'll do it by Christmas.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:50.480]  I think Mueller's biggest problem is that he is going to be exposed in this entire Uranium
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:56.640]  One scandal, and what you're going to find out is his entire prosecution is based on
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.720]  this fusion GPS dossier.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:06.000]  I mean, conceivably, of course, you've also got struck now Congressman Jim Jordan, others
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  are sure of it.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.880]  And of course, he was the head of the Russia operation.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.440]  So obviously he'd be the guy that did it.
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:14.960]  That he's the one that brought the fake PP dossier to the FISA court to begin with.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:17.160]  So the whole thing basically has to end.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.080]  The investigation is a total fraud at that moment.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.080]  Yeah.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:29.240]  And all the evidence that the Justice Department got through the FBI based on a FISA court order
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:36.280]  on this fraudulent fusion GPS Russia dossier, it conceivably all be thrown out of court.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.280]  And then you've got the fruit.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.360]  And they admit the dossier is a fraud to begin with.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:44.760]  So if the whole fake thing started with the fake dossier, the PP gate, and then you've
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:47.680]  got all these democratic operatives going and lying to the court to get it.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:50.160]  I mean, right there, it's a mistrial.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.160]  It's over.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:54.600]  You have to end the investigation because the whole thing was based on a lie.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:55.600]  Precisely.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:00.640]  I think even the intelligence estimate that they came out with, I said, all these intelligence
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:04.080]  agencies agree Russia intervened in the election.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:09.880]  I think that's likely based too on this fusion GPS lying Russia dossier.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:10.880]  Sure.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.160]  They now admit it wasn't 17.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.280]  It was four.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:17.080]  And it was three individuals from the four agencies who were all Clinton operatives yet
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.080]  again.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.080]  This is the funniest thing, like a plastic banana.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.080]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.080]  Let me ask you this.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.080]  Go into break.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.080]  We're going to come back.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.080]  What does Trump do?
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.760]  He doesn't usually agree with Roger back when he said fire Mueller.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.120]  But at the same time, this is hurting them more.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.120]  It's a fraud.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.960]  Even if they have the swamp indict Trump, if there's a grand jury swamp and the swamp
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:40.280]  king, Mueller indicts them, that's going to blow up in their face.
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:46.760]  I think his other idea of a special investigator, a special counsel over Mueller to make him
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.760]  recuse.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:51.400]  I think that's the way to really firing, but without doing it, you know, by the letter
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.760]  of the law, more of the spirit of the law.
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.720]  I think you're on the right track there.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:02.280]  And when we get back, I want to explain how I think if Trump allows Congress to expose
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:07.400]  all the corruption at the heart of Mueller's investigation, at the heart of the FBI, you're
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:12.400]  going to have Mueller under investigation and he'll have to resign as special prosecutor.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.520]  Well, I think that's the best strategy.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.600]  And that was my next question after we say, what does Trump do when we come back?
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:18.600]  Obviously, you have a lot of contacts.
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.200]  I don't know how much we can get into this, but I heard about this months ago.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:25.920]  Now it's admitted that the Justice Department for 11 months has been criminally investigating
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:32.480]  Hillary, Comey, all these junior people, senior people, and of course, Mueller.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:37.640]  So you're kind of foreshadowing what is already going on, the fact that was this a trap the
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.720]  whole time.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:43.160]  Some people think Mueller's this big genius and really working for Trump behind the scenes,
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:47.680]  that this was a way to set up the Clintons, or maybe that he turned over to Trump secretly.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.200]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.200]  For that.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:16:21.040]  We'll ask you that question as well.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:50.880]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:17:20.720]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:50.560]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:18:20.400]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:50.240]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:19:20.080]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:49.920]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:20:19.760]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:49.600]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:21:19.440]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:49.280]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:22:19.120]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:48.960]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:23:18.800]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:48.640]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:24:18.480]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:48.320]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:25:18.160]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:48.000]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:26:17.840]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:47.680]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:27:17.520]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:47.360]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:28:15.200]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:45.040]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:29:14.880]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:44.720]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:30:14.560]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:44.400]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:31:14.240]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:44.080]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:32:13.920]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:43.760]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:33:13.600]  We'll ask you that question as well with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:34.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, the amount of insane news, the good things happening, the bad things
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:40.760]  happening, the ugly things happening, the fantastic things happening, it is just a quickening.
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:44.920]  It is insane.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.280]  She forged the yearbook.
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:47.280]  That's huge.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:52.200]  Top DOJ official demoted to mid-probe of contacts with Trump and the dossier firm.
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:56.320]  More FBI agents being taken off the case for being Democratic operatives.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:00.920]  We have got the FBI director now, you know, caught working for the Clintons as well.
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:06.320]  The Obama appointed judge mysteriously recuses himself for Michael Flynn case, turns out
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:08.560]  they were the one involved in the FISA court.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:12.280]  This is a rigged deal and the House of Cards is coming down.
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:16.720]  They tried to impeach Trump, couldn't hardly get any votes on the House floor yesterday.
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:20.040]  We're going to play that clip coming up as well.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:22.160]  That's just some of the news.
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:27.920]  Meanwhile, jobs report crushes expectations as hurricane impact fades.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:31.800]  Meanwhile, they're just panicking though the economy is coming back.
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.920]  But I've got the big EU news here.
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:40.360]  And remember, as goes the EU show goes a lot of the world, it's globalism's last stand
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:45.760]  at the unelected private corporate system that is anti-free market, crony capitalist.
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:48.000]  They said, if Hillary loses, we're going to fall apart.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.480]  And they said, now if the euro collapses, which they predicted it would, it's over.
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:58.120]  There'll be a new chance for real global free trade, real global freedom, and Americana
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:02.520]  worldwide, not kind of a new Soviet Union meets EU bureaucrats.
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:07.480]  I've got a stack of articles here, some of them written by Ted Malik.
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.480]  Here they are.
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.480]  Pathetic.
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:17.320]  A peaser, Theresa May makes heavy concessions on money regulatory alignment to the EU.
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:21.120]  So basically a backroom deal to screw Brexit.
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.520]  Seven days of creation, Trump's first week as president.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:30.280]  That's theodore Roosevelt Malik article on worldnetdaily.com, RT, United States of Europe.
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:34.920]  Kennedy Schultz wants to consolidate EU, kick out those who disagree.
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:36.760]  They've got a new EU army.
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:42.000]  They're threatening the different Eastern European countries with 100,000 euro fines
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.160]  they don't let illegals in.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.800]  They're talking about forcibly bringing them in.
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:50.600]  So those are just some of the insane articles on newswars.com and prismplanet.com.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.960]  And again, Ted Malik's the best-selling author.
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:59.040]  But listen, studying Davos, studying Bilderberg, studying the Aspen Institute, a lot of groups
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:03.560]  that he helped found and was involved in, I remember reading about Ted Malik 25 years
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:06.920]  ago studying key people in globalist organizations.
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.800]  That doesn't mean everybody in him's bad.
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:11.960]  But about a decade ago, I started seeing him really critical of it, saying the EU's going
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:13.080]  to fall apart.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:14.320]  It's going to go down.
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.320]  It's authoritarian.
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:19.040]  And he got involved in all this to promote freedom worldwide.
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:22.520]  And now you've seen Peter Thiel do the same thing.
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:23.520]  More and more people.
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:26.920]  Sean Parker, former head of Facebook, come out and say, you know, this is authoritarian.
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.120]  We've got to stop it.
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:31.920]  So kind of the conscience of people that have been inside, I wouldn't say you were one of
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:36.600]  them because since I got to read more of your stuff a decade ago, I mean, I realized, how
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.160]  did you get in there then?
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:39.560]  Talk about yourself.
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:44.320]  Explain how a fellow like you from Canada ends up at about very highest levels on the
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:50.280]  board of directors of some of the top organizations like Davos, kind of Bilderberg public, what
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.000]  got you to the highest levels of it.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  And then what made you one of the early people to say it's going down, I mean, a real trailblazer
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.680]  predicting what we're now in the middle phases of.
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:05.200]  Well, I'm from Philadelphia, not from Canada, but I forgot, I used to live in Canada.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.880]  I did my PhD in Canada.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:07.880]  That's right.
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:11.360]  I have some canadian about me, but I'm from Canada.
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.960]  I think that you're in America and I'm just joking.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:17.800]  Academic credentials actually still have some validity in our world.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:20.600]  I've got, you know, enough of those for that, but 10 people.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.680]  So as a Canadian, yeah.
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:27.080]  So when you have those and at an early age, you start doing things and I was in the State
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:32.820]  Department when I was 28, I was running the UN in Europe when I was 35, you know, people
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:34.880]  keep giving you other opportunities.
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:35.880]  They liked your resume.
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:38.400]  They liked the way you act, the way you think.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.880]  And you know, it opens up a lot of opportunities.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:43.920]  By the way, his book that he had scribed to me is in my car.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:46.440]  Well, somebody go grab that out of my front seat of my car.
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:47.440]  Thanks.
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:48.440]  Go ahead.
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:49.440]  I want to show that.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:50.440]  You're reading it while you drive.
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:51.440]  You got at least a little.
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:54.760]  No, I already read your book, Davos, Aspen and Yale.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:57.600]  By the way, they're my office.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.280]  By the way, you're a good looking guy there on the cover.
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.080]  Well, that's a few years ago.
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:04.360]  I think that picture was taken in 1992.
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:09.080]  So some of us age better than others, but so you grew up in Philadelphia, but you go
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:12.040]  to school in Canada, come back to the US, you Yale, you name it.
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:13.720]  I mean, break down in that process.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.720]  Yeah.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:19.560]  So I actually, it's a statement about career, not ambition, blind ambition, but something
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.040]  students can learn from.
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:25.120]  If you're a good student, if you work hard, if you're thoughtful, and I had some great
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:32.720]  mentors along the way who are very conservatives in both in political philosophy and in economics,
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:38.200]  you have opportunities, you take them, you work in different places, even in the private
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:39.200]  sector.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:43.120]  In America, we go in and out of the private sector, so I've done that numerous times.
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:47.040]  And it builds up what we used to call a Rolodex, which is really a network, and people keep
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:50.080]  calling on you to do things because you can actually deliver.
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:54.320]  I was about to say, because you're not just big in academia, you've been really successful
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:57.240]  in business and also coaching corporations.
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:58.560]  I mean, I just done a lot of stuff.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:01.000]  I know I've worked with 150 companies.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:07.120]  I've worked on, I think I've been on 36 boards of both think tanks, universe.
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:10.880]  So again, what made you get into the power structure?
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:15.000]  And then once you're there, when did you start becoming that force against globalism
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  in the middle of it?
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:22.520]  Well, I think even at the beginning, I had an acumen, which largely grew out of my reading
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:28.920]  of the great books, which my father brought me up to read, and my Sunday school teachers
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:32.280]  who taught me about the history of Christianity.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:37.400]  And I always had this kind of ethical dimension so that when I saw something, I could actually
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.280]  describe it as good, bad, or indifferent.
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:41.720]  You're not Canadian, but you are a theologian then.
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:46.880]  Well, I have some degrees in theology, and I have certainly studied theology, and I am
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:50.800]  a practicing Christian, and that makes some other people certainly in the secular and
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:52.960]  in the globalist world very nervous besides.
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:54.360]  We talked about it at dinner last night.
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:57.520]  I mean, there's a lot of Luciferianism in globalism.
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:58.520]  Oh, yeah.
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:39:59.520]  Oh, yeah.
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:04.200]  So anyway, you're in the inside of this, you know, you want me to go there, do you?
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:05.200]  Yeah.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.200]  No, no, no, no.
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.200]  We're going to go there a little bit later next hour.
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:08.200]  We keep going.
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:09.200]  Sorry.
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:10.200]  Yeah.
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:12.680]  We meet a lot of people.
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:18.120]  Some of them are fine actors, and I've had the ability to be around some very fine political
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:19.120]  corporate actors.
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:24.240]  I've worked for some really fine companies, but you also see a lot of really bad stuff.
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:27.800]  And I've not been afraid to name names.
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:31.640]  And in this memoir, which I wrote largely for my kids because they asked me, what is
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:33.360]  it that you do, Dad?
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.360]  They didn't really know.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:38.240]  I've been on a lot of airplanes, and I told them the story, and that's the story.
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:42.600]  And it's an insider's story of, you know, how you can be salt and white.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:43.600]  It's a powerful book.
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:46.800]  I learned a lot from it.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:50.520]  But so you're inside the situation from the beginning.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.400]  They knew you were pro-America, pro-free market, and I guess they kind of sold globalism early
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:58.080]  on as kind of Americana worldwide.
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:01.880]  But at what point did you really start to criticize it, and why do they leave you right
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:04.480]  in the middle of it, give you were so critical of it?
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:12.160]  Well, I think this is a gradual process, you know, in the 1992-95 period, globalization
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:15.880]  and Americanization were somewhat synonymous, as you suggest.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:19.880]  And it became more and more apparent that these globalists had a very, very different agenda.
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:21.800]  It had nothing to do with America.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:26.440]  They would use America, use America funding, use American political prowess, but they really
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:27.520]  had their own agenda.
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:34.320]  And that's very evident in what I call the EU-SSR, because it is really just as I describe
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:40.920]  it, a kind of new Soviet Union, if you will, that has very, very strong globalist agenda.
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:46.120]  And it's apparent that this transatlantic relationship, which we have largely paid for
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.680]  since World War II, is built on the wrong premise.
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.000]  They've taken advantage of us.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.160]  As Trump said, you know, we were really a goat.
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.160]  They took our money.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.280]  They took our defense.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:02.760]  We've paid 80% of the costs of NATO, and we've looked the other way.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:08.200]  Germany, which is a very wealthy country, is only the engine of growth in Europe, is
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:14.240]  paying less than 2% of its annual GDP for defense, 1.32%.
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:21.280]  I mean, we're paying for German's welfare state as a result of our subsidy of NATO.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:22.280]  That's really it.
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:27.840]  Globalists have used control of the US government to parlay our wealth into all their own little
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:33.280]  adventures in the world and propping us up, and so as soon as Trump took the government's
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:37.120]  foot off our necks, suddenly things came roaring back, and all these entitled little
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:39.360]  globalists are now completely panicking.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:44.680]  So I want to talk to you about you predicted what's happened over the decade ago, and give
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:50.160]  us the bird's eye view from an insider who wasn't an insider on what's going to happen
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:51.160]  next.
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:52.160]  Ted Malik, straight ahead.
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.160]  I'll also tell you about his books.
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:54.160]  Stay with us.
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:58.840]  Not a group you developed living defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:00.600]  Why is this so good?
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:05.240]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:09.880]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:15.600]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:18.920]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:24.040]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:25.280]  going on everywhere.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.280]  These are all parasites.
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:29.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said that there's so many things that are in it.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.320]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:36.680]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:39.680]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:40.960]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:44.800]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.640]  for your body, period.

[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:03.920]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:07.200]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:11.560]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:13.400]  particles in the gut.
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:15.840]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:19.960]  Food is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:22.960]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:27.520]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:30.280]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:34.520]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:38.520]  of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:42.920]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:45.040]  can fully digest all types of meals.

[01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:00.600]  President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel this week in a move that
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:03.680]  some say will shake the Middle East to the core.
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:06.680]  Israel's neighbors are extremely displeased with Trump's announcement.
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:11.600]  The Turkish president warned Trump that recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was a red
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:16.520]  line, the Saudis are calling this a flagrant provocation of Muslims, and Palestinian leaders
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:18.480]  have already planned for protests.
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:23.840]  Terror Group Hamas is calling for a day of rage Friday, urging Palestinians in an official
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:29.080]  Arabic statement to send a message with all available means to Israel after the upcoming
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.360]  Friday prayers.
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:34.360]  Ahead of President Trump's announcement, the U.S. military deployed additional forces
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:39.440]  throughout the Middle East in anticipation of widespread political unrest and even terror
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:40.440]  attacks.
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:44.600]  While some U.S. officials had urged Trump not to make this sort of a move, U.S. policy
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:47.320]  should never be dictated by threats of violence.
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:51.640]  With the opposition against Trump's historic decision-building, the days ahead could turn
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:53.240]  out to be tumultuous.
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:56.280]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:02.880]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:08.280]  water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:09.680]  So what do we do about it?
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:13.080]  And for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:19.760]  Fight back with the all-new, supercharged Brain Force Plus and feel the rush without
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:20.760]  the crash.

[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:26.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:33.800]  That's Judy Garland, folks.
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:42.360]  Hey, beep that.
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:44.160]  The FCC is talking about banning that word.
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.160]  You know, I'm not joking.
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:47.520]  That's how this political correctness works.
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:51.520]  Joining us for the next hour and 15 minutes or so is Ted Malik.
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:54.320]  He's an academic, business guy, best-selling author.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:59.840]  He's been on the board of the Davos Group, been part of many of the top globalist organizations.
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:03.800]  But over the years promoting Americana and resisting it, and it was one of the first
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:09.320]  people inside the organizations, was it over a decade ago, saying, hey, they're going down.
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:10.320]  It's falling apart.
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:11.320]  It's authoritarian.
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:12.320]  The EU is going to go down.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.120]  America is going to come back.
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.820]  So just briefly, how were you able to predict it?
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:17.920]  What did you witness?
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:24.280]  And then tell us the next shoe to drop with Europe as people resist its unelected authoritarianism
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:30.440]  inside Europe, doubles down with an EU army, says you will accept the Islamic invasion,
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:34.240]  becomes even more pushy, repeating history.
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:38.360]  Even after they just witnessed the Brexit, it seems to only make them more arrogant.
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:44.920]  Well, the answer to the first question is, I think that you do analysis.
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:46.360]  You look at the options.
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:48.640]  You do future scenarios.
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:50.320]  You look at the trend lines.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:56.640]  And I was an early caller in this game to say that this was going to happen.
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:02.280]  And in conversations with all kinds of leaders both in the US and in Europe, we've been
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:05.360]  able to make that prediction.
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:11.160]  So I would say that in the Trump eight years of administration, and I believe it will be
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:18.420]  eight years of administration, we will see the world shift even more radically in our
[01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:19.720]  direction.
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:21.520]  America is back.
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:24.720]  That's just a huge statement in and of itself.
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:27.120]  And I think we have one person to thank for that.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:32.080]  And globalism is all about losing your nation states, losing your individual cultures.
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:33.600]  They admit that.
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:40.880]  And it's such an ugly, horrible, final revolution, it is true tyranny.
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:44.500]  I mean, it's an attack on free will.
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:45.500]  And then here comes Trump.
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:46.500]  Here comes populism.
[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:47.500]  Why now?
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:50.920]  Well, we don't eat European food.
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:53.520]  We don't speak European language.
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:57.160]  We don't homogenize everything so that there's no distinctness.
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:01.720]  I mean, the beauty of culture is its differentiation, its peculiarity.
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:05.440]  So I think we see this movement in Europe now.
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:08.360]  It's very strong in Eastern Europe.
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:10.560]  It's obviously very strong in Britain.
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:13.320]  There are elements in every single European country.
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:19.000]  I think the European elections are proving this, will prove it next year in Italy.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.560]  All these countries are moving back to their own nationhood.
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:25.480]  And there's no reason they can't all be great.
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:28.400]  I mean, greatness is infinitely wide.
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:32.880]  It doesn't mean they have to be at war competing with each other.
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:36.120]  And I think that America sets the bar, sets the bar very high on that.
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:40.560]  And a lot of people still everywhere in the world will follow what's happening in America.
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:47.840]  So the world is moving away from this new world order back to an order that has more
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:53.680]  to do with states and has to do with national localities.
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.960]  A lot of people say, I don't care about Europe, but they have to understand even the globalists
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:04.200]  themselves say, if Hillary loses, we're almost completely defeated.
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:07.240]  And then the European Union will fall next.
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:08.240]  Why is that a good thing?
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:09.240]  Well, it's unelected.
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:10.240]  It's authoritarian.
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:15.800]  It's stuck in under trade deals just like Naftan and Gatt and TPP, and it's about self-determination.
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:22.120]  We're being conquered by this global cabal, and its main, final command base is the European
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:24.480]  Union and the United Nations.
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:29.320]  And so, I mean, this is really the battle of the 21st century for freedom.
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:32.080]  This is the battle of these decades.
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:38.320]  I think we've actually surprised them because we're starting to take back territory in
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:39.320]  a sense.
[01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:44.680]  I mean, the way I put it is, with Trump, we're no longer on the defensive.
[01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:46.200]  We're on the offensive.
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:50.960]  And everything he does, weekend, actually, day in, day out, that's what's so amazing
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:51.960]  about it.
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:57.800]  It's not just, you know, occurring here and there willy-nilly once in a while.
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:00.600]  Every day something is happening on Trump's watch.
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:05.920]  Israel this week, you know, Jerusalem, Middle East, Russia, you know.
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:10.720]  Another secured economy coming back, and it's the perfect timing of how he waited and did
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:16.160]  all this, and then just right at the right time as the stars aligned, historically, boom,
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:17.400]  it's biblical.
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:18.400]  It is.
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:22.760]  So I wrote an article some months ago, actually, time of the election, saying with Trump's
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:26.520]  election it'll be like the first seven days of creation.
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:31.560]  And I meant that not literally, but metaphorically, and the fact is almost everything that I laid
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:36.000]  out in that article has happened already, and we've only witnessed the first year of
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.680]  Donald J. Trump.
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:42.240]  Let's talk about the first seven days of Trump's creation, in fact, I've got the article
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:43.240]  right there.
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:44.240]  Let's go back over that.
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:45.920]  Because you predicted it a year ago.
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:47.520]  Here we are a year later.
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:48.520]  It's a checklist.
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:50.000]  It's quite amazing.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  What will he do?
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:54.840]  Immediately, and all of Obama's executive orders, done.
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:56.560]  He'll try to stop Obamacare.
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:57.960]  He wanted to do it.
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:01.040]  It's the damn U.S. Senate that stopped him from doing it.
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:04.720]  And he'll, as I said here, cut off the head of the snake called ISIS.
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:05.720]  Done.
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:06.720]  You go down this list.
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:07.720]  It's now defeated.
[01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:08.720]  This checklist of some third...
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:10.320]  The Russians declared two days ago they're defeated.
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:11.320]  Yeah.
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:12.320]  They're defeated.
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:15.400]  But this list, there are maybe two or three things he still has to do.
[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:16.400]  So it's...
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:17.400]  He hasn't yet built the wall.
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:18.400]  I said that the...
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:22.200]  By the way, CNN, it wrote articles yesterday saying, Trump's keeping his promise, promise
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:25.920]  keeper, and showed how he's done at least half or more of everything he said.
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:27.400]  And they were saying that was a bad thing.
[01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:32.400]  Oh, yeah, they believe it's a bad thing because they're in the business of media malpractice.
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:33.400]  I mean, that's...
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:34.400]  That's a term you've coined.
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:37.720]  It's a term I've coined, and I wanted you to use it, so I'm glad you're using it.
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:43.240]  But the fact is, CNN and other networks, but now it's all those networks, it's all the
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:47.800]  Main Street networks, are basically just anti-Trump networks.
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:48.920]  And people are turning it off.
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:50.360]  It's just like the NFL games.
[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:51.360]  People have stopped going...
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:52.360]  And that's my question.
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:57.800]  The NFL has lost like 35% just this last year and a half, 50% total, the last three years
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:59.240]  being political, and they don't care.
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:00.560]  They can't stop.
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:02.440]  It's just they're killing themselves.
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:03.880]  Well, they're going to go out of business.
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:05.680]  They're going to have a going out of business self.
[01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:09.040]  That's what they intend to do, then put the guy back in charge, and they seem to have
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:10.040]  done that.
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:12.640]  Don't they get that even if they kill Trump, that would make him a martyr that they're
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:13.640]  going to lose?
[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:18.360]  Well, I don't even like to have that thought, and I pray that he has security every night.
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:21.320]  But the fact is, Trump is doing all the stuff on this list.
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:26.440]  This was my wish list of everything could happen in the best biblical account.
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:30.600]  And he's done like 90% of the stuff.
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:33.680]  Now he's got to put more good people, I think, into the administration.
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:37.000]  He's been successful with executive action because the globalists have put so much power
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.360]  in the executive to circumvent the people.
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:43.400]  But he, again, their strength, he made it their weakness.
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:48.440]  And now OTPP, boom, nafta ga, renegotiate it, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:52.920]  One after the other, these are things that people said he could not do.
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:57.720]  His advisers even said, well, maybe you should think about doing that twice, or how could
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:01.080]  you defund this part of the United Nations?
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:06.000]  How could you allow the Israelis to have a capital in Jerusalem?
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.280]  We're just fulfilling these promises, and it's an incredible-
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:12.560]  Yeah, 30 years ago they passed a law to do this, and all the other presidents have agreed
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:13.560]  to it.
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:16.000]  And then Trump goes, oh, you're going to blow us up if they have a capital?
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.280]  Well, you know, we can't live in fear.
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:23.400]  Well, the next thing that happens, I'll predict it right here, is he'll solve the North Korean
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:28.240]  dilemma, which is really adamantly sword hanging over our head.
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:32.480]  And the way he'll do that, and he's already, and I know you hear some of his advisers like
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:37.400]  Madison McMaster's talking for him, the way he'll do that is escalate the rhetoric, which
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:38.400]  he's done.
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:41.240]  He's going to enforce a complete sanction.
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:46.560]  He's actually going to, I think, put an embargo on North Korea.
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:55.360]  He will then use EMP weapons in order to change the entire scenario, and we will see the end
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:58.360]  of that regime in North Korea.
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:02.560]  Are you saying he'll move EMP weapons in to make them super peace, or he'll hit them
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:03.560]  with EMP?
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:05.080]  I think he'll hit them.
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:08.680]  Well, they're moving the troops there by the end.
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:12.200]  They don't, the word, our military sources say they haven't told we're going to hit North
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:13.200]  Korea.
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:14.200]  Why?
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:18.960]  Because, listen to the national security advisor, he said the chances of that are increasing.
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:21.840]  He said the other day, day by day.
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:27.600]  So knowing all the establishment elite speak, you're saying this is serious.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:32.000]  It's going to happen, and I'll predict it's going to happen in the next six months of
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.760]  the year 2018.
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:36.680]  Kim Jong-un better get his act together, boy.
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:37.800]  I tell you, this is crazy.
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:43.400]  I pray for peace, and we're going to go to break and come back, and I want to get into
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:46.520]  what you want to talk about, about the world, where we are, what's happening from your

[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:54.040]  By the way, folks, don't do your Christmas shopping with the biggest establishment stores

[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:59.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:07.040]  From the front lines of the InfoNation War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:08.560]  Ted Malik.com's the website.
[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:13.120]  Ted Malik, great American patriot, born and raised in Philadelphia, studied all over the
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:18.280]  place with the Yale College up in Canada as well, got into the top heights of the globalist
[02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:23.240]  operation and has been fighting for Americana ever since, and has been heralding and basically
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:30.920]  portending, that is predicting with accuracy now, the fall of the New World Order.
[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:34.760]  Incredible ladies and gentlemen, absolutely incredible.
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:40.240]  We have some very exciting news that one of the main operatives of the globalists that
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:45.840]  has been causing incredible problems, stacking the Trump operation with globalists, I'm gonna
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:48.400]  let you go ahead, my friend, and announce what just broke.
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:50.600]  Well, this is very good news to see this headline.
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:56.880]  Dana Powell, the deputy national security advisor, is to depart the Trump White House.
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:00.200]  This is one of the leading globalists in the White House.
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:03.280]  She shouldn't have been there in the first place, so it's very good news to hear that
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:04.880]  she is leaving.
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:09.240]  I hope she takes with her a bunch of other people and some of the deep state.
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:14.160]  Of course, that's the problem because in the U.S. government, whether it's the Department
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:17.760]  of State, the Department of Justice, the National Security Council, you go down the
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:24.160]  list, these deep state operatives are embedded, many of them go back decades, and certainly
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:27.600]  many of them are very attached to the Obama ideology.
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:30.760]  So this is really, I mean, this doesn't surprise me.
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:34.480]  It's very good news, and I think Gary Cohn, I'll make a prediction, will be the next one
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:35.480]  to go.
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:40.400]  In fact, we were talking earlier, I don't know if this can even be said yet, but little
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:45.760]  birdies have told you, Gary Cohn, formerly Goldman Sachs, that's been caught badmouthing
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:48.320]  the president quite a bit, and undermining him.
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:49.320]  You've heard him.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:50.320]  He's going to be gone.
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:53.560]  I think that's, I mean, it's an easy prediction to make.
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:57.140]  The other prediction, of course, that's out is that the Secretary of State, who's really
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:02:01.520]  not operating as Secretary of State, he's probably the weakest Secretary of State the
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:07.280]  country's ever had, will be gone in February once his stock situation clears, so he can
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:12.440]  have his tax-free, you know, tax status as a result of serving in the U.S. government
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:15.400]  for a year and will have a new Secretary of State.
[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:21.440]  These are big changes on the national security and on the international front, and hopefully
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:26.280]  Trump will make the decision, and I think there's a clear indication, to pick people
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:30.400]  this time that are more closely aligned with his worldview.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:31.400]  Wow.
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:36.360]  Dina Powell out, this is huge breaking news, and again, I don't do this to toot my horn,
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:40.480]  but I came on there today, and I said, exclusive email shows effort to give Trump campaign
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:44.560]  WikiLeaks documents, and I said, this was in September.
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:49.440]  We had these a month and a half before with the key, everybody had the keys, the keys
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:54.120]  were given out, exclusive email shows effort to give Trump campaign WikiLeaks documents.
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:59.640]  I said this morning, this is pure poppycock, now even the Washington Post has to admit,
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:04.720]  email pointed Trump campaign to WikiLeaks documents that were already public, so somebody
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:11.320]  sent the campaign an email with public WikiLeaks a month and a half after they're out, and
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:12.320]  that's the Russian collusion.
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:17.160]  I mean, they haven't even proven WikiLeaks is Russian, now getting public WikiLeaks
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:20.840]  a month and a half later is the proof, top story on CNN this morning.
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:27.640]  Well, in the case of Russiagate, we have a situation where Vesel Kaniyia, the Russian
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:33.480]  lawyer who was meeting in Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort and Jared
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:40.880]  Kushner, was meeting the hour before with GPS Fusion and meeting the hour after with
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:46.360]  GPS Fusion, which is all tied back into the original steel dossier.
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:53.320]  And that's all the fake made up perjury, false affidavit, that's, instead of them making
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:58.080]  an original false affidavit, they had no witnesses, they just made up fiction, had that brought
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:01.560]  in by the FBI certified, and then given to the court.
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:07.400]  Absolutely, and this dossier is really the nub of the whole thing, and I've been doing
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:08.400]  research on it.
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:12.320]  You know, I live in London, and I've been able to crack into MI6 and into some other
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:17.920]  people who can tell me the real truth on how this document was created, who created it,
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:25.240]  what his view is, how he is a globalist himself, actually a Fabian socialist, and what is behind
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:26.320]  that dossier.
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:30.280]  That's a very, very fucking story.
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:35.480]  Ted Malik, folks, J-Vos Group, Board, Aspen Institute, didn't you found a bunch of some
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:36.480]  of these too?
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:38.880]  Well, Fabio on Tuesday and Thursday.
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:42.800]  What was your involvement with Aspen, did you found that?
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:45.600]  No, no, Aspen actually was a great organization.
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:46.800]  Did you used to head it up though?
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:50.800]  I was the head of all national seminars and custom programs.
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:52.600]  See, I just go off memory.
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:55.120]  We'll be back.

[02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:30.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ted Malek, one of the board members of the Davos Group, former head
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:35.640]  of the Aspen Institute, you name it, is in studio and let me tell you he's got amazing
[02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:40.880]  sources in our government, in other governments, he lives in London, he was telling me a lot
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:45.760]  of stuff MI6 told him at dinner last night, I didn't know we could get into that but he's
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:48.240]  willing to get into it right now.
[02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:53.280]  But here's the big breaking news, Dina Powell, deputy national security advisor, one of the
[02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:59.920]  key baddies that brought in all these bad globalists, leftist and also neocons, to depart
[02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:00.920]  Trump White House.
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:01.920]  That's the Washington Post.
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:05.920]  And I got to give the Washington Post, actually a little bit of credit, Jeff Bezos' Washington
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:10.200]  Post, maybe they realize that they're about to lose so they're going to back off because
[02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:12.560]  they've been the worst so far.
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:17.720]  Powell pointed Trump campaign to WikiLeaks documents that were already public.
[02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:24.240]  So now CNN has a top story today that it's over for Trump, that they had WikiLeaks,
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:28.760]  that WikiLeaks sent them an email, well no, a citizen sent them an email to public stuff
[02:07:28.760 --> 02:07:33.920]  on 4chan and info wars and you name it, with public WikiLeaks that were a month and a
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:34.920]  half old.
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:38.560]  I mean, this is like saying Donald Trump read the Washington Post, I mean, or the New York
[02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:39.560]  Times.
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:44.440]  But again, they just act like all of this is some big giant evil and they've caught
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:48.560]  them in something bad that if you ever read a WikiLeak, you're a Russian agent, even though
[02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:50.240]  WikiLeaks is not Russian.
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:54.360]  And even though CNN would beg to have Julian Assange on or get the next WikiLeaks.
[02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:58.520]  So this is just absolutely beyond a nothing burger.
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:04.920]  So Ted Malin, let's get your take on this and then get in to MI6 and the PP gate dossier
[02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:10.440]  today and Mr. Steele and Mr. Strock and the judge recusing themselves over Flynn.
[02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:15.320]  I mean, this thing is collapsing like a landslide right now.
[02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:18.760]  Well, it's collapsed right in front of us.
[02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:22.520]  I think the facts are clear.
[02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:27.160]  This is media malpractice is what we have to call, we should have a class action suit.
[02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:33.280]  All Americans should join it and say we're not watching these fake news outlets any longer.
[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:38.600]  I mean, when I go on CNN and Christine Ammonpour or any one of those other people tries to
[02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:46.720]  interrogate you, it's all about assassinating your ideas and trying to do in President Trump.
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:50.960]  So there's nothing objective about any they've got a mission.
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:53.120]  They tailor all info to fit that B ish.
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:59.400]  They are on the mission and they have actually made a dent in that mission, but now the
[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:04.880]  screws are coming out and it's absolutely clear what they're up to.
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:10.880]  And I think people can read it for themselves and thanks to alternate news sources and people
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:17.400]  that can get out the truth and that includes info wars amongst others were able to assess
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:20.080]  a truer, clearer, more comprehensive picture.
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:21.080]  And let's be clear.
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:25.320]  You said thanks to one man and thanks to God for giving us him, but thanks to you and
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:29.960]  in Matt Drudge and in Breitbart and countless others a world that daily over the decades
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:34.480]  exposing what's going on and the people number one and being involved.
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:37.040]  It created a climate for this to happen.
[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:43.000]  And now that the wheels are coming off as this becomes discredited, it's going to supercharge
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  everything we're doing.
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:49.080]  But without Trump's stalwart focus, without his commitment, without his courage, without
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:54.120]  his family being willing to bust their asses and go through all this, we would not be here
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:56.400]  without that leadership.
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:09:57.400]  This wouldn't have all come together.
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:03.200]  But I'm telling you, it is a perfect storm against globalism, but let's not start celebrating
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:04.200]  too much yet.
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:07.760]  I want to get into how you think they're going to counter strike, Mr. Malik, but let's get
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:08.760]  back to my six.
[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:10.720]  What did my six tell you about the fake dossier?
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:15.440]  Well, I've talked to a lot of people not to disclose names or sources, but people told
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:17.600]  me over a year ago.
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:18.600]  You were in the news.
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:19.600]  You said it.
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:20.960]  I went on BBC and said it and they couldn't believe it.
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:25.400]  So I said, this dossier is a fake dossier, this dossier was produced.
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:26.400]  You said it first.
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:33.000]  My six agent, this dossier was paid for originally by somebody who was an opponent.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:37.840]  I couldn't say who, but now we can say who and which campaign that was trying to defeat
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:45.480]  Donald Trump in the Republican primary, the contract which was paid for in kind of doses.
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:48.960]  The more that steel produced, the more he got paid.
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:53.640]  So therefore he used his Russian sources to give him more and more disinformation.
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:11:00.120]  And the Democrats took over that contract and the firm that ran him was GPS fusion.
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:03.920]  By the way, we should have opened the show up with you with that clip from a year ago.
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:10.720]  If you just type in Ted Malik, MI6 told me that the dossier was fake.
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:14.600]  If people will pull that clip, we'll have it for the next segment because a year later
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:15.920]  you've been proven completely right.
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:21.160]  So get into more specifics as they were interrupting you on the show of what the MI6 sources told
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:22.160]  you.
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:30.120]  Well, they basically corroborated this notion that there was one of their former agents who
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:38.440]  has now become a private sector kind of business intelligence guru who was paid for to manufacture
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:40.760]  this dossier.
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:46.640]  And he basically gave that information both to MI6 and to the FBI.
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:52.440]  He was known to the FBI already because he had researched prior to that the FIFA kinds
[02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:54.120]  of controversies.
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:57.600]  And they actually paid him at some point in time.
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:02.640]  He was one of their assets and they use that dossier is the key piece.
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:05.600]  They use that dossier to go after Trump.
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:08.280]  They've used that dossier to get the FISA warrants.
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:11.640]  They've used that dossier to go after Mike Flynn.
[02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:17.240]  That is the linchpin and it is pure bull.
[02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:25.800]  Even in an interview more recently, Steele said himself, well, 70 or 80 percent of it
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:27.880]  is probably true.
[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:29.760]  Which 70 or 80 percent?
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:35.160]  Well, we all know Trump's a complete neat freak and would never have women peeing on
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:36.160]  him.
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:42.400]  Well, that golden shower story is, I mean, I can't wait to see the movie version.
[02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:46.560]  Well, it's just crazy because people that know Trump, not people who know him like
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:52.560]  45 years on this rock stone, he's a one woman guy and he's a neat freak and he just is
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:54.280]  real picky about women.
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:13:01.000]  So he's certainly not having sex with random hookers.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.920]  The dossier, it's 35 pages long.
[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:06.680]  You can read it, I mean, obviously you can get it and read it.
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:07.680]  What about BuzzFeed?
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:09.080]  Aren't they getting sued for that too?
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:15.360]  Yeah, but it reads like some kind of really, really strange novel.
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:19.560]  Not as something that the intelligence community would take seriously.
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:22.360]  I mean, you think that they try to corroborate it.
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:27.320]  If you had 17 intelligence agencies, which we have, that they would get such a document
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:28.320]  if they couldn't.
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:30.880]  No, they got ordered by Deep State and Hillary to go with it and they ran it up like God
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:31.880]  said it.
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:32.880]  Exactly what they did.
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:36.680]  They verified a single thing in the dossier.
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:37.680]  And now we've built this whole.
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:44.160]  And now they've backed off and went, we actually didn't vet it and we didn't say that.
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:45.320]  So what happens next?
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:50.680]  I mean, because this is another good sign that you're saying the Goldman Sachs guy's
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:51.680]  leaving.
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:54.480]  We've also got Dina Powell announcing she's leaving.
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:56.720]  This is just more positive Christmas presents.
[02:13:56.720 --> 02:13:59.280]  Well, you've got the Christmas shot there.
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:00.280]  It's actually very pretty.
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:04.560]  I was in Washington just earlier in the week, I saw it live up close and personal.
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:05.560]  It's beautiful.
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:09.880]  And actually this year, for the first time in probably two decades, we're able to say
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:11.120]  Merry Christmas.
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:12.120]  Absolutely.
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:15.560]  And in all fairness, it looks like the U.S. Capitol because it's even taller.
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:16.560]  It's not as big.
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:17.560]  That's the Texas Capitol.
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:18.560]  Oh, okay.
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:22.640]  No, but it's got a goddess on top and it's built just the same.
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:24.320]  So I mean, I can see how you missed it there.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:27.040]  Did you see the angel ornament that came out this year?
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:28.720]  I'm sure you're buying them for everybody.
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:29.960]  The demon ornament?
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:31.960]  The ornament for the top of your tree.
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:32.960]  Little baby Satan?
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:35.960]  Well, in this case, it was Hillary Clinton herself.
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:41.960]  Oh, I thought it was a demon, but yeah, isn't that hilarious?
[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:45.680]  In fact, I got to ask you, there it is.
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:47.960]  And she even looks like a vampire in the shot.
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:50.440]  Well, she's wearing a pantsuit.
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:51.440]  Let's give her credit.
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:55.080]  You know, though, I mean, I heard on September 11th, though, if you leave the tree up, that
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:57.080]  the angel falls off the tree.
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:14:58.080]  Oh, my.
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:02.960]  I heard the little, did you hear the angel comes a little black ambulance?
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:08.600]  Oh, but then you got to be careful because, like, if you leave the angel on your house
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:11.600]  and there's a piggy bank or something, the money will be gone in the morning, just like
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:12.800]  the Haitian refugee money.
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:16.840]  Well, I called the Clintons the greatest kleptocracy in American history.
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:19.120]  So that's the next shoe to drop.
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:22.000]  We're talking about things are going to drop early in the next year.
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:27.880]  There'll be a special council to look into all the wrongdoings of the Clintons, the Clinton
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:35.440]  Foundation, of their, you know, scariest deals, and that will all be exposed, including the
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:36.440]  Deep State.
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:42.120]  Chad Malik, former Davos board member group, head of the Aspen Institute, you name it.
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:45.480]  And we're going to give the number out to and take phone calls, but a lot of big stuff
[02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:46.480]  is breaking.
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:47.480]  We're covering it all.

[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:25.640]  healthier I feel.

[02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:54.720]  Yeah!
[02:19:54.720 --> 02:20:14.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:50.720]  So, Ted Malik, how popular were you being a board member of the Davos group?
[02:20:50.720 --> 02:20:57.720]  You know, over the years saying that the EU is the USSR and needs to fall apart and now we're starting to see that happen.
[02:20:57.720 --> 02:21:00.720]  I mean, what was it like when you were amongst those people saying that?
[02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:08.720]  Well, I wasn't saying it, frankly, when I was inside some of those organizations, but the further I got away from them, the more it became apparent to me.
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:16.720]  So, therefore, I came into the media and said those things, wrote articles about it, have written books about it, have given long lectures about it.
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:29.720]  So, some of your former friends, you know, don't return your phone calls or probably have crossed you off their, you know, their best friend list on Facebook taking you out of their category of friendship.
[02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:32.720]  But, you know, so what?
[02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:35.720]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:46.720]  What are the globalists going to do? Because, again, they're mainly corporate groups that use government contracts and monopolies to expand power at the expense of everybody else and seek to create unified authoritarian monopolies.
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:51.720]  That's how I would describe their authoritarian command and control model.
[02:21:51.720 --> 02:22:00.720]  And they describe it as the technocracy that basically is doing the same thing and they have fantasized about tech gods and population reduction and the rest of it.
[02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:06.720]  So, it's just classic delusional behavior of these mega-billionaires, but they're not going to go away.
[02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:14.720]  How are they going to reconstitute as more free market systems get brought back, as they're not just give them monopolies? How are they going to strike back?
[02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:19.720]  Well, it is correct. They're not going away. They're not going to give up.
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:33.720]  They're still, you know, key players in the world and their headquarters, in effect, is Brussels. So, you're going to see more and more activity, whether it's Soros funded or EU funded coming out of Western Europe.
[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:46.720]  And they're going to try to use the international organizations, whether it's the, you know, the Paris climate change accord or whether it's some UN body on migration or some millennial goals.
[02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:52.720]  They will use those same organizations, but if they're defunded and delegitimize, it's going to be harder to use them.
[02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:59.720]  They have less credibility and the US is basically bailing on all those institutions, thanks to Donald Trump.
[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:08.720]  He hasn't even appointed yet an ambassador to the European Union. What does that say?
[02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:18.720]  It just shows how he's being blocked, trying to put good people in the government, and there's this attempt to just stay in power and hold everything off just long enough to bring globalism back.
[02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:26.720]  But again, Trump's just a figurehead. Even if they could get rid of him, don't they understand the tides turned against him? What does Peter Thiel get that they don't get?
[02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:33.720]  Well, I mean, Peter Thiel made this statement about globalism or globalization, which are not the same things.
[02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:43.720]  It's going on the upside. It's going out. Now, you know, sometimes tides come back in, so we have to be ready and willing and able to challenge them on the return tide.
[02:23:43.720 --> 02:23:53.720]  But this is an ongoing battle. This is, this is something that's going to last our lifetimes. It's, it's not a short term episode, so we have to be prepared to do that.
[02:23:53.720 --> 02:23:55.720]  By the way, I did find the video.
[02:23:55.720 --> 02:23:56.720]  It's right there.
[02:23:56.720 --> 02:24:01.720]  Yeah, it's John McCain passes dossier to make Trump look bad. You're at 205 on the video.
[02:24:01.720 --> 02:24:10.720]  We're going to get that. We're going to get your BBC one, too, where you talked about all that because I just, I got to have this OCD thing now where if I want a clip, I've got to have it or I go crazy.
[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:17.720]  But this is insane. All this stuff is happening. So much good things are happening. I've been upset about the Russian thing because they've said I'm a Russian agent with dope roof.
[02:24:17.720 --> 02:24:23.720]  They've had congressional hearings. You've seen them three or four of them where they say, don't worry, we're censoring him. He's a Russian agent.
[02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:29.720]  That's very evil, folks. That's very corrupt. They told Rand Paul, hey, you're a Russian agent on the floor of the Senate, John McCain.
[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:36.720]  It's being a John McCain. They've said, whenever Tucker Carlson says there's no proof, they go, oh, there you are working for Putin.
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:42.720]  But I mean, Putin is bringing sovereignty back to Russia. He is trying to get him to have children again. He is trying to reform.
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:55.720]  I'm not saying he's perfect, but, you know, it is true that he is trying to be a man in a world where men were told are bad by these mega technocrats that don't want any leaders there to stand up against their global takeover.
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:02.720]  He is a bunch of evil men with billions of dollars apiece using psychology and sociology to break down society.
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:10.720]  I went on Russian television, RT television a couple times. We had very good studios, very good broadcasters. They didn't tell me what I had to say.
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:19.720]  I said exactly what I wanted to say. The first thing I said, I want to make it absolutely clear, I had no Russian salad dressing on my salad at lunch.
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:27.720]  But we had a very, you know, kind of good conversation. And I don't think we should be Russophiles or Russian folks.
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:31.720]  We should learn to find a way to deal with Russia into the future.
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:37.720]  Pragmatically, and it's not the old Soviet Union. The EU, like you said, they're the ones that behave like the Soviet Union.
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:38.720]  You got it.
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:54.720]  The toll-free number to join us, ladies and gentlemen, is 877-789. Alex, 877-789-2539. And it's specifically questions for Ted Malik about globalism, the Davos Group, the New World Order, Donald Trump, where he sees all this going.
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:26:00.720]  I want to get into George Soros and the funding that's left for the Democrats and the globalists, because the Saudis are not funding them now.
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:11.720]  They had that weird thing you said like Bono last week, had that fundraiser with Obama. They have all been, oh, he has the 1% group, and then they give 1% to charity.
[02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:20.720]  So their big global swindles are coming to an end, and we're going to talk about where they're going to get their money.
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:30.720]  Well, you still have some very rich people who are throwing money in the wrong direction. And I do like and have been on the boards of many big foundations.
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:41.720]  In the first generation, they do a lot of good. In the second generation, they deviate slightly. By the third generation, some of these places become nothing like what they were intended to be in the first instance.
[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:52.720]  And the founders, who have, of course, long dead now, would say, what are you doing with this money that I left in this charitable organization? And we can go down the list. It happens almost every time.
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:27:04.720]  Most of the modern leftist stuff is like deviance and just defacing beautiful art, destroying families, attacking manhood, attacking true feminist prowess.
[02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:08.720]  I mean, why are they attacking strength and beauty?
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:21.720]  Well, because they are total relativists and they don't have any understanding of what truth is. Objectively, how one deals rationally with the world, and they have this very nihilistic view.
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:24.720]  So this is becoming more and more. I mean, when you think about our education...
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:25.720]  They're evil.
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:37.720]  I have been in the university. This is what is prevailing in the university. So they're a reflection of that part of our culture. I would say that's an even longer term battle taking back the culture.
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:45.720]  I was about to say, if we could just get our sovereignty back, it doesn't mean we're going to be perfect, but at least we've got a system that isn't out to destroy everybody. There's some social contract left.
[02:27:45.720 --> 02:28:00.720]  But the big fight is the screen sickness, the TVs, the media, the culture, the breakup of the family. Even though we defeat the globalist minions, their fourth generation, the problem is it's like a perpetual motion machine. The juggernaut still rolls on.
[02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:15.720]  And these globalists are radically against the family. I mean, you see everything that they do to eradicate the family. I wrote an article a few months ago. I think it was in Breitbart. It appeared about the tragedy of the European family.
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:24.720]  There are now 17 leaders of European countries and the EU who have no children. What does that tell you?
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:37.720]  Let's talk about that with Ted Malick, the guy that's been on the board of the Davos Group, head of the Aspen Institute, doesn't get any more elite than that. And here he is telling you everything. I want to get into sorrows, take phone calls, the attack on the family, why the EU heads don't have children.
[02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:53.720]  What is this cult? And I want to get into the Luciferianism. We were having some discussions last night about that. I don't want to. I mean, just the mindset, the spirit, the ghost in the globalist machine. What is its end game? What is its operating system? I'm Alex Jones.
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:58.720]  Have you ever lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?

[02:32:55.720 --> 02:33:05.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:05.720 --> 02:33:09.720]  If it's not fake news, and we don't know, and we don't know.
[02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:12.720]  Let me tell you what the British intelligence told me this morning.
[02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:16.720]  This person, who they know, who was an MIS.
[02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:17.720]  This is Mr. Steele.
[02:33:17.720 --> 02:33:18.720]  It is Christopher Steele.
[02:33:18.720 --> 02:33:31.720]  It was also an FBI asset at one point in time, so he has intelligence background, but he was paid by the people that you've mentioned who were working for Jeb Bush in order to discredit him.
[02:33:31.720 --> 02:33:33.720]  The Democrats took over the contract.
[02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:43.720]  As you said, he kept adding to the dossier and using information given to him by the FSB in Russia, most of it fabricated.
[02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:46.720]  The more he put into the dossier, the more he got paid.
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:54.720]  So he made a sensationalist dossier as fat as possible, just like your lawyer charges you more billable hours in order to get paid more.
[02:33:54.720 --> 02:33:56.720]  You said most of it fabricated.
[02:33:56.720 --> 02:33:57.720]  What about it wasn't fabricated?
[02:33:57.720 --> 02:33:59.720]  I don't know what's fabricated and what's not.
[02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:03.720]  So you don't know if most of it fabricated.
[02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:07.720]  Well, I mean, the stuff that we've read, the salacious stuff that we've read.
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:08.720]  So some of it might be true.
[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:12.720]  Well, it is true that Mr. Trump was in Moscow.
[02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:16.720]  So that's Ted Malik, who's in studio with us right now.
[02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:20.720]  That was right after Trump was elected in the middle of November last year.
[02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:29.720]  We were talking 13 months ago and we're talking bombshell because now the author of the PPGate fiction piece has now admitted that.
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:32.720]  Oh, well, some of it's true, but most of it's not.
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:34.720]  So this is absolutely massive.
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:38.720]  Now that we know the FBI took it knew it was a fraud, got fake warrants.
[02:34:38.720 --> 02:34:44.720]  This this is just simply incredible.
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:52.720]  And this is the cornerstone of the whole case against the presidency of Donald Trump.
[02:34:52.720 --> 02:34:55.720]  And it's it's just a blatant lie.
[02:34:55.720 --> 02:34:58.720]  It's a fiction and we've run with it.
[02:34:58.720 --> 02:34:59.720]  The media has run with it.
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:00.720]  The left has run with it.
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:03.720]  All these NGOs run with it.
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:06.720]  It just has to be exposed for what it is.
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:13.720]  By the way, you talked about at dinner last night how important it was that Dean Powell and these other globals be removed because she's the one bringing in all these.
[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:15.720]  Obama people and others.
[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:17.720]  She's now stepping down.
[02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:19.720]  That's been reported by the Washington Post today.
[02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:23.720]  But we also talked about.
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:29.720]  Soros and the and the and the funding that the Saudis being taken out.
[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:31.720]  The arm that's been funding the Democrats.
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:42.720]  And these particular princes that that's another reason the Democrats are in so much crisis is their black money, their secret money that they pay for fake dossiers and things is drying up.
[02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:44.720]  Well, I believe it to be the case.
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:54.720]  So they were highly dependent on on both certain left wing billionaires who, you know, find some new faith on the left.
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:36:01.720]  I guess after they've made their money, which is an irony in and of itself, or foreign governments.
[02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:11.720]  You know, in the case of Turkey, the guliness have funded certainly lots of congressional campaigns on the Democrat side, given $14 million to the Clinton Foundation.
[02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:14.720]  I really want to repeat this.
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:17.720]  Charles Altel, of course, is the great analyst on that foundation.
[02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:20.720]  You should look at his website and what he writes about.
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:34.720]  But that is really the cesspool of the whole whole operation on the left and how much money has basically flowed through that one organization and what they've been able to do with it.
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:44.720]  And Newt Gennrich makes really good points when he says they thought Hillary was going to be in office, they were just wildly taking billions of dollars from a whole bunch of countries.
[02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:45.720]  It wasn't a rushing conspiracy.
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:47.720]  I'm on a Russo file as you're saying or you're not either.
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:51.720]  Just the facts, the Communist Chinese, the EU, all these foreign companies.
[02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:53.720]  I mean, it was a clearinghouse.
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:57.720]  She had the server as a drop box, knowing they were all on it, grabbing it.
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:36:58.720]  They'd give her money.
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:00.720]  She'd put the stuff on the server.
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:02.720]  That's what my FBI sources tell me.
[02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:03.720]  And now that's coming out.
[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:04.720]  The nakedness.
[02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:06.720]  But I guess if you're going to steal, steal big.
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:08.720]  Well, they certainly stole big.
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:09.720]  I made a list.
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:12.720]  I actually wrote an article on the greatest kleptocracies in the history of the world.
[02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:14.720]  And I listed 13 of them.
[02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:16.720]  And I think the Clintons are on the top three.
[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:19.720]  So it's really what they achieved was really unprecedented.
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:30.720]  I mean, not just taking $500,000 here or there for a speech or her case, $600,000 for three speeches, telling people how much she loves and is one of Goldman Sachs.
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:36.720]  But taking $145 million to do a deal to sell uranium to the Russians.
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:37.720]  I mean, it's just just.
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:41.720]  And then have the nerve to claim anybody that loves America is a Russian agent when you're on the payroll.
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:43.720]  Oh, I mean, much more the case.
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:47.720]  Well, every time I've talked to President Trump, I just warn him.
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:49.720]  I say, listen, they're going to never going to back down.
[02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:50.720]  They're never going to give up.
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:51.720]  They're going to keep coming after you.
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:52.720]  You've got to go after them.
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:55.720]  And I mean, obviously, Trump doesn't need my advice on that front.
[02:37:55.720 --> 02:37:56.720]  But here's the deal.
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:37:58.720]  We're not being vengeful about the Clintons and these people.
[02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:00.720]  But they need to go to prison.
[02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:03.720]  I mean, they need to pay so other people learn.
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:05.720]  You don't get away with this crap.
[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:08.720]  The fear of God needs to be in these people.
[02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:10.720]  Well, we are a country of law.
[02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:15.720]  So, you know, we shouldn't have people that are outside or above the law, regardless of political office.
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:18.720]  So there should, there should have been already.
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:27.720]  I mean, I really can't believe that there isn't a special prosecutor or a special counsel to look into all these evils and sins of the past administration where there
[02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:35.720]  was meetings on the tarmac in, you know, Phoenix, Arizona, whether it was the server, whether it was the uranium deal.
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:40.720]  I mean, we just need to see the truth on all this and the Congress has not been able to unearth it.
[02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:43.720]  So let's get a special prosecutor and put it under a microscope.
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:51.720]  There's no reason why our attorney general should either recuse himself or hesitate from doing that.
[02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:54.720]  You know, when I was a kid growing up, I didn't know what God fearing meant.
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:55.720]  As I get older, I realized what it means.
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:38:56.720]  It's not that God's evil or bad.
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:39:00.720]  It's that you have respect for God, God's laws and common sense.
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:04.720]  You've seen how when people don't follow common sense and natural law, they get destroyed.
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:06.720]  So it's not even a fear.
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:07.720]  It's a respect.
[02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:16.720]  And I've noticed these globalists are all really hateful psychopath, sociopath, control freaks, neurotic.
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:17.720]  Some of them aren't a cultic.
[02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:18.720]  Some of them are.
[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:22.720]  But a lot of them, it's like in the WikiLeaks, you know, they're talking about all this Aleister Crowley stuff.
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:31.720]  And you realize what a pathetic group looking for power, even if you don't believe in God or the devil, I do in an archetype of the devil.
[02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:40.720]  And you literally find out their mascots, the devil, even if they don't really believe it, they get into the nastiness of the rituals and doing bad things.
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:43.720]  And it's just like, I know you and we talk about it at dinner.
[02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:44.720]  We talk about here.
[02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:49.720]  I don't know how much you want to talk about, but in your associate that was here talking about, you know, some of the top folks in the country they work with.
[02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:54.720]  And just how it's like, you can't swing a stick without running into a Luciferian.
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:39:55.720]  And again, they're not a devil worshipper.
[02:39:55.720 --> 02:39:57.720]  They think the devil's God.
[02:39:57.720 --> 02:39:59.720]  Can you speak to that, get some real trouble?
[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:01.720]  Well, yeah, now you open the gate.
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:03.720]  I mean, this is radical evil.
[02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:13.720]  So these are individuals who have largely divorced themselves from any kind of normal religion.
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:17.720]  But they've had to fill the void in their lives and in their interpersonal dealings.
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:25.720]  And they've looked at either Satan or the occult and they've begun to worship false gods, false idols.
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:34.720]  And a lot of it, of course, has to do with their own political power, with their own greed and accumulation of money and material.
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:43.720]  But they've been actually harsh critics then of those of us on the right who still practice traditional religion.
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:47.720]  And here I'm not trying to suggest we should become theocratic.
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:51.720]  I mean, I believe firmly in the First Amendment and the freedom of conscience.
[02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:53.720]  Well, there are no atheists and foxholes.
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:55.720]  I know God's real.
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:40:59.720]  I can feel the force of good and I can feel the force of evil.
[02:40:59.720 --> 02:41:12.720]  And to some degree, I would say, if you want to understand globalism, you need to get at the spiritual bearings, the spiritual underlying currents in globalism,
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:24.720]  which is not only relativistic, but it's a divorce, a great divorce from religion and from any notion that there is a God who exists or that you could know him personally.
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:32.720]  They would like, actually, and of course, Western Europe is a place where fewer than three or four percent of people have any religious tradition anymore.
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:42.720]  They would like to move the rest of the world away from their traditional bearings, from their traditional cultures, from their traditional scriptures.
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:48.720]  And why is that? To replace it with whatever they want. It's a power trip to end free will.
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:51.720]  Absolutely. And who will be in charge then?
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:42:04.720]  There aren't unelected bureaucrats who we call experts, really aren't that experts, who pull over on the rest of the population what they want to do and there's no democracy left in the end.
[02:42:04.720 --> 02:42:10.720]  There's no faith left in the end. There's just one gray monolithic state.
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:13.720]  That's what they want. They don't want real diversity.
[02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:16.720]  Oh, it's not about diversity. Not at all.
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:20.720]  If they like diversity, they like the differences in European countries.
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:25.720]  They want to homogenize that and make it all one color of gray.
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:31.720]  We're going to come back and go bam, bam, bam, Zack of Army Special Forces Command.
[02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:38.720]  And now in Morocco, as we can even talk to us, Zack is called in and he is an amazing force.

[02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:29.720]  He aligns himself with the truth. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:39.720]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:49.720]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:47:49.720 --> 02:47:58.720]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:00.720]  We're going to take phone calls this segment and a few more.
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:02.720]  Mike Sernovich is joining us.
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:09.720]  We've got Zach, who we were talking about at dinner last night, formerly with Army Special Forces, a command out of Florida.
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:11.720]  The FBI did pick him up and take him to a base.
[02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:17.720]  Last time he was on, he broke down what really went on from my sources as well at Vegas.
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:23.720]  So we've got Zach, we're going to in a moment, who had to go to Morocco or his mother lives just to be able to call us.
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:25.720]  But any other points you'd like to add?
[02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:30.720]  Well, I do want to say, because it's the thesis that I've been writing about most recently,
[02:48:30.720 --> 02:48:35.720]  that we also, and I think Trump is very good at this, we have to defend capitalism again.
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:38.720]  We have to go on the offensive about capitalism.
[02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:45.720]  Because in Europe, the reigning ideology, the reigning economic domain is socialism.
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:47.720]  And we have to challenge it.
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:52.720]  In the UK, the opposition party, the Labour Party is led by a Trotskyite.
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:58.720]  If May's government falls, which is very weak, we will have a socialist Trotskyite,
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:01.720]  Prime Minister of Great Britain, our most important ally.
[02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:03.720]  And Germany's going more to the left.
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:08.720]  So we have to understand that this is still a battle that we're involved in.
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:09.720]  We haven't won yet.
[02:49:09.720 --> 02:49:14.720]  Between capitalism and socialism on the economic zone, on the economic sphere.
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:19.720]  And if you look at it parliamentarily wise, people think, well, if Merkel almost lost,
[02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:23.720]  then how is socialism stronger? Well, now, basically the communists are coming in,
[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:27.720]  the coalition now supporting her to prop her up, but that gives them more power.
[02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:30.720]  So to stay in power, the left's gotten even more extreme.
[02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:31.720]  Same thing here.
[02:49:31.720 --> 02:49:34.720]  What are they going to extract in the German situation?
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:37.720]  This new grand coalition is with the Social Democratic Party.
[02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:42.720]  They are going to move the Merkel government, which teetered, obviously,
[02:49:42.720 --> 02:49:45.720]  couldn't put together another coalition to the left.
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:50.720]  And it's going to be, they've already stated yesterday, a United States of Europe,
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:53.720]  getting away with the nation state, doing away with the nation state.
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:55.720]  They're like, oh, by the way, you can't leave now.
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:50:01.720]  They're playing that game and they're going to play it hard and fast in order to keep Merkel in power.
[02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:03.720]  Historically, that doesn't go too well.
[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:07.720]  No. And Germany is the lead country in Europe.
[02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:10.720]  So what happens in Germany actually matters, not just the German economy,
[02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:12.720]  but they have an inordinate power.
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:16.720]  The entire euro currency, which is a phony currency to begin with,
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:20.720]  is basically contrived to help Germany.
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:22.720]  The German elites.
[02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:23.720]  Yeah.
[02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:24.720]  You think it helps the average German too?
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:25.720]  I think so.
[02:50:25.720 --> 02:50:29.720]  The average German has done very well.
[02:50:29.720 --> 02:50:36.720]  What's crazy is the EU is literally a Nazi construct idea of Junker's grandfather,
[02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:38.720]  and now he's the head of it.
[02:50:38.720 --> 02:50:44.720]  Well, about 40 years ago, there was a minister in Margaret Thatcher's great government
[02:50:44.720 --> 02:50:53.720]  who said at that point in time that the European Union is basically a scheme to prop up Germany.
[02:50:53.720 --> 02:50:56.720]  And he used the Hitler word, which of course you're not allowed to use.
[02:50:56.720 --> 02:50:59.720]  He was dismissed from Thatcher's government.
[02:50:59.720 --> 02:51:03.720]  The same can be true or said to be true today.
[02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:06.720]  The EU was a Nazi idea.
[02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:10.720]  It predates, certainly, its founding after the war.
[02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:17.720]  The whole genesis of the European Union came, frankly, after the First World War.
[02:51:17.720 --> 02:51:21.720]  Why is he still in control of Luxembourg when his grandfather took it by force?
[02:51:21.720 --> 02:51:25.720]  I mean, what the hell is going on with this unelected Junker?
[02:51:25.720 --> 02:51:29.720]  Well, this is the whole definition of the European political system.
[02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:33.720]  You don't have to elect your leaders, you just appoint them.
[02:51:33.720 --> 02:51:38.720]  Even the director generals of the different sectors in the European Union are not elected.
[02:51:38.720 --> 02:51:39.720]  They're just appointed.
[02:51:39.720 --> 02:51:43.720]  So where Napoleon and Hitler failed, they're succeeding?
[02:51:43.720 --> 02:51:45.720]  Until we bring them down.
[02:51:45.720 --> 02:51:50.720]  But this will be the third round of EU-European expansion.
[02:51:50.720 --> 02:51:51.720]  Well, they have expanded.
[02:51:51.720 --> 02:51:56.720]  There are other countries in the east of Europe that may want to go into that European Union,
[02:51:56.720 --> 02:51:59.720]  and they should be advised, I think, against that.
[02:51:59.720 --> 02:52:01.720]  I'm proud of Eastern Europe standing strong.
[02:52:01.720 --> 02:52:06.720]  Oh, yeah, no, the Poles and the Czechs and the Hungarians are really, I would say,
[02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:12.720]  giving the forces in Brussels more than a headache these days.
[02:52:12.720 --> 02:52:13.720]  I saw it just yesterday.
[02:52:13.720 --> 02:52:15.720]  Well, they know when something's taking them over.
[02:52:15.720 --> 02:52:22.720]  Well, they just said yesterday there's going to be a court case to force those countries to take asylum seekers.
[02:52:22.720 --> 02:52:24.720]  They're saying we can't integrate them into our countries.
[02:52:24.720 --> 02:52:25.720]  We don't want those.
[02:52:25.720 --> 02:52:26.720]  That's crazy.
[02:52:26.720 --> 02:52:30.720]  Some people say if the U.S. doesn't come back, the only thing westerns left Russia,
[02:52:30.720 --> 02:52:33.720]  and it's not even really western, it's its own thing.
[02:52:33.720 --> 02:52:35.720]  That tells you the crisis of the west right there.
[02:52:35.720 --> 02:52:36.720]  Yes.
[02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:41.720]  So we talked about western civilization, and I think we need to basically,
[02:52:41.720 --> 02:52:48.720]  certainly starting at a very young age, start to teach our students again about western civilization.
[02:52:48.720 --> 02:52:54.720]  In the case of Europe, they've actually lost touch with their foundation.
[02:52:54.720 --> 02:52:55.720]  Their ethos.
[02:52:55.720 --> 02:53:00.720]  Their entire cultural ethos, the foundations of western civilization,
[02:53:00.720 --> 02:53:03.720]  which is actually Greco-Roman Judeo-Christian.
[02:53:03.720 --> 02:53:05.720]  They've lost it.
[02:53:05.720 --> 02:53:10.720]  That's incredible diversity, by the way, because the west took stuff from the east,
[02:53:10.720 --> 02:53:12.720]  and that's what the west was.
[02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:15.720]  It was true melting pot of ideas.
[02:53:15.720 --> 02:53:18.720]  That's what's powerful about the west is it is diverse.
[02:53:18.720 --> 02:53:19.720]  It does grab ideas.
[02:53:19.720 --> 02:53:21.720]  Its language is big.
[02:53:21.720 --> 02:53:26.720]  Well, it's also the place where all innovation has been centered,
[02:53:26.720 --> 02:53:29.720]  where technology started, where we had the basis of economics,
[02:53:29.720 --> 02:53:31.720]  where we were the foundation of law.
[02:53:31.720 --> 02:53:34.720]  All of these things were rooted in that western culture,
[02:53:34.720 --> 02:53:36.720]  and we want to just wash our hands of it and say,
[02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:41.720]  well, let's have multiculturalism.
[02:53:41.720 --> 02:53:46.720]  When it's not even multiculturalism, it's globalism, a synthetic system of enslavement.
[02:53:46.720 --> 02:53:49.720]  It is very synthetic to say the least, but let's talk about it.
[02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:51.720]  What are the calls? Absolutely.
[02:53:51.720 --> 02:53:53.720]  I briefly, folks, support the broadcast.
[02:53:53.720 --> 02:53:54.720]  Don't fight the crowds.
[02:53:54.720 --> 02:53:55.720]  Don't fight the traffic.

[02:54:03.720 --> 02:54:06.720]  That is going to be, that still has to end in a couple of days,

[02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:11.720]  energy libido.
[02:54:11.720 --> 02:54:13.720]  It is, quite frankly, over the top, insane.
[02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:18.720]  Alpha power, 50% off out of the gates at infowarsstore.com,

[02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:22.720]  So I salute you.
[02:54:22.720 --> 02:54:24.720]  We're not winning, but we're turning the tide.
[02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:25.720]  We could win.
[02:54:25.720 --> 02:54:26.720]  So thanks for supporting us.
[02:54:26.720 --> 02:54:30.720]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, alpha power, the latest product,
[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:31.720]  and I think it'll be our best seller.
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:33.720]  Overall, it is just crazy powerful.
[02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:39.720]  I mean, I said with top formulators, I want the ultimate sports enhancement, energy libido,
[02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:42.720]  and I just, the ton of money went into this.
[02:54:42.720 --> 02:54:47.720]  The amount of product in it and the purity of the LJ100 and all the rest of it is just,
[02:54:47.720 --> 02:54:50.720]  look out, alpha power.
[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:51.720]  All right.
[02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:53.720]  Let's go to Zach in Morocco.
[02:54:53.720 --> 02:54:55.720]  Zach is his real name.
[02:54:55.720 --> 02:55:01.720]  He's been in special operations and intelligence, put out information the last six months where
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:03.720]  he's been picked up sent to military bases.
[02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:05.720]  So he's now left the U.S.
[02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:07.720]  We'll see what Zach has to say from Morocco.
[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:08.720]  Zach, what's the latest?
[02:55:08.720 --> 02:55:11.720]  First and foremost, it's a pleasure to be on with you gentlemen.
[02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:14.720]  So happy Friday and it's a beautiful day to be alive.
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:19.720]  That being said, I have a couple of dots to connect here.
[02:55:19.720 --> 02:55:21.720]  Some very interesting information coming out.
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:25.720]  First and foremost, a lot of people could do this intel, but let's look at Barack Obama
[02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:27.720]  following the footsteps of Trump globally.
[02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:30.720]  Immediately following his China trip, he's in country.
[02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:34.720]  Immediately following his India trip, he's in country three or four days later after the
[02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:36.720]  administration and secret service to leave.
[02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:41.720]  So Barack Obama has kind of been off the radar, even via social media, but make no mistake,
[02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:45.720]  he's making his rounds around the world to try to cover whatever bases he can.
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:49.720]  And the reason why this is important is because of this point.
[02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:56.720]  Let us not lose sight of the deep state and ISI backed Awan brothers who were in Congress
[02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:01.720]  in the Senate with their IT working, if you would call it that,
[02:56:01.720 --> 02:56:05.720]  which was essentially a cover for blackmailing tactics.
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:09.720]  You know, this is Debbie Washman, this is HRC, this is everything.
[02:56:09.720 --> 02:56:14.720]  And now I can say with full confidence with the shakeup going on in the DOJ via FBI,
[02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:18.720]  that this is all coming down crashing soon.
[02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:19.720]  It's all coming down.
[02:56:19.720 --> 02:56:26.720]  And Rand Paul, who's as active as anybody is in the Senate knew this, had the Awan brother
[02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:30.720]  information, had the intel, and obviously we haven't heard from him since he was attacked
[02:56:30.720 --> 02:56:34.720]  in his own home, um, disgustingly in Kentucky.
[02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:35.720]  And I have a couple more points.
[02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:39.720]  Six of his ribs broken, yeah, this is a total sigh up.
[02:56:39.720 --> 02:56:42.720]  And again, you're totally on target with everything you just laid out.
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:45.720]  Obama is acting as the shadow president with the shadow government saying,
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:47.720]  don't listen to him, we're about to take him out.
[02:56:47.720 --> 02:56:50.720]  Getting world leaders lined up and ready for Trump to be killed or removed,
[02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:52.720]  as they've said they're going to do in December.
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:55.720]  We'll see if they do it, but they've been saying they are.
[02:56:55.720 --> 02:56:58.720]  I even had, so, so this is a hell of a time to be alive.
[02:56:58.720 --> 02:57:01.720]  So, so, so this is the big connection.
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:06.720]  Our attention span has become so short and evaporated due to everything that's going on,
[02:57:06.720 --> 02:57:09.720]  but we need, let us not lose focus of Awan brothers.
[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:12.720]  You know, they worked for upwards of a hundred individuals.
[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:13.720]  Sure, let's be clear.
[02:57:13.720 --> 02:57:19.720]  Obama and the global issues, Islamic outside groups as muscle for their attempt to take over the U.S.
[02:57:19.720 --> 02:57:21.720]  and we still have those stay-behind networks connected.
[02:57:21.720 --> 02:57:25.720]  So, when we come back in one minute, I'm going to ask Zach then why you're getting into Awan brothers.
[02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:26.720]  But you're absolutely right.
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:32.720]  The Muslim Brotherhood, Saudi Arabian funding, Muslim muscle has been used by the traitorous Democrats
[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:34.720]  in their attempt to take over with Hillary.
[02:57:34.720 --> 02:57:35.720]  That failed.
[02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:38.720]  We got to deal with the stay-behind networks at the same time.
[02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:59.720]  Ted Malik's our guest. Stay with us.

[03:00:00.720 --> 03:00:05.720]  Waging war on corruption.

[03:00:12.720 --> 03:00:14.720]  We are ghosts.
[03:00:14.720 --> 03:00:15.720]  We see the earth.
[03:00:15.720 --> 03:00:17.720]  We see the earth from here.
[03:00:17.720 --> 03:00:20.720]  We got it.
[03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:23.720]  All right, Zach, I'm going to finish up with you.
[03:00:23.720 --> 03:00:25.720]  I'm glad you were able to call in.
[03:00:25.720 --> 03:00:27.720]  I was just talking to Ted about you last night during the break.
[03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:30.720]  I mean, you've done nothing wrong, but the stuff you know is what they're scared of,
[03:00:30.720 --> 03:00:33.720]  exposing the Vegas stuff that we were already on the trail of
[03:00:33.720 --> 03:00:35.720]  and getting into what's happening globally.
[03:00:35.720 --> 03:00:39.720]  I see desperate fundraising by Bono for Obama.
[03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:41.720]  I see their networks being rolled up.
[03:00:41.720 --> 03:00:43.720]  I see them in crisis mode.
[03:00:43.720 --> 03:00:48.720]  I see them now going after all the people with the whole fake investigation of Trump.
[03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:51.720]  I mean, I think we're starting to really smell victory in the air.
[03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:52.720]  What do you think, Zach?
[03:00:52.720 --> 03:00:56.720]  I absolutely concur in whether or not we could smell victory.
[03:00:56.720 --> 03:01:01.720]  Make no mistake, the Second American Revolution is in full engagement as we speak.
[03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:05.720]  And the reason I bring up that first point is that speaks to several individuals
[03:01:05.720 --> 03:01:08.720]  who know what I'm talking about and people who could do their own research there.
[03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:13.720]  But the point being is that the establishment and the power brokers for the last,
[03:01:13.720 --> 03:01:18.720]  I would say 20 to 25 years anticipated a Hillary Clinton win or worst case scenario,
[03:01:18.720 --> 03:01:22.720]  a Jeb Bush win that went very sideways during one of the debates
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:27.720]  when Donald Trump sort of called Jeb out and said about his whole family in 9-11.
[03:01:27.720 --> 03:01:31.720]  I mean, it went sideways there and we haven't looked back since.
[03:01:31.720 --> 03:01:34.720]  But from their perspective, they thought it was a for sure win
[03:01:34.720 --> 03:01:36.720]  and they were going to continue to move forward.
[03:01:36.720 --> 03:01:40.720]  But the reason you see Obama following Trump is to tap any loose ends
[03:01:40.720 --> 03:01:43.720]  to protect himself and to cover his own behind.
[03:01:43.720 --> 03:01:45.720]  But that's gone. That's long gone.
[03:01:45.720 --> 03:01:49.720]  Sure. So also you think to get intel on what Trump told world leaders
[03:01:49.720 --> 03:01:51.720]  so they can cover their ass?
[03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:54.720]  100%. And when you have to understand, especially within these other countries,
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:59.720]  I mean, the legitimate helms of those countries, legitimate helms are going to fall in line.
[03:01:59.720 --> 03:02:00.720]  They could see the power that Trump's...
[03:02:00.720 --> 03:02:03.720]  What do you make of the Secret Service calling me three days ago and saying
[03:02:03.720 --> 03:02:07.720]  we were ordered by Washington and they were like shaking.
[03:02:07.720 --> 03:02:11.720]  And it was one of these guys I know. And they said,
[03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:13.720]  no, we know it's real. We're investigating the people.
[03:02:13.720 --> 03:02:15.720]  Who else do you want to tell us about?
[03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:17.720]  It wasn't an investigation of me. It was real.
[03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:19.720]  And they seemed freaked out.
[03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:22.720]  I mean, what do you think that was?
[03:02:22.720 --> 03:02:25.720]  Quite frankly, I concur and I salute them because of the writings on the wall
[03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:28.720]  and we're going to move forward as I salute Matt Bracken as well
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:31.720]  who made it very well known yesterday or a couple of days ago
[03:02:31.720 --> 03:02:34.720]  when I was watching talking about foreign and or domestic.
[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:38.720]  Okay. So, you know, they think they're on this, you know, they're on a power high.
[03:02:38.720 --> 03:02:40.720]  They're literally out of their mind, but they're gone and it's over.
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:44.720]  And, you know, the underestimation of what the Trump administration is doing is
[03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:47.720]  it's going to be deadly and it's going to be historic.
[03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:48.720]  And, you know, when you...
[03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:52.720]  I was about to say, if they try violence and actually launch their antifa thing
[03:02:52.720 --> 03:02:55.720]  that they backed off on, the word is they know to back off.
[03:02:55.720 --> 03:03:00.720]  It's going to be bam. I mean, the military, the army, all of us ready to crush them.
[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:03.720]  It didn't happen. It didn't occur. I mean, we were all anticipating it.
[03:03:03.720 --> 03:03:05.720]  You talked about it. It didn't come to fruition.
[03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:08.720]  They're trying to raise money. They're having a hard time raising money.
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:11.720]  This Obama trailing is a very interesting phenomenon, I would say.
[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:13.720]  He's also, you know, very popular.
[03:03:13.720 --> 03:03:16.720]  He could be the next president of Europe if he ran,
[03:03:16.720 --> 03:03:20.720]  but he's out fundraising for his own foundation.
[03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:24.720]  Watch the Obama Foundation.
[03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:28.720]  I completely concur and that's exactly what's going on.
[03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:32.720]  But, you know, when you have a billionaire and an individual like Donald J. Trump
[03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:35.720]  who was going, who foresee his presidency,
[03:03:35.720 --> 03:03:37.720]  not many other individuals did besides Info Wars
[03:03:37.720 --> 03:03:39.720]  and several other individuals there,
[03:03:39.720 --> 03:03:43.720]  but when you have a Donald Trump who knew he was going to run several years with Foresight,
[03:03:43.720 --> 03:03:45.720]  bringing up the Barack Obama birth certificate,
[03:03:45.720 --> 03:03:47.720]  because I could tell you, I don't care.
[03:03:47.720 --> 03:03:50.720]  It's well known who I am. Listen, I'm going to tell you right now
[03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:51.720]  and the stuff I've been involved in.
[03:03:51.720 --> 03:03:53.720]  That birth certificate is phony.
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:56.720]  We know where he's from. We know the whole situation.
[03:03:56.720 --> 03:03:58.720]  And this has been going on generationally.
[03:03:58.720 --> 03:04:00.720]  So this is the Foresight. This is deeper.
[03:04:00.720 --> 03:04:04.720]  We can't just look at a surface level mainstream media perspective.
[03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:07.720]  You're basically saying Obama was supposed to be the Mahdi
[03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:11.720]  and the globalist version of an Islamist leader
[03:04:11.720 --> 03:04:14.720]  to like destroy the West and destroy Islam at the same time?
[03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:17.720]  If the Barack Obama, because put it this way,
[03:04:17.720 --> 03:04:19.720]  it was the DNC that was going to run the White House,
[03:04:19.720 --> 03:04:21.720]  even if Hillary was there ceremonially.
[03:04:21.720 --> 03:04:23.720]  It was the Obama family and him at the helm
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:25.720]  as the individual you have sharing with you there was correct.
[03:04:25.720 --> 03:04:28.720]  He could be the, you know, the king or the ruler of Europe.
[03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:31.720]  You want to look at it because it was going to go for a new world order.
[03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:33.720]  This was what was going to happen.
[03:04:33.720 --> 03:04:37.720]  But there's no coincidence that Bitcoin is completely towering at this point.
[03:04:37.720 --> 03:04:39.720]  And the Federal Reserve is freaking out.
[03:04:39.720 --> 03:04:42.720]  Barack Obama is chasing Trump, chasing Air Force One,
[03:04:42.720 --> 03:04:44.720]  where he used to occupy.
[03:04:44.720 --> 03:04:47.720]  And what's going on right now is nothing short of a miracle.
[03:04:47.720 --> 03:04:48.720]  And I got a couple more points.
[03:04:48.720 --> 03:04:50.720]  It is, it is. All right, stay there.
[03:04:52.720 --> 03:04:55.720]  I can Arizona here on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[03:04:55.720 --> 03:04:58.720]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[03:04:58.720 --> 03:05:00.720]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot
[03:05:00.720 --> 03:05:02.720]  and doing your best to save America
[03:05:02.720 --> 03:05:05.720]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that
[03:05:05.720 --> 03:05:07.720]  in our local areas as well.
[03:05:07.720 --> 03:05:10.720]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener,
[03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:14.720]  I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force, Anthroplex.
[03:05:14.720 --> 03:05:16.720]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex.
[03:05:16.720 --> 03:05:17.720]  Thank you.
[03:05:17.720 --> 03:05:20.720]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the super blue toothpaste
[03:05:20.720 --> 03:05:22.720]  for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans.
[03:05:22.720 --> 03:05:24.720]  The super blue is awesome.
[03:05:24.720 --> 03:05:27.720]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[03:05:27.720 --> 03:05:30.720]  They are quality. I can't wait to get some more.
[03:05:30.720 --> 03:05:33.720]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[03:05:33.720 --> 03:05:34.720]  Absolutely.
[03:05:34.720 --> 03:05:37.720]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots,
[03:05:37.720 --> 03:05:39.720]  help our other countrymen and women
[03:05:39.720 --> 03:05:42.720]  understand that there's bigger problems going on.
[03:05:42.720 --> 03:05:44.720]  And if we can get our houses in order
[03:05:44.720 --> 03:05:46.720]  and be good to each other and ourselves,
[03:05:46.720 --> 03:05:55.720]  we can take our country back.
[03:06:17.720 --> 03:06:22.720]  We now take you live to the collapse of the globalists.
[03:06:22.720 --> 03:06:24.720]  We've still got to build a civilization.
[03:06:24.720 --> 03:06:26.720]  Ted Malik is our guest.
[03:06:26.720 --> 03:06:28.720]  War member of the Davos group,
[03:06:28.720 --> 03:06:30.720]  head of the Aspen Institute previously,
[03:06:30.720 --> 03:06:32.720]  best-selling author, researcher.
[03:06:32.720 --> 03:06:34.720]  One of his great books is Davos, Aspen and Yale.
[03:06:34.720 --> 03:06:36.720]  Got his latest book on business.
[03:06:36.720 --> 03:06:38.720]  Ted Malik.com. Everybody should get it.
[03:06:38.720 --> 03:06:40.720]  We got the great Mike Cernovich,
[03:06:40.720 --> 03:06:42.720]  one of the biggest investigative journalists
[03:06:42.720 --> 03:06:45.720]  of the last 20 years, just in the last year, dominating.
[03:06:45.720 --> 03:06:47.720]  He's going to be co-hosting with us.
[03:06:47.720 --> 03:06:49.720]  But Zach, I got a bunch of callers.
[03:06:49.720 --> 03:06:51.720]  I've been bad to the callers. I'm going to run through them quick.
[03:06:51.720 --> 03:06:53.720]  And then turn it over to Mike Cernovich, who always is nice
[03:06:53.720 --> 03:06:57.720]  and lets me hog him when he hosts the fourth hour on Fridays.
[03:06:57.720 --> 03:06:59.720]  Zach, we know who you are.
[03:06:59.720 --> 03:07:01.720]  We know you're a great source.
[03:07:01.720 --> 03:07:03.720]  Don't give us anything classified.
[03:07:03.720 --> 03:07:05.720]  Just give us your citizens' view of things.
[03:07:05.720 --> 03:07:07.720]  What was the other point you wanted to make real quick?
[03:07:07.720 --> 03:07:09.720]  Yeah, absolutely. And I just got to get to this one.
[03:07:09.720 --> 03:07:11.720]  I'll let the researchers look into this.
[03:07:11.720 --> 03:07:13.720]  But there's no Awan brothers
[03:07:13.720 --> 03:07:15.720]  without the Huma Abedin connection.
[03:07:15.720 --> 03:07:19.720]  Huma is the Barak Hussein source.
[03:07:19.720 --> 03:07:21.720]  Has nothing to do with HRC.
[03:07:21.720 --> 03:07:23.720]  She has a taste for women.
[03:07:23.720 --> 03:07:25.720]  So that gets pretty creepy and weird, but make no mistake.
[03:07:25.720 --> 03:07:27.720]  The connection is Huma and Hussein,
[03:07:27.720 --> 03:07:29.720]  and Hussein is Barak O.
[03:07:29.720 --> 03:07:31.720]  And the reason I'm making this call
[03:07:31.720 --> 03:07:33.720]  is because of the active threats
[03:07:33.720 --> 03:07:35.720]  that are potentially out there this weekend
[03:07:35.720 --> 03:07:37.720]  at the embassies around our world
[03:07:37.720 --> 03:07:39.720]  that happen to be U.S. and stateside.
[03:07:39.720 --> 03:07:41.720]  And that's the reason I'm making this call.
[03:07:41.720 --> 03:07:43.720]  The kind of trouble I've been in and stuff.
[03:07:43.720 --> 03:07:45.720]  But at this point, this is the Second American Revolution.
[03:07:45.720 --> 03:07:47.720]  I do call you from the Kingdom of Morocco.
[03:07:47.720 --> 03:07:49.720]  And I also challenge your guests
[03:07:49.720 --> 03:07:51.720]  to look up the Moroccan American Treaty of Friendship
[03:07:51.720 --> 03:07:53.720]  that was signed in 1786.
[03:07:53.720 --> 03:07:55.720]  Morocco was the first country to recognize
[03:07:55.720 --> 03:07:57.720]  the United States of America.
[03:07:57.720 --> 03:07:59.720]  That was signed by John Adams.
[03:07:59.720 --> 03:08:01.720]  That was signed by John Adams.
[03:08:01.720 --> 03:08:03.720]  That was signed by Thomas Jefferson
[03:08:03.720 --> 03:08:05.720]  and the Sultan Mohammed III of Morocco.
[03:08:05.720 --> 03:08:07.720]  And it's no coincidence I'm here. I'm a patriot.
[03:08:07.720 --> 03:08:09.720]  My family has been involved in this since the get-go.
[03:08:09.720 --> 03:08:11.720]  My colors don't run.
[03:08:11.720 --> 03:08:13.720]  And I got one more point,
[03:08:13.720 --> 03:08:15.720]  but I know you've got to get to other people here.
[03:08:15.720 --> 03:08:17.720]  Go ahead.
[03:08:17.720 --> 03:08:19.720]  Okay, so the big connection
[03:08:19.720 --> 03:08:21.720]  is the Huma Abedin Barak Obama connection.
[03:08:21.720 --> 03:08:23.720]  There are active threats.
[03:08:23.720 --> 03:08:25.720]  When we see the
[03:08:25.720 --> 03:08:27.720]  capital moving in Israel,
[03:08:27.720 --> 03:08:29.720]  this was understood
[03:08:29.720 --> 03:08:31.720]  that it would cause unrest.
[03:08:31.720 --> 03:08:33.720]  This is a hand being played
[03:08:33.720 --> 03:08:35.720]  in a very, very
[03:08:35.720 --> 03:08:37.720]  elaborate game of poker.
[03:08:37.720 --> 03:08:39.720]  We understand
[03:08:39.720 --> 03:08:41.720]  that the unrest would come.
[03:08:41.720 --> 03:08:43.720]  We understand that there would be a threat.
[03:08:43.720 --> 03:08:45.720]  But we're here.
[03:08:45.720 --> 03:08:47.720]  We're facing it, and it's not
[03:08:47.720 --> 03:08:49.720]  going to phase us.
[03:08:49.720 --> 03:08:51.720]  Something may happen this weekend.
[03:08:51.720 --> 03:08:53.720]  Sure, it's meant to flesh it out.
[03:08:53.720 --> 03:08:55.720]  You want the confrontation, you're going to get it.
[03:08:55.720 --> 03:08:57.720]  And it's getting it. And this is year one.
[03:08:57.720 --> 03:08:59.720]  Make no mistake, this is year one of the presidency.
[03:08:59.720 --> 03:09:01.720]  The reason I'm making the call,
[03:09:01.720 --> 03:09:03.720]  the reason I'm connecting these dots,
[03:09:03.720 --> 03:09:05.720]  is I have faith in the Trump administration.
[03:09:05.720 --> 03:09:07.720]  And there is an active threat right now.
[03:09:07.720 --> 03:09:09.720]  Stateside and embassies around the world
[03:09:09.720 --> 03:09:11.720]  do, it will be blamed
[03:09:11.720 --> 03:09:13.720]  on Donald Trump for moving the embassy.
[03:09:13.720 --> 03:09:15.720]  But we're not going to have
[03:09:15.720 --> 03:09:17.720]  something held over our head and be threatened constantly.
[03:09:17.720 --> 03:09:19.720]  Sure, it's been intimidation.
[03:09:19.720 --> 03:09:21.720]  It's been terrorism.
[03:09:21.720 --> 03:09:23.720]  When you see the leader
[03:09:23.720 --> 03:09:25.720]  of India, an established country
[03:09:25.720 --> 03:09:27.720]  with over a billion people there,
[03:09:27.720 --> 03:09:29.720]  falling into the arms of Donald Trump,
[03:09:29.720 --> 03:09:31.720]  why do you think that is?
[03:09:31.720 --> 03:09:33.720]  Because Pakistan, the Awan brothers,
[03:09:33.720 --> 03:09:35.720]  Huma, they're not in the White House.
[03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:37.720]  They are mortal enemies.
[03:09:37.720 --> 03:09:39.720]  So when you have the Indian president
[03:09:39.720 --> 03:09:41.720]  falling into the arms of our
[03:09:41.720 --> 03:09:43.720]  current leader, this is
[03:09:43.720 --> 03:09:45.720]  the most symbolic image
[03:09:45.720 --> 03:09:47.720]  that if you don't see the writing on the wall,
[03:09:47.720 --> 03:09:49.720]  you won't understand. But there's a reason for that.
[03:09:49.720 --> 03:09:51.720]  That affects China and everything else.
[03:09:51.720 --> 03:09:53.720]  Zach, stay in contact, be safe, amazing.
[03:09:53.720 --> 03:09:55.720]  Ted Malik, then we're going to bring in
[03:09:55.720 --> 03:09:57.720]  CERN with you to take on this.
[03:09:57.720 --> 03:09:59.720]  It's very, very, very keen insight there.
[03:09:59.720 --> 03:10:01.720]  I've listened to him all day long.
[03:10:01.720 --> 03:10:03.720]  I think he's on
[03:10:03.720 --> 03:10:05.720]  the tip there of a number of things
[03:10:05.720 --> 03:10:07.720]  that are happening. But the whole
[03:10:07.720 --> 03:10:09.720]  world is changing
[03:10:09.720 --> 03:10:11.720]  to realign with the presidency
[03:10:11.720 --> 03:10:13.720]  of Donald Trump.
[03:10:13.720 --> 03:10:15.720]  America is special.
[03:10:15.720 --> 03:10:17.720]  In destiny.
[03:10:19.720 --> 03:10:21.720]  It has been since
[03:10:21.720 --> 03:10:23.720]  the very first
[03:10:23.720 --> 03:10:25.720]  appearance of Americans on the shore.
[03:10:25.720 --> 03:10:27.720]  And
[03:10:27.720 --> 03:10:29.720]  it is a city on a hill.
[03:10:29.720 --> 03:10:31.720]  So we were just walking
[03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:33.720]  by a wonderful
[03:10:33.720 --> 03:10:35.720]  portrait that you have, one of my favorites
[03:10:35.720 --> 03:10:37.720]  of Ronald Reagan, and
[03:10:37.720 --> 03:10:39.720]  brought back all those heartbeats
[03:10:39.720 --> 03:10:41.720]  of his speeches and how he viewed America.
[03:10:41.720 --> 03:10:43.720]  I think we're in a new morning
[03:10:43.720 --> 03:10:45.720]  for America, but it's going to be a bumpy ride.
[03:10:45.720 --> 03:10:47.720]  And the rest of the world is going to have
[03:10:47.720 --> 03:10:49.720]  to learn to live with
[03:10:49.720 --> 03:10:51.720]  President Trump.
[03:10:51.720 --> 03:10:53.720]  Yeah, I think he's
[03:10:53.720 --> 03:10:55.720]  really, they're realizing
[03:10:55.720 --> 03:10:57.720]  their will is broken right now.
[03:10:57.720 --> 03:10:59.720]  You've always got huge breaking news
[03:10:59.720 --> 03:11:01.720]  at Cernovich right there on Twitter. Everybody should follow you.
[03:11:01.720 --> 03:11:03.720]  You've got a lot to cover here.
[03:11:03.720 --> 03:11:05.720]  I'm going to take a few calls where I can
[03:11:05.720 --> 03:11:07.720]  ditch these poor callers and holding like great folks, Shabbats
[03:11:07.720 --> 03:11:09.720]  and Kevin and Lauren and Josh.
[03:11:09.720 --> 03:11:11.720]  But you've always got huge breaking news.
[03:11:11.720 --> 03:11:13.720]  What do you make of
[03:11:13.720 --> 03:11:15.720]  Dana Powell,
[03:11:15.720 --> 03:11:17.720]  Deena Powell leaving all this?
[03:11:17.720 --> 03:11:19.720]  You've always got the cutting edge, Mike Cernovich.
[03:11:19.720 --> 03:11:21.720]  Deena Powell was
[03:11:21.720 --> 03:11:23.720]  the source of the article about Rex Tillerson,
[03:11:23.720 --> 03:11:25.720]  which ended up
[03:11:25.720 --> 03:11:27.720]  had to call it out as fake.
[03:11:27.720 --> 03:11:29.720]  So here's what happened with Deena Powell.
[03:11:29.720 --> 03:11:31.720]  Nobody else knows it. Well, a couple people do,
[03:11:31.720 --> 03:11:33.720]  but it hasn't been reported.
[03:11:33.720 --> 03:11:35.720]  She planted a fake story
[03:11:35.720 --> 03:11:37.720]  with the New York Times and other outlets
[03:11:37.720 --> 03:11:39.720]  about how Rex Tillerson was out.
[03:11:39.720 --> 03:11:41.720]  Deena Powell thought then she could move
[03:11:41.720 --> 03:11:43.720]  Nikki Haley to Secretary of State
[03:11:43.720 --> 03:11:45.720]  and then Deena would take over
[03:11:45.720 --> 03:11:47.720]  as the United States ambassador
[03:11:47.720 --> 03:11:49.720]  to the UN.
[03:11:49.720 --> 03:11:51.720]  After her little chess game and power play
[03:11:51.720 --> 03:11:53.720]  failed, then she saw the handwriting
[03:11:53.720 --> 03:11:55.720]  on the wall and she has also been a
[03:11:55.720 --> 03:11:57.720]  leaker for the entire year.
[03:11:57.720 --> 03:11:59.720]  So that's why she left.
[03:11:59.720 --> 03:12:01.720]  Mike Cernovich always has the exclusive.
[03:12:01.720 --> 03:12:03.720]  What other giant exclusives do you have
[03:12:03.720 --> 03:12:05.720]  for us, Mike Cernovich?
[03:12:05.720 --> 03:12:07.720]  Well, I mean, you know, we got them warmed up,
[03:12:07.720 --> 03:12:09.720]  but that's the truth about Paul
[03:12:09.720 --> 03:12:11.720]  and warmed up. I mean, today,
[03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:13.720]  today there's so much going on, man.
[03:12:13.720 --> 03:12:15.720]  The Roy Moore video,
[03:12:15.720 --> 03:12:17.720]  yearbooks of forgery, and so I want to
[03:12:17.720 --> 03:12:19.720]  apologize to you, Alex,
[03:12:19.720 --> 03:12:21.720]  and to Enfa Wars. I owe you all a big
[03:12:21.720 --> 03:12:23.720]  man. I'll own it.
[03:12:23.720 --> 03:12:25.720]  I said, Alex, you're crazy.
[03:12:25.720 --> 03:12:27.720]  It isn't too signatures.
[03:12:27.720 --> 03:12:29.720]  You know, I was like, we can't do conspiracy theories.
[03:12:29.720 --> 03:12:31.720]  So and I told that to many listeners
[03:12:31.720 --> 03:12:33.720]  and viewers, so I would just like to apologize
[03:12:33.720 --> 03:12:35.720]  to everybody listening, everybody
[03:12:35.720 --> 03:12:37.720]  watching and to you personally,
[03:12:37.720 --> 03:12:39.720]  that you guys were right on that and I was wrong.
[03:12:39.720 --> 03:12:41.720]  Well, I'll remember.
[03:12:41.720 --> 03:12:43.720]  We just reported that he was saying it was fake.
[03:12:43.720 --> 03:12:45.720]  They look different. I mean, I wasn't like betting
[03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:47.720]  the farm on it.
[03:12:47.720 --> 03:12:49.720]  But you guys were right, though, and I
[03:12:49.720 --> 03:12:51.720]  just said outright. So I have to
[03:12:51.720 --> 03:12:53.720]  own the as a journalist, you know, what I've
[03:12:53.720 --> 03:12:55.720]  learned about people is they're all right
[03:12:55.720 --> 03:12:57.720]  if you get it wrong, but you own it and you
[03:12:57.720 --> 03:12:59.720]  admit it. But what they hate is what the
[03:12:59.720 --> 03:13:01.720]  fake news media does, which they never own
[03:13:01.720 --> 03:13:03.720]  their mistakes. I mean, it was a
[03:13:03.720 --> 03:13:05.720]  it's a forgery, Alex. I mean, this is the
[03:13:05.720 --> 03:13:07.720]  world we live in now where they will fabricate
[03:13:07.720 --> 03:13:09.720]  evidence against us to bring us down
[03:13:09.720 --> 03:13:11.720]  and then the media
[03:13:11.720 --> 03:13:13.720]  CNN said that anybody
[03:13:13.720 --> 03:13:15.720]  who says these signatures might be
[03:13:15.720 --> 03:13:17.720]  fake is a conspiracy theorist.
[03:13:17.720 --> 03:13:19.720]  This is actually what they said. They go,
[03:13:19.720 --> 03:13:21.720]  Oh, you can't even you can't even ask that
[03:13:21.720 --> 03:13:23.720]  question. You can't even examine a signature.
[03:13:23.720 --> 03:13:25.720]  Well, they didn't do a very good job.
[03:13:25.720 --> 03:13:27.720]  It looks like two different handwriting.
[03:13:27.720 --> 03:13:29.720]  Yeah, exactly. And that just
[03:13:29.720 --> 03:13:31.720]  goes to show that even I
[03:13:31.720 --> 03:13:33.720]  am still in a way a victim of
[03:13:33.720 --> 03:13:35.720]  the fake news brainwashing. Well, nobody
[03:13:35.720 --> 03:13:37.720]  nobody can be perfect in the middle of this.
[03:13:37.720 --> 03:13:39.720]  At the time, I don't know what what
[03:13:39.720 --> 03:13:41.720]  ends up. So Mike, you're nice. I don't really
[03:13:41.720 --> 03:13:43.720]  remember that. I remember us saying it might be
[03:13:43.720 --> 03:13:45.720]  fake and you questioning it, but we're not running
[03:13:45.720 --> 03:13:47.720]  the culture. Paul Watson agrees with me a
[03:13:47.720 --> 03:13:49.720]  lot of the time. He disagrees a lot of the
[03:13:49.720 --> 03:13:51.720]  time. But I know we're all good people. We're
[03:13:51.720 --> 03:13:53.720]  all good actors here trying to figure out this
[03:13:53.720 --> 03:13:55.720]  truth. Ted Mallett. Yeah, I mean,
[03:13:55.720 --> 03:13:57.720]  I said the same thing about that
[03:13:57.720 --> 03:13:59.720]  signature. I thought it was probably
[03:13:59.720 --> 03:14:01.720]  written. I mean, if you do the kind of analysis
[03:14:01.720 --> 03:14:03.720]  forensic analysis that you would have to
[03:14:03.720 --> 03:14:05.720]  do, they were unwilling to do it. So what
[03:14:05.720 --> 03:14:07.720]  does that say? But if you do that analysis,
[03:14:07.720 --> 03:14:09.720]  then you might even see that the
[03:14:09.720 --> 03:14:11.720]  handwriting was basically done in
[03:14:11.720 --> 03:14:13.720]  the last year. And it's
[03:14:13.720 --> 03:14:15.720]  a yearbook from decades ago. Exactly.
[03:14:15.720 --> 03:14:17.720]  They can study the ink. I mean,
[03:14:17.720 --> 03:14:19.720]  people know how to do this. I don't know
[03:14:19.720 --> 03:14:21.720]  how to do it. They got a electron microscope.
[03:14:21.720 --> 03:14:23.720]  They look at it and know what it is. Science.
[03:14:23.720 --> 03:14:25.720]  Let the scientists look at it.
[03:14:25.720 --> 03:14:27.720]  I mean, let them have a look.
[03:14:27.720 --> 03:14:29.720]  You know, I've not harassed any women.
[03:14:29.720 --> 03:14:31.720]  I don't have any weird skeletons, but I just
[03:14:31.720 --> 03:14:33.720]  wonder what the new Jack in the Box
[03:14:33.720 --> 03:14:35.720]  thing is going to be because they've been
[03:14:35.720 --> 03:14:37.720]  going after everybody. And clearly, we
[03:14:37.720 --> 03:14:39.720]  predicted this whole Weinstein thing
[03:14:39.720 --> 03:14:41.720]  was just to get after Trump. They now admit
[03:14:41.720 --> 03:14:43.720]  that, Mike. Yeah,
[03:14:43.720 --> 03:14:45.720]  they're now trying to actually frame
[03:14:45.720 --> 03:14:47.720]  us. So my wife and daughter have
[03:14:47.720 --> 03:14:49.720]  been receiving a lot of threats from
[03:14:49.720 --> 03:14:51.720]  the far left media. And then
[03:14:51.720 --> 03:14:53.720]  when I defend myself from the threats,
[03:14:53.720 --> 03:14:55.720]  they're now saying that I'm harassing them.
[03:14:55.720 --> 03:14:57.720]  So we live. I mean, Alex,
[03:14:57.720 --> 03:14:59.720]  I just don't know what to say other
[03:14:59.720 --> 03:15:01.720]  than the media has become
[03:15:01.720 --> 03:15:03.720]  no different than a domestic terrorist arm.
[03:15:03.720 --> 03:15:05.720]  They attack our families. They attack everybody
[03:15:05.720 --> 03:15:07.720]  close to us. They lie about us.
[03:15:07.720 --> 03:15:09.720]  They frame people for crimes.
[03:15:09.720 --> 03:15:11.720]  They failed to report material things
[03:15:11.720 --> 03:15:13.720]  like General Flynn was framed for obstructing
[03:15:13.720 --> 03:15:15.720]  justice. Because as we now
[03:15:15.720 --> 03:15:17.720]  know, the FBI agent who did the interviews
[03:15:17.720 --> 03:15:19.720]  was in the bag for Hillary. And now the
[03:15:19.720 --> 03:15:21.720]  judges were accused.
[03:15:21.720 --> 03:15:23.720]  Mike's service taken over. I apologize. Every color
[03:15:23.720 --> 03:15:25.720]  on hold gets a free t-shirt or
[03:15:25.720 --> 03:15:27.720]  alpha power, whatever they want.
[03:15:27.720 --> 03:15:29.720]  I apologize to them. Ted Malik. Thanks
[03:15:29.720 --> 03:15:31.720]  for all the time. It's been amazing.
[03:15:31.720 --> 03:15:33.720]  Ted Malik.com. I can't wait to have you back on.
[03:15:33.720 --> 03:15:35.720]  Mike's service is taken over and get out of
[03:15:35.720 --> 03:15:37.720]  his way. Great job to the crew. I'll be back
[03:15:37.720 --> 03:15:39.720]  with David Knight this Sunday.

[03:15:41.720 --> 03:15:43.720]  All right. He's coming up. Stay with us.
[03:15:43.720 --> 03:15:45.720]  Spread the links. Spread the articles.
[03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:47.720]  That's an active resistance.
[03:15:47.720 --> 03:16:09.720]  Mike's service is coming up.
