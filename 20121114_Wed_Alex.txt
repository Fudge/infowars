[01:27.040 --> 01:32.960]  two nights ago here in Austin with the premiere of a new big video game out there promoting
[01:32.960 --> 01:38.160]  drones and endless endless war and how this is conditioning the public our own Melissa

[01:52.120 --> 01:58.640]  takeover of the United States by the globalist I mentioned this story yesterday I was rereading
[01:58.640 --> 02:02.520]  it up here at about eight o'clock at night last night before I went home and I thought
[02:02.520 --> 02:08.920]  man I've got to cover this article properly because there it is in the local San Diego
[02:08.920 --> 02:14.880]  paper saying people are getting thousands of dollars to report on their neighbors if
[02:14.880 --> 02:20.560]  they're washing their car that's considered improper water runoff but the government
[02:20.560 --> 02:25.080]  can put fluoride in thousands of you know different things in your food and water and
[02:25.080 --> 02:31.840]  all the rest of it you're talking about hundred thousand dollar fines massive jail time this
[02:31.840 --> 02:38.720]  is the agenda twenty one tyranny that's unfolding worldwide you know I first started exposing
[02:38.720 --> 02:45.320]  my shelf agenda twenty one in nineteen ninety seven off the Rio de Janeiro nineteen ninety
[02:45.320 --> 02:49.880]  two meeting that it's based on the twenty one the twenty first century and also covered
[02:49.880 --> 02:55.320]  it my film America and destroyed by design again in ninety seven and I'm not territorial
[02:55.320 --> 02:59.640]  about when I covered it it's just that we covered it ninety seven and we covered it
[02:59.640 --> 03:04.920]  in two thousand one in nine eleven the road to tyranny actually showing clips from the
[03:04.920 --> 03:09.480]  Rio summit calling for world government and how they would use these systems to take over
[03:09.480 --> 03:13.560]  your property I covered it seven years ago in in game blueprint for global enslavement
[03:13.560 --> 03:18.000]  with Dr. Michael Kaufman who helped advise Congress and help kill the takeover in ninety
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.960]  four I don't want to get Dr. Michael Kaufman back on he hadn't been on in a while and yesterday
[03:23.960 --> 03:27.640]  after I got off the air I don't know how to respond to this because I haven't been going
[03:27.640 --> 03:32.760]  after going back in a couple years really much Watson called up and said have you seen
[03:32.760 --> 03:36.720]  this and I didn't have time to even watch it till last night when I got home and had
[03:36.720 --> 03:43.000]  to muddle through it Glenn Beck saying I'm a piece of garbage and and and using the ignorance
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.040]  of his audience trying to imply that I'm trying to cover up agenda twenty one it's it's very
[03:49.040 --> 03:54.480]  bizarre and they talked about how he's been talking about it for two years you know my
[03:54.480 --> 03:58.640]  criticism of Glenn Beck I'm going to cover this briefly later I'm gonna do a whole piece
[03:58.640 --> 04:03.320]  on this and do it properly where we really lay out what Glenn Beck's done and you know
[04:03.320 --> 04:07.040]  four years ago he'd say Ron Paul supporters are dangerous the army may need to be used
[04:07.040 --> 04:11.600]  against them just out of the blue when when Ron Paul had a chance to win primaries and
[04:11.600 --> 04:16.840]  so I got mad at Glenn Beck when I went Fox News so we want to have you here to the studio

[04:40.400 --> 04:44.240]  he says you're not allowed over here he's gonna flip out I mean that's the kind of stuff
[04:44.240 --> 04:49.440]  and I mean Glenn Beck is like a body snatcher first he attacked us when he couldn't beat
[04:49.440 --> 04:54.440]  us he tried to become us and now he wants to try to say I'm pro-new-world order so we're
[04:54.440 --> 04:58.880]  gonna be exposing that coming up today I'm gonna go ahead and expose Glenn back on put

[08:58.560 --> 09:05.080]  market meltdown u.s. stocks hit three months low that's out of the wall street journal
[09:05.080 --> 09:12.800]  wall street journal is also reporting that obama plans a 1.6 trillion dollar tax hike
[09:12.800 --> 09:20.560]  double what he had previously claimed and that is a spokesperson for bainer speaker
[09:20.560 --> 09:26.000]  of the house saying that that's what obama is proposing to them and the acceleration
[09:26.000 --> 09:34.920]  of dumping of the different stocks is accelerating so we're going to be looking at some of that
[09:34.920 --> 09:39.480]  today jesse ventura is going to be giving us weekly updates of the next four or five
[09:39.480 --> 09:47.760]  weeks he's going to be popping in and we are going to open the phones up as well today
[09:47.760 --> 09:55.040]  so this situation with portray us the point i've been making since this this this news
[09:55.040 --> 10:04.360]  broke over the weekend that the fbi was surveilling the cia director because a woman complained
[10:04.360 --> 10:12.840]  to the fbi that a biographer of the general had said you better watch your back and so
[10:12.840 --> 10:18.680]  that's why they were surveilling him that's the patriot act for you and that's what the
[10:18.680 --> 10:26.800]  nsa and all of this is about it is about the system surveilling its own minions and controlling
[10:26.800 --> 10:32.960]  them so portray a scandal proves email is being surveilled even the director of the
[10:32.960 --> 10:37.120]  cia cannot escape the watching eye of big brother well of course that's who it's mainly
[10:37.120 --> 10:41.880]  focused on is the criminals watching each other portray us agrees to testify on libya
[10:41.880 --> 10:47.880]  before congressional committee fbi's abuse of surveillance state is the real scandal
[10:47.880 --> 10:57.440]  needing investigation this article just came out today and i'm glad that mainstream media
[10:57.440 --> 11:03.840]  is picking up on that because you're surveilling the cia director because a woman got a half
[11:03.840 --> 11:07.840]  threatening email from another woman who happens to know me give me a break they're surveilling
[11:07.840 --> 11:11.760]  all these people they always have some little cover story of why they're doing it online
[11:11.760 --> 11:16.960]  privacy issue is also in play and portray a scandal that's the new york times a new
[11:16.960 --> 11:22.720]  video of broadwell and aspen raises more questions now those two hoity toying around
[11:22.720 --> 11:29.160]  with each other you've got you know the media following her around taking photos of her
[11:29.160 --> 11:34.600]  drinking wine in her house i mean this is just incredible this is a giant distraction
[11:34.600 --> 11:41.200]  to purge the u.s. military of generals that have been saying no to an iran strike the
[11:41.200 --> 11:46.040]  evidence is overwhelming that that's why this is going on a lot of people like hey this
[11:46.040 --> 11:51.320]  could bring down obama what happened in Benghazi there are internal camps even within the obama
[11:51.320 --> 11:57.040]  administration and i would love to see the executive excoriated i would love to see people
[11:57.040 --> 12:02.040]  brought to justice i mean just in the in the eyes of the people if obama got impeached
[12:02.040 --> 12:07.360]  that would discredit the socialism and the power grabbing but there's a larger issue
[12:07.360 --> 12:14.880]  here is why is the military being purged for girlfriends and it's coming out because of
[12:14.880 --> 12:20.800]  fbi surveillance and fbi raids now they're talking about arresting broadwell because
[12:20.800 --> 12:27.040]  she might have had classified stuff you know that that that she was given access to for
[12:27.040 --> 12:31.880]  her biography well they classify basically everything and they classify where the general
[12:31.880 --> 12:36.720]  when he was over afghanistan was going to go that day to have a meeting or have lunch
[12:36.720 --> 12:40.920]  i mean the cia every year i've seen articles where they admit they classify over a million
[12:40.920 --> 12:46.280]  pieces of news they review news articles and then don't want i don't want their underlings
[12:46.280 --> 12:51.560]  reading it usually it's bad you know news about something they've done and they'll classify
[12:51.560 --> 13:00.320]  that so just incredible this is part of the going after the whistleblowers putting whistleblowers
[13:00.320 --> 13:06.400]  in prison this is about persecuting people that report on corruption and this is about
[13:06.400 --> 13:11.800]  a power struggle within the government over who gets to control the major reins of this
[13:11.800 --> 13:19.280]  new world order system and now they're talking about arresting her so this is certainly meant
[13:19.280 --> 13:24.880]  to scare everybody they've had four other generals have to step down or cut back you
[13:24.880 --> 13:30.720]  know being demoted over lavish trips or over mistresses or whatever and the point is the
[13:30.720 --> 13:38.040]  congress many of them are in there laying their male pages out over the desk that's
[13:38.040 --> 13:41.320]  well known you constantly see those scandals coming out that all gets swept in the rug
[13:41.320 --> 13:48.280]  real fast you've got deaths you know in congressman's offices of female members you've got all
[13:48.280 --> 13:53.520]  these scandals that come and go but are very small compared to this show they are selectively
[13:53.520 --> 14:01.440]  enforcing on the military plus it's scandals people can handle it's it's men with women
[14:01.440 --> 14:06.080]  it's not like Penn State and the Penn State had covering it up and clearly that was a
[14:06.080 --> 14:13.680]  child trafficking operation or the BBC you know top presenter Savelle you know hanging
[14:13.680 --> 14:18.720]  out of the royal family and saying quote he does things for me and all of that sickening
[14:18.720 --> 14:24.360]  stuff I mean this is how unsorted it is because once you get a corrupt system the worst of
[14:24.360 --> 14:28.960]  the worst get in you guys have that Glenn Beck clip ready because we're going to play
[14:28.960 --> 14:33.640]  that here in just a moment and and speaking of this we've got so much world news going
[14:33.640 --> 14:39.200]  on we've got so much that is important but I will spend a couple minutes on this at the
[14:39.200 --> 14:47.360]  bottom of the hour just because you know Glenn Beck is very successful Glenn Beck obviously
[14:47.360 --> 14:56.320]  has done a lot of good but he's also done a lot of bad personally to me over the years
[14:56.320 --> 15:02.320]  and taking things out of context really tried to demonize yours truly but but that isn't
[15:02.320 --> 15:05.160]  why I started having issue with him because you know me I don't get up here and attack
[15:05.160 --> 15:08.800]  Michael Savage I don't get up here and attack Rush Limbaugh you know I'm up against Rush
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.360]  Limbaugh I mean I criticize when he says we should put people in jail for mandatory sentences
[15:13.360 --> 15:20.000]  when he's would be in jail for drugs himself if that was enforced on him but you know I
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.280]  wasn't happy whenever Michael Savage you left where he was at even though we got a bunch
[15:23.280 --> 15:29.200]  of affiliates out of it because it's not about I'm going to be number one no matter what
[15:29.200 --> 15:33.320]  happens and I'm going to be the guy with the most money and I'm going to charge $500 you
[15:33.320 --> 15:37.920]  know for 300 people to come here and give a speech so I can fly there in a private jet
[15:37.920 --> 15:42.040]  I'm not even against money it's just that at certain point I'm kind of provincial you
[15:42.040 --> 15:45.640]  know that I'm like I can go give speeches to 5,000 people I could say I'm going to speak
[15:45.640 --> 15:50.400]  in Chicago next month 5,000 people be there I wanted to charge them $100 a piece they'd
[15:50.400 --> 15:56.000]  pay it I could fly there in a private jet videotape myself in the private jet and and
[15:56.000 --> 16:01.400]  I guess I probably should do that because that's what the world pays attention to and
[16:01.400 --> 16:05.120]  then I can get my message out I think I'm actually thinking about doing to Glenn Beck
[16:05.120 --> 16:10.480]  what he's done to me and actually going and having big things with 5,000 people he can't
[16:10.480 --> 16:15.840]  get 5,000 anymore but and charging people $100 so I could use that money to then advertise
[16:15.840 --> 16:22.000]  info wars.com and prisonpunna.com and building big giant super fancy sets I'm just building
[16:22.000 --> 16:28.000]  sets so I can have more reporters working in other areas and you know doing this kind
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.880]  of stuff I mean there's no doubt that when I was critical of Glenn Beck starting four
[16:32.880 --> 16:38.160]  years ago it had an effect and pushed him more towards covering liberty issues so I'm
[16:38.160 --> 16:44.960]  going to speak briefly about that fact I already am and then explain what this clip means this
[16:44.960 --> 16:51.400]  is from his radio show that it's also TV show you know because he says he pioneered having
[16:51.400 --> 16:57.000]  his radio show be a TV show he pioneered exposing his 21 two years ago I did it 17 years ago
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.840]  and again it's not that it's not that I'm always territorial saying I said this first
[17:00.840 --> 17:06.160]  I covered this first it's that it's frustrating to be it haven't implied because when you watch
[17:06.160 --> 17:10.080]  Becky really is a master of manipulation I think that's where he gets under my skin
[17:10.080 --> 17:16.400]  is that I'm just straightforward and when I see someone and I know how media works
[17:16.400 --> 17:21.280]  leaving everything real nebulous in like a 12 minute attack piece on info wars and yours
[17:21.280 --> 17:29.760]  truly that I see that the implication in this is I'm trying to get agenda 21 through here's
[17:29.760 --> 17:30.760]  a clip short clip.
[17:30.760 --> 17:36.880]  If you know agenda 21 you know Alex Jones you piece of garbage I don't know what your
[17:36.880 --> 17:42.600]  deal is I really don't know and I don't care but if you if if you actually cared about
[17:42.600 --> 17:47.840]  the things you were talking about you would you would actually use your brain and start
[17:47.840 --> 17:53.840]  to find different ways than just going to your kook friends in your basement what you
[17:53.840 --> 18:00.320]  would do is you would actually say with some credibility this is true and these are the
[18:00.320 --> 18:05.960]  ways that we can connect with people who may not be kooky friends in the basement is exactly
[18:05.960 --> 18:09.960]  what someone who is involved in the 9-11 conspiracy would say exactly right exactly that's why
[18:09.960 --> 18:14.880]  he's a master of disinformation on that's right that's why that's right it didn't go
[18:14.880 --> 18:20.360]  to the Debris University for nothing if you would if you would like if you like further
[18:20.360 --> 18:25.440]  that's enough by the way I haven't read his book when I heard it was coming out I said

[18:42.520 --> 18:49.080]  now they came to me and they said look at this we say it's $5.95 a month he says that
[18:49.080 --> 18:54.000]  we say the truth is you know here he says that look and they were showing me like dozens
[18:54.000 --> 19:01.840]  of things that were copied exactly from info wars dot com and and just just dozens of examples
[19:01.840 --> 19:07.560]  and I said listen that's a good thing let's not do an article about Glenn back he's not
[19:07.560 --> 19:11.400]  attacking Ron Paul saying the army needs to be called out on his supporters like he said

[19:34.560 --> 19:38.800]  true and all the behind-the-scenes stuff and I can when Glenn Beck got better at covering
[19:38.800 --> 19:41.960]  the new world order I just left him alone even though he was still doing stuff behind

[24:35.480 --> 24:39.560]  on the fiscal cliff and how they're going to try to bring in austerity on the backs of that and
[24:39.560 --> 24:46.040]  exactly what that austerity is going to mean for our future via agenda 21 but those that listen to
[24:46.040 --> 24:54.520]  this radio show know that i very rarely attack other talk show hosts who are even mildly conservative
[24:55.160 --> 25:00.840]  or libertarian because we've got bigger fish to fry george soros the globalist the new world order
[25:01.480 --> 25:07.800]  but glenn beck because i literally see something that glenn beck's done maybe once a month i mean i
[25:07.800 --> 25:11.960]  don't have time to sit there and follow what other people do i probably should i should probably have
[25:11.960 --> 25:17.080]  market researchers and find out what he's doing that's working and copy that i know they copy what
[25:17.080 --> 25:23.000]  i do i've been told by people inside his operation when he was at fox that he had a room full of guys
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.800]  tracking everything we did and we've seen the proof of that and i've been called oh hey we'll
[25:27.800 --> 25:33.000]  meet you at the stakehouse next door don't come over to fox like he were supposed to yeah i'm sorry
[25:33.960 --> 25:38.600]  let me buy you lunch glenn beck's throwing a fit yeah he's going to be big trouble if they let
[25:38.600 --> 25:43.080]  you on any of the fox shows like hey that's fine really you don't care now i've already been on it
[25:43.080 --> 25:50.440]  you know cnn nbc abc i mean that didn't even do that much going on shows like the view i'm like
[25:50.440 --> 25:54.920]  okay i mean i've been on national tv probably a hundred times over the years didn't matter to me
[25:54.920 --> 26:01.960]  but to find out he has that much animosity against me and now he moved to dallas texas i had realtors
[26:01.960 --> 26:05.720]  tell me about it when he was down in austin looking at houses or had his people looking at him i was
[26:05.720 --> 26:12.440]  like don't tell me he's moving to austin and then he moved to dallas um and i'm just like come on
[26:13.080 --> 26:19.080]  pretty soon he'll say alex get out of texas you fake texan because because he implies that
[26:19.080 --> 26:26.680]  i'm helping agenda 21 because of this and i tell you erin dyke's last week went around and warned
[26:26.680 --> 26:31.240]  people and he does this all the time he goes hey this is an ad and i can have a document cam
[26:31.240 --> 26:39.080]  shop people watching on prisonblended.tv um this is a this is a ad uh we'll zoom in a little bit
[26:39.080 --> 26:44.280]  because people can read that uh this is a ad that's the new people on there we're training
[26:47.480 --> 26:52.920]  that is running about a glen backbook but it looks like an official u n agenda 21 eugenics ad
[26:52.920 --> 26:58.680]  saying there's too many people stuff like that and he said it's obviously some type of stunt
[26:58.680 --> 27:03.160]  erin said it's a trap and i'm like obviously he's going to say when people attack him for it that
[27:03.160 --> 27:07.880]  it was bull so we went around and warned everybody but one person we got like six seven people that
[27:07.880 --> 27:12.600]  post and write articles and things just on info wars dot com saturday morning it goes up we had
[27:12.600 --> 27:20.120]  the time stamp 34 minutes it people noticed that it's up it gets pulled down and did glen back on
[27:20.120 --> 27:25.800]  his radio show to millions of people go up there and say oh by the way and another document cam
[27:25.800 --> 27:32.040]  shot on my show viewers now here is here it is from the eighth november 8th all over the web
[27:32.040 --> 27:37.400]  being covered his his commercials being picked up turns out beck wouldn't tell people what they
[27:37.400 --> 27:42.520]  worry created a controversy over two weeks and we found the articles where they made jokes about it
[27:44.120 --> 27:49.240]  okay and they ran them like they were dish network ads and then here's his website the blaze glen
[27:49.240 --> 27:54.680]  beck finally reveals the reason for those u n 21 ads on blaze tv this is the type of deception
[27:54.680 --> 27:59.480]  so he finally reveals he makes it a controversy we get hundreds of emails saying why won't you
[27:59.480 --> 28:05.400]  cover this one of our people takes the bait puts it up we pull it in 30 something minutes
[28:07.000 --> 28:13.800]  here it is 404 error not found down they were watching the site so closely
[28:14.600 --> 28:20.360]  that they grabbed it and and and we somebody took the bait i didn't take the bait you know the news
[28:20.360 --> 28:26.440]  says expose the truth about his n 21 ads airing on the blaze oh he exposes it himself that's on
[28:26.440 --> 28:33.640]  his site look at this out of the globe dispatch glen beck dupes alex jones yeah i guess in a way
[28:33.640 --> 28:38.600]  the buck stops with me i guess you did doot me i mean you didn't doot me but dupes somebody up here
[28:38.600 --> 28:45.160]  so uh there you go so he can then go because it's all a big joke that they duped you know their

[28:55.800 --> 29:03.320]  had it pulled it was up 30 less than 40 minutes i mean this is what i mean the way that mind works
[29:03.320 --> 29:08.680]  so convoluted i mean i could see what he's doing but my brain just doesn't work that way it's it's
[29:09.880 --> 29:14.840]  i'm gonna be honest about going back he just rubs me the wrong way he comes off his kind of post
[29:14.840 --> 29:21.640]  mail and he's what a lot of mainline conservatives like little nasty jokes a lot of sexual stuff
[29:23.320 --> 29:27.880]  you know jokes about alex jones and charlie she and the shower together you know you know made up
[29:27.880 --> 29:34.200]  stuff like that and and it's all part of this effeminance of him that is attractive to the
[29:34.200 --> 29:43.720]  estrogen loaded modern conservative mainline males and it's just all a creepy nerdy post mail thing

[33:51.880 --> 33:56.760]  last few years started covering it into 21 the globalist i remember and we're going to get the
[33:56.760 --> 34:03.000]  clips in this special presentation i'm going to do him saying ron paul's people are dangerous and
[34:03.000 --> 34:08.520]  the army needs to be prepared to deal with them for no reason saying they call it a money bomb it
[34:08.520 --> 34:15.240]  sounds dangerous again playing on his audience is ignorance uh and saying aspartame's good for you
[34:16.520 --> 34:22.600]  wearing weird skull and bones the sonic outfits at events uh he's saying i'm going to expose the
[34:22.600 --> 34:28.120]  fema camps with that fake he loves conning people that you're laughing for a month building up the
[34:28.120 --> 34:34.920]  audience getting the patriot audience whose money he wants whose time he wants but who he hates and
[34:34.920 --> 34:41.800]  i mean just you know the pigginess of it the post-male weird effeminate nelly uh you know male
[34:41.800 --> 34:47.480]  tardism uh i mean you look at him and his co-host i mean this is a group you wouldn't want to hang out
[34:47.480 --> 34:52.840]  with and i mean i'm sorry i haven't talked about him in a long time despite all the stuff that goes
[34:52.840 --> 34:59.480]  on behind the scenes when his gold company did some stuff that's pretty darn amazing and i know
[34:59.480 --> 35:08.360]  about gold i didn't pile in on that i left him alone and he did a lot of other stuff behind
[35:08.360 --> 35:14.280]  the scenes i'm just going to leave it at that and i just take it and take it and take it because
[35:14.280 --> 35:18.040]  quite frankly i'm worried about pregnant women going to the hospital and having their babies
[35:18.040 --> 35:24.040]  blood taken for defense department bio weapons research quite frankly i'm more worried about
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.600]  the fact that there's fluoride in our water i'm more worried about the fact they're trying to
[35:28.600 --> 35:33.800]  start new wars and are surveilling us and purging the brass in the military i'm more worried about
[35:33.800 --> 35:41.080]  the fema camps and the rest of it but you know i get new york daily news rolling stone nightline
[35:41.080 --> 35:46.520]  all these places comparing me to glenn back and even some of them over the years saying i'm a glenn
[35:46.520 --> 35:55.080]  back want to be so i'm not territorial about information but i covered his into 21 in 1997
[35:55.080 --> 36:03.400]  and made a film america destroyed by design that 14 years later or longer 15 years later
[36:03.400 --> 36:10.200]  gives a thousand times literally more information than he does when he talks about his 21 of his
[36:10.200 --> 36:16.920]  documentaries i mean you can see a young felt 180 pound alex jones out there with a camera
[36:16.920 --> 36:24.440]  making a documentary america destroyed by design 1997 and then again in game seven years ago
[36:25.800 --> 36:30.920]  and it's weird to sit there and have somebody go alex jones you're a piece of garbage
[36:30.920 --> 36:36.520]  you know you need to get real information out and and and conflate it that i was basically
[36:36.520 --> 36:43.960]  running down him and saying he was for agenda 21 now i get why one of our people that wrote a blurb
[36:43.960 --> 36:48.760]  off the youtube blurb ran back down and because i don't go around to my few writers and say
[36:48.760 --> 36:52.840]  you will write this you will write that i until it becomes an issue now i'm going to say
[36:52.840 --> 36:57.000]  we've been nice and linked to some of his articles and tried to be friendly no more
[36:57.560 --> 37:05.160]  passata non grata no glenn back unless i'm talking about glenn back here at the info or his operation
[37:05.160 --> 37:10.360]  no more positive no more negative no more nothing okay i'm going to put out one report on him and
[37:10.360 --> 37:16.360]  i'm done but the issue is the reason i have to cover this is because it is a story of deception
[37:16.360 --> 37:21.720]  it is a story of manipulation and cynical laughing hyenas that are preying on their audience
[37:22.600 --> 37:26.920]  and i for one have had enough of it i don't like predators i don't like manipulators
[37:26.920 --> 37:30.680]  i don't like uh people that think they're smarter than everybody i don't like bullies
[37:30.680 --> 37:36.600]  uh and glenn back is an effeminate post mail bully and uh he's not going to bully me
[37:37.320 --> 37:41.080]  despite all this hundreds of millions of dollars he got from charging people five hundred dollars
[37:41.080 --> 37:45.640]  you know three hundred dollars uh to sit there and fawn after him at these events that dwindle
[37:45.640 --> 37:51.160]  down to almost nothing and i'm not trying to be mean about that it's just that you know he is a he
[37:51.160 --> 37:58.280]  is a shell and out of all of them i you don't hear me talk about sean hannity rush limbaugh
[37:58.280 --> 38:03.080]  michael savage i don't really ever have anything negative to say about him even though i disagree
[38:03.080 --> 38:09.560]  with some of what they do but with glenn back this is it four five i mean i remember first
[38:09.560 --> 38:14.120]  hearing him 10 years ago because i was on the same station he was on here what was it 1260
[38:14.120 --> 38:20.120]  before it went sports was my local affiliate in austin and and and i remember my local show on
[38:20.120 --> 38:27.800]  there and i remember hearing glenn back when he first went on wai and it was kind of like rush
[38:27.800 --> 38:33.400]  limbaugh but then he would do kooky conspiracy stuff like things that were bubblegum things
[38:33.400 --> 38:37.880]  that were cotton candy things that weren't real that weren't dangerous it was like rumors and
[38:37.880 --> 38:42.600]  superstition and kind of crystal ball type stuff you'll fold the dollar bill and it does that
[38:43.160 --> 38:49.240]  and i'm like man this guy's a fruit box you know this guy's fruity um so i didn't tune into it i
[38:49.240 --> 38:55.240]  didn't like it and the talking real slow and drawing you out to get any information kind of the
[38:55.240 --> 38:59.480]  you know the uh it's it's like a chip bag where it's 90 percent air and a little chips down at
[38:59.480 --> 39:09.320]  the bottom i'm just not into that and so i did never really follow him and and then i saw him
[39:09.320 --> 39:13.320]  attack ron paul people like hey you need to defend ron paul he's saying the army needs to be called
[39:13.320 --> 39:20.120]  out against ron paul supporters you know there's not a new world order there's not a builder
[39:20.120 --> 39:25.240]  bird group it was kind of like rush limbaugh hey you know the cfr doesn't run anything black helicopter
[39:25.240 --> 39:30.280]  kook detector and i'm like ask so what let him do that you know what that's just what they do
[39:30.280 --> 39:36.360]  but then he began to cover all this but but make it a democratic party conspiracy only
[39:37.400 --> 39:46.040]  and attack yours truly on his radio show and i'm like well that's not cool uh now you want to
[39:46.040 --> 39:51.160]  become alex jones but only partially while running me down
[39:54.600 --> 40:00.520]  and i know bex mad that rolling stone and many other publications went and reverse engineered
[40:00.520 --> 40:06.680]  almost everything he talks about and found out word for word it was researched uh discovered
[40:06.680 --> 40:16.760]  by my researchers my gas myself and put forward so so here it is in a nutshell it's very simple i
[40:16.760 --> 40:21.720]  because of the good lord above your support and friends out there in the media across the political
[40:21.720 --> 40:30.600]  spectrum who actually care about having a future um because of all of us that really want liberty
[40:30.600 --> 40:35.640]  and freedom and are upset about being slaves see that's what motivates us 100 that may motivate
[40:35.640 --> 40:42.280]  back partially but he's an egomaniac he's a domineering no one liked him at fox with him it's
[40:42.280 --> 40:46.440]  all about he's going to be a numero uno if he came from the old radio market model of fighting
[40:46.440 --> 40:51.480]  with the other hosts on the other station i'm not doing that i would love it if glenn back
[40:51.480 --> 40:57.640]  reached a billion people a day instead of a couple million and was the biggest thing since slice
[40:57.640 --> 41:06.040]  bread if he was a real patriot i mean i love other people's success i love world net daily
[41:06.040 --> 41:12.760]  success i love drudges uh phenomenal unparalleled success i love that's why i have other talk
[41:12.760 --> 41:18.600]  show hosts on i like george norrie i mean he he had he's so successful and so confident he had me
[41:18.600 --> 41:24.760]  on 10 years ago and and and and helped us to a great extent and we're still friends of this day
[41:24.760 --> 41:32.280]  more so than ever and i know behind the scenes pressure was put on people through clear channel
[41:32.280 --> 41:39.400]  and premiere by yours you know against myself by you know who to not even have me on other shows
[41:39.400 --> 41:46.360]  just constantly shut alex jones down keep him down don't let him be heard and you know when
[41:46.360 --> 41:52.440]  somebody is rooting against you and when somebody's taking your research and your terms and your
[41:52.440 --> 41:57.800]  and and and and and your promotions and almost everything you do and mixing it around with
[41:57.800 --> 42:04.600]  Oprah Winfrey in a box and shaking it up and and then trying to knock you out man that is really
[42:04.600 --> 42:13.320]  creepy and that's what imposters do that's what imposters basically engage in glenn back couldn't
[42:13.320 --> 42:17.000]  destroy the liberty movement and and say the army should be called out against it it really
[42:17.000 --> 42:23.000]  hurt him when he was at cnn so then he became the patriot leader and had the big events and
[42:23.000 --> 42:27.960]  tried to become the bestionic religious leader as as well and talk about seeking after power
[42:29.000 --> 42:35.800]  he even moved to texas where i live and he wants me out of the way i mean that's what this comes
[42:35.800 --> 42:43.480]  down to uh glenn back knows he can look at the numbers and see that we are exponentially growing
[42:43.480 --> 42:48.200]  from a true organic place without ever joining with the new world order to get power see he joined
[42:48.200 --> 42:53.960]  with the establishment to then get his presence and then realize which way the wind was blowing
[42:53.960 --> 42:58.120]  that there was a bigger market to sell books to the patriots because that's a bigger market than
[42:58.120 --> 43:03.160]  a you know mainline conservative or liberal and went off to do his own thing taking a lot of what
[43:03.160 --> 43:09.960]  we've built and pioneered to a bigger scale great great if you didn't have it out for me because
[43:09.960 --> 43:16.040]  the imposter who couldn't defeat the liberty movement joined it to try to take it over and
[43:16.040 --> 43:21.320]  co-opt it but still alex jones is right there still people are all over his websites when he
[43:21.320 --> 43:27.160]  criticizes us you know i sit there and go hey the elite you know the elite like to kill and rape
[43:27.160 --> 43:31.560]  kids do you hear about the babies with the gold foil you know dozens of them they were trying to
[43:31.560 --> 43:35.880]  ship into the west for rich people to eat that's the kind of stuff they do no i'm serious the elite
[43:35.880 --> 43:40.280]  really eat babies wrapped in gold foil did you see the article well they took a clip out of context
[43:40.280 --> 43:44.360]  where i was saying the bilderberg group was in their eating babies when i said that was a joke
[43:44.360 --> 43:49.480]  in that part bullhorning for eight hours a day outside the deal but it's true any i mean i i go
[43:49.480 --> 43:53.640]  to a joke where i'm the joker you know to talk about the new world order and play the part of a bad
[43:53.640 --> 44:00.280]  guy people say oh that's really alex jones i'm gonna play satan later in the week i just shot
[44:00.280 --> 44:06.120]  something last night it's very disturbing uh because i want to show you what real evil is people
[44:06.120 --> 44:13.720]  say that's who i really am so i get where all this is going and and again i rarely talk about
[44:13.720 --> 44:21.880]  other media people because it feels dirty and it feels horrible and it upsets me to even get in
[44:21.880 --> 44:28.680]  the mindset of i need to become more successful so i can show all these people i need to make more
[44:28.680 --> 44:35.560]  money so i can show everybody that i'm number one you know that hyper dominance when all i want is
[44:35.560 --> 44:42.200]  a future for my children all i want is a republic restored and i don't want a bunch of in fighting
[44:42.200 --> 44:48.040]  with people they're in a liberty movement and i inherently wish that glenn beck wasn't the
[44:48.040 --> 44:54.920]  fake manipulative little bastard excuse my french that he is i mean i mean i wish to god that wasn't
[44:54.920 --> 45:00.920]  the case i want to believe in him and glenn beck you're a piece of garbage you really are a little
[45:00.920 --> 45:11.240]  piggy eyed manipulator and and you can see them in in a in a uh post male frenzy of enjoyment that
[45:11.240 --> 45:18.520]  they're smart and they know how to manipulate people and the fact that he would sit there
[45:18.520 --> 45:25.400]  and 30 less than 40 minutes i got the timestamp here it's like 34 minutes 35 minutes somebody
[45:25.400 --> 45:30.760]  post a video where he's running ads which they now admit were meant to create a controversy asking
[45:30.760 --> 45:37.800]  what are these pro-un population reduction eugenics ads they call them that what is this and then we
[45:37.800 --> 45:42.200]  get hundreds of emails and calls and we're like oh this is obviously something he did as a stunt
[45:42.200 --> 45:54.760]  it's a hoax we don't tell one person about it and it goes up and they're ready to go play the part
[45:54.760 --> 46:02.440]  of the victims and say this let's play this clip one more time uh here is uh glenn beck uh just
[46:02.440 --> 46:08.760]  just after talking about his book on sin 21 shagwaying like like like i'm a piece of garbage
[46:08.760 --> 46:15.240]  that's hurting things by not going with the truth here it is if you know agenda 21 you know alex
[46:15.240 --> 46:20.680]  jone you piece of garbage i don't know what your deal is i really don't know and i don't care
[46:21.400 --> 46:27.160]  but if you if if you actually cared about the things you were talking about you would you would
[46:27.160 --> 46:33.880]  actually use your brain and start to find different ways than just going to your kook friends in your
[46:33.880 --> 46:41.640]  basement what you would do is you would actually say with some credibility this is true and these
[46:41.640 --> 46:46.760]  are the ways that we can connect with people who may not be kooky friends in the basement all right
[46:46.760 --> 46:51.080]  let's stop there with someone who is involved and they go into basically talk about this information
[46:51.080 --> 46:59.720]  folks glenn beck put out tv ads that look completely real like they were produced by the un
[46:59.720 --> 47:06.280]  that that that is word for word what i've told you a global government to forcibly reduce population
[47:06.280 --> 47:15.720]  that's how they describe it on his website they talk about it as eugenics and they say
[47:15.720 --> 47:22.120]  the the tv ads exposing agenda 21 and eugenics eugenics did you ever hear about eugenics for
[47:22.120 --> 47:28.040]  you listen to my show and again i don't care uh you know the most sincere form of flattery
[47:28.040 --> 47:34.200]  is imitation i want to defeat the globalist i don't territorialize this information i get happy
[47:34.200 --> 47:40.440]  when i hear other talk show hosts talking about this but to sit there and put out deceptive ads
[47:41.720 --> 47:49.560]  let it become a controversy and wait i mean watching obviously with google updates is clearly
[47:49.560 --> 47:54.280]  how they knew the minute it goes up they're already on it and so they can come in
[47:54.280 --> 48:02.760]  and freak out after the weekend and i'm told it's still ongoing about how i'm trying to hurt them
[48:02.760 --> 48:08.360]  because they're fighting in 2021 this is exactly what glenn beck did four years ago saying and by
[48:08.360 --> 48:11.880]  the way i'm going to get all the clips back and i'm going to show all the bills and all the
[48:11.880 --> 48:17.160]  confirmations of fema camps and i'm going to show you saying there aren't any and that we're cooks
[48:17.160 --> 48:21.640]  i'm going to show all the things you've done and how you've changed and see i was hoping
[48:21.640 --> 48:26.760]  he'd change for the better and saying hey let's be nice you've heard me let's be nice to glenn beck
[48:26.760 --> 48:33.400]  you know which by the way you'll be more on is good for you you know you are just a little
[48:33.400 --> 48:37.800]  bit bigger than us when you count your radio stations that you have a lot more affiliates
[48:37.800 --> 48:42.120]  that's why on the web uh now for the tens of millions you spent on advertising you have
[48:42.120 --> 48:47.160]  pushed past info wars dot com i don't sit here and get upset by that that's great because i i
[48:47.160 --> 48:53.080]  agree with most of what's on your site the problem is is that you will then turn back
[48:53.080 --> 48:59.080]  and stab us in the back later because you can't help your nature listen i come from a family
[49:00.200 --> 49:05.800]  um of just hardworking protestant christians that helped found this country on the mayflower
[49:05.800 --> 49:11.160]  and then helped found texas and families that have stayed together and worked hard and have
[49:11.160 --> 49:15.720]  been pillars of their community and i i know about your history and i'm sad for you i understand
[49:15.720 --> 49:21.160]  you've had some really painful bad stuff in your life and and i think there may be some good in you
[49:21.160 --> 49:29.560]  but the weird piggy nally you know manipulative garbage isn't going to work so if you want to fight
[49:30.360 --> 49:37.400]  you're going to get one okay because the fact that you'd put out hoax videos going around for five
[49:37.400 --> 49:44.360]  days before somebody picked them up we slap it down i showed people the document cam it's been a
[49:44.360 --> 49:50.440]  dead link since 30 something minutes after it went up and they run around saying we've got him
[49:50.440 --> 49:55.960]  he said something bad about us we're not forage into 21 those are hoax commercials
[49:57.400 --> 50:01.320]  and you know the person that wrote a little blurb on it was just talking about their view
[50:01.320 --> 50:07.720]  that he's a disinformation specialist there to demonize patriots there to go after people
[50:07.720 --> 50:15.480]  and all i could say is i had hoped for the best from glenn beck uh and i had hoped that he really
[50:15.480 --> 50:21.320]  had turned over a new leaf uh i i did challenging videos a few years ago like three years ago
[50:21.320 --> 50:27.800]  saying glenn beck be on the right side of history and i was told by two separate fox news personalities
[50:27.800 --> 50:35.960]  that glenn beck was just beside himself with anger over a really friendly video saying hey you said
[50:35.960 --> 50:41.320]  Ron poll people were dangerous you have the army used on them you said there wasn't fema camps
[50:41.320 --> 50:45.240]  here's the proof man be on the right side of history and i started seeing him get on the right
[50:45.240 --> 50:50.520]  side of history and now he does stuff like this with a sneaky deception so he can play the part of
[50:50.520 --> 50:56.520]  the victim and imply that i'm supporting agenda 21 going after him by the way we carry the really
[50:56.520 --> 51:02.440]  good little book on this by rosa quarry behind the green mask at info wars dot com we have witnessed
[51:02.440 --> 51:07.880]  two terrible storms in the east but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm the most devastating

[54:10.040 --> 54:16.760]  i'm done talking about glenn beck um i do intend to put together a video just showing his flip flopping
[54:16.760 --> 54:23.240]  his deceptions and the fact that uh look if you first say there's not a new world order
[54:23.240 --> 54:26.840]  and then you decide oh people aren't buying that i'll i'll become the leader of the movement
[54:26.840 --> 54:32.120]  against the new world order so we can control that opposition and then oh my gosh but alex jones
[54:32.760 --> 54:37.640]  you know he's the guy talking about eugenics because again whenever beck talks about it it's
[54:37.640 --> 54:42.440]  about how communists want to do it or how the liberals want to do it this is the whole agenda
[54:42.440 --> 54:48.280]  this is billa melinda gates this is ted turner this is all of them and beck will not touch those people
[54:49.400 --> 54:54.040]  and you're not going to beat them if you don't go all the way so i get it i make him passé
[54:54.600 --> 55:01.320]  because i actually go all the way uh and so he's in a hole and he's a 911 truther folks the government
[55:01.320 --> 55:07.720]  runs al-qaeda publicly in libya and syria criminal elements of it got the underwear bomber on the
[55:07.720 --> 55:13.800]  plane that came out in congressional hearings okay the globalist run the terrorist that's
[55:13.800 --> 55:18.920]  my point and they're letting them attack us or staging events or provocaturing them to scare
[55:18.920 --> 55:24.280]  us into submission i mean that is well known and the system is afraid of that maybe i need to talk
[55:24.280 --> 55:29.080]  more about government sponsored terror more about false flags and historical examples
[55:29.080 --> 55:34.600]  because the system is scared to death of it they are so scared because they can't stage
[55:34.600 --> 55:39.480]  events and take your liberties they can't stage a fast and furious and ship guns into
[55:39.480 --> 55:43.560]  mexico to kill people and blame the second amendment because people are looking for it now
[55:43.560 --> 55:50.360]  and expose them it's incredible i just want a future you know what i want i want a future
[55:51.240 --> 55:56.600]  i want a future i want a future you know i was offered the big national syndication deal
[55:56.600 --> 56:02.760]  12 years ago and 10 years ago and eight years ago if i'd sell out i said no i was offered all the
[56:02.760 --> 56:07.320]  stuff that other talk shows were offered i'm sure a lot of them get offered it to get into vex
[56:07.320 --> 56:11.960]  position or hanity's position or limbaugh's position but i've chosen to be on the right
[56:11.960 --> 56:20.360]  side of history and i can't compromise i mean i i can't prephrase what i'm going to say i've got
[56:20.360 --> 56:28.600]  to say what i've researched what my heart and my intellect knows and i've sat here from the grassroots
[56:28.600 --> 56:33.400]  and funded myself to build an organization reaching 15 million people a week thanks to your support
[56:33.400 --> 56:40.600]  and god's support and your prayers but you know what maybe i do need to put on airs i think that's
[56:40.600 --> 56:45.000]  part of it just with the public to then get them to come here the truth i probably need to get around
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.920]  to have those rallies with five six ten thousand people you know i've had them with over two thousand
[56:48.920 --> 56:55.400]  before without even trying uh i need to i guess uh charge people three hundred dollars to come to an
[56:55.400 --> 57:01.000]  event and then land in a private jet and show off to everyone and maybe build a giant set and call
[57:01.000 --> 57:06.840]  the people in that makes cnn sets and do all that because maybe people have to see the packaging
[57:08.040 --> 57:12.600]  you know that that supposedly brings the credibility like like if you're on a fancy set posing as the
[57:12.600 --> 57:17.480]  president like glenn beck does and you come out and expose it to 21 it has all that authority
[57:17.480 --> 57:25.080]  maybe i should wear a necktie but i mean again i i just it's i'm not against making money i just
[57:25.080 --> 57:30.200]  don't want to gouge people five hundred dollars for a ticket to come hear me speak in fact it's
[57:30.200 --> 57:35.160]  almost embarrassing to come out and have two thousand people screaming your name you know and
[57:35.160 --> 57:39.640]  women climbing over the banister to you know get at you and that's what happens now when i go give
[57:39.640 --> 57:44.280]  speeches that i don't even i'm like whoa i'm not going to give these speeches see i don't like that
[57:44.280 --> 57:49.400]  i want to go be a recluse on some mountaintop and just watch you know the grass grow and hang out with
[57:49.400 --> 57:56.200]  my children i'm not worldly ladies and gentlemen people think my aggression is is is ego it's the
[57:56.200 --> 58:02.280]  opposite it's someone angry about being enslaved it's someone angry about tyranny it's someone
[58:02.280 --> 58:10.760]  upset and it upsets me when i see people sold out it upsets me when i see how fallen this world is
[58:10.760 --> 58:17.800]  including myself it upsets me it upsets me greatly but all i know is we've gotten this far because
[58:17.800 --> 58:22.840]  of you and uh we make mistakes we're not perfect and you know we did make a mistake buying into
[58:22.840 --> 58:27.160]  his hoax but we're not making a mistake that he's a disinformation agent he's certainly been one of
[58:27.160 --> 58:32.120]  the past i'm done talking about it we'll put a video together in the next few days you want it back

[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.400]  2 breaking down the new video game with our reporters here at ish
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.680]  i'm elissa melton reporting for info wars nightly news we're here at the black ops 2 premiere and
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.720]  we hope that if you've been following info wars of the past several weeks you've seen
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.400]  we published articles concerning the public perception of drones let's find out what these
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:12.120]  gamers have to say what's like the new coolest thing about this game probably all the new zombies
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:17.080]  i love zombies the gameplay on zombies it's gotta be the zombies there's gonna be zombies in it
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:21.560]  we zombies are back i love playing zombies my reasoning for being here tonight can be summed up
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:27.240]  in one word zombies not see zombies playing zombies again everybody loves zombies what is
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:33.800]  about zombies have you ever heard that the military actually likes to use games like this sometimes to
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:38.200]  recruit people we've heard the story of a 19 year old who was actually offered a job by the
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:44.520]  military as a drone pilot because he got a top score so they monitor that yes they do
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.960]  when they come knocking your door i'm colonel son so i want to give you a job would you take it
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:54.440]  i'm a hat too if i could do that i'll do that today if i could but not to hurt anybody i would
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:59.480]  love i would love the opportunity now i couldn't do it i'm not going to hurt america like that
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:04.920]  man if i get a job like that hell yeah let's do it i'm good shoot who i gotta kill what do you
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:09.640]  think about drone use in real in the real world what are your thoughts on that i think it's actually
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.640]  pretty good i mean it keeps our troops safe did you know in pakistan about 80 of the people killed
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:19.720]  by drones were non-combatants pretty much civilians no i did not know that okay that's not a good
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:25.400]  news though i think any level of civilian casualties is unacceptable our military should be able to be
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:33.000]  being more accurate damn i believe i believe i think that's pretty messed up they're set to release
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.520]  30 000 drones here over americans guys to surveil us and yes they are there's well i think it's
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:44.360]  completely unnecessary i don't see how it's going to make us safer that's certainly scary it's actually
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:48.120]  kind of scary sounding i think it's wrong too of course i did of course i do but the government's
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:53.880]  not right they do a lot of things we don't like i don't see any real problem with drones surveying
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:03:00.600]  us per se because it gives us this kind of sense of security and i don't necessarily think they're
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:05.960]  going to be spying in our backyards and even if they are maybe that's not such a bad thing
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:11.480]  may come do it shoot hell we we get hit we get hit like that'd be kind of cool just as like you know
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:17.160]  security defense whatever but like i don't know someone hacks into them it could be just like in
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.320]  black ops too and they could alter against us and kill us did you know the university of texas
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:26.360]  acts have been able to hack a drone using about a thousand dollars worth of materials have i heard
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:30.920]  of that yeah uh actually no i'm not heard of that that's the main concern if some kids that like
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:36.360]  ut could do that i mean you know terrorists and stuff like what about that now do you plan to go
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:40.840]  to school or work tomorrow man i ain't even gonna go to work i'm just gonna i'm just gonna play my
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:47.240]  game that's it and work i don't work tomorrow i do but uh i'm definitely gonna sleep in yeah i have
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:52.600]  class i have to go okay so you're not gonna stay up all night i mean i'm gonna stay up all night
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:56.600]  did you know one of the games they have tonight as a care package actually comes with a mini drone
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:00.200]  yeah so i was tempted to get that but it wasn't quite my price range so
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:07.400]  some critics say that games like this desensitize people to the real you know harsh realities of
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.640]  war what do you what do you say to those critics i would have to say that their critiques are
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:20.280]  absolutely 100 correct we have absolutely become desensitized to violations we're outside games
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:25.560]  not about to pick up our black ops to care package in just mere moments the care package comes with
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:30.920]  its very own drone a real remote control drone that you can fly around now you've heard us at info
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:35.800]  we're talking about drones several times and we basically came to the conclusion that if big brother
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:41.320]  can fly drones on us we are going to fly drones on them that's why we have hashtag drone mod you
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:45.320]  can follow us on twitter to let big brother know that hey if you're going to keep flying drones on

[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:31.720]  implosion but that's what max keiser and jerald salente and others said what happened that as
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:36.680]  soon as he got in they'd stop propping up the economy scare everybody just like they did four
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:42.840]  years ago to say hey give us more taxes and now they want a vat and a carbon tax that i know you
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:49.240]  exposed in some of your shows but most of it will go to prop up the too big to fail derivatives
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:55.480]  you did a big groundbreaking special on the wall street mafia what is your take on this being held
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:00.440]  hostage that you know if we don't give trillions more to the bankers they'll implode the economy
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:06.680]  well you know i i've never worked at that level to deal with the bankers at that level so i i don't
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:13.560]  have that experience alex but one thing down on the street level i noticed was how right before
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:21.000]  the election the gas prices up here in minnesota just tumbled i mean gas dropped nearly a dollar
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:30.200]  at garland and as soon as the election was over now they're going back up again i found that very
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:35.960]  interesting that you know they've gone up now 20 to 30 cents a gallon back up and you know they
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:42.600]  sold nearly a dollar a gallon before the election oh yeah well about four months ago i saw the article
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:48.760]  where opec led by the saudi said they were going to increase output to help obama well i don't know
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:54.920]  about any of that you know again it uh it's a case of that i don't think it's necessary i think the
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:11:01.320]  same things would happen if romney would have won i don't think it makes any difference no no i agree
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:09.160]  with you but uh the system wanted to get their people back in and then they wanted to drop the
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:15.960]  hammer on everybody afterwards so then say oh my gosh the economy is in all this big trouble
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:22.600]  we need to bring in this whole you know system of more taxes to fix it
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:28.520]  well that's above and beyond me i will say this to alex on a personal note i don't know
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:34.920]  maybe it's because i'm doing your show so damn much uh they tell me now my disapproval ratings on
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:40.680]  polls are near nearly 60 percent well that's not a nice thing to say about my show
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:50.120]  well i was just saying that i'm unbelievable that i have disapproval ratings of nearly 60
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:55.240]  percent no yeah governor you're looking at that wrong all politicians and you know you're not really
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:59.240]  a politician more of a statesman you stand for what you believe that's the definition of a statesman
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:05.720]  uh i'm trying to help others not you know just help themselves but congress has a nine to twelve
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:10.600]  percent approval rating depending on which gallup you look at right but alex i've never had a
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:19.400]  disapprover rating over 20 before never and now i'm up here 60 and i haven't had a graph for eight years i
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:25.560]  don't even know why i was included in these polls because uh obviously they threw me in there because
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:30.600]  i was rattling my sword about running sure well just to expand on that a lot of these polls are
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:36.760]  fraudulent as well uh i understand all that in fact i bet you money i just did a poll last week
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:42.120]  with harris i could go and pay to have a real scientific poll done where i write the questions
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:47.720]  just real very simple you know uh you know what is your favorable or dis favorable view or unfavorable
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:52.680]  view of former minnesota governor jesse ventura just one question put to him and i bet you'd get
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:58.280]  60 plus percent positive uh but uh no i mean it's it's all part of the hatred of government period
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.560]  and just anyone even associated with it is at all time highs even though you say you don't like
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:08.840]  either party it could also be that people get so politicized in the final stretch of an election
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:14.600]  that you're bashing republicans and democrats both sides then get mad at you yeah that's true too
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:20.760]  because if you add up the numbers 60 would be about how many democrats and how many republicans
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:26.040]  there are because it's roughly 30 a piece yeah sure and about 40 uh call themselves independent
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.520]  exactly so maybe it just breaks down that way but i just found it kind of interesting because
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:36.760]  there was a time when i was governor my disapprover ratings were single digit if you could imagine that
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:43.560]  but this is a phenomenon they're seeing where people it's a depression and people are disgruntled
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:48.840]  and anyone seen as successful is also going to be hated now uh it's not only are the elite
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.880]  getting very corrupt the general public by and large is becoming more degenerate that doesn't
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:59.320]  mean everybody it's just that that segment uh is uh i'm sure you've been out on the street and
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:06.680]  seen how people act and behave nowadays right anyway let's let's move on to the show or something
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:12.840]  absolutely i just wanted to get your take on that uh uh yeah the death ray i mean we talk a lot about
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:17.160]  what your favorite episode is and i think they're in the death ray they said last week they were
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.920]  i was on the side doesn't say what's airing tonight do you know what's airing tonight
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:26.600]  no i don't i just looked at my tv and i went to the show tonight and they didn't give any information
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.640]  on what show was airing but according to last week it was going to be death ray so what the heck
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:39.320]  we'll talk about death ray to me the most interesting show to do uh give us 10 minutes of the death ray
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:47.480]  well you know of course nicole pessler allegedly developed one and then uh the government came in
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:53.560]  when he died and took everything he had and my tie into the death ray is this here's my feeling on it
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:15:02.440]  that in the 1980s ronald reagan's main focus was to create star wars which was a system
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:07.960]  to where if missiles were launched at our country we would have the mechanism to destroy them in the
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:14.200]  air before they would ever arrive here by some means be it laser be it whatever where they
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:20.200]  spent billions of dollars to develop this technology for star wars and we never did learn
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:26.440]  were they successful they never came out and told us that all of a sudden just disappeared
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:32.920]  it went off the map and there was no more discussion or talk about it anymore so we as the
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:39.160]  general public were left with well did they create star wars or didn't they and it's of my
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:45.160]  belief i think that they were successful and that they have created it but they're just simply
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:52.360]  withholding that information from us the general public because most of the time whatever level
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:58.040]  the government is at in discovering things or whatever they know they're usually 20 to 30 years
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:05.240]  ahead of what we know and the case in point what's interesting the way to look at that is take a look
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:13.080]  at star trek and all the things in the old star trek movies that are now reality i mean in star trek
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:18.520]  they have the little cell phone things well now everybody on the planet has a cell phone
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:24.280]  and walks around with it just like just like in star trek and they have all these other things
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:29.560]  that they show you in star trek that i believe that have come to fruition today they are a
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:37.880]  reality today 20 to 25 years later so by using that analogy what we know they have today what do
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:43.240]  they really have and in the show i do an interview with john hutchinson who has what they call the
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:49.880]  hutchinson effect well he's a genius never went to school he actually told me he worked on star wars
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:56.440]  and he looked at me and he said the most profound thing to me said do you really believe that people
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:04.520]  like me haven't discovered anything beyond the jet engine for the last 60 years think about that
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:11.560]  they want us to believe they have discovered nothing beyond the jet engine for the last
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:18.040]  60 years i find that very hard to believe alex well i agree with you governor and while you've
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:22.440]  been talking i put up the earlier mainstream articles about in march when the white house
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:28.600]  pressured the saudi's increase oil output they did and i pulled up physics news the army has
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:35.480]  rolled out lightning bolt plasma laser weapons and it looks just like something out of star wars so
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:39.800]  yes now they are rolling more and more of it i had dr steve pacinic on yesterday who worked at
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:45.560]  high levels in the government and he said they're 30 to 40 years ahead with space weapons what they've
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:51.160]  told us and so i think that's part of the governing classes arrogance treating us like animals is
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:57.560]  because they think they're gods now well that that may be you know i don't know but uh i certainly believe
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:02.760]  that they're very secretive on letting us know what they do and they don't have and what they
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:10.120]  what capabilities are out there and uh you know probably but i would say i'm 60 years old now so
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:15.880]  what they have right now i i may not even learn about because i could have shuffled off the
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:21.480]  planet by the time it becomes uh regular knowledge well doesn't under the national security state
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:27.320]  wasn't this going to happen since 47 where our money can be taken unlimited trillions and and then
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:32.600]  in secret develop underground bases super weapons you name it to where now they're just like sit down
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:37.000]  and shut up the congress is told by the secret government the shadow government sit down and
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.880]  shut up and they do it so it's a breakaway civilization is what we're talking about well
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:47.480]  again i'll let you know more about that than i do i would just tell you that uh we have to
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:52.200]  write if they use our money to know everything they're doing that's my opinion well it's not
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:56.840]  your opinion that's law but now they even ignore the fourier suits and the rest of it i mean it's
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:02.520]  just out of control yeah i i would and the only way it's going to get under control is for people
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:08.120]  to stop electing democrats and republicans it's almost like the old greek legends where they
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.520]  said the gods would walk amongst them but had all these incredible powers soon the globalists
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:18.280]  with their sci-fi weapons and stuff will will be like gods amongst us the commoners but they're
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:24.280]  still going to be humans just like us with all the rage all the problems all the everything
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:29.880]  we may end up like atlantis governor and blow ourselves up yeah well we could be getting back
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:35.800]  to the tv show if it's the death rate tonight alex this is also the most exciting show because
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.360]  of course in doing the show we had a fatality that happened
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:46.280]  well we're going to go to break governor and let's talk about more of the death rate straight
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:53.560]  ahead with former minnesota governor jesse ventura i'm alex jones and this is the gcn radio network

[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:15.640]  i was just talking to jessie ventura during the break and he actually was joking about coming
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:19.800]  on my show being unpopular he was pointing out that the minnesota paper there are many apples
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:25.400]  in the poll they're always writing negative things about ventura but i started obsessing over
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:29.880]  polls and numbers i tend to do that but but he brought up the real reason he said he might be
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:36.520]  unpopular locally they only publish the uh the sworn testimony of people that admit they weren't
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:41.240]  even there and weren't witnesses of hearsay that jessie said he was glad us troops were dying which
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.520]  i know he would never say i've been driving along in the car with him when he talks about
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.360]  troops dying he gets a tear in his eye and he's heard that on air he would never say that about
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:52.920]  navy seals that's asinine why would he be there speaking in an event for graduates and then say
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:57.160]  he's glad they're dying i mean if you really said that in navy silbar you would get your butt kicked
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:04.040]  and the point is is that um well you got to tell them because i mean obviously the guy has no
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:09.080]  witnesses that's coming out you just they just opposed you and i mean make the point you made
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:15.000]  to me off air jessie well it's it's just alex i haven't had a time i haven't had my doing court yet
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:21.720]  on that event he's had he's been subscribed all over tv he went ahead and said all the stuff that
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:27.720]  he said last january when i was down in mexico and couldn't even defend myself in fact he would
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:35.880]  offended me you know which i appreciate and uh and so i haven't had my day in court yet and so
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:41.400]  there could be a lot of hostilities towards me i could never redeem the fact of the damage he's
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:47.800]  done but when i have my day in court hopefully the truth will then come out and it will resurrect me
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:53.160]  and maybe my popularity will return a little more yeah but the minnesota papers always had it out for
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:59.160]  you i'm telling you i could have to do a poll and and and have them 90 in favor of you so don't let
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:04.680]  that get you down but i think that doesn't bother me alex i just it just caught me off guard a little
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:10.120]  bit i didn't you know it's it's kind of you know i know but getting back to this you notice it was
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:15.480]  running military precision right when you cross the border yeah in your rv it happens i call you
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:20.520]  once you get to your place in bahaw you say this is totally made up so i had to you know get you on
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:26.520]  via audio skype to defend yourself but i mean look you have been a major presidential contender
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:30.440]  they've done national polls as you know showing that you beat people on a three-way race and you
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:35.880]  were talking about running and they wanted to destroy you and uh so you've got i mean you've
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:40.840]  got to defeat this guy in court and i mean i don't want to give away the you know the goods here but
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:47.960]  uh i'm not i mean i mean i mean if there's any justice you're going to win well i put up this
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:53.080]  you're exactly correct alex because if it gets to the point where you can lose in court
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:27:00.040]  there's an event that never happened well then this country is in my opinion truly lost if you can
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:08.200]  go in the court and can lose over an event that never took place well he also says in the book
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:15.160]  six times that he lies oh yeah oh yeah if you read his book you'll you'll see that he admits
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:20.200]  to lying on multiple occasions unbelievable in closing i'll be back with another 30 minute update
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:25.320]  with us uh next wednesday uh jesse great idea you had to do these updates and we appreciate your time

[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:35.080]  of the death ray episode about tesla coming up tonight because this is this is i think i think
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:40.200]  it's all exciting because i want i want people to watch the show tonight with an open mind and i
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:45.880]  want them to listen to the facts and look at the photographs that we show on this death ray stuff
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:52.840]  especially with its tie in the 9 11 uh the most exciting part of the show to me is the segment
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:28:01.400]  with dr judy wood the physicists from virginia practice uh that part is just intrigues me beyond
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:08.680]  belief in this show but and also the fact that we will give you you'll see how you can defy with

[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:52.600]  that we use dna stolen from babies i've been reporting that for 16 years they declassified
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:56.760]  it three years ago the government takes your blood at birth and puts it in a database and then
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:01.480]  says they own your dna when you go in to get genetic treatment later federal courts have been ruling
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:07.160]  that's how all this stuff came out i've been told this by a nurse working for the pentagon i'll just
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:12.680]  leave it at that back in the mid 90s and did reports on it people didn't believe it then folks the
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:18.040]  government thousands of times has killed us citizens and troops in experiments that were
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:25.560]  meant to be lethal they murder you we've been run by wicked globalist a scientific dictatorship for
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:31.800]  a long time now they're getting ready to launch agenda 21 take over the water the land everything
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:38.440]  stop being naive of course they stage 9 11 it doesn't mean you can't still get upset and
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:45.320]  fear al-qaeda i know it's fun to do that it's fun to hate the others but the thing is those
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:50.520]  globalists run those radical groups it's not that there aren't radical muslims out there
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:58.280]  okay just understand they're using the threat of that to take your freedom and you are the target
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:07.000]  in the homeland security documents that we've broken here on air okay tyrell ventura is our
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.320]  guest here and i just got to say something about jesse ventura before we go to tyrell
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:18.600]  jesse is a real guy i mean he is just a real guy from hardworking blue collar you know roots with
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:25.480]  his you know dad a world war two hero and i know jesse ventura now for eight years i know him pretty
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:31.480]  well and he's the real deal i disagree with some of his politics vehemently but the fact that he
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:37.880]  is real the fact that he's not corrupt and the fact that the system always says he isn't real
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:42.200]  or he's corrupt with no evidence is what makes me mad because let me tell you something i've got a
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:48.360]  lot of problems i'm not perfect the system always tries to say i'm not real or i'm a fake
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:53.960]  or that i'm betraying someone because they're doing that to you and they don't want you to
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:59.160]  know there's real people in this world and that said tyrell ventura who's made a bunch of different
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:05.480]  films tv shows in his own right run camera on the last two episodes done research he's now one of the
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:12.200]  host and reporters on third season of conspiracy theory and he joins us and i was just thinking
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:16.600]  during the break about your dad i didn't intend to get you on and then talk about your dad in fact
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:20.280]  i didn't even tend to get both of you on the same day i was gonna have you on last friday but i didn't
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:24.920]  shut it up so it just so happened that it fell today i looked at the schedule and figured that out
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:30.120]  but uh talking about your dad something i don't know no one's probably ever asked you at least i
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:35.320]  haven't i've never heard you talk about it uh what how how hard is it for you to watch people say
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:40.120]  that he went to a navy seal club and said he's glad navy seals are dying when you know your dad i
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:45.160]  mean i know he would never talk like that and says the opposite on my show when they lie and say he
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:50.680]  got pulled over trying to fly out of an airport when he didn't do that to see the disinformation
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:56.600]  campaign uh and to uh you know see things like that and to see the system using the ignorance
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:01.960]  of the population against people i mean i know you don't want to talk about the case but uh i mean
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:06.600]  how has it affected you and your family to see the national news spread all those lies about your
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:12.520]  family well anytime you you you know anytime you live through you know your father being a governor
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:17.480]  and all the things that are you know said in the in the heat of politics and the smear campaigns
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:22.520]  and things like that you develop a pretty thick skin and you know it doesn't it doesn't affect us
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:28.680]  as a family uh personally you know i mean do you like seeing people spread lies and disinformation
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:34.040]  about your family no of course not but we're we believe in what we're doing and and who cares
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:39.720]  what what what they say exactly well that's my view on it i i'm just so sick of it happening in my
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:44.840]  own life because when you look at the piles of crap that are doing it excuse that term but that's
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:51.480]  what it is it's just you can't believe there are people this dishonorable uh who think it's cute
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:57.240]  and funny when they manipulate people uh it's just the standard tactics that are done in any kind of
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:03.240]  you know political environment you know you you you have to tear down uh the enemy or you you have
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:08.760]  to you know insult people if you don't agree with them it's it's kind of what we've devolved into
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:15.320]  in in our political discourse these days whether it be you know the the incident you know involving
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:19.480]  you know people saying that my dad said horrible things about the navy seals which we all know he
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:26.200]  would never do uh or you know making up the evening speeding tickets or you know when he was governor
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:30.920]  and and the and the you know disinformation and lies were put out then it's just a you know it's
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:37.080]  what we kind of devolve into as a society it's a tmc culture and and that's kind of what they
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:42.280]  prey upon is that people would rather you know people would rather gossip than actually have
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:47.640]  real discussions about real issues exactly and it's a way for little people especially who see
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:51.640]  themselves as little they're not really little people to make themselves better than somebody
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:57.320]  is to just claim their bad so they can feel good and it's something the manipulators are fully
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:01.960]  aware of i want to get into tonight's episode i know in the promo last week they were saying it's
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:06.280]  the death rate tonight but on the site last time i checked it's not saying what's airing tonight
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:10.840]  tyrell do you know what's airing tonight on true it it is death rate yeah for sure
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:15.320]  far as i know unless they changed it last second but i doubt that no it is the death rate episode
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:20.200]  which is essentially an episode of investigation we went into undirected energy weaponry uh you
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:26.200]  know nicola tesla and and things like that and and what you know kind of he was playing with uh
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:32.520]  towards the end of his career and and you know what became of that energy you know what became of
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:39.080]  that technology and free energy and and all of those things that um you know it's powerful it's
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:45.480]  really powerful this episode definitely shook us to the core uh as you'll see tonight there were
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:50.920]  some things that happened during this episode that was that you know was was pretty extraordinary
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:57.240]  even if they're just coincidence um and and it's probably one of the most powerful episodes i
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:03.960]  think that we've done and of course you're talking about a death that happened uh yeah yeah you know
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:07.800]  uh you know could be coincidence might not be i don't know there's nothing that says that it was
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:12.840]  anything more than it was but he died right after you interviewed him correct correct yeah and and
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:16.600]  you know like i said there's not there's no facts that says there's anything more than just
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:21.640]  he passed away uh but it's still always always a very kind of like you know and of course you
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:25.000]  were not supposed to talk about what happened last season either there's been some other
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:31.400]  or i tell you i'm none of this is coincidental it's it's very creepy it's always interesting
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:35.160]  you know when you're when you were when you're working and living in this world you you you
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:39.880]  know you you always kind of you read the news a different way you you react to things a different
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:44.440]  way because you you never know you know and it doesn't you don't want to be paranoid you don't
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:49.000]  want to go around your whole life paranoid and thinking every little thing is is somebody
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.880]  you know how to get you or is a conspiracy but at the same time you have to take a second guess
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:57.880]  and you have to read between the lines just to make sure that that you're not uh that that you
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:02.120]  are getting the full facts you know but this episode is extraordinary i really highly recommend
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:08.280]  people to know i mean i said i think this is the most powerful and i'll be honest uh you know i said
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:13.640]  the things i said about david ike in the last episode playing devils advocate of things i'd
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:19.560]  said in the past but saying i think overall it's good that he's getting people talking and and
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:24.520]  opening up their horizons i mean i guess you could say i was a critic 14 15 years ago
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:29.480]  is they kind of intro me like that but i was it was an entertaining episode uh but kind of a
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:35.800]  bummer because i like you know both people that are involved uh with the uh show uh and i know
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:40.360]  you guys literally did start that david ike investigation you know with an open mind open
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:46.360]  heart i'm i'm i'm sad that it kind of went in that direction but this death ray episode is off
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:50.840]  the chart from what i know about it yeah no it's an extraordinary episode and again it's
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:55.160]  going to be controversial you know like i said a lot of the episodes we did this year might be
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:42:01.080]  a little controversial within the within the the world of people that the research and follow
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:06.360]  conspiracies and and and dig into that world and i know obviously reptilians was last week it was
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:10.520]  very divisive amongst the community because if a lot of people that believe what david ike says
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:14.520]  and you have a lot of people that don't and then you had a lot of people you know saying you know
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:20.280]  how dare jesse even look into something like that but i i i feel very strongly that you have to look
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:25.320]  into everything you can't ignore something even if it feels you know out there fantastical because
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:32.200]  there may be some really legitimate great research being done uh uh within the context of of of that
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:37.160]  i mean do i you know like i said do i do i think that there's shape-shifting reptiles running the
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:44.120]  world no but does that reject the good research that people are doing even if they go to that
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:48.840]  conclusion you know like tracy twyman's research into the bloodlines of our leaders and things
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:53.880]  like that that's legitimate good great research well here's my deal david ike david ike people
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:58.680]  can disagree with some of the things he says the guy really is genuine and that he believes his
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:04.520]  research is accurate and look he said that uh that savel guy was a was a guy bringing kids
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:10.440]  to the royal family and now it's coming out that uh it's it's basically true i mean i tell you i
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:16.600]  wish david ike was wrong because i mean yeah i mean at the same time though david brings it to
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:21.720]  this very otherworldly area which that's where jessie i think had such a major problem with it
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:28.040]  is that you can do great research but but if you bring it to this strange conclusion but is really
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:35.080]  impossible to prove one way or the other you know you you you that the you know what then no no i
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:39.080]  understand i mean that's what i said is that if something's off-world then how do you deal with
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:43.240]  it but the way the globalists have already broken off another breakaway civilization
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:48.200]  under national security with all this high tech stuff built with our ingenuity and our money
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:54.120]  they might as well be aliens i mean the globalists are psychopaths i see a psychopath as alien to the
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:44:00.840]  human race no i agree yeah i mean it's you know it you know are they disconnected from the human
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:06.200]  race in the sense of do they live you know kind of above the law yeah do they live by their own
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:12.040]  rules yeah you know do they care about the rest of us no so i think that's really where you know
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:18.120]  you know you could make that that leap like you're saying you could make that a that kind of jump
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:22.200]  like you're saying you know but it was it was a great episteme and it's controversial it was
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:29.800]  definitely an interesting thing to look into um you know i saw the stuff i did and and it it you
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:36.280]  know it made me aware of that world uh and you know it's like i always say it's it's you know 300
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:41.560]  years ago we thought the world was flat you know in another 300 years we may all be looking at you
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:47.960]  say wow i was right all along you know you never know what you'll discover you know and you'll
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:52.120]  always have to leave your mind open at least a little bit you know to hey you know what we
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:57.080]  don't know everything about how this universe works and about how this world works uh but we
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:02.280]  but at the same time you know you have to be there to say you to put the foot down and say okay here
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:09.080]  and now that doesn't make sense but you know it couldn't 30 40 years you never know what we're
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:14.360]  going to discover tomorrow or the next day tyrell more tidbits uh that you can tell us about the
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:19.080]  episode coming up tonight and why people should tune in well i know that tonight's episode was
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:24.520]  really controversial and actually kind of started uh uh when jessey was on your show what a year ago
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:29.080]  or two years ago um i don't exactly remember the right timeline when he started looking into
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:35.000]  directed energy weapons and then looking into to uh dr judy woods's work and i know that that
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.840]  really upset a lot of the uh the 9 11 uh truthers out there and and suddenly they started attacking
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:45.240]  jessey and saying use a sellout and all these things and you know my dad's always had the
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:51.320]  attitude of like look i'm gonna just do research i'm gonna research these things without a bias
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:58.280]  uh until i feel that either they're true or not and he he never likes to be labeled as part of a
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:03.480]  group and you know one of the things that really upset him was is everyone attacking him for looking
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:08.280]  at judy woods's work when he's saying well wait a minute we don't know that it was there might we
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:12.840]  don't know that it was directed at energy but either way we have to look at all the possible
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:17.800]  scenarios sure let me explain something to you on that because because i mean i think people fighting
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:23.320]  on the internet uh i mean that's just part and parcel of it this is much to do about nothing
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:27.240]  from my perspective we were talking last week and you're like yeah you know i know this is a
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:34.040]  controversial episode but judy would know and i i i am not saying there aren't directed energy
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:38.280]  weapons i'm not saying they didn't have all sorts of stuff to demolish those towers we've got them
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:42.760]  on tape saying get back we're going to bring down seven and the seven blows up classic demolition
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:47.960]  style my issue was if you want to understand this and and and and not the professor i've never talked
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:54.120]  to her out of the gates like five six years ago this was about six years ago i get phone calls
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:59.400]  from other people going prominent people you traitor you better expose it with space beams
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:05.480]  and uh and uh and you better go with this information and and then it was like a way to
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:10.680]  wedge the movement and the media would go with the space beam angle to like try to discredit
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:16.280]  911 truth so i just said look i don't know about this but some of these other professors some of
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:19.480]  these other street people in new york and others i mean i would go to new york and they'd run them
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:25.160]  go cia pig you know the guy the foreign exit get out of there we know you'll cover up the space beam
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:31.800]  that's what my whole deal was i was bum rushed and told you better adopt space beam so i just went
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:36.680]  whoa and it's kind of like six seven years ago this guy sent me an email and said a prominent he
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:41.400]  said you will cover the vatican or i will expose you for working with him and i like sent him an
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:47.000]  email saying well you know go where the sun don't shine buddy yeah i mean you know it's like you
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.600]  know people that want to get on your show they're like i'll expose you if you don't have me on you
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:55.560]  know what i mean oh yeah yeah you know and and it's it's you know jesse came upon that information
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:00.520]  you know he he came upon woods's work you know on his own wasn't told to look into it or anything
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:04.360]  like that he just you know someone had said hey have you checked this out and so he read her book
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:10.360]  and said wow this is a pretty interesting plausible theory and jesse's mind as he read her book uh and
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:15.800]  i know i had a big problem with it because i'm i'm i would for a long you know i i firmly believed
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:21.160]  in the thermite you know definition and and and and you know the good research that's been done that
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:25.480]  way today as i said you know even after like i said you gotta watch the show tonight because
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:29.960]  it's really compelling stuff today i said kind of at a crossroads because i say you know both side
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:34.840]  both alternative theories have some weight you know the point is the official story isn't true
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:39.800]  and that's another official story isn't true yeah exactly but i mean not woods not woods but some of
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:46.760]  the others savagely attacked uh dr steven jones and others when when when there's evidence of
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:52.120]  conventional explosions as well especially building seven and see that's what i mean it was like a
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:58.760]  takeover very aggressive and so when people heard ventura say hey i'm looking into that side
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:04.200]  you know because because of the aggressiveness of that movement that that's why people turned
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:09.080]  against it i got you yeah no and you know that's one of the things i think that that's so important
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:13.480]  especially in looking at people's reactions to these last two episodes and i think their reactions
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:19.880]  nice episode is you have to do the research you have to look into every possible thing
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:23.960]  before you can discredit something or before you can credit something and that's what we're
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:28.920]  trying to do this season is saying you know what on some of these bigger issues let's look at like
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:33.640]  we spent we've done two seasons with nine eleven and we last season we spent doing nine eleven
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:38.920]  looking at thermite and and looking at the pentagon you know here's another option and it
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:43.560]  happened to fall into something we were already wanting to get into which was nikola tesla
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:48.840]  and and and the work that he's done and potentially what happened to his work uh and so it was kind
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:53.880]  of an an interesting you know road that we went down and said oh wow you know this kind of ties into
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:50:00.440]  what judy woods was talking about and then when you see the experiments actually work it really is
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:05.240]  a it's very kind of chilling you're kind of like ooh that that there might be some some some reality
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:09.400]  that but it's very important for us all when we're doing you know when we're when we're investigating
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:14.440]  these things is to not fight with each other to say okay well what's one information do you have
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:18.440]  okay that's interesting i have this information over here and instead of being at each other's
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:24.360]  roads we should all be working together no i agree people get very very territorial uh but again
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:29.000]  minus that person you're talking about the rest of that crowd it was a very vicious that you will
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.040]  cover this or your disinformation so i think then jesse got in on the tail end of that kind of the
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:39.640]  boomerang of people then not liking anybody that that you know was pushing the uh the particle
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:44.360]  beam or direct energy weapons theorem uh when we come back ty i want to get your take on the
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:48.040]  election where you see america going the financial meltdown then i'm giving the number

[01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:03.640]  it's more there just to kind of you know show that we're in control and show that the terrorists can't
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:07.880]  get through but it really doesn't you know it's not really going to solve anything i wish that
[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:12.120]  that stuff could have seen the light of day uh because there's a pretty powerful amazing episode

[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:08.040]  newsmaking well what happened with with cherd off and i'll give i'll give cherd off a lot of credit
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:13.240]  he stood his ground he answered the questions he didn't shy away he didn't you know do the usual
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:17.000]  like oh i'm going to run away from the interview or anything like that you know he has his convictions
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  and his beliefs and i think that he truly believes in what he's talking about he might be a true
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:26.440]  believer in the bank account that's getting bigger yum no exactly that too you know uh but no i i he
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:31.880]  was speaking up in san francisco and and and we got up there with the cameras and then he sat and
[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:36.520]  talked with me for about a good you know i'd say about a good 10 minutes about the tsa and about
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:41.640]  the security measures uh that we're taking it was a very good interview and um you know within the
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:46.840]  context of that interview we we you know he you know fired back with his beliefs i said look you
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:52.920]  know what about you know the fact that that really it is just security theater and and he you know all
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:59.640]  but admitted that like yes in a way it is it it's it's it's a you know we're we're presenting security
[02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:04.280]  in his mind which was you know i didn't believe what he was trying to to frame it as is that you
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:10.120]  know the the level of security yet is it not is it going to stop every terrorist no they can find
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:14.760]  holes in it but really it's the appearance of it is what scares people away but really i think what
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:18.920]  he was saying essentially or what i you know what i took from that was that really at the end of the
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:25.320]  day it is just security theater it's it's not really designed to be uh used to work it's
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:30.520]  it's designed to condition us to accept being slaves and and and the government got the underwear
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:35.160]  bomber on the stinking plane because it's like i said damage like well what you know okay we have
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:39.240]  all these people in these huge lines and you congregate us all together is 200 people waiting
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:43.480]  go through these security lines what prevents the terrorists from just walking into the line and
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:47.960]  setting a bomb up and killing just as many people as he would on the airplane and his answer back to
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:52.520]  me was well that's up to the airports to figure out logistically and how to solve that all right
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:56.760]  let's see i'll pass the buck let's expand what other areas are covered i know about the cancer
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:01.560]  and the scanners yeah we went into the cancer you know we went into the scanners and how you know
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:06.680]  there's been cancer clusters and with with tsa agents in boston things like that that you know
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:11.720]  they're trying to prove i believe that there may be a court case about that um you know bear with
[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:16.920]  me this is about a year ago now that we did that but no no they've proven it it's just that yeah
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:21.880]  now they're trying to prove that it's the scanners that made it have the seven-fold increase correct
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:27.240]  correct and and and there's very real good research that says that that that more than likely is is
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:31.560]  the possibility of it how does it feel to do all that work and that would have been a big nationwide
[02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:36.680]  interview that would have made newspapers everywhere that would have been good work to warn people
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:41.720]  and and and then to have it shoved into a black hole well i'll put it to like this alex was was
[02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:48.600]  there production reasons that born uh uh that had nothing to do with censorship involved yes uh do i
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:53.720]  think that you know time warner and and and true tv or a little hesitant given you know what happened
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:04:00.040]  with the with the uh police state uh episode that probably played into it as well uh i think that
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:05.080]  one of the things we learned in doing these shows is that when you talk about a conspiracy that's
[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:11.240]  already happened they're not as concerned when you talk about conspiracies that could happen or
[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:16.600]  are on the docket or are going to happen uh that's when suddenly everyone gets really nervous yeah
[02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:20.760]  when you talk about the bank being robbed right now that's what the bank robbers care about they
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:25.080]  don't care if you talk about a bank robber that happened five years ago mm-hmm very well said
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:30.840]  no that's it you know and i noticed that trend with a lot of our shows that that you know the
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:34.360]  shows that take place you know that we're dealing with something that happened in the past not as
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:38.920]  big deal still controversial not as big deal when you deal with stuff that has yet to happen
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:43.080]  that's suddenly when you know it's harder to get the interviews or you got to fight a little bit
[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:47.640]  more to get get things on the air and things like that uh one of the things i'm hoping for is and
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:53.400]  then this is up to the fans let true tv know you want these shows on dvd you know we got to get

[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:15.640]  this story because i talked about this a little bit yesterday it's an info wars.com uh paul joseph
[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:22.280]  watson article and again i mentioned it but i didn't get into it it's such a big deal to just show
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:27.080]  how far we've gone because the same thing's now happening in areas of europe this is the agenda 21
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:33.720]  system we're under environmental rules you're not allowed to have your own family farm your kids
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:41.800]  aren't allowed to do chores but mega corporations are all exempt from this sandiego residents face
[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:48.360]  six years in prison for washing their car and if you want to show folks a document cam i'll put it
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:53.800]  right over here everybody to see that right there sandiegans could face six years in prison
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:11:01.480]  and face a hundred thousand dollars a day for washing their cars in the driveway or failing
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:08.120]  to pick up dog poop under new epa mandated environmental regulations related to water quality
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:13.880]  and the you've seen the green police had that out he ran and then the mayor of san francisco
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:17.400]  bragged that had been produced in san francisco and that's what they were really going to do
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:21.720]  and that's even the real uniforms listen we already have the biggest prison population
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:26.200]  they're going to take everything you got okay they're coming you want to cross pc's engineer you
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:30.920]  want to dump toxic waste you want to do whatever you're fine if you're a big globalist corporation
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:35.560]  but if you're an individual if your kid drops a battery in the backyard your neighbor sees it
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:39.480]  on accident you're going to spend time in prison they're going to or they're going to take everything
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:45.000]  you got home inspections bureaucrats cops putting cameras in your yard without warrants that's
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:50.280]  already happening police dogs coming in without warrants drones watching you warrantless wiretaps
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:56.360]  the cia director spied on by the fbi just wall to wall evil street lights with microphones and
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:02.440]  cameras watching you and it goes on here although residents of the city and this is in the local
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:07.080]  newspapers we have links to it where they report it with a straight face although
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:13.880]  residents of the city are forced to drink toxic waste in their water supply the form of sodium
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:18.040]  fluoride and hundreds of other chemicals they add they make you pay for toxic waste from chemical
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:21.560]  plants and they call it an additive and put medical additive and put it in there and forcefully
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:27.080]  medicate you measures imposed as a consequence of the environmental protection agencies clean
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:34.760]  water act would turn the mundane of activities the most mundane of activities into a criminal
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:40.600]  offense quote california's latest experiment in faith-based policy making is being unleashed today
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:47.480]  on the san diego public a regional water quality officials not servants began hearings on new
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:58.600]  regulations that seem crafted to turn post to turn most owners of cars house or dogs into criminals
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:05.560]  within a decade or so we wish we were exaggerating reports the north county times under the draft
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:13.240]  rules ordinary homeowners may face six years in prison and fines of one hundred thousand
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:20.440]  dollars a day if they are deemed serial offenders of such new crimes as allowing sprinklers to hit
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:28.280]  the pavement washing a car in the driveway or conceivably failing to pick up dog poop promptly
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:34.200]  from their own backyards let alone the sidewalk and then they're putting these meters with RFID
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:39.080]  scanners on the trash cans in miami and other areas same thing in england then they have
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:45.720]  citizen spies that get percentages of the money to come dig through your trash the regulations
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:52.360]  will be enforced for the eight of 24 hour telephone snitch line with residents of san diego's south
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:58.040]  orange and south side riverside counties can use a report on their neighbors for violating the new
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:06.200]  code the new rules could even force firefighters to collect the water they use to douse burning
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:12.040]  buildings yeah they're going to tie us up in such bureaucratic red tape that we just totally collapse
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:17.480]  while china india and a hundred plus of the third world countries are totally exempt and
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:22.840]  we've got suicide nets around their factories and abortuaries inside where they force abort people
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:28.760]  that get pregnant i mean this is in the news mobile execution vans you name it in china
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:34.680]  that's what we're competing against and this is the system that they are bringing in and
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:39.320]  and again they're just going to keep rationing it up rationing it up government telling you
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:43.160]  you can't pack lunches for your kids government's saying they got cameras in the school bathrooms
[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:53.000]  watching your kids it's beyond 1984 and we just comply and comply and comply they say hey dust
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:59.000]  in a barn two thousand dollar a day fines i've seen we've got to dig these up and put them on
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:04.680]  some of them are on the internet from 96 97 on my access tv show where old people would call me and
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:10.840]  say i'm over here on west 37th roland ellison they're giving me two thousand dollar a day fines
[02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:16.280]  this week because my grass was too high i even went and mowed it and they're still giving me more
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:22.600]  and i went over there he had three inch grass he was in a gentrifying area with yuppie
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:28.200]  living around him who wanted his property it turned out and then we a good police officer called me
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:32.120]  and said here's two city council people's houses they've got like three foot grass the middle of
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:36.360]  the city and i went over there and showed that they backed off and i went to the health department
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:42.360]  with two foot grass but the point is two thousand dollar a day fines it said weeds and other objectionable
[02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:47.640]  material that's how they're now arresting people for gardens all over the country they say we find
[02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:53.880]  it objectionable we are god well now it isn't going to be two thousand dollar a day my grandfather
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:58.200]  my dad and my dad looked at it i looked at it i advised him to fight it my grandfather just climbed
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:03.000]  over and did it they had a drainage ditch behind their house not on their property with a government
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.720]  easement off the highway and they started sending him two thousand dollar a day fines when he was
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:12.440]  seven something years old saying you will clean out the brush that's flooded even though it wasn't
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:17.880]  from his yard or we'll keep finding you not a bill to clean it up even though that was a fraud
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:23.000]  he climbed over worked on it drug it out had a heart attack and then was in all screwed up for
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:30.680]  about five years till he died but the point is this is the scum of the bureaucrat code enforcer who
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:35.800]  will now put you in jail for six years hundred thousand dollar fine and you've heard about the

[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:50.600]  sick woman i was a former glenn feck viewer and listener i until i stumbled across one of your
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:27:00.040]  youtube channels and found out that i'm not being told about gmo's i'm not being told about the
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:10.120]  police state the uh false flags and blackouts uh the uh the most and the mafia that is the the
[02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:21.000]  pharmacy industry i just uh agenda 21 uh but here's the good news we're forcing him to cover it now
[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:28.600]  that's why he implied that i'm trying to cover it up because because he he has to tell more and more
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:35.720]  of the truth if we're here i mean we're all that stands in his way of a monopoly he sees as a business

[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:31.720]  an article thinking maybe we could get him to realize that aspartame is known to cause that
[02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:37.000]  and major scientific studies we wrote an article linking to the studies uh we we sent it to him we
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:42.600]  sent it to matt drudge matt drudge who cared put it up i'm sure thinking oh hey here i'll try to help

[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:33.560]  our caller we were just talking to and i was intending to have steve shank in here to talk
[02:33:33.560 --> 02:33:39.560]  about the economy but his plane got late but he literally came in here 60 seconds before we went
[02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:43.560]  into this segment so we're going to be able to have him here with us and also do an interview on
[02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:50.040]  the nightly news it's always an honor to have him here because he has forecasted so much of what is
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:57.720]  now unfolding again we were just talking to cupcake a lady calling in i don't want to get
[02:33:57.720 --> 02:34:02.520]  into bashing glenbeck okay he comes out and calls me a piece of garbage and implies because he put
[02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:08.360]  out fake g21 ads that i was trying to just defame me when we posted a link to it for 30 minutes one
[02:34:08.360 --> 02:34:14.760]  of my webmasters we had it taken down 30 minutes in because i could tell it was satire but but he
[02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:19.880]  put it out there so people be confused then he attacks me that's not my issue with glenbeck okay
[02:34:19.880 --> 02:34:26.360]  my issue is that he sees it as we're in competition and i'm not in competition with glenbeck okay
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:32.360]  that's this is not about alex jones being you know king of the hill um so i don't want to digress
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:39.160]  off into that but yes four years ago glenbeck would say uh that ron paul supporters are dangerous
[02:34:39.160 --> 02:34:42.040]  and that's why they're getting the army ready to be put them on the streets i've played the clip
[02:34:42.040 --> 02:34:46.600]  before i'll put a video together he would say there's no new world order now he says he's the
[02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:51.640]  king of it and he's the guy exposing agenda 21 and and implies i'm trying to stop him or something i
[02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:56.120]  mean and then i'm in a basement so i don't know what to say to any of this and i didn't mean to get
[02:34:56.120 --> 02:35:02.760]  off into it but she the lady was just listing uh you know different facets different reasons different
[02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:11.080]  examples different uh everything uh that feed into all of this and and why it upset her when she
[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:16.280]  first heard glenbeck but then realized he wasn't telling her all the other issues that are going
[02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:19.960]  on like beck will now talk about eugenics i mean i'm proud of the fact that i've forced eugenics
[02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:29.240]  along with my listeners out to be a major issue now uh but at the same time uh then he never
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:34.680]  tells you the rockefellers and the roth childs and the depopulation and the full story he tells
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:40.120]  the democratic party wants to do this no no this is a global government takeover announced
[02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:49.800]  a real fast finish up cupcake well i yeah and i he is always uh talking about how to love
[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:57.560]  your brother and uh how we need to help each other and i as your son i heard your son yesterday
[02:35:57.560 --> 02:36:06.200]  and it gave me goosebumps and it makes me think i you know this is what it's all for i and Matthew
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:13.560]  said and judge not that you be not judged but also i just wanted to quickly say that i i have
[02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:21.480]  got i bought into the uh vaccine and the whole h1 in one back in oh nine and uh took the shot
[02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:30.280]  um i have been very sick ever since with uh with uh i i've got autoimmune disorders that
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:36.280]  they can't identify i've got rheumatoid arthritis all of a sudden uh high blood pressure atrial
[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:41.720]  population i've got infasema i've got all these illnesses i was a i was a healthy woman
[02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:48.200]  and now i know it's incredible the insert says it does all that to you and then they get on the news
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:53.320]  and say there's no side effects that's what i want to cover and that's what these neocon talk show
[02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:57.720]  host won't talk about and that's what makes me so angry is it's not just you you've gotten to
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:37:02.840]  live some life they're doing this to little kids now with these vaccines and the gmo and it makes
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:09.080]  me angry and then to see a bunch of establishment types now trying to co-opt the movement that
[02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:15.080]  we've built over decades people like steve shank ron paul geber griffin countless others is very
[02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:20.920]  frustrating and cupcake you should go on youtube you should shoot videos your testimony everybody
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:26.680]  damaged by these vaccines everybody damaged by big pharma our voices cannot be shut down that's
[02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:31.720]  why they want to shut us down is because we're so powerful all of you have power all of us together
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:35.880]  will defeat these people god bless you good to hear from you well i tell you steve shank is here
[02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:41.080]  a vfoodsdirect.com i was super nervous excited about getting you in here today
[02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:45.560]  because people have really loved the interviews you've done and you've been very very kind
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:49.800]  to come back in studio with us and we'll have to do another interview after the show since
[02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:53.720]  your plane got delayed but better when we weren't late you showed up one minute before but it was
[02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:58.280]  still we weren't ready because we thought you were going to show up after but so much going on
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:04.120]  with food what an example where the preppers are bad the media told us but the new article out
[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:09.400]  today by paul watson i haven't even mentioned photo shows that will punch this up on screen for tv
[02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:15.320]  viewers but it's in the featured news area of prison planet dot com and info wars uh dot com
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:22.280]  if you go to info wars dot com just punch it up on your computer in there uh the headline uh there
[02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:29.080]  just you know you can just do it on you can just do it on your computer in there uh is what i was
[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:37.480]  saying uh you can punch up uh right there on the screen where fema had to get its food from
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:44.760]  the local churches and volunteer groups and we all saw the sign last week uh where it openly said
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:51.880]  openly said uh that fema is closed in new york and new jersey for bad weather that was the sign
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:55.880]  we're gonna we're gonna show those on screen but steve shank i mean it is just incredible what's
[02:38:55.880 --> 02:39:03.080]  going on well very simply alex uh we've got a situation that you and i talked about the last
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:09.240]  time that we're here and that is the fact that the governor government has made commitments
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:15.880]  to feed a tremendous number of people now just recently they came out with the numbers for the
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:22.120]  people on food stamps normally this is brought out very at the very beginning of the month
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:29.560]  but oddly enough we're not hearing about the people that are on food stamps the increase
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:37.800]  of over 400 000 people all coming up on a half a million people in one month's time
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:46.760]  going on food stamps and then we find out that just in the last few days people in Ohio which
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:55.320]  by the way was a swing state are being notified that their food stamps are being cut back by
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:40:01.080]  fifty dollars a family now you put this whole thing together what we talked about before
[02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:13.960]  was food is food is the medium of power worldwide and nationwide now if you'll if you'll remember
[02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:25.560]  the movie lion king what happened the the bad guy you know went out and he talked to the scavengers
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:34.520]  of the earth basically the hyenas and he said stick with me and you'll never be hungry again
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:43.640]  interesting thought isn't it now what we have is a lot of people who are unemployed a lot of people
[02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:50.120]  who are not employable we have a tremendous number of our population right now about half
[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:58.200]  of our population one way or another is needing help with their food now all the commitments
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:05.720]  that are made to feed all of these people that are in the position of not providing anything to
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:14.840]  the economy is being made by the government which has no food we found that out in Katrina we found
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:23.480]  out found that out way back in Edward and we find it out now they have no food but yet they're
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:30.680]  committing that they are going to take care of everyone let's go back to lion king stick with me
[02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:38.280]  and you'll never be hungry again but what happened when all of the producers were forced as the
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:44.920]  lionesses if you remember the story were forced over a period of time to constantly feed all of
[02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:55.880]  these others then we had total starvation in that movie what do you think is going to happen right
[02:41:55.880 --> 02:42:05.320]  now we have the greatest depression that this country's ever seen we have the greatest drought
[02:42:06.280 --> 02:42:12.040]  remember we've talked time and time again alex about the fact that worldwide we've got the seven
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:20.200]  year famine this is the last year of it just before the election we heard a whole lot about
[02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:25.560]  how people were being taken care of you talked about how everyone was being given cell phones
[02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:32.040]  at the expense of the people that were paying for their cell phones we've got all of this stuff now
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:40.280]  i want you to jump jump with me to the colors by the by colors i mean what party is represented
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:47.800]  by red what party is represented by blue okay right now the conservatives are represented by red
[02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:59.880]  the the liberals are represented by blue remember the movie matrix if you took the red pill you
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:09.080]  understood what was going on if you took the blue pill all is well in Zion so what's being what's
[02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:17.240]  happening is we have in this country a reversal polarity is on those colors now i know this
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:22.360]  sounds like i'm i'm rambling no i'm riveted what are you talking about very very interesting take
[02:43:22.360 --> 02:43:30.680]  over the show you see what happens is in every other country the the radical liberals are represented
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:38.440]  by red okay and the conservative the let's let's take care of our own bases and take care of
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:47.160]  ourselves and be responsible is represented by blue it's been reversed in this country and it's
[02:43:47.160 --> 02:43:58.120]  been reversed just in the last 10 years and so what we're having here is we've got the movie matrix
[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:05.640]  and i believe that if you look at lion king if you look at the story behind lion king you have
[02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:12.680]  a foreshadowing and a prediction of exactly what's happening here and what happened after
[02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:21.480]  after the bad guy the bad lion you know said to all the hyenas hey stick with me and we'll
[02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:27.640]  take care of you and then they forced the workers the lionesses to go out and hunt for everybody
[02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:36.440]  and pretty soon the land was the land desolation this is what we are seeing before our very eyes
[02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:43.480]  and they've even we even have the colors representing the opposite of what they should well
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:47.880]  expanding on that that's because the lion king obviously is basing on what other governments
[02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:52.840]  have done what socialists and communists have done mal did it linen did it stalin did it fidel
[02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:59.080]  castro did it chavez is doing it every time they do this it doesn't matter of the poor actually
[02:44:59.080 --> 02:45:06.840]  getting poorer they like misery you know you misery likes company and it is about a wrecking
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:10.920]  and a pulling down and once people get dependent it's over they don't know how to do anything but
[02:45:10.920 --> 02:45:15.480]  mill around and not even know how to tie their shoelaces and then they hate those of us that
[02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:19.640]  have energy and will actually work well the interesting thing that you're dealing with
[02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:29.080]  with is while people are hungry if people are hungry they can no longer listen to the wisdom
[02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:34.600]  of the ages they can no longer no longer think they can no longer have feelings and they can
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:42.200]  no longer rebel basically starvation is always always has been is now and forever will be used
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:50.120]  and you see what we're seeing with the promotion of do you realize do you remember we talked the
[02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:54.520]  last time you and I were together we talked about the fact that they were actually advertising for
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:46:00.040]  people to get on food stamps they had this little old lady that said well can I get food stamps if I
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:06.680]  have a job can I get food stamps if I have a car can I have food stamps if I have a home and the
[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:13.160]  answer was oh yes go and what it really is is a government card that gets to your food getting
[02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:19.240]  you ready for a government card cashless society and it's all admitted while the police state goes
[02:46:19.240 --> 02:46:24.840]  in while they shut down the family farms while they put in agenda 21 to shut down the rural areas
[02:46:24.840 --> 02:46:31.320]  this is exactly how the Soviets took over Poland and Ukraine well I guess maybe you know my daddy
[02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:39.400]  used to say sometimes for those that have ears to hear and eyes to see the handwriting is on the
[02:46:39.400 --> 02:46:47.160]  wall but if you if you don't have to be politically aware now you see what you've been doing for your
[02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:53.640]  entire career the thing that people like about you and the reason that you come at our attack
[02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:59.240]  you know another thing that I've learned a long time ago I've got you by a couple of years just
[02:46:59.240 --> 02:47:03.800]  a couple yeah but anyway I learned a long time ago that if he ain't getting kicked in the butt
[02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:11.320]  you ain't out ahead at anybody but what you've been doing is you've been raising the voice of
[02:47:11.320 --> 02:47:18.840]  warning you literally have been the voice screaming in the wilderness for people to listen but one of
[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:25.400]  the things that we were talking about just this last conversation we had is you can warn people
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:31.320]  but you can't feed them that's why what we're doing right now trying to get the message out this
[02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:36.120]  last this last little sec 60 second spot that you cut is absolutely phenomenal because it
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:42.280]  puts it right where it is it's telling people why you're doing what you're doing now you can't
[02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:49.800]  convince people to to take care of themselves but you can warn them but you can't feed them well
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:55.400]  that's the issue I'm digging in I've got the storable food not because I'm a coward but because I
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:48:01.480]  want to provide for my family people don't understand this is a diabolical takeover I said as soon as
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:06.440]  Obama gets in they're going to drop the economy he was just given a speech there he today they're
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:13.160]  promoting carbon taxes it's it's in Forbes it's in Reuters EPA's insanely ambitious agenda that
[02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:20.120]  Obama's reelected carbon taxes to fund the derivatives that's the banker's debt they want to shut this
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:27.320]  country down well very simply if you remember way back before the first election the the speeches
[02:48:27.320 --> 02:48:36.040]  that were made indicated that that we were not going to be able to run a coal fired electric
[02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:40.600]  plant in this country because they would tax it out of existence he said I will bankrupt you
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:48.360]  that's right I will bankrupt 51 of our power I mean he said that okay now if you want to if one of
[02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:52.200]  all these idiot things going to happen when they shut them all down the power prices are already
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:58.840]  exploding I'm sorry yeah but listen you like to come on the air to talk and and some of those videos
[02:48:58.840 --> 02:49:03.320]  we've done on the nightly news are so popular you're one of our big sponsors because I researched
[02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:07.240]  and found the best horrible foods company the best prices there's a lot of talk out there folks
[02:49:07.240 --> 02:49:12.920]  eat foods is the place good healthy clean quality food without all the additives and garbage
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:17.480]  but every time I get you here you never even want to plug eatfoodsdirect.com and the specials
[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:23.240]  at eatfoodsdirect.com slash Alex but I'm going to plug them I don't have to you can barely make
[02:49:23.240 --> 02:49:30.040]  enough food yeah this is this is not the job that you and I have some it's to warn people
[02:49:30.040 --> 02:49:35.880]  somehow or another we have to hit these folks over the head with a two by four to get them to realize
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:42.440]  we had Edward they had to go out and get 70 000 MREs from a from an army navy supply store
[02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:50.040]  we had Katrina people didn't get fed for a long period of time there is no food I told you about
[02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:56.600]  the the experience that I had when I was on my radio show or we had people call in and they actually
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:50:03.720]  took trucks down to the area that were empty and they they scavenge food from the from the school
[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:09.800]  lunchrooms and freezers to feed the people look we may have FEMA can't even take care of people
[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:14.920]  and FEMA's got to go to the churches to get food there you go I mean this is unbelievable what
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:23.320]  they've turned us into well but but what if you want to take the if you want an example of exactly
[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:30.440]  how things are going look at food stamps before the election we advertise to get as many people
[02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:35.800]  on food stamps as possible get as many people dependent and get all those voters that are
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:41.480]  marginal in terms of being below the poverty line no they want you in poverty they want you in the
[02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:46.040]  system the answer is folks and they've said this during a total collapse they're going to tell you
[02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:51.400]  turn your guns in for food that's the plan and you know if you have your own food you want to

[02:54:22.520 --> 02:54:26.360]  by the way uh steve shank wasn't going to be on the nightly news tonight but i've got to go over
[02:54:26.360 --> 02:54:31.640]  interview you because you've got a bunch of breaking news about food consolidation i remember you
[02:54:31.640 --> 02:54:35.960]  like five years ago shane all this was coming because you're you know the biggest manufacturers
[02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:41.080]  out there were the biggest i guess now these mega conglomerates are forming but we got 28 million
[02:54:41.080 --> 02:54:47.880]  conservatively people unemployed 48 million on food stamps and growing and growing qe3 devaluing
[02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:55.160]  the dollar nearly half the country is on some sort of food subsidy uh 220 000 people fall
[02:54:55.160 --> 02:55:00.920]  below the poverty line every day 48 million americans on food stamps uh millions of american
[02:55:00.920 --> 02:55:06.680]  children are growing uh to bed hungry every night i mean this how did america turn into this well
[02:55:06.680 --> 02:55:12.920]  we got a big government and it made a bunch of dependent people and now it is all going to accelerate
[02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:19.000]  how bad do you think it's going to get steve i don't know i think it's going to get very interesting
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:25.880]  but you asked before the break where i think this was going and let me answer by this i'm not going
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:31.240]  to tell you where i think it's going to go i just want every one of your listeners to go and watch
[02:55:31.240 --> 02:55:39.960]  the movie lion king because at the point where scar got his power and took over by asking the hyenas
[02:55:39.960 --> 02:55:47.960]  the non producers to support him at that point where they forced the lionesses to go out and hunt
[02:55:47.960 --> 02:55:54.120]  and provide for everybody the producers had to produce for the non producers if you look at what
[02:55:54.120 --> 02:56:03.800]  happened the the pride land dried up there was pure depression everyone was starving and by the
[02:56:03.800 --> 02:56:10.520]  way what happened to the economy right after obama got reelected well all i can do is draw the
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:18.680]  parallels promoting food stamps and dependency before taking it away after forcing those who work
[02:56:18.680 --> 02:56:27.720]  to provide for those who maybe don't and provide for the giveaway and promising
[02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:34.760]  promising sustenance when you don't have it when the government tells people that they are going
[02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:43.720]  to take care of them when has it ever happened that people actually came in need when katrina came
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:50.680]  when you know the storms out east came when have they ever been able to make full on their promises
[02:56:51.720 --> 02:56:59.160]  but yet people continue to say i will be dependent to be taken care of well look at look at michael
[02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:03.560]  more i understand i mean he said thank god that the storm because the government now people need
[02:57:03.560 --> 02:57:07.080]  the government the government can't deliver i'm sorry say your point well that's that's that's
[02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:14.760]  that's that's true but you see the only answer the only answer if it is to be it's up to me
[02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:24.360]  we have to turn back into americans we have to say i am dependent on no one but me i am going to
[02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:32.680]  decide decide that i am the one that is going to take care of my own being and until people
[02:57:32.680 --> 02:57:41.080]  realize that no one can do anything for you it can't happen until they realize that the most basic
[02:57:41.080 --> 02:57:48.040]  dependency they have is food and until they listen to your warning that says guys food is the international
[02:57:48.040 --> 02:57:53.640]  medium of power it's the means by which every other country has gathered the guns every other
[02:57:53.640 --> 02:58:00.280]  country has put people into bondage every other from from the ancient israelites in egypt right
[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:06.040]  down to china the israelites went into bondage because of the food yeah how long were they there
[02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:13.480]  a long time 400 years interesting thought isn't it how long you want to be
[02:58:14.760 --> 02:58:21.080]  listen did you see the map of all the red states versus the teeny little blue states
[02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:29.000]  all all of the all of the people that are thinking true american it's unbelievable and

[03:01:02.200 --> 03:01:05.720]  we're gonna do another 30 minutes so and i'll probably end up airing this next week on the radio
[03:01:05.720 --> 03:01:10.360]  or even sooner people need to hear this all the stuff you're telling me off air what do you expect
[03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:15.800]  just give us a little uh little uh preview what is it you've told us what was coming so far what's
[03:01:15.800 --> 03:01:22.120]  going to come next well what we're going to see is more control and we're going to see we're going
[03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:32.520]  to see a lot less uh ability of people to respond you see 20 000 people are dropping below the
[03:01:32.520 --> 03:01:39.320]  poverty line every single day in this country and as people are no longer able to take care of food
[03:01:39.880 --> 03:01:45.880]  then they won't be able to take care of other things too if if people will understand
[03:01:46.840 --> 03:01:54.040]  that they do have power if they can keep their freedoms and the only way they can keep their
[03:01:54.040 --> 03:02:01.240]  freedom is that our body is by being independent and food is where they have to start i know i
[03:02:01.240 --> 03:02:07.160]  sound like a one one string banjo but even the people that are having trouble affording
[03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:13.720]  in the grocery store if they will if they will set aside a little bit get some look at food
[03:02:13.720 --> 03:02:19.400]  inflation you predicted that with precision four years ago it's happening ever since you said buy
[03:02:19.400 --> 03:02:25.320]  the foods save it and then it's happening it's happening but the fascinating thing is everybody
[03:02:25.320 --> 03:02:30.760]  say food is going up like crazy food is going up like crazy you remember we lost 70 percent of our
[03:02:30.760 --> 03:02:39.000]  corn crop and we're losing all other crops too but we haven't even hit we have not even hit
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:44.040]  the shortages that are going to come from this last crop failure we're still working on last
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:53.560]  year's crop so if you think if you think that the food prices are high right now what people
[03:02:53.560 --> 03:02:59.080]  must do is they must get the food in while they can still afford it they can freeze the price
[03:02:59.080 --> 03:03:04.040]  but more important they have to get the food in their possession just like you have to get
[03:03:04.040 --> 03:03:07.960]  gold in your possession and if you look at what the big companies are doing this is even the
[03:03:07.960 --> 03:03:14.440]  financial news they're rushing in and buying up the farmland the the producers uh they're hiring
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:18.920]  the farm families to run it uh they're they're buying up the food companies i mean that's
[03:03:18.920 --> 03:03:22.040]  where all the money's going what happened in the stock market when it dropped like a rock right
[03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:27.480]  after obama's were like it was elected what were what were people actually investing in they were
[03:03:27.480 --> 03:03:33.400]  investing in anything connected with guns and anything connected with agriculture do you realize
[03:03:33.400 --> 03:03:41.320]  that i was contacted by five different organizations three days after the election wanted to come in
[03:03:41.320 --> 03:03:49.080]  and invest in this company i know and they've got national talk show host angry that that i've even
[03:03:49.080 --> 03:03:52.840]  got sponsors and that i'm even doing my show and it's really just about the fact that they don't
[03:03:52.840 --> 03:03:57.400]  even want people like you around out there operating yeah i'm gonna pay in a bunch of everybody
[03:03:59.560 --> 03:04:07.320]  but anyway no it's the the investors in fact back when saris was talking about everybody
[03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:13.800]  putting their money into gold and then he shifted he shifted about six months ago
[03:04:13.800 --> 03:04:20.680]  and seriously said to all key investors don't waste your money on gold dump the gold and get
[03:04:20.680 --> 03:04:27.160]  into agriculture now what do you think they're thinking go back to the lion king what happens
[03:04:28.280 --> 03:04:36.120]  when scar says stick with me and you'll never be hungry again and all of the followers all of the
[03:04:36.120 --> 03:04:45.320]  non-producers the hyenas stuck with him and forced everyone who was a producer to provide that way
[03:04:45.320 --> 03:04:53.400]  and what happened draw your own conclusions how unbelievable e-foods direct 800 409 5633
